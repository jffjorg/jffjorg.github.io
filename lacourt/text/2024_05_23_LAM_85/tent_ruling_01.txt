  Case Number:  19STCP01720    Hearing Date:   May 23, 2024    Dept:  85 
Watson Land Company v. City
of Carson, 19STCP01720

Tentative decision on motion
for attorney’s fees: granted in part



 
            Petitioner
Watson Land Company (“Watson”) moves for awards of attorneys’ fees and costs
against Respondents City of Carson (“City”) and Carson City Council (“City Council”)
(collectively, “City”) following the court’s entry of judgment against
Respondents on January 8, 2024.
            The
court has read and considered the moving papers, opposition, and reply, and
renders the following tentative decision. 
 
            A. Statement of the
Case
            1. Petition
            Petitioner
Watson filed the Complaint against the City on May 6, 2019.  The operative pleading is the Fourth Amended
Complaint (“4thAC”) filed January 31, 2023, alleging claims for (1) declaratory
relief and (2) traditional or administrative mandamus.  The 4thAC alleges in pertinent part as
follows.
            Watson
is a developer and manager of industrial properties and owns real property in the
City.  4thAC, ¶9.  In 2017, the City enacted an urgency
ordinance that established a moratorium on the establishment, expansion, or
modification of truck yards, logistics facilities, hazardous materials or waste
facilities, container storage, and container parking (“Moratorium”).  4thAC, ¶16. 
The Moratorium was intended to provide time for the City to establish a
citywide community facilities district (“CFD”) to pay for infrastructure
maintenance.  4thAC, ¶17.  The Moratorium was extended on May 2, 2017
and again on March 20, 2018.  4thAC, ¶16.
According to the City, the need for a CFD was based on an
influx of new development and was necessary to fund municipal services
associated with new industrial and multi-family residential development.  4thAC, ¶19. 
Unlike development impact fees, a CFD is intended to pay for ongoing
services.  4thAC, ¶19.  The City Council had authority to the
Moratorium if the developer or tenant agreed to participate in a CFD to pay for
ongoing City services – including road and landscape maintenance, lighting,
public safety, storm water management -- to the City’s satisfaction.  4thAC, ¶18. 

            On
September 18, 2018, the City Council adopted Resolution 18-083, stating its
intent to form the Carson CFD pursuant to the Mello-Roos Community Facilities
Act of 1982 (“Mello-Roos Act”).  4thAC,
¶¶ 2, 20.  The Carson CFD was formed with
a single parcel owned by a company, CalPak, which had requested City approval
to construct an industrial building that was prohibited under the Moratorium.  4thAC, ¶21. 
The City Council conditioned approval of CalPak’s project on the
annexation of its property into the Carson CFD and payment of a special parcel
tax.  4thAC, ¶21.  The boundary of the Carson CFD consisted of
CalPak’s single property, with all other property within the City’s boundaries
labeled as the “Future Annexation Area.” 
4thAC, ¶21.  None of the property
owners in the Future Annexation Area were allowed to vote on the establishment
of the Carson CFD, the inclusion of their property in the Future Annexation
Area, or the amount of the special parcel tax. 
4thAC, ¶21.  
            At
a public hearing on November 7, 2018, the City Council adopted Resolution
18-119 to establish the single-parcel Carson CFD for CalPak.  4thAC, ¶22. 
It also approved Resolution 18-120 to levy the special parcel tax upon
CalPak and Resolution 18-121 to declare that CalPak had voted in favor of the
special parcel tax.  4thAC, ¶22.   Watson’s lawsuit does not challenge any of these
Resolutions.  4thAC, ¶25.  
            On
April 2, 2019, the City Council adopted Resolution 19-009, which outlined the administrative
annexation procedures for properties within the Future Annexation Area.  4thAC, ¶23. 
Approved as part of Resolution 19-009 were a March 2019 Fiscal Impact
Analysis for Citywide Future Development (“2019 FIA”), the Rate and Method of Apportionment
of Special Tax, a form copy of a Unanimous Approval of Annexation to a CFD, a
form copy of an Amendment to the Notice of Special Tax Lien, and a change to
the special tax rate.  4thAC, ¶23.  The public did not vote on the administrative
procedure, the decision to levy a special parcel tax, or the amount of the
special parcel tax.  4thAC, ¶23.  
            The
2019 FIA recommended that, because residential projects cause the fiscal
impacts which the City wanted to address via the Carson CFD, the City should
establish a Special Funding District (“SFD”) to mitigate those impacts.  4thAC, ¶24. 
The City did not follow this recommendation or impose annexation
requirements on residential developments except for multi-family units.  4thAC, ¶24. 

            After
Watson filed this lawsuit, on January 12, 2021, the City Council adopted Resolution
21-003 rescinding the annexation administrative procedures, tax rate, and 2019
FIA adopted in Resolution 19-009.  4thAC,
¶25.  The City Council did not replace
the 2019 FIA or establish new administrative procedures to annex properties
within the Future Annexation Area.  4thAC,
¶25.  The lack of uniform criteria fosters
the City’s abuse of discretion whereby it compels any property owner that
wishes to develop property to be annexed to the Carson CFD and pay the
resulting special parcel tax in perpetuity. 
4thAC, ¶¶ 26-27.  The payment of a
lump sum special parcel tax is not a real alternative because the lump sum will
be a large amount and the property owner does not benefit from the Carson CFD.  4thAC, ¶28. 
Watson does not know of any property owner who has chosen to make a lump
sum payment over annexation.  4thAC, ¶28.
 The City has used this leverage to
engage in an illegal pattern and practice of compelling property owners one- by-one
to levy the special parcel tax and approve the annexation of their property to
the Carson CFD.  4thAC, ¶29.
            On
February 2, 2021, Watson submitted a Development Permit Application for a
design overlay review (“DOR”) permit, No. 1860-2021.  4thAC, ¶31. 
The DOR permit would allow Watson to demolish an existing building at 2277
E. 220th Street and replace it with a Class A light industrial building (“Building
I”).  4thAC, ¶31.  On March 4, 2021, the City sent Watson a
letter which included the requirement that Watson either agree to annex the
property to the Carson CFD or establish a funding mechanism to provide an
ongoing source of funds.  4thAC,
¶32.   Watson must also pay the special tax
provided in the rescinded 2019 FIA, subject to annual adjustments.  4thAC, ¶32. 

            Watson
responded that the City cannot impose this requirement as a condition of
development approval.  4thAC, ¶33.   On May 13, 2021, the City replied that
it is requiring Watson’s proposed development to mitigate its impacts on City
services by funding the ongoing costs permitted by the Carson CFD.  4thAC, ¶34.  City staff stated that it has been using the
2019 FIA to determine those impacts in the Carson CFD.  4thAC, ¶34. 
Accordingly, the City refused to issue permits for Building I until
Watson agrees to pay the special parcel tax and annex its property into the Carson
CFD, based on the amount in the disapproved 2019 FIA.  4thAC, ¶34.
            Watson
has also applied for building permits to demolish two industrial buildings and replace
them with a single building on Bonita Street (“Building II”).  4thAC, ¶35.   On September 1, 2022, the City informed
Watson that it is required to mitigate its impacts on City services and must establish
a funding mechanism to provide an ongoing source of funds at a rate comparable
to the uniformed-standardized citywide rate under Resolution 19-009 and the
2019 FIA.  4thAC, ¶36.
            On
October 21, 2022, the City requested a $5,000 payment for annexation of the
property for Building II into the Carson CFD. 
4thAC, ¶37.   Watson paid
this fee under protest.  4thAC, ¶37.   On December 13, 2022, the City approved
Watson’s proposal for Building II conditioned on payment of the special parcel
tax and annexation to the Carson CFD.  4thAC,
¶38.  When Watson replied that it paid
the fee under protest, the City replied on January 13, 2023 that it cannot
accept payment under protest because annexation into the Carson CFD is
voluntary.  4thAC, ¶¶ 39-40.  Watson must either voluntarily annex and drop
its protest or retrieve the $5,000 check.  4thAC, ¶40. 

            The
City refuses to issue building permits for Building II until Watson agrees to
pay for the “voluntary” annexation without protest.  4thAC, ¶41. 
An annexation cannot be voluntary when the City conditions building
permits on an agreement for annexation.  4thAC,
¶41.  The City has not informed Watson of
any funding mechanism that would be an acceptable alternative to Carson CFD
annexation for either Building I or II.  4thAC,
¶42.  Watson therefore is required to vote
in favor of annexing each of Building I and II into the Carson CFD and levying
the special tax without protest in order to obtain the DOR permit and building
permits.  4thAC, ¶42. 
            Watson
is under contractual obligation to demolish and replace Building II by March
31, 2024.  Because the City refuses to
issue the building permits to Watson that it has already approved, Watson has
been required to pay the $5,000 and withdraw its language protesting the
payment.  4thAC, ¶51.  If Watson prevails in this lawsuit, it will
seek removal of the property underlying Building II from the Carson CFD and a
refund of all fees and taxes.  4thAC,
¶51.
Watson is challenging the City’s conditions for approval of
Buildings I and II on its vote in favor of Carson CFD annexation and payment of
the special property tax in perpetuity as imposed in violation of law.  4thAC, ¶53. 
In 1982, the Legislature enacted the Mello-Roos Act to provide a method
of imposing special parcel taxes to finance certain public capital
facilities.  4thAC, ¶57.  Watson enjoys the constitutional right to be
free from taxes on its properties other than as approved by voters in a manner
consistent with Articles XIII A (Prop 13), XIII C and XIII D (Prop 218) of the
California Constitution.  4thAC,
¶61.  Under Government Code (“Govt.
Code”) section 53326, a community services district may be established to finance
certain services provided that the levy of any special taxes is submitted to
the qualified voters of the Carson CFD, and to the qualified electors of the
territory to be annexed by the Carson CFD. 
4thAC, ¶57.  
The City’s special parcel tax scheme violates the
First Amendment because it curtails Watson’s freedom to vote for the special
parcel tax and annexation of property to the Carson CFD.   4thAC, ¶64. 
It requires unanimous approval of the tax and annexation to obtain
approval of Buildings I and II.  4thAC,
¶64.  Each property owner must mark the
ballot in favor of levying the special parcel tax and annexing its property
into the Carson CFD before the City will approve a project.  4thAC, ¶67. 
This also violates the property owner’s right to vote in secret.  4thAC, ¶67. 
The City’s conditions for approval compel Watson’s waiver of its First
Amendment rights and rights under California Constitution XII A, XIII C, and
XIII D in violation of the unconstitutional conditions doctrine.  4thAC, ¶68.
            Under
the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution and Article 1,
section 7(a) of the California Constitution, Watson is entitled to due process,
including adequate notice and an opportunity to be heard in a meaningful
manner.  4thAC, ¶¶ 69-70.  The City has prevented Watson from
challenging the imposition of the special parcel tax and Carson CFD
annexation.  4thAC, ¶71. 
            The
City also has violated substantive due process because there is no rational
connection or nexus between the amount of the special tax, the impacts of the
proposed developments, and the activities to be funded by the tax.  4thAC, ¶72. 
A special tax must be fairly related and proportional to the benefits
provided to the landowner and the City does not rely on any fiscal impact
analysis to show a causal nexus or to demonstrate that the tax rate is
proportional to the burden the projects would place on the community.  4thAC, ¶73. 

            Watson
did not challenge the legality of Resolutions 18-083, 18-119, 18-120, 18-121,
and 21-003.  4thAC, ¶¶ 74, 81.  Watson asserts that under the U.S.
Constitution, California Constitution, and the Mello-Roos Act, the City cannot
condition approval of its projects on a vote to impose a special parcel tax or
approve annexation of the underlying property into the Carson CFD.  4thAC, ¶¶ 74, 78.
            Watson
sought a declaration, writ of mandate, and injunction prohibiting the
City from conditioning approval of Buildings I and II on Watson’s agreement to
vote in favor of annexing the underlying properties into the Carson CFD or to
pay the special parcel tax.  4thAC Prayer
for Relief, ¶¶ 1-3.  If Watson was forced
to vote in favor of annexation of either property, it would seek an injunction
removing the properties from the Carson CFD and reimbursement of all associated
fees and taxes.  4thAC Prayer for Relief,
¶4.  Watson seeks attorneys’ fees, costs,
and litigation expenses.  4thAC Prayer
for Relief, ¶5.

B. Applicable Law
CCP section 1021.5 (“section 1021.5”) codifies the “private
attorney general” exception to the general rule that each side bears its own
fees unless the parties contracted otherwise. 
See CCP §1021.  Section 1021.5
permits a trial court to award fees to a successful party in any action that:
“has resulted in the enforcement of an important right affecting the public
interest if: (a) a significant benefit has been conferred on the general public
or a large class of persons, (b) the necessity and financial burden of private
enforcement are such as to make the award appropriate, and (c) such fees should
not in the interest of justice be paid out of the recovery.  The issue is committed to the trial court’s
discretion.  Flannery v. California
Highway Patrol, (“Flannery”) (1998) 61 Cal.App.4th 629, 634.
The courts take a
“broad, pragmatic view of what constitutes a ‘successful party’” in order to
effectuate the policy underlying section 1021.5.  Graham v.
DaimlerChrysler Corp.,
(2004) 34 Cal.4th 553, 565.  The party
seeking attorney’s fees need not prevail on all claims in order to qualify for
an award.  Harbor
v. Deukmejian, (1987) 43 Cal.3d
1078, 1103; Daniels v. McKinney, (1983) 146 Cal.App.3d 42, 55.  A party is considered successful under section
1021.5 if the litigation “contributed substantially to remedying the conditions
at which it was directed.” Planned Parenthood v.
Aakhus, (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th
162, 174.  In other words, the successful
party under section 1021.5 is the party that succeeds on “any significant issue
in litigation which achieves some of the benefit the parties sought in bringing
suit.”  Maria
P. v. Riles, (“Maria P.”)
(1987) 43 Cal.3d 1281, 1292; see Tipton-Whittingham v. City of Los Angeles, (2004) 34 Cal.4th 604, 610.  Prevailing counsel who qualify for an award
under section 1021.5 are entitled to compensation for all hours reasonably
spent.  Serrano
v. Unruh, (1982) 32 Cal.3d 621,
632–633.
The “significant
benefit” necessary for a section 1021.5 fee award need not represent a concrete
gain; in some cases a significant benefit may be recognized simply from the
effectuation of a fundamental constitutional or statutory policy. Woodland Hills Residents Assn., Inc. v. City
Council, (“Woodland Hills”) (1979) 23 Cal.3d 917, 939; Braude v.
Automobile Club of Southern Cal.,
(1986) 178 Cal.App.3d 994, 1011. 
Moreover, the extent of the public benefit need not be great to justify
an attorney fee award.  See, e.g., Protect
Our Water v. County of Merced, (2005)
130 Cal.App.4th 488, 496 (significant public benefit where litigation prompted
agency to improve methods of creating and managing its CEQA records). The trial
court determines “the significance of the benefit, as well as the size of the
class receiving benefit, from a realistic assessment, in light of all the
pertinent circumstances, of the gains which have resulted in a particular
case.”  Woodland
Hills, supra, 23 Cal.3d at 939–40.
The party seeking
attorney’s fees must show that the necessity for pursuing the lawsuit placed a
burden on the plaintiff “out of proportion to his individual stake in the
matter.” Woodland Hills, supra, 23 Cal. 3d at 941.  Although case law refers to this requirement
as the “financial burden” criterion, nothing in the language of CCP section
1021.5 limits the consideration of the necessity and financial burden clause to
solely financial interests.  Hammond v. Agran,
(2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 115, 125.  “The idea
is that the litigation for which fees are claimed must transcend one's interests, whether pecuniary or not.”  Id. at 127. 
The financial burden question is whether advancement of the public
interest was merely coincidental to attainment of the party’s personal
goals.  Bowman
v. City of Berkeley (2005)
131 Cal.App.4th 173, 181.  The party
seeking attorney’s fees must show that its litigation costs transcend its
personal interests.  Save Open Space Santa Monica Mountains v. Superior Court, (2000) 84 Cal.App.4th 235, 247.  The trial court's application of the
financial burden criterion involves a “realistic and practical comparison of
the litigant's personal interest with the cost of suit.” Families Unafraid to Uphold Rural El Dorado
County v. Bd. of Supervisors, (2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 505, 515.
 
            C. Statement
of Facts[1]
            1. Watson’s
Evidence
The court issued an injunction permanently enjoining and
permanently prohibiting the City from requiring as a condition of approval that
landowners agree to annex their properties into Community Facilities District (“CFD”)
and pay a special tax in perpetuity, or alternatively pay an upfront lump sum
that is intended to pay the special tax. 
See Taber Decl., Ex. 2.  All
land within the City’s boundaries is located in the Future Annexation Area.  See Taber Decl., Ex. 6.  The judgment that the court issued
permanently prohibits the City from imposing the same unconstitutional
conditions on property owners in the future. 
See Taber Decl., Ex. 2.  Watson
was the only landowner to finance the litigation.  Forsey Decl., ¶4.  Watson sought relief to protect all landowners
in the City, not just Watson.  Forsey
Decl., ¶3.  
 
Hourly Rates
Two firms represented Watson during this litigation, Jackson
Tidus and Hanson Bridget LLP.  Taber
Decl., ¶¶23-29.  The case moved with
Arlene M. Taber, Esq. (“Taber”) from Jackson Tidus to Hanson Bridget.  Taber Decl., ¶21.  The work was split between partners,
associates, and paralegals of appropriate skill and availability, which helped
reduce costs, among other things.  Taber
Decl., ¶¶24-25.
The requested hourly rates for Hanson Bridget LLP’s tenure
as Watson’s counsel are $745 for Taber, $525 for Wiemond Wu, Esq. (“Wu”), $795
for Mohammad Walizadeh, Esq. (“Walizadeh”), $795 for Adam H. Hoffman, Esq.
(“Hoffman”) $670 for Robin R. Baral, Esq. (“Baral”), $490 for Cole A. Benbow,
Esq. (“Benbow”), $460 for Jillian E. Ames, Esq. (“Ames”), $415 for paralegal Janell
E. Gerhke, and $325 for litigation specialists Rosa Hall (“Hall”), Carolyn
Lundin (“Lundin”), and Joe A. Ramirez (“Ramirez”).  Taber Decl., ¶¶ 26, 40.  
The requested hourly rates for Jackson Tidus are $745 for
Taber, $550 for Kathryn M. Casey, Esq. (“Casey”), $475 for Brittany A. Ortiz, Esq.
(“Ortiz”) and $425 for Lauren E. Palley, Esq. (“Palley”) (who was “eligible to
practice law”).  Taber Decl., ¶40.  These rates are reasonable based on approved
rates from recent cases in Los Angeles County Superior Court under section
1021.5 and are comparable to rates awarded in Los Angeles County Superior Court
at the Stanley Mosk Courthouse in cases that involve attorneys with similar
education, skill, and experience.  Taber
Decl., ¶¶ 22-32. 
 
Reasonable Hours
The hours claimed in this case were based on contemporaneous
recorded time that was reviewed each month for accuracy and reasonableness, and
that the time requested was necessary to represent Watson adequately and
competently in this matter and complete each of the tasks.  Taber Decl., ¶¶33-35.  Watson’s attorneys exercised conservative
billing practices, including not charging for travel and appropriately staffing
the matter based on number of years of experience, skill, expertise, avoiding
duplication, and not charging for attorneys to learn the case, or for work that
needed significant revisions.  Taber
Decl., ¶¶35, 37, 41, 42.
The City engaged in extensive pleading challenges in this
action, including multiple demurrers and motions to strike, which led to other
motions, such as the motion for preliminary injunction and the review of
hundreds of additional documents.  Taber
Decl., ¶33-42.  Watson was prevented for
years from conducting discovery due to the City’s motion to stay discovery,
which forced Taber to resort to sending California Public Records Act (“CPRA”) requests
to the City, coupled with general problems of obtaining documents from City
throughout the litigation.  Taber Decl.,
¶7(g).  
Watson drafted and responded to over 130 documents in
connection with this matter, which required extensive legal and factual
research involving complex constitutional issues.  Taber Decl., ¶¶37-38.  Time was also spent involved in numerous
other court hearings and related matters, such as conferences, settlement
attempts, and communications with the City’s attorneys.  Taber Decl., ¶¶33-42.
Over the course of approximately seven years, starting in
October 2017 through February 29, 2024, the two law firms expended a total of
1,587.4 hours.  Taber Decl., ¶37.
 
Pre-Litigation Activities 
A total of 84.6 hours was expended on prelitigation
activities, including analyzing the City’s intent to form the CFD, analyzing
the City’s moratorium, understanding the City’s intent to impose an interim
development fee, researching and evaluating the City’s ordinances and resolutions
(Resolution Nos. 18-083, 18-119, 18-120, 18-121; Ordinance Nos. 1814;
Resolution Nos. 19-009 and 21-003). This work was necessary to exhaust Watson's
administrative remedies and prosecute this lawsuit.  It was also intended to persuade the City to
adopt a legal approach to public financing and avoid this litigation
altogether.  
This time includes Taber: 77.8 hours; Casey: 1.1 hours; and
Ortiz: 5.7 hours.  Taber Decl., ¶37a.
 
The Complaint, Service of Summons, and Related Tasks
Through June 12, 2019 
A total of 68.3 hours was expended on drafting the Complaint
and the publication order for the Summons, drafting ex parte applications to
serve the City by publication, attending the hearing on the ex parte
applications, attending the trial setting conference and providing notice of
the same, reviewing the court’s minute orders, and overseeing legal issues
involving the personal service of the Summons and Complaint on the City.  Numerous legal theories had to be evaluated
and researched, and facts assembled and considered in order to draft a
verifiable Complaint. 
This time includes: an unstated time expended by Taber; 28.8
hours by Casey; and 39.3 hours by Ortiz. Taber Decl., ¶37b.
 
The FAC and
Related Tasks Through January 27, 2021
A total of 80.8 hours was expended drafting the FAC,
analyzing the City’s Answer; attending trial setting and status conferences,
reviewing minute orders/rulings, conferring with the City and drafting
stipulations and notices, preparing and attending hearings on motions,
reviewing the City’s preemptory challenge, drafting and reviewing case
management statements, analyzing and opposing the City’s motion for judgment on
the pleadings, opposing the City’s ex parte application for a stay of discovery,
and preparing for and attending the hearings. 
This time includes: 57 hours by Taber and 23.8 hours by Casey.
Taber Decl., ¶37c.
 
The SAC, Demurrer/Motion to Strike, Motion for
Preliminary Injunction, Motion for Leave to Amend, and Related Tasks Through
April 12, 2022
A total of 372.2 hours was expended drafting the SAC (which
was necessitated by the City rescinding the resolution addressed by the
lawsuit), drafting an ex parte application for leave to file the SAC and
publication of pleading or order shortening time, analyzing and drafting a
reply to the City’s opposition to the ex parte application, preparing and
attending hearings on motions, reviewing minute orders/rulings and preparing
notices, analyzing and opposing the City’s demurrer to and motion to strike the
SAC, drafting Watson’s ex parte request to take the City’s motion for judgment
on the pleadings off calendar, drafting Watson’s motion for a preliminary
injunction, analyzing and replying to the City’s opposition, drafting Watson’s
objections and request to modify tentative decision on preliminary injunction, drafting
the joint statement of mediation date, drafting Watson’s supplemental brief
regarding continuing violation requested by the court, analyzing and replying
to the City’s supplemental brief, and meeting, conferring and communicating
with the City's attorneys. 
This time includes: 175.4 hours by Taber; 109.5 hours by
Casey; 7.6 hours by Palley; 7.8 hours by Hoffman; and 6.8 hours by Baral. Taber
Decl., ¶37d.
 
The TAC, Demurrer/Motion to Strike, Motion for Leave
to Amend, and Related Tasks Through January 20, 2023
A total of 133.1 hours was expended drafting the TAC, evaluating
and opposing the City’s demurrer and motion to strike, preparing and attending
the hearing, reviewing minute orders/rulings, preparing and reviewing various
notices and joint stipulation, drafting Watson’s motion for leave to amend and
reply, and meeting, conferring and communicating with the City's attorneys. 
This time includes: 118.1 hours by Taber; 8.7 hours by Wu;
6.1 hours by Hoffman; and 0.2 hours by Hall. Taber Decl., ¶37e.
 
The 4thAC, Motion for Leave to Amend, Demurrer, and Related
Tasks Through June 29, 2023
A total of 169.3 hours was expended drafting the 4thAC to
incorporate the City's refusal to issue building permits for Watson's Bonita
Street property, drafting Watson’s motion for leave to amend (necessitated by
the City's refusal to stipulate to the amendment), attending the trial setting
conferences, analyzing and opposing the City’s demurrer to the 4thAC, preparing
and attending hearings on the demurrer, reviewing the minute orders and the court’s
decision overruling the Demurrer, analyzing the City’s Answer to the 4thAC,
attending and preparing for two trial setting conferences, and meeting,
conferring and communicating with the City's attorneys. 
This time includes: 100.9 hours by Taber; 34.4 hours by Wu;
14.1 hours by Hoffman; 19.6 hours by Benbow; 20.8 hours by Lundin; and 0.3
hours by Ramirez.  Taber Decl., ¶37f.
 
The CPRA Requests, Propounding Discovery, Research to
Locate City Documents Not Produced, and Preparation of the Appendix of Evidence
A total of 262.5 hours was expended drafting two CPRA requests,
propounding discovery, preparing for depositions, analyzing the documents
produced by the City to identify relevant evidence and gaps in the evidence,
conferences and communications with City officials and the City's attorneys to
obtain the missing documents, research to locate the missing responsive
documents (necessary because the City refused to produce all of the relevant
documents, prepare an administrative record, and blocked the depositions), and
preparing the appendix of evidence.  
In 2021, Watson met and conferred with the City, and
prepared to take depositions of the City’s key witnesses that were
administering and overseeing the CFD to collect relevant evidence to support
its case.  Even though the validation
action entitled Watson to pursue depositions of key witnesses, the City sought
and obtained a stayed preventing the depositions from going forward. As part of
another effort to obtain the missing relevant evidence, Watson requested the
City to prepare an administrative record.  Without a response, Watson then inquired if
the City's attorneys would accept service of a CPRA request.  It declined to do so, and Watson directed a
second CPRA request to the City on April 5, 2023.  Receiving no documents in a timely fashion,
Watson was forced to propound discovery requests on April 24, 2023.  Only after an extensive meet-and-confer
process did the City provide supplemental responses and produce over 3,300
documents.  None of the produced
documents pertained to the other properties annexed by the City that were
raised as an issue in Watson’s 4thAC.  Watson’s
litigation team had to spend an extraordinary amount of time to review the
City’s public records via its online database to retrieve relevant documents
and information about each of the 16 annexations that have been approved, and
the other annexations that were pending, before the City. 
Watson was forced to expend this additional research into
the public records to piece together the extent to which the City was engaging
in a pattern and practice of enforcing its illegal taxing scheme – documents
that were clearly responsive to Watson's CPRA requests and discovery demands,
but were not produced by the City.  This
work was directly the result of the City's failure to produce all of the
requested responsive documents.  After
synthesizing thousands of documents, time was spent to put together a concise
appendix of evidence with approximately 1,600 pages, which had to be indexed
and reduced in file size for filing and lodging. 
This time includes: 122 hours by Taber; 90.2 hours by Wu;
20.8 hours by Lundin; 12.4 hours by Gehrke; and 16.9 hours by Casey.  Taber Decl., ¶37g.
 
The Mandamus Trial and Related Tasks 
A total of 127.8 hours were expended on preparing Watson’s motion
for writ of mandate and supporting documents, analyzing the City’s opposition, drafting
Watson’s reply, preparing for and attending the mandamus trial on November 2,
2023, reviewing the court’s tentative and final decisions, and preparing the judgment
and writ.  As the issues were complex, Taber
and Wu consulted with other attorneys who had specialized experience with some
of the issues. The consultations were for discrete issues and were not
duplicative of Wu's and Taber’s efforts. 
This time includes: 53.9 hours by Taber; 68.7 hours by Wu; 2.9
hours by Walizadeh; and 2.3 hours by Hofmann.  Taber Decl., ¶37h.
 
Settlement Discussions and Meet and Confer Efforts

A total of 165.3 hours was expended on settlement
discussions and meet-and-confer efforts.  The parties engaged in extensive settlement
negotiations that lasted for months.  The
parties also engaged in conferences regarding the proposed judgment and writ. 
This time includes: 156.0 hours by Taber; 9.3 hours by Wu; 1.6
hours by Hofmann; and 8.4 hours by Casey. Taber Decl., ¶37i.
 
Post-Judgment Attorney Fees and Costs 
A total of 123.5 hours was expended pursuing Watson’s
post-judgment costs and fees. Time was spent reviewing all the invoices for the
past seven years.  Costs had to be broken
down into categories before categorizing them within Watson’s Memorandum of
Costs as required by law. Watson’s counsel spent time analyzing the City’s
motion to tax costs, and drafting Watson’s opposition. 
This time includes: 6.9 hours by Taber; 60.8 hours by 60.8; 46.9
hours by Ames; 0.5 hours by Gehrke; and 8.4 hours by Lundin. 
The listed time only represents efforts up to February 29,
2024.  A lot of work on the fee motion
and accompanying declarations occurred in March 2024. A supplemental
declaration will be filed at the end of the March billing cycle and for the
April billing cycle.  Taber Decl., ¶37j.
 
Conclusion
Taber expended a total of 952.1 hours (431.9 hours at Hanson
Bridgett and 520.2 hours at Jackson Tidus) over the course of seven years
(approximately five years of litigation and two years of pre-litigation Taber
Decl., ¶39.
Taber’s lodestar fees are $321,765.50, Wu’s fees are
$142,852.50, Walizadeh’s fees are $2,305.50, Hofmann’s fees are $25,360.50, Baral’s
fees are $4,556.00, Benbow’s fees are $9,604.00, Ames’ fees are $21,574.00, Gehrke’s
fees are $5,353.50, Hall’s fees are $65.00, Lundin’s fees are $9,490.00, Ramirez’
fees are $97.50.  The total lodestar
through February 2024 is $543,024.  
A 1.5 lodestar multiplier is warranted given the risk of
challenging a governmental agency, and the amount of work entailed due to the
City’s various motions and discovery challenges.  Taber Decl., ¶37; Wu Decl., ¶16.  Watson requests the court to award attorney
fees in the amount of $1,564,662 (which includes a multiplier of 1.5). Taber
Decl., ¶40.  
 
2. The City’s
Evidence
Watson is one of the largest industrial developers in
California.  Forsey Decl., ¶3. Watson
admitted that it has a significant financial interest in development
entitlements from the City.  Watson’s
Motion for Preliminary Injunction, p. 18; 4thAC, ¶31. 
 
Course of Proceedings 
Watson has engaged in a myriad of improper filings and
litigation tactics in this matter. Watson has filed many documents without
leave of court, filed amended pleading after amended pleading, engaged in
unnecessary motion practice with the City, and excessively filed multiple
amended documents.  Flowers Decl.,
¶2.  
Watson’s Complaint, filed on May 8, 2019, alleged three
causes of action for reverse validation of the CFD and CFD Resolutions, as well
as a writ of mandate under Code of Civil Procedure section 1085 seeking to
invalidate the CFD and the City’s levy of special taxes.  Flowers Decl., ¶3.  In response to the City’s meet-and-confer
letter that the causes of action were barred by the statute of limitations and
the City would file a demurrer and motion to strike, Watson filed a FAC on June
12, 2019 which removed the causes of action for writ of mandate, but continued
to alleged reverse validation.  Flowers
Decl.,  ¶4.  
On October 16, 2020, Watson served a deposition notice and a
request for production of documents for James Nguyen, a deposition notice and
document request for three other City employees: Sharon Landors, Saied Naaseh,
and John Raymond, a deposition notice and document request for a person most
knowledgeable, and a deposition notice for former Councilmember Albert Robles.  The City’s counsel objected, and the
depositions did not go forward.  Flowers
Decl., ¶5.
On January 5, 2021, Watson served amended deposition notices
and document requests for Mr. Nguyen and Ms. Naaseh.  The City’s counsel again objected and again the
depositions again did not go forward.  Flowers Decl., ¶6.
On January 12, 2021, the City Council adopted Resolution No.
21-003, which repealed Resolution No. 19-009 in its entirety.  On January 15, 2021, the City filed a motion
for judgment on the pleadings and an ex parte application for a stay of
discovery. The court granted the City’s ex parte application and ordered a stay
of discovery.  Flowers Decl., ¶7.
In order to avoid a hearing on the merits, Watson filed an
ex parte application to file a SAC, which was granted by the court. On February
11, 2021, Watson filed its SAC to (inconceivably) invalidate Resolution No.
21-003, along with other challenges to the CFD Resolutions which continued to
be time-barred.  Flowers Decl., ¶8.
The City demurred to the SAC on March 16, 2021.
Notwithstanding that the City had made multiple appearances in the case and
that Taber knew that the City was imminently filing a demurrer to the SAC,
Watson bizarrely and unethically attempted to take the City’s default.  Of course, the request for entry of default
was rejected by the Clerk. Flowers Decl., ¶9.
While the City’s demurrer was pending, Watson sought a preliminary
injunction which was denied by the court on November 23, 2021.  On March 23, 2022, Department 45 sustained the
City’s demurrer in its entirety and gave Watson 20 days leave to amend.  Flowers Decl., ¶10.
Watson filed its TAC on April 12, 2022, with only causes of
action for declaratory relief and writ of mandate. On May 6, 2022, the City’s
counsel informed Taber that the City intended to file a demurrer to the first
cause of action based on the statute of limitations, and a motion to strike the
second cause of action for writ of mandate because it was added without leave
of court.  Flowers Decl., ¶11.  The City filed its demurrer and motion to
strike and, on October 20, 2022 (several months after the demurrer was filed),
Watson belatedly filed a motion for leave to amend to add the writ of mandate
cause of action.  On December 5, 2022,
Department 45 granted Watson’s motion for leave to amend, struck the TAC, and
ordered Watson to re-file and re-serve the TAC within ten days.  Flowers Decl., ¶11.
Watson re-filed the TAC on December 14, 2022 and this case
was subsequently transferred to Dept. 85.  The City filed its demurrer to the TAC on
January 18, 2023, which was set for hearing on February 23, 2023. Flowers
Decl., ¶12.  In a similar delaying tactic
to the TAC, on the evening of January 30, 2023, the night before the parties’
trial setting conference, Watson filed another motion for leave to amend and
file its 4thAC.  Watson’s
motion for leave to amend was never heard. 
Instead, at the trial setting conference, the court permitted the
amendment and ordered the City to file its demurrer to the 4thAC, which it did.
The City’s demurrer was overruled.  Flowers
Decl., ¶¶ 13-14.  
Watson’s petition for writ of mandate in the 4thAC was heard
on November 2, 2023, and the court issued its ruling on November 8, 2023. Following
the court’s ruling, Watson served multiple proposed judgments and writs of
mandate and counsel for the parties met and conferred.  The City’s counsel repeatedly advised that the
proposed judgments and writs of mandate expanded the court’s ruling to include
issues which were not litigated.  The
court had to hold three OSC hearings just to end up agreeing to the City’s
original proposed judgment.  Moreover,
Watson filed a Fifth Amended Complaint (“5thAC”) after the court’s ruling on
the petition for writ of mandate, which was stricken because the court had
deemed the 4thAC amended according to proof. 
Flowers Decl., ¶16. 
On April 5, 2024 – after judgment had been entered --Watson
served an expert witness demand.  Watson
then served a document demand for the expert witness retained by the City in
relation to the motion for attorney fees.  Flowers Decl., ¶¶ 19-20.  The City applied ex parte for a protective
order, which the court granted on April 18, 2024, after determining the
discovery was a waste of attorney resources. 
Flowers Decl., ¶21.
 
Reasonable Hourly Rates and Hours
The City’s expert, Gerald Knapton, Esq. (“Knapton”) opines
that the hourly rate proposed by Watson is not the prevailing hourly rate for
private attorneys in the community conducting litigation of the same type, and
that the cases cited in Taber’s declaration are of limited value because they
are not rates for similar work and are not helpful for analyzing the
non-contingent rates applicable to this motion. 
Knapton Decl., ¶35.  Knapton cites
the 2023 Real Rate Report and opines that the prevailing hourly rate for real
estate work for partners in Los Angeles County is $400, and that the prevailing
hourly rates for associates is $344.  See
Knapton Decl., ¶¶38, 45.  These rates
are still on the higher end and exceed the general real estate rates for both
partners and associates.  See Knapton
Decl., ¶¶39, 40.  The Real Rate Report is
the gold standard for determining market rates for services performed for use
in calculating market rates, and Watson provided no evidence supporting the
requested rates as the prevailing rates for the same kind of work.  See Knapton Decl., ¶¶42-44.  
The City’s counsel requested Taber to provide
contemporaneous time records for the City to evaluate them, but Taber refused
to do so.  Flowers Decl., ¶22.  This is not typical or customary for larger
fee motions, and Watson’s attorneys provided far weaker evidence in the form of
broad summaries of categories of loosely related tasks.  See Knapton Decl., ¶¶52, 98.  Watson’s failure to produce time records
entitles the court to discount their declarations entirely.  See Knapton Decl., ¶¶47-52.  The evidence Watson submitted is insufficient
to enable the court or the City to evaluate the actual time spent.  See Knapton Decl., ¶52.  Watson has failed to distinguish between the
hours incurred for each task, and the descriptions provided for such a large
fee request are insufficient to be able to determine what was reasonably and
necessarily incurred in this matter.  See
Knapton Decl., ¶¶ 27, 47-101.  
If not discounted entirely, the hours for various matters
should be reduced substantially given that the City prevailed on the majority
of them.  More specifically, the hours
should be reduced as follows:  by 25.7
hours for Casey in connection with the initial pleadings; by 36.8 hours for
Taber’s work in connection with the FAC; by 90.3% for the work performed in
connection with the SAC; by 69.2% for the work performed in connection with the
TAC and due to Watson’s improper litigation tactics; by 30% for the work
performed in connection with the two CPRA requests, propounding discovery,
research to locate City documents not produced, and analysis of documents; by
20% for the work performed in connection with the writ of mandate for
improperly attempting to expand the scope of the court’s ruling; and by 10% for
work performed in connection with settlement discussions/additional meet and
confer efforts.  See Knapton
Decl., ¶¶ 55-59, 61-65, 67-72, 73-78, 80-84, 85-95; Id., Exs. 5A, 5B,
6A, 6B, 7, 7A, 7B, 8, 8A, 8B.  
The fees incurred in connection with post-judgment effort should
be denied altogether in light of Watson’s untimely post-trial demand for expert
witness information and request for production of documents after discovery was
closed.  See Flowers Decl., ¶¶
16-21.
The requested lodestar multiplier is unreasonable and
unwarranted, given that Watson’s attorneys represent themselves as experienced
real estate and land use attorneys on the application of taxes and fees, so the
subject matter of this action cannot have been novel or difficult.  See Knapton Decl., ¶44.  Watson’s attorneys’ skill is questionable
given their multiple deficient pleadings and motions, as well as bizarre
actions throughout this litigation.  See
Knapton Decl., ¶44.
 
3. Reply Evidence
            Watson claims a
total of 167.3 hours expended on post-judgment effort since March 1, 2024.  Taber Reply Decl., ¶7.  This includes: 77.3 hours by Taber;
81.3 hours by Wu; 0.9 hours by Ames; and 7.8 hours by Lundin. 
Ames and Lundin researched attorney rates in the Los
Angeles Superior Court, and specifically rates awarded in the writs and
receivers department.  Lundin also
researched declarations that Knapton had previously submitted in support of fee
motions.  Wu and Taber reviewed and drafted
all law and motion papers that came after March 1, 2024, including: completing
Watson’s motion for attorneys’ fees, filed on March 7, 2024; completing
Watson’s opposition to the City’s motion to tax costs; reviewing the City’s ex
parte application to continue the hearings on Watson’s motion for attorneys’ fees
and the City’s motion to tax costs; drafting Watson’s opposition to the City’s
ex parte application and attending the hearing; preparing and drafting Watson’s
reply for its fee motion; and attending the hearing on the City’s motion to
quash, in which the court expressed that Watson can seek discovery after it
reviewed the expert’s declaration.  None
of the work of these timekeepers were duplicative.  Taber Reply Decl., ¶7.
Watson experienced an estimated loss
of $85,169 to $92,575 in leasing income due to the City’s actions.  Taber Reply Decl., Ex. 35, ¶23.  
Settlement discussions began in 2017 and lasted until
the lawsuit was filed in 2019.  Watson’s
attorneys successfully sought discovery in other section 1021.5 motions in
which all discovery was not necessarily prohibited.  Taber Reply Decl., ¶9.
            The invoices include substantial
amounts of detailed attorney-client privileged information and attorney work
product.  Taber Reply Decl., ¶11.
            Knapton’s methodology cherry picks
portions of the Rate Report.  He submitted
a declaration in 2021 in support of Hanson Bridgett where he opined the
applicable median hourly rate would be $826 for partners and $525 for
associates.  See Taber Reply Decl.,
¶¶5-6, Exs. 36, 37.  Taber previously has
been awarded a lodestar rate of $650 an hour, and it is reasonable for that
rate to have increased to $745 in three years. 
Taber Reply Decl., ¶4.
                        
            D. Analysis
The court employs the
“lodestar” analysis when looking to determine the “reasonableness” of an
attorney fee award.  The lodestar figure
is calculated by multiplying the number of hours reasonably spent by the
reasonable market billing rate.  Serrano
v. Priest, (1977) 20 Cal.3d 25, 48.
Petitioner Watson seeks
an award of attorney’s fees under section 1021.5.  Watson’s moving papers list a lodestar of $1,043,108
and its reply increases the lodestar to $1,146,328.  Watson also seeks a 1.5 multiplier for a
total fee award of $1,719,492.
 
            1.
Entitlement
a. Successful
Party
Courts take a “broad,
pragmatic view of what constitutes a ‘successful party’” to effectuate the
policy underlying section 1021.5.  Graham v. DaimlerChrysler Corp., supra,
34 Cal.4th at 565.  The party seeking
attorney’s fees need not prevail on all alleged claims to qualify for an
award.  Harbor
v. Deukmejian, supra, 43 Cal.3d at 1103.  A party is successful under section 1021.5 if
the party succeeds on “any significant issue in litigation which achieves some
of the benefit the parties sought in bringing suit.”  Maria P., supra, 43
Cal.3d at 1292.  
Watson asserts that it is the prevailing party under section
1021.5.  Mot. at 12.  The City does not dispute that Watson is a
successful party in this litigation.
 
b. Important Right
Affecting the Public Interest
Generally, “a right need not be constitutional in nature to
justify the application of the private attorney general doctrine.”  Woodland Hills, supra, 23 Cal.3d at 935.  Nor
must the important right be confined to a particular area of law.  Ibid. 
At the same time, the public always has a significant interest in seeing
that laws are enforced and always derives some benefit when illegal private or
public conduct is rectified.  Flannery,
supra, 61 Cal.App.4th at 635.  The Legislature did not intend to authorize
an award of fees under section 1021.5 in every lawsuit enforcing a
constitutional or statutory right.  Ibid.  The court should realistically assess the
significance of the right in relationship to the achievement of fundamental
legislative goals.  Woodland Hills,
supra, 23 Cal.3d at 936; see also Robinson v. City of
Chowchilla, (2011) 202 Cal.App.4th 382, 394. 
Watson asserts that it enforced important rights by
obtaining an injunction prohibiting the City from imposing unconstitutional
conditions and protecting the electorate’s right to vote on taxes.  No longer can the City extract a vote in
favor of annexation and taxes in exchange for a project approval.  Mot. at 13. 
The City does not seriously dispute this issue.  
The court agrees that Watson has enforced an important right
affecting the public interest.
 
c. Significant
Benefit Conferred on the Public or a Large Class of Persons
The significant benefit
necessary for a section 1021.5 fee award need not represent a concrete
gain.  In some cases, a significant
benefit may be recognized simply from the effectuation of a fundamental
constitutional or statutory policy. Woodland Hills, supra, 23 Cal.3d at 939. 
Moreover, the extent of the public benefit need not be great to justify
an attorney’s fee award.  See, e.g., Protect
Our Water v. County of Merced, supra, 130 Cal.App.4th at 496
(significant public benefit where litigation prompted agency to improve methods
of creating and managing its CEQA records). The trial court determines “the
significance of the benefit, as well as the size of the class receiving benefit,
from a realistic assessment, in light of all the pertinent circumstances, of
the gains which have resulted in a particular case.”  Woodland Hills, supra, 23 Cal.3d at 939–40.
The section 1021.5 factors are interrelated; the more
fundamental and important the right vindicated, the lower the showing required
for the element that a large class of persons benefit.  See Press v. Lucky Stores, Inc.,
(“Press”) (1983) 34 Cal.3d 311, 319. 
The converse is also true.  The
less fundamental and important the right vindicated, the higher the showing
required for a significant benefit to a large class of persons.  
Watson argues that, prior to this lawsuit, the City was
engaging in a pattern and practice in which it imposed unconstitutional
conditions in exchange for project approval, enacting a tax without a
two-thirds vote of the electorate.  Since
all land in the City is located in the Future Annexation Area, the City
intended to force all landowners eventually to annex their property into the
CFD and pay the tax.  Thus, the
litigation benefited all landowners in the City and all residents of a voting
age who have a right to vote on taxes. 
Mot. at 14.
The City disputes the scope of persons benefited.  The primary relief sought by Watson was to
invalidate a permit condition affecting its privately owned property: Buildings
I and II.  The special tax at issue is
not a generally applicable tax and was not imposed as an incident of property
ownership.  The court only held that the
City cannot require annexation and payment of the special tax as a condition of
development approval.  Opp. at 10.
Even as limited by the City, Watson conferred a significant
benefit on a large group of persons: commercial and industrial developers in
the City.
 
d. Necessity and Financial
Burden of Private Enforcement 
“The necessity of private enforcement looks to the adequacy
of public enforcement and seeks economic equalization of representation in
cases where private enforcement is necessary.” 
In re Conservatorship of Whitley, (“Whitley”) (2010) 50
Cal.4th 1206, 1214-15 (internal quotations omitted).  In determining the financial burden on the
petitioner, courts have focused not only on the costs of the litigation but
also any offsetting financial benefits that the litigation yields or reasonably
could have been expected to yield.”  Id.
at 1215.  This prong evaluates
“incentives rather than outcomes.”  See
id. at 1220.  The party seeking attorneys’ fees must show that
the necessity for pursuing the lawsuit placed a burden on the plaintiff “out of
proportion to his individual stake in the matter.” Woodland
Hills, supra, 23 Cal. 3d at 941.  
This prong encompasses two issues: (1) whether private
enforcement was necessary and (2) whether the financial burden of private
enforcement warrants subsidizing the successful party’s attorneys.  Lyons v. Chinese Hospital Assn., (2006)
136 Cal.App.4th 1331, 1348.  The
necessity of private enforcement becomes clear when the action proceeds against
only the governmental agencies that bear responsibility for the alleged
violations.  Id; see Woodland Hills,
supra, 23 Cal.3d at 941.  The financial burden of private
enforcement is met when the cost of the claimant’s legal victory transcends his
personal financial interest.  Woodland Hills, supra, 23 Cal.3d at 941.  Non-financial motivations are
irrelevant.  Whitley, supra, 50 Cal.4th at 1216-17.

Watson points out that
the necessity of private enforcement is readily met when a lawsuit is brought
against the governmental entity to enforce its responsibilities.  Mot. at 15. 
The City does not contest that private enforcement by Watson was
necessary.   
Watson argues that the necessity
for pursuing the lawsuit placed a burden on it out of proportion to its
individual stake in the matter.  Watson
alone paid for the litigation.  Forsey
Decl., ¶4.  Watson never achieved any
financial gain because the judgment includes no award of damages against the
City.  Finally, Watson obtained the same
injunctive relief that all other landowners and voters in the City
received.  Mot. at 15-16.
The City argues that
Watson will make millions of dollars from its development of Industrial
Buildings I and II.  Watson has admitted
that every month of delay in its property development was costing it $85,169 to
$92,575 in lost leasing income.  Thus,
Watson stands to gain $3.6 million in one year, more than triple the cost of
its attorney’s fees in this litigation.  This
case has always been about Watson’s real estate portfolio and bottom line, and
any benefit to the public is purely coincidental to Watson’s financial
gain.  Opp. at 11-12.
The City’s argument is
based on the premise that Watson could not develop the two properties without
winning the lawsuit.  This is
incorrect.  Watson could have simply agreed
to pay the annual $5,000 special tax and obtained a development permit.  Instead, as Watson’s reply argues (Reply at
6), it lost $3 million in revenue by choosing to file suit.
The financial burden of private enforcement warrants
subsidizing Watson’s attorneys, and Watson is entitled to its reasonable
attorney fees.
 
2. Reasonable Hourly
Rates
Generally, the reasonable hourly rate used for the lodestar
calculation is the rate prevailing in the community for similar work.  Center for Biological Diversity v. County
of San Bernardino, (2010) 188 Cal.App.4th 603, 616.  In making its calculation, the court may rely
on its knowledge and familiarity with the legal market, as well as the
experience, skill, and reputation of the attorney requesting fees, the
difficulty or complexity of the litigation to which that skill was applied, and
affidavits from other attorneys regarding prevailing fees in the community and
rate determinations in other cases.  569
East County Boulevard LLC v. Backcountry Against the Dump, Inc., (2016)
6 Cal.App.5th 426, 437.  
The requested hourly rates for Hanson Bridget’s tenure as
Watson’s counsel are $745 for Taber, $525 for Wu, $795 for Walizadeh, $795 for
Hoffman, $670 for Baral, $490 for Benbow, $460 for Ames, $415 for non-attorney
paralegal Gerhke, and $325 for litigation specialists Hall, Lundin, and
Ramirez.  Taber Decl., ¶¶ 26, 40.  
The requested hourly rates for Jackson Tidus are $745 for
Taber, $550 for Casey, $475 for Ortiz, and $425 for Palley.  Taber Decl., ¶40.  
According to Watson, these rates are reasonable based on
approved rates from recent cases in Los Angeles County Superior Court under
section 1021.5 and are comparable to rates awarded at the Stanley Mosk
Courthouse in cases that involve attorneys with similar education, skill, and
experience.  Taber Decl., ¶¶ 22-32. 
The City’s expert, Knapton opines that the hourly rates
proposed by Watson are not the prevailing hourly rate for private attorneys in
the community conducting litigation of the same type, and that the cases cited
in Taber’s declaration are of limited value because they are not rates for
similar work and are not helpful for analyzing the non-contingent rates
applicable to this motion.  See Knapton
Decl., ¶35.  The Real Rate Report is the
gold standard for determining market rates for services performed for use in
calculating market rates, and Watson provides no evidence supporting the
requested rates as the prevailing rates for the same kind of work.  See Knapton Decl., ¶¶42-44.  The 2023 Real Rate Report states that the
prevailing hourly rate for real estate work for partners in Los Angeles County
is $400, and that the prevailing hourly rates for associates is $344.  See Knapton Decl., ¶¶38, 45.  These rates are still on the high end and
exceed the general real estate rates for both partners and associates.  See Knapton Decl., ¶¶39, 40.  Opp. at 14-15.
Watson replies that Knapton’s methodology cherry picks
portions of the Rate Report.  Knapton also
submitted a declaration in 2021 in which he opined that opined the applicable
median hourly rate for Hanson Bridgett would be $826 for partners and $525 for
associates.  See Taber Reply
Decl., ¶¶5-6, Exs. 36, 37.  Taber
previously has been awarded a lodestar rate of $650 an hour, and it is
reasonable for that rate to have increased to $745 in three years.  Taber Reply Decl., ¶4.
The court accepts Watson’s proposed rates as
reasonable.
 
3. Reasonableness
of Hours 
An attorney’s fee award should ordinarily include
compensation for all hours reasonably spent on the litigation.  Ketchum v. Moses, (2001) 24
Cal.4th 1122, 1133.  The trial court must
carefully review attorney documentation of hours expended and eliminate padding
in the form of inefficient or duplicative efforts.  Id. at 1132; see also Morris
v. Hyundai Motor America (2019)
41 Cal.App.5th 24, 39 (“it is appropriate for a trial court to reduce a fee
award based on its reasonable determination that a routine, non-complex case
was overstaffed to a degree that significant inefficiencies and inflated fees
resulted”).  The factors for evaluating
the reasonableness of attorney’s fees include the nature of the litigation, its
difficulty, the amount involved, the skill required, and the successful of the
attorney’s efforts.  Stokus v. Marsh,
(1990) 217 Cal.App.3d 647, 657.  
While there is no doubt Watson was successful, the other Stokus
factors warrant a reduction of the requested fees as unreasonable.  There are a number of reasons why the hours
of Watson’s attorneys are grossly excessive. 
In reaching this conclusion, the court hastens to add that it is not
disputing that the hours were actually incurred.  Rather, the hours simply are not reasonable.
First, the City is correct (Opp. at 13) that Watson has the
burden of showing “the fees incurred were allowable, were reasonably necessary
to the conduct of the litigation, and were reasonable in amount.”  Nightingale v. Hyundai Motor America,
(1994) 31 Cal.App.4th 99, 104.  To
satisfy this burden, evidence and descriptions of billable tasks must be
presented in sufficient detail to enable the City and the court to evaluate
whether the case was overstaffed, the time attorneys spent on specific claims,
and the reasonableness of the hours expended.  Lunada Biomedical v. Nunez, (2015) 230
Cal.App.4th 459, 486-87.  The court may
reduce compensation for a failure to maintain appropriate time records.  Id. 

The evidence submitted by Watson is insufficient to enable the
court or the City to accomplish this task because the reader cannot easily evaluate
which attorney performed a particular task and whether that attorney spent the
appropriate time on that task.  See Knapton
Decl., ¶52.  While Watson relies on the
fact that invoices are not required and that fees may be awarded based on
declarations alone (Reply at 13), case law establishes a preference that
attorneys seeking fees provide their contemporaneous time records: “We publish
to underline that contemporaneous time records are the best evidence of
lawyers’ hourly work. They are not indispensable, but they eclipse other
proofs. Lawyers know this better than anyone. They might heed what they know.”  Taylor v. County of Los Angeles, (2020)
50 Cal.App.5th 205.  Despite Taber’s many
years of experience, she and Wu made the decision not to present their time
records even though the City’s attorneys asked for them.  Watson’s attorneys “elected to only provide
this Court with far weaker evidence in the form of broad summaries of
categories of loosely related tasks in order to support her argument that
counsel has billed a reasonable number of hours for those tasks.”  Knapton Decl., ¶50.  This issue alone is reason to significantly
reduce Watson’s fees.
Second, Watson overstaffed this case with ten attorneys, a
paralegal, and three litigation specialists. 
Some of this is attributable to the fact that Taber changed law firms
and staffed the case with a new set of lawyers. 
It is true that Taber and Wu did most of the work and that most of the
lawyers apparently were assigned discrete (but unknown) tasks.  Nonetheless, every time a lawyer was assigned
a task, that lawyer had to be brought up to speed.  Knapton opined that the case should have been
staffed with one partner supervising associates.  Knapton Decl., ¶45.  This is probably correct, and the number of
associates should have been limited to two. 
Third, Watson overstates the effort of its attorneys in this
case, routinely relying on the review or preparation of a simple document –
e.g., a trial setting notice, minute order, case management statement or
preemptory challenge – to make it appear that significant hours were
justified.  In fact, the attorney effort
consisted of mostly of getting a viable pleading that would overcome a demurrer:
(1) Watson’s Complaint, filed on May 8, 2019, the FAC filed on June 12, 2019, (2)
an ex parte application to file a SAC and the subsequent February 11, 2021 SAC,
(3) the City’s demurrer to the SAC on March 16, 2021, the TAC filed on April
12, 2022 after the City’s demurrer had been sustained,  (4) the City’s demurrer and motion to strike
the TAC, Watson’s motion for leave to amend to add the writ of mandate cause of
action, Department 45’s order permitting Watson to re-file the TAC, (5) the City’s
demurrer to the TAC, Watson’s belated effort for leave to amend and file its 4thAC,
and (6) the court’s permission for Watson to file a 4thAC, for which the City’s
demurrer was overruled.  
The City blames Watson for untimely and improper actions in
this pleading effort.  Flowers Decl., ¶¶ 3-14.  Whether or not it is correct, Watson’s effort
to obtain a pleading that would withstand demurrer does not justify the fees
sought.  
Fourth, a trial court may reduce attorney fees based on the
plaintiff’s degree of success.  A reduced
fee award is appropriate if the relief, however significant, is limited in
comparison to the scope of the litigation as a whole.  Save Our Uniquely Rural Community
Environment v. County of San Bernardino, (2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 1179,
1185; see also Laurel Heights
Improvement Assn. v. Regents of University of California, (1988) 47
Cal.3d 376, 428, n. 29 (trial court should consider the fact that appellant, a
successful party, was ultimately unsuccessful in its challenge to agency’s
finding of mitigation).  See In
re Tobacco Cases I, (“In re Tobacco”) (2013) 216 Cal.App.4th 570
(approving apportionment of successful and unsuccessful contract claims based
on percentage of time spent on unsuccessful theory.  
There is no doubt
that Watson prevailed on its mandamus claim. 
However, Watson failed on most of its reverse validation efforts
in Department 45.  Apart from the motions
concerning the pleadings, Watson (a) attempted to take the City’s default,
which was denied (Flowers Decl., ¶9), (b) moved for a preliminary injunction,
which was denied, (c) attempted to depose various City employees which never
occurred due to the City’s objection (Flowers Decl., ¶¶ 5-6).  It is only fair to apportion fees between
Watson’s failed reverse validation claim and its successful mandamus claim.
Additionally, in Department 85, Watson (d) prevailed a trial
but then filed multiple proposed judgments and writs of mandate after trial, (e)
filed a 5thAC which was stricken by the court (Flowers Decl., ¶16),  and (f) made a post-judgment demand for
exchange of expert witnesses and document demand from Knapton, which necessitated
granting the City’s ex parte application for a protective order (Flowers Decl.,
¶21).  
Fifth, Watson is not entitled to attorney’s fees for making
a CPRA request.  As the City argues (Opp.
at 18), CPRA requests are separate and apart from litigation. Wilder v.
Superior Court, (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 77, 83 (public records request is
distinct process from litigation discovery).  
The City cannot be required to foot the bill for Watson’s CPRA effort,
even if it was necessitated by the City’s refusal to respond to discovery.  
Sixth and finally, Watson improperly attempts to tag on more
than $100,000 in attorney fees for time incurred after its fee motion was filed
on March 1, 2024.  Taber Reply Decl.,
¶8.  This includes 77.3 hours incurred by
Taber and 81.3 hours incurred by Wu (id.), and some of this time was
incurred to prepare the moving fee papers. 
Taber Reply Decl., ¶7.  This is
decidedly improper because it does not give the City any chance to
respond.  New
evidence/issues raised for the first time in a reply brief are not properly
presented to a trial court and may be disregarded.  Regency Outdoor Advertising v. Carolina
Lances, Inc., (1995) 31 Cal.App.4th 1323, 1333.  
Watson argues that it is standard practice to include time
that could not be included in the fee motion. 
Reply at 12.  This is true only
for preparation of the reply brief, not all post-motion time.  Additionally, Watson included time for
preparing the fee motion after February 29 and before the fee motion filling
date of March 7, and it did so without any explanation.  
The court generally agrees with Knapton that the 84.6 hours
for pre-litigation activities is appropriate. 
Knapton Decl., ¶54.  The court also
concludes that a significant portion of the 262.5 hours of effort in gathering
and preparing the Appendix of Evidence was appropriate, even though the hours
incurred for the CPRA requests are not recoverable and although the work was not
necessarily by the attorneys who should have performed the work.  Finally, the court generally agrees with
Knapton that the remaining categories must be reduced, albeit not in the same
manner or percentage as he does.  
Rather than parse the hours by category as Knapton did, the
court will adopt a percentage of the total hours as reasonable.  Where there is a voluminous fee application,
the court may make across-the-board percentage cuts either in the number of
hours claimed or the final lodestar figure. 
Morris v. Hyundai Motor America, (2019) 41 Cal.App.4th
at 24, 40.  At a blended hourly rate of $561 and reasonable
hours totaling 720, the reasonable lodestar figure is $403,920.
 
4. Multiplier
“[T]he unadorned lodestar figure reflects the general local
hourly rate for a fee-bearing case; it does not include any compensation for
contingent risk, extraordinary skill, or any other factors a trial court may
consider under Serrano III.”  Ketchum
v. Moses, supra, 24 Cal.4th at 1138. 
“The adjustment to the lodestar figure, e.g., to provide a fee
enhancement reflecting the risk that the attorney will not succeed, constitutes
earned compensation; unlike a windfall, it is neither unexpected nor fortuitous.”  Id. 
“Rather, it is unintended to approximate market level compensation for
such services, which typically includes a premium for the risk of non-payment
or delay in payment of attorney fees.”  Id.
The factors to consider include the novelty and difficulty
of the litigation, the extent to which the litigation precluded other
employment by the attorneys, the contingent nature of the fee award, the fact
that an award against the state would ultimately fall on the taxpayers, the
fact that the attorneys received public and charitable funding for the purpose
of bringing lawsuits of the character involved, and the fact that the moneys
awarded would inure not to the benefit of the individual lawyers but the organizations
employing them.  Ramos v. Countrywide
Home Loans, Inc., (2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 615, 622-23.
Watson argues that it is entitled to a 1.5 multiplier.  It prevailed on novel and complex federal and
state constitutional issues. It is risky to challenge government agencies that
the plaintiff is dependent upon for future approvals that are necessary to the
plaintiff’s core business. The City’s serial demurring, refusal to stipulate to
amended pleadings, and lack of cooperation with discovery, were strategic and
likely intentional so that the City could continue to annex as many properties
as possible before the court could declare its scheme unconstitutional. The
City fabricated situations designed to moot Watson’s lawsuit. Finally, during
the entirety of this unnecessarily long litigation, Watson was penalized by the
City’s refusal to issue any building permits, and thus, lost rental revenue
while construction costs increased.  Mot.
at 21-22.
These are not reasons for a multiplier.  The court agrees that the lawsuit presented a
novel issue, but it was not complex or difficult.  Moreover, any difficulty is built into the
hourly rate of Watson’s counsel.  There
is no evidence that Watson’s attorneys took the case on a contingency or
prevented them from taking other work.  An
award against the City will ultimately fall on the taxpayers, and there is no
evidence that Watson’s attorneys received public and charitable funding for the
purpose of bringing lawsuits of the character involved.  The request for a multiplier is denied.
 
E. Conclusion
Watson is awarded attorney’s fees of $403,920 under
section 1021.5.[2]
