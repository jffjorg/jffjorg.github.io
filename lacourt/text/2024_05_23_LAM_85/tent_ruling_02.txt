[1] The
parties have each filed numerous objections to the other party’s evidence.  The court is
unaware of any legal authority which requires a court to rule on evidentiary
objections to a motion, except a motion for summary motion/adjudication (CCP §
437c (q)) or a special motion to strike (CCP §425.16 (b)(2).  See also, Sweetwater Union High
School Dist. v. Gilbane Building Co. (2019) 6 Cal.5th 931, 947-49.  The lack of need for court rulings on
evidentiary objections is particularly acute for an attorney fee motion because
the court is well aware of the underlying case, can look at the court file to
refresh its memory, is well versed in attorney rates in the community, and can
evaluate the reasonableness of fees with little aid.  Consequently, the court declines to rule on
the parties’ objections.

Watson’s motion indicates that it will seek costs that are taxed as part of the
City’s motion to tax costs.  Mot. at
2.  This is improper.  Watson also states that its reply will
include additional costs for responding to the motion to tax costs.  Mot at 20. 
Taber’s reply declaration does not address any additional costs. 


Watson Land Company v. City
of Carson and City Council, 19STCP01720

Tentative decision on motion
to strike and tax costs: mostly granted



 
 
            Respondents
City of Carson (“City”) and Carson City Council (“City Council”) (collectively,
“City”) move to strike and tax the memorandum of costs filed by Petitioner
Watson Land Company (“Watson”).
            The
court has read and considered the moving papers, opposition, and reply, and
renders the following tentative decision. 
 
            A. Statement of the
Case
            1. Petition
            Petitioner
Watson filed the Petition against the City on May 6, 2019.  The operative pleading is the 4thAC filed
January 31, 2023, alleging claims for (1) declaratory relief and (2) traditional
or administrative mandamus.  The 4thAC alleges
in pertinent part as follows.
            Watson
is a developer and manager of industrial properties and owns real property in the
City.  4thAC, ¶9.  In 2017, the City enacted an urgency
ordinance that established a moratorium on the establishment, expansion, or
modification of truck yards, logistics facilities, hazardous materials or waste
facilities, container storage, and container parking (“Moratorium”).  4thAC, ¶16. 
The Moratorium was intended to provide time for the City to establish a
citywide community facilities district (“CFD”) to pay for infrastructure
maintenance.  4thAC, ¶17.  The Moratorium was extended on May 2, 2017
and again on March 20, 2018.  4thAC, ¶16.
According to the City, the need for a CFD was based on an
influx of new development and was necessary to fund municipal services
associated with new industrial and multi-family residential development.  4thAC, ¶19. 
Unlike development impact fees, a CFD is intended to pay for ongoing
services.  4thAC, ¶19.  The City Council had authority to the
Moratorium if the developer or tenant agreed to participate in a CFD to pay for
ongoing City services – including road and landscape maintenance, lighting,
public safety, storm water management -- to the City’s satisfaction.  4thAC, ¶18. 

            On
September 18, 2018, the City Council adopted Resolution 18-083, stating its
intent to form the Carson CFD pursuant to the Mello-Roos Community Facilities
Act of 1982 (“Mello-Roos Act”).  4thAC,
¶¶ 2, 20.  The Carson CFD was formed with
a single parcel owned by a company, CalPak, which had requested City approval
to construct an industrial building that was prohibited under the Moratorium.  4thAC, ¶21. 
The City Council conditioned approval of CalPak’s project on the
annexation of its property into the Carson CFD and payment of a special parcel
tax.  4thAC, ¶21.  The boundary of the Carson CFD consisted of
CalPak’s single property, with all other property within the City’s boundaries
labeled as the “Future Annexation Area.” 
4thAC, ¶21.  None of the property
owners in the Future Annexation Area were allowed to vote on the establishment
of the Carson CFD, the inclusion of their property in the Future Annexation
Area, or the amount of the special parcel tax. 
4thAC, ¶21.  
            At
a public hearing on November 7, 2018, the City Council adopted Resolution
18-119 to establish the single-parcel Carson CFD for CalPak.  4thAC, ¶22. 
It also approved Resolution 18-120 to levy the special parcel tax upon
CalPak and Resolution 18-121 to declare that CalPak had voted in favor of the
special parcel tax.  4thAC, ¶22.   Watson’s lawsuit does not challenge any of these
Resolutions.  4thAC, ¶25.  
            On
April 2, 2019, the City Council adopted Resolution 19-009, which outlined the administrative
annexation procedures for properties within the Future Annexation Area.  4thAC, ¶23. 
Approved as part of Resolution 19-009 were a March 2019 Fiscal Impact
Analysis for Citywide Future Development (“2019 FIA”), the Rate and Method of
Apportionment of Special Tax, a form copy of a Unanimous Approval of Annexation
to a CFD, a form copy of an Amendment to the Notice of Special Tax Lien, and a
change to the special tax rate.  4thAC,
¶23.  The public did not vote on the
administrative procedure, the decision to levy a special parcel tax, or the
amount of the special parcel tax.  4thAC,
¶23.  
            The
2019 FIA recommended that, because residential projects cause the fiscal
impacts which the City wanted to address via the Carson CFD, the City should
establish a Special Funding District (“SFD”) to mitigate those impacts.  4thAC, ¶24. 
The City did not follow this recommendation or impose annexation
requirements on residential developments except for multi-family units.  4thAC, ¶24. 

            After
Watson filed this lawsuit, on January 12, 2021, the City Council adopted Resolution
21-003 rescinding the annexation administrative procedures, tax rate, and 2019
FIA adopted in Resolution 19-009.  4thAC,
¶25.  The City Council did not replace
the 2019 FIA or establish new administrative procedures to annex properties
within the Future Annexation Area.  4thAC,
¶25.  The lack of uniform criteria fosters
the City’s abuse of discretion whereby it compels any property owner that
wishes to develop property to be annexed to the Carson CFD and pay the
resulting special parcel tax in perpetuity. 
4thAC, ¶¶ 26-27.  The payment of a
lump sum special parcel tax is not a real alternative because the lump sum will
be a large amount and the property owner does not benefit from the Carson CFD.  4thAC, ¶28. 
Watson does not know of any property owner who has chosen to make a lump
sum payment over annexation.  4thAC, ¶28.
 The City has used this leverage to
engage in an illegal pattern and practice of compelling property owners one- by-one
to levy the special parcel tax and approve the annexation of their property to
the Carson CFD.  4thAC, ¶29.
            On
February 2, 2021, Watson submitted a Development Permit Application for a
design overlay review (“DOR”) permit, No. 1860-2021.  4thAC, ¶31. 
The DOR permit would allow Watson to demolish an existing building at 2277
E. 220th Street and replace it with a Class A light industrial building (“Building
I”).  4thAC, ¶31.  On March 4, 2021, the City sent Watson a
letter which included the requirement that Watson either agree to annex the
property to the Carson CFD or establish a funding mechanism to provide an
ongoing source of funds.  4thAC,
¶32.   Watson must also pay the special tax
provided in the rescinded 2019 FIA, subject to annual adjustments.  4thAC, ¶32. 

            Watson
responded that the City cannot impose this requirement as a condition of
development approval.  4thAC, ¶33.   On May 13, 2021, the City replied that
it is requiring Watson’s proposed development to mitigate its impacts on City
services by funding the ongoing costs permitted by the Carson CFD.  4thAC, ¶34.  City staff stated that it has been using the
2019 FIA to determine those impacts in the Carson CFD.  4thAC, ¶34. 
Accordingly, the City refused to issue permits for Building I until
Watson agrees to pay the special parcel tax and annex its property into the Carson
CFD, based on the amount in the disapproved 2019 FIA.  4thAC, ¶34.
            Watson
has also applied for building permits to demolish two industrial buildings and replace
them with a single building on Bonita Street (“Building II”).  4thAC, ¶35.   On September 1, 2022, the City informed
Watson that it is required to mitigate its impacts on City services and must establish
a funding mechanism to provide an ongoing source of funds at a rate comparable
to the uniformed-standardized citywide rate under Resolution 19-009 and the
2019 FIA.  4thAC, ¶36.
            On
October 21, 2022, the City requested a $5,000 payment for annexation of the
property for Building II into the Carson CFD. 
4thAC, ¶37.   Watson paid
this fee under protest.  4thAC, ¶37.   On December 13, 2022, the City approved
Watson’s proposal for Building II conditioned on payment of the special parcel
tax and annexation to the Carson CFD.  4thAC,
¶38.  When Watson replied that it paid
the fee under protest, the City replied on January 13, 2023 that it cannot
accept payment under protest because annexation into the Carson CFD is
voluntary.  4thAC, ¶¶ 39-40.  Watson must either voluntarily annex and drop
its protest or retrieve the $5,000 check.  4thAC, ¶40. 

            The
City refuses to issue building permits for Building II until Watson agrees to
pay for the “voluntary” annexation without protest.  4thAC, ¶41. 
An annexation cannot be voluntary when the City conditions building
permits on an agreement for annexation.  4thAC,
¶41.  The City has not informed Watson of
any funding mechanism that would be an acceptable alternative to Carson CFD
annexation for either Building I or II.  4thAC,
¶42.  Watson therefore is required to vote
in favor of annexing each of Building I and II into the Carson CFD and levying
the special tax without protest in order to obtain the DOR permit and building
permits.  4thAC, ¶42. 
            Watson
is under contractual obligation to demolish and replace Building II by March
31, 2024.  Because the City refuses to
issue the building permits to Watson that it has already approved, Watson has
been required to pay the $5,000 and withdraw its language protesting the
payment.  4thAC, ¶51.  If Watson prevails in this lawsuit, it will
seek removal of the property underlying Building II from the Carson CFD and a
refund of all fees and taxes.  4thAC,
¶51.
Watson is challenging the City’s conditions for approval of
Buildings I and II on its vote in favor of Carson CFD annexation and payment of
the special property tax in perpetuity as imposed in violation of law.  4thAC, ¶53. 
In 1982, the Legislature enacted the Mello-Roos Act to provide a method
of imposing special parcel taxes to finance certain public capital
facilities.  4thAC, ¶57.  Watson enjoys the constitutional right to be
free from taxes on its properties other than as approved by voters in a manner
consistent with Articles XIII A (Prop 13), XIII C and XIII D (Prop 218) of the
California Constitution.  4thAC,
¶61.  Under Government Code (“Govt.
Code”) section 53326, a community services district may be established to finance
certain services provided that the levy of any special taxes is submitted to
the qualified voters of the Carson CFD, and to the qualified electors of the
territory to be annexed by the Carson CFD. 
4thAC, ¶57.  
The City’s special parcel tax scheme violates the
First Amendment because it curtails Watson’s freedom to vote for the special
parcel tax and annexation of property to the Carson CFD.   4thAC, ¶64. 
It requires unanimous approval of the tax and annexation to obtain
approval of Buildings I and II.  4thAC,
¶64.  Each property owner must mark the
ballot in favor of levying the special parcel tax and annexing its property
into the Carson CFD before the City will approve a project.  4thAC, ¶67. 
This also violates the property owner’s right to vote in secret.  4thAC, ¶67. 
The City’s conditions for approval compel Watson’s waiver of its First
Amendment rights and rights under California Constitution XII A, XIII C, and
XIII D in violation of the unconstitutional conditions doctrine.  4thAC, ¶68.
            Under
the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution and Article 1,
section 7(a) of the California Constitution, Watson is entitled to due process,
including adequate notice and an opportunity to be heard in a meaningful
manner.  4thAC, ¶¶ 69-70.  The City has prevented Watson from
challenging the imposition of the special parcel tax and Carson CFD
annexation.  4thAC, ¶71. 
            The
City also has violated substantive due process because there is no rational
connection or nexus between the amount of the special tax, the impacts of the
proposed developments, and the activities to be funded by the tax.  4thAC, ¶72. 
A special tax must be fairly related and proportional to the benefits
provided to the landowner and the City does not rely on any fiscal impact
analysis to show a causal nexus or to demonstrate that the tax rate is
proportional to the burden the projects would place on the community.  4thAC, ¶73. 

            Watson
did not challenge the legality of Resolutions 18-083, 18-119, 18-120, 18-121,
and 21-003.  4thAC, ¶¶ 74, 81.  Watson asserts that under the U.S.
Constitution, California Constitution, and the Mello-Roos Act, the City cannot
condition approval of its projects on a vote to impose a special parcel tax or
approve annexation of the underlying property into the Carson CFD.  4thAC, ¶¶ 74, 78.
            Watson
sought a declaration, writ of mandate, and injunction prohibiting the
City from conditioning approval of Buildings I and II on Watson’s agreement to
vote in favor of annexing the underlying properties into the Carson CFD or to
pay the special parcel tax.  4thAC Prayer
for Relief, ¶¶ 1-3.  If Watson was forced
to vote in favor of annexation of either property, it would seek an injunction
removing the properties from the Carson CFD and reimbursement of all associated
fees and taxes.  4thAC Prayer for Relief,
¶4.  Watson seeks attorneys’ fees, costs,
and litigation expenses.  4thAC Prayer
for Relief, ¶5.
 
            2.
Course of Proceedings
            On
May 8, 2019, the court granted Watson’s ex parte application to serve the

            B. Applicable
Law 
Although the purpose of much civil litigation is to make the
injured party whole, the traditional common law rule is that the parties must
bear their own costs.  Davis v.
KGO-TV, Inc., (1998) 17 Cal.4th 436, 446. 
It is, therefore, axiomatic that the right to recover costs is purely
statutory.  In the absence of an
authorizing statute, no costs can be recovered by either party.  Crib Retaining Walls, Inc. v. NBS/Lowry,
Inc., (1996) 47 Cal.App.4th 886, 889; Garcia v. Hyster Co.,
(1994) 28 Cal.App.4th 724, 732; Perko’s Enterprises, Inc. v. RRNS
Enterprises, (“Perko’s”) (1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 238, 241.
Prejudgment costs allowable under statute shall be claimed
and contested in accordance with rules adopted by the Judicial Council.  CCP §1034(a). 
Thus, any notice of motion to strike or to tax costs shall be served and
filed 15 days after service of the cost memorandum; if the cost memorandum was
served by mail, the period is extended as provided in CCP section 1013.  CRC 3.1700(b)(1).  These time limitations, however, are not
jurisdictional, and a trial court has broad discretion in allowing relief from
a late filing where there is absence of a showing of prejudice by the opposing
party.  Hoover Community Hotel
Development Corp. v. Thomson, (1995) 168 Cal.App.3d 485.  Also, CRC 3.1700(b)(3) allows the parties to
agree to extend the time for serving and filing the cost memorandum and a
motion to strike or tax costs.
CCP section 1032 defines the term “prevailing party” as the
party with a net monetary recovery, a defendant in whose favor a dismissal is
entered, or a defendant who avoids all liability.  Great Western Bank v. Converse
Consultants, Inc., (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 609, 612; Childers v. Edwards,
(1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 1544, 1548; Coltrain v. Shewalter, (1998) 66
Cal.App.4th 94, 101-02.  CCP section
1032(a)(4) provides that when any party recovers other than monetary relief,
the prevailing party shall be as determined by the court, and under those
circumstances, the court in its discretion may allow costs or not.  Building Maintenance Services Co. v. AIL
Systems, Inc., (1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 1014, 1025.
The statutory scheme clearly establishes two mutually
exclusive sets of trial preparation expenses – one set which is allowable as a
matter of right to the prevailing party (CCP §§1032(b), 1033.5(a)), and one
which is not (CCP §§ 1033.5(b), 1032(b)). 
Expenses which do not fit into either of these two categories fall into
a special statutory safety net: they may be recovered only at the discretion of
the court.  CCP §1033.5(c).  Science Applications Internat. Corp. v.
Superior Court, (“Science Applications”) (1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 1095,
1103.  CCP section 1033.5(a) contains a
list of expenses which are allowable as costs, and includes filing fees,
deposition transcripts, models, blowups, exhibits and copies of exhibits if
reasonably helpful to the trier of fact. Michell v. Olick, (1996) 49
Cal.App.4th 1194, 1200; Science Applications, supra, 39
Cal.App.4th at 1102 & n.7.
A properly verified memorandum of costs is prima facie
evidence that the costs listed in the memorandum were necessarily
incurred.  Bach v. County of Butte,
(“Butte”) (1989) 215 Cal. App. 3d 294, 308.  If an item on the memorandum of costs is
properly objected to as not reasonable or necessary, the cost is put in issue
and the burden is on the party claiming them as costs.  Ladas v. California State Auto. Ass’n,
(“Ladas”) (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761, 774.  Whether a cost item was reasonably necessary presents
a question of fact for the trial court.  Id.  When a cost item is challenged by a motion to
tax costs, the party claiming costs must justify their claim, and documentation
may be required to support the cost.  Butte
supra, 215 Cal. App. 3d at 308.  Once this occurs, the question is whether the
documentation must be of evidentiary quality. 
Jones v. Dumrichob, (1998) 63 Cal. App. 4th 1258, 1267 (expert’s invoice
sufficed to support costs).
Even where a party receiving a favorable judgment is
entitled to costs as of course, the trial court has broad discretion to
disallow unnecessary costs.  Perko’s,
supra, 4 Cal.App.4th 238.  It is
generally held that costs awarded should be reasonably necessary to the conduct
of the litigation rather than merely convenient or beneficial to its
preparation.  Thon v. Thompson,
(1994) 29 Cal.App.4th 1546, 1548.  When
items claimed as costs do not appear on their face as proper and necessary and
the items are properly challenged by a motion to tax costs, the burden of
establishing the necessity of the items is on the party claiming them as
costs.  Whitney v. Whitney, (1958)
164 Cal.App.2d 577.
 
            C. Statement
of Facts
            1. The City’s
Evidence
While Watson may be the prevailing party on the 4thAC, all
complaints and motions before that point were unnecessary.  See Flowers Decl., ¶¶2-14.  Most of the filing fees in the memorandum of
costs were unnecessarily incurred by Watson because the City successfully
defended against Watson’s numerous defective complaints and petition for a
preliminary injunction.  See Flowers,
Decl., ¶¶2-10.  Watson’s filing tactics
have been excessive, unreasonable, and unnecessary. 
Watson has submitted an excessive amount of fees, with
insufficient descriptions or dates to be able to determine which documents were
actually filed.  See Flowers
Decl., ¶14, Ex. A.  There were
unnecessary duplicative filing fees, the reservation fees for the motion for
summary judgment are improper because the motion was never filed, and many of
the documents were filed without leave of court.  See Flowers Decl., ¶¶2-10, Ex. A.  
The $2,130.33 for “Lodging of Appendix of Exhibits ISO
Motion for Writ of Mandate” should be stricken because it is unlikely to be a
filing fee.  See Flowers Decl.,
Ex. A.  Watson’s filing of the 5thAC led
to multiple unnecessary filings and multiple OSC hearings on the proposed
judgment.  See Flowers, Decl., ¶¶13-14, Ex. A.
Watson seeks
reimbursement for a deposition that did not occur -- i.e., the deposition of James Nguyen – and this cost was not reasonable or
necessary.  Flowers Decl., ¶¶5-6.  
Watson claims
$4,042.43 in service of process fees, even though the parties had agreed to
email service since 2019.  Flowers Decl.,
¶3.  
 
2. Watson’s
Evidence
On May 6, 2019, Watson commenced this lawsuit against the
City as a reverse validation and writ lawsuit. The lawsuit was initially
assigned to Department 85. On May 8, 2019, Watson personally served the City
with the initial pleading and summons. Watson filed an ex parte application to
obtain permission for publication of the summons for the reverse validation
action as required by Code of Civil Procedure, section 863. The court granted
Watson’s ex parte application to serve the public by publication in the Daily
Breeze newspaper and by posting at City Hall. Taber Decl., ¶5.  
Throughout the four years of pleading challenges, Watson
reasonably amended its pleadings to reflect the changing circumstances and
relationship between the parties.  Taber
Decl., ¶17.  Watson sought leave to amend
when the City started to modify its taxing scheme or when the City took other
actions on Watson’s projects with pending applications with the City.  Taber Decl., ¶¶11, 12.  Watson asked the City to stipulate to amend
the pleading so it could avoid bringing a motion for leave to amend.  Taber Decl., ¶17.  The City challenged Watson’s pleadings by way
of demurrers and/or motions to strike on four different occasions, but only one
of those motions was ever successful. 
Taber Decl., ¶¶8, 12, 13, 16, 17. 

After the FAC was filed, it was necessary and reasonable for
Watson to notice the deposition of James Nguyen, given his role at the City and
the declaration he submitted in support of the City’s opposition to the writ of
mandate.  See Taber Decl., ¶6.
In light of the court’s November 8, 2023 decision and
January 8, 2024 judgment, the fees incurred for Watson’s ex parte application
for injunctive relief were proper.  See
Taber Decl., ¶9; Id., Exs. 1, 2. 

When it became apparent that there would be a long wait for
a trial, Watson sought to expedite a judicial determination by a motion for
summary judgment. After the City imposed the conditions of approval requiring
Watson to annex its property into the Carson CFD and approve the levying of the
special tax for its project, it became necessary to amend the SAC.  Since Watson was amending its complaint,
Watson took the summary judgment reservation off calendar until the applicable
pleading was determined.  Taber Decl.,
¶10.  
The court’s November 8, 2023 decision stated that it would
permit amendment without a written motion. 
See Decision, pp. 30-31.  The
court also stated that the parties were required to meet and confer on any
objections to the proposed judgment before the OSC re: judgment hearing on
December 12, 2023.  See Decision, p.
31.
Watson’s counsel sent a proposed judgment and writ to the
City’s attorneys on November 17, 2023, and objections would have been due ten
days later, on November 27, 2023.  Taber
Decl., ¶21.  The City requested an
eight-day extension to provide objections until December 5, 2023, but Watson
instead allowed two extra days in light of the Thanksgiving holiday, meaning that
the City’s objections were due on November 29, 2023.  Taber Decl., ¶21.  The next day, Watson’s counsel initiated a
meet and confer, but the City’s attorney indicated that she was unavailable and
out of the country vacationing in Costa Rica and insisted that she was the
City’s only attorney who could conduct the meet and confer.  Taber Decl., ¶22.  On December 4, 2023, Watson filed a response
to the OSC due to the unavailability of the City’s attorneys to meet and confer.  Taber Decl., ¶22.  When counsel for the parties were finally able
to meet and confer on December 8, 2023, less then five days before the OSC hearing,
they were unable to reach an agreement over the language of the judgment and
writ.  The court continued the OSC to
January 4, 2024.  Taber Decl., ¶22.
Watson never ordered transcripts in conjunction with the
trial court proceedings.  Taber Decl.,
¶24.  
LA CourtConnect was not available free of charge until after
September 7, 2021.  Watson’s court parking,
CourtCall, and court appearance fees, all of which were incurred before
September 7, 2021, were necessary and reasonable.  Taber Decl., ¶25, Ex. 8.  
On or about October 25, 2023, after all briefing was
completed, Wu received a telephone call from Department 85 requesting that
Watson electronically file the complete Appendix for the convenience of the
court and its staff to evaluate the merits of Watson’s Petition for Writ of
Mandate.  The same day, Wu’s office
separated the complete Appendix into nine volumes and filed each the same day.  As a result, Watson incurred e-filing costs
for each volume (which varied in file size), and each of these filing costs
were noted in Watson’s Cost Memorandum as an “Exhibit List.” (Cost Memorandum
(“Cost Mem.”), Attachment 1G, p. 2.).  Wu
Decl., ¶4.
Watson incurred a total of $578.32 for Wu to travel from
Sacramento to the Stanley Mosk Courthouse for trial, comprised of a same-day
roundtrip flight and necessary ground transportation.  These costs are reasonable considering it
avoided staying overnight in a hotel.  Wu
Decl., ¶4.  Wu’s appearance at trial was
necessary to assist lead counsel Taber, especially considering that the City
had two attorneys.  Wu Decl., ¶4.  Watson incurred a separate $19.47 as a cost
for overnighting hearing documents to Wu to be used at the argument.  Wu Decl., ¶5.  
After the mandamus trial, on approximately November 8, 2023,
Watson’s counsel received a phone call from the Department 85 clerk to remove the
Appendix of Exhibits no later than November 13, 2023.  Wu Decl., ¶6.  Watson incurred $109.04 as a cost to remove
the Binders from the courtroom. Wu Decl., ¶6.
Watson has incurred $746.68 in additional costs since filing
its memorandum of costs, including e-filing fees and courtesy copy fees.  Taber Decl., ¶26.  Watson asks that these costs be awarded in
this motion or as part of the fee motion. 
Taber Decl., ¶26.  
 
            D. Analysis
            Respondent
City moves to tax Petitioner Watson’s costs in the amount of $17,590.38.  
 
1. Item 1: Filing Fees
Filing and motion fees are expressly recoverable as costs.  CCP §1033.5(a)(1).  Watson lists $7499.43 in filing fees.  Mem. of Costs, Attachment 1G.  
The City seeks to tax $6974.06 of these filing fees.  It argues that Watson initiated
this litigation in 2019 and dragged it through the Court for five years, filing
amended complaint after amended complaint until one of them was finally
sufficient. While Watson may be the prevailing party on its 4thAC, all
complaints and motions prior to that point were unnecessary.  Flowers Dec., ¶¶ 2-14.  The intent CCP section 1033.5(c)(2) is to
authorize a trial court to disallow recovery of costs, including filing fees,
when it determines the costs were incurred unnecessarily.  Perko's Enterprises, Inc. v. RRNS
Enterprises, (1992) 4 Cal. App. 4th 238, 245. Most of the filing fees in
the Cost Memorandum were unnecessarily incurred by Watson because the City
successfully defended against Watson’s numerous defective complaints and
baseless petition for a preliminary injunction.  Flowers Dec., ¶¶ 2-10. Many of the documents
were filed without leave of court because Watson’s attorneys failed to follow
normal civil procedure.  Id.  Watson filed a 5thAC in violation of the court’s
November 8, 2023 ruling, and made multiple unnecessary filings of the proposed
judgment because Watson refused to meaningfully meet and confer with the City
on an acceptable form of judgment and writ.  Flowers Decl., ¶13.  These costs should be stricken, or
significantly reduced.  Mot. at 7.
Watson defends the reasonableness and necessity of its
filing fees.  It argues that the initial
$435 filing fee for all civil cases is standard, as is the filing fee for
court-required case management conferences and notices of case management
statement.  Watson filed ex parte
applications to publish the Summons, which was required by the validation
statutes.  CCP §861.  Watson’s ex parte application for injunctive
relief, though initially denied, was a reasonable and necessary ex parte
request because the City refused to issue permits for Watson’s project.  Taber Decl., ¶9.  The reservation fee of $513.75 for Watson’s
anticipated motion for summary judgment is also recoverable.  When it became apparent that there would be a
long wait for a trial date, Watson sought to expedite a judicial determination
by a motion for summary judgment.  Taber
Decl., ¶10.  Opp. at 11.
The filing fees related to documents filed in response to
the City’s demurrers are also recoverable.  Watson would have never incurred these filing
fees but for the City’s filings.  The
City challenged Watson’s pleadings four times by way of demurrers and/or
motions to strike.  The same reasoning
applies to filing fees related to Watson’s requests for leave to amend and its
amended pleadings. Watson sought leave to amend when the City started to modify
its taxing scheme or when the City took other actions on Watson’s projects with
pending applications with the City.  Taber
Decl., ¶¶ 11, 12.  To try and save on
costs and fees, Watson had asked the City to stipulate to amend the pleading so
it can avoid bringing a motion for leave to amend.  Taber Decl., ¶17.  Because the City refused to do so, Watson had
no choice but to formally seek leave to amend by noticed motion.  Opp. at 12.
The City cannot credibly challenge the fees that Watson
incurred for filing its motion for writ of mandate and the reply brief.    The
filing fee for the 5thAC of $44.15 was incurred because Watson’s counsel
reasonably understood that the court invited the filing of an amended complaint
based on its November 8, 2023 ruling.  Filing
fees for objections and responses to each parties’ proposed judgment and writ
are recoverable. Watson was ordered to prepare the proposed judgment and writ, and
Watson’s counsel sent a proposed judgment and writ to the City’s attorneys.  With the City’s counsel out of the country and
unwilling to meet and confer while she was vacationing, Watson filed a response
to OSC on December 4, 2023.  Opp. at 13.
With the exception of the filing fee for the 5thAC,
the court would agree that most of the described fees were reasonable and
necessary.  But the City did not merely
challenge reasonableness and necessity; it also challenged that the fees actually
were incurred.  Hence, the City argues
that Watson has submitted insufficient descriptions or dates of the filing fees
to be able to determine which documents were actually filed.  Flowers Dec., ¶14, Ex. A.  It is unclear why there are duplicative
filing fees incurred on top of the filing fee for electronic filing for the
actual document submitted by Watson. 
Watson seeks reservation fees for motions it never filed, such as
$513.75 for a motion for summary judgment. This alone demonstrates that each of
Watson’s purported expenses should be questioned.  By way of example, Watson submitted fees for
filing an Exhibit List eight times, and again multiple duplicative fees. In
addition, Watson seeks $2,130.33 for “Lodging of Appendix of Exhibits ISO
Motion for Writ of Mandate,” which is unlikely to be an actual filing fee.  Because Watson’s filing fees are incredibly
excessive, unreasonable, and unnecessary, $6,974.06 should be taxed, and
stricken.  Flowers Decl., ¶14, Ex.
A.  Mot. at 7-8.
As the City argues in reply (Reply at 3), Watson was
obligated to respond to this challenge by presenting evidence that the filing
fees were actually incurred.  Yet, Watson
fails to provide any invoices or actual documentation for its claimed costs with
the exception of one invoice for $109.  Once
the costs have been put in issue via a motion to tax costs, supporting
documentation must be submitted.  Jones
v. Dumrichob, supra, 63 Cal. App. 4th at 1267 (citing Butte, supra,
215 Cal.App.3d at 308).  Watson’s failure
to justify its cost memorandum via supporting documentation, such as bills or
invoices, is tantamount to a concession that the costs were not incurred.  
The supporting Taber and Wu declarations do not substantiate
that the costs were actually incurred either, except that Wu’s declaration
supports the incurrence of costs to electronically file the complete Appendix
for the convenience of the court and its staff.   Watson incurred e-filing costs for each
volume (which varied in file size), and each of these filing costs were noted
in Watson’s Cost Memorandum as an “Exhibit List.” Cost Mem., Attachment 1G, p.
2.).  Wu Decl., ¶4.  While there is no supporting invoice, Wu at
least explains that the cost of filing the “Exhibit Lists” was incurred.
 Despite the court’s
knowledge of the case and the fact that some or most of these filing fees obviously
must have been occurred, the court cannot do Watson’s job for it.  The City’s motion to tax $6,974.06 in filing
fees is granted, minus the eight Exhibit List costs.
 
2. Item 4: Deposition Costs
The taking and transcribing of necessary depositions are
expressly recoverable as costs.  CCP
§1033.5(a)(3)(A).  Watson lists $745 in
deposition costs.  Mem. of Costs,
Attachment 1G.  
The City points out that Watson seeks
reimbursement for a deposition that was not taken.  Flowers Decl., ¶¶ 5-6.  Any deposition in this writ of mandate case would
not have been necessary to the litigation.  CCP §1033.5(a)(3).  Watson did not rely on or submit any of James
Nguyen’s supposed deposition testimony in support of its 4thAC.  Nor was the deposition testimony included in
any one of Watson’s eight Exhibit Lists, rendering the deposition and any
copies of such unnecessary and unreasonable under CCP section 1033.5(a)(3).  Mot. at 8-9.
Watson responds that the City refused to appear at the
deposition because it viewed the deposition to be unreasonable and unnecessary.
 Yet, the court determines whether the
cost was reasonably incurred from the pretrial vantage point of the litigant
who does not know what will happen at trial.  Nelson v. Anderson, (1999) 7
Cal.App.4th 111, 132. In 2021, it was necessary for Watson to notice Mr. Nguyen’s
deposition as he was and remains listed on the City’s website as the project
manager and the “CFD No. 2018-01 Contact.”  Taber Decl., ¶6.  In fact, Mr. Nguyen submitted a declaration in
support of the City’s opposition to a writ of mandate.  Id.  It makes no difference that the deposition was
cancelled.  CCP section 1033.5(a)(3)(A) concerns
completed depositions, but a certificate of non-appearance is the equivalent of
a deposition transcript where the witness failed to appear and a late
cancellation fee to a reporter may likewise be recorded as an expense related
to a deposition.  Garcia
v. Tempur-Pedic North America, LLC, (2024) 98 Cal.App.5th 819, 825.  Therefore, Watson is entitled to recover the
reasonable amount of $745 as deposition fee. 
Opp. at 15.
As the City correctly replies, Watson fails to provide any
evidence of a reporter’s late cancellation fee. 
Taber describes how she noticed Mr. Nguyen’s deposition and why, but she
does not state that Watson incurred a $745 cancellation fee or provide an
invoice for such fee.  Taber Decl., ¶6.  Reply at 6.[1]
The $745 deposition cancellation fee is taxed.
 
3. Item 5: Service of Process Fees
Service of process fees by a public officer, process server,
or by publication are expressly recoverable as costs.  CCP §1033.5(a)(4).  Watson lists $4,042.23 in service of process costs.  Mem. of Costs, Attachment 5D.  
The City argues that Watson claims $4,042.23 in service of
process fees in a case which has largely utilized email for service of
documents since its inception.  Flowers
Decl., ¶3.   These service of process fees were not
reasonably and necessarily incurred.  Whether
and in what amount the expenses for service of process are allowed depends upon
who served the process and the amount actually incurred or is the lesser of the
sum actually incurred.  CCP §1033.5(a)(4)(D).    Other
than the two Summons served via publication (Attachment 5(D) g, i), the
Memorandum of Costs does not state how the documents were served, by whom, and
why service on the City or City’s attorneys other than by email was reasonable
and necessary. CCP §1033.5(c)(2).  The
random amounts of the expenses themselves (e.g., $3.70, $7.26)
demonstrate that these fees were not incurred to serve documents on the City or
its attorneys. Therefore, the Memorandum of Costs is insufficient to establish
that $4,042.23 in service process fees were reasonable and necessary.  Mot. at 9.
Watson responds that it was required by the validation
statutes (CCP §861) and the court’s order to publish the summons for the FAC
and SAC.  Taber Decl., Exs. 4, 6.  Therefore, these costs ($1,820.00 and
$1,823.50) were reasonable and necessary.  The remainder of the costs are properly
labeled with the person or entity served, who received service, date of
service, and the cost of service and are reasonable on their face. The City’s only
argument is that the parties agreed to service by email in or around June 2019.
Notwithstanding the parties’ agreement for email service, Watson was required
and entitled to serve process in accordance with the rules of CCP sections
415.010, et seq. and the validation statutes. As such, Watson is entitled to
the entire amount identified in the Memorandum of Costs.  Opp. at 8.
Unlike other costs, the City does not dispute that the  listed service of process fees were actually
incurred.  This is lucky for Watson
because the Taber declaration merely states that the court authorized
publication (Taber Decl., Exs. 4, 6) and nowhere is there any evidence that
Watson actually incurred $1,820.00 and $1,823.50 as the cost of
publication.  Similarly, the Taber
declaration does not provide invoices or support for any of the other service
fees.  
Although the City disputes this fact (Reply at 8), the court
agrees that Watson is entitled to its publication costs.   The
remainder of the service costs are labeled by the person or entity served, who
received service, date of service, and the cost of service, but Watson fails to
address the City’s point who served the process (public officer, a registered
process server, or by publication), which is required for a cost to be
recoverable.  CCP §1033.5(a)(4).  See Reply at 8.  More important, Watson provides no reason for
serving the City by means other than electronic service.  The parties agreed to electronic service, which
also is required by the Presiding Judge’s First Amended General Order on
electronic filing and CRC 2.251(c)(3). 
Service on the City by any means other than electronic service was not
reasonable and necessary.  
The $4,042.23 in service of process fees is taxed by $398.73
($4042.23 minus $1820 and $1823.50).
 
4. Item 11: Court Reporter Fees
Court reporter fees
as established by statute are allowable as costs.  CCP §1033.5(a)(11).  Transcripts of court proceedings are not
allowable as costs, except when expressly authorized by law or ordered by the
court.  CCP §1033.5(b)(5).  Watson claim costs of $4,410.00 for
court reporting. Mem. of Costs, Attachment 12C.  
The City argues that each of Attachment 12C’s entries is
insufficiently described.  No invoices
were provided, and it is unclear whether Watson seeks both court reporting fees
and transcripts. Watson is not entitled to recover transcripts of court
proceedings not ordered by the court. 
CCP §1033.5(b)(5).  Absent
Watson’s production of itemized invoices of fees actually paid, these amounts
should be taxed. Moreover, the amounts requested for items 12(c) and (d) in
Attachment 12C appear excessive.  Mot. at
10.
Watson responds that it incurred court reporting fees for six
hearings: Watson’s preliminary injunction motion (November 11, 2021), the
City’s demurrers (January 10 and February 15, and March 23, 2022), the mandamus
trial (November 2, 2023), and the OSC re: Judgment on December 12, 2023).  The Memorandum of Costs identified the court
reporting agency/court reporter, the hearing date, and the fees incurred. This
information sufficiently apprises the City regarding which hearings were
covered by a court reporter.  Without any
factual support, the City speculates that these fees include transcripts. They
do not. Watson never ordered transcripts in conjunction with the trial court
proceedings.  Taber Decl., ¶24.  Further, now that the City has appealed,
several of the transcripts are necessary for appellate review.  Therefore, Watson is entitled to recover
$4,410.00 in court reporting costs.  Opp.
at 16.
The City replies that Watson fails once again to
substantiate the court reporter fees with any actual evidence it incurred these
fees.  In addition, the fees are highly
speculative, because Watson asserts it occurred $525 in fees for a hearing on
“1/10/2022.” Mem. of Costs Worksheet, p. 3.  No hearing was ever held on that date.  On January 7, 2022, the City filed and serve
Watson with a notice of the continued hearing date.  Therefore, no court reporters fee would have
ever been incurred, and Watson should have justified each of the court reporter
fees claimed.  Reply at 10.
The court agrees that Watson fails to substantiate the court
reporter fees with bills or documentation showing that the costs were
incurred.  The $4,410 for court reporter
fees is taxed.
 
5. Item 16: Other Claimed Fees
In Item 16, the Memorandum of Costs seeks $1,419.09 in costs.  The City contends that these costs are
explicitly prohibited by statute.  Ladas,
supra, 19 Cal.App.4th at 774.  
 
a. Research Expense
The City argues that Watson claimed $407 in expenses for
“Westlaw Computer Research” that cannot be recovered.  CCP section 1033.5(b)(2) precludes recovery
of investigation expenses. “Fees for legal research, computer or otherwise, may
not be recovered under section 1033.5.”  Ladas,
supra, 19 Cal.App.4th at 761.  Mot. at 10-11.
Watson requests that the court exercise its discretion under
CCP section 1033.5(c)(4) and award Watson its Westlaw Computer Research fees.  The firm did not charge for the majority of
Westlaw costs, only those costs for select documents. These costs are
recoverable since they were reasonably incurred to successfully litigate this
action.  Opp. at 18.
The City correctly replies that “[CCP] section 1033.5,
subdivision (c)(4), does not refer to subdivision (b), but rather permits a
discretionary award only as to “[i]tems not mentioned in this section.”  Seever v. Copley Press, Inc., (2006)
141 Cal.App.4th 1550, 1559.  Thus, the
court has no discretion to award costs for items expressly disallowed by CCP
section 1033.5(b).  Reply at 9.  The $407 in Westlaw research is taxed.
 
b. Travel Expenses
The City argues that Watson seeks $612.32 in travel expenses
not permitted by statute. CCP section 1033.5(a)(3) only authorizes travel
expenses to attend depositions. “Routine expenses for local travel by attorneys
or other firm employees are not reasonably necessary to the conduct of
litigation.”  Ladas, supra,
19 Cal.App.4th at 775-76. This prohibition includes travel and
parking fees.   On a related issue, Watson
seeks to recover $19.47 in “mailing costs,” but postage is expressly prohibited
by CCP section 1033.5(b)(3)(“[T]he following items are not allowable as
costs…postage.”).  Mot. at 11.
Watson states that, in preparation for the mandamus trial,
Watson incurred a sum total of $597.79.  Of
this amount, attorney Wu incurred $578.32 for travel from Sacramento to the Stanley
Mosk Courthouse, which comprised of a same-day roundtrip flight and necessary
ground transportation. Wu Decl., ¶ 4. The cost is exceptionally reasonable because
Wu opted for a same-day roundtrip flight as opposed to staying overnight in a
hotel.  Id.  Wu’s attendance at the trial was necessary to
assist lead counsel Taber with argument. 
See Page v. Something Weird Video, (C.D. Cal., Dec. 3,
1996) 960 F.Supp. 1438, 1447 (granting travel expenses to attend hearing under CCP
section 1033.5); Chaaban v. Wet Seal, Inc., (2012) 203 Cal.App.4th 49,
59-60 (travel expenses are recoverable).  Prior to flying down for the hearing, Watson
incurred a $19.47 cost to overnight trial documents to Wu to be used at
argument.  Wu Decl., ¶5.  All such costs and reasonable and necessary to
the successful outcome of this litigation. 
Opp. at 17. 
The City’s argument is not well taken.  Travel expenses to trial are not authorized
by CCP section 1033.5(a)(3), but they are not denied by CCP section 1033.5(b)
either.  Therefore, they are subject to
the court’s discretion pursuant to CCP section 1033.5(c).  Wu’s travel expenses were reasonable and
necessary.  However, the $19.47 for
overnight delivery of documents to Wu is proscribed as a “postage charge” under
CCP section 1033.5(b)(3).  Even if not
proscribed, it was not reasonable and necessary and is taxed.
 
c. Remote Appearances
Watson seeks $217 in remote appearance fees via CourtCall
and LA CourtConnect.  The City argues
that they should be stricken because they are not recoverable by statute.  Mot. at 11.
Watson acknowledges that the court now permits remote
appearances but argues that remote appearances were not free of charge before
the COVID-19 pandemic.  Parties were
either to appear in-person or pay for remote appearances through CourtCall or
CourtConnect.  Even during the COVID-19
pandemic, free CourtConnect was not available until after September 7, 2021.  Taber Decl., ¶ 25, Ex. 8.  Therefore, Watson’s court appearance fees (all
of which were incurred prior to September 7, 2021) in the Cost Memorandum were
necessary and reasonably incurred.  Taber
Decl., ¶25.  Opp. at 16-17.
The court agrees.  The
$217 in remote appearance fees is not taxed. 
CCP §1033.5(c).
 
d. Document Retrieval
Watson seeks $15.80 in document retrieval costs.  The City argues that these costs are not
permitted by statute and are therefore not recoverable. Nor are they reasonable
and necessary, rather than merely convenient or beneficial.  CCP §1033.5(c)(2).  Mot. at 11.
Watson fails to support the $15.80 document retrieval cost
and it is taxed.
 
e. Miscellaneous Fees
The City argues that Watson seeks to recover $15 and $13 in
vague “court appearance fee[s]” and $109 in undefined “court costs.” These fees
are insufficiently described to be legitimate. Watson must show that they are reasonable
or necessary, or otherwise be stricken. 
Mot. at 11.
Watson responds that, on or about November 8, 2023, Wu
received a phone call from the Department 85 to arrange for the Appendix of
Exhibits to be removed by no later than November 13, 2023.  Wu Decl., ¶6. 
Wu made arrangements to remove the Appendix of Exhibits the following
day, and Watson reasonably and necessarily incurred $109 to do so.  Hence, this cost is recoverable.  Ladas, supra, 19 Cal.App.4th at
776 (charges for transporting exhibits to courtroom were reasonable necessary
and recoverable).  Opp. at 17-18.
The court agrees.  The
$109 cost is not taxed.  CCP
§1033.5(c).  The other $15 and $13
charges are unsupported and are taxed.[2]
            E. Conclusion
            The motion to tax costs is granted
in significant part.  The City’s counsel
is ordered to calculate the taxed costs, confer with Watson’s counsel as to the
accuracy of that number, and inform the Department 85 clerk for inclusion in
the judgment.
