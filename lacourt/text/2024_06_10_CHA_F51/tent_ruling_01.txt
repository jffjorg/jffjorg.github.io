BACKGROUND
 
 
On 12/5/23, Cross-Complainant served Cross-Defendant with his
first set of Form Interrogatories, RFPs, and Special Interrogatories. (Ex. A to
Decl. of Peter H. Crossin.) On 1/8/24, Cross-Defendant served Cross-Complainant
with his responses thereto. (Ex. B to Crossin Decl.)
 
On 4/5/24, Cross-Complainant filed the instant motions to
compel Cross-Defendant’s further responses to his first set of Form
Interrogatories, RFPs; and Special Interrogatories. On 5/29/24, Cross-Defendant
filed its oppositions. On 6/3/24, Cross-Complainant filed his replies.
 
ANALYSIS
 
“The party to whom interrogatories have been propounded
shall respond in writing under oath separately to each interrogatory by any of
the following: (1) An answer containing the information sought to be
discovered; (2) An exercise of the party’s option to produce writings; or (3)
An objection to the particular interrogatory.” (Code Civ Proc. § 2030.210,
subd. (a).)
 
“Each answer in a response to interrogatories shall be as
complete and straightforward as the information reasonably available to the
responding party permits.” (Code Civ Proc. § 2030.220.) “If an objection is
made to an interrogatory or to a part of an interrogatory, the specific ground
for the objection shall be set forth clearly in the response. If an objection
is based on a claim of privilege, the particular privilege invoked shall be
clearly stated.” (Code Civ Proc. § 2030.240, subd. (b).)
 
A propounding party may move
for an order compelling further responses to interrogatories if any of the
following apply: “(1) An answer to a particular interrogatory is evasive or
incomplete; (2) An exercise of the option to produce documents under Section
2030.230 is unwarranted or the required specification of those documents is
inadequate; or (3) An objection to an interrogatory is without merit or too
general.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.300, subd. (a).)
 
California law requires a responding party to respond to each
request for production of documents with either a statement of compliance, a
representation that the party lacks the ability to comply, or an objection to
the demand. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.210, subd. (a).)
 
If the response includes an
objection to the demand in part, it must also include a statement of compliance
or noncompliance as set forth above. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.240, subd. (a).)
Additionally, the response must (1) identify the particular document that falls
within the category of the request to which the objection is being made, and
(2) expressly set forth the extent of, and specific ground for, the objection.
(Id., subd. (b).)¿A propounding party may move for an order compelling
further response to a discovery request if it decides that: “(1) A statement of
compliance with the demand is incomplete”; “(2) A representation of inability
to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive”; or “(3) An objection in the
response is without merit or too general.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.310, subd.
(a).)¿
 
A.   
Meet and Confer
 
A motion to compel further
discovery responses must be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration stating “facts showing a reasonable and good faith attempt at an
informal resolution of each issue presented by the motion.” (Code Civ. Proc. §§
2030.300, subd. (b)(1); 2031.310, subd. (b)(2); 2016.040.) 
 
Here, Cross-Complainant’s
counsel declares that on 2/7/24, he sent Cross-Defendant’s counsel a meet and
confer letter regarding the issues raised in the instant motions. (Crossin Decl. ¶ 2.) Counsel for the parties met and conferred on
2/16/24, but were unable to informally resolve the issues. (Ibid.) Based
on the foregoing, the Court finds that counsel has satisfied the meet and
confer requirements under Code of Civil Procedure sections 2031.300,
subdivision (b)(1) and 2031.310, subdivision (b)(2).
 
B.     Cross-Defendant’s
Objections
 
Cross-Complainant asserts that “the discovery [at
issue] was focused directly on the Amazon truck’s identification, driver, and
its whereabouts and purpose at the subject location on the date of the
accident.” (Rog. Mot. 5:7–9.) Cross-Complainant contends that the instant
motions should be granted because Cross-Defendant served objection-only
responses to the subject discovery requests, in reliance “on meritless
relevance objections without explanation, despite the Requests all plainly
calling for specific information that tends to prove Grupp’s claims or disprove
Amazon’s defenses to his claims.” (Id. at 8:7–9.)
 
Cross-Defendant
argues in opposition that “Amazon’s objections to discovery were made to
preserve them.” (Opp. 3:17–18.) “Based on the lack of information in the
operative pleading, Amazon had no information to obtain the necessary
information for its responses to the [discovery requests] … served.” (Id.
at 4:2–4.) “Amazon will provide amended responses once the case is at issue,
once it has the information necessary to respond to the requests, and once
there are legally sufficient facts alleged against it to support its
involvement in the case.” (Id. at 4:24–27.)
 
However, as
Cross-Complainant notes, “Amazon, having made an appearance in this action, is
obligated to make all good faith efforts – from all available sources – to
respond to Grupp’s discovery. It clearly has not.” (Rog. Reply 2:25–27.) “Pleading
deficiencies generally do not affect either party’s right to conduct discovery.”
(Mattco Forge, Inc. v. Arthur Young & Co. (1990) 223 Cal.App.3d 1429,
1436, fn.3, citing Budget Finance Plan v. Superior Court (1973) 34
Cal.App.3d 794, 798.) Here, “Amazon is arguing that it cannot respond to the
subject discovery because Grupp’s cross-complaint fails to state facts to
support a cause of action against Amazon. Whether or not this is true, it
nevertheless does not permit Amazon to ignore the discovery without making a
single reasonable good faith effort to obtain the information [and documents]
from sources within its possession, custody, or control.” (Rog. Reply 4:15–19.)

 
The Court
agrees with Cross-Complainant, the Court finds that Cross-Defendant’s
objections to the subject discovery requests, primarily that it lacks the
information necessary to respond to the requests, are without merit. As
Cross-Complainant observes, the subject requests contain “information
concerning the positioning of Amazon’s truck in the context of the subject
accident scene …, including the date and time of the accident, the location of
the collision, the positioning of the Amazon delivery truck, and the parties’
testimony regarding the presence of the truck.” (Id. at 3:1–5.)
Moreover, it is undisputed that Cross-Complainant is entitled to discovery of
the matters outlined in the subject requests. (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2030.020,
subd. (b); 2031.020, sub. (b).) Accordingly, the Court grants the instant
motions, and orders Cross-Defendant to make a good-faith effort to provide
substantive responses to the subject discovery requests.
 
C.    Monetary
Sanctions
 
“The court shall impose a monetary sanction … against
any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to
compel a response to interrogatories [or RFPs], unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc. §
2030.290, subd. (c); Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.310, subd. (h).) Additionally, “the
court may impose a monetary sanction ordering that one engaging in the misuse
of the discovery process, or any attorney advising that conduct, or both pay
the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result
of that conduct.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.030, subd. (a).)
 
Here, Cross-Complainant requests a total combined sum of $3,495.00
in monetary sanctions against Plaintiff and his counsel,
which encompasses (1) 6.5 hours of Cross-Complainant’s attorney’s time spent preparing
the instant motions; and (2) an anticipated 7 hours reviewing Cross-Defendant’s
opposition and preparing a reply, at counsel’s hourly billing rate of $250.00 per
hour. (Crossin Decl. ¶ 7.) Cross-Complainant also seeks to recover $60.00 in
filing fees per motion. (Ibid.) In granting the instant motions, the
Court finds it reasonable to award Cross-Complainant monetary sanctions in the
amount of $1060.00 against Cross-Defendant and
its counsel.
CONCLUSION
 
The motions are granted. Cross-Defendant is ordered to serve
further code-compliant responses to the subject discovery requests, within 30
days. The Court imposes sanctions against Cross-Defendant and its counsel in
the amount of $1060.00 payable within 30 days.
