And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for leave to file a cross-complaint. The defendant, Brandon Allan Mercer, is seeking to file a cross-complaint for indemnity, contribution, and declaratory relief against the plaintiffs, Henrik Edoyan and Edgar Dallakyan. The plaintiffs argue that the defendant has not provided any new facts that were not known at the time of the answer and that the defendant acted in bad faith by seeking to file the cross-complaint nearly seven months after the answer was filed.

The judge finds that the plaintiffs' opposition is without merit. The judge notes that the defendant is not required to provide new facts to support the motion, and that the court has a policy of liberal construction to avoid forfeiture of causes of action. The judge also finds that the defendant did not act in bad faith by waiting nearly seven months to seek leave to file the cross-complaint.

Therefore, the judge grants the defendant's motion for leave to file a cross-complaint.
