And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling is based on the information presented before the hearing. The plaintiff is seeking to establish a claim of dangerous condition on public property, and the city is asserting contractual defenses and arguing against the enforceability of the clickwrap agreement entered into by the user of the Lime scooter.

The city has dismissed ASM Global, and it is not contesting its ownership and control of the driveway where the incident occurred. The city also does not contest that the jagged lip of the asphalt patch was a dangerous condition.

The judge notes that the plaintiff must prove six elements to establish a claim of dangerous condition on public property, including that the defendant owned or controlled the property, that the property was in a dangerous condition, and that the plaintiff was harmed.

The city has filed its First Amended Answer, which sets forth its contractual defenses, and the judge is considering whether these defenses should be considered in the context of the plaintiff's claim.

The judge also notes that the clickwrap agreement is a type of agreement in which an internet user accepts a website's terms of use by clicking an "I agree" or "I accept" button, and that courts generally find such agreements to be enforceable. However, the judge is considering whether the clickwrap agreement in this case is enforceable.
