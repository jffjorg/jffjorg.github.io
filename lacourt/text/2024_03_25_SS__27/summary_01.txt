And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendants in this case, The Decurion Corporation, have moved to compel the plaintiff, Patricia Ann Venti, to undergo an independent medical examination (IME) to assess the extent of her alleged injuries from a trip and fall accident. The plaintiff has failed to respond to the defendants' requests for an IME, despite numerous attempts by the defendants to contact her. The court finds that the defendants have fulfilled their meet and confer obligations and that there is good cause for the IME. The court grants the defendants' motion to compel the IME and orders the plaintiff to attend the examination within 20 days of the date of the ruling. Additionally, the court awards the defendants sanctions in the amount of $1,500 due to the plaintiff's failure to respond to the IME notice and her counsel's failure to withdraw the motion.
