And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling grants the defendant's motion to strike punitive damages with leave to amend. The court finds that the plaintiff's allegations of malice and oppressive conduct are conclusory and lack specificity. The defendant, Jhonatan Aleman, allegedly sexually assaulted the plaintiff, Jane Doe, during a sports massage therapy session. The plaintiff's complaint alleges that the defendant's conduct was intentional and despicable, but the court finds that the allegations are vague and do not provide sufficient evidence to support the request for punitive damages. The court grants the defendant's motion to strike the allegations related to punitive damages, but allows the plaintiff to amend the complaint to provide more specific facts to support the claim.
