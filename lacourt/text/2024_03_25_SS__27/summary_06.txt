Here is a summary in English text of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has denied the Plaintiff's motion for leave to file a second amended complaint. The Plaintiff had previously filed a motion for leave to file a second amended complaint on December 5, 2023, but it was denied on January 10, 2024 due to procedural defects. The Plaintiff then filed a second motion for leave on March 1, 2024, which was served on the Defendants through electronic transmission. However, the Defendants argue that the motion is untimely because it was not served 18 court days before the hearing, as required by CCP ยง 1005(b) and CCP ยง 1010.6(a)(3)(B). The Judge agrees with the Defendants and cites Cole v. Superior Court (2022) 87 Cal.App.5th 84, 87, which held that service by electronic transmission extends the notice period by two court days. Therefore, the Plaintiff's motion is denied due to procedural defects.
