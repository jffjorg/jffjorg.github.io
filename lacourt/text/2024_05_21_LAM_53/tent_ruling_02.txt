  Order RE:
 
plaintiff and cross-defendant’s motion to
  strike answer and cross-complaint
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Plaintiff and cross-defendant
Eduardo Luna  
 
RESPONDING PARTIES:    Defendants BJD Services, LLC, Dawn
Kuykendall, Jerilyn Rivetti Kuykendall, Brian McWilliams, Rodney Owens, Villa
Patrician Home Owner’s Association Inc., and Villa Patrician Home Owner’s
Association Inc. 
Motion to Strike Answer and Cross-Complaint
The court
considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers filed in connection with
this motion, and the “Notice of Corporate Revivor for Villa Patrician Home
Owner’s Association Inc.” filed on May 8, 2024.
REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
The court grants plaintiff and
cross-defendant Eduardo Luna’s requests for judicial notice as to Exhibits
1-4.  (Evid. Code, § 452, subd. (c);
Eisen v. Tavangarian (2019) 36 Cal.App.5th 626, 641, n. 12 [taking
judicial notice of recorded CC&Rs].) 
 
 
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff and cross-defendant Eduardo Luna (“Luna”) moves the court
for an order striking (1) the answer filed by Villa Patrician Home Owner’s Association,
Inc. (“Villa HOA”), (2) the Cross-Complaint filed by Villa HOA, and (3) the
Cross-Complaint filed by Villa Patrician Homeowner’s Association, Inc.,
incorporated November 30, 2022 (“Villa HOA 2”).[1]
 Luna filed the pending motion to strike on
May 16, 2023, moving for relief on the grounds that (1) Villa HOA is a
suspended California business entity and therefore cannot defend itself in this
action, and (2) Villa HOA 2 is not authorized to act pursuant to the subject
CC&Rs, such that it “has no basis to sue for unpaid fees and
assessments.”  (Notice of Mot., ¶¶ 1-2.) 
First,
the court denies Luna’s motion to strike the answer filed by Villa HOA.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 436.)
The court acknowledges that the judicially noticed matters filed by
Luna with his moving papers establish that Villa HOA was a suspended entity and
therefore was unable to defend itself in this action.  (RJN Exs. 2, 3 [Villa HOA has status of “Suspended
– FTB”]; Tabarrejo
v. Superior Court (2014)
232 Cal.App.4th 849, 861 [“a corporation that has had its powers suspended
‘lacks legal capacity to prosecute or defend a civil action during its suspension’”].)
However, on May 8, 2024, Villa HOA filed a “Notice of Corporate Revivor for
Villa Patrician Home Owner’s Association Inc.,” in which Villa HOA (1) states
that it has revived its corporate status, and (2) attaches a document from the
California Secretary of State website, which establishes that Villa HOA’s
filing status has been updated to “Active.” 
(May 8, 2024 Notice, Ex. 1, p. 1.) 
The court takes judicial notice of the document from the California
Secretary of State website.  (Evid. Code,
§ 452, subd. (c).) 
Thus,
the court finds that the judicially noticed matters establish that Villa HOA is
no longer a suspended corporation and therefore may defend itself in this
action.  (Tabarrejo, supra,
232 Cal.App.4th at p. 861.) 
Second,
the court denies Luna’s motion to strike the Cross-Complaint filed by Villa HOA
because, as set forth above, Villa HOA is no longer a suspended corporation and
therefore may prosecute a civil action.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 436; Tabarrejo, supra, 232 Cal.App.4th at p.
861; May 8, 2024 Notice, Ex. 1, p. 1.)
Third,
the court denies Luna’s motion to strike the Cross-Complaint filed by Villa HOA
2 because it appears to be directed to a superseded pleading and therefore is
moot. 
As
set forth above, Luna filed this motion on May 16, 2023, and therefore is
directed to the Cross-Complaint that was filed by Villa HOA 2 on March 17,
2023.  On November 21, 2023 (i.e., after
Luna filed this motion), the court issued an order (1) sustaining Luna’s
demurrer to, inter alia, the first cause of action for breach of
contract asserted by the Homeowner’s Association[2] in the
Cross-Complaint, and (2) granting the Homeowner’s Association 20 days leave to
file a First Amended Cross-Complaint. 
(Nov. 21, 2023 Order, p. 4:1-7.) 
The cross-complainants did not file with the court a First Amended
Cross-Complaint.  However, it appears
that the cross-complainants have served on Luna a First Amended
Cross-Complaint.  Specifically, the court
notes that Luna filed, on March 11, 2024, his “Demurrer to First Amended
Cross-Complaint.”  (Mar. 11, 2024
Demurrer, p. 2:1-5 [stating that Luna is “schedul [ing] his demurrer to the
First Amended Cross-Complaint”].)  Thus,
it appears that Villa HOA 2 served on Luna its First Amended Cross-Complaint
but inadvertently failed to file that pleading with the court. 
Because
it appears to the court that Villa HOA 2 has served and intended to file an
amended cross-complaint, the court finds that Luna’s motion to strike is
directed to a superseded pleading and, therefore, is moot.  (State Compensation Ins. Fund v. Superior
Court (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 1124, 1131 [“Because there is but one
complaint [or cross-complaint] in a civil action [citation], the filing of an
amended complaint [or cross-complaint] moots a motion directed to a prior
complaint [or cross-complaint]” [internal citation omitted].)  The
court denies Luna’s motion to strike without prejudice to Luna’s filing a
motion directed to the operative cross-complaint. 
ORDER
            The court denies plaintiff and
cross-defendant Eduardo Luna’s motion to strike answer and cross-complaint.
            The court orders cross-complainants
Villa Patrician Homeowner’s Association, Inc., Dawn Kuykendall, and Rodney
Owens to file with the court the First Amended Cross-Complaint served on
plaintiff and cross-defendant Eduardo Luna within 5 days of the date of this
order. 
            The court orders defendant Villa
Patrician Homeowner’s Association, Inc. to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
