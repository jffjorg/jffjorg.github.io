[1] There
are two entities involved in this action that share the name Villa Patrician
Homeowner’s Association.  Luna first
named as a defendant in the Complaint “Villa Patrician Home Owner’s Association
Inc., a suspended California Corporation,” i.e., Villa HOA.  (Compl., ¶ 3.)  Thereafter, on December 30, 2022, Luna filed
an “Amendment to Complaint,” amending the Complaint by substituting “Villa
Patrician Home Owner’s Association, Inc., established 11/30/2022 file No.
5354171,” i.e., Villa HOA 2, for the fictitious name Doe 1.  (Dec. 30, 2022 Amendment to Compl., p. 1.)

The Cross-Complaint is unclear as to which entity alleged this cause of action,
but it appears to identify Villa HOA 2 as the cross-complainant.  (Cross-Compl., p. 1:2 [identifying “Villa
Patrician Homeowner’s Association Inc.” as cross-complainant].)
