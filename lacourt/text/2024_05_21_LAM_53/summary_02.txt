And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has denied plaintiff and cross-defendant Eduardo Luna's motion to strike the answer and cross-complaint filed by Villa Patrician Home Owner's Association, Inc. and Villa Patrician Homeowner's Association, Inc. Villa HOA had previously been a suspended corporation and therefore unable to defend itself in this action. However, on May 8, 2024, Villa HOA filed a "Notice of Corporate Revivor" reviving its corporate status. The court took judicial notice of the document from the California Secretary of State website and found that Villa HOA is no longer a suspended corporation and therefore may defend itself in this action. The court also denied the motion to strike the Cross-Complaint filed by Villa HOA 2 because it appears to be directed to a superseded pleading and is therefore moot.
