Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This tentative ruling addresses the unclear identity of the defendant in the Cross-Complaint. The Cross-Complaint identifies Villa Patrician Homeowner's Association, Inc. as the cross-complainant, but it is unclear whether this refers to Villa HOA or Villa HOA 2. The judge intends to clarify this issue. The ruling is based on the Amendment to Complaint filed on December 30, 2022, which substitutes Villa HOA 2 for the fictitious name Doe 1. The judge will consider this information in making a final ruling.
