  Order RE:
 
plaintiff’s motion to compel answers to form
  interrogatories
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Plaintiff Orlando Garcia         
 
RESPONDING PARTIES:    Unopposed
Motion to Compel Answers to Form Interrogatories
The court considered
the moving papers filed in connection with this motion.  No opposition papers were filed. 
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff Orlando Garcia (“Plaintiff”) moves the court for an order
(1) compelling defendants Burton Steiger and Adrianne Steiger (“Defendants”) to
serve full and complete answers, without objections, to Plaintiff’s Form
Interrogatories, Set One, and (2) awarding monetary sanctions in favor of
Plaintiff and against Defendants in the amount of $1,660.
If
a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely response,
the propounding party may move for an order compelling response to the
interrogatories.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (b).)¿ 
Plaintiff served Defendants, separately, with Plaintiff’s Form
Interrogatories, Set One, by mail on May 2, 2023.  (Ramos Decl., Exs. A [Form Interrogatories],
B [Proof of Service of Form Interrogatories – General – Set One “(Propounded on
Defendants Burton Steiger Adrianne Steiger)”].)  Defendants did not serve timely responses and
had not served responses to this discovery as of the date that Plaintiff filed
this motion.  (Mot., p. 1:22-24.)  Defendants did not file an opposition or
other evidence with the court establishing that responses have since been
served. 
Thus, the court grants Plaintiff’s motion to compel Defendants’ answers
to Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatories, Set One. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (b).)  
The court grants Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd.
(c).)  The court finds that $860 ((2
hours x $400 hourly rate) + $60 filing fee) is a reasonable amount of sanctions
to impose against Defendants in connection with this motion.  (Ramos Decl., ¶ 6.) 
ORDER
            The court grants plaintiff Orlando
Garcia’s motion to compel answers to form interrogatories, set one.
            Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 2030.290, the court orders defendants Burton Steiger and Adrianne
Steiger to serve full and complete verified answers, without objections, to plaintiff
Orlando Garcia’s Form Interrogatories, Set One, that comply with Code of Civil
Procedure sections 2030.220-2030.250, within 20 days of the date of service of
this order. 
            The court orders defendants Burton
Steiger and Adrianne Steiger to pay sanctions to plaintiff Orlando Garcia in
the amount of $860 within 30 days of the date of service of this order. 
            The court orders plaintiff Orlando
Garcia to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
DATED:  May 21, 2024
