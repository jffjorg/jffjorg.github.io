```

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment, finding that the plaintiff did not establish the elements of medical negligence. The plaintiff alleged that the defendants were negligent in their treatment of him, but the defendants presented expert testimony that their treatment complied with the standard of care. The court found that the plaintiff did not provide any evidence to contradict the defendants' expert testimony, and therefore, the plaintiff did not meet his burden to show a triable issue of material fact. The court also found that the plaintiff did not establish the elements of breach of contract and bad faith.
