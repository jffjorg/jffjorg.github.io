  - Third Cause of Action - Unjust Enrichment: The cause of action is based on the same underlying facts as the causes of action for fraud and breach of contract.
  - Fourth Cause of Action - Constructive Trust: A demurrer is not the appropriate vehicle to challenge a portion of a cause of action demanding an improper remedy.
  - Fifth Cause of Action - Unfair Business Practices: The cause of action fails because it is based on the same facts as the causes of action for fraud and breach of contract.
