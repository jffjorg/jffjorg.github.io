petition for writ of mandate to compel
  inspection and copying of corporate records



 
BACKGROUND
A.   
O
etition Allegations 
On December 26, 2023, Petitioner
Janakkumar Dineshchandra Patel (“Petitioner”) filed the Petition for Writ of
Mandate to compel inspection and copying of corporate documents under CCP §
1085 and Corporations Code, § 17704.10 against Respondent Oceans V, LLC
(“Respondent”).  Petitioner alleges that
he is the owner and holder of record of one Class A Membership Unit as defined
in the Operating Agreement for Oceans V, LLC dated June 21, 20216 of Respondent
as a result of having invested $500,000 and paid an administrative fee of
$30,000 pursuant to the terms of a Subscription Agreement executed on November
29, 2016.  Petitioner alleges that he
invested in Respondent in part of his effort to obtain lawful permanent
residence in the United States (i.e., obtain a green card) under the Employment
Based Fifth Preference Immigrant Investor Program (the “EB-5 Program”).  Petitioner alleges that United States
Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”) received his Form I-526
Immigrant Petition by Alien Entrepreneur on March 28, 2017, which USCIS denied;
USCIS then denied Petitioner’s appeal.  
Petitioner alleges that pursuant to the
terms of the Subscription Agreement, he is entitled to the return of his
investment in Respondent and he is worried that Respondent is unable or
unwilling to repay him for the investment. 
He seeks a preemptory writ of mandate to enforce his rights and inspect
Respondent’s books and records.  He
alleges that Respondent has ignored his request for inspection in violation of
his statutory and contractual inspection rights. 
B.    
Relevant Background and Hearing on Calendar 
On February 9, 2024, the petition was
initially set for hearing.  The Court set
a briefing schedule, ordering Petitioner to file an opening brief no later than
March 8, 2024.  Respondent was ordered to
file an opposition no later than April 5, 2024. 
Petitioner was ordered to file a reply no later than April 15,
2024.  The Court ordered courtesy copies
of all papers to be lodged directly with the Court. 
On February 26, 2024, Petitioner filed a
notice of the entry of order on the February 9, 2024 petition hearing.  
No opening brief was filed on March 8,
2024 by Petitioner.  No opposition was
filed.  On April 15, 2024, Petitioner
filed a reply brief. 
CONTINUING THE HEARING ON THE PETITION 
As summarized above, the Court set a
briefing schedule for this matter to be heard by this hearing date of April 26,
2024.  However, Petitioner did not file
an opening brief by March 8, 2024 as ordered by the Court.  Petitioner filed a reply brief on April 15,
2024, arguing that since Respondent did not file an opposition brief, the
Petition should be granted.  
In failing to file an opening brief in
support of the Petition, Petitioner has waived any claims alleged in the
Petition. Petitioner bears the burden of proof and the failure to file an
opening brief means that Petitioner has not met this burden. (See City of South San Francisco v. Board
of Equalization (2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 707, 720 [“in mandate
proceeding brought under Code Civ. Proc. § 1085,
petitioner always bears burden of proof”]; see also South
Orange County Wastewater Authority v. City of Dana Point (2011) 196
Cal.App.4th 1604, 1612 [“Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1085,
review of quasi-legislative actions is limited to an inquiry into whether the
action was arbitrary, capricious or entirely lacking in evidentiary support,
... [and] [t]he petitioner has the burden of proof to show that the decision is
unreasonable or invalid as a matter of law.”] [internal quotations omitted].) 
Further, a statement of facts and
generally evidence are required as components to an opening brief to carry the
petitioner’s burden. (LASC § 3.231, subd. (h)-(i); see also Cal. Rules Court,
Rule 3.1113(a).) The absence of an opening brief argument and evidence may be
an admission that the Petition is not meritorious and may be denied. (See Cal.
Rules Court 3.1113(a).) 
At most, the Court is in receipt of
Petitioner’s initial Petition document and the reply brief.  The Petition consists solely of allegations
and a single exhibit—an Inspection Demand letter dated July 18, 2023 directed
at Respondent.  There is no discussion of
the law in the Petition.  The Petition
also lacks evidentiary support that Petitioner is in fact a Class A Membership
Unit owner and record holder, the terms of the Operating Agreement are not
attached to show that Petitioner has the right to enforce inspection demands or
the procedure for Petitioner to seek such relief, or any showing that
Petitioner’s request for inspection was denied or disregarded.  It is Petitioner’s burden as the petitioning
party to show that he is entitled to the relief he is requesting. 
The Court would be
inclined to deny the petition as Petitioner has taken no further steps to
advance this matter.  However, the Court
will continue the matter once in order to provide Petitioner an opportunity to
file the requisite papers, if Petitioner still seeks the relief requested in
the petition papers.  
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
The hearing on the
petition for writ of mandate will be continued one final time.  The Court sets a briefing schedule for the
petition as follows:

Petitioner’s
     opening brief is to be filed no later than May 15, 2024.
Respondent’s
     opposition brief is to be filed no later than May 24, 2024.
Petitioner’s
     reply brief is to be filed no later than May 31, 2024.  
The hearing
     on the petition shall be scheduled for June 7, 2024. 

Courtesy copies of all papers should be
lodged directly with Department B of the Burbank Courthouse.  
Petitioner shall
provide notice of this order.
