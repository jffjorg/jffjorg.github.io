And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the Plaintiff's motion to compel Defendants' further responses to discovery requests. The Plaintiff alleges that the Defendants breached their contract and failed to make timely payments. The Judge finds that the Plaintiff's requests for production of documents and special interrogatories are not overly broad or burdensome and are reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. The Judge also finds that the Defendants' objections to the requests are not substantiated. The Judge orders the Defendants to provide further responses to the requests and awards the Plaintiff $1,000 in sanctions for the Defendants' failure to comply with discovery requests.
