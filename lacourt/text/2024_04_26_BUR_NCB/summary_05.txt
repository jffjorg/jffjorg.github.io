Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Monique Carmelete Almeida v. Jeffrey Paul Katz. The plaintiff, Monique, moves to quash a subpoena served on MedAmerica Billing Services, Inc. for production of business records. The subpoena is overly broad in time and scope and seeks medical records and billing information that are not relevant to the issues in the case. The judge grants the motion in part and modifies the subpoena to seek only those medical records and billing information that are relevant to Monique's injuries or issues with her neck, shoulders, left wrist, lower back, right knee, and right ankle, for the period of May 28, 2017 (5 years prior to the accident) to the present.
