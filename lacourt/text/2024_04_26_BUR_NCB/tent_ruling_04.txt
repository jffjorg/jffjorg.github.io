On October 2, 2023, Plaintiff named HPO

Relevant
Background and Motion on Calendar
On October 2, 2023, the default of

On October 12, 2023, Plaintiff dismissed
without prejudice Defendant Mike Kirakosian (Doe 2) only from the
complaint.  
On October 30,
2023, the Judgment Pursuant to Stipulation for Entry of Judgment in Favor of
Plaintiff against Defendants was entered between Plaintiff and Defendants Aaron’s
Auto L.L.P. dba Aaron’s Parts & Salvage, Malcolm Kirakosian, and HPO Metal

5.
The Court hereby orders Plaintiff and Defendants to comply with the terms of

(10/30/23
Stipulated Judgment at p.2.)  
            On November 6, 2023, the Writ of
Possession of Real Property was entered. 

On February 15, 2024, HPO Metal Recycling
(“HPO”) filed an application for ex parte order staying execution and for order
shortening time for service of motion to set aside stipulated judgment pursuant
to CCP § 473(b)(d), CCP 1179, and CCP 918. 
That same day, HPO filed a motion to stay the execution of the writ, set
aside the stipulated judgment, to quash any writ of possession/execution, and
allow the Defendant’s answer to be filed.  

On February 20, 2024, Plaintiff filed an
opposition brief to the ex parte application. 

On February 20, 2024, the Court held a
hearing on the ex parte application and scheduled the motion to be heard on
February 26, 2024.  The Court ordered a
stay of execution of the judgment through February 26, 2024 and ordered all
oppositions to be submitted before February 23, 2024.  
On February 26, 2024, the Court held a
hearing on the motion to set aside/vacate the judgment.  The Court denied HPO’s motion to stay the
execution of writ, set aside the stipulated judgment, to quash any writ of
possession/execution, and allow the defendant to answer.  
DISCUSSION

            HPO filed a motion to stay the execution
of writ, set aside the stipulated judgment, to quash any writ of
possession/execution, and allow the defendants to answer on February 15, 2024. 
            The motion was set initially set for
hearing on April 26, 2024.  
            However, based on the February 20,
2024 hearing on the ex parte application, the Court advanced the hearing date
on the motion from April 26, 2024 to February 26, 2024.  
            The motion was heard on February 26,
2024 and was denied by the Court.  
            As this motion was already ruled
upon, the hearing on this motion will be taken off-calendar.  
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
Defendant HPO
Metal Recycling’s motion to stay the execution of writ, set aside the
stipulated judgment, to quash any writ of possession/execution, and allow the
defendant’s answer is taken off-calendar as the Court already denied on the
motion on February 26, 2024.  
            Defendant shall provide notice of
this order.
