And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

**Tentative Ruling**

The court has reviewed the motion to compel further responses to request for production, set one, and has granted the motion as to RPD Nos. 1, 2, 4, 9-11, and 13-14, but subject to the limitation stated in the court's written order. The court has denied the motion as to RPD Nos. 7-8, 12, and 15-31. The defendant is ordered to provide further responses within 20 days of notice of this order. The plaintiff shall give notice of this order.

The court has found that the defendant has made a diligent search and reasonable inquiry in an effort to comply with the requests for production, but has failed to produce responsive documents in some cases. The court has also found that the defendant has no written policies or procedures for evaluating claims under the Act, creating a Service Activity, or evaluating whether a vehicle qualifies for repurchase or replacement under the Act.

The court has ordered the defendant to produce further responses to the requests for production, but has denied the motion as to certain requests that are deemed overly broad or vague. The court has also denied the motion as to requests that seek confidential or privileged information.
