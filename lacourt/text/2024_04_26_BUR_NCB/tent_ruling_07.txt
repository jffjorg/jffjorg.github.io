  Hearing Date:  April 26, 2024
 
 [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
motions to compel discovery responses; requests for sanctions
 



 
There are 5
motions on calendar.  On March 18, 2024, Plaintiff
Northern California Collection Service, Inc. (“Plaintiff”) filed 3 motions to
compel initial responses from Defendant Valley View Congregate Living Inc
(“Defendant”) for: (1) Form Interrogatories (“FROG”), set one; (2) Special
Interrogatories (“SROG”), set one; and (3) Requests for Production of Documents
(“RPD”), set one.  Plaintiff also filed:
(4) a motion for order to deem the matters admitted in its Requests for
Admissions (“RFA”), set one; and (5) a motion for order to deem the documents
genuine in its RFA.  On April 19, 2024,
Plaintiff filed a notice of no opposition stating that it did not receive an
opposition brief to the motions.  
On January 12,
2024, Plaintiff served on Defendant the discovery requests, such that responses
were due by February 19, 2024.  Plaintiff
states that it provided Defendant with an extension such that responses were
due by March 11, 2024.  As of the filing
of the motions, Plaintiff states that it has not received responses from Defendant.  
Plaintiff’s unopposed motions
to compel responses to the FROG, SROG, and RPD are granted pursuant to CCP §§ 2030.290
and 2031.300.  Defendant is ordered to
provide verified responses to Plaintiff’s discovery requests, without
objections, within 20 days of notice of this order.  
Plaintiff’s unopposed motion
for an order deeming the RFAs admitted and to deem the documents genuine is
granted, pursuant to CCP § 2033.280.  
Plaintiff requests
sanctions against Defendant and its attorney.  Plaintiff seeks $922.50 for each motion (=
[$375/hour x 11.5 hours, divided by 5 motions] = $862.50, plus $60 filing
fee).  The requests are granted in the
reasonable amount of $1,500 total for the motions, plus $300 in filing fees, as
these are relatively simple and identical motions to compel initial
responses.  Defendant and its counsel of record, jointly and severally, are ordered to
pay monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,800 to Plaintiff, by
and through counsel, within 20 days of notice of this order. 
Plaintiff shall provide
notice of this order.
