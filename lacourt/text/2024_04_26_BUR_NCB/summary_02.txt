And here is an English summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has denied Plaintiff Capital One, N.A.'s motion for judgment on the pleadings against Defendant Margarit Manvelyan. The Judge ruled that the Plaintiff's motion failed to demonstrate how the Defendant's answer was deficient and failed to allege sufficient facts to constitute defenses against the Plaintiff. The Judge also declined to take judicial notice of the Defendant's deemed admissions to the Plaintiff's Requests for Admissions, stating that the hearing on demurrer should not be turned into a contested evidentiary hearing. The Judge suggested that the Defendant's reliance on the Requests for Admissions may be better suited for a motion for summary judgment.
