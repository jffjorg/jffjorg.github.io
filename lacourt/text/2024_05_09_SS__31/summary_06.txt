And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the motions to compel and deemed requests for admissions (RFAs) and has granted Denshaz's motions. Denshaz propounded discovery requests on November 9, 2023, but MJH failed to timely respond. Although MJH's counsel provided a copy of served responses as exhibits to his declaration, the responses were not verified and therefore useless at trial. The court deemed Denshaz's RFAs admitted against MJH. The court also imposed sanctions on MJH and its counsel in the amount of $1,160. Additionally, the court awarded Denshaz $230 in attorney's fees and $60 in motion filing fees. The court granted Denshaz's motions to compel and deemed RFAs, and ordered MJH to serve verifications/verified responses to Denshaz's discovery requests.
