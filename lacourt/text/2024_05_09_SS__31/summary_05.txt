And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The tentative ruling is a summary of the judge's decision regarding the plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal of the complaint. The plaintiff, Michelle Margaret Madrid, slipped and fell on water on the floor and filed a complaint against the defendant, Costco Wholesale Corporation, and Joanna Diaz. The complaint was dismissed without prejudice, but the plaintiff filed a motion to set aside the dismissal. The judge has decided to grant the motion and reinstate the complaint. The plaintiff's attorney, Counsel, has admitted to making a mistake in calendaring the dates for the action, which led to the failure to appear on October 10, 2023. The judge has set an order to show cause regarding the dismissal for failure to file proofs of service. The defendant is required to provide evidence of service of the summons and complaint, and if the plaintiff's counsel fails to appear and provide proof of service, the action may be dismissed.
