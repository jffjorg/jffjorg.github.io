BACKGROUND Cross-complainant Denshaz, Inc. (“Denshaz”) propounded on cross-defendant MJH, LLC (“MJH”) (1) form interrogatories, set one, (2) special interrogatories, set one, and (3) request for production of documents (“RPDs”), set one, on November 9, 2023. Responses were due on December 11, 2023. Denshaz’s counsel sent correspondence to MJH’s counsel on several occasions, which did not yield any responses. Denshaz avers that MJH has not provided any responses to date. Denshaz therefore seeks an order compelling MJH to respond, without objections, to the outstanding discovery and to pay sanctions.  In opposition, MJH’s counsel declares that all responses to the outstanding discovery are now moot because responses have since been served. MJH’s counsel provides a copy of the served responses as exhibits to his declaration.  In reply, Denshaz argues the motions are not moot, because the responses provided are not verified and therefore useless at trial.   II. MOTIONS TO COMPEL Legal Standard For a motion to compel initial discovery responses, all a propounding party must show is that it properly served its discovery requests, that the time to respond has expired, and that the party to whom the requests were directed failed to provide a timely response. (See Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902, 905 906.) Where a party fails to serve timely responses to discovery requests, the court may make an order compelling responses. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290; 2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.) A party that fails to serve timely responses waives any objections to the request, including ones based on privilege or the protection of attorney work product. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a); § 2031.300, subd. (a).)    Discussion & Conclusion The Court has reviewed the responses served upon Denshaz. The responses contain substantive answers, and as Denshaz points out, no verifications were provided. An unverified response is tantamount to no response at all. (Melendrez v. Superior Court (2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 1343, 1348.) As such, the motions are not moot. Therefore, because the evidence shows MJH was properly served with discovery by Denshaz and failed to timely respond, any objections have been waived. Denshaz’s motions are GRANTED.  MJH is ordered to serve verifications/verified responses to Denshaz’s (1) form interrogatories, set one, (2) special interrogatories, set one, and (3) RPDs, set one, without objections, within fifteen (15) days. (CCP §§ 2030.290(a),(b), 2031.300(a),(b).)  ¿ III.  MOTIONS TO DEEM REQUEST FOR ADMISSIONS ADMITTED¿ Legal Standard Where there has been no timely response to a request for admission under CCP § 2033.010, the propounding party may move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction. (Code of Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).)  The party who failed to respond waives any objections to the demand, unless the court grants that party relief from the waiver, upon a showing that the party (1) has subsequently served a substantially compliant response, and (2) that the party’s failure to respond was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. (Code of Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subds. (a)(1)-(2).) The court “shall” grant a motion to deem admitted requests for admissions, “unless it finds that the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.” (Code of Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).) Discussion & Conclusion The evidence demonstrates that Denshaz served its requests for admission, set one, on MJH on November 9, 2023. MJH’s opposition provides a copy of the RFAs served after the instant motion was filed. However, the responses do not evince that any verification was provided pursuant to section 2033.240.     Accordingly, unless MJH furnishes verifications by the time of the hearing on this motion, the motion is otherwise GRANTED. Denshaz’s RFAs, set one, is deemed admitted against MJH. (CCP §2033.280(b).)       IV. SANCTIONS Sanctions are mandatory against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response, unless a court makes certain findings.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290(c), 2031.300(c).) Further, “It is mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion.”  (CCP §§ 2030.290(c) , 2033.280(c).) Denshaz seeks sanctions in the amount of $855 for each motion to compel. MJH contends the delay was not intentional, and that sanctions either not be ordered or to be granted in consideration of his office’s increased workload and difficulties with discovery management. Here, the Court finds that MJH has not provided substantial justification against granting monetary sanctions. It is undisputed that tardy unverified responses were served, and practically all firms are busy in daily practice. If being busy with work was considered a justifiable excuse, then litigation would never proceed in a timely manner. The Court therefore grants Denshaz’s request for monetary sanctions.  However, a court has discretion to award sanctions that are “suitable and necessary to enable the party seeking discovery to obtain the objects of the discovery he seeks” but they should not be punitive in nature or levied for the purposes of punishing an offending party. (Vallbona v. Springer (1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 1525, 1545.)         Denshaz is awarded $230 for each motion to compel, for a total of $920 as attorney’s fees. Further, Denshaz is awarded four motion filing fees of $60, for a total of $240, as costs.       Sanctions are imposed against MJH and its counsel of record, jointly and severally. MJH and/or MJH’s counsel are ordered to pay sanctions to Denshaz, by and through counsel of record, in the total amount of $1,160, within twenty (20) days.  Moving party is ordered to give notice.    PLEASE TAKE NOTICE: Parties are encouraged to meet and confer after reading this tentative ruling to see if they can reach an agreement. If a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling,¿the party must send an email to the court at¿sscdept31@lacourt.org¿with the Subject line “SUBMIT” followed by the case number.¿ The body of the email must include the hearing date and time, counsel’s contact information, and the identity of the party submitting.¿¿ Unless¿all¿parties submit by email to this tentative ruling, the parties should arrange to appear remotely (encouraged) or in person for oral argument.¿ You should assume that others may appear at the hearing to argue.¿¿ If the parties neither submit nor appear at hearing, the Court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the Court.¿ After the Court has issued a tentative ruling, the Court may prohibit the withdrawal of the subject motion without leave.¿  Dated this 8th day of May 2024      Hon.
