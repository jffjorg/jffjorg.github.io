Significant Statements:
  - "There is little flexibility in the procedural imperatives of [Code of Civil Procedure section 437c], and the issues raised by a motion for summary judgment (or summary adjudication) are pure questions of law. As a result, section 437c is unforgiving; a failure to comply with any one of its myriad requirements is likely to be fatal to the offending party." (Brantley v. Pisaro)
  - "The party moving for summary judgment bears the burden of persuasion that there is no triable issue of material fact and that he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law[.] There is a triable issue of material fact if, and only if, the evidence would allow a reasonable trier of fact to find the underlying fact in favor of the party opposing the motion in accordance with the applicable standard of proof." (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co.)

And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of 594 Mapleton LLC (Plaintiff) v. Mirga Phipps White (Defendant) regarding a motion for summary judgment. The Plaintiff seeks to quiet title to a property in Los Angeles, alleging that the Defendant has wrongfully claimed title to the property. The Court has reviewed the evidence presented by both parties and finds that the Plaintiff has met its burden of showing that it holds title to the property and is entitled to judgment.

The Court finds that the Defendant has failed to raise a triable issue of material fact as to each of the Plaintiff's causes of action, including quiet title, cancellation of instrument, declaratory relief, and injunctive relief. The Defendant's opposition to the motion is found to be inadequate, as it does not respond to the Plaintiff's separate statement and does not present admissible evidence to counter the Plaintiff's evidence.

As a result, the Court grants the Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment and orders the Plaintiff to give notice of the Court's order and to file a proof of service of same.
