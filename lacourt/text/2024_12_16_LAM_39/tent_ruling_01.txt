OPPOSING PARTY


Defendant Otoniel Montano



 
MOTION
Plaintiff Marcos
Soto Mendoza (“Plaintiff”) sued Defendant Otoniel Montano (“Defendant”) for
habitability violations.  Defendant
cross-complained against Plaintiff, and Plaintiff moves to strike the
cross-complaint.  Defendant opposes the
motion.    
ANALYSIS
Any party, within
the time allowed to respond to a pleading, may serve and file a motion to
strike the whole pleading or any part thereof. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 435, subd. (b)(1); Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1322,
subd. (b).)  On a motion to strike, the
court may: (1) strike out any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in
any pleading; or (2) strike out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or
filed in conformity with the laws of California, a court rule, or an order of
the court.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 436,
subd. (a)-(b); Stafford v. Shultz
(1954) 42 Cal.2d 767, 782.)
Pursuant to Code
of Civil Procedure section 428.50, a party may file a compulsory
cross-complaint with the answer or with leave of Court in the interests of
justice at any time during the action.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 428.50.) 
Defendant answered Plaintiff’s operative complaint on September 10, 2024 but filed
the cross-complaint on September 11, 2024. 
Defendant, therefore, should have sought leave of Court to file the
cross-complaint.  
Therefore, the
motion to strike is granted without prejudice to Defendant’s right to file a
motion for leave to cross-complain against Plaintiff.  
Plaintiff is ordered
to provide notice of this order and to file proof of service of same.
