SUMMARY
OF ACTION
Plaintiff Circa 1200, LLC alleges a lease with Defendants
Abel Marquez and Cynthia Vencebi aka Cynthia Marquez for residential premises,
1200 S. Figueroa St., E3509. Defendants were evicted and moved on September 10,
2020, thereby leaving an outstanding rental balance due of $57,695.33.
 
On January 30, 2024, Plaintiff filed a complaint Breach of
Contract and Common Counts.
 
RULING: Overruled.
Defendants
Abel and Cynthia Marquez, in pro per, submit a
demurrer to the complaint for breach of contract and common counts. Defendants
contend the complaint lacks sufficient facts establishing the existence of any
lease agreement and a balance due. Plaintiff Circa 1200, LLC, in opposition
maintains the contract and common counts claims are properly pled. The court
electronic filing system shows no reply on file at the time of the tentative
ruling publication cutoff.
 
A demurrer is an objection to a pleading, the grounds for
which are apparent from either the face of the complaint or a matter of which
the court may take judicial notice. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.30, subd. (a); see
also Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d
311, 318.) The purpose of a demurrer is to challenge the sufficiency of a
pleading “by raising questions of law.” (Postley
v. Harvey (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 280, 286.) “In the construction of a
pleading, for the purpose of determining its effect, its allegations must be
liberally construed, with a view to substantial justice between the parties.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 452.) The court “ ‘ “treat[s] the demurrer as admitting all
material facts properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions
of fact or law . . . .” ’ ” (Berkley v.
Dowds (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 518, 525.) In applying these standards, the
court liberally construes the complaint to determine whether a cause of action
has been stated.  (Picton v. Anderson Union High School Dist. (1996) 50 Cal.App.4th
726, 733.)
 
“A demurrer for
uncertainty is strictly construed, even where a complaint is in some respects
uncertain, because ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery
procedures.” (Khoury v. Maly's of California, Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616; Williams v. Beechnut Nutrition Corp. (1986) 185 Cal.App.3d
135, 139 [“[U]nder our liberal pleading rules,
where the complaint contains substantive factual allegations sufficiently
apprising defendant of the issues it is being asked to meet, a demurrer for
uncertainty should be overruled or plaintiff given leave to amend.] 
 
1st
Cause of Action: Breach of Contract
“To state a cause of action for
breach of contract, [a plaintiff] must plead the
contract, his performance of the contract or excuse for nonperformance,
[defendant’s] breach and the resulting damage. (Citation.) Further, the
complaint must indicate on its face whether the contract is written, oral, or
implied by conduct. (Citation.)” (Otworth
v. Southern Pac. Transportation Co. (1985) 166 Cal.App.3d 452,
458–59.) In examining a breach of contract claim, the court is required
to examine the terms, or at least the legal effect of the contract. (Blank v. Kirwan, supra, 39 Cal.3d at p. 318 [“we give the complaint a reasonable
interpretation, reading it as a whole and its parts in their context”].)
 
The complaint alleges the existence of the written lease,
incorporates a copy of the lease, and states a breach based on failure to
comply with the terms of the lease, thereby leaving an outstanding balance. The
complaint is therefore proper and the demurrer overruled as to this cause of
action. 
 
2nd Cause of Action: Common Counts
A
common count cause of action withstands general and special demurrer if the
elements are stated: a statement of indebtedness, consideration, and
nonpayment. (Avidor v. Sutter's Place, Inc. (2013) 212 Cal.App.4th 1439, 1454; Farmers Insurance Exchange v. Zerin (1997) 53
Cal.App.4th 445, 460.) The operative complaint articulates the
elements for a common count claim. The demurrer is overruled.
 
The demurrer is
overruled in its entirety. Defendants to answer the complaint within 10 days of
this order.
 
The court will concurrently conduct a Case Management
Conference and OSC re: Sanctions.
 
Defendants to give notice.
