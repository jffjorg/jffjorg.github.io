And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Plaintiff Jennifer A. Aylward's motion to quash Defendant Brinker International, Inc.'s notice of deposition and subpoena. The motion was filed on August 21, 2024, and the judge has reviewed the relevant facts and arguments presented by both parties.

The plaintiff argues that the notice of deposition and subpoena must be quashed because they were served after the discovery cutoff date. However, the defendant argues that the notice of deposition and subpoena fall into the category of discovery at issue prior to the discovery cutoff date.

The judge finds that the defendant's deposition subpoena falls into the category of discovery at issue prior to the discovery cutoff date and is therefore not barred from pursuing the deposition. The judge also notes that the plaintiff's request for permission to conduct additional discovery was not properly lodged in the opposition to the defendant's motion and must be made separately.

Based on the foregoing, the judge denies the plaintiff's motion to quash and orders that the defendant may proceed with the deposition and subpoena.
