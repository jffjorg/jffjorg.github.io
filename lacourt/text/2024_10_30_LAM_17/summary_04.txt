And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a Tentative Ruling in the case of Valsoft Corporation, Inc. v. Fleet Logic LLC dba Velocity Truck Rental and Leasing (Case No. 24STCV04219). The Court has overruled Defendant's demurrer to Plaintiff's fourth cause of action, which alleges misappropriation of trade secrets, breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and unauthorized computer access.

The Court held that Plaintiff's allegations in its First Amended Complaint (FAC) are sufficient to state a claim against Defendant. Specifically, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant's agents accessed Valsoft's computer system without permission, and that Plaintiff incurred significant time, effort, and expense to investigate and verify the unauthorized access.

The Court also held that Plaintiff's allegations of damages are sufficient, as they include expenditures reasonably and necessarily incurred to verify that Valsoft's computers, systems, and networks were not altered, damaged, or deleted.

The Court further held that the proper construction of the parties' Agreement regarding use of software is not properly determined at the pleading stage, as it involves factual determinations involving intent and purpose.

The Tentative Ruling will be adopted as the final order unless all parties submit on the tentative and there are no appearances at the hearing.
