The judge has tentatively ruled that plaintiff James Reynolds must contact Department 17 to schedule an informal discovery conference (IDC) before the court will consider his motion to compel further responses to his Requests for Production (RFPs) and Form Interrogatories. The judge has ordered that the parties participate in the IDC before the motion can be heard on the merits. The judge has also stated that if all parties submit on the tentative, the court will adopt it as the final order, but if no submissions are received and no appearances are made at the hearing, the motion may be placed off calendar.
