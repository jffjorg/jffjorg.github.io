And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendants' motion to compel arbitration and staying the action pending the completion of arbitration. The defendants, Azadegan Law Group, APC, and its attorneys, Ramin Azadegan, Douglas Stuart Fabian, Susan Marsha Freedman, and Dimitry Zinovy Tsimberg, submitted evidence that they entered into an Engagement Agreement with the plaintiffs, Bear Valley 2005, LLC, and Joseph Michael, on May 17, 2017, which contains a binding arbitration provision. The plaintiffs argued that the agreement is void due to the defendants' failure to provide a written copy of the contract to the clients and a violation of California Rule of Professional Conduct, Rule 2-220. However, the judge found that the defendants have established by a preponderance of the evidence that an arbitration agreement exists and that the plaintiffs' claims are covered by that agreement. The judge also found that the plaintiffs did not establish any persuasive basis for the unenforceability of the arbitration provision. Therefore, the defendants' motion to compel arbitration is granted, and the action is stayed pending the completion of arbitration.
