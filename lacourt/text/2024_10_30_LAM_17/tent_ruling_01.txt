On 8/21/2024,
Plaintiff moved to quash Defendant’s Notice of Deposition and Subpoena to
Desirae Giraldes. 
 
Discussion 
 
            Plaintiff
argues that “Defendant’s deposition and subpoena must be quashed because
Brinker served them on or about August 1, 2024, which was after the discovery
cutoff.” (Motion, 2: 13-14.) Plaintiff contends that while the Court continued
trial to February 18, 2025, the Court denied Aylward’s application to reset the
discovery cutoff based on the new trial date.
 
            In
opposition, Defendant contends that:
 
Brinker originally
noticed Giraldes’ deposition on June 24, 2024, and the original deposition date
was scheduled for July 3, 2024, two days prior to the discovery cutoff.
(Defendants were unable to serve Giraldes with her subpoena before the July 3,
2024, deposition date, and so took the deposition off calendar. [] At a hearing
on July 23, 2024, the Court ruled on Plaintiff’s various Motions to Compel and
Motions to Quash, and issued a ruling permitting continued discovery on
discovery and depositions which were at issue prior to the discovery cutoff
date. [] Defendants then amended their initial notice of Giraldes’ deposition
and served it on Plaintiff’s counsel on August 1, 2024. [] The amended notice
scheduled the deposition date for August 30, 2024. [] Giraldes was served with
the subpoena on August 9, 2024. []
 
            (Opp.,
2:27-3:8.) 
 
            After
review, the Court is persuaded that Defendant’s deposition subpoena falls into
the category of discovery at issue prior to the discovery cut-off date.  As such, Defendant is not barred from
pursuing this deposition. While Plaintiff requests permission to conduct
additional discovery as well, such a request is not properly lodged in an
opposition to another motion. If Plaintiff wishes to seek other discovery, she
must formally move for such permission, and must set forth evidence, like
Defendant here, to show that the discovery sought falls into the category of discovery
and depositions which were at issue prior to the discovery cutoff date.
 
            Based
on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s motion to quash is denied. 
 
It is so ordered.
