  vs.

 Case
  No.:  24STCV03483 
 
 
 
 Hearing Date: October 30, 2024



 
Defendants’
motion to compel arbitration is GRANTED. This action is stayed pending the
completion of arbitration.
 
            On
2/9/2024, Plaintiff Bear Valley 2005 and Joseph Michael (collectively,
Plaintiffs) initiated this action. On 6/26/2024, Plaintiffs filed a first amended
complaint (FAC) against Azadegan Law Group, APC, Ramin Azadegan, Douglas Stuart
Fabian, Susan Marsha Freedman, and Dimitry Zinovy Tsimberg (collectively,
Defendants), alleging: (1) malpractice; (2) breach of fiduciary duty; (3)
fraud; (4) negligent misrepresentation; (5) restitution/unjust enrichment; and
(6) violation of Business and Professions Code section 17200. 
 
            On
8/26/2024, Defendants moved to compel Plaintiffs to arbitrate their FAC, and
stay this action pending the completion of arbitration. 
 
Legal Standard
 
“Where
the Court has determined that an agreement to arbitrate a controversy exists,
the Court shall order the petitioner and the respondent to arbitrate the
controversy …unless it determines that… 
grounds exist for rescission of the agreement.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
1281.2.) Among the grounds which can support rescission are fraud, duress, and
unconscionability. (Tiri v. Lucky
Chances, Inc. (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 231, 239.) The Court may also decline
to compel arbitration wherein there is possibility
of conflicting rulings on a common issue of law or fact. (Code Civ. Proc., §
1281.2 (c).) 
 
Discussion
 
1.      Defendants’
Burden
 
The party
moving to compel arbitration “bears the burden of proving [the] existence [of
an arbitration agreement] by a preponderance of the evidence.” (Rosenthal v. Great Western Fin. Securities
Corp. (1996) 14 Cal.4th 394, 413.) The moving party also bears the burden
of demonstrating that the claims fall within the scope of the arbitration
agreement. (Omar v. Ralphs Grocery Co. (2004)
118 Cal.App.4th 955, 961.)
 
A.   
Existing Agreement
 
Defendants—who
in 2017 represented Plaintiffs in Superior Paving Company, Inc. dba United
Paving Company v. Bear Valley 2005, LLC, Imperial County Superior Court
Case No. ECU08984—submitted evidence that on May 17, 2017, Azadegan Law and
Plaintiffs entered into an Engagement Agreement (the Engagement Agreement) that
contains a binding arbitration provision. The Engagement Agreement between
Plaintiffs and Azadegan Law contains an arbitration provision requiring that
any controversy, claim, or dispute arising out of or relating to the Engagement
Agreement, or relating otherwise to Azadegan Law’s representation of
Plaintiffs, shall be determined through binding arbitration in accordance with
the rules of ADR Services, Inc. and not by court action.
 
            In
opposition, Plaintiffs argue that Defendants’ Engagement Agreement is void for
two reasons:
 
            First,
Plaintiffs contend that Azadegan Law did not provide the clients with a written
copy of their fully executed contract until after this action was filed. If a
fully executed written contract for services between an attorney and client is
not provided to the client at the time that the contract is signed by both the
attorney and client, then pursuant to California Business & Professions
Code section 6148, that contract is voidable at the option of the client.
 
            However,
section 6148 expressly states that this requirement does not apply to corporate
clients. Second, Plaintiffs signed a “Client’s Acceptance” page which expressly
states that they “have received a duplicate original of this legal services fee
letter agreement.” (See Azadegan Decl., Exh. A., p. 10.)  
 
            Second,
Plaintiffs contend that Defendants, who are not all part of the same law firm,
did not disclose their fee splitting arrangement in a writing approved and
signed by their clients, the Plaintiffs. This is a violation of California Rule
of Professional Conduct, Rule 2-220. However, Plaintiffs did not submit caselaw
which could show that this violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct is
sufficient to void the underlying Engagement Letter as a matter of law. While
Plaintiff cited Huskinson & Brown, LLP v. Wolf (2004) 32 Cal.4th
453, 462-463, that case in no way dealt with the question of arbitrability.
Rather, Huskinson addressed whether an attorney could still recover monetarily
for legal services where there was a violation of Rule 2-200, with the Court
there concluding that they could though only under a theory of quantum meruit.
Given that the question before the Court does not concern the collection of
fees but rather the arbitrability of Plaintiffs’ claims, the Court finds an
insufficient basis to conclude that the arbitration provision cannot be
enforced based on a violation of Rule 2-200.  

 
Given that
Defendants have established by a preponderance of the evidence that an
arbitration agreement exists, and that Plaintiffs’ claims are covered by that
agreement, the burden shifts to the Plaintiffs to establish that the
arbitration clause should not be enforced. (Pinnacle
Museum Tower Assn. v. Pinnacle Market Development (US), LLC (2012) 55
Cal.4th 223, 236. (Pinnacle).)
 
2.      Plaintiff’s Burden
 
The party
opposing arbitration bears the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the
evidence any defense, such as unconscionability or duress. (Pinnacle, supra, 55 Cal.4th at p. 236.) 
 
“Unconscionability has both procedural
and substantive elements. Although both must appear for a court to invalidate a
contract or one of its individual terms, they need not be present in the same
degree: ‘[T]he more substantively oppressive the contract term, the less
evidence of procedural unconscionability is required to come to the conclusion
that the term is unenforceable, and vice versa.’”  (Roman
v. Superior Court (2009) 172 Cal.App.4th 1462, 1469. (“Roman”).) Where the degree of procedural unconscionability is low,
“the agreement will be enforceable unless the degree of substantive unconscionability
is high.” (Ajamian v. CantorCO2e (2012)
203 Cal.App.4th 771, 796 (Ajamian”).)
 
Plaintiffs
did not advance any argument of unconscionability, and thus have not set forth
any persuasive basis for the unenforceability of the arbitration provision. 
 
Based on the
foregoing, Defendants’ motion to compel arbitration is granted. This action is
stayed pending the completion of arbitration.
 
 
It is so ordered.
