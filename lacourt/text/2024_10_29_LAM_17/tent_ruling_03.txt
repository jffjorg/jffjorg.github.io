As for Item 1, Defendant argues that “[s]pecifically, plaintiff is claiming
$645.00 for CourtCall Remote appearance fees, including $90.00 in late fees.
These are neither a filing nor motion fee within the meaning of CCP §1033.5.
These remote appearances were not mandatory, but rather a “convenience” to
plaintiff’s counsel and therefore should be disallowed…. Further, plaintiff is
claiming $61.65 in filing fees in connection with a post-trial motion on an
equitable relief claim, which ultimately denied, and therefore the County, not
plaintiff is the prevailing party on that claim. Lastly, plaintiff is claiming
$8.00 in retrieval fees for retrieving documents from the Court’s website,
which are not filing or motion fees within the meaning of CCP §1033.5.” (Motion,
5: 28-6:9.) 
 
            However, a cost is not disallowed
merely because it is not listed in the statute as recoverable. (Applegate v.
St. Francis Lutheran Church (1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 361 363-364.) Under the
FEHA, the award of costs is left to the discretion of the Court. 
 
            Remote
appearances create a number of efficiencies, and Plaintiff’s associated
attorney fee motion would have been much higher had Plaintiff sent an attorney
to appear in-person to every case management conference or status conference.
Defendant did not cite any authority to show that Plaintiff cannot recover the
filing fee for the motion for equitable relief because the Court denied it.
Plaintiff is entitled as a matter of right to recovery of costs for filing fees
under CCP section 1033.5 because he is the prevailing party in the action. The
Court does not evaluate the prevailing party on the basis of who prevailed on
each underlying motion. Retrieval fees are not listed as a disallowed cost
under CCP section 1033.5, and those costs were reasonable and necessary to the
litigation of this action. As such, the Court agrees with Plaintiff that the
claimed costs are recoverable.
 
            As for Item 2, Defendant argues that
Plaintiff miscalculated the total claimed cost for jury fees, and moves to
strike a portion of claimed costs. In opposition, Plaintiff agreed:
 
Plaintiff inadvertently omitted the receipt for jury fees paid on
August 14, 2024, in the amount of $156.73. It is included as an exhibit in the
declaration of Kelsey Ciarimboli, filed concurrently with this motion.
(Ciarimboli Dec., ¶ 4.) Plaintiff does not dispute that his Memorandum of Costs
included a typographical error which resulted in incorrectly reporting incurred
charges of $607.99; in fact, the charges were for $507.99, a difference of
$100. Plaintiff withdraws the $100 overstatement charge. 
 
            Accordingly, the Court strikes $100
from the claimed costs.
 
            As for Item 4, Defendant argues that
Plaintiff miscalculated the total claimed cost for deposition costs, and seeks
to strike $1,475.10 of the $11,011.77 in claimed costs. In opposition, Plaintiff
agreed to withdraw the costs associated with the cancellation of Dr. Jang’s
deposition, $384.60. However, Plaintiff argues that the Court should award the
$395 cancellation fee for the deposition of Victoria Wilkerson, Defendant’s
retained expert, contending:
 
This cancellation was necessitated because Defendant failed to
produce the documents in Plaintiff’s deposition notice of Wilkerson. Defendant
only produced the witness’s CV and report the day before the deposition, even
though the documents must be produced three business days in advance as
required by Code of Civil Procedure section 2034.415. (Ciarimboli Dec., ¶ 5.)
Defendant did not comply at all with several of the document inspection
requests. Accordingly, because Defendant had only partially and belatedly
complied with the document inspection demands in the deposition notice,
Plaintiff was forced to reschedule the deposition and met and conferred with
Defendant regarding the non-compliance. (Ciarimboli Dec., ¶ 6.)
 
            (Opp., 10: 7-16.)
 
            The Court strikes $384.60 in costs
but awards the remaining costs. CCP section 1033.5, subdivision (b) does not
list deposition cancellation fees as a disallowed cost, and the Court finds
that, in light of the circumstances, it was reasonable for Plaintiff to reschedule
the deposition and meet and confer.
 
            As for Item 5, Defendant challenges
$2,035.48 for service of process costs. However, after review, the Court finds
the costs actually and reasonably incurred. 
 
            As for Item 8, Defendant argues that
Plaintiff impermissibly seeks to recover expert witness fees. Costs such as
expert witness fees not ordered by the court, or attorney fees that require a
court determination, may not be “immediately enter [ed]” by the clerk, and
instead necessitate a decision by the trial court, exercising its discretion. (Anthony
v. City of Los Angeles (2008) 166 Cal. App. 4th 1011, 1016.) Defendant did
not advance any substantive argument as to why the Court should not, in its
discretion, award these fees. Plaintiff prevailed on his FEHA retaliation
claim, with the jury finding that Defendant retaliated against Plaintiff based
on his engaging in FEHA protected activities. 
As such, these expert witness fees were reasonably necessary and
contributed to Plaintiff prevailing on his claim.  Accordingly, the Court finds these fees to be
recoverable. 
 
            As for Item 11, Defendant argues
that Plaintiff should not recover for $3,442.29 for costs associated with
models and enlargements to aid the jury at trial. Models, the enlargements of
exhibits and photocopies of exhibits, and the electronic presentation of
exhibits, including costs of rental equipment and electronic formatting, may be
allowed if they were reasonably helpful to aid the trier of fact. (CCP § 1033
5(a)(13).) In order to secure recovery, models, enlargements, and photocopies
of exhibits must have actually been used at trial to aid the trier of fact. (Ladas
v. California State Auto. Assn. (1993) 19 Cal. 4th 761, 774.) Here,
Plaintiff submitted expenses associated with printing trial exhibits, exhibit
binders, jury questionnaires for use during voir dire, and Post-It Note Boards,
which Mr. Bohm used frequently during Plaintiff’s case in chief for
demonstrative purposes. (Ciarimboli Dec., ¶ 9.) The Court finds these costs to
be actually and reasonably incurred.
 
            As for Item 12, Defendant argues
that Plaintiff cannot recover for non-Court ordered transcripts and reporter
fees citing CCP section 1033.5, subdivision (b). However, Costs under the FEHA
are governed by Government Code section 12965, subdivision (b), which does not
disallow recovery of daily transcripts. The Court has discretion to award this
cost under the FEHA. As set forth in Plaintiff’s opposition, daily transcripts
were necessary in order to better prepare the case against Defendant. (See Opp.,
12: 12-14.) Accordingly, the Court awards these costs in its discretion. 
 
            As for Item 14, electronic filing
fees are an expressly allowable cost where electronic filing is required by
local rules. (CCP § 1033.5, subd. (a)(14).) Since January 2, 2019, the Superior
Court for the County of Los Angeles has required electronic filing. (See
Los Angeles County Local Rule 3.4(a).) Plaintiff submitted the receipts
associated with these costs, which were all associated with this case. (Ciarimboli
Dec., ¶ 11.) Thus, these costs are reasonable and necessary on their face. 
 
            As for Item 16, Plaintiff seeks
$37,384.11 for “other” unspecified costs. As set forth in Defendant’s motion,
this sum include such costs as:

As noted by Plaintiff, these costs are discretionary under FEHA and
the CCP. After review, the Court finds that all of Plaintiff’s “Other” costs
were convenient, rather than necessary, to this litigation. The Court taxes the
entire amount of “Other” costs totaling $37,384.11. 
 
            Based on the foregoing, the Court
grants in part, denies in part Defendant’s motion to tax costs. The Court taxes
$100 from Item 2, $395 from Item 4, and $37,394.11 from Item 16, for a total of
$37,889.11. 
 
 
It is so
ordered.
