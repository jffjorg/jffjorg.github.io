Significant Statements:
  - "Plaintiff moves this Court to summarily adjudicate the following: that (1) Michelle, Defendants and Cross-Complainants Katherine Ramos (Katherine) and Caroline Ramos (Caroline) formed a partnership for the manufacture and sale of cosmetics; (2) they agreed to incorporate a company in which they would be equal owners and to which they would license the IP they had created; (3) a lawful agreement to license the IP was fully performed by Michelle, Katherine, and Caroline on the one hand and the company (i.e., Defendants and Cross-Complainant Rituel de Fille, Inc. (RDF) they formed on the other; (4) that the unilateral and unjustified cancellation by RDF, Katherine and Caroline of the License Agreement and their continued use of the IP constituted misappropriation of the IP; and (5) Michelle was damaged because after cancellation of the license agreement she was no longer remunerated for the company's use of the IP although Katherine and Caroline continued to be."

Summary:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for summary adjudication. The plaintiff sought to have the court make five findings of fact, but the motion was deficient in several ways. The defendant submitted evidence that the plaintiff had misrepresented the purpose of the License Agreement and had backdated it to 2013, which was when RDF was incorporated. The defendant also submitted evidence that the plaintiff had never owned any of RDF's intellectual property. The judge found that the defendant's evidence raised a triable issue of material fact and that the plaintiff had not met its burden to show that the License Agreement was valid or that the defendant had breached it. The judge also noted that the plaintiff had not adequately addressed its trade secret, unfair competition, wrongful termination, and accounting claims.
