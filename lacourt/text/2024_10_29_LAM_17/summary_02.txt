Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the defendant's motion to compel arbitration and stay the action pending the completion of arbitration. The plaintiff, Maria Mercedes Fajardo, filed a lawsuit against the defendant, ALAL, LLC d/b/a KEI-AI Los Angeles Healthcare Center, alleging disability discrimination, failure to accommodate, failure to engage in interactive process, retaliation, age discrimination, and wrongful termination. The defendant moved to compel arbitration and stay the action, arguing that the parties had entered into an arbitration agreement.

The court found that the defendant had established by a preponderance of the evidence that an arbitration agreement exists and that the plaintiff's claims are covered by that agreement. The court also found that the plaintiff had failed to show any evidence of substantive unconscionability, such as an imbalance of bargaining power or surprise, and that the arbitration agreement was enforceable.

The court concluded that the arbitration agreement is enforceable and that the action is stayed pending the completion of arbitration. The defendant's motion is granted, and the plaintiff's claims will be resolved through arbitration rather than litigation.
