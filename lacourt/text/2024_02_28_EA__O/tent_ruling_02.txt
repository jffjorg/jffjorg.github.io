Burden of Proof on Motion, Cal. Prac. Guide Civ. Pro. Before Trial Ch. 10-F.


[2] Per well-established summary judgment practice and
the California Rules of Court Rule 3.1350, a SS is to only discuss material
facts and citation to evidence that discuss address said material facts. Here,
Kindred cites to a litany of evidence, most of which is irrelevant. (See e.g.,
Kindred cites to Klein Declaration at Page 8, Lines 5-15, but that section
goes to causation.) As the crux of Kindred’s argument concerns the vague or
insufficient discovery responses, the court will examine the discovery responses.
(E.g., Exhibit 1; at Page 2, Lines 10-13 referencing “Kindred Baldwin
Park’s Special Interrogatories, Set One, Propounded on Plaintiff,” Exhibit 2;
at Page 2, Lines 1417 referencing “Kindred Baldwin Park’s Request for
Admissions, Set One, Propounded on Plaintiff,” Exhibit 3; at Page 2,
Lines 18-21 referencing “Kindred Baldwin Park’s Request for the Production of
Documents, Set One, Propounded on Plaintiff,” Exhibit 4; at Page 2,
Lines 22-25 referencing “Plaintiff’s Response to Kindred Baldwin Park’s Form
Interrogatories, Set One,” Exhibit 5; at Page 2, Lines 26-28 and at Page
3, Line 1, referencing “Plaintiff’s Response to Kindred Baldwin Park’s Special
Interrogatories, Set One,” Exhibit 6; at Page 3, Lines 25 referencing
“Plaintiff’s Response to Kindred Baldwin Park’s Request for Admissions, Set One,”
Exhibit 7; at Page 3, Lines 6-10 referencing “Plaintiff’s Response to
Kindred Baldwin Park’s Request for the Production of Documents, Set One,” Exhibit
8.) But Defendant’s exhibit citations do not appear accurate. (E.g.,
Kindred cites to Ex. 4 at p. 2 lines 22:25 for Plaintiff’s response, but lines
22:25 of page 2 merely define “writing” for purposes of the RFPs.) 
 


[3] That said, Plaintiff is correct in that both
authorization and ratification may be implied via circumstantial evidence. (See
Hartman v. Shell Oil Co. (1977) 68 Cal.App.3d 240, 249-250.) And though
Plaintiff provided no legal analysis nor authority to support its
proposition that certain circumstances like understaffing or failures to
investigate certain shortcomings in care can sufficiently illustrate
ratification, that is supported by certain authority. (See e.g., Pusateri v.
E.F. Hutton & Co. (1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 247, 251-253 [ If an
“accident” or injury occurs, the failure to investigate gives rise to the
inference that the employer already knew of the cause or expected such injuries
in the normal course of its business. Thus, the opportunity to learn of
misconduct together with failure to investigate raises the inference of
ratification].) 
 
To
the extent that Kindred contends otherwise (Reply p. 4:25-25) by citing to College
Hospital v. Superior Court (1999) 8 Cal. 4th 704, 724-726, the case does
not support such a proposition. College Hospital merely provides
that the agent who does the ratifying must be acting as the organization’s
representative, not in some other capacity (e.g., employee acting in his personal
capacity for his own private benefit is insufficient to support punitive
damages against employer).  
 


[4] In asserting a professional negligence COA involving
a defendant’s failure to adhere to an accepted standard of practice, such
standard may only be established by qualified expert testimony. (Stephenson
v. Kaiser Foundation Hospital (1962) 203 Cal.App.2d 631; see also Barton
v. Owens (1977) 71 Cal.App.3d 484, 494.) 
 


[5] The docket does not reveal that Plaintiff has
objected to Dr. Klein’s evidence. 


[6] See Reply p. 6: “However, Dr. Pietruszka omits the
indisputable fact that once a wound is staged, it can progress but can never be
“back-staged, reverse staged or down staged,” as set forth by the National
Pressure Injury Advisory Panel (NPIAP). Mary Ellen Dziedzic, Fast Facts About
Pressure Ulcer Care for Nurses: How to Prevent, Detect and Resolve Them in a
Nutshell (2018).”
