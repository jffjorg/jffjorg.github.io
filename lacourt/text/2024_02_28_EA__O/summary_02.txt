Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the evidence presented by Kindred and has determined that the discovery responses will be examined. The court has also found that circumstantial evidence may imply authorization and ratification, and that failure to investigate may raise the inference of ratification. However, the judge has noted that Kindred provided no legal analysis nor authority to support its proposition, and that the defendant's exhibit citations appear inaccurate. The court has also determined that qualified expert testimony is required to establish a professional negligence COA. The judge has cited several cases, including Hartman v. Shell Oil Co. (1977), Pusateri v. E.F. Hutton & Co. (1986), College Hospital v. Superior Court (1999), Stephenson v. Kaiser Foundation Hospital (1962), and Barton v. Owens (1977), to support its findings.
