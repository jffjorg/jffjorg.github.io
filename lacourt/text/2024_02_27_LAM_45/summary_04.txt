And here is a summary in English text:

Judge Rolf M. Treu issued a tentative ruling denying a motion for sanctions filed by Defendant Eligio Villalvazo. Defendant Villalvazo sought to impose monetary sanctions of $5,000.00 and non-monetary sanctions, including striking the complaint and dismissing the action, against Plaintiff Royalty Enterprise Construction and its attorneys. Defendant Villalvazo argued that Plaintiff's claim is objectively unreasonable and that Plaintiff's attorneys, Behrouz Shafie, made up facts and are pursuing the claim for the primary purpose of harassing Defendant Villalvazo. The Court found that Plaintiff's allegations about existing economic relationships with customers and Defendant Villalvazo's alleged interference with these relationships do not appear objectively unreasonable. The Court also noted that there is no indication from the court record to suggest that Plaintiff does not believe its claim has any merit. Therefore, the motion for sanctions was denied.
