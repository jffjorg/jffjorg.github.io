Defendants Korea Gardens Restaurant,
Inc.’s and Kenneth Kim’s unopposed motion
for a protective order re Plaintiff No Soo Kim’s deposition subpoena issued to
Hanmi Bank is granted in part and denied in part.
 
          Defendants Korea Gardens Restaurant, Inc. (“KGR”) and Kenneth
Kim (“Kenneth”) (collectively, “KGR Parties”) (collectively, “Defendants”) moves unopposed for a protective
order re Plaintiff No Soo Kim’s (“No Soo”) (“Plaintiff”) deposition subpoena
served on Hanmi Bank for production of documents, including signature cards,
applications, correspondences, bank statements, all documents submitted by KGR
Parties to Hanmi Bank in connection with all of Kenneth’s bank accounts at
Hanmi Bank, held “individually or jointly with any other person or entity” and
for documents related to the real property located at 950 S. Vermont Avenue,
Los Angeles, CA 90006 (“Property”). 
(Notice of Motion, pgs. 1-2; C.C.P. §2025.420.)  
 
          Background
On October 7, 2022, Plaintiff filed his original complaint. 
On February 1, 2024, this Court granted parties’ stipulation for Plaintiff to
be granted leave to file a first amended complaint (“FAC”).  On April 25, 2024, Plaintiff filed the
operative FAC against Defendants alleging six causes of action: (1) dissolution
of partnership; (2) accounting; (3) declaratory relief; (4) conversion; (5)
breach of fiduciary duty; and (6) unjust enrichment.  (See
FAC.)   
On November 15, 2023, Defendants filed the instant motion for
protective order.  As of the date of this hearing no opposition has been
filed.
 
Meet
and Confer
          C.C.P. §2031.060 provides, in part:
When an inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling of documents, tangible things, places, or electronically
stored information has been demanded, the party to whom the demand has been
directed, and any other party or affected person, may promptly move for a
protective order. This motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer
declaration under Section 2016.040.
 
(C.C.P.
§2031.060(a), emphasis added.)
Defendants’
counsel does not submit a meet and confer declaration with the instant motion.  (See Decl. of Yang.)  The Court finds Plaintiff’s counsel’s
declaration does not state facts showing a
“reasonable and good faith attempt” to resolve the matter outside of court.  (C.C.P. §§2016.040, 2031.060(a).)  However, the Court in its discretion will
consider the instant motion.
 
Legal Standard 
C.C.P. §2031.060(b) provides that “[t]he court, for good cause
shown, may make any order that justice requires to protect any party or other
person from unwarranted annoyance, embarrassment, or oppression, or undue
burden and expense.”  (C.C.P.
§2031.060(b).)
The decision upon whether to enter a protective order lies within
the sound discretion of the court.  (Raymond
Handling Concepts Corp. v. Superior Court (1995) 39
Cal.App.4th 584, 588, 591; Meritplan Insurance Co. v. Superior Court (1981)
124 Cal.App.3d 237, 242.)  Moving parties have the burden to show good
cause for protective order.  (Emerson Electric Co. v. Superior Court (1997)
16 Cal.4th 1101, 1110.)   
 
          Discussion
Defendants’ motion for
protective order is granted.  Defendants
met their burden to demonstrate they need protection from Plaintiff’s overbroad
deposition subpoena to Hanmi Bank.  
Defendants attached the
deposition subpoena to Hanmi Bank that requests financial information
for all accounts held in the name of Kenneth individually or jointly with any
other person or entity.  (See
Decl. of Yang ¶3, Exh. A at Attach. 3.) 
Plaintiff’s deposition subpoena is overbroad because it does not limit
the information sought to matters involving the Yongsusan restaurant.
 Plaintiff’s deposition subpoena invites
the potential overreach of private financial information of third parties who
may share a joint account with Kenneth unrelated to the Yongsusan restaurant.  Here, Plaintiff has not demonstrated a
compelling need for discovery that is so strong it outweighs third parties’
privacy rights.  (Lantz v. Superior
Court (1994) 28 Cal.App.4th 1839, 1853.)  
Defendants’ proposed
protective order also seeks to limit financial information from other accounts
held by Kenneth or KGR alone because such information is not limited to
Yongsusan restaurant and its business.  Plaintiff’s deposition subpoena regarding
Kenneth’s and KGR’s individual accounts must therefore be limited to matters
involving Yongsusan restaurant and its business.  (Binder v. Superior Court (1987) 196
Cal. App.3d 893, 900 [requiring “careful balancing” of the “compelling public
need” for discovery against the “fundamental right of privacy.”].)  Such matters relevant to Yongsusan restaurant
and its business involve the Property at issue in the instant case.
Overall, Plaintiff will not
suffer prejudice from limiting the deposition subpoena to financial information
for all accounts held in the name of Kenneth individually or jointly with any
other person or entity related to matters involving the Yongsusan restaurant.
However, Defendants’ proposed
protective order requests this Court strike Categories 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,
9, 10, 13, and 14 in the deposition subpoena to Hanmi Bank.  (See Proposed Order.)  The request to strike these categories is
unnecessary in light of the fact that such information sought is limited to
matters involving the Yongsusan restaurant.
Based on the foregoing, Defendants’
unopposed motion for protective order is granted in part and denied in
part.
 
Conclusion
Defendants’ unopposed
motion for a protective order is granted in part and denied in part.
Moving
Party to give notice.
