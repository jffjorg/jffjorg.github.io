  Case Number:  23STCV20031    Hearing Date:   July 19, 2024    Dept:  71 Superior  Court of California County of Los Angeles   DEPARTMENT 71   AMENDED TENTATIVE RULING      LILIT KESHISHYAN et al.,               vs.   HG LAW, APC, et al.    Case No.:     23STCV20031        Hearing    Date:  March 19, 2024      Defendants HG Law APC’s and Hyka A.  Karapetian’s demurrer to Plaintiffs Lilit Keshishyan’s and Levon Ehtibaryan’s first  amended complaint is sustained with 20 days leave to amend. Defendants  HG Law APC’s and Hyka A. Karapetian’s motion to strike is denied as moot.    Defendants HG Law APC (“HG Law”) and Hyka H. Karapetian (“Karapetian”)  (collectively, “Defendants”) demur to Plaintiffs Lilit Keshishyan’s (“Keshishyan”) and Levon  Ehtibaryan’s (“Ehtibaryan”) (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) first amended  complaint (“FAC”).  (Notice of Demurrer, pg. 2; C.C.P. §§430.10  et seq.)  Defendants also move to strike  portions of the FAC.  (Notice of MTS, pg.  2.)   Request for Judicial Notice Defendants’ 2/13/24 request for judicial notice of Plaintiffs’  initial complaint is denied, as the Court does not need to take judicial notice  of filings on the instant docket.   Background Plaintiffs filed their initial Complaint on August 22, 2023.  On November 17, 2023, Plaintiffs filed the  operative FAC against Defendants alleging five causes of action: (1) legal  malpractice; (2) breach of fiduciary duty; (3) fraud and deceit; (4) breach of  contract; and (5) violation of Penal Code §496. This action arises out of Plaintiffs retaining HG Law on June 28,  2017, to represent them regarding a June 27, 2017, auto collision that occurred  in Glendale, California, for a personal injury action against Commercial Waste  Services Inc. and its driver, Ramon Alcantara.  (FAC ¶¶18-19.)  Plaintiffs  allege they each executed separate Client Services Agreements for the retention  of Defendants in the personal injury action, and Defendants did not disclose or  advise Plaintiffs of any potential conflict(s) of interest with respect to the  firm’s representation of multiple parties in the same action, and Defendants  did not present or obtain Plaintiffs’ informed written consent to joint  representation despite the potential for conflict(s) of interest arising from  such joint representation.  (FAC ¶¶20-21.) On February 13, 2024, Defendants filed the instant demurrer and  motion to strike.  On March 13, 2024,  Plaintiffs filed their combined opposition.[1]  On March 18, 2023,  Defendants filed a reply.   A.    Demurrer Summary of Demurrer Defendants demur to Plaintiffs’ 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th causes  of action.  Defendants demur on the basis  that Plaintiff’s 1st, 2nd, 4th, and 5th causes of action are barred by the  statute of limitations.  (Demurrer, pgs. 2-4;  C.C.P. §430.10(e).)  Defendants demur on  the basis that Plaintiffs’ 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 5th causes of action fail to  state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against Defendants.  (Demurrer, pgs. 2-4; C.C.P. §430.10(e).)  Defendants demur on the basis all of  Plaintiffs’ causes of action are uncertain.   (Demurrer, pgs. 2-4; C.C.P. §430.10(f).)   Finally, Defendants demur on the basis the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th causes  of action are duplicative.  (Demurrer,  pgs. 2-4; Kracht v. Perrin, Gartland & Doyle (1990) 219 Cal.App.3d  1019, 1022-1023; Loube v. Loube (1998) 64 Cal.App.4th 421, 429-431; Award  Metals, Inc. v. Superior Court (1991) 228 Cal.App.3d 1128, 1135.)             Meet and Confer Before filing a demurrer pursuant to this chapter, the demurring  party shall meet and confer in person, by telephone, or by video conference  with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the  purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve  the objections to be raised in the demurrer.   (C.C.P. §430.41(a), emphasis added.)   A declaration must be filed with a demurrer regarding the results of the  meet and confer process.  (C.C.P.  §430.41(a)(3).) Defendants’ counsel declares that on October 17, 2023, she called  Plaintiffs’ counsel twice and reached an answering service both times.  (Decl. of Koshkaryan ¶4.)  Defendants’ counsel declares that on October  27, 2023, after emailing Plaintiffs’ counsel a meet and confer letter, she met  and conferred on the telephone with Plaintiffs’ counsel.  (Decl. of Koshkaryan ¶¶5-6, Exhs. A.)  Defendants’ counsel declares that on December  19, 2023, she again met and conferred with Plaintiffs’ counsel and discussed  their meet and confer issued and parties were unable to come to an  agreement.  (See Decl. of Koshkaryan  ¶7.)  Defendants’ counsel’s declaration  is sufficient under C.C.P. §430.41(a).   Accordingly, the Court will consider the instant demurrer.   Legal Standard “[A] demurrer tests the legal  sufficiency of the allegations in a complaint.” (Lewis v. Safeway, Inc.  (2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 385, 388.)  A  demurrer can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the  pleading under attack or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially  noticeable.  (See Donabedian v.  Mercury Insurance Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994 [in ruling on a  demurrer, a court may not consider declarations, matters not subject to  judicial notice, or documents not accepted for the truth of their  contents].)  For purposes of ruling on a  demurrer, all facts pleaded in a complaint are assumed to be true, but the  reviewing court does not assume the truth of conclusions of law.  (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital District  (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 967.)             Statute of  Limitations C.C.P. §340.6 provides in part, “[a]n action against an attorney  for a wrongful act or omission, other than for actual fraud, arising in the  performance of professional services shall be commenced within one year  after the plaintiff discovers, or through the use of reasonable diligence  should have discovered, the facts constituting the wrongful act or omission,  whichever occurs first.”  (C.C.P. §340.6(a),  emphasis added.) Plaintiffs allege that on June 28, 2017, they retained Defendants  to represent them regarding the auto collision in a personal injury action  against Commercial Waste Services Inc. and its driver, Ramon Alcantara.  (FAC ¶19.)   Plaintiffs allege on or about June 26, 2019, Defendants, on behalf of  Plaintiffs, filed a personal injury action in Los Angeles Superior Court, which  was assigned Case Number 19STCV22401, Lilit Keshishyan, et al. v. Ramon  Alcantara, et al. (“Personal Injury Action”).  (FAC ¶22.) Plaintiffs allege on August 15, 2022, Plaintiff Keshishyan saw  that the Court’s Register of Actions reflected a Request for Dismissal had been  filed in June 2022.  (FAC ¶31.)  Plaintiffs allege Plaintiff Keshishyan did  not understand what it meant that a Request for Dismissal had been filed in the  case, and immediately texted Defendant Karapetian and referenced the dismissal  and asked for an update on the case.  (FAC ¶31.)   Plaintiffs allege Defendant Karapetian replied, indicating disbursement  is not finalized, that she had arrived back in the country on August 9, 2022,  that she had caught Covid, and explained she would call Plaintiffs “as soon as everything  is finalized,” although Defendant Karapetian did not explain the status or what  she meant by “everything” or what was actually being “finalized.”  (FAC ¶31.)   Plaintiffs allege she also did not explain what it meant that a Request  for Dismissal had been filed.  (FAC ¶31.) Plaintiffs allege during the meeting at Defendants’ office on  August 23, 2022, Defendant Karapetian finally disclosed that she had settled  Plaintiffs’ personal injury action for $80,000.00 on or around June 15, 2022.  (FAC ¶34.)   Plaintiffs allege she also informed Plaintiffs that she had signed the  written release agreement memorializing the terms of the settlement on behalf  of Plaintiffs and confirmed that the Request for Dismissal filed in June 2022  had been filed “with prejudice” and therefore had fully and completely disposed  of the Personal Injury Action.  (FAC  ¶34.) The one-year limitations period for professional negligence, at a  minimum, was triggered on August 15, 2022, by Plaintiffs’ discovery of the  facts constituting the alleged act or omission, i.e., the filing of the request  for dismissal without their knowledge or consent. The one-year limitations  period is triggered by Plaintiffs’ discovery of the facts constituting the  alleged act or omission, not “by his discovery that such facts constitute  professional negligence, i.e. by discovery that a particular legal theory is  applicable based on the known facts.”  (Peregrine  Funding, Inc. v. Sheppard Mullin (2005) 133 Cal.App.4th 658, 684; see Laird v. Blacker (1992) 2 Cal.4th 606, 609 [holding C.C.P. §340.6(a)’s one-year-from-discovery  limitation period commences when he or she suffers an adverse judgment or  dismissal in the underlying action].)   The Court views the FAC as alleging at least 2 distinct wrongful  acts by defendants: 1) causing plaintiff’s suit against Commercial Waste  Services Inc. and its driver, Ramon Alcantara, to be dismissed without  plaintiff’s consent; and 2) not dispersing the settlement pursuant to the  settlement terms.  The Court agrees that  the one-year statute of limitations as to the first act ran on August 15, 2023,  when plaintiffs discovered that the matter had been dismissed.  As to the second act, however, the Court finds  that the statute for that did not run until August 23, 2023, such that  plaintiffs’ present action would be timely filed.    The Court finds that plaintiffs’ current complaint does not adequately  distinguish between these two acts, rendering it uncertain.  Accordingly, Defendants’ demurrer to  Plaintiffs’ 1st, 2nd, 4th, and 5th causes of action is sustained 20 days leave  to amend.                      Failure to State  a Claim           Fraud (3rd COA) “The elements of fraud that will give rise to a tort action for  deceit are: ‘(a) misrepresentation (false representation, concealment, or  nondisclosure); (b) knowledge of falsity (or ‘scienter’); (c) intent to  defraud, i.e., to induce reliance; (d) justifiable reliance; and (e) resulting  damage.’”  (Engalla v. Permanente  Medical Group, Inc. (1997) 15 Cal.4th 951, 974, internal quotation marks  omitted.)  “The specificity requirement means a plaintiff  must allege facts showing how, when, where, to whom, and by what means the  representations were made, and, in the case of a corporate defendant, the  plaintiff must allege the names of the persons who made the representations,  their authority to speak on behalf of the corporation, to whom they spoke, what  they said or wrote, and when the representation was made.”  (Lazar v. Superior Court (1996) 12  Cal.4th 631, 645; West v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (2013) 214 Cal.App.4th  780, 793.) Plaintiffs allege they repeatedly trusted Defendants to represent  them competently and to abide by rules of professional conduct including but  not limited to communication and zealous representation and acting in client’s  best interests; however, Defendants failed to advise Plaintiffs of potential or  actual conflicts of interest and ultimately acted in its own best interest.  (FAC ¶69.) Plaintiffs allege Defendants settled the matter of Lilit  Keshishyan, et al. v. Ramon Alcantara, et al. on or around June 15, 2022,  without communicating offers or obtaining authorization of Plaintiffs, and each  of them, for such settlement or disbursement.   (FAC ¶70.)  Plaintiffs allege as  of August 15, 2022, Defendant Karapetian had still never communicated any settlement  offers to either Plaintiff Keshishyan or Plaintiff Ehtibaryan, nor had she sought  or obtained either Plaintiffs’ authorization to accept any settlement offers on  behalf of either of the Plaintiffs.  (FAC  ¶71.) Plaintiffs allege on August 22, 2022, after not having received  any updates from their many inquiries, nor any explanation of the significance  of a Request for Dismissal having been filed in June 2022, Plaintiff Keshishyan  again texted Defendant Karapetian and asked to meet with her at her office the  next day to finally receive a status on their case.  (FAC ¶72.)   Plaintiffs allege it was not until August 23, 2023, during the meeting  at Defendants’ office that Defendant Karapetian finally disclosed that she had  settled Plaintiffs’ personal injury action for $80,000.00 on or around June 15,  2022.  (FAC ¶73.)  Plaintiffs allege she also informed  Plaintiffs that she had signed the written release agreement memorializing the  terms of the settlement on behalf of Plaintiffs and confirmed that the Request  for Dismissal filed in June 2022 had been filed “with prejudice” and therefore  had fully and completely disposed of the personal injury action.  (FAC ¶73.)    Plaintiffs allege accordingly, pursuant to such release agreement  and dismissal with prejudice, Plaintiffs were bound to the terms of the  settlement agreement despite the fact that neither of them had ever received  any communication from Defendants informing them of any settlement offer either  in terms of amount(s) offered or other terms, nor had either of them ever been  consulted regarding whether either or both of them were in agreement with the settlement  amount or other associated terms.  (FAC  ¶74.) Plaintiffs allege in addition to the contingency-based attorneys’  fees totaling $26,400 for resolving the personal injury action, Defendant  Karapetian took $35,000 of the remaining settlement funds as compensation to  Defendants for legal services rendered in an unrelated matter handled on behalf  of Plaintiff Ehtibaryan in 2017, a matter for which Plaintiff Keshishyan was  not a party.  (FAC ¶75.)  Plaintiffs allege Defendant Karapetian  explained to Plaintiffs that she would be disbursing the settlement funds in  larger portion to Plaintiff EHTIBARYAN because of the amount Plaintiff  Ehtibaryan allegedly owed to Defendants for the 2017 Matter, despite the fact  that the Settlement Agreement in Plaintiffs’ personal injury action actually  specified that $45,000 of the settlement funds would go to Plaintiff Keshishyan  and $35,000 of the settlement funds would go to Plaintiff Ehtibaryan.  (FAC ¶76.) Plaintiffs allege upon receipt of their file, Plaintiffs  discovered that Defendants had forged a Promissory Note dated July 13, 2019,  purporting that Plaintiff Ehtibaryan promised to pay Hyka Galazhyan $30,000  within thirty days of receipt of payment for resolution of the Personal Injury Action,  which Plaintiff Ehtibaryan denies.  (FAC  ¶77.)  Plaintiffs allege Plaintiff  Ehtibaryan denies having ever made such covenant or promise and denies the  validity of such document or the terms thereof.   (FAC ¶77.)   Plaintiffs allege they reasonably relied on Defendants’ material  misrepresentations of competency, good faith, and communications, and depended  on Defendants to advise them of an settlement offers and appropriately advise  them of potential or actual conflicts, settlement offers, and make legally  sound recommendations in Plaintiffs’ best interest, but Defendants failed to  obtain Plaintiffs’ agreement to the settlement of their case and signed the settlement  agreement on behalf of Plaintiffs, and each of them, on or around June 15, 2022  and without their authorization.  (FAC  ¶78.) Plaintiffs allege they suffered actual financial damages when, in  addition to the contingency based attorneys’ fees totaling $26,400 for  resolving the personal injury action, Defendant Karapetian took $35,000 of the  remaining settlement funds as compensation to Defendants for legal services  rendered in an unrelated matter handled on behalf of Plaintiff Ehtibaryan in  2017, a matter for which Plaintiff Keshishyan was not a party.  (FAC ¶79.)   Plaintiffs allege Plaintiff Keshishyan’s settlement portion was $45,000,  from which attorney’s fees of 33% were $14,850, litigation costs were $650, and  associated liens were resolved with a balance due of $2,100; therefore,  Plaintiff Keshishyan should have received $27,400.  (FAC ¶80.)   Plaintiffs allege based on Plaintiff Ehtibaryan’s settlement portion for  $35,000, from which attorney’s fees of 33% were $11,550, litigation costs were  $250, and associated liens were resolved with a balance due of $1,500;  therefore, Plaintiff Ehtibaryan should have received $21,700.  (FAC ¶80.) Plaintiffs allege as a result of Defendants’ intentional  misconduct, Plaintiffs were injured personally, and suffered extreme and severe  emotional distress, including betrayal of trust Plaintiffs had placed in  Defendants and accordingly is entitled to an award of economic and noneconomic damages  for emotional distress.  (FAC ¶81.) Plaintiffs fail to allege, with the requisite specificity, each  Defendants’ knowledge of falsity (or ‘scienter’), intent to defraud, i.e., to  induce reliance; justifiable reliance, and resulting damage from the allegation  that Defendants forged a promissory note dated July 13, 2019.  (FAC ¶77; Engalla, 15 Cal.4th at pg.  974, internal quotation marks omitted.) With regard to Plaintiffs’ allegation of Defendants’ nondisclosure  of potential or actual conflicts of interest or the concealment of the  settlement offers, Plaintiffs fail to allege with the requisite specificity each  Defendants’ scienter, intent to induce reliance.  Accordingly, Defendants’ demurrer to Plaintiffs’ 3rd cause of  action is sustained with 20 days leave to amend. Conclusion Defendants’ demurrer to Plaintiffs’ FAC is sustained with  20 days leave to amend. Moving Party to give notice.   B.     Motion to Strike In  light of the Court’s ruling on the demurrer, Defendants’ motion to strike is  denied as moot.     Dated:  March _____, 2024
