   [1] The Court notes that Defendants’ counsel is  discouraged from filing combined oppositions with combined arguments to two  different motions.  Defendants’ counsel’s  oppositions do not separate out arguments pertaining to the demurrer and the  motion to strike in an organized manner, which wastes judicial resources.  It is not the case that arguments for a  motion to strike also apply to a demurrer—issues such as attorneys’ fees and  punitive damages are to be raised only on a motion to strike.
