[1] The Court notes Plaintiff has only made four
reservations for the six motions on calendar for today.  Each motion requires an individual
reservation made through the court reservation system (“CRS”) that requires a
$60.00 fee per reservation.  Plaintiff
owes this Court $120.00 in fees for the two reservations it failed to make in
the CRS.  The instant ruling is not
effective until Plaintiff makes its payment to this Court.
