BACKGROUND
 
On December 12, 2023, Plaintiff James
Rutherford filed this action for violation of the Unruh Civil Rights Act
because of alleged architectural barriers in violation of the ADA at Four Joy’s
facilities. 
 
On May 20, 2024, Four Joy filed its First
Amended Cross-Complaint against DBIK Construction & Design, Inc., DC
International Design & Construction, Inc., Angel Development, Inc., and
Does 1 through 20. Four Joy filed the instant Motion to Serve Summons and
Complaint on DBIK Construction & Design, Inc. and DC International Design
& Construction, Inc. through the California Secretary of State on February
27, 2024. To date, no opposition to the Motion has been filed. The motion
alleges DBIK Construction and DC International are owned and controlled by the
same individuals.
 
On July 2, 2024, DBIK Construction filed
an answer to Four Joy’s First Amended Cross-Complaint. To date, the Court has
not received papers from DC International.
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
Four Joy Investment, LLC’s Motion
to Serve Summons and Complaint on DBIK Construction & Design, Inc. is MOOT.

 
Four Joy Investment, LLC’s Motion
to Serve Summons and Complaint on DC International Design &
Construction, Inc. through the Secretary of State is GRANTED.
 
LEGAL STANDARD
 
Code of Civil Procedure section
416.10 provides that a summons may be served on a corporation, if authorized,
by any provision in Corporations Code sections 1701, 1702, 2110 or 2111. Under
Corporations Code section 1702, this includes by hand delivery “to the
Secretary of State, or to any person employed in the Secretary of State’s office
in the capacity of assistant or deputy.” (Cal. Corp. Code, § 1702, subd. (a).)
Service on the Secretary of State’s Office is permitted if the corporation’s
agent “cannot with reasonable diligence be found at the address designated for
personally delivering the process . . . and it is shown by affidavit to the
satisfaction of the court that process against a domestic corporation cannot be
served with reasonable diligence upon the designated agent.” (Cal. Corp. Code,
§ 1702, subd. (a).)
 
DISCUSSION
 
As to DBIK Construction, it filed
its verified answer on July 2, 2024. The Court will regard the motion regarding
DBIK Construction as moot, and accept the verified answer from DBIK
Construction. Four Joy’s motion alleges, and Secretary of State Statement of
Information exhibits show, DBIK Construction and DC International have the same
address and officers. (Ho Decl., Exh. 1.) However, DBIK Construction’s answer
does not mention DC International. The first page of the answer shows the
attorneys only represent DBIK Construction. Therefore, DBIK Construction’s
answer does not render Four Joy’s motion as moot as to DC International.
 
As to DC International, Four Joy
has demonstrated by affidavit its inability to serve DC International despite
reasonable diligence. The only available address for DC International is 13208
Graystone Ave., Norwalk, CA 90650. (Ho Decl. ¶¶2-3, Exhs. 1-2.) Defendant’s
registered process server made seven attempts to serve DC International at the
Graystone Avenue address. (Ho Decl. ¶3, Exh. 2.) 
 
Therefore, Four Joy has
demonstrated DC International’s agent “cannot with reasonable diligence be
found at the address designated for personally delivering the process . . . and
it is shown by affidavit to the satisfaction of the court that process against
a domestic corporation cannot be served with reasonable diligence upon the
designated agent.”
 
CONCLUSION
 
Four Joy Investment, LLC’s Motion
to Serve Summons and Complaint on DBIK Construction & Design, Inc. is MOOT.

 
Four Joy Investment, LLC’s Motion
to Serve Summons and Complaint on DC International Design &
Construction, Inc. through the Secretary of State is GRANTED.
PROOF OF SERVICE OF THE SUMMONS AND COMPLAINT IS TO BE FILED WITHIN 20 DAYS OF
THIS ORDER.
