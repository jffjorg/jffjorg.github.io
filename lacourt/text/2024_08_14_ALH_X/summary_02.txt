And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by the Partition Referee, Matthew L. Taylor, regarding the approval of his fees and costs, as well as the distribution of the remaining sale proceeds from the sale of a property. The property was sold for $1,700,000, and after deducting sale-related costs and mortgage payments, the remaining funds are $1,442,533.80.

The Referee is seeking approval of his fees and costs, which total $19,349.00. The judge has granted the Referee's motion to approve his fees and costs, finding them to be reasonable.

The Referee is also seeking instructions regarding the disposition of the remaining sale proceeds. The judge has ordered that the proceeds be distributed among the co-owners of the property according to their proportionate ownership interests, as recommended by the Referee.

The co-owners are to receive the following amounts: Raquel and Jesse (33.75%), Richard and Esther (33.75%), Alex, Fabiola, Juan, Salvador, and Yolanda (8.75%), and Corrina, Veronica, Vanessa, and Gilbert (0.625%).
