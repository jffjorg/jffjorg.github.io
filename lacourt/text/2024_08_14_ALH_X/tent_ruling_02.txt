RELIEF
REQUESTED 
 
            Partition Referee
Matthew L. Taylor moves (1) to approve his referee fees and to discharge and
(2) for instructions regarding disposition of the remaining property sale
proceeds held by him.
 
BACKGROUND
 
This
is a suit for partition by sale of the real property located at 6229 Kaufman
Avenue, Temple City, California (“Property”). The Property had 13
co-owners. 
 
On
September 7, 2023, the Court entered interlocutory judgment which determined
that partition of real property was appropriate and appointed Matthew L. Taylor
as Partition Referee to sell the Subject Property. Thereafter, the Referee
hired real estate agents to market and sell the Property. (09/07/23
Interlocutory Judgment for Partition by Sale.) The Court reserved jurisdiction
over the distribution of the sale proceeds pursuant to CCP § 873.850. (Id. ¶
25.)
 
On
January 8, 2024, sale of the Property for $1,700,000 was approved by the court.
(01/08/24 Minute Order.)
 
Following
payment of sale-related costs and payment of the mortgage, the Referee received
a total of $1,442,533.80 from the sale. (Exh. 1.) The funds are ready to be
distributed. 
 
First,
the Referee’s motion seeks an order approving the payment of his fees. Second,
the motion seeks instructions as to disposition of the funds being held by the
Referee. Concurrently filed with the motion is the Referee’s Report and
Recommendation, where he recommends dividing the money amongst the co-owners
based on the proportional interest of each party.
 
No
opposition has been filed.
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
            The
Referee’s motion to recover fees and costs are GRANTED. 
 
The Referee’s motion for an order
regarding distribution of sale proceeds is GRANTED. 
 
LEGAL STANDARD
 
CCP section 1023 provides, “[t]he
fees of referees are such reasonable sum as the court may fix for the time
spent in the business of the reference; but the parties may agree, in writing,
upon any other rate of compensation, and thereupon such rates shall be
allowed.” (CCP § 1023.)
 
CCP section 873.820 provides,
“[t]he proceeds of sale for any property sold shall be applied in the following
order: [¶] (a) Payment of the expenses of sale. [¶] (b) Payment of the other
costs of partition in whole or in part or to secure any cost of partition later
allowed. [¶] (c) Payment of any liens on the property in their order of
priority except liens which under the terms of sale are to remain on the
property. [¶] (d) Distribution of the residue among the parties in proportion
to their shares as determined by the court.”
 
DISCUSSION
 
I.               
Referee’s Fees and
Costs
 
The Referee seeks approval of his fees and submits his fees incurred in
this matter in the amount of $19,349.00. Plaintiffs submit total costs and fees
in the amount of $34,334.15. His declaration notes the request seeks
estimated fees associated with the instant motion and past fees. (Taylor Decl.
¶ 4.) His request for fees includes an
estimated 6 hours of future time to disburse the money to the owners, and the
estimate is based on his experience in past cases. (Taylor Decl. ¶ 5.) The Referee claims that his billable
rate for this matter is $300.00 per hour, his associates are billed at $225 per
hour, and his clerk is billed at $45 per hour. (Id.) Exhibit 3 is an
itemized invoice for these fees which supports his declaration. (Taylor Decl.
¶ 4, Exh. 3.) No portion of his fees
have been paid. (Taylor Decl. ¶ 4.)

 
The Court finds that the Referee’s request for fees and costs to be reasonable.
The Referee’s motion to apportion attorneys’ fees and costs in the amount of
$19,349.00 is therefore GRANTED.
 
II.            
Order for
Distribution of Sale Proceeds
 
The Referee determined that the relative interest of each co-owner party
is as follows: 
 
33.75% - Plaintiff Raquel McMurtrey - $477,764.47
33.75% - Defendant Jesse Ramirez - $477,764.47
8.75% - Defendant Richard Ramirez - $128,818.24
8.75% - Defendant Esther Guerra - $128,818.24
2.5% - Defendant Alex Ramirez - $35,398.96
2.5% - Defendant Fabiola Ramirez - $35,398.96
2.5% - Defendant Juan Ramirez - $35,398.96
2.5% - Defendant Salvador Ramirez - $35,398.96
2.5% - Defendant Yolanda Ramirez - $35,398.96
0.625% - Defendant Corrina Ramirez - $8,847.49
0.625% - Defendant Veronica Ramirez - $8,847.49
0.625% - Defendant Vanessa Ramirez - $8,847.49
0.625% - Defendant Gilbert Ramirez, Jr. - $8,847.49
 
After deducting the Referee’s fees of $19,349.00, the remaining funds
with Referee should be apportioned to the co-owners according to their
proportionate ownership interests. The Court orders that the allocations shall
be made to co-owners of the Property according to Referee’s recommendation
above: $477,764.47 to Raquel and Jesse; $128,818.24 to Richard and Esther;
$35,398.96 to Alex, Fabiola, Juan, Salvador, and Yolando; $8,847.49 to Corrina,
Veronica, Vanessa, and Gilbert.
 
CONCLUSION
 
The Referee’s motion to apportion attorneys’ fees and costs in the amount
of $19,349.00 is therefore GRANTED.
 
The Court orders that distribution of the remaining sale proceeds shall
be allocated to co-owners of the Property according to Referee’s above
recommendation.
