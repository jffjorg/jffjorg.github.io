Roles:
- Judge: [Name of Judge]
Significant Statements:
- "The doctrine of equitable estoppel authorizes a nonsignatory defendant [to] invoke an arbitration clause [in a contract] to compel a signatory plaintiff to arbitrate its claims when the causes of action against the nonsignatory are intimately founded in and intertwined with the underlying contract obligations." - JSM Tuscany, LLC v. Sup.Ct. (2011) 193 Cal.App.4th 1222
- "All the precedents -- Ford Motor, Montemayor, Kielar, and Yeh -- say the opposite. Those precedents control. They render the doctrine of equitable estoppel off limits to a car manufacturer." - Judge's finding in this case
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The court grants the motion for reconsideration and vacates the order compelling arbitration. The court finds that the doctrine of equitable estoppel does not apply in this case, as the majority of courts have disagreed with the holding in Felisilda v. FCA US LLC (2020) 53 Cal.App.5th 486. The court also finds that the defendant, Ford Motor Company, is not a third-party beneficiary of the sales contract and therefore cannot enforce the arbitration clause. The court concludes that the defendant's motion to compel arbitration is denied.
