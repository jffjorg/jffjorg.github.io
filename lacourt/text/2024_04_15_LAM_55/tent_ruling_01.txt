  Case Number:  22STCV13042    Hearing Date:   April 15, 2024    Dept:  55 NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS:
Motion to be Relieved as Attorney of Record for Defendant.
 
Jerrin McGhee et al. (Plaintiffs) filed this case against
CULVER CITY CHEVROLET (Defendant). Now, counsel moves to be relieved as
attorney of record for Defendant, by declaring that there has been a breakdown
in the attorney-client relationship.
“The determination whether to grant or deny an
attorney 's motion to withdraw as counsel of record lies within the sound
discretion of the trial court, having in mind whether such withdrawal might
work an injustice in the handling of the case.” Lempert v. Sup. Ct.
(2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 1161, 1173. 
Here, the form notice, declaration, proposed order,
and proof of service on the client sufficiently comply with the requirements
for a motion to be relieved as counsel. See
Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362. Further, moving counsel’s declaration shows a
cognizable ground for withdrawal: 

Breakdown
     in the attorney-client relationship (or personality clash). Estate of
     Falco v. Decker (1987) 188 Cal.App.3d 1004, 1014.

Finally, no opposing document has been filed showing
any prejudice to the client. See
Rules Prof. Conduct, rule 1.16(d). 
Therefore, the motion is granted, and the Court will
sign the proposed order submitted by counsel. The Court sets an OSC regarding setting
aside Defendant’s answer and entering default for Defendant’s failure to obtain
counsel. The OSC is set for 5/22/24 at 8:30 a.m.
