 Case Number:  22STCV34350    Hearing Date:   April 15, 2024    Dept:  55  
NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS:  Plaintiffs’ Motion for Sanctions, Including
Terminating Sanctions, Against Defendants, Yoon Hee Yeh aka Charles Y. Yeh and
Kyeung Suk Yeh aka Christine K. Yeh.
 
BACKGROUND
WATERS, LLC and WATERS & RUSS, LLC (“Plaintiffs”)
filed a Complaint against YOON HEE YEH and KYEUNG SUK YEH (“Defendants”), alleging
that they breached the terms of their personal guaranty by failing to pay past
due debts, including rent owed under a lease with non-party HYUNDAE CAR WASH,
INC.  The cause of action is Breach of a
Personal Guaranty.
Plaintiffs bring a motion requesting the Court impose
terminating or evidentiary sanctions, and $2,760.00 in monetary sanctions, because
Defendants did not comply with the Court’s 2/7/24 order compelling responses to
Plaintiffs’ form interrogatories. Defendants oppose the motion.  
LEGAL STANDARD
Ultimate discovery sanctions are justified where there
is a willful discovery-order violation, a history of abuse, and evidence
showing that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with discovery
rules. Van Sickle v. Gilbert (2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 1495, 1516.
Generally, monetary sanctions are mandatory as to
parties losing discovery motions, unless courts find substantial justification
or other injustice. E.g.,  Foothill
Properties v. Lyon/Copley Corona Assocs., L.P. (1996) 46 Cal.App.4th
1542, 1557-58. “ ‘[S]ubstantial justification” has been understood to mean that
a justification is clearly reasonable because it is well-grounded in both law
and fact.” Doe v. U.S. Swimming, Inc. (2011) 200 Cal.App.4th 1424,
1434.  “If the party seeking a monetary
sanction meets its burden of proof, the burden shifts to the opposing party
attempting to avoid a monetary sanction to show that it acted with ‘substantial
justification.’ ”  Ibid., at p. 1435.
ANALYSIS
Plaintiffs sufficiently show that Defendants failed to
answer all the form interrogatories propounded by Plaintiffs and to verify the
responses. Defendants’ opposition shows only one Defendant’s verification and
both Defendants’ responses fail to respond to Form Interrogatories Nos. 15 and
50.1 through 50.6. Even accepting that Defendant Yoon Hee Yeh signed his
verification to the responses, Defendants’ further responses remain woefully inadequate
in terms of complying with this Court’s 2/7/24 order. 
As a matter of calendar management, courts have
discretion as to whether to continue a motion and allow supplemental documents, or to decide a motion on the existing documents.
Farber v. Bay View Terrace Homeowners Assn. (2006) 141 Cal. App. 4th
1007, 1015. The Court continues the motion to give Defendants one more
opportunity to comply with the California Discovery Act by serving verified,
complete further responses to the form interrogatories propounded by Plaintiffs.
If Defendants continue to misuse the discovery process by not complying, they
run the very real risk that the Court will grant the terminating, evidentiary,
and/or monetary sanctions requested by Plaintiffs.
The motion hearing is continued to 4/19/24 at 8:30
a.m.
A supplemental opposition may be served and filed by 4/17/24.
A supplemental reply may be served and filed by close of business (5:00 p.m.)
on 4/18/24. In addition, if Defendants have new counsel representing them in
this case, such counsel must file a substitution of counsel form in order to represent
Defendants at the 4/15/24 and 4/19/24 hearings in this case.
