And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court is considering a motion by Plaintiffs, WATERS, LLC and WATERS & RUSS, LLC, to impose terminating or evidentiary sanctions and $2,760.00 in monetary sanctions against Defendants, YOON HEE YEH and KYEUNG SUK YEH, for their failure to comply with the court's February 7, 2024 order compelling responses to Plaintiffs' form interrogatories. The court finds that Plaintiffs have sufficient evidence to justify the imposition of sanctions. The court grants Defendants one more opportunity to comply with the discovery process, and if they continue to misuse the process, they risk being granted terminating, evidentiary, and/or monetary sanctions. The motion hearing is continued to April 19, 2024 at 8:30 a.m., with a deadline for supplemental opposition by April 17, 2024, and a deadline for supplemental reply by close of business on April 18, 2024.
