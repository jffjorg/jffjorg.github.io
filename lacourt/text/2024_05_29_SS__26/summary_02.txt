And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge denies the plaintiff, American Contractors Indemnity Company (Judgment Creditor),'s motion for an assignment order against Francis Edwin Azevedo (Judgment Debtor). The motion seeks to assign payments made to Ed's Custom Truck Bodies, Inc. to Judgment Creditor, or to assign payments made out of Ed's Custom's account(s) to Judgment Debtor to Judgment Creditor. The judge also denies the request for a turnover order, as the statute only allows for the assignment of "all or part of a right to payment due or to become due." The judge finds that there is no evidence to show which payments were made by Ed's Custom "to" Judgment Debtor in the sense that they were used by Judgment Debtor for himself, instead of for the company.
