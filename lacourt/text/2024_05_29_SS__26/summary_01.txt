English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the defendant's motion to vacate the entry of default. The defendant, Jack Saiege, argues that the service of process was improper because he was served at a post office box in West Hills, California, which is not his usual mailing address. The plaintiff, John Comer, argues that the service was proper because the post office box is a usual mailing address for Saiege's company, NJS Construction, Inc. The judge finds that the service was improper because Saiege did not use the post office box as his usual mailing address. The judge grants the motion and orders Saiege to file and serve a responsive pleading to the complaint within 20 days.
