guardian ad litem, Olivia C., v. West Covina Unified School District, et al. 
Petitioner Raymond Mena’s Petition
for Approval of Compromise of Claim or Action or
Disposition of Proceeds of Judgment for Minor or Person with a Disability 
TENTATIVE RULING 
The Court DENIES Petitioner Raymond Mena’s petition for minor’s compromise without prejudice. 
Petitioner is ordered to provide notice of the Court’s
ruling and file proof of service of same within five days of the Court’s order. 
BACKGROUND 
This is a dog bite case. On April 28, 2023, plaintiff
Alexis Mena (Claimant), a minor by and through her Guardian Ad Litem, Raymond
Mena (Petitioner), filed this action against defendants Jesus Romero, Maria
Romero (collectively, Defendants), and Does 1 to 25, alleging causes of action
for general negligence and strict liability. 
On December 21, 2023, Claimant filed a notice of
settlement. On October 11, 2024, Petitioner filed a petition for minor’s
compromise. The petition is unopposed. 
LEGAL STANDARD
Court approval is required for all settlements of a
minor's claim or that of a person lacking the capacity to make decisions.
(Prob. Code, §§ 2504, 3500, 3600 et seq.; Code Civ. Proc., § 372; see Pearson
v. Superior Court (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th 1333, 1337.) "[T]he
protective role the court generally assumes in cases involving minors, [is] a
role to assure that whatever is done is in the minor's best interests . . . .
[I]ts primary concern is whether the compromise is sufficient to provide for
the minor's injuries, care and treatment." (Goldberg v. Superior Court
(1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 1378, 1382.) 
A petition for court approval of a compromise under
Code of Civil Procedure section 372 must comply with California Rules of Court
Rules 7.950, 7.951, and 7.952. The petition must be verified by the petitioner
and contain a full disclosure of all information that has "any bearing
upon the reasonableness" of the compromise or the covenant. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 7.950.) The person compromising the claim on behalf of the person
who lacks capacity, and the represented person, must attend the hearing on compromise
of the claim unless the court for good cause dispenses with their personal
appearance. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.952(a).) An order for deposit of funds
of a minor or person lacking decision-making capacity and a petition for the
withdrawal of such funds must comply with California Rules of Court Rules 7.953
and 7.954. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1384; see also Super. Ct. L.A. County,
Local Rules, rules 4.115-4.118.)
DISCUSSION
Form MC-350 (Rev. January 1, 2021)
The Petition has been verified by Petitioner and
presented on a fully completed mandatory Judicial Council Form MC-350, using
the current January 1, 2021 revision. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.950.) 
Settlement 
Claimant has agreed
to settle this action against Defendants in exchange for $100,000.00, $48,182.06 of which
will go to Claimant. If approved, $40,000.00 will be paid in attorney’s fees, $5,274.98
will be paid for reimbursement of litigation costs advanced by Claimant’s
attorneys, and $6,542.96 will paid for medical expenses, leaving a balance of $48,182.06
for Claimant, to be deposited into a blocked account at Chase Bank. 
The Court has reviewed the
proposed settlement and finds the Petition contains a full disclosure of all
information that has any bearing upon the reasonableness of the settlement
amount to Claimant. 
Attorney's Fees 
The retained attorney's information
has been disclosed as required by Rule of Court 7.951. (Petition, ¶ 17, subd. (b).)
There is an agreement for services provided in connection with the underlying
claim. (Petition, ¶ 17, subd. (a)(2).) Copies of the agreements were submitted
with the Petition as strictly required by Rule of Court 7.951(6). (Attach.
17a.) 
Petitioner’s counsel seeks to
recover $40,000.00 in attorney's fees. (Petition, ¶ 13, subd. (a), Attach.
13a.) Counsel has provided a declaration addressing the reasonableness of the
fee request, as required by Rule 7.995, subdivision (c), of the California
Rules of Court, accounting for the factors specified in Rule 7.995, subdivision
(b), of the California Rules of Court. Rule 7.955, subdivision (b), provides:
(b) Factors the court may
consider in determining a reasonable attorney's fee. In determining a
reasonable attorney's fee, the court may consider the following nonexclusive
factors:
(1) The fact that a minor or
person with a disability is involved and the circumstances of that minor or
person with a disability.
(2) The amount of the fee in
proportion to the value of the services performed.
(3) The novelty and difficulty of
the questions involved and the skill required to perform the legal services
properly.
(4) The amount involved and the
results obtained.
(5) The time limitations or
constraints imposed by the representative of the minor or person with a
disability or by the circumstances.
(6) The nature and length of the
professional relationship between the attorney and the representative of the
minor or person with a disability.
(7) The experience, reputation,
and ability of the attorney or attorneys performing the legal services.
(8) The time and labor required.
(9) The informed consent of the
representative of the minor or person with a disability to the fee.
(10) The relative sophistication
of the attorney and the representative of the minor or person with a
disability.
(11) The likelihood, if apparent
to the representative of the minor or person with a disability when the
representation agreement was made, that the attorney's acceptance of the
particular employment would preclude other employment.
(12) Whether the fee is fixed,
hourly, or contingent.
(13) If the fee is contingent: 
(A) The risk of loss borne by the
attorney;
(B) The amount of costs advanced
by the attorney; and
(C) The delay in payment of fees
and reimbursement of costs paid by the attorney.
(14) Statutory requirements for
representation agreements applicable to particular cases or claims. 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.955, subd. (b).)
The Court addresses these factors below. 
Amount of Fee in Proportion to
Value of Services Performed 
Claimant's counsel contends that
a contingency fee of 40% of the sum recovered on behalf of the Claimant is
reasonable based on the amount of work performed in this case, and estimates
having performed more than 40 hours doing that work. (Attach. 13a, ¶¶ 5-6.) 
Novelty and Difficulty 
Claimant’s counsel does not
address the novelty or difficulty of this case. (See generally, Attach. 13a.) 
Amount Involved and Results
Obtained 
Claimant’s counsel states that
Defendants will pay a total of $100,000.00. (Attach. 13a, ¶ 3.) 
Nature and Length of Professional
Relationship 
Claimant’s counsel does not mention
the nature and length of the professional relationship with Claimant. (See
generally, Attach. 13a.) 
Experience, Reputation, and
Ability of Counsel 
Claimant’s counsel does not explain
his experience, reputation, or ability. (See generally, Attach. 13a.) 
Time and Labor Required 
Claimant’s counsel indicates
having spent more than 40 hours working on this case. (Attach. 13a, ¶ 6.) 
Acceptance of Case Precluding
Other Employment 
Claimant’s counsel does not
mention whether acceptance of this case precluded other employment. 
Contingent Fee 
Claimant’s counsel states this
case was taken on a contingency basis. (Attach. 13a, ¶ 2.) The contingency fee
amounts to 40%. (Attach. 13a, ¶ 4.) 
California Rules of Court, rule
7.955, "requires a trial court, in determining reasonable attorney fees,
to balance an attorney's interest in fair compensation with the protection of
the interests of a minor client. Thus, a trial court 'must give consideration
to the terms of any representation agreement made between the attorney and the
representative of the minor or person with a disability and must evaluate the
agreement based on the facts and circumstances existing at the time the
agreement was made.' " (Schulz v. Jeppesen Sanderson, Inc. (2018)
27 Cal.App.5th 1167, 1176-1177 (Schultz), quoting Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 7.955(a)(2).) 
The Court has considered the
factors listed in rule 7.955 and concludes that Claimant’s counsel has not
adequately demonstrated the reasonableness of the fee award in light of the
factors and circumstances in this case at the time the agreement was signed.
This appears to be a straightforward dog bite case that does not present any
unusual challenges. There was little to no risk that there would be no
recovery. The Court finds the 40% contingency fee excessive considering these
factors, as well as the amount of work expended in this case. (See Attach. 13a,
¶¶ 4, 6.) The Court further finds that an attorney's fee award of 33 1/3
percent of the gross settlement amount is reasonable in this case. 
Medical Bills 
Claimant has incurred $10,172.28 in
medical expenses, but the medical service providers have agreed to reduce their
liens to a total of $6,542.96. (Petition, ¶ 12, subds. (a)(1), (a)(5).) 
Costs 
Claimant’s counsel seeks to
recover $5,274.98 in costs that it advanced. (Petition, ¶ 13, subd. (b),
Attach. 13b.) 
Amount to Be Paid to Claimant 
The net amount to be paid to Claimant
is $48,182.06. (Petition, ¶ 15.) 
Disposition of Balance of
Proceeds 
Petitioner requests that the net
proceeds, $48,182.06, be deposited into a blocked account at Chase Bank. (Petition,
¶ 18, subd. (b)(2), Attach. 18b(2).) 
Court Appearance 
California Rule of Court 7.952
requires attendance by the petitioner and claimant unless the court for good
cause dispenses with their personal appearance. The Court finds that the
appearance of Claimant is not required due to Claimant’s status as a minor.
Petitioner must still appear for the hearing. 
Prognosis 
Claimant has not recovered
completely from the effects of the injuries, which left scarring. (Petition, ¶
8, subd. (c).) 
Order Approving Compromise of
Claim or Action or Disposition of Proceeds of Judgment for Minor or Person with
a Disability (MC-351) & Order to Deposit Funds in Blocked Account (MC-355) 
Petitioner has filed a proposed
order for approving the Petition (Form MC-351) and a proposed order to deposit
funds in a blocked account (Form MC-355). The Court notes that paragraph 1 of
both MC-351 and MC-355 are incomplete. (Form MC-351 (10/11/24), ¶ 1; MC-355
(10/11/24), ¶ 1.) 
CONCLUSION 
Based on the foregoing, the Court DENIES Petitioner Raymond Mena’s
petition for minor’s compromise
without prejudice. 
Petitioner is ordered to provide notice of the Court’s
ruling and file proof of service of same within five days of the Court’s order.
