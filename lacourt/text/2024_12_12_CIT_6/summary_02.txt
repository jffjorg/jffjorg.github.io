Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Raquel Armenta, by and through her Guardian Ad Litem Lindsay Bowman, vs. Luis Toledo. The case involves a petition for approval of a compromise of action for a person with a disability. The Court has determined that the petition has not been properly served on the state agencies as required by law, and therefore, the Court will continue the hearing to require the petitioner to provide the requisite notice to the agencies. The Court has also determined that the bond requirement will be waived due to the low funding amount of the trust. The Court has denied the petition without prejudice, meaning that the petitioner may refile the petition once the notice requirements have been met.
