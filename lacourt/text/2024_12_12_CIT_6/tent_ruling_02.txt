BACKGROUND 
This is a personal injury action. On April 17,
2024, plaintiff Raquel Armenta (Claimant), by and through her Guardian Ad Litem
Lindsay Bowman (Petitioner), and plaintiff Edward Delacruz, filed this action against
defendant Luis Toledo (Defendant) and Does 1 to 100, alleging causes of action
for motor vehicle, general negligence, and loss of consortium. On April 17 ,
2024, the Court approved Edward Delacruz’s application and order for
appointment of Petitioner as guardian ad litem for Claimant. 
On September 26, 2024, Petitioner filed a petition
for approval of compromise of claim or action or disposition of proceeds of
judgment for minor or person with disability on behalf of Claimant. On October
24, 2024, the Court continued the hearing on the petition to require to provide
the requisite 15 days’ notice by mail to the three state agencies and to submit
a corrected proposed order. On October 28, 2024, Petitioner gave notice of the
Court’s October 24, 2024 order. On November 19, 2024, Petitioner filed the
corrected proposed order. The Petition is unopposed. 
LEGAL STANDARD
Court approval is required for all settlements of a
minor's claim or that of a person lacking the capacity to make decisions.
(Prob. Code, §§ 2504, 3500, 3600 et seq.; Code Civ. Proc., § 372; see Pearson
v. Superior Court (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th 1333, 1337.) "[T]he
protective role the court generally assumes in cases involving minors, [is] a
role to assure that whatever is done is in the minor's best interests . . . .
[I]ts primary concern is whether the compromise is sufficient to provide for
the minor's injuries, care and treatment." (Goldberg v. Superior Court
(1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 1378, 1382.) The same protection applies for a disabled
person.
A petition for court approval of a compromise under
Code of Civil Procedure section 372 must comply with California Rules of Court
Rules 7.950, 7.951, and 7.952. The petition must be verified by the petitioner
and contain a full disclosure of all information that has "any bearing
upon the reasonableness" of the compromise or the covenant. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 7.950.) The person compromising the claim on behalf of the person
who lacks capacity, and the represented person, must attend the hearing on compromise
of the claim unless the court for good cause dispenses with their personal
appearance. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.952(a).) An order for deposit of funds
of a minor or person lacking decision-making capacity and a petition for the
withdrawal of such funds must comply with California Rules of Court Rules 7.953
and 7.954. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1384; see also Super. Ct. L.A. County,
Local Rules, rules 4.115-4.118.)
DISCUSSION
Form MC-350 (Rev. January 1, 2021)
The Petition has been verified by Petitioner and
presented on a fully completed mandatory Judicial Council Form MC-350, using
the current January 1, 2021 revision. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.950.) 
Settlement 
Claimant has agreed
to settle her claims with Defendant in exchange for $50,000, $13,601.73 of which will go to
Claimant. If approved, $10,904.79 will be paid in attorney’s fees, $6,380.82 will
be paid for reimbursement of litigation costs advanced by Claimant’s attorneys,
and $19,112.66 will paid for medical expenses, leaving a balance of $13,601.73
for Claimant, to be paid to a special needs trust. 
Court approval is required for
all settlements of a person with a disability. (Probate Code, §§ 3600, et seq.; Code Civ. Proc., § 372.) The
Court has reviewed the proposed settlement and finds the Petition contains a
full disclosure of all information that has any bearing upon the reasonableness
of the settlement amount. 
Notice 
Probate Code section 3611, subdivision (c), states: “Notice of the
time and place of the hearing and a copy of the petition shall be mailed to the
State Director of Health Care Services, the Director of State Hospitals, and
the Director of Developmental Services at the office of each director in
Sacramento at least 15 days before the hearing.” (Probate Code, § 3611, subd.
(c).) Petitioner again failed to comply with this requirement. The proof of
service attached to the Notice of Continued Hearing on Petition to Confirm
Minor’s Compromise filed on October 28, 2024, only provides notice of the
continued hearing date to the aforementioned three state agencies. (Notice of
Continued Hearing on Petition to Confirm Minor’s Compromise (10/28/24).) This
is not enough. Petitioner needed to also have served a copy of the Petition on
those state agencies. (Probate Code, § 3611, subd. (c).) Petitioner needs to
correct this. 
Attorney's
Fees
The retained attorney's information has been disclosed as required
by Rule of Court 7.951. (Petition, ¶ 17, subd. (b).) There is an agreement for
services provided in connection with the underlying claim. (Petition, ¶ 17,
subd. (a)(2).) Copies of the agreements were submitted with the Petitions as
required by Rule 7.951, subdivision (6), of the California Rules of Court. (Petition,
Attach. 17a(2); Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.951, subd. (6).)
Claimant’s counsel seeks to recover $10,904.79 in attorney fees
from Claimant, i.e., 22% of $50,000.00. (Petition, ¶ 13, subd. (a); Id.,
Attach. 13a.) Counsel has provided a declaration addressing the reasonableness
of the fee request, as required by Rule 7.955, subdivision (c), of the
California Rules of Court, accounting for the factors specified in Rule 7.955,
subdivision (b). (Ibid.; Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.955, subd. (c).)
Rule 7.955, subdivision (b), provides:
(b) Factors the court may consider in determining a reasonable
attorney's fee. In determining a reasonable attorney's fee, the court may
consider the following nonexclusive factors:
(1) The fact that a minor or person with a disability is involved
and the circumstances of that minor or person with a disability.
(2) The amount of the fee in proportion to the value of the
services performed.
(3) The novelty and difficulty of the questions involved and the
skill required to perform the legal services properly.
(4) The amount involved and the results obtained.
(5) The time limitations or constraints imposed by the
representative of the minor or person with a disability or by the
circumstances.
(6) The nature and length of the professional relationship between
the attorney and the representative of the minor or person with a disability.
(7) The experience, reputation, and ability of the attorney or
attorneys performing the legal services.
(8) The time and labor required.
(9) The informed consent of the representative of the minor or
person with a disability to the fee.
(10) The relative sophistication of the attorney and the
representative of the minor or person with a disability.
(11) The likelihood, if apparent to the representative of the
minor or person with a disability when the representation agreement was made,
that the attorney's acceptance of the particular employment would preclude
other employment.
(12) Whether the fee is fixed, hourly, or contingent.
(13) If the fee is contingent:
(A) The risk of loss borne by the attorney;
(B) The amount of costs advanced by the attorney; and
(C) The delay in payment of fees and reimbursement of costs paid
by the attorney.
(14) Statutory requirements for representation agreements
applicable to particular cases or claims.
(Cal. Rules
of Court, rule 7.955, subd. (b).) The Court addresses these factors below.
Amount of Fee in Proportion to Value of Services Performed
Claimant’s counsel indicates that the contingency rate for the
Claimant in this matter is 22%. (Petition, Attach. 13a, ¶ 4.)
Novelty and Difficulty
Claimant’s counsel indicates that the difficulty in this action
involved resolving a $1.4 million self-funded ERISA lien down to $16,666.66,
and a Medi-Cal lien of $379,506.72 down to $2,224.30. (Petition, Attach. 13a, ¶
5.)
Amount Involved and Results Obtained
Claimant’s counsel indicates the gross recovery is $50,000.00 and
that the contingency fee is 22%. (Petition, Attach. 13a, ¶ 4.)
Nature and Length of Professional Relationship
Claimant’s counsel does not indicate the nature and length of the
relationship with Claimant, but the Court infers from the fee agreement that it
has been ongoing since at least August 2022 when the fee agreement was signed.
(Petition, Attachs. 13a, 17a(2).)
Experience, Reputation, and Ability of Counsel
Claimant’s counsel states indicates having nine years of
experience with complex medical malpractice and personal injury cases, with a
focus on representing clients with catastrophic injuries. (Petition, Attach.
13a, ¶¶ 7, 9.)
Time and Labor Required
Claimant’s counsel provides no information about the amount of
work undertaken for this case.
Acceptance of Case Precluding Other Employment
Claimant’s counsel does not address whether acceptance of this
case precluded other employment.
Contingent Fee
Claimant’s counsel accepted Claimant’s case for a 39% contingency
fee. (Petition, Attach. 17a.) But, given that Claimant’s counsel only seeks a
22% contingency, the Court finds Claimant’s counsel has adequately demonstrated
the reasonableness of the fee award in light of the factors and circumstances
in this case.
Medical Bills
Claimant incurred $1,816,754.26 in medical expenses. (Petition, ¶
12, subd. (a).) There is an outstanding lien of $16,666.66 for an ERISA
self-funded plan, $2,224.20 for Medi-Cal, and $221.80 for CEP America
California. (Petition, ¶ 12, subds. (b)(2), (b)(3), (b)(5).) 
Costs
Claimant’s counsel seeks to recover costs in the amount of
$6,380.82. (Petition, ¶ 13, subd. (b).)
Amount to Be Paid to Claimants
The net amount to be paid to Claimant is $13,601.73. (Petitions, ¶
15.)
Disposition of Balance of Proceeds
Petitioner requests that the net proceeds of $13,601.73 be
transferred to a Special Needs Trust. (Petition, ¶ 18, subd. (b)(4).)
Special Needs Trust
When approving the establishment or funding of a
special needs trust (SNT) from settlement proceeds, the Court must make the
following findings under Probate Code section 3604, subdivision (b), i.e.,
there are factual allegations in the Petition and its attachments supporting
the settlement that generally cover the requisite findings:
-         
The SNT beneficiary has a disability which
substantially impairs the individual’s ability to provide for her own care or
custody and constitutes a substantial handicap;
-         
The SNT beneficiary is likely to have special needs
that will not be met without the trust; and
-         
The money to be paid to the trust does not exceed the
amount that appears reasonably necessary to meet the SNT beneficiary’s special
needs.
The Court finds the proposed SNT meets the main requirements for
court created or funded trusts. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.903, subd. (c);
LASC, rule 4.116.)
Trustee and Bond
The proposed initial trustee is Legacy Enhancement, a non-profit
entity that hosts the pooled SNT. Normally, bond must be required of a trustee
unless the trustee is a corporate fiduciary. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.903,
subd. (c)(5); Probate Code, § 2320.) Rule 7.903(d) states: “Unless the court
otherwise orders for good cause shown, the requirements of (c)(5)–(8) of this
rule [bond, accountings, and generally court supervision] do not apply to trust
instruments for trusts that will have total assets of $20,000 or less after
receipt of the property ordered by the court.” 
Petitioner requests waiver of bond under Rule 7.903, subdivision (d), of
the California Rules of Court, based on the low funding amount of the trust.
The Court finds good cause is shown, and will waive the bond requirement,
accountings,
and ongoing court supervision. Otherwise, costs of administration including
filing and legal fees to open a trust supervision action in the Probate
division of this court, and bond premiums, would consume the net settlement
proceeds and deprive plaintiff of the benefit of the settlement. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule. 7.903, subd. (d).)
Court Appearance
Rule 7.952, subdivision (a), of the California Rules of Court
requires attendance by the petitioner and claimant unless the court for good
cause dispenses with their personal appearance. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
7.952, subd. (a).) The Court finds that the appearances of the Claimant is not
required due to Claimant’s disability. However, Petitioner’s attendance is
required.
Prognosis
Claimant has a traumatic brain injury that will be required 24/7
care for the rest of her life. (Petitions, ¶ 8, subd. (c).)
Proposed Order MC-351
The Court
directs Petitioner to submit a revised proposed order reflecting the Court’s
decisions herein by revising the language in paragraph 7 of Attachment 13 indicating
that the bond is waived under Rule 7.903, subdivision (d), of the California
Rules of Court, removing the first accounting language from paragraph 9 of the
same attachment, and revising the OSC language in paragraph 8 of the same
attachment. 
Once the
Petition is approved, the Court will set an OSC re funding of the pooled
Special Needs Trust approximately 60 days thereafter. 
Based on the foregoing, the Court DENIES the petition
without prejudice. 
CONCLUSION 
The Court will CONTINUE the hearing to require Petitioner to
provide the requisite 15 days’ notice by mail to the three state agencies,
including the time and place of the hearing, a copy of the Petition, and the
revised proposed order. Petitioner must file proof of service of same
within five days of service on the three state agencies. 
Petitioner is ordered to provide notice of the Court’s
ruling and file proof of service of same within five days of the Court’s order.
