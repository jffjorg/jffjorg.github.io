And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies the motion of Plaintiffs Dennis Luna and Vanessa Luna Bishop to reopen the summary judgment and set aside the judgment entered in favor of Defendants Fernando Gaytan and Angie Coello. The Plaintiffs' motion is based on their claim that they were mistaken, inadvertently, or surprised by the court's order granting the Defendants' motion for summary judgment, and that they did not have the funds to continue paying legal bills, leading to their counsel's withdrawal. However, the Judge finds that the Plaintiffs' evidence does not show that they were unexpectedly placed in a situation where they could not have guarded against the consequences, or that their decision to oppose the summary judgment motion orally without filing opposition papers was a reasonable one. The Judge also notes that the Plaintiffs were aware of the summary judgment motion on separate occasions and elected not to file a written opposition, which does not constitute a mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. Therefore, the Judge denies the Plaintiffs' motion and orders the Defendants to give notice of this ruling.
