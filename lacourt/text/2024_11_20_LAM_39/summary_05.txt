And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the motion by the defendants, Simply Good Foods USA, Inc. and Quest Nutrition, LLC, to stay the action pending resolution of the Legendary Foods matter in federal court. The defendants argue that the Legendary Foods matter was filed first, but the court found that this is not accurate, as the complaint in the Legendary Foods matter was filed 20 minutes after the complaint in this case was filed.

The court has considered the relevant laws and precedents, including Freiberg v. City of Mission Viejo, Caiafa Prof. Law Corp. v. State Farm Fire & Cas. Co., and Gregg v. Superior Court. The court has concluded that it is not required to stay this case in favor of the Legendary Foods matter, as Plaintiffs filed this case first. Additionally, the court has determined that Plaintiffs are not parties in the Legendary Foods case and therefore cannot be precluded from pursuing this action.

Consequently, the motion to stay is denied. The defendants are ordered to provide notice of this order and to file proof of service of same.
