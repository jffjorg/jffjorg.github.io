MOTION
Plaintiff Cypress Escrow
and Settlement Services, Inc. (“Plaintiff”) moves for discharge from this action.
ANALYSIS
A stakeholder which
claims no interest in funds held may apply to the Court for permission to
deposit the money or property with the court clerk, and for an order
discharging the stakeholder from further liability to the adverse
claimants.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 386.5.)  
In the instant
case, Plaintiff held $50,000 in escrow in connection with a real property
sale.  After a dispute arose between the
parties concerning the sale as to the disposition of the funds, Plaintiff filed
this complaint in interpleader.  Pursuant
to this Court’s August 20, 2024 order, Plaintiff deposited the funds with the
Court.  Under these circumstances,
discharge of Plaintiff is warranted (Pacific Loan Management Corp. v.
Superior Court (1987) 196 Cal.App.3d 1485, 1489-1490), and the Court discharges
Plaintiff from this action.
A stakeholder may
seek reimbursement for costs and reasonable attorney fees incurred, and the Court
may order payment thereof out of the funds deposited by the stakeholder. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 386.6.)  The award of attorney fees is limited to
“costs and reasonable attorney fees incurred in [the interpleader] action”  (Ibid.)  Plaintiff seeks attorney fees in the amount
of $8,562.  Plaintiff relies on the
declaration of its attorney, Courtney L. 
Puritsky (“Counsel”) in support of its request.  Counsel states he has incurred attorney fees
and costs in the amount of $8,562 in litigating this action.  (Declaration of Courtney L. Puritsky, ¶ 6.)  Accordingly, the Court grants Plaintiff’s
request for attorney fees and costs.
Plaintiff is ordered
to provide notice of this order and to file proof of service of same.
