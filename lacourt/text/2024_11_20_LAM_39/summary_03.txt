And here is the English summary of the tentative ruling:

The tentative ruling sustains the demurrer to the sixth cause of action for fraud and deceit, and grants the motion to strike the prayer for punitive damages. The court finds that Plaintiff's allegations do not support a claim for fraud and deceit, as they do not allege material facts or reliance on misrepresentations. The court also finds that Plaintiff's allegations do not support a claim for intentional misrepresentation, as they do not allege reliance on misrepresentations or any specific facts that constitute malicious conduct. The court grants Plaintiff leave to amend, but notes that the allegations in the complaint are likely insufficient to state a claim for fraud and deceit, and therefore leave to amend may be futile.
