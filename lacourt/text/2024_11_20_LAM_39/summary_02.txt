And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on two motions filed by the judgment creditor, Scottsdale Indemnity Company, and the respondent, Kandela, LLC. The judgment creditor seeks to compel Eli Gordon, Kandela's principal, to answer questions at a judgment debtor examination, while Kandela seeks a protective order to limit the scope of the examination to current assets.

The judge has granted the judgment creditor's motion to compel Gordon to answer questions, but has limited the scope of the examination to questions about Kandela's current assets and its board members. The judge has also denied the judgment creditor's motion to compel Gordon to provide specific answers to certain questions.

Kandela had argued that the judgment creditor was using the judgment debtor examination to seek evidence in a separate case, Porch.com, Inc., et al. v. Kandela, LLC, et al. (Super. Ct. L.A. County, 2023, No. 23STCV01162). However, the judge has denied Kandela's motion for a protective order, finding that there is no authority to curtail the judgment creditor's rights to take a judgment debtor examination based on other pending litigation.

The judge has also denied the judgment creditor's motion for sanctions and declined to appoint a referee to oversee the examination. However, the judge has warned that if the parties do not show greater cooperation moving forward, it may entertain a motion for appointment of a referee or appoint one on its own motion.

Finally, the judge has ordered the judgment creditor to provide notice of this order and to file proof of service of same.
