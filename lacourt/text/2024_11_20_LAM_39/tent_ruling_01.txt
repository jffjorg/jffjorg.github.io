MOTION
Plaintiff Rosa
Gonzalez (“Plaintiff”) works as a police sergeant at the Sherrif’s Department
of Defendant County of Los Angeles (“Defendant”).  Plaintiff contends Defendant retaliated
against Plaintiff for reporting deputy gang activity, timecard fraud, fraud in
the lieutenant’s exam process, and discriminatory hiring practices.  Plaintiff seeks disclosure of: Defendant’s
files relating to Plaintiff’s October 26, 2021 grievance; Plaintiff’s November
12, 2021 supplemental grievance; Internal Affairs Bureau investigation No. IAB
244923, which was an investigation about Plaintiff; Defendant’s inquiry memoranda
regarding allegations Yvonne O’Brien (“O’Brien”) and Carmen Arballo (“Arballo”)
rigged the 2021 lieutenant promotion exam; and Defendant’s documents regarding
O’Brien’s access to the lieutenant’s exam; Plaintiff’s report O’Brien and
Arballo committed timecard fraud; an Internal Affairs Bureau investigation that
Vanessa Chow filed against Sheriff Alex Villanueva (“Villanueva”) in October
2022; any investigation into Villanueva for discrimination and retaliation
against Inspector General Max Huntsman; Cynthia Maluto’s report of O’Brien’s
timecard fraud; Internal Affairs Bureau investigation No. IAB 2540083 into Cynthia
Maluto; and any records of O’Brien’s fraud and dishonesty.  Defendant opposes the motion.
ANALYSIS
Penal Code section
832.7 provides peace officer personnel records are confidential and are not to
be disclosed in a civil proceeding except pursuant to Evidence Code sections
1043 and 1046.  (Pen. Code, § 832.7, subd.
(a).)  Evidence Code section 1043 sets
forth a two-step procedure for disclosure of peace officer personnel
records.  The party seeking disclosure
must file a motion identifying the peace officer, the agency in possession of
the records, a description of the records, who is seeking the records, and the
time and place of the hearing.  (Evid.
Code, § 1043 subd. (b)(1).)  The moving
party must submit a declaration showing good cause for disclosure of the
records, setting forth the materiality of the records, and stating upon
reasonable belief  the governmental
agency has the requested documents. 
(Evid. Code, § 1043, subd. (b)(3).) 
The moving party need only show “a plausible scenario of officer
misconduct . . . that might or could have occurred.  Such a scenario is plausible because it
presents an assertion of specific police misconduct that is both internally consistent
and supports the defense proposed to the charges.”  (Warrick v. Superior Court (2005) 35
Cal.4th 1011, 1026.)  This is a
“relatively low threshold for discovery . . . .”  (City of Santa Cruz v. Municipal Court
(1989) 49 Cal.3d 74, 83.)  The moving
party must give notice of the motion to the parties and to the governmental
agency with custody of the records. 
(Evid. Code, § 1043, subd. (a).)
In the instant
case, Plaintiff’s request for Defendant’s files noted above is relevant to
Plaintiff’s claim Defendant, through its supervisory employees, retaliated
against Plaintiff for complaining about unlawful activity.  Accordingly, Plaintiff has good cause to obtain
these records.  Nonetheless, Plaintiff is
not entitled to discover “the portions of the Internal Affairs report in which
the investigating officer states his analysis and conclusions regarding the
incident.”  (Haggerty v. Superior
Court (2004) 117 Cal.App.4th 1079, 1088.) 
Therefore, the  Court would have redacted
such portions of the file before disclosure of the file to Plaintiff. 
Plaintiff fails to
articulate a theory under which Defendant’s documents relating to an Internal
Affairs Bureau investigation that Vanessa Chow filed against Alex Villanueva in
October 2022, any investigation into Villanueva for discrimination and
retaliation against Inspector General Max Huntsman, or an Internal Affairs
Bureau investigation No. IAB 2540083 into Cynthia Maluto are pertinent to this
action.  Accordingly, the Court denies
the motion as to those requests.
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
Plaintiff’s motion
is granted, in part.  Pursuant to
Evidence Code section 1045, the Court will hold an in camera review of Defendant’s
files relating to Plaintiff’s October 26, 2021 grievance, Plaintiff’s November
12, 2021 supplemental grievance, Internal Affairs Bureau investigation No. IAB
244923, Defendant’s inquiry memoranda regarding allegations O’Brien and Arballo
rigged the 2021 lieutenant promotion exam, and Defendant’s documents regarding
O’Brien’s access to the lieutenant’s exam, Plaintiff’s report O’Brien and
Arballo committed timecard fraud, Cynthia Maluto’s report of O’Brien’s timecard
fraud, and any of Defendant’s records regarding O’Brien’s fraud and dishonesty 
Plaintiff is to
give notice of this order and to file proof of service of same.
