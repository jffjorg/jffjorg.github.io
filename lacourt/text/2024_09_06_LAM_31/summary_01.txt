And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling concerns a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication filed by the defendants, El Segundo Plaza Associates, L.P. and El Segundo Plaza I, Inc. The plaintiffs, JCS El Segundo, Inc., Jay Shin, and Clara Shin, argue that the defendants' quitclaim deed, executed by the plaintiffs, does not assign their claims to the defendants.

The judge notes that the quitclaim deed states that the plaintiffs convey, release, and quitclaim all of their rights, claims, title, and interest in the property to the defendants. However, the plaintiffs argue that they executed the quitclaim deed to assign only their interest in the title to the property, not their rights and interests in the lawsuit.

The judge expresses concerns about ambiguity and mistake in the quitclaim deed and orders the parties to file additional briefing on these issues. The judge also notes that the parties will be heard and may order further proceedings.

In summary, the judge's tentative ruling is that the defendants have not conclusively negated a necessary element of the plaintiffs' case, and therefore, the motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication is denied. The case will proceed to further proceedings.
