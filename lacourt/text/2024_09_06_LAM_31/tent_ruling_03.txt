PLAINTIFFS
AND CROSS-DEFENDANTS JEFF KWATINETZ AND PROSPECT PARK LLC’S MOTION TO PARTIALLY
LIFT STAY AS TO CLAIMS OTHER THAN THE EIGHTH CAUSE OF ACTION FOR INTENTIONAL INFLICTION
OF EMOTIONAL DISTRESS PENDING APPEAL FROM DENIAL AZEALIA BANKS’S SPECIAL MOTION
TO STRIK UNDER C.C.P. § 425.16



 
MOVING PARTY:               Plaintiffs and Cross-Defendants Jeff Kwatinetz and
Prospect Park, LLC
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     Defendant and Cross-Complainant Azealia
Banks


 
I.          INTRODUCTION
            
This action arises from the deterioration of a business relationship
between Jeff Kwatinetz (“Kwatinetz”), founder and manager of music production
company, Prospect Park, LLC, and Azealia Banks (“Banks”), a recording artist
and rapper.  
 
            On September 20, 2021, Kwatinetz and
Prospect Park, LLC (collectively, “Plaintiffs”), initiated this action against
Banks and Lasagna Girl, LLC (collectively, “Defendants”).  The operative
is the First Amended Complaint (FAC).  The
FAC alleged the causes of action for (1) Breach of Implied Covenant of Good
Faith and Fair Dealing; (2) Interference with Contractual Relations; (3)
Defamation; (4) Trade Libel; (5) Stalking in Violation of California Civil Code
Section 1708.7; (6) Invasion of Privacy; (7) Civil Extortion, and (8)
Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress.
 
            On November 14, 2023, Banks filed a
Special Motion to Strike Pursuant to C.C.P § 425.16 to the Eighth Cause of
Action for Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress in the FAC. The motion
was denied on April 30, 2024. 
 
            On May 2, 2024, Banks filed a Notice
of Appeal of the court’s April 30, 2024, order. 

 
            On May 3, 2024, the court stayed the
entire action pending resolution of Banks’s appeal.
 
            Plaintiffs now move for an order to
partially lift the stay as to all causes of action not embraced by Banks’s
appeal.
 
Banks filed an opposition.  Plaintiffs
replied. 
 
II.        DISCUSSION
& LEGAL STANDARD
 
It is well settled law that an appeal
of ruling denying a special motion to strike automatically “stays all further
trial court proceedings on the merits upon the causes of action affected by the
motion.” (Varian Medical Systems, Inc. v. Delfino (2005) 35 Cal.4th 180,
186.)  This case does not present any
issue or circumstance that warrant deviation from the foregoing rule.  The court denied Plaintiff’s special motion
to strike the Eighth Cause of Action. 
The allegations supporting that cause of action likewise support
Plaintiffs’ other claims. (See FAC, ¶¶ 40-79.) 
Contrary to Plaintiffs’ argument, Banks’s appeal embraces or affects more
than Plaintiffs’ Eighth Cause of Action for IIED.  While the court certainly appreciates
Plaintiffs argument regarding the persistence of the original seven causes of
action regardless of the ruling on appeal, Plaintiffs, nonetheless, fail to demonstrate
that should the court of appeal strike all of the paragraphs targeted by the anti-slapp
motion none of the allegations that form the prior seven causes of action would
be affected.  Indeed, Plaintiffs fail to
do the work to identify all of the paragraphs targeted by the anti-slapp motion
and whether they support any of the initial seven causes of action.  Moreover, should the court of appeal affirm
this court’s ruling allowing the eighth cause of action to proceed and should the
parties go forward with discovery now as to the first seven causes of action,
then, after the ruling by the court of appeal, the parties and the court would
likely be drawn back into discovery issues related to the Eighth Cause of Action.  For example, any deposition would have to be
redone to cover the issues related to the Eighth Cause of Action.   
 
Plaintiffs seek relief from the
stay because Banks allegedly filed a defective appeal, which was not timely
cured, and is now awaiting dismissal.  Indeed,
on September 4, 2024, the Superior Court issued a Clerk’s Notice of Non-Compliance
of Default on Appeal.  However, unless
and until Banks’s appeal is dismissed or the issues cured, this court is not
inclined to lift the stay.  Plaintiffs
fail to cite authority for the proposition that this court can dismiss an
appeal.  Given this recent development, however,
the court will hear from counsel whether this motion should be continued for 30
days to allow the court of appeal to address the status of the appeal. 
 
III.      CONCLUSION
 
            Based
on the foregoing, the Motion to Partially Lift the Stay is DENIED.  Alternatively, the
court will continue the hearing on the motion for 30 days. 
 
Defendant to give notice.
