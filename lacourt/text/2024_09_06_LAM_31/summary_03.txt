And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion to partially lift the stay of the action pending appeal. The stay was granted after the defendant filed a notice of appeal of the court's denial of their special motion to strike the eighth cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress. The judge ruled that the stay should remain in place until the appeal is resolved, as the allegations supporting the eighth cause of action also support the other claims in the lawsuit. The judge also noted that the defendant's appeal has been deemed defective and is awaiting dismissal, but until the appeal is resolved, the stay will remain in place. The judge will consider continuing the hearing on the motion for 30 days to allow the court of appeal to address the status of the appeal.
