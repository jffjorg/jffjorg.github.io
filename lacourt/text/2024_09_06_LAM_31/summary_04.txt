And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Plaintiff's motion for reconsideration of the court's May 16, 2024, order granting summary judgment to Defendants. The motion was based on new or different facts and law, specifically the case of People v. Gillard (1997) 57 Cal.App.4th 136 and the deposition of GEICO's person most knowledgeable. The judge found that the motion was procedurally defective and substantively lacking. The judge also found that the new facts presented by Plaintiff did not create triable issues of material fact that would warrant a different conclusion from that reached in the court's May 16, 2024, ruling. The judge ultimately denied the motion for reconsideration.
