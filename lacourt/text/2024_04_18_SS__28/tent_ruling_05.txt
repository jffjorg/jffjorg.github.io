BACKGROUND 
On
April 27, 2022, Plaintiff Douglas Rhee, Jr.
(“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendants
Hilarion Candido Varela (“Varela”), Steve Song (“Song”), and Does 1-50 for
motor vehicle and general negligence. 
On
March 30, 2023, Plaintiff filed proofs of service showing personal service of a
statement of damages on Varela on November 17, 2022, and personal service of a
statement of damages on Song on November 12, 2022. The statements of damage each listed $5,000,000.00 for
pain, suffering, and inconvenience, $2,000,000.00 for emotional distress,
$650,000.00 for medical expenses to date, $500,000.00 for future medical
expenses, and $1,000,000.00 for loss of future earning capacity. 
On
April 12, 2023, the clerk entered Varela’s default. 
On
May 5 and June 14, 2023, Plaintiff filed additional proofs of personal service
on Song of a statement of damages on November 12, 2022. 
On
June 14, 2023, the clerk entered Song’s default. 
On
September 5, 2023, the Court dismissed the Doe defendants without prejudice at
Plaintiff’s request. 
On
April 4, 2024, Plaintiff submitted a request for Court judgment against
Defendants to be heard on April 18, 2024. 
PARTY’S REQUESTS 
Plaintiff
asks the Court to enter a default judgment against Defendants Hilarion Candido
Varela and Steve Song and award Plaintiff $1,506,747.96, consisting of
$1,000,000.00 in special damages, $500,000.00 in general damages, and $6,747.96
in costs. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
A.      Default judgment 
“[With exceptions that do not apply here,] [a] party
seeking a default judgment on declarations must use mandatory Request for Entry
of Default (Application to Enter Default) (form CIV-100) . . . The following
must be included in the documents filed with the clerk: 
“(1)  Except in
unlawful detainer cases, a brief summary of the case identifying the parties
and the nature of plaintiff's claim; 
“(2) 
Declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment
requested; 
“(3)  Interest
computations as necessary; 
“(4)  A
memorandum of costs and disbursements; 
“(5)  A
declaration of nonmilitary status for each defendant against whom judgment is
sought; 
“(6)  A proposed
form of judgment; 
“(7)  A
dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application
for separate judgment against specified parties under Code of Civil Procedure
section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; 
“(8)  Exhibits
as necessary; and 
“(9)  A request
for attorney fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.” 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1800(a).) 
B.       Damages 
 On a request for default judgment, “[w]here a
cause of action is stated in the complaint, plaintiff merely needs to introduce
evidence establishing a prima facie case for damages.”  (L. Edmon & C. Karnow, Cal. Practice
Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶ 5:213.1, p. 5-56, citing Johnson
v. Stanhiser (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 357, 361 [trial court erred in applying
preponderance of the evidence standard].) 
 The relief granted to a plaintiff upon entry
of a defendant's default cannot exceed the amount demanded in the complaint or,
for personal injury cases where damages may not be stated in the complaint, the
amount listed in the statement of damages. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 580, subd. (a),
585, subd. (b).) “The notice requirement of section 580 was designed to insure
fundamental fairness.” (Becker v. S.P.V. Construction Co. (1980) 27
Cal.3d 489, 494.) The statute insures that “defendants in cases which involve a
default judgment have adequate notice of the judgments that may be taken
against them. [Citation.] ‘If a judgment other than that which is demanded is
taken against him, [the defendant] has been deprived of his day in court—a
right to a hearing on the matter adjudicated.’ ’’ (Id. at p. 493.) A
trial court exceeds its jurisdiction if it awards damages in excess of the
amount specified in the complaint or statement of damages. (Id. at p.
494.) 
DISCUSSION 
          Plaintiff requests $1,000,000.00 in special damages.  Plaintiff’s declaration provides support for
$600,782.50 in special damages based on Plaintiff’s past medical expenses.  But Plaintiff has not provided support for the
remaining special damages he is requesting ($399,217.50). 
          The
Court denies the application without prejudice. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES without prejudice Plaintiff Douglas Rhee,
Jr.’s application for default judgment against Defendants Hilarion Candido
Varela and Steve Song. 
Plaintiff
is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
