And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's application for a default judgment against the defendants, Hilarion Candido Varela and Steve Song. The plaintiff had requested $1,506,747.96 in damages, but the court finds that the plaintiff has not provided sufficient evidence to support the remaining amount of special damages requested. The court also notes that the plaintiff has not provided support for the $399,217.50 in special damages requested. The court's decision is without prejudice, meaning that the plaintiff may refile a new application for a default judgment. The court's ruling is based on California Rules of Court, rule 3.1800(a) and Code of Civil Procedure, sections 580 and 585.
