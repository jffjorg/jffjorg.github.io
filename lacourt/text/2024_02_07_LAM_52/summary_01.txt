And here is a summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling denies the plaintiff's motion for relief from waiver of discovery objections and the defendant's motion to enforce the court's discovery order. The plaintiff failed to serve a timely response to the defendant's requests for production, and the court's order compelling responses without objections is still binding on the plaintiff. The judge notes that the plaintiff's motion is untimely and seeks to retroactively undo the court's order, and that the defendant's motion was not timely filed.
