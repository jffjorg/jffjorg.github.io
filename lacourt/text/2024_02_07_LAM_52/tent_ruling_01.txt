  Case Number:  22STCV33878    Hearing Date:   February 7, 2024    Dept:  52 (1) Plaintiff Joshua Canady’s Motion for Relief from Waiver
of Discovery Objections; (2) Defendant Equinox Holdings, Inc.’s Motion to Enforce
Court’s October 2, 2023 Discovery Order and for Sanctions or Motion to Compel
Further Responses in the Alternative 
Background
            On August 7,
2023, defendant Equinox Holdings, Inc. moved to compel plaintiff Joshua Canady
to respond without objections to requests for production Nos. 41-73.  On October 2, 2023, the court granted
defendant’s motion and ordered plaintiff to respond without objections.  Plaintiff then served responses to the
requests, but served only objections to request Nos. 45, 46, and 49.  On January 8, 2024, plaintiff moved for
relief from waiver of his objections.  On
January 16, defendant moved to enforce the court’s order dated October 2, 2023.
(1) Plaintiff’s Motion for Relief from Waiver of Discovery
Objections
            Plaintiff
Joshua Canady moves for relief from waiver of his objections to defendant’s
requests for production.  If a party
“fails to serve a timely response to” requests for production, he “waives any
objection to the demand.”  (CCP §
2031.300(a).)  “The court, on motion, may
relieve that party from this waiver on its determination that both of the
following conditions are satisfied: (1) The party has subsequently served a
response that is in substantial compliance with Sections 2031.210, 2031.220,
2031.230, 2031.240, and 2031.280 [and] (2) The party’s failure to serve a
timely response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.”  (Ibid.)  As the court ruled on October 2, 2023,
plaintiff failed to serve a timely response to defendant’s requests for
production.   
            Plaintiff’s
failure to serve a timely response was not the result of mistake, inadvertence,
or excusable neglect.  Plaintiff
initially served responses to requests for production Nos. 1-40, but not Nos.
41-73.  (Iarusso Decl., ¶ 6, Ex. A; Tran
Decl., ¶ 6, Ex. D.)  Defendant met and
conferred with plaintiff and agreed to allow extra time to respond to Nos.
41-73.  (Tran Decl., ¶¶ 7-9.)  On August 1, 2023, plaintiff served
additional responses to other discovery—but not to requests for production Nos.
41-73.  (Id., ¶ 10, Ex. H.)  
Defendant moved to compel responses
without objections.  Plaintiff did not
file an opposition to that motion until September 29, 2023, the final court day
before the hearing on October 2. 
Assuming plaintiff’s initial failure to respond to Nos. 41-73 was
excusable, plaintiff had months to correct that problem.  Plaintiff’s failure to do so resulted either
from recalcitrance or inexcusable neglect.
            Then,
despite the court’s order compelling responses without objections, plaintiff
served responses with objections in October 2023.  Not until about three months later, on
January 8, 2024, did plaintiff move for relief from waiver of the objections
the court already ruled were waived.  A
motion for relief from waiver of objections should be made before the court
issues an order compelling responses without objections.  (See Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v.
Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 408 [“Unless
that party obtains relief from its waiver, the propounding party is entitled to
move under subdivision (b) for an order compelling the response to which the
propounding party is entitled—that is, a response without objection”].)    
In substance, plaintiff seeks
untimely and unwarranted reconsideration of the court’s October 2, 2023,
order.  Granting plaintiff’s motion now
would result in retroactively undoing the court’s order and permitting
plaintiff to repeatedly delay compliance with discovery obligations in
violation of a court order.        
(2) Defendant’s Motion to Enforce Discovery Order or to
Compel Further Responses
            Defendant
Equinox Holdings, Inc. moves for an order compelling plaintiff to comply with
the court’s discovery order dated October 2, 2023, or, in the alternative, an
order compelling further responses to its requests for production.  Defendant also seeks monetary sanctions.
            The court
does not reach the merits of defendant’s motion because defendant did not
timely and serve and file it.  “Unless
otherwise ordered or specifically provided by law, all moving and supporting
papers shall be served and filed at least 16 court days before the hearing.”  (CCP § 1005(b).)  Serving papers electronically extends the
required period of notice by two court days. 
(CCP § 1010.6(a)(3)(B).)
            Defendant reserved
the hearing for this motion on February 2. 
Defendant filed the motion on January 16, only 13 court days before the
hearing.  The court later continued this
hearing to February 7, which is 16 court days after January 16.  Even based on the present hearing date, defendant’s
electronic service on January 16 was untimely. 
The papers had to be electronically served two court days earlier, on
January 11.  
The court notes the parties’ papers
refer to electronic service on January 12, but the proofs of service attached
to defendant’s moving papers state they were served by email on January 16.  The moving papers themselves are also dated
January 16 and were filed that day.
Disposition
Plaintiff Joshua Canady’s motion for
relief from waiver of discovery objections is denied.  The court’s October 2, 2023, order requiring
plaintiff to, among other things, serve responses to Request Nos. 45, 46, and
49 without objections, is not vacated and is still binding on plaintiff.  
Defendant Equinox Holdings, Inc.’s
motion to enforce the court’s discovery order or to compel further responses to
requests for production is denied.
