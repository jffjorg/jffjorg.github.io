MOVING PARTY: Defendant
Stericycle Inc. 
RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff,
Marsalis Neal 
 
            The Court has considered the moving
papers. 
 
BACKGROUND 
On
November 21, 2023, Plaintiff Marsalis Neal (“Plaintiff”) filed the operative
complaint against Defendant Stericycle, Inc. alleging two causes of action for
(1) Failure to Pay Regular Wages in Violation of Labor Code § 218.5 and (2)
Failure to issue Accurate Wage Statements in Violation of labor Code § 226. 
 
On
February 28, 2024, Defendant filed the instant Motion to Compel Arbitration. No
Opposition has been filed. 
 
DISCUSSION
Defendant
moves for an order compelling Plaintiff to arbitrate his claims against
Defendant pursuant to the party's arbitration agreement and staying the action
under the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq.), the California
Arbitration Act (Code of Civil Procedure §§ 1281 et seq.
 
Under
both the Federal Arbitration Act and California law, arbitration agreements are
valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, except on such grounds that exist at law
or equity for voiding a contract. (Winter v. Window Fashions Professions,
Inc. (2008) 166 Cal.App.4th 943, 947.) California law incorporates many of
the basic policy objectives contained in the Federal Arbitration Act, including
a presumption in favor of arbitrability. 
(See Engalla v. Permanente Medical Group, Inc. (1997) 15 Cal.4th
951, 971-72.) Under Code of Civil Procedure section 1281, a “written agreement
to submit to arbitration an existing controversy or a controversy thereafter
arising is valid, enforceable and irrevocable, save upon such grounds as exist for
the revocation of any contract.” 
 
“On
petition of a party to an arbitration agreement alleging the existence of a
written agreement to arbitrate a controversy and that a party thereto refuses
to arbitrate such controversy, the court shall order the petitioner and the
respondent to arbitrate the controversy if it determines that an agreement to
arbitrate the controversy exists, unless it determines that:
 
(a)
The right to compel arbitration has been waived by the petitioner; or
(b)
Grounds exist for the revocation of the agreement.
(c)
A party to the arbitration agreement is also a party to a pending court action
or special proceeding with a third party, arising out of the same transaction
or series of related transactions and there is a possibility of conflicting
rulings on a common issue of law or fact. . . .”  (CCP §1281.2.) 
 
Defendant
provides the Court with a copy of the parties’ agreement to arbitrate (the “Agreement”).
(Beezley Decl. at ¶ 14, Exhibit B.) Plaintiff did not dispute the validity of
the Agreement. Therefore, the Court finds that a valid agreement exists between
the parties to arbitrate. 
 
Delegation
Clause 
The
enforceability of an arbitration agreement is generally determined by the
court.  (See Aanderud v. Superior
Court (2017) 13 Cal.App.5th 880, 891; Ajamian v. CantorCO2e, L.P.
(2012) 203 Cal.App.4th 771, 781.) 
However, parties may agree to arbitrate gateway questions of
arbitrability such as the enforceability of an arbitration agreement and
whether claims are covered by the arbitration agreement.  (See Rent-A-Center, West, Inc. v. Jackson
(2010) 561 U.S. 63, 68-69; Aanderud, supra, 13 Cal.App.5th at 891-92; Ajamian,
supra, 203 Cal.App.4th at 781.)   “To
establish this exception, it must be shown by ‘clear and unmistakable’ evidence
that the parties intended to delegate the issue to the arbitrator.”  (Ajamian, supra, 203 Cal.App.4th at
781 (citing First Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan (1995) 514 U.S.
938, 944).) 
 
“‘There
are two prerequisites for a delegation clause to be effective.’”  (Aanderud, supra, 13 Cal.App.5th at
892 (quoting Tiri v. Lucky Changes, Inc. (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 231,
242).)  “‘First, the language of the
clause must be clear and unmistakable.’” 
(Id.)  “‘Second, the
delegation must not be revocable under state contract defenses such as fraud,
duress, or unconscionability.’”  (Id.)

 
Defendant’s
Senior Human Resources Compliance Manager, Amanda Beezley, provides the  Court with a copy of the parties’ Agreement.
The Agreement states that,
 
 
except as this Agreement otherwise provides the
Arbitrator, and not any court, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any
dispute relating to the validity, applicability enforceability,
unconscionability or waiver of this Agreement, including, but not limited to
any claim that all or any part of this Agreement is void or voidable.
 
 
(Beezley Decl. at ¶ 14, Exhibit B at pp. 1-2.) Here,
the provision provides the Court with clear and unmistakable language that the
parties delegated the gateway question of arbitrability to the Arbitrator. The
plaintiff notably did not file opposition, such that no argument that the
delegation was either revoked or revocable. Therefore, the Court finds the requirements
for the motion to compel arbitration to be satisfied. 
 
Per the Agreement, the American
Arbitration Association (“AAA”) will be the arbitration forum. Thus, the Court
finds that the parties' dispute can be sufficiently arbitrated under CCP §
1281.6 through the AAA.
The Court further finds that a stay of the action is appropriate in this
case once the motion is granted, as Code of Civil Procedure § 1281.4 stipulates
that the Court shall stay the action until arbitration is completed. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1281.4.) Therefore, the Court GRANTS the Defendants’ Motion to Compel
Arbitration and STAYS the proceeding pending a final resolution of Plaintiff’s
claims through arbitration.  The Court
sets a Status Conference re Arbitration for March 7, 2025 at 8:30 a.m.
 
Moving
Parties are ordered to give notice of this ruling.       
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
Dated this 7th day of June 2024
