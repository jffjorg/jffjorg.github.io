The court has considered the motion to compel arbitration filed by Defendant Stericycle Inc. regarding the dispute between Plaintiff Marsalis Neal and Defendant Stericycle Inc. The court found that a valid agreement exists between the parties to arbitrate the dispute. The court also found that the parties delegated the issue of arbitrability to the arbitrator, and therefore granted the motion to compel arbitration. The court stayed the proceeding pending a final resolution of the dispute through arbitration.
