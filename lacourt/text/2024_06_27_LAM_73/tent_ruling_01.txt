Attorneys’ Fees is GRANTED. The Court awards Plaintiff $48,750.83 in attorneys’ fees and

I. BACKGROUND
 
On March 15,
2023, Plaintiff ZZ Fashion Corp. (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against
Defendants Dress Barn Online, Inc. (“Dress Barn”), Stein Mart Online, LLC
(“Stein Mart”) and Retail Ecommerce Ventures, LLC alleging the following causes
of action:
C/A
1: Breach of Contract; 
C/A
2: Account Stated; and
C/A
3: Money Had and Received.
The Complaint alleges the following.
Plaintiff is a California corporation that manufactures clothing. (Complaint, ¶ 12.) On or about April 2, 2021 and April 5, 2021,
respectively, Plaintiff entered into a pair of Vendor Direct to Customer
Agreements (the “Agreements”) with Stein Mart and Dress Barn. (Id., ¶ 13.) Pursuant to the
Agreements, Defendants agreed to pay Plaintiff certain sales and other
commissions in connection with the promotion and sale of Plaintiff’s clothing
and accessories on Defendants’ branded e-commerce websites. (Id., ¶ 14.) Plaintiff alleges it performed
all promises, covenants, and conditions it agreed to perform in accordance with
the terms of the Agreement, but Defendants breached the Agreements by failing
to timely pay Plaintiff the sums due. (Id., ¶¶ 15, 20.) Plaintiff further alleges the total
outstanding amount owed by Defendants under the Agreements is approximately
$131,617.11. (Id., ¶ 21.)
On March 28,
2024, the Court granted Plaintiff’s motion for summary adjudication against
Dress Barn and Stein Mart as to Plaintiff’s claim for breach of contract
against them.
 
On April 11,
2024, based upon the order granting summary adjudication and the stipulations
of the parties as to liability and damages, the Court entered judgment against
all Defendants. (Allyn Decl. ¶ 15.)
 
On April 23,
2024, Plaintiff filed the instant motion for attorneys’ fees against
Defendants. No opposition has been filed. 
 
II. ANALYSIS 
 
A.     Legal
Standard 
 
CCP §§ 1032 and 1033.5 provide that a prevailing party may
recover its costs as a matter of right, and that those costs may include
attorneys’ fees when authorized by statute or contract. 
 
“[A]bsent
circumstances rendering the award unjust, an attorney fee award should
ordinarily include compensation for all the hours reasonably spent,
including those relating solely to the fee.  We explained that the purpose
behind statutory fee authorizations—i.e., encouraging attorneys to act as
private attorneys general and to vindicate important rights affecting the
public interest—will often be frustrated, sometimes nullified, if awards are
diluted or dissipated by lengthy, uncompensated proceedings to fix or defend a
rightful fee claim.” (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122,
1133-34 (emphasis in original).)  “The fee setting inquiry in California
ordinarily begins with the ‘lodestar,’ i.e., the number of hours reasonably
expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate.... The lodestar figure may
then be adjusted, based on consideration of factors specific to the case, in
order to fix the fee at the fair market value for the legal services
provided.” (Id. at 1134.) Other factors to consider in fixing the
reasonableness of fees to be considered beyond the fee agreement alone include,
but are not limited to “(1) the time and labor required, the novelty and
difficulty of the questions involved, and the skill requisite to perform the
legal service properly; (2) the likelihood that the acceptance of the
particular employment will preclude other employment by the lawyer; (3) the fee
customarily charged in this locality for similar legal services; (4) the amount
involved and the results obtained; (5) the time limitations imposed by the
circumstances; and (6) the experience, reputation, and ability of the lawyer or
lawyers performing the services.” (Glendora Community Redevelopment
Agency v. Demeter (1984) 155 Cal.App.3d 465, 470.)
 
B.    
Plaintiff is entitled to recover
attorney’s fees
 
In any action “on a contract” that provides for the prevailing
party’s recovery of attorneys’ fees, the prevailing party “shall be entitled to
[an award of] reasonable attorneys’ fees.”¿(Civ. Code, § 1717.)
 
Here, Plaintiff presents a copy of the Vendor Direct to Customer
Agreements underlying Plaintiff’s complaint.  (Allyn Decl., Exhs. 1 & 2.) 
The contracts include an attorneys’ fees provision which states, “If any
action, suit or other proceeding is instituted concerning or arising out of
this Agreement, the prevailing party shall recover from the nonprevailing party
all such party’s reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred in each and every such
action, suit or other proceeding, including any and all appeals and petitions
therefrom.” (Allyn Decl.,
Exhs. 1 & 2.) 
 
On March 28,
2024, the Court granted Plaintiff’s motion for summary adjudication against
Dress Barn and Stein Mart as to Plaintiff’s claim for breach of contract
against them. On April 11, 2024, based upon the order granting summary
adjudication and the stipulations of the parties as to liability and damages,
the Court entered judgment against all Defendants. (Allyn Decl., ¶ 15.) 
 
Therefore,
Plaintiff is a prevailing party in this action. Since the contracts provide
that Plaintiff is entitled to recover costs and
attorneys’ fees in connection with prevailing on its enforcement of the
right to payment under those contracts, Plaintiff is entitled to its reasonable
attorneys’ fees in this action. (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal. 4th
1122, 1131.)
 
C.    
Hourly Rate/Reasonable Hours Incurred 
 
“The
reasonable hourly rate is that prevailing in the community for similar
work.”  (PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095.) “The
experienced trial judge is the best judge of the value of professional services
rendered in [her] court.” (Ibid.) 
 
“A
trial court assessing attorney fees begins with a touchstone or lodestar
figure, based on the ‘careful compilation of the time spent and reasonable
hourly compensation of each attorney ... involved in the presentation of the
case.”  (Christian Research Institute v. Alnor (2008) 165
Cal.App.4th 1315, 1321.) “The reasonableness of attorney fees is within the
discretion of the trial court, to be determined from a consideration of such
factors as the nature of the litigation, the complexity of the issues, the
experience and expertise of counsel and the amount of time involved. The court
may also consider whether the amount requested is based upon unnecessary or
duplicative work.” (Wilkerson v. Sullivan (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 443,
448.) 
 
While
not per se objectionable, block billing can exacerbate the vagueness of an
attorney fee request and support a court’s finding that time entries were
inflated and non-compensable.  (Christian Research Institute v. Alnor
(2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1325-1326.) 
 
Plaintiff
seeks to recover a total of $47,960.50 in attorneys’ fees for work completed by several attorneys
and paralegals with varying hourly rates.
 
In Plaintiff’s counsel declaration, Russell Allyn sets forth that he
billed at a rate of $525 an hour; that attorney Michael Fuoroli billed at a
rate of $340
an hour; and that attorney Mathew Kramer billed at a rate of $325 an hour. (Allyn
Decl., ¶¶ 17-18.) Mr. Allyn attests to their experience and reasonableness of
the rates. (Ibid.)
 
The Court finds that the rates requested by Plaintiff
is reasonable and commensurate with rates charged by attorneys with comparable
skill and expertise. Based on the evidence before it, the Court is not inclined
to reduce the hourly rates requested.
 
Plaintiff submitted invoices and statements to
support its requested attorneys’ fees. (Allyn Decl., Exhs. 4 & 5.) The
Court notes that upon review of Plaintiff’s attached billing records, the
invoice shows 0.9 hours billed for Joshua Mizrahi at a rate of $455 an hour and
0.5 hours billed for Anthony J. Napolitano at a rate of $510 an hour. Plaintiff’s
counsel’s declaration does not identify or attest to the reasonableness of Mr.
Mizrahi or Mr. Napolitano’s rates. Therefore, the Court is not inclined to include
these fees totaling $664.
 
Plaintiff’s billing
application shows the total amount of attorneys’ fees that Plaintiff’s counsel
billed to its client in this matter from December 2022 through March 2024. The Court has
considered the sought attorney fees based on the stated tasks and does not find
them unreasonable in light of the work completed by counsel in this case. Further,
verified cost bills are “prima facie evidence the costs, expenses and services
listed were necessarily incurred…” (Hadley v. Krepel (1985) 167
Cal.App.3d 677, 682). In light of the uncontroverted evidence in support and
its own experience, the Court finds the hourly rates and work billed by counsel
reasonable. (See Morris v. Hyundai Motor America (2019) 41 Cal.App.5th
24, 41, as modified (Oct. 11, 2019), review denied (Jan. 2,
2020).) 
 
Plaintiff anticipated additional attorneys’ fees to review Defendants’
Opposition, prepare Plaintiff’s Reply, and to prepare for and attend the motion
hearing, at a rate of $525 an hour for 2 hours, totaling $1,050. (Allyn Decl.,
¶ 20.) Since the motion is unopposed, the Court will only include an hour of
these anticipated fees for Plaintiff to prepare for and attend the motion
hearing. 
 
Plaintiff also filed a Memorandum of Costs seeking the recovery of
its filing and service costs in connection with this matter. The “prevailing
party is entitled as a matter of right to recover costs in any action or
proceeding.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd. (b).) Thus, the Court further awards Plaintiff’s requested costs
for $1,979.33. 
 
Accordingly, this Court grants Plaintiff a reduced amount of
attorneys’ fees totaling $46,771.50 and costs totaling $1,979.33. The Court awards Plaintiff a total amount of $48,750.83 in
attorney fees and costs. 
 
III.

Plaintiff’s Motion for
Attorneys’ Fees is GRANTED. The Court awards Plaintiff $48,750.83 in attorneys’ fees and
costs.
