And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has ruled that the defendants' demurrer to the plaintiff's complaint is overruled. The plaintiff, Montebello (Edens), LLC, has alleged that the defendants, Tash Dental Corporation, et al., failed to pay rent on the premises at 880-B West Beverly Boulevard in Montebello, California, and is seeking to evict them. The defendants argued that the plaintiff did not have the right to collect rent because the lease does not name the plaintiff as the landlord, but the court found that the plaintiff's allegation that it is the owner of the real property is sufficient at this stage. The court also declined to impose sanctions on the defendants for filing a frivolous demurrer. The case will proceed to a hearing on June 27, 2024.
