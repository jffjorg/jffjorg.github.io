 Case Number:  24SMCV03927    Hearing Date:   August 15, 2024    Dept:  I The court will inquire of plaintiff as to what jurisdiction
this court has over the matter.  The
various orders appear regular on their face and do not seem to be
forgeries.  If in fact they are orders
that issued from the Probate Court—even if procured improperly—this court has
no right to overturn them.  Plaintiff
needs to go back to the department and judge that issued the orders and seek
relief there.  Because this court has no
jurisdiction, the application is DENIED without prejudice to renewal in the
proper department.
