```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering an application to continue the motion for summary judgment (MSJ) and is concerned that the defendants' need for depositions is an emergency of their own making. The defendants had set deposition dates unilaterally and provided minimal notice, which did not work for the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs have only recently provided alternative dates, but the defense counsel is only available for depositions on August 20 and 21. The judge is considering continuing the MSJ by one week to September 12, 2024, with opposition and reply tied to the new hearing date. The judge will hear the motion less than 30 days before trial, and may allow the use of rough transcripts in lieu of certified transcripts.
