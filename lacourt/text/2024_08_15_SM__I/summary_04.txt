And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case, sustaining the demurrer (a motion to dismiss) filed by Mashian, the defendant. The court has found that Miles, the plaintiff, has not pled a viable theory of fraud against Mashian. Miles alleged that Mashian failed to disclose a plan to double bill Viridity and Miles, and that this failure was a material omission that led to Miles's decision to enter into the business transaction. However, the court has found that this theory is not supported by sufficient facts and is essentially a "wild theory" with no basis in reality. The court has also found that discovery (the process of exchanging information and evidence) would not have changed the outcome, as the facts alleged by Miles are not sufficient to establish a legally cognizable theory. As a result, the demurrer is sustained without leave to amend, and the discovery motions are moot.
