And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Defendant Yuan Shi's motion to quash the deposition subpoena served on Mucker Capital, which seeks financial records related to Defendant's new venture capital fund, AI List. The judge found that the subpoena was properly served, despite Defendant's argument that it was not actually served until October 1, 2024. The judge also concluded that the information sought in the subpoena is relevant to Plaintiff's claim of unjust enrichment and that Defendant's privacy rights do not outweigh the need for the information. The judge noted that "where the financial information goes to the heart of the cause of action itself, a litigant should not be denied access" to the information requested in the subpoena. As a result, the judge denied Defendant's motion and ordered Defendant to give notice.
