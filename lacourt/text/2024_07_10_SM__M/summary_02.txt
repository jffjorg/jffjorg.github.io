And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, GS Redwood Property LLC and Greystar California Inc., moves for an award of attorneys' fees pursuant to Civil Code section 1942.4 and Rule of Court, rule 3.1702. The defendant seeks attorneys' fees in the amount of at least $169,139.20 and an award of costs in the amount of $63,749.55. The defendant also moves to tax the plaintiff's verified memorandum of costs.

The court finds that the defendant is the prevailing party on the habitability claims and may recover their attorneys' fees. The court uses the lodestar method to determine a reasonable fee and finds that a reasonable fee in this instance would be $111,631.87, which represents 534.86 hours of attorney time at the approved rate.

The court denies the defendant's request to tax the plaintiff's costs, finding that the cited costs are expressly allowed by statute and that the defendant does not meet the burden of demonstrating that such costs were not reasonable or necessary.

The court grants the defendant's motion for attorneys' fees in the amount of $111,631.87.
