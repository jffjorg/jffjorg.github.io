English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the motion to compel arbitration in this case, which involves a dispute between The Loretta LLC (Plaintiff) and ZGB Homes Inc. et al. (Defendant) regarding a purchase agreement. The judge found that the parties have signed an arbitration agreement that covers the claims at issue, and that Plaintiff's principal, Rebekah Gainsley, signed the agreement on behalf of Loretta. The judge also found that Gainsley had authority to bind Loretta to the agreement, and that the arbitration agreement would include claims related to construction defects in the purchased property. The judge denied Plaintiff's argument that it is not in privity of contract with Defendant, and instead found that the parties are bound by the arbitration agreement. The judge ordered the action to proceed to arbitration, but stayed the action against Defendant until the completion of arbitration. A status conference is set for December 5, 2024, to discuss the arbitration proceedings.
