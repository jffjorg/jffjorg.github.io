Attorneys’ Fees
 
With respect to attorney fees
and costs, unless they are specifically provided for by statute (e.g., CCP §§
1032, et seq.), the measure and mode of compensation of attorneys and
counselors at law is left to the agreement, express or implied, of the parties.¿(CCP
§ 1021.) The prevailing party on a contract, which specifically provides for
attorney fees and costs incurred to enforce the agreement, is entitled to
reasonable attorney fees in addition to other costs.¿(Civ. Code § 1717(a); CCP
§§ 1032, 1033.5(a)(10)(A).)¿The court, upon notice and motion by a party, shall
determine the prevailing party and shall fix, as an element of the costs of
suit, the reasonable attorney fees.¿(Civ. Code § 1717(a), (b).)¿Any notice of
motion to claim attorney fees as an element of costs under shall be served and
filed before or at the same time the memorandum of costs is served and filed;
if only attorney fees are claimed as costs, the notice of motion shall be
served and filed within the time specified in CRC 3.1700 for filing a
memorandum of costs.¿(CRC 3.1702; Gunlock Corp. v. Walk on Water, Inc.
(1993) 15 Cal.App.4th 1301, 1303, fn. 1.) 
 
“It is well established that
the determination of what constitutes reasonable attorney fees is committed to
the discretion of the trial court, whose decision cannot be reversed in the
absence of an abuse of discretion. [Citation.]” (Melnyk v. Robledo
(1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 618, 623 624.) The fee setting inquiry in California
ordinarily “begins with the ‘lodestar’ [method], i.e., the number of hours
reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate.” (Graciano v.
Robinson Ford Sales, Inc. (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 140, 154.) “[A]
computation of time spent on a case and the reasonable value of that time is
fundamental to a determination of an appropriate attorneys’ fee award.” (Margolin
v. Reg’l Planning Comm’n (1982) 134 Cal.App.3d 999, 1004.) The lodestar
figure may then be adjusted, based on consideration of factors specific to the
case, in order to fix the fee at the fair market value for the legal services
provided. (See Serrano v. Priest (1977) 20 Cal.3d 25, 49 [discussing
factors relevant to proper attorneys’ fees award].) Such an approach anchors
the trial court’s analysis to an objective determination of the value of the
attorney’s services, ensuring that the amount awarded is not arbitrary. (Id.
at 48, fn. 23.) The factors considered in determining the modification of the
lodestar include “(1) the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, (2)
the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the extent to which the nature of
the litigation precluded other employment by the attorneys, (4) the contingent
nature of the fee award.” (Mountjoy v. Bank of Am. (2016) 245
Cal.App.4th 266, 271.) 
 
In challenging attorney fees as
excessive because too many hours of work are claimed, it is the burden of the
challenging party to point to the specific items challenged, with a sufficient
argument and citations to the evidence.¿(Premier Medical Management Systems,
Inc. v. California Ins. Guaranty Assoc. (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 550,
564.)¿General arguments that fees claimed are excessive, duplicative, or
unrelated do not suffice. (Ibid.) 

 
Costs
 
The “prevailing party” is
entitled as a matter of right to recover costs for suit in any action or
proceeding. (CCP § 1032(b); Santisas v. Goodin (1998) 17 Cal.4th 599,
606; Scott Co. Of Calif. v. Blount, Inc. (1999) 20 Cal.4th 1103, 1108.)
“Prevailing party” includes the party with a net monetary recovery, a defendant
in whose favor a dismissal is entered, a defendant where neither plaintiff nor
defendant obtains any relief, and a defendant as against those plaintiffs who
do not recover any relief against that defendant. (CCP § 1032 (a)(4).) 
 
“Allowable costs shall be
reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation rather than merely
convenient or beneficial to its preparation.” (CCP § 1033.5(c)(2).) “If the
items appearing in a cost bill appear to be proper charges, the burden is on the
party seeking to tax costs to show that they were not reasonable or necessary.”
(Ladas v. California State Auto. Assn. (1993) 19 Cal. App. 4th 761,
774.) On the other hand, if the items are properly objected to, they are put in
issue and the burden of proof is on the party claiming them as costs. (Ibid.)
 
Analysis
 

Defendants GS Redwood Property LLC
and Greystar California Inc. (“Defendants”) move for an award of attorneys’
fees pursuant to Civil Code section 1942.4 and Rule of Court, rule 3.1702.
Defendants seek attorney’s fees in the amount of at least $169,139.20, and an
award of costs in the amount of $63,749.55. Defendants also move to tax
Plaintiff Wendy Klenk’s verified memorandum of costs, filed January 31, 2024.
 
Defendants’ Costs
 
Defendants claim $63,749.55 in
costs. However, Defendants failed to file a memorandum of costs as required by
California Rules of Court (CRC), rule 3.1700. “A prevailing party who claims
costs must serve and file a memorandum of costs within 15 days after the date
of service of the notice of entry of judgment[.]” (CRC Rule 3.1700(a).)
Judgment was entered on December 20, 2023. Notice was filed on January 11,
2024. Plaintiff timely filed a memorandum of costs as the prevailing party at
trial on January 31, 2024. Defendants did not file or serve any memorandum of
costs. The instant motion for fees and costs was not filed until February 20,
2024. Thus, the request for costs is untimely. Defendants contend that a
memorandum of costs is not required for attorneys’ fees pursuant to CRC Rule
3.1702. Indeed, no memorandum of costs is required for attorneys’ fees
unless such fees “are fixed without the necessity of a court determination.”
(CRC Rule. 3.1702(e).) However, the instant request concerns costs outside of
attorneys’ fees. Notably, Rule 3.1702 does not refer to such costs at all.
Thus, Defendants were not excused from CRC Rule 3.1700’s requirement that a
memorandum of costs be filed within 15 days of service of notice of judgment to
recover costs as a prevailing party. Since Defendants failed to comply with
this mandatory provision, costs cannot be awarded.
 
Furthermore, the Court would disallow
the costs claimed for inspection and testing. (Ward Decl., Ex. E.) Such costs
are not expressly allowed by statute. (CCP § 1033.5(b)(1)-(2), (c)(2).) If
considered on the merits, the Court would strike the request for $23,916.40 and
for $8,635.00 related to testing/inspection of the property.
 
Accordingly, the motion is DENIED
as to the cost request.
 
Attorneys’ Fees
 
Section 1942.4(b)(2) provides for recovery of
reasonable attorney’s fees to the prevailing party in a suit between landlord
and tenant regarding untenable conditions. The trial court has
discretion to determine which party, if any, is the prevailing party “on a
practical level.” (Galan v. Wolfriver Holding Corp., (2000) 80 Cal. App.
4th 1124, 1128.) “A prevailing defendant ‘may recover only reasonable attorney
fees incurred in [its] defense of the action by [the plaintiff].’” (Hill v.
Affirmed Housing Group (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 1192, 1197.) “‘To the extent
[a prevailing defendant’s] shared counsel engaged in litigation activity on
behalf of [a codefendant] for which fees are not recoverable, the [trial] court
has broad discretion to apportion fees.’” (Id.) “‘A court may apportion
fees even where the issues are connected, related or intertwined.’”  (Id.) “And ‘‘although time-keeping and
billing procedures may make a requested segregation difficult, they do not,
without more, make it impossible.’’”  (Id.)
Attorneys’ fees “need not be apportioned when incurred for representation on an
issue common to both a cause of action in which fees are proper and one in
which they are not allowed.’” (Dane-Elec Corp., USA v. Bodokh (2019) 35
Cal.App.5th 761, 771.) “Thus, ‘[a]pportionment is not required when the claims
for relief are so intertwined that it would be impracticable, if not
impossible, to separate the attorney’s time into compensable and noncompensable
units.’”  (Id. at 771-72.) 
 
Defendants prevailed on the section
1942.4 claim and other
related habitability issues. On November 28, 2023, the Court
granted Defendants’ motion for judgment of nonsuit on the section 1942.4 claim.
The Court found that Plaintiff failed to submit any evidence on the elements
related to an inspection, notice of abatement, and delay without good cause. (See
Civ. Code §1942.4(a)(2), (3).) Later, on November 30, 2023, the jury returned
its verdict in favor of Defendants on the habitability claim, the quiet enjoyment
claim, and the nuisance claim, and in favor of Plaintiff on the negligence
claim. While the statutory claim was not presented to the jury, the jury
considered and rejected the related common law habitability claims. Plaintiff
decidedly lost on the habitability issues, including the statutory claim which
would have entitled her to attorneys’ fees. Despite losing on the majority of
her claims, and recovering only a small percentage of damages actually requested,
Plaintiff did prevail at trial with a recovery of $58,000.00 on her negligence
claim.  However, on a practical level, Defendants
are the prevailing party as to the habitability claims, and Defendants may
recover their attorneys’ fees.
 
In their opposition, Plaintiff
argued that all the claims are intertwined and that all of counsel’s work related
to all of the claims.  As such, Plaintiff
argues that apportionment of fees between the claims is appropriate.  Plaintiff requests that the Court reduce the
fee award by 50%.
 
 Here, Defendants submitted detailed time
records for the legal work performed. Defendants’ attorneys billed 810.4 hours at
$237 per hour for a total of $169,139.20. (Ward Decl., Ex. D, G.) The Court
finds the reduced hourly rate reasonable in light of counsels’ experience,
education and expertise. 
 
The Court will apportion the fees
to reflect the mixed success of the Defendants and the interrelated nature of
the causes of action. In light of the entirety of the record, and using the
lodestar method, the Court finds that a reasonable fee in this instance would
be $111,631.87, which represents 534.86 hours of attorney time at the approved
rate. 
 
Accordingly, the motion is GRANTED
in the amount of $111,631.87.
 
Motion to Tax Plaintiff’s Costs
 
Defendants
move to tax Plaintiff Wendy Klenk’s verified memorandum of costs, filed on January
31, 2024. While Defendants prevailed on the habitability claim, Plaintiff
should still be considered the prevailing party at trial. On December 20, 2023,
the Court entered judgment against Defendants Greystar California, Inc. and GS
Redwood Properties, LLC, jointly and severally, in the sum of $58,000, in favor
of Plaintiff. Thus, Plaintiff is entitled to allowable costs under Code of
Civil Procedure section 1033.5.
 
Defendants request the Court tax
from Plaintiff’s Memorandum of Costs the following items: 
 
Item 1 - Filing and motions
fees of $696.54 
Item 4 - Deposition costs
$3,567.45 
Item 5 - Service of process
$142 
Item 11 - Court reporter
fees $3,387.50
 
As to each item, Defendants
argue that the verified costs are unreasonable because Plaintiff does
not provide any detail for the Court to determine if Plaintiff is seeking
proper costs. However, the cited costs are expressly allowed by statute. (CCP §
1033.5(a)(1), (3), (4), (11).) Plaintiff provided a verified memorandum of
costs, confirming that the sought costs are correct and were necessarily
incurred in the case. Therefore, the burden is on Defendants to demonstrate that such
costs were not reasonable or necessary. Defendants do not meet this burden by
merely suggesting that Plaintiff must present further details beyond the
verified memorandum.  
 
Accordingly, the motion is DENIED.
