for Terminating Sanctions

Legal
Standard
            
If a party fails to obey a
court order compelling it to provide a discovery response, “the court may make
those orders that are just, including the imposition of an issue sanction, an
evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction . . .. In lieu of or in addition
to this sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction . . ..” (CCP §§
2030.290(c), 2030.300(e), 2031.300(c), 2031.320(c).) Misuse of the discovery
process, which includes disobeying a court order to provide discovery, is
conduct subject to sanctions. (CCP § 2023.010(g).) Possible sanctions are: 
 
(a) [A] monetary sanction
ordering that one engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any
attorney advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses, including
attorney's fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct . . .. 
 
(b) [A]n issue sanction
ordering that designated facts shall be taken as established in the action in
accordance with the claim of the party adversely affected by the misuse of the
discovery process. The court may also impose an issue sanction by an order
prohibiting any party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process from
supporting or opposing designated claims or defenses. 
 
(c) [A]n evidence sanction by
an order prohibiting any party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process
from introducing designated matters in evidence. 
 
(d) [A] terminating sanction by
one of the following orders: 
 
(1) An order
striking out the pleadings or parts of the pleadings of any party engaging in
the misuse of the discovery process. 
 
(2) An order
staying further proceedings by that party until an order for discovery is
obeyed. 
 
(3) An order
dismissing the action, or any part of the action, of that party. 
 
(4) An order
rendering a judgment by default against that party. 
 
(e) [A] contempt sanction by an
order treating the misuse of the discovery process as a contempt of court. 
 
(CCP § 2023.030.) 
 
The party seeking to impose
sanctions need only show the failure to obey earlier discovery orders. (Puritan
Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1985) 171 Cal.App.3d 877, 884 [interpreting
former statute dealing with “refusal” to comply].) However, numerous cases hold
that severe sanctions (i.e., terminating or evidentiary sanctions) for failure
to comply with a court order are allowed only where the failure was willful. (R.S.
Creative, Inc. v. Creative Cotton, Ltd. (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 486, 495; Vallbona
v. Springer (1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 1525, 1545; Biles v. Exxon Mobil Corp.
(2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1327.) The burden of proof then shifts to the
party seeking to avoid sanctions to establish a satisfactory excuse for his or
her conduct. (Corns v. Miller (1986) 181 Cal.App.3d 195, 201.) 
 
Analysis
 

Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant DM
Properties LLC moves for an order imposing terminating sanctions against
Defendant/Cross Complainant Daryll Robertson. Plaintiff asserts that Defendant
has violated this Court's April 11, 2024, Order compelling Defendant's
deposition and production of documents. Plaintiff also seeks monetary sanctions
in the amount of $1,200.00.
 
Plaintiff argues that terminating
sanctions are justified because Defendant failed to appear for his deposition
and provide substantive responses to the records requests, despite the prior
court order. On April 11, 2024, following a duly noticed motion by Plaintiff, the
Court ordered Defendant to appear for deposition and produce responsive
documents within 10 days. (Kakoian Decl., ¶2, Ex. A.) The Court also ordered
Defendant to pay monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,200.00 to Plaintiff
within 30 days. (Id.) Plaintiff promptly served Defendant with notice of the
Court-ordered deposition on April 12, 2024, setting it for April 19, 2024, at
10:00 a.m. via Zoom. (Kakoian Decl., ¶3, Ex. B.) Plaintiff worked with a deposition
officer to ensure Defendant received notice. The deposition officer, Jorge
Fernandez of Veritext, called Defendant and left a voicemail requesting his
email address to send the Zoom link. (Kakoian Decl., ¶4, Ex. C.) Plaintiff's
counsel also mailed Defendant a letter with the deposition Zoom link and Mr.
Fernandez's contact information on April 12, 2024. (Id. at ¶5, Ex. B.) Despite
these efforts, Defendant failed to appear for his duly noticed deposition on
April 19, 2024. (Kakoian Decl., ¶ 6.) 
 
Plaintiff has shown that Defendant
refuses to cooperate with the Court’s discovery orders. As Defendant has notice
of these proceedings and order, the Court can only interpret this as a willful
refusal of the order. The burden is therefore on Defendant to demonstrate a satisfactory
excuse for his failure. Defendant has failed to oppose, and therefore failed to
demonstrate such an excuse.
 
Accordingly, the motion is
GRANTED.  The Court strikes Defendant’s
answer and enters his default.  Defendant’s
cross-complaint is also dismissed by the Court with prejudice.  Plaintiff to prepare a default judgment
package. 
 
In light of these sanctions,
the Court does not impose any additional monetary sanctions against Defendant.
