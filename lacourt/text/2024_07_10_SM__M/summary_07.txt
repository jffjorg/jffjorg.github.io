Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering whether Colonial Manor had the right to impose an unlimited rent increase on a unit occupied by Vilma Reyes, the spouse of the original occupant, Milton Reyes, who passed away in 2023. The judge concludes that Vilma Reyes is not an assignee or subtenant of Milton Reyes and that the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act does not authorize a rental increase that would violate Santa Monica's rent control ordinance.

The judge also considers whether Colonial Manor and Vilma Reyes created a new tenancy in 2021 or February 2022, which would have established a rental rate of $666.00, including all surcharges. The judge finds that the evidence supports the conclusion that Colonial Manor and Vilma Reyes created a new tenancy and that the rental rate was established at $666.00.

Overall, the judge's tentative ruling concludes that Colonial Manor did not have the right to impose an unlimited rent increase on the unit and that the rental rate was established at $666.00, including all surcharges.
