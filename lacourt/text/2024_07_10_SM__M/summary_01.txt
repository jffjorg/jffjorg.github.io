And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the motion to quash service of summons filed by the Royal Bank of Canada, RBC Bank (Georgia) N.A., David McKay, and Maria Douvas (RBC Parties) is GRANTED. The RBC Parties argue that the court lacks personal jurisdiction over them and that the service of process on them was invalid.

The judge finds that the RBC Parties lack the minimum contacts with California necessary for the court to exercise personal jurisdiction over them. The court also finds that the service of process on the RBC Parties was invalid because it was not served on a person authorized to receive service on behalf of the RBC Parties.

The judge notes that the RBC Parties are a multi-national public company with principal offices in Toronto, Canada, and that they do not have any branches in California. The judge also finds that McKay and Douvas are not domiciled in California and that RBC Bank is a separate National Banking Association with its principal business office in Raleigh, North Carolina.

The judge concludes that the court lacks jurisdiction over the RBC Parties and that the motion to quash is GRANTED.
