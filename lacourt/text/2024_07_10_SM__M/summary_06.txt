Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Nassara, LLC v. Stoll, et al., granting the Kims' motion to compel arbitration of Plaintiff's claims. The Kims contend that the parties signed an arbitration agreement in the Purchase Agreement, which requires disputes to be resolved through binding arbitration. The Judge finds that the Kims met their burden to demonstrate the existence of an arbitration agreement between the parties that covers Plaintiff's claims and that Plaintiff fails to demonstrate any defense to enforcement. The Judge orders the action to be stayed as to the Kims, pending completion of the arbitration. A status conference is set for June 3, 2025, at 8:30 a.m. to discuss the arbitration process.
