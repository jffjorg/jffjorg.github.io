And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has granted the motion for leave to amend to file a Fourth Amended Cross Complaint, except for the request for attorneys' fees which remains stricken. The proposed amendment seeks to add new causes of action and allegations to the cross-complaint, including fraud claims with increased specificity and claims regarding the creation and ownership of intellectual property. The court found that the delay in bringing the motion was partly mitigated by the stipulated stay of proceedings and meet and confer efforts. The court also noted that the proposed amendment does not significantly expand the scope of the litigation and will not cause significant delays in trial. The court will address any substantive challenges to the proposed amendment in a procedurally proper manner, such as a demurrer or motion to strike.
