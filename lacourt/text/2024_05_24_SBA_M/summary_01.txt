Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants Plaintiff Rose Marie Krawczyk's motion for trial preference under Code of Civil Procedure section 36(a). The plaintiff, who is over 70 years old and has a health condition, seeks a preferential trial setting to prevent prejudicing her interest in the litigation. The court finds that the plaintiff has met the requirements of section 36(a) and grants the motion. The court notes that there is no weighing of interests involved in granting the motion. The court also addresses Defendant Clipboard Health, LLC's due process concerns regarding its ability to oppose the motion and prepare for trial. The court finds that these concerns are speculative at this time. The trial date is set for a later date, which will be determined. The plaintiff is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
