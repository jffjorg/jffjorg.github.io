And here is the English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge grants Pacific Employers Insurance Company's motion to seal the settlement agreement, which contains confidential financial information, for purposes of this filing only and without prejudice to any party's future motion to unseal. The Judge finds that there is an overriding interest in protecting personal financial information and confidential settlement agreements, and that this interest overcomes the right of public access. The Judge also finds that the sealing order is properly tailored to seal only the document that reveals the confidential information, and that there is no less restrictive means to protect the parties' privacy interests. The Judge notes that the California Supreme Court has held that the privacy of a settlement is generally understood and accepted in our legal system, and that routine public disclosure of private settlement terms would chill the parties' ability to settle the action before trial.
