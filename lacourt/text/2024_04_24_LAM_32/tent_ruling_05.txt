  Case No.:  24STCP00343
  Hearing Date:  April 24, 2024
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
petitioner’s motion for attorneys’ fees 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On February 2, 2024, Petitioner Book
and Vig, LLC initiated this proceeding by filing a petition to confirm the
arbitration award issued in its case against Respondent 8029 Sunset, LLC.
Respondent opposed the petition and argued that the award should be corrected.
The Court rejected Respondent’s arguments and confirmed the award as requested
on March 25, 2024. In that order, the Court held that Petitioner was entitled
to recover attorneys’ fees incurred in relation to the petition but reserved
adjudication on the reasonableness of the amount for a future motion. 
            On March 27, 2024, Petitioner filed
the instant motion for attorneys’ fees. Respondent filed its opposition on
April 11, 2024. Petitioner filed its reply on April 16, 2024. 
LEGAL STANDARD
Code of Civil Procedure section 1293.2
authorizes the court to award fees and costs in judicial proceedings related to
arbitration. “Such judicial proceedings may include a petition to confirm,
correct or vacate an award.” (Carole Ring & Assocs. v. Nicastro
(2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 253, 260.) The determination is governed by the same
principles applicable to normal fee awards, meaning “[a]ttorney fees are
recoverable as costs if authorized by contract.” (Corona v. Amherst Partners
(2003) 107 Cal.App.4th 701, 707.) 
DISCUSSION
            Here, the parties’ contract provides
for attorneys’ fees to the prevailing party. (See Attachment 4(b) to Petition,
§ 21.14.) Petitioner is the prevailing party in this post-arbitration judicial
proceeding because Petitioner successfully moved to confirm the
arbitration award in the face of Respondent’s opposition. Therefore, Petitioner
is entitled to recover costs and attorneys’ fees associated with the petition. 
            Petitioner claims to have spent 24.1
hours at a rate of $750 per hour. (Shackelford Decl. ¶¶ 4-5.) Neither of these
amounts is proportionate to the complexity of the issues involved. The Court
finds that $500 per hour is the reasonable hourly rate, and the reasonable
number of hours is 12 hours. Respondent does not dispute the $1,917 in costs.
Therefore, the total award is $7,917.  
CONCLUSION
            Petitioner’s motion for attorneys’
fees is GRANTED in the amount of $7,917.
