BACKGROUND            On April 28, 2023, Plaintiffs Lexi
Burrows and Brooklynn Lundberg filed this employment action against Defendants
Touchstone Golf, LLC, Ashley Walston, Peter Wagner, and the City of Burbank.
Plaintiffs assert claims stemming from harassment, discrimination and
retaliation, wrongful termination, and wage violations. Plaintiffs allege that
they experienced and spoke out against sexual harassment and discrimination,
and reported illegal or unsafe working conditions, only to suffer retaliation
for doing so.             On March 11, 2024, the Court denied
the motion to compel arbitration filed by Defendants Touchstone Golf, LLC and
City of Burbank. Defendants have appealed that decision.             On March 28, 2024, Defendants
Touchstone and Burbank filed the instant motion to stay the proceedings pending
the appeal. Plaintiffs filed their opposition on April 11, 2024. Defendants
filed their reply on April 17, 2024.  DISCUSSIONI.
Automatic Stay            Under Code of Civil Procedure
section 916(a), “the perfecting of an appeal stays proceedings in the trial
court upon the judgment or order appealed from or upon the matters embraced
therein or affected thereby.” Section 916 implements an automatic stay “to
protect the appellate court's jurisdiction by preserving the status quo until
the appeal is decided.” (Cunningham v. Magidow (2013) 219 Cal.App.4th
298, 303-304.) However, effective January 1, 2024, SB 365 amended Code of Civil
Procedure section 1294(a) to provide that “[n]otwithstanding Section 916, the
perfecting of . . . an appeal [from an order denying a petition to compel
arbitration] shall not automatically stay any proceedings in the trial court
during the pendency of the appeal.” Defendants argue that SB 365 is preempted
by the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA). II.
PreemptionThe FAA provides that “an agreement in
writing to submit to arbitration an existing controversy arising out of such a
contract, transaction, or refusal, shall be valid, irrevocable, and
enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the
revocation of any contract.” (9 U.S.C. § 2.) The FAA “requires courts to place
arbitration agreements ‘on equal footing with all other contracts.’” (Kindred
Nursing Ctrs. Ltd. P'ship v. Clark (2017) 581 U.S. 246, 248.) This means
that “[a] court may invalidate an arbitration agreement based on ‘generally
applicable contract defenses’ like fraud or unconscionability, but not on legal
rules that ‘apply only to arbitration or that derive their meaning from the
fact that an agreement to arbitrate is at issue.’” (Id. at p. 251.) A
state law is also preempted if it “interferes with fundamental attributes of
arbitration” or has a “disproportionate impact on arbitration.” (Chamber of
Commerce of the United States v. Bonta (9th Cir. 2023) 62 F.4th 473, 483.) In Coinbase, Inc. v. Bielski (2023)
599 U.S. 736, the U.S. Supreme Court held that a federal district court must
stay its proceedings during an interlocutory appeal of an order denying a
petition to compel arbitration. The court in Coinbase reasoned that “it
makes no sense for trial to go forward while the court of appeals cogitates on
whether there should be one.” (Id. at p. 1920.) “If the district court
could move forward with pre-trial and trial proceedings while the appeal on
arbitrability was ongoing, then many of the asserted benefits of arbitration
(efficiency, less expense, less intrusive discovery, and the like) would be
irretrievably lost—even if the court of appeals later concluded that the case
actually had belonged in arbitration all along.” (Id. at p. 1921.) While Coinbase did not directly
address preemption, it demonstrates how a law like SB 365 “interferes with
fundamental attributes of arbitration.” The entire purpose of arbitration is to
bypass the cost and time of traditional litigation. But as Coinbase
points out, those fundamental attributes would be “irretrievably lost” if
parties are required to litigate a matter that is subsequently determined to be
arbitrable. In this way, SB 365 makes it possible to effectively nullify
arbitration agreements. SB 365 creates an exception to the automatic stay rule
that applies only to arbitration. Therefore, SB 365 discriminates against
arbitration and is preempted by the FAA. Without SB 365, the case is
automatically stayed under Code of Civil Procedure section 916(a). III.
Discretionary StayEven without an automatic stay, “[c]ourts
have inherent authority to control their own calendars and dockets . . . .” (Walker
v. Superior Court (1991) 53 Cal.3d 257, 267.) This includes “the inherent
power to stay proceedings in the interests of justice and to promote judicial
efficiency.” (Freiberg v. City of Mission Viejo (1995) 33 Cal.App.4th
1484, 1489.)  In this case, the Court finds that a stay
is warranted for the reasons articulated in Coinbase. That is, the
entire point of arbitration would be defeated if the parties litigate the case
in court, only for the Court of Appeal to hold that the matter should have been
arbitrated. This would result in substantial prejudice to both parties and the
court in the form of duplication and waste. Plaintiffs’ sexual harassment claim must
be stayed as well due to the potential overlap of issues. “Because the issues
subject to litigation . . . might overlap those that are subject to arbitration
. . ., the trial court must order an appropriate stay of trial court
proceedings.” (Franco v. Arakelian Enterprises, Inc. (2015) 234
Cal.App.4th 947, 966.) “The stay's purpose is to preserve the status quo until
the arbitration is resolved, preventing any continuing trial court
proceedings from disrupting and rendering ineffective the arbitrator's
jurisdiction to decide the issues that are subject to arbitration.” (Ibid.)
Here, the Court has already found that “Plaintiffs’ claims involve their core
sexual harassment claim, arise out of the same facts and circumstances, involve
the same witnesses, and are intertwined such that they must proceed together.”
(March 11, 2024 Order re Mtn. to Compel Arb. 5:20-22.)In a case concerning disqualification of
counsel, it was pointed out that it is well settled that prejudice occurs if
the trial is not stayed pending an appeal of an arguably meritorious claim. (See,
Meehan v. Hopps (1995) 45 Cal.2nd 213, 218.)    The court finds that Defendants have an
arguably meritorious claim, and for this reason, Defendants’ motion to stay
should be granted.CONCLUSION            The motion to stay filed by
Defendants Touchstone Golf, LLC and City of Burbank is GRANTED.
