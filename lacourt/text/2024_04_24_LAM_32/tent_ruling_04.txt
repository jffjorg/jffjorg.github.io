  order RE:
defendant alhambra unified school
  district’s demurrer and motion to strike 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On September 27, 2023, Plaintiff
David Lee Terrell filed this employment discrimination complaint against
Defendant Alhambra Unified School District (AUSD). Plaintiff filed the
operative Second Amended Complaint on February 23, 2024. The SAC adds Defendants
Carlos Carillo, an individual named Robert, Steve Ballesteros, Stacie Colmon,
and John Scanlan. 
            On March 19, 2024, Defendant AUSD
filed the instant demurrer and motion to strike. Plaintiff filed his opposition
on April 1, 2024. Defendant filed its reply on April 17, 2024.
LEGAL STANDARD
A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether
the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When
considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in
context. (Taylor v. City of Los
Angeles Dept. of Water and Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228.)
In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the
pleading or by proper judicial notice. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.30, subd.
(a).) A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other
extrinsic matters. (SKF Farms v. Superior
Court (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 902, 905.) Therefore, it lies only where the
defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed. (Ibid.) The only issue involved in a
demurrer hearing is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with
extraneous matters, states a cause of action. (Hahn, supra, 147 Cal.App.4th at 747.)
Any party, within the time allowed to
respond to a pleading, may serve and file a notice of motion to strike the
whole or any part of that pleading. (Code Civ. Proc., § 435, subd. (b).) The
court may, upon a motion, or at any time in its discretion, and upon terms it
deems proper, strike (1) any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in
any pleading and (2) all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in
conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of the court.
(Id., § 436.) The grounds for moving to strike must appear on the face
of the pleading or by way of judicial notice. (Id., § 437.)
MEET AND CONFER
Before filing a demurrer or a motion to
strike, the demurring or moving party is required to meet and confer with the
party who filed the pleading demurred to or the pleading that is subject to the
motion to strike for the purposes of determining whether an agreement can be
reached through a filing of an amended pleading that would resolve the
objections to be raised in the demurrer. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 430.41, 435.5.)
The Court notes that Defendant has complied with the meet and confer
requirement. (See Frontman Decl.)
DISCUSSION
I.
Statute of Limitations
            Plaintiff bases his causes of action
on violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. A civil suit under
Title VII must be filed within 90 days of a notice of right to sue from the
EEOC. (42
U.S.C. § 2000e-5(f).) Exhibit C to the SAC indicates that the EEOC issued a
right to sue notice on May 19, 2022. EEOC sent a reminder of the notice on
September 23, 2022. The Civil Rights Department also issued a right to sue
letter on October 5, 2022. This action was filed more than 90 days after any of
the above dates. Therefore, the discrimination, harassment, retaliation, and
failure to prevent claims are time-barred. Plaintiff does not address this
defect in his opposition. 
II.
Government Claims Requirement
Under the Government Tort Claims Act, “no
suit for money or damages may be brought against a public entity on a cause of
action for which a claim is required to be presented . . . until a written
claim therefor has been presented to the public entity and has been acted upon
by the board, or has been deemed to have been rejected by the board . . . .”
(Gov. Code, § 945.4.) A plaintiff must file a lawsuit within six months after
notice of the board’s action on their claim. (Id., § 945.6.) “[F]ailure
to allege facts demonstrating or excusing compliance with the claim
presentation requirement subjects a claim against a public entity to a demurrer
for failure to state a cause of action.” (Lowry v. Port San Luis Harbor
Dist. (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th 211, 218.) 
The SAC contains no allegations supporting
this requirement, and Plaintiff ignores this defect in his opposition.
Therefore, the emotional distress, breach of contract, and defamation claims
fail as a matter of law. 
III.
Punitive Damages
            Because all of Plaintiff’s causes of
action fail as a matter of law, Plaintiff necessarily fails to state a basis
for punitive damages. 
CONCLUSION
            Defendant AUSD’s demurrer is
SUSTAINED without leave to amend. The motion to strike is GRANTED without leave
to amend.
