And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the motion to stay proceedings filed by Defendants Touchstone Golf, LLC and City of Burbank. The court finds that the automatic stay rule applies to this case, notwithstanding the amendment to Code of Civil Procedure section 916(a) by SB 365. The court concludes that SB 365 is preempted by the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) because it discriminates against arbitration agreements. The court also finds that a discretionary stay is warranted to promote judicial efficiency and prevent significant prejudice to the parties. The court has already found that the sexual harassment claim is intertwined with the arbitration agreement, and a stay is necessary to preserve the status quo until the appeal is resolved.
