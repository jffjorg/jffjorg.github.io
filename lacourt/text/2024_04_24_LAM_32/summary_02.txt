And here is the summary in plain English:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on the motion to set aside the default judgment. The case is about a lawsuit between Michael Levine (the plaintiff) and Matthew J. Eandi and William Fitzpatrick (the defendants) over a legal malpractice. The defendants failed to respond to the complaint, and a default judgment was entered. The defendants then filed a motion to set aside the default, claiming that they relied on Eandi to defend the action, but Eandi failed to respond to the complaint. The judge has denied the motion, finding that the defendants did not provide a satisfactory excuse for failing to defend the action, and did not exercise diligence in seeking relief.
