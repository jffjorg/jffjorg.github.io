Here is a summary of the tentative ruling:

The judge is considering a motion for summary judgment filed by Marc Cubas and Injected Arts, Inc. (Defendants) in a lawsuit brought by AMAG, Inc. (Plaintiff). The lawsuit stems from an underlying judgment where Vlaze was found liable to AMAG for unpaid loans. The Defendants argue that a 99-year lease executed by Marc Cubas and Susana Cubas is invalid and therefore there was no "transfer" of an "asset" for purposes of fraudulent transfer.

The judge has reviewed the evidence and has found that there are triable issues of fact regarding the authenticity of the lease, the authority of Marc Cubas to enter into the lease, and the validity of the lease. The judge has also found that the Defendants' arguments regarding the lease are not supported by the evidence.

The judge has denied the Defendants' motion for summary judgment and has allowed the case to proceed to trial.
