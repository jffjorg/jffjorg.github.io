And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by the plaintiff, Martina A. Silas, to reduce the hourly rate charged by the defense expert, Dr. Hamid R. Djalilian, from $2,000 to no more than $750 per hour. The judge has also prohibited Dr. Djalilian from imposing a 2-hour minimum fee for his deposition testimony.

The judge found that Dr. Djalilian's hourly rate is reasonable, given his specialty in tinnitus and Meniere's disease, and that it is comparable to other otolaryngologists. The judge also noted that the plaintiff's argument that Dr. Djalilian's rate is unreasonable because he only performed a small part of the defense medical examination is irrelevant, as the plaintiff is paying for Dr. Djalilian's time and can choose to depose him or not.

The judge denied the plaintiff's request to reduce Dr. Djalilian's rate to $895 per hour, citing that this rate is for reviewing records, not deposition testimony. The judge also noted that the plaintiff cannot compare the rates for two different services.

The judge granted the plaintiff's motion in part, finding that Dr. Djalilian's 2-hour minimum fee is unreasonable and prohibiting him from imposing it.
