And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted the motion for leave to file a First Amended Complaint (FAC) by Plaintiffs David Trujeque and Rosa Trujeque against Defendants Victory Outreach, Victory Outreach Eagle Rock, Roger Soto, Jasmine Galvez, Augie Barajas, Mary Barajas, and Victory Outreach International (VOI). The Plaintiffs seek to add new allegations and causes of action to their original complaint, which alleges wrongful death based on Defendants' failure to supervise the decedent's drug addiction.

The Judge has determined that the proposed amendments do not raise any issues of prejudice to the Defendant VOI, and that the Plaintiffs have provided sufficient evidence to support their claims. The Judge has also granted a trial continuance to allow sufficient time for VOI to file any motions and to provide sufficient time to conduct discovery.

The Judge has ordered Plaintiffs to file a separate copy of the FAC within 10 days, and has continued the trial date to a later date to be determined. The Judge has also continued the January 30, 2024 Final Status Conference to a later date to be determined.
