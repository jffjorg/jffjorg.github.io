Here is the summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendants' motion to continue the trial date in a lawsuit filed by Steve Cancian against Maximo Roman and Southern Counties Lubricants LLC. The trial was originally set for December 18, 2023, but the defendants requested a continuance to conduct Plaintiff's in-person deposition and complete a defense medical examination. The parties have agreed to mutually agreeable dates for the deposition and examination, which will be completed after Plaintiff's surgery. The judge finds good cause to continue the trial date to allow the parties sufficient time to conduct and complete discovery prior to the trial date. The trial date is continued to a new date in May 2024, and all related dates are continued to reflect the new trial date.
