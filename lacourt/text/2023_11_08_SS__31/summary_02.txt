And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling addresses a motion by Defendant Smart & Final Stores, LLC to compel Plaintiff Paul Martin to appear for an independent medical examination (IME) with Dr. Kvitne. The motion is now moot since the IME has already been completed. The only issue remaining is whether the Court should award sanctions, which Defendant seeks in the amount of $5,760 against Plaintiff and Plaintiff's counsel. The Court finds that Plaintiff acted with substantial justification in attempting to resolve the dispute over the parameters of the IME, and therefore does not find sanctions warranted. The request for sanctions is denied.
