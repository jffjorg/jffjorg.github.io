And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on CVS' motion to continue trial and reopen discovery. The motion was filed on October 16, 2023, and opposed by the plaintiff. The judge granted the motion for the limited purpose of allowing CVS to conduct an independent medical examination (IME) of the plaintiff with a pain management specialist. The judge also reopened expert discovery only in relation to the pain management expert to be conducting the plaintiff's IME. The judge's ruling is based on the plaintiff's failure to disclose medical records and expert testimony, and the need for CVS to conduct additional discovery to prepare for trial. The parties are encouraged to meet and confer to reach an agreement, and if a party intends to submit to the tentative ruling, they must send an email to the court with the subject line "SUBMIT" and the case number.
