Counsel, Justin Farahi, Esq., has been unable to confirm Plaintiff's address and location despite diligent efforts, and has therefore moved to be relieved as counsel. The Judge orders Counsel to serve the moving papers on both Plaintiff and the Clerk of the Court, located at Stanley Mosk Courthouse, and denies the motion without prejudice. The parties are encouraged to meet and confer to reach an agreement, and if a party intends to submit on the tentative ruling, they must send an email to the court.
