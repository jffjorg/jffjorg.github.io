And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on Defendant Doe #1's demurrer to Plaintiff John Doe D.D.'s Complaint. The court finds that the demurrer is without merit and overrules it in its entirety. The court holds that the Complaint's third to fifth causes of action, alleging childhood sexual abuse, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and negligence, are sufficient to state a cause of action against Defendant Doe #1. The court also finds that the Complaint's fourth cause of action, alleging failure to report suspected child abuse, is sufficient to state a cause of action against Defendant Doe #1. The court rejects Defendant Doe #1's arguments that the Complaint's third to fifth causes of action are unconstitutional and that the Complaint's fourth cause of action fails because it does not provide mandated reporter liability. The court finds that the Legislature's passage of Assembly Bill 218, which created liability for public entities like Defendant Doe #1 for childhood sexual abuse, serves a public purpose and is not unconstitutional. The court also finds that the allegations in the Complaint are sufficient to trigger a mandated reporter duty and that the identity of the mandated reporters can be resolved through discovery.
