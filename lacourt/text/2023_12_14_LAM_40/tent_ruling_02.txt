 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
Plaintiff Creditors Adjustment Bureau, Inc.’s Motion for Order Allowing Plaintiff to
  File First Amended Complaint.



 
Background
Pleadings
On May 26, 2022, Plaintiff
Creditors Adjustment Bureau, Inc. (CAB)—as assignee of interests held by State
Compensation Insurance Fund (Assignor or State Fund)—sued Defendant J and S
Painting, Inc. (J&S) and Does 1 through 10 pursuant to a Complaint alleging
claims of (1) Breach of Contract, (2) Open Book Account, (3) Account Stated,
and (4) Reasonable Value.
The claims arise from allegations
that Defendant J&S and Assignor entered into a written agreement wherein
the State Fund agreed to provide a policy of workers compensation insurance to
J&S, bearing Policy No. 9246526-19 and providing coverage for the period of
February 28, 2019 through February 28, 2020, for which J&S agreed to pay
premiums in accordance with the terms and conditions of said policy, only for
J&S to default on payments in the amount of $132,150.74.
On June 22, 2023, J&S sued CAB
pursuant to a Cross-Complaint alleging claims of Conversion and Negligence.
The claims arise from allegations
that CAB has failed to release the $98,969.45 levied from a J&S bank
account, in violation of an order made by this Court on June 9, 2023. (The June
9th order set aside a September 27, 2022 default judgment previously entered
against Defendant J&S, which supported a January 19, 2023 writ of execution
that resulted in the challenged levy.)
Motion Before the Court
On November 6, 2023, CAB moved for
an order that allows CAB to file a First Amended Complaint (FAC) in this
action. The proposed FAC is attached to the motion as Exhibit 1.
On November 30, 2023, J&S
opposed the motion.
On December 5, 2023, CAB replied to
the opposition.
CAB’s motion is now before the
Court.
Motion for Leave to Amend
Legal
Standard
California
Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (a)(1) provides, in relevant
part: “The court may, in furtherance of justice, and on any terms as may be
proper, allow a party to amend any pleading or proceeding by adding or striking
out the name of any party, or by correcting a mistake in the name of a party,
or a mistake in any other respect; and may, upon like terms, enlarge the time
for answer or demurrer. The court may likewise, in its discretion, after notice
to the adverse party, allow, upon any terms as may be just, an amendment to any
pleading or proceeding in other particulars; and may upon like terms allow an
answer to be made after the time limited by this code.”
Under
California Rules of Court Rule, rule 3.1324, subdivision (a), a motion to amend
a pleading shall: 
(1)
Include a copy of the proposed amendment or amended pleading, which must be
serially numbered to differentiate it from previous pleadings or amendments;
(2)
State what allegations in the previous pleading are proposed to be deleted, if
any, and where, by page, paragraph and line number, the deleted allegations are
located; and
(3)
State what allegations are proposed to be added to the previous pleading, if
any, and where, by page, paragraph, and line number, the additional allegations
are located.
Under
California Rules of Court, rule 3.1324, subdivision (b), a separate declaration
must accompany the motion and must specify:
(1)
The effect of the amendment;
(2)
Why the amendment is necessary and proper;
(3)
When the facts giving rise to the amended allegations were discovered; and
(4)
The reasons why the request for amendment was not made earlier.
“This
discretion should be exercised liberally in favor of amendments, for judicial
policy favors resolution of all disputed matters in the same lawsuit.” (Kittredge
Sports Co. v. Superior Court (1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 1045, 1047 (Kittredge
Sports).) Ordinarily, the court will not consider the validity of the
proposed amended pleading in ruling on a motion for leave since grounds for a
demurrer or motion to strike are premature; however, the Court does have
discretion to deny leave to amend where a proposed amendment fails to state a
valid cause of action as a matter of law and the defect cannot be cured by
further amendment. (See California Casualty General Ins. Co. v. Superior
Court (1985) 173 Cal.App.3d 274, 281 (California Casualty),
overruled on other grounds by Kransco v. American Empire Surplus Lines Ins.
Co. (2000) 23 Cal.4th 390, 403-406; see also Kittredge Sports, supra,
213 Cal.App.3d at p. 1048 [“[E]ven if the proposed legal theory is a novel one,
‘the preferable practice would be to permit the amendment and allow the parties
to test its legal sufficiency by demurrer, motion for judgment on the pleadings
or other appropriate proceedings’” (quoting California Casualty, supra,
at p. 280)].)
However,
leave to amend may also be properly denied when “the insufficiency of the
proposed amendment is established by controlling precedent and . . . [can]not
be cured by further appropriate amendment.” (California Casualty, supra,
173 Cal.App.3d at pp. 280-281; see, e.g., Foxborough v. Van Atta (1994)
26 Cal.App.4th 217, 231 [not an abuse of discretion to deny leave to amend when
“proposed amendment would have been futile because it was barred by the statute
of limitations” with no indication of relating back to the original
complaint].) 
Further,
if a good amendment is proposed in proper form, a long, unwarranted and
unexcused delay in presenting it may be a good reason for denial. (Roemer v.
Retail Credit Co. (1975) 44 Cal.App.3d 926, 939-940.) In most cases, the
factors for timeliness are: (1) lack of diligence in discovering the facts or
in offering the amendment after knowledge of them; and (2) the effect of the
delay on the adverse party. (Id. at p. 940.) If the party seeking the
amendment has been dilatory, and the delay has prejudiced the opposing party,
the judge has discretion to deny leave to amend. (Hirsa v. Superior Court
(1981) 118 Cal.App.3d 486, 490.) Prejudice exists where the amendment would
require delaying the trial, resulting in loss of critical evidence, or added
costs of preparation such as an increased burden of discovery. (Magpali v.
Farmers Group, Inc. (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 471, 486-488.)
Order
for Leave to Amend: GRANTED.
I. Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1324
Here,
the motion for leave to amend satisfies California Rules of Court, rule 3.1324,
subdivision (a)(1) by attaching a copy of the proposed FAC. (Mot., Brown Decl.,
Ex. 1.)
The
motion also satisfies California Rules of Court, rule 3.1324, subdivisions
(a)(2)-(3) by giving a detailed breakdown of the additions and/or deletions to
the pleadings. (Mot., pp. 4-8; Mot., Brown Decl. ¶ 9 at pp. 11-15.)
Last,
the motion satisfies California Rules of Court, rule 3.1324, subdivisions
(b)(1)-(4) by providing the information required by this rule. (Mot., Brown
Decl., ¶¶ 1-8.)
II. Other Arguments
In
opposition, J&S argues that this motion should be denied based on false
information (e.g., seeking to add a cause of action to the FAC for monies that
are not owed) and based on litigation missteps by CAB. The opposition also
makes certain objections to CAB’s motion and its evidence. (Opp’n, pp. 3-5.)
In
reply, CAB argues that liberal discretion in support of amendments should be
applied here, and that J&S has failed to raise any reasons why it would be
prejudiced by the filing of a FAC.
The
Court finds in favor of CAB.
Here,
J&S’s opposition does not show that, as a matter of law, the allegations in
the proposed FAC are fatally defective. Absent such a showing, “… ‘[t]he
preferable practice [is] to permit the amendment and allow the parties to test …
legal sufficiency by demurrer, motion for judgment on the pleadings or other
appropriate proceedings.’” (Kittredge Sports, supra, 213
Cal.App.3d at p. 1048, quoting California Casualty, supra, at p.
280.)
CAB’s
motion is therefore GRANTED.
For
these reasons, the Court need not rule on J&S’s objections.
 

Conclusion
Plaintiff Creditors Adjustment
Bureau, Inc.’s Motion for Order
Allowing Plaintiff to File First Amended Complaint is GRANTED.
Plaintiff Creditors Adjustment
Bureau, Inc. SHALL file its FAC with
the Clerk within three court days of this order.
