 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
Plaintiff Public
  Health and Safety Advocates, LLC’s Motion to Approve Proposition 65
  Settlement and Consent Judgment.



 
Background
Plaintiff Public Health and Safety Advocates, LLC sued Defendants Hong
Chang USA, Inc., Hong Chang Corporation, Hong Chang Corporation dba California
Food International, Hong Chang Corporation dba Galleria Foods Wholesale, and
Does 1 through 50 pursuant to an April 15, 2021 Complaint alleging 21 claims of
“Violation of Proposition 65, The Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act
of 1986 (Health & Safety Code §25249.5, et seq.).”
The claims arose from allegations
that Hong Chang, its owners, and their other companies produce and distribute
into the stream of commerce food products containing lead and cadmium in
violation of California’s Proposition 65. The Complaint seeks (1) penalties
under Health & Safety Code section 25247, subdivision (b) of $2,500 for
each of 21 causes of action in the Complaint, (2) an injunction requiring a
Prop. 65 warning on Defendants’ products, (3) attorneys’ fees and costs, and
(4) any other recovery the Court may so award.
On October 18, 2023, Plaintiff
filed a notice of settlement with the Court.
On October 19, 2023, the Court set
an Order to Show Cause Hearing re Dismissal (Settlement) for January 11, 2024.
The Court also advanced and vacated all previously scheduled hearings in Department
40.
On November 20, 2023, Plaintiff
dismissed Defendants Hong Chang
Corporation, Hong Chang Corporation dba California Food International, and Hong
Chang Corporation dba Galleria Foods Wholesale, leaving Hong Chang USA, Inc. as
the only Defendant in this action.
That same day, Plaintiff filed a motion to approve its proposition 65
settlement and consent judgment, which is premised on Health and Safety Code
section 25249.7, subdivision (f)(4) and Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6. The
motion attaches a declaration from counsel, which includes a copy of the
settlement, as well as copies of the testing for the products challenged in the
Complaint. The motion also attaches a proposed order and a proposed judgment.
Plaintiff’s motion is unopposed and now before the Court.
 
Motion to Approve Proposition 65 Settlement
Legal
Standard
The
Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986, colloquially known as
Proposition 65, was passed as a ballot initiative by the California voters, and
was designed to prevent the contamination of drinking water with, and generally
protect the public from unknowing exposure to, harmful chemicals. (See
generally 12 Witkin, Summary of California Law 10th (2005) Real Property, §
894, p. 1075.) Health & Safety Code section 25249.7 governs the enforcement
of Proposition 65. Proposition 65 has both public and private enforcement
mechanisms. (See Health & Safety Code, § 25249.7(c), (d).) Violations are
punishable by injunction (Health & Safety Code § 25249.7(a)) and civil
penalty (Health & Safety Code § 25249.7(b)). In the case of private
enforcement actions, parties may also recover attorney’s fees, pursuant to the
provisions in Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5, which governs actions
concerning important rights affecting the public interest. 
Health
& Safety Code section 25249.7, subdivision (f) governs the role of the
court in approving settlements and consent judgments for private actions to
enforce Proposition 65, and provides that:
“If
there is a settlement of an action brought by a person in the public interest
under subdivision (d), the plaintiff shall submit the settlement, other than a
voluntary dismissal in which no consideration is received from the defendant,
to the court for approval upon noticed motion, and the court may approve the
settlement only if the court makes all of the following findings:
(A)
The warning that is required by the settlement complies with this chapter.
(B)
The award of attorney’s fees is reasonable under California law.
(C)
The penalty amount is reasonable based on the criteria set forth in paragraph
(2) of subdivision (b).”
(Health
& Saf. Code, § 25249.7, subd. (f)(4)(A)-(C).)
“To
stamp a consent agreement with the judicial imprimatur, the court must
determine the proposed settlement is just …. In the context of Proposition 65
litigation, necessarily brought to vindicate the public interest, the trial
court also must ensure that its judgment serves the public interest.” (Consumer
Advocacy Group, Inc. v. Kintetsu Enterprises of America (2006) 141
Cal.App.4th 46, 61.)
Motion
to Approve Proposition 65 Settlement: GRANTED.
I.
Compliance
of Warning 
Health
& Safety Code section 25249.6 states, in relevant part: “No person in the
course of doing business shall knowingly and intentionally expose any
individual to a chemical known to the state to cause cancer or reproductive
toxicity without first giving clear and reasonable warning to such individual,
except as provided in Section 25249.10.” (Health & Saf. Code, § 25249.6.)
“Health and Safety Code section 25249.6 (the central warning provision)
requires that there be no ‘knowing and intentional’ exposure ‘without first
giving clear and reasonable warning.’” (Consumer Defense Group v. Rental
Housing Industry Members (2006) 137 Cal.App.4th 1185, 1214.) In order for a
warning to be clear and reasonable, the manner of transmission must be reasonable,
and the message employed must be sufficiently clear to communicate the warning.
(Environmental Law Foundation v. Wykle Research, Inc. (2005) 134
Cal.App.4th 60, 67, fn. 6.)
Here,
the settlement and the proposed judgment (which incorporates the settlement)
show an agreement to, within 90 days of the Court approving the proposed
judgment, affix a warning to the challenged products, and this warning complies
with the format for warnings allowed under California Code of Regulations,
title 27, section 25603. (Mot., Proposed Judgment, Ex. 1, § 2.4 at p. 5; see id.
at §§ 2.5-2.6 at pp. 5-6; see also 27 Cal. Code Regs., tit. 27, div. 4, ch. 1,
art. 6, sub-art. 2, § 25603, subd. (a)(2)(D).)
The
proposed consent judgment accordingly satisfies Health and Safety Code, section
25249.7, subdivision (f)(4)(A).
Moreover,
the Court notes that pursuant to 11 Cal. Code Regs. section 3201, subdivision
(b)(1), “a settlement that provides for the giving of a clear and reasonable
warning, where there had been no warning provided prior to the sixty-day
notice, for an exposure that appears to require a warning, is presumed to
confer a significant benefit on the public.”
Here,
the warnings effect such a public benefit.
II.
Reasonableness
of Attorney’s Fees
The
fees setting inquiry in California ordinarily begins with the “lodestar”
method, i.e., the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the
reasonable hourly rate. A computation of time spent on a case and the
reasonable value of that time is fundamental to a determination of an
appropriate attorneys’ fee award. The lodestar figure may then be adjusted,
based on consideration of factors specific to the case, in order to fix the fee
at the fair market value of the legal services provided. (Serrano v. Priest
(1977) 20 Cal.3d 25, 49.) Such an approach anchors the trial court’s analysis
to an objective determination of the value of the attorney’s services, ensuring
that the amount awarded is not arbitrary. (Id. at p. 48, fn. 23.)
Here,
the Court finds that the attorney’s fees sought are reasonable.
The
motion is accompanied by a declaration from counsel, which explains that the
parties negotiated a $37,000 award of fees and costs for Plaintiff under
circumstances where counsel allegedly accrued $45,419.59 in lodestar fees and
costs. (Mot., Kawahito Decl., ¶¶ 17, 27 [showing breakdown of alleged lodestar
fees].)
A
review of the Kawahito declaration also provides a background for Mr. Kawahito,
which shows that he has litigated numerous class action lawsuits and lawsuits
involving Proposition 65 warnings, and which details his other professional and
academic background. (Mot., Kawahito Decl., ¶¶ 18-25; see Mot., Kawahito Decl.,
¶ 26 [$800 per hour fee rate for Mr. Kawahito and $200 per hour fee rate for
paralegal Sebastian Burnside].)
In
light of this information, the Court determines that the $37,000 award for fees
and costs contemplated in the settlement and proposed judgment is reasonable.
(Mot., Proposed Judgment, Ex. 1, § 4 at pp. 7-8.)
The
proposed consent judgment accordingly satisfies Health and Safety Code, section
25249.7, subdivision (f)(4)(B).
III.
Reasonableness
of Civil Penalty
Health
& Safety Code section 25249.7, subdivision (b)(1) states, in relevant part:
“A person who has violated Section 25249.5 or 25249.6 is liable for a civil
penalty not to exceed two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500) per day for
each violation in addition to any other penalty established by law.” Section
25249.7, subdivision (b)(2) states: “In assessing the amount of a civil penalty
for a violation of this chapter, the court shall consider … (A) [t]he nature
and extent of the violation,” “(B) [t]he number of, and severity of, the
violations,” “(C) [t]he economic effect of the penalty on the violator,” “(D)
[w]hether the violator took good faith measures to comply with this chapter and
the time these measures were taken,” “(E) [t]he willfulness of the violator’s
misconduct,” “(F) [t]he deterrent effect that the imposition of the penalty
would have on both the violator and the regulated community as a whole,” and
“(G) [a]ny other factor that justice may require.”
Here,
the Court recognizes that penalties amounting to a total of $3,000 are somewhat
low, particularly given the noncompliance alleged in the Complaint. However,
the Court is satisfied with the analysis provided by Plaintiff for why five
different factors support this penalty, i.e., the economic effect on Hong Chang
USA, the good faith Hong Chang USA showed in attempting to rectify its
noncompliance, the lack of willfulness on Hong Chang USA’s part, the purported lack
of severity in noncompliance by Hong Chang USA, and the deterrence of the
penalty on Hong Chang USA and the regulated community. (Mot., pp. 5-6.)
The
proposed consent judgment accordingly satisfies Health and Safety Code, section
25249.7, subdivision (f)(4)(C).

Conclusion
Plaintiff Public Health and Safety Advocates, LLC’s Motion to Approve
Proposition 65 Settlement and Consent Judgment is GRANTED.
Proposed order and consent judgment are to be signed by the Court.
Per the terms of the settlement therein, the Court retains jurisdiction
to enforce the terms of the consent judgment. (Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6.)
