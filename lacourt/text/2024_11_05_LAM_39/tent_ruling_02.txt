[1]On
October 10, 2024, Respondent filed a document entitled “Request for Judicial
Notice” in which it referenced documents attached to a Declaration of Daniel M.
Hayes, which was filed separately and concurrently.  Respondent requests that this Court take
judicial notice of certain documents filed in this case, certain documents filed
in case No. 23STCV01162, and a September 12, 2024 letter.  Petitioners have not objected to the request.    Although
the Court will take judicial notice of those matters, the Court notes the Court
does not take judicial notice of any truth of statements purportedly made in
them.  (See e.g., Dominguez v. Bonta
(2022) 87 Cal.App.5th 389, 400 [judicial notice not taken of truth of averments
made in documents filed in medical malpractice case, including findings made by
trial court]; Barri v. Workers’ Compensation Appeals Board. (2018) 28
Cal.App.5th 428, 437-438 [court took judicial notice of existence but not truth
of factual finding by federal court]; Richtek USA v. uPI Semiconductor
(2015) 242 Cal.App.4th 651, 659 [court took judicial notice of complaint appended
to complaint in a related federal court case but could not use contents of
complaints to resolve factual dispute]; Plumley v. Mockett (2008) 164
Cal.App.4th 1031, 1050-1051 [judicial notice of a court’s findings in
underlying action was proper but not truth of those findings].)
