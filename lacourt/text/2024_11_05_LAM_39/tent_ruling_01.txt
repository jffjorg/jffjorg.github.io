Motion for Entry of Satisfaction of Judgment 




MOVING PARTY:


Respondent Kandela, LLC




OPPOSING PARTY:


Assignee Scottsdale Indemnity Company



 
MOTIONS
Petitioners Porch.com, Inc. and Matthew
Ehrlichman (“Petitioners”) participated in an arbitration of claims with
Respondent Kandela, LLC (“Respondent”).  In
its order of October 12, 2022, the Court confirmed the arbitration award and
entered judgment pursuant to its terms.  Now,
Respondent moves for an order for entry of satisfaction of judgment.  Assignee Scottsdale Indemnity Company
(“Judgment Creditor”) opposes the petition.
ANALYSIS
“A money judgment may
be satisfied by payment of the full amount required to satisfy the judgment or
by acceptance by the judgment creditor of a lesser sum in full satisfaction of
the judgment.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §
724.010, subd. (a).)  If the judgment
creditor fails to file an acknowledgement of satisfaction of the judgment upon
payment in full, the judgment debtor may file a written demand that the
judgment creditor file such acknowledgment with the Court.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 724.050, subd. (a).)  The demand obligates the judgment creditor to
file the acknowledgement within 15 days of receipt.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 724.050, subd. (c).)  If the judgment creditor fails to comply with
the demand, the judgment debtor may file a noticed motion for entry of
satisfaction of judgment.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 724.050, subd. (d).)  If the Court
determines the judgment is satisfied and the judgment creditor has not complied
with the demand, the Court may order the judgment creditor to file the
acknowledgment of satisfaction of judgment or direct the Court’s clerk to enter
satisfaction of the judgment.  (Ibid.)

On October 12,
2022, the Court ordered judgment entered for Petitioners in the amount of
$1,401,814, plus interest from July 25, 2022. 
(See October 12, 2022 Judgment Following Arbitration.)  In its order of November 16, 2023, the Court also
ordered Respondent to pay Petitioners’ attorney fees in the amount of $93,875.50.  (See November 16, 2023 Minute Order.)  Petitioners assigned the judgment and right
to attorney fees to the Judgment Creditor. 
(See April 29, 2024 Acknowledgement of Assignment of Judgment.)  On September 12, 2024, Respondent served a
demand on Judgment Creditor that Judgment Creditor file an acknowledgment of
satisfaction of judgment with the Court. 
(See Declaration of Daniel M. Hayes, Exhibit 9.)  Judgment Creditor has not complied with the
demand.  However, Respondent offers no
evidence it satisfied the judgment. 
Accordingly, the Court cannot determine the judgment is satisfied.  Instead, Respondent argues that a contractual
offset applies.
In the assignment
of their claims to Judgment Creditor, Petitioners acknowledged the Judgment
Creditor paid their defense costs in the underlying action. (See April 29, 2024
Acknowledgement of Satisfaction of Judgment, Assignment of Claims, ¶ E.)  Respondent argues this bars Petitioners claim
pursuant to the terms of the underlying agreement between the parties, the
March 22, 2019 Asset Purchase Agreement (APA). 
Pursuant to section 8.04, subdivision (f) of the APA, Petitioners and Respondent
agreed should the parties face certain claims, Petitioners would indemnify
Respondent and Respondent would indemnify Petitioners.  The parties also agreed, in such
circumstances, the amounts by which the parties would indemnify each other “will
be reduced by any amounts actually received under insurance policies . . .
.”  (Hayes Decl., Exhibit 1, Attachment
4(b).)  However, a duty to indemnify only
arises when the circumstances specified occur. 
(Rossmoor Sanitation, Inc. v. Pylon, Inc. (1975) 13 Cal.3d 622,
628.)  
Respondent fails
to explain how section 8.04, subdivision (f) is applicable to the judgment that
has been entered against it.  As Respondent
fails to show that provision is relevant to this dispute, Respondent has
likewise failed to show section 8.09, which makes subdivision 8.04 the
exclusive remedy for disputes that fall within its scope, applies.  Accordingly, the motion is denied.
In reply, among
other things, Respondent argues the Judgment Creditor has taken a contrary
position in Scottsdale Indemnity Company v. Kandela, LLC, et al. (Super. Ct. L.A. County, 2023, No. 23STCV01162)
(case No. 23STCV01162) and, therefore, is estopped from arguing the APA does
not apply.[1]  Respondent cannot raise this issue for the
first time in its reply brief, as Judgment Creditor has not had the opportunity
to respond.  “The general rule of motion
practice, which applies here, is that new evidence is not permitted with reply
papers.” (Jay v. Mahaffey (2013) 219 Cal.App.4th 1522, 5137.)  Therefore, Respondent’s second request for the
Court to take judicial notice, filed in support of its reply brief on October
29, 2024, is denied.  In any event,
Respondent’s argument is unsupported.  
The doctrine of judicial estoppel applies
when: “(1) the same party has taken two positions; (2) the positions were taken
in judicial or quasi-judicial administrative proceedings; (3) the party was
successful in asserting the first position (i.e., the tribunal adopted the
position or accepted it as true); (4) the two positions are totally
inconsistent; and (5) the first position was not taken as a result of
ignorance, fraud, or mistake.” (Jackson v. County of Los Angeles (1997)
60 Cal.App.4th 171, 183.)  Respondent fails
to show the Court in case No. 23STCV01162 accepted Judgment Creditor’s
position.
Respondent is
ordered to provide notice of this order and to file proof of service of same.
