And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in response to the defendants' motion for terminating sanctions. The defendants argue that the plaintiff, Nam Suk Park, has engaged in misconduct by directing a former employee, Kyu Chul Shin, to access Huge USA's computer system and violate the Comprehensive Computer Data Access and Fraud Act. The judge finds that this conduct is sanctionable, but concludes that dismissal is not necessary to vindicate the court's authority. Instead, the judge would impose a sanction to instruct the jury at trial that the plaintiff caused Shin to unlawfully access Huge USA's business records. The judge also declines to impose sanctions based on spoliation, as the defendants have not demonstrated that the plaintiff intentionally deleted messages to evade discovery. The judge orders the defendants to provide notice of this order and to file proof of service of same.
