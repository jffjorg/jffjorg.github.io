And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted the Defendant's motion to compel the Plaintiff to appear for deposition. The Plaintiff had objected to the deposition notice, citing the Defendant's alleged dilatory scheduling of the deposition. However, the Judge found that this was not a valid reason for the Plaintiff to avoid the deposition, and that the Plaintiff had failed to seek a protective order to avoid the deposition. The Judge also found that the Plaintiff's failure to comply with the deposition notice was an abuse of the discovery process and awarded sanctions against the Plaintiff and his counsel in the amount of $1,260. The Plaintiff is ordered to appear for deposition within 30 days, unless a stipulation is reached.
