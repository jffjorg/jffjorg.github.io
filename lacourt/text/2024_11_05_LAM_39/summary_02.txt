And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The respondent has requested that the court take judicial notice of certain documents and a letter. The petitioners have not objected to the request. The court will grant the request and take judicial notice of the documents, but will not consider the truth of the statements made in them. The court notes that this is in line with previous case law, which holds that judicial notice does not imply that the court finds the truth of the statements made in the documents.
