And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Respondent Kandela, LLC's motion for an order for entry of satisfaction of judgment. Respondent had argued that the judgment was satisfied due to a contractual offset, but the judge found that Respondent failed to show how this offset applies to the judgment that has been entered against it. The judge also denied Respondent's request for judicial notice, as Respondent raised this issue for the first time in its reply brief and Judgment Creditor had not had the opportunity to respond. Finally, the judge found that Respondent's argument that Judgment Creditor is estopped from arguing that the APA does not apply was unsupported, as Respondent failed to show that the Court in case No. 23STCV01162 accepted Judgment Creditor's position.
