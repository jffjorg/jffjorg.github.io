  Case Number:  21SMCV01794    Hearing Date:   November 3, 2023    Dept:  I The court is inclined to GRANT the motion to be
relieved.  However, counsel must inform
the clients that they are unrepresented and will be defaulted if they are
entities who continue without representation. 
To address plaintiff’s concern that this is a ploy for more time, the
court will set an OSC re: status of representation and consideration of
striking the answer of any unrepresented non-human entity.  The hearing will be approximately 30 days
from now.  If defendant entities (all of
them, not just those at issue in this motion) are not represented by counsel,
the court may strike the answer and enter default at that time.  The court also notes that it is unlikely to
continue the trial even if all defendants do appear at the OSC with counsel.
