And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on two ex parte applications brought by the plaintiffs. The first application is to file an over-length brief, which is denied as the defendants were able to file a 15-page brief with extrinsic evidence. The second application is to lift the discovery stay in whole or in part, which is also denied as the plaintiffs have not shown good cause to take discovery. The judge emphasizes that the burden is on the moving party to show "minimal merit" (triability of facts) and that the discovery stay is imposed automatically when the Special Motion to Strike (SMS) is filed. The judge notes that the SMS has two prongs: liability and probability of prevailing, and that the court will not turn the application into a mini-hearing on the merits of the SMS. The judge also states that the court will entertain discussion at the hearing on the possibility of limited discovery if the SMS is denied.
