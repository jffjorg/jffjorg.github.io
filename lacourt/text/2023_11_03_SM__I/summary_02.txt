The Judge has denied InterSolution's request for judicial notice and has also denied Ramirez's motion for a mandatory preliminary injunction. The Judge believes that the motion to change venue is frivolous and has denied it. Finally, the Judge has stricken an ex parte application that was filed by Ramirez.
