 Case Number:  22SMCV02059    Hearing Date:   November 3, 2023    Dept:  I The unopposed motion for a finding of good faith is
GRANTED.  However, the court notes that
there is a fraud claim and an elder abuse claim against defendants.  The court is unsure whether these causes of
action were factored into the settlement or how the settlement is apportioned
regarding these claims.  The court
assumes that the answer is that there is no such apportionment, but it does not
know that.
