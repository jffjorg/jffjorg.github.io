And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling is to grant the motion to be relieved, but with certain conditions. The court notes that unrepresented entities may be defaulted, and counsel must inform their clients of this risk. To address the plaintiff's concern that the motion is a ploy for more time, the court will set a hearing (OSC) to review the status of representation and consider striking the answer of unrepresented non-human entities. The hearing will be approximately 30 days from now. If the defendant entities are not represented by counsel at the hearing, the court may strike the answer and enter default. The court also notes that it is unlikely to continue the trial even if all defendants appear at the hearing with counsel.
