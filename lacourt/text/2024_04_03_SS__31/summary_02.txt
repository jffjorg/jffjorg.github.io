Here is the summary in English:

The judge's tentative ruling grants two motions filed by Pacific Mechanical Contractor (PMC): (1) to compel discovery responses and (2) to deem requests for admission admitted. The motions are unopposed.

PMC served discovery requests on November 15, 2022, and January 27, 2023. However, Plaintiff Eduardo Galeno failed to serve timely responses to the discovery requests and did not verify the responses. As a result, PMC seeks an order compelling Plaintiff to serve verified responses to the outstanding discovery and pay monetary sanctions.

The judge grants the motions and orders Plaintiff to serve verifications/verified responses to the discovery requests within 20 days. The judge also deems the requests for admission admitted and awards sanctions against Plaintiff and Plaintiff's attorney in the amount of $1,048.30.
