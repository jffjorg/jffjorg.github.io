Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case 21STCV36208, involving a demurrer to the complaint filed by Esperanza Asberry and others against Centinela Skilled Nursing & Wellness Centre and others. The demurrer was filed by the defendants, arguing that the complaint fails to state a cause of action for elder abuse and violation of Health & Safety Code §1430(b).

The judge has sustained the demurrer with 20 days leave to amend as to the 2nd and 3rd causes of action. The judge found that the allegations are insufficient that the complaint states a cause of action for elder abuse and violation of Health & Safety Code §1430(b). The judge also found that the allegations are insufficient that plaintiffs have standing to bring the action.

The judge's ruling is based on the allegations in the complaint, which state that the decedent was a resident at the facility and required close supervision, and that the defendants owned, controlled, operated, and maintained the facility. The judge found that the allegations are conclusory and lack specificity, and that the plaintiffs have not pleaded with particularity.

The judge's ruling gives the plaintiffs 20 days to amend their complaint to address the deficiencies identified by the judge.
