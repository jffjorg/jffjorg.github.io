And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the motion to disburse settlement proceeds, pay referee costs, and pay the referee's attorney's fees and costs. The court found that the defendant did not breach the settlement agreement and therefore did not award attorney's fees and costs to the plaintiff. The court also denied the plaintiff's request to charge the defendant solely for the referee's costs and fees and the referee's attorney's fees. The court noted that the referee was appropriate and proper in this case, and that the fees and costs should be split equally between the parties.
