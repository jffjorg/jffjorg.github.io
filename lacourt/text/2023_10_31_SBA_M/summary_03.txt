Summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge [Judge's Name] in a civil case, granting a motion to be relieved as counsel filed by plaintiff's attorney, Andrew Haling, Esq., of Wilshire Law Firm, PLC. The plaintiff, Michael Hollien, filed a complaint against Joy Faalata, Chris Bustillo, Ramsey Karame, and GRS Property Management for negligence, statutory liability, and strict liability. The complaint alleges that Hollien was attacked by a dog at or near a property in Lawndale, California. The attorney seeks to be relieved as counsel due to the client's other conduct making it unreasonably difficult for the attorney to carry out representation effectively. The court finds that the attorney has satisfied the requirements of California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1362, and has shown sufficient reasons why the motion should be granted. The motion is granted, and the attorney is relieved as counsel effective upon the filing of the proof of service of the signed "Order Granting Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel â€“ Civil" (Judicial Council form MC-053) upon the client.
