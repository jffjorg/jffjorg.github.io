Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on defendant Sandra Mariana Vidal's motion for summary adjudication of plaintiffs Sima Ashrafi and Mohammad Ali Nateghi's fifth cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress and seventh cause of action for assault. The court has denied defendant's motion for summary adjudication of the intentional infliction of emotional distress cause of action, finding that there are triable issues of fact regarding whether defendant's actions were intentional and outrageous, and whether plaintiffs' emotional distress was severe enough. On the other hand, the court has granted defendant's motion for summary adjudication of the assault cause of action, finding that there is no evidence to support plaintiffs' claims that defendant committed any acts intended to inflict or threatening to inflict immediate harmful contact.
