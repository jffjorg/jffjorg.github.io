Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, American Health Services, LLC, has moved for summary judgment or summary adjudication of the plaintiff, Eileen Garcia's, causes of action. The plaintiff alleges disability discrimination, wrongful termination, failure to reasonably accommodate her disability, failure to engage in the interactive process, and retaliation.

The Judge finds that the defendant has met its burden of showing that the plaintiff could not perform her essential job duties and that no reasonable accommodation was available. The Judge also finds that the defendant's denial of the plaintiff's request for a leave of absence was not unreasonable and that the plaintiff's termination was not discriminatory.

The Judge grants the defendant's motion for summary judgment and orders that a proposed judgment of dismissal be submitted forthwith.
