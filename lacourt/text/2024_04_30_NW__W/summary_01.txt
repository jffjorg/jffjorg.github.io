And here is the English-language summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The defendant, Susan Lopaty-Pechman, has moved the court for an order compelling the plaintiffs to provide initial discovery responses. The court grants the defendant's motion, ordering the plaintiffs to produce verified discovery responses without objection within 10 days. Additionally, the court grants the defendant's request for monetary sanctions against the plaintiffs in the amount of $1,055.00. The court finds that the plaintiffs' failure to respond to discovery requests warrants this sanction.
