DISCUSSION
 
Defendant
Susan Lopaty-Pechman moves the court for an order compelling Plaintiffs Edna
Fuentes, Elizabeth Monroy, a minor, by her guardian ad litem Edna Fuentes, Nathaly
Monroy, a minor, by her guardian ad litem Edna Fuentes[1],
Sebastian Monroy, a minor, by his guardian ad litem Edna Fuentes, and Sofia
Monroy, a minor, by her guardian ad litem Edna Fuentes, to provide initial
responses to discovery. Defendant also seeks an order that said Plaintiffs
and/or Plaintiffs' attorney of record, Erick B. Novik, Esq., pay monetary
sanctions and attorney's fees to said moving party within fifteen (15) days in
the sum of $760.00 for the reasonable expenses and attorney's fees per motion. 
 
Where a party fails to serve timely responses to discovery requests,
the court may make an order compelling responses. (CCP §§ 2030.290, 2031.300,
2033.280; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.) A party that fails to
serve a timely response to the discovery request waives any objection to the
request, including one based on privilege or the protection of attorney work
product. (CCP §§2030.290(a), 2031.300(a), 2033.280(a); Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc., supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at 404.) Pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.010, the propounding party may also
move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any
matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary
sanction. (CCP § 2033.280(b).)
 
On November 20, 2023, Defendant propounded their first set of Special
Interrogatories, Form Interrogatories, and Demand for Production of Documents
onto Plaintiffs. (Norling Decl. ¶2, Exh. A.) On January 19, 2024, Defense
counsel reached out to Plaintiff’s notifying them responses were outstanding
and overdue. (Norling Decl. ¶3, Exh. B.) This letter provided an extension
within ten (10) days from the date of that letter and warned that failure to
provide responses to the requested discovery would result in a motion to compel
and a request for sanctions. (Norling Decl. ¶3.) As of the date of the filing
of this motion, no responses to the discovery has been received. (Norling Decl.
¶4.) 
 
As such, Defendant’s unopposed
motion to compel Plaintiffs’ discovery responses to Defendant’s Special
Interrogatories, Set One, Form Interrogatories, Set One, Requests for
Production (Set one) and  is GRANTED.
Plaintiffs are ordered to produce verified discovery responses without
objection in ten days.
 
Sanctions
 
Defendant requests monetary sanctions against Plaintiffs in the amount of $760.00 against Plaintiffs
and/or Plaintiffs’ counsel per motion or $2,280.00 total. 
 
If a propounding party moves for and
obtains a court order compelling a response, the court shall impose monetary
sanctions against the party failing to timely respond to interrogatories and
demands for inspection unless that party acted with substantial justification
or the sanction would otherwise be unjust. (CCP §§ 2030.290(c), 2031.300(c),
2033.280(c); Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc., supra, 148
Cal.App.4th at 404.) 
 
Defense counsel contends they spent two
hours preparing each motion and anticipate two hours travel time and for
appearing for each motion at counsel’s hourly rate of $175.00 (Norling Decl.
¶5.) Counsel also seeks $60.00 for filing fees per motion. (Norling Decl. ¶5.) 
 
Defendant’s request for monetary sanctions is GRANTED, in the reduced
amount of $1,055.00, total. The court finds only one hour necessary for
attending the hearing on the three motions. Attorney fees are payable within 30
days.
