And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge grants Defendant David Bagdasarian's motion to quash service of summons and complaint. The Judge finds that Plaintiff Buchanan failed to prove that she served Defendant with the summons and complaint, as required by law. Specifically, the Judge notes that the process server's declaration states that she served the summons and complaint on an individual who identified themselves as the resident of the Hoyt St. property, but Defendant disputes that he or any member of his family has ever resided at that property. The Judge also notes that the lease agreement attached to Defendant's motion states that the address of the owner's representative "for notice purposes" is the Hoyt St. property, but Plaintiff fails to oppose the motion or otherwise challenge Defendant's declaration. As a result, the Judge concludes that the Court lacks jurisdiction over the case and grants Defendant's motion to quash service of summons and complaint.
