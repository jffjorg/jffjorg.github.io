ANALYSIS
 
Judicial Notice
Defendant asks the Court to take judicial notice of
Plaintiff’s Proof of Substituted Service, filed July 29, 2024. (RJN, at p. 2.)
The Court grants Defendant’s request.
 
Quash Service of Summons and Complaint
A defendant may file and serve a notice of motion to quash
service of summons on grounds that the court lacks jurisdiction, e.g., because
service was improper. (Code Civ. Proc., § 418.10, subd. (a); see, e.g., Tresway
Aero, Inc. v. Superior Court (1971) 5 Cal.3d 431, 433 [defendant filed
motion to quash on ground that service on corporation was defective because it
did not comply with Code Civ. Proc., § 410, now § 412.30]; County of
Riverside v. Superior Court (1997) 54 Cal.App.4th 443, 446 [defendant filed
motion to quash on ground that service was defective because summons did not
specify date for answering and appearing].)¿The defendant must attach evidence such
as affidavits and declarations to support its motion. (See Aquila, Inc. v.
Superior Court (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 556, 563.) 
 
“On a motion to
quash service of summons, the plaintiff bears the burden of proving by a
preponderance of the evidence that all jurisdictional criteria are met.
[Citations] The burden must be met by competent evidence in affidavits and
authenticated documents; an unverified complaint may not be considered as
supplying the necessary facts.” (Nobel Floral, Inc. v. Pasero (2003) 106
Cal.App.4th 654, 657-658.) 
 
“A summons may be served by personal delivery of a
copy of the summons and of the complaint to the person to be served. Service of
a summons in this manner is deemed complete at the time of such delivery.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 415.10.) To serve a summons and complaint by substitute
service, the plaintiff must (1) leave a copy of the summons and complaint “at
the person’s dwelling house, usual place of abode, usual place of business, or
usual mailing address”; (2) with “a competent member of the household or a
person apparently in charge of the [person’s] office, place of business, or
usual mailing address” who is at least “18 years of age”; and (3) mail a copy
of the summons and complaint to the person to be served at the place where a
copy of the summons and complaint were left. (Code Civ. Proc., § 415.20, subd.
(b).)
 
A dwelling house or abode means a place one holds out as
their principal residence. (Rovinski v. Rowe (6th Cir. 1942) 131 F.2d
687, 689 [noting appellant “paid for and had listed a telephone in his own name
at that home; that he kept some clothing and odds and ends there; that there
was always a bedroom ready for his occupancy when he returned home and that he
invariably occupied it; and that he was unmarried and maintained no other
household of his own. He conceded that he never voted elsewhere than in the
State of Michigan”].)
 
Summary
of Arguments
Defendant
argues the Court should quash the summons in this matter because Plaintiff
never served him. Defendant states that on July 5, 2024, Plaintiff served the
summons at property located at 12112 Hoyt St., Sylmar, CA 91342 (Hoyt St.) via
substituted service. (Declaration of David Bagdasarian [Bagdasarian Decl.], ¶
2.) Defendant asserts neither he nor any member of his family has ever resided on
this property. (Bagdasarian Decl., ¶¶ 2-3.) Defendant owns and leases the Hoyt
St. property to tenants. (Bagdasarian Decl., ¶ 2, Exh. 1, at p. 1.) Defendant
has never authorized his tenants to accept any mail on his behalf at the Hoyt
St. property. (Id. at p. 5.) Defendant does not receive mail at the Hoyt
St. property. (Bagdasarian Decl., ¶ 7.) Defendant was never personally served
with the summons and complaint. (Ibid.) No member of Defendant’s
household was ever served by substituted service with a summon and complaint at
the Hoyt St. property. (Ibid.) Defendant asserts Plaintiff’s proof of
service erroneously states she served a “co-resident,” who was a competent
member of Defendant’s household. 
 
In
Trackman v. Kenney, the Court of Appeal found that service was proper where
a process server’s declaration stated she attempted to personally serve the defendant
at the defendant’s property on three separate dates without success. (Trackman
v. Kenney (2010) 187 Cal.App.4th 175, 185.) The Court held the process
servers three attempts satisfied the service requirements because the process
server eventually served the papers with an apparent co-resident—an individual who
apparently lived at the address—and the process server served the documents at
the publicly listed home and business address of the defendant. (Ibid.)
 
Here,
the process server went to the Hoyt St. property on July 3, 4, and 5, 2024.
(RJN, at p. 4.) On the 3rd and the 4th, she was unable to access the address
because of a private fence. (Ibid.) On the 5th, the server encountered
“an Individual who identified themselves as the resident” and stated that
Defendant resides at the Hoyt St. property. (Ibid.) The process server
served the summons and complaint on this individual and mailed a copy of the
summons and complaint to the Hoyt St. property. (Id. at p. 2.) 
 
The
Court notes that the lease agreement attached to Defendant’s motion states that
the address of owner’s representative “for notice purposes” is 12112 Hoyt St.,
Sylmar, CA 91342. (Bagdasarian Decl., Exh. A, at p. 10.) However, Plaintiff
fails to oppose the motion or otherwise challenge Defendant’s declaration.
 
Accordingly,
the Court grants Defendant’s motion to quash service of summons.
 
Conclusion 
The motion is granted.
 
Moving
party to give notice.
