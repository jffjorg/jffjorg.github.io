And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the defendant's ex parte application to set aside the default judgment and stay the writ of execution. The defendant, Green Solar Enterprises, LLC, had argued that it did not have actual notice of the case and that its failure to pay the outstanding balance was excusable neglect. The judge found that the defendant had actual notice of the case through its authorized agent for service of process and that it had failed to show good cause for not filing its application sooner. The judge also found that the defendant had failed to establish the existence of any irreparable harm, immediate danger, or any other statutory basis for granting ex parte relief. As a result, the judge denied the defendant's motion to set aside the default judgment and stay the writ of execution.
