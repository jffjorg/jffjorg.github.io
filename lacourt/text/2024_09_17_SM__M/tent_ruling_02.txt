Legal
Standard
 
Code of Civil Procedure (“CCP”) section
425.16 permits the Court to strike causes of action arising from an act in
furtherance of the defendant's right of free speech or petition, unless the
plaintiff establishes that there is a probability that the plaintiff will
prevail on the claim. “The anti-SLAPP procedures are designed to shield a
defendant’s constitutionally protected conduct from the undue burden of
frivolous litigation.” (Baral v. Schnitt (2016) 1 Cal.5th 376, 393.)
“The anti-SLAPP statute does not insulate defendants from any liability
for claims arising from the protected rights of petition or speech. It only
provides a procedure for weeding out, at an early stage, meritless
claims arising from protected activity.” (Id. at 384.) 
 
“Resolution of an anti-SLAPP motion
involves two steps. First, the defendant must establish that the challenged
claim arises from activity protected by section 425.16. If the defendant makes
the required showing, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to demonstrate the
merit of the claim by establishing a probability of success.” (Baral, supra,
1 Cal.5th at 384, citation omitted.) The California Supreme Court has
“described this second step as a ‘summary-judgment-like procedure.’ The court
does not weigh evidence or resolve conflicting factual claims. Its inquiry is
limited to whether the plaintiff has stated a legally sufficient claim and made
a prima facie factual showing sufficient to sustain a favorable judgment. It
accepts the plaintiff’s evidence as true, and evaluates the defendant’s showing
only to determine if it defeats the plaintiff’s claim as a matter of law.
‘[C]laims with the requisite minimal merit may proceed.’” (Id. at
384-385 [citations omitted].) 
 
A moving party must move to strike
under this section within 60 days of service of the complaint. (CCP
§425.16(f).)
 
ANALYSIS
 
Defendant 1238 10th Street LLC moves
to strike the following allegations pertinent to Plaintiff Shawn Ryan’s seventh
cause of action for Tenant Harassment:
 
• Paragraph 84, lines 14 through
15: “taking action to terminate a tenancy upon a legal theory which is
untenable under the facts known to landlord”; and
• Paragraph 85, lines 20 through
21: “brought an action to terminate a tenancy upon a legal theory which is
untenable under the facts known to landlord”.
 
Generally, bringing an action for
unlawful detainer, and all acts necessary to prosecute such an action, would be
protected under the anti-SLAPP provisions. (See Feldman v. 1100 Park Lane
Assocs. (2008) 160 Cal.App.4th 1467, 1480 [finding that an unlawful
detainer action, service of notice to quit and threats to evict tenants
constitute protected activities].) CCP section 425.16(e) defines protected
acts as the following: 1) any written or oral statement or writing made before
a legislative, executive, or judicial proceeding, or any other official
proceeding authorized by law and 2) any written or oral statement or writing
made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a legislative,
executive, or judicial body, or any other official proceeding authorized by law,
among other things. Thus, all petition-related activities before the
government, even if it does not involve a public issue, constitute protected
activities under section 425.16. All that matters is that the First Amendment
activity takes place in an official proceeding or be made in connection with an
issue being reviewed by an official proceeding. (Briggs v. Eden Council for
Hope & Opportunity (1999) 19 Cal.4th 1106, 1116.)
Litigation-related activities, such as the filing of a lawsuit or unlawful
detainer action, reflect the exercise of a person‘s constitutionally guaranteed
right to petition the government for grievances. (Navellier v. Sletten
(2002) 29 Cal.4th 84, 90.)
 
The above-cited cases expressly
refer to “taking action” or bringing “an action” to terminate a tenancy, i.e.,
an unlawful detainer action under CCP section 1161 et seq. Liability for Plaintiff’s
wrongful eviction claim is therefore premised, in part, on Defendant’s
litigation conduct. Defendant therefore meets its burden to show that
challenged allegations arise from, in part, protected conduct. Plaintiff does
not oppose the motion, and therefore fails to meet his second prong burden.
 
The “prevailing defendant” on the
motion to strike “shall be entitled” to recover the defendant's attorney fees
and costs. (CCP § 425.16(c).) Defendant requests $8,850.00 in sanctions, which
reflects approximately 16 hours of attorney-time, and does not count any time anticipated
for a reply. (See Supp. French Decl., ¶¶ 4-6.) Counsel presents verified
billing records showing that counsel, Mr. French, spent 15.3 hours working on
the moving papers at $540.00 per hour, and Mr. Odson spent 0.7 hours
reviewing/revising the moving papers at $895.00 per hour. The Court finds the
counsel’s rates and time spent to be reasonable. Accordingly, the request for sanctions
is GRANTED. Sanctions are imposed against Plaintiff Shawn Ryan and his counsel
of record, jointly and severally, in the amount of $8,850.00.
