And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the Defendant's motion to strike portions of the complaint filed by the Plaintiff, Toulon Gardens Homeowners Association. The Defendant, Robert Ames, had argued that the damages requests were premised on provisions of the HOA bylaws, but the Judge found that the damages were not entirely based on bylaws, but also on the Defendant's maintenance of a nuisance. The Judge noted that the Plaintiff had alleged that the Defendant had caused a nuisance by refusing to allow access to Unit 102, changing the locks, and refusing to provide the key, which had resulted in a loss of hot water to other units and property damage of at least $35,000. The Judge also found that the Plaintiff had sufficiently alleged that the Defendant's actions were intentional, deliberate, and willful, and therefore, the claim for punitive damages was supported by the pleadings.
