And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in response to a special motion to strike filed by Defendant 1238 10th St. LLC. The motion seeks to strike allegations pertinent to Plaintiff Shawn Ryan's seventh cause of action for Tenant Harassment. The judge finds that the challenged claims arise from activity protected by section 425.16 of the California Code of Civil Procedure, which permits the court to strike causes of action arising from an act in furtherance of the defendant's right of free speech or petition. The judge also finds that the Defendant has met its burden to show that the challenged allegations arise from, in part, protected conduct. Therefore, the judge grants the motion to strike and orders the Plaintiff to pay the Defendant's attorney fees and costs in the amount of $8,850.00.
