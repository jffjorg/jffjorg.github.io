  Case Number:  21STCV15670    Hearing Date:   April 8, 2024    Dept:  55 Motions in Limine- tentative rulings
Plaintiff’s Motion in Limine No. 1 is denied.
Plaintiff’s Motion in Limine No. 2 to Exclude Expert Testimony
of Joel Scheer, PT, DPT, OCS, is moot because counsel for Defendant confirmed
at the 3/29/2024 FSC that Defendant will not be calling Joel Scheer to testify
at trial.
Defendant’s Motion in Limine No. 1 and Motion in Limine No.
3 both seek to exclude testimony from the State Farm Person Most Knowledgeable.
The Court will hold a 402 hearing with the State Farm PMK, outside the presence
of the jury, before determining the admissibility of the witness’s testimony. 
Defendant’s Motion in Limine No. 2 is denied. 
 
With respect to all motions in limine above that have been
denied, the moving party may renew the objection to the introduction of this
evidence at trial, and the Court will rule on the evidentiary objection anew in
the context of the other evidence that is presented at trial.
