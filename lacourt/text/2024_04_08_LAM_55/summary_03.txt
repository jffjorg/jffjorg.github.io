Here is the English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge is considering a motion by Hassan Kayal, a cross-defendant/cross-complainant, to continue the trial and related motion and discovery dates. Kayal argues that good cause exists for the continuance due to the substitution of new counsel and the addition of new parties. The Judge agrees that these circumstances constitute good cause for a trial continuance, as the new parties must have the opportunity to conduct discovery and the parties already in the case should have the opportunity to seek discovery from the new parties. The Judge also considers other factors, including the proximity of the trial date, whether there was any previous continuance, and whether the interests of justice are best served by a continuance. The Judge concludes that severance will not promote the interests of justice, and instead, the interests of justice militate in favor of continuing the trial. As a result, the motion is granted, and the trial date is advanced and continued to a date to be determined at the hearing in consultation with counsel.
