And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the motion filed by F.E. DISTRIBUTION, INC. (Plaintiff) against CONSTRUCTION SERVICING CENTER, INC. and ZEPYOR PARSEGHIAN (Defendants) and has issued a tentative ruling. The motion requests that the court deem admitted certain requests for admission made by the defendants and impose monetary sanctions of $1,426.00 on the defendants and their attorney.

The judge has found that the defendants have failed to respond to the requests for admission and has determined that this failure warrants the deeming of the requests admitted. The judge has also found that the defendants and their attorney are statutorily mandated to pay sanctions for their failure to serve timely responses.

As the motion was unopposed, the judge has granted the motion and will issue an order deeming the requests for admission admitted and imposing the monetary sanctions.
