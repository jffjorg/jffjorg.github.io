And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding several motions in limine filed by the plaintiff and defendant. The plaintiff's motion to exclude expert testimony from Joel Scheer is moot because the defendant has confirmed it will not call him to testify at trial. The defendant's motions to exclude testimony from the State Farm Person Most Knowledgeable are denied, but the court will hold a 402 hearing outside the presence of the jury to determine the admissibility of the witness's testimony. The plaintiff's motions in limine that are denied can be renewed at trial, and the court will rule on the evidentiary objections anew in the context of the other evidence presented at trial.
