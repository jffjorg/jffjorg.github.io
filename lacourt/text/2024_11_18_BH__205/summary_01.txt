And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge, Moreton, has issued a tentative ruling in the case of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. v. Max D. Edlin. The case involves a collections dispute over a credit card account that Defendant Edlin failed to pay. Plaintiff JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. filed a complaint alleging a cause of action for common counts, including an open book account for money due, account stated, money lent, and money paid. The complaint seeks $53,797.85 in damages. The Plaintiff waived prejudgment interest.

The Plaintiff filed a proof of service showing that Defendant Edlin was substitute served on March 17, 2024. However, the proof of service is defective because it lacks a declaration of service by mail from the CMRA owner or operator, as required by law.

The Judge has denied the Plaintiff's request for default judgment because the Plaintiff has not complied with the requirements for a default judgment, as outlined in Code Civ. Proc. § 585 and CRC Rule 3.1800. The Judge has ordered that the case proceed to a regular trial, rather than a default judgment.
