  CASE NO.: 22STCV13446
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO ENFORCE
  SETTLEMENT
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
November 7, 2024



 
On October 13, 2022, Plaintiff Soad Shashoua and Defendant
Lost Spirits Distillery, Inc. (the successor by statutory conversion to Lost Spirits
Distillery, LLC) filed a stipulation to dismiss this action pursuant to a settlement,
with the Court retaining jurisdiction under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6
for enforcement of the settlement.
On September 10, 2024, Plaintiff filed
a motion to enforce the settlement.

Courts
may enter judgments pursuant to written settlements signed by the parties.  (Elyaoudayan v. Hoffman (2003) 104 Cal.App.4th
1421, 1428; Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6.)  Strict
compliance with the statutory requirements is necessary before a court can enforce
a settlement agreement.  (Sully-Miller
Contracting Co. v. Gledson/Cashman Construction, Inc. (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th
30, 37.)  The party seeking to enforce a settlement
“must first establish the agreement at issue was set forth ‘in a writing signed
by the parties’ (§ 664.6) or was made orally before the court.  [Citation.]” 
(Harris v. Rudin, Richman & Appel (1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 299, 304.)
The
Settlement Agreement required Defendant to pay a total of $290,000 to Plaintiff
according to a specified schedule.  (Hurey
Decl. ¶ 3 & Ex. 1.)  Defendant made settlement
payments up to and including the payment that was due on June 31, 2024, but it did
not make the payment that was due on July 31, 2024.  (Hurey Decl. ¶¶ 4-5.)  On August 1, 2024, Defendant’s President stated
that Defendant would not be making any further payments.  (Hurey Decl. ¶ 6.)  On August 12, 2024, Plaintiff sent a letter to
Defendant, informing it that entire unpaid balance of the principal sum under the
terms of the Settlement Agreement was immediately due and payable, in accordance
with Section 4.e of the Settlement Agreement. 
(Hurey Decl. ¶ 9.)  Plaintiff seeks
entry of judgment in the amount of $138,854.11 (the unpaid balance), plus ten-percent
interest since August 8, 2024, pursuant to the terms of the settlement.  (See Hurey Decl. ¶ 10.)  Plaintiff also requests attorney fees of $2,755.00
for enforcing the settlement agreement, pursuant to the terms of the settlement.  (Hurey Decl. ¶ 14.)
The
unopposed motion to enforce settlement is GRANTED.  Plaintiff is ordered to submit a proposed judgment
within five days.
A
Non-Appearance Case Review Re: Submission of Proposed Judgment is scheduled for
November 15, 2024 at 9:00 a.m.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
