And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has taken the hearing on the motion to compel arbitration off calendar and stayed the entire action pending settlement approval. The parties had attempted to file a joint stipulation and proposed order to stay proceedings, but it was rejected due to incorrect case title and case number. As a result, the hearing on motion to compel arbitration and dismiss the case is no longer scheduled. The Order to Show Cause Re: Dismissal (Settlement) Pursuant to PAGA is continued, and the action will remain stayed until settlement approval is granted.
