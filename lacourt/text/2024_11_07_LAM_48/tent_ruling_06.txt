Bella Ava Jones Fernandez filed two motions to compel further responses from Defendant

Statement.
The
Hearings on Motions to Compel Interrogatories (Set One) and Requests for Production
of Documents are CONTINUED to ____________________.
The
parties are ORDERED to meet and confer and file an Amended Joint Statement no later
than 10 days before the hearing.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
