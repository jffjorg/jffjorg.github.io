And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to file a first amended complaint under seal. The plaintiff sought to seal certain records, including Exhibit A to the declaration of Ara Krikorian, paragraphs 7, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 27, 28, and 29 of the proposed first amended complaint, and all papers and records related to the motion. The plaintiff argued that the records were covered by a contractual confidentiality provision and that disclosure of the records could subject the plaintiff to a breach of contract action. However, the judge found that the plaintiff's interest did not overcome the right of public access to the record and that sealing was not the least restrictive means to protect the plaintiff's interest. The judge also found that the proposed redactions appeared irrelevant to the confidentiality provision but were very relevant to the litigation, and that the information was necessary to understand the plaintiff's allegations and claims for damages.
