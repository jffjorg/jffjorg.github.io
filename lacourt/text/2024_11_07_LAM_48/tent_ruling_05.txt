  CASE NO.: 22STCV21710
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER TAKING MOTION TO COMPEL
  ARBITRATION OFF CALENDAR; STAYING ACTION 
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
November 7, 2024



 
On December 14, 2022, Defendants
Oceanside Laundry LLC and Emerald Los Angeles LLC field a motion to compel arbitration
of Plaintiff Johnny Rivas’s claims.
On
October 23, 2024, the parties attempted to file a joint stipulation and proposed
order to stay proceedings pending settlement approval of a related matter.  However, the filing was rejected because it contained
the wrong case title and case number.  As
of the date of the Court’s tentative ruling, the parties have not filed a corrected
stipulation.
On
the Court’s own motion, the Hearing on Motion to Compel Arbitration and Dismiss
the Case is taken off calendar.
The
Order to Show Cause Re: Dismissal (Settlement) Pursuant to PAGA is CONTINUED to
____________________.  The entire action is
stayed until this date.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
