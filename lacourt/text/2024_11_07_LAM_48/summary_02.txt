Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court denies Defendant's motion for summary adjudication of the fourth cause of action for Fraudulent Inducement - Concealment and the related prayer for punitive damages. The Court finds that Defendant has not met its burden of showing that Plaintiffs cannot support their claims, and that the economic loss rule does not apply to bar Plaintiffs' claim for punitive damages. The Court also finds that the expert declaration of James Bielenda is insufficient to establish the lack of a defect known to Defendant and that the motion for summary adjudication is denied.
