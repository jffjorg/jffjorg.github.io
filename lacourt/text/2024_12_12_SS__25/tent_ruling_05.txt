ANALYSIS:
 
I.                   
Background

 
On March 25, 2024, Arbitrator David
Schlueter (the “Arbitrator”) rendered an award requiring Respondents David Ffrench
and Dave’s Works Corporation dba West Shore Construction (“Respondents”) to pay
$25,000 to Petitioner Seth Trejo (“Petitioner”) and Shima Trejo.  
 
On June 25, 2024, Petitioner filed the
instant Petition to Confirm Attorney-Client Fee Arbitration Award (the
“Petition”). No Opposition was filed.
 
On October 10, 2024, the Court filed a
Notice of Rejection of Electronic Filing as to Petitioner’s Civil Case Cover
Sheet based on the rejection of Petitioner’s application and order to serve the
Petition by publication. (10/20/24 Notice of Rejection.) Petitioner’s
applications for publication were rejected because Petitioner failed to provide
facts and evidence to substantiate the need to serve by publication as required
by Code of Civil Procedure sections 415.20, 415.30, and 415.50. (10/10/24
Notice of Rejection.) 
 
On October 29, 2024, the Court held a
hearing on the Petition. While the Court found the Petition satisfied the filing
requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 1285.4, the Court found several
deficiencies with the Motion under Code of Civil Procedure sections 1290.4, 1283.6,
1288, and 1288.4. (10/29/24 Order, pp. 3-5.) Accordingly, the Court continued
the hearing to allow Petitioner to file and serve supplemental papers
addressing the errors noted therein. (10/29/24 Order, p. 5.) 
 
Petitioner has not filed any
additional or supplemental papers since the Court’s ruling on October 29, 2024.
Petitioner is afforded one last chance to file and serve supplemental papers
addressing the errors noted herein. 
 
II.                
Legal
Standard 
 
“Regardless of the particular relief
granted, any arbitrator’s award is enforceable only when confirmed as a
judgment of the superior court.”  (O’Hare v. Municipal Resource
Consultants¿(2003) 107 Cal.App.4th 267, 278.)  “Once a petition to
confirm an award is filed, the superior court must select one of only four
courses of action: it may confirm the award, correct and confirm it, vacate it,
or dismiss the petition.”  (EHM Productions, Inc. v. Starline Tours of
Hollywood, Inc.¿(2018) 21 Cal.App.5th 1058, 1063.) “It is well settled
that the scope of judicial review of arbitration awards is extremely narrow.” 
(California Faculty Assn. v. Superior Court¿(1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 935,
943.)  
 
“Neither the trial court, nor the
appellate court, may ‘review the merits of the dispute, the sufficiency of the
evidence, or the arbitrator’s reasoning, nor may we correct or review an award
because of an arbitrator’s legal or factual error, even if it appears on the
award’s face.”  (EHM Productions, supra, 21 Cal.App.5th at pp.
1063-64.) 
 
III.             
Discussion

 
A. Filing Requirements (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1285.4) 
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 1285.4
states: 
 
“A petition under this chapter
shall: 
 
(a)   Set forth the substance of or have
attached a copy of the agreement to arbitrate unless the petitioner denies the
existence of such an agreement. 
(b)   Set forth the names of the
arbitrators. 
(c) Set forth or have attached a copy
of the award and the written opinion of the arbitrators, if any.” 
 
            Here, Petitioner
states that the parties entered into a written agreement to arbitrate on or
about July 31, 2020. (Pet., ¶ 4, Exh. 4(b).) The dispute subject to arbitration
is regarding an agreement whereby Petitioner contracted with Respondents to
build a home in Torrance, CA (the “Torrance Home”). (Pet., ¶ 5.) However,
Respondents breached the agreement when they “failed to pay money when due for
materials and services to subcontractors, failed to finish the project in a
timely manner, and willfully departed from accepted trade standards for good
workmanship.” (Pet., ¶ 5.) 
 
The arbitration agreement states that
any disputes related to the parties’ contractual agreement for building the
Torrance home shall be settled by arbitration conducted by the Contractors
State Licensing Board (“CSLB”). (Pet., ¶ 4, Exh. 4(b) ¶ 21.) The Petition also
sets forth the name of the Arbitrator and attaches a copy of the final
arbitration award. (Pet., ¶¶ 6, 8; Attachment 8(c).) 
 
            Thus,
Petitioner has satisfied the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section
1285.4.
 
B. Service of the Petition, and
Notice of Hearing (Code Civ. Proc., § 1290.4.)  
¿ 
Code of Civil Procedure section 1290.4
states, in pertinent part:  
 
(a)   “A copy of the petition and a written
notice of the time and place of the hearing thereof and any other papers upon
which the petition is based shall be served in the manner provided in the
arbitration agreement for the service of such petition and notice. 
(b)   If the arbitration agreement does not
provide the manner in which such service shall be made and the person upon whom
service is to be made has not previously appeared in the proceeding and has not
previously been served in accordance with this subdivision: ¶ (1) Service
within this State shall be made in the manner provided by law for the service
of summons in an action.” 
 
Here, the written arbitration
agreement does not provide for the manner of service for the petition to
confirm the arbitration award, and Respondents have not previously appeared in
the proceeding. Accordingly, Petitioner was mandated to serve the Petition on
Respondents in the same manner as service of process. Service of a summons may
be accomplished by personal service, by substitute service, by mail with
acknowledgment of receipt, or by publication. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 415.10, et
seq.) 
 
On September 30, 2024, Petitioner
filed two Applications for service of summons by publication as to each
Respondent. However, on October 10, 2024, the Clerk rejected both applications
because Petitioner failed to submit facts demonstrating Petitioner’s attempt to
satisfy the diligence requirements for service by publication. (Code Civ. Proc.
§§ 415.20, 415.30, 415.50; 10/10/24 Notice of Rejection.) The Clerk’s
determination was that Petitioner failed to submit facts demonstrating his
investigation (i.e., prior attempts to serve, checking Respondents’ addresses,
calling Respondents’ listed phone numbers), or demonstrating that Petitioner
checked public records databases, property records, or change of address
information for Respondents. Petitioner also failed to file a declaration
attesting to mailing a copy of the Summons and Petition to Respondents’ last
known address. 
 
Since the Clerk rejected Petitioner’s
applications and the Court issued its October 29, 2024 ruling, Petitioner has
not filed any other documents, or any amended proof of service. Thus, the
service requirements of Section 1290.4 have still not been satisfied. 
 
Additionally, the Court notes
Petitioner also did not file proof of service as to Shima Trejo, whose name is
listed on the arbitration award but was crossed off the Petition as a named
Petitioner. (Pet., ¶ 1.)
 
Thus, the service requirements of Code
of Civil Procedure section 1290.4 have still not been satisfied. 
 
C. Service of the Arbitration Award
& Timeliness of Petition (CCP §§ 1283.6, 1288, 1288.4) 
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 1283.6
provides that: “The neutral arbitrator shall serve a signed copy of the
award on each party to the arbitration personally or by registered or certified
mail or as provided in the agreement.”¿ 
 
“A petition to confirm an award shall
be served and filed not later than four years after the date of service of a
signed copy of the award on the petitioner. A petition to vacate an award or to
correct an award shall be served and filed not later than 100 days after the
date of the service of a signed copy of the award on the petitioner.” (Code of
Civ. Proc., § 1288.) 
 
“No petition [to confirm arbitration
award] may be served and filed … until at least 10 days after service of the
signed copy of the award upon the petitioner.” (Code of Civ. Proc., § 1288.4.) 
 
“[B]efore a court can enter an
arbitrator’s award as its judgment, the parties must have the notice of the
award. … ‘[T]he superior court is without jurisdiction to act further in the
matter until the parties are served or otherwise obtain actual notice of the award.’
” (Domingo v. Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transp. Auth. (1999) 74
Cal.App.4th 550, 554.) 
 
Here, Petitioner states that the
arbitration award indicates that the award was served on Petitioner on March
25, 2024. (Pet., ¶ 9.) However, the Court notes that the arbitration award does
not include a proof of service or any other indication demonstrating the
neutral arbitrator properly served a copy of the award on the parties. (Code of
Civ. Proc., § 1283.6.) 
 
In addition, a party may seek a court
judgment confirming an arbitration award by serving and filing a petition no
more than four years, but not less than 10 days, after the award was
served.  (Code of Civ. Proc., §§ 1288,
1288.4.) Here, the Court is unable to address whether the Petition comports
with Code of Civil Procedure sections 1288 and 1288.4 as the date of service of
the award, if it occurred, is unknown. 
 
Thus, the Court finds the requirements
of Code of Civil Procedure sections 1283.6, 1288, 1288.4 are still not
satisfied.
