ANALYSIS:
 
I.                   
Background
 
On November 8,
2022, Plaintiff Kevin Vasquez (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant action against
Defendant Judy Acio (“Defendant”) and Does 1 through 50, alleging a single
cause of action for Negligence. (Compl., p. 1.) 
 
On May 21, 2024,
Defendant filed an Answer.
 
On October 3,
2024, Plaintiff’s Counsel, Paris Page of Page & Nguyen APC (“Counsel”)
filed the instant Motion to be Relieved as Counsel (“the Motion”). No
Opposition has been filed.
 
On October 4,
2024, the Court filed a Notice of Rejection of Electronic Filing (the “Notice”)
as to the Proposed Order for the Motion, noting several deficiencies – namely,
the Proposed Order “must be completely filled-out. i.e.: Client's name, #6,
Client's last known or current address, tel. Number, e-mail, etc., #7, 8 and 9
must state the pending hearing dates. Please perfect, serve and resubmit along
with POS.” (10/4/24 Notice.)
 
II.                
Legal
Standard
 
            Code
of Civil Procedure section 284 states that “the attorney in an action…may be
changed at any time before or after judgment or final determination, as
follows: (1) Upon the consent of both client and attorney…; (2) Upon the order
of the court, upon the application of either client or attorney, after notice
from one to the other.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 284; Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362.)
“The determination whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel
lies within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi & Levine
v. Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1133); see Lempert v.
Superior Court (2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 1161, 1173.) 
 
An application
to be relieved as counsel must be made on Judicial Counsel Forms MC-051 (Notice
of Motion and Motion), MC-052 (Declaration), and MC-053 (Proposed Order). (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, subds. (a), (c), (e).) 
 
In addition,
California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362 subsection (d) requires that the notice
of motion and motion, declaration, and proposed order be served on the client
and all other parties who have appeared in the case by personal service,
electronic service, or mail. If the notice is served by electronic service, it
must be accompanied by a declaration stating that the electronic service
address is the client’s current electronic service address. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362, subd. (d)(2).) As used in this rule, “current” means: 
 
“[T]he address
was confirmed within 30 days before the filing of the motion to be relieved. 
Merely
demonstrating that the notice was sent to the client’s last known address and
was not returned or no electronic delivery failure message was received is not,
by itself, sufficient to demonstrate that the address is current.” 
 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362, subd. (d).) 
 
III.             
Discussion
 
On October 3,
2024, Counsel moved the Court to
relieve Counsel as attorney of record for Defendant. (MC-051.) Counsel filed MC-051,
MC-052, and MC-053 Forms for the Motion. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362, subds. (a), (c), (e).) Counsel seeks to be relieved because Counsel has lost contact
with Plaintiff, and Plaintiff has been unresponsive. (MC-052, ¶ 2.) 
 
The Court finds that Counsel has
demonstrated a reasonable basis for withdrawal. (Cal. Rules of Professional
Conduct, rule 1.16, subd. (b)(4).) 
 
However, the Court finds various
deficiencies in Counsel’s Motion. 
 
First, Counsel’s Form MC-053 contains
multiple errors as described by the Court’s Notice on October 4, 2024. (10/4/24
Notice.) Counsel has yet to perfect, resubmit, and serve Form MC-053 as
previously directed by the Court.
 
Next, Form MC-052 has an error as to ¶
4, subdivisions (b) and (c), as subdivision (b) does not list the instant
hearing as the next hearing date, and subdivision (c) fails to describe the
subject matter of the hearing. (MC-052, ¶ 4.) Further, Form MC-052, ¶ 6,
subdivision (b) lists the wrong trial date, and ¶ 8 is blank. (MC-052, ¶¶ 6, 8.)

 
Finally, Counsel filed proof of
service of the “Notice of motion and motion to be relieved as counsel and
declaration” on Plaintiff by first class mail on October 3, 2024. (10/3/24
Proof of Service.) However, there is no proof of service as to Defendant or of
the Proposed Order to any party. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362,
subd. (d).)  
 
Although the Court is satisfied with
Counsel’s reasons for seeking to be relieved, the Court cannot grant the Motion
without adequate forms and proper proof of service. 
 
IV.

Motion to be Relieved as Counsel for Plaintiff is CONTINUED to January 27, 2025
