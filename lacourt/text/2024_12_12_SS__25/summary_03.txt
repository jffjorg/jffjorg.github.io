And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is regarding the Motion to be Relieved as Counsel filed by Sergio F. Benedetto, Counsel for Plaintiffs Jose Armenta and Ignacio Valencia Lopez. The Motion was filed on September 12, 2024, and seeks to relieve Counsel as attorney of record for the Plaintiffs due to lack of interest, communication, and cooperation from the Plaintiffs. The Court is satisfied with Counsel's reasons for seeking to be relieved, but finds various deficiencies in the Motion, including the failure to file Judicial Counsel Forms MC-051, MC-052, and MC-053, and the lack of proof of service as to the Plaintiffs. The Court is continuing the hearing to February 3, 2025, at 10:00 a.m. in Department 25 at the Spring Street Courthouse, and Counsel is ordered to file and serve supplemental papers correcting the errors noted herein. Failure to do so may result in the Motions being placed off calendar or denied.
