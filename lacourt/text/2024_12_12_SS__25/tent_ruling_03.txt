ANALYSIS:
 
I.                   
Background
 
On May 1, 2023, Plaintiffs Jose
Armenta (“Armenta”) and Ignacio Valencia Lopez (“Lopez”) (“Plaintiffs”) filed
an action against Defendant Madeline Frances Benvenuti (“Defendant”) and Does
1-25 alleging causes of action for Motor Vehicle and General Negligence.  (Compl., pp. 4-5.) 
 
On August 21, 2023, Defendant filed
an Answer.
 

On September 12, 2024, Counsel for Plaintiffs,
Sergio F. Benedetto (“Counsel”) of the Law Offices of Sergio F. Benedetto,
filed Motions to be Relieved as Counsel (the “Motions”) as to each Plaintiff.  No Opposition was filed.
 
On October 29, 2024, the Court
continued the hearing on the Motions from November 4, 2024, to December 12,
2024 due to the Court’s unavailability and calendar congestion.
 
II.                
Legal
Standard
 
            Code of
Civil Procedure section 284 states that “the attorney in an action…may be
changed at any time before or after judgment or final determination, as
follows: (1) Upon the consent of both client and attorney…; (2) Upon the order
of the court, upon the application of either client or attorney, after notice
from one to the other.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 284; Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362.) 
“The determination whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as
counsel lies within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi
& Levine v. Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1133); see Lempert v.
Superior Court (2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 1161, 1173.) 
 
An application to be relieved as
counsel must be made on Judicial Counsel Forms MC-051 (Notice of Motion and
Motion), MC-052 (Declaration), and MC-053 (Proposed Order). (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362, subds. (a), (c), (e).) 
 
In addition, California Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362 subsection (d) requires that the notice of motion and
motion, declaration, and proposed order be served on the client and all other
parties who have appeared in the case by personal service, electronic service,
or mail. If the notice is served by electronic service, it must be accompanied
by a declaration stating that the electronic service address is the client’s
current electronic service address. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, subd.
(d)(2).) As used in this rule, “current” means: 
 
“[T]he address was confirmed within
30 days before the filing of the motion to be relieved. 
Merely demonstrating that the notice
was sent to the client’s last known address and was not returned or no
electronic delivery failure message was received is not, by itself, sufficient
to demonstrate that the address is current.” 
 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, subd. (d).) 
 
III.             
Discussion
 
A.   
Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel for Plaintiff Jose
Armenta
 
On September 12,
2024, Counsel moved the Court to
relieve him as attorney of record for Plaintiff Jose Armenta. (Armenta MC-051.) Counsel seeks to
be relieved due to “lack of interest, communication, and cooperation from Jose
Armenta.” (Armenta - Benedetto Decl., ¶ 3.) Counsel further states that “several
attempts were made to contact the client by telephone and left messages without
any success.” (Armenta - Benedetto Decl., ¶ 4.) 

 
The Court is satisfied with Counsel’s
reasons for seeking to be relieved. (Cal. Rules of Professional Conduct, rule
1.16, subd. (b)(4).)
 
However, the Court finds various
deficiencies in Counsel’s Motion. 
 
First, Counsel filed a declaration in
support of the Motion but did not file Judicial Counsel Form MC-052, as
required by California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362, subd. (c).) 
 
Next, the Proposed Order on Form
MC-053 has an error as to ¶ 7, which does not list the instant hearing as the
next hearing date. (Armenta MC-053, ¶ 7.)
 
Finally, Counsel presents three proofs
of service indicating all documents were served on Defendant’s counsel by
electronic service on September 12, 2024. (Armenta Mot., Proof of Service;
Armenta Order, Proof of Service; Armenta Benedetto Decl., Proof of Service.)
However, there is no proof of service as to Plaintiffs. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362, subd. (d).) 
 
Although the Court is satisfied with Counsel’s
reasons for seeking to be relieved, the Court cannot grant the Motion without adequate
forms and proper notice to all parties. 
 
B.    
Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel for Plaintiff
Ignacio Valencia Lopez
 
On September 12, 2024, Counsel moved the Court to relieve him
as attorney of record for Plaintiff Ignacio Velencia Lopez. (Lopez
MC-051.) Counsel seeks to be relieved due to “lack of interest, communication
and cooperation from Ignacio Valencia Lopez.”  (Lopez - Benedetto Decl., ¶ 3.) Counsel further states that “[s]everal attempts
were made to contact the client by telephone without any success. Plaintiff’s
phone number was disconnected.” (Lopez - Benedetto Decl., ¶ 4.) 
 
The Court is satisfied with Counsel’s
reasons for seeking to be relieved. (Cal. Rules of Professional Conduct, rule
1.16, subd. (b)(4).)
 
 
However, the Court finds various
deficiencies in Counsel’s Motion. 
 
First, Counsel filed a declaration in
support of the Motion but did not file Judicial Counsel Form MC-052, as
required by California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362, subd. (c).)
 
Next, the Proposed Order on Form
MC-053 has an error as to ¶ 7, which does not list the instant hearing as the
next hearing date. (Lopez MC-053, ¶ 7.)
 
Finally, Counsel presents three proofs
of service indicating all documents were served on Defendant’s counsel by
electronic service on September 12, 2024. (Lopez Mot., Proof of Service; Lopez
Order, Proof of Service; Lopez Benedetto Decl., Proof of Service.) However,
there is no proof of service as to Plaintiffs. (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1362, subd. (d).) 
 
Although the Court is satisfied with
Counsel’s reasons for seeking to be relieved, the Court cannot grant the Motion
without adequate forms and proper notice to all parties.
