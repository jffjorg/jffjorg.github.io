And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge issues a tentative ruling on a motion to be relieved as counsel for the plaintiff, Kevin Vasquez. The motion was filed by Counsel Paris Page of Page & Nguyen APC on October 3, 2024. The judge finds that Counsel has demonstrated a reasonable basis for withdrawal, but notes that the motion contains various deficiencies. Specifically, the proposed order filed by Counsel contains multiple errors, and there is no proof of service of the motion and declaration on the defendant or the proposed order to any party. The judge orders the motion to be continued to January 27, 2025, at 10:00 a.m. in Department 25 at the Spring Street Courthouse. The judge also requires Counsel to file and serve proper proof of service and supplemental papers correcting the errors noted herein, and warns that failure to do so may result in the motion being placed off calendar or denied.
