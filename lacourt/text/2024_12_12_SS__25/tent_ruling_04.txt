ANALYSIS:
 
I.                   
Background

 
On October 23, 2023, Jeco Residential,
LP dba 30Sixty Apartments (“Plaintiff”) initiated this action against Rako
Bunton (“Defendant”) and Does 1-10, alleging an Unlawful Detainer cause of
action. This action arises out of a written lease agreement for the leased
premises located at 3060 W. Olympic Blvd., #434, Los Angeles, CA 90006. (Compl.,
¶¶
1-5.) The Complaint requests damages in the amount of $3,349.37 plus $68.33 per
day from November 1, 2023 until the entry of judgment; reasonable attorney’s
fees not less than $750.00; and costs of suit incurred not less than $295.00.
(Compl., Prayer.)
 
On November 14, 2023, Defendant filed
an Answer.
 
On November 28, 2023, Defendant filed
an Amended Answer.
 
On October 21, 2024, Plaintiff filed
the instant Motion for Leave to File First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) (the
“Motion”). Plaintiff seeks this order on the grounds that Defendant voluntarily
vacated the subject premises on February 20, 2024 that was the subject of the
Unlawful Detainer cause of action and, due to Defendant’s vacating of the
premises, Plaintiff now seeks to amend the Complaint to plead a cause of action
for Breach of Contract instead of Unlawful Detainer and update the damages
request for unpaid rent beyond the twelve-months’ window, in the amount of
$53,434.88. (Compl., pp. 3-4.) 
 
On October 24, 2024, the case was
called for Jury Trial in Department 66 at the Stanley Mosk Courthouse.
(10/24/24 Order.) The parties represented possession was no longer at issue.
Thus, the case was referred to Department 1 for review and reassignment.
(10/24/24 Order.)
 
On October 29, 2024, the case was
reassigned for all purposes to Department 25 at the Spring Street Courthouse.
(10/29/24 Order.) On the Court’s own motion, the hearing on the Motion was
continued from November 25, 2024 to December 12, 2024. (10/29/24 Order.) The
Court also scheduled a trial setting conference for December 12, 2024 as well.
(10/29/24 Order.)
 
To date, no Opposition to the Motion
has been filed.
 
II.                
Procedural
Issues
 
The Court notes the Notice of Motion
incorrectly states that the Motion would be heard at “111 North Hill Street,
Los Angeles, California 90012.” (Notice of Motion.) This is the address for the
Stanley Mosk Courthouse, not the Spring Street Courthouse in which this
Department is located.
 
However, the Notice of Ruling served
on Defendant on November 1, 2024, contains the correct address and department
for the instant hearing. 
 
Thus, the Court finds Plaintiff
provided proper notice of the hearing.
 
III.             
Legal
Standard
 
            Leave
to amend is permitted under Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision
(a), which states: “The court may, in furtherance of justice, and on any terms
as may be proper, allow a party to amend any pleading or proceeding by adding
or striking out the name of any party, or by correcting a mistake in the name
of a party, or a mistake in any other respect; and may, upon like terms,
enlarge the time for answer or demurrer. The court may likewise, in its
discretion, after notice to the adverse party, allow, upon any terms as may be
just, an amendment to any pleading or proceeding in other particulars; and may
upon like terms allow an answer to be made after the time limited by this
code.”
 
“Although courts are bound
to apply a policy of great liberality in permitting amendments to the complaint
at any stage of the proceedings, up to and including trial [citations], this
policy should be applied only ‘where no prejudice is shown to the adverse party
. . .. [citation].  A different result is
indicated ‘where inexcusable delay and probable prejudice to the opposing
party’ is shown. [Citation].” (Magpali v.
Farmers Group (1996) 48
Cal.App.4th 471, 487.) 
 
            A
motion for leave to amend a pleading must also comply with the procedural
requirements of California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1324, which requires that a motion to amend
must:  “[i]nclude a copy of the proposed…
amended pleading… [and] state what allegations in the previous pleading are
proposed to be [deleted and/or added], if any, and where, by page, paragraph,
and line number, the [deleted and/or additional] allegations are located.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1321(a).) 
 
A motion for leave to
amend a pleading must also include “[a] separate declaration must accompany the
motion and must specify: (1) The effect of the amendment; (2) Why the amendment
is necessary and proper; (3) When the facts giving rise to the amended allegations
were discovered; and (4) The reasons why the request for amendment was not made
earlier.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1321(b).)
 
Absent certain exceptions,
Civil Code section 1952.3 provides: 
 
“[I]f the lessor brings an unlawful
detainer proceeding and possession of the property is no longer in issue
because possession of the property has been delivered to the lessor before
trial or, if there is no trial, before judgment is entered, the case becomes an
ordinary civil action in which:
 
(1)   The lessor may obtain any relief to
which he is entitled, including, where applicable, relief authorized by Section
1951.2; but, if the lessor seeks to recover damages described in paragraph (3)
of subdivision (a) of Section 1951.2 or any other damages not recoverable in
the unlawful detainer proceeding, the lessor shall first amend the complaint
pursuant to Section 472 or 473 of the Code of Civil Procedure so that
possession of the property is no longer in issue and to state a claim for such
damages and shall serve a copy of the amended complaint on the defendant in the
same manner as a copy of a summons and original complaint is served.”
 
(Civ. Code, § 1952.3; see also Nork
v. Pacific Coast Medical Enterprises, Inc. (1977) 73 Cal.App.3d 410.) 
 
 
 
            Civil
Code section 1951.2 states, in pertinent part: 
 
“Except as otherwise provided in
Section 1951.4, if a lessee of real property breaches the lease and abandons
the property before the end of the term or if his right to possession is
terminated by the lessor because of a breach of the lease, the lease terminates.
Upon such termination, the lessor may recover from the lessee:
 
(1) The worth at the
time of award of the unpaid rent which had been earned at the time of 
termination; 
(2) The worth at the
time of award of the amount by which the unpaid rent which 
would have been earned after
termination until the time of award exceeds the amount of such rental loss that
the lessee proves could have been reasonably avoided; 
(3) Subject to subdivision (c),
the worth at the time of award of the amount by which the unpaid rent for the
balance of the term after the time of award exceeds the amount of such rental
loss that the lessee proves could be reasonably avoided; and 
(4) Any other amount necessary to
compensate the lessor for all the detriment proximately caused by the lessee’s
failure to perform his obligations under the lease or which in the ordinary
course of things would be likely to result therefrom.”
 
(Civ. Code, § 1951.2.) 
 
IV.             
Discussion

 
Plaintiff seeks leave of court to file a FAC that would change the cause
of action from Unlawful Detainer to Breach of Contract and adjust the amount of
damages from $3,349.27 to $53,434.88 to account for unpaid rent beyond the
initial twelve-months’ window. (Motion, pp. 3-4.) 
 
Plaintiff’s Motion complies with California Rules of Court, rule
3.1324(a). The Motion includes a copy of the proposed FAC and sets forth the
allegations to be added and/or deleted. (Motion, pp. 3-4, Exh. A.) Further,
Plaintiff’s proposed amendments to the Complaint comport with Civil Code
sections 1952.3 and 1951.2, as Plaintiff is the lessor of the property subject
to this dispute; Plaintiff originally brought an Unlawful Detainer action
regarding possession of the subject property; possession of the subject property
has been delivered to Plaintiff; and Plaintiff now attempts to raise an
ordinary civil action for breach of contract to recover damages arising out of
the subject lease. (Motion, pp. 3-4; Motion, Cha Decl., ¶¶ 2, 3.) 
 
Additionally, the Motion includes a separate declaration from attorney Jason
Cha as is required California Rules of Court, rule 3.1321(b). The declaration
states that Plaintiff filed an Unlawful Detainer case against Defendant in
October 23, 2023, and Plaintiff’s Building Management received possession of
the subject premises back from Defendant on February 20, 2024. (Motion, Cha
Decl., ¶¶ 2-3.) While the declaration does not state the effect of the
amendment or specifically why the amendment is necessary and proper, the Court
finds Plaintiff has substantially complied with the requirements set forth in
California Rules of Court, rule 3.1324(b). 
 
For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff’s Motion is GRANTED. Plaintiff is
to file the First Amended Complaint within 10 days of this order.

Residential, LP’s unopposed Motion for Leave to File First Amended
