And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has tentatively ruled on the demurrer filed by Moving Defendants. The Court found that the demurrer is overruled as to Plaintiffs' first, fourth, and fifth causes of action, and sustained against Plaintiffs' second cause of action with 30 days leave to amend. The demurrer is sustained as to Plaintiff's third cause of action without leave to amend.

The Court found that Plaintiffs' allegations of fraud and misrepresentation in their first cause of action are sufficient to state a cause of action. The Court also found that Plaintiffs' allegations of quiet title and cancellation of written instrument in their fourth and fifth causes of action, respectively, are sufficient to state a cause of action.

However, the Court found that Plaintiffs' allegations of fraudulent concealment in their second cause of action are insufficient to state a cause of action, as they do not allege that Moving Defendants had a duty to disclose the fact to the plaintiff. The Court also found that Plaintiffs' allegations of conversion in their third cause of action are insufficient to state a cause of action, as they do not apply to real property.

The Court grants Plaintiffs 30 days leave to amend their complaint to cure the defects set forth above.
