ANALYSIS
 
1.     
Right to Recovery
 
An award of
attorney fees is proper when authorized by contract, statute, or law. (Code
Civ. Proc. §§ 1032, subd. (b); 1033.5, subd. (a)(10).) Here, the Song-Beverly Act
authorizes a buyer “to recover as part of the judgment a sum equal to the
aggregate amount of costs and expenses, including attorney’s fees based on
actual time expended, determined by the court to have been reasonably incurred
by the buyer in connection with the commencement and prosecution of such
action.” (Civ. Code § 1794, subd. (d).)
 
Moreover,
Plaintiff bases the instant motion on the parties’ 9/14/23 settlement agreement,
wherein Defendants agreed that “Plaintiff shall retain the right to petition
the Court for an award of reasonably and actually incurred attorney fees and
costs against Ford recoverable pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure
Section 1794(d).” (Ex. 3 to Castro Decl., ¶ 2(b).)
 
Based on
the foregoing, the Court finds that the instant motion is authorized both by
contract and statute.
 
2.     
Attorney Fees Incurred
 
A buyer prevailing
under the Song-Beverly Act may recover “reasonable” attorney fees and costs as
determined by the Court. (Civ. Code § 1794, subd. (d).) “The burden is on the
party seeking attorney fees to prove that the fees it seeks are reasonable.” (Gonzalez
v. Santa Clara County Dept. of Social Services (2017) 9 Cal.App.5th 162,
169.) In determining a reasonable fee award, the Court begins with the lodestar
method of calculation, i.e., the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied
by the reasonable hourly rate.¿(Karton v. Ari Design & Construction,
Inc. (2021) 61 Cal.App.5th 734, 744; PLCM Group, Inc. v. Drexler
(2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095–1096.) 
 
Here, Plaintiff
seeks to recover $23,395.00 in attorney fees, encompassing 55.5 hours of his
attorneys’ time, billed at the following rates:

a.       Counsel’s
Hourly Rate
 
When
determining a reasonable hourly rate, courts consider whether the stated rates
“are within the range of reasonable rates charged by and judicially awarded
[to] comparable attorneys for comparable work.” (Children's Hosp. & Med.
Ctr. v. Bonta (2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 740, 783.)
 
Here,
Plaintiff asserts that the rates charged by his attorneys are commensurate with
the experience and skill of the attorneys involved and have been approved by
courts in the past. (Pls.’ Mot. 8:11–9:8; Decl. of Payam Shahian ¶¶ 43–60.) In
opposition, Defendants present a number of cases where the court elected to
reduce hourly billing rates of plaintiff’s counsel in similar cases. (Defs.’
Opp. 6:27–9:12.) Defendants assert that Plaintiff’s attorneys’ hourly rates
should be reduced to an attorney rate of $275.00 and $350.00 per hour and legal
assistant rate at $150.00 per hour. (Id. at 9:3–12.)
 
Based on
the foregoing, the Court finds that Plaintiff has sufficiently shown that his
attorneys’ hourly billing rates are commensurate with their experience and fall
within the range of reasonable rates charged by attorneys and judicially
awarded in similar cases. Accordingly, the Court declines to reduce Plaintiff’s
counsel’s hourly billing rate.
 
b.      Hours
Expended
 
Plaintiff
seeks to recover attorney fees for the 55.5 hours expended by his attorneys on
this matter, totaling $23,395.00. Plaintiff proffers an itemized list of time
entries detailing his attorneys’ work on this matter. (Ex. 18 to Shahian Decl.)
 
In addition
to the attorney hourly billing rate, Defendants challenge the following
specific entries in Plaintiff’s attorneys’ proffered time log: (1) time spent
on discovery; (2) post-998 settlement time incurred; (3) time incurred in
connection with the instant fee motion; (4) improperly blockbilled time
entries; and (5) time spent on clerical tasks.
 
i.                   
Discovery
 
Defendants argue
that the attorney fees incurred by Plaintiff in drafting discovery responses to
Defendants, and Plaintiff’s motion to compel Defendants’ further responses to Plaintiff’s
Requests for Production, Set One should be reduced they are essentially the
same as other motions and responses served by Plaintiff’s counsel in similar
matters. (Defs.’ Opp. 9:20–10:11.) Plaintiff’s billing statement reflects that 23.5
hours (13.5 hours by AR, 2.3 hours by JL, and 7.7 hours by VD) were incurred in
these tasks. (Ex. 18 to Shahian Decl.) The Court reduces the hours incurred for
these tasks by 11.75 hours (6.75 hours by AR, 1.15 hours by JL, and 3.85 hours
by VD), for a total reduction of $4,490.50.
 
 
ii.                 
Post-998 Settlement
 
Defendants
further contend that Plaintiff’s two time entries, billed on 11/13/23 and
1/30/24, after the execution of the parties’ settlement agreement, must be
stricken. The Court notes that Defendants do not cite to any legal authority
supporting their position that these time entries are not recoverable.
Accordingly, the Court declines to strike these fees.
 
iii.               
Fee Motion
 
Defendants
further argue that the 7.2 hours incurred in bringing the instant motion, and
the anticipated $3,500.00 Plaintiff’s counsel expects to incur in reviewing
Defendants’ opposition, drafting a reply, and preparing for and attending the
instant hearing are unreasonable. (Defs.’ Opp. 10:12–11:5.) In reply, Plaintiff’s
counsel declares that he actually spent “spent 7.8 hours drafting the instant
Reply brief, this declaration, Objections to Evidence, and Reply Chart,” in
excess of the anticipated $3,500.00 sought for these tasks. (Suppl. Castro
Decl. ¶ 6.)
 
Based on
the foregoing, the Court declines to reduce the time incurred for these tasks.
 
iv.               
Blockbilling
 
Defendants
further argue that Plaintiff’s “counsels’ 3.60 block-billed hours cannot be
separated. As such, it is impossible to evaluate the reasonableness or
necessity of each task, or the time spent on each.” (Defs.’ Opp. 11:19–21.) The
Court agrees that several of the entries constitute impermissible
block-billing, and reduces those entries by 20 percent, for a total reduction
of $393.90.
 
v.                  
Clerical Tasks
 
Defendants
argue that throughout the billing records, there are entries for clerical tasks
that are considered overhead. Defendants challenge a total of 2.10 hours of Plaintiff’s
attorney’s time spent on various tasks, including client communications,
drafting process papers, receipt of filing confirmations, and court filings. (Id.
at 6:7–7:4.)
 
The Court
finds that Plaintiff’s billing statement reflects 0.7 hours (0.7 hours by NS)
incurred for purely administrative tasks. (Ex. 18 to Shahian Decl.) The Court
finds that the above fees were not reasonably incurred, and therefore reduces
the fee demand for these associated tasks by 0.7 hours for a total reduction of
$297.50.
 
3.     
Multiplier
 
“Once the
lodestar has been calculated, the second step is to apply any positive or
negative multipliers. The purpose of such adjustment is to fix a fee at the
fair market value for the particular action. In effect, the court determines,
retrospectively, whether the litigation involved a contingent risk or required
extraordinary legal skill justifying augmentation of the unadorned lodestar in
order to approximate the fair market rate for such services.” (Santana v.
FCA US, LLC (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th 334, 351 [internal quotations omitted].)
“Perhaps the most common multiplier applied, at least where a plaintiff
prevails, is a modifier for the contingent nature of the representation.” (Ibid.)
Whether a multiplier is applied to adjust the lodestar amount based on the
contingent nature and risk associated with the action and other factors, such
as degree of skill required and ultimate success achieved is within the
discretion of the trial court. 
 
Here,
Plaintiff argues that he is entitled to recover a 1.35 multiplier enhancement
because his attorneys obtained a favorable outcome, counsel works on a
contingency basis, and Defendant has delayed in payment of settlement monies. (Pls.’
Mot. 12:1–13:11.) Defendants argue in opposition that “here, this case lasted a
little over eight months, and had very minimal motion practice. There was
nothing novel or complex about this case, it involved no special skill or
ability, and it did not result in an extraordinary award.” (Defs.’ Opp.
14:5–7.) Moreover, Defendants observe that “the Act contains a provision to
recover attorneys’ fees, thus reducing the chance that Plaintiff’s counsel
would not recover for its work.” (Id. at 13:13–14.)
 
Based on
the foregoing, the Court finds that a multiplier enhancement is not warranted
in this case. While Plaintiff ultimately prevailed, the action appears to have
been a relatively straightforward Song-Beverly case. As such, the Court finds
the lodestar fee award sufficient to compensate Plaintiff’s counsel. 
 
4.     
Costs Incurred
 
Plaintiff asserts
that he incurred costs and expenses totaling $1,310.23. As Defendants observe,
Plaintiff failed to file a memorandum of costs summarizing the costs incurred
in this action. Nevertheless, Plaintiff has provided an itemized list of his
costs, attached to the instant motion, and stating that the cost total
encompasses: (1) $794.23 in electronic filing fees; (2) $156.00 in process
server fees; (3) $330.00 in mediation fees; and (4) $30.00 in electronic
service fees. (Ex. 18 to Shahian Decl., p. 2.) As such, the Court declines to
reduce the cost award.
 
Based on
the foregoing, the Court finds it reasonable to award Plaintiff $19,523.33 in
attorney fees and costs, as outlined below:
