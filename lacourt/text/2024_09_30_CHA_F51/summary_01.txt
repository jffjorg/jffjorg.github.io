Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted the motion for attorney fees and costs in part, awarding Plaintiff $19,523.33 in attorney fees and costs. The motion was filed by Plaintiff Ignacio Suarez against Defendant Ford Motor Company and Autonation Ford Valencia, seeking to recover attorney fees and costs incurred in the action. The parties had previously executed a settlement agreement, wherein Defendants agreed to pay $135,750.00 in settlement.

The Judge found that the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act authorized the award of attorney fees and costs, and that Plaintiff's attorneys had incurred reasonable and actual costs and expenses. The Judge also found that the hourly billing rates of Plaintiff's attorneys were commensurate with their experience and fell within the range of reasonable rates charged by attorneys in similar cases.

However, the Judge reduced the hours incurred for certain tasks, including discovery, post-998 settlement time, and clerical tasks. The Judge also declined to apply a multiplier enhancement to the lodestar fee award, finding that the action did not involve a contingent risk or require extraordinary legal skill.

The Judge ultimately awarded Plaintiff $19,523.33 in attorney fees and costs, based on the lodestar fee calculation and the reduction of certain hours and costs. The decision is subject to final approval and modification.
