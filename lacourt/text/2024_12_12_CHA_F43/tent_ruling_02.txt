SUMMARY
OF ACTION
Plaintiff
Jane AW Doe (Plaintiff) brings this case pursuant to sections 340.1 and 905,
subdivision (m), of the California Tort Claims Act.  Plaintiff alleges that while she was a minor
attending Granada Hills Charter High School, Archer Yuji Nishioka, Plaintiff’s
teacher, sexually abused, harassed, and molested her.  Plaintiff alleges the abuse occurred between
August 2018 and May 2019.  Plaintiff sued
Defendants Archer Yuji Nishioka (Nishioka), Granada Hills Charter (Granada),
and Does 2 to 100 on May 17, 2024.  
 
Plaintiff’s
First Amended Complaint alleges causes of action for negligence, intentional
infliction of emotional distress, sexual assault, sexual battery, and false
imprisonment. 
 
On
June 28, 2024, Plaintiff propounded on Granada her Requests for Production, Set
One.  Plaintiff granted Granada two
extensions to respond.  Granada served its
verified responses and privilege log on September 30, 2024.  Granada served another privilege log on
November 12, 2024.  
 
On
November 12, 2024, Plaintiff filed this motion to compel further responses to
her Requests for Production, Set One numbers 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22,
23, 24, and 25.  Granada filed its
opposition on November 27, 2024. 
Plaintiff replied on November 5, 2024. 
On December 6, 2024, Granada filed a request for permission to file a
sur-reply to a new argument in Plaintiff’s reply. 
 
Meet and Confer
A
motion to compel further responses to requests for production must be
accompanied by a meet and confer declaration showing a “reasonable and good
faith attempt” to resolve issues outside court. 
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2016.040, 2031.310, subd. (b)(2).)  
 
Plaintiff’s
counsel, Michael M. Marzban states the parties met and conferred telephonically
on October 3, 2024.  (Declaration of
Michael M. Marzban, ¶ 8.)  Granada’s
counsel stated she could not produce further records without a signed
authorization from Nishioka.  (Ibid.)  Plaintiff’s counsel contacted Nishioka’s
counsel, and the parties did not come to an agreement. 
 
Summary of Arguments
Plaintiff
moves for further responses to request nos. 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23,
24, and 25.  Granada produced redacted
documents and failed to comply with section 2031.230 for the documents it could
not locate.  Granada is withholding Nishioka’s
personnel records and its administrative rules, class rosters, and board
policies.  Plaintiff’s requests were
reasonably calculated to lead to evidence showing Granada’s lack of foresight
caused Plaintiff’s foreseeable harm.  Evidence
of prior complaints against Nishioka and Granada’s response, or lack thereof,
to these complaints is relevant to show Granada ratified Nishioka’s
actions.  Plaintiff’s necessity for the
information sought outweighs privacy issues because the information will allow
Plaintiff to determine inadequacies in Granada’s oversight of students and
staff, the information is in Granada’s exclusive control, and Plaintiff has no
alternate means of obtaining the information.  The child sexual abuse incident reports are
not privileged or protected by the work-product doctrine because their dominant
purpose is ensuring student safety rather than preparing for litigation.  
 
Granada
argues in opposition that the Court should deny Plaintiff’s motion because the separate
statement is noncompliant and it is unclear which documents are at issue in
Plaintiff’s motion.  Granada has offered
to produce Nishioka’s personnel file if the Court orders Granada to do so or if
Nishioka gives permission.  The Suspected
Child Abuse Reports and the Confidential Investigation report and supporting
statements prepared by Granada’s employees were prepared with the assistance of
counsel following an attorney-directed investigation and are privileged.  Further, the Penal Code section 11167.5,
subdivision (a), makes it a misdemeanor to produce “child abuse or neglect
investigative reports that result in a summary report being filed with the
Department of Justice.”  Such information
is also not discoverable.  Further, the
work-product doctrine protects the Confidential Investigation Report because
the report and its supporting documents were gathered by employees to help
attorney prepare for litigation.  Finally, Plaintiff completely ignores the
privacy interests and rights of other alleged victims who are not involved in this
case.  Education Code section 49076
protects the privacy rights of alleged victims not represented by Plaintiff’s
counsel.  
 
In
reply, Plaintiff argues the separate statement complies with Rule of Court
3.1345(c).  Because neither Granada nor
Nishioka oppose production of Nishioka’s personnel file, the Court should order
Granada to produce it.  The public
interest outweighs the privacy rights at issue here.  The requested reports contain information
relevant to determining whether Granada knew or had reason to know about
Nishioka’s abuse of children prior to the end of his abuse of Plaintiff.  Granada’s evidence (Julia Howelman Declaration)
contains statements proving documents were created prior to any privilege
attaching.  Suspected Child Abuse Reports
are discoverable because Penal Code section 11167.5, subd. (b)(11) requires disclosure
of such reports to a person who is identified in the Department of Justice as
listed in the Child Abuse Central Index. 
Plaintiff’s name is listed in the files in the index and is entitled to
the reports.  
 
 
 
ANALYSIS
A
demanding party may move to compel further responses to requests for production
where the demanding party is not satisfied with the responding party’s
responses.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§
2031.310, subd. (a).)  The demanding
party must serve the motion to compel further within 45 days after service of
verified responses.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.310, subd. (c).) If the responding party serves unverified responses, the
45-day time limit does not run until verified responses are served. (See Golf
& Tennis Pro Shop, Inc. v. Superior Court (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 127,
135-136.) The parties may extend the deadline through a written stipulation.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (c).)
 
The
demanding party must file a separate statement with its motion to compel
further responses to requests for production. 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(a)(3).)  “The separate statement must be full and
complete so that no person is required to review any other document in order
to determine the full request and the full response.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(c)
[emphasis added].)  The separate statement must contain: “(1) The text of
the request, interrogatory, question, or inspection demand; (2) The text of
each response, answer, or objection, and any further responses or answers; (3)
A statement of the factual and legal reasons for compelling further responses,
answers, or production as to each matter in dispute; (4) If necessary, the text
of all definitions, instructions, and other matters required to understand each
discovery request and the responses to it; (5) If the response to a particular
discovery request is dependent on the response given to another discovery
request, or if the reasons a further response to a particular discovery request
is deemed necessary are based on the response to some other discovery request,
the other request and the response to it must be set forth; and (6) If the
pleadings, other documents in the file, or other items of discovery are
relevant to the motion, the party relying on them must summarize each relevant
document.”  (Ibid.)
 
A
separate statement is not required where the court allows the demanding party
to submit a concise outline of the discovery request and each response in
dispute.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1345(b)(2).)  The Court may, in its
discretion, deny a motion to compel further production if the motion is
accompanied by a deficient separate statement. 
(Cf. In re Marriage of Moore (2024) 102 Cal.App.5th 1275, 1296;
see also Mills v. U.S. Bank (2008) 166 Cal.App.4th 871, 893.)  
 
The
Court has reviewed the documents related to his motion and finds the
Plaintiff’s separate statement is deficient for several reasons. First,
Plaintiff neglected to include Granada’s full initial responses to her requests.  Second, Plaintiff does not provide legal
authority to support the arguments in her separate statement.  Finally, even though Plaintiff provides a
plethora of legal authority in her motion papers, without listing which
specific responses and request numbers Plaintiff’s arguments reference, the
Court cannot fully evaluate Plaintiff’s motion on the merits.  
 
Accordingly,
the Court denies Plaintiff’s motion to compel further responses to Request for
Production, Set One, without prejudice.  
 
CONCLUSION
The motion is denied without prejudice.
 
Plaintiff
to give notice.
