Finally, even though Plaintiff provides a plethora of legal authority in her motion papers, without listing which specific responses and request numbers Plaintiff's arguments reference, the Court cannot fully evaluate Plaintiff's motion on the merits."

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to requests for production, set one, without prejudice. The plaintiff had requested that the defendant, Granada Hills Charter, produce further responses to requests 15-25, which relate to allegations of sexual abuse by a teacher, Archer Yuji Nishioka. The judge found that the plaintiff's separate statement was deficient for several reasons, including the failure to include the defendant's full initial responses, the lack of legal authority to support the arguments, and the failure to specify which responses and request numbers the arguments reference. The judge also noted that the public interest does not outweigh the privacy rights at issue in this case, and that the requested reports are not discoverable. The motion is denied without prejudice, meaning that the plaintiff may refile the motion with a revised separate statement.
