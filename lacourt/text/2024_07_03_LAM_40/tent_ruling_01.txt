I. Background
A. Motion to be Relieved as
Counsel
On April 12, 2024,
Plaintiffs’ counsel Reeder McCreary, LLP filed motions to be relieved as
counsel for Plaintiffs Slauson Gas Station, LLC and Ebrahim Neysanni.
The April 12th motions
attach proof of service showing service of the motions on Ebrahim Neysanni and
Oscar Rodriguez, with Oscar also named as person authorized to accept service,
seemingly for co-Defendant Blueart Interiors. Slauson Gas Station, LLC was
dismissed without prejudice on February 22, 2024, based on lack of good
standing with the California Secretary of State.
As of this date, Reeder
McCreary, LLP’s motions are unopposed.
Reeder McCreary, LLP’s
motions are now before the Court.
B. Default and Failure to
Prosecute
On March 16, 2022, Plaintiffs Slauson
Gas Station, LLC (dismissed on Feb. 22, 2024) and Ebrahim Neysanni secured
entries of default against Defendants Oscar Rodriguez and Blueart Interiors.
On March 17, 2022, the Court
ordered this action dismissed for Plaintiffs’ failure to appear at a case
management conference that day.
On November 28, 2022, the Court
granted a motion to vacate the March 17, 2022, dismissal.
Between March 28, 2023, and May 17,
2024, the Court held various hearings in this action, namely Orders to Show
Cause (OSCs) re Default. During that time, and despite Plaintiff’s counsel’s
promises regarding Plaintiffs’ intent to obtain default judgment against
Defendants Rodriguez and Blueart, Plaintiffs have failed to file a default
judgment package against Rodriguez or Blueart.
On March 22, 2024, the Court set an
OSC re Dismissal Pursuant to CCP §583.130 for May 17, 2024, which the Court
continued on May 17, 2024, from that same day to July 3, 2024, i.e., the
present hearing.
 
II. Motions to be Relieved as Counsel: GRANTED.
A. Legal Standard
“The question of granting or
denying an application of an attorney to withdraw as counsel ([without client
consent pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure, section] 284, subd. (2)) is one
which lies within the sound discretion of the trial court ‘having in mind
whether such withdrawal might work an injustice in the handling of the case.’”
(People v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406 [internal quotations
omitted].)
For an attorney to be relieved as
counsel, the attorney must comply with the requirements of California Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362, subdivisions (a) and (c) to (e). These subdivisions require
that an attorney file and show proof of service of (1) a notice and motion to
be relived as counsel on Judicial Council form MC-051, (2) a declaration in
support of the motion to be relived as counsel on Judicial Council form MC-052,
and (3) a proposed order in support of the motion to be relieved as counsel on
Judicial Council form MC-053.
The court should consider whether
the attorney’s “withdrawal can be accomplished without undue prejudice to the
client’s interests.” (Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904,
915.) Moreover, the motion should also be denied if it will cause undue delay
in the proceeding or cause injustice. (Mandell v. Superior Court (1977)
67 Cal.App.3d 1, 4.)
B. Analysis
The Court GRANTS Reeder
McCreary, LLP’s motions as to itself and individual counsel.
First, Plaintiffs’ counsel Reeder
McCreary, LLP complied with Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362. Within 16
court days of the hearing, plus additional days to respond based on manner of
service, Reeder McCreary, LLP filed Judicial Council forms
MC-051 to MC-053 with the Court and served the same on Ebrahim Neysanni and
Oscar Rodriguez, with Oscar accepting service on behalf of Blueart Interiors. A
review of the Judicial Council forms filed for each Plaintiff shows that the
forms are complete and properly filled out.
Second, there is a valid reason for
withdrawal: A conflict of interest has arisen that is sufficiently serious to
ethically require counsel to cease performing work on behalf of Plaintiffs.
Third, because there is no trial
date in this action, and because no party filed an opposition to Reeder
McCreary, LLP’s motions, no prejudice or delay exists to deny Reeder
McCreary, LLP’s motions.
 
III. OSC re Default, OSC re Failure to Prosecute, and
Dismissal: 19STCV42870 DISMISSED.
The Court DISMISSES this action,
without prejudice, for failure to prosecute.
The Court DISCHARGES the Order to
Show Cause Re: Default and the Order to Show Cause Re: Dismissal Pursuant to
CCP §583.130 for Failure to Prosecute on calendar for this action.
