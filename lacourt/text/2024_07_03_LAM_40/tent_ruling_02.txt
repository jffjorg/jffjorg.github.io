 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
Cross-Defendant
  Doe 155 Yanes Rain Gutters, Inc.’s Motion for Determination of Good Faith
  Settlement [Res ID # 9796].



 
I. Background
Seven pleadings have been filed in
this action, which was originally assigned to Department 55 at the Stanley Mosk
Courthouse.
On September 6, 2022,
Cross-Defendant Utopia Development, Inc. (UDI) filed a Cross-Complaint alleging
claims of equitable indemnity, apportionment/contribution, express indemnity,
breach of contract, and declaratory relief.
On June 14, 2023, UDI filed an
Amendment to Cross-Complaint naming Doe 155 as Defendant Yanes Rain Gutters,
Inc. (Yanes).
On April 9, 2024, Yanes filed a
motion for determination of good faith settlement between itself and UDI. The
motion was set for hearing on July 12, 2024.
On April 10, 2024, Yanes filed an
ex parte application to advance the hearing on its motion for determination of
good faith settlement.
That same day, Roe 76 R A
Construction, Inc. filed a peremptory challenge.
On April 12, 2024, Department 55
granted the peremptory challenge and reassigned this action to Department 40 at
the Stanley Mosk Courthouse (the Court).
On April 12, 2024, the Court set a
case management conference for June 11, 2024.
On June 11, 2024, the Court held
the case management conference and scheduled Yanes’s motion for determination
of good faith settlement for July 3, 2024.
That same day, Yanes filed an
amended notice for its motion for determination of good faith settlement.
Cross-Defendant Yanes’s motion is
now before the Court.
 
II. Motion for Determination of Good Faith Settlement:
TENATIVELY GRANTED.
A. Legal Standard
Any party to an action in which it
is alleged that two or more parties are joint tortfeasors or co-obligors on a
contract debt is entitled to a hearing on the issue of the good faith of a
settlement entered into by the plaintiff or other claimant and one or more
alleged tortfeasors or co-obligors. (Code Civ. Proc., § 877.6, subd. (a)(1).)
In the alternative, a settling
party may give notice of settlement to all parties and to the court, together
with an application for determination of good faith settlement and a proposed
order. (Code Civ. Proc., § 877.6, subd. (a)(2).) The application shall indicate
the settling parties, and the basis, terms, and amount of the settlement. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 877.6, subd. (a)(2).) The notice, application, and proposed order
shall be given by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by personal
service, with proof of service to be filed with the court. (Code Civ. Proc., §
877.6, subd. (a)(2).) Within 25 days of the mailing of the notice, application,
and proposed order, or within 20 days of personal service, a nonsettling party
may file a notice of motion to contest the good faith of the settlement. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 877.6, subd. (a)(2).) If none of the nonsettling parties files a
motion within 25 days of mailing of the notice, application, and proposed
order, or within 20 days of personal service, the court may approve the
settlement. (Code Civ. Proc., § 877.6, subd. (a)(2).) However, this subsection
does not apply to settlements in which a confidentiality agreement has been
entered into regarding the case or the terms of the settlement. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 877.6, subd. (a)(2).)
The issue of the good faith of a
settlement may be determined by the court on the basis of affidavits served
with the notice of hearing, and any counteraffidavits filed in response, or the
court may, in its discretion, receive other evidence at the hearing. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 877.6, subd. (b).)
A party asserting lack of good
faith in settlement has the burden of proving lack of good faith. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 877.6, subd. (d).) The objecting party may carry its burden by
demonstrating that the settlement is so far “out of the ballpark” in relation
to various factors, including:
(1) A rough approximation of
plaintiff’s total recovery and the settlor’s proportionate liability; 
(2) The amount paid in settlement; 
(3) The allocation of settlement
proceeds among plaintiffs; 
(4) A recognition that a settlor
should pay less in settlement than it would if it were found liable after a
trial; 
(5) The financial conditions and
insurance policy limits of settling defendants; and 
(6) The existence of collusion,
fraud, or tortious conduct aimed to injure the interests of the non-settling
defendants. 
(Tech-Bilt, Inc. v.
Woodward-Clyde & Assocs. (1985) 38 Cal.3d 488, 499-500.)
A determination by the court that
the settlement was made in good faith shall bar any other joint tortfeasor or
co-obligor from any further claims against the settling tortfeasor or
co-obligor for equitable comparative contribution, or partial or comparative
indemnity, based on comparative negligence or comparative fault. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 877.6, subd. (c); Britz, Inc. v. Dow Chemical Co. (1999) 73
Cal.App.4th 177, 180 (Britz) [finding a good faith settlement
determination discharges indemnity claims by other tortfeasors, whether or not
named as parties to the action, provided they were given notice and an
opportunity to be heard].)
B. Analysis
1. Service of
Notice, Motion, and Proposed Order
The Court requires greater clarity
as to proof of service.
Here, the proof of service and
service list attached to the notice and amended notice of motion show service
on all parties but for: (1) Gerardo Hernandez Martinez (FAC; Business Alliance
Cross-Complaint); (2) Wesco Insurance Company (FAC); (3) Genty Group Inc.
(Business Alliance Cross-Complaint; dismissed from FAC and from Ohit Casualty Cross-Complaint);
and (4) various Does named in Judicial Council Amendments to Complaint by (a)
Old Republic, Inc., on November 16, 2022, (b) Plaintiffs on April 6, 2023, and
(c) UDI on March 29, 2023, and June 14 and 15, 2023.
The Court requires greater clarity as
to service on these parties, including, for example, whether these parties have
not appeared or have been dismissed and thus need not have been served.
2. Required
Information in Motion
Yanes’s motion contains Yanes and
UDI’s settlement terms: $35,000 from Yanes, Burlington, and Colony to Utopia;
the execution of a release agreement with specific terms; each side pays its
fees and costs; settlement contingent on approval by the Court; and dismissal
after an order. (Mot., p. 4, Lowe Decl., ¶ 13.)
Note: the Court cannot locate
“Burlington” or “Colony” in the record, either as parties explicitly named in a
pleading or Does named in an amendment.
This information satisfies Code of
Civil Procedure section 877.6, subdivision (a)(2) on this issue.
3. Challenges
by Non-Settling Parties
No challenges appear in the record
from any party that was served with Yanes’s motion.
However, the Court does not make a
final determination relating to this point until the Court has greater clarity
on whether all parties to the action were served pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 877.6, subdivision (a)(2).
4. Confidentiality
Agreement
Yanes’s motion contains Yanes and
UDI’s settlement terms, as discussed above, thus satisfying Code of Civil
Procedure section 877.6, subdivision (a)(2) on this issue.
5. Tech-Bilt
Factors
The Court does not proceed with a Tech-Bilt
analysis for lack of an opposition.
However, the Court does not make a
final determination relating to this point until the Court has greater clarity
on whether all parties to the action were served pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 877.6, subdivision (a)(2).
6. Final Determination
Yanes’s motion is TENATIVELY
GRANTED subject to proof of service of the motion on “all parties.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 877.6, subd. (a)(2).)
 
III. Conclusion
Cross-Defendant Doe 155 Yanes Rain Gutters, Inc.’s Motion for
Determination of Good Faith Settlement [Res ID # 9796] is TENATIVELY
GRANTED upon proof of service on all parties.
