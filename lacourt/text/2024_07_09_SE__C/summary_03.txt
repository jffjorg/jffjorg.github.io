Here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling granting the plaintiff's motion to compel the deposition of the defendant's person most knowledgeable (PMK) and the production of documents. The plaintiff brought the motion after the defendant failed to produce the PMK for deposition and provide responsive documents. The Court found that the defendant's actions constitute a misuse of the discovery process and ordered the defendant to produce the PMK for deposition within 45 days, absent an agreement by the parties to a later date. However, the Court declined to impose sanctions on the defendant due to a lack of evidence showing that the defendant acted without substantial justification.
