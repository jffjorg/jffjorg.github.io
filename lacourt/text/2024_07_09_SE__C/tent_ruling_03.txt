Background 
Plaintiff Hector Argueta’s (“Plaintiff”) sues Defenant
American Honda Motor Co., Inc. (“Defendant”) after purchasing a 2021 Honda
Pilot; VIN: 5FNYF5H2XMB008330 (the “Subject Vehicle”) which allegedly contains defects
and nonconformities in violation of the Song-Beverly Warranty Act.
Plaintiff moves to compel the deposition of Defendant’s Person
Most Knowledgeable (“PMK”) and the production of documents. On April 17, 2023, Plaintiff
noticed the deposition of Defendant’s PMK for May 5, 2023. (Derderian Decl., ¶
22.) This notice included requests for production of documents. On April 28,
2023, Defendant served its objections and response to Plaintiff’s notice of deposition
and did not provide a PMK witness as noticed. (Id., ¶ 23.) 
On May 24, 2023, in an attempt to avoid Court intervention
and come to a mutually agreeable date for deposition, Plaintiff served an amended
notice of deposition for June 7, 2023. (Id. ¶ 24; Ex. 6.) On June 1,
2023, Defendant served its objections and response to Plaintiff’s amended notice
of deposition. (Id. ¶ 25; Ex. 7.)
On December 8, 2023, Defendant’s counsel offered January
26, 2024, to Plaintiff’s counsel to depose Defendant’s PMK in whatever case
they chose. (Rein Decl. at ¶ 8, Ex G.) On December 10, 2023, Defendant’s
counsel offered the additional date of January 11, 2024, to Plaintiff’s counsel
for the deposition of Defendant’s PMK in whatever case they chose. (Rein Decl.
at ¶ 8, Ex. G.) 
On February 20, 2024, Plaintiff served a second amended notice
of deposition for March 21, 2024. (Derderian Decl., ¶ 26.) On March 14, 2024,
Defendant served its objections to Plaintiff’s second amended notice.  Defendant again failed to provide a PMK
witness as noticed and failed to provide a mutually agreeable date for the
deposition. (Id. ¶ 27; Ex. 9.)
Plaintiff served the instant motion on May 31, 2024.  
To date, Defendant’s PMK has not been produced for
deposition and no responsive documents have been produced. 
Legal
Standard 
Pursuant
to California Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.410, subdivision (a), “[i]f,
after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action… without having
served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to appear for
examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for inspection any document…
described in the deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an
order compelling the deponent's attendance and testimony, and the production
for inspection of any document… described in the deposition notice.” Code of
Civil Procedure section 2025.410 provides that objections may be made to a
deposition subpoena on the grounds that there are irregularities or errors in
the process or form of the notice or subpoena. 
 
A
motion made pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2024.450 must (1) set
forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the production for
inspection of any document and (2) be accompanied by a meet and confer letter,
“or, when the deponent fails to attend the deposition and produce the documents
described in the deposition notice,… by a declaration stating that the
petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire about the nonappearance.” 
 
Discussion 
In opposition, Defense Counsel contends
she sent Plaintiff dates in January but did not hear back from Plaintiff’s Counsel.
Defense Counsel also contends that Plaintiff’s Counsel failed to appear without
notice for a deposition in another case. (Rein Decl., ¶ 9.) Defense Counsel
states that she will seek a trial continuance and will provide a date for
deposition closer to the continued trial date. (Rein Decl., ¶ 14.) 
Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Deposition
and Production of Documents is GRANTED.  Defendant is ordered to produce
its PMK for deposition within 45 days, absent an agreement by the parties to a
later date.  The Court makes no further findings or orders about the scope
of the deposition. 
Sanctions
¿ 
CCP¿section¿2025.450(c)
provides, “(1) If a motion under subdivision (a) is granted, the court shall
impose a monetary sanction . . . in favor of the party who noticed the
deposition and against the deponent or the party with whom the deponent is
affiliated, unless the court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust.”¿ (Id., § 2025.450(c).)¿ 
¿ 
CCP
section 2023.030(a) provides that¿“[t]he court may impose a monetary sanction
ordering that one engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any
attorney advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses, including
attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct. . . .¿If
a monetary sanction is authorized by any provision of this title, the court
shall impose that sanction unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the¿sanction unjust.”¿¿Failing to respond¿or to submit to an
authorized method of discovery is a misuse of the discovery process.¿ (Id.,¿§
2023.010(d).)¿ 
 
Here, Defendant’s Counsel asserts she invited Plaintiff’s
Counsel to discuss scheduling of the deposition on at least four occasions (Rein
Decl., ¶¶ 3, 6, 7, 12).  Instead of meeting
and conferring, Plaintiff’s Counsel continued to unilaterally set deposition
dates.  Because no Reply brief was filed,
Defendant’s assertion is uncontradicted. 
Under the circumstances, the Court declines to impose sanctions.
