```

And here is the summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is issuing a tentative ruling on two motions for sanctions filed by defendants O&C Hillside and Sedrak. The judge finds that the motion for sanctions filed by O&C Hillside is moot because the court's previous ruling on the matter has rendered it unnecessary.

As for Sedrak's motion for sanctions, the judge denies it. The judge finds that the plaintiff's lawsuit against Sedrak is not frivolous and that the plaintiff has presented evidence that raises a triable issue of material fact as to whether Sedrak's actions prevented the plaintiff from satisfying its obligations. The judge also finds that the plaintiff's claim for declaratory relief is not frivolous because an actual controversy has been established and declaratory relief would be required to preserve the rights and obligations of the parties.

The judge concludes that the plaintiff did not act in bad faith in maintaining its lawsuit against Sedrak and that sanctions are not warranted under California Code of Civil Procedure sections 128.5 and 128.7.
