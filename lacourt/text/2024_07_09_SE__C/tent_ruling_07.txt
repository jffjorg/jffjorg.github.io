v. Lopez, et al., Case No. 24NWCV00960
 
This
is an unlawful detainer action. Defendants Daniel Lopez and Nidelvia Yah move
ex parte to vacate and set aside the default and default judgment entered
against them on June 17, 2024, quash any writ, and stay the execution in the
instant case. 
 
On
April 11, 2024, Defendants demurred to the complaint.
 
On
May 31, 2024, Defendants answered. 
 
On
June 4, 2024, the Court overruled Defendants’ demurrer. 
 
Because
Defendants both demurred and answered, the motion for default is vacated and
the ex parte motion is MOOT.
