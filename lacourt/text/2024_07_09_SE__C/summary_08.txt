And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the file and is inclined to grant the defendant's motion to set aside default. The defendant claims it did not receive actual notice of the May 29, 2024 ex parte hearing and was unaware it had to answer within 5 days. However, the court notes that the minute order reflects that the clerk provided notice of the court's ruling to the parties. The court also notes that the defendant's argument is the same one it made in its previous motion to set aside default, which was granted. The court determines that the defendant's claim of ignorance is not supported by the record and is made solely for the purpose of delay. Therefore, the ex parte application is denied. The hearing on the motion to set aside default is advanced to July 9, 2024, and the demurrer is stricken. The defendant is ordered to file and serve an answer or other responsive pleading within 5 days.
