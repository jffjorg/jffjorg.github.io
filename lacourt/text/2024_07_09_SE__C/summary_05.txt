Summary in English:

The Judge's tentative ruling states that Plaintiff Christopher Doliveira's motions to compel responses to discovery requests are moot because Defendant FCA US, LLC has served responses to the requests. The Judge finds that Defendant's failure to serve timely responses was due to mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. As a result, the Judge grants monetary sanctions to Plaintiff in the amount of $1980.00, including costs, payable within 60 days, for the unreasonable delay in serving responses.
