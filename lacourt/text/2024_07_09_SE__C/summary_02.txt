And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the motions for summary judgment brought by Recycled Base Materials, Inc. (RBM) and Security Paving Company, Inc. (Security) on the grounds that the workers' compensation exclusivity provisions apply to RBM and Security and that the plaintiffs' claims are barred. The court also granted Sully-Miller Contracting Company's motion for summary judgment on the grounds that it is not liable for the plaintiff's injuries under the Privette Doctrine.

The court found that RBM and Security had made a prima facie showing that they dually employed Matthew Woolsey, the decedent, and that the workers' compensation exclusivity provisions apply to them. The court also found that Security had made a prima facie showing that it did not have control over the decedent's work at the time of the accident.

The court concluded that the plaintiffs had not raised any triable issues of fact regarding the defendants' liability and that the motions for summary judgment were therefore granted.
