RULING: Motion

Timothy W. Mazzela
of Law Offices of Timothy W. Mazzela, counsel of record for Plaintiff Zunab
Mitchell, seeks to be relieved as counsel for that party.¿Counsel filed a
motion with the required Forms MC-051, MC-052, and MC-053. Counsel’s
declaration states that there has been a breakdown of attorney client
communication that has made it impossible for the attorney to carryout
effective representation.
 
Absent a
showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney’s request for withdrawal should be
granted.¿(People v. Prince¿(1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406.)¿There is no
showing of prejudice, and counsel’s motion complies with California Rules of
Court, Rule 3.1362 and meets its requirements.
 
Motion to be
relieved as counsel is granted.
 
Moving party to
give notice.
