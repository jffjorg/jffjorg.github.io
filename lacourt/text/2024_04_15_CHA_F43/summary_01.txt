And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

In this case, the defendant, Sylmar Health and Rehabilitation Center, Inc., has moved for a protective order to exempt it from answering certain special interrogatories propounded by the plaintiff, Richard Leyva. The plaintiff has alleged that the defendant failed to protect him from multiple falls, resulting in a traumatic brain injury, and is seeking to discover information to show the defendant's pattern of abuse.

The court has granted the defendant's motion for a protective order, finding that the information sought by the plaintiff is confidential and protected under HIPAA and California law. The court has balanced the right of the plaintiff to discover relevant facts against the right of third parties to maintain reasonable privacy regarding their sensitive personal affairs.

The court has also noted that the plaintiff has not shown a compelling interest in obtaining the requested information and that the defendant's privacy interests outweigh the plaintiff's interests in discovery. The court has further held that the plaintiff's request for the identity of witnesses to the plaintiff's falls, with the names of residents or responsible persons redacted, pending a court order to disclose, is a more limited and less intrusive means of obtaining the requested information.

The court's decision is based on the balancing of competing interests and the application of relevant laws, including California's Confidentiality of Medical Information Act (CMIA) and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).
