And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding a default judgment application filed by Plaintiff Shahla Melamed against Defendants Gabrijel Krstanovic and Seaside Construction Management Company, LLC. The application seeks $5 million in punitive damages, but the judge has denied this request because no evidence of the defendants' financial condition was provided. The judge cited California law and case citations to support this decision, stating that evidence of a defendant's financial condition is necessary to determine whether an award of punitive damages is excessive. The judge has given Plaintiff permission to file an amended proposed judgment that omits the request for punitive damages and adjust the corresponding fee request.
