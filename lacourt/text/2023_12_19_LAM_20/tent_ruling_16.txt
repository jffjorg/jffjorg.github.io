 On December 15, 2022, Plaintiffs Travis Leonard, Donnie Fazard Hosein, Nhu Quynh Nguyen, Keisha Sharon Alfred, Peter Smith, Phenisha Gary, Lashaunda Bell, and Darlene Taylor filed the operative Complaint against Defendant 6834 De Celis, LLC for violations of building standards for original construction. Plaintiffs now seek leave to file a first amended complaint “(1) clarifying the names of the Plaintiffs and the real parties in interest, (2) adding a doe defendant to the pleadings to clarify the parties to the action, (3) adding the claims listed in Plaintiffs’ Notice of Subsequently Discovered Claims Pursuant to California Code §895 et seq and §932, dated October 25, 2023, to the pleadings; and (4) adding causes of action for Negligence as to certain Plaintiffs at certain Properties related to allegations against Defendants for negligently furnishing, construction, and installing the components of the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems.”The Court may, in the furtherance of justice, and upon any terms as may be proper, allow a party to amend any pleading.  (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 473, 576.)  In general, California courts liberally exercise discretion to permit amendment of pleadings in light of a strong policy favoring resolution of all disputes between parties in the same action.  (Nestle v. Santa Monica (1972) 6 Cal.3d 920, 939; Morgan v. Superior Court (1959) 172 Cal.App.2d 527, 530.)  “[T]here is a strong policy in favor of liberal allowance of amendments.”  (Mesler v. Bragg Management Co. (1985) 39 Cal.3d 290, 296.)  Pursuant to this policy, requests for leave to amend generally will be granted unless the party seeking to amend has been dilatory in bringing the proposed amendment before the Court, and the delay in seeking leave to amend will cause prejudice to the opposing party if leave to amend is granted.  (Hirsa v. Superior Court (1981) 118 Cal.App.3d 486, 490; Higgins v. Del Faro (1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 558, 564-565.)  The decision on a motion for leave is directed to the sound discretion of the trial court.  (See generally Weil & Brown, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2014) ¶¶ 6:637 et seq.)Because there is no opposition and it is not apparent what prejudice there would be, the Motion is granted.Moving party to give notice.If counsel do not submit on the tentative, they are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
