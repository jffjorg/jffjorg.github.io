```

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge is granting the motion for summary judgment in favor of the defendants, Morad Golcheh and Nahid Golcheh. The Judge finds that the defendants have carried their burden to show that the contract required the listing agents, and not the sellers, to provide furniture and staining. The contract explicitly states that the listing agents will pay for and provide furniture and staining, and the defendants' discovery responses show that they never made a separate promise to guarantee these services. The Judge also finds that the defendants' testimony shows that they never entered into an agreement with the listing agents to deprive the plaintiff of the furniture and staining. The opposition's arguments fail to raise a triable issue of fact, and therefore, the motion for summary judgment is granted.
