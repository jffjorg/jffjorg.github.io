Case No./Name.:         22STCV25721 EDGAR RAMON SANDOVAL
GARCIA, et al. vs JAMES MICHAEL PARFITT
Motion:                              MOTION TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL
Moving Party:                 Plaintiffs’ Counsel Cohen &
Marzban
Responding Party:      Unopposed
Notice:                                Sufficient
 
Ruling:                               THE MOTION TO BE RELIEVED IS
GRANTED.
 
 
Background
 
Cohen &
Marzban, Law Corporation represents Plaintiffs Edgar Ramon Sandoval Garcia and
Mariana Juliette Sandoval Garcia. Cohen & Marzban moves to be relieved
as counsel, citing considerable difference of opinion regarding handling of the
case leading to an irremediable breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. Although
no opposition has been filed, Cohen & Marzban did file a supplemental
declaration on March 26, 2024, stating that Plaintiffs intend to appear at the
hearing to be heard.
 
Legal Standard
 
The Court has discretion to allow
an attorney to withdraw, and such a motion should be granted provided that
there is no prejudice to the client and it does not disrupt the orderly process
of justice. (See Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915; People
v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 403-407.)
¿¿ 
A motion to be relieved as counsel
must be made on Judicial Council Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion),
MC-052 (Declaration), and MC-053 (Proposed Order). (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362, subds. (a), (c), (e).) The requisite forms must be served “on the
client and on all parties that have appeared in the case.” (Cal. Rules of
Court, Rule 3.1362, subd. (d).)
¿ 
Analysis and Conclusion
¿ 
Cohen & Marzban has filed
Judicial Council Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion), MC-052
(Declaration), and MC-053 (Proposed Order). Cohen & Marzban seeks to be
relieved as counsel for Plaintiff on the grounds that there has been a
breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. The Court finds this to be
proper grounds for withdrawal. (See Estate of Falco (1987) 188
Cal.App.3d 1004, 1014 (a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship is
grounds for allowing the attorney to withdraw).)
 
The Court
notes that the next hearing is an FSC set for 7/23/24, which
should be sufficient time for Plaintiffs to retain new counsel. Alternatively,
if Plaintiffs or new counsel need additional time to prepare for trial,
sufficient time exists for Plaintiffs to take action to seek a continuance of
the trial. 
 
The Court
understands that Plaintiffs intend to appear at the hearing; the Court will, of
course, hear from the Parties, although it notes that Plaintiffs have failed to
file a written opposition, which can be deemed to waive all arguments against
the Motion (Southern California Gas Co. v. Flannery (2016) 5 Cal. App. 5th
476, 483 fn. 7).  Tentatively, based on
the foregoing, the Court GRANTS the Motion to be Relieved, effective upon Notice
on Plaintiffs.
