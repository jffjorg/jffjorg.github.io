And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling on a motion to seal exhibits in support of a motion for summary judgment. The defendants, Uber Technologies, Inc, RASIER, and Rasier-CA LLC, are seeking to seal exhibits that contain personal identifying information, criminal history, and driving status. The plaintiff, Anna Vaserfirer, does not object to the sealing of these exhibits. The court grants the motion to seal exhibits A and B to the Sauerwein Declaration, but denies the motion to seal exhibit A to the Gaddis Declaration. The court finds that the protection of privacy and avoidance of identity theft, harassment, and safety concerns is a compelling overriding interest that justifies the sealing of the exhibits.
