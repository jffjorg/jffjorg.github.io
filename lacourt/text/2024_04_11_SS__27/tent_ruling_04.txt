Background
 
On December 15, 2021,
Plaintiff initiated the current slip and fall case. On November 10, 2023,
Defendant Mokhtar Zhoobin served his second set of Form Interrogatories on
Plaintiff. Plaintiff failed to submit discovery responses by the statutory due
date. On December 29, 2023, Defendant inquired about the status of Plaintiff’s
discovery responses, but received no response. Consequently, on February 7,
2024, Defendant moved the court to compel Plaintiff’s responses. 
 
Legal Standard¿¿ 
 
A plaintiff may make a
demand for production of documents and propound interrogatories without leave
of court at any time 10 days after the service of the summons on, or appearance
by, the party to whom the demand is directed, whichever occurs first. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2031.020, subd. (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.020, subd. (b).) The
demand for production of documents is not limited by number, but the request
must comply with the formatting requirements in Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.030. A
party may propound 35 specially prepared interrogatories that are relevant to
the subject matter of the pending action and any additional number of official
form interrogatories that are relevant to the subject matter of the pending
action. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.030, subd. (a)(1) - (a)(2).)
 
The party whom the request
is propounded upon is required to respond within 30 days after service of a
demand, but the parties are allowed to informally agree to an extension and
confirm any such agreement in writing. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260, subd. (a);
Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.270, subd. (a)
- (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.270, subd. (a) - (b).)
 
If a party fails to timely
respond to a request for production or interrogatories, the party to whom the
request is directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings
under Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.230, and waives any objection, including one
based on privilege or on the protection for work product. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.300, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).)¿¿The party propounding the discovery requests may move
for an order compelling responses. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (b).) Unlike a
motion to compel further discovery responses, a motion to compel initial
discovery responses does not have any meet and confer requirements.
 
Code of Civil Procedure
section 2023.030, subdivision (a) provides, in pertinent part, that the court
may impose a monetary sanction on a party engaging in the misuse of the
discovery process to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees,
incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct. A misuse of the discovery
process includes failing to respond or submit to an authorized method of
discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d).)¿¿¿A court has discretion to fix the amount of reasonable
monetary sanctions. (Cornerstone Realty Advisors, LLC v. Summit Healthcare
Reit, Inc. (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th 771, 791.)
 
Analysis 
 
It is undisputed that
Plaintiff failed to serve an initial response within the statutory deadline.
Plaintiff filed an opposition but did not show that substantially compliant
responses were served prior to the hearing date. Therefore, the current Motion
to Compel is GRANTED.
 
Sanctions are mandatory against the
party, the attorney, or both whose failure to serve a timely discovery response
forced Defendant to file the present motion. Defendant has requested sanctions
in the amount of $572.00, which the Court deems reasonable. Given Plaintiff’s
counsel's due diligence in attempting to contact Plaintiff and current efforts
to withdraw as counsel, sanctions will be imposed on Plaintiff only. Plaintiff
is hereby ORDERED to pay sanctions in the amount of $572.00 to Defendant within
20 days from today.
