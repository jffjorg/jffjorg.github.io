And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a motion to dismiss filed by Remote Broadcasting Inc. The plaintiff, Dawn Marie Fisher, filed a complaint on February 26, 2021, alleging that a bike rack was removed, leaving a bolt sticking out on the roadway, and she tripped over it. The defendant, Adam F. Goldberg Productions, added Remote Broadcasting Inc. as a Doe defendant on September 6, 2023. The defendant moved to dismiss the action because the complaint was not served within two years of the filing date. The judge found that the plaintiff failed to demonstrate sufficient diligence in acquiring the identity of Remote Broadcasting Inc. and therefore granted the defendant's motion to dismiss the action.
