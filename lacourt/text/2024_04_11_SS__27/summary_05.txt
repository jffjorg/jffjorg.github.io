And here is the English-text summary:

The judge, Hon. Lee S. Arian, has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to be relieved as counsel for the plaintiffs, Edgar Ramon Sandoval Garcia and Mariana Juliette Sandoval Garcia, regarding their lawsuit against James Michael Parfitt. The motion was unopposed and was filed by Cohen & Marzban, the plaintiffs' counsel, citing a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. The court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw, and such a motion should be granted provided that there is no prejudice to the client and it does not disrupt the orderly process of justice. The court finds that this is proper grounds for withdrawal. The court notes that the next hearing is an FSC set for 7/23/24, which should be sufficient time for the plaintiffs to retain new counsel.
