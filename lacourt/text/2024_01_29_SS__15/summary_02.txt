Significant Statements:
  - The evidence would be more prejudicial than probative, would confuse the jury, and would consume an undue amount of time in a trial that is already too long.
  - An expert may rely on hearsay and tell the jury in general terms that he or she did so.
  - The court cannot categorically say that evidence mentioning industrial talc is completely irrelevant.
  - To the extent a party seeks to introduce the amounts of any settlement, judgment, verdict, or award in another litigation, the motion is deemed made and granted pursuant to the July 8, 2022 CMO.
  - Allowing that evidence will consume an undue amount of trial time exploring the reasons for the foreign investigations.
  - The evidence would have little probative value because foreign investigations do not result in regulations or law in the United States and would be confusing to the jury.
  - If an expert establishes that this is the type of background information relied upon by experts, the evidence may be relevant and admissible even if hearsay.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the various motions in limine filed by the defendants. The judge has granted some of the motions, including:

* Motion to exclude evidence about diseases caused by talc other than mesothelioma
* Motion to exclude article about asbestos in commercial talcum powder, unless an expert establishes a basis for its admissibility
* Motion to exclude evidence about foreign governmental investigations and proceedings into talcum powder
* Motion to bifurcate punitive damages

The judge has denied other motions, including:

* Motion to exclude documents from other entities, as it is too vague
* Motion to exclude evidence of industrial talc mines and products, as it is too vague
* Motion to exclude internal documents from Johnson & Johnson, Imerys, and Cyprus, as it is too vague
* Motion to exclude references to other lawsuits involving Defendant and its related entities or illness, as it is too vague
* Motion to exclude all photographs and videos of experiments and simulations conducted by experts or others, as it is too vague
* Motion to exclude references to products not at issue, as it duplicates another motion
* Motion to prevent Plaintiffs, Plaintiffs' counsel, and witnesses from using certain phrases, as it would prevent Plaintiffs from explaining their allegations
* Motion to exclude all evidence not disclosed 72 hours in advance, as it is not a proper motion in limine

The judge has also denied motions in part, including:

* Motion to exclude evidence of industrial talc mines and products, as it is too vague
* Motion to exclude references to other lawsuits involving Defendant and its related entities or illness, as it is too vague

The judge's tentative ruling is subject to change based on further argument and evidence presented at the hearing.
