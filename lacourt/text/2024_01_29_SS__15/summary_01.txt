And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on two motions filed by Merle Norman Cosmetics, Inc. (Defendant). The first motion is to exclude the testimony of Mark Bailey, an expert witness, because the plaintiffs produced his report late. The Judge finds that Section 2034.260 of the Code of Civil Procedure does not require the exchange of expert reports, and therefore, the Defendant did not show that the plaintiffs produced the report late. Additionally, the Judge finds that the evidence that the samples tested by Mark Bailey were unopened and labelled as from Merle Norman is sufficient for a prima facie showing that the samples were Merle Norman products.

The second motion is to bifurcate punitive damages, which the Judge grants. The Judge orders the moving party to give notice.

The Judge denies the motion to exclude Mark Bailey's testimony, finding that the Defendant did not show good cause to depart from the July 8, 2022 Court's Minute Order, which deemed motions to exclude irrelevant testimony denied. The Judge also finds that the Defendant did not show that it used different talc over the years, making the fact that the plaintiff did not use the actual container tested not significant.
