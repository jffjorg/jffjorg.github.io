failed to lodge a courtesy copy of their opposition in violation of the
Presiding Judge’s First Amended General Order Re: Mandatory Electronic Filing.  Their counsel is admonished to provide
courtesy copies of all relevant documents in future filings in this case,
including before the I/C judge.

courts look to the substance of an injunction to determine whether it is
prohibitory or mandatory.  Agricultural
Labor Relations Bd. v. Superior Court, (1983) 149 Cal.App.3d 709, 713.  A mandatory injunction — one that mandates a
party to affirmatively act, carries a heavy burden: “[t]he granting of a
mandatory injunction pending trial is not permitted except in extreme cases
where the right thereto is clearly established.”  Teachers Ins. & Annuity Assoc. v.
Furlotti, (1999) 70 Cal.App.4th 187, 1493.

However, a court may issue an injunction to maintain the status quo
without a cause of action in the complaint.

reply, Bank requests judicial notice of (1) the court’s tentative ruling and
minute order on the Bank’s application for a writ of possession, both dated
September 12, 2023 (RJN Exs. A-B; Rasheed Reply Decl., ¶¶ 3-4, Exs. A-B); and
(2) the order for writ of possession, signed October 23, 2023 (RJN Ex. C;
Rasheed Reply Decl., ¶6, Ex. E).  The
court need not judicially notice these documents; it is always free to review
prior filings in the current action.
