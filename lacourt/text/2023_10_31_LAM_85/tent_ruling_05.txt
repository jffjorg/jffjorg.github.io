 Case Number:  22STCP04201    Hearing Date:   October 31, 2023    Dept:  85 
Deborah
Smith v. City of Inglewood Housing Authority and Artie Fields, 22STCP04201

Tentative
decision petition for writ of mandate: granted for remand



            
 
Petitioner Deborah Smith (“Smith”) seeks writ of mandate
compelling Respondents City of Inglewood Housing Authority and Artie Fields in
his capacity as City Manager and Housing Authority Executive Director (collectively,
“HA”) to reverse the decisions to terminate Smith’s Section 8 voucher, to collect
the overpayment HA has assessed against her, and to deny her reasonable
accommodation request.  
            The court has read and considered
the moving papers, opposition, and reply, and renders the following tentative
decision.
 
            A. Statement of the Case
            1. Petition
            Petitioner Smith filed the Petition
for writ of administrative mandamus on November 28, 2022.  The operative pleading is the Second Amended
Petition (“SAP”) filed on April 3, 2023, alleging two causes of action for
administrative mandamus.  The FAP alleges
in pertinent part as follows.
            Smith is a 61-year-old low-income
resident who lives in HA’s jurisdiction and is qualified for Section 8
assistance.  She lives with her
37-year-old daughter (“Jessica”) and Jessica’s 14- and 15-year-old sons.  Smith’s monthly income is $1100, all from SSI
and SSDI.  Since 2019, Jessica has been one
of her two In-Home Supportive Services (“IHSS”) care providers.
            In August 2022, Smith received
notice that HA would terminate her Section 8 voucher for unreported income and as
a repeat offender.  Because Jessica had
failed to report income from a job she had secured in August 2021, HA had
overpaid $16,000 in rental subsidies for her between August 2021 and August
2022.
            The notice asserted that under 24 Code
of Federal Regultations (“C.F.R.”) section 982.552(a)(5), HA must deny or
terminate assistance because of the family’s action or failure to act.  24 C.F.R. section 982.552(a)(5) does not
exist, and the quoted language does not appear in the Section 8 legislation.  The letter also did not inform Smith she had
the right to request a reasonable accommodation.
            Jessica’s work position was remote,
allowing her to work from home.  Until Smith
received the August 2022 notice, she did not know that Jessica had obtained
outside employment.  Smith testified to
that fact during an HA informal hearing on October 27, 2022.  Jessica testified that she had been
overwhelmed by the death of her uncle, her grandfather’s hospitalization and
cancer diagnosis, her mother’s recurring hospitalizations, and her son’s health
issues.
            HA asserted that it had no choice
but to automatically terminate Smith’s benefits because she was already in a
repayment program and HA could not offer her a second one.  This automatic termination is not codified in
HA’s Administrative Plan.  In any case, Smith
had already repaid HA in full under the existing plan.  The panel relied on the HA’s representation
and did not consider mitigating circumstances like Smith’s disability, the
seriousness of case, and the effects termination would have on non-culpable
family members.
            On October 31, 2022, HA terminated Smith’s
Section 8 voucher, effective November 30, because Jessica failed to report all
her income during an annual recertification. 
HA also assessed an overpayment of $16,734 but would not let Smith repay
it.  HA later admitted this assessment
was incorrect and that Smith owed at most $8,082.
            Although the termination was
effective November 30, 2022, HA stopped paying the Section 8 subsidy in
September 2022.  Smith has had to pay her
full unsubsidized rent beginning September 2022.  HA later admitted it should have paid a $757
subsidy per month from September through November 2022.
            On
November 17, 2022, Smith submitted a request for reasonable accommodation.  She claimed that (1) disabilities prevented
her from finding adequate affordable housing without her voucher, (2) only
Jessica was responsible for violations of the Family Obligations, and (3) both
facts are also mitigating circumstances which HA must consider but did not do
so in its decision.  
            On December 2, 2022, HA issued a
denial of the reasonable accommodation request. 
Smith failed to show a connection between her disabilities and the
failure to report her daughter’s full income. 
Allowing Smith to cure her defect just by removing a culpable family
member would set a precedent that would fundamentally alter the nature of the
Section 8 program.  Smith had been
notified of her obligation to report income and not commit fraud.  Yet, fraud was not a reason stated in the
termination notice, and the termination process did not result in a finding of
fraud.
            Smith requested an informal hearing
on the denial of her reasonable accommodation request.  HA held that hearing on December 20, 2022.  On January 3, 2023, the hearing officer
issued a decision affirming the denial of the request.
            Smith seeks a writ of administrative
mandate compelling HA to (1) set aside the decision terminating her voucher and
assessing $16,734 overpayment and reinstate her membership in the Section 8
program; (2) reimburse her for all months that HA did not pay rental assistance
beginning September 2022; (3) set aside the decision denying the reasonable
accommodation request; and (4) pay her attorney’s fees and costs.
 
            2. Course of Proceedings
            On November 30, 2022, the court
denied Smith’s ex parte application to stay Section 8 termination. The
court ordered that, if Smith renews the application or makes a noticed motion
for a stay, she must comply with 1008(b) except for its requirement that she
show due diligence. 
            On January 4, 2023, Smith served HA
with the Petition.
            On January 13, 2023, Respondents
filed the Answer.
            On February 7, 2023, the court
denied Smith’s renewed motion to stay Section 8 termination.
            On February 24, 2023, Smith filed and
served her First Amended Petition.
            On April 6, 2023, Smith filed and
served her SAP.  On April 24, 2023, the
court granted Smith’s unopposed application for leave to do so.      
            
            B. Standard of Review
            CCP section 1094.5 is the
administrative mandamus provision which structures the procedure for judicial
review of adjudicatory decisions rendered by administrative agencies.  Topanga Ass’n for a Scenic Community v.
County of Los Angeles, (“Topanga”) (1974) 11 Cal.3d 506, 514-15.  
            CCP section 1094.5 does not in its
face specify which cases are subject to independent review, leaving that issue
to the courts.  Fukuda v. City of
Angels, (“Fukuda”) (1999) 20 Cal.4th 805, 811.  In cases reviewing decisions which affect a
vested, fundamental right the trial court exercises independent judgment on the
evidence.  Bixby v. Pierno, (1971)
4 Cal.3d 130, 143.  See CCP
§1094.5(c).  In administrative mandamus
actions to review decisions terminating welfare assistance, the trial court
exercises independent judgment on the evidence.  Frink v. Prod, (1982) 31 Cal.3d 166,
171.  
            Under the independent judgment test,
“the trial court not only examines the administrative record for errors of law
but also exercises its independent judgment upon the evidence disclosed in a
limited trial de novo.”  Id. at 143.  The court must draw its own reasonable
inferences from the evidence and make its own credibility determinations.  Morrison v. Housing Authority of the City
of Los Angeles Board of Commissioners, (2003) 107 Cal.App.4th 860,
868.  In short, the court substitutes its
judgment for the agency’s regarding the basic facts of what happened, when,
why, and the credibility of witnesses.  Guymon
v. Board of Accountancy, (1976) 55 Cal.App.3d 1010, 1013-16.
            “In exercising its independent
judgment, a trial court must afford a strong presumption of correctness
concerning the administrative findings, and the party challenging the
administrative decision bears the burden of convincing the court that the
administrative findings are contrary to the weight of the evidence.”  Fukuda, supra, 20 Cal.4th at 817. 
Unless it can be demonstrated by petitioner that the agency’s actions
are not grounded upon any reasonable basis in law or any substantial basis in
fact, the courts should not interfere with the agency’s discretion or
substitute their wisdom for that of the agency. 
Bixby, supra, 4 Cal.3d 130, 150-151; Bank of America v.
State Water Resources Control Board, (1974) 42 Cal.App.3d 198, 208.
            The agency’s decision must be based
on a preponderance of the evidence presented at the hearing.  Board of Medical Quality Assurance v.
Superior Court, (1977) 73 Cal.App.3d 860, 862.  The hearing officer is only required to issue
findings that give enough explanation so that parties may determine whether,
and upon what basis, to review the decision. Topanga, supra, 11
Cal.3d 506, 514-15.  Implicit in CCP section
1094.5 is a requirement that the agency set forth findings to bridge the
analytic gap between the raw evidence and ultimate decision or order.  Id. at 115.
            An agency is presumed to have
regularly performed its official duties (Ev. Code §664), and the petitioner
therefore has the burden of proof.  Steele
v. Los Angeles County Civil Service Commission, (1958) 166 Cal.App.2d 129,
137.  “[T]he burden of proof falls upon
the party attacking the administrative decision to demonstrate wherein the
proceedings were unfair, in excess of jurisdiction or showed prejudicial abuse
of discretion.  Afford v. Pierno,
(1972) 27 Cal.App.3d 682, 691.
 
            C. Governing Law[1]
            1.
Section 8 Law
            The federal government provides rental assistance for low-
and moderate-income families, the elderly, and the disabled through what is
known as “the Section 8 program.”  Congress added the Section 8 program to
the United States Housing Act of 1937 in 1974 by enacting the Housing and
Community Development Act of 1974, Pub.L. No. 93-333, §20 1(a), (codified as amended at 42 U.S.C.
§14370).  The express purpose of the Section 8 program is “aiding
low-income families in obtaining a decent place to live and promoting
economically mixed housing.”  42 U.S.C. §1437f(a).  The program is
managed federally by the United States Department of Housing and Urban
Development (“HUD”) and administered locally by public housing authorities
(“PHA”). 24 C.F.R.
§982.1(a)(1).
            HUD enters into annual contracts with its PHAs and
provides the PHAs funds to subsidize rental payments to private landlords for
eligible tenants.  Administration of Respondents’ program is governed by
24 C.F.R.  PHAs are required to adopt a written administrative plan that
establishes local policies for administration of the program in accordance with
HUD requirements.  24 C.F.R. § 982.54(a)-(b). 
            The PHA may admit only
eligible families to the program.  24 C.F.R. §982.201(a).  To be
eligible, a family must be “income-eligible.”  Id.  Inter alia, to be
income-eligible, the applicant family must be “low-income” and meet additional
eligibility criteria specified in the PHA administrative plan.  24 C.F.R.
§982.201(b)(iii); see also 42 U.S.C. §1437f(o)(4)(C).  The annual
income of an applicant family determines income eligibility.  24 C.F.R.
§982.201(b)(3). 
            Section 8 tenants must sign a lease and pay a portion of
their income toward rent.  The remainder of the rent charge is paid by the
PHA pursuant to a housing assistance payment (“HAP”) contract between the PHA
and the owner, which mandates that a lease “shall be for a term of not less
than [one] year” (42 U.S.C. § 1437f (o)(7XA)), shall “contain terms and
conditions that are consistent with State and local law,” (42 U.S.C.
§1437f(o)(7)(B)(ii)(I)), and “shall provide that during the term of the lease,
the owner shall not terminate the tenancy except for serious or repeated
violation of the terms and conditions of the lease, for violation of applicable
Federal, State, or local law, or for other good cause.”  42 U.S.C.
§1437f(o)(7)(C). 
            The participant’s voucher is portable. The
participant/tenant may choose to live in any property if the landlord agrees to
accept the voucher and comply with the applicable regulations.  The government
subsidy is limited to the difference between the amount the family is required
to contribute and the payment standard established by the PHA based on
fair market rents for the area.  42 U.S.C. §1437f(o)(1)(B), (o)(2)(A)-(B). 
            HUD regulations identify the obligations of each Section
8 participant, referred to as “Family Obligations.”  See 24 C.F.R.
§982.551.  Included in the list of Family Obligations is the requirement
that the family (1) supply any information that the PHA or HUD determines is
necessary in the administration of the program, (2) supply information
requested by the PHA or HUD for use in a
regularly scheduled reexamination or interim reexamination of family income and
composition, (3) ensure all information is true and complete, and (4) not
commit fraud in connection with the program.  24 C.F.R. §982.551(b);
§982.551(k).  Violation of any of the
Family Obligations is grounds for termination of Section 8 benefits.  24 C.F.R.
§982.552(c)(1)(i). 
            Participants are required to report a change of family
composition immediately.  24 C.F.R. §§ 982.516(e), 982.551(h)(2). 
The amount of rental subsidy, which is paid by voucher, is based on the number
of family members who will reside in the rental unit.  Participants are
required to report that a family member has left the household in writing within
30 days of the occurrence.  The failure to do so is a basis to terminate
Section 8 benefits. 
            The government’s rental assistance payment can be
terminated for a variety of reasons.  Among them are repeated violations
of the lease (24 C.F.R. §§ 982.55 1(a), (e), 982.552(a)), failure to provide
information to the PHA (24 C.F.R. §§ 982.551(b), 982.552(a)), and fraud. 
24 C.F.R. §982.552(c)(1)(iv).  “Fraud and abuse” means a single act or
pattern of actions that (1) constitutes false statement, omission, or
concealment of a substantive fact, made with intent to deceive or mislead; and
(2) results in payment of Section 8 funds in violation of program requirements.  24 C.F.R. §792.103.
            A PHA has the authority to deny or terminate admission of
an applicant family if the family violates any Family Obligations pursuant to
24 C.F.R. section 982.551.  24 C.F.R. §982.552(c)(1)(i).  This includes a failure to provide true and complete information
to the PHA.  24 C.F.R. §§ 982.551(b), 982.552(a).  A PHA also
has authority to deny admission if a member of the family has committed fraud
or any other corrupt act in connection with any federal housing program. 
24 C.F.R. §982.552(c)(1)(iv).  
            In determining whether to deny assistance because of
actions by members of the family, the PHA may consider all relevant
circumstances such as the seriousness of the case, the extent of participation
or culpability of individual family members, and the effects of denial or
termination of assistance on other family members who were not involved in the
action or failure.  24 C.F.R. §982.552(c)(2)(i). 
A PHA has a duty to consider whether a reasonable accommodation is required
with regard to a termination decision when the family includes a person with
disabilities.  24 C.F.R.
§982.552(c)(2)(iv).
Families in the
Section 8 program are entitled to an administrative hearing before a PHA may
terminate their assistance.  24 C.F.R.
§982.555(a)(iv).
 
            2.
Administrative Plan
            Under HA’s administrative plan, the
HA shall comply fully with all federal, state, and local non-discrimination
laws, and with rules and regulations governing fair housing and equal
opportunity in housing and employment. 
RJN Ex. 1 (Admin. Plan §2-I.A).
            The Fair Housing Act prohibits the
refusal to make reasonable accommodations in rules, policies, practices, or
services when such accommodations may be necessary to afford a person with a
disability the equal opportunity to use and enjoy a program or dwelling under
the program.  Admin. Plan §2-II.A.  A joint statement between HUD and the
Department of Justice defines a reasonable accommodation as a change,
exception, or adjustment to a rule, policy, practice, or service that may be
necessary for a person with a disability to have an equal opportunity to use
and enjoy a dwelling.  RJN Ex. 2.  The HA must ensure that persons with
disabilities have full access to its programs. 
Admin. Plan §2-II.A.  
            HA is required to terminate family
assistance for certain actions or inactions of the family.  Admin. Plan §12-II.A. For other actions or
inactions of the family, regulations give HA the authority to terminate family
assistance or take other actions.  Id.  
            HA may require that any household
member who participated in or was responsible for an offense no longer resides
in the unit.  Admin. Plan §12-II.C.  The head of household must then certify that
the culpable family member has vacated the unit and will not be permitted to
visit or to stay as a guest in the assisted unit.  Id. 
Upon HA request, the head of household must present evidence of the
former member’s current address.  Id.  
            If a family owes amounts to HA as a
condition of continued assistance, HA will require the family to repay the full
amount or to enter into a repayment agreement within 30 days of receiving
notice from HA of the amount owed.  Id.  
            In any decision to terminate Section
8 assistance, HA will consider the seriousness of the case, especially with
respect to how it would affect other residents’ safety or property, the effects
that termination of assistance may have on other members of the family who were
not involved in the action or failure to act, and the extent of participation
or culpability of individual family members, including whether the culpable
family member is a minor or a person with disabilities.  Admin. Plan §12-II.D.
            In the case of family-caused errors
or program abuse, HA will take into consideration (1) the seriousness of the
offense and the extent of participation or culpability of individual family
members, (2) any special circumstances surrounding the case, (3) any mitigating
circumstances related to the disability of a family member, (4) the effects of
a particular remedy on family members who were not involved in the
offense.  Admin. Plan §14-I.C.
            In the case of family-caused errors
or program abuse, the family will be required to repay any excess subsidy
received.  Admin. Plan §14-II.B.  HA may, but is not required to, offer the
family a repayment agreement.  Id.  If the family fails to repay the excess
subsidy, HA will terminate the family’s assistance.  Id. 
HA generally will not enter a repayment agreement with a family if there
is already a repayment agreement in place with the family or if the amount owed
by the family exceeds $2,000.  Admin.
Plan §16.IV.B.
            Program participants may not make false
statements to HA or commit fraud, bribery, or any other corrupt or criminal act
in connection with the program.  Admin.
Plan §14-II.B.  HA will consider evidence
of family program abuse, including intentional misreporting of family
information or circumstances like income, and omission of facts that were
obviously known by a family member.  Id.  HA may determine other actions to be program
abuse based upon a preponderance of the evidence, as defined elsewhere in the
administrative plans.  Id.
 
            C. Statement of Facts
            1. Background
            Smith is 62 years old and has
several disabilities.  AR 785.  She has received Section 8 rental assistance
since 1995 and was first admitted to HA’s Section 8 program in 2001.  AR 1, 785. 
She has reported all her income and previously complied with HA Family
Obligations and Section 8 program requirements. 
AR 785.  
            Smith lives with her 37-year-old
daughter Jessica and Jessica’s two sons, aged 14 and 15.  AR 785. 
Smith has two IHSS workers, one of whom is Jessica.  AR 785. 

            Smith’s sole income is $1,100 per
month from SSDI and SSI.  AR 785.  Her rent is $2,035 per month, $448 of which
she paid while her Section 8 voucher was active.  AR 785. 
She cannot afford the full rent if HA terminates her assistance, and the
landlord will evict her.  AR 785.  She does not have any family to move in with
and believes that she would be homeless upon eviction.  AR 785. 
            Because of her worsening condition, Smith
has relied on Jessica since at least 2018 to fill out the annual Section 8
recertification paperwork as one of her IHSS workers.  AR 785. 

 
            2. Prior Violation
            During a November 1, 2020 annual
recertification appointment, the HA discovered Jessica was receiving income as Smith’s
IHSS provider.  AR 2, 65.  Because her start date with IHSS was January
1, 2019, she should have reported this income by January 10, 2019.  AR 2.  Based
on this income, HA calculated that its excess assistance payments to Smith totaled
$2,830.  AR 2.
            On February 9, 2021, HA sent Smith a
proposed termination letter based on the family’s failure to report Jessica’s
income from IHSS.  On March 30, 2021, HA
and Smith entered into a repayment plan. 
AR 2, 65, 414.  As part of this, Smith
signed a Counseling Acknowledgment form reiterating her family’s
responsibilities under the Section 8 program. 
AR 2, 416-17.  Smith acknowledged
that she underwent counseling because of noncompliance with family obligations,
including the duty to (1) report income changes in writing within ten days of
the occurrence and (2) not commit fraud in connection with the program.  AR 416. 
Smith stated that she understood that further violations of family
obligations would result in a recommendation for her termination.  AR 417.
            Smith completed the repayment plan,
making the last payment on January 28, 2022. 
AR 766-68.  On February 7, 2022, a
City staff assistant emailed notice of Smith’s repayment to various HA employees,
including Isabel Soto (“Soto”).  AR 766.
 
            3.
The August 16, 2021 Personal Declaration
            On August 16, 2021, Smith and
Jessica filed a personal declaration for HA rental assistance benefits.  AR 443-50. 
Jessica’s listed income only included income from IHSS.  AR 444. 
Smith and Jessica both signed the declaration under penalty of perjury.  AR 450.
            
4. HA’s Discovery of Jessica’s Molina Income
In June 2022, Smith’s landlord requested a Section 8 rent
increase from HA, effective August 2022.  AR 590-97. 
HA conducted an Electronic Income Verification (“EIV”) for Smith’s
household.  AR 2, 25-30.  In the resulting EIV report, entries for the
last two quarters of 2021 showed income of $4,174 and $9,693 from Molina
Healthcare Inc. (“Molina”).  AR 34. 
AR 27.  
            On June 16, 2022, HA sent Molina a
Request for Verification to verify Jessica’s income.  AR 34. 
In its June 29, 2022 response, Molina listed Jessica’s start date as
August 2, 2021.  AR 34.  Jessica’s base pay for the last 12 months was
$35,880 in 2021 and $36,777 in 2022.  AR
34.  Her overtime pay for the last 12
months was $40.63 in 2021 and $97.17 from the beginning of 2022 to date.  AR 34.
 
            5. The Proposed Termination
            On August 3, 2022, HA sent Smith a letter
that proposed termination of her Section 8 voucher.  AR 36. 
It explained that Family Obligations include duties to (1) report earned
and unearned income from all sources; (2) report all income changes within ten
days of the occurrence; and (3) not commit any fraud in connection with the
Section 8 program.  AR 36.  Among other applicable provisions, HA stated
that 24 C.F.R. section 982.552(a)(5) requires a PHA to terminate assistance
because of the family’s action or failure to act.  AR 37.
            HA alleged that Smith failed to
report Jessica’s income from Molina.  AR
37.  HA learned about this income only because
(1) the EIV system detected it, and (2) Smith’s housing specialist discovered
it while processing the landlord’s rent increase request.  AR 37. 
HA sent a third-party verification form to Molina, which verified
Jessica’s income.  AR 37.  HA calculated that it had made excess payments
totaling $16,734 based on the unreported income.  AR 3, 37. 

            HA’s letter stated that it was
proposing to terminate Smith’s participation in the Section 8 program.  AR 37-38. 
Smith was not eligible to enter into a repayment agreement because she previously
entered into such an agreement for failure to report income.  AR 37. 
HA stated that it would terminate Smith from Section 8 in 30 days unless
she requested an informal hearing or appointment to address the allegations
within ten days.  AR 37-38.  If HA terminated her participation, Smith
would be liable for the full contract rent of her home.  AR 38. 
In addition, HA has a policy of recuperating excess payments made due to
fraudulent participant behavior.  AR 38.
 
            6. The August 6, 2022 Personal
Declaration
            On August 6, 2022, Smith and Jessica
filed a personal declaration for HA rental assistance benefits.  AR 12, 19. 
Like the 2021 declaration, Jessica’s listed income only included income
from IHSS, and did not include the income from Molina.  AR 13.  They admitted that a household member received
a W-2 or 1099 income form in the last 12 months but did not file a tax return
because the member “did not make enough to file” a tax return.  AR 14. 
Smith and Jessica signed the declaration under penalty of perjury.  AR 19.
 
            7. The August 17, 2022 Meeting
            On August 15, 2022, Smith requested
in writing an appointment to discuss the termination.  AR 40. 
This meeting occurred on August 17, 2022, where Smith and Jessica
asserted that Jessica does not work for Molina. 
AR 43, 650.  Jessica also provided
a police report alleging identity theft. 
AR 43, 650.  Smith stated that
Jessica could not possibly work for Molina when she was home with Smith every
day.  3, 42-43, 650.  
 
            5. The Termination Letter
            On August 17, 2022, HA informed
Molina via email of Jessica’s allegations of identity theft.  AR 45-46. 
HA attached a copy of Jessica’s driver’s license and asked Molina to
confirm that she was the woman hired.  AR
45-46.  On August 23, Molina confirmed
that the driver’s license it had on file for Jessica had the same photo and information
as HA’s copy.  AR 48-49.
On August 24, 2022, HA gave Smith notice of her Section 8 voucher’s
termination, effective September 30, 2022. 
AR 6.  The stated reason for
proposed termination was “Inaction by Family (Unreported Income and Repeat
Offender).”  AR 7.  Among other applicable provisions, HA stated
that 24 C.F.R. section 982.552(a)(5) requires a PHA to terminate assistance
because of the family’s action or failure to act.  AR 7.
            The termination letter noted that Smith
had signed acknowledgements that household members must report all income from
all sources, report any changes in such income within ten days of its
occurrence, and provide any information HA determines necessary in the
administration of the program.  AR 6-7.  The acknowledgments also stated that household
members must not commit fraud in connection with the program.  AR 7.
            The termination letter noted Smith’s
previous failure to report Jessica’s IHSS employment income after it began on
January 1, 2019.  AR 7-8.  HA and Smith entered into a repayment program
for excess benefits paid as a result.  AR
8.  
            In June 2022, Smith’s landlord
requested a rent increase.  AR 8.  The subsequent EIV report revealed Jessica’s
income from Molina, which Smith had again failed to timely report.  AR 8. 
Molina provided verification of Jessica’s employment starting on August 8,
2021.  AR 8.  Jessica’s unreported earnings from Molina totaled
$35,920.63 for 2021 and $36,874.17 through June 29, 2022.  AR 8.
            Smith and Jessica then submitted a
false police report asserting that Jessica was a victim of identity theft.  AR 8.  Smith
told HA it was impossible for Jessica to work for Molina because she was home
with Smith every day.  AR 8.
            The termination letter stated that HA
had made excess payments totaling $16,734. 
AR 8.  It stated that Smith was
not eligible to enter into a repayment agreement because she previously had entered
into an overpayment agreement.  AR
8-9.  Smith had the right to request an
informal hearing within ten days of the termination letter, or by September 3,
2022.  AR 9.  
 
            6. The Informal Hearing
            Smith requested an informal
hearing.  AR 165.  On August 30, 2022, HA acknowledged Smith’s
request and sent her information about informal hearing procedures.  AR 165, 167-74.  The procedures informed Smith that she and
her family would have the right to present oral and written evidence.  AR 172. 
She could also submit a written request for a reasonable accommodation,
with a deadline ten business days before the hearing.  AR 174.
            On October 27, 2022, HA’s Advisory
Commission (“Commission”) held the informal hearing.  AR 1, 69. 
Assistant Housing Manager Soto and HA Housing Specialist Tysharee Glover
(“Glover”) appeared at the hearing and recommended termination.  AR 79. 
Pertinent witness testimony[2]
is as follows.
 
            a. Tysharee Glover
Glover stated that HA recommended Smith’s termination because
she routinely failed to timely report all household income from all
sources.  AR 69.  She also failed to supply information HA had
determined necessary to administer the program, and to ensure such information
was true and complete.  AR 69.  Household members also must not commit any
fraud in connection with the Section 8 housing program.  AR 69-70.
            Smith’s previous failure to report
Jessica’s income had resulted in a proposed termination on February 9,
2021.  AR 71.  Smith failed to report Jessica’s IHSS
employment, which was discovered during the November 2020 annual
recertification.  AR 71.  The result was excess HA payments of
$2,830.  AR 71.  Smith was making the required payments under
the repayment plan.  AR 81.
            In the present case, Jessica did not
report her income from Molina during the household’s November 2021 annual
recertification or the 2022 annual recertification.  AR 70. 
HA learned about it through the EIV system during the processing of a
rent increase request.  AR 70.  Molina’s third-party verification listed Jessica’s
hire date as August 2, 2021 and her earnings as totaling $35,920.63 in 2021 and
$36,874.17 in 2022 through June 29, 2022. 
AR 72.  Upon inquiry from
Commissioner Riley, Glover verified that both amounts were not reported.  AR 72.
            When Jessica and Smith met with Glover
on August 17, 2022, Jessica denied ever working for Molina.  AR 72. 
Smith added that it was impossible for Jessica to work for Molina because
she was home with Smith every day.  AR
72.  Smith and Jessica provided a police
report alleging identity theft.  AR
72.  Jessica had filed this false police report
after receiving HA’s proposed termination without looking into the matter or contacting
her employer to learn what was going on. 
AR 78.  Jessica just filed the
report to convince HA to rescind the termination or dismiss the overpayment.  AR 78.
            Glover sent Molina a copy of
Jessica’s driver’s license and confirmed her employment.  AR 72-73. 
HA decided to proceed with termination. 
AR 73.  Because Smith had entered
a repayment agreement in March 2021, the termination letter asserted that she was
ineligible for a second repayment agreement for the $16,734 overpayment.  AR 73, 79-80. 

            Participants are oriented to the
Section 8 program upon admittance and read the Family Obligations.  AR 73. 
Both Smith and Jessica had recently signed and submitted the form
acknowledging that they had read and understood the rules.  AR 74. 
The household had knowingly failed to report income for all household
members on two separate occasions, had been counseled in entering into the
repayment program for failure to report income, and filed a false police report
after receiving the proposed termination. 
AR 74.  HA cannot continue to
assist Smith as she has failed to comply on two separate occasions.  AR 74. 
She is not eligible for a repayment agreement and has a housing
assistance overpayment of $16,734.   AR
74.  HA usually appears before the
Commission to hear if anything can be done to rescind the termination, but this
time termination was automatic.  AR 80.[3]
 
            b. Smith
            Smith stated that, when she received
the proposed termination, she did not know what was going on.  AR 75. 
She called Soto and indicated that she had corrected the previous matter
with Jessica.  AR 75.  Glover called Smith and she got an appointment.  AR 76. 
Smith told Glover that she had no clue what this was all about because Jessica
had been with Smith every day as her in-home caregiver.  AR 76.
 
            c. Jessica
            Jessica stated that, although she now
knows that she works for Molina, she did not know that when she met with Glover.  AR 77. 
A friend had given her a phone number to a recruiter, who then directed
her to the open position.  AR 77.  The friend worked for LA Care, so Jessica
thought she was placed with LA Care.  AR
77.  Jessica submitted the police report
because she did not know that she was working for Molina.  AR 77.
            Although Jessica thought she was
working for LA Care, she admitted that she never reported the income she
earned.  AR 77.  She was mentally occupied with the COVID-19 pandemic,
her uncle dying, her grandfather being hospitalized for COVID-19, the same
grandfather learning that he has cancer, Jessica’s son fracturing his knee, and
Smith going in and out of the hospital. 
AR 77.  She became overwhelmed and
forgot.  AR 77.
            Jessica had been a victim of
identity theft before.  AR 78.  When Glover told her that records indicated
she worked for Molina, Jessica reacted right away and filed a police
report.  AR 78.  She later contacted Molina and discovered it
was her employer.  AR 78.  
            Jessica’s IHSS employment is
separate from her Molina employment.  AR
78.  She has not filed taxes based solely
on her IHSS income, but she did file a tax return based on her Molina
income.  AR 79.
            Jessica accepts responsibility for
her actions and does not want to see her mother lose her voucher because of
what she did.  AR 81.
            
            d. Commission Colloquy
            During the hearing, Commissioner
Riley opined that both the Commission and HA saw this as “a recent consistent
negligence” of the rules and failure to report income.  AR 80. 
The Commission understood that “things come up” but that does not
explain the false police report.  AR
80.  HA gave Smith a repayment program
the first time and when “you guys were making more income, you still didn’t pay
the amount that was owed.”  AR 81.  When Commissioner Riley inquired whether the
repayment program had not been paid, both Smith and Glover stated that payments
were being made.  AR 81.  Glover added that “they’re just not eligible
for a second – repayment.”  AR 81.
Commission Childress inquired of Smith and Jessica if there
was anything they could add because “the only option we have right now is to
rescind if we have absolutely no grounds.” 
AR 81.  Nothing has been said or
shown to help you to get a retention [of Section 8 benefits].  AR 81.
            The Commission concluded that based
on the options currently in its purview, it had no choice but to revoke Smith’s
Section 8 voucher.  AR 82.  When Smith pled for reconsideration,
Commissioner Riley stated that HA had offered repayment once before and could
not do so again because the first repayment agreement was still active.  AR 82-83.
 
            7. The Commission’s Decision
            On October 31, 2022, the Commission
issued a decision affirming the termination letter effective November 30, 2022.  AR 64-66.
            Jessica failed to report her IHSS
income when she began work on January 1, 2019. 
AR 65.  HA only discovered this
through the EIV system during the November 1, 2020 annual reclassification
appointment.  AR 65.  The excess HA payments totaled $2,830, and Smith
entered a repayment plan for this amount on March 30, 2021.  AR 65.
            HA did not discover Jessica’s
employment and income from Molina until it generated an EIV after the landlord
requested a rent increase on June 13, 2022. 
AR 65.  The EIV system did not
show the hire date, but Molina’s third-party verification gave a hire date of
August 2, 2021.  AR 65.  Jessica failed to report her new employment
within ten days of its commencement.  AR
65.  
            At the meeting after the proposed termination,
Jessica denied that she worked for Molina and did not disclose that she worked
for anyone else.  AR 65.  Molina subsequently confirmed that Jessica
works for it.  AR 65.
At the hearing, Jessica explained that she was hired via LA
Healthcare and did not know she was working for Molina, a different
company.  AR 65.  This second violation caused HA to overpay by
$16,734.  AR 65.  Because Smith had entered into a repayment
agreement before, she was not eligible for another.  AR 66. 
The panel found Smith in violation of the family obligations and
terminated her from the Section 8 program, effective November 30, 2022.  AR 66.
 
            8. The Reasonable Accommodation
Request
            On November 7, 2022, Smith and
Jessica requested an appeal of the Commission’s decision.  AR 67. 
Because of the severe impact of losing her Section 8 voucher, Smith asked
for a chance to further discuss the extenuating circumstances that caused her
failure to report her household’s income. 
AR 67.
On November 17, 2022, Smith’s counsel submitted another
written request for HA to reinstate her Section 8 voucher.  AR 84. 
One of the reasons was a request for reasonable accommodation based on Smith’s
several disabilities and her inability to find additional housing without a
voucher.  AR 84.  Because of her disabilities, her only source
of income was $1100 of monthly SSI.  AR
84.  She could not afford a one-bedroom
rental unit while having enough funds to pay for food and other necessities.  AR 84. 
This would worsen her disabilities and physical health.  AR 84. 
Restoring the voucher would not impose an undue burden on HA.  AR 84.
            Smith noted that she is not the person
who violated family obligations.  AR
85.  Jessica did.  AR 85.  Civil Code section 3520 prohibits causing one person
to suffer from the acts of another.  AR
85.  
            Smith asserted that HA failed to
consider mitigating circumstances, including her disabilities and that she did
not violate any family obligations herself. 
AR 85.  If permitted, Smith would
agree to repay the overpaid rent subsidy on a reasonable installment plan or to
remove her daughter from the voucher.  AR
85.  
Smith argued that HA also failed to subsidize Smith’s rent
for September 2022 until the termination date of December 1, 2022.  AR 85.
 
9. The Denial
            On December 2, 2022, HA notified Smith
of its denial of her reasonable accommodation request.  AR 86. 
HA explained that it can only grant an accommodation when the need is
related to a person’s disability and the accommodation is reasonable.  AR 86. 
An accommodation is not reasonable if it would (1) impose an undue
financial or administrative burden or (2) fundamentally alter the nature of HA
operations, including the obligation to comply with HUD requirements and
regulations.  AR 86-87.  
            Smith has a history of violating
Family Obligations for failure to report income.  AR 89. 
HA denied a reasonable accommodation to reinstate Smith’s Section 8 voucher
because (a) Smith knew her reporting responsibility and yet signed multiple
false certifications about income despite knowing her reporting responsibility,
(b) her accommodation request failed to show that her failure to report income
had any nexus with her disability, and (c) granting an accommodation to
reinstate her Section 8 benefits on the grounds that she is disabled does not
meet the definition of reasonable accommodation and would set a precedent that
fundamentally alters the Section 8 program. 
AR 90.  Anytime HA identified
fraud in a household, the household could then just remove the culpable member
and avoid termination.  AR 90.  
In case of family-caused errors or program abuses, the family
will be required to repay the excess benefits, but HA is not required to offer
a repayment agreement.  AR 91.   
 
            9. The Appeal of the
Reasonable Accommodation Denial
            The reasonable accommodation denial
included notice of Smith’s right to request an informal hearing within ten
business days.  AR 91.  Smith submitted that request on December 6,
2022.  AR 92.  On December 12, 2022, HA gave notice of the informal
hearing scheduled for December 20, 2022. 
AR 93.
            After the hearing, the hearing
officer issued a decision on January 3, 2023 affirming the denial.  AR 110-11. 
None of the “several ailments and health conditions” Smith’s counsel
mentioned demonstrated a connection with the requested accommodation of a
reversal of the Section 8 program termination. 
AR 110.  HA’s representative illustrated
both the standard for granting a reasonable accommodation and the grounds for
the reasonable accommodation denial.  AR
111.
            The hearing officer found that Smith
failed to establish a connection or causal nexus between her disability and her
failure to report income in connection with the Section 8 program.  AR 111. 
HA had followed policies and procedures when it issued the denial.  AR 111. Granting a reasonable accommodation on
the basis of disability without a connection to the behavior shown would
fundamentally alter the nature of the reasonable accommodation process.  AR 111.
 
            10. Post-Decision
Communications
            On February 16, 2023, Smith
requested that HA recalculate the excess Section 8 benefits paid in 2021 and
2022.  AR 679.  When HA had calculated the overpayment as $16,734,
it assumed Jessica had earned $35,920.63 for 2021 and $36,874.17 for 2022
through June 29.  AR 8, 679.  However, those numbers are incorrect.  AR 679. 
Documents show that Smith’s base salary was $35,880 in 2021 and $36,777 in
2022.  AR 34, 679.  Yet, HA did not prorate these base salaries to
reflect Jessica’s 2021 start date of August 2, 2021 or the portion of the 2022
base salary paid as of June 29, 2022.  AR
679.
            On February 28, 2023, HA explained
that Jessica previously asserted that she never worked for Molina and Smith never
disputed the HA’s earnings calculations. 
AR 668.  Now that Smith had done so,
HA had asked Molina to provide Jessica’s W-2’s for 2021 and 2022.  AR 668-69. 
These documents listed Jessica’s gross earnings from Molina as $31,043.93
in 2022 and $13,922.94 in 2021.  AR 669.  The total unreported income was therefore $44,966.87.  AR 669. 
Based on this unreported income, the revised gross overpayment was $10,383.  AR 669. 

HA also acknowledged that it failed to pay the Housing
Assistance Payment of $757 for September, October, and November 2022, a total
of $2,301.  AR 669.  Smith therefore only needed to repay $10,383 -
$2,301 = $8,082.  AR 669.
            On March 22, 2023, HA forwarded Smith
a February 2022 email confirming that she had fully paid all amounts owed under
the March 30, 2021 repayment plan.  AR 765-66.
            
            11. Motion to Stay
            After filing the Petition in this
action, Smith moved for a stay of her Section 8 program termination.  In support of this motion, she filed
declarations from herself, Jessica, and Steinback.  RJN Exs. 3-6. 
Pertinent assertions are as follows.
            Smith is 62 years old and has
several disabilities.  Smith Decl.,
¶2.  She has received Section 8 federal
rental assistance since 1995 and was first admitted to the HA’s Section 8
program in 2001.  Smith Decl., ¶2.  Her disabilities include sciatica, back pain
down her legs, arthritis, asthma, and hypertension.  Smith Reply Decl., ¶2.  She has reported all her income and has
always complied with HA Family Obligations and program requirements.  Smith Decl., ¶5.  
            Smith lives with her 37-year-old
daughter Jessica and Jessica’s two sons, aged 14 and 15.  Smith Decl., ¶2.  Smith has two IHSS workers, one of whom is
Jessica.  Smith Decl., ¶2.  
            Smith’s sole income is $1100 per
month from SSDI and SSI.  AR 785; Smith
Decl., ¶2.  Her rent is $2,035 per month,
$448 of which she paid while her Section 8 voucher was active.  Smith Decl., ¶3.  She cannot afford the full rent if HA
terminates her assistance, and the landlord will evict her.  Smith Decl., ¶3.  She does not have any family to move in with
and believes that she would be homeless upon eviction.  Smith Decl., ¶3. 
            Because of her worsening condition, Smith
has relied on Jessica since at least 2018 to fill out the annual Section 8
recertification paperwork as one of her IHSS workers.  Smith Decl., ¶4; Smith Reply Decl., ¶¶ 3-4;
Jessica Decl., ¶3.  
            When Jessica first started work as
an IHSS provider, she did not know that she needed to report that income
because she thought the money came from the government.  Jessica Decl., ¶4.  Once she learned otherwise, Smith and Jessica
agreed to a repayment plan.  Jessica
Decl., ¶4.
            In April and May 2021, Jessica
submitted reports about changes to her IHSS work hours and her temporary
disability status.  Jessica Decl.,
¶5.  Later that year, a LA Healthcare
employee recruited her to her new job. 
Jessica Decl., ¶6.  Jessica
therefore assumed that she was working for LA Healthcare, but she later learned
that her employer was Molina.  Jessica
Decl., ¶6.  This confusion meanwhile led
her to file a police report because she thought her identity was stolen.  Jessica Decl., ¶9.
            Jessica works as a Molina Customer
Service Agent from home 40 hours a week for $17.68 per hour.  Jessica Decl., ¶6.  Her pay stub shows that as of December 17,
2022, her year-to-date gross wages totaled $31,020.40, and net payment totaled
$26,740.02.  Jessica Decl., ¶7.  She only failed to report this income because
she was overwhelmed with family responsibilities.  Jessica Decl., ¶8.
            Jessica has space within the home to
manage her own life.  Smith Reply Decl.,
¶6.  Until the termination letter, Smith
did not know that Jessica was employed and had unreported income, and she did
not notice changes to Jessica’s routine or schedule.  Smith Reply Decl., ¶5.  When HA asked Smith if Jessica was employed
other than as her IHSS, Smith answered “No” because she had no information to
the contrary.  Smith Reply Decl.,
¶5.  She never intended to misrepresent
Jessica’s employment or withhold information from HA.  Smith Reply Decl., ¶9.  
            Smith trusted Jessica to complete
recertification forms correctly so that she could sign off on them
afterwards.  Smith Reply Decl., ¶4.  Smith does not know why Jessica failed to
report her own income on the forms.  Smith
Decl., ¶4.  No one disputes that Smith
fulfilled her duty to report her own income. 
Smith Decl., ¶5.
            HUD sets income limits for the
Section 8 voucher program based on geographic location.  Steinback Decl., ¶4.  For a four-person family in Los Angeles in 2022,
HUD defined the “30% limits” income threshold as $35,750 and “Very Low Income”
as $59,550.  Steinback Decl., ¶4, Ex. C.
 
            E. Analysis
            Petitioner Smith seeks to set aside HA’s
decision to terminate her from the Section 8 program.
 
1. The Termination of Smith’s Section 8 Assistance Was
Not Excessive
A court may grant a petition for a writ of mandate to set
aside an administrative decision by a public agency that is “excessive and
disproportionate to [the] alleged wrong.” Crooks v. Housing Auth. of City of
Los Angeles, (“Crooks”) (2019) 40 Cal.App.5th 893, 910.  
Smith argues that HA invoked the most severe punitive action
it could take against her in response to a violation of family obligations by her
daughter, and only her daughter.  Smith,
a then-61-year old woman with disabilities, did not engage in any misconduct,
and did not know that her daughter had done anything improper.  Even if HA did wish to punish Ms. Smith in
some way for her daughter’s behavior, it had a panoply of options available.
Termination of her housing assistance was excessive.  Pet. Op. Br. at 15; Reply at 5.
Smith is wrong because the record fully supports the
termination of her assistance.  Smith had
a previous failure to report Jessica’s IHSS income beginning January 1,
2019.  AR 65.  HA only discovered this through the EIV
system during a November 1, 2020 annual reclassification appointment.  AR 65. 
HA sent Smith a proposed termination letter on February 9, 2021 and, in
lieu of termination, HA and Smith entered into a repayment plan on March 30,
2021.  AR 2, 65, 414.  As part of this plan, Smith signed a
Counseling Acknowledgment form reiterating her family’s responsibilities under
the Section 8 program.  AR 2,
416-17.  In her acknowledgement, Smith
stated that she understood that further violations of family obligations would
result in a recommendation for her termination. 
AR 417.  Smith completed the
repayment plan, making the last payment on January 28, 2022.  AR 766-68. 
            Given this violation, Smith should
have had a heightened awareness of her obligations.  Yet, she failed to report Jessica’s income
from Molina that began in August 2021. 
AR 34.  Smith and Jessica
submitted declarations dated August 16, 2021 and August 6, 2022 that failed to
list Jessica’s income.  This failure
occurred while Smith was performing the repayment plan.  HA did not discover Jessica’s Molina income
until it generated an EIV after the landlord requested a rent increase on June
13, 2022.  AR 65.  
Not only did Smith fail to report Jessica’s income, she
either lied or dissembled at the August 17, 2022 meeting.  At the meeting, Jessica denied that she
worked for Molina.  Smith also asserted
that Jessica did not work for Molina.  AR
43, 650.  Jessica also provided a police
report alleging identity theft.  AR 43,
650.  Smith stated that Jessica could not
possibly work for Molina when she was home with Smith every day.  3, 42-43, 650.  Jessica did not disclose that she worked for
any entity.  AR 65.    
Jessica subsequently admitted at the Commission hearing that
her statements were false.  She claimed
that she was hired via LA Healthcare and did not know she was working for
Molina, a different company (AR 65) but had no explanation why she did not
report the income from her employer.[4]
In arguing that the penalty is excessive, Smith fails to
address the false statements made by herself and her daughter about Jessica’s
employment.  It is almost inconceivable
that Smith did not know that her live-in daughter and caregiver was working
remotely from home at a new job.  HA’s
finding is fully supported that Smith violated her obligations to report true
and complete information about family income from 2021-2022 and that
termination of her Section 8 benefits is appropriate.
 
2. Smith’s Reasonable Accommodation Claim Fails
Smith argues that she is disabled, is guaranteed special
protections under federal and state law to ensure that she is not improperly or
discriminatorily denied equal access to public assistance, and HA failed to
provide her with those protections.
The federal Fair Housing Amendments Act and the state Fair
Employment and Housing Act and Unrue Act require housing providers to provide notice
of reasonable accommodations to persons with disabilities where necessary to
provide them with equal opportunity to use and enjoy housing.  42 U.S.C. §3604; Govt. Code §§ 12927, 12955;
Civil Code §54.1(b)(1), (b)(3)(B).   A “reasonable accommodation” is a change,
exception, or adjustment to a rule, policy, practice, or service that may be
necessary for a person with a disability to have an equal opportunity to use
and enjoy a dwelling.  Joint Statement of
the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Department of Justice, Reasonable
Accommodations Under the Fair Housing Act (2004).  Accommodations are required so long as they
are reasonable, meaning that they do not create an undue financial or
administrative burden on the housing provider and/or a fundamental alteration
in the nature of the program.  Giebeler
v. M&B Associates, (9th Cir. 2003) 343 F.3d 1143, 1147 (citation
omitted).  Pet. Op. Br. at 13.
State and federal law require a PHA to provide written
notification to Section 8 participants that they have the right to request a
reasonable accommodation as a disabled person.  See 24 C.F.R. §§ 8.20, 8.28.  HA’s Administrative Plan states: 
 
“The PHA will ask all applicants and
participants if they require any type of accommodations, in writing, on the
intake application, reexamination documents, and notices of adverse action
by the PHA, by including the following language: ‘If you or anyone in your family is a person
with disabilities, and you require a specific accommodation in order to fully utilize our programs and
services, please contact the
housing authority.’”
(emphasis added).  Admin. Plan, §2-II.A.
 
            Smith argues
that HA violated her a reasonable accommodation in different ways.  First, HA violated the law and its own policy
by failing to notify Smith that she had the right to a reasonable accommodation
in its August 3, 2022 termination letter to Smith.  As a result, Smith was not able to avail
herself of this right during her termination process – when her disability
could have been discussed, an accommodation could have been considered, and the
termination could have been prevented.  Instead,
Smith discovered this right when she sought legal assistance after her Section
8 assistance was terminated.  At that
juncture, it was too late, practically speaking.  Pet. Op. Br. at 13-14.
            Second, federal
law requires that a PHA decision to terminate assistance for a violation of a
family obligation be subject to consideration of reasonable accommodation if
the family includes a person with disabilities.  24 C.F.R. § 982.552(c)(2)(iv). HA did not
consider Smith’s disability during the termination hearing.  Pet. Op. Br. at 12.
            Third, HA failed
to engage in the interactive process and consider rule, policy, and practice
changes that would have given Smith equal access as an individual with
disabilities to keep her subsidy.  This duty to accommodate is not limited to a single
effort by the housing provider but is an interactive process wherein the PHA
and participant engage in a dialogue regarding the needed accommodation.
 There were several accommodations that
HA could have granted to achieve this aim, including (i) allowing Smith to
enter into a repayment agreement, and (ii) allowing Jessica to leave the
household. Federal law explicitly endorses both options as permissible
accommodations.  24 C.F.R.
§982.552(c)(2)(ii).  HA did not discuss
any accommodations that would have allowed Smith to keep her Section 8
voucher.  Pet. Op. Br. at 14.
            Fourth, HA’s written denial of Smith’s
reasonable accommodation implies partly that the denial was due to fraud – a
finding that was never made during the termination process or hearing.  Fraud
requires a finding that a person knowingly and willfully made false statements.
18 USC §1001.  Smith did not have any
knowledge of her daughter’s unreported income, and as such, she had no intent
to conceal it.  Smith Decl., ¶4; Suppl.
Smith Decl., ¶5. She
delegated the re-certification process to her daughter, her caregiver, which
she had done for several years, and she signed the forms with the reasonable
assumption that her daughter would appropriately report all income.  Suppl. Smith Decl., ¶4.  Pet. Op. Br. at 14.
            Fifth and finally,
HA’s failure to record the hearing on the denial of Smith’s reasonable
accommodation request precludes the court from conducting an independent
judicial review of the proceeding.  Pet.
Op. Br. at 14-15.
            These issues
are mostly moot.  Smith is correct that
HA violated the law and its own policy because its August 3, 2022 termination
letter did not inform her of her right to reasonable accommodation.  Nor did HA engage in the interactive process
with Smith.  These issues are mooted by
the fact that HA addressed Smith’s subsequent reasonable accommodation request
and she received a reasonable accommodation hearing on December 20, 2022.  If she was entitled to reasonable
accommodation, there is no reason it would not have been granted at the
hearing.  She was not.
On December 2, 2022, HA notified Smith that her request for reasonable
accommodation was denied.  AR 86.  HA explained that it can only grant
accommodation when the need is related to a person’s disability and the
accommodation is reasonable.  AR 86.  Accommodation is not reasonable if it would
(1) impose an undue financial or administrative burden or (2) fundamentally
alter the nature of HA operations, including the obligation to comply with HUD
requirements and regulations.  AR 86-87.  
            HA denied Smith’s request for reasonable
accommodation to reinstate her Section 8 voucher because (a) Smith knew her
reporting responsibility and yet signed multiple false certifications about income
despite knowing her reporting responsibility, (b) her accommodation request
failed to show that her failure to report income had any nexus with her
disability, and (c) granting an accommodation to reinstate her Section 8
benefits on the grounds that she is disabled does not meet the definition of
reasonable accommodation and would set a precedent that fundamentally alters
the Section 8 program.  AR 90.  Anytime HA identified fraud in a household,
the household could then just remove the culpable member and avoid
termination.  AR 90.  In case of family-caused errors or program
abuses, the family will be required to repay the excess benefits, but HA is not
required to offer a repayment agreement. 
AR 91.
After HA’s denial, Smith and her attorney attended the December
12, 2022 appeal hearing at which Smith had an opportunity to present evidence
of her disabilities and how they related to her misconduct.  See AR 110-11.  She failed to provide documentary evidence as
to the nature or specific details about her disabilities.  Instead, she relied on unsubstantiated
generalities that she has “several disabilities” and “several ailments and
health conditions.”  AR 84-85, 110-11.
The hearing officer’s
January 3, 2023 decision affirmed HA’s denial of Smith’s reasonable
accommodation request.  AR 110-11.  None of the “several ailments and health
conditions” Smith’s counsel mentioned demonstrated a connection with the
requested accommodation, which was a reversal of the Section 8 program termination.  AR 110. 
Smith failed to establish a connection or causal nexus between her
disability and her failure to report income in connection with the Section 8
program.  AR 111.  Granting reasonable accommodation on the
basis of disability without a connection to the behavior shown would
fundamentally alter the nature of the reasonable accommodation process.  AR 111.
The hearing officer’s decision was correct.  Smith never provided any nexus between her
disabilities and her failure to report Jessica’s income as well as her false
statements that Jessica could not possibly have had a job at Molina.  Nor did she provide any medical documentation
of her disabilities and how they affected her misconduct.  Her statement that she delegated her daughter
the task of filling out the application is not a valid excuse.  Smith was the head of household and had an
independent legal obligation to make sure all information provided was true and
correct, an obligation of which she was fully aware.  Smith also fails to address HA’s point that
granting accommodation to reinstate her Section 8 benefits does not meet the
definition of reasonable accommodation and would set a precedent that
fundamentally alters the Section 8 program. 
AR 90.[5] 
In reply, Smith argues that there is no standard that persons
with disabilities must satisfy to get their reasonable accommodation request
granted.  Even when a reasonable
accommodation request is not considered reasonable, the housing authority has a
responsibility to engage in the interactive process.  Joint Statement of the Department of Housing
and Urban Development and the Department of Justice, Reasonable
Accommodations under the Fair Housing Act. May 17, 2004 (p. 7). HA should
have discussed other possibilities for Smith to retain her subsidy without a
fundamental alteration to the IHA's operations and without imposing an undue
financial and administrative burden. 
Reply at 6.  These general
propositions do not aid Smith.  She fails
to identify any nexus between her disabilities and her failure to report income
that would warrant accommodation.  No
further interaction is required in this circumstance. 
 
3. The Commission Failed to Consider the Required Factors
Federal law requires a PHA to affirmatively decide whether to
exercise their discretion to consider relevant circumstances before determining
if a Section 8 recipient’s housing subsidy should be terminated.  Crooks, supra, 40 Cal.App.5th at
910-12. Those relevant circumstances include “the seriousness of the case, the
extent of participation or culpability of individual family members, mitigating
circumstances related to the disability of a family member, and the effects of
denial or termination of assistance on other family members who were not
involved in the action or failure.”  24 C.F.R.
§982.552(c)(2)(i). 
Similarly, HA’s Administrative Plan requires it to consider
the following factors when making a decision to terminate Section 8 assistance:
(i) “The seriousness of the case, especially with
respect to how it would affect other residents’ safety or property”; (ii) “The
effects that termination of assistance may have on other members of the family
who were not involved in the action or failure to act”; and (iii) “The extent
of participation or culpability of individual family members, including whether
the culpable family member is a minor or a person with disabilities . . .”  Admin. Plan, §12-II.D.  HA’s Administrative Plan reiterates those
requirements in its policy governing the remedies that can be imposed in
response to family-caused errors.  Admin.
Plan, §14-I.C.  These considerations are
mandatory, not discretionary.  Admin.
Plan §12-II.D (“The PHA will consider
the following facts and circumstances when making its decision to terminate
assistance”) (emphasis added).  Pet. Op.
Br. at 9.
Smith argues that HA did not consider any of these factors
when it made its decision to terminate her. 
HA’s several letters to Smith regarding termination, as well as the
transcript of the Commission hearing, demonstrate that the entire focus of the
decision to terminate Smith was the failure to report Jessica’s income.  HA did not take into account Smith’s
undisputed lack of culpability, any special circumstances surrounding the case
(Smith had accurately reported her own income for nearly three decades), any
mitigating circumstances related to Smith’s disability, or the effects that
termination would have on her or Jessica’s minor children.  HA failed to follow the dictates of its
Administrative Plan.  Pet. Op. Br. at
9-10; Reply at 4-5.
The court agrees.  In Crooks,
the appellate court affirmed the trial court’s determination that Crooks’
knowingly false statements about her marital status entitled the housing
authority to terminate her from the Section 8 program.  40 Cal.App.5th at 898.  However, there was no indication in the
administrative hearing officer’s decision that he considered the seriousness of
the case and the effects of termination on other family members as required by
24 C.F.R. section 982.552(c)(2)(i).  Id.  While the regulation states that a PHA “may”
consider these factors – meaning that it may consider all, some, or none of
them – there was nothing in the hearing officer’s decision indicating that he
either exercised his discretion to consider 24 C.F.R. section 982.552(c)(2)(i)
or that “he was aware of his discretion to consider those factors and chose not
to do so”.  Id. at 911.  The failure to recognize the authority to
exercise discretion can itself be grounds for reversal.  Id. (citation omitted).  
This case is similar to Crooks.  The Commission did not ever indicate that it
knew it had discretion to consider the relevant circumstances in 24 C.F.R. section
982.552(c)(2)(i) and Admin. Plan, §12-II.D. 
Unlike in Crooks, this consideration is mandatory. Admin. Plan
§12-II.D (“The PHA will consider the
following facts and circumstances when making its decision to terminate
assistance”) (emphasis added).  This is a
failure by the decision-maker to show that it was aware of the duty to evaluate
mandatory factors.
 
4. Smith Was Not Denied Due Process or a Fair Trial on
Some Issues
Smith admits that HA correctly discovered that Jessica
violated her obligation to timely report income she from a job that she started
in August 2021.  Smith argues that
post-decision discoveries show that she did not receive due process and a fair
trial.  Pet. Op. Br. at 10.
Smith argues that HA grossly miscalculated Jessica’s
earnings.  HA determined, and argued to
the Commission, that Jessica earned approximately $36,000 in the last four
months of 2021 and approximately $37,000 in the first half of 2022.  AR 000072. 
Jessica actually earned approximately $13,000 in 2021 and approximately
$18,000 in 2022.  AR 668-69.  The amounts given to the Commission were
materially incorrect.  HA has
acknowledged their inaccuracy and revised them since Smith’s hearing. AR
668-70.  Pet. Op. Br. at 10-11.
Smith fails to acknowledge that the error in calculating
Jessica’s earnings lay with Molina.   On
June 16, 2022, HA sent Molina a Request for Verification to verify Jessica’s
income.  AR 34.  In its June 29, 2022 response, Molina listed
Jessica’s base pay for the last 12 months as $35,880 in 2021 and as $36,777 in
2022.  AR 34.  HA used these numbers when it calculated the
overpayment as $16,734.  AR 8, 679.  However, Molina failed to pro rate Jessica’s
base salaries to reflect Jessica’s 2021 start date of August 2, 2021 or the
portion of the 2022 base salary paid as of June 29, 2022.  AR 679. 
This was Molina’s error.
At the August 17, 2022 meeting Jessica denied ever working
for Molina.  She also never disputed the
HA’s earnings calculations before the Hearing Commission.  See AR 77-78.  Smith offers no explanation why this issue
was not raised at her Commission hearing. 
Presumably, Jessica knew how much she had earned from her Molina
paystubs or tax return.  See AR
79.  When Smith did raise the issue after
the Commission’s decision, HA revised the total unreported income to $44,966.87
and the overpayment to $10,383.  AR 669.  None of these facts denied Smith a fair
hearing.
Smith argues that HA’s Notice of Termination stated that HA is
bound by “Title 24 Code of Federal Regulations (C.F.R.) 982.552: PHA Denial or Termination
of assistance for family (a) Action or inaction by family. (5) The
PHA must deny or terminate assistance because of the family's action or
failure to act.”  AR 7 (emphasis in
original).  Smith describes this as a
wholesale fabrication.  There is no 24 C.F.R.
section 982.552(a)(5) and there is no mandatory PHA duty under 24 C.F.R.
section 982.552 to terminate.  Pet. Op.
Br. at 11.
It is true that a PHA merely has discretion, not a mandatory
duty, to terminate Section 8 assistance for a participant’s failure to provide true and complete information
to the PHA under 24 C.F.R. §982.552(a), and that there is no subdivision (5) to
this regulation.  Yet, Smith fails to
show any prejudice from the Notice of Termination.  She did not assert any confusion or make any
objection to this language at the August 17, 2022 meeting or at her Commission
hearing.  This objection is waived.
 
5. HA’s Erroneous Representations About Policy Denied
Smith Due Process and a Fair Trial
The Commission’s failure to acknowledge its discretion is
aggravated by the misrepresentations made by HA representatives to the
Commission.  
Smith argues that HA misrepresented that HA policy prohibited
participants in an active repayment plan from entering into another repayment
agreement.  Smith’s counsel has obtained
documentary proof that HA knew that Smith had satisfied her repayment plan
obligations on February 7, 2022 and was not in an active repayment plan during
the termination process (August-October 2022). 
AR 765.  Soto possessed this
evidence and yet argued vociferously at the hearing that Smith was in an active
repayment plan.  AR 79-80.  Pet. Op. Br. at 12; Reply at 3-4.
At the Commission hearing, HA Housing Specialist Glover
explained that Smith received a repayment agreement in March 2021.  AR 79. 
Grover stated that, because Smith had entered a repayment agreement in
March 2021, she was ineligible for a second repayment agreement for the $16,734
overpayment.  AR 73-74, 79-80.  
Assistant Housing Manager Soto
added that HA’s policy is that when clients already have a repayment agreement,
we can’t enter into a new one.”  AR
80.  “And we cannot allow them to pay us
in full.  This is an automatic
termination and we just come to the commission to hear, you know, if there’s
anything that we can do to rescind that, but in this situation, we can’t.”  AR 80.
When
Commissioner Riley inquired whether the repayment program had not been paid,
both Smith and Glover stated that payments were being made.  AR 81. 
Glover added that “they’re just not eligible for a second –
repayment.”  AR 81.  
The Commissioners clearly felt they had no discretion.  Commissioner Childress inquired of Smith and
Jessica if there was anything they could add because “the only option we have
right now is to rescind if we have absolutely no grounds.”  AR 81. 
After deliberation, the Commission concluded that based on the options
currently in its purview, it had no choice but to revoke Smith’s Section 8
voucher.  AR 82.  When Smith pled for reconsideration,
Commissioner Riley stated that HA had offered repayment once before and could
not do so again because the first repayment agreement was still active.  AR 82-83.
There are two problems with HA’s representations to the
Commission that its policy does not permit a second repayment agreement and
termination is automatic.  
First, HA points to no written policy to this effect.  HA cannot have a policy without a formal document
(the Administrative Plan) or some other written policy.  The Admin. Plan states only HA’s policy that it
may, but is not required to, offer a repayment plan (Admin. Plan §14-II.B) and
that HA generally will not enter a repayment agreement with a family if there
is already a repayment agreement in place with the family or if the amount owed
by the family exceeds $2,000 (Admin. Plan §16-IV.B).  Neither HA nor the Commission interpreted
this policy to mean that no repayment plan is available if the participant ever
had a repayment agreement, and it may be reasonably interpreted to mean that no
repayment plan is available if the participant has an ongoing repayment
agreement.  The latter is clearly what
the Commissioners understood.  Yet, pursuant
to this interpretation of the policy, Smith had completed her repayment
agreement and was not automatically barred.
Second, the policy that HA generally will not enter a
repayment agreement with a family if there is already a repayment agreement in
place with the family or if the amount owed by the family exceeds $2,000, is
not absolute.  The word “generally” does
not mean “always”.  Even under the
policy, the Commissioners had discretion and were not foreclosed from
considering a new payment plan for Smith. 
Yet, they did not know they had this discretion.
The City argues that the corrected debt owed by Smith is $8,082,
which still exceeds HA’s repayment threshold. Opp. at 8. This may be true, and
the Commission would be within its discretion to conclude that a repayment
program for the new debt is inappropriate. 
But the Commission never had the opportunity to make that determination.  Additionally, Smith points out that her first
repayment agreement was for $2830, which also exceeds the $2000 amount for
which HA generally will not enter into a repayment agreement.  Reply at 4. 
It is not beyond the realm of possible that the Commission would
consider a repayment plan for the $8,082 amount.
 
            F. Conclusion
            The Petition is granted in part.  There is sufficient evidence from which the
Commission could terminate Smith from the Section 8 program.  Smith was not denied a fair trial on some issues,
and her reasonable accommodation request was properly denied.  However, the Commissioners did not
demonstrate that they had discretion to consider the requisite factors and
erroneously believed that termination was automatic because of an ongoing
repayment plan.  A writ shall issue
remanding the case to the Commission to exercise its appropriate discretion.
Petitioner Smith’s counsel is ordered to prepare a proposed
judgment and writ, serve them on the City’s counsel for approval as to form,
wait ten days after service for any objections, meet and confer if there are
objections, and then submit the proposed judgment and writ along with a
declaration stating the existence/non-existence of any unresolved
objections.  An OSC re: judgment is set
for December 7, 2023 at 9:30 a.m.
