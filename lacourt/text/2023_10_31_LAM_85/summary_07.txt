The Bank had obtained a writ of possession and turnover order against Screamline, but Screamline failed to comply with the order. The Bank argues that it has shown a probability of success on its claims and that the balance of hardships favors a preliminary injunction. The bond to support the preliminary injunction is set at $500.
