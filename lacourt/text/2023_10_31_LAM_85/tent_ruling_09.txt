1149 South LA Street
Fashion District, LLC et al v. People’s Properties, LLC, et al., 23STCV01994
 
Tentative decision on applications
for right to attach orders against (1) Unrivaled Brands, Inc: granted; (2) Bernard
Steimann: granted with one exemption




 
            
            
Plaintiff 1149 South LA Street Fashion District, LLC (“1149
South LA” or “Landlord”) applies for right to attach orders against Defendants Unrivaled
Brands, Inc. (“Unrivaled”) and Bernard Steimann (“Steimann”) in the amount of $495,595.

            The
court has read and considered the moving papers, oppositions, and replies,[1] and
renders the following tentative decision. 
 
            A. Statement of the Case
            1.
Complaint
            On
January 30, 2023, Plaintiffs 1149 South LA and 1135 South LA Street Fashion
District, LLC (“1135 South LA”) filed the Complaint against Defendants
Unrivaled, Steimann, People’s Properties LLC (“PP”), and Oxford Properties, LLC
(“Oxford”) alleging (1) breach of written contract, (2) breach of written
guaranty, (3) breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, (4)
waste, and (5) declaratory relief.  The
Complaint alleges in pertinent part as follows.
            On
November 22, 2019, Plaintiffs 1149 South LA and 1135 South LA (collectively, “Landlords”)
and Defendant PP entered into a commercial lease (“Lease”) for premises at 1149
South Los Angeles Street and 1135 South Los Angeles Street in Los Angeles,
California (“Premises”) with a term of seven years.  Steimann signed a Guaranty for all amounts
owed under this Lease (“Guaranty”).  
On September 1, 2021, PP, Unrivaled, Steimann, and Landlords
signed an assignment of both leases (“Assignment”) that assigned PP’s rights as
tenant to Unrivaled.  Steimann remained
the guarantor.
            From
August 2022 through January 2023, PP, Unrivaled, and Steimann have accrued $579,399.21
in Base Rent under the Lease.  Unrivaled
also has vacated the Premises without Landlords’ consent in violation of the Lease.  The Lease remains in effect until Landlords terminate
Defendants’ right to possess the Premises, which they have not.  As a result, Landlords may continue to
enforce their right to recover rent.
            Landlords
seek compensatory, consequential, exemplary, and punitive damages, as well as
attorney’s fees and costs.
 
            2.
Course of Proceedings
            On
February 6, 2023, Landlords served PP with the Complaint and Summons by
substitute service, effective February 16, 2023.
            On
February 13, 2023, Landlords served Unrivaled with the Complaint and Summons by
substitute service, effective February 26, 2023.
            On
March 14, 2023, Landlords served Steimann with the Complaint and Summons.
            On
April 10, 2023, Unrivaled filed its Answer.
            On
April 14, 2023, PP and Steimann filed their Answer.
            On
October 26, 2023, Landlord applied ex parte to specially set the right
to attach hearing.  Landlord timely had served the applications
but e-filed them on October 10, 2023, one day after the required 16-day period
in CCP section 1005(a).  The court noted
that merits oppositions were on file, no prejudice would result, and granted
the application.
 
            B.
Applicable Law
            Attachment
is a prejudgment remedy providing for the seizure of one or more of the
defendant’s assets to aid in the collection of a money demand pending the
outcome of the trial of the action.  See
Whitehouse v. Six Corporation, (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 527, 533.  In 1972, and in a 1977 comprehensive
revision, the Legislature enacted attachment legislation (CCP §481.010 et
seq.) that meets the due process requirements set forth in Randone v.
Appellate Department, (1971) 5 Cal.3d 536. 
See Western Steel & Ship Repair v. RMI, (12986) 176
Cal.App.3d 1108, 1115.  As the attachment
statutes are purely the creation of the Legislature, they are strictly
construed.  Vershbow v. Reiner,
(1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 879, 882.




            A
writ of attachment may be issued only in an action on a claim or claims for
money, each of which is based upon a contract, express or implied, where the
total amount of the claim or claims is a fixed or readily ascertainable amount
not less than five hundred dollars ($500). 
CCP §483.010(a).  A claim is
“readily ascertainable” where the amount due may be clearly ascertained from
the contract and calculated by evidence; the fact that damages are unliquidated
is not determinative.  CIT
Group/Equipment Financing, Inc. v. Super DVD, Inc., (2004) 115 Cal.App.4th
537, 540-41 (attachment appropriate for claim based on rent calculation for
lease of commercial equipment).
            All
property within California of a corporation, association, or partnership is
subject to attachment if there is a method of levy for the property.  CCP §487.010(a), (b).  While a trustee is a natural person, a trust
is not.  Therefore, a trust’s property is
subject to attachment on the same basis as a corporation or partnership.  Kadison, Pfaelzer, Woodard, Quinn &
Rossi v. Wilson, supra, 197 Cal.App.3d at 4.
            If
the action is against a defendant who is a natural person, an attachment may be
issued only on a commercial claim which arises out of the defendant’s conduct
of a trade, business, or profession.  CCP
§483.010(c).  Consumer transactions
cannot form a basis for attachment.   CCP
§483.010(c); Kadison, Pfaelzer, Woodard, Quinn & Rossi v. Wilson,
(1987) 197 Cal.App.3d 1, 4 (action involving trust property was a commercial,
not a consumer, transaction).
            The
plaintiff may apply for a right to attach order by noticing a hearing for the
order and serving the defendant with summons and complaint, notice of the
application, and supporting papers any time after filing the complaint.  CCP §484.010. 
Notice of the application must be given pursuant to CCP section 1005,
sixteen court days before the hearing.  See
ibid.
            The
notice of the application and the application may be made on Judicial Council
forms (Optional Forms AT-105, 115).  The
application must be supported by an affidavit showing that the plaintiff on the
facts presented would be entitled to a judgment on the claim upon which the
attachment is based.  CCP §484.030.  
            Where
the defendant is a corporation, a general reference to “all corporate property
which is subject to attachment pursuant to subdivision (a) of Code of Civil
Procedure Section 487.010” is sufficient. 
CCP §484.020(e).  Where the
defendant is a partnership or other unincorporated association, a reference to
“all property of the partnership or other unincorporated association which is
subject to attachment pursuant to subdivision (b) of Code of Civil Procedure
Section 487.010” is sufficient.  CCP
§484.020(e).  A specific description of
property is not required for corporations and partnerships as they generally
have no exempt property.  Bank of
America v. Salinas Nissan, Inc., (“Bank of America”) (1989) 207
Cal.App.3d 260, 268.
            Where
the defendant is a natural person, the description of the property must be
reasonably adequate to permit the defendant to identify the specific property
sought to be attached.  CCP §484.020(e).  Although the property must be specifically
described, the plaintiff may target for attachment everything the individual
defendant owns.  Bank of America v.
Salinas Nissan, Inc., (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 260, 268.
            A
defendant who opposes issuance of the order must file and serve a notice of
opposition and supporting affidavit as required by CCP section 484.060 not
later than five court days prior to the date set for hearing.  CCP §484.050(e).  The notice of opposition may be made on a
Judicial Council form (Optional Form AT-155). 

            The
plaintiff may file and serve a reply two court days prior to the date set for
the hearing.  CCP §484.060(c). 
            At
the hearing, the court determines whether the plaintiff should receive a right
to attach order and whether any property which the plaintiff seeks to attach is
exempt from attachment.  The defendant
may appear the hearing.  CCP
§484.050(h).  The court generally will
evaluate the attachment application based solely on the pleadings and
supporting affidavits without taking additional evidence.  Bank of America, supra, 207
Cal.App.3d at 273. A verified complaint may be used in lieu of or in addition
to an affidavit if it states evidentiary facts. 
CCP §482.040.  The plaintiff has
the burden of proof, and the court is not required to accept as true any
affidavit even if it is undisputed.  See
Bank of America, supra, at 271, 273.



            The
court may issue a right to attach order (Optional Form AT-120) if the plaintiff
shows all of the following: (1) the claim on which the attachment is based is
one on which an attachment may be issued (CCP §484.090(a)(1)); (2) the
plaintiff has established the probable validity of the claim (CCP
§484.090(a)(2)); (3) attachment is sought for no purpose other than the
recovery on the subject claim (CCP §484.090(a)(3); and (4) the amount to be
secured by the attachment is greater than zero (CCP §484.090(a)(4)). 
            A
claim has “probable validity” where it is more likely than not that the
plaintiff will recover on that claim. 
CCP §481.190.  In determining this
issue, the court must consider the relative merits of the positions of the
respective parties.  Kemp Bros.
Construction, Inc. v. Titan Electric Corp., (2007) 146 Cal.App.4th 1474,
1484.  The court does not determine
whether the claim is actually valid; that determination will be made at trial
and is not affected by the decision on the application for the order.  CCP §484.050(b).
            Except
in unlawful detainer actions, the amount to be secured by the attachment is the
sum of (1) the amount of the defendant’s indebtedness claimed by the plaintiff,
and (2) any additional amount included by the court for estimate of costs and
any allowable attorneys’ fees under CCP section 482.110.  CCP §483.015(a); Goldstein v. Barak
Construction, (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 845, 852.  This amount must be reduced by the sum of (1)
the amount of indebtedness that the defendant has in a money judgment against plaintiff,
(2) the amount claimed in a cross-complaint or affirmative defense and shown
would be subject to attachment against the plaintiff, and (3) the value of any
security interest held by the plaintiff in the defendant’s property, together
with the amount by which the acts of the plaintiff (or a prior holder of the
security interest) have decreased that security interest’s value.  CCP §483.015(b).  A defendant claiming that the amount to be
secured should be reduced because of a cross-claim or affirmative defense must
make a prima facie showing that the claim would result in an attachment
against the plaintiff.
            Before
the issuance of a writ of attachment, the plaintiff is required to file an
undertaking to pay the defendant any amount the defendant may recover for any
wrongful attachment by the plaintiff in the action.  CCP §489.210. 
The undertaking ordinarily is $10,000. CCP §489.220.  If the defendant objects, the court may
increase the amount of undertaking to the amount determined as the probable
recovery for wrongful attachment.  CCP
§489.220.  The court also has inherent
authority to increase the amount of the undertaking sua sponte.  North Hollywood Marble Co. v. Superior
Court, (1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 683, 691.
 
            C. Statement of Facts
            1.
Landlord’s Evidence[2]
            a.
Lease and Assignment
            On
November 22, 2019, Landlords and Oxford signed the seven-year Lease for the 1149
Premises.  Yi Unrivaled Decl., ¶8, Ex.
1.     Steimann
signed the Lease on Oxford’s behalf as a manager.  Yi Unrivaled Decl., ¶8, Ex. 1.  
            Section
5 of the Lease requires the tenant to deposit a security deposit.  Yi Unrivaled Decl., ¶8, Ex. 1.  In the event of default, Landlords could use,
apply, or retain any portion of this deposit for rents already due or to become
due.  Yi Unrivaled Decl., ¶8, Ex. 1.  If Landlords did so, the tenant was required
to replenish it within ten days of a written request.  Yi Unrivaled Decl., ¶8, Ex. 1.  
            Section
12.1(a) prohibits any assignment of the tenant’s interests in the Lease without
Landlords’ prior written consent.  Yi
Unrivaled Decl., ¶14, Ex. 1.  Under
section 12.2(e), any request for assignment or subletting must include
information relevant to Landlords’ determination as to the financial and
operational responsibility and appropriateness of the proposed assignee or
sublessee, including but not limited to the intended use and required
modification of the Premises.  Yi
Unrivaled Decl., ¶14, Ex. 1.  
            Section
13.2(a) of the Lease provides that, if the tenant breached the Lease, the
Landlords may terminate the Lease and collect (1) unpaid rent earned at the
time of termination plus (2) the amount by which unpaid rent which would have
been earned after termination until the time of an award thereof exceeds the
amount of such rental loss the tenant proves could have been reasonably
avoided.  Yi Unrivaled Decl., ¶14, Ex.
1.  Alternatively, section 13.2(b) allows
Landlords to continue the Lease and tenant’s right to possession of the
Premises thereunder and recover rent as it becomes due.  Yi Unrivaled Decl., ¶14, Ex. 1.  The tenant may then sublet or assign the
Lease, subject only to reasonable limitations. 
Yi Unrivaled Decl., ¶14, Ex. 1.  For
purposes of this remedy, efforts to relet the Premises would not constitute
termination of the tenant’s right to possession.  Yi Unrivaled Decl., ¶14, Ex. 1.  
Steimann signed a Guaranty for all amounts owed
thereunder.  Yi Unrivaled Decl., ¶8, Ex.
2.  The Guaranty gives Landlords the
right to proceed against Steimann as guarantor without first proceeding against
the Premises tenant.  Yi Guaranty Decl.,
¶9, Ex. 2.  Steimann also waived all
notice of acceptance of the Guaranty and demand of payment, presentation, and
protest.  Yi Guaranty Decl., ¶9, Ex. 2.
            On
March 6, 2020, Oxford filed an Amendment to its Articles of Incorporation changing
its name to PP.  Yi Unrivaled Decl., ¶8,
Ex. 6; Yi Guaranty Decl., ¶8, Ex. 5.  Steimann
signed the amendment.  Yi Unrivaled
Decl., ¶8, Ex. 6; Yi Guaranty Decl., ¶8, Ex. 5. 

            In
August 2021, PP sought Landlords’ consent for Unrivaled to assume the Lease for
and possession of the Premises from PP. 
Yi Unrivaled Decl., ¶9.  Unrivaled’s
10-Q for the first quarter of 2023 states that it is a cannabis company with
operations in retail, production, distribution, and cultivation throughout
California.  Yi Unrivaled Decl., ¶19, Ex.
5.  With the 2021 acquisition of People’s
First Choice, Unrivaled now operates a premier cannabis dispensary in Orange County,
California.  Yi Unrivaled Decl., ¶¶ 10,
21-22, Ex. 5.  It also owns dispensaries
in California which operate as The Spot in Santa Ana, Blüm in Oakland, and Blüm
in San Leandro.  Yi Unrivaled Decl., ¶10,
Ex. 5.  Unrivaled has eight subsidiaries
and 153 employees.  Yi Unrivaled Decl., ¶¶
19-20, Ex. 5.  
            Landlords
agreed to the transfer of possession.  Yi
Unrivaled Decl., ¶11.  On September 1,
2021, PP, Unrivaled, Steimann, and Landlords entered the Assignment.  Yi Unrivaled Decl., ¶11, Ex. 3.  PP assigned Unrivaled all of its rights and
obligations under the Lease.  Yi
Unrivaled Decl., ¶11, Ex. 3.  Landlords acknowledged
that they held a $110,000 security deposit from PP and would continue to hold
this sum for the benefit of Unrivaled’s account.  Yi Unrivaled Decl., ¶11, Ex. 3.  
            
            b.
Breach and Damages
            Unrivaled
breached the Assignment for failure to pay rent when it became due in August
2022.  Yi Unrivaled Decl., ¶12.
            The
Base Rent under the Lease and Assignment started at $47,250 in November 2019
and increased by 3% every year beginning November 1, 2022.  Yi Unrivaled Decl., ¶13, Exs. 1, 3-4.  
The Base Rent therefore increased to
$48,667.50 on November 2022.  Yi
Unrivaled Decl., ¶13, Ex. 4.  The Base
Rent that became due from August 2022 through August 2023 is ($47,250 x 3) +
($48,667.50 x 10) = $628,425.  Yi
Unrivaled Decl., ¶13, Ex. 4.  During that
time, Unrivaled made one $100,000 payment on April 10, 2023, and one $32,830
payment on April 21, 2023.  Yi Unrivaled
Decl., ¶13, Ex. 4.  This reduced the
amount owed to $628,425.00 - $100,000 - $32,830 = $495,595.  Yi Unrivaled Decl., ¶13, Ex. 4.  
Steimann has refused to honor his duty under the Guaranty to
pay PP and Unrivaled’s outstanding obligations under the Lease and Assignment.  Yi Guaranty Decl., ¶15.
            Unrivaled
and Steimann’s debts are unsecured.  Yi
Unrivaled Decl., ¶14; Yi Guaranty Decl., ¶16. 
Landlords only seek attachment to ensure recovery of amounts owed.  Yi Unrivaled Decl., ¶14.  They have not terminated Unrivaled’s right to
possession of the Premises.  Yi Unrivaled
Decl., ¶16.  
 
            2.
Defendants’ Evidence
            a.
Landlords’ Refusal to Terminate Lease
            Unrivaled
entered the Assignment with the intent to open a cannabis dispensary at the
Premises.  Carillo Decl., ¶4.  Its efforts to do so failed.  Carillo Decl., ¶4.  By August 2022, Unrivaled had abandoned the
Premises and stopped paying rent. 
Carillo Decl., ¶5.  
            After
Unrivaled abandoned the Lease, Landlords never made a demand on Steimann to
personally pay anything related to the Lease. 
Steimann Decl., ¶2.  Landlords
still has the $110,000 security deposit and the Lease allows Landlords to apply
it against the amount owed.  Steimann
Decl., ¶3.  
            On
March 1, 2023, Landlords told Unrivaled they were trying to show the Premises
to local brokers and prospective tenants. 
Scott Decl., ¶2, Ex. 2.  They asked
Unrivaled how it wanted Landlords to request access and deactivate the lockbox
and security alarm.  Scott Decl., ¶2, Ex.
2.  This request surprised Unrivaled,
which had abandoned the Premises for months. 
Carillo Decl., ¶6.  Unrivaled
replied that to the extent that it still had possession, it was formally
abandoning the Premises and did not need access.  Scott Decl., ¶2, Ex. 2.  
            Landlords
stated that, based on this notice of abandonment, they intended to conduct a
walkthrough and initial inspection of the Premises on March 3.  Colby Decl., ¶3, Ex. A.  Landlords later uploaded video and photo
files from the inspection.  Colby Decl.,
¶4, Ex. B.  Counsel for Steimann
interpreted Landlords’ conduct as affirmative steps to regain possession and to
list and market the Premises for sale or lease. 
Colby Decl., ¶3.
            On
March 7, 2023, Landlords gave notice that they were showing the building to a
prospective tenant the next day.  Colby
Decl., ¶4, Ex. B.
            On
March 13, 2023, Landlords stated that, pursuant to Civil Code section 1951.4(b)
and section 13.2(b) of the Lease, Landlords were not terminating the Lease, the
Assignment, or Unrivaled’s right thereunder to possession of the Premises.  Scott Decl., ¶3, Ex. 3.  Base Rent would continue to accrue at
$48,667.50 per month, plus 10% interest on the balance owed.  Scott Decl., ¶3, Ex. 3.  
 
            b.
Efforts to Sublet
            Following
Landlords’ March 13, 2023 assertion that Unrivaled retained possession of the
Premises, Unrivaled attempted to mitigate Landlords’ damages by listing the
property with the broker Marcus & Millichap (“M&M”).  Carillo Decl., ¶7.  Unrivaled discovered that Landlords had
already begun marketing the Premises through their own broker, CBRE.  Carillo Decl., ¶7.  Because commercial real estate brokers insist
on exclusivity in listing property, CBRE’s listing prevented listing by
M&M.  Carillo Decl., ¶7.  
            In
May 2023, Landlords introduced Unrivaled to a potential Lease assignee, Yinchun
Chen (“Chen”).  Carillo Decl., ¶9.  Chen represented the owner of several
successful night clubs and wanted to open a night club on the Premises.  Carillo Decl., ¶9.  After discussions with Unrivaled, Chen agreed
to assume the Lease.  Carillo Decl.,
¶10.  Unrivaled informed Landlords.  Carillo Decl., ¶11.  
            On
May 12, 2023, Chen said that Landlords’ representative said they decided not to
work with Chen.  Carillo Decl., ¶12, Ex. 1.  Landlords wanted to keep Unrivaled on the
Lease to make things “easier for them.” 
Carillo Decl., ¶12, Ex. 1. 
Unrivaled was surprised at Landlords’ rejection of a legitimate tenant.  Carillo Decl., ¶13.
            On
June 23, 2023, M&M was able to list the Premises.  Carillo Decl., ¶14.  The same day, Landlords sent notice that this
impeded their own ongoing efforts to actively market the Premises. Colby Decl.,
¶5, Ex. C.  
            In
an email on August 16, 2023, Landlords asserted that not much marketing for the
Premises had occurred since M&M assumed the listing.  Scott Decl., ¶5, Ex. 5.  They asked Unrivaled if it would allow CBRE
to take over, with all parties reserving all rights.  Scott Decl., ¶5, Ex. 5.  Landlords were told that no broker would
touch the listing without the exclusive right to do so.  Scott Decl., ¶5, Ex. 5.  Unrivaled complied and informed Landlords on
September 5 that it had released the listing. 
Carillo Decl., ¶15; Scott Decl., ¶6, Ex. 6.  Unrivaled believed it was then relieved of
any obligation to market the Premises. 
Carillo Decl., ¶16.  
            On
October 11, 2023, Landlords said they were “ready to proceed” with a CBRE
listing for the Premises.  Scott Decl.,
¶7, Ex. 7; Colby Decl., ¶6, Ex. D.  The
next day, Landlords asserted via email that their desire to list the Premises
was to help Unrivaled with its duty to mitigate Landlords’ damages.   Scott
Decl., ¶8, Ex. 8.  Landlords did not
waive their right to continue to recover rent that meanwhile became due, and they
were not assuming any affirmative duty to mitigate damages.  Scott Decl., ¶8, Ex. 8.  Until Defendants agreed, Landlords would not
undertake marketing activities.  Scott
Decl., ¶8, Ex. 8.
            On
October 16, 2023, Landlords announced they would not move forward with engaging
CBRE or another broker to market, sub-lease, or take other activities related
to the Premises due to homeless activities nearby.  Scott Decl., ¶9, Ex. 9; Colby Decl., ¶7, Ex. E.  Landlords urged Unrivaled to secure the
property in a reasonable manner.  Ex. 9.
 
            c.
Steimann’s Request for Exemptions
            Steimann
has two children and an ex-wife, none of whom contribute to the household’s
income.  Steimann Decl., ¶5, Ex. A.     His estimated
monthly expenditures total $38,180.19, including $2,500 for legal fees for this
lawsuit.  Steimann Decl., ¶6, Ex. A.  Steimann requests an annual exemption of
$458,162.28 for amounts necessary to support his family.  Steimann Decl., ¶6, Ex. A.
            His
gross monthly pay is $12,500, and his monthly take-home pay is $8,872.85 after
$3,627.15 in payroll deductions.  Steimann
Decl., ¶7, Ex. A.  Based on his gross
pay, he requests an annual exemption of $150,000 for employer
compensation.  Steimann Decl., ¶7.  
            Steimann
owns multiple vehicles.  Steimann Decl.,
¶8, Ex. A.  His 1973 Chevy Blazer is
worth $50,000.  Steimann Decl., ¶8, Ex.
A.  Steimann requests a motor vehicle
exemption of $7,500.  Steimann Decl., ¶8,
Ex. A.  
 
            3.
Reply Evidence
            To
secure the Lease, Steimann advised Landlords that he was the majority
shareholder and CEO of PP.  Yi Guaranty Reply
Decl., ¶9.  He executed the Guaranty to further
PP’s business as the Lease’s original tenant. 
Yi Guaranty Reply Decl., ¶9.
            In
2021, Steimann advised Landlords that he had sold PP’s assets to Unrivaled, which
would be taking over the store on the Premises. 
Yi Guaranty Reply Decl., ¶9. 
Steimann entered the current Guaranty only to transfer the PP Lease to
Unrivaled.  Yi Guaranty Reply Decl., ¶9.
            Steimann
is fully aware of Unrivaled’s default on the Lease.  Yi Guaranty Reply Decl., ¶3.  The Guaranty permits Landlords to proceed
against him without any prior demand or payment.  Yi Guaranty Reply Decl., ¶4.  This Complaint doubles as another such
demand.  Yi Guaranty Reply Decl.,
¶4.  
            Landlords
never accepted Unrivaled’s offer to abandon the Premises.  Yi Unrivaled Reply Decl., ¶2.  They never terminated the Lease or expressed
intent to do so.  Yi Unrivaled Reply
Decl., ¶2.  
            Although
Unrivaled hired M&M to exclusively list the premises for subletting,
M&M made no meaningful progress.  Yi
Unrivaled Reply Decl., ¶3.  Before
Landlords committed to helping by having its own listing agent find a
sublessee, they asked Unrivaled and Steimann to clarify that this was not a
waiver of Landlords’ rights.  Yi
Unrivaled Reply Decl., ¶¶ 3-4.  When they
refused, Landlords chose not to help.  Yi
Unrivaled Reply Decl., ¶4.  Landlords
never told Unrivaled it was relieved of obligations to market the
property.  Yi Unrivaled Reply Decl., ¶9.
            Unrivaled
and Steimann never asked Landlords to apply the security deposit to the amount
owed.  Yi Unrivaled Reply Decl., ¶5.  The Lease does not require Landlords to do
so.  Yi Unrivaled Reply Decl., ¶5.
            When
Chen asked if her client could sublease the Premises, she said it would only do
so in exchange for a concession of six to nine months of free rent.  Yi Unrivaled Reply Decl., ¶6.  Landlords were unwilling to agree, and Chen
never asked Unrivaled if it would pay those months of rent.  Yi Unrivaled Reply Decl., ¶6.  Unrivaled also never provided proof that the
proposed sub-lessee had the means to pay rent or the necessary business license
for the proposed nightclub.  Yi Unrivaled
Reply Decl., ¶7.  When Landlords
discovered that obtaining a night club license is not as simple as Chen made it
sound, they knew Chen’s client was not a suitable tenant.  Yi Unrivaled Reply Decl., ¶7.  It was inexperienced, unable to commit to
paying full rent, and unsuitable.  Yi
Unrivaled Reply Decl., ¶8.  Landlords had
reasonable basis to reject the company as a sub-tenant.  Yi Unrivaled Reply Decl., ¶8.  
 
            D. Analysis
            Landlord
1149 South LA applies for right to attach orders against Defendants Unrivaled and
Steimann in the amount of $495,595.  See Unrivaled Opp. at 1, n. 1.
 
            1.
A Claim Based on a
Contract and on Which Attachment May Be Based
            A
writ of attachment may be issued only in an action on a claim or claims for
money, each of which is based upon a contract, express or implied, where the
total amount of the claim or claims is a fixed or readily ascertainable amount
not less than five hundred dollars ($500). 
CCP §483.010(a).  
            Landlord’s
claims for $495,595 are based on the Lease,
Assignment, and Guaranty.  Yi Unrivaled
Decl., Exs. 1-3.  Landlord has claims on
which to base attachment.
 
            2. An Amount Due That is Fixed
and Readily Ascertainable 
            A
claim is “readily ascertainable” where the damages may be readily ascertained by
reference to the contract and the basis of the calculation appears to be
reasonable and definite.  CIT
Group/Equipment Financing, Inc. v. Super DVD, Inc., (2004) 115 Cal.App.4th 537,
540-41.  The fact that the damages are
unliquidated is not determinative.  Id.  But the contract must furnish a standard by
which the amount may be ascertained and there must be a basis by which the
damages can be determined by proof.  Id.
(citations omitted).
            Pursuant
to the Lease, Base Rent started at $47,250 in November 2019 and increased by 3%
on November 1, 2022.  Yi Unrivaled Decl.,
¶13, Exs. 1, 3-4.  
            The
Base Rent that became due from August 2022 through August 2023 is therefore
($47,250 x 3) + ($48,667.50 x 10) = $628,425. 
Yi Unrivaled Decl., ¶13, Ex. 4. 
During that time, Unrivaled made one $100,000 payment on April 10, 2023,
and one $32,830 payment on April 21, 2023. 
Yi Unrivaled Decl., ¶13, Ex. 4. 
This reduced the amount owed to $628,425.00 - $100,000 - $32,830 =
$495,595.  Yi Unrivaled Decl., ¶13, Ex.
4.
            Steimann
cites the Assignment’s acknowledgement that PP had paid a $110,000 security
deposit that now applied to Unrivaled.  Steimann
Decl., ¶3.  Although the deposit is to be
used as security for amounts owed under the Lease, Landlords have not
demonstrated they applied the deposit to the $495,595.  Guaranty Opp. at 8-9.  
The Lease allows Landlords to apply the deposit to damages
owed because of default but does not require Landlords to do so.  Guaranty Reply at 8; Yi Unrivaled Reply Decl.,
¶5; Yi Unrivaled Decl., ¶8, Ex. 1.  Unrivaled
and Steimann never asked Landlord to apply the security deposit to the amount
owed.  Yi Unrivaled Reply Decl., ¶5.  Additionally, the tenant is required to
replenish the security deposit within ten days of a written request to that
effect.  Yi Unrivaled Decl., ¶8, Ex.
1.  Assuming the Lease remains in effect,
the security deposit does not affect the total amount Landlord can demand from
Unrivaled and Steimann.
            Damages
of $495,595 are readily ascertainable.
 
            3.
Attachment Based on Commercial Claim
            If
the action is against a defendant who is a natural person, an attachment may be
issued only on a commercial claim which arises out of the defendant’s conduct
of a trade, business, or profession.  CCP
§483.010(c).  Consumer transactions
cannot form a basis for attachment.   CCP
§483.010(c); Kadison, Pfaelzer, Woodard, Quinn & Rossi v. Wilson, (“Kadison”)
(1987) 197 Cal.App.3d 1, 4 (action involving trust property was a commercial,
not a consumer, transaction).
            These terms “trade,”
“business,” and “profession” encompass almost any activity engaged in for
profit with “frequency and continuity.”  Advance
Transformer Co. v. Superior Court, (1974) 44 Cal.App.3d 127, 139. 
The purpose of the attachment statutes is to confine attachment to
commercial situations and prohibit their use in consumer transactions.  Kadison, supra, 197 Cal.App.3d
at 4.
            Steimann
asserts that Landlord has failed to tie the breach of guaranty claim to his trade,
business, or profession.  Guaranty Opp.
at 6.  Landlord responds that Steimann
represented he was PP’s CEO when he signed the Guaranty.  Guaranty Reply at 8; Yi Guaranty Reply Decl.,
¶4.  He executed the Guaranty to further
PP’s business as the Lease’s original tenant. 
Yi Guaranty Reply Decl., ¶9.
            Landlord’s
evidence also demonstrates the commercial nature of Steimann debt.  Steimann signed the Lease in his capacity as
a manager for the original tenant, Oxford. 
Yi Unrivaled Decl., ¶8, Ex. 1.  Steimann
advised Landlords that he was the majority shareholder and CEO of PP.  Yi Guaranty Reply Decl., ¶9.  Steimann also signed the amendment to
Oxford’s Articles of Incorporation that changed its name to PP.  Yi Unrivaled Decl., ¶8, Ex. 6; Yi Guaranty
Decl., ¶8, Ex. 5.  
            In
2021 Steimann advised Landlords that he had sold PP’s assets to Unrivaled, which
would be taking over the store on the Premises. 
Yi Guaranty Reply Decl., ¶9. 
Steimann entered the Guaranty only to transfer the PP lease to
Unrivaled.  Yi Guaranty Reply Decl.,
¶9.  He executed the Guaranty to further
PP’s business as the Lease’s original tenant. 
Yi Guaranty Reply Decl., ¶9. 
These facts indicate that Steimann signed the Guaranty to
induce Landlords to execute the Lease and further his commercial interests.  Yi Unrivaled Decl., Ex. 2.  The action against Steimann arises out of his
conduct of a business or profession.
 
            4. Probability of Success
            A
claim has “probable validity” where it is more likely than not that the
plaintiff will recover on that claim. 
CCP §481.190.  In determining this
issue, the court must consider the relative merits of the positions of the
respective parties.  Kemp Bros.
Construction, Inc. v. Titan Electric Corp., (2007) 146 Cal.App.4th 1474,
1484.  The court does not determine
whether the claim is actually valid; that determination will be made at trial
and is not affected by the decision on the application for the order.  CCP §484.050(b).
 
            a.
Guarantor Demand
            Steimann
asserts that Landlords never made a demand for him to pay amounts owed under
the Assignment or Lease.  Steimann Decl.,
¶3.  Steimann therefore never breached his
Guaranty.  Steimann Decl., ¶3.  Guaranty Opp. at 5.
            The
Guaranty did not require such a demand.  As
guarantor, Steimann waived all notice of acceptance of the Guaranty and demand
of payment, presentation, and protest.  Guaranty
Reply at 7; Yi Guaranty Reply Decl., ¶4, Yi Guaranty Decl., ¶9, Ex. 2.  The Guaranty also gave Landlords the right to
proceed against Steimann as guarantor without first proceeding against the
Premises tenant or providing Guarantor notice.  Guaranty App. at 1; Yi Guaranty Decl., ¶9, Ex.
2.  Additionally, the Complaint itself
may be considered a payment demand.  
 
            b.
Mitigation of Damages
            Most
leases for real property terminate whenever a lessee breaches the lease and
abandons the property before the end of the term or if his right to possession
is terminated by the lessor because of a breach of the lease.  Civil Code §1951.2(a).  The lessor may then recover the worth at the
time of award of the amount by which the unpaid rent which would have been
earned after termination until the time of award exceeds the amount of such
rental loss that the lessee proves could have been reasonably avoided.  Civil Code §1951.2(a)(2).
            A
lease may provide that it survives the lessee’s breach and abandonment of the
real property for so long as the lessor does not terminate the lessee’s right
to possession.  Civil Code
§1951.4(b).  The lessor may enforce all
rights and remedies under the lease, including to recover rent as it becomes
due, if it permits the lessee to sublet the property, assign the lessee’s
interest in the lease, or both.  Civil
Code §1951.4(b)(1).  If subject to
standards and conditions, they must be reasonable at the time the lease is
executed and at the time the lessor seeks to enforce them.  Civil Code §1951.4(b)(2).  The burden of proof lies with a lessee
seeking to show a condition was unreasonable. 
Id.  If the right to sublet
or assign requires lessor consent, consent may not be unreasonably
withheld.  Civil Code §1951.4(b)(3).
            For
purposes of Civil Code section 1951.4(b), a landlord’s acts of maintenance or
preservation or efforts to re-let the property do not constitute termination of
lessee possession.  Civil Code
§1951.4(c)(1).  Withholding consent to or
terminating a subletting or assignment does not terminate the lessee’s right to
possession if the withholding or termination does not violate the rights of the
lessee in Civil Code section 1951.4(b). 
Civil Code §1951.4(c)(3).
In the event of tenant or assignee default, the Lease allows
Landlords to continue the Lease and tenant’s right to possession of the
Premises thereunder and recover rent as it becomes due.  Yi Unrivaled Decl., ¶14, Ex. 1.  The tenant may then sublet or assign the
Lease, subject only to reasonable limitations. 
Yi Unrivaled Decl., ¶14, Ex. 1. 
For purposes of this remedy, Landlords’ efforts to relet the Premises
would not constitute termination of the tenant’s right to possession.  Yi Unrivaled Decl., ¶14, Ex. 1.  Landlords assert they exercised this right
and have not terminated Unrivaled’s right to possession of the Premises.  Yi Unrivaled Decl., ¶16.
Both Unrivaled and Stemann allege Landlords’ interference
with Unrivaled’s contractual duty to mitigate. 
Guaranty Opp. at 6-8; Unrivaled Opp. at 6-8.
Steimann argues that Unrivaled abandoned the property and
that Landlords had the right to keep the Lease in effect and continue to
collect rent only if it acted reasonably and consistent with the Lease
remaining in effect.  Wills v. Soda
Shoppes of California, Inc., (1982) 134 Cal.App.3d 899, 903.  Guaranty Opp. at 6-8.  
Unrivaled argues that it abandoned the Premises in August
2022.  Following abandonment, on March 1,
2023, Landlords contacted Unrivaled about showing the property and inquiring
how Unrivaled wanted it to request access. 
On March 13, 2023, Landlords asserted that it was exercising its rights
under Civil Code section 1951.4 not to terminate the Lease and to continue to
seek rent as it became due.  After that
point, Landlords obstructed Unrivaled’s effort to market the property and
prevented Unrivaled from assigning the Lease. 
Unrivaled Opp. at 2-4.  In August
2023, Landlords demanded that Unrivaled de-list with its broker.  When Unrivaled released its exclusive broker
listing on September 5, 2023, Landlords never actually re-listed the Premises
and informed Unrivaled on October 16, 2023 that it would not engage a
broker.  Unrivaled Opp. at 4-5.  
Landlords can only impose reasonable restrictions on
Unrivaled’s ability to assign or sublet the Premises following
abandonment.  Lease §13.2(b).  Landlords’ refusal to consent to assignment
of the Lease to a new tenant was unreasonable because consent was denied
because it would be easier for Landlords to force Unrivaled to maintain
possession.  Carillo Decl., ¶12, Ex.
1.  If Landlords had acted in good faith,
Unrivaled would have mitigated rents for June through August 2023, reducing the
attachment by $146.002.50 to $349,592.50. 
Unrivaled Opp. at 6-8.
 
            (1).
March 2023 Communications
            Beginning
on March 1, 2023, Landlords notified Unrivaled and Steimann that they were marketing
the Premises and showing them to local brokers and prospective tenants.  Scott Decl., ¶2, Ex. 2; Colby Decl., ¶5, Exs.
B-D.  On March 1, Unrivaled asserted that,
to the extent that it still had possession, it was formally abandoning the
Premises and did not need access.  Scott
Decl., ¶2, Ex. 2.  Landlords then
scheduled and conducted a walkthrough and initial inspection on March 3.  Colby Decl., ¶¶ 3-4, Exs. A-B.  
            Landlord
cites to Civil Code section 1951.35(c)-(e), which outlines the procedure for
establishing abandonment of leased commercial real property.  Guaranty Reply at 4.  A lessor may give notice of belief of
abandonment after rent has remained unpaid for the number of days required for
a lessor to declare default if the lessor believes that the lessee has
abandoned the property.  The lessee then
has at least fifteen days after the lessor personally serves notice of belief
of abandonment to assert that it does not intend to abandon the commercial real
property.  Civil Code §§ 1951.35(b), (c),
(e).  Landlord never gave such
notice.  Guaranty Reply at 3-4.  
            Assuming
arguendo that Unrivaled did abandon the Premises, on March 13, 2023
Landlords refused to terminate the Lease, the Assignment, or Unrivaled’s right
to possession of the Premises.  Guaranty Reply
at 4; Scott Decl., ¶3, Ex. 3; Yi Unrivaled Reply Decl., ¶2.  Steimann admits that when a tenant abandons the
premises and offers to surrender a leasehold to the landlord, the landlord may
reject it. 7 Miller & Starr, Cal. Real Estate (3d ed.2001) § 19:190, p.
586; see also Rest.2d Property, Landlord and Tenant, § 12.1(3).  Guaranty Opp. at 7; Guaranty Reply at 4.  
Steimann argues that Landlords accepted Unrivaled’s tender
of possession, revoked the Lease, and excused Unrivaled from paying future rent.  Guaranty Opp. at 7.  Civil Code section 1951.4(c)(1) excludes efforts
to relet the property from the types of conduct that may demonstrate termination
of lessee possession.  Guaranty Reply at
4, 6.  Landlords’ effort to market the
Premises does not by itself constitute repossession.  
 
            (2).
Real Estate Broker Listings       
            Prevention
of performance by a promisee is equivalent to performance by the promisor.  Unruh v. Smith, (“Unruh”) (1954)
123 Cal.App.2d 431, 437; Carlson v. Sheehan, (1910) 157 Cal. 692, 696.  Where a party to a contract prevents the
fulfillment of a condition or its performance by the adverse party, he cannot
rely on such condition to defeat his liability. 
Unruh, supra, 123 Cal.App.2d at 437.  
            When
Unrivaled first tried to list the Premises with M&M, it discovered the
Landlords were already listing the Premises with CBRE.  Carillo Decl., ¶¶ 7-8.  Because commercial real estate brokers insist
on exclusivity in listing property, CBRE’s listing prevented listing by
M&M.  Carillo Decl., ¶7.  Landlords later admitted that this was true
for all real estate brokers.  Scott
Decl., ¶5, Ex. 5.  M&M obtained the
right to list the Premises on June 23, 2023. 
Carillo Decl., ¶14.  Unrivaled
asserts that until that date, Landlords had interfered with Unrivaled’s ability
to fulfill its duty to mitigate damages. 
Unrivaled Opp. at 7.
            This
argument fails.  The Lease provides that
the tenant has the right to sublet and assign its rights after default subject
to “reasonable limitations.”  Yi
Unrivaled Decl., ¶14, Ex. 1.  Unrivaled
has not shown that Landlord’s listing actions were unreasonable.  Landlord presents evidence that, although
Unrivaled hired M&M to exclusively list the premises for subletting,
M&M made no meaningful progress.  Yi
Unrivaled Reply Decl., ¶3.  Landlords
discussed with Unrivaled’s counsel which of the two listing brokers would
provide better results and engage in more aggressive marketing.  Scott Decl., ¶5, Ex. 5.  Before Landlords committed to helping by
having its own listing agent find a sublessee, they asked Unrivaled and
Steimann to clarify that this was not a waiver of Landlords’ rights.  Yi Unrivaled Reply Decl., ¶¶ 3-4.  When they refused, Landlords chose not to
help.  Yi Unrivaled Reply Decl., ¶4.  Landlords never told Unrivaled it was
relieved of obligations to market the property. 
Yi Unrivaled Reply Decl., ¶9.  Moreover,
assuming arguendo that Landlords interfered, Defendants fail to show
that listing the Premises with M&M may have resulted in mitigation where
listing with CBRE did not.  
            Unrivaled
fails to demonstrate that Landlords’ control over listing the Premises deprived
Unrivaled of the ability to mitigate damages.
 
            (3).
Rejection of Chen’s Offer
            If
a lessee’s right to sublet or assign the lease after default is subject to
standards and conditions, they must be reasonable at the time the lease is
executed and at the time the lessor seeks to enforce them.  Civil Code §1951.4(b)(2).  The burden of proof lies with a lessee
seeking to show a condition was unreasonable. 
Id.  If the right to sublet
or assign requires lessor consent, consent may not be unreasonably
withheld.  Civil Code §1951.4(b)(3).
            In
May 2023, Landlords’ representative introduced Unrivaled to a potential Lease
assignee, Chen.  Carillo Decl., ¶9.  Chen and Unrivaled eventually agreed to an
assignment.  Carillo Decl., ¶¶ 10-11.  However, on May 12, 2023, Chen said that Landlords’
representative had told her that Landlords decided not to work with Chen.  Carillo Decl., ¶12, Ex. 1.  Landlords wanted to keep Unrivaled on the
Lease to make things “easier for them.” 
Carillo Decl., ¶12, Ex. 1.  
            Unrivaled
asserts that Landlords’ refusal to accept the assignment was unreasonable.  Unrivaled Opp. at 7.  It should therefore receive the benefits it
would have if Landlords had accepted the assignment, which are the rent that
would not have accrued from June through August 2023, a total of $146,002.50.  Id.
            Section
12(a) of the Lease requires Landlords’ written consent to assignment of the tenant’s
interests in the Lease.  Yi Unrivaled
Decl., ¶14, Ex. 1.  Under section
12.2(e), any request for assignment or subletting must include information
relevant to Landlords’ determination as to the financial and operational
responsibility and appropriateness of the proposed assignee or sublessee,
including but not limited to the intended use and required modification of the
Premises.  Yi Unrivaled Decl., ¶14, Ex.
1.  Defendants have the burden of showing
that Landlords’ rejection was unreasonable. 
See Civil Code §1951.4(b)(2).  

            While
Unrivaled’s position has some support, it is insufficient.  The communication to Unrivaled that Landlords
want to keep Unrivaled on the Lease because it would be “easier” is
ambiguous.  Landlord presents evidence
that, when Chen asked if her client could sublease the Premises, she said it
would only do so in exchange for a concession of six to nine months of free
rent.  Yi Unrivaled Reply Decl., ¶6.  Landlords were unwilling to agree, and Chen
never asked Unrivaled if it would pay those months of rent.  Yi Unrivaled Reply Decl., ¶6.  Unrivaled also never provided proof that the
proposed sub-lessee had the means to pay rent or the necessary business license
for the proposed nightclub.  Yi Unrivaled
Reply Decl., ¶7.  When Landlords
discovered that obtaining a night club license is not as simple as Chen made it
sound, they knew Chen’s client was not a suitable tenant.  Yi Unrivaled Reply Decl., ¶7.  It was inexperienced, unable to commit to
paying full rent, and unsuitable.  Yi
Unrivaled Reply Decl., ¶8.  Landlords had
reasonable basis to reject the company as a sub-tenant.  Yi Unrivaled Reply Decl., ¶8.  
Unrivaled fails to show that consent to assignment was
unreasonably withheld.  
 
            (4).
August 2023
            In
an email on August 16, 2023, Landlords asked for permission to again list the
Premises with CBRE, with all parties reserving all rights.  Scott Decl., ¶5, Ex. 5.  Unrivaled complied and informed Landlords on
September 5 that it had released the listing.  Carillo Decl., ¶15; Scott Decl., ¶6, Ex. 6.  On October 11, 2023, Landlords said they were
only “ready to proceed” with a CBRE listing for the Premises.  Unrivaled Opp. at 7; Scott Decl., ¶7, Ex. 7;
Colby Decl., ¶6, Ex. D.  On October 16,
2023, Landlords announced they would not move forward with engaging CBRE or
another broker to market, sub-lease, or take other activities related to the
Premises due to homeless activities nearby. 
Scott Decl., ¶9, Ex. 9; Colby Decl., ¶7, Ex. E.  Landlords urged Unrivaled to secure the
property in a reasonable manner.  Ex. 9.
            The
court need not discuss these events in detail because they are irrelevant.  Landlords only seek attachment for Base Rent
accruing by August 1, 2023.  Yi Unrivaled
Decl., ¶13, Ex. 4.  If these events
interfered with efforts to mitigate damages (Unrivaled Opp. at 7), it did not
affect the damages at issue.
 
            c.
Conclusion
            Landlords
have demonstrated a probability of success on the merits.
 
            5.
Description of Property to be Attached
            Where
the defendant is a natural person, the description of the property must be
reasonably adequate to permit the defendant to identify the specific property
sought to be attached.  CCP §484.020(e).  Although the property must be specifically
described, the plaintiff may target for attachment everything the individual
defendant owns.  Bank of America v.
Salinas Nissan, Inc., (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 260, 268. The requirement of
specificity avoids unnecessary hearings where an individual defendant is
willing to concede that the described property is subject to attachment.  Ibid. 
A general list of categories - e.g., “real property, personal
property, equipment, motor vehicles, chattel paper, negotiable and other
instruments, securities, deposit accounts, safe-deposit boxes, accounts
receivable, general intangibles, property subject to pending actions, final
money judgments, and personal property in decedents’ estates” – is
sufficient.  Ibid. 
            Landlords
seek to attach Steimann’s interests in real property; accounts receivable;
chattel paper; equipment; farm products; inventory; general intangibles and
final money judgments arising out of the conduct of a trade, business, or
profession; money on the premises where a trade, business, or profession is
conducted; negotiable documents of title; instruments; securities; minerals or
the like to be extracted; and Steimann’s checking account with Bank of America.  
Steimann’s argument that these categories are too broad
fails.  Guaranty Opp. at 9-10.  Landlords assert that the checking account
with Bank of America has $367,000.  Yi
Guaranty Decl., ¶22.  Although this evidence
lacks foundation and fails to state details of the account (see Guaranty
Opp. at 10, n. 4), it is not required.  The
right to attach order can encompass any bank account Steimann may have without
identifying specific accounts.  The
description of attachable property is adequate.
 
6. Attachment Sought for a Proper Purpose 
            Attachment
must not be sought for a purpose other than the recovery on the claim upon
which attachment is based.  CCP §484.090(a)(3).
            Landlord’s
proposed right to attach order for Unrivaled includes a list of 72 properties
to attach.  Unrivaled Opp. at 9.  Only 12 of these are in Unrivaled’s name, and
the other 60 are owned by its subsidiaries. 
Id; Unrivaled App. at 3; Yi Unrivaled Decl., ¶¶ 10, 19-22, Ex. 5.  Unrivaled asserts that Landlords are using
the right to attach order to “reverse pierce” the corporate veil Unrivaled’s
subsidiaries without establishing the legal basis to do so.  Unrivaled Opp. at 9-11.
            While
Unrivaled appears to be correct, the court need not discuss this issue in any
detail.  The identification of specific
property to be attached is unnecessary for a right to attach order against a
corporate entity.  CCP §484.020(e).  To the extent Landlord seeks to attach
property belonging not to Unrivaled but rather to a subsidiary, that subsidiary
entity has its own remedies to set aside the attachment and to seek damages for
wrongful attachment.  That does not
change whether attachment of Unrivaled assets in itself is proper.  Unrivaled Reply at 5.
Landlord seeks attachment for a proper purpose.  Yi Unrivaled Decl., ¶14.  
 
            7. Exemptions
            The
property exempt from attachment consists of (a) all property exempt from
enforcement of a money judgment,[3]
(b) property which is necessary for the support of a defendant who is a natural
person or the family of such defendant supported in whole or in part by the
defendant, (c) “earnings” as defined by CCP section 706.011, and (d) all
property not subject to attachment pursuant to CCP section 487.010.  CCP §487.020. 

            Unrivaled
asserts that Steimann should not raise his exemption arguments at this hearing because
allowing him to preclude attachment based on these exemptions is “putting the
cart before the horse.”  Opp. at 9.  Not so. 
If the defendant claims that any personal property described in
the application is exempt from attachment, the defendant may include that claim
in the notice of opposition to the right to attach order (CCP §484.060(a)) or
may file and serve a separate claim of exemption for the property (CCP
§484.070(b)).  If the defendant does not
do either, the claim of exemption will be barred in the absence of a showing of
a change in circumstances occurring after the expiration of the time for
claiming exemptions.  CCP §484.070(a); Bank
of America, supra, 207 Cal.App.3d at 268 (plaintiff’s failure to
oppose exemption claim concedes its propriety). 
This waiver applies only to personal property.  Thus, a homestead exemption for a dwelling is
not waived by failing to make a claim for exemption.  Martom v. Aboyan, (1983) 148
Cal.App.3d 826, 831.
            The
defendant also may obtain a determination at the hearing whether real or
personal property not described in the application or real
property described in the application is exempt from attachment by including an
exemption claim for such property in the notice of opposition/separate claim of
exemption.  The defendant’s failure to
claim such property as exempt does not preclude the defendant from raising the
issue at a later time.  CCP
§484.070(b).  The claim of exemption
shall (1) describe the property claimed to be exempt, and (2) specify the
statute section supporting the claim. 
CCP §484.070(c).  The claim of
exemption shall be accompanied by an affidavit supporting any factual issues
raised by the claim and points and authorities supporting any legal issues
raised.  CCP §484.070(d).  The defendant must file and serve the claim
of exemption and supporting papers not less than five court days before the
date set for the hearing.  CCP
§484.070(e).
            
            a. Amount Necessary to Support a Family
            The property exempt from
attachment includes property which is necessary for the support of a defendant
who is a natural person or the family of such defendant supported in whole or
in part by the defendant.¿ CCP §487.020(b).
            Property
which is necessary for the support of a defendant who is a natural person or the family of such defendant supported in whole or in
part by the defendant may be exempt. CCP §487.020(b).  All property of the
defendant is considered when determining the needs of the defendant, his
spouse, and his dependents.  CCP §703.115.  Where property is claimed
exempt pursuant to a provision exempting property necessary of the support of
the claimant and the claimant’s family, “the claim of exemption shall include a
financial statement” which “shall be executed under oath by the [claimant]…”
CCP §703.530.  The financial statement must detail the names, ages,
relationships, earnings, income, assets, and outstanding obligations of all
members of the family.  CCP §703.530.
            Steimann has provided a
financial statement showing monthly expenses of $38,180.19 per month, or $458,162.28 per year, to support himself and his
four-person household.  Steimann Decl.,
¶6, Ex. A.  Of this amount, $2,500 per
month ($30,000 per year) is for legal fees to defend this lawsuit.  Steimann Decl., ¶6, Ex. A.  Such legal fees must be considered as
necessary for support for attachment law to pass constitutional muster.  Randone v. Appellate Department,
(1971) 5 Cal.3d 536, 562.  
Steimann has not
shown that $458,162.28 per year in cash or other liquid assets is necessary
for his and his family’s support.  Guaranty
Reply at 10.  Steimann’s financial
statement is insufficiently detailed to explain his monthly expenses -- most
particularly payments of $8300 for rent or house, $20,000 in child support,
$1000 for transportation, and $250 for entertainment.  He also fails to explain how he can have
$38,180.19 in monthly expenses and only $8,872.85 in monthly income.  The exemption is disallowed.
 
            b.
Employee Compensation
            Compensation payable by an
employer to an employee for personal services performed by such employee,
whether denominated as wages, salary, commission, bonus, or otherwise, is exempt
from attachment.  CCP §487.020(c); CCP §706.011(b).
            Steimann’s
financing statement lists gross monthly wages of $12,500.  Steimann Decl., ¶7, Ex. A.  Steimann does not show who his employer is,
what his job title is, or provide any documentary support for his employee
compensation.  The exemption is denied. 
 
            c. Vehicles
            As of January 1,
2023, the aggregate equity in motor vehicles is exempt up to $7,500.  CCP §704.010(a).
            Steimann’s
financing statement shows he owns three vehicles.  He claims that a 1973 Chevy Blazer is worth $50,000.  Steimann Decl., ¶8, Ex. A.  This seems unlikely, but the value of the
vehicles exceeds the $7,500 maximum exemption for a vehicle anyway.  The exemption is granted.
 
            E. Conclusion
            The
applications for right to attach orders are granted against Defendants Unrivaled
and Steimann in the amount of $495,595.  Steimann’s exemptions for property necessary
for the support of his family and for employee wages are disallowed.  A $7,500 vehicle exemption is granted.  No writ shall issue for either Defendant until
Landlord posts a $10,000 undertaking for that Defendant.
