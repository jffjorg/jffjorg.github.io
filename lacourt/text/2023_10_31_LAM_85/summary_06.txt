And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a request by Smith for judicial notice of certain documents, including HA's Administrative Plan, a joint statement by the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Department of Justice, and declarations by Smith, Jessica, and Rachel Steinback. The judge grants the request for judicial notice of the Administrative Plan and the joint statement, but denies the request for judicial notice of the declarations. The declarations are not relevant to the case and do not meet the criteria for judicial notice.

The judge also notes that the witnesses at the Commission hearing were not sworn under oath, and that the declaration by Smith and Jessica contains a handwritten note that is contradicted by Jessica's admission at the hearing. The judge finds that Smith failed to provide any evidence to substantiate her reasonable accommodation claim and that HA's denial of reasonable accommodation did not find that Smith committed fraud.

Finally, the judge notes that Smith did not show that the December 12, 2022 hearing was required to be recorded, and that the lack of a recording does not alter the fact that Smith failed to provide any evidence to substantiate her reasonable accommodation claim.
