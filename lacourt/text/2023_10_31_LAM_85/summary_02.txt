And here is the English text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling addresses Miller's objection to the court's notice. The Judge notes that Miller failed to lodge a courtesy copy of her objection in violation of the Presiding Judge's First Amended General Order Re: Mandatory Electronic Filing, and admonishes her counsel to provide courtesy copies in all future filings. The Judge also denies Miller's request for judicial notice, as Miller failed to file a separate document requesting judicial notice. Additionally, the Judge finds that Miller did not present evidence that she did not know about her claim to attorney's fees at the time of the plea hearing, and therefore, her request for attorney's fees is not justified.
