 Case Number:  23STCV02333    Hearing Date:   October 31, 2023    Dept:  85 
Daimler Trust v. Elgrid Ovasapyan,
et al., 23STCV02333
 
 
Tentative decision on applications
for writs of possession: granted
 



            
            Plaintiff
Daimler Trust, as serviced by its attorney-in-fact, Mercedes-Benz Financial
Services USA LLC (“Daimler”) seeks a writ of possession against Defendants Viktor
Kachura (“Kachura”), Comfort Cars (“Comfort”), and VA Collision LLC (“VA”) to
recover a 2020 Mercedes-Benz C300, Serial No. WIKWF8DB8LR599416 (the “Vehicle”).   
            The
court has read and considered the moving papers (no opposition was filed) and
renders the following tentative decision. 
 
            A. Statement of the Case
            1.
Complaint
            Plaintiff
Daimler commenced this proceeding on January 24, 2023 against Defendants
Salazar, E&L, and Elgrid Ovasapyan (“Ovasapyan”) alleging cause of actions
for (1) breach of contract, (2) common count, (3) claim & delivery, and (4)
conversion.  The operative pleading is
the First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) filed July 26, 2023, against Ovasapyan, Kachura,
Comfort, and VA, alleging the same causes of action.  The FAC alleges in pertinent part as follows.

            On
December 11, 2020, Ovasapyan and Keyes European (“Dealer”) executed a written
Motor Vehicle Lease Agreement (“Agreement”) for Ovasapyan to lease the Vehicle.  Pursuant to the Agreement,
Ovasapyan was required to pay 36 monthly
installments of $503.42.  Dealer assigned
its rights under the Agreement to Daimler, which perfected its interest through
a Certificate of Title filed with the Department of Motor Vehicles (“DMV”).
            On
February 11, 2022 and thereafter, Ovasapyan defaulted for failure to pay the required monthly installment.  Daimler chose to accelerate the amount owed.  
            Daimler received notice that Salazar
and E&L had possession of the Vehicle.  After filing the Complaint, Daimler learned
that E&L was not in possession of the Vehicle, VA is.  Daimler dismissed E&L from the action.
            VA
and Kachura have possession of the Vehicle. 
Kachura has confirmed his possession and allowed Daimler to inspect the Vehicle.  Because the Agreement includes a Vehicle
Location Consent, Daimler has used GPS data to track the Vehicle to storage
with Comfort.
            VA,
Kachura, and Comfort did not seek approval to take possession and store the
Vehicle or to incur storage and repair fees. 
Daimler has attempted to negotiate the release of the Vehicle and
offered Kachura $2,750 for storage and repairs, but Kachura refused the
offer.  Per Civil Code section 3068, his
lien is extinguished. 
            Daimler seeks from Defendant Ovasapyan $41,276.22, plus taxes and late charges from and after June
9, 2022.  From all Defendants, Daimler
also seeks return and possession of the Vehicle or the actual value of the Vehicle.  Daimler further seeks conversion, exemplary,
and punitive damages according to proof, with attorney’s fees and costs.
 
            2.

            On
February 16, 2023, Daimler served Defendant Salazar with the Complaint, Summons,

            On
August 22, 2023, Daimler served VA and Kachura with the FAC, Summons, and
moving papers by substitute service, effective September 1, 2023.
            
            B.
Applicable Law
            A
writ of possession is issued as a provisional remedy in a cause of action for
claim and delivery, also known as replevin. 
See Pillsbury, Madison
& Sutro v. Schectman, (1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 1279, 1288.  As a provisional remedy, the right to
possession is only temporary, and title and the right to possess are determined
in the final judgment.  
            A
writ of possession is available in any pending action.  It also is available where an action has been
stayed pending arbitration, so long as the arbitration award may be ineffectual
without provisional relief.  See CCP §1281.7. 
 
            1. Procedure
            Upon
the filing of the complaint or at any time thereafter, a plaintiff may apply
for an order for a writ of possession. 
Unlike attachment, where Judicial Council forms are optional, the
parties must use the mandatory approved Judicial Council forms in a claim and
delivery proceeding.  (Judicial Council
Forms CD-100 et seq.).
            A
plaintiff must make a written application for a writ of possession.  CCP §512.010(a), (b); (Mandatory Form
CD-100); CCP §512.010(a).  A verified
complaint alone is insufficient.  6
Witkin, California Procedure, (5th ed. 2008) §255, p.203.  The application may be supported by
declarations and/or a verified complaint. 
CCP §516.030.  The declarations or
complaint must set forth admissible evidence except where expressly permitted
to be shown on information and belief.  Id.
            The
application must be executed under oath and include: (1) A showing of the basis
of the plaintiff's claim and that the plaintiff is entitled to possession of
the property claimed.  If the plaintiff's
claim is based on a written instrument, a copy of it must be attached; (2) A
showing that the property is wrongfully detained by the defendant, how the
defendant came into possession of it, and, the reasons for the detention based
on the plaintiff’s best knowledge, information, and belief; (3) A specific description
of the property and statement of its value; (4) The location of the property
according to the plaintiff’s best knowledge, information, and belief.  If the property, or some part of it, is
within a private place which may have to be entered to take possession, a
showing of probable cause to believe that the property is located there; and
(5) A statement that the property has not been taken for (a) a tax, assessment,
or fine, pursuant to a statute, or (b) an execution against the plaintiff’s
property.  Alternatively, a statement
that if the property was seized for one of these purposes, it is by statute
exempt from such seizure.  CCP
§512.010(b).
 
            2. The Hearing
            Before
noticing a hearing, the plaintiff must serve the defendant with all of the
following: (1) A copy of the summons and complaint; (2) A Notice of Application
and Hearing; and (3) A copy of the application and any supporting declaration.  CCP §512.030(a).  If the defendant has not appeared in the
action, service must be made in the same manner as service of summons and
complaint.  CCP §512.030(b).
            Each
party shall file with the court and serve upon the other party any declarations
and points and authorities intended to be relied upon at the hearing.  CCP §512.050. 
At the hearing, the court decides the merits of the application based on
the pleadings and declarations.   Id.  Upon a showing of good cause, the court may
receive and consider additional evidence and authority presented at the
hearing, or may continue the hearing for the production of such additional
evidence, oral or documentary, or the filing of other affidavits or points and
authorities.  Id.  
            The
court may order issuance of a writ of possession if both of the following are
found: (1) The plaintiff has established the probable validity of the
plaintiff’s claim to possession of the property; and (2) The undertaking
requirements of CCP section 515.010 are satisfied.  CCP §512.060(a).  “A claim has ‘probable validity’ where it is
more likely than not that the plaintiff will obtain a judgment against the
defendant on that claim.”  CCP
§511.090.  This requires that the
plaintiff establish a prima facie case; the writ shall not issue if the
defendant shows a reasonable probability of a successful defense to the claim
and delivery cause of action.  Witkin,
California Procedure, (5th ed. 2008) §261, p.208.  A defendant’s claim of defect in the property
is not a defense to the plaintiff’s right to possess it.  RCA Service Co. v. Superior Court,
(1982) 137 Cal.App.3d 1, 3.
            No
writ directing the levying officer to enter a private place to take possession
of any property may be issued unless the plaintiff has established that there
is probable cause to believe that the property is located there.  CCP §512.060(b).  
            The
successful plaintiff may obtain a preliminary injunction containing the same
provisions as a TRO that remains in effect until the property is seized by the
levying officer.[1]  CCP §513.010(c).  
            The
court may also issue a “turnover order” directing the defendant to transfer
possession of the property to the plaintiff (See Mandatory Form CD-120). 
The order must notify the defendant that failure to comply may subject
him or her to contempt of court.  CCP
§512.070.  The turnover remedy is not
issued in lieu of a writ, but in conjunction with it to provide the plaintiff
with a less expensive means of obtaining possession.  See
Edwards v Superior Court, (1991) 230 Cal.App.3d 173, 178.
 
            3. The Plaintiff’s Undertaking
            Generally,
the court cannot issue an order for a writ of possession until the plaintiff
has filed an undertaking with the court (Mandatory Form CD-140 for personal
sureties).  CCP §515.010(a).  The undertaking shall provide that the
sureties are bound to the defendant for the return of the property to the
defendant, if return of the property is ordered, and for the payment to the
defendant of any sum recovered against the plaintiff.  Id. 
The undertaking shall be in an amount not less than twice the value of
the defendant's interest in the property or in a greater amount.  Id. 
The value of the defendant's interest in the property is determined by
the market value of the property less the amount due and owing on any
conditional sales contract or security agreement and all liens and encumbrances
on the property, and any other factors necessary to determine the defendant’s
interest in the property.  Id.
            However,
where the defendant has no interest in the property, the court must waive the
requirement of the plaintiff’s undertaking and include in the order for
issuance of the writ the amount of the defendant’s undertaking sufficient to
satisfy the requirements of CCP section 515.020(b).  CCP §515.010(b). 
 
            C. Statement of Facts
            On December
11, 2020, Ovasapyan and Dealer entered into the Agreement for Ovasapyan to lease
the Vehicle and make 36 monthly installments of $503.42.  Azubogu Decl., ¶¶ 11-12, Ex. 1.  In the event of default, the Agreement gave Dealer
the right to accelerate the amount owed and repossess the Vehicle without prior
warning, except required by law.  Azubogu
Decl., ¶¶ 11, 17, Ex. 1.  The Lease also
included a clause for Vehicle Location Consent, which authorized Dealer in the
event of default to use any data recorders on the Vehicle to find it.  Azubogu Decl., ¶¶ 11, 21, Ex. 1.  
            Dealer assigned the Agreement to Daimler.  Azubogu Decl., ¶13, Ex. 1.  Daimler perfected its interest in the Vehicle
by listing itself as the lienholder on the Certificate of Title.  Azubogu Decl., ¶13, Ex. 2.
            On February 11, 2022 and thereafter, Ovasapyan defaulted on the Agreement by
failing to pay the required monthly installment.  Azubogu Decl., ¶15.  Daimler accelerated the amount owed.  Azubogu Decl., ¶15.  Ovasapyan has not complied with demands for
payment.  Azubogu Decl., ¶16.  As of October 3, 2022, the pay-off quote
lists the amount owed as $41,276.22.  Azubogu
Decl., ¶16, Ex. 3.  
            After Daimler made a demand for
payment, Ovasapyan informed it that he had transferred the Vehicle to
E&L.  Azubogu Decl., ¶18.  On October 3, 2022, the DMV informed Daimler
that E&L has not filed for authorization to conduct a lien sale.  Caley Decl., ¶6.  No active application for authorization to
conduct a lien sale was pending.  Caley
Decl., ¶6.  
            On October 4, 2022, counsel for
Daimler spoke with Kachura, who confirmed that E&L has been in possession
of the Vehicle since April 7, 2022. 
Caley Decl., ¶4.  He also
presented an April 20, 2022 preliminary estimate showing $19,357.01 in repair
fees for the Vehicle.  Caley Decl., ¶4,
Ex. 7.  Counsel for Daimler offered the
$2,750 maximum in repair and storage fees under Civil Code section
3068(c)(1).  Caley Decl., ¶5.  Kachura refused the offer.  Caley Decl.,
¶5.  Daimler made the offer again on
October 24, 2022, but Kachura refused it again and demanded $27,000.  Caley Decl., ¶7.  
            After Daimler filed the Complaint,
it learned that VA had the Vehicle.  Azubogu
Decl., ¶19.  Daimler dismissed E&L
from this action.  Azubogu Decl., ¶19.  On March 27, 2023, counsel for Daimler met
with Kachura.  Caley Decl., ¶9.  He stated that the Vehicle had been moved
three times and was now in VA’s possession at Monterrey Park.  Caley Decl., ¶9.  
            On April 17, 2023, Daimler met with Kachura.  Azubogu Decl., ¶20.  Kachura had the Vehicle available for
inspection but would not release it without payment for repairs.  Azubogu Decl., ¶20, Ex. 5.  Kachura gave Daimler his business card, which
confirms he works for VA.  Azubogu Decl.,
¶20, Ex. 4.  The business card lists VA’s
address as 401 Monterey Pass Road, Unit H, Monterey Park, CA 91754 (“Monterey
Address”).  Azubogu Decl., ¶20, Ex. 4;
Caley Decl., ¶8.  The Secretary of State
lists Kachura’s address as 616 Saint Paul Avenue, Apt. 319A, Los Angeles, CA
90017 (“Saint Address”).  Azubogu Decl.,
¶27.
            Pursuant to the Vehicle Location
Consent, Daimler has used the Vehicle’s GPS tracking data to confirm Comfort has
stored the Vehicle at 10985 Penrose St., Unit B, Sun Valley, CA 91352 (“Penrose
Address”) as of June 10, 2023.  Azubogu
Decl., ¶¶ 21, 27.
            VA,
Kachura, and Comfort did not seek approval to take possession and store the
Vehicle or to incur storage and repair fees. 
Azubogu Decl., ¶22.  Kachura has failed to provide a repair order
for the repairs completed on the Vehicle. 
Caley Decl., ¶9.  He has refused
the statutory offer under Civil Code section 3068(c)(1).  Caley Decl., ¶9; Azubogu Decl., ¶23.  VA also failed to apply to the DMV for
authorization to conduct a lien sale within 30 days of the lien’s
commencement.  Azubogu
Decl., ¶24.  Per Civil Code
section 3068(c)(1), VA’s lien is extinguished. 
Azubogu Decl., ¶24.  Demands for VA and Kachura to release the
Vehicle have failed.  Azubogu Decl., ¶¶
25-26.
            The Vehicle is at either the Saint,
Monterey, or Penrose Addresses.  Azubogu
Decl., ¶27.  Daimler requests that the
writs of possession authorize the levying officer to demand entry, break locks,
and charge in to these properties if Defendants refuse entry.  Azubogu Decl., ¶27.  
            As of July 12, 2023, the Kelley Blue
Book lists the average purchase and listing prices of the Vehicle as $33,805
and $35,305, respectively.  Azubogu Decl.,
¶28, Ex. 6.[2]  Ovasapyan owes more
and has no equity interest in the Vehicle. 
Azubogu Decl., ¶¶ 16, 29.  Daimler
requests the court require a $42,000 redelivery bond from Ovasapyan, which
includes both the account balance and an estimated $1,000 in attorney’s fees
and costs.  Azubogu Decl., ¶29.
            Because VA alleges a $19,357.01
interest in the Vehicle, Daimler is prepared to post a $40,000
undertaking.  Azubogu Decl., ¶30.  Daimler requests the court require a $42,000
redelivery bond from VA to reflect Daimler’s undertaking under CCP section
515.010(a).  Azubogu Decl., ¶30.
 
            D. Analysis
            Plaintiff
Daimler applies for a writ of possession for
the Vehicle against Defendants VA, Kachura, and Comfort.
 
            1.
Merits
            a.
The Lease
            Daimler
presents evidence that Ovasapyan entered into
the Agreement to lease the Vehicle, and the Agreement entitled Dealer to
accelerate the outstanding balance and repossess the Vehicle in the event of
default.  Azubogu Decl., ¶¶ 11, 13, 17,
Ex. 1.  
            Dealer assigned the Agreement to
Daimler.  Azubogu Decl., ¶13, Ex. 1.  Daimler perfected its interest in the Vehicle
by listing itself as the lienholder on the Certificate of Title.  Azubogu Decl., ¶13, Ex. 2.
Daimler provides evidence that
Ovasapyan defaulted and owes $41,276.22.  Azubogu Decl., ¶¶ 15-16, Ex. 3.  This evidence is presented only as a summary
with a supporting payoff quote (Azuboga Decl., Ex. 3), which is
inadequate.  The declaration must
be set forth with particularity. 
CCP §516.030.  This means that the
plaintiff must show evidentiary facts rather than the ultimate facts commonly
found in pleadings.  A recitation of
conclusions without a foundation of evidentiary facts is insufficient.  See Rodes v. Shannon, (1961)
194 Cal.App.2d 743, 749 (declaration containing conclusions inadequate for
summary judgment); Schessler v. Keck, (1956) 138 Cal.App.2d 663, 669
(same).  
Despite this failure, the debt of $41,276.22 pertains only
to Ovasapyan, who is in default.  As the debt exceeds the current value of $35,305, Ovasapyan
does not have a legal interest in the Vehicle. 
Azubogu Decl., ¶28, Ex. 6.  
 
            b.
The Mechanic’s Lien
            Daimler
presents evidence that the body shop E&L, and its owner Salazar, at one
point possessed the Vehicle.  Caley
Decl., ¶4.  An E&L
repair estimate asserts total repair fees of $19,357.01.  Caley Decl., ¶4, Ex. 7.  Kachura later told
Daimler that VA holds the Vehicle.  Caley
Decl., ¶9.  Kachura allowed Daimler to
inspect the Vehicle in April 2023 but would not release it without payment for
repairs.  Azubogu Decl., ¶20, Ex. 5.  
            A
person performing repairs has a lien on a vehicle for the services and for
storage subject to limitations.  Civil
Code §3068(a).  The lien arises after a
written statement for charges is given to the vehicle’s registered owner or 15
days after the work or services are completed. 
Ibid.  
            A
lien in excess of $1500 for work performed, and in excess of $1025 for any
storage of a vehicle, is invalid unless written consent of the vehicle’s legal
owner or lessor was obtained before the work was performed or the storage
occurred.  Civil Code §3068(c)(1).  The maximum lien for storage of the vehicle
increases to $1,250 if an application for an authorization to conduct a lien
sale has been filed within 30 days after the commencement of the storage or
safekeeping.  Id.  The term “legal owner” is defined as a person
holding a security interest in a vehicle which is subject to UCC.  Civil Code §3067; Vehicle Code §370.   The lien shall be extinguished if the body
shop rejects an offer by the vehicle’s legal owner or lessor of the statutory
amount for payment of the mechanic’s lien for repair and/or storage of the
vehicle.  Universal CIT Credit Corp.
v. Rater, (1963) 214 Cal.App.2d 493, 495.
            Daimler learned VA had possession of the Vehicle in March
2023.  Caley Decl., ¶9.  VA, Kachura, and Comfort did not seek
approval to take possession and store the Vehicle or to incur storage and
repair fees.  Azubogu
Decl., ¶22.  Daimler offered Kachura and
VA the statutory maximum repair and storage charges of $2,750, which was
refused.  Mem. at 3; Caley Decl., ¶9; Azubogu Decl., ¶23.  VA’s lien is extinguished.  
A lien also is extinguished unless the lienholder either
applies to the DMV for an authorization to conduct the sale or files a court
action within 30 days after the lien arises. 
Civil Code §3068(b)(1)(A).  The
lienholder shall apply to the DMV for authorization to conduct a liens sale for
any vehicle with a value more than $4000. 
Civil Code §3071(a).  For a
vehicle valued at $4000 or less, the lienholder shall apply to the DMV for the
names and addresses of the registered and legal owners and notify them of a
pending lien sale.  Civil Code §3071(a),
(b).  If the DMV receives a timely
Declaration of Opposition form, it shall notify the lienholder within 16 days
of receipt of the form that a lien sale shall not be conducted unless the
lienholder files an action in court within 30 days of the DMV’s notice.  Civil Code §3071(d).  Any lien sale shall be void if the lienholder
does not comply with this requirement. 
Civil Code §3071(l).
Neither E&L nor VA
has applied to the DMV for authorization to conduct a lien sale.  Mem. at 5-6; Azubogu
Decl., ¶24; Caley Decl., ¶6.  Kachura, a VA employee, refused to release
the Vehicle based on outstanding repair fees in April 2023.  Azubogu Decl., ¶20, Exs. 4-5.  By July 2023, the 30-day period to apply to conduct
a lien sale had expired.  VA’s lien also is
extinguished under Civil Code section 3068(b)(1)(A).  
 
            c. Comfort’s Possession
            Daimler used the Vehicle’s GPS
tracking data to confirm that Comfort has stored the Vehicle at the Penrose
Address as of June 10, 2023.  Azubogu
Decl., ¶¶ 21, 27.  No evidence suggests
that Comfort assessed storage or repair fees against the Vehicle.  Why Comfort came to possess the
Vehicle is unclear, it has no right to do so. 

 
            2. Order to Enter Private
Property
            No writ directing the levying
officer to enter a private place to take possession of any property may be
issued unless the plaintiff has established that there is probable cause to
believe that the property is located there.  CCP §512.060(b).  
            Daimler
asserts that it used the Vehicle’s GPS tracking data to confirm Comfort has
stored the Vehicle at the Penrose Address as of June 10, 2023.  Azubogu Decl., ¶¶ 21, 27.  
Daimler also suggests the
Vehicle could also be at the Saint Address, Kachura’s address according to the
Secretary of State.  Azubogu Decl.,
¶27.  Daimler fails to provide documents
from the Secretary of State to support this argument.  Because no opposition is on file, this defect
is waived.  
            Daimler further suggests the Vehicle could be at the Monterey Address. 
Azubogu Decl., ¶27.  Kachura’s
business card for VA lists this address. 
Azubogu Decl., ¶20, Ex. 4; Caley Decl., ¶8.  Kachura gave this card to Daimler the same
day he brought the Vehicle for inspection, only to demand payment on VA’s
behalf before he would release it. 
Azubogu Decl., ¶20, Ex. 4.  
None of these locations
appears to be a private address, but if it is the levying officer may enter the
address to recover the Vehicle.
 
            3. Undertaking
            The undertaking shall be in an
amount not less than twice the value of the defendant's interest in the
property or in a greater amount.  CCP §515.010(a).  
            Daimler
says it will file an undertaking of $40,000, more than double the $19,357.01 lien
VA asserts for repair and storage fees. 
Mem. at 7; Azubogu Decl., ¶30.   Daimler
does not need to do so.  The lien is extinguished
and VA, Kachura, and Comfort have no legal interest
in the Vehicle.  Therefore, no
undertaking is required.  CCP
§515.010(b).
 
            4.
Redelivery
            A
defendant may prevent the plaintiff from taking possession of property pursuant
to a writ of possession or regain possession of property so taken by filing the
appropriate redelivery bond with the court. 
CCP §515.020(a).  This redelivery
bond is equal to a plaintiff’s undertaking, if one is required.  Id. 
If not, a defendant’s redelivery undertaking shall state that if the
plaintiff recovers judgment on the action, the defendant shall pay all costs
awarded to the plaintiff and all damages that the plaintiff may sustain by
reason of the loss of possession of the property.  CCP §§ 515.010(b), 515.020(b).  
            Daimler
asserts
that Ovasapyan should be required to post a $42,000 redelivery bond
to reflect both his account balance and an estimated
$1,000 in attorney’s fees and costs.  Azubogu
Decl., ¶29; Mem. at 8.  A redelivery bond is only necessary to
prevent taking pursuant to a writ of possession.  Because Daimler does not apply for a writ of
possession against Ovasapyan, Ovasapyan does not need to post a redelivery
bond.
            Daimler
asserts
that the redelivery bond for VA and Kachura should be $42,000 should it seek to
prevent Daimler from taking possession of the Vehicle.  Mem. at 8. 
Daimler cites CCP section 515.020(a), which sets a defendant’s
redelivery undertaking at an amount equal to the amount of the plaintiff’s
undertaking.  Mem. at 8; CCP
§515.020(a).  Because Daimler owes no
undertaking, this provision does not apply.
            If
the court finds that the defendant has no interest in the property, a
defendant’s redelivery undertaking shall state that, if the plaintiff recovers
judgment on the action, the defendant shall pay all costs awarded to the
plaintiff and all damages that the plaintiff may sustain by reason of the loss
of possession of the property.  CCP §§
515.010(b), 515.020(b).  Daimler does not
discuss what VA’s redelivery bond should be under this standard.  However, Daimler’s damages from loss of
possession of the Vehicle cannot exceed the Vehicle’s value, which is $36,769.  Azubogu Decl., ¶28, Ex. 6. 
Although Daimler asserts that its attorney’s fees and costs will total
$1,000, its counsel does not provide this estimate and such fees are disallowed
for purposes of calculating the redelivery bond.  See Azubogu Decl., ¶29.  VA’s and Kachura’s redelivery bond shall be
the $36,769 value of the Vehicle.[3]
 
            E.
Conclusion
            The
application for writ of possession is granted.  No undertaking is required.  The redelivery bond shall be $36,769.   The levying officer may enter the Penrose,
Saint, and Monterey Addresses as well as any public or commercial address.
