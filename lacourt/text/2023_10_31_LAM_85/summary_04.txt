And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the case and is issuing a tentative ruling. The judge notes that DOSH has joined the Board's opposition, but finds that the joinder was timely and supported by a short memorandum. The judge also notes that Atkinson filed a 12-page reply brief, despite only being granted leave to file a 13-page brief, and admonishes Atkinson's counsel to follow the court's directions in the future.

The judge finds that there is substantial evidence of a violation, including Honjio's testimony that the road collapsed due to the weight of the forklift. The judge dismisses Atkinson's argument that the violation was not Accident-Related because it was not Serious, finding that the evidence does not support this conclusion.

The judge grants the Board's request for judicial notice of its decisions in three cases, and denies Atkinson's requests for relief. The judge's tentative ruling will be subject to revision based on further submissions and oral argument.
