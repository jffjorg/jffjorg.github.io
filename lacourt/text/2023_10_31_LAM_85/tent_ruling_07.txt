 Case Number:  22STCV28721    Hearing Date:   October 31, 2023    Dept:  85 
1st Source Bank v. Screamline
Investment Corporation, et al., 22STCV28721
 
 
Tentative decision on application
for a preliminary injunction: granted
 



            
            
Plaintiff 1st Source Bank (“Bank”) applies for a preliminary
injunction enjoining Defendants Screamline Investment Corporation
(“Screamline”), Starline Tours of Hollywood, Inc. (“Starline”), Shoeleh Sapir
(“Shoeleh”), Vahid Sapir (“Vahid”), and Karmouz Farhadi (“Farhadi”) from
transferring any interest in 2018 MCI J4500 Intercity Vehicles, VIN Nos.
2MG3JMBA4JW068842, 2MG3JMBA6JW068843, and 2MG3JMBA8JW068844 (collectively, “Vehicles”),
disposing or encumbering them, concealing them as to make them less available
to seizure by a levying officer, impairing their value, or disposing of proceeds
from the transfer of any interest in them.  
            The
court has read and considered the moving papers, opposition, and reply,[1] and
renders the following tentative decision. 
 
            A. Statement of the Case
            1.
Complaint
            Plaintiff
Bank filed this action on September 2, 2022, alleging (1) breach of contract,
(2) four causes of action for enforcement of guaranty, (3) claim and delivery,
(4) injunctive relief, (5) conversion, (6) unjust enrichment, (7) account
stated, and (8) open book account. The Complaint alleges as follows.
            On
June 6, 2018, Bank and Screamline executed a Loan and Security Agreement (“Loan
Agreement”) whereby the Bank agreed to lend money for purchase of the Vehicles,
which would then be collateral securing the loan.  The parties also executed a Promissory Note (“Note”)
for the principal amount owed.  
Starline, Farhadi, Shoeleh, and Vahid (collectively,
“Guarantors”) executed separate Guaranties of Payment (“Guaranty”) for all sums
owed by Screamline, including costs and attorneys’ fees incurred in the
collection thereof and the enforcement of the Guaranties.
            On
April 7 and July 3, 2020, Bank and Screamline entered into Amendment Agreements
modifying the terms of the Loan Agreement and Note (collectively, the Loan
Agreement, Note, and Amendment Agreements are referred to as the “Loan
Documents”).  
            Bank
has perfected its first priority interest in the Vehicles through a Certificate
of Title for each Vehicle.
            On
May 31 and June 16, 2022, Bank gave notice to Screamline and Guarantors that Screamline
had defaulted.  It demanded payment of
the delinquent amounts under the Loan Documents or turnover of the
Vehicles.  
On June 29, 2022, Bank gave notice to Screamline and
Guarantors that it was accelerating the balance due under the Loan Documents
and demanding turnover of the Vehicles.
            As
of August 9, 2022, Screamline owes $971,409.28 plus accrued and
unpaid interest, reasonable attorneys’ fees, and other sums.  Demands for repayment and turnover of the
Vehicles have failed.
            Bank
seeks (1) $971,409.28, plus accrued and unpaid interest, reasonable attorney’s
fees and costs, and other sums against Defendants, (2) recovery of the Vehicles, or present value thereof if recovery
cannot be had, (3) a writ of possession for the Vehicles, and (4) injunctive
relief enjoining Defendants from
concealing or transferring possession of the Vehicles.
 
            2.
Cross-Complaint
            Cross-Complainants
Screamline and Guarantors filed a Cross-Complaint on April 13,
2023, alleging breach of contract and declaratory relief.  The Cross-Complaint alleges in pertinent part
as follows.
            On
June 12, 2018, Screamline borrowed $1,433,396.01 from Bank through the Note.  Guarantors signed separate Guaranties for all
amounts Screamline owed under the Note.
            In
March 2020, because COVID-19 and related shutdown orders had impacted business,
Bank and Screamline entered an agreement to amend the Note’s repayment terms.  Bank then abandoned the repayment terms of
the Note, and Screamline made payments as financial circumstances permitted.
            On
June 29, 2022, Bank purported to call the Note to be paid in full and falsely
demanded $1,427,208.04, which Screamline does not actually owe.  Other communications show that Bank made this
demand in bad faith.  
            Bank
has added false charges to the claimed amount owed and has failed to honor its
representations and course of conduct.  It has not complied with the March 2020 amendments
to accept and credit irregular payments towards the Note to reduce the
principal balance owed.
            Cross-Complainants
seek (1) $2,000,000 plus pre-judgment interest, (2) injunctive, restitutionary,
accounting, and declaratory relief, and (3) attorney’s fees and costs.
 
            3.
Course of Proceedings
            On
March 10, 2023, the court denied Bank’s ex parte application for a writ
of possession, turnover order, and temporary restraining order (“TRO”).
            On
March 14, 2023, Bank withdrew another ex parte application for a writ of
possession, turnover order, and TRO.  
            On
March 16, 2023, the court denied the Bank’s ex parte application for a
writ of possession, turnover order, and TRO.
            On
March 24, 2023, Department 50 (Hon. Teresa Beaudet) sustained Defendants’
demurrer to the Complaint’s seventh and ninth causes of action without leave to
amend.
            On
April 13, 2023, Cross-Complainants filed and served the Cross-Complaint and an
Answer to the Complaint.
            On
May 19, 2023, Bank filed an Answer to the Cross-Complaint.
            On
August 31, 2023, Department 50 dismissed the action without prejudice for all
Does.
            On
September 12, 2023, this court granted a writ of possession to recover the
Vehicles against Screamline but denied it as to all other Defendants.  It stayed execution of the writ until
September 19, 2023 to provide time for an appraisal of the Vehicles and
stipulation to modify the writ and require an undertaking.
            On
October 2, 2023, this court granted Bank’s application for a temporary
restraining order (“TRO”) and order to show cause re: preliminary injunction (“OSC”)
to enjoin Defendants from transferring any interest in the Vehicles, disposing
or encumbering them, concealing them as to make them less available to seizure
by a levying officer, impairing their value, or disposing of proceeds from the
transfer of any interest in them.  
 
            B.
Applicable Law
            An
injunction is a writ or order requiring a person to refrain from a particular
act; it may be granted by the court in which the action is brought, or by a
judge thereof; and when granted by a judge, it may be enforced as an order of
the court.  Code of Civil Procedure
(“CCP”) §525.  An injunction may be more
completely defined as a writ or order commanding a person either to perform or
to refrain from performing a particular act. 
See Comfort v. Comfort, (1941) 17 Cal.2d 736, 741. McDowell
v. Watson, (1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 1155, 1160.[2]  It is an equitable remedy available generally
in the protection or to prevent the invasion of a legal right.  Meridian, Ltd. v. City and County of San
Francisco, et al., (1939) 13 Cal.2d 424.
            The
purpose of a preliminary injunction is to preserve the status quo
pending final resolution upon a trial.  See
Scaringe v. J.C.C. Enterprises, Inc., (1988) 205 Cal.App.3d 1536. Grothe
v. Cortlandt Corp., (1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 1313, 1316; Major v. Miraverde
Homeowners Assn., (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 618, 623.  The status quo has been defined to
mean the last actual peaceable, uncontested status which preceded the pending
controversy.  Voorhies v. Greene
(1983) 139 Cal.App.3d 989, 995, quoting United Railroads v. Superior Court,
(1916) 172 Cal. 80, 87. 14859 Moorpark Homeowner’s Assn. v. VRT Corp.,
(1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 1396. 1402.
            A
preliminary injunction is issued after hearing on a noticed motion.  The complaint normally must plead injunctive
relief.  CCP §526(a)(1)-(2).[3]  Preliminary injunctive relief requires the
use of competent evidence to create a sufficient factual showing on the grounds
for relief.  See e.g. Ancora-Citronelle
Corp. v. Green, (1974) 41 Cal.App.3d 146, 150.  Injunctive relief may be granted based on a
verified complaint only if it contains sufficient evidentiary, not ultimate,
facts.  See CCP §527(a).  For this reason, a pleading alone rarely
suffices.  Weil & Brown, California
Procedure Before Trial, 9:579, 9(ll)-21 (The Rutter Group 2007).  The burden of proof is on the plaintiff as
moving party.  O’Connell v. Superior
Court, (2006) 141 Cal.App.4th 1452, 1481. 
            A
plaintiff seeking injunctive relief must show the absence of an adequate
damages remedy at law.  CCP §526(4); Thayer
Plymouth Center, Inc. v. Chrysler Motors, (1967) 255 Cal.App.2d 300, 307; Department
of Fish & Game v. Anderson-Cottonwood Irrigation Dist., (1992) 8
Cal.App.4th 1554, 1565.  The concept of
“inadequacy of the legal remedy” or “inadequacy of damages” dates from the time
of the early courts of chancery, the idea being that an injunction is an
unusual or extraordinary equitable remedy which will not be granted if the
remedy at law (usually damages) will adequately compensate the injured
plaintiff.  Department of Fish &
Game v. Anderson-Cottonwood Irrigation Dist., (1992) 8 Cal.App.4th 1554,
1565.
            In
determining whether to issue a preliminary injunction, the trial court
considers two factors: (1) the reasonable probability that the plaintiff will
prevail on the merits at trial (CCP §526(a)(1)), and (2) a balancing of the
“irreparable harm” that the plaintiff is likely to sustain if the injunction is
denied as compared to the harm that the defendant is likely to suffer if the
court grants a preliminary injunction. 
CCP §526(a)(2); 14859 Moorpark Homeowner’s Assn. v. VRT Corp.,
(1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 1396. 1402; Pillsbury, Madison & Sutro v.
Schectman, (1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 1279, 1283; Davenport v. Blue Cross of
California, (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 435, 446; Abrams v. St. Johns Hospital,
(1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 628, 636.  Thus, a
preliminary injunction may not issue without some showing of potential
entitlement to such relief.  Doe v.
Wilson, (1997) 57 Cal.App.4th 296, 304. 
The decision to grant a preliminary injunction generally lies within the
sound discretion of the trial court and will not be disturbed on appeal absent
an abuse of discretion.  Thornton v.
Carlson, (1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 1249, 1255.
            A
preliminary injunction ordinarily cannot take effect unless and until the
plaintiff provides an undertaking for damages which the enjoined defendant may
sustain by reason of the injunction if the court finally decides that the
plaintiff was not entitled to the injunction. 
See CCP §529(a); City of South San Francisco v. Cypress Lawn
Cemetery Assn., (1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 916, 920.
 
            C. Statement of Facts
            1. Bank’s Evidence
            On September 15, 2023, the court
entered an order for a writ of possession against Screamline for the Vehicles.  Rasheed Decl., ¶3, Ex. 1.  The order authorized entry onto 2130 South
Tubeway Avenue, Commerce, California 90040, as well as any public or commercial
address.  Rasheed Decl., ¶3, Ex. 1.  The order included a transfer order for
Screamline to transfer possession of the Vehicles, and a warning that failure
to do so may subject Screamline to contempt of the court.  Rasheed Decl., ¶¶ 3,
8, Ex. 1.  Execution of the order was
stayed until the end of the business day on September 19, 2023.  Rasheed Decl., ¶3, Ex. 1.  
            On September 19, 2023 at 5:36 p.m., Defendants’
selected appraiser, Clint Guth (“Guth”), emailed Bank’s counsel.  Rasheed Decl., ¶4, Ex. 2.  This email included a chain of emails between
Guth and Defendants regarding turnover of the Vehicles.  Rasheed Decl., ¶4, Ex. 2.  At 1:58 p.m. that day, Guth had told
Defendants that Bank wanted him to pick up the Vehicles the next day unless Defendants
wanted to deliver them to a designated location.  Rasheed Decl., ¶4, Ex. 2.  At 4:19 p.m., Defendants responded that they
needed their attorney to approve it. 
Rasheed Decl., ¶4, Ex. 2.  The
Vehicles were in the yard and Defendants did not like anyone entering it.  Rasheed Decl., ¶4, Ex. 2.  They would have the Vehicles delivered if required.  Rasheed Decl., ¶4, Ex. 2.  
            At 7:13 p.m., Bank responded that there
was nothing to discuss with Screamline’s lawyer.  Rasheed Decl., ¶4, Ex. 2.  It sounded like Screamline was refusing to
provide possession of the Vehicles by the close of the business day per the
court’s order.  Rasheed Decl., ¶4, Ex.
2.  If it did not allow Guth to pick up
the Vehicles the next morning, Bank would seek a contempt ruling against Screamline.  Rasheed Decl., ¶4, Ex. 2.  
            At 6:54 p.m., Bank informed
Screamline it was moving forward with retrieving the Vehicles.  Rasheed Decl., ¶5, Ex. 3.  At 7:01 p.m., Bank added that it had received
word that Screamline was preventing collection. 
Rasheed Decl., ¶5, Ex. 3.  The
order required Screamline to transfer possession of the Vehicles or risk being
held in contempt of court.  Rasheed
Decl., ¶5, Ex. 3.  
            On September 20, 2023 at 9:25 a.m., Bank
told Screamline to allow Guth to pick up the Vehicles that morning.  Rasheed Decl., ¶6, Ex. 4.  If Bank did not have possession of all three
that day, it would move ex parte for a TRO and contempt.  Rasheed Decl., ¶6, Ex. 4.
            At 11:56 a.m. that day, Bank sent
another email saying Screamline had not cooperated.  Rasheed Decl., ¶7, Ex. 5.  Bank therefore gave notice that it was moving
for a TRO preventing continued obstruction to Bank’s possession of the Vehicles.  Rasheed Decl., ¶7, Ex. 5.  
            Defendants have failed to deliver
possession of the Vehicles despite demand to do so.  Rasheed Decl., ¶9.  The Vehicles are located at 2130 South
Tubeway Avenue, Commerce, California. 
Rasheed Decl., ¶9.  Defendants
have not made payments on the loans for the Vehicles in over a year.  Rasheed Decl., ¶10.  Their continued possession of the Vehicles
has prevented Bank from mitigating damages. 
Rasheed Decl., ¶10.  
 
            2. Defendants’ Evidence
            On October 2, 2023, this court
granted the Bank’s ex parte application for a TRO.  Vivonia Decl., ¶2, Ex. A.  It noted that Defendants had not made any
substantive arguments against the application in its objection, which the court
overruled.  Vivonia Decl., ¶2, Ex.
A.  
 
            3. Reply Evidence[4]
            When the court granted Bank’s
application for a writ of possession on September 12, 2023, it ruled that Bank
had provided sufficient evidence via three invoices that Defendants owed at
least $997,408.03.  Rasheed
Reply Decl., ¶¶ 3-4, Exs. A-B.  
            Bank
obtained an order for writ of possession and a writ of possession.  Rasheed Reply Decl., ¶5, Exs. C-D.  The Sherriff’s Department then asked for an
amended order for writ of possession which the court signed on October 23,
2023.  Rasheed Reply Decl., ¶6, Ex. E.
 
            D. Analysis
            Plaintiff
Bank applies for a preliminary injunction enjoining
Defendants from transferring any interest in the Vehicles, disposing or
encumbering them, concealing them as to make them less available to seizure by
a levying officer, impairing their value, or disposing of proceeds from the
transfer of any interest in them.
 
            1. Probability of Success
            Defendants
argue that Bank cannot meet its heavy evidentiary burden for a preliminary
injunction because its evidence consists of a single declaration from its
counsel.  Therefore, Bank has not
demonstrated a probability of success on any of the Complaint’s causes of
action.  Opp. at 3-4.  
            Defendants
misunderstand the focus of the requested preliminary injunction.  Bank obtained a writ of possession because it
had already demonstrated its right to the Vehicles as against Screamline.  See CCP §512.010(b).  As such, Bank has already demonstrated a
probability of success on the merits of the underlying claim.  Reply at 3; Rasheed Reply Decl., ¶¶ 3-4, Exs.
A-B.  
Defendants assert that Bank fails to
provide any evidence that they attempted to transfer, convey, encumber, or
impair the Vehicles.  Opp. at 4.  Bank obtained an order for a
writ of possession and a turnover order from Defendants.  Bank has shown that Defendants have failed to
comply with the turnover order despite several demands from opposing
counsel.  Defendants’ willingness to
ignore a court order for turnover of the Vehicles gives rise to an inference
that they may transfer or conceal the Vehicles to prevent their recovery by a
levying officer.  
            Defendants
finally argue that Bank fails to distinguish between Defendants.  Opp. at 3. 
This argument is spurious.  The
court granted the application for a writ of possession and turnover order as to
Screamline.  Rasheed Decl., ¶3, Ex. 1.  Starline, Farhadi, Shoeleh, and Vahid are
guarantors of Screamline’s debt. 
Injunctions commonly enjoin not only the parties, but also their
officers, employees, and agents.  Pitchess
v. Superior Court, (1969) 2 Cal.App.3d 653, 656.  Any agent of a defendant may be included
within the scope of a preliminary injunction and all of Starline, Farhadi,
Shoeleh, and Vahid are Screamline’s agents.
            Bank
has shown a probability of success.
 
            2.
Balance of Hardships
            The
second factor which a trial court examines is the interim harm that plaintiff
is likely to sustain if the injunction is denied as compared to the harm that
the defendant is likely to suffer if the court grants a preliminary injunction.  Donahue Schriber Realty Group, Inc. v. Nu
Creation Outreach, (2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 1171, 1177.  This factor involves consideration of the
inadequacy of other remedies, the degree of irreparable harm, and the necessity
of preserving the status quo.  Id.
            Defendants
do not argue that it would suffer harm from a granted preliminary
injunction.  The preliminary injunction
would maintain the status quo to allow for execution of the writ of possession.  This would not cause harm to Screamline,
which has lost its right to possess the Vehicles.
Defendants argue that Bank offers no proof that the
Defendants will transfer, convey, encumber, or impair the value of the Vehicles
in the absence of a preliminary injunction. 
Opp. at 4.  The court has rejected
the argument because Screamline has refused to comply with the turnover order.  
            Bank
argues that, until it recovers the Vehicles, it cannot lease them to someone
else or otherwise use them to try and reduce the damages from Screamline’s own
breach of the Note.  Rasheed Decl., ¶10.  The balance of hardships favors a preliminary
injunction.
 
            E. Conclusion
            The
application for a preliminary injunction is granted.  Defendants may not transfer any interest in the
Vehicles, dispose or encumber them, conceal them as to make them less available
to seizure by a levying officer, impair their value, or dispose of proceeds
from the transfer of any interest in them.
            The
court must require a bond supporting the preliminary injunction.  The
purpose of a bond is to cover the defendant’s damages from an improvidently
issued injunction.  CCP §529(a).  In setting the bond, the court must
assume that the preliminary injunction was wrongly issued.  Abba Rubber
Co. v. Seaquist, (1991) 235 Cal.App.3d 1, 15.  The attorney’s fees
necessary to successfully procure a decision dissolving the injunction are
damages that should be included in setting the bond.  Id., supra,
235 Cal.App.3d at 15-16.  The greater the likelihood of the plaintiff
prevailing, the less likely the preliminary injunction will have been wrongly
issued, and that is a relevant factor for setting the bond.  Oiye v. Fox, (2012) 211 Cal.App.4th 1036,
1062.  The likelihood of Defendants succeeding
in setting aside the injunction is minimal. 
The bond will be set at $500.
