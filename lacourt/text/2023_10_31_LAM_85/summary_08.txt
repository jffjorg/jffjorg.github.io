And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving a request for a writ of possession. The defendants failed to lodge a courtesy copy of their opposition, which is a violation of the Presiding Judge's order. The judge admonishes counsel for the defendants to provide courtesy copies of all relevant documents in the future. The judge also considers the substance of the injunction and determines that it is not prohibitory, but rather mandatory. The judge notes that a mandatory injunction carries a heavy burden and is only granted in extreme cases where the right thereto is clearly established. The judge also references a case that allows a court to issue an injunction to maintain the status quo without a cause of action in the complaint. Finally, the judge declines to take judicial notice of certain documents requested by the plaintiff, noting that the court is free to review prior filings in the current action.
