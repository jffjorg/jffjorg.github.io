And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is considering the case and has made some preliminary decisions. If the court denies the plaintiff's application for a writ of possession, the temporary restraining order (TRO) must be dissolved. The declarant has requested judicial notice of a fact, but since Daimler failed to file a separate document with the request, the request is denied. The judge also notes that Daimler checked the box for a turnover order on the proposed order, but since this was not requested, no turnover order will be issued. The judge is considering the possibility of issuing a "turnover order" directing Daimler to transfer possession of the property to the plaintiff, but only in conjunction with the writ of possession, and only if the court grants the writ.
