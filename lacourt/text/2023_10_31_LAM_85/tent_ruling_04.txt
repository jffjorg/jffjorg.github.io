[1] Real Party-in-Interest Department
of Industrial Relations, Division of Occupational Safety and Health (“DOSH”)
joins the Board’s opposition.  A joinder
is not statutorily authorized and is merely a cheerleading effort.  See
Haah v. Kim, (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 45, 51-52 (quoting, but
not necessarily approving, trial court). 
At a minimum, a joinder to an opposition must be timely filed 9 court
days before the hearing and separately supported by memorandum.  DOSH’s joinder was timely filed and supported
by a short memorandum.  Therefore, it can
be considered.  


[2] Atkinson was granted leave
to file a 13-page brief in order to address oppositions from both the Board and
DOSH.  Atkinson filed a 12-page reply
even though DOSH did not file a substantive opposition.  Although this is a violation of the order, the
court has exercised its discretion to read and consider the reply.  Atkinson also failed to include any of the ALJ
and Board decisions in the Trial Notebook in violation of the court’s order at
the trial setting conference.  Its
counsel is admonished to follow the court’s directions in all future writ
proceedings.


            [3] The Board requests judicial
notice of its decisions in (1) Barrett Business Services, Inc., (2016)
Cal/OSHA App. 315526582 (RJN Ex. A), (2) Home Depot USA, Inc., (2017)
Cal/OSHA App. 15-2298 (RJN Ex. B), and (3) United Parcel Service, (2018)
Cal/OSHA App. 1158285 (RJN Ex. C).  The
requests are granted.  Evid. Code
§452(c).

[5] Atkinson
is wrong that Honjio did not testify
that there was evidence of road collapse. 
He did.  AR 222, 227, 437 (Ex. 7-22).  The
soil on the steep slope was
loose and dry like a spoils pile type of soil. 
AR 199, 221.  Because the width of
the road was asymmetrical and the dirt was sloughed off, it appeared that the
side of the road collapsed from the weight of the forklift and fell into the
ravine.  AR 222, 227, 441.  Ex. 7-22 shows Honjio measuring the
access road right above where the forklift landed, his foot on the tape measure
to hold it flat on the edge of the road. 
AR 213-14, 220, 437.  Because the
tape measure does not bend left or right, it is a straight edge that shows
where the road collapsed just above where the forklift landed.  AR 214. 
There was no indication that the road gave way within the 129-inch
distance from the wall out where the forklift wheels would be traveling.  AR 283. 
As the Board’s opposition argues, Honjio opined that the road collapsed
from the weight of the forklift, leaving the narrowest 129-inch distance as a
result.  Opp. at 18.

In reply, Atkinson adds that the Board’s opposition gives an incomplete
accounting of several witnesses’ testimony. 
First, the Board claims that Turnham agreed that the forklift left the
roadway and fell into a ravine.  But
Turnham also testified that he did not see any collapsed roadway at the
accident site.  AR 595-96.  Turnham had been on that roadway project for
two years, and in that time, he traveled up and down that roadway for various
purposes at various times.  AR 597. 
He had driven his F-550 utility truck with a crane and welder, oilers,
and a Peterbilt three-axle truck down that access road.  AR 598.  He had also seen other vehicles driving up and
down that road during his two years on the project, including pickup trucks,
oilers, forklifts, manlifts, and the 80-ton rough terrain Link-Belt Crane.  AR 598.  Reply at 7-8. 

Second, the
Board claims that when Hansen, Atkinson’s Safety Manager, called DOSH on July
20, 2018 to report Hoyt’s accident, he said that Hoyt was operating an
“extendable forklift and got close to the edge or ground gave out and the
forklift rolled and [he] was crushed underneath.”  AR 458, 565-66. This
disregards the testimony of Dosh Associate Safety Engineer Nilawat, who
testified that the description he wrote on the C-36 forms is not the conclusion
of what caused the accident.  AR 305.  Reply at 8.
Third, the
Board focuses on Honjio’s testimony that he climbed down the slope of the
ravine to examine the forklift and that the soil was “very loose and very dry,
and it was quite steep.”  AR 199.  However, the forklift was not driving down the
slope into the ravine, so it is irrelevant what the soil was like on the slope
of the ravine.  AR 632.  Reply at 8.
These
references to Turnham’s and Honjio’s evidence do not detract from the
substantial evidence of a violation and neither the Board nor the court relies
on what Hansen said to Nilawat on July 20, 2018 for conclusions about
Atkinson’s violation.


[7] In reply, Atkinson merely
argues that the violation was not Accident-Related because it was not
Serious.  Reply at 15.
