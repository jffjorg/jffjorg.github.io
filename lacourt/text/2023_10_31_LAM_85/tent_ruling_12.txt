            [1] If the
court denies the plaintiff’s application for a writ of possession, any TRO must
be dissolved.  CCP §513.010(c).


            [2] The
declarant requests judicial notice of this fact.  Azubogu Decl., ¶28.  Daimler failed to file a separate document
with the request for judicial notice.  See
CRC 3.1113(l).  The request is denied.


[3] The
court may also issue a “turnover order” directing the defendant to transfer
possession of the property to the plaintiff (See Mandatory Form CD-120). 
The order must notify the defendant that failure to comply may subject
him or her to contempt of court.  CCP
§512.070.  The turnover remedy is not
issued in lieu of a writ, but in conjunction with it to provide the plaintiff
with a less expensive means of obtaining possession.  See
Edwards v Superior Court, (1991) 230 Cal.App.3d 173, 178.  Daimler does not ask for a turnover order but
has checked the turnover order box on the proposed order.  As it was not requested, no turnover order
shall issue.
