  Case Number:  21STLC04554    Hearing Date:   October 31, 2023    Dept:  85 
People of the State of
California v. Aero Institute, 21STLC04554
 
 
Tentative decision on
motion (1) to approve Receiver’s claim determination: granted; (2) for approval
of final report, discharge, and accounting: granted



 
            
            Receiver
Byron Z. Moldo (“Receiver”) moves for approval of his determinations regarding
claims totaling $186,318.16 and authorizing him to distribute Receivership Estate
funds to pay these claims.  He also moves
for approval of final report and accounting, discharge from his duties,
approval of his outstanding fees and costs approved, and exoneration of his
undertaking.  
            The
court has read and considered the moving papers, the objection from Susan
Miller (“Miller”), and reply,[1] and
renders the following tentative decision.  
            
            A.
Statement of the Case
            1.
Complaint
            Petitioner
People of the State of California (“People”) commenced this proceeding against
Defendant AERO Institute (“AERO”) on June 17, 2021 alleging a cause of action
for involuntary dissolution.  The Complaint
alleges in pertinent part as follows. 
            AERO
is a non-profit public benefit corporation with the charitable mission of
educating the public regarding science, technology, and aerospace issues.  To that end, AERO has hosted a variety of
programs with schools and libraries, including pre-teacher programs for adults
interested in becoming teachers to improve their ability to teach mathematics
and sciences.
            AERO’s
sole source of funding is cooperative agreements with the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration (“NASA”).  Based
on its representation that it would operate as a charitable organization, AERO received
tax-exempt status from the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”).  
            On
June 20, 2021, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office filed a criminal
complaint against AERO’s then-executive director Kimberly Anne Shaw (“Shaw”) and
consultant Miller, as well as the former mayor of Palmdale James Coleman
Ledford (“Ledford”), charging them with embezzlement, misappropriation of
public funds, and grand theft.  On August
22, 2018, the criminal court issued a temporary restraining order (“TRO”) freezing
access to AERO’s bank accounts to prevent dissipation of assets.
            After
Miller and Shaw’s indictment, AERO board member Curtis Cannon (“Cannon”) became
interim executive director until February 2018 when he became its sole
director.
            On
January 16, 2020, Miller pled guilty to the charge of misappropriation of funds
in violation of Penal Code section 424(a)(l). 

            On
January 20, 2020, Shaw pled guilty to the charge of filing a false tax return
on behalf of AERO in violation of Revenue and Taxation (“R&T”) Code section
19705(a).  In doing so, Shaw stipulated
to the underlying factual basis in the criminal complaint.  Miller and Shaw both agreed to relinquish any
interest they may have in AERO’s assets.
            After
Ledford accepted a plea agreement on April 22, 2021, the criminal court lifted
the TRO freezing AERO’s assets.
            Since
Cannon became interim executive director in 2017, AERO has failed to file
required documents with the IRS. 
Throughout 2018, Business Manager/Vice President of Business Operations
Amber Abel (“Abel”) issued letters ending the employment of multiple
high-ranking employees until November 30, 2018, when Cannon ended Abel’s
employment.  Since the August 2018 TRO,
AERO has ceased all programs furthering its charitable mission.  AERO’s counsel has since stated that the
organization plans to cease operations.
            The
People seek (1) an order involuntarily dissolving AERO under the provisions of
Corporations Code (“Corp. Code”) sections 6510 and 6518, providing for
satisfaction of all of its lawful debts, and distributing remaining assets in a
manner consistent with its charitable mission and any other restrictions, and
(2) for attorney’s fees and costs.
            
            2.
Course of Proceedings
            On
July 2, 2021, Petitioner served AERO with the Complaint and Summons by
substitute service, effective July 12, 2021.
            On
July 23, 2021, the court reclassified the matter from Civil Limited to Civil
Unlimited, Dept. 36 (Hon. Gregory Alarcon).
            On
August 6, 2021, the plaintiff in Susan Miller v. AERO Institute, (“Susan
Miller”) LASC No. 21AVCV00511, filed a motion to stay that case pending
resolution of this case.  On September
23, 2021, the plaintiff re-filed the motion to stay which was granted on
October 29, 2021.
            On
August 12, 2021, AERO filed a demurrer, which the court overruled.
            On
October 29, 2021, Dept. 36 related this case and Susan Miller.   
            On
December 17, 2021, AERO filed its Answer.
            On
August 4, 2022, this court granted Petitioner’s motion to appoint a Receiver for
AERO’s property.
            On
January 31, 2023, the court granted Receiver’s motion to establish a claims
procedure and bar date.
            On
June 1, 2023, Dept. 36 (Hon. Wendy Chang) granted Petitioner’s motion for
judgment on the pleadings without leave to amend.
            On
August 1, 2023, Receiver reported that he had reviewed the claims with
extensive supporting documents and reserved this hearing date for a motion to
approve claims and his discharge as Receiver.
 
            B.
Applicable Law
            Pursuant
to CRC 3.1184(a), a receiver must present by noticed motion or stipulation of
all parties: (1) a final account and report; (2) a request for the discharge;
and (3) a request for exoneration of the receiver’s surety.  No memorandum is required in support of the
motion unless the court orders otherwise. 
CRC 3.1184(b).  Notice must be
given to every person or entity known to the receiver to have a substantial,
unsatisfied claim that will be affected by the order or stipulation, regardless
of whether that person or entity is a party to the action or has appeared in
it.  CRC 3.1184(c).
            If
any allowance of compensation for the receiver or for an attorney employed by
the receiver is claimed in an account, it must state in detail what services
have been performed by the receiver or the attorney and whether previous
allowances have been made to the receiver or attorney, and the amounts.  CRC 3.1184(d).
 
            C.
Statement of Facts[2]
            1. Course of Proceedings
            On August 8, 2022, Receiver
was appointed for all property of Defendant AERO.  Moldo Decl., ¶2, Ex. A.  This included all assets, funds, bonds, or
insurance policies maintained by AERO or of which it is a beneficiary, and all
bank, financial, corporate, and other records pertinent thereto owned
beneficially or otherwise by or in AERO’s possession or control, or to which AERO
has any right of possession, custody, or control.  Moldo Decl., ¶2, Ex. A.  AERO’s bank accounts were at Wells Fargo,
Bank of America, and Merrill Lynch. 
Moldo Decl., ¶2, Ex. A.  
            In the motion to appoint
a receiver, People asserted that AERO was defunct, it had its corporate status
suspended, and it had approximately $1.8 million in charitable assets.  Moldo Decl., ¶3.  Because of these issues, AERO should be
dissolved.  Moldo Decl., ¶3.  In granting the motion to appoint Receiver, the
court stated that creditors would have an opportunity to bring claims against
AERO.  Moldo Decl., ¶3.  
            Receiver obtained (1)
$278,753.33 from Wells Fargo, (2) $54,022.30 from Bank of America, and (3)
$1,507,895.59 from Merrill Lynch.  Moldo
Decl., ¶4.  Receiver has also reviewed
AERO’s books and records and spoken to counsel for all parties.  Moldo Decl., ¶5.  Based on this information, he developed a
list of potential creditors.  Moldo
Decl., ¶6.  Receiver believed that a
claims procedure to submit claims against AERO was in the best interests of the
Receivership Estate and creditors.  Moldo
Decl., ¶6.  
            On January 31, 2023, the
court granted Receiver’s motion to establish the recommended claims
procedure.  Moldo Decl., ¶8.  The procedure required Receiver to prepare
claims forms and notices of the claims procedure, mail them to all known AERO
creditors, and publish notice of the claims procedure in the Los Angeles
Daily Journal.  Moldo Decl., ¶¶
8(a)-(c).  Once Receiver received the
claims forms, he was to make a list of claims he proposed to accept or
reject, and to serve notice to rejected candidates with reasons for the rejection.  Moldo
Decl., ¶¶ 8(d)-(e).  Anyone whose claims
were rejected in whole or in part had 20 days after the mailing of the notice
of rejection to serve Receiver with an objection.  Moldo Decl., ¶8(f).  Receiver was required to assemble these
objections and any reply thereto in a single document for filing with the
court.  Moldo Decl., ¶8(f).  
            On February 9, 2023,
Receiver filed proof of publication of the claims procedure in the Los
Angeles Daily Journal.  Moldo Decl.,
¶8, Ex. B.
 
            2. Proposed Distributions
            Receiver proposes to approve
claims of $15,316.52 from AV East Kern STEM Network, $75,000 from Russell
Petti, $41,384 from Amber Abel, $269,280.17 from the California Office of the
Attorney General (“AG”), $4,617.64 from Jose Hernandez, and $50,000 from Curtis
Cannon.  Moldo Decl., ¶9.  The AG has agreed that its claim will not be
paid as part of the distribution of Estate funds.  Moldo Decl., ¶9.  Approved claims for disbursement total
$186,318.16.  Moldo Decl., ¶9.  
            Receiver proposes to
deny a $207,200 claim by Miller.  Moldo
Decl., ¶9.  Based on the transcript from
a January 16, 2020 plea hearing in People v. Miller, Case No. BA458328, Miller
has surrendered “any and all claims” she may have had against AERO’s seized
bank accounts.  Moldo Decl., ¶10, Ex. C.  On March 14, 2023, Receiver quoted the
transcript in a letter to Miller’s counsel advising it not to submit a claim.  Moldo Decl., ¶10, Ex. C.  
            On April 21, 2023,
Miller submitted a claim form based on reimbursement of attorneys’ fees and
costs in People v. Miller.  Moldo
Decl., ¶10, Ex. C.  In late 2017, Miller
was charged with three felonies in her capacity as an AERO agent or
employee.  Moldo Decl., ¶10, Ex. C.  Because AERO refused to pay her attorney’s
fees for that action, Miller paid them herself. 
Moldo Decl., ¶10, Ex. C.  She
entered a plea agreement and pled guilty to “misappropriation of public funds”
in exchange for the district attorney having the other two charges
dismissed.  Moldo Decl., ¶10, Ex. C.  
Miller’s claim
contended that, at the time of her plea agreement, she asserted no direct ownership interest in the frozen money
but did not intend to waive any claim against AERO itself.  Moldo Decl., ¶10, Ex. C.  She only waived a $360,000 restitution amount
ordered to be paid by her to NASA, which did not include the entire $1.5
million in AERO assets.  Moldo Decl.,
¶10, Ex. C.  Miller asserted that her
claim relies on the assumption that a judge or jury could find that she was an
AERO employee.  Moldo Decl., ¶10, Ex.
C.  If so, under Labor Code section 2802,
AERO must reimburse her for attorney’s fees incurred in the scope of her
employment.  Moldo Decl., ¶10, Ex.
C.  This is now at issue in Susan
Miller.  Moldo Decl., ¶10, Ex.
C.  
            Miller cited Labor Code
section 2804, which voids any waiver of the rights afforded under Labor Code
section 2802.  Moldo Decl., ¶10, Ex. C.  She also asserted that to the extent Receiver
interprets her Plea Agreement as
a waiver of claims against her employer, such release was invalid per Civil
Code section 1542.  Moldo Decl., ¶10, Ex.
C.  She therefore urged Receiver not to
give the Plea Agreement “undue
significance.”  Moldo Decl., ¶10, Ex.
C.  
            On October 4, 2023, Receiver
informed Miller that, after his review of her claim, he would recommend the
court deny the claim based on her waiver of claims in the Plea Agreement. 
Moldo Decl., ¶10, Ex. C.  
 
            3. Final Compensation and Discharge
            The appointment order
provided that Receiver was to prepare and serve monthly statements of all fees
and expenses.  Moldo Decl., ¶13.   Interested parties then would have ten
calendar days to serve any objections by email and first-class mail.  Moldo Decl., ¶13.   If no one did, Receiver could draw
sufficient funds to pay all out-of-pocket expenses and 75% of fees listed in
the statement without further court order. 
Moldo Decl., ¶13.   The remainder
was to be paid upon approval of the final account and report.  Moldo Decl., ¶13.   
            Based on interim
statements through July 31, 2023, Receiver has withdrawn interim compensation
and costs totaling $49,253.61.  Moldo
Decl., ¶14, Ex. D.  Receiver asks for
ratification of these payments.  Moldo
Decl., ¶14.  
            Receiver’s October 5,
2023 invoice shows $12,902.40 for fees and costs incurred in August and
September.  Moldo Decl., ¶15, Ex. E.  Receiver expects to incur another $15,200 in
fees and $200 in costs, or $15,400 total, to terminate the Receivership.  Moldo Decl., ¶16.  The total amount owed to Receiver is
$28,302.40.  Moldo Decl., ¶17.
 
            4. Discharge
            Ledgers from two of the
estate’s accounts show outstanding balances of $3,498.79 and $1,813,645.67 in
July 2023.  Moldo Decl., Ex. D.  As of August 31, 2023, Estate assets total
$1,816,805.85.  Moldo Decl., ¶11.  
            If the court approves
distribution of the proposed $186,318.16 and $28,302.40 in outstanding Receiver
fees and expenses, the outstanding balance would be $1,602,185.29.  Moldo Decl., ¶¶ 11, 17-18.  Because AERO was a non-profit company, those
funds must be disbursed to a non-profit organization with a similar purpose
under the cy pres doctrine.  Moldo Decl.,
¶11.  Receiver recommends the Aldrin
Family Foundation (“Aldrin”) and SETI Institute (“SETI”) each receive half of
the excess.  Moldo Decl., ¶11.  These organizations conduct research and
operate similar to the manner in which AERO operated.  Moldo Decl., ¶11.
            After this division, Receiver
will have fulfilled his duties and requests discharge from all further duties,
liabilities, and responsibilities.  Moldo
Decl., ¶19.  Receiver also requests
exoneration of his $40,000 bond.  Moldo
Decl., ¶19.  
 
            D.
Analysis
            Receiver
moves for an order approving his final determinations as to disbursements from
the receivership estate.  Upon approval
of his proposed disbursements, Receiver moves for approval of final report and
accounting, discharge from his duties, approval of his outstanding fees and
costs approved, and exoneration of his undertaking.  Pertinent parties have been served.
            Miller
objects to the proposed distribution to the extent that it denies her $207,200
claim.  She requests that disbursement
not occur until after adjudication of her pending Susan Miller civil case based on her right to this
amount.  Obj. at 2.  
Because Miller untimely filed her objection by two days, Receiver
asks the court to not consider it.  See
CCP §1005(a), CRC 1.300(d).  Reply at 2.  Because Receiver discusses the merits of the
objection, it is not prejudiced by the untimely opposition.  The court exercises its discretion to
consider the opposition and reply.
 
            1.
Approved and Denied Claims
            The
court’s order instructed Receiver to prepare claims forms and notices of the
claims procedure, mail them to all known AERO creditors, and publish notice of
the claims procedure in the Los Angeles Daily Journal.  Moldo Decl., ¶¶ 8(a)-(c).  Once Receiver received the claims forms, he
was to make a list of claims he proposed to accept or reject, and to serve
notice to rejected candidates with reasons for the rejection.  Moldo Decl., ¶¶ 8(d)-(e).  Anyone whose claims were rejected in whole or
part had 20 days after the mailing of the notice of rejection to serve Receiver
with an objection.  Moldo Decl.,
¶8(f).  Receiver was required to assemble
these objections and any reply thereto in a single document for filing with the
court.  Moldo Decl., ¶8(f).
            Receiver
recommends approval of claims totaling $186,318.16.  Moldo Decl., ¶9.  The only claim Receiver has denied is Miller’s
claim for $207,200.  Moldo Decl., ¶10,
Ex. C.  Receiver advised her counsel not
to submit the claim because her Plea Agreement included a waiver of “any and
all claims” she may have had against AERO’s seized bank accounts.  Moldo Decl., ¶10, Ex. C.  Miller still filed the claim.  Moldo Decl., ¶10, Ex. C.
            An
employer shall indemnify his or her employee for all necessary expenditures or
losses incurred by the employee in direct consequence of the discharge of his
or her duties, or of his or her obedience to the directions of the employer,
even though unlawful, unless the employee, at the time of obeying the
directions, believed them to be unlawful. 
Labor Code §2802(a).  Any contract
or agreement, express or implied, made by any employee to waive such rights or any
other benefits of Labor Code section 2800 et seq. is null and void.  Labor Code §2804.
            Miller’s
claim asserted that the requested amount represents the attorney’s fees AERO refused
to pay in her criminal action.  Moldo
Decl., ¶10, Ex. C.  At issue in Susan
Miller is whether AERO should have indemnified Miller for those attorney’s
fees under Labor Code section 2802. 
Moldo Decl., ¶10, Ex. C.  
            As
in her claim, Miller now asserts that, under Labor Code section 2804, she could
not have waived her right to reimbursement for those fees through the Plea
Agreement.  Obj. at 3; Moldo Decl., ¶10,
Ex. C.  Miller also argues that dissipation
of the funds that would be the source of any award in Susan Miller deprives
her of her right to a jury trial on her claims therein.  Obj. at 2. 
            Miller
fails to provide evidence of a probability of success on her claim in Susan
Miller.  She admitted that her claim
presumes that a judge or jury will identify her as an AERO employee for
purposes of invoking Labor Code section 2802. 
Moldo Decl., ¶10, Ex. C.  She provides
no evidence that she was an AERO employee. 
She does provide an attachment to her objection contending that she worked
as an independent contractor and as principal investigator for AERO.  As principal investigator, she drafted grant applications
to NASA and was the primary administrator of contracts between AERO and
NASA.  Obj. at 5.  Miller fails to provide authority that these
facts indicate her to be an employee of AERO.
More important, Miller pled guilty to one charge of
misappropriation of public funds.  Moldo
Decl., ¶10, Ex. C.  She provides no evidence
that her misconduct was part of her duties as an AERO employee or in compliance
with instructions from AERO and that she believed it to be lawful.  Moldo Decl., ¶10, Ex. C.  To the contrary, she admitted her guilt for
misappropriation of public funds and her attorney stipulated to a factual
basis.  Ex. C.  As an employee guilty of criminal misconduct,
it is unlikely that she is entitled to indemnity under Labor Code section
2802.  Courts have yet to extend the
indemnity protections of Labor Code section 2802 even to the legal fees of
employees who successfully defend criminal actions.  Los Angeles Police Protective League v.
City of Los Angeles (1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 168, 177 (declining to decide
whether public employer must indemnify employee under Labor Code section 2802 who
was acquitted in criminal action).  There
is nothing to suggest that Miller meets the requirements of Labor Code section 2802(a).
Finally, Receiver seemingly would be entitled to offset any
claim Miller might have for attorney’s fees against the $341,266 she owes the AERO
Estate in restitution.  Ex. C.  Miller fails to show this is not true or that
her attorney’s lien would affect this conclusion.
The court therefore need not reach the issue of whether Miller’s
waiver of her claim at the plea hearing and pursuant to the Plea Agreement is
void under Labor Code section 2804.[3]   Miller
fails to demonstrate that Receiver should not have denied her claim for attorney’s
fees owed by AERO under Labor Code section 2802.
Miller asks the court to direct Receiver to set aside an
amount of $207,200 to satisfy Miller’s fee claim until Susan Miller is
decided, arguing that it will harm no one to do so.  Obj. at 2. 
Such an action would be a deferral of Miller’s claim, which would be
inappropriate.  Miller was obligated to
support her claim now, and she may not ask for a deferral of decision on that
claim until a related lawsuit is decided. 
The request is denied.
The motion to approve claims totaling $186,318.16 is
granted.
 
            2.
Final Report and Discharge
            Receiver
moves for ratification of prior payments for interim fees and costs, approval
of his final report and accounting, discharge from his duties, approval of $28,302.40
in outstanding fees and costs, and exoneration of his undertaking.  
            The
appointment order allowed Receiver to withdraw all out-of-pocket expenses and
75% of fees listed in monthly interim statements.  Moldo Decl., ¶13.  Receiver provides interim statements through
July 2023 to justify prior withdrawals of $49,253.61.  Moldo Decl., ¶14, Ex. D.  The request to ratify these payments is
granted.  Mot. at 9.
            The
appointment order provided that outstanding fees and costs were to be paid upon
approval of the final account and report. 
Moldo Decl., ¶13.   Receiver’s
October 5, 2023 invoice shows $12,902.40 for fees and costs incurred in August
and September.  Moldo Decl., ¶15, Ex.
E.  Receiver expects to incur another
$15,200 in fees and $200 in costs, or $15,400 total, to terminate the
receivership.  Moldo Decl., ¶16.  This is a reasonable estimate.  The total amount owed to Receiver is
$28,302.40.  Moldo Decl., ¶17.
            As
of August 31, 2023, estate assets total $1,816,805.85.  Moldo Decl., ¶11, Ex. D.  If the court approves distribution of the
proposed $186,318.16 and $28,302.40 in outstanding receivership fees and
expenses, the outstanding balance will be $1,602,185.29.  Moldo Decl., ¶¶ 11, 17-18.  Because AERO was a non-profit company, those
funds must be disbursed to a non-profit organization with a similar purpose
pursuant to the cy pres doctrine.  Moldo
Decl., ¶11.  Receiver recommends Aldrin
and SETI each receive half of the excess. 
Moldo Decl., ¶11.  These
organizations conduct research and operate similar to the manner in which AERO
operated.  Moldo Decl., ¶11.  No party objects to Aldrin and SETI as beneficiaries
of the estate.
            With
all disbursements made and the Receiver paid, he will have fulfilled his duties
and requests discharge from all further duties, liabilities, and
responsibilities.  Moldo Decl., ¶19.  Receiver also requests exoneration of his $40,000
bond.  Moldo Decl., ¶19.  Aside from Miller’s opposition based on the
denial of her claim, no party objects to Receiver’s discharge.
 
            E.
Conclusion
            The
motion to approve Receiver’s determinations claims is granted.  Receiver is directed to pay $15,316.52 to AV
East Kern STEM Network, $75,000 to Russell Petti, $41,384 to Amber Abel,
$4,617.64 to Jose Hernandez, and $50,000 to Curtis Cannon.  
            The
motion to approve Receiver’s final report and accounting is also granted.  The $49,253.61 of paid fees and costs are
ratified.  Payment of Receiver’s $28,302.40
in outstanding fees and costs is approved. 
Receiver is directed to transfer half of the outstanding $1,602,185.29
to Aldrin and half to SETI.  Receiver
then is discharged and his bond exonerated, and he is relieved of any liability
which could be imposed upon the final accounting.  See Aviation Brake Systems, Ltd. v.
Voorhis, (1982) 133 Cal.App.3d 230, 234.
