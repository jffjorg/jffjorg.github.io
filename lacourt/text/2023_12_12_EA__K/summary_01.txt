Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This tentative ruling denies the motions of Ramon and Son Roofing Inc. (Ramon & Sons) and Konstruct Inc. (Konstruct) to vacate the default judgment entered on June 7, 2022 and to recall all writs and/or levies issued against them. The motions are denied because the default judgment is not void due to improper service of process. The court finds that Ramon & Sons, as a corporation, may be served through substitute service, and that Plaintiff's proof of service was sufficient to establish service on Ramon & Sons and Konstruct. The court also notes that Code of Civil Procedure § 415.20, subdivision (a) does not contain any "reasonable diligence" requirement for substitute service on entity defendants.
