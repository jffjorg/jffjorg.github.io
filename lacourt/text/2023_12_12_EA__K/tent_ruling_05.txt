Discussion
Petitioner Maria Villanueva (“Petitioner”)
moves, per California Rules of Court (“CRC’) Rule 7.950.5, for approval of the
disposition of proceeds of judgment for Lesly Rodriguez (“Claimant”).
Petitioner is the parent and Guardian ad Litem of Claimant.
Petitioner
represents that Claimant is 16 years old (DOB 01/13/2007). (Petition, ¶ 2).
Petitioner
represents that Claimant’s claim or action is not for damages for the death of
a person caused by the wrongful act or neglect of another, that no portion of
the net proceeds of the judgment or settlement in favor of Claimant is to be
placed in a trust and that there are no unresolved disputes concerning liens to
be satisfied from the proceeds of the judgment or settlement. (Id., ¶
3). Petitioner further represents that Petitioner’s attorney did not become
involved with this matter, directly or indirectly, at the request of a party
against whom the claim is asserted or a party’s insurance carrier, that
Petitioner’s attorney is not representing, employed by, or associated with a
defendant in this matter or an insurance carrier and that all defendants that
have appeared in a pending action on the claim are participating in the
proposed compromise or the court has made a final determination that all
settling parties entered into the settlement in good faith. (Id.) Petitioner
represents that the total settlement payable to Claimant and all other persons
named in item 12 is in the amount of $50,000.00 or less. (Id.)
Petitioner
represents that Claimant’s claim is the subject of Case No. 23PSCV02886 and
arises out of a September 22, 2021 motor vehicle collision in Covina,
California. (Id., ¶¶ 4-5). Claimant was a passenger in a vehicle on
Citrus getting ready to make a left turn when Defendant, who was approaching
from Badillo Street, lost control and “T-boned” the vehicle Claimant was in. (Id.,
¶ 6). Claimant sustained moderate to severe right upper back and shoulder pain (Id.,
¶ 7). 
Claimant received chiropractic
care, orthopedic care, an MRI and acupuncture. (Id., ¶ 8). Claimant has
recovered completely from the effects of his injuries, and there are no
permanent injuries. (Id., ¶ 9). Petitioner represents that Defendant has
offered to pay Claimant $13,000.00 for complete settlement of all of Claimant’s
claims against her. (Id., ¶ 11.) Defendant has also offered to settle
with Kimberly Rodriguez (“Kimberly”) for $12,000.00 and with Nayeli Rodriguez
(“Nayeli”) for $5,000.00. (Id., ¶ 12). Kimberly
and Nayeli are the other occupants of the vehicle Claimant was riding in at the
time of the collision. (Id., ¶ 5). The $30,000.00 in total offered by
Defendant constitutes total policy limits. (Id., Attachment 12).
Petitioner
represents that Claimant’s total medical expenses before reductions is $10,665.00.
(Id., ¶ 13). None of Claimant’s medical expenses have been paid by
Medicare. (Id.). None of Claimant’s medical expenses have been paid by
Medi-Cal. (Id.)
Petitioner
represents that there are one or more liens from medical service providers for
payment of Claimant’s medical expenses and that, in full satisfaction of their
lien claims, the lienholders have agreed to accept the sum of $4,333.00. (Id.)
Petitioner represents that the latest statements from all medical service
providers are attached as Attachment 13g. It is unclear to the court,
however, how this $4,333.00 was calculated. Attachment 13g suggests that the
lienholders have agreed to accept a total reduced sum of $2,739.92 (i.e.,
$792.31 from Haven Orthopedics & Spine Institute, $1,200.00 from Riverside
Elite Imaging and $747.61 from Revive Chiropractic and Acupuncture). Further,
the $6,332.00 referenced in ¶ 13.a.(4) appears to be inconsistent with the
$4,333.00 referenced in ¶ 17.b.
Petitioner seeks
court approval for payment of $3,250.00 in attorney’s fees. (Id., ¶ 14;
Attachment 14a.) Petitioner first claims that filing fees of $435.00 have
been waived (Id., see also, ¶ 15) but subsequently appears to deduct $435.00
from the gross settlement amount (Id., ¶ 17.d.). Counsel has provided a declaration
that addresses the factors listed in Cal. Rules of Court 7.955(b) that are
applicable to the matter before the court.
Petitioner represents that the $4,982.00
balance of proceeds from the settlement will be deposited into an insured
account at Bank of America in Covina, CA. (Petition, ¶ 19; Attachment 19b(2).)
The court elects to
schedule and conduct a hearing on the instant petition pursuant to California
Rules of Court Rule 7.950.5, subdivision (c)(2). The hearing is set for December
12, 2023 at 9:30 a.m.  Petitioner is to
come prepared to discuss the issues
italicized above at that time.
