 Case Number:  KC069375    Hearing Date:   December 12, 2023    Dept:  K Plaintiff Classic
Maritime, Inc.’s Motion for Leave to File Fourth Amended Verified Complaint is DENIED
without prejudice.
Background   
Plaintiff Classic Maritime, Inc. (“Plaintiff”) alleges as
follows:
Under a contract of affreightment dated
June 29, 2009 (the “2009 COA”), Limbungan Makmus Sdn Bhd (“Limbungan”) agreed
to ship, and Plaintiff agreed to provide vessels to carry, 51 cargoes of iron
ore pellets from Tubarao or Ponta Ubu I Braxil to Port Kelang or Labuan in
Malaysia between 2009-2017. Limbungan’s obligations under the 2009 COA were
guaranteed by its parent company, Lion Diversified Holdings BHD (“Lion”)
pursuant to a written guarantee dated June 29, 2009 (the “2009 Guarantee”). On
June 30, 2014, Plaintiff and Limbungan executed an Addendum No. 1 to the 2009
COA which increased the number of shipments to 59. Likom Caseworks USA (“Likom
USA”) is a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of Likom Caseworks Sdn Bhd (“Likom
Caseworks”) and a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of Lion. Likom USA and Lion
are alter egos and, along with Likom Caseworks and Likom de Mexico, S.A.
de C.V. (“Likom Mexico”), operate as an integrated single enterprise. 
 
By mid-2016, Limbungan had breached its
obligations under the 2009 COA with respect to at least 4 “Index Shipments” and
3 “Scheduled Shipments,” which resulted in Plaintiff suing Limbungan and Lion
in a case styled Classic Maritime Inc. v. Limbungan Makmur Sdn Bhd and Lion
Diversified Holdings Bhd., Claim No. CL-2016-00421 (“English Action I”).
On September 13, 2018, judgment was handed down in English Action I. On
July 4, 2019, the Court of Appeal revised the lower court judgment in English
Action I. The judgment in English Action I is now final. 
 
Additionally, under the 2009 COA
Limbungan was required to declare laycans for 16 “Unscheduled Shipments” as
defined therein so that all of the Unscheduled Shipments fell in their entirety
before December 31, 2017. Limbungan breached the 2009 COA by failing to declare
laycans for 14 of the Unscheduled Shipments. Limbungan also made arrangements
with third parties for the carriage of certain Unscheduled Shipments in
violation of the 2009 COA. Plaintiff filed a lawsuit against Limbungan and Lion
regarding the “Unscheduled Shipments” in a case styled Classic Maritime Inc.
v. Limbungan Makmur Sdn Bhd and Lion Diversified Holdings Bhd., Claim
CL-2018-000352 (“English Action II”). 
 
Also, Limbungan owes delay damages to Plaintiff
in connection with a shipment it performed under the 2009 COA between
June-October 2013, employing the vessel Mineral Kyushu.
On March 3, 2020, Plaintiff filed a Third Amended Complaint,
asserting causes of action against Lion, Likom and Does 1-10 for:
1.                 
Recognition of Foreign-Country Judgment 
2.                 
Breach of Contract/Guarantee against Lion
3.                 
Alter Ego
On April 1, 2020, Lion filed a “Notice of Stay of
Proceedings,” advising therein of its Chapter 15 filing on March 18, 2020. On
December 15, 2020, the court ordered the action stayed as to Lion.
On August 25, 2023, Plaintiff filed an “Amendment to
Complaint,” wherein Tan Sri Cheng Young Kim (aka Albert Cheng) was named in
lieu of Doe 1.
On September 26, 2023, Plaintiff filed another “Amendment to
Complaint,” wherein Cheng Yong Kim (aka Albert Cheng) was named in lieu of Doe
2.
On November 29, 2023, Plaintiff dismissed Tan Sri Cheng
Young Kim (aka Albert Cheng) and Cheng Yong Kim (aka Albert Cheng), with
prejudice.
A Status Conference
Re: Bankruptcy is set for January 8, 2024.
Legal Standard
“The court
may, in furtherance of justice, and on any terms as may be proper, allow a
party to amend any pleading…” (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (a)(1); and see §
576 [“Any judge, at any time before or after commencement of trial, in the
furtherance of justice, and upon such terms as may be proper, may allow the
amendment of any pleading or pretrial conference order”].)
“[T]he trial
court has wide discretion in allowing the amendment of any pleading.” (Bedolla v. Logan & Frazer (1975) 52
Cal.App.3d 118, 135.) “[I]t is irrelevant that new legal theories are
introduced as long as the proposed amendments relate to the same general set of
facts.” (Kittredge Sports Co. v. Superior
Court (1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 1045, 1048 [quotation marks and citation
omitted].) “[E]ven if the proposed legal theory is a novel one, the preferable
practice would be to permit the amendment and allow the parties to test its legal sufficiency by demurrer, motion for judgment on the
pleadings or other appropriate proceedings.” (Id. [quotation marks and citation omitted].) With that said, “the
failure of a proposed amendment to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause
of action or defense may support an order denying a motion to amend.” (California
Casualty Gen. Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1985) 173 Cal.App.3d 274, 280,
disapproved of on other grounds in Kransco v. American Empire Surplus Lines
Ins. Co. (2000) 23 Cal.4th 390)
Courts must
apply a policy of great liberality in permitting amendments to the complaint at
any stage of the proceedings, up to and including trial, when no prejudice is
shown to the adverse party. (Atkinson v.
Elk Corp. (2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 739, 761.) However, “even if a good
amendment is proposed in proper form, unwarranted delay in presenting it may—of
itself—be a valid reason for denial. . . denial may rest upon the element of
lack of diligence in offering the amendment
after knowledge of the facts, or the effect of the delay on the adverse party.”
(Roemer v. Retail Credit Co.
(1975) 44 Cal.App.3d 926, 940.)
Also, “[a] motion to amend a pleading before trial must: (1)
Include a copy of the proposed amendment or amended pleading, which must be
serially numbered to differentiate it from previous pleadings or amendments;
(2) State what allegations in the previous pleading are proposed to be deleted,
if any, and where, by page, paragraph, and line number, the deleted allegations
are located; and (3) State what allegations are proposed to be added to the
previous pleading, if any, and where, by page, paragraph, and line number, the
additional allegations are located.” (Cal. Rules of Court (“CRC”), rule 3.1324,
subd. (a).)
Additionally, “[a] separate declaration must accompany the
motion and must specify: (1) The effect of the amendment; (2) Why the amendment
is necessary and proper; (3) When the facts giving rise to the amended
allegations were discovered; and (4) The reasons why the request for amendment
was not made earlier.” (CRC Rule 3.1324, subd. (b).)
Discussion
Plaintiff moves the court
for an order granting it leave to file its proposed Fourth Amended Complaint
(“4AC”). Plaintiff represents that the 4AC “primarily seeks to: (1) narrow the
claim amount in this proceeding that it seeks to secure by the pre-judgment
attachment to just the sums awarded in the English Action I and the
English Appeal, and to delete all references to the English Action II;
(2) to add a cause of action against defendant Likom USA and defendant Cheng
for Actually Fraudulent Transfers under California’s Uniform Fraudulent
Transfer Act (“UFTA”); and (3) to add an alternative cause of action against
defendant Likom USA and defendant Cheng for Constructively Fraudulent Transfers
under the UFTA.” (Motion, 2:16-22).
Plaintiff has attached a redline copy
reflecting the changes between the operative TAC and proposed 4AC. The court
determines that this attachment constitutes adequate compliance with CRC
Rule 3.1324, subdivision (a).
Plaintiff’s counsel, however, has failed to
provide the court and opposing counsel with a declaration that complies with CRC
Rule 3.1324, subdivision (b). The court denies the motion without prejudice
on this basis.
