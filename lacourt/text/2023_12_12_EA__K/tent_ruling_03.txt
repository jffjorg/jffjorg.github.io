Lucy Seh’s, Jonathan Seh’s and The Peter Seh Living Trust 2001’s Demurrer to [First
Amended] Complaint is CONTINUED to January 18, 2023, at 8:00 a.m. [1]
2.         Plaintiff Benjamin
Kirk’s Motion for Preliminary Injunction is DENIED. [2]
Background    
Plaintiff Benjamin
Kirk (“Kirk”) alleges as follows:
On
January 19, 2021, Kirk, as manager of Butterfield Property LLC (“Butterfield”),
and SVPP Properties LLC (“SVPP”) entered into a lease to purchase agreement for
the property located at 761 Corporate Center Drive Pomona, California (“subject
property”). In June 2021, Lucy Seh (“Lucy”) joined Kirk’s affiliated
organization, Kingston Financial, as a loan officer. Lucy had been Kirk’s domestic
partner from 2000-2014. Lucy learned of the transaction and expressed interest
in the subject property. Kirk and Lucy agreed to split the equity in the
subject property when the subject property was sold if Lucy participated in the
close of escrow. Lucy set up Edington Asset LLC (“Edington”) and Kirk and Lucy
agreed to name Lucy’s son, Jonathan Seh (“Jonathan”), as Edington’s manager. Kirk
agreed to assign Butterfield’s interest in the subject property to Edington and
closed escrow. Lucy, though, failed to complete the legal paperwork to reflect
the 50/50 interest in the subject property between her and Kirk. Escrow closed
on February 24, 2022. On May 18, 2022, Lucy recorded a deed of trust in the
amount of $3.3 million against the subject property in favor of 168 Investment
LLC, an entity Lucy controlled. On October 7, 2022, Lucy assigned the aforesaid
deed of trust to the Peter Seh Living Trust 2001 dated September 13, 2001
(“Trust”), in which Lucy is the trustee. On December 13, 2022, Lucy recorded a
grant deed (which was signed by Jonathan), granting the subject property to the
Trust.
On July 17, 2023, Kirk
filed a First Amended Complaint (“FAC”), asserting causes of action against Lucy,
Jonathan, Trust, All Persons Unknown, Claiming Any Legal or Equitable Right,
Title, Estate, Lien, or Interest in the Property for:

1.         Demurrer
Discussion
Lucy, Jonathan and
Trust demur, per Code of Civil Procedure § 430.10, to the first, third and
seventh causes of action in Plaintiff’s FAC, on the basis that they each fail
to state facts sufficient to a constitute cause of action.
The hearing on the demurrer is CONTINUED to January 18, 2023,
at 9:00 a.m.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 128;
430.41[3].) Code
of Civil Procedure § 430.41 requires a demurring party in certain civil
actions, before filing the demurrer, to engage in a specified meet and confer process
with the party who filed the pleading demurred to for the purpose of
determining whether an agreement can be reached as to the filing of an amended
pleading that would resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer.
The demurrer is not accompanied by a Code of Civil Procedure
§ 430.41 meet and confer declaration. Meet and confer declarations are still
required for amended complaints, as per CCP § 430.41(a)(1). Kirk’s opposition
indicates that no meet and confer was conducted. (Opp., 2:18-24).
Counsel for Lucy,
Jonathan and Trust must file a declaration in compliance with Code of
Civil Procedure § 430.41 at least nine court days prior to the continued
hearing date. 
Counsel for Lucy,
Jonathan and Trust is instructed to give notice forthwith.
2.         Motion for Preliminary
Injunction[4]
Legal Standard
“An injunction is a writ or order requiring a person to
refrain from a particular act. It may be granted by the court in which the
action is brought, or by a judge thereof; and when granted by a judge, it may
be enforced as an order of the court.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 525.)
“In determining whether to issue a preliminary injunction,
the trial court considers two related factors: (1) the likelihood that the
plaintiff will prevail on the merits of its case at trial, and (2) the interim
harm that the plaintiff is likely to sustain if the injunction is denied as
compared to the harm that the defendant is likely to suffer if the court grants
a preliminary injunction.” (14859
Moorpark Homeowner’s Ass’n v. VRT Corp. (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th
1396, 1402.) “The trial court’s determination must be guided by a ‘mix’ of the
potential-merit and interim-harm factors; the greater the plaintiff’s showing
on one, the less must be shown on the other to support an injunction.” (Butt v. State of California (1992) 4
Cal.4th 668, 678.) “Generally, weighing these factors lies within
the broad discretion of the superior court.” (County of Kern v. T.C.E.F., Inc. (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 301, 315.)
Discussion
Kirk moves the court for an order restraining
defendants from transferring, conveying, selling, liquidating or otherwise
disposing of the subject property and, in addition, prohibiting them from
interfering with the operation, maintenance, or construction occurring or
undertaken in, on, or affecting the building. Kirk also seeks to enjoin
Defendants from interfering with the business or occupancy of any tenant of the
building.
Kirk’s motion is
summarily denied, inasmuch as Kirk has made no showing of interim harm, let
alone irreparable harm. Kirk filed this action on February 7, 2023. The instant
motion is set for hearing on December 12, 2023. Kirk has not provided the court
with any evidence that defendants have engaged in any actions to “transfer[],
convey[], sell[], liquidat[e] or otherwise dispos[e]” of the subject property,
that they have “interfere[ed] with the operation, maintenance, or construction
occurring or undertaken in, on, or affecting the building” or that they have
“interfere[ed] with the business or occupancy of any tenant of the building.”
(Motion, 1:22-2:1).
Kirk asserts that
Lucy has attempted to change the locks on tenants’ office doors and continues
to threaten to do so, that she has called the police on tenants and continued
to threaten to do so, and otherwise threatens with their use and occupancy of the
premises. (Id., 3:7-12). Kirk’s motion, however, is not accompanied by
declarations from any current and/or prior tenants. Kirk also asserts that Lucy
has refused to pay contractors, threatened them and interfered with their work,
and ordered them to stop work, which has resulted in a number of mechanic’s
liens to have been recorded against the property. (Id., 3:12-17). Kirk’s
motion, though, is not accompanied by declarations from any current and/or
prior contractors or by copies of any of the purported mechanic’s liens.
Although Kirk has submitted a declaration, much of the information contained
therein (particularly Paragraphs 10, 11, 13 and 14) is hearsay. Kirk attests
that an individual named Daniel Hererra (who would allegedly come to the
building with Lucy) stole “everything in [his] office” and that he “know[s]
this because it was all recorded on a security camera the building had” (Kirk
Decl., ¶ 12); Kirk, however, failed to provide the court with any such
recording.
