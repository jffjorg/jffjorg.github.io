And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on several issues related to the motions filed in this case. Motion #1 was filed on August 16, 2023, and was originally set for hearing on September 20, 2023. However, the court rescheduled the hearing date to December 12, 2023, and waived notice of the new date.

Motion #2 was filed on November 16, 2023, and was set for hearing on the same date as Motion #1. However, the plaintiff failed to provide adequate notice of the motion, as required by law. The defendants opposed the motion on the merits, and the court will consider and rule on the motion based on its merits.

The court will also entertain the merits of the defendants' opposition to Motion #2, despite the fact that it was filed late. The defendants' opposition argues that the appearance of a party at a hearing and their opposition to a motion on its merits constitutes a waiver of any defects or irregularities in the notice of the motion.

Finally, the court notes that the defendants' opposition was not filed in a timely manner, and that the plaintiff failed to meet and confer with the defendants prior to filing the motion. The court will consider these facts in making its final ruling on the motion.
