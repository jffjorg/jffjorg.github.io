And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling concerns the hearing on the demurrer to the First Amended Complaint filed by Plaintiff Benjamin Kirk against Defendants Lucy Seh, Jonathan Seh, and The Peter Seh Living Trust 2001. The demurrer is continued to January 18, 2023, at 9:00 a.m. The judge notes that the demurring party did not conduct a meet and confer process with the plaintiff as required by Code of Civil Procedure § 430.41.

The judge also rules on Plaintiff Kirk's Motion for Preliminary Injunction, which is DENIED. The judge finds that the plaintiff has not shown any interim harm or irreparable harm, and the motion is not accompanied by declarations from current and/or prior tenants or contractors. The judge concludes that the plaintiff has not provided sufficient evidence to support the issuance of a preliminary injunction.
