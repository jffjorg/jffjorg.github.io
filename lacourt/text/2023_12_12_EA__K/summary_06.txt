And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the Plaintiff's motion for leave to file its proposed Fourth Amended Complaint (4AC) without prejudice. The judge finds that the Plaintiff's counsel has failed to provide a declaration that complies with California Rules of Court rule 3.1324, subdivision (b), which requires the court to be notified of the effect of the amendment, why the amendment is necessary, when the facts giving rise to the amended allegations were discovered, and the reasons why the request for amendment was not made earlier. The judge has determined that this omission is a valid reason for denial, and the motion is denied without prejudice.
