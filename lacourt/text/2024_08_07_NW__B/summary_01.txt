And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion for summary judgment. The court found that there are triable issues of fact as to whether the contract between the parties is one for health studio services. The defendant argued that the contract was void because it was not provided to the plaintiff in writing, but the court found that the plaintiff had presented evidence that the contract was not a contract for health studio services, but rather a waiver of liability. The court also found that the defendant's evidence was insufficient to establish that the contract was one for health studio services. Therefore, the court denied the defendant's motion for summary judgment and allowed the case to proceed to trial.
