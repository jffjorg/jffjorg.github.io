And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting Defendant Mynor Rene Orellana's Motion to Continue Trial. The original trial date was October 15, 2024, but the Judge has rescheduled the trial to commence on or after May 19, 2025. The Defendant requested the continuance due to discovery delays, citing that they were not served until August 14, 2023, and that the responding party failed to respond to discovery requests, resulting in the need for additional time to complete critical discovery. The Judge found that this was a proper reason to grant the continuance, as the Defendant was not responsible for the delays and needs time to complete necessary discovery.
