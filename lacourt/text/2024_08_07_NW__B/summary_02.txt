And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants both defendants' motions to compel further responses to form and special interrogatories. The plaintiff failed to respond to the interrogatories by the deadline and did not provide complete and evasive responses. The judge finds that the plaintiff's responses were not in compliance with the discovery statutes and were not reasonable and good faith efforts to obtain the information. The judge imposes monetary sanctions on the plaintiff and its counsel in the amount of $1,020.00, inclusive of both motions. The responses and all unpaid monetary sanctions must be provided to the defendants within 15 days of the order.
