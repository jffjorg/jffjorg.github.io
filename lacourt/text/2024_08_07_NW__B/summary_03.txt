And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has tentatively ruled that the Motion to Continue Trial filed by Alarcon and joined by Uber, Rasier, and Rasier-CA LLC is GRANTED. The trial date and all related discovery dates are continued by five months. The Judge has considered the factors outlined in California Rules of Court, rule 3.1332, including the proximity of the trial date, the availability of alternative means to address the problem, and the prejudice that parties or witnesses will suffer as a result of the continuance. The Judge has also considered the moving parties' representations that they need additional time to complete discovery, including the deposition of two of Moore's doctors, and that Alarcon's counsel is unavailable for the currently set trial date. The Judge has determined that the moving parties have made the requisite showing of good cause for a continuance, although the Judge notes that this will be the second continuance granted in this case and that the age of the case and the delay to Moore and Cruz are factors to be considered.
