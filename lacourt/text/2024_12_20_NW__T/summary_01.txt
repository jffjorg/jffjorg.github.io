And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted defendant Hyundai's motions to compel responses to discovery requests. The judge has ordered the plaintiff, T Calderon, to provide verified, code-compliant answers to requests for admission (RFAs), document production, and forms (Form ROGS and Special ROGS) within 20 days. The judge has also overruled the plaintiff's objections as frivolous and struck them from the record. The judge has not imposed sanctions on either side, citing the plaintiff's failure to engage in meaningful meet and confer after the motion was filed. The judge has noted that while Hyundai did not properly meet and confer before filing the motion, the plaintiff did not fix the problems after the motion was filed by serving supplemental, substantive responses.
