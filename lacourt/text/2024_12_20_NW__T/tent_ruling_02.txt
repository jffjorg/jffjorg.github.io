 Case Number:  LC107621    Hearing Date:   December 20, 2024    Dept:  T GPL
v LLHOA LC107621
Plaintiffs
motion to compel RFP set 1:
The
court declines to accept defendant’s counsels tortured interpretation of what
an extension of time to be.  Clearly, the
time is extended to add an additional 2 weeks, or whatever the due date to file
the motion was.  Otherwise, it has no
meaning.  Defense counsel argues that it
means two weeks from the time the extension is granted, even though there may
be more days available before the motion is due.  
For
instance, under defendant’s interpretation, if the motion to compel due date is
March 1 and counsel agree on February 23 for a two week extension, then the
time to file the motion is February 23 plus two weeks.  That is an absurd interpretation because
there is no “two week extension.”  There
would only be time until March 9th to file the motion.  That is not a two week extension (extension
meets extending the time).  It would only
be an 8 day extension.  By definition,
the deadline is extended.
The
court finds that a two week extension means two additional weeks from the
current due date.  That is the only
logical explanation for give a “two week extension.”
The
motion was timely filed.
The
Preliminary Objections and Definitions are stricken as not allowed by
Code.  The responses are not Code compliant.  There is statutory
language which must be used.  The intent is that all responsive documents
be identified, even if not produced.  
The court
orders defendant to file a verified Code compliant response within 10
days.  The matter will be continued to _________ for the court to review
the court ordered response which must be filed with the court prior to the
hearing. All responsive documents must be identified and accounted for. 
If being withheld by privilege, they must be shown on the privilege
log.  
The
individual objections are overruled for purposes of identification.
IT
IS SO ORDERED.
