And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel filed by the plaintiff. The defendant's counsel had argued that a two-week extension granted by the court meant that the defendant had two weeks from the date of the extension to file the motion, rather than two weeks from the original due date. The judge rejected this interpretation, finding that a two-week extension means two additional weeks from the current due date. The judge ruled that the motion was timely filed and granted a two-week extension, which means that the defendant has until March 9th to file the motion. The judge also struck the defendant's Preliminary Objections and Definitions as not being compliant with Code requirements and ordered the defendant to file a verified, Code-compliant response within 10 days. The matter will be continued to a future date for the court to review the defendant's response, which must be filed with the court prior to the hearing.
