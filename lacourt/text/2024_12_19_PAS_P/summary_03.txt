And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendant's motion to quash the subpoena for her medical records is GRANTED. The defendant argued that the subpoena violated her constitutional right to privacy, as she did not assert any injuries or damages related to the accident and had not waived her privacy rights by testifying during her deposition. The judge found that the defendant's right to privacy outweighed the plaintiff's need for discovery, as the defendant's medical records were not essential to resolving the core issue in the case, which is the plaintiff's injuries and damages. The judge also denied the plaintiff's request for sanctions against the defendant, finding that the defendant's motion to quash was substantially justified and that the plaintiff's opposition was reasonable given the disputed nature of the defendant's deposition testimony.
