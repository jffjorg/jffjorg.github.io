 Case Number:  24NNCV01373    Hearing Date:   December 19, 2024    Dept:  P [TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING
PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT I.         INTRODUCTION
This is a breach of guaranty case. Plaintiff JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.
(“Plaintiff”) is the lender, and Defendant Tristam A. Steinberg (“Defendant”)
is the guarantor of a $500,000 line of credit issued to Design Medium LLC
(“Design Medium”). Plaintiff filed the action on May 3, 2024.
On June 27, 2024, Defendant filed a general denial. On August 26, 2024,
Plaintiff filed a motion for summary judgment on its sole cause of action for
breach of guaranty, seeking judgment in the total amount of $510,017.01, which
includes principal, late fees, and attorneys’ fees and costs. The motion is
unopposed.
II.        LEGAL STANDARD
The function of a motion for
summary judgment or adjudication is to allow a determination as to whether an
opposing party cannot show evidentiary support for a pleading or claim and to
enable an order of summary dismissal without the need for trial. (Aguilar v.
Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) CCP Section 437c(c)
“requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment if all the evidence
submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence’ and
uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that there is no triable
issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment
as a matter of law.” (Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7
Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.) “The function of the pleadings in a motion for summary
judgment is to delimit the scope of the issues; the function of the affidavits
or declarations is to disclose whether there is any triable issue of fact
within the issues delimited by the pleadings.” (Juge v. County of Sacramento
(1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 59, 67, citing FPI Development, Inc. v. Nakashima
(1991) 231 Cal. App. 3d 367, 381-382.) 
As to each claim as framed by the
complaint, the defendant moving for summary judgment must satisfy the initial
burden of proof by presenting facts to negate an essential element, or to
establish a defense. (CCP § 437c(p)(2); Scalf v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005)
128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1520.) Courts “liberally construe the evidence in support
of the party opposing summary judgment and resolve doubts concerning the
evidence in favor of that party.” (Dore v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc.¿(2006)
39 Cal.4th 384, 389.) 
Once the defendant has met that
burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that a triable issue of one
or more material facts exists as to that cause of action or a defense
thereto.  
To establish a triable issue of
material fact, the party opposing the motion must produce substantial
responsive evidence. (Sangster v. Paetkau (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 151,
166.)¿
III.      ANALYSIS
Plaintiff moves for summary
judgment on its sole cause of action for breach of guaranty against Defendant.
Plaintiff seeks judgment in the total amount of $510,017.01, which includes
$499,926.02 in principal, $1,500.00 in late fees and costs, and $8,590.99 in
attorneys’ fees and costs. Plaintiff contends that no triable issue of material
fact exists and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.
The elements of a breach of
guaranty are: (1) the defendant guaranteed payment of the indebtedness of the
primary obligor to the plaintiff; (2) a default on the indebtedness occurred;
(3) the plaintiff notified the guarantor of the default; and (4) the guarantor
failed to remit funds to the plaintiff under the guaranty agreement. (Torrey
Pines Bank v. Sup. Ct. (1989) 216 Cal.App.3d 813, 819.) Additionally,
"a guarantor may validly waive rights and defenses in the guaranty
contract." (Central Bldg., LLC v. Cooper (2005) 127 Cal.App.4th
1053, 1059.)
Under Code of Civil Procedure
section 437c(c), summary judgment is proper if all evidence and reasonable
inferences drawn from it establish that no triable issue of material fact
exists and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.
The moving party bears the initial burden of producing admissible evidence
demonstrating entitlement to judgment, after which the burden shifts to the
opposing party to raise a triable issue of fact.
Plaintiff has satisfied its burden
of demonstrating each element of its breach of guaranty cause of action,
supported by uncontroverted evidence. Plaintiff provides the declaration of
Barbra J. Lopez, an employee of Plaintiff serving as a Special Credits Analyst
II with a corporate title of Associate, who attests to the relevant facts.
Plaintiff presents evidence that Defendant executed a Continuing Guaranty on
July 25, 2019, unconditionally guaranteeing payment of all obligations of
Design Medium under a $500,000 line of credit. (Lopez Decl., ¶ 4, Exh.
2.) Plaintiff further establishes that Design Medium defaulted under the loan
agreement by failing to make monthly payments beginning in November 2023.
(Lopez Decl., ¶¶ 5, 7, Exh. 3.) On January 22, 2024, Plaintiff notified
Defendant of the default and demanded payment pursuant to the terms of the
Guaranty. (Lopez Decl., ¶ 6, Exh. 4.) Despite receiving notice, Defendant has
failed to cure the default or remit any payments under the Guaranty. (Lopez
Decl., ¶¶ 6-8.) The evidence provided establishes that Plaintiff has met its
burden of proof on all elements of the claim.
The Court finds that Plaintiff has
presented sufficient evidence to establish all elements of its breach of
guaranty claim. Moreover, Defendant’s failure to file an opposition to the
motion for summary judgment further supports Plaintiff's entitlement to
judgment. 
Plaintiff also seeks $8,590.99 in
attorneys’ fees and costs incurred in pursuit of remedies under the Guaranty.
These fees are supported by the Declaration of Joshua K. Partington and are
reasonable given the scope and nature of the case. (Partington Decl., ¶ 2.)
For the foregoing reasons, the
Court finds that Plaintiff has established its entitlement to judgment as a
matter of law. Defendant failed to raise a triable issue of material fact or
oppose the motion. Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion for summary
judgment. Judgment shall be entered in favor of Plaintiff JPMorgan Chase Bank,
N.A., and against Defendant Tristam A. Steinberg in the total amount of
$510,017.01.
IV.       CONCLUSION AND ORDER

Plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment.
