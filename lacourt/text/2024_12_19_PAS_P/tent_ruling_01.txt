  Case Number:  19GDCV00188    Hearing Date:   December 19, 2024    Dept:  P [TENTATIVE] ORDER DENYING CROSS-DEFENDANT’S
MOTION FOR APPOINTMENT OR RECEIVERI.         INTRODUCTION
This case arises from a contract dispute over construction work.
Cross-Complainant Business Alliance Insurance Company (“BAIC”) filed a
Cross-Complaint against Cross-Defendant LSI General Engineering &
Construction Co. and Levon Isadzhanyan (“Isadzhanyan”) for indemnity and
reimbursement related to a contractor’s license bond.
On August 2, 2023, the Court entered a default judgment in favor of BAIC
and against Isadzhanyan in the amount of $18,199.46.
On November 21, 2024, Isadzhanyan, appearing in pro per, filed a motion
for the appointment of a receiver. On December 6, 2024, BAIC filed an
opposition to Plaintiff’s motion arguing potential relief under CCP 437(b) is
unwarranted.
II.        LEGAL STANDARD
Receivers are agents of the court and may be appointed only where
authorized by statute.  (Marsch v. Williams (1994) 23 Cal.App.4th
238, 246.)  A judge may appoint a receiver for an action pending before
that judge when a corporation is dissolved.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 564,
subd. (b)(5).)  The appointment of a receiver is a drastic remedy to be utilized
only in “exceptional cases.”  (City & County of San Francisco v.
Daley (1993) 16 Cal.App.4th 734, 744.)  As such, a receiver should not
be appointed unless absolutely essential and because no other remedy will serve
its purpose.  (Ibid.)  A party who seeks appointment of a
receiver of certain property has the burden to establish by a preponderance of
the evidence that the receivership is necessary.  (See Alhambra-Shumway
Mines, Inc. v. Alhambra Gold Mine Corp. (1953) 116 Cal.App.2d 869,
873.) 
III.      ANALYSIS
On November 21, 2024, Isadzhanyan, in
pro per, filed a motion for the appointment of a receiver. The Court finds that
the motion does not cite any legal authority or provide any substantive basis
for the request. Instead, Isadzhanyan appears to request a meeting with the
Court to discuss payment obligations stemming from the default judgment, which
they claim they were unaware of.
BAIC filed an opposition addressing
potential relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b) (set aside),
arguing that such relief is not warranted. However, Isadzhanyan has neither
cited section 473(b) nor framed the motion as one seeking relief from the
default judgment. The motion focuses solely on the appointment of a receiver,
without articulating any legal basis for such a request.
As the moving party, Isadzhanyan
bears the burden of demonstrating that the statutory requirements for the
appointment of a receiver are met. The Court finds that this burden has not
been met. The motion fails to cite any legal authority or present any argument
demonstrating why the appointment of a receiver is warranted under Code of
Civil Procedure section 564 or any other statutory provision. Without such
authority or argument, the Court cannot evaluate the appropriateness of the
request.
Additionally, while BAIC’s
opposition addresses relief under section 473(b), Isadzhanyan has not raised or
argued for such relief. As a result, the Court declines to address BAIC’s
opposition in detail, as it does not pertain to the request currently before
the Court.
Accordingly, the motion is DENIED.
IV.       CONCLUSION AND ORDER
            The Court DENIES
Isadzhanyan motion for appointment of receiver. 
BAIC is to give notice.
