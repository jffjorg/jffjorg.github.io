And here is a summary in English text:

Judge Jared D. Moses has issued a tentative ruling denying Isadzhanyan's motion for the appointment of a receiver. The motion was filed by Isadzhanyan, who is the cross-defendant in a contract dispute with Business Alliance Insurance Company (BAIC). Isadzhanyan claimed to be unaware of payment obligations stemming from a default judgment entered in favor of BAIC and against him on August 2, 2023. However, the motion did not cite any legal authority or provide a substantive basis for the request. The court found that Isadzhanyan failed to meet his burden of demonstrating that the statutory requirements for the appointment of a receiver were met. As a result, the motion was denied.
