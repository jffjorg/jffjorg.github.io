 Case Number:  23AHCV02326    Hearing Date:   December 19, 2024    Dept:  P [TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING DEFENDANTS’
MOTION TO QUASH SUBPOENA TO HUNTINGTON MEMORIAL HOSPITAL and DENYING SANCTIONSI.         INTRODUCTION
On October 23, 2023, Plaintiff
Vaneza Alfaro (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Defendant Liliana Deluca
(“Defendant”), alleging injuries arising from an automobile collision.
On October 31, 2023, Defendant
filed instant motion to quash subpoena seeking her medical records from
Huntington Memorial Hospital. Plaintiff filed an opposition to the motion on
December 4, 2023. On December 12, 2023, Defendant filed a reply. 
 
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARD
            Code of
Civil Procedure section 1987.1 states, “When a subpoena requires…the production
of [documents], the court, upon motion reasonably made by the party, the
witness or any consumer described in Section 1985.3…may make an order quashing
the subpoena entirely, modifying it, or directing compliance with it upon such
terms or conditions as the court shall declare, including protective
orders.”  “The court may make any other order as may be appropriate to
protect the parties, the witness, or the consumer from unreasonable or
oppressive demands including unreasonable violations of a witness’s or
consumer’s right of privacy.”  (Id.) 
As a general rule, all unprivileged
information that is relevant to the subject matter of the action is
discoverable if it would itself be admissible evidence at trial or if it
appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.
(Code Civ. Proc. § 2017.010; Schnabel v. Superior Court. (1993) 5
Cal.4th 704, 711.) When the information sought to be discovered impacts a
person’s constitutional right to privacy, limited protections come into play
for that person. (Shaffer v. Superior Court (1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 993,
999.) The protections cover both a person’s personal and financial matters. (Id.)
The court must balance competing rights — the right of a litigant to discover
relevant facts and the right of an individual to maintain reasonable privacy —
in determining whether the information is discoverable. (Id.) 
            For
discovery purposes, information is relevant if it might reasonably assist a
party in evaluating the case, preparing for trial, or facilitating settlement.
(Gonzalez v. Superior Court (1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 1539, 1546.) 
 
III.      ANALYSIS
Defendant seeks to quash arguing
that the subpoena violates her constitutional right to privacy. Defendant
contends that her medical condition is not at issue in this litigation, as she
has not asserted any injuries or damages related to the accident. She further
argues that Plaintiff’s subpoena constitutes an improper "fishing
expedition" intended to harass and intimidate, rather than to obtain
relevant evidence. (Motion, pp. 3-6)
Plaintiff opposes the motion to
quash, asserting that Defendant waived her privacy rights by voluntarily
testifying about her condition during her deposition. Specifically, Plaintiff
argues that Defendant repeatedly emphasized her lack of injuries and downplayed
the force of the impact to undermine the credibility of Plaintiff’s claimed
injuries. Plaintiff contends that this testimony opened the door to limited
discovery of Defendant’s medical records, as they are directly relevant to
evaluating the force of the impact of the incident and challenging Defendant’s
credibility. (Opposition, pp. 2-6)
The Court must¿carefully
balance¿the right of privacy against the need for disclosure.¿¿(Britt v.
Superior Court (1978) 20 Cal.3d 844, 855-56; see also¿John B. v.
Superior Court (2006) 38 Cal.4th 1177, 1199.) ¿The¿ascertainment of the
truth¿in connection with legal proceedings is a compelling state interest.¿¿(Britt
v. Superior Court¿(1978) 20 Cal.3d 844, 857.)¿ In balancing the divergent
interests, the court considers the¿purpose of the information sought,
the¿effect that disclosure will have¿on the affected persons and parties,
the¿nature of the objections¿urged by the party resisting disclosure, and
the¿availability of the alternative, less intrusive means¿for obtaining the
requested information.¿¿(Hooser v. Superior Court (2000) 84 Cal.App.4th
997, 1005.)¿ The more sensitive the nature of the personal information that is
sought, the more substantial the showing of the need for the discovery that
will be required before disclosure will be permitted.¿¿(Id. at
1004.) 
Here, the Court finds that
Defendant’s constitutional right to privacy outweighs Plaintiff’s need for
discovery. Defendant has not placed her medical condition at issue, as she has
made no claims for injuries or damages in connection with this case. While
Defendant did testify during her deposition that she was "fine" and
"not injured," the Court concludes that this testimony does not waive
her privacy rights.
Further, on balance, the competing
interests favor Defendant’s privacy rights over Plaintiff’s need to discover
information for impeachment or credibility purposes. Defendant’s medical
records are not essential to resolving the core issue in this case, which is
Plaintiff’s injuries and damages, not Defendant’s condition.
 
Accordingly, the Court GRANTS
Defendant’s motion to quash the subpoena for her medical records.
Sanctions
Defendant moves the Court for
monetary sanctions against Plaintiff and her counsel, arguing that Plaintiff’s
subpoena constitutes a misuse of the discovery process by seeking irrelevant
and private information that is not reasonably calculated to lead to the
discovery of admissible evidence. (Motion, p.7)
Plaintiff also moves the Court for
monetary sanctions, contending that Defendant’s motion to quash is meritless
and that Defendant failed to comply with statutory procedural requirements,
including the timely service of required documents. Plaintiff argues that
Defendant’s failure to withdraw the motion despite multiple meet-and-confer
efforts forced Plaintiff to incur unnecessary attorney’s fees and costs,
warranting sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure sections 2023.010(e) and
2025.420(h). (Opposition, pp. 6-8)
The Court finds that neither party
is entitled to sanctions. While Defendant’s motion to quash is ultimately
granted, the Court determines that Plaintiff’s opposition was substantially
justified, given the disputed nature of Defendant’s deposition testimony and
Plaintiff’s reasonable belief that the testimony placed Defendant’s medical
condition at issue. Similarly, while Plaintiff’s subpoena may have been overly
broad, the Court finds no evidence that it was issued in bad faith or with the
intent to harass Defendant.
Accordingly, the Court DENIES
requests for monetary sanctions.
 
IV.       CONCLUSION
The Court GRANTS Defendant’s Motion
to Quash Subpoena to Huntington Memorial Hospital.
Defendant is to give notice.
