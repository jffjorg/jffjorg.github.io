The court grants Plaintiff/Guardian ad Litem Honey Asgari's petition for approval of a compromise of claim or action, with the condition that no attorney's fees or costs are to be subtracted from the $2,000.00 awarded to the minor, Liliana Mirzabeigi. The compromise settles a claim arising from the tenancy of the minor's parents with the defendants, Fox Hills Drive, LLC and Marmar Management, LLC. The court finds that the compromise is generally reasonable and that the procedures have been followed. The minor will receive the full $2,000.00 awarded, without any deduction for attorney's fees or costs.
