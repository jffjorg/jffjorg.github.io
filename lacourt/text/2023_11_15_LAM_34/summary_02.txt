And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling grants the motion to quash the service of summons filed by the defendant, The Regents of the University of California. The defendant claims that the plaintiff did not properly serve the summons at the correct address, 111 Franklin Street, 8th Floor, Oakland, California 94607. The plaintiff has not opposed the motion or presented any evidence that the defendant was properly served. The court finds that the service of summons was made at an improper address, 437 N. Oakhurst Drive, Apt. 101, Beverly Hills, California 90210-3918, and therefore quashes the proof of service of summons.
