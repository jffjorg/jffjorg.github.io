And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies the Demurrer filed by the Defendants, N. Francowitz, Inc. and Nancy Franco, to the First Amended Complaint (FAC) filed by Plaintiff Crystal Gomez. The Demurrer argued that the FAC did not adequately allege joint employer liability and conspirator liability.

The Judge's analysis concluded that the FAC is sufficient to state a claim for joint employer liability, and that the allegations of joint employer liability are not uncertain, vague, or ambiguous. The Judge also concluded that the FAC is sufficient to state a claim for conspirator liability, and that the allegations of conspirator liability are not uncertain, vague, or ambiguous.

The Judge also denied the Motion to Strike filed by the Defendants, which sought to strike various paragraphs in the FAC regarding employment, joint employment, conspiracy, and control of Plaintiff's employment. The Judge concluded that it is not appropriate to strike these allegations, as Plaintiff is entitled to make them and will ultimately be responsible for proving them in order to obtain the relief she seeks.
