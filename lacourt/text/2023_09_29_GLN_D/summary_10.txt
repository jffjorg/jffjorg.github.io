## English Summary

The judge is considering a demurrer (a legal objection) filed by Defendant Peter K. Robbins against Plaintiff Tabitha De La Torre's complaint.  The complaint alleges that Robbins wrongfully removed De La Torre's access to her email accounts used for business communications with him, impacting her ability to defend herself in a separate lawsuit he filed against her. 

The judge notes that both cases involve the same parties and similar claims. To ensure consistency, the judge is continuing the demurrer hearing to allow both cases to be evaluated as related. They will need a determination from the court handling the earlier filed case (Case No. 20 STCV 20770) to proceed.

Here is an English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by the defendant, Peter K. Robbins, in the case of De La Torre v. Robbins. The plaintiff, Tabitha De La Torre, alleges that the defendant breached their partnership agreement and the covenant of good faith and fair dealing by removing her access to her email accounts, which contained crucial communications related to their joint business ventures. The defendant had urged the plaintiff to sell a property held by their company, Lucas King, LLC, but the plaintiff refused, and the defendant subsequently filed a lawsuit against her in 2020. The plaintiff lost access to her email accounts shortly after being served with the lawsuit and was unable to regain access. The judge has continued the demurrer to October 27, 2023, to allow the parties to obtain a related case determination in a separate case, LASC Case No. 20 STCV20770, which is pending in Department 40. The judge has ordered the parties to seek a related case determination and file a notice regarding the status of the determination no later than nine court days prior to the continued hearing. The judge has also encouraged audio or video appearances and provided instructions for remote appearances.
