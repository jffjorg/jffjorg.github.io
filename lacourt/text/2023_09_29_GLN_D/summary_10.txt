And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling continues the demurrer brought by defendant Peter K. Robbins to the complaint filed by plaintiff Tabitha De La Torre. The demurrer is based on CCP section 430.10(c), which permits a party to object to a pleading on the ground that there is another action pending between the same parties on the same cause of action. The court notes that the related case determination will be made by the court in the other matter, LASC Case No. 20 STCV20770, which was filed earlier. The demurrer is therefore continued to permit the parties to obtain a related case determination in the other matter. The parties are ordered to seek a related case determination in the other matter and file and serve a notice in this matter concerning the status of the related case determination no later than nine court days prior to the continued hearing on the demurrer.

## English Summary

The judge is considering a demurrer (a legal objection) filed by Defendant Peter K. Robbins against Plaintiff Tabitha De La Torre's complaint.  The complaint alleges that Robbins wrongfully removed De La Torre's access to her email accounts used for business communications with him, impacting her ability to defend herself in a separate lawsuit he filed against her. 

The judge notes that both cases involve the same parties and similar claims. To ensure consistency, the judge is continuing the demurrer hearing to allow both cases to be evaluated as related. They will need a determination from the court handling the earlier filed case (Case No. 20 STCV 20770) to proceed.
