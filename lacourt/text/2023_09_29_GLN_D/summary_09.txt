And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling denies the motion for change of venue pursuant to CCP sections 395 and 396b, but grants the motion for change of venue pursuant to CCP section 397(c). The court finds that the convenience of witnesses and the ends of justice would be promoted by changing the place of trial to Santa Cruz County.

The defendants argue that the venue is proper in Santa Cruz County, where the subject premises are located, and that the plaintiffs' venue choice is not proper. The defendants claim that the inclusion of defendant Dine Brands Global, Inc. (DBG) as a defendant was not improper or made solely for the purpose of having the action tried in the county where DBG resides.

The court finds that the showing submitted by defendants is self-serving and not supported by documentation, and that the conflicting showing by plaintiffs is sufficient to satisfy the court that the inclusion of defendant DBG in this lawsuit was not improper or made solely for the purpose of having the action tried in the county where DBG resides.

The court concludes that the defendants have sufficiently established that the convenience of witnesses and the ends of justice would be promoted by changing the place of trial of this matter to the County of Santa Cruz. The court orders the transfer of the case to the Superior Court of the County of Santa Cruz.
