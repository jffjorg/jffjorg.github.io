The notice of motion is unclear, suggesting both a transfer to Van Nuys and West Covina, and not providing sufficient notice for an order transferring the case anywhere. The Defendant has failed to meet its burden of showing that the action was not commenced in the proper court, that venue is not proper in this County, or that this current department is an inconvenient forum. The Court has also denied the motion as it does not provide sufficient evidence to support a transfer to Orange County. The matter is set for a hearing on September 29, 2023.
