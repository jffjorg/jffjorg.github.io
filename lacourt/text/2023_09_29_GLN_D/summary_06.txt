```

The tentative ruling discusses the defendant's motion for summary adjudication of each cause of action, and the defendant's argument that the plaintiff will be unable to establish each cause of action because she cannot prove an essential element of each claim. The defendant relies on Rodriguez v. FCA US, LLC (2022) 77 Cal.App.5th 209, which held that the Song-Beverly Act does not apply to sales of used vehicles with a balance remaining on the new vehicle warranty. The plaintiff argues that Rodriguez is distinguishable and that the facts of the case are different from those in Rodriguez. The judge will consider the arguments and evidence presented and make a ruling on the defendant's motion.
