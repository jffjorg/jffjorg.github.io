And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling denies two motions to compel responses to discovery requests filed by Plaintiff Arvin Pairavi. The motions are denied without prejudice because the parties have not yet complied with the Addendum to Case Management Conference Order (Song-Beverly Litigation), which was signed and entered by the Court on January 24, 2023. The Order provides for a stay of all formal discovery pending further order of the Court. The Court orders the parties to engage in good faith meet and confer concerning compliance with the Order and to serve any further discovery and engage in any further discovery proceedings or motions in compliance with the Order and this Minute Order.
