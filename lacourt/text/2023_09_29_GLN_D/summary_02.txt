The court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel further responses to plaintiff's requests for production of documents. The motion was originally heard on July 21, 2023, but was continued to this date. The court has ordered the parties to engage in a good faith meet and confer concerning the documents produced and any gaps, in light of the court's order and the entry of the stipulated protective order. The court has also ordered the parties to meet and confer in good faith concerning compliance with the court's addendum to case management conference order (Song-Beverly litigation), signed and entered by the court on January 24, 2023. The court has denied the motion without prejudice as moot, in light of the production of responsive documents by the defendant prior to the hearing on this matter. The parties are ordered to serve any further discovery or discovery responses, and engage in any further discovery proceedings or motions in compliance with the order and this minute order.
