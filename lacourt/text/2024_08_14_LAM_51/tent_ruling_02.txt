   [1]  The original adult Plaintiffs bring this action against Rosecrans only while  the minor Plaintiffs bring this action against both Rosecrans and Hwy 101. (FAC  ¶ 2.)   [2]  Plaintiffs’ reliance on Comm. On  Children’s Television, Inc. v. Gen. Foods Corp. (1983) 35 Cal.3d 197 is  misplaced.      [3]  Plaintiffs incorporate this argument about vague and uncertain allegations  throughout.   [4]  Plaintiffs argue that since the statute says “dwelling” and not “dwelling unit”  the Legislature intended an expansive application. (Opp. 9:16-25.)    [5]  Hwy 101 relies  on El Escorial Owners’ Assn. v. DLC  Plastering, Inc. (2007) 154 Cal.App.4th 1337 (El Escorial) for the proposition that Plaintiff cannot plead both  negligence and private nuisance if the claims rely on the same facts and  request the same monetary damages.
