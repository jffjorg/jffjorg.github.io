Summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling considers the case brought by the original adult and minor plaintiffs against Rosecrans and Hwy 101. The judge notes that the plaintiffs' reliance on Comm. On Children's Television, Inc. v. Gen. Foods Corp. is misplaced, and that their arguments about vague and uncertain allegations are not supported. The judge also disagrees with the plaintiffs' interpretation of the statute, which they claim intended an expansive application. Hwy 101, on the other hand, relies on El Escorial Owners' Assn. v. DLC Plastering, Inc. to argue that the plaintiffs cannot plead both negligence and private nuisance claims if they rely on the same facts and seek the same monetary damages. The judge has not yet made a final ruling on the matter.
