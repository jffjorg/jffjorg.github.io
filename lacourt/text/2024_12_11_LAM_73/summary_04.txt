And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to set aside the default judgment. The defendant, Nesrine Bentaya, claims that she did not have actual notice of the lawsuit until late August 2024, and that her ex-husband, Elhadi Bentaya, used her name to enter into a lease without her permission. The judge finds that the defendant's lack of notice was not caused by her own avoidance of service or inexcusable neglect, and that she is entitled to relief under California Civil Procedure Code section 473. The judge orders the defendant to file her proposed answer and cross-complaint within 10 days, and sets aside the default judgment.
