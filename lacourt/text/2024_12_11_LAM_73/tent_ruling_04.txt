I. BACKGROUND
 
On April 23,
2024, Plaintiffs Northland Thea LLC, Northland Thea Portfolio LLC, Northland
Thea Portfolio II LLC, Northland Thea Portfolio III LLC, and Northland Thea IV
LLC filed the instant action against Defendant Nesrine Bentaya. Plaintiff
allege a cause of action for Breach of Lease. 
 
The Complaint
alleges the following. On or about July 27, 2022, Defendant Nesrine Bentaya
(“Defendant”), as tenant, and Plaintiffs’ predecessor in interest, Greenland LA
Metropolis Development III LLC, DBA “Thea at Metropolis,” as landlord, entered
into an 18-month lease (the “Lease”) for Unit 3208 of Thea, more specifically
described as 1000 W. 8th Street, Unit 3208, Los Angeles, CA 90017 (the
“Premises”). (Compl., ¶ 11.) After entering
the Lease, Defendant stopped paying rent, but continued to occupy the Premises.
(Compl., ¶ 13.) On or about June 15, 2023, Plaintiffs served Defendant with a
Three-Day Notice to Pay Rent or Quit for non-payment of rent from April 2023 to
June 2023. (Compl., ¶ 14.) On or about June 28, 2023, after Defendant did not pay rent or
quit within the threeday notice period, Plaintiffs brought an unlawful detainer
action against Defendant seeking, inter alia, forfeiture of the Lease,
possession of the Premises, and past-due rent due from April 2023 onward (the
“Unlawful Detainer Action”). (Compl., ¶ 15.)
On August 18,
2023, the Court in the Unlawful Detainer Action entered judgment against
Defendant for possession of the Premises only and ordered that, inter alia, (i)
the Lease was forfeited and (ii) Defendant was to return the Premises to
Plaintiffs. (Compl., ¶ 16.)
On or about
October 24, 2023, Defendant vacated the Premises. (Compl., ¶ 17.)
Defendant is
liable for the full amount of Plaintiffs’ damages, including at least
$52,000.00 in past-due rent. (Compl., ¶ 18.)
 
On July 15, 2024, default was entered against
Defendant.
 
On July 15, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Request for Entry
of Default Judgment. Plaintiff seeks judgment against Defendant
in the total amount of $53,200, consisting of $52,000 in damages and $1,200 in
attorney fees. The Court denied Plaintiff’s Request for Entry of Default
Judgment without prejudice.
 
On October 25, 2024, Defendant filed the instant
Motion to Set Aside Default Judgment, arguing:
·      
Defendant seeks an order setting aside the default against
her and allow Defendant to file an answer and cross-complaint in this action
·      
Defendant argues that she failed to answer Plaintiffs’
complaint because she does not recall being served with the summons and
complaint. She asserts that the first pleading she received was
Plaintiff's Request for Default Judgment in late August 2024.
·      
Defendant contends that her ex-husband Elhadi Bentaya
(“Elhadi”) had used her name and/or personal information to enter into the
subject lease. Defendant asserts that she did not give him permission to use
her name and/or personal information. Defendant also had no knowledge that
Elhadi was in default of his rental payments.
 
No opposition or reply were filed.
 
II.ANALYSIS
 
A.      Legal
Standard 
 
“The court may, upon any terms as may be just, relieve a party or
his or her legal representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other
proceeding taken against him or her through his or her mistake, inadvertence,
surprise, or excusable neglect.”  CCP § 473(b).  CCP § 473(d)
provides in relevant part that “[t]he court may, upon motion of the injured party…set
aside any void judgment or order.” 
 
CCP § 473.5(a) provides that “[w]hen service of a summons has not
resulted in actual notice to a party in time to defend the action and a default
judgment has been entered against him or her in the action, he or she may serve
and file a notice of motion to set aside the default or default judgment and
for leave to defend the action.”  Such a motion “shall be accompanied by
an affidavit showing under oath that the party's lack of actual notice in time
to defend the action was not caused by his or her avoidance of service or
inexcusable neglect. The party shall serve and file with the notice a copy of
the answer, motion, or other pleading proposed to be filed in the
action.”  CCP § 473.5(b).  If the motion is timely and the lack of
actual notice was not caused by the party’s avoidance of service or inexcusable
neglect, the court “may set aside the default or default judgment on whatever
terms as may be just and allow the party to defend the action.  CCP §
473.5(d).  “The notice of motion shall be served and filed within a
reasonable time, but in no event exceeding the earlier of: (i) two years after
entry of a default judgment against him or her; or (ii) 180 days after service
on him or her of a written notice that the default or default judgment has been
entered.”  CCP § 473.5(a). 
 
B.      Discussion
 
Defendant moves to set aside the default pursuant to CCP section
473.5(a) and 473(b). 
 
The Court finds Defendant is entitled to relief. It is well
established that trial courts should be liberal in granting relief under
section 473. (See Kisling v. Otani (1962) 201 Cal.App.2d 62, 66; Brown
v. Martin (1914) 23 Cal.App. 736, 739.) This is because the law favors
resolution of cases on the merits. (See Jones v. Lindsey (1952) 114
Cal.App.2d 237, 239; Brown, supra, 23 Cal.App. at 739.) “Even in a case
where the showing under section 473 is not strong, or where there is any doubt
as to the setting aside of a default, such doubt should be resolved in favor of
the application [of section 473 relief.]” (Arnke v. Lazzari Fuel Co.
(1962) 202 Cal.App.2d 278, 281.) 
 
Here, Defendant sought relief within six months, which is within a
reasonable time. Default was entered on July 15, 2024. Defendant filed the instant motion on October 25, 2024. As this
is within six months, the Court finds the motion is timely.
 
Defendant submitted a declaration stating that did not have actual
notice of this lawsuit until late August 2024. Defendant states “At the end of
August 2024, I received via U.S. mail a copy of plaintiffs' Request for Entry
of Default package. I was surprised and shocked to see that this court document
alleged that I entered into a lease at 1000 W. 8th Street in Los
Angeles… I never entered into the aforementioned lease and never lived at these
premises.” (Nesrine Bentaya Decl., ¶¶ 3-5.) Defendant
asserts that she believes her ex-husband, Elhadi Bentaya, had leased the
premises in her name without her permission. (Nesrine Bentaya Decl., ¶ 7.) Defendant attached a copy of the proposed Answer and
proposed Cross-Complaint against Elhadi Bentaya. (Motion, Exs. 2-3.)
 
The Court
notes that Plaintiffs did not file an opposition. “A party who
has not timely filed written opposition to a motion…may not be afforded an
opportunity to offer oral argument at the hearing.” (Sexton v. Superior
Court (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.) “The failure to file opposition
creates an inference that the motion or demurrer is meritorious.”¿ (Id.)¿
“In such cases, the court may hear argument limited to a request for a
continuance of the hearing in order to afford an opportunity for written
opposition.” (Id.) “[T]he rule is patently intended to prevent the
introduction of legal theories without prior notice to opposing counsel and the
court.” (Id.)
 
Given that any doubts should be resolved in favor of setting aside
the default and the policy of resolving cases on the merits, the Court finds
Defendant is entitled to relief under CCP section 473. 
 
The motion is
GRANTED and Defendant’s default is ordered set aside. Defendant is ordered to
file her proposed Answer and Cross-Complaint—which are attached in support of
the motion—within ten (10) days of the date of this order so that it becomes an
operative pleading in this action.
