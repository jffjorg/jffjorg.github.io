And here is the English text summary:

The Court's tentative ruling grants Defendant Michael Paul Ramsey's motion for judgment on the pleadings on the sixth and seventh causes of action in the Third Amended Complaint (TAC) of Toluca Plaza Partners (TPP). The sixth cause of action alleges that Paul breached a contract with TPP, and the seventh cause of action alleges that Paul breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing implied in the contract. The Court finds that the allegations of an email correspondence between Paul and his brother Patrick Allen Ramsey extending the contract's expiration date do not satisfy the integration clause of the contract, which requires any modifications to be set forth in a writing executed by both parties. As a result, the contract expired on December 31, 2017, and Paul's alleged breach of the contract occurred after the contract had expired. The Court grants Paul's motion for judgment on the pleadings without giving TPP leave to amend, as it does not appear that TPP can adequately plead its claims.
