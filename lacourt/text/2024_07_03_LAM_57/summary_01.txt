And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has granted Plaintiff's amended motion for attorney's fees in the amount of $96,470. The Court found that Plaintiff prevailed on its claim against Defendants Longnan Jin and Wenjie Guo for breach of a nondisclosure agreement (NDA), and therefore is entitled to reasonable attorney's fees under Civil Code 1717(a). The Court also determined that the claim for breach of the NDA was intertwined with other successful claims, making it impractical to apportion the fees incurred by Plaintiff's lawyers between the contract claim and the other claims. As a result, the Court has awarded Plaintiff the full amount of $96,470 in attorney's fees for work on all claims.
