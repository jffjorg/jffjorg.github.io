And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the motion of Sarah Lopez, counsel for Michele Glenn, to be relieved as counsel without prejudice. The motion was filed on November 2, 2023, but no proof of service was filed with form MC-053, which is required by the California Rules of Court. The judge notes that the court has the discretion to grant or deny such a motion, and that an attorney is permitted to withdraw where conflicts between the attorney and client make it unreasonable to continue the representation. However, in this case, the motion is denied due to the lack of proof of service. The moving party is required to give notice of the denial.
