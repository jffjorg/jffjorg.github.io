 Case Number:  22STCV17999    Hearing Date:   November 30, 2023    Dept:  29 Tentative
The motion is denied without prejudice.
Background
On January 27, 2022, Michele Glenn
(“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint relating to an automobile accident on July 20,
2020, involving Defendants C&D Rentals, Kevin Ciara and DOES 1 through 10 for
two causes of action: (1) motor vehicle negligence, and (2) general negligence.

On November 2, 2023, Sarah Lopez (“Counsel”) filed
a motion to be relieved as counsel. No opposition has been filed. 
Legal
Standard
The court may order that an attorney be changed or
substituted at any time before or after judgment or final determination upon
request by either client or attorney and after notice from one to the other.
(Code of Civ. Proc., § 284(b).) An attorney is permitted to withdraw where
conflicts between the attorney and client make it unreasonable to continue the
representation. (See Cal. Rules of Prof. Conduct 3-700(C)(1).) “The
determination whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel lies
within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi & Levine v.
Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1133.)   
 
An application to be relieved as counsel must be made on
Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion) (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.136(c)), and MC-053 (Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362(e)).   
 
Further, the requisite forms must be served on the client
and all other parties who have appeared in the case. (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1362(d).) The court may delay effective date of the order relieving
counsel until proof of service of a copy of the signed order on the client has
been filed with the court. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).) 


Discussion
Counsel has
filed and served forms MC-051 and MC-052 on Plaintiff However, no proof of service
was filed with form MC-053, which is not completely filed out. 
Accordingly, the
Court cannot grant the motion.
Conclusion
The motion to be
relieved as counsel is DENIED without prejudice.
Moving party to
give notice.
