The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal and enter judgment against the defendant. The defendant failed to make payments according to the settlement agreement, which was signed in July 2019. The agreement allowed for the court to retain jurisdiction to enforce the settlement until payment was made. The plaintiff has requested a judgment of $11,634.17, which includes interest and attorney fees. The court has found the settlement agreement to be valid and enforceable under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6. The judgment will be entered in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant in the amount of $11,634.17.
