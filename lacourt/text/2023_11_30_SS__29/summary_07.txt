Summary:
The judge's tentative ruling addresses a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication filed by the defendants, Encino Dental Smile and Faraz Farahnik, in a lawsuit brought by Ilias Farfouris alleging dental malpractice, medical battery/lack of informed consent, and negligent misrepresentation. The defendants argue that all three causes of action are barred by the statute of limitations. The judge finds that there are triable issues as to when the plaintiff discovered or should have discovered the allegedly tortious cause of his injury, and therefore denies the motion as to the statute of limitations. The judge also finds that there are triable issues as to breach of the duty of care and causation, informed consent, and negligent misrepresentation. The ruling notes that the defendants have met their initial burden of showing that they disclosed the inherent risks involved in performing dental procedures, but the plaintiff's evidence nonetheless establishes triable issues as to informed consent.
