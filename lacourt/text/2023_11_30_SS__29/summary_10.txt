And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted City's motion for leave to file cross-complaints against Hot and Cool Corporation and Botach Inc. The motion was unopposed and the judge found that City did not act in bad faith in filing the motion. City seeks to bring its cross-complaints against the proposed cross-defendants in the event that City is found liable for the subject incident. The judge noted that Code of Civil Procedure section 426.50 is liberally construed in favor of granting a motion to file a cross-complaint and must be granted unless the moving party acts in bad faith. The judge authorized City to file the cross-complaints within 10 days and directed the moving party to give notice.
