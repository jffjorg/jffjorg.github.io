And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion for terminating sanctions against the plaintiff. The plaintiff failed to respond to the defendant's discovery requests and did not comply with a court order to provide discovery responses. The defendant filed a motion for terminating sanctions after the plaintiff failed to respond to the discovery requests and did not pay the sanctions ordered by the court. The judge found that the plaintiff's behavior was serious discovery abuse, but did not warrant terminating sanctions at this time. The judge noted that there was no showing of a history or pattern of willful abuse or repeated violations. The motion is denied, but the defendant is free to seek other sanctions or seek terminating sanctions at a later stage of the proceedings if the plaintiff continues to fail to comply with discovery requests.
