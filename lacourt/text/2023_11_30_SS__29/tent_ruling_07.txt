 Case Number:  22STCV08773    Hearing Date:   November 30, 2023    Dept:  29 Tentative
 
THE
COURT WILL HEAR ARGUMENT
 
THIS
IS A PRELIMINARY, PARTIAL TENTATIVE RULING. IT IS NOT A RULING OR COURT ORDER
AND SHOULD NOT BE TREATED OR CONSIDERED AS SUCH.
 
THE COURT HAS QUESTIONS FOR COUNSEL, AS
SET FORTH BELOW.
 
Background
 
On March 10, 2022, Plaintiff Ilias
Farfouris (“Plaintiff”) filed the complaint in this action against Defendants
Encino Dental Smile, Faraz Farahnik, and Does 1 through 20, asserting claims for
(1) dental malpractice; (2) medical battery/lack of informed consent; and (3)
negligent misrepresentation. On June 1, 2022, Defendant Faraz Farahnik filed an
answer.
 
On June 21, 2022, the Court entered a stipulated
order that (among other things) dismissed the claims against Encino Dental
Smile in their entirety with prejudice.
 
On May 25, 2023, Defendants Faraz Farahnik
and Encino Dental Smile (“Defendants”) filed this motion for summary judgment
or, in the alternative, for summary adjudication, along with supporting
evidence and a request for judicial notice. On October 12, Plaintiff filed an
opposition, supporting evidence, and objections to Defendants’ evidence and request
for judicial notice. On October 20, Defendants filed a reply, objections to
Plaintiffs’ evidence, and an additional request for judicial notice.
 
The hearing was initially set for October
27 and was continued, on the Court’s own motion, to November 30.
 
Legal
Standard
 
“The
purpose of the law of summary judgment is to provide courts with a mechanism to
cut through the parties’ pleadings in order to determine whether, despite their
allegations, trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute.” (Aguilar
v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) Code of Civil
Procedure section 437c, subdivision (c), “requires the trial judge to grant
summary judgment if all the evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably
deducible from the evidence’ and uncontradicted by other inferences or
evidence, show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that
the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” (Adler v.
Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.) “The function of
the pleadings in a motion for summary judgment is to delimit the scope of the
issues; the function of the affidavits or declarations is to disclose whether
there is any triable issue of fact within the issues delimited by the
pleadings.” (Juge v. County of Sacramento (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 59, 67, citing
FPI Development, Inc. v. Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 367, 381-382.)
As
to each cause of action as framed by the complaint, a defendant moving for
summary judgment or summary adjudication must satisfy the initial burden of
proof by presenting facts to show “that one or more elements of the cause of
action ... cannot be established, or that there is a complete defense to the
cause of action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2); see also Aguilar,
supra, 25 Cal.4th at pp. 850-851; Scalf v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc.
(2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1520.) Once the defendant has met that burden, the
burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that a “triable issue of one or more
material facts exists as to the cause of action or a defense thereto.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2); see also Aguilar, supra, 25 Cal.4th
at pp. 850-851.)
A
plaintiff or cross-complainant moving for summary judgment or summary
adjudication must satisfy the initial burden of proof by presenting facts to
show “that there is no defense to a cause of action if that party has proved
each element of the cause of action entitling the party to judgment on the
cause of action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(1).) Once the plaintiff
or cross-complainant has met that burden, the burden shift to the defendant or
cross-defendant to show that a “triable issue of one or more material facts
exists as to the cause of action or a defense thereto.” (Ibid.)
The
party opposing a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication may not
simply “rely upon the allegations or denials of its pleadings” but must instead
“set forth the specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact
exists.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subds. (p)(1) & (p)(2). To establish a
triable issue of material fact, the party opposing the motion must produce
substantial responsive evidence. (Sangster v. Paetkau (1998) 68
Cal.App.4th 151, 166.)
Courts
“liberally construe the evidence in support of the party opposing summary
judgment and resolve doubts concerning the evidence in favor of that party.” (Dore
v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 384, 389.)
Request for Judicial Notice
With their moving papers, Defendants request that the Court take judicial
notice of two documents: (1) Exhibit E, a September 14, 2021 letter titled
“Settlement Communication” from Plaintiff’s counsel to Defendants; and (2)
Exhibit F, a , attached as Exhibit E; and (2) a October 14, 2021 letter titled
“Notice of Intent to File Action for Professional Negligence” from Plaintiff’s
counsel to Defendants.
With their reply papers, Defendants request that the Court take judicial
notice of two additional documents: (1) Exhibit G, described as a “letter of
representation” dated August 16, 2021, sent by Plaintiff’s counsel, Sassan
Masserat to Defendants; and (2) Exhibit H, a letter described as “notice of
preservation of evidence” dated August 16, 2021, sent by Plaintiff’s counsel to
Defendants.
Plaintiff objects. 
Plaintiff’s objections are SUSTAINED. These letters are not “facts and
propositions that are not reasonably subject to dispute and are capable of
immediate and accurate determination by resort to sources of reasonably
indisputable accuracy.” (Evid. Code § 452(h).) In addition, Exhibits G and H
are new evidence submitted with the reply papers, which is not proper on a
motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication. Accordingly, the Court DENIES
Defendants’ request to take judicial notice of Exhibits E, F, G, and H. 
Evidentiary
Objections
Each party objects to some of the
evidence presented by the other. Evidence presented in support of, or in
opposition to, a motion for summary judgment must be admissible. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 437c, subd. (d); Perry
v. Bakewell Hawthorne LLC
(2017) 2 Cal.5th 536, 541-43.) The court must “consider all of the evidence set forth in the papers,
except the evidence to which objections have been made and sustained.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (c).)
Plaintiff’s Objections Nos. 1-15 to the Declaration of Edmond R. Hewlett,
D.D.S., are OVERRULED. Among other things, Dr. Hewlett has
appropriate credentials and his testimony relates
to a subject that is sufficiently beyond common experience that the opinion of
an expert witness would assist the trier of act; is based on information of the
type on which an expert may reasonably rely; is based on reasons supported by
the information on which the expert relies; and is not speculative (Evid. Code,
§§ 801-02; Sargon Enterprises v. USC (2012) 55 Cal.4th 747, 771-21.). 
The Court
does not understand Plaintiff’s Objection No. 16 to the Declaration of Dr.
Hewlett. Plaintiff states that he is objecting to Exhibits “Nos. A through I,”
but Dr. Hewlett’s declaration has no exhibits.
Plaintiff’s
Objections Nos. 1 and 2 to the Declaration of Shireen Ashtari are OVERRULED.
(The Court notes that the same Exhibits E and F are at issue in
Defendants’ Request for Judicial Notice and the Declaration of Ms. Ashtari. To
be clear, the Court is not taking judicial notice of Exhibits E and F, but Exhibit
E and F are in evidence for purposes of this motion through the Declaration of
Ms. Ashtari.)
Defendants’ Objections Nos. 1-14 to the Declaration of Edmond M. Tash,
DDS, are OVERRULED. Among other things, Dr. Tash has appropriate credentials
and his testimony relates to a
subject that is sufficiently beyond common experience that the opinion of an
expert witness would assist the trier of act; is based on information of the type
on which an expert may reasonably rely; is based on reasons supported by the
information on which the expert relies; and is not speculative (Evid. Code, §§
801-02; Sargon Enterprises v. USC (2012) 55 Cal.4th 747, 771-21.).
Defendants’ Objections Nos. 15, 17, 18, and 22-26, to the Declaration of Ilias
Farfouris are OVERRULED.
Defendants’ Objection No. 16 to the Declaration of Mr. Farfouris is
SUSTAINED in PART, as to the phrase “and as a result I now have gaps in my
mouth,” and is otherwise OVERRULED.
Defendants’ Objections Nos. 19, 20, 21, and 27 to the Declaration of Mr.
Farfouris are SUSTAINED.
Defendants’ Objections Nos. 28-29 to the Declaration of Sassan Masserat
are SUSTAINED.
Discussion
 
Statute of Limitations – All Causes of Action
“In an action for injury or death against a health care provider based
upon such person’s alleged professional negligence, the time for the
commencement of action shall be three years after the date of injury or one
year after plaintiff discovers, or through the use of reasonable diligence
should have discovered, the injury, whichever occurs first.” (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 340.5.) 
Defendants argue that all three causes of action are barred by the
statute of limitations.
The one-year portion of the statute of limitations begins to run when the
plaintiff became aware, or reasonably should have become aware, of both the
physical manifestation of the injury and its tortious cause. (Arroyo v.
Plosay (2014) 225 Cal.App.4th 279, 291-292.) The plaintiff discovers the
cause of action when he at least suspects that someone has done something wrong
to him. He has reason to suspect when he has “notice or information of
circumstances to put a reasonable person on inquiry.” (Norgart v. Upjohn Co.
(1999) 21 Cal.4th 383, 397-398.) 
Defendants contend that Plaintiff either did or must have suspected
wrongdoing on December 24, 2020, when Plaintiff returned to Dr. Farahnik for an
emergency visit. (Defendants’ Statement of Undisputed Material Facts [“DSUMF”]
Nos. 13-14.) But Plaintiff testified that he took Dr. Farahnik’s reassurances
into account and he did not become suspicious of wrongdoing until the summer of
2021, less than one year before suit was filed. (Exh. C, Plaintiff’s Depo., at
p. 144:3-13].) 
Does this testimony of Plaintiff create a
triable issue as to when he discovered, or should have discovered, the allegedly
tortious cause of his injury? 
First Cause of Action: Dental Malpractice 
In a medical negligence action, a plaintiff must establish the following
elements: “(1) the duty of the professional to use such skill, prudence, and
diligence as other members of his profession commonly possess and exercise; (2)
a breach of that duty; (3) a proximate causal connection between the negligent
conduct and the resulting injury; and (4) actual loss or damage resulting from
the professional's negligence.  [citations.]” (Galvez v. Frields
(2001) 88 Cal.App.4th 1410, 1420.) 
A defendant moving for summary judgment in a medical malpractice action
must “present evidence that would preclude a reasonable trier of fact from
finding it was more likely than not that their treatment fell below the
standard of care.”  (Johnson v. Superior Court (2006) 143
Cal.App.4th 297, 305.)  “When a defendant moves for summary judgment and
supports his motion with expert declarations that his conduct fell within the
community standard of care, he is entitled to summary judgment unless the
plaintiff comes forward with conflicting expert evidence.”  (Munro v.
Regents of University of California (1989) 215 Cal.3d 977, 984-85.) 
Assuming that Dr. Hewlett’s declaration satisfies
Defendant’s initial burden of showing that Defendants were not negligent and
did not cause Plaintiff’s injuries, does Dr. Tash’s declaration nonetheless
establish triable issues as to breach of the duty of care and causation? 
Second Cause of Action for Lack of Informed Consent 
It is unclear to the Court whether this is
a claim for battery (as stated in the caption of the complaint) or for professional
negligence (as is suggested by the allegations in the body of the complaint).
The elements of a cause of action for a failure to obtain informed
consent are: (1) the defendant performed a medical procedure on a patient, (2)
the patient did not give informed consent for the procedure, (3) a reasonable
person in the patient’s position would not have given informed consent, and (4)
the patient was harmed by either a risk that should have been explained or a
breach of the standard of care. (Wilson v. Merritt (2006) 142
Cal.App.4th 1125, 1133-1139.)
When recommending treatment, the physician must disclose all material
information necessary to make an informed decision, including an explanation of
the procedure, likelihood of success, risk if the patient accepts or rejects
the suggested treatment, and any other information a skilled practitioner in
good standing would disclose under similar circumstances. (Mathis v.
Morrissey (1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 332, 343.) 
Plaintiff alleges in the Complaint that Defendants failed to disclose the
inherent risks involved in performing said procedures involving dental
structures, and negligently failed to obtain Plaintiff’s informed consent for
shaving off several teeth. (Compl. ¶ 30.) 
Assuming that Defendants have met their initial
burden of showing that Defendant disclosed the inherent risks involved, and that
Plaintiff appropriately consented to the procedures, does Plaintiff’s evidence
(including Farfouris Decl., ¶¶ 6-7, 9-10 and Tash Decl., ¶¶ 16-19) nonetheless
establish triable issues as to informed consent?   
Third Cause of Action: Negligent Misrepresentation 
The elements of a claim for negligent misrepresentation are a
misrepresentation of fact, lack of reasonable grounds, a duty to plaintiff,
intent to induce reliance, reliance, causation and harm. (Majd v. Bank of
America, N.A. (2015) 243 CA4th 1293, 1307.) 
Plaintiff alleges omissions. (E.g., Opp. p.22:19-21.) The law, however,
appears to be that negligent misrepresentation requires a positive assertion,
not merely an omission or implied representation, even if there is a fiduciary
relationship between the parties. (See Lopez v. Nissan North America, Inc.
(2011) 201 Cal.App.4th 572, 596.) 
Under the applicable authorities, have
Defendants shown that Plaintiff cannot show an essential element of his negligent
misrepresentation claim (an affirmative assertion)?
Conclusion
