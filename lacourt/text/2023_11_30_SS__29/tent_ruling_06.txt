The motion is DENIED.
Background
This cases
arises out of a vehicle accident on September 19, 2021, on the I-10 Freeway
near Alameda Street in Los Angeles.  On
February 1, 2022, Plaintiff Devon Baylor (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint
against Defendants Los Angeles Community Hospital, Alta Los Angeles Hospitals,
Inc., John Doe 1, John Doe 2, and Does 1 through 50, asserting causes of action
for motor vehicle negligence and general negligence.
On April
11, 2022, Defendant Alta Los Angeles Hospitals, Inc. (“Defendant”) filed its
answer.
On April
13, 2022, Plaintiff amended the complaint to name Marlon R. Mejia Paz as John
Doe 1.
On October
12, 2022, the Court granted the motion of Plaintiff’s attorney to be relieved
as counsel.
On
September 18, 2023, the Court granted Defendant’s motion for an order
compelling Plaintiff to provide verified, code-complaint responses, without
objection, to Defendant’s Form Interrogatories (Set One), Special Interrogatories
(Set One), and Requests for Production (Set One) within 30 days of notice.  The Court also ordered Plaintiff to pay
sanctions in the total amount of $832.50 within 30 days of notice.  Plaintiff did not attend the hearing.
Defendant
gave notice of the Court’s ruling by mail sent on September 20, 2023.
Defendant
filed this motion for terminating sanctions on October 26, 2023.  As of the date of filing, Plaintiff had not
served the required discovery responses. 
(Bauerlein Decl., ¶ 14.)
Plaintiff has not filed an opposition.
Trial is set for June 11, 2024.
Legal Standard
“To the extent authorized by the chapter governing any particular
discovery method or any other provision of this title, the court, after notice
to any affected party, person, or attorney, and after opportunity for hearing,
may impose the following sanctions against anyone engaging in conduct that is a
misuse of the discovery process: ... (d) The court may impose a terminating
sanction …."  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030.) “Misuses of the
discovery process include, but are not limited to, the following: ... (d)
Failing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery. ... (g)
Disobeying a court order to provide discovery."  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2023.010.)
The Civil Discovery Act provides for an escalating and
“incremental approach to discovery sanctions, starting with monetary sanctions
and ending with the ultimate sanction of termination.” (Lopez v. Watchtower
Bible & Tract Society of New York, Inc. (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th
566, 604.) Discovery sanctions should be appropriate to and commensurate
with the misconduct, and they “should not exceed that which is required to
protect the interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery.” (Doppes
v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 967, 992.) “If a lesser
sanction fails to curb misuse, a greater sanction is warranted: continuing
misuses of the discovery process warrant incrementally harsher sanctions until
the sanction is reached that will curb the abuse.” (Ibid.; see also,
e.g., Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th
262, 279-280.) 
Terminating sanctions should be used sparingly. (Doppes, supra, 174
Cal.App.4th at p. 992; R.S. Creative, Inc. v. Creative Cotton, Ltd. (1999)
75 Cal. App. 4th 486, 496.) “Although in extreme cases a court has the
authority to order a terminating sanction as a first measure, a terminating
sanction should generally not be imposed until the court has attempted less
severe alternatives and found them to be unsuccessful and/or the record clearly
shows lesser sanctions would be ineffective.” (Lopez, supra, 246 Cal.App.4th
at p. 604.)  But where discovery violations are “willful,
preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe
sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial
court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.” (Doppes, supra, 174
Cal.App.4th at p. 992.) Repeated and willful violations of discovery orders
that prejudice the opposing party may warrant a terminating sanction. (Creed-21
v. City of Wildomar (2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 690, 702; Los
Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 377, 390; Biles
v. Exxon Mobil Corp. (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1327; Lang v.
Hachman (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246; Collisson X Kaplan
v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1617-1622.)
The
primary purpose of discovery sanctions is to obtain compliance with the Civil
Discovery Act and the Court’s orders. It is not to punish. (Newland v.
Super. Ct. (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 608, 613; Ghanooni v. Super
Shuttle of Los Angeles (1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 256, 262.) A discovery
sanction should not create a “windfall” for a party or place a party in a
better position than it would have been if the opposing party had simply
complied with its obligations under the Court’s orders and the Civil Discovery
Act. (Rutledge v. Hewlett-Packard Co. (2015) 238 Cal.App.4th 1164,
1194; see also 2 Weil & Brown, California Practice Guide: Civil Procedure
Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2023), ¶¶ 8:2214-2220.)
A ”terminating
sanction issued solely because of a failure to pay a monetary discovery
sanction is never justified.”  (Newland,
supra, 40 Cal.App.4th at p. 615.) 
Discussion
Defendant
moves for terminating sanctions against Plaintiff for failure to respond to
discovery requests as well as to comply with this Court’s order to respond to
discovery requests.  Defendant does not
seek monetary sanctions or any other form of non-monetary sanctions.
Defendant
initially served Plaintiff with the discovery at issue in April 2022.  (Bauerlein Decl., ¶ 4.) After 18 months and
one order granting a motion to compel, Plaintiff still has not responded.  
Plaintiff
has engaged in serious discovery abuse, including failing to comply with his
obligations to respond to discovery under the Civil Discovery Act and the
failure to comply with this Court’s Order of September 18, 2023.  Serious sanctions are warranted.  But not, at this time, terminating sanctions.  There has not been a showing of a history or
pattern of willful abuse or repeated violations.
Defendant
does not seek any lesser sanction. 
Accordingly, the motion is DENIED.
The
denial is without prejudice to Defendant seeking other sanctions, or seeking a
terminating sanction at a later stage of the proceedings, based on a further
showing of abuse.
Conclusion
Defendant’s
motion is DENIED.
Defendant
is ordered to give notice.
