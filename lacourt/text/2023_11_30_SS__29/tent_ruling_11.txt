 Case Number:  BC682317    Hearing Date:   November 30, 2023    Dept:  29 Tentative
The motion is GRANTED.
Background
On November 3, 2017, State Farm Mutual
Automobile Insurance Company (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Defendants
Tomas Figueroa Arroyo, Martin Gonzaga. Guillermo Meza, Gonzalo Alatorre Toledo alleging
a cause of action arising out of a vehicle collision that occurred on January
27, 2017.
The matter between Plaintiff and Gonzalo
Alatorre Toledo (“Defendant”), was settled in July of 2019, with a Stipulation
for Entry of Judgment entered into between the
parties on September 30, 20219. A Stipulation for Settlement and Order was
filed with the Court on December 23, 2019.
On March 7, 2023, Plaintiff filed
this motion to set aside or vacate the dismissal and for entry of judgment.
Legal Standard
Under
Code of Civil Procedure, section 664.6: 
 
 (a) If parties to pending litigation
stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties outside of the presence
of the court or orally before the court, for settlement of the case, or part
thereof, the court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of
the settlement. If requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction
over the parties to enforce the settlement until performance in full of the
terms of the settlement. 
 
(b) For purposes of this section, a writing is signed by
a party if it is signed by any of the following: (1) The party. (2) An attorney
who represents the party. (3) If the party is an insurer, an agent who is
authorized in writing by the insurer to sign on the insurer's behalf.
 
As the Court of
Appeal has explained, “[T]he request for retention of jurisdiction must conform
to the same three requirements which the Legislature and the courts have deemed
necessary for section 664.6 enforcement of the settlement itself: the request
must be made (1) during the pendency of the case, not after the case has been
dismissed in its entirety, (2) by the parties themselves, and (3) either in a
writing signed by the parties or orally before the court.” (Wackeen v. Malis
(2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 429, 440.)
Discussion
Plaintiff moves to set aside or vacate the dismissal and for entry of
judgment. Plaintiff argues Defendant signed the Stipulation agreement, which
set out a payment schedule for him to pay $4,500.00. (Motion, 6:10-13.)
Defendant paid a total of $1,650.00 and then stopped making payments. (Motion,
6:14; Exhibit 1.) Defendant was sent late payment letters. (Motion, 6:15-16;
Exhibits 2 & 3.)
 
Plaintiff’s evidence includes the stipulation and the
order signed by the Court.  (Motion, Exhibit
1.) The order states, “[T]he case is dismissed with prejudice with the court
retaining jurisdiction to set aside the dismissal and enforce this stipulation
pursuant to C.C.P. § 664.6. (Motion, Exhibit 1, p.4) 
 
The Court finds the Stipulation to be valid and
enforceable under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6.  Defendant ceased making payments, and as of
the date of filing this motion, continues to fail to make payments.
(Declaration of David B. Pillemer (“Pillemer Decl.”), ¶ 5.)  Plaintiff sent notice of change of address,
and payment plan options on January 27, 2022. (Declaration of David B. Pillemer
(“Pillemer Decl.”), ¶ 6.) On November 18, 2022, Plaintiff sent Defendant correspondence
warning Defendant Plaintiff would seek to enforce the judgment provision of the
Stipulation if no payment was received within ten (10) days. (Id.) Plaintiff
requests that a judgment of $11,634.17 based on a principal amount of $9,000.00,
plus interest of $3,847.52 from January 27, 2017 to March 1, 2023 at 7% per
annum and attorney fees of $375.00, and court costs of $61.65, less the payment
Defendant already paid of $1,650.00. (Pillemer Decl., ¶ 7.)  
 
Plaintiff’s request is GRANTED.   Pursuant to
the Stipulation and Order, the dismissal is set aside and the Court approves
the proposed judgment. 
 
 
Conclusion
 
For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff’s Motion
to Set Aside/Vacate the Dismissal and Enter Judgment is GRANTED. 
 
The dismissal is set aside.
 
Judgment is to be entered in favor of
Plaintiff and against Defendant Gonzalo Alatorre Toledo in the amount of $11,634.17.  
 
Moving party is ordered to give notice.
