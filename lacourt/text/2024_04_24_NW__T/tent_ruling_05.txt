 Case Number:  LC107621    Hearing Date:   April 24, 2024    Dept:  T GPL v.
LLHOA LC107621
Tentative
ruling: Motion for sanctions-allocation
After due
consideration, the court awards an additional $2,000 in fees to plaintiff for
the rebuttal and allocates the sanctions of $15,301.65 100% to Myers Widders.  These sanctions are pursuant to CCP section
2025.450 for discovery abuse without substantial justification and are payable
to the Client Trust Account of Salomons Law Group, 4558 Sherman Oaks, Ave.,
Sherman Oaks, CA 91403 by 5/24/2024.  The
grounds for this allocation are that Myers Widders violated a number of court
orders and gave instructions to their clients which resulted in them violating
court orders.  Further support for the allocation
100% to Myers Widders is as adopted by the court in the reasoning of plaintiff
in the rebuttal filed 4/19/2024 and in the original motion filed on 5/27/2022.
