And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has considered the motion for sanctions-allocation and has awarded an additional $2,000 in fees to the plaintiff. The court has also allocated the sanctions of $15,301.65 100% to Myers Widders. These sanctions are due to discovery abuse without substantial justification and are payable to the Client Trust Account of Salomons Law Group by May 24, 2024. The court's decision is based on the violation of court orders by Myers Widders, who gave instructions to their clients that resulted in violating court orders. The court's ruling is supported by the plaintiff's rebuttal filed on April 19, 2024 and the original motion filed on May 27, 2022.
