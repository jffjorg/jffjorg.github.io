And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses several motions in limine filed by both parties. The court grants most of the plaintiff's motions, including excluding evidence of alternate causes of injury and preventing discussion of settlement or responsibility. The court also grants the plaintiff's motion to exclude evidence of insurance, Medicare, or Medi-cal reimbursement rates as evidence of reasonable costs of medical services. The court denies the plaintiff's motion to exclude evidence of loss of wages.

The court grants several of the defendant's motions, including excluding evidence of insurance and preventing mention of settlement or responsibility. The court also grants the defendant's motion to exclude evidence of unpaid medical bills, but denies the motion to exclude evidence of an unpaid bill. The court prohibits counsel from mentioning a dollar amount in voir dire and from asking questions that attempt to precondition the jury or indoctrinate them. The court also prohibits counsel from mentioning insurance, suggesting the jury is setting a community standard of safety, or making statements that may induce jury nullification of the law.
