And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has made a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's motion for attorneys' fees, costs, and expenses. The plaintiff is the prevailing party and is entitled to reasonable fees, costs, and expenses. The court awards reasonable attorneys' fees of $74,642.50, which is based on the reasonable hours worked by the attorneys and the hourly rates charged. The court denies the request for an enhancement and additional fees of $7,500.00 because the plaintiff failed to provide sufficient evidence to show that the hourly rates are below fair market value or that there is a risk of nonpayment. The court grants the request for costs of $11,514.72 and expenses of $525.00.
