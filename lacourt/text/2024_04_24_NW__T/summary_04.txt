And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The Court has sustained the demurrer to the Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint without leave to amend. The Plaintiff's allegations are insufficient to establish a controversy under the declaratory relief and breach of covenant of quiet enjoyment causes of action. The Plaintiff's allegations of an "intangible impediment" to their use of their property are not supported by facts and do not show how the alleged misconduct by the Defendant affects the Plaintiff's use of the easement. The Plaintiff's request for leave to amend is denied as the proposed amendments do not cure the pleading defects identified in the demurrer. The Defendant is directed to submit a proposed Judgment of Dismissal.
