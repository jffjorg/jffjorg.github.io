Introduction 
Plaintiff Bryant Marin
(Plaintiff) moved for attorneys’ fees, costs, and expenses against Defendant
FCA US LLC (Defendant).  (Civ. Code, sec.
1794(d).)  Plaintiff requested fees in
the total amount of $119,463.75; costs in the amount of $11,514.72, and
expenses in the total amount of $525.00. 

The $119,463.75 in attorneys’
fees includes: (1) a 1.5 multiplier of $74,642.50, making fees add up to
$111,963.75; and (2) $7,500 which includes $5,000.00 in fees to review the
opposition, draft a reply, attend the hearing, draft an opposition to a motion
to tax costs, and attend the costs hearing, plus a 1.5 multiplier.
An opposition from Defendant was
due April 11, 2024 but none was filed.
Discussion 
There is no dispute that
Plaintiff is the prevailing party and thus entitled fees, costs, and expenses
per statute.
Statutory attorney fees are
ordinarily determined by the court pursuant to the “lodestar” or “touchstone”
method. However, the Court’s discretion is somewhat limited in fee awards under
the Song Beverly Consumer Warranty Act. 
The statute takes a different approach from customary statutory or
contractual provisions.  The statute
requires an “initial determination of the actual time expended; and then to
ascertain whether under all the circumstances of the case the amount of actual
time expended and the monetary charge being made for the time expended are
reasonable.  These circumstances may
include, but are not limited to, factors such as the complexity of the case and
procedural demands, the skill exhibited and the results achieved. If the time
expended or the monetary charge being made for the time expended is not
reasonable under all the circumstances, then the court must take this into
account and award attorney fees in a lesser amount.” In the situation of a contingency
fee arrangement, the court in Nightingale stated, “for purposes of section
1794, subdivision (d), a prevailing buyer represented by counsel is entitled to
an award of reasonable attorney fees for time reasonably expended by his or her
attorney.”  (Robertson v. Fleetwood
Travel Trailers of California, Inc. (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 785, 817-818 (citing
to Nightingale v. Hyundai Motor America (1994) 31 Cal.App.4th 99, 104-105, fn.
6.)  Plaintiffs’ Counsel, Sean Crandall
(Crandall), asserted that they took the case on a contingency basis.  (Crandall Decl. par. 72.)  Because Crandall attested to taking
Plaintiffs’ case on a contingency basis, Plaintiff is entitled to reasonable
fees for the time reasonably expended. 
Mr. Crandall charged $425/hr. to $490/hr. between 2021 and 2023.  (Crandall Decl. par. 53.)  Plaintiff incurred fees from two additional
attorneys (Attorneys Carey Wood (2.5 hours at $500/hr.) and Vanessa Oliva (1.5
hours at $435/hr.)), and four paralegals (Clarence Serrano ($175 to $200/hr.),
Alexis Valdovinos ($200/hr.), Daisey Hernandez ($175/hr.), and Elaine Astorga
($175/hr.)).  (Crandall Decl. par.
73.)  Plaintiff was charged a total of
179.70 hours as recorded by all counsels and paralegals.   (Crandall Decl. par. 67, Exh. 22.)  The Court finds the amount of time charged
and the hourly rates charged to be reasonable. 
The total amount of $74,642.50 in fees is seen to be reasonable.
As to the 1.5 enhancement, it is
Plaintiff’s burden of proof to show that the enhancement is primarily to
compensate counsel at a rate reflecting the risk of nonpayment in contingency
cases as a class.  (Ketchum v. Moses
(2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1138.)  The aim
is to compensate attorneys at fair market value as an inducement to accept
these cases.  (Id.)  Plaintiff failed to provide any facts to show
that the hourly rates are below fair market value or facts to show a risk of
nonpayment.  The request for an enhancement
is DENIED.
Plaintiff’s request for an
additional $7,500.00 based upon the review of an opposition to the motion,
drafting a reply, appearing at the hearing, reviewing a motion to tax, opposing
it and appearing at that hearing are unfounded. 
No such briefs have been filed. 
Further, Plaintiff’s requested fees reviewed above are sufficient to
cover the time expended at this hearing, especially in light of the instant
motion being unopposed.  The request for
an additional $7,500.00 is DENIED.
Plaintiff’s Cost Memo and the
instant motion requested $11,514.72 in costs. 
The Cost Memo not being placed into issue by a motion to tax/strike
costs provides that there is no dispute to be resolved as to the requested
costs.  
The request for costs is GRANTED,
as requested.  
Plaintiff requested expenses in
the total amount of $525.00 based upon the anticipated court reporter fees for
the instant motion.  Plaintiff provided
that the amount is the minimum charge for a court appearance by the
reporter.  The expense is seen to be
reasonable.  
The request for expenses of
$525.00 is GRANTED, as requested.    
IT IS SO ORDERED, CLERK TO GIVE
NOTICE.
