```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants Tesla's motion to compel arbitration in this Song-Beverly action. The case is stayed pending completion of arbitration. The judge finds that Tesla has met its burden of establishing the existence of a valid arbitration agreement and that Xu has failed to demonstrate an applicable defense to its enforcement. Specifically, the judge finds that Xu's arguments regarding waiver and standing are without merit. The judge also finds that the arbitration provision applies to all disputes arising out of Xu's relationship with Tesla, including Xu's Song-Beverly claims.
