 Case Number:  24PSCV00120    Hearing Date:   July 3, 2024    Dept:  G Plaintiff Amur Equipment Finance, Inc.’s Application
for Default Judgment
Respondent: NO OPPOSITION
TENTATIVE RULING
Plaintiff Amur Equipment Finance, Inc.’s Application
for Default Judgment is GRANTED.
BACKGROUND
This
is a breach of contract action. In March 2022, Plaintiff Amur Equipment
Finance, Inc. (Amur) entered into a written equipment finance agreement with Defendant
Sergio Cantu in which Amur agreed to finance the purchase of a 2016 INTL
Prostar. In support of the agreement, Defendants Lupita Cantu and Sergio Cantu
executed a personal guaranty. Subsequently, in February 2023, Amur alleges the
Cantus breached the agreement by failing to make monthly payments and now owe a
principal sum of $50,748.97.
On January
11, 2024, Amur filed a complaint against the Cantus and Does 1-100, alleging
the following causes of action: (1) breach of written agreement, (2) breach of
continuing guaranty, (3) open book account, (4) account stated, and (5) unjust
enrichment. On January 28, 2024, Amur’s process server personally served Sergio
Cantu and served Lupita Cantu with substitute service in Pomona.
On March
18, 2024, the Court entered default against the Cantus after they failed to
file a timely answer. On May 22, 2024, Amur submitted the present application
for default judgment.
A case
management conference is set for July 3, 2024.
LEGAL STANDARD
Code
of Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a
party has filed to timely respond or appear.  A party seeking judgment on
the default by the court must file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a
brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in
support of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4)
a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a proposed form of judgment; (6) a
dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application
for separate judgment under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of grounds for
each judgment; (7) exhibits as necessary; and (8) a request for attorneys’ fees
if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.  (Cal. Rules of
Court 3.1800.)
ANALYSIS
Amur
seeks default judgment against the Cantus in the total amount of $64,079.57,
including $50,748.97 in damages, $10,861.67 in interest, $1,904.97 in attorney
fees, and $563.96 in costs. Because the Court finds Amur has submitted
sufficient evidence, the Court GRANTS Amur’s application for default
judgment.
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, Amur’s
application for default judgment is GRANTED.
