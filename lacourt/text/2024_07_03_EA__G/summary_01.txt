```

Summary:
The judge's tentative ruling denies Vechik's motion to vacate default judgment, strikes Vechik's motion to unseal the Smith Report, and denies Khodabakhsh's motion for judicial determination regarding discoverability of email communications. The court finds that Vechik's arguments that the default judgment is excessive or unsupported are without merit, and that Khodabakhsh's evidence is sufficient to support the award of damages. The court also rejects Vechik's contentions that the Smith Report contains conclusory analysis, incorrect analysis, and speculation, and that alternative evidence of a reasonable royalty rate exists.
