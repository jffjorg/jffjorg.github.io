And a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English:

The Judge has tentatively ruled on the demurrer to the Second Amended Complaint (SAC) and the motion to strike. The Judge sustained the demurrer as to the fifth and seventh causes of action (fraud and abuse of process) without leave to amend, and overruled the demurrer as to the first, second, third, fourth, and sixth causes of action (unfair competition, intentional interference with prospective economic relations, conversion, and slander of title). The Judge granted the motion to strike the prayer for punitive damages and related allegations in paragraphs 52 and 101 of the SAC.
