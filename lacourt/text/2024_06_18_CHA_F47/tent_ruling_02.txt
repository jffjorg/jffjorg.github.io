Balmain (Balmain).  (Bower Decl. ¶¶2-3).  The complaint was based, in part, on the claim  that when Balmain transferred fee simple title to the Insureds of certain real  property, he failed to notify them of a deed of trust encumbering the property.   Since the Insureds had no prior  knowledge of the encumbrance, the beneficiaries to the deed of trust began efforts  to foreclose on the subject property.  (Complaint ¶¶11, 39-43, 46-47).   Shortly after this action was filed, Plaintiff Chicago  Title Insurance Company (Plaintiff), through the Insureds’ title insurance  policy, paid off the sums due under the encumbrance and procured a full  reconveyance of the deed of trust.  (Brower  Decl. ¶4).  As a result, Defendants  Deutsche Bank, Nationstar, and Barrett were dismissed from the present action.  (Brower Decl. ¶5).  Plaintiff subsequently filed a motion to be  substituted into the action in lieu of the Insureds as the subrogee and real  party in interest to the Insureds’ claims against the only remaining defendant,  Balmain.  (Brower Decl. ¶6).  This Court granted the motion for  substitution on or about 1/30/24.  (See  1/30/24 Minute Order).    Based on the granting of the motion for substitution and  to enable Plaintiff to obtain a valid and enforceable judgment against Balmain  if Plaintiff prevails, on 4/29/24, Plaintiff filed and served the instant  motion seeking an order granting Plaintiff leave to amend the complaint in  conformance with this Court’s recent order granting Plaintiff’s motion to  substitute into the action as Plaintiff in place of Erickson Lavilla and Rose  Ann Lavilla.  The motion was originally  scheduled for hearing on 12/6/24 but was advanced by the Court to 6/18/24 on  5/59/24.  ( See 5/9/24 Minute  Order; 6/13/24 Nunc Pro Tunc Order).  Balmain  has not opposed or otherwise responded to the motion.     ANALYSIS    Plaintiff notes that granting the instant motion will not  affect Balmain’s motion for summary judgment which is also set for hearing on  6/18/24.   Due to the liberal policy of allowing leave to amend and  lack of prejudice to the other party in the action, the motion is granted.  CCP 473.   CONCLUSION   The motion is granted.   Plaintiff is ordered to separately file its First Amended  Complaint.        Dept.

Motion filed on 3/27/24.

 

MOVING PARTY: Defendant Forrest K. Balmain

RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff Chicago Title Insurance
Company

NOTICE: ok

 

RELIEF REQUESTED: An order
granting summary
judgment in favor of Defendant Forrest K. Balmain and against Plaintiff Chicago
Title Insurance Company.   

 



RULING: The motion is denied.    

 

SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY

 

This action arises out of Erickson Lavilla and Rose Ann
Lavilla’s (the Lavillas) purchase of real property commonly known as 29227
North Rio Lobo Way, Santa Clarita, California 91354 (the Property) from
Defendant Forrest K. Balmain (Balmain).  

 

Balmain acquired title to the Property via a grant deed,
dated August 2, 2005 (the 2005 Grant Deed).  (Plaintiff’s Separate Statement of Additional
Material Facts (PSS) 1).  In 2007, Balmain
obtained a loan from Aegis Wholesale Corporation (Aegis) for $587,200.00, which
was secured by the Property, as evidenced by a deed of trust, dated 2/12/07 (the
2007 DOT).  (PSS 2).  The 2007 DOT was subsequently assigned to
Aurora Loan Services, LLC (the Aurora Assignment). (PSS 3).  The 2007 DOT was thereafter assigned again to
MERS (the MERS Assignment). (PSS 4).  

 

On or about 1/16/09, Balmain conveyed the Property to
Shane Haffey (Haffey) via a grant deed (the Balmain-Haffey Deed).  (PSS 5).  On or about 5/28/09, Haffey conveyed the
Property back to Balmain via a grant deed (the Haffey-Balmain Deed).  (PSS 6).

 

On or about 5/26/22, Balmain conveyed the Property to the
Lavillas via a grant deed (the Insured Grant Deed).  (PSS 7). 
In connection with this transaction, Chicago Title Insurance Company (Chicago
Title) issued a policy of title insurance to the Lavillas (the Policy).  (PSS 8). 
During a title search, the 2007 DOT was not discovered, and Balmain did
not notify the Lavillas or any of their agents (beginning with the title
company, the escrow company or Chicago Title) of the undiscovered 2007 DOT
encumbering the Property.  (PSS 9).  As a result, the 2007 DOT was not paid off by
the sale proceeds from the Balmain to the Lavillas transaction and the funds
which should have paid the debt were instead delivered to Balmain.  Id. 

 

On or about 7/18/22, the 2007 DOT was assigned to
Deutsche Bank National Trust Company as Trustee for Harborview Mortgage Loan
Trust Mortgage Loan Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2007-7, a National
Banking Association (the Deutsche Bank Assignment).  (PSS 10). 


 

On or about 10/31/22, a Notice of Default and Election to
Sell Under Deed of Trust (Notice of Default) was recorded in the Los Angeles
County Recorder’s Office as Document No. 20221031257 because Balmain stopped
paying on the mortgage secured by the 2007 DOT.  (PSS 11). 
The Lavillas made a claim on the Policy, and Chicago Title accepted
coverage.  (PSS 12).  

 

On 2/8/23, this action was filed on behalf of the
Lavillas.  (PSS 13).  The complaint alleged claims against Deutsche
Bank and its trustee and loan servicer, Barrett Daffin and Mr. Cooper,
respectively for (1) Violation of Cal. Civil Code § 2943 and for Statutory
Damages/Injunctive Relief; (2) Accounting; and (3) Declaratory Relief.  The Complaint also alleged claims against Balmain
for (3) Declaratory Relief, (4) Fraud and Deceit; and (5) Breach of Implied
Covenant (Civil Code 1113(2).  Id.  Despite the filing of the complaint, Deutsche
Bank continued with its foreclosure proceedings, and A Notice of Trustee’s Sale
was recorded on 2/8/23, setting the auction sale of the Property for 3/8/23
(the Notice of Trustee’s Sale).  (PSS 14).

 

Therefore, Chicago Title paid off the sums due under the
2007 DOT on 3/3/23 in the total amount of $675,078.84 (the Loss Payment).  (PSS 15). 
Chicago Title’s Loss Payment stopped the foreclosure proceedings, and
Deutsche Bank reconveyed the 2007 DOT, thereby releasing the 2007 DOT from the
Property.  (PSS 16).  As a result, Deutsche Bank, its trustee
Barrett and Daffin and its loan servicer Mr. Cooper were dismissed from the complaint,
leaving the remaining claims for Declaratory Relief, Fraud and Deceit, and
Breach of the Implied Covenant against Balman for further litigation and
adjudication.  (PSS 17).  

 

As the title insurer for the Lavillas, and having paid
off the 2007 DOT for their benefit, Chicago Title acquired the rights to step
into the shoes of the Lavillas and pursue recovery of its Loss Payment from Balmain
pursuant to its subrogation rights flowing from the Policy.  (PSS 18). 
On 1/30/24, this Court granted Chicago Title’s motion to be substituted
in place and instead of the Lavillas as the plaintiff in this action.  (PSS 19).

 

On 3/27/24, Balmain filed and served the instant motion
seeking an order granting summary judgment in favor of Balmain.  On 6/4/24, Plaintiff Chicago Title (Plaintiff/Chicago
Title) filed and served, by overnight delivery, an opposition to the
motion.  On 6/12/24, Balmain filed a
document titled “Notice of Late Opposition to Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary
Judgment filed on 3/27/24” and another document titled “Notice of Additional
Judicial Notice to Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment filed on 3/27/24.”  No proofs of service for the documents filed
by Balmain on 6/12/24 have been filed.  

 

ANALYSIS

 

Timeliness of Opposition

 

Contrary to Balmain’s assertion in the “Notice of Late
Opposition” filed on 6/12/24, Plaintiff’s opposition to the motion filed and
served, by overnight delivery, on 6/4/24, 14 days before the 6/18/24 hearing on
the motion, was timely filed and served. 
CCP 437c(b)(6) provides that “[e]xcept for subdivision (c) of Section
1005 relating to the method of service of opposition and reply papers, Section
1005 and 1013, extending the time within which a right may be exercised or an
act may be done, do not apply to this section.” 
By serving the opposition by overnight delivery, Plaintiff complied with
the requirement that opposition papers be served via a means reasonably
calculated to ensure delivery not later than the close of the next business day
after the opposing papers were filed.  See
CCP 1005(c).  

 

Based on the foregoing, the opposition was timely served
and filed and considered by the Court in ruling on this motion.   

 

Judicial Notice

 

Balmain’s Request for Judicial Notice filed on 3/27/24 is
granted.  Balmain’s “Notice of Additional
Judicial Notice to Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment filed on 3/27/24”
filed on 6/12/24 is denied as Balmain has failed to set forth any basis on
which the Court may judicially notice the documents and/or facts contained
within this “request for judicial notice.”

 

Plaintiff’s Request for Judicial Notice is granted.

 

Evidentiary Objections

 

Plaintiff’s objections (numbers 1-3) to evidence
referenced in Balmain’s separate statement are overruled as they are not proper
evidentiary objections.  See CRC
3.1354.  Rather, Plaintiff appears to be
objecting to Balmain’s characterization of the evidence and/or the statements
in the separate statement.

 

Plaintiff’s objections (numbers 1-4) to portions of the Balmain
declaration filed in support of the motion are overruled.  

 

Balmain’s Separate Statement

 

The Court notes that Balmain’s Separate Statement filed
in support of the motion does not include facts material to the motion.  See CCP 437c(b)(2); CRC 3.1350(a)(2),
(d)(2).  Balmain’s separate statement
consists of five facts.  Facts 1 and 2
merely state that Balmain is not named in the 1st and 2nd
causes of action.  As such, these facts
do not relate to the causes of action which are the subject of the motion.  CRC 3.1350(a)(2).  Facts 3, 4 and 5 merely indicate that Balmain
is named as a defendant in these causes of action.  Without more, it is not clear how facts 3, 4
and 5 make a difference to the disposition of the motion.  CRC 3.1350(a)(2), (d)(2). 

 

Substantive Analysis

 

Balmain has failed to establish that no triable issue of
material fact exists as to whether he conveyed “clear and unencumbered title”
to the Property to the Lavillas.  The
facts that the Lavillas had to file this action in an attempt to prevent
foreclosure proceedings against the Property and that Plaintiff ultimately paid
off the 2007 DOT to stop the foreclosure creates a triable issue of material
fact.  (See PSS 2, 9-22, 13-16).

 

In the motion, Balmain does not contend or provide any
evidence that the 2007 DOT was paid off or reconveyed.  Contrary to the assertion in the motion, the
documents Balmain offers in support of the motion do not establish that Balmain
delivered free and clear title to the Lavillas.

 

As the purchaser of Balmain’s right, title and interest
in the Property pursuant to the 2019 Sheriff’s Certificate of Sale on Writ of
Sale (Balmain’s Ex.G, H), Balmain would have acquired title to the Property
subject to any existing encumbrances, including the 2007 DOT.  See Miller and Starr California Real
Estate §42.76, “Conducting the execution sale” (4th ed.); See
also National Bank of Bakersfield v. Williams (1916) 31 Cal.App.
705, 707.  As such, Mark A. Balmain’s
conveyance of title to the Property to Balmain (Balmain’s Ex.I) via a quitclaim
deed would not have resulted in Balmain’s possession of “clear and
unencumbered” title to the Property.  See
City of Manhattan Beach (1996) 13 C4th 232, 239.

 

Additionally, Balmain’s reliance on the reconveyance
which occurred after Plaintiff paid off the 2007 DOT, after this action was
filed, does not relieve him of liability for his failure to disclose the 2007
DOT in the sale transaction to the Lavillas. 
The fact that the Lavillas have been compensated does not change the
fact that Chicago Title, the new plaintiff in this action, has allegedly
suffered damages from Balmain’s alleged failure to disclose/concealment of the
2007 DOT.

 

Similarly, a triable issue of material fact exists with
regard to the claim for breach of implied covenant.  Under Civil Code 1113(2), the grantor in a
grant deed, for himself, his heirs and assigns, impliedly warrants to the
grantee, unless restrained by express terms contained in such grant deed of
conveyance, that such estate is at the time of the execution of the conveyance
free from incumbrances, done, made, or suffered by the grantor, or any person
claiming under him. (See 3 Cal. Real Est. §8:6 (4th Ed.), Miller and
Starr California Real Estate 4th (December 2019 Update).

 

The evidence indicates that Balmain conveyed the Property
to the Lavillas by way of a grant deed.  (PSS
7).  In doing so, Balmain warrantied to
the Lavillas that when he conveyed the Property to them, there were no
(unknown) encumbrances made by Balmain affecting the Property.  The evidence minimally creates a triable issue
of material fact as to whether such warranty was false because after Balmain sold
the Property to the Lavillas, Plaintiff had to pay off Deutsche Bank to release
the lien created by the 2007 DOT—an encumbrance that was created by Balmain himself.
 (PSS 2, 11-16).  At the time Balmain conveyed title to the
Property to the Lavillas, the 2007 DOT encumbrance had not been removed.  (See PSS 7, 16).

 

Since Balmain has failed to establish that he is entitled
to judgment in favor on the 4th cause of action for fraud/deceit and
the 5th causes of action for breach of implied covenant, he also
cannot establish his entitlement to judgment on the 3rd cause of
action for declaratory relief.  

 

CONCLUSION

 

The motion is denied.
