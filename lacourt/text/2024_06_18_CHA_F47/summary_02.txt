Here is the summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants Plaintiff Chicago Title Insurance Company's motion for leave to amend the complaint in conformance with the court's recent order granting Plaintiff's motion to substitute into the action as Plaintiff in place of Erickson Lavilla and Rose Ann Lavilla. The motion is granted, and Plaintiff is ordered to separately file the First Amended Complaint.

The judge also denies Defendant Forrest K. Balmain's motion for summary judgment. The court finds that a triable issue of material fact exists regarding whether Balmain conveyed "clear and unencumbered" title to the Property to the Lavillas. The court also finds that a triable issue of material fact exists regarding the claim for breach of implied covenant.
