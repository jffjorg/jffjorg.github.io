MOTION TO
COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES
(Request for
Production of Documents, Set 1)
 
Motion filed on 11/27/23.
 
MOVING PARTY: Plaintiff Raul Camacho Gutierrez
RESPONDING PARTY: Defendant General Motors, LLC
NOTICE: ok
 
RELIEF REQUESTED: An order
striking Defendant General Motors, LLC’s objections and to compel further
responses to Plaintiff’s Request for Production of Documents, Set 1, Nos. 7,
10, 16, 18-21, 36 and 38.

 
RULING: The motion is granted.  
 
SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of Plaintiff Raul Camacho’s
(Plaintiff) purchase of a 2022 Chevrolet Silverado (the Vehicle) on
10/18/22.  Plaintiff alleges that during
the warranty period, the Vehicle contained or developed defects, including the
Transmission Defect.  Plaintiff presented
the Vehicle to Defendant General Motors LLC’s (Defendant) authorized dealership
on at least 4 occasions regarding the Transmission Defect within the first 6
months of ownership.  Plaintiff contends
that none of the repair attempts permanently repaired the Transmission
Defect.  
 
Defendant has issued several Technical Service Bulletins
(TSBs) regarding the Transmission Defects and prescribing repairs.  (See Oliva Decl., Ex.2-5).  
 
On 12/21/22, Plaintiff requested that Defendant
repurchase or replace the Vehicle under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty
Act.  (Oliva Decl. ¶14).  Defendant refused Plaintiff’s request.  Id. 
Therefore, on 2/3/23, Plaintiff filed this action against Defendant
alleging various causes of action under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty
Act.  On 3/13/23, Defendant answered the
complaint.  
 
On 8/21/23, Plaintiff served Defendant with Request for
Production of Documents, Set 1.  (Oliva
Decl., Ex.6).  On 9/20/23, Defendant
served, by email, unverified responses to the requests without producing any
documents.  (Id., Ex.7).  On or about 10/10/23, Defendant served
verifications for the responses and produced documents.  Plaintiff found Defendant’s responses to and
production regarding Requests 7, 10, 16, 18-21, 36 and 38 to be deficient.
 
After meet and confer efforts failed to resolve this
discovery dispute and extensions of time to file and serve a motion to compel
further responses, on 11/27/23, Plaintiff filed and served the instant motion
seeking an order striking Defendant’s objections and compelling further
responses to Plaintiff’s Request for Production of Documents, Set 1, Nos. 7,
10, 16, 18-21, 36 and 38.  (See Oliva Decl. ¶¶20-29, Ex.8-15).  Defendant has opposed the motion and
Plaintiff has filed a reply to the opposition. 

 
ANALYSIS
 
Plaintiff’s objections (numbers 1-4) to the declaration
of Alexandria Pappas filed in support of the opposition are overruled.
 
A party may obtain discovery regarding any matter, not
privileged, that is relevant to the subject matter involved in the action or to
the determination of any motion made in the action, if the matter itself is
admissible or appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of
admissible evidence.  See CCP 2017.010.
 Doubts as to relevance are generally
resolved in favor of allowing discovery.  Colonial Life & Acc. Ins. Co.
(1982) 31 C3d 785, 790. 
 
CCP 2031.310(a) provides: 
 
“On receipt of a response to a
demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling, the demanding party may
move for an order compelling further response to the demand if the demanding
party deems that any of the following apply: 
(1) A statement of compliance with
the demand is incomplete. 
(2) A representation of inability
to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive. 
(3) An objection in the response is
without merit or too general.” 
 
The Court finds that Plaintiff adequately met and
conferred before filing the instant motion. 
(See Oliva Decl. ¶¶20-29, Ex.8-15)
 
To prevail on a claim brought under the Song-Beverly
Consumer Warranty Act (the Act), a plaintiff has the burden of proving, by a
preponderance of the evidence, several elements, including nonconformity of a
vehicle that substantially impaired its use, value or safety; presentation of
the vehicle to the manufacturer or authorized representative for repair; and
failure to repair the defect after a reasonable number of attempts.  Ibrahim (1989) 214 CA3d 878, 886-887; Oregel
(2001) 90 CA4th 1094, 1101; Lundy (2001) 87 CA4th 472, 478.
 
Additionally, under the Act, a buyer may recover damages
and other relief when there has been a breach of the implied warranty of
merchantability if the vehicle was sold with a known defect.  Civil Code 1794(a); Mexia (2009) 174
CA4th 1297, 1304-1305.  Further, a buyer
may be entitled to a civil penalty upon a showing that the manufacturer
willfully failed to abide by any of its obligations under the Act.  Civil Code 1794(c).
 
The subject requests seek documents relevant to
Plaintiff’s claims against Defendant under the Act including issues related to
Defendant’s good faith compliance with the Act.   As such, Plaintiff has provided sufficient
facts to establish the requisite good cause for production of the subject
documents.  See CCP
2031.310(b)(1).
The documents sought in Requests 7, 36 and 38 relate to
Defendant’s warranty and vehicle repurchase policies, procedures, and
practices.  (Oliva Decl. ¶17, Ex.6).  Such documents, or lack thereof, may provide
information as to whether Defendant has a policy which violates the Act.  See Oregel (1995) 90 CA4th
1094, 1104; Johnson (2005) 35 C4th 1191, 1200; Kwan (1994) 23
CA4th 174, 186.  
 
The documents sought in Requests 10, 16 and 18-21 relate to
Defendant’s internal investigations and analysis of the Transmission Defect affecting
Plaintiff’s vehicle and establishing Defendant previously knew of such defects yet
still refused to repurchase the vehicle. 
(Oliva Decl. ¶17, Ex.6).  The requested documents will assist in
establishing that Defendant was aware of the Transmission Defect; that the
Transmission Defect is ongoing; that Defendant lacks the means to fix the
defect; and that despite the foregoing Defendant failed and continues to fail
to repurchase and/or replace the Vehicle in violation of the Act.
 
Information regarding vehicles other than Plaintiff’s
vehicle is relevant to the subject matter of this action as it could assist
Plaintiff in proving Defendant’s willful violation of the Act. Documents
responsive to such requests may reasonably lead to the discovery of information
as to the nature and duration of the defects, Defendant’s knowledge of the
defects, and Defendant’s inability to repair the defects.  While cases relied on by Plaintiff (i.e., Donlen
(2013) 217 CA4th 138 and Doppes (2009) 174 CA4th 967) may not involve
the exact circumstance before this Court, they are sufficient to show that the
requested information could itself be admissible or lead to the discovery of
admissible evidence in this case.  Similarly,
evidence regarding Defendant’s practices in handling consumer complaints is
relevant to determining whether Defendant willfully violated the Act when it
refused to repurchase Plaintiff’s vehicle.  Johnson, supra at 1198-1199; Oregel,
supra at 1094; Kwan, supra at 186.
 
Defendant’s objections lack merit and/or have not been
properly supported.  As set forth above,
the documents sought are relevant and/or could lead to the discovery of
admissible evidence. Therefore, the requests are not irrelevant or overbroad.  The requests are also not vague and/or
ambiguous.  Defendant has also failed to
establish that responding to any of the subject requests would be overly
burdensome or oppressive.  To the extent
that documents are being withheld on the basis of attorney-client privilege
and/or work product doctrine, Defendant is required to
provide a privilege log.  See CCP 2031.240(c).  Defendant has failed to establish that the
documents sought contain confidential and/or propriety information and that
dissemination of the information would result in injury.  See Nativi (2014) 223 CA4th 261,
318.  To the extent that any of the
requests actually seek confidential, proprietary and/or trade secret
information, the Court finds that the protective order entered between the
parties will adequately protect Defendant’s interests.  (See Oliva Decl. ¶25, Ex.13;
Protective Order signed/granted 11/7/23). 

 
While Defendant may have produced additional documents in
response to certain of the requests at issue (i.e., Requests 7, 10, 19, 36,
38), Defendant has not served further written responses.  (Oliva Decl. ¶26).  As such, it is not clear whether any
documents are being withheld on the bases of the unmeritorious objections
included in the written responses.  
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion is granted. 
Defendant is ordered to produce further written responses and to produce
documents in accordance therewith within the next 30 days.
