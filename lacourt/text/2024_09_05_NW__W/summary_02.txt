And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the demurrer filed by Defendant Forms and Surfaces, Inc. to the third amended complaint filed by Plaintiff 14241 Ventura LLC. The court has found that the demurrer is without merit and has overruled it.

The court agrees with the plaintiff's allegations that it complied with the terms of the contract, that the defendant breached the contract, and that the plaintiff suffered damages as a result of the breach. The court further finds that the covenant of good faith and fair dealing is implied by law in every contract and that the plaintiff has sufficiently alleged breach of that covenant.

The court also finds that the plaintiff has sufficiently alleged breach of implied warranty and negligence, and that the demurrer to these causes of action is also without merit.

The court's ruling is tentative and is subject to change after further briefing and argument.
