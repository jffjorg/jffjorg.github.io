And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Keith Smith vs. Liat Talasazan, granting the Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment. The Judge finds that the Plaintiff's cause of action for negligence has no merit, as the Plaintiff has failed to provide any evidence showing who was the driver or owner of the vehicle that struck him. The Judge also finds that the Defendant has met its burden of showing that there are no triable issues of material fact.

The Judge has also denied the Plaintiff's Motion to Compel Compliance with a third-party subpoena for Jonathan Marsand Balter's deposition and production of documents. The Judge finds that the motion is moot given its intention to grant summary judgment to the Defendant.

The Judge has granted the Defendant's request for judicial notice of the Plaintiff's Complaint filed in Los Angeles Superior Court Case No. 20STCV43151, filed on November 12, 2020.
