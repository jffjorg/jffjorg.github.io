And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Wendy Arias vs 12306 Gale, LLC, case number 22STCV8869. The defendant, 12306 Gale, LLC, had filed motions to compel further responses from the plaintiff, Wendy Arias, and to request admissions and documents. However, the plaintiff had already provided the requested responses, making the motions moot. The judge agreed that the motions were unnecessary and therefore granted sanctions against the plaintiff and her counsel in the amount of $1,000. The sanctions are intended to compensate defense counsel for having drafted the unnecessary motions. The plaintiff and her counsel are required to pay the sanctions to the defendant within 20 days. The judge has ordered that the parties submit to this tentative ruling by email or appear remotely or in person for oral argument, unless all parties submit, in which case the judge may adopt the tentative ruling as the final order.
