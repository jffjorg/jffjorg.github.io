significant_statements:
  - "Defendant argues that summary judgment should be granted as it is undisputed that LAUSD did not employ Mr. Rico while Plaintiff attended Middleton."

  - "Plaintiff's testimony indicates that he could testify in detail as to what the Perpetrator's office looked like inside."
  - "The Court DENIES Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment and in the alternative Summary Adjudication."
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion for summary judgment and in the alternative summary adjudication. The defendant argued that there is no evidence that the alleged perpetrator, Mr. Rico, was employed by the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) during the time the plaintiff alleges he was molested. The plaintiff, on the other hand, argued that the absence of records of an employee with the last name "Rico" does not necessarily mean that LAUSD did not employ someone with the first, middle, or nickname "Rico." The judge found that the defendant has satisfied its initial burden of showing that it did not employ Mr. Rico during the time the plaintiff alleges the molestation occurred. However, the judge also found that the plaintiff's deposition testimony raises triable issues of fact regarding the employee-employer relationship between LAUSD and the perpetrator, which cannot be resolved on summary judgment. Therefore, the motion is denied.
