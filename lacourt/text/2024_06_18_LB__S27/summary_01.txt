And here is the English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge is considering the defendants' motions for summary judgment in this medical malpractice and wrongful death case. The defendants, Long Beach Memorial Medical Center, Steven J. Appleby, M.D., and Maurice A. Bell, M.D., have submitted expert declarations that their care and treatment of Valentina Timascu complied with the standard of care and did not cause or contribute to her death. The plaintiff, Claudia Lankford, has submitted an opposing declaration from Dr. Jeffrey Brown, M.D., who concludes that the defendants' care was below the standard of care and caused or contributed to Timascu's death. However, the Judge has sustained objections to Dr. Brown's declaration because he is not a licensed medical doctor and has not established that he is familiar with the standard of care applicable to nurses or non-physician staff. As a result, the defendants' motions for summary judgment are likely to be granted.
