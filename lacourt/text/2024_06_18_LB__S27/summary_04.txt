```
And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The court is considering a demurrer to the complaint by the defendant, alleging that the plaintiff's cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED) is insufficiently pleaded. The defendant argues that the plaintiff has not pled extreme and outrageous conduct to support the claim, and also that the plaintiff has not pled that they suffered severe emotional distress as a result of the defendant's actions. The court agrees with the defendant and sustains the demurrer, but grants leave to amend if the plaintiff can plead facts establishing that they suffered severe emotional distress as defined by the court. The motion to strike is moot because the cause of action is not adequately pled. The court orders the plaintiff to file an amended complaint within 20 days and the defendant to file a responsive pleading within the statutory time thereafter.
