 Case Number:  23LBCV00720    Hearing Date:   June 18, 2024    Dept:  S27 Plaintiff filed this motion to
quash on 1/18/24, setting it for hearing on 6/18/24.  On 4/26/24, well months before the filing
deadline for opposition papers, Defendant filed an opposition indicating the
motion was moot because Defendant had agreed to withdraw and/or limit the
subject subpoena per meet and confer conversations with Plaintiff.  Any reply to the opposition was due on or
before 6/13/24.  Plaintiff has not filed
timely reply papers, but has also not taken the motion to quash off
calendar.  
 
The Court takes the motion to quash
off calendar as moot.  The Court asks
Plaintiff’s attorney to promptly take matters off calendar using the online
reservation system in the future in this and other cases whenever the matters
become moot.  
 
The Court notes that the parties
have discovery motions scheduled for hearing on 7/09/24, 7/25/24, 8/22/24, and
9/03/24.  The Court asks Counsel to meet
and confer in good faith in an attempt to resolve the issues presented by way
of the upcoming discovery motions.  The
Court advises the parties that appointment of a discovery referee is a
possibility if all future motions remain on calendar.  
 
Plaintiff is ordered to give
notice.  
 
Parties who intend to submit

the party submitting on the tentative.  If
