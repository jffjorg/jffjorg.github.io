Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to compel the plaintiff's independent medical examination (IME). The plaintiff failed to appear at two scheduled IMEs, and the defendant is entitled to a response to the demand for IME. The plaintiff is ordered to serve a response within 10 days. The plaintiff is also ordered to appear for the IME on July 30, 2024, at 3:30 pm. The judge notes that the scope of the examination may not be expanded in connection with the compelled IME.

Regarding the defendant's request for sanctions, the judge denies the request because it was not properly noticed and supported. The judge also notes that the defendant's declaration does not provide any details about the costs incurred as a result of the motion. The judge orders the defendant to give notice.

The parties are instructed to submit on the tentative or appear remotely at the hearing on June 18, 2024.
