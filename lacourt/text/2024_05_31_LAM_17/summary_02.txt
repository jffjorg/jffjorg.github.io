English-text summary:

The tentative ruling is in favor of the defendants, sustaining their demurrer without leave to amend. The defendants argue that the claims are barred by issue preclusion/collateral estoppel, citing a prior Wyoming court decision that found the loans and stock agreement are valid and enforceable. The court agrees, finding that the elements of issue preclusion are met, and that the parties have conceded the merits of the defendants' claim. The court also notes that the plaintiffs did not oppose the demurrer, which is taken as a concession on the merits.
