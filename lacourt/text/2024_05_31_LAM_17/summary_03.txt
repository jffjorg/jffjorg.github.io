Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed the default judgment packet filed by Plaintiff Omninet Kipling, L.P. and has identified several deficiencies. The packet lacks a summary of the case and the declaration submitted by Vileta Vitkova was not signed. The Court notes that CCP section 580, subdivision (a) limits the relief granted to the plaintiff to that demanded in the complaint. In this case, the Plaintiff sought damages of $25,000, plus attorney fees and costs. The estimated breaches total $26,534.73, but the Court cannot award a sum greater than that alleged in the Complaint. The Court will consider these factors when awarding damages in the default judgment.
