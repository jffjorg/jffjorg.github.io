  Case Number:  21STCV19681    Hearing Date:   January 17, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
considered the documents submitted in support of a default judgment, the Court
rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On
May 25, 2021, Plaintiff Kenneth Rodriguez
(“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendants Luis Angel Rivera Hernandez
and Does 1-100 for motor vehicle negligence. 
On
September 28, 2021, Plaintiff amended the complaint to include Defendant Rivera
Alberto Hernandez as Doe 1. 
On
June 23, 2022 and August 17, 2022, Plaintiff filed a proof of service showing
substituted service on Alberto Rivera Hernandez of the summons, complaint,
statement of damages, and other documents on October 16, 2021. 
On
August 19, 2022, the clerk entered the default of “Alberto Rivera
Hernandez.” 
On
November 22, 2022, the Court dismissed Does 1-100 without prejudice at
Plaintiff’s request. 
On
February 6, 2023, the Court dismissed Defendant Luis Angel Rivera Hernandez
without prejudice at Plaintiff’s request. 
On
April 21, 2023, the Court granted Plaintiff’s motion to vacate the dismissal of
Defendant Rivera Alberto Hernandez (Doe 1). 
On
October 24, 2023, Plaintiff filed a declaration by Loretta Miller, the person
who prepared the proof of service for the summons and complaint served on Defendant
Rivera Alberto Hernandez.  Miller stated
that “the defendant’s name “was erroneously typed on the proof of service as
Alberto Rivera Hernandez even though he was
properly served under the correct name, as Rivera Alberto Hernandez, Doe 1.” 
On
November 2, 2023, Plaintiff filed a request for entry of default judgment against
Defendant Rivera Alberto Hernandez. 
PARTY’S REQUEST 
Plaintiff
requests that the Court enter default judgment against Defendant Rivera Alberto
Hernandez and award Plaintiff $17,341.33, consisting of $3,865.00 in special
damages, $10,000.00 in general damages, and $3,476.33 in costs. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
“[With exceptions that do not apply here,] [a] party
seeking a default judgment on declarations must use mandatory Request for Entry
of Default (Application to Enter Default) (form CIV-100) . . . The following
must be included in the documents filed with the clerk: 
“(1)  Except in
unlawful detainer cases, a brief summary of the case identifying the parties and
the nature of plaintiff's claim; 
“(2) 
Declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment
requested; 
“(3)  Interest
computations as necessary; 
“(4)  A
memorandum of costs and disbursements; 
“(5)  A
declaration of nonmilitary status for each defendant against whom judgment is
sought; 
“(6)  A proposed
form of judgment; 
“(7)  A
dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application
for separate judgment against specified parties under Code of Civil Procedure
section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; 
“(8)  Exhibits
as necessary; and 
“(9)  A request
for attorney fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.” 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1800(a).) 
          “Where a cause of action is stated in the complaint,
plaintiff merely needs to introduce evidence establishing a prima facie case
for damages.”  (L. Edmon & C. Karnow,
Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶ 5:213.1, p. 5-56 (Cal. Practice Guide), citing Johnson
v. Stanhiser (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 357, 361 [trial court erred in applying
preponderance of the evidence standard].) 
          The relief granted to a plaintiff upon entry of a
defendant's default cannot exceed the amount demanded in the complaint or, for
personal injury cases where damages may not be stated in the complaint, the
amount listed in the statement of damages. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 580, subd. (a),
585, subd. (b).) “The notice requirement of section 580 was designed to insure
fundamental fairness.” (Becker v. S.P.V. Construction Co. (1980) 27
Cal.3d 489, 494 (Becker).) The statute insures that “defendants in cases
which involve a default judgment have adequate notice of the judgments that may
be taken against them. [Citation.] ‘If a judgment other than that which is
demanded is taken against him, [the defendant] has been deprived of his day in
court—a right to a hearing on the matter adjudicated.’ ’’ (Id. at p.
493.) A trial court exceeds its jurisdiction if it awards damages in excess of
the amount specified in the complaint or statement of damages. (Id. at
p. 494; see Cal. Practice Guide, supra, ¶ 5:258,
p. 5-70.) 
DISCUSSION 
Before
the Court can enter a default judgment against a defendant, the defendant must
be in default.  (See Cal. Practice Guide,
supra, ¶ 5:115, p. 5-38 [“Entry of default is the first step toward a
default judgment”].)  Here, the clerk
entered the default of “Alberto Rivera Hernandez.”  However, Plaintiff is asking the Court to
enter default judgment against Rivera Alberto Hernandez.  The Court cannot grant the request because
Rivera Alberto Hernandez’s default has not been
entered. 
Plaintiff
requests $2,484.35 in costs for “process server’s fees.”  But $2,484.35 is the amount Plaintiff’s
counsel paid Specialized Investigation to “research and locate Defendant Rivera
Alberto Hernandez” and to hire a process server to serve him.  (See Mandell Dec. & Account Quick Report attachment.)  Under Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5,
subdivision (b)(2), investigation expenses in preparing the case for trial are
not recoverable costs.  If Plaintiff seeks
recovery of the costs paid to Specialized Investigation for its work in
locating Defendant, Plaintiff should provide legal support for the request. 
In
addition, Plaintiff should specify the costs included in the request for $92.92
in “other” costs. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES Plaintiff Kenneth Rodriguez’s application for default judgment
filed on November 2, 2023 without prejudice. 
Plaintiff
is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
