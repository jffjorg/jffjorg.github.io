The Judge, Maurice Leiter, has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion of the defendant, American Fitness and Nutrition Academy, Inc., to set aside the default entered on November 28, 2023. The defendant claims that it did not know about the lawsuit until the default was entered because the notification of service was sent to an email address that is no longer regularly used and was characterized as spam. The court finds that this is sufficient grounds to set aside the default, and since the plaintiff does not oppose the motion, the defendant's motion is granted.
