If the parties wish to submit on the tentative, please
email the courtroom at SMCdept54@lacourt.org with
notice to opposing counsel (or self-represented party) before 8:00 am on the
day of the hearing.
 
The Court considers the moving papers
and reply. No opposition has been received.
 
CCP § 473(b) provides, in pertinent
part, “[t]he court may, upon any terms as may be just, relieve a party or his
or her legal representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other
proceeding taken against him or her through his or her mistake, inadvertence,
surprise, or excusable neglect.” 
 
Defendant moves to set aside default
entered against it on November 28, 2023. Defendant asserts notification of
service of the summons and complaint was sent to an email address that is no
longer regularly used and was characterized as spam. Defendant represents that
it did not know about this lawsuit until default was entered.  Thereafter, Defendant worked diligently to set
aside default. 
 
This is sufficient grounds to set aside
default. Plaintiff does not oppose this motion. Defendant’s motion is GRANTED.
