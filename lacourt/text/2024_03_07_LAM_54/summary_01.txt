And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the motions to compel further responses to discovery and quash subpoenas for business records. The Plaintiff, Shana Smith, moves to compel further responses to requests for production of documents and form interrogatories from the Defendant, Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority and Felipe Gutierrez Olea. The Plaintiff alleges sexual harassment by a supervisor while working for the Defendant and seeks documents related to sexual harassment, training, and personnel files.

The Court grants the Plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to requests for production of documents, finding that the Defendant has failed to show how the official information privilege and deliberative process privilege apply to this employment action. The Court also grants the Plaintiff's motion to compel further response to form interrogatories, finding that the request is not premature.

The Plaintiff also moves to quash subpoenas for medical records served on UCLA Health System and Maria Mendoza, LMFT. The Court grants the motion in part, limiting the subpoenas to the last five years.

The Court awards sanctions to the Plaintiff in the amount of $2,010.00 against LACMTA and $1,950.00 against Olea.
