And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has decided to take the motion to compel further responses to the plaintiff's request for production of documents off the calendar. This decision is based on the fact that, despite the court's trial orders requiring an informal discovery conference before hearing discovery motions in Lemon Law cases, no such conference was held in this case. As a result, the motion will not be heard.
