ANALYSIS:
 
I.         
Legal Standard
 
“Except as otherwise expressly
provided by statute, a prevailing party is entitled as a matter of right to
recover costs in any action or proceeding.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd.
(b).)
 
Prevailing
parties seeking to claim costs must comply with California Rules of Court, rule
3.1700(a), and parties seeking to contest costs must comply with California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1700(b). 
 
The Court separately considers each category of contested costs,
including: (1) whether they are specifically allowable or specifically
prohibited; (2) whether they were incurred, whether or not paid; (3) whether
they were reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation rather than
merely convenient or beneficial to its preparation; and (4) whether they are
reasonable in amount. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1033.5, subds. (a), (b), and
(c)(1)–(3).
 
“Items not mentioned in this section and items assessed upon
application may be allowed or denied in the court’s discretion.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (c)(4); see also Foothill-De Anza Cmty. Coll.
Dist. v. Emerich (2007) 158 Cal.App.4th 11, 30.)
 
II.      
Discussion
 
A.      The
Motion to Tax East West’s Costs
 
1.      The
Parties’ Arguments
 
East West initially claims $7,076.03 in
costs, which is comprised of the following amounts:
 
(1)       $455.00 in filing
and motion fees;
 
(2)       $3,687.00 in deposition
costs;
 
(3)       $162.68 in service
costs;
 
(4)       $138.05 in costs
for court-ordered transcripts;
 
(5)       attorney’s fees (by
separate motion);
 
(6)       $258.30 for
electronic filing or service fees; and
 
(7)       $2,375.00 in
“other” costs. 
 
(East West’s Memorandum, p. 1.)
 
        Morillo moves the Court to
tax: (1) the deposition costs; (2) the court-ordered transcript costs; and (3)
the mediation fees which comprise of all the “other” costs. (Motion to Tax East
West’s Costs, p. 2:8–11.)
 
        After Morillo filed its
motion, but before East West filed its Opposition, East West amended its
MC-010. The amendments included: (1) omitting the $2,375.00 in mediation costs
from the “other” category; (2) moving the $138.05 in court-ordered transcripts
to the “other” category; and (3) adding $373.29 in court reporter fees. (East
West’s Amended Memorandum, p. 1.)
 
        In its Opposition, East
West argues: (1) that the Motion to Tax East West’s Costs is now moot because
East West filed East West’s Amended Memorandum; (2) that the requested costs
are necessary and the Court has discretion to approve them; and (3) that East
West is the prevailing party and therefore is entitled to recover all
reasonable costs incurred. (Opposition, pp. 3:2–3, 3:20–22, 4:3–5.)
 
        In its Reply, Morillo
argues: (1) that the Motion to Tax East West’s Costs is not moot; and (2) that
East West is not entitled to the costs for depositions and transcripts. (Reply,
p. 2:9–10, 2:18.)
 
2.      East
West is Entitled to Costs as the Prevailing Party
 
        The Court agrees with the
argument that East West is entitled to its costs as a prevailing party. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1032, subd. (b).)
 
3.      Mootness
of the Motion
 
        The Court does not agree
with the argument that the Motion to Tax East West’s Costs is now moot because
East West filed an amended memorandum. 
 
Morillo correctly notes that there is very
little substantive change because of the amendment.   Given the minimal changes at issue, it would
be a waste of time for the Court to deny as moot the motion because the Court
would simply allow leave for a motion to tax to be filed based on the amended
memorandum. 
 
Moreover, the due process issue here is
minimal because (1) both sides still have at least one chance to respond to the
amended memorandum and (2) the non-moving party only objects to the substance
of the memorandum (but not the act of amending).
 
4.      Mediation
Costs
 
        The mediation cost issue
is now moot because East West omitted that cost item from East West’s Amended
Memorandum. 
 
The Court notes that the Court did not order
mediation and would have declined to exercise its discretion to allow these
costs. 
 
5.      Deposition
Costs
 
        The deposition costs of
$3,687.00 are the costs incurred for depositions of Pierre Morillo, Eva
Neumann, Jennifer Cheung, and Ramesh Sharma. (East West’s Memorandum, Item 4;
East West’s Amended Memorandum, Item 4.) 
 
The Court finds that these costs were reasonable
and will allow them. 
 
6.      Transcript
Costs
 
“Transcripts of court proceedings ordered by the court” are
specifically allowable costs, while “[t]ranscripts of court proceedings not
ordered by the court” are specifically prohibited, except where expressly
authorized by law. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subds. (a)(9), (b)(5). 
 
The Court did not order any transcripts, and East West has not pointed
to any law that specifically authorizes the recovery of these costs in absence
of the Court ordering the transcripts. Thus, the transcript costs are not
recoverable. 
 
The Court taxes these costs. 
 
7. 
    Court
Reporter Costs
 
        “Court reporter fees as established by
statute” are allowable as costs. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (a)(11).)
 
        The
Court did not order court reporting, and East Wets has not pointed to any law
that specifically authorizes the recovery of these costs in absence of the
Court ordering court reporting. The Court declines to exercise its discretion
to allow these costs. 
 
        The Court taxes these
costs. 
 
8.      Conclusion
 
The Court GRANTS in part the Motion to Tax
East West’s Costs. The Court TAXES East West’s costs by $511.34. The Court
AWARDS costs in favor of East West and against Morillo in the total amount of
$4,562.98.
 
B.      The
Motion to Tax Wells Fargo’s Costs
 
Wells Fargo initially claims $6,292.89 in
costs, which is comprised of the following items:
 
(1)       $560.00 in filing
and motion fees;
 
(2)       $3,284.49 in
deposition costs;
 
(3)       $73.40 in
electronic filing or service fees; and
 
(4)       $2,375.00 in
“other” fees. 
 
(Wells Fargo’s Memorandum, p. 1.)
 
        Morillo moves the Court to
tax: (1) the deposition costs; and (2) the mediation/arbitration fees. (Motion
to Tax Wells Fargo’s Costs, p. 2:8–10.)
 
        After Morillo filed its
motion, Wells Fargo amended its MC-010 to omit the “other” fees. (Wells Fargo’s
Amended Memorandum, p. 1.) No opposition or other response was filed. 
 
        The mediation cost issue
is now moot because East West omitted that cost item from East West’s Amended
Memorandum. The Court notes that the Court did not order mediation and would
have declined to exercise its discretion to allow these costs. 
 
        The deposition costs of
$3,284.49 are the costs incurred for depositions of Eva Neumann (two volumes)
and Pierre Morillo. (Wells Fargo’s Memorandum, Item 4; Wells Fargo’s Amended
Memorandum, Item 4.)
 
The Court finds that these costs were
reasonable and will allow them. 
 
The Court DENIES the Motion to Tax Wells
Fargo’s Costs. The Court AWARDS costs in favor of Wells Fargo and against
Morillo in the total amount of $3,917.89.
