Significant Statements:

(Los Defensores, supra, 223 Cal.App.4th at p. 390)
  - "Lack of diligence may be deemed willful in the sense that the party understood his obligation, had the ability to comply, and failed to comply." (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771, 787)
```

And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge grants the unopposed motion for terminating sanctions by Arcadia Opco LLC (dba Embassy Suites Hotel) against SEUNGSHIK HAN, et al. (Plaintiffs). The Court finds that Plaintiffs have engaged in discovery abuse, failing to comply with discovery orders and failing to provide responses to discovery requests, despite the Court's order to do so. The Court concludes that terminating sanctions are warranted, as Plaintiffs have willfully misused the discovery process, and their failure to comply is detrimental to Defendant's ability to prepare for trial. As a result, the Court grants the motion and dismisses Plaintiffs' complaint against Defendant with prejudice.
