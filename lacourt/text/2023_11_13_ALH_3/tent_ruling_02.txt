I.           
INTRODUCTION
On January 31, 2022, plaintiff Baldwin
Arcadia Center, LP (“Plaintiff”) filed this unlawful detainer action against
defendant Tong Tak House Seafood Restaurant (“Defendant”). On May 26, 2022,
Plaintiff filed a notice of settlement with a request that the Court dismiss
the action while retaining jurisdiction to enforce the settlement under Code of
Civil Procedure section 664.6. 
On June 6, 2023, Plaintiff filed an ex
parte application to enforce the terms of the stipulated judgment. On June 12,
2023, the Court entered judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant
for possession of the premises located at 1271 S Baldwin Ave. Arcadia CA 91007,
forfeiture of the lease or rental agreement, and for money damages in the sum
of $810,435.63.
On October 17, 2023, Plaintiff filed
this motion to amend the judgment to include Lily Feng (“Feng”) pursuant to
Code of Civil Procedure § 187.  
II.         
LEGAL
STANDARD
Code
of Civil Procedure section 187 grants every court the power and authority to
carry its jurisdiction into effect. (NEC Electronics Inc. v. Hurt (1989)
208 Cal.App.3d 772, 778.) This includes the authority to amend a judgment to
add an alter ego of an original judgment debtor, and thereby make the
additional judgment debtor liable on the judgment. (Toho–Towa Co., Ltd. v.
Morgan Creek Productions, Inc. (2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 1096, 1106.) Amending
a judgment by noticed motion to add an alter ego of an original judgment debtor
is an equitable procedure based on the theory that the court is not amending
the judgment to add a new defendant, but is merely inserting the correct name
of the real defendant. (McClellan v. Northridge Park Townhome Owners Assn.
(2001) 89 Cal.App.4th 746, 752; (Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v. Weinberg
(2014) 227 Cal.App.4th 1, 9.) The court is not required to hold an evidentiary
hearing on a motion to amend a judgment, but may rule on the motion based
solely on declarations and other written evidence. (Id.) The motion may
be made at any time so that the judgment will properly designate the real
defendants. (Highland Springs Conference & Training Ctr. v. City of
Banning (2016) 244 Cal. App. 4th 267, 287.)
 
To
prevail on the motion and ad an alter ego of an original judgment debtor, the
judgment creditor must show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that: “(1) the
parties to be added as judgment debtors had control of the underlying
litigation and were virtually represented in that proceeding; (2) there is such
a unity of interest and ownership that the separate personalities of the entity
and the owners no longer exist; and (3) an inequitable result will follow if
the acts are treated as those of the entity alone.” (Relentless Air Racing,
LLC v. Airborne Turbine Ltd. Partnership (2013) 222 Cal.App.4th 811,
815–816.) In determining whether there is a sufficient unity of interest and
ownership, the court considers many factors, including “the commingling of
funds and assets of the two entities, identical equitable ownership in the two
entities, use of the same offices and employees, disregard of corporate
formalities, identical directors and officers, and use of one as a mere shell
or conduit for the affairs of the other.” (Troyk v. Farmers Group, Inc.
(2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 1305, 1342.) Inadequate capitalization of the original
judgment debtor is another factor. (Zoran Corp. v. Chen (2010) 185
Cal.App.4th 799, 811–812 [reciting “long list” of inexhaustive factors].) No
single factor governs; courts must consider all of the circumstances of the
case in determining whether it would be equitable to impose alter ego
liability. (Troyk, supra, at p. 1342.)
Alter
ego “is an extreme remedy, sparingly used.” (Sonora Diamond Corp. v.
Superior Court (2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 523, 539.) “The standards for the
application of alter ego principles are high, and the imposition of [alter ego]
liability ... is to be exercised reluctantly and cautiously.” (Mesler v.
Bragg Management Co. (1985) 39 Cal.3d 290, 306.)  Still, “[t]he greatest liberality is to be
encouraged” in allowing judgments to be amended to add the “real defendant,” or
alter ego of the original judgment debtor, “in order to see that justice is
done.” (Carr v. Barnabey's Hotel Corp. (1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 14, 20; Greenspan
v. LADT LLC (2010) 191 Cal.App.4th 486, 508; Wells Fargo, supra,
227 Cal.App.4th at p. 7.)
III.       
DISCUSSION
On
July 31, 2023, a little over a month after the Court entered the stipulated
judgment, Feng filed a certification of election to wind up and dissolve
Defendant as a corporate entity. Defendant did not give Plaintiff notice that
it was winding up and dissolving, nor has it identified for Plaintiff any
shareholders other than Feng. Plaintiff argues that Feng is dissolving
Defendant in order to remove its assets and prevent Defendant from having to
pay the judgment. Therefore, Plaintiff seeks to add Feng as a judgment debtor
on the grounds that she is an alter ego of Defendant. 
According
to documents filed with the California Secretary of State, Feng is the sole
director, chief executive officer, chief financial officer, secretary and agent
for service of process for Defendant. (Crawford Decl., Exs. 3-4.) The most
recent statement of information, filed on September 6, 2022, shows that Feng
shares the same principal address as Defendant located at 1271 S. Baldwin
Avenue in Arcadia, California. (Id., Ex. 4.) Feng appears to have controlled
the underlying action and had the opportunity to litigate it. Feng participated
in the litigation by verifying the answer on behalf of Defendant and by signing
the stipulation that resulted in the judgment. The Court notes that while the name
printed on the stipulation is “Li Feng” instead of “Lily Feng”, the signature
on the stipulation is identical to the signature verifying the answer, in which
Feng referred to herself as “Lily Feng.” 
In
light of the evidence submitted by Plaintiff, it would be inequitable not to
add Feng as a judgment debtor when there appears to be a “unity of interest”
which ensured that Feng’s interests were represented in this litigation. 
IV.        
CONCLUSION
Plaintiff’s unopposed motion is GRANTED.
The Court will sign the proposed amended judgment filed on October 17, 2023. 
Dated this 13th day of November,
2023
