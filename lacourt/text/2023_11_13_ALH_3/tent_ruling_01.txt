          On December 3,
2021, Plaintiff Aziza Georgian (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against US GC
Investment, LP (“Defendant”), New Prosperity Investment LLC (“New Prosperity”),
and Youhong Fu. On August 10, 2023, Plaintiff filed six motions for orders
compelling Defendant and New Prosperity to serve verified discovery responses to
interrogatories and inspection demands, and deeming admitted the truth of the
matters specified in requests for admission. Plaintiff also requested
sanctions. 
On September 27, 2023, Defendant and
New Prosperity filed an omnibus declaration from their counsel, Charles C.
McKenna, in which counsel stated that a change in staff resulted in the
discovery requests being overlooked. (McKenna Decl., ¶¶ 3-5.) At the hearing on
October 4, 2023, the Court granted Mr. McKenna’s requests for a one-month
continuance so that his office could provide additional verified responses. The
Court continued the hearing on these motions to November 13, 2023. 
As of November 9, 2023, the Court has
not received any additional filings and there is no indication that verified
responses have been served. 
Where a party fails to serve timely
responses to discovery requests, the court may make an order compelling
responses.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§
2030.290, 2031.300; Healthcare
Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th
390, 403.) It is well-settled that “unsworn responses are tantamount to no
responses at all.”  (Appleton v. Superior Court (1888) 206 Cal.App.3d 632, 636; Zorro Inv. Co. v. Great Pacific Securities
Corp. (1977) 69 Cal.App.3d 907, 914.) Therefore, although Defendant and New
Prosperity may have served responses, the motions are not mooted and will not
be taken off calendar because verifications for those responses have not been
served yet. 
Accordingly, based on the Court record,
Plaintiff’s motions to compel Defendant and New Prosperity’s discovery
responses are GRANTED. Defendant and New Prosperity are each ordered to serve
verified responses to Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatories (Set One), and Request
for Production of Documents (Set One), without objections, within 20 days of
the date of this order. 
With respect to Plaintiff’s Requests
for Admission (Set One), the motions are GRANTED. The truth of the matters
within each set of Requests for Admission (Set One) propounded on Defendant and
New Prosperity is deemed admitted. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).))
Where the court grants a motion to
compel responses, sanctions shall be imposed against the party who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel, unless the party acted with
substantial justification or the sanction would otherwise be unjust.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (c),
2031.300, subd. (c).)Also, “[i]t is mandatory that the court impose a monetary
sanction . . . on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a
timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)
Here, Plaintiff’s counsel declares that
he bills at a rate of $500 for this matter and requests $1,064.77 for each
motion. The Court finds this amount excessive considering that each motion only
required limited legal analysis and is largely boilerplate. Therefore, sanctions
are granted and imposed against Defendant and counsel of record, jointly and
severally, in the reduced amount of $2,548.62, consisting of 7 hours at the
reasonable rate of $300 (allotting one hour for each motion and an additional
hour to attend the hearing) and $448.62 for the cost to file each motion.
