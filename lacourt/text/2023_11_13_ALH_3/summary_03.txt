And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in response to Defendant Dansko, LLC's motion to compel Plaintiff Jody Scott's responses to discovery requests and to deem admitted the requests for admission. The Plaintiff failed to serve timely responses to the discovery requests, and the Defendant's motions were unopposed.

The judge granted the motions to compel responses, ordering the Plaintiff to serve verified responses without objections to the Defendant's Form Interrogatories (Set Two), Special Interrogatories (Set Two), and Requests for Production of Documents (Set Two) within 20 days of the date of the order.

The judge also granted the motion to deem admitted the requests for admission, as the Plaintiff failed to serve a proposed response that was in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220 of the Code of Civil Procedure.

Finally, the judge imposed monetary sanctions of $1,446.60 against the Plaintiff, which includes 4 hours of defense counsel's hourly rate of $300 and $246.60 in filing fees, to be paid within 20 days of the date of the order.
