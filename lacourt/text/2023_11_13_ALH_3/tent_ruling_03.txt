On November 9,
 2022, plaintiff Jody Scott (“Plaintiff”) filed this action
against defendant Dansko, LLC (“Defendant”) alleging she sustained a foot
injury from a shoe. On May 5, 2023, Defendant
served Form Interrogatories (Set Two), Special Interrogatories (Set Two),
Request for Production of Documents (Set Two), and Request for Admissions (Set
One) on Plaintiff.  No
responses were received.  On June 14,
 2023, defense counsel sent Plaintiff a letter and an email requesting
responses. However, Plaintiff did not provide responses and Defendant filed
these unopposed motions on July 21, 2023. 
          Compel
Responses
Where a party fails to serve timely
responses to discovery requests, the court may make an order compelling
responses.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§
2030.290, 2031.300; Healthcare
Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th
390, 403.) A party that fails to serve timely responses waives any objections
to the request, including ones based on privilege or the protection of attorney
work product. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (a), 2031.300, subd. (a).) 
Plaintiff
did not oppose Defendant’s motions to compel and it is undisputed responses
were not served.  Defendant’s
motions to compel are GRANTED and Plaintiff
is ordered to serve verified responses without objections to Defendant’s
Form Interrogatories (Set Two), Special Interrogatories (Set Two) and Requests
for Production of Documents (Set Two) within 20 days of the date of this Order.

Deem Admitted
Where a party fails to timely respond
to a request for admission, the propounding party may move for an order that
the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the
requests be deemed admitted. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).) The
party who failed to respond waives any objections to the demand, unless the
court grants them relief from the waiver, upon a showing that the party (1) has
subsequently served a substantially compliant response, and (2) that the
party’s failure to respond was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or
excusable neglect. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subds. (a)(1)-(2).) The court
shall grant a motion to deem admitted requests for admissions, “unless it finds
that the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has
served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests
for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)
Plaintiff did not oppose this motion
and it does not appear that a proposed response has been served before this
hearing. Accordingly, the motion to deem admitted is GRANTED. 
Monetary Sanctions
The Code of Civil Procedure provides
that the court shall impose a monetary sanction against the party who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel, unless the party acted with
substantial justification or the sanction would otherwise be unjust.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (c),
2031.300, subd. (c).)  Where a party
fails to provide a timely response to requests for admission, “[i]t is
mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to
serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this
motion.”  (Code of Civ. Proc., §
2033.280, subd. (c).)
Defendant’s
request for monetary sanctions is GRANTED and imposed against Plaintiff
in the reduced amount of $1,446.60 for 4 hours
at defense
counsel’s hourly rate of $300 and $246.60
in filing fees, to be paid within 20 days of the date of this Order.
 
Moving party to give notice.
 
Dated
this 13th
day of November 2023
