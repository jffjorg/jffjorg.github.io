And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to add Lily Feng as a judgment debtor in an unlawful detainer action. The plaintiff, Baldwin Arcadia Center, LP, filed the motion after the defendant, Tong Tak House Seafood Restaurant, allegedly attempted to dissolve itself to avoid paying the judgment. The judge finds that Feng is the sole director, CEO, CFO, secretary, and agent for service of process for the defendant, and that she has the same principal address as the defendant. The judge also notes that Feng participated in the litigation by verifying the answer and signing the stipulation that resulted in the judgment. Based on this evidence, the judge concludes that it would be inequitable not to add Feng as a judgment debtor, and therefore grants the plaintiff's motion. The judge will sign the proposed amended judgment and add Feng as a judgment debtor.
