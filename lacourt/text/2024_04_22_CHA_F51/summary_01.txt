Here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to vacate the default judgment and reinstate the case. The defendant argued that she experienced extreme psychological distress and financial hardship due to a divorce and failed to defend herself in the instant action due to the withdrawal of her attorney. The defendant also claimed that she has been experiencing extreme psychological distress and financial hardship as a result of a divorce now pending in Ventura Superior Court. However, the plaintiff argued that the defendant cannot claim inadvertence or excusable neglect because she does not contend that she failed to receive notice of the proceedings in the instant action for which she failed to appear. The plaintiff also pointed out that the defendant has failed to file a reply to the opposition and that the defendant's blame for the debt was caused by another responsible party, Eric Donaldson, who signed as a guarantor on many of the obligations executed by the defendant without her knowledge or approval. The judge found that the defendant has failed to establish that the judgment against her should be vacated based on her inadvertence or excusable neglect.
