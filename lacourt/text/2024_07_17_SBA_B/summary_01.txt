And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling on a motion to compel production of a person most knowledgeable (PMK) for deposition and to produce documents related to the investigation and denial of plaintiff's request for benefits. The plaintiff, June Vantrimpont, is seeking to compel the defendant, Blue Cross of California dba Anthem Blue Cross, to produce a PMK for deposition and to produce documents related to the investigation and denial of her request for benefits. The defendant asserts that the motion is unnecessary and that the parties have reached an agreement on the scope of discovery.

The Court rules that the motion to compel production of PMK is moot as to topics 4, 5, and 7, but grants the motion as to topic 6 and grants the motion as to request for production, No. 1, to the extent the parties reached an agreement to a narrower scope. The Court also orders the defendant to produce a PMK within 20 days.

Regarding the motion to compel further responses to request for production of documents, set two, the Court grants the motion as to Nos. 15-16, 19 as narrowed by plaintiff, and orders the defendant to produce further documents within 20 days. The Court denies the motion as to Nos. 17-21, 22-25, 26, 31, 32, 33, 35.

The plaintiff had requested $1,000 in sanctions against the defendant and defense counsel, but the Court finds that the defendant acted with substantial justification and denies the request.
