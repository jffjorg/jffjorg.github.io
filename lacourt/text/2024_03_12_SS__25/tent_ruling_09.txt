BACKGROUND
On April 27, 2023, Karla Elizabeth Maravilla Alberto (“Plaintiff”)
filed an action against Jose Antonio Montoya (“Defendant”) for the partition of
the real property located at 17316 Sweetaire Avenue, Lancaster California 93535.
  
On October 30, 2023, default was entered against the Defendant. 
On January 12, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant Motion for
Reclassification.
No opposition has been filed. 
MOVING PARTY
POSITION
 
            Plaintiff prays
for an order from the Court reclassifying Case No. 23STLC02813 from a limited civil jurisdiction to an unlimited
civil jurisdiction case under CCP § 403.020. Plaintiff argues that the instant
case should now be classified as unlimited because Plaintiff’s complaint for
partition establishes that she can recover more than $35,000.00 based on the
proceeds of the sale of the property. Plaintiff further argues that she has
good cause for not seeking the reclassification sooner because when she first
initiated the instant action the value of the property relative to the loan
amount owed led Plaintiff to believe the matter qualified as a limited
jurisdiction. 
 
OPPOSITION

ANALYSIS
 
I.          Legal
Standard
Code of Civil
Procedure § 403.040 allows a plaintiff to file a motion for reclassification of
an action within the time allowed for that party to amend the initial
pleading.  (Code Civ. Proc., §¿403.040(a).)  “A party may amend its
pleading once without leave of court at any time before an answer, demurrer, or
motion to strike is filed, or after a demurrer or motion to strike is filed if
the amended pleading is filed and served no later than the date for filing an
opposition to the demurrer to motion to strike.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
472(a).)  If the motion is made after the time for the plaintiff to amend
the pleading, the motion may only be granted if (1) the case is incorrectly
classified; and (2)¿the plaintiff shows good cause for not seeking
reclassification earlier.  (Code¿Civ.¿Proc.¿§¿403.040(b).) 
 
In Walker v. Superior Court (1991) 53 Cal.3d 257,
262, the California Supreme Court held that a matter may be reclassified from
unlimited to limited only if it appears to a legal certainty that the
plaintiff’s damages will necessarily be less than $25,000.  (Walker v.
Superior Court (1991) 53 Cal.3d 257.)  If there is a possibility that
the damages will exceed $25,000.00, the case cannot be transferred to limited
civil.  (Id.)  This high standard is appropriate considering
“the circumscribed procedures and recovery available in the limited civil
courts.”  (Ytuarte v. Superior Court (2005) 129¿Cal.App.4th 266,
278.) 
 
In Ytuarte, the Court of Appeal examined the
principles it set forth in Walker and held that “the court should reject
the plaintiff’s effort to reclassify the action as unlimited only when
the lack of jurisdiction as an ‘unlimited’ case is certain and clear.”  (Ytuarte,
supra, 129 Cal.App.4th at 279 (emphasis added).)  Nevertheless, the
plaintiff must present evidence to demonstrate a possibility that the damages
will exceed $25,000.00 and the trial court must review the record to determine
“whether a judgment in excess of $25,000.00 is obtainable.”  (Id.) 
Effective January 01, 2024, the jurisdictional limit in a limited
civil jurisdiction case now stands at $35,000.00 per Code of Civil Procedure §
85(a). (Code Civ. Proc. § 85(a).)
II.        Discussion 
 
            The instant case is brought
for the partition of the real property located at 17316 Sweetaire Avenue,
Lancaster California 93535. Plaintiff and Defendant both own an undivided equal
share or interest as joint tenants.  
 
Plaintiff argues that the instant case
should now be classified as unlimited because Plaintiff’s complaint for
partition establishes that she can recover more than $35,000.00 based on the
proceeds of the sale of the property. Plaintiff further argues that she has
good cause for not seeking the reclassification sooner because when she first
initiated the instant action the value of the property relative to the loan
amount owed led Plaintiff to believe the matter qualified as limited
jurisdiction. 
 
Plaintiff provides the Court with her own sworn
declaration in which she states that she filed the action as a limited civil
matter, not realizing that the matter needed to be an unlimited matter. (Kara
Elizabeth Maravilla Alberto Decl. ¶ 3.) Plaintiff avers that based on what was
owed and the value of the house in April 2023, she did not believe that the
action qualified as an unlimited matter. (Id. ¶ 6.) When Plaintiff moved
for default judgment, the Court rejected Plaintiff’s request based on the
proposed judgment exceeding the jurisdictional limit. (Id. ¶ 5.) 
 
            The Court finds
that Plaintiff has met her burden of showing good cause for not seeking
reclassification earlier. Here, Plaintiff has demonstrated that
there is a possibility that a judgment in her favor will exceed $25,000.00 and
the new jurisdictional amount of $35,000.00. Given that the value of the
property is $360,000.00, and that Plaintiff is seeking an equal division of the
proceeds from the sale of the property it is certain
that an award in Plaintiff’s favor would exceed the jurisdictional
limit of this Court. 
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion for Reclassification of the instant
action to an unlimited jurisdiction is GRANTED.
             
III.       Conclusion 
            
 
Plaintiff Karla Elizabeth Maravilla
Alberto’s Motion for Reclassification is GRANTED. 
 
The Court orders this action
reclassified from the Limited Jurisdiction to the Unlimited Jurisdiction Court,
upon payment of the appropriate reclassification fees.
 Plaintiff is ordered to pay the
reclassification fee within twenty (20) days service of this Court’s order.
 
 
Moving party is ordered to give
notice.
