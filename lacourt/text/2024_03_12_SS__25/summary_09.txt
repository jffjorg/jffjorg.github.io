Significant Statements:
  - "The court should reject the plaintiff's effort to reclassify the action as unlimited only when the lack of jurisdiction as an 'unlimited' case is certain and clear." (Ytuarte v. Superior Court (2005) 129 Cal.App.4th 266, 279)
  - "The plaintiff must present evidence to demonstrate a possibility that the damages will exceed $25,000.00 and the trial court must review the record to determine 'whether a judgment in excess of $25,000.00 is obtainable.'" (Ytuarte v. Superior Court (2005) 129 Cal.App.4th 266, 279)
  - "Given that the value of the property is $360,000.00, and that Plaintiff is seeking an equal division of the proceeds from the sale of the property it is certain that an award in Plaintiff's favor would exceed the jurisdictional limit of this Court."
