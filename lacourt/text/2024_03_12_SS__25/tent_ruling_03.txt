BACKGROUND
 
On July 06, 2022, Plaintiff Old
Republic Surety Company (“Plaintiff” or “Old Republic”) filed a Complaint for
Interpleader against Defendants California Pool Men, Inc. (“CPM”), Ryan Junsay
(“Ryan”), Wendy Delgado (“Wendy”), Verbhert Malilim (“Verbhert”), and Princess
Malilim (“Princess”), (collectively “Defendants”).
 
On September 15, 2022, Defendants
Verbhert and Princess filed a Cross-Complaint against Cross-Defendants Old
Republic, CPM, Andrew Nathan O’Neill (“Andrew”), Adam Neil Aguirre (“Adam”),
Anthony Aguirre (“Anthony”), Htikhu ONeill (“Htikhu”), Robert Vega (“Robert”),
(collectively “Cross-Defendants”). On the same day, Defendants Wendy and Ryan
filed a Cross-Complaint against Cross-Defendants.
 
Old Republic filed a General Denial
to Wendy and Ryan’s Cross-Complaint on September 20, 2022, and General Denial
to Verbhert and Princess’s Cross-Complaint on September 26, 2022. 
 
On January 27, 2023, Plaintiff Old
Republic filed a Motion to Deposit and Discharge Stakeholder. Plaintiff’s
Motion was denied on April 27, 2023, given that Plaintiff did not deposit the
funds with the Court. 
 
On January 27, 2023, default was
entered against CPM as to the Complaint. On April 14, 2023, default was entered
against CPM as to both Cross-Complaints.
 
On April 27, 2023, Defendants Ryan,
Wendy, Verbhert, and Princess filed a General Denial to the Plaintiff’s
Complaint.
 
On May 09, 2023, Plaintiff Old
Republic filed a Motion to Deposit and Discharge Stakeholder and for Attorney’s
Fees. 
 
On May 23, 2023, Plaintiff filed a
Notice of Deposit of Bond Funds. 
 
On July 26, 2023, the Court granted
Plaintiff’s Motion to Deposit and Discharge Stakeholder, contingent on the
Court’s confirmation that plaintiff has deposited funds with the clerk of the
Court. The Court additionally reimbursed Plaintiff $2,000.00 in attorney’s fees
and cost from the interpleader funds. 
 
On January 03, 2024, the Court on
its own motion placed the scheduled non-jury trial off calendar due to
Defendants’ non-appearance. The Court additionally dismissed both Cross-Complaints
pursuant to CCP 581(b)(5). 
 
On February 14, 2024, Cross-Complainants
Princess and Verbhert filed the instant Motion to Set Aside Dismissal of
Cross-Complaint Filed by Verbhert Malilm and Princess Malilim. Cross-Complainants
Wendy and Ryan similarly filed the instant Motion to Set Aside Dismissal of
Cross-Complaint Filed by Ryan Junsay and Wendy Delgado. 
 
No opposition has been filed. 
 
On March 05, 2024,
Cross-Complainants filed notices of non-opposition to the instant motions. 
 
MOVING PARTY
POSITION
 
Cross-Complainants Princess and Verbhert pray for the
Court to vacate the dismissal of their Cross-Complaint entered on January 03, 2024.
Princess and Verbhert argue that they are entitled to mandatory relief under
CCP Section 473(b) because the dismissal was caused by their Counsel’s mistake,
inadvertence, or excusable neglect. Wendy and Ryan similarly argue that they
are entitled to mandatory relief under CCP Section 473(b) because of their
Counsel’s error which resulted in Counsel not appearing at the scheduled
hearing on January 03, 2024. Cross-Complainants collectively assert that no
prejudice will result if the dismissals are set aside, and the Cross-Complaints
are reinstated. 
OPPOSITION

ANALYSIS
 
I.          Legal
Standard
Under Code of Civil Procedure, section 473, subdivision
(b), “the court may, upon any terms as may be just, relieve a party or his or
her legal representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding
taken against him or her through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or
excusable neglect.” (Code Civ. Proc., §473(b)). Relief under this section is
mandatory when based on an attorney affidavit of fault; otherwise, it is
discretionary. (Id.) An application for relief must be made no more than
six months after entry of the order from which relief is sought and must be
accompanied by an affidavit of fault attesting to the moving party’s mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or neglect. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b); English
v. IKON Business Solutions (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 130, 143.) When relief
from default and a default judgment is based on an attorney affidavit of fault,
the six-month period starts to run from the date of the entry of the default
judgment. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, sub. (b); Sugasawara v. Newland
(1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 294, 295.) 
 
II.        Discussion 
 
Cross-Complainants move to set aside the dismissals,
entered on January 03, 2024, of their respective Cross-complaints under Section
473(b). Cross-Complainants argue that their non-appearance was due to their attorney’s
mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect and thus pray for mandatory relief
under Section 473(b). Since both motions plead similar facts, the Court’s order
will address both motions together.  
 
A. Motion
to Set Aside Dismissal of Cross-Complaint Filed by Verbhert and Princess 
 
The Court finds the Motion to be timely.
CCP section 473(b) provides that an application for relief must be made no more
than six months after entry of the order from which it was sought. (Code Civ. Proc., §473(b).)
Here, the Court dismissed the Cross-Complaint filed by Verbhert and Princess on
January 03, 2024. (01/03/2024 Minute Order.) Verbhert and Princess filed their motion
on February 14, 2024, well within the six-month deadline. Thus, the motion is
timely filed. 
 
Verbhert and Princess provide the Court
with their counsel’s declaration, in which he states that due to an internal
calendaring error, Cross-Complainants’ counsel did not appear at the January 3
trial. (Michael Ayaz Decl. ¶ 17.)  Thus, based
on Counsel’s declaration the Court finds that the error was caused by
Plaintiff’s counsel’s mistake,
inadvertence, or excusable neglect and therefore entitles Plaintiff to
mandatory relief under Section 473(b). 
 
            Accordingly,
the Court GRANTS Cross-Complainants Princess and Verbhert’s Motion to Set Aside
the Dismissal. 
 
B. Motion
to Set Aside Dismissal of Cross-Complaint Filed by Wendy and Ryan
 
Similar to the points raised above,
the Court finds the motion to be timely. Here, the Court dismissed the
Cross-Complaint filed by Wendy and Ryan on January 03, 2024. (01/03/2024 Minute
Order.) Wendy and Ryan filed the instant motion to set aside the dismissal on
February 14, 2024, within six weeks of the Court’s issuance of the dismissal. Therefore,
the motion is considered timely. 
 
Here, Wendy and Ryan provide the
Court with the declaration of their counsel who avers that because of an
internal calendaring error, Cross-Complainants’ counsel did not appear at the
trial. (Michael Ayaz Decl. ¶ 17.) Thus, since the motion complies with Section
473(b), Wendy and Ryan are entitled to mandatory relief and the Court GRANTS
their Motion to Set Aside the Dismissal. 
 
 
 
 
III.       Conclusion 
            
            Cross-Complainants Princess Malilim and Verbhert
Malilim’s Motion to Set Aside Dismissal of Cross-Complaint is GRANTED. 
 
            Cross-Complainants Ryan Junsay and
Wendy Delgado’s Motion to Set Aside Dismissal of Cross-Complaint is also GRANTED.
 
            The Court further orders this action
reclassified from the Limited Civil Jurisdiction Court to the Unlimited Civil Jurisdiction
Court based on the amount of damages requested in each Cross-Complaint. 
 
            Moving Party is ordered to give notice.
