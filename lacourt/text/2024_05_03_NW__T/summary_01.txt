And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motion for a protective order, including an "attorneys' eyes only" provision, to protect trade secrets. The court finds that the plaintiff has shown good cause for the protective order, citing the need to prevent the disclosure of trade secrets to direct competitors. The court also grants the plaintiff's unopposed motion for leave to file a first amended complaint, allowing the plaintiff to plead common law claims in the alternative and based on new facts independent of the misappropriation facts.
