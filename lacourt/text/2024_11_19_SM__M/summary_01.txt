Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has tentatively ruled in favor of SMC Specialty Finance LLC's motion for sanctions against Beijing Zhumeng Qiming Culture & Art Co. Ltd. for discovery abuse. The Court found that Zhumeng failed to preserve evidence, destroyed responsive documents, and provided false discovery responses, resulting in a substantial prejudice to SMC's rights to discovery and its ability to prosecute and defend this action.

The Court has imposed monetary sanctions against Zhumeng in the amount of $12,990.00 and an evidentiary sanction in the form of a jury instruction. The Court has also tentatively rejected more extreme sanctions, including terminating sanctions, but may reconsider this decision at the hearing.

The Court's reasoning is based on the fact that Zhumeng's intentional destruction of evidence and provision of false discovery responses were willful and in bad faith. The Court has also considered the prejudice caused to SMC as a result of Zhumeng's actions and has determined that the proposed sanctions are necessary to mitigate this prejudice.
