Summary:
The judge's tentative ruling addresses a motion to quash seven deposition subpoenas issued by Plaintiff Bobs, LLC to third parties. The subpoenas seek business records, including personal financial information, which Defendant Sam Ostayan objects to on financial privacy grounds. The judge finds that Defendant raises a valid privacy concern and that the subpoenas are not overly broad. However, the judge denies the motion to quash and modifies the subpoenas to limit production of records to 2023 to the present.
