And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the City of Santa Monica's motion for leave to file a cross-complaint against the 1749 12th Street Homeowners Association (HOA). The City alleges that the HOA contributed to the sewage backup that damaged the condominium unit of James Chen and Michael Spragg by failing to install or require installation of backwater valves at the property. The judge found that the City's motion should be granted because it was filed in good faith and there is no known prejudice that will result from allowing the City to bring the HOA into the case. The City must file the proposed cross-complaint within 2 days.
