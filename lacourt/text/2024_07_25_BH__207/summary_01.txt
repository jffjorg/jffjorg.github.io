And here is a summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to enforce a settlement agreement between the defendants (Uber Technologies, Rasier, LLC, and Rasier-CA, LLC) and the plaintiffs (Jacqueline Benjamin and Ayanna Smith). The agreement was allegedly reached after a phone call on June 7, 2024, in which the plaintiffs' counsel orally agreed to settle the case for $120,000. However, the judge has found that the evidence is insufficient to demonstrate that a valid and binding settlement agreement exists between the parties. The judge notes that the text messages exchanged between the parties do not constitute an agreement on the plaintiffs' behalf or with their consent. As a result, the judge denies the defendants' motion to enforce the settlement agreement.
