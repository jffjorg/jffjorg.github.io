BACKGROUND
 
            Petitioner Wasser, Cooperman &
Mandles P.C. (“Petitioner”) moves to compel Respondent Shazeen Shah (“Respondent”)
to arbitration regarding a dispute over legal fees incurred in connection with
Petitioner’s provision of legal services to Respondent in the matter, “Marriage
of Shah/Aschinger.”  (Verified Petition
at ¶ 1; Ex. A.)  The petition is
unopposed.  
 
MOTION
TO COMPEL ARBITRATION – LEGAL STANDARDS
 
            “[T]he advantages of arbitration
include a presumptively less costly, more expeditious manner of resolving
disputes.  It follows a party to a valid
arbitration agreement has a contractual right to have its dispute with another
party to the contract resolved quickly and inexpensively.”  (Henry v. Alcove Investment, Inc.
(1991) 233 Cal.App.3d 94, 99–100 [cleaned up].) 
Thus, “on petition of a party to an arbitration agreement alleging the
existence of a written agreement to arbitrate a controversy and that a party to
the agreement refuses to arbitrate that controversy, the court shall order the
petitioner and the respondent to arbitrate the controversy if it determines
that an agreement to arbitrate the controversy exists.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.2; see also 
EFund
Capital Partners v. Pless (2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 1311, 1320 [the language
in section 1281.2 compelling arbitration is mandatory].) The right to compel
arbitration exists unless the court finds that the right has been waived by a
party’s conduct, other grounds exist for revocation of the agreement, or where
a pending court action arising out of the same transaction creates the possibility
of conflicting rulings on a common issue of law or fact.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.2, subds.
(a)-(c).)    
 
            “On a petition to compel
arbitration, the trial court must first determine whether an agreement to
arbitrate the controversy exists. 
Because the existence of the agreement is a statutory prerequisite to
granting the petition, the petitioner bears the burden of proving its existence
by a preponderance of the evidence.  The
party seeking arbitration can meet its initial burden by attaching to the
petition a copy of the arbitration agreement purporting to bear the
respondent's signature.”  (Bannister
v. Marinidence Opco, LLC (2021) 64 Cal.App.5th 541, 543-544 [cleaned
up].)  The party seeking to compel arbitration must also “plead and prove a
prior demand for arbitration and a refusal to arbitrate under the
agreement.”  (Mansouri v. Superior
Court (2010) 181 Cal.App.4th 633, 640-641.) 

 
            And while the moving party on a
motion to compel arbitration “bears the burden of proving the existence of a
valid arbitration agreement by a preponderance of the evidence, [a] party
opposing the petition bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the
evidence any fact necessary to its defense.  The trial court sits as the
trier of fact, weighing all the affidavits, declarations, and other documentary
evidence, and any oral testimony the court may receive at its discretion, to
reach a final determination.”  (Ruiz
v. Moss Bros. Auto Group, Inc. (2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 836, 842 [cleaned
up]; see also Pinnacle Museum Tower Assn. v. Pinnacle Market Development (US), LLC (2012) 55 Cal.4th 223, 236 [“The party
seeking arbitration bears the burden of proving the existence of an arbitration
agreement, and the party opposing arbitration bears the burden of proving any
defense, such as unconscionability”].)  
 
ANALYSIS
 
            As a threshold matter, “[a] petition
to compel arbitration is in essence a suit in equity to compel specific
performance of a contract.”  (Frog
Creek Partners, LLC v. Vance Brown, Inc. (2012) 206 Cal.App.4th 515, 532.)  As such, a court’s personal jurisdiction over
the respondent requires compliance with the same service rules that apply for
service of a summons and complaint in any other lawsuit.  (Frey & Hogan Corp. v. Superior Court
in and for City and County of San Francisco (1936) 5 Cal.2d. 401, 403-404.)
 
            Moreover, due process requires that
a respondent be given written notice of the moving and supporting papers at
least sixteen court days before the hearing. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1005, subd. (b).) 

 
            Here, there is no proof of service
indicating that the original Petition to Compel arbitration was ever served on
Respondent in a manner that would give the Court personal jurisdiction to hear
the matter.  Further, there is no proof
of service indicating that the notice of the hearing was ever served on
Respondent.  The Court continued the
hearing to allow Petitioner to file a proof of service, but no proof of service
has yet been filed.  The Court
acknowledges that a Notice of Continuance was filed on June 14, 2024, but no
proof of service attached to that notice.  

 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
Because the Court finds
no proof of service demonstrating that Respondent was notified about this
lawsuit or was given proper notice of the hearing, the Court denies without
prejudice the Petition to Compel Arbitration. 

 
Further, the Court
continues that Case Management Conference to January 23, 2025 at 8:30 A.M. in
Department 207.  
 
Petitioner shall provide
notice of the Court’s order and file the notice with a proof of service forthwith.
