And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving East West Bank, Jianhua Fu, Hua Meng, and others. The case is about an interpleader action brought by East West Bank, which deposited $1,275,047.68 into the court. The defendant, Jianhua Fu, and his co-defendants, Hua Meng, filed a cross-complaint against Che-Min Kuo, claiming that Kuo was involved in unauthorized wire transfers. The judge has ruled that Fu and Meng's demurrer to Kuo's cross-complaint is overruled because they failed to provide the required notice. The judge has also sustained East West Bank's demurrer to Fu and Meng's cross-complaint, ruling that Fu and Meng have not sufficiently pleaded their cause of action for negligence against East West Bank.

The judge's ruling is based on the legal standards that a demurrer must appear on the face of the pleading or from judicially noticeable matters, and that a demurrer assumes the truth of all factual, material allegations properly pled in the challenged pleading. The judge also relied on case law that a bank has no legal duty to supervise account activity or otherwise track frequent and/or large dollar transactions, and that a bank has no duty to inquire into the purpose for which funds are being used.
