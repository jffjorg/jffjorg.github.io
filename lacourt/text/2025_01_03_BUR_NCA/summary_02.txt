And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for a protective order filed by Defendant Christine Oak. The motion was brought in response to Plaintiff Erik Vega's special interrogatories, which exceeded the 35 permitted by California Code of Civil Procedure (C.C.P.) § 2030.030. The Court found that Plaintiff failed to make a "reasonable and good faith attempt" to resolve the issues outside of court and did not provide a sufficient declaration to justify the number of special interrogatories.

The Court granted the motion for a protective order, finding that Defendant need not answer Plaintiff's special interrogatories Set One. The Court also declined to impose sanctions on Plaintiff, finding that Plaintiff did not appear to act in a manner that was designed to engage in a misuse of the discovery process.
