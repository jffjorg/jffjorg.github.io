ALLEGATIONS: 
 
General Facts 
 
This is an interpleader action brought by East West Bank
(East West). On June 27, 2024, East West filed its interpleader Complaint
naming Che-Min Kuo (Kuo), Jianhua Fu (Fu), Hua Meng (Meng), and Annie Hou (Hou)
as Defendants. On September 17, 2024, East West’s proposed order to deposit
interpleader funds with the Court was granted. East West subsequently deposited
$1,275,047.68 in interpleader funds with the Court. 
 
On September 16, 2024, Hou filed her Cross-Complaint
against Kuo and Fu. Hou alleges in February 2024, Fu approached her, “…about
needing a large amount of RMB currency in China because Fu had made an
agreement with an individual who wanted to convert their US dollars situated in
the United States into local RMB currency in China.” (Hou CC ¶ 17.) Hou alleges
the individual Fu made the agreement with was Kuo. (Hou CC ¶ 18.) 
 
Hou alleges that she and Fu subsequently entered into a
verbal agreement whereby Hou would transfer a specific sum of RMB to Fu’s
accounts in China and, in exchange, U.S. funds would be deposited in Hou’s
account. (Hou CC ¶ 19.) On February 16, 2024, Hou opened an account with East
West to facilitate this agreement. (Hou CC ¶ 14.) 
 
Also on September 16, 2024, Fu and Meng filed their
Cross-Complaint against Kuo, Vincent Song (Song), and East West. 
 
Fu alleges he met Song in September 2023, during which time
Fu disclosed to Song learned that Fu held RMB in Chinese bank accounts and
wanted to convert this currency to US dollars. (Fu CC ¶ 9.) Fu alleges
Song claimed that he could assist in the currency exchange. (Fu CC ¶ 10.) Fu
initially requested that Song transfer $1.24 million to an account with East
West owned by Fu’s business partner and $60,000.00 to Meng and Fu's shared
account with East West. (Fu CC ¶ 11.) 
 
Song allegedly disagreed with the instructions and instead
instructed Fu to first wire the RMB to various Chinese bank accounts. (Fu CC
¶ 12.) Between February 2, 2024, and February 8, 2024, Fu instructed Hou
to wire a total of 10,500,000.00 RMB to these accounts. (Fu CC ¶ 15, Hou CC
¶¶ 21-25.). Kuo then wired the following amounts to Fu and Meng's joint
account with East West: 
 
·        
February 6, 2024: $650,000.00. 
·        
February 7, 2024: $450,000.00. 
·        
February 8, 2024: $200,000.00. 
 
(Fu CC ¶ 16.) 
 
Fu and Meng allege that Kuo then contacted East West and
claimed the transfers were unauthorized. (CC ¶ 19.)  Fu and Meng allege they do not know Kuo or
why the wire transfers came from his account. (CC ¶ 17.) Hou also alleges
that Kuo contacted East West to dispute the wire transfers. (Hou CC ¶ 26.)
As a result, East West froze the accounts of Hou, Fu, and Meng and proceeded
with this interpleader action. (Hou CC ¶¶ 27-28.) 
 
On
October 16, 2024, Kuo filed his Cross-Complaint as against Fu, Meng, and YQW
Invest, LLC. Kuo alleges that he was incarcerated in Taipei at the time of the
alleged transactions and that the wire transfers to East West were the result
of identity theft. (Kuo CC ¶¶ 18-28.)    
 
Motions
Before the Court 
 
Before
the Court are:
 
(1)  
East
West’s demurrer to the cause of action for Negligence in Fu and Meng’s
Cross-Complaint 
 
(2)  
Fu and
Meng’s demurrer to causes of action for Injunctive Relief, Intentional
Misrepresentation, and Negligent Misrepresentation in Kuo’s Cross-Complaint. 
 
Fu and
Meng oppose the demurrer of East West and East West replies. Kuo has not
opposed the demurrer of Fu and Weng, though this is likely because they were
never served with notice. 
  
ANALYSIS: 
 
I.                   
LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
The grounds for a demurrer must appear on the
face of the pleading or from judicially noticeable matters. (C.C.P. §
430.30(a); Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal. 3d 311, 318.) A demurrer for
sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v.
Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) The only issue involved in a
demurrer hearing is whether the complaint states a cause of action. (Id.)
 
A demurrer assumes the truth of all factual,
material allegations properly pled in the challenged pleading. (Blank v.
Kirwan, supra, 39 Cal. 3d at p. 318.) No matter how unlikely or improbable,
the plaintiff’s allegations must be accepted as true for the purpose of ruling
on the demurrer. (Del E. Webb Corp. v. Structural Materials Co. (1981)
123 Cal.  App. 3d 593, 604.) But this does not include contentions;
deductions; conclusions of fact or law alleged in the complaint; facts
impossible in law; or allegations contrary to facts of which a court may take
judicial notice.  (Blank, supra, 39 Cal. 3d at 318.)
 
Pursuant to C.C.P. §§ 430.10(e) and (f), the
party against whom a complaint has been filed may demur to the pleading on the
grounds that the pleading does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause
of action, or that the pleading is uncertain, ambiguous and/or unintelligible.
It is an abuse of discretion to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend if
there is a reasonable probability that the defect can be cured by amendment. (Schifando
v. City of Los Angeles (2003) 31 Cal. 4th 1074, 1082.)
 
II.                
MERITS 
 
Fu and Meng’s Demurrer
to Kuo’s Cross-Complaint 
 
C.C.P. § 1005 requires
that a moving party serve notice of their motion and the motion on the opposing
party no later than 16 court days prior to the scheduled hearing. Fu and Meng’s
demurrer to Kuo’s Cross-Complaint contains no proof of service upon Kuo or his
attorney of record. Despite attempting to meet and confer with Kuo’s counsel (Frank
S. Hwu) it does not appear that Fu and Meng’s counsel ever served him with the
demurrer. (Li Decl. Exhs. A-B.) The proof of service, attached to the Demurrer
itself, shows the notice was only served on counsel for East West and Hou. 
 
Accordingly, Fu and Meng’s demurrer is OVERRULED for
failure to provide the statutorily required notice. 
 
East West’s Demurrer to Fu and Meng’s
Cross-Complaint 
 
As a preliminary
matter, the Court finds East West has complied with the meet and confer
requirements set forth in C.C.P. §§ 430.41(a). (Jung Decl. ¶ 4, Exh. A.)
 
East West demurs to
the fourth cause of action for Negligence, the only one stated against it, on
grounds that the Cross-Complaint fails to allege sufficient facts.
Specifically, East West argues that Fu and Weng have pled insufficient facts as
to the existence of a duty which East West owed them. 
 
In stating their claim for Negligence against
East West, Fu and Meng allege the following: 
 
·        
The relationship between a bank and its
depositor is founded on contract, and it is an implied contractual duty of a
bank to act with reasonable care in its transactions with its depositors. This
includes adherence to Know Your Customer practices. (Fu CC ¶ 34.)
 
·        
East West holds all of the defendants’
deposit accounts and handled wire transfers to and from the parties. (Fu CC
¶ 35.) 
 
·        
All of the wire transfers challenged by
cross-defendant Kou as being unauthorized originated in East West. (Fu CC
¶ 36.) 
 
·        
East West breached its duty of care by not
following appropriate Know Your Customer procedures. (Fu CC ¶ 37.) 
 
East West argues the above facts are insufficient to
establish the existence of a duty they owed to Fu and Meng. For reasons stated
below, the Court agrees. 
 
While a bank has a duty to act with reasonable care in
transactions with its depositors, the bank is not a fiduciary and owes no duty
to supervise account activity. (Kurtz-Ahlers, LLC v. Bank of America, N.A.
(2020) 48 Cal.App.5th 952, 956. [citations omitted].) A bank's duties to its
depositor under the account agreement are narrow in scope, including wrongful
dishonor of checks, duty to dishonor checks lacking required signatures, and
rendering accurate account statements. (Id. at 956.) 
 
There is no duty to “supervise account activity or to
inquire into the purpose for which funds are being used.” (Id. quoting Chazen
v. Centennial Bank (1998) 61 Cal.App.4th 532, 537.) Further, a bank has no
legal duty to, “…supervise account activity or otherwise track frequent and/or
large dollar transactions…” (Software Design & Application, Ltd.
(1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 472, 481.) Nor does a bank have a duty to “…inquire into
the purpose for which funds are being used…” (Keeney v. Bank of Italy
(1917) 33 Cal.App. 515, 518.) 
 
Here, the Cross-Complaint contains insufficient facts to
establish that East West owed Fu and Meng a duty of care. It is readily
apparent from the Cross-Complaint that Fu and Meng’s Negligence cause of action
is premised on East West’s alleged failure to adhere it its “Know Your Customer”
procedures. (CC ¶¶ 36-38.) The Cross-Complaint makes no effort to explain
what these procedures are, or how East West failed to adhere to them.
Regardless, it is clear that Fu and Meng allege East West was negligent for failing
to sufficiently vet the wire transfers. This is insufficient because the law is
clear that banks do not owe a duty to their customers to conduct such
preliminary investigations. 
 
In opposing this demurrer, Fu and Meng rely primarily on Basch
v. Bank of America (1943) 22 Cal.2d 316, 321. The Court notes that Basch
was superseded by statute, specifically the enactment of California Uniform
Commercial Code § 4-401, as noted in Chino Commercial Bank, N.A. v. Peters (2010)
190 Cal.App.4th 1163, 1173. Fu and Meng’s briefing does not mention that the
holding on which it primarily relies was superseded. In any event, Chino
Commercial makes clear that Basch no longer governs the viability of
Negligence claims against a bank. (Chino Commercial supra, 190
Cal.App.4th at 1173. [“This
provision displaces a common law claim for negligent payment of an ‘item’ on a
customer's account.”].) 
 
In short, Fu and Meng
have not sufficiently pleaded their cause of action for Negligence. The factual
allegations of the Cross-Complaint do not support any duty owed by East West to
Fu and Meng. In fact, the factual allegations make clear that this cause of
action is premised on actions which case law has disavowed as a basis for duty.
As such, the Court does not see a way in which Fu and Meng could amend to cure
this deficiency without running afoul of the sham pleading doctrine.
Accordingly, East West’s demurrer to the cause of action for Negligence is
SUSTAINED without leave to amend.
