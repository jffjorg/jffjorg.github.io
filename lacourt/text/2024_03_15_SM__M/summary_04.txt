And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion to compel the release of unredacted DMV records. The defendants had issued a deposition subpoena to the DMV for business records, but the DMV had redacted the records due to confidentiality concerns. The defendants had previously obtained redacted records, but were unable to obtain the unredacted records without a consent waiver signed by the plaintiff or a court order. The judge finds that there is a necessity for disclosure of the records in the interest of justice, as the defendants are entitled to conduct discovery into the medical reasons why the plaintiff's driver's license was suspended. The judge also notes that the plaintiff has put his medical condition at issue in the suit and has repeatedly concealed pertinent information regarding his driver's license and the reasons for its suspension.
