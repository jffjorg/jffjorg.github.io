Legal
Standard
 
            Personal service of a
deposition subpoena obligates the production of whatever documents or things
are specified in the subpoena and to appear in any proceedings to enforce
discovery. (CCP § 2020.220(c). If a nonparty disobeys a deposition subpoena,
the subpoenaing party may seek a court order pursuant to CCP section 1987.1
compelling the nonparty to comply with the subpoena within 60 days after
completion of the deposition record. (CCP § 2025.480(b); see also UnzippedApparel, LLC v. Bader
(2007) 156 Cal.App.4th 123, 127.)
 
The motion must be accompanied by a
meet and confer declaration. (CCP § 2025.480(b).) There is no “good cause”
requirement when seeking to compel documents from a nonparty. (CCP §
2020.410(c).) 
 
Analysis
 
Defendants
Kasra Mizban and Nasser Mizban move for an order authorizing the release of
unredacted documents from the California Department of Motor Vehicles (“DMV”)
in response to a deposition subpoena for the production of business records. 
 
On July 18,
2022, Defendants issued a Deposition Subpoena for Production of Business
Records (hereinafter referred to as “Subpoena”) to the DMV and obtained records
from the DMV on August 29, 2022. Large portions of the records obtained from
the DMV were redacted pursuant to Vehicle Code section 1808.21 and 1808.5. (Ex.
F.) Because Defendants were unable to secure medical records related to the
reasons why Plaintiff’s driver’s license was suspended, Defendants issued
another Subpoena to the DMV on August 2, 2023, that requested unredacted
records related to Plaintiff’s driver’s license suspensions; any vehicle
registrations associated with Plaintiff; and any reports of any motor vehicle
accidents involving Plaintiff. (Ex. G.) Defendants received records from the
DMV in response to the renewed Subpoena on or about September 15, 2023. (Id.) DMV
indicated that they could not release the unredacted information without a
consent waiver signed by Plaintiff, or a court order authorizing the release of
any personal and/or confidential information. (Ex. I.) Plaintiff did not return
the signed consent waiver for release of the records. 
 
            The relevant DMV records regarding Plaintiff’s driver’s
license suspension were redacted pursuant to Vehicle Code section 1808.5, which
provides that “all records of the department relating to the physical or mental
condition of any person… are confidential and not open to public inspection.” This
does not mean that the records are protected from disclosure in this matter. Courts
engage in a traditional privacy balancing test under Evidence Code section 1040(b)(1),
which requires trial courts to determine whether there is a “necessity for
preserving the confidentiality of the information that outweighs the necessity
for disclosure in the interest of justice.” (Dep't of Motor Vehicles v.
Superior Ct. (2002) 100 Cal. App. 4th 363, 377; see also Hill v.
National Collegiate Athletic Assn. (1994) 7 Cal.4th 1, 41 [medical privacy
is judicially recognized and protected].) 
 
            Defendants should be afforded the right to conduct
discovery into the medical reasons why Plaintiff’s driver’s license was
suspended at the time of the incident. There are multiple factors weighing
towards disclosure. Plaintiff has put his medical condition at issue in this
suit. Furthermore, Plaintiff has repeatedly concealed pertinent
information regarding his driver’s license and the reasons
and/or circumstances related to why his driver’s license was suspended at the
time of the incident, forcing Defendants to seek these
documents directly from the DMV. Plaintiff also did not
object to the Subpoena. 
 
            Accordingly, the motion is GRANTED.
