```

And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is inclined to dissolve the preliminary injunction and decline to grant a refund of the $652,166.39 paid by the defendants under the injunction. The purpose of the preliminary injunction was to preserve the status quo pending trial, but the trial is now complete and the habitability issues have been adjudicated against the plaintiff. The defendants have not shown entitlement to a refund of the payments made under the injunction and the plaintiff did not fairly incur any expenses following the judgment. Therefore, the court will decline to require further payments on the injunction, including for any of the plaintiff's costs incurred following the judgment.
