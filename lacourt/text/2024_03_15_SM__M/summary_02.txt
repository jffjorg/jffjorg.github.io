And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendant's motion to reclassify the case to a limited jurisdiction court. The defendant argued that the amount in controversy does not exceed $35,000 and that the investigation has shown that a recovery greater than $35,000 cannot be obtained by the plaintiffs. However, the judge found that the defendant failed to show that the plaintiffs cannot recover more than $35,000 as a matter of law. The judge noted that the plaintiffs' complaint only alleges damages of $16,574.45, but also pled general and emotional distress damages, which could potentially exceed the jurisdictional requirement. The judge ruled that the defendant's motion is unsupported and denied the motion.
