MOTION:                  Motion
for Sanctions, OSC re: Dissolution of Preliminary Injunction 
HEARING DATE:   3/15/2023
 
Legal
Standard
 
The Court has the power to impose
reasonable money sanctions, not to exceed fifteen hundred dollars ($1,500),
payable to the court for any violation of a
lawful court order by a person, done without good cause or substantial
justification. (CCP §177.5.)  The party
seeking to impose sanctions need only show the failure to obey earlier orders.
(Puritan Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1985) 171 Cal.App.3d 877, 884
[interpreting former statute dealing with “refusal” to comply].) Numerous cases
hold that severe sanctions (i.e., terminating or evidentiary sanctions) for
failure to comply with a court order are allowed only where the failure was
willful. (See R.S. Creative, Inc. v. Creative Cotton, Ltd. (1999) 75
Cal.App.4th 486, 495; Vallbona v. Springer (1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 1525,
1545; Biles v. Exxon Mobil Corp. (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1327.) The
burden of proof then shifts to the party seeking to avoid sanctions to
establish a satisfactory excuse for his or her conduct. (Corns v. Miller
(1986) 181 Cal.App.3d 195, 201; Williams v. Russ (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th
1215, 1227.)
 
Analysis
 
Defendants request: (1) dissolution
of the preliminary injunction; and (2) an order that Plaintiff refund
Defendants the $652,166.39 paid to Plaintiff under the preliminary injunction,
or a portion of it. The Court is inclined to dissolve the injunction, but not
inclined to grant a refund.
 
As to the dissolution, Code of
Civil Procedure section 533 “articulates three independent bases on which a
modification of an injunction may be predicated – (1) change in the facts, (2)
change in the law, or (3) ends of justice.” (Luckett v. Panos (2008) 161
Cal.App.4th 77, 85.) Here, there has been a substantial change of circumstances
based upon the jury’s verdict following a jury trial. 
 
Here, the purpose behind the
preliminary injunction has been completed. The principal purpose of such an
injunction is to preserve the status quo pending trial. (Scaringe v.
J.C.C. Enterprises, Inc.
(1988) 205 Cal.App.3d 1536.) Trial is no longer pending, and therefore, the
injunction would no longer preserve the status quo pending trial. The
jury verdict expressly found there were no habitability violations, which
substantially undermines the express purpose of the injunction order to “provide
alternative housing to Plaintiff until the habitability issues at Plaintiffs
residence are remediated.” While remediation efforts are still ongoing, the
habitability issue was adjudicated against Plaintiff. Furthermore, at the time
the injunction was issued, the court expressly expected that this was a
“temporary solution” that could take “several months or longer to complete.” Contrary
to the court’s expectations, it has been more than 30 months and $650,000 in
expenses incurred since the injunction issued. Considering these facts, and the
fact that jury awarded Plaintiff only $58,000 on a negligence cause of action, the
injunction has gone far enough, and is “no longer necessary or desirable” to
preserve the status quo pending trial. (City of Oakland v. Sup.Ct.
(1982) 136 Cal.App.3d 565, 569.) The ends of justice would therefore require
dissolution. 
 
As to the claw back request, Defendants
have not shown entitlement to the $652,166.39 paid per the preliminary
injunction. (Vaca Decl., Ex. F.) Defendants cite to general, inherent powers of
the court, which recognize the power to exercise “reasonable control over all
proceedings connected with the litigation before it,” and fundamental fairness.
(Hayes v. Super. Ct. (1940) 16 Cal.2d 260, 264; see also CCP §128.) The
Court would not find it fair to burden Plaintiff with the responsibility of the
payments under the injunction. Nothing in the injunction order suggested that
Plaintiff would become responsible for any payments under the injunction, or
that the payments would be subject to a claw back procedure. In fact, the
design and purpose of the preliminary injunction in this case suggests any risk
of delay was borne by Defendants. Defendants alone had control over the speed
of the construction.  Defendants should
have appealed the initial preliminary injunction if they were unhappy with the
order or the lack of a bond to insure against damages caused by an improper
injunction. Also, there was no evidence adduced at trial that supported the 30-month
delay in construction, or how Defendants attempted to minimize payments under
the injunction. Instead, Defendants accepted the injunction, and permitted
these circumstances to languish. Further, the court declined to order a bond,
which would be the typical mechanism to recover from an improperly granted
preliminary injunction. Since there is no bond posted, case law suggests
Defendants may only recover in a collateral action. (See, e.g., Dickey v.
Rosso (1972) 23 Cal.App.3d 493, 497-498 [when a preliminary injunction is
dissolved as having been improperly granted, the aggrieved defendant may
recover damages by proceeding against the injunction bond or by a malicious
prosecution action]; see also Top Cat Productions, Inc. v. Michael's Los
Feliz (2002) 102 CalApp.4th 474, 478 [the purpose of a bond is to afford
compensation to party wrongly enjoined or restrained].)
 
Accordingly, the Court orders that
the subject preliminary injunction is dissolved and no longer in effect as of
the date of judgment – December 15, 2023. In light of the ruling on the
dissolution issue, the Court will decline to require further payments on the
injunction, including for any of Plaintiff’s costs incurred following the
judgment.  Plaintiff did not fairly incur
any expenses following the judgment, given that the habitability issues were
resolved against her and the purpose of the injunction was complete.  Plaintiff claims that from December 15, 2023
(the date of judgment) through March 15, 2024 (this hearing date), she incurred
approximately $32,294 in housing, $16,562 in per diems, and $264 in parking, for
total costs of $49,120.00. Plaintiff claims that Defendants still owe $34,331.05
in outstanding payments based on her total claimed expenses of $281,335.80, and
Defendants’ undisputed payment of $247,004.75. Lowering Plaintiff’s total claimed
costs ($281,355.80) by the amounts incurred after the judgment ($49,120.00)
would bring Plaintiff’s cost total under the injunction to $232,235.80, less
than the total amount paid by Defendants ($247,004.75). Thus, Defendants do not
owe any further payments under the injunction.  As such, the Court will decline to issue
additional sanctions against Defendants for non-payment. (CCP§177.5.)
