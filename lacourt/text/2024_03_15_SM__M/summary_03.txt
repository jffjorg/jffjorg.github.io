And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge tentatively rules that the motion to compel further responses to requests for production of documents, filed by Defendant Providence Health System – Southern California, et al., will be denied as to categories two through four, and granted as to category one, which is Mrs. Wallach's cell phone. The judge finds that while Defendant has shown a legitimate interest in conducting a forensic inspection of Plaintiffs' devices to confirm that they have produced all relevant documents, Plaintiffs have established a legally protected privacy interest in their private telephone communications with third parties, including their medical privacy. The judge also notes that Plaintiffs have produced most of the requested documents, and that the remaining requests are overly broad and oppressive. The judge requires further evidence to support the motion before making a final ruling.
