**Summary:**

The Judge's tentative ruling is a rejection of the Plaintiff's complaint, with the Court sustaining the demurrer to each of the four causes of action alleged by the Plaintiff.

* The first cause of action for retaliation in violation of Labor Code section 1102.5 is dismissed because the Plaintiff's disclosure about needing more toys and kid-friendly items in a facility does not amount to whistleblowing activity protected by the statute.
* The second cause of action for retaliation in violation of Labor Code section 6310 is also dismissed because the Plaintiff did not allege concerns regarding workplace safety for employees, but mainly expressed concern about the general safety of children in the lobby.
* The third cause of action for wrongful termination in violation of public policy is dismissed because the Plaintiff's allegations are insufficient and do not demonstrate a violation of public policy.
* The Court also sustains the demurrer to the First and Second Causes of Action, and the Third Cause of Action fails because the Plaintiff's claims are not supported by factual allegations.

The Court's ruling is based on its analysis of the pleadings and the law, and the Court finds that the Plaintiff has not alleged sufficient facts to state a cause of action under any of the alleged causes of action. The Court also denies the Plaintiff's request for leave to amend the complaint.
