Here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on Plaintiff's motion to compel further responses and documents from Defendant. Plaintiff Marita Herrera alleges that she purchased a 2021 Honda Pilot with a defective audio system, electrical system, and braking system. Defendant American Honda Motor Company, Inc. objects to Plaintiff's document requests on the grounds that they are vague and overbroad. The court rejects these objections and finds that the requested documents are relevant and reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible information. The court grants Plaintiff's motion and orders Defendant to serve further responses to RFP Nos. 16, 19-21, 32, and 42 within 20 days of the date of this Order and produce all responsive documents in its possession, custody, and control.
