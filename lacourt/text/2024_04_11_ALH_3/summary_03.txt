And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

This tentative ruling is in response to the demurrer filed by defendants David Ventimiglia and Anita Ventimiglia on the grounds that there is another action pending between the same parties. The Court takes judicial notice of the complaint filed in the Ventimiglia Action. The Court finds that the instant action is an unlawful detainer and involves questions of possession, whereas the Ventimiglia Action is not an unlawful detainer and involves questions of title. Therefore, both suits are not predicated on the same cause of action. The Court overrules the demurrer and allows the unlawful detainer action to proceed.
