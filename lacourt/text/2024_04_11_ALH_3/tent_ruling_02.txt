I.           
INTRODUCTION 
On May 8,
2023, Plaintiff Odette Vivanco (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against
Defendants Ottimo Resources Inc., Pacific Clinics (“Defendant”), and Does 1 to
10 alleging causes of action for: (1) retaliation in violation of California Labor
Code, Section 1102.5; (2) retaliation in violation of California Labor
Code, Section 6310; (3) wrongful termination in violation of public policy;
and (4) breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. 
On October
13, 2023, the Court sustained Defendant’s demurrer to the Complaint in its
entirety with leave to amend. 
On October
19, 2023, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) asserting claims
for retaliation in violation of Labor Code section 1102.5, retaliation in
violation of Labor Code section 6310, and wrongful termination in violation of
public policy. 
On March 6,
2024, the Court heard oral argument and continued the hearing to allow the
parties to submit supplemental briefing. The parties filed supplemental briefs
and a transcript of the hearing on March 20, 2024.

DEMURRER 
“A demurrer tests the sufficiency of a
complaint as a matter of law.”  (Durell
v. Sharp Healthcare (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 1350, 1358.) “[T]he court gives
the complaint a reasonable interpretation, and treats the demurrer as admitting
all material facts properly pleaded.”  (Ibid.)  In testing the sufficiency of the complaint,
the court must assume the truth of: (1) the properly pleaded factual
allegations; (2) facts that can be reasonably inferred from those expressly
pleaded; and (3) judicially noticed matters. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39
Cal.3d 311, 318.) A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or
other extrinsic matters. (SKF Farms v. Superior Court (1984) 153 Cal.
App. 3d 902, 905.) Accordingly, “[w]hether the plaintiff will be able to prove
the pleaded facts is irrelevant to ruling upon the demurrer.” (Stevens v.
Superior Court (1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 605, 609-10.)
A general demurrer may be taken to a complaint
where “[t]he pleading does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of
action.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 430.10(e).) Although courts construe pleadings
liberally, sufficient facts must be alleged to support the allegations plead to
survive a demurrer. (Rakestraw v. California Physicians' Serv. (2000) 81
Cal. App. 4th 39, 43.) “Because a demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of a
complaint, the plaintiff must show the complaint alleges facts sufficient to
establish every element of each cause of action.” (Ibid.) 
Where
a demurrer is sustained, leave to amend must be allowed where there is a
reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman
v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.) The burden is on the plaintiff
to show the court that a pleading can be amended successfully. (Ibid.)
However, “[i]f there is any reasonable possibility that the plaintiff can state
a good cause of action, it is error to sustain a demurrer without leave to
amend.” (Youngman v. Nevada Irrigation Dist. (1969) 70 Cal.2d 240, 245).

A.
      First Cause of Action
          The Court previously found that
Plaintiff’s first cause of action in the initial complaint failed because there
was no protected activity alleged or causal link between Plaintiff’s
non-protected activity of notifying Defendant of the need for additional toys
and her termination. Plaintiff contends that her retaliation claims are
adequately pled. 
          To state a cause of action for
violation of Lab. Code § 1102.5, “a plaintiff must show (1) she engaged in
protected activity, (2) her employer subjected her to an adverse employment
action, and (3) there is a causal link between the two.” (Mokler v. County
of Orange (2007) 157 Cal.App.4th 121, 138.) “[T]emporal proximity, by
itself, may be sufficient to establish a prima face claim . . . of
retaliation.” (Artega v. Brink’s, Inc. (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 327, 334.)

To
state a cause of action under Lab. Code § 1102.5, a complaint must allege that
there was disclosure of a violation of a statute, regulation or rule. (Patten
v. Grant Joint Union High Dist. (2005) 134 Cal.App.4th 1378, 1388, [disapproved
of on other grounds by Lawson v. PPG Architectural Finishes, Inc. (2022)
12 Cal.5th 703].)  “An employee engages
in activity protected by [Labor Code section 1102.5] when the employee
discloses reasonably based suspicions of illegal activity.” (Ross v. County
of Riverside (2019) 36 Cal.App.5th 580, 592.) “To have a reasonably based
suspicion of illegal activity, the employee must be able to point to some legal
foundation for his suspicion—some statute, rule or regulation which may have
been violated by the conduct he disclosed.” (Ibid.) Generally, statutory
causes of action must be pleaded with particularity. (Perez v. Golden Empire
Transit Dist. (2012) 209 Cal.App.4th 1228, 1237, fn.3.) 
Plaintiff
alleges that she notified Defendants that an adequate supply of toys was needed
for waiting areas and therapy rooms. (FAC, ¶¶ 19-23.) The FAC alleges that in
February 2023, a child at one of Defendant’s facilities caused a dangerous
safety incident when the child inserted an object into an electrical outlet,
which started a small fire. (Id., ¶ 25.) Plaintiff alleges that she was
fired shortly after exchanging emails “about the lack of toys and supplies for
the children and how that contributed to the safety incident at the facility.”
(Id., ¶¶ 26-27.) 
Previously, the Court found Plaintiff’s
reference to Health and Safety Code section 1596.95 and 29 CFR 1910(s) to be
insufficient to state a claim for retaliation. In response to the Court’s prior
ruling, Plaintiff added an allegation that her safety concerns implicated Civil
Code section 1714, which is the general statute codifying the ordinary duty of
care owed by every person. (FAC, ¶ 18.) Civil Code section 1714 does not
proscribe any conduct, but merely sets forth that “[e]veryone is responsible,
not only for the result of his or her willful acts, but also for an injury
occasioned to another by his or her want of ordinary care of skill  in the management of his or her property or
person, except so far as the latter has, willfully or by want of ordinary care,
brought the injury upon himself or herself.”
Plaintiff’s disclosure about needing more toys
and kid-friendly items for children to play with in the lobby does not amount
to the kind of whistleblowing activity which is protected by Labor Code section
1102.5. (Patten, supra, 134 Cal.App.4th at p. 1385.) In Patten,
the Third Appellate District held that a disclosure “about needing more staff
[on a large school campus] for safety purposes” did not amount to
whistleblowing as a matter of law. Therefore, the Court finds that Plaintiff still
has not stated a sufficient cause of action for violation of Lab. Code § 1102
and the Court SUSTAINS Defendant’s demurrer to the first cause of action in the
FAC. 
B.
     Second Cause of Action
          Lab. Code § 6310(b) provides that an
employee cannot be retaliated against for making a “bona fide oral or written
complaint . . . to their employer . . . of unsafe working conditions.” A cause
of action under Lab. Code § 6310 requires a plaintiff to show that “(1) she
engaged in protected activity, (2) her employer subjected her to an adverse
employment action, and (3) a causal link between the two.” (St. Myers v.
Dignity Health (2019) 44 Cal.App.5th 301, 314.) A cause of action under
Lab. Code § 6310 has similar requirements to a cause of action under Lab. Code §
1102.5. 
          Defendant raises the same arguments as
to the insufficiency of the second cause of action that were raised as to the
first cause of action. The Court references its analysis as to the first cause
of action and incorporates it herein. A review of the FAC shows that Plaintiff
did not allege concerns regarding workplace safety for employees, but mainly
expressed concern about the general safety of the children in the lobby. (FAC,
¶¶ 19, 22.)  
          Accordingly, the Court SUSTAINS the
demurrer to the second cause of action.
C.       Third Cause of Action
          To state a cause of action for
wrongful termination in violation of public policy, a plaintiff must allege the
following: (1) the plaintiff was employed by the defendant; (2) the defendant
discharged the plaintiff from employment; (3) the alleged violation of public
policy was the motivating reason for plaintiff’s discharge; (4) the plaintiff
was harmed; and (5) the discharge was a substantial factor in causing plaintiff
harm. (CACI 2430.) Here, it appears that Plaintiff is alleging that Defendant
violated public policy by firing her because she was a whistleblower raising
workplace safety concerns because Plaintiff expressly cites to Labor Code
sections 1102.5 and 6310, which form the basis for her First and Second Causes
of Action. (Reply, p. 2; FAC, ¶¶ 62-67.) As stated above, Plaintiff’s First and
Second Causes of Action are insufficiently alleged. Therefore, Plaintiff’s
Third Cause of Action also fails. To the extent that Plaintiff claims that
Defendant violated public policy by discriminating against her, this theory is
not supported by any factual allegations. 
          Therefore, Defendant’s demurrer to the
Third Cause of Action of the FAC is SUSTAINED. 
III.       
MOTION TO STRIKE
Moving Defendant seeks to strike punitive
damages allegations from the complaint and prayer for relief therein. Due to
the Court sustaining the demurrer to each cause of action in the complaint, the
motion to strike is taken off calendar is moot. 
VI.    CONCLUSION
          Plaintiff
fails to show how amendment is possible. Accordingly. the Court SUSTAINS Defendant’s
demurrer without leave to amend. 
          Defendant’s
motion to strike is taken off calendar as moot. 
          Moving party
is ordered to give notice.
