     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
defendant paul meyers’ demurrer to second
  amended complaint 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On May 23, 2023, Plaintiff Michael
Boyd filed this action against Defendants Megan St. Clair, Peter Burra, HALO
Behavioral Health, Inc., Brandon St. Clair, and Paul Meyers. Plaintiff filed
the operative Second Amended Complaint on June 11, 2024, asserting 15 causes of
action arising from the following facts. 
            Plaintiff alleges that he was
engaged to Kathleen St. Clair (Kathleen) until her death in May 2022.
Kathleen’s two children, Defendants Megan St. Clair (Megan) and Brandon St.
Clair (Brandon), were allegedly hostile towards Kathleen and resentful of the relationship
between Plaintiff and Kathleen. When Kathleen was hospitalized for a heart
attack, Megan allegedly used a California Advanced Health Care Directive
(CAHCD) to place Kathleen in hospice, exclude Plaintiff from visiting, and
prohibit Kathleen’s healthcare providers from communicating with Plaintiff. 
The complaint alleges that Megan and her
husband, Defendant Bryan Burra (Burra), falsely accused Plaintiff of having a
criminal record as a pretext to exclude him from Kathleen’s care. Megan and
Burra allegedly embarked on a scheme to investigate Plaintiff and fabricate and
disseminate false information on Plaintiff. This scheme allegedly involved
resources and employees of their business, Defendant HALO Behavioral Health,
Inc. (HALO). Megan allegedly filed for a temporary restraining order (TRO)
against Plaintiff based on false information. 
In November 2022, Plaintiff was
hospitalized. Defendant Paul Meyers (Meyers), Kathleen’s brother, allegedly
discovered this by calling the hospital and then informed Brandon. Brandon then
allegedly took the opportunity to break into Plaintiff’s home, taking furniture
and other property. Plaintiff alleges that Megan, Burra, and Meyers were either
present at or assisted in the burglary and that Megan and Burra took possession
of the stolen property. Plaintiff alleges that Megan and Burra burglarized his
home again in January 2023. 
On July 16, 2024, Meyers filed the instant
demurrer to the first, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, tenth, and
eleventh causes of action in the SAC. Plaintiff filed his late opposition on
August 6, 2024. Meyers filed his reply on August 9, 2024.
LEGAL STANDARD
A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether
the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When
considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in
context. (Taylor v. City of Los
Angeles Dept. of Water and Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228.)
In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the
pleading or by proper judicial notice. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.30, subd.
(a).) A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other
extrinsic matters. (SKF Farms v. Superior
Court (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 902, 905.) Therefore, it lies only where the
defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed. (Ibid.) The only issue involved in a
demurrer hearing is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with
extraneous matters, states a cause of action. (Hahn, supra, 147 Cal.App.4th at 747.)
MEET AND CONFER
Before filing a demurrer or a motion to
strike, the demurring or moving party is required to meet and confer with the
party who filed the pleading demurred to or the pleading that is subject to the
motion to strike for the purposes of determining whether an agreement can be
reached through a filing of an amended pleading that would resolve the
objections to be raised in the demurrer. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 430.41, 435.5.)
The Court notes that Defendant has complied with the meet and confer
requirement. (See Manaa Decl.)
DISCUSSION
I.
Defamation and False Light (First and Eighth COAs)
            The elements of a defamation claim
are: (1) publication that is (2) false, (3) defamatory, (4) unprivileged, and
(5) has a natural tendency to injure or cause special damage. (Wong v. Jing
(2010) 189 Cal.App.4th 1354, 1369.) False statements charging the commission of
crime, or tending directly to injure a plaintiff in respect to his or her
profession by imputing dishonesty or questionable professional conduct are
defamatory
per se. (Burrill v. Nair (2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 357, 383.) “[Where] the
language is ambiguous and an explanation is necessary to establish the
defamatory meaning, the pleader must do two things: (1) Allege his
interpretation of the defamatory meaning of the language (the ‘innuendo,’ . .
.); (2) support that interpretation by alleging facts showing that the readers
or hearers to whom it was published would understand it in that defamatory
sense (the ‘inducement’).” (Barnes-Hind, Inc. v. Superior Court (1986)
181 Cal.App.3d 377, 387.) 
            Here, the defamation claim as
against Meyers is based on the allegation that Meyers falsely claimed that
Plaintiff was living in Kathleen’s house “for free.” (SAC ¶¶ 50-51.) A
statement that someone is living in a home for free is not defamatory per se. Plaintiff
has failed to allege the defamatory meaning of the statement, as well as the
defamatory effect on a listener. (See Barnes-Hind, supra, 181 Cal.App.3d
at p. 387.) Therefore, the defamation claim fails as a matter of law.
            “When a false light claim is coupled
with a defamation claim, the false light claim is essentially superfluous, and
stands or falls on whether it meets the same requirements as the defamation
cause of action.” (Jackson v. Mayweather (2017) 10 Cal.App.5th 1240,
1264.) Because the defamation claim fails, so does the derivative false light
claim.
The demurrer is SUSTAINED as to the first
and eighth causes of action.  
II.
Trespass, Theft, Conversion, and Invasion of Privacy (Third, Fourth, Fifth,
Sixth, and Seventh COAs) 
            Meyers argues that there are no
allegations he directly participated in the alleged breaking into Plaintiff’s
property or stealing Plaintiff’s personal belongings. However, Meyers does not
challenge the civil conspiracy claim. “The elements of an action for civil
conspiracy are (1) formation and operation of the conspiracy and (2) damage
resulting to plaintiff (3) from a wrongful act done in furtherance of the
common design.” (Prakashpalan v. Engstrom, Lipscomb & Lack (2014)
223 Cal.App.4th 1105, 1136.) “The significance of a conspiracy theory of
liability is that each member may be held jointly liable as a tortfeasor, even
though he or she may not have participated directly in the underlying tort.” (Ibid.)

            The SAC alleges that Meyers assisted
in the breaking and theft by informing Brandon that Plaintiff had been
hospitalized and was away from home. (SAC ¶ 193.) The SAC further alleges that
Meyers was “present and participated” in the trespass onto Plaintiff’s
property. (Id., ¶ 222.) These facts sufficiently support liability
against Meyers under civil conspiracy. Therefore, Plaintiff has adequately pled
claims for trespass, theft, conversion, and invasion of privacy against
Meyers.  
            The demurrer is OVERRULED as to the
third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh causes of action. 
III.
Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress (Tenth COA)
To state a cause
of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress, a plaintiff must
establish: (1) outrageous conduct by the defendant; (2) the defendant’s
intention of causing, or reckless disregard of the probability of causing,
emotional distress; (3) the plaintiff’s suffering severe or extreme emotional
distress; and (4) actual and proximate causation of the emotional distress by
the defendant’s outrageous conduct. (Vasquez v. Franklin Management Real
Estate Fund, Inc. (2013) 222 Cal.App.4th 819, 832.) “For conduct to be
outrageous, it must be so extreme as to exceed all bounds of that usually
tolerated by a civilized community.” (Faunce v. Cate (2013) 222
Cal.App.4th 166, 172.) “Severe
emotional distress [is] emotional distress of such substantial quantity or
enduring quality that no reasonable man in a civilized society should be
expected to endure it.” (Fletcher v. Western Life Insurance Co. (1970)
10 Cal.App.3d 376, 397.) 
Plaintiff fails
to allege severe emotional distress. “[D]iscomfort, worry, anxiety, upset
stomach, concern, and agitation” do not satisfy the severity standard. (Hughes
v. Pair (2009) 46 Cal.4th 1035, 1051.) Plaintiff makes generic allegations
such as “suffering, anguish, fright, horror, nervousness, grief, anxiety,
worry, shock, humiliation, and shame.” (See SAC ¶ 299.) This does not
sufficiently demonstrate severe emotional distress. 
The demurrer is SUSTAINED as to the tenth
cause of action. 
IV.
Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress (Eleventh COA)
            “There is no independent tort of
negligent infliction of emotional distress; rather, ‘[t]he tort is negligence,
a cause of action in which a duty to the plaintiff is an essential element.’” (Ragland
v. U.S. Bank National Assn. (2012) 209 Cal.App.4th 182, 205, quoting Potter
v. Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. (1993) 6 Cal.4th 965, 984.) 
            Plaintiff has failed to allege any
duty of care owed by Meyers towards him. Therefore, the NIED claim fails for
this additional reason. 
            The demurrer is SUSTAINED as to the
eleventh cause of action.   
CONCLUSION
            Defendant Paul Meyers’ demurrer is
SUSTAINED in part as set forth above without leave to amend.
