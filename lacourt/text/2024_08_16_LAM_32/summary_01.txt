And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendants' motion for summary adjudication of punitive damages. The case involves the wrongful death of a guest at a Marriott hotel, who committed suicide in their room. The hotel employees refused to provide the room number to law enforcement despite being informed of the suicide risk. The court finds that the employees' conduct does not rise to the level of malice, oppression, or fraud required for punitive damages. The court also finds that the hotel's policy permitting disclosure of guest information when there is probable danger was not followed by the employees. The plaintiff has failed to present clear and convincing evidence to raise a triable issue, and therefore the motion is granted.
