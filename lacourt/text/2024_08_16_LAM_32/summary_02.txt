Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Defendant Paul Meyers to the Second Amended Complaint (SAC). The SAC alleges various causes of action against the defendants, including defamation, false light, trespass, theft, conversion, invasion of privacy, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and negligent infliction of emotional distress.

The judge has sustained Meyers' demurrer to the first and eighth causes of action (defamation and false light) as they fail to state a cause of action. The judge has overruled the demurrer to the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh causes of action (trespass, theft, conversion, invasion of privacy) as the SAC adequately pleads these claims against Meyers.

The judge has sustained Meyers' demurrer to the tenth and eleventh causes of action (intentional infliction of emotional distress and negligent infliction of emotional distress) as the SAC fails to adequately plead these claims.

The judge has ordered that the demurrer be sustained in part and that the parties be given an opportunity to file a noticed motion to modify the judgment.
