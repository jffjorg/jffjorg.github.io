The judge is considering a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling of documents or things by the plaintiff (John Doe) against the defendant (Jane Smith). The judge notes that the party to whom the demand is directed must respond separately to each item or category of item by stating whether they will comply with the demand, lack the ability to comply, or object to the demand. The judge's tentative ruling is based on California Code of Civil Procedure sections 2031.220 and 2031.310(a), which outline the procedures for responding to demands for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling.
