I.               
Background
            Plaintiff was
employed by Defendants AB Renovations Corp., E7 Referrals Inc. and Jermaine
Franklin from September to October 2023. 
Plaintiff alleges Defendant Jermaine Franklin, the principal of AB
Renovations Corp. and E7 Referrals, Inc., made unwanted sexual advances and
penalized her when she refused his advances. 
In response to her complaints, Defendants terminated her
employment.  Plaintiff alleges she was
also deprived of meal times and rest breaks and subjected to other Labor Code
violations.
            On November
28, 2023, Plaintiff filed this action against Defendants alleging (1)
discrimination on the basis of sex and gender in violation of FEHA; (2)
harassment in violation of FEHA—Hostile Work Environment; (3) harassment in
violation of FEHA—Quid Pro Quo; (4) retaliation in violation of FEHA; (5)
failure to prevent discrimination, harassment and retaliation in violation of
FEHA; (6) wrongful termination in violation of public policy; (7) nonpayment of
wages; (8) nonpayment of minimum wage; (9) nonpayment of overtime compensation;
(10) failure to provide meal periods; (11) failure to provide rest periods;
(12) unreimbursed business expenses; (13) failure to furnish complete and
accurate wage statements; (14) waiting time penalties for nonpayment of wages.
II.        Defendants AB Renovations Corp et al and
Jermain Franklin’s Motion to Compel Further Response to Form Interrogatories 1
and 2 and Demand for Documents (CRS #0630 filed on 04/16/24)
A.             
Legal Standard
            “[T]he
propounding party may move for an order compelling a further response if the
propounding party deems that . . . (1) An answer to a particular interrogatory
is evasive or incomplete[,] (2) An exercise of the option to produce documents
under Section 2030.230 is unwarranted or the required specification of those
documents is inadequate[, and/or that] (3) An objection to an interrogatory is
without merit or too general.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (a).)
            The moving party must demonstrate a
“reasonable and good faith attempt” at an informal resolution of each issue
presented. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2016.040, 2030.300, subd. (b)(1).) “In lieu of
a separate statement required under the California Rules of Court, the court
may allow the moving party to submit a concise outline of the discovery request
and each response in dispute.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (b)(2).)
            Notice
of the motion must be provided “within 45 days of the service of the verified
response, or any supplemental verified response, or on or before any specific
later date to which the propounding party and the responding party have agreed
in writing. . .” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (c).) The responding party
has the burden of justifying the objections to the requests. (Coy v. Superior Court (1962) 58 Cal.2d
210, 220-221.)
            “The
court shall impose a monetary sanction. . . against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a further
response to interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the
sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make
the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd.
(d).)
            B. 
       Discussion
            On February
6, 2024, Defendants sent Plaintiff (1) Form Interrogatories (Set One); (2) Form
Interrogatories (Set Two); and (3) Demands for Documents.  (Watkins Dec., 2:17-22.)  Defendants’ Motion to Compel Further
Responses to the Form Interrogatories (Sets One and Two) and the Demands for
Documents must be continued for several procedural reasons.
            No
evidence to support request for further responses vs. initial responses.  Defendants’ motion is captioned as one to
compel further responses.  However, according
to Watkins’ declaration, Plaintiff never served any responses to these
discovery requests.  (Id. at 3:13-14.)  Plaintiff disputes this and claims she served
responses on March 11, 2024.  (Singh
Dec., ¶3.)  Defendants’ evidence in
support of the motion therefore does not support a request to compel further
responses but to compel initial responses.
            No
evidence of sufficient good faith meet and confer effort.  Defendants also failed to comply with the
meet and confer requirement under CCP §§2030.300(b)(1) and 2031.310(b)(1).  Counsel Watkins claims he sent a meet and
confer letter on March 22, 2024, but he fails to attach a copy of the letter to
his declaration.  (Watkins Dec. filed on 4/16/24,
3:3-12.)  The parties participated in a phone
call on April 3, 2024, regarding other, unrelated discovery.  (Id. at 3:8-12.)  Defendants filed the motion on April 16, 2024.  Defendants’ mailing of a single letter
approximately one month before filing the motion does not qualify as a good
faith attempt to informally resolve each issue raised in this motion.  (CCP §2016.040.)  The court also cannot evaluate the
sufficiency of the meet and confer letter sent on March 22, 2024, because it is
not attached to Watkins’ declaration. 
            Failure
to submit a separate statement in compliance with CRC Rule 3.1345.  Defendants also submit a defective separate
statement under CRC Rule 3.1345. 
Defendants’ separate statement fails to set forth the full text of the
discovery responses.  In fact, the court
has no idea what Plaintiff’s purported requests or responses were.   A copy of the requests and responses is not
attached to the Watkins declaration, nor are they reproduced fully in the
separate statement. For this reason, the court cannot evaluate whether further
responses are justified.   
C.             
Conclusion 

 
Defendants’ Motion to Compel
Further Responses to Form Interrogatories (Sets One and Two) and Demands for
Documents (CRS #0630) is DENIED.  
III.      Defendants
AB Renovations Corp and Jermaine Franklin Motion to Compel Further Responses to
Special Interrogatories (Set One) (CRS #0386 filed on 05/29/24)
            A.        Legal
Standard
            See
Motion #1 
            B.
       Discussion
            Defendants served Plaintiff with
Special Interrogatories (Set One) on March 3, 2024,  Plaintiff served responses on April 22, 2024.  Defendants filed the instant motion to compel
on May 29, 2024.  Defendants’ motion is continued
for much the same reasons stated in connection with Defendants’ Motion to
Compel Responses to Form Rogs and Demands for Documents discussed above. 
 
            Insufficient meet and confer.  Defendants were required to meet and confer
in good faith on each and every issue raised in this motion prior to filing the
motion.  (CCP §§2016.040 and 2030.300(b)(1).)  Counsel Watkins testifies that he contacted
Plaintiff’s counsel on May 6, 2024 regarding the April 22, 2024 responses but
fails to state the form of contact—letter, phone, email—or the substance of the
communication.  (Watkins Dec. filed on
5/29/24, 2:17-21.)  According to
Plaintiff’s counsel, the letter demanded further responses by May 20, 2024 but
it failed to identify any defects in the responses themselves.  (Singh Dec. filed on June 11, 2024,
¶¶4-5.)  Counsel participated in a call
on May 9, 2024, in which the Plaintiff informed Defendants that they failed to
identify any defects with Plaintiff’s responses.  (Id.) 
Defense counsel purportedly failed to identify any defects and merely
argued the merits of the case.  (Id.
at ¶5.)  Defendants filed the instant
motion approximately three weeks later on May 29, 2024.  
            Defendants fail to establish that
they met and conferred in good faith. 
Defendants fail to provide any evidence as to what the May 6 letter
contained or the substance of the May 9, 2024 conversation.  Defendants made no attempt to meet and confer
further, even though the 45/50-day deadline to bring this motion to compel
would not have expired for another month. 
            Separate statement fails to
comply with CRC Rule 3.1345.  Defendants
filed several documents purporting to be the separate statement in support of
this motion:  (1) a document filed on May
14, 2024 that purports to be Plaintiff’s responses to Defendant AB Renovations
Corp.’s Special Interrogatories (Set One) and entitled in eCourt as “separate
statement”; (2) a “Separate Statement” filed on May 29, 2024 that sets forth
the special interrogatories and Defendants’ reasons for seeking further
responses; and (3) three volumes of documents filed on June 6, 2024 that lists
each discovery request and Plaintiff’s responses thereto. 
            None of these three sets of
documents satisfies the requirements of CRC Rule 3.1345, which requires that
the separate statement list each request separately, followed by the allegedly
deficient response, followed by Defendants’ statement regarding why a further
responses is required.  Defendants did
not request prior to filing the motion leave to file a “concise outline” in
lieu of a separate statement pursuant to CCP §2030.300(b)(2), nor would any of
these three sets of documents be considered a “concise outline” of the requests
and response in dispute.   
            The court cannot evaluate the merits
of Defendants’ request to compel further responses to their special
interrogatories due to the defective separate statement.  In fact, it is unclear what interrogatories
are at issue or if the special interrogatories were propounded by Franklin, AB
Renovations Corp. or Franklin and AB Renovations Corp.  Defendants’ May 14, 2024 Separate Statement only
lists interrogatories 1-7.  Defendants’ May
29, 2024 Separate Statement lists interrogatories 1-11, 13-23, 29, 33-34,
48-50.  Defendants’ June 6, 2024 three-volume
document list interrogatories 1-50. 
C.             
Conclusion  
Defendants’ Motion to Compel
Further Responses to Special Interrogatories (Set One) (CRS #0386) is DENIED.  
III.      Plaintiff’s
Motion to Compel Defendant Jermaine Franklin’s Further Responses to Requests
for Production (Set One) (CRS #0340 filed on 07/01/24)
            Plaintiff served each of the three Defendants
with Requests for Production (Set One) on February 9, 2024.  (Singh Declarations filed on July 1, 2024,
¶2.)  On March 12, 2024, Defendants each
served their responses to the RFPs.  (Id.
at ¶3.)  Based on a review of Plaintiff’s
separate statements in support of the motions, Defendants’ responses are
deficient and further responses are compelled. 
A.             
Legal Standard
      “[T]he demanding party may move for an
order compelling further response to the demand if the demanding party deems
that. . . (1) A statement of compliance with the demand is incomplete[,] (2) A
representation of inability to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive
[and/or that] (3) An objection in the response is without merit or too
general.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a).)
            The
moving party must demonstrate a “reasonable and good faith attempt” at an
informal resolution of each issue presented. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2016.040,
2031.310, subd. (b)(2).) “In lieu of a separate statement required under the
California Rules of Court, the court may allow the moving party to submit a
concise outline of the discovery request and each response in dispute.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (b)(3).)
A motion to compel further
responses to a demand for inspection or production of documents must “set forth
specific facts showing good cause justifying the discovery sought by the
demand.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (b)(1).) If the moving party has
shown good cause for the production of documents, the burden is on the
objecting party to justify the objections. (Kirkland
v. Superior Court (2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 92, 98.)  
            Notice of the motion must be
provided “within 45 days of the service of the verified response, or any
supplemental verified response, or on or before any specific later date to
which the demanding party and the responding party have agreed in writing . .
.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.310, subd. (c).)
“[T]he court shall impose a
monetary sanction. . . against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel further response to a
demand, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (h).)
            B.
       Discussion
            Timeliness of motion.  Defendants agreed to extend the date by which
Plaintiff would have to file a motion to compel further responses to July 1,
2024.  (Singh Dec., ¶8.)  The motions were timely filed on July 1,
2024. 
            Sufficient meet and confer
efforts.  Plaintiff’s counsel Singh
contacted Defense counsel multiple times from April 13, 2024 through June 28,
2024 regarding the deficiency of Defendants’ responses.  (Singh Dec., ¶¶4-13.)  During the meet and confer attempts, Defense
counsel stated numerous times that Defendants would serve code-compliant, further
responses but failed to do so. (Singh Dec., ¶¶5, 8, 12, Ex. 4.)  Parties’ meet and confer efforts were
sufficient.
            Separate statements comply with
CRC Rule 3.1345.  Plaintiff submits
separate statements in support of each motion. The separate statements satisfy
the requirements of CRC Rule 3.1345.
            Defendants’ responses are
defective and further responses are proper. 
Based on a review of the separate statements, Plaintiff is seeking
further responses from Defendants E7 and AB Renovations to RFP Nos. 1-160 and
from Defendant Franklin to RFP Nos. 1-73. 
            As the party moving to compel
further responses to document requests, Plaintiffs bears the initial burden of
establishing good cause to compel further responses.  (Glenfed
Develop. Corp. v. Superior Court (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 1113, 1117.) 
Plaintiff argues the RFPs are directly relevant to her allegations of
Defendants’ violation of wage-and-hour laws and FEHA.  Based on a review of the RFPs, they seek
documents directly relevant to her claims that Defendants committed violations
of the Labor Code and FEHA.
            Defendants’
responses are also patently deficient. Defendants’ objections are boilerplate
and meritless.  Defendants’ responses of
compliance, e.g. “ATTACHED” and “To the extent that his defendant has any of
these documents, they are attached,” do not satisfy the requirements of CCP
§2031.220 governing statements of compliance in full or in part.[1]  Defendants’ responses that the RFPs do not
apply, i.e. “N/A,”  are improper as they
do not fall within any of the statutorily acceptable categories of responses to
RPFs under CCP §2031.210.[2]  In addition, the RFPs seek relevant
information and are “applicable” to this action. 
            Defendants
filed a joint opposition to all three motions on July 11, 2024.  Defendants’ joint opposition maintains their
responses are sufficient, particularly given the number of RFPs served on each
of them.  Defendants attach documents and
further responses they provided in response to the meet and confer
attempts.  (Defendants’ Response to
Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Further Responses filed on July 11, 2024, Set 2,
Exs. 5 and 6.)  These further responses
do not cure the defects raised by Plaintiff. 
The responses still fail to comply with CCP §§2031.210 and 2031.220. 
            Plaintiff’s
Motions to Compel Further Responses to RFPs (Sets One) from Defendants E7, AB
Renovations and Franklin are granted. 
Defendants are ordered to serve responses in conformity with this order
within 20 days. 
            C.        Sanctions 
            Plaintiff
is entitled to sanctions as prevailing party under CCP §2031.310(h).  Plaintiff requests sanctions in the amount of
(1) $6,060 against E7 and counsel; (2) $6,060 against AB Renovations and
counsel; and (3) $4,860 against Franklin and counsel.  (7/1/24 Singh Declaration ISO MTCF from E7,
¶16; 7/1/24 Singh Declaration ISO MTCF from AB Renovations; 7/1/24 Singh
Declaration ISO MTCF from Frankline, ¶16.) 
The amounts are based on a rate of $600/hr and filing fees of $60 per
motion (10 hours on E7 and AB Renovations motions and 8 hours on Franklin’s
motions). 
            Plaintiff’s motions were
largely duplicative.  Utilizing a
Lodestar approach, and in view of the totality of the circumstances, the court
finds that the total and reasonable amount of attorney’s fees and costs
incurred for the work performed in connection with the pending motion is $1680.00
(i.e., 3 hours at $500.00/hour, plus $180.00 in filing fees). Sanctions are
payable within 30 days from the date of the notice of ruling.
D.             
Conclusion  
            Plaintiff’s (1) Motion to Compel
Further Responses to RFPs (set one) from E7; (2) Motion to Compel Further
Responses to RFPs (set one) from AB Renovations; and (3) Motion to Compel
Further Responses to RFPs (set one) from Franklin are GRANTED.  Defendants are ordered to serve verified,
code-compliant further responses within 20 days. 
            Plaintiff is awarded sanctions in
the amount of $1,680.00.  Defendants and counsel are to pay the
sanctions within 20 days.
