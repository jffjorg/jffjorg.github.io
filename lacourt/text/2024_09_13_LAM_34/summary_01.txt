And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in this case, which concerns the motions to compel further responses to discovery requests filed by the plaintiff, Mendoza. The defendants, AB Renovations Corp, Jermaine Franklin, and E7 Referrals Inc, have argued that the plaintiff's motions are premature and that their responses to the discovery requests are sufficient.

The court has denied the defendants' motions to compel further responses to the form interrogatories and demands for documents, as well as their motions to compel further responses to the special interrogatories. The court has found that the defendants failed to make a good faith attempt to resolve the issues informally and that their separate statements did not comply with the California Rules of Court.

The court has granted the plaintiff's motions to compel further responses to the requests for production (RFPs) from the defendants, and has ordered the defendants to serve verified, code-compliant further responses within 20 days. The court has also awarded the plaintiff sanctions in the amount of $1,680, which are payable within 20 days.

The court has noted that the plaintiff's motions were largely duplicative and has applied a Lodestar approach to calculate the reasonable amount of attorney's fees and costs incurred in connection with the pending motion. The court has found that the total and reasonable amount of attorney's fees and costs is $1680.00.
