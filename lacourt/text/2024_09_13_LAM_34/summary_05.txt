And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies the Defendant's motion to set aside the order and/or for reconsideration of the court's granting of the Defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings. The Plaintiff, assignee of Yellow Hope Holdings, LLC, alleges that the Defendant failed to make monthly rent payments and owes past-due rent of $65,500.00. The Defendant entered into a written residential lease agreement to pay $18,500.00 per month until May 31, 2024. The Plaintiff served the Defendant with notice to vacate or pay rent on February 21, 2024, but the Defendant has failed to comply. The Judge finds that the Plaintiff's counsel's mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect is not demonstrated and therefore refuses to grant the motion under Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b). The Judge also finds that the Plaintiff does not provide new or different facts, circumstances, or law to suggest that section 1008(a) is applicable.
