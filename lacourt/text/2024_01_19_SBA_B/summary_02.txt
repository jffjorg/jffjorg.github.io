And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has granted the defendants' motions to compel further responses from the plaintiff to their discovery requests. The plaintiff was required to respond to the defendants' interrogatories and requests for production of documents, but he failed to do so in a timely manner. The defendants served a motion to compel further responses, and the plaintiff's objections were found to be lacking in merit. The judge ordered the plaintiff to respond further without objections to the defendants' discovery requests within 30 days.
