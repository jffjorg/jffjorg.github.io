LEGAL AUTHORITY When considering demurrers, courts  read the allegations liberally and in context.   Taylor v. City of Los Angeles  Dept. of Water and Power (2006) 144 Cal. App. 4th 1216, 1228.  “A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not  the evidence or other extrinsic matters.   Therefore, it lies only where the defects appear on the face of the  pleading or are judicially noticed.”  SKF Farms v. Superior Court (1984) 153  Cal. App. 3d 902, 905.  “The only issue  involved in a demurrer hearing is whether the complaint, as it stands,  unconnected with extraneous matters, states a cause of action.”  Hahn v.  Mirda (2007) 147 Cal. App. 4th 740, 747. DISCUSSION Defendant Chris Hoang Le d/b/a The  Electrician demurs to the entire complaint and each cause of action on the  grounds that they fail to state sufficient allegations to constitute a cause of  action and that plaintiff lacks standing. The complaint alleges that on  November 9, 2022, plaintiff contacted defendant in regard to defendant’s  roofing services.  Defendant represented  that he possessed a California Roofing License and was qualified to perform  services in the city of Redondo Beach.   He also represented that he possessed the requisite skill and experience  to lay a new roof on plaintiff’s commercial property located at 2205 Artesia  Blvd., Redondo Beach.  Complaint, ¶10.  On November 18, 2022, plaintiff contracted  defendant to lay a new roof in exchange for $39,000, with $25,000 to be paid up  front.  The parties agreed that the new  roof would be completed in two weeks and that defendant’s performance would  commenced immediately after the appropriate roofing permits were issued by the  City of Redondo Beach.  Defendant  asserted all payments made by plaintiff were to be made out to “Timber and  Steel.”  Id., ¶11.  On November 21, 2022, defendant arrived at  plaintiff’s property and began preparations.   After preliminary preparations were complete, defendant stated that he  would return after permits were issued by the City.  Id., ¶12.    The complaint further alleges that  on January 10, 2023, defendant told plaintiff that he was on his way to pick up  the permits.  Defendant then told  plaintiff the City had actually mailed the permit to defendant and that  defendant would begin performance once the permit was received.  Id., ¶13.   On February 21, 2023, defendant told plaintiff that he was in possession  of the permit and would being performance immediately; however, the cost of the  roof had increased from $39,000 to $42,350.   Defendant told plaintiff that he required another $10,000 from  plaintiff.  Plaintiff issued a check to  defendant for $10,000.  Id., ¶14.  On March 31, 2023, defendant asked plaintiff  for $4000 to purchase additional material for the roof.  Plaintiff complied and issued a check to  defendant.  Id., ¶15.  On April 17, 2023, defendant told plaintiff  that the cost of the new roof increased to $55,954.03 due to unforeseen cost  and asked plaintiff for $7000, which plaintiff complied.  Id., ¶16.   On April 21, 2023, the City conducted an inspection of the property and  requested to see the roofing permit issued to defendant.  It was at this time that plaintiff discovered  that defendant did not have a roofing license and was not in possession of a  permit as defendant had represented.   Id., ¶17.  The City informed  plaintiff that defendant must immediately cease roofing.  Defendant completely disappeared, abandoned  the project, and ignored plaintiff’s requests for reimbursement.  Id., ¶18.   On April 28, 2023, plaintiff hired Super Dry Restoration to finish the  project.  Super Dry found numerous errors  and costly mistakes in defendant’s performance.   Plaintiff also discovered that defendant was attempting to perform in  accordance with the 2022 roofing code, but that the code had changed and Super  Dry was required to perform under the updated 2023 code.  Super Dry was required to perform additional  service of stripping away all of defendant’s work and to start from  scratch.  Plaintiff’s total cost for  repairing defendant’s defective performance, fixing the damaged electrical  panel, and laying a new roof was $93,145.   Id., ¶19. Defendant argues that plaintiff  lacks standing because he did not comply with the mediation clause set forth on  page 2 of 2 of Invoice #2242, and asserts that the complaint only attached page  1 of the invoice.  Defendant contends  that the mediation clause states:   “Mediation.  If a dispute arises,  between or among the Parties, and it is not resolved prior to or after  recording, the Parties shall first proceed in good faith to submit the matter  to mediation.  Costs related to mediation  shall be mutually shared between or among the Parties.” The court rules as follows:  The purported page 2 is outside the pleadings  and is not subject to judicial notice.   Defendant does not address whether  any of the causes of action state a cause of action.  In any event, it appears that plaintiff has  standing as he is the real party in interest.   “Every action must be prosecuted in the name of the real party in  interest, except as otherwise provided by statute.”  CCP §367.   Defendant cites to no law whereby a plaintiff’s failure to mediate based  on a mediation clause on an invoice before filing a complaint results in  plaintiff’s lack of standing.  Further,  defendant has not shown that complying with a mediation clause is an element of  any of the causes of action. ORDER:  The demurrer is OVERRULED. Defendant is ordered to give notice  of ruling.
