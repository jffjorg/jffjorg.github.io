And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the demurrer filed by Defendant Chris Hoang Le is OVERRULED. The complaint filed by Plaintiff Feras Adamo alleges that Defendant failed to perform services as agreed upon, including laying a new roof on Plaintiff's commercial property. Defendant represented that he possessed a California Roofing License and was qualified to perform services in Redondo Beach, but Plaintiff discovered that Defendant did not have a roofing license and was not in possession of a permit as represented. Defendant abandoned the project and ignored Plaintiff's requests for reimbursement. Plaintiff hired Super Dry Restoration to finish the project and incurred additional costs of $93,145.

The Judge rules that Plaintiff has standing to bring the action, despite Defendant's argument that Plaintiff failed to comply with the mediation clause on page 2 of Invoice #2242. The Judge also finds that the complaint states a cause of action and that Defendant's demurrer is without merit. The Judge orders that Defendant give notice of the ruling.
