            The request
for judicial notice of Exhibit 1 is granted. (Evid. Code, § 452, subd. (d).)
 
Legal Standard for
Demurrers
 
A demurrer is an objection to a
pleading, the grounds for which are apparent from either the face of the
complaint or a matter of which the court may take judicial notice. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 430.30, subd. (a); see also Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39
Cal.3d 311, 318.) The purpose of a demurrer is to challenge the
sufficiency of a pleading “by raising questions of law.” (Postley v.
Harvey (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 280, 286.) “In the construction of a
pleading, for the purpose of determining its effect, its allegations must be
liberally construed, with a view to substantial justice between the parties.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 452.) The court “ ‘ “treat[s] the demurrer as
admitting all material facts properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions
or conclusions of fact or law . . . .” ’ ”  (Berkley v. Dowds
(2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 518, 525.) In applying these standards, the court
liberally construes the complaint to determine whether a cause of action has
been stated. (Picton v. Anderson Union High School Dist. (1996) 50
Cal.App.4th 726, 733.)
 
Discussion

 
Bankruptcy
 
Defendant demurs to the first and
second causes of action in the First Amended Complaint on the grounds of Plaintiff
is currently engaged in a Chapter 13 bankruptcy proceeding. (RJN Ex. 1.) As
such, she lacks standing to assert a claim for relief under the HBOR.
 
Civil Code section
2924.12, the statute authorizing a cause of action for violation of sections
2923.6 and 2923.7, applies only to a “borrower.” The definition of a “borrower”
under the HBOR excludes an individual who has filed for bankruptcy if “the
bankruptcy court has not entered an order closing or dismissing the bankruptcy
case, or granting relief from a stay of foreclosure.” (Civ. Code, § 2920.5,
subd. (c)(2)(C); see Civ. Code, § 2920.5, subd. (c)(1).)
 
On April 29, 2024, Plaintiff filed a
petition for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection. (RJN Ex. 1.) The FAC alleges underlying
misconduct from March 23, 2023 to April 24, 2024. (FAC ¶¶ 18-33.) Thus, according
to the pleadings, Plaintiff was a “borrower” as defined by statute during the all
the relevant periods of the HBOR violation.
 
Contrary to the reply, what is critical to determining a
violation of HBOR is whether Plaintiff was a borrower at the time of the
alleged violations, not currently. (See Morris v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (2022) 78
Cal.App.5th 279, 297-299 [wrongful acts while plaintiff was not in active
bankruptcy proceedings did not disqualify plaintiff from being a “borrower”].) Thus, Plaintiff
was a “borrower” during the time she alleges that Defendant committed
misconduct against her, which was before she filed for bankruptcy protection.
She is not subject to Civil Code section 2920.5, subdivision (c)(2)(C).
 
The demurrer on this ground is
overruled. 
 
First Cause of Action for Violations of California Civil
Code Section 2923.6:
 
California
Civil Code section 2923.6 prohibits “dual tracking,” whereby a lender proceeds
with the foreclosure process while reviewing a loan modification application. (Civ.
Code § 2923.6, subd. (c).)
 
Defendant
demurs to this cause of action on the grounds that Plaintiff has failed to
state a claim because she has failed to allege facts showing her application
for a loan modification was “complete.” Specifically, FAC alleges that Defendant requested additional
documentation from Plaintiff on April 5, 2024, which she provided on April 11,
2024. (FAC, ¶ 30.) Plaintiff does not allege that Defendant “record[ed] a
notice of default or notice of sale or conduct a trustee’s sale” after April
11, 2024. Based on these allegations, Defendant argues that Plaintiff’s loan
modification application was not complete. 
 
Plaintiff argues that this is not
the law, citing Mace v. Ocwen Loan Servicing, LLC (N.D. Cal.
2017) 252 F.Supp.3d 941. Mace is persuasive. 
 
In Mace, the court considered
almost identical allegations to the allegations alleged by Plaintiff here. The
court found such allegations were sufficient to state a claim, explaining: 
 
“The statute
defines completeness by when the borrower has supplied the required documents
to the mortgage servicer, not when the mortgage servicer completes its review
and acknowledges that no further documents are required. The statutory language
does not permit a mortgage servicer to create a moving target so borrowers have
no way of knowing whether a loan modification application is complete until the
mortgage servicer tells them so.” (Id.  at 946.) 
 
The court in
Mace further explained that “a mortgage servicer must tell the borrowers
in advance what documents are required and specify reasonable timeframes for
the submission of those documents.” (Id. at 947.) Similarly, the court
in Mackovska v. Bank of America, N.A. (C.D. Cal., Apr. 2, 2019, No.
CV181666DOCJDEX) 2019 WL 4137609 found the reasoning in Mace  persuasive and noted that “Defendant's
construction of § 2924.11(f) would allow servicers to evade the HBOR’s
prohibition on “dual-[tr]acking,” simply by collecting documents from
applicants in a piecemeal manner in order to prevent those applications from
becoming complete while the servicer pursues foreclosure proceedings.” (Id.
at *4.)
 
Defendant
does not address either of these cases. The allegations allege a material[1]
violation of Civil Code section 2923.6. The demurrer on this ground is
overruled.
 
Second Cause of Action for Violations of California Civil
Code Section 2923.7:
 
            California
Civil Code section 2923.7, subdivision (a), provides that, “[w]hen a borrower
requests a foreclosure prevention alternative, the mortgage servicer shall
promptly establish a single point of contact.”
 
            Defendant
demurs to this cause of action on the grounds that – although Plaintiff claims
that Defendant violated section 2923.7 – the FAC fails to allege any of the specific
statutory duties under Section 2923.7, subdivision (b), that went unfulfilled.
 
            But the FAC
alleges that Defendant violated Section 2923.7, subdivision (b), by failing to
provide Plaintiff with a single point of contact (SPOC) who could fulfill all
their statutory duties. Specifically, Plaintiff avers that the SPOC failed to
coordinate the receipt of all documents associated with available foreclosure
prevention alternatives and notify the borrower of any missing documents
necessary to complete the application. (FAC ¶¶ 46-47.) 
 
            These allegations
are sufficient to allege a material violation under Section 2923.7. (See Morris v.
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (2022) 78 Cal.App.5th 279, 302.) The demurrer on this
ground is overruled.
 
Fourth Cause of Action for Violations of Cal. Business &
Professions Code section 17200:
 
 “Virtually any state, federal, or local law
can serve as the predicate” for a UCL claim. (Durell v. Sharp Healthcare
(2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 1350, 1361.) Defendant’s demurrer to Plaintiff's UCL
claim is premised, in part, on the failure of Plaintiff's HBOR claim as a
predicate. Because the Court overruled Defendant’s demurrer to Plaintiff's HBOR
claims, it also overrules Defendant’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s UCL claim on this
ground.
 
However, Business
and Professions Code section 17204 restricts private standing to bring a UCL
action to “a person who has suffered injury in fact and has lost money or
property as a result of the unfair competition.” To satisfy the standing
requirement, a plaintiff must “(1) establish a loss or deprivation of money or
property sufficient to qualify as injury in fact, i.e., economic injury,
and (2) show that that economic injury was the result of, i.e., caused by,
the unfair business practice or false advertising that is the gravamen of the
claim.” (Kwikset Corp. v. Superior Court (2011) 51 Cal.4th 310, 322.)


Here, the
FAC fails to allege an economic injury. The only concrete economic injury
identified by Plaintiff is her “costs and attorney fees to bring this action” and “incurred
penalties and interest on back dues.” (Opp., 12:1-10.)
 
However, costs and attorney fees are
insufficient. (In re Google Inc. Street View Electronic Communications Litigation
(N.D. Cal. 2011) 794 F.Supp.2d 1067, 1086 [treating attorney fees as a loss of
money or property would “effectively eviscerate the heightened standing
requirements”.].) Moreover, no economic injury arises under the UCL merely
because interest, penalties, and fees continue to accumulate as a result of Plaintiff’s
default. (Shupe v. Nationstar Mortgage LLC (E.D. Cal. 2017) 231
F.Supp.3d 597, 605-606.)
 
Finally, no
foreclosure sale has occurred. Plaintiff still has her home and her money
because she does not allege that she tendered the debt. A borrower’s potential
loss does not create a UCL claim because “his prospect of losing the home to
foreclosure is the result of default, not the alleged conduct of defendants.” (Graham
v. Bank of America (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 594, 614.)
 
The demurrer
to this cause of action is sustained with leave to amend. 
 
Conclusion
 
The demurrer
to the First Amended Complaint is overruled as to
the first and second cause of action and sustained as to the fourth cause of
action.
Plaintiff shall have leave to amend. Plaintiff’s amended complaint shall be
served and filed on or before December 16, 2024.
