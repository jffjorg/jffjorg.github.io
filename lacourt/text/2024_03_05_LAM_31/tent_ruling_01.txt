DEMURRER
WITH MOTION TO STRIKE



 
MOVING PARTY:               Defendant
California Automobile Insurance Company
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     Plaintiffs John
and Polly Castillo
 
 
I.          BACKGROUND
 
            This is a bad faith breach of insurance coverage action.  On August 2, 2023, Plaintiffs John and Polly
Castillo (Plaintiffs), filed a Complaint against Defendant California Automobile
Insurance Company (CAIC) for (1) Breach of the Contractual Duty to Pay a
Covered Claim, (2) Breach of the Duty of Good Faith and Fair Dealing, and (3) Violation
of Business and Professions Code section 17200. 
A copy of the policy is not attached to the Complaint.  
 
According to the Complaint, Plaintiffs lost their home in a
fire.  At that time, Plaintiffs were
insured under a CAIC-issued homeowners insurance policy.  Pursuant to the policy, Plaintiffs submitted
a claim for the resulting losses.  CAIC
did not approve the claim.  Rather, CAIC falsely
accused Plaintiffs of fraud and misrepresentation.  CAIC devoted two and a half years trying to
support the unfounded claim, subjecting Plaintiffs to multiple examinations
under oath and requiring Plaintiffs to produce immaterial documents.  CAIC did not discover anything that would
justify denying Plaintiffs’ claim in good faith.  Nonetheless, CAIC denied the claim.  CAIC sent a denial letter.  The sole reason given supporting the denial
was that Plaintiffs had sought undue additional living expense (ALE) payments
by misrepresenting details, including dates and amounts paid, for stays at
short-term rental properties.  The denial
letter is attached to the Complaint. Plaintiffs seek damages, including
punitive damages, and injunctive relief, among other relief.
 
            On September
25, 2023, CAIC filed a demurrer to each cause of action and concurrently filed
a motion to strike the punitive damages allegations from the Complaint.
 
            Plaintiff
filed an opposition.  CAIC replied.
 
II.        DISCUSSION RE DEMURRER  
 
A.  Legal Standard 
 
A demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the pleadings and
will be sustained only where the pleading is defective on its face.  (City
of Atascadero v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc. (1998) 68
Cal.App.4th 445, 459.)  “We treat the demurrer as admitting all material
facts properly pleaded but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact
or law.  We accept the factual allegations of the complaint as true and also consider
matters which may be judicially noticed.  [Citation.]”  (Mitchell
v. California Department of Public Health (2016) 1 Cal.App.5th 1000, 1007; Del
E. Webb Corp. v. Structural Materials Co. (1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 593, 604 (Del
E. Webb Corp.) [“the facts alleged in the pleading are deemed to be true, however
improbable they may be”].) Allegations are to be liberally construed. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 452.) In construing the allegations, the court is to give
effect to specific factual allegations that may modify or limit inconsistent
general or conclusory allegations.  (Financial Corporation of America
v. Wilburn (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 764, 769.)   
 
A demurrer may be brought if insufficient facts are stated
to support the cause of action asserted. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd.
(e).) “A demurrer for uncertainty is strictly construed, even where a
complaint is in some respects uncertain, because ambiguities can be clarified
under modern discovery procedures.” (Khoury v. Maly’s of California, Inc.
(1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.)   


Leave to amend must be allowed where there is a reasonable
possibility of successful amendment.  (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18
Cal.3d 335, 348.)  The burden is on the complainant to show the Court that
a pleading can be amended successfully. 
(Ibid.)  
 
            B.  Application 
 
Meet and Confer
 
“Before filing a demurrer pursuant to this chapter, the
demurring party shall meet and confer in person, by telephone, or by video
conference with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer
for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would
resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §
430.41, subd. (a).)¿ Defense counsel has not complied with the meet and confer
requirement. (See Declaration of Mary H. Kim, ¶¶ 3-4.)  The parties exchanged
emails.  However, “[a] determination by
the court that the meet and confer process was insufficient shall not be
grounds to overrule or sustain a demurrer.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd.
(a)(4).)¿¿Accordingly, the court exercises its discretion to consider the
merits of the demurrer.  
 
Analysis  
 
Defendants argue each
cause of action fails on the grounds they are uncertain and lack sufficient
allegations to establish a cause of action. The court addresses each cause of action
in turn.
 
1.     
First Cause of Action for Breach of the Contractual
Duty to Pay a Covered Claim
 
The elements of a
breach of contract cause of action are: (1) the existence of a valid contract
between the plaintiff and the defendant, (2) the plaintiff’s performance, (3)
the defendant’s unjustified failure to perform, and (4) damages to the
plaintiff caused by the defendant’s breach.  (CACI No. 303; Careau & Co. v. Security
Pacific Business, Inc. (1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 1371, 1388 (Careau); Otworth
v. Southern Pac. Transportation (1985) 166 Cal.App.3d 452, 458.)   In an action founded upon a
contract, the complaint must indicate whether the contract is written,
oral, or implied by conduct. (Code Civ. Proc., 430.10, subd. (g).)  “In an action based on a written contract, a
plaintiff may plead the legal effect of the contract rather than its precise
language.” (Construction Protective Services, Inc. v. TIG Specialty Ins. Co.
(2002) 29 Cal.4th 189, 198–199.) 
 
CAIC argues the
First Cause of Action fails because the written policy between Plaintiffs and
CAIC is not attached to the Complaint, nor are the terms of the policy set out
verbatim in the body of the Complaint. 
Further, Plaintiffs have not alleged the legal effect of the
policy.  
 
There is no dispute
the policy is not attached to the Complaint nor that the policy terms are not alleged
verbatim.  However, as to the legal
effect of the policy, CAIC’s argument lacks merit.  The allegations allege that Plaintiffs lost
their home in a fire and damage to Plaintiffs’ home due to a fire is a covered
loss.  The policy provides basic coverage limits for the dwelling, other
structures, personal property, and loss of use.  As alleged, Plaintiffs’ insurance claim should
have been approved because they suffered a covered loss.  Also as alleged,
CAIC did not uncover any evidence showing Plaintiffs’ claim was
fraudulent.  CAIC breached the policy by
not providing coverage for a valid claim.  (See Complaint, ¶¶ 9-13, 16-20,
28-31.)  Moreover, the denial letter sets
forth the relevant terms of the policy and its legal effect.  (Complaint, Ex. 1.)  The First Cause of Action is sufficiently pleaded.
 
2.     
Second Cause of Action for Breach of the Duty of Good
Faith and Fair Dealing
 
To allege a cause
of action for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,
plaintiff must allege the following elements: (1) plaintiff and defendant
entered into a contract; (2) plaintiff did all, or substantially all, of the
significant things that the contract required him to do, or that he was excused
from having to do those things; (3) all conditions required for defendant’s
performance had occurred, or were excused; (4) defendant engaged in specified
conduct that plaintiff claims prevented plaintiff from receiving the benefits
under the contract; (5) that by doing so, defendant did not act fairly and in
good faith; and (6) plaintiff was harmed by defendant’s conduct.¿ (CACI No.
325.)¿¿ 
 
CAIC argues the
Second Cause of Action fails because the allegations fail to establish how CAIC
frustrated Plaintiffs’ rights to the benefits of the policy.  This argument lacks merit.   As alleged, Plaintiffs used a public adjuster
to ensure their claim was submitted reliably and professionally.  Plaintiffs complied with every aspect of
CAIC’s two-year investigation and made no attempts to receive any more money
that was due under their ALE coverage.  Yet
CAIC’s efforts were centered on supporting a pre-determined claim denial. The
denial letter  accused Plaintiffs of
criminal behavior – insurance fraud.  According
to Plaintiffs, CAIC also misstated the statute of limitations in which to be bring
a breach of contract action against an insurer.  (See Complaint, ¶¶ 15, 20-25, 33.)  The Second Cause of Action is sufficiently
pleaded.
 
3.  Third Cause
of Action for Violation of Business and Professions Code Section 17200
 
The Unfair
Competition Law (UCL) is codified at Business and Professions Code section
17200 et seq.¿ Section 17204 of the UCL provides that a private person “who has
suffered injury in fact and has lost money or property as a result of the
unfair competition” may bring a 17200 action.¿ (Bus. & Prof. Code, §
17204.)¿ “To bring a UCL claim, a plaintiff must show either an (1) unlawful,
unfair, or fraudulent business act or practice, or (2) unfair, deceptive,
untrue or misleading advertising. [Citation.]¿ Because the UCL is written in
the disjunctive, it establishes three varieties of unfair competition—acts or
practices which are unlawful, or unfair, or fraudulent.”¿ (Adhav v. Midway
Rent A Car, Inc. (2019) 37 Cal.App.5th 954, 970, citations and quotations
omitted.)¿ “In an action against an insurer, the essential allegations to plead
a claim for violation of the UCL include:
 
·        
plaintiff's
status as an insured or intended beneficiary of the insurer's policy;
·        
the
existence of that policy;
·        
the
insurer’s conduct and that such conduct was an “unfair, unlawful or fraudulent”
business practice in violation of section 17200;
·        
plaintiff
sustained injury and/or loss of money or property as a result of the insured's
“unfair, unlawful or fraudulent” business practice;
·        
plaintiff
has no adequate remedy at law;
·        
a
request for injunctive relief and/or restitution (again, monetary damages are
not recoverable under the UCL; see ¶ 15:110); and
·        
a
request for attorney fees.”
 
(Croskey,
Heeseman, Ehrlich, and Klee, Cal Prac. Guide: Insurance Litigation (The Rutter
Group 2023) ¶ 15.112.) 
 
             CAIC demurs to the UCL claim on the grounds
there are no facts to indicate how Plaintiffs’ allegations operate as an unfair
business practice or how the alleged unfair competition entitles Plaintiffs to
an injunction.  Not so.  The Complaint alleges CAIC’s conduct of
systematically denying fire insurance claims by falsely accusing its insured of
making misrepresentations for the sole purpose of denying the claim and saving
money constitutes unfair competition. 
CAIC’s misrepresentation of the term for bringing legal action against
CAIC is unfair and fraudulent conduct within the meaning of the UCL.  (See Complaint, ¶¶ 40, 41.)  Plaintiffs also seek injunctive relief.  (See Complaint, ¶ 39.)   Further, allegations of bad faith practices
are sufficient to support a claim of unlawful business practices.  (Zhang v. Super. Ct. (2013) 57 Cal.4th
364, 380, 383.)  As discussed above, the
Complaint sets forth sufficient allegations of CAIC’s bad faith conduct.  CAIC’s demurrer again misses the mark.  The Third Cause of Action is sufficiently pleaded.
 
III.       DISCUSSION RE MOTION TO STRIKE
 
CAIC seeks an order striking punitive damages allegations
and the prayer for attorney fees.  
 
A.    
 Legal
Standard  
 
Any party, within the time allowed to respond to a pleading,
may serve and file a motion to strike the whole pleading or any part thereof.¿
(Code Civ. Proc., § 435, subd. (b)(1); Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1322, subd.
(b).)¿ On a motion to strike, the court may: (1) strike out any irrelevant,
false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading; or (2) strike out all or
any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of
California, a court rule, or an order of the court.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 436,
subds. (a)-(b); Stafford v. Shultz (1954) 42 Cal.2d 767, 782.)¿¿¿ 
 
“The grounds for a motion to strike are limited to matters
appearing on the face of the challenged pleading or matters which must or may
be judicially noticed. (§ 437, subd. (a); Evid. Code, §§ 451, 452.).” (Garcia
v. Sterling (1985) 176 Cal.App.3d 17, 20.) 
 
A motion to strike punitive damages is properly granted
where a plaintiff does not state a prima facie claim for punitive damages,
including allegations that defendant is guilty of oppression, fraud or malice.¿
(Turman v. Turning Point of Cent. California, Inc. (2010) 191
Cal.App.4th 53, 63.)¿ “Mere negligence, even gross negligence, is not
sufficient to justify such an award” for punitive damages.¿ (Kendall Yacht
Corp. v. United California Bank (1975) 50 Cal.App.3d 949, 958.)¿ The
allegations supporting a request for punitive damages must be alleged with
specificity; conclusory allegations without sufficient facts are not enough.¿ (Smith
v. Superior Court (1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 1033, 1041-1042.)¿ 
 
B.    
Application  
 
Punitive Damages
 
An insured may be entitled to recover punitive damages in an
insurance bad faith action if the insured can prove by clear and convincing
evidence that the insurer not only denied or delayed the payment of policy
benefits unreasonably or without proper cause, but, in doing so, was guilty of
malice, oppression or fraud.  (Jordan
v, Allstate Ins. Co. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 1062, 1080.)  
 
Here, the Complaint alleges CAIC’s conduct was despicable
and carried on with a willful and conscious disregard of Plaintiffs’ rights and
constituted malice, oppression, or fraud. 
CAIC’s conduct was undertaken by its corporate officers or managing
agents, who were responsible for claim supervision and operations,
underwriting, communications and decisions. 
(See Complaint, ¶¶ 36, 37.)  Given
the court’s finding that the Complaint adequately alleges CAIC’s breach of the home
insurance policy, the court further finds the allegations sufficiently plead a
basis for punitive damages.  Accordingly, the motion to strike punitive
damages is DENIED. 
 
Attorney Fees
 
Plaintiffs’ request for attorney fees is based on CAIC’s bad
faith conduct and UCL claim.  
 
As observed in Jordan v. Allstate Ins. Co. (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 1062, attorney fees may be recoverable in a bad faith insurance
action pursuant to Brandt v. Superior Court (1985) 37 Cal.3d 813.  The Jordan court stated as follows:
 
“Normally,
each party to a civil action must bear his or her own legal fees (Code of Civ.
Proc., § 1021). However, fees reasonably incurred by an insured to compel
payment of benefits due under an insurance policy, as distinguished from fees
attributable to proving the insurer's “bad faith, are recoverable as damages in
a bad faith action against the insurer. (Brandt v. Superior Court (1985)
37 Cal.3d 813, 817, 210 Cal.Rptr. 211, 693 P.2d 796; Cassim v. Allstate Ins.
Co. (2004) 33 Cal.4th 780, 806, 16 Cal.Rptr.3d 374, 94 P.3d 513.) The
insured is entitled to recover all policy benefits unreasonably withheld
“undiminished by the expenses incurred in retaining an attorney to recover
under the policy.” (Essex Ins. Co. v. Five Star Dye House, Inc. (2006)
38 Cal.4th 1252, 1258, 45 Cal.Rptr.3d 362, 137 P.3d 192.)
 
In
order to recover such Brandt fees, however, the insured is required to
plead and prove (1) the amount to which the insured was entitled to recover
under the policy, (2) that the insurer withheld payment unreasonably or without
proper cause; (3) the amount that the insured paid or incurred in legal fees
and expenses in establishing the insured's right to contract benefits and (4)
the reasonableness of the fees and expenses so incurred. The important caveat
to this award of fees, which we emphasize, is that they “may not exceed the
amount attributable to the attorney's efforts to obtain the rejected payment
due on the insurance contract.” (Brandt v. Superior Court, supra, 37
Cal.3d at p. 819, 210 Cal.Rptr. 211, 693 P.2d 796.)”
 
(Jordan, at p. 1079, footnotes omitted.)
 
            Here, the
court finds the Complaint sufficiently pleads recovery of Brandt fees.  Attorney fees may be recovered in a bad faith
action.  CAIC appears to concede as
much.  (See Reply, p. 2:28.)  The motion to strike attorney fees in
connection with the Second Cause of Action is therefore DENIED. 
 
            As to the
UCL claim, the parties cite dueling authority for the recovery of attorney fees.  “[U]nder the UCL, prevailing plaintiffs are
generally limited to injunctive relief and restitution.”  (Korea Supply Co. v. Lockheed Martin Corp.
(2003) 29 Cal.4th 1134, 1144.)  “[T]he
fact that attorney fees and damages, including punitive damages, are not available
under the UCL is clear evidence that deterrence by means of monetary penalties
is not the act’s sole objective.”  (Id.
at p. 1148.)  However, “If a
plaintiff prevails in an unfair competition law claim, it may seek attorney
fees as a private attorney general pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
1021.5.” (Walker v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc. (2002) 98 Cal.App.4th
1158, 1179.)
 
            Under Walker,
attorney fees may be recovered for a UCL claim. 
But as Plaintiffs concede, they did not allege the applicable authority,
or that they sought attorney fees as a private attorney general.  For this reason, the motion to strike Paragraph
48 and paragraph f of the prayer for relief is GRANTED.

IV.       CONCLUSION
            
The demurrer is OVERRULED. 
The motion to strike punitive damages allegations and attorney fees in
connection with the Second Cause of Action is DENIED.  The motion to strike attorney fees in
connection with the Third Cause of Action is GRANTED.  Leave to amend is GRANTED.
 
Plaintiffs are to file and serve the First Amended Complaint
within 15 days of this order.
 
Plaintiffs to give notice.
