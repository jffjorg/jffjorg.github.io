[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTION FOR EXTENSION
  OF TIME TO FILE ATTORNEY FEE MOTION AND COST MEMORANDUM
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
April 30, 2024



 
On October 26, 2023, the Court
entered judgment in favor of Plaintiff Aaron Meyerson and against Defendant Verb
Technology Company, Inc.
On
February 23, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Motion for Extension of Time to File Attorney
Fee Motion and Cost Memorandum.  Plaintiff
seeks relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b) and the
Rules of Court.
A
memorandum of costs must be filed on or before the earliest of (A) 15 days after
a written Notice of Entry of Judgment, or (B) or within 180 days after entry of
judgment.  (California Rules of Court, rule
3.1700(a)(1).)
A
motion for attorney fees must be served within the time for filing a notice of appeal.  (California Rules of Court, rule 3.1702(b)(1).)  A notice of appeal must be filed on or before
the earliest of (A) 60 days after the clerk serves a Notice of Entry of Judgment
on the appealing party, (B) 60 days after the appealing party serves or is served
with a Notice of Entry of Judgment, or (C) 180 days after entry of judgment.  (California Rules of Court, rule 8.104(a)(1).)
The
Court entered judgment on October 26, 2023. 
Plaintiff served a Notice of Entry of Judgment on Defendant on November 8,
2023.  Accordingly, a memorandum of costs
must have been filed by November 23, 2023. 
A motion for attorney fees must have been filed by January 7, 2024.
“In
the absence of prejudice, the trial court has broad discretion in allowing relief
on grounds of inadvertence from a failure to timely file a cost bill.”  (Pollard v. Saxe & Yolles Dev. Co.
(1974) 12 Cal.3d 374, 381.)  Similarly, “[f]or
good cause, the trial judge may extend the time for filing a motion for attorney’s
fees in the absence of a stipulation or for a longer period than allowed by stipulation.”  (California Rules of Court, rule 3.1702(d).)  “A court may grant a request for extension of
time to file a motion for attorney’s fees even if the motion is not filed until
after the deadline for filing an attorney’s fees motion under Rule 3.1702.  [Citation.] 
Even a claim of inadvertence, if it is not prejudicial, may constitute good
cause for a late filing.  [Citation.]”  (Robinson v. U-Haul Co. of California (2016)
4 Cal.App.5th 304, 326.)
Plaintiff’s
counsel declares that he reviewed the rules and law concerning the deadlines for
filing the motion for attorney fees and costs, but in an isolated clerical error,
he “inadvertently calendared the deadline at 180 days, for May 6, 2024.”  (Todd Decl. ¶ 3.)  He discovered his calendar error when Defendant
stated that the motion served on February 13, 2024 was untimely.  (Todd Decl. ¶ 4.)  The motion includes proposed copies of both the
motion for attorney fees and memorandum of costs.  (Motion, Exs. B-C; see Code Civ. Proc., § 473,
subd. (b).)
Defendant
argues that Plaintiff has not shown good cause. 
The Court disagrees.  Furthermore,
Defendant does not identify any prejudice caused by the late filing.
The
Motion for Extension of Time to File Attorney Fee Motion and Cost Memorandum is
GRANTED.  Plaintiff is ordered to file his
motion for attorney fees and memorandum of costs within five days.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
