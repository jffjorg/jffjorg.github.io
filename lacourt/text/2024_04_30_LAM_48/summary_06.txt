And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the defendants. The demurrer is overruled on three grounds: (1) the small claims action does not bar this action, (2) the first amended complaint clearly alleges a written contract, and (3) Plaintiff may seek restitution. The motion to strike is denied. The defendants are ordered to file an answer within 10 days. The case will proceed as scheduled unless all parties indicate that they will submit to the tentative ruling.
