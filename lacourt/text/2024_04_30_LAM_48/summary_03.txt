And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for an order to show cause (OSC) regarding contempt and has also denied the request for entry of default judgment. The judge ruled that the plaintiff did not personally serve the defendant with the contempt papers, therefore, the court lacks jurisdiction. The judge also found that the plaintiff's request for default judgment suffered from multiple deficiencies, including the fact that the plaintiff's claimed damages were speculative and did not meet the requirements of the law. The judge also noted that some of the plaintiff's claimed damages were for loss of earnings, which is not a recoverable amount. The judge further ruled that the plaintiff's claims against Long Spring Freight LLC are still pending, and therefore, the court cannot enter a default judgment against that defendant. The judge also advanced the Order to Show Cause Re: Dismissal for Failure to Enter Default Judgment as to Defendant A&D Hauling Services to the same date as the OSC.
