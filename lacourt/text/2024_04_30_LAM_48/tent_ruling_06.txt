[TENTATIVE] ORDER OVERRULING DEMURRER;
  DENYING MOTION TO STRIKE
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
April 30, 2024



 
On June 12, 2023, Plaintiff
2633 Manning Cheviot Hills LLC filed this action against Defendants Chase N’
Properties Inc. and Cassandra Chase, and on August 3, 2023, it filed a first
amended complaint (“FAC”).
On
November 13, 2023, Defendants filed a demurrer, and on November 15, 2023, they
filed a motion to strike.
REQUEST
FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
Defendants
ask the Court to take judicial notice of the records of 2633 Manning Cheviot
Hills LLC v. Cassandra Chase and Chase N’ Properties Inc. (Case No.
19LBSC03130).  The request is granted.
Plaintiff
asks the Court to take judicial notice of an executed version of the Joint
Venture Agreement.  Because the complaint
refers to this agreement, it is an appropriate matter for judicial notice.  (Align Technology, Inc. v. Tran (2009)
179 Cal.App.4th 949, 956 fn. 6.)  
DEMURRER
A
demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action.  (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740,
747.)  When considering demurrers, courts
read the allegations liberally and in context, accepting the alleged facts as true.  (Nolte v. Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (2015)
236 Cal.App.4th 1401, 1406.)  “Because a demurrer
challenges defects on the face of the complaint, it can only refer to matters outside
the pleading that are subject to judicial notice.”  (Arce ex rel. Arce v. Kaiser Found. Health
Plan, Inc. (2010) 181 Cal.App.4th 471, 556.)
A.        The Small Claims Action Does Not Bar
This Action.
Defendants
argue that Plaintiff has already asserted the same claims in a small claims
court action, which was dismissed with prejudice on November 6, 2020.  (Demurrer at p. 10.)  On September 30, 2019, Plaintiff filed a
small claims action against Cassandra Chase. 
Plaintiff alleged that Chase owed $6,000 because “[defendant] borrowed
money from me and has not repaid it.  I
have asked repeatedly. . . . 6/15/18 she borrowed the $. . . . It’s in writing
she is supposed to pay me every month to pay this money.”  At the non-jury trial on November 6, 2020,
Plaintiff did not appear, and the action was dismissed with prejudice.
“Small
claims decisions have only limited collateral estoppel effect as to issues
actually litigated and are not res judicata.” 
(Jellinek v. Superior Court (1991) 228 Cal.App.3d 652, 659.)  The small claims action was not litigated on
the merits.
The
demurrer is overruled on this ground.
B.        The FAC Clearly Alleges a Written
Contract.
Defendants
argue that the first, second, and third causes of action are uncertain because
the attached Joint Venture Agreement is unsigned, so it is unclear whether the
alleged contract is oral or written. 
(Demurrer at pp. 12-13.)
The
FAC alleges that on June 5, 2018, the parties “entered into a written Joint
Venture Agreement.”  (FAC ¶ 8.)  “A true and correct copy of the form of the
Joint Venture Agreement” is attached as Exhibit A.  Although it is unsigned, Plaintiff provides a
copy of the executed agreement with its opposition.  Moreover, the pleadings stage is not an
evidentiary stage; the unsigned attachment is sufficient to allege the terms of
the contract at issue.
The
demurrer is overruled on this ground.
C.        Plaintiff May Seek Restitution.
Defendants
argue that restitution, the second cause of action, is not a cause of action.  (Demurrer at p. 13.)
“The
law respects form less than substance.” 
(Civ. Code, § 3528.)  No
particular form of pleading is required to invoke the doctrine of restitution.  (Dinosaur Development, Inc. v. White
(1989) 216 Cal.App.3d 1310, 1315.)
The
demurrer is overruled on this ground.
D.        The Contract Claims Are Not
Time-Barred.
Defendants
argue that claims based on the uncertain contract are barred by the statute of
limitations for oral contract.  (Demurrer
at pp. 14-15.)  As discussed above,
Plaintiff pleads breach of a written contract, which is subject to a four-year
statute of limitations.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 337, subd. (a).)  Plaintiff
alleges that Defendants breached the agreement beginning on August 5, 2019, so
this action (filed June 12, 2023) is timely.
The
demurrer is overruled on this ground.
E.        Conclusion
The
demurrer is OVERRULED.  Defendants are
ordered to file an answer within 10 days. 
(California Rules of Court, rule 3.1320(j)(1).)
MOTION TO
STRIKE
The Court may, upon a motion or at any time in its discretion: (1)
strike out any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading;
or (2) strike out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in
conformity with the laws of California, a court rule, or an order of the
court.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 436, subds.
(a)-(b).)
Plaintiff moves to strike the FAC for the same reasons set forth
in the demurrer.  (Motion at p. 4.)
The motion to strike is DENIED.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
