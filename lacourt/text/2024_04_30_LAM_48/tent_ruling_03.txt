[TENTATIVE] ORDER DENYING MOTION FOR AN OSC
  RE: CONTEMPT; DENYING REQUEST FOR ENTRY OF DEFAULT JUDGMENT 
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
April 30, 2024



 
On January 18, 2024, the Court
granted discovery motions filed by Plaintiff Leo Cordova and ordered Defendant Long
Spring Freight LLC to produce its PMK for a deposition and pay sanctions within
30 days.  On March 5, 2024, Plaintiff filed
a motion for contempt of this order.
On
April 19, 2024, Plaintiff filed a request for entry of default judgment against
defaulted Defendants A&D Hauling Services and Vincent Hui.
OSC RE: CONTEMPT
A
court may find a person in contempt for disobedience of a lawful court order.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1209, subd. (a)(6), 1218.)  “‘The elements of proof necessary to support punishment
for contempt are: (1) a valid court order, (2) the alleged contemnor’s knowledge
of the order, and (3) noncompliance.  [Citation.]  The order must be clear, specific, and unequivocal.  [Citation.]’” 
(Koshak v. Malek (2011) 200 Cal.App.4th 1540, 1548-1549.)  A finding of contempt must be based on a “clear,
intentional violation of a specific, narrowly drawn order.  Specificity is an essential prerequisite of a
contempt citation.”  (Van v. Language Line
Services, Inc. (2017) 8 Cal.App.5th 73, 82.)  Contempt “‘is a drastic remedy, to be employed
only when necessary to the proper and orderly conduct of judicial proceedings.’”  (Chapman v. Superior Court for Los Angeles
County (1968) 261 Cal.App.2d 194, 201.)
“Unless
the citee has concealed himself from the court, he must be personally served with
the affidavit and order to show cause; otherwise, the court lacks jurisdiction
to proceed.”  (Cedars-Sinai Imaging
Medical Group v. Superior Court (2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 1281, 1286-1287.)  Plaintiff did not personally serve Defendant
with the contempt papers.  Therefore, this Court lacks jurisdiction.
Plaintiff
also requests an order to show cause why Defendant’s counsel should not be held
in contempt.  Defendant’s counsel’s
declaration, filed on April 16, 2024, provides a satisfactory explanation for
why he could not comply with the discovery order: Defendant’s representative
said he would not authorize any further defense of this action, and counsel
cannot take any further steps.  Counsel
plans to bring a motion to withdraw as Defendant’s counsel.
The
Motion for an Order to Show Cause Re: Contempt is DENIED.
DEFAULT
JUDGMENT
Plaintiff seeks a judgment of $1,656,748.18,
consisting of $609,400.00 in damages, $1,000,000.00 in punitive damages, $28,351.62
in prejudgment interest, $18,274.73 in attorney fees, and $721.83 in costs.
Plaintiff’s request suffers from multiple
deficiencies.
Plaintiff
did file Statements of Damages with proofs of service showing service of the Statements
before the entries of default.  (See Code
Civ. Proc., §§ 425.11, subd. (c), 425.115, subd. (f).)  The Statements of Damages state Plaintiff’s
intent to seek $5,000,000.00 for emotional distress, $75,000.00 for loss of
earnings, and $2,000,000.00 in punitive damages.  However, of Plaintiff’s requested damages, $109,400.00
is for loss of earnings.  (Cordova Decl.
¶ 15.)  The Court cannot award more in a default judgment than the amount
demanded in the complaint or statement of damages.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 580, subd. (a).)  Additionally, some of Plaintiff’s lost
earnings are speculative.  Plaintiff
received an annual bonus in 2019, and he “reasonably believe[s] that, if [he]
had still been employed at Defendants at the end of 2020, [he] would have
received at least another bonus of $5,000.” 
(Cordova Decl. ¶ 14.)
Plaintiff’s
claims against Long Spring Freight LLC are still pending.  Plaintiff has not yet dismissed or substituted
a successor-in-interest for Defendant Grace Hsiao Hui, who is now deceased.  Accordingly, she too remains named in this
action and is not in default.  “Where
parties are jointly liable on the same obligation, it is improper to enter a
default judgment against one while the action remains pending against
others.”  (6 Witkin, Cal. Proc. (6th ed. March 2023 Update) Judgment by
Default, § 171(2)(b).)
For
at least these reasons, the request for entry of default judgment is DENIED.
On
the Court’s own motion, the Order to Show Cause Re: Dismissal for Failure to Enter
Default Judgment as to Defendant A&D Hauling Services scheduled for May 3, 2024
at 8:30 a.m. is advanced to this date and vacated.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
