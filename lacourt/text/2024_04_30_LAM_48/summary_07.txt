```

And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has granted the plaintiff's motion for a protective order, prohibiting the defendant from propounding discovery regarding certain topics. These topics include Arturo Llamas's assets, his Mexican will, White Egg ownership, and horse ownership. The court finds that these topics are not relevant to the validity of the quitclaim deed and that the deponents' credibility with respect to the Mexican will and horse ownership is not relevant. The court has also granted the protective order to protect the deponents from unwarranted annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden and expense.
