C.        Consolidated Action and Pending Motions
On
November 9, 2023, the Court consolidated Case No. 22STCV28077 and Case No. 22STLC06776
for all purposes, designated Case No. 22STCV28077 as the lead case, and ordered
that subsequent filings should be under the lead case number.
As
of April 26, 2024, only two hearings remain on the Court’s calendar: (1) Green Court
Investors LP, KLS Financial LLC, and Kim Shapiro’s demurrer and motion to strike
Infinity Plumbing Inc. and Marco Marquez’s FACC (Case No. 22STCV28077, Reservation
ID: 214354661412) on April 30, 2024; and (2) Infinity Plumbing Inc., Marco Marquez,
and Maria Carmen Marquez’s demurrer to Green Court Investors LP’s FACC (Case No.
22STCV28077, Reservation ID: 712593875725) on July 11, 2024.  The demurrers filed as to the FACCs in Case No.
22STLC06776 are no longer on calendar, and they will remain off calendar.
Despite
there being only two pending motions, the parties filed oppositions and replies
to all of the demurrers and motions to strike, creating a confusing docket after
the cases’ consolidation.
For
simplicity and clarity throughout the remainder of this consolidated action, the
Court ORDERS Infinity Plumbing Inc. and Marco Marquez to file a single second amended
cross-complaint containing all of their consolidated claims, under the lead case
number Case No. 22STCV28077.[1]  The Court also ORDERS Green Court Investors LP
to file a single second amended cross-complaint containing all of its consolidated
claims, under the lead case number Case No. 22STCV28077.
The
amended pleadings are to be filed within 30 days.
On
the Court’s own motion, the Hearing on Demurrer - without Motion to Strike scheduled
for July 11, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. (Reservation ID: 712593875725) is advanced to this
date and vacated.
INFINITY
PLUMBING INC. AND MARCO MARQUEZ’S FACC (CASE NO. 22STCV28077)
On
July 20, 2023, Infinity Plumbing Inc. and Marco Marquez filed a FACC in Case No.
22STCV28077.  The FACC alleges (1) breach
of contract; (2) implied indemnity; (3) equitable indemnity; (4) defamation; and
(5) breach of implied covenant.
On
August 2, 2023, Green Court Investors LP, KLS Financial LLC, and Kim Shapiro filed
a demurrer and motion to strike (Reservation ID: 214354661412).
A.        Demurrer
A
demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action.  (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740,
747.)  When considering demurrers, courts
read the allegations liberally and in context, accepting the alleged facts as true.  (Nolte v. Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (2015)
236 Cal.App.4th 1401, 1406.)
Cross-Defendants
argue that the FACC does not state facts for breach of contract (first cause of
action) by KLS because it was signed by Shapiro as a representative of GCI.  (Demurrer at p. 9.)  The attached contract for re-piping states, “Proposal
Submitted to: KLS Financial.”  (Complaint,
Ex. A.)  It is signed by Marco Marquez as
President of Infinity and presumably Shapiro as “Owner/Rep.”  The FACC alleges that the contract was entered
into “through KLS the authorized agent of Green Court.”  (FACC ¶ 8.) 
This is sufficient at the pleading stage to allege KLS as a party to the
contract.
Related
to the breach of contract claim is the fifth cause of action for breach of the implied
covenant of good faith and fair dealing. 
“The covenant of good faith and fair dealing, implied by law in every contract,
exists merely to prevent one contracting party from unfairly frustrating the other
party’s right to receive the benefits of the agreement actually made.  The covenant thus cannot ‘“‘be endowed with an
existence independent of its contractual underpinnings.’”’  [Citation.] 
It cannot impose substantive duties or limits on the contracting parties
beyond those incorporated in the specific terms of their agreement.”  (Guz v. Bechtel National, Inc. (2000) 24
Cal.4th 317, 349-350.)
Cross-Defendants
argue that the FACC does not allege any facts showing a special relationship for
tort recovery.  (Demurrer at p. 14.)  “[T]ort recovery for breach of the covenant [of
good faith and fair dealing] is available only in limited circumstances, generally
involving a special relationship between the contracting parties, such as the relationship
between an insured and its insurer.”  (Bionghi
v. Metropolitan Water Dist. of So. California (1999) 70 Cal.App.4th 1358, 1370.)  “Because the covenant of good faith and fair dealing
essentially is a contract term that aims to effectuate the contractual intentions
of the parties, ‘compensation for its breach has almost always been limited to contract
rather than tort remedies.’ ”  (Cates Construction,
Inc. v. Talbot Partners (1999) 21 Cal.4th 28, 43.)  Pleading a claim for breach of the applied covenant
is permissible even without a special relationship, although the remedies may be
limited to contract remedies.
Cross-Defendants
argue that the causes of action for implied and equitable indemnity (second and
third causes of action) do not allege any underlying tort in the FACC which could
give rise to a claim of equitable indemnity. 
(Demurrer at pp. 10-11.)  “‘An action
for implied contractual indemnity is not a claim for contribution from a joint tortfeasor;
it is not founded upon a tort or upon any duty which the indemnitor owes to the
injured third party.  It is grounded upon
the indemnitor’s breach of duty owing to the indemnitee to properly perform
its contractual duties.’”  (West v. Superior
Court (1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 1625, 1633.) 
“[I]mplied contractual indemnity between the indemnitor and the indemnitee
can provide a basis for equitable indemnity.” 
(BFGC Architects Planners, Inc. v. Forcum/Mackey Construction, Inc.
(2004) 119 Cal.App.4th 848, 852.)  Accordingly,
the properly pleaded claim for implied indemnity can also support a claim for equitable
indemnity.
Cross-Defendants
argue that the FACC lacks specific facts for defamation (fourth cause of action).  (Demurrer at pp. 11-13.)  According to Cross-Defendants, “judicially noticeable
documents show that a mechanic’s lien was recorded against the Property on July
14, 2022, two days before the allegedly defamatory statements were made, demonstrating
that litigation was inevitable or at lease under serious consideration at that time.”  (Demurrer at p. 13.)  Cross-Defendants do not provide these documents,
and the Court cannot determine from the face of the FACC whether the litigation
privilege applies.  Cross-Defendants also
contend that when Shapiro wrote the statement, she was “was not acting as representative
or agent of KLS or GCI.”  (Demurrer at p.
13.)  However, the FACC alleges that Shapiro
acted “for herself and as an authorized agent of the remaining cross-defendants.”  (FACC ¶ 17; see FACC ¶ 18.)
The
defamation claim does have one deficiency: it does not allege the libelous statement
with specificity.  “The general rule is that
the words constituting an alleged libel must be specifically identified, if not
pleaded verbatim, in the complaint.”  (Kahn
v. Bower (1991) 232 Cal.App.3d 1599, 1612, fn. 5.)  The demurrer is sustained on this ground.
The
demurrer to the fifth cause of action is SUSTAINED with 30 days’ leave to amend,
and it is otherwise OVERRULED.
B.        Motion to Strike
The Court may, upon a motion or at any time in its discretion: (1)
strike out any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading; or
(2) strike out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity
with the laws of California, a court rule, or an order of the court.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 436, subds. (a)-(b).)
Cross-Defendants
move to strike portions of Paragraphs 13 (erroneously stated as 14) and 15, related
to indemnity and recovering attorney fees on the second and third causes of action.  The Prayers for Relief ask for only “costs.”  The allegations in Paragraphs 13 and 15 that Cross-Complainant
“has incurred and will continue to incur legal fees” are not improper.  Any argument for or against the availability of
attorney fees is premature.  The motion is
denied for these items.
Cross-Defendants
move to strike portions of Paragraphs 19 and 24, and Prayer for Relief Nos. 4 (fourth
cause of action) and 5 (fifth cause of action), all related to punitive damages.  A plaintiff can recover punitive damages in tort
cases where “the defendant has been guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice.”  (Civ. Code § 3294, subd. (a).)  Punitive damages thus require more than the mere
commission of a tort.  (Taylor v. Superior
Court (1979) 24 Cal.3d 890, 894-895.) 
Specific facts must be pleaded in support of punitive damages.  (Hillard v. A.H. Robins Co. (1983) 148
Cal.App.3d 374, 391-392; Smith v. Superior Court (1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 1033,
1041-1042 [conclusory allegations without sufficient facts are not enough to support
a request for punitive damages].)  The FACC
lacks these specific facts.  The motion is
granted for these items.
Cross-Defendants
move to strike the Prayers for Relief for ten-percent interest on the second, third,
fourth, and fifth causes of action.  Prejudgment
interest on torts claims is limited to seven-percent.  (Cal. Const., art. 15, § 1.)  The motion is granted on this ground.
Cross-Defendants
also argue that the claims improperly seek prejudgment interest on damages that
are not capable of being made certain.  (See
Civ. Code, § 3287.)  At this time, that argument
is premature.  The award of prejudgment interest,
if any, will be determined later.
The
motion to strike is GRANTED with 30 days’ leave to amend to state specific facts
for punitive damages and to remove the references to ten-percent interest.  The motion is otherwise DENIED.
Clerk
to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
