Summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Veronica Rodriguez vs. Ford Motor Company and Bob Wondries Ford. The Defendants have moved for summary judgment or adjudication on the first and second causes of action, which allege breach of express warranty and a violation of Civil Code § 1793.2. The Judge grants the motion as to the first cause of action against Bob Wondries Ford and the second cause of action against all Defendants, and denies it otherwise. The Judge finds that Bob Wondries was not a party to the warranty and disclaimed any warranty created by the sales transaction, and that the sole repair taking longer than 30 days took place outside the warranty period. The Judge also finds that the four-year limitations period for the Song-Beverly claim did not begin to run on July 29, 2014, as argued by the Defendants, and that the claim accrued at a later date when the defect persisted after a reasonable number of repair attempts.
