And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, defendant, in the case of Linda McAfee v. Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. The plaintiff, Linda McAfee, alleges that she suffered a fractured leg due to the negligence of Cedars-Sinai employees during her transport from the hospital to her husband's vehicle after her discharge from in-patient treatment.

The court has overruled the demurrer and found that the plaintiff's complaint alleges sufficient facts to state a claim for elder abuse. However, the court has granted the motion to strike the request for attorney's fees and costs, finding that the complaint does not allege facts sufficient to support this request.

The court has also denied leave to amend the complaint without prejudice, allowing the plaintiff to seek leave to amend if she discovers new evidence supporting her request for attorney's fees and costs. The court has ordered the defendant to file and serve its responsive pleading within 10 days of the order.
