And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Steve K. Lopez v. Mai Thai, case number 23STCV14971. The case involves a motion for interlocutory judgment of partition and the appointment of a referee, brought by Plaintiff Steve K. Lopez against Defendant Mai Thai. The motion was heard on December 22, 2023, and the Judge initially granted the motion, but continued the hearing to allow Defendant to obtain counsel to oppose the motion. However, Defendant failed to file a written opposition and has not obtained counsel. The Judge has now set a briefing schedule for a motion to set aside the default, and will continue the motion for interlocutory judgment of partition to a date thereafter. The Judge is mindful of Defendant's status as a self-represented litigant and is giving her an opportunity to set aside the default and be heard on the motion.
