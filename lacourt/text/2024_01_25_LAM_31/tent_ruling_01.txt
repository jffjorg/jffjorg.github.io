MOTIONS
TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL



 
MOVING PARTY:               A. Scott
Brown, Law Offices of A. Scott Brown
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     No opposition
 
 
I.          INTRODUCTION
 
On December 13, 2023, A. Scott Brown, counsel for Defendants,
Zion Vanounou, Moshe Vanounou, and 2808-2850 South Sante Fe, LLC, filed these Motions
to be Relieved as Counsel.  
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARD 
 
California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362 (Motion to Be
Relieved as Counsel) requires (1) notice of motion and motion to be directed to
the client (made on the Notice of Motion and Motion to be Relieved as
Counsel—Civil form (MC-051)); (2) a declaration stating in general terms and without
compromising the confidentiality of the attorney-client relationship why a
motion under Code of Civil Procedure section 284(2) is brought instead of
filing a consent under Code of Civil Procedure section 284(1) (made on the
Declaration in Support of Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil
form (MC-052)); (3) service of the notice of motion and motion and declaration
on all other parties who have appeared in the case; and (4) the proposed order
relieving counsel (prepared on the Order Granting Attorney's Motion to Be
Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-053)). 
 
The court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw,
and such a motion should be granted provided that there is no prejudice to the
client, and it does not disrupt the orderly process of justice.  (See Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21
Cal.App.4th 904, 915.)  
 
III.       DISCUSSION 
 
A. Scott Brown seeks to be relieved as counsel of record for
Defendants for the following reasons: “There has been a breakdown in the attorney-client
relationship to the extent that I cannot adequately and zealously continue to
represent the client's interest. There has also been a breakdown in confidence
and trust between the client and my office. Fees remain outstanding and have
not been paid and prospects of future payment are insufficient. My efforts to
remedy these issues have been unsuccessful. The facts and circumstances giving
rise to the conflict in the relationship cannot be further disclosed without
violating confidences and privileged communications.”  (Forms MC-052.)   
 
Absent a showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney’s
request for withdrawal should be granted.  (People v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d
398, 406.)  
 
Upon review, the court finds the Motions comply with
California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362.  
 
IV.       CONCLUSION         
            Accordingly,
the unopposed motions are GRANTED and effective upon the filing of the
proofs of service of this signed order upon Defendants. 
            The court sets
a status conference re: defense counsel for March 1, 2024 at 9:00 am.  
            Counsel to
give notice.
