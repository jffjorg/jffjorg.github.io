The tentative ruling is in response to a demurrer filed by Defendant Saeid Shadanloo and Defendant Samsum Shadanloo to the Plaintiff Ehsan Bashi's First Amended Complaint. The Court finds that the demurrer is sustained with 30 days' leave to amend. The Court also denies the Plaintiff's Motion for Sanctions against Defendant Samsum Shadanloo and the Defendant's Motion for Sanctions against the Plaintiff. The Court grants judicial notice of certain court records and requests for judicial notice.

The Court finds that the Plaintiff's claims against Defendant Samsum Shadanloo are not well-pleaded and require amendment. The Court also rejects the Defendant's arguments that the Plaintiff's claims are barred by res judicata and collateral estoppel.

The Court notes that the parties' filings are confusing and difficult to track and advises counsel to make each motion, opposition, and reply a standalone document. The Court also admonishes counsel to be mindful of their professional and ethical obligations.

In conclusion, the Court sustains the demurrer with 30 days' leave to amend and denies the motions for sanctions.
