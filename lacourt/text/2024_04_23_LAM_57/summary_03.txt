  - "The Court's tentative decision is that the particular allegations in Plaintiff Tapasya Bali's complaint that are identified in the special motion to strike under the anti-SLAPP statute filed by Defendant Prysm Financial Technology Inc. ('Prysm') arise from protected activity and that Bali has failed to establish a probability that she will prevail on the merits of any of her claims to the extent that the claims rely on the allegations in question."
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative decision is that the allegations in the complaint filed by Tapasya Bali, the plaintiff, that are related to the special motion to strike under the anti-SLAPP statute filed by Prysm Financial Technology Inc. (the defendant) arise from protected activity. Additionally, the judge finds that Bali has failed to establish a probability that she will prevail on the merits of her claims to the extent that the claims rely on the allegations in question. The judge is, however, uncertain about the implications for Bali's claims due to an inconsistency between Prysm's proposed order granting the anti-SLAPP motion and its memorandum in support of the motion. The judge will address this inconsistency at the hearing.
