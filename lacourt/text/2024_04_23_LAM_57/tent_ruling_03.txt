 Case Number:  24STCV01156    Hearing Date:   April 23, 2024    Dept:  57  The Court's tentative decision is that the particular allegations in Plaintiff Tapasya Bali's complaint that are identified in the special motion to strike under the anti-SLAPP statute filed by Defendant Prysm Financial Technology Inc. ("Prysm") arise from protected activity and that Bali hhas failed to establish a probability that she will prevail on the merits of any of her claims to the extent that the claims rely on the allegations in question.  The Court is somewhat uncertain, however, as to what the upshot is for Bali's claims.  This uncertainty arises in part because of apparent inconsistency between Prysm's proposed order granting the anti-SLAPP motion and its memorandum in support of the motion.  The Court will address this inconsistency at the hearing today.
