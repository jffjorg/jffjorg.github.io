And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling on a case involving Denise Washington, who sued O.R. Barkhordar D.D.S., Inc. (ORB) for breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, intentional misrepresentation, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The case arises from ORB's application for third-party financing for Washington's dental treatment without her knowledge.

The judge sustains the demurrer to the third cause of action (breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing) with leave to amend, as the FAC does not plead the existence of a contractual relationship between Washington and ORB. The judge also sustains the demurrer to the sixth cause of action (intentional infliction of emotional distress) with leave to amend, as the FAC does not plead sufficient evidence of severe emotional distress and the alleged conduct by ORB. The judge overrules the demurrer to the fifth cause of action (intentional misrepresentation), as the FAC sufficiently pleads concealment and misrepresentation by ORB employees and agents.
