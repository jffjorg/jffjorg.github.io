And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The defendant's motion to compel the plaintiff, Peter Voutsas, to answer deposition questions and produce documents at the deposition is granted. The plaintiff's argument that the stipulated judgment in the Lazar action precludes the defendants from asking questions and obtaining documents is incorrect. The court has not ruled on the preclusive effect of the stipulated judgment in this action, and therefore, Voutsas cannot use it to avoid answering questions and producing documents at the deposition. The questions and documents sought by the defendants are relevant to the parties' claims and defenses in this action. The court finds that the defendants have good cause to compel Voutsas to produce the documents and answer the deposition questions.
