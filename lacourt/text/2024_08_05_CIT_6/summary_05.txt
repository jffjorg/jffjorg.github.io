Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court DENIES Plaintiff's motion to strike Defendant Vons Companies, Inc.'s memorandum of costs. Vons Companies, Inc. is a prevailing party and is entitled to recover costs as a matter of right. The Court finds that Vons Companies, Inc. incurred the costs for filing the answer to the complaint, filing fees for the motion for summary judgment and motion to compel deposition, and deposition costs. The Court does not find that these costs were incurred jointly by Vons Companies, Inc. and Starbucks Corporation, as they were incurred solely for Vons Companies, Inc.'s conduct of the litigation. The Court also finds that Vons Companies, Inc. did not incur the costs for the answer to the complaint jointly with Albertsons Companies, Inc., as Albertsons Companies, Inc. has been dismissed from the action. Therefore, the Court DENIES the motion as to the $1,025.10 in Filing and Motion Fees, $3,003.95 in Deposition Costs, and $513.75 for the motion for summary judgment.
