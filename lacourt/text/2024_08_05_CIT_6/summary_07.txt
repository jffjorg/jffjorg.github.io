And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is making some preliminary determinations before the court hearing. Firstly, the judge notes that the plaintiff did not file proof of service for their opposition, and therefore the court will verify with the moving parties at the hearing whether they received a copy of the opposition. Secondly, the judge emphasizes that the grounds for the demurrer should be stated separately from the notice, citing relevant court rules and guidelines. Finally, the judge notes that the issue of res judicata (preventing the re-litigation of the same claims) was not raised in the plaintiff's opposition this time, and therefore the court will need to clarify whether the plaintiff is alleging the same claims as were previously litigated.
