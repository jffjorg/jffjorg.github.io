And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has made a tentative ruling on two motions brought by the plaintiff, Claire He Yi, to compel the attendance of two defendants, Juliet Ru-Yi Chung and Rosemary F. Kennedy, at a deposition and to produce documents. The court has denied both motions and has awarded monetary sanctions against the plaintiff's counsel in the amount of $800.00 and $400.00 respectively.

The court found that the plaintiff did not meet and confer with the defendants before bringing the motions, and that the plaintiff did not provide a declaration regarding efforts to meet and confer with the defendants. The court also found that the defendants objected to the deposition notices due to unavailability of counsel.

The court concluded that the plaintiff's motions were not well-taken and that the defendants had valid objections to the deposition notices. The court awarded monetary sanctions against the plaintiff's counsel for bringing the motions without first attempting to meet and confer or inquire about the nonappearance, as required by the Code of Civil Procedure.
