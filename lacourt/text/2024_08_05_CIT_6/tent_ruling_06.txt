 Case Number:  23PSCV03064    Hearing Date:   August 5, 2024    Dept:  6 CASE NAME:  Yuzheng Chen  v. Longji Guan, et al. 1.       Demurrer of  Defendants Longji Guan and Xiuhua Liang to Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint;  and 2.      Defendants Longji Guan and Xiuhua Liang's Motion to Strike  TENTATIVE  RULING            The Court SUSTAINS the demurrer of Defendants Longji Guan and Xiuhua  Liang to the First Amended Complaint without leave to amend.              The Court DENIES the motion to  strike as moot.              Defendants Longji Guan and Xiuhua  Liang are ordered to give notice of the Court’s ruling within five calendar  days of this order.  BACKGROUND  This is a breach of contract case. On October 6, 2023, plaintiff Yuzheng  Chen (Plaintiff) filed this action against defendants Longji Guan (Longji), Xiuhua  Liang (Xiuhua), Bingwei Guan, Yudan Li (collectively, Defendants), and Does 1  through 4, alleging one cause of action for breach of contract. On March 11,  2024, following the Court’s sustaining of Defendants Guan and Li’s demurrer to  the complaint, Plaintiff filed the operative First Amended Complaint (FAC)  against Defendants, alleging one cause of action for breach of contract.  On May 7, 2024, the Court sustained the demurrer of Defendants  Bingwei Guan and Yudan Li to the FAC without leave to amend and dismissed them  from this action with prejudice.[See Nunc Pro Tunc Order 7/31/24; Minute Order  5/7/24.]  On June 21, 2024, Defendants Longji and Xiuhua (collectively,  Moving Parties) demurred to and moved to strike the FAC. On July 9, 2024,  Plaintiff opposed the demurrer and motion to strike.[1] On July 31, 2024, Moving Parties replied.  LEGAL  STANDARD - Demurrer  A  demurrer is a pleading used to test the legal sufficiency of other  pleadings. It raises issues of law, not fact, regarding the form or  content of the opposing party's pleading (complaint, answer or  cross-complaint). (Code Civ. Proc., § 422.10; see Donabedian v.  Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) It is not the function  of the demurrer to challenge the truthfulness of the complaint; and for  purposes of ruling on the demurrer, all facts pleaded in the complaint are  assumed to be true. (Id., at pp. 993-994.)  A  demurrer can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the  pleading under attack; or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially  noticeable. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318; Donabedian,  supra, 116 Cal.App.4th at p. 994.) No other extrinsic evidence can be  considered. (Ion Equip. Corp. v. Nelson (1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 868,  881 [error for court to consider facts asserted in memorandum supporting  demurrer]; see also Afuso v. United States Fid. & Guar. Co. (1985) 169 Cal.App.3d 859, 862, disapproved on other grounds in Moradi-Shalal  v. Fireman’s Fund Ins. Cos. (1988) 46 Cal.3d 287 [error to consider  contents of release not part of court record].)  A  demurrer can be utilized where the “face of the complaint” itself is incomplete  or discloses some defense that would bar recovery. (Guardian North Bay, Inc.  v. Superior Court (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 963, 971-972.) The “face of  the complaint” includes material contained in attached exhibits that are  incorporated by reference into the complaint, or in a superseded complaint in the same action. (Frantz v.  Blackwell (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 91, 94; see also Barnett v. Fireman’s  Fund Ins. Co. (2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 500, 505 [“[W]e rely on and accept as true the contents of the exhibits and treat as  surplusage the pleader’s allegations as to the legal effect of the exhibits.”])  A  demurrer can only be sustained when it disposes of an entire pleading, cause of  action, or affirmative defense. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1320, subd.  (a); Poizner v. Fremont General Corp. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97, 119; Kong  v. City of Hawaiian Gardens Redev. Agency  (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 1028, 1046-1047.)  PRELIMINARY ISSUES – Demurrer  The Court  notes that Moving Parties’ demurrer does not state each ground for the demurrer  in a separate paragraph, as required by Rule 3.1320, subdivision (a), of the  California Rules of Court. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1320, subd. (a); see  Notice of Demurrer, 2:3-7.)[2] The Court previously admonished Bingwei Guan and Yudan Li, who are represented  by the same attorneys as Moving Parties, regarding this same issue. (Order re  Tentative Ruling (5/7/24).) The Court admonishes Moving Parties to comply with  the requirements of the California Rules of Court going forward. The Court also notes that Moving Parties filed their reply on July 31, 2024, which is two days late. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005, subd. (b).) The Court exercises its discretion to still consider the reply, but admonishes Moving Parties to comply with the requirements of the Code of Civil Procedure going forward. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1300, subd. (d); Juarez v. Wash Depot Holdings, Inc. (2018) 24 Cal.App.5th 1197, 1202.) DISCUSSION –  Demurrer  Meet and Confer  Per Code of Civil Procedure section  430.41, subdivision (a), Moving Parties were required to meet and confer before  bringing this demurrer. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a).) The Court finds  Moving Parties’ efforts to meet and confer sufficient. (Hwang Meet & Confer  Decl., ¶¶ 3-7.)  Summary of Arguments  Moving Parties demur to the FAC on the grounds that it is barred  by res judicata and fails to state a cause of action. Moving Parties contend  that Plaintiff previously sued them based upon the same alleged breach of  contract regarding the same property which Plaintiff later dismissed with  prejudice. Moving Parties also contend the FAC fails to plead any facts  supporting the existence of a valid contract between the parties, and that the  exhibits attached to the FAC do nothing to support Plaintiff’s claim.  In opposition, it is not entirely clear what Plaintiff argues, but  Plaintiff appears to argue that he has the right to refile a lawsuit if it was  withdrawn. Plaintiff’s opposition also appears to argue that Moving Parties  filed their demurrer too late, based on a service date on April 7, 2024, which  would create a responsive pleading deadline of May 7, 2024.  Timeliness  A demurrer generally must be filed within 30 days of service of  the summons and complaint. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.40, subd. (a).) However, the  Court has the discretion to still consider an untimely demurrer. (Jackson v. Doe  (2011) 192 Cal.App.4th 742, 750.) To the extent Plaintiff is arguing the  demurrer was not timely filed, Plaintiff has not presented any evidence of  Plaintiff’s rights being substantially affected by the late-filed demurrer, as  Plaintiff did not attempt to obtain a default judgment or in any other way  demonstrate how the delay prejudiced Plaintiff. (See Id.) Moreover, the  FAC does not contain a proof of service and the Proofs of Service filed April  22, 2024 indicate that the summons and complaint were served, not the FAC. To  the extent Moving Parties filed and served their demurrer more than 30 days  after service of the FAC, the Court exercises its discretion to still consider  the demurrer. Nevertheless, the Court admonishes Moving Parties to comply with  the requirements of the Code of Civil Procedure going forward.  First Cause of Action – Breach of Contract  “A cause of action for breach of contract requires pleading of a  contract, plaintiff's performance or excuse for failure to perform, defendant's  breach and damage to plaintiff resulting therefrom. [Citation.] A written  contract may be pleaded either by its terms—set out verbatim in the complaint  or a copy of the contract attached to the complaint and incorporated therein by  reference—or by its legal effect. [Citation.]” (McKell v. Washington Mutual,  Inc. (2006) 142 Cal.App.4th 1457, 1489.)  As with the demurrer of Bingwei Guan and Yudan Li, the Court finds  the allegations of the FAC are not sufficiently clear for it to determine  whether these claims have been previously adjudicated between the parties.  While it appears Plaintiff has sued the Defendants multiple times over the past  few years for issues involving rent, it is not clear to the Court that  Plaintiff is suing over the same matter here. (See FAC, pp. 3-4, Exs. A, B; Fed'n of Hillside & Canyon Assns. v. City of Los Angeles  (2004) 126 Cal.App.4th 1180, 1202 [“Res judicata or claim preclusion precludes the re-litigation of a cause of action that previously was adjudicated in another proceeding between the same parties  or parties  in privity  with them.”])  More specifically, it is unclear to the Court if Plaintiff is suing Moving  Parties based on three months of rent previously addressed in a small claims  court action or if Plaintiff is merely providing context for the present action.  (See FAC, p. 3, Ex. A.)[3]  Nevertheless, the Court does agree with Moving  Parties that the FAC fails to allege facts sufficient to state a cause of  action for breach of contract. The Court finds the FAC confusing and unclear as  to what Plaintiff’s claims are here, and finds that it fails to clearly set  forth the terms of any purported contract between the parties. (See FAC, pp.  3-4.) To the extent Plaintiff is alleging breach of contract, the terms of any  purported contract here are too indefinite for the Court to determine whether  the allegations support a claim for breach of contract. (See Moncada v. W. Coast Quartz Corp. (2013) 221 Cal.App.4th  768, 777 [“The terms of a contract are reasonably certain if they provide a  basis for determining the existence of a breach and for giving an appropriate  remedy.”]) For example, there are no allegations of what the consideration was,  i.e., what was to be paid in exchange for what services. (San Luis Obispo Loc. Agency Formation Comm'n v. City of Pismo  Beach (2021) 61 Cal.App.5th 595, 600 [“A contract requires consideration. [Citation.]”) The FAC  certainly does not allege facts showing Plaintiff is entitled to the  $15,000,000 in damages sought. (FAC, ¶ 10, subd. (a).) The FAC also does not  clearly allege what the duration of the purported agreement was, who the  parties were, or the terms of the agreement. (See FAC, pp. 3-4.) If Plaintiff  is alleging breach of a lease agreement, it is unclear which property that  claim is based on, considering the FAC mentions two properties. (FAC, pp. 3-4.)  Moreover,  none of the attachments to the FAC provide any clarity either. (See FAC, Exs. A-D.)  A number of the attachments are in mandarin, which the Court cannot read  without a proper translation. (See FAC, Exs. C-D.) The other attachments appear  to be documents from previous lawsuits involving Plaintiff and the Defendants  in one form or another, but it is unclear how those form the basis of a claim  for breach of contract. (See FAC, Exs. A-D.)  Furthermore,  the Residential Lease Agreement attached  to the FAC appears to be an agreement between Heng Le and Longji Guan for the  rental of a room at 19503 Newgarden St., Rowland Heights, CA 91748. (FAC, Ex.  D.) Plaintiff is not Heng Le, and therefore lacks standing to sue under this  agreement. (Gause v. Pacific Gas & Elec. Co. (1923) 60 Cal.App. 360,  365-366 [generally one must be a party to the contract to have standing to sue  based on that contract].) Additionally, Defendant Xiuhua is not a party to that  agreement either, and therefore cannot be liable for its breach. (See FAC, Ex.  D; Kendis v. Cohn (1928) 90 Cal.App. 41, 66 [“a party cannot be charged  upon a contract to which he is not a party.”]) Thus, the FAC fails to allege  facts sufficient to state a cause of action for breach of contract against  Moving Parties.  Finally, Plaintiff has not proffered any new allegations  showing how the defects identified herein can be addressed.  Based on the foregoing, the Court SUSTAINS the demurrer without  leave to amend.   LEGAL  STANDARD – Motion to Strike  “Any party, within the time allowed to respond to a pleading may  serve and file a notice of motion to strike the whole or any part thereof, but this  time limitation shall not apply to motions specified in subdivision (e).”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 435, subd. (b)(2).) “The court may, upon a motion made  pursuant to Section 435, or at any time in its discretion, and upon terms it  deems proper: (a) Strike out any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted  in any  pleading. (b) Strike out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed  in conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of the  court.” (Id., § 436.)  DISCUSSION  – Motion to Strike  Meet and Confer  Per Code of Civil Procedure section  435.5, subdivision (a), Moving Parties were required to meet and confer telephonically  or in person before bringing this motion to strike. (Code Civ. Proc., § 435.5,  subd. (a).) The Court finds Moving Parties’ efforts to meet and confer to be  sufficient. (Hwang Meet & Confer Decl., ¶¶ 3-7.)  Analysis  In light of the Court’s ruling on the demurrer as discussed above,  the Court DENIES the motion to strike as moot.  CONCLUSION  The Court SUSTAINS the demurrer of Defendants Longji Guan and  Xiuhua Liang to the First Amended Complaint without leave to amend.              The Court DENIES the motion to  strike as moot.              Defendants Longji Guan and Xiuhua  Liang are ordered to give notice of the Court’s ruling within five calendar  days of this order.
