And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is considering a motion by Jason A. Kirkpatrick, Esq. and Walker & Kirkpatrick, the attorneys for RMR Pros, Inc., to be relieved as counsel for the company. The motion is unopposed. The judge finds that the grounds for permitting an attorney to withdraw from representation include a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship, which is the case here. However, the judge is concerned that the attorneys were unable to confirm RMR Pros, Inc.'s current or last known address and did not provide sufficient evidence of their efforts to do so. Therefore, the judge orders the attorneys to provide further information about their attempts to confirm the address and to give notice of the court's ruling and file proof of service within five calendar days.
