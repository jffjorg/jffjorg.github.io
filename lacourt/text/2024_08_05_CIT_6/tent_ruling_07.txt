   [1] Plaintiff did not file a proof of  service for the opposition. The Court will verify with Moving Parties at the  hearing on these motions whether they received a copy of Plaintiff’s  opposition.   [2] The Court also notes that the grounds for the  demurrer should be stated in the demurrer separately from the notice. (See A.  Demurrers, Cal. Prac. Guide Civ. Pro. Before Trial Ch. 7(I)-A, ¶ 7:98 [“The  demurring party must file with the court, and serve on the other party, the  following: • Demurrer; • Notice of Hearing (see  ¶ 7:110 ff.); • Memorandum of Points and Authorities; [CRC 3.1112(a)] • Proof  of service. [CCP § 1005(b); CRC 3.1300(c)]”.)    [3] While the  Court previously mentioned the re-litigation of the same claims against Moving  Parties would constitute res judicata, that issue was not raised in Plaintiff’s  opposition this time. (Order re Tentative Ruling (5/7/24).) Either way, it is  still unclear from the allegations of the FAC whether Plaintiff is alleging the  same claims as those previously litigated, and the allegations are what matter  on a demurrer. (Blank v.  Kirwan, supra, 39  Cal.3d at p. 318; Donabedian, supra, 116 Cal.App.4th at p. 994.)
