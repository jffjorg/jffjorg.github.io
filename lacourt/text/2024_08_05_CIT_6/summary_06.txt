And here is a summary in English text:

The court's tentative ruling sustains the demurrer of defendants Longji Guan and Xiuhua Liang to the First Amended Complaint without leave to amend. The demurrer argues that the complaint is barred by res judicata and fails to state a cause of action for breach of contract. The court finds that the complaint is unclear and fails to allege sufficient facts to support the claims. The court also denies the motion to strike as moot. The defendants are ordered to give notice of the court's ruling within five calendar days of this order.
