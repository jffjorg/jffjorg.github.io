And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving a dispute between Levent Uzkan, the plaintiff, and The Boeing Company, Search-Pros Staffing, LLC, and Does 1-20, the defendants. The dispute centers around whether the plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint is sufficient to state a cause of action.

The judge has sustained the demurrer to the first cause of action, which alleges breach of contract, without leave to amend. The judge has also sustained the demurrer to the second cause of action, which alleges breach of the implied covenant of fair dealing, without leave to amend.

The judge has denied the motion to strike the Second Amended Complaint. The judge has also found that there is not a reasonable possibility that the defect in the plaintiff's complaint can be cured by amendment.

In reaching these conclusions, the judge has considered the pleadings, the parties' arguments, and the applicable law. The judge has concluded that the plaintiff's complaint does not sufficiently state a cause of action and that the defendants' demurrer and motion to strike are meritorious.
