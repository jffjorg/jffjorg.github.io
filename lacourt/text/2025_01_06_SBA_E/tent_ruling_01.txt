BACKGROUND
 
            On January
23, 2023, Plaintiff Levent
Uzkan filed the Complaint.
 
            On August 21, 2024,
Plaintiff filed the First Amended Complaint “FAC” alleging causes of action for
breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of fair dealing regarding
an alleged employment contract.
 
            On October 14, 2024, The
Court sustained the Demurrer to the FAC.
 
            On November 5, 2024, Plaintiff
filed the Second Amended Complaint “SAC” alleging causes of action for breach
of contract and breach of the implied covenant of fair dealing regarding an
alleged employment contract.
            
            On December 5, 2024, Plaintiff
filed the Demurrer to the SAC.
 
            On December 24, 2024, Defendant
filed the Opposition.
 
            On December 27, 2024,
Plaintiff filed the reply.
            
            
LEGAL STANDARD
 
            A demurrer can be
used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the pleading under
attack or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable. (Blank
v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) “To survive a demurrer, the complaint
need only allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action; each evidentiary
fact that might eventually form part of the plaintiff’s proof need not be
alleged.” (C.A. v. William S. Hart Union High School Dist. (2012) 
53 Cal.4th 861, 872.) For the purpose of testing the sufficiency of
the cause of action, the demurrer admits the truth of all material facts
properly pleaded. (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist. (1992) 2 Cal.4th
962, 966-967.) A demurrer “does not admit contentions, deductions or
conclusions of fact or law.” (Daar v. Yellow Cab Co. (1967) 67 Cal.2d
695, 713.) 
 
A pleading is uncertain if it is ambiguous or
unintelligible. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (f).) A demurrer for
uncertainty may lie if the failure to label the parties and claims renders the
complaint so confusing defendant cannot tell what he or she is supposed to
respond to. (Williams v. Beechnut Nutrition Corp. (1986) 185 Cal.App.3d
135, 139, fn. 2.) However, “[a] demurrer for uncertainty is strictly construed,
even where a complaint is in some respects uncertain, because ambiguities can
be clarified under modern discovery procedures.” (Khoury v. Maly’s of
California, Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.) 
 
 
DISCUSSION 
 
Meet and Confer 
 
Before filing a
demurrer, “the demurring party shall meet and confer in person or by telephone
with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the
purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve
the objections to be raised in the demurrer.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a).) 
 
            On December 2, 2024, Defendants met and conferred
Plaintiff via phone. However, the parties could not reach a resolution. (Castaneda
Decl. ¶ 2.) The Court finds this is sufficient to satisfy the meet and confer
requirement.
 
Timeliness
 
All opposition
papers must be served on the demurring party and filed with the court at least
nine court days before the hearing. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1005 sudb. (b).) Here, Plaintiff's opposition was filed on December
24, 2024, 4 days late.  Defendant asks
the court to deem Plaintiff’s late motion as “a failure to oppose
the motion and deemed a consent to the granting of the motion” (Reply p.
2.) The Court rejects this request and exercises its discretion to review all
submitted papers. (Iverson v. Superior Court, (1985) 167 Cal. App. 3d
544, 546.) However, the Court does take note of Plaintiff’s repeated failure to
file documents by the required deadline.
 
Motion to Strike
 
The Court sustained
the October 14, 2024, Demurrer to the FAC and gave Plaintiff 20 days to file
his amended complaint. Plaintiff filed the SAC on November 5, 2024, 2 days
late, and filed a substantial notice of errata on November 13, 2024. Defendant
argues that the Court should strike the SAC based on this late filing. (See, Leader
v. Health Industries of America Inc. (2001) 89 Cal. App. 4th 603, 613.)
 
Plaintiff’s Counsel
has filed a declaration stating that the SAC was filed late because of a
serious health condition including blood clotting in the legs.
 
Pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure section 438 subdivision (h)(4)(A), the Court may strike an
amended complaint if it is filed after the time to file has expired. Here,
given Plaintiff’s declaration, the Court finds that striking the SAC would not
be justifiable.
 
Therefore, the
Court denies the Motion to Strike the SAC.
 
Demurrer
 
Defendant the
Boeing Company Demurrers to the first and second causes of action.
 
Cause
of Action 1 – Breach of Contract
 
            “To establish a cause of action
for breach of contract, the plaintiff must plead and prove (1) the existence of
the contract, (2) the plaintiff’s performance or excuse for nonperformance, (3)
the defendant’s breach, and (4) resulting damages to the plaintiff.”  (Maxwell
v. Dolezal (2014) 231 Cal.App.4th 93, 97-98 [internal citation omitted].) For
a written contract, the plaintiff may “plead the legal effect of the contract
rather than the price language.” (Ibid.) To “plead a contract by its
legal effect, plaintiff must ‘allege the substance of its relevant terms. This
is more difficult, for it requires a careful analysis of the instrument,
comprehensiveness in statement, and avoidance of legal conclusions.’” (McKell
v. Washington Mutual, Inc. (2006) 142 Cal.App.4th 1457, 1489.)  
 
Defendant argues that Plaintiff's breach of
contract claim against Boeing is legally deficient due to insufficient
allegations, failure to plead lack of a valid contract, and the Statute of
Frauds. Plaintiff has not established the existence of a contract with Boeing
or demonstrated that the alleged email from SearchPros constitutes a binding
employment contract. The email (Exhibit A) merely acknowledges Plaintiff's
assignment to Boeing through SearchPros and does not include any terms
guaranteeing employment for a specific period or a "just cause"
termination provision. Instead, it reflects an at-will employment relationship
as presumed under California Labor Code § 2922.
 
Defendants further contend that Boeing was not
a party to any alleged contract, and Plaintiff’s work at Boeing was facilitated
as an independent contractor through SearchPros. The alleged email does not
establish an employment relationship with Boeing, and even if Plaintiff asserts
such a relationship, the email does not satisfy the elements of a binding
agreement.
 
Additionally, Defendants argue that the claim
is barred by the Statute of Frauds under Civil Code section 1624 subdivision (a)(1),
which requires contracts not to be performed within a year to be in writing and
signed by the party to be charged. The email lacks the necessary formalities
and does not guarantee a one-year term of employment. (Exhibit A.) Employment
commencing after an oral agreement and extending beyond one year is within the
Statute of Frauds. (Kraft v. Rooke (1930), 103 Cal. App. 552, 555.) Furthermore,
Plaintiff has not demonstrated any exceptions to the at-will presumption or
provided evidence of assurances for continued employment.
 
In opposition, Plaintiff argues that the
essential terms of a contract were sufficiently pleaded in the SAC and the
August 26, 2022, email. (Exhibit A.) Defendant argues that the email listed the
parties, Levent Uzkan and The Boeing Company. Contained an offer for a position
as an engineer to make 115$ an hour from September 6, 2022, to September 5,
2023. Defendant accepted this offer both by confirming the agreement and
beginning employment. Defendant also states that the email constitutes a
written memorandum under the Statute of Frauds. Last, Defendant states that the
fixed term of the contract defeats the at-will presumption under California
Labor Code section 2922. 
 
In the Court’s October 14, 2024, Minute Order,
the Court sustained the Demurrer to the FAC and found that “Exhibit A
represents an email from August 26th between Defendant and Plaintiff that
asserts that the form “Boeing Per Deim Offer Letter” is in Defendant’s
“portal.” (Complaint Exhibit A.) Exhibit A also states that Plaintiff’s start
date would be September 6, 2022, and Plaintiff’s estimated end date would be
September 5, 2023. (Exhibit A) Facts appearing in exhibits attached to the
complaint are given precedence over inconsistent allegations in the complaint.
(Moran v. Prime Healthcare Mgmt., Inc. (2016) 3 Cal.App.5th 1131,
1145-46.) Exhibit A shows that Plaintiff’s offer of employment was per diem with
an estimated end date of September 5, 2023. (Complaint Exhibit A.) Thus,
Exhibit A description of the contract takes precedence over the FAC’s
allegation of a durational contract for 364 days. Therefore, Plaintiff was an
at-will employee who could be fired without good cause. (Labor Code, § 2922.)
Accordingly, Plaintiff has not pleaded sufficient facts to show that Defendant
breached the contract.” (October 14, 2024, Minute Order.)
 
Plaintiffs SAC fails to remedy the issues that
led to the Court sustaining the Demurrer to the FAC. While the Complaint
alleges that a fixed-term contract existed, Exhibit A shows that the offer was
per diem with an estimated end date of September 5, 2023. (SAC ¶ 14,19, Exhibit
A.) Facts appearing in exhibits attached to the complaint are given precedence
over inconsistent allegations in the complaint. (Moran, supra, 3 Cal.App.5th
1131, 1145-46.) Thus, Exhibit A description of the contract takes precedence over
the FAC’s allegation of a durational contract for 364 days. Furthermore,
Plaintiffs argument that there was no at-will language in the contract is
unpersuasive given the presumption of at-will employment when no fixed term is
present. (Labor Code § 2922.) Thus, Plaintiff has not pleaded sufficient facts
to show that Defendant breached the contract. Additionally, given that this was
Plaintiff’s third attempt to state a cause of action for breach of contract,
the Court finds that there is not a reasonable possibility that the defect can
be cured by amendment. (Hendy v. Losse (1991) 54 Cal.3d 723, 742.) 
 
Therefore, the Court sustains the Demurrer to
the First Cause of Action without leave to amend.
 
            
Cause
of Action 2 – Breach of the Implied Covenant of
Fair Dealing 
 
“Every contract contains an implied covenant
of good faith and fair dealing, providing that no party to the contract will do
anything that would deprive another party of the benefits of the contract. The
implied covenant protects the reasonable expectations of the contracting
parties based on their mutual promises. The scope of conduct prohibited by the
implied covenant depends on the purposes and express terms of the contract.
Although breach of the implied covenant often is pleaded as a separate count, a
breach of the implied covenant is necessarily a breach of contract.” (Digerati
Holdings, LLC v. Young Money Entertainment, LLC (2011) 194 Cal.App.4th 873,
885 (internal citations omitted). A breach of the covenant of good faith and
fair dealing does not give rise to a cause of action separate from a cause of
action for breach of the contract containing the covenant. (Guz v. Bechtel
Nat. Inc. (2000) 24 Cal.4th 317, 327) (stating that “where breach of an
actual term is alleged, a separate implied covenant claim, based on the same
breach, is superfluous.”) 
 
Here, Plaintiff has failed to plead a breach
of contract claim. Consequently, the breach of the implied covenant of fair dealing claim
fails as well. (Guz, supra, 24 Cal.4th 317, 327)
Additionally, given that this was Plaintiff’s third attempt to state a cause of
action for breach of the implied covenant of fair dealing,
the Court finds that there is not a reasonable possibility that the defect can
be cured by amendment. (Hendy v. Losse (1991) 54 Cal.3d 723, 742.) 
 
Therefore, the Court sustains the Demurrer to
the Second Cause of Action without leave to amend.
