Roles:

  - Menuét Adams: signed the arbitration agreement on behalf of Frank, but lacked authority to do so under the DPOA

Significant Statements:
  - "The party that contends the FAA applies bears the burden to demonstrate that the arbitration agreement is in a 'contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce' . . . ." (Woolls v. Super. Ct.)
  - "In determining whether an arbitration agreement applies to a specific dispute, the court may examine only the agreement itself and the complaint filed by the party refusing arbitration [citation]. The court should attempt to give effect to the parties' intentions, in light of the usual and ordinary meaning of the contractual language and the circumstances under which the agreement was made." (Weeks v. Crow)
  - "To determine whether a contractual arbitration clause requires arbitration of a particular controversy, the controversy is first identified, and the issue is whether that controversy is within the scope of the contractual arbitration clause." (Titolo v. Cano)
  - "Doubts as to whether an arbitration clause applies to a particular dispute are to be resolved in favor of sending the parties to arbitration. The court should order them to arbitrate unless it is clear that the arbitration clause cannot be interpreted to cover the dispute." (California Correctional Peace Officers Ass'n v. State)
