RULING          The

BACKGROUND
 
            On
November 23, 2020, Plaintiff filed the complaint alleging causes of action for
premises liability, premises liability-negligence, and premises
liability-willful failure to warn against Defendants ROIC California, LLC and TJX
Incentive Sales Inc. arising from a fall outside on Defendant's property.
 
            On July 25, 2024, Defendant ROIC
California, LLC filed the instant demurrer to the Complaint.
            
            No opposition has been filed.
            
            No reply has been filed.
            
LEGAL STANDARD
 
            A demurrer can be
used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the pleading under
attack or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable. (Blank
v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) “To survive a demurrer, the complaint
need only allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action; each evidentiary
fact that might eventually form part of the plaintiff’s proof need not be
alleged.” (C.A. v. William S. Hart Union High School Dist. (2012) 
53 Cal.4th 861, 872.) For the purpose of testing the sufficiency of
the cause of action, the demurrer admits the truth of all material facts
properly pleaded. (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist. (1992) 2 Cal.4th
962, 966-967.) A demurrer “does not admit contentions, deductions or
conclusions of fact or law.” (Daar v. Yellow Cab Co. (1967) 67 Cal.2d
695, 713.) 
 
A pleading is uncertain if it is ambiguous or
unintelligible. (Code Civ. Proc., §
430.10, subd. (f).) A demurrer for uncertainty may lie if
the failure to label the parties and claims renders the complaint so confusing
defendant cannot tell what he or she is supposed to respond to. (Williams v.
Beechnut Nutrition Corp. (1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 135, 139, fn. 2.) However,
“[a] demurrer for uncertainty is strictly construed, even where a complaint is
in some respects uncertain, because ambiguities can be clarified under modern
discovery procedures.” (Khoury v. Maly’s of California, Inc. (1993) 14
Cal.App.4th 612, 616.) 
 
 
DISCUSSION 
 
            Defendant
demurrers to all three causes of action. The Complaint reads, in pertinent
part, “The Terraces at South Bay which is a mall at 28901 S Western Avenue
Rancho Palos Verdes California 90275, apn 7550-019-018 (28821 S Western Avenue
Rancho Palos Verdes California 90275) in the parking lot directly adjacent to
the Marshalls, (the "Property"), Marshalls is a retail store leasing
space at The Terraces of South Bay including the parking lot which invited
Plaintiff to shop at its retail store, when Plaintiff exited the store after
shopping, she tripped and fell and was injured as a result of inadequate
lighting at night and improper placement of a parking stop in front of the
Marshalls.” (Complaint p. 4.)
 
Meet and Confer 
 
Before filing a
demurrer, “the demurring party shall meet and confer in person or by telephone
with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the
purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve
the objections to be raised in the demurrer.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a).) 
 
            Between July 10, 2024, and July 24, 2024, Defendant made
multiple attempts to meet and confer with Plaintiff's counsel for record but
was unable to because of Plaintiff’s conduct. (Kreisman Decl. ¶ 6-10.) The
Court finds this is sufficient to satisfy the meet and confer requirement.
 
 
Cause
of Action 1 – Premises Liability 
 
The
elements of a cause of action for premises liability are the same as those for
negligence: duty, breach, causation, and damages.  (Castellon v. U.S. Bancorp¿(2013) 220
Cal.App.4th 994, 998.)  Those who own,
possess, or control property generally have a duty to exercise ordinary care in
managing the property¿to¿avoid exposing others to an unreasonable risk of harm.  (Annocki¿v. Peterson Enterprises, LLC¿(2014)
232 Cal.App.4th 32, 37.)  The existence
and scope of duty are legal questions for the court.  (Id. at p. 36.)  If there is a condition that poses a danger
to customers and others on the premises, the property owner is “under a duty to
exercise ordinary care either to make the condition reasonably safe for their
use or to give a warning adequate to enable them to avoid the harm.”  (Bridgman v. Safeway Stores, Inc.¿(1960)
53 Cal.2d 443, 446.)
 
Defendant argues
that Plaintiff's complaint fails to meet the necessary elements required to
establish a claim for premises liability. Specifically, the Complaint does not
provide specific facts demonstrating that Defendant owned, leased, occupied, or
controlled the property where the incident occurred. Instead, it relies on a
generic statement without any supporting details, merely checking a box on the form
complaint to allege that Defendant was responsible. Additionally, the Complaint
does not describe how Defendant was negligent in maintaining the property, nor
does it present facts indicating that there was a dangerous condition creating
an unreasonable risk of harm or that Defendant had actual or constructive
knowledge of such a condition. The location of the incident is also ambiguous,
leaving Defendant uncertain as to where the alleged trip and fall occurred.
Without clear facts establishing that Defendant owned or controlled the area in
question or was negligent in its maintenance, Defendant contends that the Complaint
is uncertain and insufficient to support a claim for premises liability. As a
result, Defendant requests that the court sustain its demurrer and dismiss the
premises liability cause of action.
 
Plaintiff did not
file an opposition.
 
            A demurrer “does not
admit contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law.” (Daar v.
Yellow Cab Co. (1967) 67 Cal.2d 695, 713.) 
 
            Here, Plaintiff has not pleaded sufficient facts to show that Defendant
owned, leased, or controlled the property. Instead, there is the mere
conclusion that “The defendants who negligently owned, maintained, managed and operated
the described premises were… ROIG California LLC.” (Complaint p. 4.) Therefore,
because Plaintiff has failed to allege facts that show Defendant owned or
controlled the premises, and thus, no duty existed, the Demurrer is sustained
with leave to amend as to cause of action one. (C.A,
supra, 53 Cal.4th 861, 872; (Castellon
v. U.S. Bancorp¿(2013) 220 Cal.App.4th 994, 998.)
            
Cause
of Action 2 – Premises Liability-Negligence
 
            The elements of a cause of action for premises
liability are the same as those for negligence: duty, breach, causation, and
damages.  (Castellon v. U.S. Bancorp¿(2013)
220 Cal.App.4th 994, 998.)  
 
            Defendant argues that Plaintiff's
complaint fails to meet the basic elements required for a negligence or
premises liability claim, which are the same: a legal duty of care, breach of
that duty, and proximate cause resulting in injury. (Kesner v. Superior Court
(2016) 1 Cal.5th 1132, 1159.) Defendant points out that the Complaint does
not provide specific facts demonstrating that Defendant owned, maintained, or
operated the property. Additionally, it fails to establish that Defendant had
prior knowledge of any alleged dangerous condition or describe how the premises
were hazardous or how that hazard caused Plaintiff's injuries. The Complaint
does not specify the nature of the injuries or explain what "special
relationship" existed between Plaintiff and Defendant that would create a
duty of care. Furthermore, it fails to allege that any actions or omissions by
Defendant were a substantial factor in causing Plaintiff’s harm. Defendant also
highlights that the Complaint is filled with legal conclusions but lacks actual
facts to support any cause of action, and after almost six years since the
incident, Plaintiff still has not met the basic requirements for pleading. As a
result, Defendant argues that its demurrer to the premises liability claim
based on negligence must be sustained.
 
            Plaintiff has not filed an
opposition.
 
For
the reasons discussed above, the Court sustains the demurrer to the second
cause of action with leave to amend. 
 
 
            
 
 Cause of Action 3 - Premises Liability-Willful
Failure to Warn
 
If
there is a condition that poses a danger to customers and others on the
premises, the property owner is “under a duty to exercise ordinary care either
to make the condition reasonably safe for their use or to give a warning
adequate to enable them to avoid the harm.” 
(Bridgman v. Safeway Stores, Inc.¿(1960) 53 Cal.2d 443, 446.)
            
Defendant argues
that for a premises liability claim based on a willful failure to warn, three
key elements must be alleged with specificity: (1) the defendant had actual or
constructive knowledge of a dangerous condition, (2) the defendant knew that
injury was probable (not just possible) as a result of that danger, and (3) the
defendant consciously failed to act to avoid the peril. (Berkley v. Dowds (2007)
152 Cal.App.4th 518, 528. While Plaintiff checked the box on the Complaint form
alleging that Defendant willfully failed to warn of a dangerous condition, the
complaint lacks specific or general facts supporting any of these elements.
Plaintiff does not provide details showing that Defendant had actual or
constructive notice of a dangerous condition, that Defendant knew injury was
probable, or that Defendant consciously failed to act to prevent harm. The Complaint
relies on boilerplate and conclusory allegations without factual support. As
such, Defendant argues that Plaintiff cannot establish a cause of action for
premises liability based on willful failure to warn, and therefore, the
demurrer should be sustained.
            
            Therefore, the Court sustains the
demurrer to the third cause of action with leave to amend.
