Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the demurrer filed by Defendant ROIC California, LLC is sustained with leave to amend as to all three causes of action. The judge found that the Complaint lacks specific facts to support the claims and that the Defendant did not own, lease, or control the property where the incident occurred. The judge granted the Defendant's demurrer because the Complaint failed to allege facts that show the Defendant owned or controlled the premises, and therefore, no duty existed. The judge gave the Plaintiff 20 days to amend the Complaint.
