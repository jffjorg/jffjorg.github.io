 Case Number:  21STCV42444    Hearing Date:   May 6, 2024    Dept:  52 Tentative Ruling: 
Defendant/Cross-Complainant
Michelman & Robinson, LLP’s Motion for Leave to File a First Amended
Cross-Complaint
Defendant/cross-complainant
Michelman & Robinson, LLP moves for leave to file a first amended
cross-complaint.  It seeks to add new
causes of action for equitable indemnity, comparative contribution, and
declaratory relief against a new cross-defendant: Carole Ann Crotty.
Courts
have discretion to permit an amendment to any pleading “in furtherance of
justice, and on any terms as may be proper.” (CCP § 473(a)(1).)  “This discretion should be exercised
liberally in favor of amendments, for judicial policy favors resolution of all
disputed matters in the same lawsuit.”  (Kittredge
Sports Co. v. Superior Court (1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 1045, 1047.)  Courts exercise their discretion “liberally
to permit amendment,” and “[t]he policy favoring amendment is so strong that it
is a rare case in which denial of leave to amend can be justified.”  (Howard v. County of San Diego (2010)
184 Cal.App.4th 1422, 1428.)  
Plaintiff/cross-defendant
Spitz Technologies Corporation argues the
proposed first amended cross-complaint’s new causes of action fail as a matter
of law.  In
ruling on a motion for leave to amend, courts generally do not consider the
amended pleading’s merits.  (Atkinson
v. Elk Corp. (2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 739, 760.)  The court exercises its discretion not to
consider the merits of the proposed amended cross-complaint.
 Plaintiff
also argues Michelman & Robinson, LLP unreasonably delayed seeking leave to
file a first amended cross-complaint. 
Courts have discretion to deny leave to amend when (a) the moving party
has delayed bringing the proposed amendment; and (b) the delay in seeking leave
to amend will cause prejudice to an opposing party.  (Hirsa v. Superior Court (1981) 118
Cal.App.3d 486, 490.)  Assuming
cross-complainant delayed bringing this proposed amendment, plaintiff shows
insufficient prejudice to justify denying this motion.  The trial is set for November 2024.  There is ample time to conduct any additional
discovery and to prepare for trial.
Disposition
Defendant/cross-complainant
Michelman & Robinson, LLP’s motion for leave to file a first amended
cross-complaint is granted.  Michelman
& Robinson, LLP shall file the first amended cross-complaint (attached as
Exhibit 1 to the motion) forthwith.
