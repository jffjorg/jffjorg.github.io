And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the application of Homeland Insurance Company of New York to admit Christian P. Jones as counsel pro hac vice. Jones is a lawyer licensed in another state who wants to appear in a California court on behalf of Homeland Insurance Company of New York. The judge found that Jones meets the requirements of California Rules of Court, rule 9.40(d), including being a member in good standing of all bars and with all courts in which he is admitted to practice. The judge also found that Jones has appeared in only three other actions in California in the preceding two years, which is not a significantly high number to warrant denial of the application. Therefore, the judge granted the application, allowing Jones to appear as counsel pro hac vice in the case.
