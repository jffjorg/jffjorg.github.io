The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on Plaintiff Christian Carrillo's motion to compel Cross-Defendant Mohammed Tehrani's compliance with the Court's prior discovery order and request for sanctions. The Plaintiff sought to compel Cross-Defendant to serve code-compliant responses to Plaintiff's Form Interrogatories, Set One, without objections, and to pay monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,010. However, the Judge has denied the motion, stating that the Court cannot issue an order compelling a party to comply with a court order, as it has already done so in issuing the prior order. The Judge also noted that Plaintiff has not moved for sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010, which provides a basis for imposing sanctions for misuse of the discovery process.
