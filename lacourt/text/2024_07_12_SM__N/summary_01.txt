And here is the summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on a motion to compel further responses to financial discovery and a request for monetary sanctions. The plaintiff, David Carter, moved the court to compel the defendant, Yuan Shi, to provide further responses to three requests for production, which seek documents related to profits generated by AI List Capital 1, LP, Zuma Fund, and other funds. The defendant argued that he has fully complied with the request for documents related to AI List Capital 1, LP, and that he should not be required to provide documents related to Zuma Fund or other funds because the information is unrelated to his net worth.

The court has reviewed the requests and responses and finds that the defendant has not provided responsive documents. The court grants the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to the extent that the defendant has not provided information relevant to the plaintiff's ability to prove his claims. The court orders the defendant to provide supplemental responses to the requests for production within 30 days.

The court also grants the plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions in the reduced amount of $1,860. The sanctions are payable by the defendant and defense counsel to the plaintiff and plaintiff's counsel within 30 days. The court finds that the defendant unreasonably refused to provide responsive documents, but reduces the award to take into account the relatively simple nature of the motion.
