Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge grants Plaintiff JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication in the amount of $248,672.71. The Plaintiff alleges that Sunset Art LLC defaulted on a borrowing relationship with Chase, and that Defendants Jared Najjar and Paul C Valmorbida failed to cure the default as guarantors. The Judge finds that the Plaintiff has met its burden of showing that there is no triable issue of material fact as to its claims for breach of express contract. The Defendants failed to file an opposition to the motion, which the Judge considers a concession that the motion is meritorious. Therefore, the motion is granted, and the Plaintiff shall prepare, serve, and submit a proposed judgment as per statute.
