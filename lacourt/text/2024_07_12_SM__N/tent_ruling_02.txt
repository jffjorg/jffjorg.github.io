 Case Number:  22SMCV01397    Hearing Date:   July 12, 2024    Dept:  N TENTATIVE RULINGPlaintiff Christian Carrillo’s Motion to Compel Cross-Defendant’s Compliance with the Court’s Prior Discovery Order and Request for Sanctions is DENIED.Plaintiff Christian Carrillo to give notice. REASONINGPlaintiff Christian Carrillo (“Plaintiff”) moves the Court for an order compelling Cross-Defendant Mohammed Tehrani (“Cross-Defendant”) to comply with the Court’s order dated March 27, 2024, requiring Cross-Defendant to serve code-compliant responses to Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatories, Set One, without objections, within thirty (30) days of entry of the Court’s order and to pay monetary sanctions in the reduced amount of $1,010 within thirty (30) days of entry of the Court’s order.Put simply, the Court cannot issue an order compelling a party to compel with a court order, as it has already done so in issuing the prior order in the first place. While Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010 provides a basis for imposing sanctions, including terminating, evidence, and monetary sanctions, where a party engages in the misuse of the discovery process, including disobeying a court order to provide discovery, Plaintiff has not moved for sanctions under this statute. Accordingly, Plaintiff Christian Carrillo’s Motion to Compel Cross-Defendant’s Compliance with the Court’s Prior Discovery Order and Request for Sanctions is DENIED.
