And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on Plaintiff Sopanha Chamroeun's request for default judgment. The Judge has concerns about the propriety of service upon four of the five defendants. Specifically, the Judge is unsure how Defendant Alexa Maghloubi was served at 8733 Juniper Street, as an employee indicated she does not work there. Additionally, the Judge is unsure how Defendant Seyed Maghloubi was the proper agent for service of process for Defendant Auto Zone General Auto Repair, given that Defendant Fifos Body & Fender has the same address. The Judge is also unclear about the service of process on Defendant Zia Siavashpour's address. Furthermore, the Judge finds that the Plaintiff has not sufficiently proven causation and damages, as the complaint lacks specific allegations against each defendant and the Plaintiff's declaration only states that Defendant Alexa Maghloubi rear-ended the Plaintiff's vehicle. The Judge also notes that the complaint lacks sufficient evidence to support the requested punitive damages. The Judge has continued the hearing to allow the Plaintiff to address these deficiencies.
