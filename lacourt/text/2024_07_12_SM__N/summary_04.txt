And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Plaintiff Narayan De Vera's motion for an order granting a preferential trial date. The plaintiff, who is 80 years old, seeks a preferential trial date due to his health conditions, including multiple surgeries, hospitalization, and ongoing medical care. However, the judge finds that the plaintiff has not established that his health conditions are such that a preference is necessary to prevent prejudicing his interest in the litigation. The judge notes that the report from Dr. Emmanuel and the declaration from Plaintiff's counsel do not demonstrate a clear connection between the plaintiff's health conditions and his ability to participate in the proceedings or why an expedited trial is necessary. As a result, the motion is denied.
