 Case Number:  23SMCV01369    Hearing Date:   July 12, 2024    Dept:  N TENTATIVE RULINGPlaintiff JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s Motion for Summary Judgment or, Alternatively, for Summary Adjudication of Claims is GRANTED in the amount of $248,672.71.Plaintiff JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. shall prepare, serve, and submit a proposed judgment as per statute. Costs shall be determined by statute. Attorney fees shall be determined pursuant to a noticed motion.Plaintiff JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to give notice. REASONINGPlaintiff JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (“Chase”) moves the Court for an order granting summary judgment or adjudication in its favor and against Defendants Sunset Art LLC (“Sunset Art”), Jared Najjar, and Paul C Valmorbida. No defendant has filed an opposition to Chase’s motion. While the moving party generally bears the initial burden of proof on its motion, and lack of opposition will not automatically entitle the moving party to prevail on its motion, a party’s failure to file an opposition can be considered a concession that the motion is meritorious. (See Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.)Legal StandardThe purpose of a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication “is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut through the parties’ pleadings in order to determine whether, despite their allegations, trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute.” (Aguilar v. Atl. Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) “On a motion for summary judgment, the initial burden is always on the moving party to make a prima facie showing that there are no triable issues of material fact.” (Scalf v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1519.) A defendant moving for summary judgment or summary adjudication “has met his or her burden of showing that a cause of action has no merit if the party has shown that one or more elements of the cause of action . . . cannot be established, or that there is a complete defense to the cause of action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2).) “Once the defendant . . . has met that burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff . . . to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to the cause of action or a defense thereto.” (Ibid.) “If the plaintiff cannot do so, summary judgment should be granted.” (Avivi v. Centro Medico Urgente Med. Ctr. (2008) 159 Cal.App.4th 463, 467 (Avivi).)“Code of Civil Procedure section 437c, subdivision (c), requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment if all the evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence’ and uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” (Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.) “[T]he court must consider all of the evidence set forth in the papers (except evidence to which the court has sustained an objection) . . . in the light most favorable to the party opposing summary judgment.” (Avivi, supra, 159 Cal.App.4th at p. 467; see also Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (c).)AnalysisChase alleges that on March 12, 2015, Sunset Art entered into a borrowing relationship with Chase by executing a Line of Credit Note and Credit Agreement in the amount of $250,000.00. (Compl. ¶ 7, Ex. A.) On the same date, Najjar executed a Continuing Guaranty (“the Najjar guaranty”), guaranteeing repayment of the contract (Compl. ¶ 8, Ex. B), and Valmorbida also executed a Continuing Guaranty (“the Valmorbida guaranty”), guaranteeing repayment of the contract (Compl. ¶ 9, Ex. C). Plaintiff alleges Sunset Art has defaulted under the terms of the contract such that there is now due and owing to Chase $247,778.91, plus late fees and costs, and Defendants Najjar and Valmorbida have failed to cure Sunset Art’s default pursuant to their guarantees such that they are also in default under the guarantees. (Compl. ¶¶ 10-11.) Chase alleges causes of action for breach of express contract, money lent, and account stated. It voluntarily dismissed its money lent and account stated claims on December 15, 2023.To establish a cause of action for breach of contract, Chase must be able to establish “(1) the existence of the contract, (2) plaintiff’s performance or excuse for nonperformance, (3) defendant’s breach, and (4) the resulting damages to the plaintiff.” (Oasis West Realty, LLC v. Goldman (2011) 51 Cal.4th 811, 821.) Chase provides evidence that on March 13, 2015, Sunset Art entered into a borrowing relationship with Chase by executing a Line of Credit Note and Credit Agreement in the amount of $250,000.00. (Chase’s UMF No. 1.) On the same date, Najjar executed the Najjar guaranty, and Valmorbida executed the Valmorbida guaranty. (Chase’s UMF Nos. 2-3.) Sunset Art has failed to pay under the terms of the contract, has defaulted, and there is now due and owing to Chase $247,778.91, plus late fees and costs of $893.80 for a total of $248,672.71. (Chase’s UMF No. 5.) Defendants Najjar and Valmorbida have failed to cure Sunset Art’s default pursuant to their guarantees such that they are also in default under the guarantees. (Chase’s UMF Nos. 6-7.)This evidence allows Chase to meet its burden of establishing that there is no triable issue of material fact as to its claims for breach of express contract. While the date of the contracts is different than that alleged in the complaint, the documents attached to the complaint showed an execution date of March 13, 2015, and it is axiomatic that exhibits control when there is a conflict between a complaint’s allegations and exhibits attached to the complaint. (Panterra GP, Inc. v. Superior Court (2022) 74 Cal.App.5th 697, 712, fn. 13.) No defendant has opposed the present motion, thereby failing to establish that a triable issue of material fact exists as to Chase’s claims. Accordingly, Plaintiff JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s Motion for Summary Judgment or, Alternatively, for Summary Adjudication of Claims is GRANTED in the amount of $248,672.71. Plaintiff JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. shall prepare, serve, and submit a proposed judgment as per statute. Costs shall be determined by statute. Attorney fees shall be determined pursuant to a noticed motion.
