**Significant Statements**
```
The doctrine of res judicata prevents relitigation of the same cause of action in a second suit between the same parties or parties in privity with them.
The doctrine of collateral estoppel provides that an issue necessarily decided in prior litigation may be conclusively determined as against the parties or their privies in a subsequent lawsuit on a different cause of action.
An implied-in-fact contract is one in which the promise is not expressed in words but is implied from the promisor's conduct.
Plaintiff's claims appear to be barred by res judicata and collateral estoppel, and also suffer from additional deficiencies which must be cured should Plaintiff successfully cure his claim as to preclusion.

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's complaint and sustaining the defendant's demurrer. The plaintiff, Steven E. Greer, had brought a lawsuit against Tucker Carlson, alleging that Carlson had used Greer's ideas on his TV show without paying him. The judge found that the plaintiff's claims were barred by the doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel, as the same issues had been previously adjudicated against the plaintiff in a previous lawsuit.

The judge also found that the plaintiff's breach of contract claim was deficient, as it did not show mutual assent or consideration by the defendant. Additionally, the judge found that the plaintiff's claim for violation of Business and Professions Code section 17200 was duplicative of his breach of contract claim and was preempted by the United States Copyright Act.

The judge granted the defendant's request for judicial notice of 14 court records from previous lawsuits in the Southern District of New York. The judge gave the plaintiff 20 days to amend his complaint to cure the deficiencies identified in the tentative ruling.
