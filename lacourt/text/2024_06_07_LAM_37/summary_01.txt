**Tentative Ruling**

**Case Number:** 22STCV37953
**Case Name:** Jacob Shaw v. Honda Performance Development, Inc., et al.

**Summary:**

This tentative ruling addresses the demurrer filed by Defendant Honda Performance Development, Inc. (Honda) to the First Amended Complaint (FAC) filed by Plaintiff Jacob Shaw. The FAC alleges various causes of action under the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA), the California Family Rights Act (CFRA), and Labor Code sections 233 and 234.

**Demurrer Ruling:**

The court has reviewed the demurrer and finds that some of the causes of action are properly pleaded, while others are not. Specifically:

1. The demurrer to the second cause of action (Failure to Engage in the Interactive Process) is sustained with leave to amend.
2. The demurrer to the third cause of action (Failure to Accommodate) is sustained with leave to amend.
3. The demurrer to the fifth cause of action (Violation of the California Family Rights Act) is sustained with leave to amend.
4. The demurrer to the sixth cause of action (Failure to Prevent Discrimination and Harassment) is overruled.

**Additional Findings:**

1. The court finds that the plaintiff has pled sufficient facts alleging that Honda's decision to not renew Plaintiff's contract was motivated by Plaintiff's disability/or perceived disability relating to his health.
2. The court holds that Plaintiff's CFRA claim based on interference cannot be premised solely on the fact that the employer failed to provide notice. Plaintiff must allege facts to show that Honda's failure to provide CFRA notice interfered with his right to take leave or prejudiced him in some way.

**Conclusion:**

The demurrer is sustained with leave to amend as to some of the causes of action, and overruled as to others. The parties are directed to file a stipulation and order reflecting the court's tentative ruling by [insert date].
