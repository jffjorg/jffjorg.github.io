Background
 
On December 5, 2022, Jacob Shaw
(“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint against Honda Performance Development, Inc
(“Honda”).; Experis US, Inc.; Experis US, LLC (together “Experis”); Manpower
Group US, Inc. (“Manpower”) (collectively “Defendants”) and Does 1 to
50.  
 
On
May 12, 2023, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint.  
 
On
July 7, 2023, the parties stipulated to allow Plaintiff to file the operative
Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”) alleging fourteen causes of action: (1)
disability discrimination, (2) failure to engage in the interactive process,
(3) failure to accommodate disability, (4) retaliation in violation of Gov.
Code § 12940(m)(2), (5) violation of the California Family Rights Act, (6)
failure to prevent discrimination and harassment, (7) wrongful termination in
violation of public policy; (8) failure to pay overtime wages; (9) failure to
provide meal periods, (10) failure to authorize and permit rest periods, (11)
failure to pay all wages due upon separation, (12) failure to furnish accurate
itemized wage statements, (13) failure to maintain required records, and (14)
unfair and unlawful business practices.  
 
On October 4, 2023, the
court granted Plaintiff’s Motion for Leave to file a Third Amended Complaint
(“TAC”). The TAC alleges fifteen causes of action: (1) disability discrimination, (2) failure to engage in
the interactive process, (3) failure to accommodate disability, (4) retaliation
in violation of Gov. Code § 12940(m)(2), (5) violation of the California Family
Rights Act, (6) failure to prevent discrimination and harassment, (7)
violation of Labor Code section 233 and 234, (8) wrongful termination in
violation of public policy; (9) failure to pay overtime wages; (10) failure to
provide meal periods, (11) failure to authorize and permit rest periods, (12)
failure to pay all wages due upon separation, (13) failure to furnish accurate
itemized wage statements, (14) failure to maintain required records, and (15)
unfair and unlawful business practices.  
 
On November 15, 2023,
the demurrer with motion to strike to the first to seventh and ninth through
fifteenth cause of action was sustained with leave to amend. On December 15,
2024, Plaintiff filed the operative Fourth Amended Complaint (4AC) alleging the
same fifteen causes of action as the TAC. 
 
On January 17, 2024,
Defendant Honda filed a demurrer with a motion to strike the 4AC. Plaintiff has
filed opposition papers. The matter is now before the court. 
 
discussion
 
I.         Legal Standard
 
A.        Demurrer 
 
A demurrer is an
objection to a pleading, the grounds for which are apparent from either the
face of the complaint or a matter of which the court may take judicial notice.
(CCP § 430.30(a); see also Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.)¿“To
survive a demurrer, the complaint need only allege facts sufficient to state a
cause of action; each evidentiary fact that might eventually form part of the
plaintiff’s proof need not be alleged.”¿(C.A. v. William S. Hart Union High
School Dist. (2012) 53 Cal.4th 861, 872.)¿For the purpose of
testing the sufficiency of the cause of action, the demurrer admits the truth
of all material facts properly pleaded.¿ (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist. (1992)
2 Cal.4th 962, 966-967.)¿A demurrer “does not admit contentions, deductions or
conclusions of fact or law.”¿(Daar v. Yellow Cab Co. (1967) 67
Cal.2d 695, 713.)¿¿ 
 
B.        Motion to Strike 
 
¿Any party, within the time allowed to respond to a pleading
may serve and file a notice of motion to strike the whole or any part thereof.
(CCP § 435(b)(1); CRC, rule 3.1322(b).) The court may, upon a motion or at any
time in its discretion and upon terms it deems proper: (1) strike out any
irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading; or (2) strike
out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the
laws of California, a court rule, or an order of the court. (CCP § 436(a)-(b); Stafford
v. Shultz (1954) 42 Cal.2d 767, 782 [“Matter in a pleading which is not
essential to the claim is surplusage; probative facts are surplusage and may be
stricken out or disregarded”].)¿¿¿¿ 
 
C.        Leave to Amend 
 
“Where the defect raised by a motion to strike or by demurrer
is reasonably capable of cure, leave to amend is routinely and liberally
granted to give the plaintiff a chance to cure the defect in question.” (CLD
Construction, Inc. v. City of San Ramon (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 1141, 1146.)
The burden is on the complainant to show the Court that a pleading can be
amended successfully. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.)¿¿¿ 
 
II.        Demurrer[1]
 
A.        Plaintiff
Has Alleged a Disability Covered by FEHA
 
Defendant Honda alleges that Plaintiff
has failed to plead a disability under FEHA. “Physical disability under FEHA
includes ‘[h]aving any physiological disease, disorder, condition, cosmetic
disfigurement, or anatomical loss that” both affects one or more of the body's
major systems and “[l]imits a major life activity.’ (Gov. Code § 12926(m)(1).)
Major life activity is ‘broadly construed’ and includes working. [Citation.]” (Soria v. Univision Radio Los Angeles, Inc. (2016) 5
Cal.App.5th 570, 584.) In considering the limitations of a disability on a
major life activity “ ‘Limits’ shall be determined without regard to mitigating
measures, such as medications, assistive devices, or reasonable accommodations,
unless the mitigating measure itself limits a major life activity.” (Gov. Code,
§ 12926(j)(1)(A).)
 
The 4AC alleges that in or about October
2021, Plaintiff “began to suffer from persistent and chronic heartburn, acid
reflux symptoms and cyclical vomiting.” (4AC, ¶ 25.) Plaintiff stated he was
“sick in his stomach in the mornings” and lost a significant amount of weight.
(4AC, ¶ 25.) Plaintiff told Honda that he suspected he had a stomach ulcer.
(4AC, ¶ 26.) It was not until January 2022, that “Plaintiff was diagnosed with and/or
treated for persistent gastroesophageal reflux disease with esophagitis,
cyclical vomiting syndrome and/or anxiety and depression.” (4AC, ¶ 27.) “These
impairments limited Plaintiff’s major life activities including, but not
limited to, eating, sleeping and working.” (4AC, ¶ 27.) The court finds that Plaintiff’s
“persistent gastroesophageal reflux
disease with esophagitis” and/or “anxiety and depression” are mental and
physical disorders that impact a major life activity, including Plaintiff’s
ability to travel for work. (4AC, ¶¶ 27, 28.) 
 
Accordingly, the demurrer based on
Plaintiff’s lack of a FEHA disability is overruled. 
 
B.        Demurrer
Based on Failure to Exhaust Administrative Remedies
 
“An employee who wishes to file suit
under the FEHA must exhaust the administrative remedy provided by the statute
by filing a complaint with the DFEH, and must obtain from the [DFEH] a notice
of right to sue. [Citation.] The timely filing of an administrative complaint
before the DFEH is a prerequisite to the bringing of a civil action for
damages.” (Pollock v. Tri-Modal Distribution Services, Inc. (2021) 11
Cal.5th 918, 931 [internal quotation marks omitted]; Gov. Code, § 12960.) “It is plaintiff's burden to plead and prove the
timely filing of the DFEH complaint.”(Jumaane v. City of Los Angeles
(2015) 241 Cal.App.4th 1390, 1402.)
 
Defendants demur to Plaintiffs’ second
and sixth causes of action on the basis that Plaintiff’s FEHA complaint “does not mirror each FEHA-based cause of
action in Plaintiffs’ civil complaint.” (Demurrer, at p. 16:13-14 [bold
original].) Specifically, the FEHA Complaint fails to allege claims for Failure
to Engage in the Interactive Process and Failure to Prevent Discrimination and
Harassment. (Demurrer, at p. 16:15-18.) In opposition, Plaintiff asserts the
FEHA complaint alleged claims for Disability Discrimination and Failure to
Accommodate such that the claims for Failure to Engage in the Interactive
Process and Failure to Prevent Discrimination are necessarily implicated. 
 
“The administrative exhaustion
requirement is satisfied if FEHA claims in a judicial complaint are ‘like and
reasonably related to’ those in the DFEH complaint [citation] or ‘likely to be
uncovered in the course of a DFEH investigation’ [citation].” (Clark v. Superior Court (2021) 62 Cal.App.5th 289, 301
[internal quotation marks omitted].) The court finds that the second and sixth
causes of action are reasonably related to the claims alleged in Plaintiff’s
original DFEH Complaint and Plaintiff’s 4AC is not required to mirror exactly
the claims alleged in the DFEH Complaint. The demurrer on this basis is
overruled. 
 
C.        Second
Cause of Action - Failure to Engage in the Interactive Process
 
Under FEHA, an employer is liable if they
“fail to engage in a timely, good faith,
interactive process with the employee or applicant to determine effective
reasonable accommodations, if any, in response to a request for reasonable
accommodation by an employee or applicant with a known physical or mental
disability or known medical condition.” (Gov. Code, § 12940(n).) “Typically, an applicant or employee
triggers the employer's obligation to participate in the interactive process by
requesting an accommodation. (§ 12940, subd. (n).) Although it is the
employee's burden to initiate the process, no magic words are necessary, and
the obligation arises once the employer becomes aware of the need to consider
an accommodation.” (Gelfo
v. Lockheed Martin Corp.
(2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 34, 62, fn. 22 (Gelfo).) “Nonetheless, an employer's duty to accommodate is
inextricably linked to its obligation to engage in a timely, good faith
discussion with an applicant or employee whom it knows is disabled, and who has
requested an accommodation, to determine the extent of the individual's
limitations, before an individual may be deemed unable to work.” (Id. at
p. 61.) 


Defendant Honda alleges that the second cause
of action fails because Honda was not aware of Plaintiff’s digestive condition.
The 4AC alleges that in December 2021, Plaintiff told Honda that he believed he
had a stomach ulcer and that “he may need an accommodation of a flexible start
time at work.” (4AC, ¶ 27.) Plaintiff does not allege that in 2021, he
requested a flexible start time and Honda failed to engage in the interactive
process to determine if a flexible start time was a reasonable accommodation. 
It was not until January 2022 that Plaintiff
was diagnosed with his disability symptoms. (4AC, ¶ 27.) Plaintiff alleges that
“Plaintiff advised Defendant Honda that he
was not able to travel for work” and that he “requested an accommodation of not
traveling and the opportunity to support offsite work from Defendant Honda’s
worksite or from home.” (4AC, ¶ 28.) However, the 4AC fails to allege that
Defendant Honda failed to provide the requested accommodations of leave and
travel restrictions. 
 
“Section 12940(n), which requires proof of failure to engage
in the interactive process, is the
appropriate cause of action where the employee is
unable to identify a specific, available reasonable accommodation while in the
workplace and the employer fails to engage in a good faith interactive process
to help identify one, but the employee is able to identify a specific,
available reasonable accommodation through the litigation process.” (Nadaf-Rahrov v. Neiman Marcus Group, Inc. (2008) 166
Cal.App.4th 952, 983 (Nadaf-Rahrov).) Here, Plaintiff’s requested
accommodations “in the form of travel
limitations and time off from work to seek medical treatment.” (4AC, ¶ 80.) The
4AC alleges facts that show that the requested accommodations were granted,
although begrudgingly. “Plaintiff’s supervisors and managing agents Pierre Descamps
and Masatsugu Endo, were angry with Plaintiff because of his inability to
travel and his need for accommodation.” (4AC, ¶ 30.) “[A]n employer must engage in an informal
interactive process aimed at effecting a reasonable accommodation, and provide
a necessary and reasonable accommodation to an applicant or an employee whom it
regards as physically disabled.” (Gelfo, supra, 140 Cal.App.4th
at p. 29.) 
 
As the 4AC alleges facts that suggest
that Plaintiff’s requested accommodation of leave and time off were granted,
Defendant Honda is not required to hold an interactive process meeting when an
accommodation has been identified and granted. “[T]he interactive process is an informal process designed to identify a reasonable accommodation
that will enable the employee to perform his or her job effectively[.]” (Swanson v. Morongo Unified School Dist. (2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 954, 971.) The fact that Plaintiff
believes he experienced retaliation by his contract not being renewed because
he requested accommodations and/or because of his actual or perceived
disability, are facts that give rise to separate causes of action not
encompassed in a claim for failure to engage in the interactive process. 
 
Therefore, the demurrer to the second
cause of action is sustained with leave to amend. 
 
D.        Third
Cause of Action – Failure to Accommodate
 
“The elements of a failure to accommodate
claim are (1) the  plaintiff has a
disability under the FEHA, (2) the plaintiff is qualified to perform the
essential functions of the position, and (3) the employer failed to reasonably
accommodate the plaintiff's disability.” (Scotch v. Art Institute of
California (2009) 173 Cal.App.4th 986, 1009–1010.) “Where a necessary accommodation is obvious, where the
employee requests a specific and available reasonable accommodation that the
employer fails to provide, or where an employer participates in a good faith
interactive process and identifies a reasonable accommodation but fails to
provide it, a plaintiff may sue under section 12940(m).” (Nadaf-Rahrov,
supra, 166 Cal.App.4th at p. 983.)
 
Defendant Honda demurs to the third cause
of action on the basis Plaintiff fails to allege that Defendant Honda failed to
accommodate his request for time off. The 4AC alleges that “Plaintiff requested reasonable
accommodations in the form of travel limitations and time off from work to seek
medical treatment.” (4AC, ¶ 80.) The 4AC alleges that “Defendant
Honda deferred issues regarding time off and leaves of absences to Defendants
Experis and/or Manpower.” (4AC, ¶ 29.) “Defendants, including Plaintiff’s supervisors
and managing agents Pierre Descamps and Masatsugu Endo, were angry with
Plaintiff because of his inability to travel and his need for accommodation.”
(4AC, ¶ 30.) 
 
The 4AC fails to specifically allege that
Defendant Honda denied Plaintiff’s request for time off and leaves of absence.
In a conclusory manner, and without facts, Plaintiff alleges “Defendants, and
each of them, engaged in unlawful employment practices in violation of
Government Code section 12940(m) by failing to make reasonable accommodation
for Plaintiff’s known disability or perceived disability” and “Defendants
failed and refused to accommodate Plaintiff’s needs based on his disabilities
or perceived disability.” (4AC, ¶¶ 79, 80.) “These conclusionary allegations, which allege no
specific acts, are insufficient to survive demurrer.” (Bagatti v. Department
of Rehabilitation (2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 344, 366, fn. 8.) 
 
In opposition, Plaintiff argues he is not
required to list every possible accommodation Defendants failed to provide.
This proposition is without merit. 
 
“An
employee cannot necessarily be expected to identify and request all possible
accommodations during the interactive process itself because ‘ “ ‘[e]mployees
do not have at their disposal the extensive information concerning possible
alternative positions or possible accommodations which employers have....’ ” ’
” [Citation.] But the employee should be able to identify specific, available
reasonable accommodations through the litigation process, and particularly by
the time the parties have conducted discovery and reached the summary judgment
stage. [Citation.]
 
(Nealy v. City of Santa Monica (2015) 234 Cal.App.4th 359, 379.) 
 
That Plaintiff need not identify every
possible accommodation at the pleading stage does not negate the fact Plaintiff
is still required to allege facts showing a reasonable accommodation did
in fact exist and Defendants failed to provide it. “A complaint must set forth the facts
with sufficient precision to put the defendant on notice about what the
plaintiff is complaining and what remedies are being sought.”  (Leek v.
Cooper (2011) 194 Cal.App.4th 399, 415.) The 4AC is devoid of facts showing that
Plaintiff requested other accommodations, other than leave and travel
restrictions, that were not provided by Defendants. 
 
Therefore, the demurrer to the
third cause of action is sustained with leave to amend. 
 
E.        Fourth Cause of Action – Retaliation in
Violation of Gov. Code § 12940(m)(2)
 
To establish a cause of action
for FEHA retaliation (third cause of action), a plaintiff must establish “(1)
they engaged in activities protected by the FEHA (2) their employers
subsequently took adverse employment action against them, and (3) there was a
causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse employment
action.” (Miller v. Department of Corrections (2005) 36 Cal.4th 446,
472.) An employee engages in protected activity when they have “opposed any
practices forbidden under [the FEHA] or because the person has filed a
complaint, testified, or assisted in any proceeding under [the FEHA].” (Gov.
Code, § 12940(h).) “[I]n addition to the employee protections provided pursuant
to subdivision (h), retaliate or otherwise discriminate against a person for
requesting accommodation under this subdivision, regardless of whether the
request was granted.” (Gov. Code, § 12940(m)(2).)
 
Defendant Honda demurs to the
fourth cause of action on the bases that Plaintiff fails to plead facts to show
a causal connection between his request for accommodation and the non-renewal
of Plaintiff’s employment because almost 8-months passed between Plaintiff’s
initial request and the non-renewal of Plaintiff’s employment. “The cases that
accept mere temporal proximity between an employer's knowledge of protected
activity and an adverse employment action as sufficient evidence of causality
to establish a prima facie case uniformly hold that the temporal proximity must
be ‘very close,’ [citation].” (Clark County School Dist. v. Breeden
(2001) 532 U.S. 268, 273–274.) 
 
The 4AC does not rely solely on
temporal proximity to allege causation “Temporal proximity does not alone
satisfy this burden.” (Nadaf-Rahrov, supra, 166 Cal.App.4th at p.
990.) “It is well established that a plaintiff in a retaliation case need only
prove that a retaliatory animus was at least a substantial or motivating factor
in the adverse employment decision.”(George v. California Unemployment Ins.
Appeals Bd. (2009) 179 Cal.App.4th 1475, 1492.) 
 
The 4AC alleges facts to show a
retaliatory animus. “Defendants, including Plaintiff’s supervisors and managing
agents Pierre Descamps and Masatsugu Endo, were angry with Plaintiff because of
his inability to travel and his need for accommodation.” (4AC, ¶ 30.)
“Masatsugu Endo in front of other employees at Defendant Honda questioned
whether Plaintiff was sick and falsely accused Plaintiff of making an excuse so
that he did not need to travel.” (4AC, ¶ 31.) “Defendants continued to
criticize Plaintiff’s absences related to his health conditions and need for
accommodation and referred to him as ‘lazy.’ ” (4AC, ¶ 34.) In June of 2022,
Plaintiff informed Defendant Honda that despite various projects and upcoming
shop visits that would require trave, the was still suffering symptoms from his
disability. (4AC, ¶ 39.) “In or about June 2022, Gray Warren of Defendants
Experis and/or Manpower contacted Plaintiff and advised him that Defendant
Honda was not renewing his contract.” (4AC, ¶ 38.) Defendants also “refused to
consider Plaintiff for open positions.” (4AC, ¶ 38.) 
 
Based on the above allegations,
the court finds that  Defendant Honda was
aware of Plaintiff’s health condition, that Plaintiff’s health condition had
not improved, and said considerations were a substantial factor in Honda’s
decision to not renew Plaintiff’s contract and not offer him other open
positions. 
 
Accordingly, the demurrer to
the fourth cause of action is overruled. 
 
F.        Fifth Cause of Action – Violation of the
California Family Rights Act 
 
The California Family Rights Act (“CFRA”) makes it unlawful for an employer “to
interfere with, restrain, or deny the exercise of, or the attempt to exercise,
any right” provided by CFRA. (Gov. Code, § 12945.2(q).) “Any violation of CFRA or these implementing
regulations constitutes interfering with, restraining, or denying the exercise
of rights provided by CFRA.” (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 2, § 11094.) “CFRA interference claim ‘consists of the following
elements: 1) the employee's entitlement to CFRA leave rights; and (2) the
employer's interference with or denial of those rights.’ ” (Moore v. Regents of University of California (2016) 248
Cal.App.4th 216, 250 (Moore).)
“An interference claim under CFRA does not
invoke the burden shifting analysis of the McDonnell Douglas test.” (Id.
at p. 250.) 
 
“The elements of a cause of action for
retaliation in violation of CFRA are: ‘(1) the defendant was an employer
covered by CFRA; (2) the plaintiff was an employee eligible to take CFRA leave;
(3) the plaintiff exercised her right to take [leave] for a qualifying CFRA
purpose; and (4) the plaintiff suffered an adverse employment action, such as
termination, fine, or suspension, because of her exercise of her right to CFRA
[leave].’ [Citation.] Similar to causes of action under FEHA, the McDonnell Douglas burden shifting analysis applies to
retaliation claims under CFRA.” (Moore, supra, 248 Cal.App.4th at
p. 248.) Defendants first demurrer to the fifth cause of action on the basis
that Plaintiff has not pled that CFRA applied to Honda. However, the 4AC
alleges that “Plaintiff was an
employee eligible to take leave and Defendants were employers covered under the
California Family Rights Act (“CFRA”).” (4AC, ¶ 99.) 
 
Next, Defendants demur to the fifth cause
of action on the basis that Plaintiff fails to allege that “Plaintiff’s mild
acid reflux condition (never actually diagnosed by a medical professional) was
so severe that it prevented him from working.” (Demurrer, at p. 19:3-4.) A claim for retaliation or interference
with CFRA requires that the plaintiff prove they were entitled to take CFRA
leave. “CFRA's regulations provide that, for an employee to be entitled to a
medical leave for her own serious health condition, the condition must cause
her to be unable to work at all or unable to perform one or more of the
essential functions of her position.” (Neisendorf v. Levi Strauss
& Co. (2006) 143 Cal.App.4th 509, 516–517; see Gov. Code, §
12945.2(b)(C) [“Leave because of an employee's own serious health condition
that makes the employee unable to perform the functions of the position of that
employee, except for leave taken for disability on account of pregnancy,
childbirth, or related medical conditions.”].) “ 
 
While Plaintiff
alleges he had a “serious health condition,” the 4AC fails to allege that Plaintiff
was entitled to CFRA leave. (4AC, ¶ 104.) “Indeed, the statutory language of
the CFRA reveals that it is not triggered by a mere notice that a [plaintiff]
has a serious medical condition.” (Stevens v. California Dept. of
Corrections (2003) 107 Cal.App.4th 285, 291.) Plaintiff fails to
cite case law to support the finding that “continuing treatment by a health
care provider”  or having a “serious
medical condition” are sufficient to establish that Plaintiff is entitled to
leave under CFRA because he was unable to perform the functions of his
position. (4AC, ¶ 104.)
 
Plaintiff further
argues that Honda failed to provide notice of CFRA and inform Plaintiff of his
rights under CFRA. “Defendants, and each of them, engaged
in unlawful employment practices in violation of the CFRA by failing to
properly notify Plaintiff of his rights in regards to the CFRA; and/or
interfering with, restraining, discouraging and/or denying the exercise of
Plaintiff’s right to take leave for his serious health condition.” (4AC, ¶
105.) The 4AC further alleges that “Defendants knew of Plaintiff’s serious
health conditions, but during this time, Defendants did not advise Plaintiff of
his rights under the California Family Rights Act, including his right to take
intermittent leave to seek treatment for his serious health conditions.” (4AC,
¶ 34.)
 
“Employers subject
to the CFRA are required to provide notice to their employees of the right to
request CFRA leave. (Moore, supra, 248 Cal.App.4h at p.
252.) “This is because ‘[a] failure to notify an employee of his rights under
FMLA [and thus CFRA] can constitute interference if it affects [the employee's]
rights under [the statute].’ ” (Id. a p. 253 citing Alcala v. Best Buy Stores, LP (C.D. Cal., Nov. 7, 2012,
No. EDCV 11-00798-JVS) 2012 WL 6138332, at *13 [“A failure to notify an
employee of his rights under FMLA can constitute interference if it affects his
rights under FMLA, although there is no relief unless the employee was prejudiced by the violation”].)
“Failure of the employer to give or post the required notice regarding an
employee's right to request CFRA leave precludes an employer ‘from taking any
adverse action against the employee, including denying CFRA leave, for failing
to furnish the employer with advance notice of a need to take CFRA leave.’
(Cal. Code Regs., tit. 2, § 11091, subd. (a)(5).)” (Bareno v.
San Diego Community College Dist. (2017) 7 Cal.App.5th 546, 559.) 
 
Plaintiff’s CFRA claim based on
interference cannot be premised solely on the fact that the employer failed to
provide notice. Plaintiff’s must allege facts to show that Honda’s failure to
provide CFRA notice interfered with his right to take leave or prejudiced him
in some way. In other words, Plaintiff must allege that had he known about his
CFRA rights, he would have taken CFRA leave. As the fifth cause of action fails
to allege such facts, the demurrer to the fifth cause of action is sustained
with leave to amend. 
 
The demurrer to the
fifth cause of action is sustained with leave to amend. 
 
G.        Sixth Cause of Action - Failure to
Prevent Discrimination and Harassment
 
The FEHA makes it unlawful
employment practice “[f]or an employer ... to fail to take all reasonable steps
necessary to prevent discrimination and harassment from occurring.” (Gov. Code.
§ 12940(k).)
 
A cause of action for
failure to prevent discrimination or harassment includes the following
elements: (1) actionable discrimination or harassment by employees or
non-employees; (2) defendant’s legal duty of care toward plaintiff (defendant
is plaintiff’s employer); (3) breach of duty (failure to take all reasonable
steps necessary to prevent discrimination and harassment from occurring); (4)
legal causation; and (5) damages to plaintiff.  (See Trujillo v. North
County Transit District(1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 280, 287, 289.) Defendant
Honda demurs to the sixth cause of action on the basis there was no
discrimination because Plaintiff’s request for accommodations were deferred to
Manpower and Experis. (4AC, ¶ 29.) 
 
The 4AC alleges that
“Plaintiff’s
supervisors and managing agents Pierre Descamps and Masatsugu Endo, were angry
with Plaintiff because of his inability to travel and his need for
accommodation.” (4AC, ¶ 30.) “Masatsugu Endo in front of other employees at
Defendant Honda questioned whether Plaintiff was sick and falsely accused
Plaintiff of making an excuse so that he did not need to travel.” (4AC, ¶ 31.)
“Defendants continued to criticize Plaintiff’s absences related to his health
conditions and need for accommodation and referred to him as ‘lazy.’” (4AC, ¶
34.) In May or June 2022, when Plaintiff informed Honda that he still was
suffering from his “symptoms of his disability” and that if he were to travel
it would be at the cost of his health, but he would do so. (4AC, ¶ 36.) In June
2022, Plaintiff learned that Honda was not renewing his contract. (4AC, ¶ 38.) 
Based on the facts above, the
court finds that Plaintiff has pled sufficient facts alleging that Honda’s
decision to not renew Plaintiff’s contract was motivated by Plaintiff’s
disability/or perceived disability relating to his health. Therefore, the demurrer
to the sixth cause of action is overruled. 
 
H.        Seventh Cause of Action – Violation of
Lab. Code §§ 233 and 234
 
Labor
Code § 233 provides in relevant part as follows: 
 
(a) Any employer who provides
sick leave for employees shall permit an employee to use in any calendar year
the employee’s accrued and available sick leave entitlement, in an amount not
less than the sick leave that would be accrued during six months at the
employee’s then current rate of entitlement for the reasons specified in
subdivision (a) of Section 246.5. . . .
 
(c) An employer shall not deny
an employee the right to use sick leave or discharge, threaten to discharge,
demote, suspend, or in any manner discriminate against an employee for using,
or attempting to exercise the right to use, sick leave [for diagnosis, care, or
treatment of an existing health condition of, or preventive care for an
employee....] 
 
(d) Any employee aggrieved by a
violation of this section shall be entitled to reinstatement and actual damages
or one day’s pay, whichever is greater, and to appropriate equitable relief.
 
Labor
Code § 234 states: 
 
An employer absence control policy that counts sick leave
taken pursuant to Section 233 as an absence that may lead to or result in
discipline, discharge, demotion, or suspension is a per se violation of Section
233. An employee working under this policy is entitled to appropriate legal and
equitable relief pursuant to Section 233.
 
Defendant Honda
demurs to the seventh cause of action on the ground that because the Lab. Code §
233 does not mandate employers, to offer sick leave, the 4AC must specifically
allege that Honda maintained a sick leave policy, what the policy states, and
how Honda violated such policy. Honda fails to cite case law to show that such
specificity is required.
 
“To survive a demurrer, the
complaint need only allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action; each
evidentiary fact that might eventually form part of the plaintiff’s proof need
not be alleged.” (C.A. v. William S. Hart Union High School Dist. (2012)
53 Cal.4th 861, 872.) “[T]o withstand a demurrer, a complaint must allege ultimate facts,
not
evidentiary facts or conclusions of law.” (Logan v. Southern
California Rapid Transit District (1982) 136 Cal.App.3d 116, 126.) The
4AC sufficiently alleges that Defendants provided sick leave to its employees,
that Plaintiff worked sufficient hours to accrue paid sick leave, and that
Defendants violated Lab. Code §§ 233 and 234 by discriminating against
Plaintiff. (4AC, ¶¶ 127-129.) Specifically, Defendants ended Plaintiff’s
employment by refusing to renew his contract and refusing to place Plaintiff in
another position because Plaintiff attempted to or did exercise his right to
use his sick leave. (4AC, ¶ 29.) 
 
What Defendant Honda’s sick
leave policy stated is a fact that within Honda’s knowledge and questions as to
how much sick leave Plaintiff had and used, are discoverable facts that are not
essential to Plaintiff’s Labor Code claims. Defendant Honda fails to show that
Plaintiff’s sixth cause of action makes “[ ]t impossible to decipher which sections, other than
Section 233, of the Labor Code defendant allegedly violated by this pleading
and thus does not put defendant on notice of how to defend against those
allegations.” (Smith v. Level 3 Communications Inc.
(N.D. Cal., Dec. 30, 2014, No. C 14-05036 WHA) 2014 WL 7463803, at *4.) “Plaintiff pled
that he was attempting to use accrued or accumulated sick leave that he was
entitled to use. [ ]This is sufficient to state a claim, and Plaintiff
does not have to plead the specific number of days he was entitled to.”
(Scott v. Evans Adhesive Corporation (C.D. Cal., Nov.
30, 2023, No. 5:23-CV-00978-AB-PVC) 2023 WL 9421124, at *3.) 
 
Therefore, the demurrer to the
seventh cause of action is overruled. 
 
I.         Ninth to Thirteenth Causes of Action - Failure to Pay
Overtime Wages (Lab. Code §§ 510, 1194, 1198), Failure to Provide Meal Periods
(Lab. Code §§ 227.7, 512), Failure to Authorize and Permit Rest Periods (Lab.
Code § 226.7),  Failure to Pay All Wages
Due Upon Separation (Lab. Code §§ 201, 202, 203), and Failure to Furnish
Accurate Itemized Wage Statements (Lab. Code § 226.) 
 
i.          Plaintiff has a Private Right of Action to Enforce Wage and
Hour Violations under the Lab. Code
 
Defendant Honda demurs to the
ninth to thirteenth causes of action on the basis Plaintiff has no standing to
bring an action for violations of the Industrial Welfare Commission (“IWC”)
Wage Orders. (See Thurman v. Bayshore Transit Management, Inc.
(2012) 203 Cal.App.4th 1112, 1132.)
 
Plaintiff’s
opposition cites case law supporting the finding that an employee has a right
to bring a private right of action to recover wages. Although there is no
private right of action to directly enforce a wage order, claims for wage order
violations may be brought through various provisions of the California Labor
Code. (See Kennedy v. El Centro Regional Medical Center (S.D.
Cal., Mar. 29, 2023, No. 22-CV-1522 JLS (LR)) 2023 WL 6035593, at p. *3; Cole v. East Bay Municipal Utility District (N.D. Cal.,
Mar. 23, 2016, No. 16-CV-00694-TEH) 2016 WL 1139009, at p. *2; Kamar v. RadioShack Corp. (C.D. Cal., May 15, 2008, No.
CV07-2252AHM(AJWX)) 2008 WL 2229166, at pp. *4-12.) In
Cuadra v. Millan (1998)  the California Supreme Court explained that “[i]f
an employer fails to pay wages in the amount, time or manner required by
contract or by statute, the employee has two principal options. The employee
may seek judicial relief by filing an ordinary civil action
against the employer for breach of contract and/or for the wages prescribed by
statute. (§§ 218, 1194.)” (17 Cal.4th 855, 858
[italics original] disapproved of on other grounds by Samuels v. Mix (1999) 22 Cal.4th 1 .) 
 
Defendant Honda fails to cite
case law to support showing that wage and hour violations under the Labor Code
do not contain a private right of action. Accordingly, the demurrer to the
ninth and thirteenth causes of action is denied on this basis. 
 
ii.         Plaintiff Alleges Sufficient Facts to Show He was a
Non-Exempt Employee
 
Defendant Honda demurs to the
ninth and thirteenth causes of action on the basis that Plaintiff has no
standing to plead wage and hour violations because Plaintiff was a “chassis
engineer” (4AC, ¶¶ 14, 17.) and was exempt as a matter of law under the Licensed
Professional Exemption. (Cal. Code Regs. Tit. 8, §
11040(1)(A)(3)(a); Wage Order 4-2001(A)(3)(a).)
 
Defendant Honda does not
dispute that under the Licensed Professional Exemption, the employee must be
“licensed or certified by the State of California,” and must be engaged in
certain profession, including “engineering.” (Cal. Code Regs. Tit.
8, § 11040(1)(A)(3)(a); Wage Order 4-2001(A)(3)(a).) The 4AC,
alleges that “Plaintiff was also nonexempt in that he was not licensed and not
primarily engaged in exempt duties and/or did not satisfy the salary basis
test.” (4AC, ¶ 19.) The court finds that the 4AC sufficiently alleges that
Plaintiff was not a licensed engineer, and he was not an exempt worker under
the License Professional Exemption. Moreover, whether the Plaintiff is a
licensed or certified engineer is a disputed issue of fact not subject to
demurrer. (Fremont Indemnity Co. v. Fremont General Corp. (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 97, 113-114.) Accordingly, the demurrer is overruled on this basis.

 
                        iii.        Failure to Allege Specific Wage Amounts
 
Defendant
Honda demurs to the ninth to thirteenth causes of action on the basis that
Plaintiff fails to allege the specific amount of wages due to Plaintiff. (See Oppenheimer
v. Robinson (1957) 150 Cal.App.2d 420, 423 (Robinson)
[“The mere allegation
that plaintiff was damaged in the sum of $6,000 by reason of the failure to pay
the wages earned is meaningless in the absence of any allegation as to the
amount of wages due plaintiff”]; Oppenheimer v. Moebius
(1957) 151 Cal.App.2d 818, 819–820 (Moebius) [“a count for a statutory
penalty for  failure to pay wages does
not state a cause of action unless it alleges facts from which the amount of
the claimed penalty can be ascertained”].)


In opposition, Plaintiff states that the
4AC alleges that Honda has no record of the actual hours worked because
Defendants advised Plaintiff to not account for his overtime. (4AC, ¶¶ 20-21.)
“[W]here the employer has failed to keep records required by statute, the
consequences for such failure should fall on the employer, not the employee.” (Hernandez v. Mendoza (1988) 199 Cal.App.3d 721, 727.)
“[I]mprecise evidence by an employee can provide a sufficient basis for damages
when the employer fails to keep accurate records of the employee's work hours.”
(Furry v. East Bay Publishing, LLC (2018) 30 Cal.App.5th
1072, 1075.) 
 
The court agrees that Robinson and
Moebius focus on questions regarding the sufficiency of the pleading for
reasons of jurisdiction and do not stand for the proposition that Plaintiff
must plead the exact amount of wages due, especially when the burden is on
Defendants to prove they kept accurate wage statements. To hold otherwise,
would be contrary to CACI 2703. Therefore, the demurrer to the ninth and
thirteenth causes of action is overruled on this basis. 
iv.        Ninth,
Tenth, Eleventh, and Thirteenth Causes of Action are Not Barred 
 
Defendants
argue that a one-year statute of limitations applies for penalties under Lab.
Code § 226. (CCP § 340; Falk
v. Children's Hospital Los Angeles
(2015) 237 Cal.App.4th 1454, 1469.) Plaintiff asserts that the ninth, tenth,
and eleventh causes of action do not seek penalties under Lab. Code § 226.
Moreover, the thirteenth cause of action, which is premised on Lab. Code §  226, for Failure to Furnish Accurate Itemized
Wage Statements, is timely because Plaintiff’s contract was not renewed in June
2022 and Plaintiff filed this action on December 22, 2022. The court overrules
the demurrer on this basis.
 
                        v.         Demurrer to Ninth and Thirteenth Causes
of Action
 
Lastly, Defendant Honda demurs to the
ninth and thirteenth causes of action on the basis that they are inadequately
pled. As stated above, the ninth cause of action does not require Plaintiff to
plead the exact amount of wages due. 
            
As to the thirteenth cause of action, the
court finds that Plaintiff sufficiently pled that his wage statement was
inaccurate because Defendants failed “timely provide Plaintiff with accurate
itemized wage statements in writing showing each employee’s gross wages earned,
total hours worked, all deductions made, net wages earned, and all applicable
hourly rates in effect during each pay period and the corresponding number of
hours worked at each hourly rate, in violation of California Labor Code § 226.”
(4AC, ¶ 176.) The court finds that the thirteenth cause of action adequately
pleads that Defendant Honda failed to provide an accurate itemized wage
statement. 
 
J.         Fourteenth
Cause of Action – Unfair and Unlawful Business Practices 
 
Business and Professions Code § 17200
(“UCL”) prohibits “any unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business act or
practice.” (Bus. & Prof. Code, § 17200; see Clark v. Superior
Court (2010) 50 Cal.4th 605, 610.) To plead this statutory claim, the
pleadings must state with reasonable particularity the facts supporting the
statutory elements of the violation. (Khoury v. Maly's of California,
Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 619.)
 
“An unlawful business practice or
act is an act or practice, committed pursuant to business activity, that is at
the same time forbidden by law.” (Klein v. Earth Elements, Inc. (1997)
59 Cal.App.4th 965, 969.) “A business practice is unfair within the meaning of
the UCL if it violates established public policy or if it is immoral,
unethical, oppressive or unscrupulous and causes injury to consumers which
outweighs its benefits.” (McKell v. Washington Mutual, Inc. (2006) 142
Cal.App.4th 1457, 1473.) Lastly, a fraudulent business practice claim under
section 17200 “is not based upon proof of the common law tort of deceit or
deception, but is instead premised on whether the public is likely to be
deceived.” (Pastoria v. Nationwide Ins. (2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 1490,
1499.)
 
Defendant Honda demurs to the fourteenth
cause of action on the basis the 4AC fails to plead with particularity that
Honda’s actions were unlawful or unfair. Defendant Honda further asserts that
the 4AC fails to allege facts supporting restitution. The court disagrees. “ ‘What is important is that the complaint as a whole contain sufficient
facts to apprise the defendant of the
basis upon which the plaintiff is seeking relief.’ ” (Thompson v. Spitzer (2023) 90 Cal.App.5th 436, 452
[internal quotations omitted] [italics original.].) The thirteenth cause of
action incorporates Paragraphs 1 through 22 and 148 to 169, which includes wage
and hour violations under the Labor Code alleged in ninth through thirteenth
causes of action. (4AC, ¶ 175.) The court has overruled the demurrer to these
causes of action and finds that they are sufficiently pled. Moreover, the
thirteenth cause of action states that the UCL claim is premised on violations
of Lab. Code section 226.7, 510, and 1194. (4AC, ¶ 177.) 
 
The 4AC further alleges Defendants’
practices were unfair because Defendants reaped unfair and illegal profits at
the expense of Plaintiff and should be made to disgorge their ill-gotten gains.
(4AC, ¶ 181.) Under the unfair prong of the UCL, the claim may be premised on
the allegation that a business practice is unfair because the defendant's
conduct is tethered to a statutory violation. (See Graham v. Bank of America, N.A.
(2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 594, 613.) Here, Honda’s unfair business conduct is
tethered to violations of the Lab. Code. 

 
Lastly, the court finds that Plaintiff
has alleged Defendant Honda unlawfully withheld wages from Plaintiff, such that
Plaintiff is entitled to restitution. “Defendants’
unfair and unlawful business practices entitle Plaintiff to seek preliminary
and permanent injunctive relief, including but not limited to orders that
Defendants account for, disgorge, and restore to Plaintiff the wages and other
compensation unlawfully withheld from them.” (4AC, ¶ 181.) 
 
While Plaintiff may not seek restitution
for statutory penalties, he may seek restitution for unpaid wages. (See Pineda v. Bank of America, N.A. (2010) 50 Cal.4th 1389, 1401.) “We conclude that
orders for payment of wages unlawfully withheld from an employee are also a
restitutionary remedy authorized by section 17203. The employer has acquired
the money to be paid by means of an unlawful practice that constitutes unfair
competition as defined by section 17200.” (Cortez v. Purolator Air
Filtration Products Co. (2000) 23 Cal.4th 163,
177.) “[P]ayments under Section 226.7 are restitutionary because they are akin
to payment of overtime wages to an employee: both are ‘earned wages’ and thus
recoverable under the UCL.” (Tomlinson v. Indymac Bank,
F.S.B. (C.D. Cal. 2005) 359 F.Supp.2d 891, 896; Valenzuela v. Giumarra Vineyards Corp. (E.D. Cal. 2009)
614 F.Supp.2d 1089, 1103 [accord].) 
 
Accordingly, the demurrer to the fourteenth
cause of action is overruled. 
 
III.      Motion to Strike
 
Defendant Honda moves
to strike Plaintiff’s request for punitive damages as follows: 
 
1)    
Page 35, Prayer for Relief, Paragraph
5: “For punitive … damages where available by law;”
 
2)    
Pages 10, 13, 15, 18, 20, 22, 25, and
27 at Paragraphs ¶¶58, 71, 84, 95, 109, 118, 134, and 145
 
3)    
Pages 11, 14, 16, 18, 21, 23, 26, and
28 at Paragraphs ¶¶59, 72, 85, 96, 110, 119, 135, and 146. 
 
4)    
Pages 28 - 29, Paragraph ¶147. 
¿When the defendant
is a¿corporation, “the oppression, fraud, or malice must be perpetrated,
authorized, or knowingly ratified by an officer, director, or managing agent of
the¿corporation.” (Wilson v. Southern California Edison Company (2015)
234 Cal.App.4th 123, 164; see Civ. Code § 3294(b).)¿ 
 
Plaintiff
fails to point to allegations in the 4AC that show that a managing agent of
Defendant Honda engaged in the malice or oppression or how said individual
authorized or knowingly ratified the malice or oppression. The 4AC fails to
allege Pierre Descamps and Masatsugu Endo are alleged the managing agents of
Defendant Honda who the individuals who perpetrated or ratified the malice or
oppression. (4AC, ¶ 30.) Moreover, Sarah Huges and Anthony Del Preto, are
alleged to have ratified “illegal conduct” but no facts are given as to how
such conduct was knowingly ratified or that said individuals are managing
agents for Defendant Honda. 
 
Therefore, Defendant Honda’s
Motion to Strike is granted with leave to amend. 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant
Honda’s demurrer to the first, fourth, sixth, seventh, and ninth to fourteenth
causes of action are overruled and sustained with 10 days leave to amend as to
the second, third and fifth causes of action. Defendant Honda’s motion to
strike is granted with leave to amend. The court sets the OSC RE: Amended
Complaint for June 20, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. Defendant to give notice.
