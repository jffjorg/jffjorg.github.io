Disposition 


CONTINUE 


 



On August 14, 2024, after examination, the matter was
continued, pending the resubmission of corrected documents. Subsequently, on
September 11, 2024, Petitioner filed an amended Petition. 
 
Upon reviewing the amended Petition, the Court notes the
following deficiencies:
 
1.      Petitioner has not addressed the issue that the settlement
does not reflect that all medical expenses will be satisfied after judgment.
(MC-350 ¶12a.) Specifically, the “total medical expenses before
any reductions is $7,791.17 (MC-350 ¶12a(1)).
Total medical expenses paid by Medi-Cal is $760.15. (MC-350 ¶12(a)(2), Edzant
Decl. ¶ 6.) Through negotiation, Medi-Cal accepted the total sum of $570.12 for
its lien, reflecting a reduction of $190.03 (MC-350 ¶12(a)(3), Edzant Decl. ¶ 6.)
The Petition states that only $570.12 needs to be paid from the proceeds
(MC-350 ¶¶ 12(a)(4), (b)(4), and 16(b).) 
 
This results in remaining unsatisfied medical
expenses in the amount of $7,031.02 ($7,791.17 - $190.03 - $570.12 =$7,031.02).
 
2.     
Additionally, the Court observes a
discrepancy in the proposed Order to Deposit Funds in Blocked Account (the
“Proposed Order”), which states, “The total amount authorized for deposit,
including any accrued interest, is $10,583.68. (Proposed Order ¶ 4.) This
number is inconsistent with the net balance of proceeds available for claimant,
which is listed as $10,543.68. (MC-350 ¶ 15 and 16f.) 
 
Given these
deficiencies, Petitioner’s Petition is CONTINUED to clarify the remaining unsatisfied
medical expenses, and to correct the discrepancies in the total amount
authorized for deposit in the Order to Deposit Funds in Blocked Account.
 
CONCLUSION
 
Petitioner’s
Petition for Approval of Compromise of Claim for Minor Nixon Liescheidt is CONTINUED.
