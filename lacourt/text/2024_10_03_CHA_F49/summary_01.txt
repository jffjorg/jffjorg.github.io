And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed the petition filed by Scott Liescheidt, the guardian ad litem for his minor son Nixon, seeking approval of a compromise settlement with Defendant Kalani Valaree Caldera. The settlement amount is $15,000.00.

The Court notes that the settlement does not reflect that all medical expenses will be satisfied after judgment, and that there is a discrepancy in the proposed Order to Deposit Funds in Blocked Account. Therefore, the Court has decided to CONTINUE the petition to clarify the remaining unsatisfied medical expenses and to correct the discrepancies.

The Court has also reviewed the proposed order to approve the compromise settlement and the proposed order to deposit funds into a blocked account. The Court finds that the proposed orders are congruent with the petition and that the settlement amount is reasonable.

The matter is continued pending the resubmission of corrected documents and a revised proposed order.
