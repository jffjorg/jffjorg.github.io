Los Angeles Superior
Court Case No. 23CHCV02536

 
Motion
filed: 5/21/24
 
MOVING PARTY: Defendant County of Los Angeles
RESPONDING PARTY: none
NOTICE: OK
 
RELIEF
REQUESTED: An
order dismissing the instant action for Plaintiff’s failure to amend the
Complaint
 
TENTATIVE
RULING: the
Motion is GRANTED.
 
BACKGROUND
 
On August 22, 2023, Plaintiff Victor Sonora (“Plaintiff”)
initiated this action against Defendant Carl Warren & Company LLC, seeking
damages for personal injuries and property damages resulting from an accident
in which Plaintiff’s vehicle encountered a road hazard. 
 
On September 15, 2023, Plaintiff filed his First Amended
Complaint (“FAC”), substituting in Defendant County of Los Angeles
(“Defendant”) as the sole Defendant. The FAC alleges a single cause of action
for Motor Vehicle Negligence.
 
On March 6, 2024, the Court sustained a demurrer filed by Defendant
on February 5, 2024, and granting Plaintiff 30-day leave to amend. The deadline to amend passed without
Plaintiff filing an amended Complaint.
 
On May 21, 2024, Defendant filed the instant Motion to
Dismiss (the “Motion”).
 
No Opposition or Reply papers have been received by the
Court.
 
ANALYSIS
 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 581, subdivision (f)(2), states that the Court may
dismiss an action against a defendant when, “after a demurrer to the complaint
is sustained with leave to amend, the plaintiff fails to amend it within the
time allowed by the court and either party moves for dismissal.” 
            
A.    Motion
to Dismiss
 
After the Court sustained
Defendant’s Demurrer on March 6, 2024, Plaintiff was given 30 days to amend. Defendant
served the Notice of Ruling for the Demurrer on March 7, 2024, establishing the
deadline to file an amended Complaint as April 8, 2024. Plaintiff never filed
an amended Complaint. 
 
As the Court did not receive
an amended Complaint before April 8, 2024 deadline, and Defendant has properly
moved to dismiss the case, the Motion is GRANTED.
 
CONCLUSION
 
Defendant
County of Los Angeles’s Motion to Dismiss for failure to amend is GRANTED. 
 
Moving
party to give notice.
