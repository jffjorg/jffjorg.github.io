And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling to grant the defendant's motion to dismiss the case. The plaintiff, Victor Sonora, initiated the action against the original defendant, Carl Warren & Company LLC, but substituted the County of Los Angeles as the sole defendant in the first amended complaint. The court sustained a demurrer filed by the defendant, granting the plaintiff 30 days to amend the complaint. However, the plaintiff failed to file an amended complaint before the deadline. The defendant then filed a motion to dismiss the case, which the court has granted. The judge ruled that the motion is granted because the plaintiff failed to amend the complaint after the demurrer was sustained, as required by California Code of Civil Procedure section 581, subdivision (f)(2). The case is dismissed.
