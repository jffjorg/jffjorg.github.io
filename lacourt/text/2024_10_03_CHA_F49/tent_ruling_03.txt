DEMURRER 

Los Angeles Superior
Court Case No. 24CHCV01448

 
Motion
filed: 7/15/24
 
MOVING PARTY: Defendants City of Los Angeles, acting
by and through the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, and City of Los
Angeles
RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff Rade Raicevic 
NOTICE: OK.
 
RELIEF
REQUESTED: An
order sustaining Defendants’ Demurrer to Plaintiff’s Complaint
 
TENTATIVE
RULING: The Demurrer
is SUSTAINED WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND.
 
BACKGROUND
 
This action arises from alleged damage to Plaintiff’s main
water line at 17048 Sunburst Street, Sherwood Forest, California. Plaintiff Rade Raicevic (“Plaintiff” or
“Raicevic”) claims that structural damage to the main water line was caused by
Defendants’ trash collection truck on March 5, 2022.
 
On April 19, 2024, Plaintiff filed the Complaint against
Defendants Los Angeles Department of Water and Power
(“LADWP”), City of Los Angeles (“City of LA”) (collectively,
“Defendants”) and Does 1 through 10, alleging single cause of action for
General Negligence.
 
On July 15, 2024, Defendants filed the instant Demurrer to
the Complaint. Subsequently, Plaintiff filed an Opposition on August 12, 2024,
and Defendants replied on September 24, 2024.
 
ANALYSIS
 
A demurrer is an objection to a pleading, the grounds
for which are apparent from either the face of the complaint or a matter of
which the court may take judicial notice. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.30, subd.
(a); see also Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) The purpose of
a demurrer is to challenge the sufficiency of a pleading “by raising questions
of law.” (Postley v. Harvey (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 280, 286.) 
 
At the pleading stage, a plaintiff need only allege
ultimate facts sufficient to apprise the defendant of the factual basis for the
claim against them. (Semole v.
Sansoucie (1972) 28 Cal.App.3d 714, 721.) “In the
construction of a pleading, for the purpose of determining its effect, its
allegations must be liberally construed, with a view to substantial justice
between the parties.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 452.) The court “treat[s] the
demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded, but not contentions,
deductions or conclusions of fact or law[.]” (Berkley v. Dowds (2007)
152 Cal.App.4th 518, 525 (Berkley).) In applying these standards, the
court liberally construes the complaint to determine whether a cause of action
has been stated. (Picton v. Anderson Union High School Dist. (1996) 50
Cal.App.4th 726, 733.)
 
A.    Request
for Judicial Notice
 
Defendants request that the Court take judicial notice
of the following matters:
 
1.      Request
for Judicial Notice (“RJN”) No. 1: The fact that LADWP and City of LA are
public entities pursuant to California Evidence Code section 452(g).
 
2.      RJN
No. 2: Certified copy of “First Amended Complaint” previously filed by
Plaintiff in Small Claim Court, case number 23CHSC01226, and
 
3.      RJN
No. 3: Certified copy of Notice of Entry of Judgment by Small Claim Court in
the case number 23CHSC01226
 
Pursuant to California Evidence Code section 425, Judicial notice
may be taken of the following matters: “(d) Records of (1) any court of this
state or (2) any court of record of the United States or of any state of the
United States....(g)  Facts and propositions that are of such common
knowledge within the territorial jurisdiction of the court that they cannot
reasonably be the subject of dispute.”
 
            The Court GRANTS Defendants’ RJN No. 1.
 
            The Court GRANTS Defendants’ RJN Nos. 2 and 3 to the
extent that it accepts as true only that (1) they were filed, and (2) the assertions therein
were made. The Court does not take notice of the truth of their contents. (See Joslin
v. H.A.S. Ins. Brokerage (1986) 184 Cal.App.3d 369, 374-375; see also Day
v. Sharp (1975) 50 Cal.App.3d 904, 916.) 
 
B.     Meet
and Confer
 
A party filing a demurrer “shall meet and confer in person
or by telephone with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to
demurrer for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached
that would resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer.” (Code Civ.
Proc., section 430.41(a).) A failure to meet and confer does not constitute
grounds to sustain or overrule a demurrer. (See Code Civ. Proc., sections
430.41 (a)(4).)
 
Here, the requirement for meet and confer has been
satisfied. (Baik Decl. ¶ 4, Ex. “5.”)
 
C.    Demurrer
 
Defendants demur to the Complaint on
the grounds of that: (1) the Court lacks jurisdiction over the subject of the
cause of action per principle of Res Judicata, (2) Plaintiff fails to state
facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, and (3) Plaintiff’s
allegations regarding certain damages is ambiguous and unintelligible. 
 
1)     
 Res Judicata
 
“Res judicata, or claim preclusion, prevents relitigation
of the same cause of action in a second suit between the same parties or
parties in privity with them. Collateral estoppel, or issue preclusion,
‘precludes relitigation of issues argued and decided in prior proceedings.’
[Citation.] Under the doctrine of res judicata, if a plaintiff prevails in an action, the
cause of action is merged into the judgment and may not be asserted in a
subsequent lawsuit; a judgment for the defendant serves as a bar to further
litigation of the same cause of action.” (Mycogen Corp. v. Monsanto Co.
(2002) 28 Cal.4th 888, 896–897.) Res judicata bars not only matters that were actually
litigated but also those that could have been litigated in a prior suit, so
long as they are part of the same cause of action finally resolved in that
suit. (Busick v. Workmen's Comp. Appeals Bd. (1972) 7 Cal.3d
967, 975.) 
 
The prerequisite elements for applying the doctrine are: (1)
A claim or issue raised in the present action is identical to a claim or issue
litigated in a prior proceeding; (2) the prior proceeding resulted in a final
judgement on the merits; and (3) the party against whom the doctrine is being
asserted was a party or in privity with a party to the prior proceeding. (Brinton
v. Bankers Pension Services, Inc. (1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 550, 556.)
 
The claim preclusion aspect of res judicata
applies to small claims
judgments. (Pitzen v. Superior Court (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 1374,
1381 (Pitzen).) Collateral estoppel applies to claims
litigated and decided against plaintiffs in a small claims action; it does not apply to claims
litigated and decided against a small claims defendant. (Id. at pp.
1385–1386.)
 
            Here, Defendants present that on November 3, 2023,
Plaintiff filed a Claim and Order to Go to Small Claims Court in case number
23CHSC0126 (Baik Decl. Ex. “2.”) Thereafter, on January 19, 2024, Plaintiff
filed “First Amended Complaint” or SC-100 Plaintiff’s Claim and Order to Go to
Small Claims Court against Defendant “LADWP AND CITY OF LOS ANGELES.” (Baik
Decl. Ex. “3,” RJN No. 2) Plaintiff claimed his damages as following: “1. DWP
Trush [sic] truck pick-up damage our main water line. We spent 42,8000 for repair.
2. Incident happen on city property. 3. DWP billing statements overcharges
invoice over $3,100 in various billing cycle statements. Up to date we been
reimbursed $1,100, and we have $2,000 outstanding balance.” (Ibid.)
Plaintiff indicated on the SC-100 form that the alleged damages occurred on
March 2, 2023. (Ibid.) Subsequently, on March 19, 2024, a judgment was
entered in the small claims case, stating, “Court orders judgment entered on
the Amended Plaintiff’s Claim (1st) filed by Rade Raicevic on 11/03/2023 as
follows: Defendants Los Angeles Dept. of Water Power & Water; City of Los
Angeles do not owe the plaintiff Rade Raicevic any money on plaintiff’s claim.”
(Baik Decl. Ex. “4,” RJN Nos. 3)
 
            The Court finds that the requisite elements for applying res
judicata are satisfied. First, the claim and issue raised in this action are
identical to the those litigated in the small claims court. Both proceedings
concern the same alleged damage to Plaintiff’s main water line, caused by
Defendants’ weekly trash pick-up truck in the first week of March 2023. Second,
the small claims proceeding resulted in a final judgment on the merits following
a non-jury trial. Third, the parties involved in the small claims proceeding
are the same in this action.
 
             Accordingly, the
Complaint’s sole cause of action for General Negligence is barred from
relitigation under the doctrine of res judicata.
 
            On the ground, the Court SUSTAINS without LEAVE TO AMEND
the Demurrer. 
 
2)     
Failure to Sufficiently State a
Cause of Action
 
Defendants assert that the Demurrer should be sustained on
this alternative ground. The Court agrees. 
 
'The elements of a cause of action for negligence are well established.
They are "(a) a legal duty to use due care; (b) a breach of such legal
duty; [and] (c) the breach was the proximate or legal cause of the resulting
injury [damages]." (Laddv. County of San Mateo (1996) 12 Cal.4th 913,
917.) The absence of any one of the elements is fatal to a negligence claim.
(See Gilmer v. Ellington (2008) 159 Cal.App.4th 190, 195.)
 
Furthermore, the Government Claims Act
states that “except as otherwise provided by statute, [a] public entity is not
liable for an injury, whether such injury arises out of an act or omission of
the public entity or a public employee or any other person.” (Gov. Code, §
815.) As the Senate Legislative Committee explained in the comment to
Government Code Section 815, “the practical effect of this section is to
eliminate any common law governmental liability for damages arising out of
torts.”
 
“[D]irect tort liability of public
entities must be based on a specific statute declaring them to be liable, or at
least creating a specific duty of care, and not on the general tort provisions
of Civil Code section 1714.” (Munoz v. City of Union City, (2004) 120
Cal.App.4th 1077, 1112.) “The cases do make plain, however, that a verdict
against a county must be overturned if it is erroneously based on a negligence
theory.” (Hilts v. Solano County (1968) 265 Cal.App.2d 161, 171.)
 
Here, Plaintiff’s sole cause of action
for General Negligence alleges direct tort liability of Defendants public
entities. However, Plaintiff fails to cite any specific statute that impose a
duty of care on Defendants in this matter. As a result, Plaintiff has not
sufficiently established the first element of the negligence cause of action. 
 
Accordingly, the Court SUSTAINS the Demurrer on this
alternative ground.
 
3)      Allegation
of Breach of Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing
 
Defendants further argue that
Plaintiff’s allegation of “Damages for breach of the implied covenant of fair
dealing in good faith,” and that “Defendant to compensate Plaintiff for the repair /
replacement / restoration of premises damages for Bad Faith – California Code
Section 790.03 et. seq.” are ambiguous and unintelligible.
(Dem. at p. 7, see Compl. “PLD-PI-001(2).”)
 
First, the Court notes that such language is typically applicable
to contract claims, as the
law implies a covenant of good faith and fair dealing in every contract.
(Wilson v. 21st Century Ins. Co. (2007) 42 Cal.4th 713, 720.) The
obligations imposed by the implied covenant are imposed by law to govern the
manner in which the express contractual obligations must be discharged –
i.e., fairly and in good faith. (Gruenberg v. Aetna Ins. Co. (1973) 9
Cal.3d 566, 573; California Shoppers, Inc. v. Royal Globe Ins. Co.
(1985) 175 Cal.App.3d 1, 54; Chateau Chamberay Homeowners Ass’n v.
Associated Int’l Ins. Co. (2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 335, 346.) (Underlines
added.)
 
Here, the Complaint alleges single cause of action for
General Negligence. In the absence of any allegations supporting a contractual
claim, the allegation of “breach of the implied covenant of fair dealing in good
faith” is deemed to be ambiguous and unintelligible.
 
Second, the Court determines that
this allegation, on its own, does not constitute a separate cause of action.
 
In California, what constitutes a “cause
of action” for purposes of res judicata is determined by application of the primary
right theory.
“[A] ‘cause of action’ is comprised of a ‘primary right’ of the plaintiff, a
corresponding ‘primary duty’ of the defendant, and a wrongful act by the
defendant constituting a breach of that duty. [Citation.] The most salient
characteristic of a primary right is that it is indivisible: the violation of
a single primary right gives rise to but a single cause of action. [Citation.]
A pleading that states the violation of one primary right in two causes of
action contravenes the rule against ‘splitting’ a cause of action. [Citation.]”
(Crowley v. Katleman (1994) 8 Cal.4th 666, 681.)
 
Here, Plaintiff only alleges the
invasion of a single right – his right to be free from property damage to the main
water line and resulting monetary loss. Plaintiff asserts that Defendants acted
in bad faith by “[f]ailing to promptly pay Plaintiff the necessary amounts
required to be paid as the proximate result of his residential water loss for
many weeks or perhaps months,” and that “Defendant to compensate Plaintiff for
the repair/replacement/restoration of premises damages for bad faith –
California Code Section 790.03 et seq.” 
 
Consequently, as the Court has
barred the General Negligence cause of action, these allegations – arising from
the same right and involving the same legally cognizable harm as those asserted
in the General Negligence claim – must also be barred under the doctrine of res
judicata.
 
4)      Plaintiff’s
Opposition
 
Here, Plaintiff’s Opposition
include four paragraphs labeled (a) through (d). However, the assertions in
these paragraphs amount to, at most, factual declarations by Plaintiff. The
Opposition lacks any legal analysis.
 
Consequently, the Court
finds the Opposition fails to address the legal issues raised in Demurrer and
does not overcome the findings as analyzed above. 
 
5)      Leave
to Amend
 
When a demurrer is sustained, the Court determines
whether there is a reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by
amendment. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) When a plaintiff
"has pleaded the general set of facts upon which his cause of action is
based," the court should give the plaintiff an opportunity to amend his
complaint, since plaintiff should not "be deprived of his right to
maintain his action on the ground that his pleadings were defective for lack of
particulars." (Reed v. Norman (1957) 152 Cal.App.2d 892, 900.)
Generally, the court will allow leave to amend on at least the first try,
unless there is absolutely no possibility of overcoming the issue. (See Angie
M. v. Superior Court (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1217, 1227 '("Denial of
leave to amend constitutes an abuse of discretion unless the complaint shows on
its face it is incapable of amendment. [Citation.] Liberality in permitting
amendment is the rule, if a fair opportunity to correct any defect has not been
given.").) 
 
Given that Plaintiffs claim is barred, as discussed
above, there is no reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by
amendment. For this reason, Defendants' Demurrer to the Complaint is SUSTAINED
WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND.
 
CONCLUSION
 
Defendants Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and City of Los
Angeles’s Demurrer to the Complaint is SUSTAINED WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND.
