And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Hyundai Motor America's (Defendant) ex parte application for a stay in the case, which aimed to pause the proceedings until the Defendant's motion to compel arbitration can be heard. The judge ruled that the Defendant failed to demonstrate irreparable harm, as required by California law. Specifically, the Defendant's declaration lacked specific information about discovery served by the Plaintiff, which would have established the necessary irreparable harm and exigent circumstances for ex parte relief. The judge stated that the Defendant's motion to compel arbitration is still set to be heard on January 27, 2025, and that the Defendant's counsel is directed to give notice of the denial.
