  Case Number:  24PSCV01510    Hearing Date:   January 10, 2025    Dept:  H Wilson v. Hyundai Motor America, Case No. 24PSCV01510
TENTATIVE RULING DENYING
EX PARTE APPLICATION FOR STAY
Defendant Hyundai Motor America (“Defendant”) has filed an
ex parte application for an order to stay the case until Defendant’s motion to
compel arbitration can be heard. Having read and considered the moving papers filed
by Defendant, along with the declaration of Ali Ameripour, Esq., the
application is denied due to Defendant’s failure to demonstrate irreparable
harm.
An applicant for ex parte relief “must make an affirmative
factual showing in a declaration containing competent testimony based on
personal knowledge of irreparable harm, immediate danger, or other statutory
basis for granting relief ex parte.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1202(c).) Defendant
has not satisfied this requirement. Defendant’s motion to compel arbitration is
set to be heard in 17 days, on January 27, 2025. While Defendant contends
that Plaintiff seeks discovery in the interim and that Defendant would suffer “substantial
prejudice” if required to engage in discovery before the Court rules on its
motion, Defendant’s declaration is devoid of any specific information regarding
discovery served by Plaintiff to which Defendant must now respond. As such, the
Declaration of Ameripour fails to establish the irreparable harm and exigent
circumstances required for ex parte relief.
Accordingly, the Ex Parte Application for an Order to Stay
the Entire Instant Action Until Defendant’s Motion to Compel Arbitration Can Be
Heard is DENIED without prejudice.
Counsel for Defendant is directed to give notice.
