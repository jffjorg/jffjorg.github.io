And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied a motion filed by Plaintiff Raul S. Gonzalez's counsel, Kevin S. Avery, to be relieved as counsel. The motion was filed due to a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship, with counsel stating that they have been unable to communicate with the plaintiff for several months. However, the judge found that the motion was incomplete, as counsel failed to provide a copy of the proposed order as required and listed an incorrect address for the court in the moving papers and proof of services. Additionally, counsel did not provide information for all future proceedings in the case. As a result, the judge denied the motion and ordered counsel to provide notice of the ruling and file proofs of service.
