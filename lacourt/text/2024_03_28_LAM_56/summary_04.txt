And here is the summary in English text:

This tentative ruling is about a motion to set aside a dismissal of a complaint filed by Blossom Brown against the Los Angeles LGBT Center, Luis Felix, and Jeffrey Rodriguez. The complaint alleges discrimination, harassment, retaliation, and wrongful termination. The court dismissed the complaint on October 17, 2023, due to Plaintiff's failure to comply with court orders. Plaintiff's attorney claims that the failure was due to a mistake and excusable neglect, as they relied on staff to calendar deadlines and the staff member erred. The court finds that Plaintiff's argument has merit and grants the motion to set aside the dismissal. The court concludes that the attorney's neglect was excusable and that Plaintiff is entitled to relief under the mandatory provision of Code of Civil Procedure § 473(b).
