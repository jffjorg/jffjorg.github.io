And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the demurrer filed by the Crawford Defendants to the First Amended Complaint (FAC) and has sustained it. The Court finds that the Crawford Defendants have been improperly joined in the action because there are no common questions of law or fact arising out of the same transaction or events for all of the named defendants. The Court rejects the Plaintiffs' argument that the Crawford Defendants have a common interest in all four of the properties based on the overlap of ownership and management of the Subject Properties. The Court also rejects the Plaintiffs' argument that the Crawford Defendants have failed to show that they suffered any prejudice from being improperly joined in the action. The Court grants leave to amend, but the Plaintiffs fail to show how the issue of misjoinder can be cured. Therefore, the Court denies the request for leave to amend and sustains the demurrer without leave to amend.
