RESPONDING PARTY: None.
 
            The Court has considered the moving papers.
No opposition has been filed. 
 
BACKGROUND
            This action arises out of an
employment relationship. On August 30, 2021, Plaintiff filed a complaint
asserting representative claims on behalf of himself and other aggrieved
employees pursuant to the Private Attorneys General Act (“PAGA”) against
Defendant Parkway Motorcars Valencia Inc. dba Parkway Buick GMC Cadillac
(“Defendant”). 
 
            On January 5, 2023, the Court
granted in part Defendant’s motion to compel arbitration and ordered
Plaintiff’s individual PAGA claims to be sent to arbitration. The Court further
stayed the action as it pertained to Plaintiff’s representative PAGA claims. 
 
            On April 25, 2023, the Court lifted
the stay in this action based on Defendant’s failure to timely pay arbitration
fees. 
 
            Now, Plaintiff requests the Court to
approve the settlement reached between the parties pursuant to Labor Code §
2699(1)(2)
 
DISCUSSION
            Under PAGA, an aggrieved employee
may bring a civil action personally and on behalf of other current or former
employees to recover civil penalties for Labor Code violations.  (Iskanian
v. CLS Transportation Los Angeles, LLC (2014) 59 Cal.4th 348, 380.) 
Under PAGA, 75 percent of any penalties recovered go to the Labor and Workforce
Development Agency (“LWDA”), leaving the remaining 25 percent for the
employees.  (Ibid.)  PAGA is intended “to augment the limited
enforcement capability of [LWDA] by empowering employees to enforce the Labor
Code as representatives of the Agency.”  (Id. at p. 383.)  A
judgment in a PAGA action binds all those, including nonparty aggrieved
employees, who would be bound by a judgment in an action brought by the
government.  (Id. at p. 381.) A superior court must “review
and approve any settlement of any civil action filed pursuant to this part.”
(Lab. Code, § 2699, subd. (l)(2).)  
 
Though
there is no statutory or common law standard for approval of a PAGA settlement,
the standard used for approval of class action settlements is instructive.
“[A]¿presumption¿of¿fairness¿exists where: (1) the settlement is reached
through arm's-length bargaining; (2) investigation and discovery are sufficient
to allow counsel and the court to act intelligently; (3) counsel is experienced
in similar litigation; and (4) the percentage of objectors is small.” (Dunk
v. Ford Motor Co. (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 1794, 1802.) The last factor, small
percentage of objectors, is inapplicable to PAGA claims. (See Arias v.
Superior Court (2009) 46 Cal.4th 969, 984-985 [rejecting the argument that
representative actions under PAGA violate the due process rights of “nonparty
aggrieved employees who are not given notice of, and an opportunity to be
heard”].) Additional factors that are useful to consider include the strength
of a plaintiff’s case, the risk, expense, complexity and likely duration of
further litigation, the amount offered in settlement, the extent of discovery
completed, and the experience and views of counsel. (See Kullar v. Foot
Locker Retail, Inc. (2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 116, 128.) 
 
Key Settlement Terms
            The Settlement Amount and
Distributions are Normal
The
proposed $160,000.00 settlement (for PAGA penalties only) breaks down to a net
settlement of $84,711.72 following the deduction of $53,333.33 in attorney’s
fees, $10,454.00 in costs, a $5,000.00 incentive award, and $6,500.00 in
settlement administration costs. (Motion at pg. 5; Szamet Decl. ¶13, Exh. 1 at
¶ 3.)
 
The
parties propose the standard¿distribution of 75% to the State ($63,533.79) and
25% to the aggrieved employees ($21,177.93). (Ibid.) The parties have
not provided an estimated average payment to each employee, but the settlement
provides that each employee shall be paid on a pro rata basis. (Ibid.)
The parties gave the LWDA notice of the settlement. (Szamet Decl., Exh. 6.) 
 
The
requested attorney’s fees are acceptable under the common fund doctrine and are
substantially less than the pre-multiplier lodestar amount of $72,615.00 that
Plaintiff’s counsel would otherwise receive for their work. (Consumer
Privacy Cases (2009) 175 Cal. App. 4th 545, 557; Szamet Decl. ¶¶ 71-74.) In
light of the work completed by Plaintiff’s counsel on this case (e.g., legal
research, discovery, damages analysis, mediation, etc.), the Court finds that
the fee award is reasonable.  
 
            The Settlement is
Non-Reversionary
The
settlement is non-reversionary. Mailed checks will remain valid for 180 days,
after which the value of any uncashed checks will be distributed to the California
Controller’s Unclaimed Property Fund in the name of the aggrieved employee. (Szamet
Decl., Exh. 1 at ¶¶ 4.4.1, 4.4.3.)
 
The
Aggrieved Employee’s Releases are Narrow, and Plaintiff’s Release is Broad
            In exchange, Plaintiff will provide
Defendant with a general release of all PAGA, underlying, and other claims,
including a waiver of Civil Code section 1542, but aggrieved employees will
only be releasing their PAGA penalty claims.¿ (Szamet Decl., Exh. 1 at ¶
5.)
 
The Settlement is Presumptively Fair
The
parties reached the proposed settlement through arms-length mediation following
a review of Defendant’s records and in spite Defendant’s denial of liability.
The parties reached this settlement after extensive mediation efforts.
Accordingly, the settlement is entitled to a presumption of
fairness.  
 
Moreover,
the terms of the settlement are fair, reasonable, and adequate in light of the
gamut of Plaintiff’s claims, Defendants’ potential defenses, possible
reductions in any eventual PAGA award, and the posture of this case. (Motion at
pp. 6-9, Szamet Decl. ¶¶ 16-27; See Kullar v. Foot Locker Retail,
Inc. (2008)168 Cal. App. 4th 116, 130 [“The most important factor is the
strength of the case for plaintiffs on the merits, balanced against the amount
offered in settlement.”].) The proposed fee, cost, and incentive awards appear
to be reasonable as well. Ultimately, there appears to be no other reason
countenancing denial of the motion.
 
            Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s
motion for approval of PAGA settlement is GRANTED. 
 
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.            
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
