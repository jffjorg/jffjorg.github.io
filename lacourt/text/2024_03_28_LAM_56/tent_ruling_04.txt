BACKGROUND
             Plaintiff Blossom Brown (“Plaintiff”)
initiated this action against Defendants Los Angeles LGBT Center, Luis Felix,
and Jeffrey Rodriguez (collectively, “Defendants”), alleging the following
causes of action: (1) discrimination in violation of Government Code §§ 12940, et
seq.; (2) harassment in violation of Government Code §§ 12940, et seq.;
(3) retaliation in violation of Government Code §§ 12940, et seq.; (4)
failure to prevent discrimination, harassment and retaliation in violation of
Government Code § 12940(k); (5) failure to provide reasonable accommodations in
violations of Government Code §§ 12940, et seq.; (6) failure to engage
in a good faith interactive process in violation of Government Code §§ 12940,
et seq.; (7) retaliation (Labor Code §§ 1102.5, 1102.6); and (8) wrongful
termination. 
 
            On August 30, 2023, the Court
ordered Plaintiff to file proof of service as to the complaint or to submit a
declaration by October 12, 2023, explaining why the case should not be
dismissed. On October 17, 2023, due to Plaintiff’s failure to comply with the
Court’s August 30, 2023 Order, the Court dismissed Plaintiff’s complaint
without prejudice for lack of prosecution.
 
            On November 16, 2023, Plaintiff filed the instant motion to set aside the
dismissal entered on October 17, 2023. No opposition has been submitted. 
 
DISCUSSION
            A trial court has broad discretion
to vacate a judgment, dismissal, default judgment, or entry of default that
preceded it. (Code Civ. Proc. § 473.) However, that discretion can be exercised
only if the moving party establishes a proper ground for relief, by the proper
procedure, and within the time limits. (Cruz
v. Fagor America, Inc. (2007) 146 Cal.App.4th 488, 495.) A party may seek
discretionary or mandatory relief from default under Code of Civil
Procedure § 473(b) on grounds of “mistake,
inadvertence, surprise or excusable neglect.” Relief under this section is mandatory when based on an attorney
affidavit of fault; otherwise, it is discretionary.  (Id.)
 
“Because
the law strongly favors trial and disposition on the merits, any doubts in
applying section 473 must be resolved in favor of the party seeking relief from
default.” (Elston v. City of Turlock
(1985) 38 Cal.3d 227, 233.) Where the party in default moves promptly to seek
relief, and no prejudice to the opposing party will result from setting aside
the default and letting the case go to trial on the merits, “very slight
evidence will be required to justify a court in setting aside the default.” (Id.)
 
            Here, Plaintiff contends that the
dismissal entered on October 17, 2023 should be set aside because the failure
to appear and to abide by the Court’s August 30, 2023 Order was due to her
attorney’s mistake. In support of this contention, Plaintiff has submitted the
declaration of her counsel, Stephen J. Duron. Within his declaration, he states
that his firm had changed its mailing system in July 2023, but because of a
flaw within this new system, the mail received for this case was improperly
filed. (Duron Decl. ¶ 3.) Thus, no attorney or paralegal had seen the Court’s
Minute Orders dated July 11, 2023 and August 30, 2023. (Ibid.) The error
in the new mailing system was not fixed until October 20, 2023, and at this
point, Plaintiff’s attorney became aware that this action had been dismissed
after having received the Court’s October 17, 2023 Minute Order. (Id. at
¶ 4.) Therefore, Counsel Duron claims that it was due to mistake and excusable
neglect that his firm did not properly calendar the pertinent deadlines set by
the Court. (Id. at ¶ 8.)
 
            Under the circumstances, the Court
finds that Plaintiff’s argument has merit. 
Courts have found excusable neglect where the attorneys relied on a
member of their staff “to perform certain tasks, including calendaring
deadlines, and the staff member errs.”  
(Renteria v. Juvenile Justice, Dept. of Corrections and
Rehabilitation (2006) 135 Cal.App.4th 903, 911; see also Bergloff
v. Reynolds (1960) 181 Cal.App.2d 349, 358-359.) Moreover, under the
mandatory provision of Section 473(b), the attorney’s neglect does not need to
be excusable.  (Henderson v. Pacific
Gas & Electric Co. (2010) 187 Cal.App.4th 215, 225.) Therefore, the
Court finds that Plaintiff is entitled to relief under the mandatory provision
of Code of Civil Procedure § 473(b).
            
Accordingly,
because Plaintiff’s counsel has admitted fault for his failure to abide by the
Court’s August 30, 2023 Order, the Court grants the instant motion pursuant to
Code of Civil Procedure § 473(b).
 
 
            Plaintiff’s Motion to Set Aside Dismissal
of Action is GRANTED.
 
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.            
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
