The Honorable Gary Y. Tanaka has issued a tentative ruling denying the motion for order of production of imprisoned defendant Carl Bao Le without prejudice. The Plaintiffs, Preethi Sekar, et al., have alleged that Defendant Citadel Re and Investments, LLC owes them on various promissory notes and that Defendant Carl Le fraudulently induced the loans. The Plaintiffs move for an order to produce Carl Bao Le from state prison to be brought before the court for the trial. However, the Judge finds that the Plaintiffs have not provided the required affidavit showing the nature of the action or proceeding, the testimony expected from the witness, and its materiality, as required by California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) § 1996 and Penal Code § 2623. Therefore, the motion is denied without prejudice to a filing of a proper motion for deposition pursuant to Penal Code § 2623. The Plaintiffs are ordered to give notice of this ruling.
