And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Diamond Quality Builders, Inc.'s motion to strike Sayo Sasaki's Answer and enter Default. The motion was filed because Sayo Sasaki passed away, and the estate requires an attorney to represent it. However, the judge ruled that the grounds for the motion to strike must appear on the face of the pleading or by way of judicial notice, and the motion was only supported by extrinsic evidence, which cannot be considered. The judge also noted that the court may strike any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading, but the motion did not meet this requirement.
