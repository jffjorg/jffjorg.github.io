Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the Motion for Sanctions filed by the defendants, Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) and Michelle Brownridge Keller. The motion seeks to have the deposition testimony taken by the plaintiff, Danise Marler, without the presence of defendants' counsel excluded from being used. The plaintiff's opposition was filed late, but the Court will consider it.

The Court finds that the defendants failed to comply with Rule 3.1345, which requires a separate statement to be filed when seeking sanctions. The Court denies the Motion for Sanctions without prejudice and encourages counsel to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
