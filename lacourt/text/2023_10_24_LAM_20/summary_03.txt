And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the cross-defendant's special motion to strike the cross-complaint under California Code of Civil Procedure Section 425.16 (anti-SLAPP statute). The cross-complaint alleges defamation, which is based on the initial filing of a lawsuit. The cross-defendant argued that the cross-complaint is subject to the anti-SLAPP statute because it is based on protected activity, namely the filing of a lawsuit. The judge found that the cross-complaint falls within the four categories of the anti-SLAPP statute and that the cross-defendant has met its initial burden. The burden then shifted to the cross-complainant to establish a probability that they would prevail on the merits, but the cross-complainant failed to file an opposition and instead filed an amended cross-complaint that struck the defamation cause of action. The judge concluded that the cross-complaint is improper and granted the special motion to strike. The judge also ordered the cross-defendant to give notice and encouraged counsel to appear remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
