And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge, Kevin C. Brazile, has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Running et al v. Covina Irrigating Company et al, Case No. BC623542. The case involves a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict filed by the Defendant, Covina Irrigating Company, against the Plaintiffs, Praxedes E. Running and the Praxedes E. Running Trust. The Judge has denied the motion, finding that there is sufficient evidence to support the jury's verdict.

The Judge's ruling is based on the facts of the case, including the Plaintiffs' cause of action for negligence against the Defendant, the statute of limitations for negligence claims, and the Defendant's argument that the Plaintiffs' entire cause of action for negligence should have been barred by the statute of limitations. The Judge also considered the testimony and exhibits presented at trial, as well as the Plaintiffs' claims that they cleaned and cleared the canal, a job that the Defendant routinely previously did.

The Judge found that a triable issue of fact exists as to when the statute of limitations began to run on the Plaintiffs' causes of action, and therefore denied the Defendant's motion for summary judgment. The Judge also denied the Defendant's request to strike the Plaintiffs' opposition to the motion, finding that the request was procedurally improper.
