And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling grants defendant's motions to compel plaintiff's responses to discovery requests and to deem requests for admissions admitted. The plaintiff failed to serve timely responses to defendant's requests for production of documents, special interrogatories, and form interrogatories. The defendant filed motions to compel and to deem requests for admissions admitted, and the plaintiff did not serve oppositions to the motions. The court finds that the plaintiff's failure to serve timely responses warrants an order compelling responses and deeming requests for admissions admitted. The court orders the plaintiff to serve verified responses to discovery requests within 30 days and orders the plaintiff's counsel to pay sanctions of $3,750.00.
