English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in a motion to quash subpoenas issued by Defendants Ovig Vartanian and Ruzanna Tagvoryan to Plaintiff Vanessa Smith's prior employers. The subpoenas sought a wide range of sensitive documents, including medical records, payroll information, and personnel files. The Judge agrees that some of the records sought are relevant to Plaintiff's traumatic brain injury (TBI) claim, but finds that the subpoenas are overly broad and implicate financial privacy rights. The Judge limits the subpoenas to specific categories of records, including timecards, attendance records, performance reviews, medical records, and correspondence related to Plaintiff's work performance and accommodations. The Judge also orders that access to the subpoenaed records shall be limited to the parties, counsel, and experts directly involved in evaluating Plaintiff's TBI claim.
