MOTIONS TO COMPEL INITIAL RESPONSES AND
REQUESTS FOR SANCTIONS¿ 
Hearing Date: 12/4/24¿¿¿ 
CASE NO./NAME: 22STCV29753 WALTER MOORE, et
al. vs ENTERPRISE HOLDINGS, INC et al¿ 
Moving Party: Defendant Veda Thomas 
Responding Party: Plaintiff¿¿¿ 
Notice: Sufficient¿¿¿ 
 
Ruling: MOTIONS TO COMPEL ARE MOOT; SANCTIONS
ARE GRANTED¿ 
¿ 
The present motions concern Plaintiff Todd Walter Moore’s responses
to Defendant Veda Thomas’s Form Interrogatories, Set One; Special
Interrogatories, Set One; Requests for Admission, Set One; and Requests for
Production of Documents, Set One. 
 
On August 9, 2024, Defendant served the discovery requests at
issue. Defendant granted Plaintiff an extension to serve responses by September
24, 2024, with no further extensions to be granted. Plaintiff made several
representations that the responses were forthcoming; however, as of October 30,
2024, when the motions were filed, no responses had been provided. Defendant
now moves the court to compel initial responses. 
 
Plaintiff filed an opposition, asserting that the discovery
responses have since been served. Defendant, in its reply, acknowledged receipt
of the responses. As a result, the present motions to compel are moot, leaving
only the issue of sanctions for the court’s consideration. 
 
On the issue of sanctions, Defendant argues that although the
discovery responses were served on the same day the motions were filed, they
were served only after Defendant incurred attorney fees in preparing and filing
the motions. 
 
Defendant granted Plaintiff multiple extensions, and as part of the
last of those, Plaintiff agreed to serve the discovery responses by October 11,
2024. However, no responses were provided by that deadline. On October 22,
2024, Plaintiff requested an additional extension, which Defendant reasonably
denied. On October 30, 2024, at approximately 12:01 p.m., Defendant served the
motions to compel on Plaintiff. Later that same day, at about 4:58 p.m.,
Plaintiff served the overdue discovery responses. 
 
Given that Defendant had already provided several extensions,
Plaintiff failed to meet the October 11 deadline, and the responses were served
only after the motions were filed, the Court finds that sanctions are warranted
under these circumstances. Defendant seeks sanctions in the amount of $5,840
per motion. Considering the straightforward nature of the issues, the Court
reduces the sanctions to a total of $1,000 for all four motions against
Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel jointly and severally, payable to Defendant
within 20 days of today.
