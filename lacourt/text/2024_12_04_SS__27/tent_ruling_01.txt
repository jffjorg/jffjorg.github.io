CASE NO./NAME: 22STCV03495 JOSIAH ORELLANA,
et al. vs OVIG VARTANIAN, et al.
Moving Party: Plaintiff Vanessa Smith
Responding Party: Defendants Ovig Vartanian
and Ruzanna Tagvoryan
Notice: Sufficient 
Ruling: GRANTED IN PART
 
Background
This
matter arises from a series of multiple motor vehicle collisions involving
eight vehicles, which occurred on the I-5 Freeway Northbound in Los Angeles,
California, on January 30, 2020. Plaintiff and Defendants represent three of
the vehicles involved. On October 9, 2024, Defendants Ovig Vartanian and
Ruzanna Tagvoryan issued subpoenas to five of Plaintiff Vanessa Smith’s prior
employers, requesting the production of the following:
“Plaintiff’s complete
personnel file, including but not limited to employment applications;
performance evaluations and employee reviews; insurance records; workers’
compensation or disability records, including documentation related to employer
notifications, benefit reviews, indemnity and medical benefits, releases to
return to work, doctors’ reports, and medical bills; medical records; accident
or incident reports, including witness statements; records related to employee
benefits; interoffice correspondence or notes; absenteeism records and
timecards; and Plaintiff’s entire payroll file, including earning ledgers, W-2
forms, 1099 forms, time, and absenteeism records.” 
The
language of each subpoena is identical, with the scope of records limited to
the periods during which Plaintiff was employed by each respective employer.
Plaintiff
argues that Defendants’ subpoenas to Plaintiff’s prior employers are improper
for several reasons. First, because Plaintiff is not alleging a loss of
earnings claim, the requested documents are irrelevant to the issues in this
case. Second, the subpoenas are overly broad, seeking a wide array of sensitive
documents, including medical records, payroll information, and personnel files,
much of which is unrelated to the claims in this lawsuit. Third, the subpoenas
implicate Plaintiff’s financial privacy rights, as the requested wage and
payroll information is not narrowly tailored and unrelated to Plaintiff's
traumatic brain injury (TBI) claim. Fourth, the subpoenas improperly request
medical records and bills from Plaintiff’s employers, who are not the
custodians of such records. 
Legal Standard 
CCP
section 1987.1 states that “[i]f a subpoena requires the attendance of a
witness or the production of books, documents, electronically stored
information, or other things before a court, or at the trial of an issue
therein, or at the taking of a deposition, the court, upon motion reasonably
made by any person described in subdivision (b), or upon the court’s own motion
after giving counsel notice and an opportunity to be heard, may make an order
quashing the subpoena entirely, modifying it, or directing compliance with it
upon those terms or conditions as the court shall declare, including protective
orders.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1987.1(a).)  “In addition, the court
may make any other order as may be appropriate to protect the person from unreasonable
or oppressive demands, including unreasonable violations of the right of
privacy of the person.”  (Id.)  Subdivision (b) provides that
a party may make a motion pursuant to subdivision (a).  (Id., §
1987.1(b).) 
        As a general rule, all unprivileged
information that is relevant to the subject matter of the action is
discoverable if it would itself be admissible evidence at trial or if it
appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.
(Code Civ. Proc. § 2017.010; Schnabel v. Superior Court. (1993) 5
Cal.4th 704, 711.) When the information sought to be discovered impacts a
person’s constitutional right to privacy, limited protections come into play
for that person. (Shaffer v. Superior Court (1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 993,
999.) The protections cover both a person’s personal and financial matters. (Id.)
The court must balance competing rights — the right of a litigant to discover
relevant facts and the right of an individual to maintain reasonable privacy —
in determining whether the information is discoverable. (Id.) 
        For discovery purposes, information is
relevant if it might reasonably assist a party in evaluating the case,
preparing for trial, or facilitating settlement. (Gonzalez v. Superior Court
(1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 1539, 1546.) 
Discussion
Although
Plaintiff is not seeking lost wages, the Court agrees with Defendants that the
subpoenas seek relevant information directly tied to Plaintiff Vanessa Smith’s
claim of a traumatic brain injury (TBI) allegedly sustained in the January 2020
motor vehicle collision. 
Plaintiff
testified that her TBI caused memory loss, vision problems, and severe
migraines, which impacted her ability to work, including requiring
accommodations such as wearing sunglasses at her desk and experiencing
difficulties retaining information and completing tasks. Records such as
timecards, attendance logs, performance evaluations, and accommodations
provided by employers are relevant for evaluating the impact and extent of
Plaintiff’s TBI. Specifically, these records will show when Plaintiff returned
to work, the number of hours worked, any changes in performance, and whether
she requested or received accommodations for her injuries. Additionally,
evidence of promotions, terminations, or other employment milestones can shed
light on Plaintiff’s functional capacity before and after the collision. This
information is relevant or reasonably calculated to lead to admissible
evidence, enabling Defendants to assess the causation, extent, and implications
of Plaintiff’s claimed injuries. This is particularly important given that
Plaintiff’s TBI diagnosis occurred four years after the accident, leaving a
significant gap in documentation that the subpoenaed records may help address.
Having
said that, the Court finds that the subpoenas are overbroad because they seek
entire personnel files, including irrelevant and sensitive information
unrelated to Plaintiff Vanessa Smith’s traumatic brain injury claim.
Specifically, the subpoenas encompass documents such as financial records
(e.g., payroll files with wage amounts), general inter-office correspondence,
and medical records unrelated to the TBI or alleged injuries from the accident.
Requests for comprehensive payroll files, including wage amounts, raise
financial privacy concerns especially considering that Plaintiff is not making
a loss of earnings claim.
To
address these issues and balance Defendants’ right to discovery with
Plaintiff’s privacy rights, the Court will limit the subpoenas as follows:
1.  Timecards,
Attendance Records, and Scheduling Logs: The subpoenas are limited to records
showing days and hours worked, time off, and breaks in employment. These are
directly relevant to assessing the impact of Plaintiff’s TBI on her work
performance while avoiding disclosure of sensitive wage information.
2.  Performance
Reviews and Accommodations: The subpoenas re limited to Plaintiff’s performance
evaluations, disciplinary actions, or accommodations requested and provided.
These records are critical to evaluating whether Plaintiff’s alleged TBI
affected her ability to work and whether accommodations were required and
granted.
3.  Medical
Records: The subpoenas are limited to records related to workplace
accommodations, job modifications, or adjustments provided for medical reasons
explicitly tied to Plaintiff’s TBI or alleged injuries. However, the Court
finds that Defendants’ request for medical records or bills from Plaintiff’s
employers is improper because employers are not the appropriate custodians of
such records and are not necessarily skilled in determining medical record
distinctions. 
4.  Requests for payroll records must be
limited to timekeeping data, including hours worked, days present, and any
breaks in employment. Wage amounts are to be redacted. Timekeeping records are
directly relevant to evaluating whether Plaintiff’s TBI impacted her attendance
and productivity but disclosure of wage amounts, earnings, or other financial
details raises privacy concerns and might not be relevant because Plaintiff is
not asserting a loss of earnings or earning capacity claim. The Court finds
that Defendants’ interest in understanding Plaintiff’s work patterns and
attendance can be satisfied without requiring disclosure of sensitive financial
information. 
5.  Correspondence:
The subpoenas are limited to correspondence related directly to Plaintiff’s
work performance, accommodations for medical conditions, or any workplace
adjustments explicitly tied to the symptoms Plaintiff attributes to her TBI,
such as memory issues, vision problems, or sensitivity to light. The subpoena
should not include broad requests for inter-office communications unrelated to
Plaintiff’s TBI. For example, emails or memos regarding non-personnel matters,
such as general operations, administrative policies, or unrelated HR matters,
must not be included.
6.  Protective
Order: Access to the subpoenaed records shall be limited to the parties,
counsel and experts directly involved in evaluating Plaintiff’s TBI claim.
Sanctions
are denied because, although Defendants’ subpoenas are overbroad, their
arguments regarding the relevance of Plaintiff’s employment records to her
traumatic brain injury (TBI) claim have merit. Defendants made good faith
efforts to resolve the dispute by offering protective measures, including
redacting wage information and proposing an informal discovery conference
(IDC). While the scope of their requests may require refinement, it does not
reflect bad faith or an unjustified violation of discovery obligations that
would justify the imposition of sanctions.
