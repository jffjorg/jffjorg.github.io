```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the motions to compel initial responses are moot, as the responses were served on the same day the motions were filed. However, the judge has granted sanctions to the defendant in the amount of $1,000, payable to the defendant within 20 days, due to the plaintiff's failure to meet deadlines and serve responses in a timely manner. The judge has also reduced the amount of sanctions from the initial request of $5,840. The parties are required to submit to this tentative ruling by email or appear at the hearing to argue, as the court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the court if no submissions are made.
