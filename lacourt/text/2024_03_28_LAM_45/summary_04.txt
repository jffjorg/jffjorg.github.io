And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is about a motion for summary judgment filed by the defendants in a lawsuit filed by plaintiff Ron Hacker. The lawsuit is about a foreclosure sale of a property in Los Angeles. The defendants are arguing that they had the authority to foreclose on the property and that the foreclosure sale was valid. The plaintiff is arguing that the foreclosure sale was invalid and that the defendants did not have the authority to foreclose.

The court has reviewed the evidence and finds that the defendants have met their initial burden of showing that they had the authority to foreclose on the property. The plaintiff has failed to present admissible evidence to support his claims that the foreclosure sale was invalid. The court grants the defendants' motion for summary judgment and dismisses the remaining causes of action in the lawsuit.

The court's ruling is based on the following facts: Option One sold the loan to Deutsche Bank as Trustee in 2006, and Deutsche Bank as Trustee possessed the original wet-ink note, endorsed in blank. The foreclosure sale was recorded in the public record, and the defendants have presented evidence that the loan was sold and conveyed to Deutsche Bank as Trustee. The plaintiff has failed to present evidence to support his claims that the foreclosure sale was invalid.
