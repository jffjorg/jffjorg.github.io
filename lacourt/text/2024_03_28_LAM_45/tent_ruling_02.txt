Petition for Approval for Transfer of Payment Rights
 
            The court has considered the moving
papers. No opposition was received.
The court DENIES
without prejudice the petition for approval of transfer of payment rights due
to lack of service.
             
The Court-approval process requires the transferee to file a petition in
the county in which the transferor resides for approval of the transfer.  (Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (f)(1A copy of the disclosure required in subdivision (b) of
section 10136.

Further, at the time of filing such a petition, the transferee shall file
a copy of the petition with the California Attorney General. (Ins. Code, §
10139.)  
There being no
evidence that the Attorney General has been served, the Court shall DENY
without prejudice for lack of service.
 
            It
is so ordered.
