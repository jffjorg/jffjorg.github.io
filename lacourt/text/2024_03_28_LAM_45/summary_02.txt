And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the petition filed by J.G. WENTWORTH ORIGINATIONS, LLC for approval of the transfer of payment rights. However, the court denies the petition without prejudice due to lack of service. The court requires the transferee to file a petition in the county where the transferor resides for approval of the transfer and to file a copy of the petition with the California Attorney General. Since there is no evidence that the Attorney General has been served, the court denies the petition.
