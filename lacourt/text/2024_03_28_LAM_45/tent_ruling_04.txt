Responding
Parties:    Plaintiff Ron Hacker, as
Successor Trustee for 1713 Stearns Laverne Family Trust, dated August 1, 2012
Motion for Summary
Judgment, or alternatively, Summary Adjudication 
The
court considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers.
The court GRANTS Defendants’ motion for summary
judgment as to the remaining causes of action of the Second Amended Complaint for wrongful foreclosure, unfair business practices, cancellation,
slander of title, and declaratory relief. 
Background
This action arises out of an
alleged attempted wrongful foreclosure of real property located at 1713-1717
Stearns Drive, Los Angeles, CA 90035.  Plaintiff
Ron Hacker, as successor trustee for 1713 Stearns Laverne Family Trust, dated
August 1, 2012, filed this action on February 19, 2016, and a First Amended
Complaint (FAC) on April 6, 2016. 
On July 25, 2016, the
Court sustained the demurrer to the FAC without leave and entered
judgment.  Plaintiff appealed and, on
August 16, 2018, the Court of Appeal remanded the case, holding that the trial
court properly found that Plaintiff failed to alleged facts establishing an
ownership interest in the subject property sufficient to confer standing, but
the trial court abused its discretion in denying leave to amend.  (Defendants’ RJN, Ex. “2.”) 
Plaintiff filed a Second
Amended Complaint (SAC) on November 21, 2018 against defendants Homeward
Residential, Inc. fka American Home Mortgage Servicing, Inc.; Sand Canyon
Corporation fka Option One Mortgage Corporation; Western Progressive, LLC;
Deutsche Bank National Trust Company, as Trustee for Soundview Home Loan Trust
2006-Opt 3, Asset-Backed Certificates, Series 2006-Opt 3; Ocwen Loan Servicing,
LLC; Linda Greene; Brandy Berns; Doc X; Lorraine Brown; Vicki Pospisil; Power
Default Services, Inc.; T.D. Service Company; and Ahmsi Default Services.
The SAC alleges causes of
action for (1) Breach of Written Contracts; (2) Breach of the Covenant of Good
Faith and Fair Dealing; (3) Wrongful Foreclosure; (4) Fraud; (5) Unfair
Business Practices (Bus.& Prof. Code §§ 17200, et seq.); (6) Cancellation
of Void Instruments; (7) Quiet Title; (8) Declaratory Relief; and (9) Specific
Performance of Contract.
On April 5, 2019, the
Court struck the SAC, and on August 29, 2019, entered a judgment of dismissal
for defendants.  (Minute Order
04/05/2019.)  
Plaintiff appealed and, on
April 2, 2021, the Court of Appeal remanded the case holding that the trial
court should have set aside the judgement under section standing to foreclose.
On November 9, 2021, upon stipulation
of the parties, the Court struck the SAC’s first, second, fourth, seventh, and
ninth causes of action.  (Minute Order
11/09/2021.) 
On March 22, 2023, defendants Homeward Residential, Inc. fka American Home Mortgage
Servicing, Inc., Deutsche Bank National Trust Company, as trustee for Soundview
Home Loan Trust 2006-OPT 3, Asset Backed Certificates, Series 2006-OPT 3,
Western Progressive, LLC, Owen Loan Servicing, LLC, Power Default Services,
Inc., Brandy Berns, and Vicki Pospisil, and defendant Sand Canyon Corporation
fka Option One Mortgage Corporation filed their instant motion for summary
judgment, or alternatively, summary adjudication.  
Plaintiff filed his opposition on
March 15, 2024, and Defendants replied on March 21, 2024. 
Legal Standard 
The function of a motion
for summary judgment or adjudication is to allow a determination as to whether
an opposing party cannot show evidentiary support for a pleading or claim and
to enable an order of summary dismissal without the need for trial.  (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co.
(2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.)  In
analyzing motions for summary judgment, courts must apply a three-step
analysis: “(1) identify the issues framed by the pleadings; (2) determine
whether the moving party has negated the opponent's claims; and (3) determine
whether the opposition has demonstrated the existence of a triable, material
factual issue.” (Hinesley v. Oakshade Town Center (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th
289, 294.)
As to each claim as framed
by the complaint, the defendant moving for summary judgment must satisfy the
initial burden of proof by presenting facts to negate an essential element, or
to establish a defense.  (Scalf v. D.
B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1520.)  Courts “liberally construe the evidence in
support of the party opposing summary judgment and resolve doubts concerning
the evidence in favor of that party.”  (Dore
v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 384, 389.)  A motion for summary judgment must be denied
where the moving party's evidence does not prove all material facts, even in
the absence of any opposition  (Leyva
v. Sup. Ct. (1985) 164 Cal.App.3d 462, 475) or where the opposition is weak
(Salesguevara v. Wyeth Labs., Inc. (1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 379, 384, 387)
Evidentiary Objections
The court rules on Defendants’
evidentiary objections to the Declaration of Ron Hacker submitted in opposition
to Defendants’ motion as follows. 
            Sustained:
Objections 1-8. 
            Overruled:

Declaration
of Ron Hacker in Support of Reply of Plaintiff to Defendant’s Opposition to
Plaintiff’s Request for Preliminary Injunction After Granting of TRO signed on
March 11, 2016. 
Evidence Code section 451, subdivision a, provides the court shall
take juridical notice of the law of this state and of the United States.  The court may take judicial notice of
“[o]fficial acts of the legislative, executive, and judicial departments of the
United States and of any state of the United States,” “[r]ecords of (1) any
court of this state or (2) any court of record of the United States or of any state
of the United States,” and “[f]acts and propositions that are not reasonably
subject to dispute and are capable of immediate and accurate determination by
resort to sources of reasonably indisputable accuracy.”  (Evid. Code, § 452, subds. (c), (d), (h).)¿  This includes recorded deeds and other
documents recorded by a county recorder’s office.  (Evans v. California Trailer Court, Inc.
(1994) 28 Cal.App.4th 540, 549 [“The court may take judicial notice of recorded
deeds”].)  Pursuant to
Evidence Code sections 451 and 452, the court GRANTS Defendants’ requests
insofar as their existence and the orders made within, if any. 
Plaintiff has requested
that the court take judicial notice of the following: 
(1)   Assignment of Deed
of Trust signed by Linda Green, purporting to represent American Home Mortgage
Servicing Inc., transferring Deed of Trust to Deutsche Bank National Trust
Company, as Trustee for the Certificate holders of Soundview Home Loan Trust
2006-OPT3, Asset-Backet Certificates, recorded with the Los Angeles County
Recorder on
August 26, 2008 as Instrument No. 20081537022;
(2)   Substitution of
Trustee recorded with the Los Angeles County Recorder on September 4, 2008 as

(5)   Order on Plaintiff's
Ex Parrte Application for Order to Show Cause recorded with the Los Angeles
County Recorder on September 4, 2013 as Instrument No. 20131517257;
(6)   Corporate

Loan Trust 2006-OPT3, recorded with the Los Angeles County Recorder on January
9, 2015 as Instrument No. 20150029691;
(7)   Temporary
Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction recorded with the Los Angeles
County Recorder on March 2, 2016 as Instrument No. 20160229088;
(8)   Trustee's Deed
Upon Sale recorded with the Los Angeles County Recorder on July 13, 2016 as Instrument
No. 2016812935;
(9)   Grant Deed
transferring the Property to MARK MEADOR, as Trustee for 1713 Stearns Laverne
Family Trust Dated August 1, 2012, recorded with the Los Angeles County
Recorder on July 13, 2016 as Instrument No. 20160814985.
Without the court even
determining whether the documents are in fact judicially noticeable, “There is,
however, a precondition to the taking of judicial notice in either its
mandatory or permissive form—any matter to be judicially noticed must be
relevant to a material issue.”  (People
ex rel. Lockyer v. Shamrock Foods Co. (2000) 24 Cal.4th 415, 422 fn. 2.)  Plaintiff does not reference his request for
judicial notice in his opposition. 
Therefore, the request for judicial notice is DENIED. 
Allegations
In 2006, Marcia Chaissions (Chaissions)
obtained an $875,000 loan from Option One Mortgage Corporation (Option One)
secured by a deed of trust.  (FAC ¶¶ 19, 160.)  In June 2006, Option One transferred
the loan to the Option One Mortgage Loan Trust 2006-2 (Option One Trust).  (Id. at ¶ 161.)  
On April 30, 2008, Option One changed its name to Sand
Canyon and sold its mortgage servicing portfolio to American Home
Mortgage Servicing, Inc. ( AHMSI).  (Id.
at ¶¶ 24, 31.)  
On August 21, 2008, AHMSI assigned
the deed of trust to Deutsche Bank National Trust Company
(Deutsche Bank) as trustee for the certificate holders of the Soundview Home
Loan Trust (Soundview Trust).  (Id.
at ¶ 30.)  On July 23, 2008, a sham and void
substitution of trustee was recorded whereby AHMSI Default Services, Inc., was
named as the trustee on the deed of trust and, on July 31, 2009, another shame
and void substitution of trustee was recorded whereby Power Default Services,
Inc. became the trustee on the deed of trust.  (Id. at ¶¶ 32-33.)  
Chaissions defaulted on the loan and
Trust Deed Service Company (T.D.) recorded a notice of default on October 9,
2009.   (Id. at ¶ 36; Ex. “H.”)  The notice reflects that T.D. recorded
the instrument and directed the borrower (Chaissions) to contact Deutsche Bank,
as trustee for the Soundview Trust, care of AHMSI, if she wished to arrange
payment to prevent foreclosure.  (Id.)  T.D. recorded notices of trustee's sale on
January 11, 2010, June 20, 2011, and January 12, 2012.  (Id. at ¶¶ 40, 42, 44; Exs. “I,” “J,” “K.”)
On May
29, 2012, AHMSI’s name was changed to Homeward Residential, Inc.
(Homeward).  (Id.
at ¶ 25.)  
Eventually, on February 12, 2015,
Western Progressive, LLC (Western Progressive) was named as trustee on the deed
of trust.  (Id. at ¶ 148.) 
On August 10, 2015, Western Progressive recorded a notice of
default and election to sell under deed of trust, directing the borrower to
contact Deutsche Bank, as trustee for the Soundview Trust, if the borrower
wished to arrange for payment in order to avoid foreclosure.  (Id. at ¶¶
53,148; Ex. “N.”)  Western
Progressive recorded a notice of trustee's sale on January 19, 2016.  (Id. at  ¶ 54, 148. Ex. “O.”)
The Soundview Trust acquired the
property at a foreclosure sale on July 6, 2016; Western Progressive recorded
the trustee's deed upon sale on July 13, 2016. 
(Id. at  ¶¶ 
92, 141, 156; Ex “T.”) 
Discussion 
Defendants move for
summary judgment, or alternatively, summary adjudication with respect to
Plaintiff’s remaining causes of action in the SAC for wrongful foreclosure, unfair
business practices, cancellation, slander of title, and declaratory relief. 
Alternatively, Defendants
moves for summary adjudication of issues as follows:
Issue 1: Defendants,
and each of them, are entitled to summary adjudication on the SAC’s third cause
of action for wrongful foreclosure because Plaintiff cannot establish that
Defendants lacked the standing to foreclose on the subject real property, and
thus cannot establish an illegal, fraudulent, or willfully oppressive sale of
the real property, or any prejudice or harm. 
Moreover, Plaintiff’s claims are time-barred as to Sand Canyon, if not
all Defendants;
 Issue 2:
Defendants,
and each of them, are entitled to summary adjudication on the SAC’s fifth cause
of action for unfair business practices because Plaintiff cannot establish
standing to pursue this claim, damages caused by Defendants, or any unlawful,
unfair, or fraudulent business practices. 
Moreover, Plaintiff’s claims are time-barred as to Sand Canyon, if not
all Defendants; 
Issue 3: Defendants,
and each of them, are entitled to summary adjudication on the SAC’s sixth cause
of action for cancellation because Plaintiff cannot establish any invalid
instrument as Defendants had clear authority and standing to foreclose on the
subject real property.  Moreover,
Plaintiff’s claims are time-barred as to Sand Canyon, if not all Defendants;
Issue 4: Defendants,
and each of them, are entitled to summary adjudication on the SAC’s seventh cause
of action for slander of title because Plaintiff cannot establish any tortious
injury to property resulting from unprivileged, false, malicious publication of
disparaging statements regarding title to the subject real property, to
plaintiff’s damage.  Moreover,
Plaintiff’s claims are time-barred as to Sand Canyon, if not all Defendants;
and
Issue 5: Defendants,
and each of them, are entitled to summary adjudication on the SAC’s eighth cause
of action for declaratory relief because Plaintiff cannot establish that Defendants
lacked the standing to foreclose on the subject real property, and cannot
establish the existence of an actual, present controversy. 
Remaining Causes of
Action for Wrongful Foreclosure,
Unfair Business Practices, Cancellation, Slander of Title; and Declaratory
Relief
Defendants contend that
Plaintiff’s remaining causes of action in the SAC fail because they depend upon
the same false argument that the foreclosure sale on behalf of Deutsche Bank as
Trustee was invalid.  (Motion, p. 18.) 
Plaintiff’s SAC provides
that the 2008 assignment of the deed of trust from Option One to Deutche Bank
as Trustee was a “sham” and “void” as Option One did not hold the loan to make
a transfer since Option One had transferred the loan in 2006 to the “Option One
Mortgage Loan Trust 2006-2.”  (UMF
No. 1; SAC, ¶¶ 24-57,
88-92, 120-123, 132-167.)  Based on the
foregoing, Plaintiff contends that Deutsche Bank was not the beneficiary and
the resulting foreclosure sale on behalf of Deutsche Bank was invalid and void.  (Id.) 
According to Defendants, the remaining causes of action in the SAC fail
because they depend upon this false argument by Plaintiff.  (Motion, p. 18.)  In his Separate Statement, Plaintiff does not
dispute that his remaining causes of action are based on the allegation that the
foreclosing beneficiary Deutsche Bank as Trustee lacked standing to foreclosure
in 2016.  (UMF No. 1.)  
Defendants contend that the remaining
causes of action fail as a matter of law because (1) Option One sold and
conveyed the subject loan to Deutsche Bank as Trustee in May of 2006; (2)
Deutsche Bank as Trustee possessed the original wet-ink note, endorsed in
blank, at all pertinent times; (3) the foreclosure sale was valid; (4)
Plaintiff’s reliance on purported defects in the “Assignments” of Deed of Trust
recorded in the public record is erroneous; and (5) Plaintiff has not evidence
to support his false argument that the loan was sold and held by “Option One
Mortgage Loan Trust.”
As to Defendants’ first reason, Defendants
argue Option One never sold, transferred, or assigned the subject loan to an
“Option One Mortgage Loan Trust”; instead, the subject loan was sold and
conveyed to Deutsche Bank as Trustee in 2006. 
(UMF Nos. 2-3.)  Thus, Deutsche
Bank had standing to foreclose in 2016. 
(Id.)  Specifically, the
subject loan originated by Option One to borrower Chaissions was sold in 2006,
and deposited, conveyed, and assigned at that time to Deutsche Bank as
Trustee.  (UMF Nos. 2-3.)  The subject loan was not sold, transferred,
or assigned to the "Option One Mortgage Loan Trust 2006-2" or any
other Option One Trust as Plaintiff contends. 
(UMF Nos. 2-4.)  Deutsche Bank as
Trustee had clear authority to foreclose as it continuously held possession of
the original Note endorsed in blank via the Allonge and the original Deed of
Trust at all times from its acquisition of the Loan in 2006 through the
foreclosure sale in July 2016.  (UMF, No.
5.)  Defendants also provide a
declaration from Brian McConnell on behalf of the subject loan’s originating
lender (Sand Canyon Corporation fka Option One Mortgage Corporation) confirming
that.  (UMF Nos. 3-4; Declaration of
Brian McConnell, ¶¶ 6-14 and Exs. 3-5.)  The
foreclosure sale based on borrower's uncured default was valid and each of
Plaintiff's remaining causes of action fail. 
(UMF Nos. 1-13.)  
Based on the foregoing, the Court
finds that Defendants have met their initial burden showing that they had the
authority to foreclose on the subject loan because the subject loan was
transferred by Option One to Deutsche Bank as Trustee, not “Option One Mortgage
Loan Trust 2006-2” as claimed by Plaintiff. 
Therefore, the burden shifts to the Plaintiff to establish a triable
issue of material fact.  
In opposition, Plaintiff states his third
cause of action for wrongful foreclosure, and all derivative causes of action,
should survive even if Defendants did have standing to sue.  (Opposition, p. 1; Declaration of Vincent J
Quigg, ¶ 5.)  Plaintiff also states that “Defendants’
evidence in support of their claim that they had standing to foreclose is also
fatally flawed, and Defendants have failed to prove, so far, that they had
standing to foreclose.”  (Id.)  Specifically, Plaintiff argues the following:
(1) Mr. McConnell never learned who owned the loan in question, so he cannot
assert that Defendants own it; (2) Mr. McConnell searched for the wrong loan
number when he claimed that the subject loan was not on the list of loans
conveyed to Option One Mortgage Loan Trust 2006-2; (3) Mr. McConnell does not
establish whether the loan number would have appeared as the loan number or
servicing number; (4) 031042077 is the loan number that appears on the note,
versus 31042077, which is the number that Mr. McConnell searched for; and (5)
Mr. McConnell also never explained whether the loan would appear in the trust
by its servicing number or its loan.  (Id.
at p. 5.)  
Plaintiff does not provide admissible
evidence to support his claim that the subject loan was sold, transferred, and
assigned to Option One Mortgage Loan Trust. 
Nor does Plaintiff provide factual support for his broad claims
challenging the Declaration of McConnell, which covers the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement, Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement, and Mortgage Loan Schedule that
details the sale of the subject loan and conveyance to Deutsche Bank as Trustee
and specifically identifies the subject loan, borrower, property address, and
other loan details in the loan schedule accompanying the sale agreements.  
Further, Plaintiff agrees with
Defendants that his remaining causes of action are based solely on the
allegation that foreclosing beneficiary Deutsche Bank as Trustee lacked
standing to foreclose in 2016.  (UMF No.
1.)  Plaintiff subsequently states he
“will seek leave of Court to amend the SAC to include additional reasons why he
should recover under [the remaining causes of action].  These additional reasons will not be
premised on the argument Defendants referenced.”  (Id.; see also Declaration of
Vincent J. Quiggs, ¶ 5 “Even if [Defendants] did have such authority, I believe
that the foreclosure sale was illegal and willfully oppressive, and I will
explain this more thoroughly in an amended complaint.”)  Plaintiff does not identify how amendment can
cure his pleadings because he merely states that he will assert a different
reason for his causes of action and his counsel will explain further in an
amended complaint.  Also, considering
trial is set for June and the SAC was filed in 2018, leave to amend at this
stage would be prejudicial to Defendants.
Based on the foregoing, the Court
finds that Plaintiff has failed to meet his burden to raise a triable issue of
material fact, and Plaintiff’s request to amend is improper. 
Accordingly, the court GRANTS
Defendants’ motion for summary judgment as to the remaining causes of action of
the Second Amended Complaint. 
It is so ordered.
