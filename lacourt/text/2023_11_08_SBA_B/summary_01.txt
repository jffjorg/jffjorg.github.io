Summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motion to overrule the demurrer to the fifth cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress. The court finds that the plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts to state a cause of action and that the cause of action is not uncertain. The court also denies the defendants' motion to strike certain portions of the Third Amended Complaint, finding that the allegations support the plaintiff's claims and are not irrelevant, false, or improper. The court orders the defendants to file and serve an Answer within 10 days of this date.
