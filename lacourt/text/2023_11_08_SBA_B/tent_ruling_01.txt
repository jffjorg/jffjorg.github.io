Background
 
Plaintiff’s Complaint was filed on January 3, 2022. Plaintiff’s
First Amended Complaint was filed on June 1, 2022. Plaintiff’s Second Amended
Complaint was filed on February 14, 2023. Plaintiff’s Third Amended Complaint
was filed on August 21, 2023. Plaintiff alleges the following facts. Plaintiff
is a tenant at 327 E. Culver Boulevard, Playa Del Rey, California 90293. Defendants
are the landlords. Toxic mold and asbestos were discovered in Plaintiff’s
apartment. Plaintiff was forced to vacate her apartment for an extended period.
Plaintiff alleges the following causes of action: (1) Breach of Lease; (2) Breach
of Implied Warranty of Habitability; (3) Negligent Maintenance of Premises; (4)
Nuisance; (5) Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress; (6) Breach of Implied
Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment.
 
            Meet and Confer
             
            Defendants set forth meet and confer
declarations in sufficient compliance with CCP § 430.41 and CCP § 435.5.  (Decls. Stephen S. Smyth, ¶¶ 4-5.) 
 
            Demurrer

A demurrer tests the sufficiency of a
complaint as a matter of law and raises only questions of law. (Schmidt v.
Foundation Health (1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 1702, 1706.)  In testing the sufficiency of the complaint,
the court must assume the truth of (1) the properly pleaded factual
allegations; (2) facts that can be reasonably inferred from those expressly
pleaded; and (3) judicially noticed matters. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39
Cal.3d 311, 318.)  The Court may not
consider contentions, deductions, or conclusions of fact or law.  (Moore v. Conliffe (1994) 7 Cal.App.4th
634, 638.) Because a demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of a complaint, the
plaintiff must show that the complaint alleges facts sufficient to establish
every element of each cause of action.  (Rakestraw
v. California Physicians Service (2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 39, 43.)  Where the complaint fails to state facts
sufficient to constitute a cause of action, courts should sustain the demurrer.
 (C.C.P., § 430.10(e); Zelig v. County
of Los Angeles (2002) 27 Cal.App.4th 1112, 1126.)
Sufficient facts are the essential facts
of the case "with reasonable precision and with particularity sufficiently
specific to acquaint the defendant with the nature, source, and extent of his
cause of action.”  (Gressley v.
Williams (1961) 193 Cal.App.2d 636, 643-644.) "Whether the plaintiff will be able to
prove the pleaded facts is irrelevant to ruling upon the demurrer."  (Stevens v. Superior Court (1986) 180
Cal.App.3d 605, 609–610.)  Under Code
Civil Procedure § 430.10(f), a demurrer may also be sustained if a complaint is
“uncertain.” Uncertainty exists where a
complaint’s factual allegations are so confusing they do not sufficiently
apprise a defendant of the issues it is being asked to meet.  (Williams v. Beechnut Nutrition Corp.
(1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 135, 139, fn. 2.)
Defendants demur to the fifth cause of
action on the grounds that the cause of action fails to state facts sufficient
to constitute a cause of action and that the cause of action is uncertain.
            Fifth Cause of Action for Intentional Infliction of
Emotional Distress

            The demurrer to the fifth cause of
action is overruled. Plaintiff states facts sufficient to state a cause of
action and the cause of action is not uncertain.
 
            “A cause of action for IIED requires
proof of: (1) extreme and outrageous conduct by the defendant with the
intention of causing, or reckless disregard of the probability of causing,
emotional distress; (2) the plaintiff suffered severe emotional distress; and
(3) the defendant's extreme and outrageous conduct was the actual and proximate
cause of the severe emotional distress.” Crouch v. Trinity Christian Center
of Santa Ana, Inc. (2019) 39 Cal.App.5th 995, 1007. 
 
“[I]t is clear that the availability of a remedy for
breach of implied warranty of habitability does not preclude a tenant from
suing his landlord for intentional infliction of mental distress if the
landlord's acts are extreme and outrageous and result in severe mental
distress.” Stoiber v. Honeychuck
(1980) 101 Cal.App.3d 903, 921. “Behavior
may be considered outrageous if a defendant (1) abuses a relation or position
which gives him power to damage the plaintiff's interest; (2) knows the
plaintiff is susceptible to injuries through mental distress; or (3) acts
intentionally or unreasonably with the recognition that the acts are likely to
result in illness through mental distress.” Id.
 
            With the Third Amended Complaint,
Plaintiff has now alleged adequate facts to meet the elements of extreme and
outrageous conduct, intent or reckless disregard, and proximate causation. Plaintiff
alleges that she discovered toxic mold and asbestos, and then, had to evacuate
the unit to reside in a different unit. Plaintiff also alleges that she was
forced to move into a smaller unit and that the move exacerbated her back
problems. Plaintiff alleges that Defendant knew of Plaintiff’s back problems.
Plaintiff also states that she is 68-year-old. Because of these facts,
Plaintiff alleges that Defendant knew that Plaintiff was susceptible to
emotional distress. Plaintiff alleges that after being confronted with the mold
issues Defendant attempted to drive Plaintiff out of her rent-controlled unit.
Plaintiff alleges that she gave notice to Defendant on two occasions that the
delay in repair was exacerbating her emotional distress and physical pain, but
that Defendant did nothing to expedite repair, but instead focused on
renovating other units. (TAC, ¶ 42.)  These
facts are sufficient to plead the elements of extreme and outrageous conduct
and intent to cause or reckless disregard of causing emotional distress.  Plaintiff alleges that the actions of
Defendant caused her severe emotional distress.  (TAC, ¶ 43.)  “Where reasonable [minds] may differ, it is
for the jury, subject to the control of the court, to determine whether, in the
particular case, the conduct has been sufficiently extreme and outrageous to
result in liability.” Fuentes v. Perez (1977) 66 Cal.App.3d 163,
172.  
 
            Therefore, the demurrer to the fifth
cause of action is overruled. 
 
            Motion
to Strike  
 
The court may, upon a motion, or at any
time in its discretion, and upon terms it deems proper, strike any irrelevant,
false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading.  CCP § 436(a). 
The court may also strike all or any part of any pleading not drawn or
filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of
the court.  CCP § 436(b).  The grounds for a motion to strike are that
the pleading has irrelevant, false or improper matter, or has not been drawn or
filed in conformity with laws.  CCP §
436.  The grounds for moving to strike
must appear on the face of the pleading or by way of judicial notice.  CCP § 437.
 
Defendants move to strike the following:

 
“1. The portion of paragraph 40, page 9,
line 5 reading “knowingly, intentionally, and willfully.” 2. The portion of
paragraph 40, page 9, line 6 reading “knowingly, intentionally, and willfully.”
3. The portion of paragraph 40, page 9, line 17 reading “knowingly,
intentionally, and willfully.” 4. The portion of paragraph 40, page 9, line 22
reading “knowingly, intentionally, and willfully.” 5. The portion of paragraph

“knowing, intentional, and willful and done with the intention of causing, or
reckless disregard of the probability of causing.” 9. The portion of paragraph
40, page 10, lines 16-19 reading “Defendants’ conduct as alleged herein was
malicious and oppressive. Defendants’ conduct was willful and carried on in
conscious disregard of Plaintiff’s rights, and Defendants acted in conscious
disregard of Plaintiff’s rights, thus subjecting Plaintiff to cruel and unjust
hardship. Plaintiff is thus entitled to recover punitive damages.” 10. The
portion of paragraph 42, page 11, line 8 reading "knowingly,
intentionally, and willfully.” 11. The portion of paragraph 42, page 11, lines
12-13 reading “knowingly, intentionally, and willfully.” 12. The portion of
paragraph 42, page 11, line 28 reading “knowing, intentional, and willful.” 13.

causing.” 14. The portion of paragraph 42, page 12, line 3 reading
“intentionally.” 15. The portion of paragraph 42, page 12, lines 5-6 reading
“knowing, intentional, and willful and done with the intention of causing, or
reckless disregard of the probability of causing.” 16. The entirety of
paragraph 44. 17. Item 4 in the Prayer for Relief for the Fourth Case of
Action. 18. Item 4 in the Prayer for Relief for the Fifth Case of Action. 19.
All references to punitive damages and intentional conduct.” (Notice of Motion,
pages 2, lines 8-27 to 3, lines 1 to 19).
 
Civ. Code, § 3294 states, in relevant
part:
“(a) In an action for the breach of an
obligation not arising from contract, where it is proven by clear and
convincing evidence that the defendant has been guilty of oppression, fraud, or
malice, the plaintiff, in addition to the actual damages, may recover damages
for the sake of example and by way of punishing the defendant.
(b) An employer shall not be liable for
damages pursuant to subdivision (a), based upon acts of an employee of the
employer, unless the employer had advance knowledge of the unfitness of the
employee and employed him or her with a conscious disregard of the rights or
safety of others or authorized or ratified the wrongful conduct for which the
damages are awarded or was personally guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice.
With respect to a corporate employer, the advance knowledge and conscious
disregard, authorization, ratification or act of oppression, fraud, or malice
must be on the part of an officer, director, or managing agent of the
corporation.”
 
Plaintiff has set forth sufficient
specific facts that Defendants acted willfully, maliciously, intentionally,
and/or recklessly to support Plaintiff’s allegations and prayer for punitive
damages. (TAC, ¶¶ 40-44.)  In addition, Plaintiff
has alleged that the acts of oppression, fraud, or malice were conducted by
Defendants themselves to meet the requirements of CC § 3294(b). 
 
Therefore, the motion to strike is denied.
 
Defendants are ordered to file and serve
an Answer within 10 days of this date.
 
Plaintiff is ordered to give notice of
this ruling.
