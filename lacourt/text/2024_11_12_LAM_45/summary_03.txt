And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the motion filed by the plaintiff, which seeks to compel site inspection of the defendant's property and to recover attorney's fees. The motion is unopposed, and the judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to compel site inspection as to one of the defendants, Arcturian Light, LLC, and granted it as to the other defendant, Pleiadian Light, LLC.

The judge has also granted the plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions against the defendants and their counsel of record in the reduced amount of $1,547.50. The judge has ordered the defendants and their counsel to pay this amount to the plaintiff within 20 days of the date of this ruling.

The judge's ruling is based on the plaintiff's failure to respond to the demand for inspection, as well as the defendants' failure to make the property and video footage available for inspection. The judge has also considered the plaintiff's request for attorney's fees, which was reduced from the originally requested amount of $7,532.50 to $1,547.50.
