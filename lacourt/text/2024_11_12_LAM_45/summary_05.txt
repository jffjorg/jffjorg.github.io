And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion to be relieved as counsel for the defendant, Grandmaster Recorders, LLC, filed by Lisa Chinai. The motion was filed due to a breakdown in communication and lack of payment for services rendered by Chinai. The judge found that Chinai has shown a proper basis for withdrawal, but that she failed to provide a sufficient explanation for not seeking the defendant's consent to be relieved as counsel. The judge also noted that the trial is almost a year away and that there is no reason to believe that Chinai's withdrawal would prejudice the defendant. However, the judge denied the motion due to Chinai's failure to file the required declaration and explanation for not seeking consent.
