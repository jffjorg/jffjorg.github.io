Respondent: Taylor &
Ring, Plaintiff L.C.’s Prior Counsel
TENTATIVE RULING
Petitioner B.M.’s Petition for Approval of Compromise
of Claim or Action or Disposition of Proceeds of Judgment for Minor or a Person
with a Disability is TENTATIVELY GRANTED. Plaintiff L.C.’s Counsel is ordered
to file a proposed order with the court forthwith, consistent with this ruling.
BACKGROUND
This
action arises from the sexual abuse of an elementary school student by fellow
students. During the 2016-2017 school year, Plaintiff L.C. was a minor student attending
C.J. Morris Elementary School in the Walnut Valley Unified School District
(WVUSD). During this time, L.C. alleges another classmate sexually abused L.C. on
the school bus and in the classroom. During the 2017-2018 school year, L.C.
alleges other classmates also began to participate in the sexual abuse. When school
administration discovered what was occurring, L.C. alleges they failed to
discipline the abusers which resulted in L.C. leaving the school.
On
January 5, 2021, L.C., by and through guardian ad litem B.M., filed a complaint
against WVUSD and Does 1-60, alleging (1) negligent supervision of minors, (2)
breach of mandatory duty, (3) racial discrimination, (4) violation of Civil
Code sections 51.9 and 52, and (5) negligence. On December 1, the court sustained
a demurrer to the Complaint by WVUSD in part with leave to amend.
On
December 21, 2021, L.C. filed a First Amended Complaint (FAC) against the same
defendants alleging (1) negligent supervision of minors, (2) breach of
mandatory duty, (3) violation of Civil Code sections 51.9 and 52, and (4)
negligence.
On
November 3, 2023, L.C.’s counsel submitted a petition to confirm minor’s compromise.
Subsequently, L.C.’s counsel was replaced by new counsel and the petition was
withdrawn on November 29.
On
March 11, 2024, B.M. submitted the present petition on L.C.’s behalf. On March
28, the court continued the hearing on B.M.’s petition for B.M. to provide
supplemental filings. A hearing is now set for April 22.
ANALYSIS
B.M.
petitions for the court’s approval of a $6,800,000 settlement reached between L.C.
and WVUSD.
Legal Standard
An
enforceable settlement of a minor’s or incompetent’s claim can only be
consummated with court approval. (Prob. Code, §§ 2504, 3500, 3600 et seq.; Code
Civ. Proc., § 372.) For this purpose, a petition for approval must be presented
to the court and until it is granted, there is no final settlement. (Scruton
v. Korean Air Lines Co. (1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 1596, 1603-1606.) Any
settlement agreement therefore is voidable by the minor’s guardian ad litem. (Id.,
at p. 1606.)
Probate
Code section 3600, et seq., governs how the settlement proceeds are to be paid.
Pursuant to Probate Code section 3601, the order shall approve payment of
reasonable expenses from the settlement as follows:
The court making the order or giving the judgment
referred to in Section 3600, as a part thereof, shall make a further order
authorizing and directing that such reasonable expenses (medical or otherwise
and including reimbursement to a parent, guardian, or conservator), costs, and
attorney’s fees, as the court shall approve and allow therein, shall be paid
from the money or other property to be paid or delivered for the benefit of the
minor or incompetent person. (Prob. Code, § 3601, subd. (a).)
In
cases pursuant to Probate Code section 3601, “unless the court has approved the
fee agreement in advance, the court must use a reasonable fee standard when
approving and allowing the amount of attorney’s fees payable from money or
property paid or to be paid for the benefit of a minor or a person with a
disability.” (Cal. Rules of Court 7.955, subd. (a)(1).) In doing so, “[t]he
court must give consideration to the terms of any representation agreement made
between the attorney and the representative of the minor or person with a
disability and must evaluate the agreement based on the facts and circumstances
existing at the time the agreement was made, except where the attorney and the
representative of the minor or person with a disability contemplated that the
attorney's fee would be affected by later events.” (Cal. Rules of Court 7.955,
subd. (a)(2).)
Discussion
The current matter involves the
alleged sexual assault of minor plaintiff L.C. which occurred while L.C. was
attending C.J. Morris Elementary School.
Pursuant to the settlement
agreement reached between the parties, WVUSD will pay a total of $6,800,000 to L.C.
With regards to attorney fees
and costs, B.M. initially requested $2,040,000 in attorney fees, which
constitutes 30% of the gross recovery, and $23,968.73 in costs for L.C.’s
previous counsel. In Attachment 13(a), L.C.’s counsel proposed dividing the
$2,040,000 in requested attorney fees to $1,700,000 (25% of gross recovery) for
L.C.’s former counsel and $340,000 in attorney fees (5% of gross recovery) for
L.C.’s current counsel. (Attach. 13(a), Boyce Decl., Ex. K.) L.C.’s former
counsel opposed B.M.’s request, arguing they are entitled to $2,720,000 or 40%
of the gross recovery as stated in their retainer agreement minus any
reasonable fees awarded to L.C.’s current counsel. (Gehlawat Decl., Ex. B, ¶
4.)
In a hearing on March 28,
2024, the parties agreed to award L.C.’s former counsel attorney fees of
$2,670,000 (39.26% of total recovery) and costs of $23,968.73. (3/28/2024
Minute Order, p. 1-2.) They also agreed to set aside a balance of $50,000 (the
remainder of the 40% contingency fee) for the attorney fees of L.C.’s counsel. During
the hearing, the court also ordered B.M. and L.C.’s counsel to provide
supplemental declarations supporting the request of L.C.’s current counsel for
attorney fees and B.M.’s request for reimbursement of non-litigation costs as
outlined in Exhibit G to the court on or before April 15 by 4:00 PM. (3/28/2024
Minute Order, p. 2.) L.C.’s counsel did not comply with the court’s order
and failed to timely submit the additional supplemental documentation by the
court-mandated deadline.  While
counsel submitted B.M.’s supplemental declaration on April 16, counsel failed
to include a declaration supporting counsel’s request for attorney fees,
including an accounting of the hours counsel spent on the present matter.
Accordingly, the court will treat this failure as a waiver of the right to
attorney fees for L.C.’s current counsel.
B.M.’s initial application
also requested reimbursement of $33,699.20 in non-litigation costs including
$19,200 for tutoring expenses, $5,000 for clothing purchases, $900 for parking
and Uber rides, $165 for court filing, $150 for attorney proof of service,
$1,775 for field trips and supplies, $4,360 for driving costs, and $2,149.20
for taekwondo classes. (Attach. 13(b); B.M. Decl., Ex. G-H.) While B.M. provided
a receipt for the taekwondo classes, B.M. failed to provide any receipts or
evidence to support the other costs. (B.M. Decl., Ex. H.) In a supplemental
declaration, B.M. provided copies of receipts for tutoring expenses totaling
$17,700.[1] (B.M.
Suppl. Decl., Ex. T.) But while B.M.’s supplemental declaration also references
another $6,511.63 in expenses that are supported by an Exhibit U, the court
notes no such exhibit is included with B.M.’s supplemental declaration. (B.M.
Suppl. Decl., ¶ 9-11.) Because L.C.’s counsel failed to provide documentation
for these other expenses, the court finds they have been waived. Thus, the
court will limit the award of costs for B.M. to $20,479.20, including $2,464.20
for the taekwondo classes, $315 for court filing and service fees, and $17,700
for L.C.’s tutoring expenses.
Accordingly, after prior
counsel’s fees and costs of $2,693,968.73 and B.M.’s approved costs of $20,479.20
are deducted, the court finds L.C. will receive a net total of $4,085,552.07.
B.M.’s petition requests that L.C.’s settlement funds be invested in a
single-premium deferred annuity. The proposal attached to the petition is for a
structured settlement through the Atlas Settlement Group (Atlas Proposal). The Atlas
Proposal proposes an estimated monthly payment of $4,000 from July 2024 until
October 2026 when L.C. reaches the age of majority. (Attach. 18(b)(3), e.p.
37.) In November 2026, an estimated monthly payment of $3,000 is guaranteed for
seven years until 2033. (Attach. 18(b)(3), e.p. 37.) In 2030, annual payments
of $90,000 are also guaranteed for three years. (Attach. 18(b)(3), e.p. 38.) Starting
in 2033, L.C. is guaranteed $14,299 monthly payments for forty years with 2%
compounded interest. (Attach. 18(b)(3), e.p. 38.) In addition, L.C. will also
be guaranteed lump sum payments every five years starting with $100,000 in 2033
and increasing by $100,000 every five years until 2053. (Attach. 18(b)(3), e.p.
38.) The proposal also includes an education fund of $260,000 to be disbursed
in increments of $50,000 at 18 years of age, $60,000 at 19 years of age,
$70,000 at 20 years of age, and $80,000 at 21 years of age. (Attach. 18(b)(3),
e.p. 37.)
While no other option is
selected in the petition, L.C.’s counsel notes B.M. would prefer an actively
managed investment. The second proposal requests that the funds be transferred
to a trust for active management by Keeshawn Andrew, an investment advisor with
Primerica Financial Services (Andrew Proposal). (Attach. 10(c), Ex. F, e.p. 17.)
The Andrews Proposal proposes that L.C.’s settlement funds be invested
California municipal bonds with staggered maturity dates. (Attach. 10(c), Ex.
F, e.p. 17) Andrew estimates interest income of $200,000 to $272,000 on annual
basis with the first three years of income being reinvested until L.C. reaches
the age of majority. (Attach. 10(c), Ex. F, e.p. 18.) The Andrew Proposal also
suggests setting aside funds of $160,000 for future medical expenses and
establishing a 529 plan account for education expenses in the amount of $335,000.
(Attach. 10(c), Ex. F, e.p. 19.)
Upon reviewing the proposals,
the court finds the Andrews Proposal appropriate and in the best interests of
the minor. Pursuant to Probate Code section 3611, subdivision (g), the court
may order “[t]hat the remaining balance of the money and other property be paid
or delivered to the trustee of a trust which is created by, or approved of, in
the order or judgment referred to in Section 3600. This trust shall be
revocable by the minor upon attaining the age of 18 years, and shall contain
other terms and conditions, including, but not limited to, terms and conditions
concerning trustee’s accounts and trustee’s bond, as the court determines to be
necessary to protect the minor’s interests.”
Accordingly, B.M.’s petition
is TENTATIVELY GRANTED and L.C.’s counsel is ordered to file a proposed order
that includes the terms for the proposed trust.
