COURT’S [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: 
Motion to Compel
  Deposition of Plaintiff
 
 



 
 

 
I.               
BACKGROUND 
 
This case arises
out of a car accident. (Complaint p. 4.) On January 24, 2022, Plaintiffs Maria
Skaleris and Peter Daniel Doss filed a complaint against Defendants Rafael
Fajardo and Does 1 to 25, alleging Defendants “owned and operated their vehicle
negligently and carelessly, proximately causing property damage and personal
injury to Plaintiffs.” (Complaint p. 4.)
 
On February 5,
2024, Defendant Rafael Fajardo (“Defendant”) moved to compel Plaintiff Daniel
Doss’ (“Plaintiff”) appearance at a deposition. The court denied Defendant’s
motion because Defendant had not submitted a meet and confer declaration.
(04/08/24 Minute Order.) 
 
On April 26, 2024,
Defendant filed a second motion to compel Plaintiff’s deposition. The court
denied Defendant’s motion without prejudice because Defendant had not given
Plaintiff the requisite statutory notice. (05/20/24 Minute Order.)
 
On June 3, 2024,
Defendant filed a third motion to compel Plaintiff’s deposition. The case was
then reassigned to this department. (07/30/24 Minute Order.) On August 12,
2024, Defendant filed the motion to compel Plaintiff’s deposition with this
department. (the “Motion”). No opposition has been filed.
 
II.             
DISCUSSION
  
A.   
Meet and Confer
 
“[W]hen the deponent fails to attend the
deposition . . . [the motion must be accompanied] by a declaration stating that
the petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire about the nonappearance.”  (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §¿2025.450(b)(2).)
"Implicit in the requirement that counsel contact the deponent to inquire
about the nonappearance is a requirement that counsel listen to the reasons
offered and make a good faith attempt to resolve the issue," including by
rescheduling.  (Leko v. Cornerstone Bldg. Inspection Serv. (2001)
86 Cal.App.4th 1109, 1123.)
 
Defendant’s counsel’s declaration states he scheduled
Plaintiff’s deposition four times between April 6, 2023, and January 4, 2024,
but Plaintiff failed to appear. (Ahdoot Declaration ¶¶ 10-13.) On April 18, 2024,
Defendant’s counsel contacted Plaintiff about his non-appearance. (Ahdoot
Declaration ¶ 15.) Plaintiff has not responded. (Ahdoot Declaration ¶ 16.)
 
The
court is satisfied that counsel inquired about Plaintiff’s nonappearance and
has made a good faith attempt to resolve the issue.
 
B.   
Notice
 
“[A]ll
moving and supporting papers shall be served and filed at least 16 court days
before the hearing.” (Code Civ. Proc.§ 1005.) “However, if the notice is served by
mail, the required 16-day period of notice before the hearing shall be
increased by five calendar days if the place of mailing and the place of
address are within the State of California.” (Code Civ. Proc.§ 1005(b).)
 
The hearing is set for October 1,
2024.  Sixteen court days before October
1, 2024, is September 6, 2024. Plaintiff was served by mail.  (08/12/24 Proof of Service.) Thus, Plaintiff
must have been served with the moving papers no later than September 1,
2024.  Defendant served Plaintiff on
August 12, 2024. (08/12/24 Proof of Service.) 

 
Thus, Defendant provided Plaintiff with
the requisite statutory notice.
 
C.    Motion to
Compel Deposition Attendance
 
A motion to compel deposition attendance
may be brought when a party fails to appear for a deposition following service
of a deposition notice without having served a valid objection under Cal. Code
Civ. Proc. §¿2025.410. (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §¿2025.450(a).) 
 
Defendant’s
counsel’s declaration states that after receiving no communication from
Plaintiff regarding his availability for the deposition, Defendant unilaterally
set Plaintiff’s deposition for April 6, 2023. (Ahdoot Declaration ¶ 10.)  Plaintiff was served on March 16, 2023, but he failed to
appear at the deposition. (Ahdoot Declaration ¶ 10.) Defendant again
unilaterally set Plaintiff’s deposition for May 15, 2023. (Ahdoot Declaration ¶ 11.) Plaintiff was served on April 27,
2023, but failed to appear. (Ahdoot Declaration ¶ 11; Ex. B.) Defendant
rescheduled Plaintiff’s deposition for November 21, 2023. (Ahdoot Declaration ¶
12.) Plaintiff was served on October 27, 2023, but failed to appear. (Ahdoot
Declaration ¶ 12; Ex. C.) Defendant rescheduled Plaintiff’s
deposition for January 4, 2024. (Ahdoot Declaration ¶ 13.) Plaintiff was served
December 1, 2023, but failed to appear. (Ahdoot Declaration ¶ 13; Ex. E.) 
 
Accordingly,
because Plaintiff was served with multiple deposition notices, but did not
appear or serve a valid objection, Defendant’s motion to compel Plaintiff’s
deposition attendance is granted. 
 
D.   
Sanctions 
 
If a motion to
compel deposition attendance is granted, “the court shall impose a monetary
sanction . . . in favor of the party who noticed the deposition and against the
deponent or the party with whom the deponent is affiliated, unless the court
finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification
or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc. §¿2025.410(g)(1).)
“As to the amount of¿sanctions,¿section 2030.030, subdivision (a) authorizes
the trial court to impose an amount representing ‘the reasonable expenses,
including attorney's fees, incurred by anyone as a result’ of a party's misuse
of the discovery process.” (Parker v. Wolters Kluwer United States, Inc.
(2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 285, 294.) 
 
Plaintiff requests $1,050.00
in attorneys’ fees. (Motion p. 5; Ahdoot Declaration ¶ 23.) This amount reflects $210.00
hourly rate for “[four] hours of attorney time in connection with preparing
[the] Motion and related documents, and an additional hour . . . to appear for
the hearing.” (Motion p. 5; Ahdoot Declaration ¶¶ 21-23.) 
 
The court finds Plaintiff
did not act with substantial justification and no other circumstances make the
imposition of sanctions unjust. The court also finds that Plaintiff’s failure
to attend the scheduled depositions represents a misuse of the discovery
process. The court also finds a reduction of time spent preparing the Motion is
warranted because the Motion is not complex. The court therefore reduces the
four hours requested to two hours. 
 
Accordingly, Defendant’s
request for monetary sanctions against Plaintiff is granted in the reduced
total amount of $630.00, reflecting two hours of preparation for the Motion and
one hour for the hearing at $210.00 per hour.
 
III.           
CONCLUSION
 
Accordingly, Defendant’s
motion to compel Plaintiff’s deposition is GRANTED.  Plaintiff is ordered to appear for his
deposition within thirty (30) days, on a date agreeable to Defendants. Defendant’s request for sanctions against Plaintiff is
GRANTED in the reduced amount of $630.00.
