And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

"Based on the information presented, the court grants the Defendant City of Los Angeles's motion for judgment on the pleadings without leave to amend. The Plaintiff General Insurance Company of America failed to file a timely government claim under the Government Claims Act, and the record shows that the City Clerk's office did not receive a claim from the Plaintiff. The court finds that the Plaintiff's claim is time-barred and therefore the action is barred. The Defendant's motion is granted, and the Plaintiff's complaint is dismissed."
