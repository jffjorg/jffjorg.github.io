COURT’S [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: 
Judgment on the
  Pleadings
 
 



 
 
 
Defendant City of Los Angeles moves for judgment on the pleadings
without leave to amend and a judgment dismissing the complaint. 
 
The court grants Defendant’s motion.
 
I.               
BACKGROUND
 
A tree fell on Orig Zelig’s residence. (Complaint ¶¶ 7, 9-10.) Plaintiff Insurance Company of America, Zelig’s
insurer, paid for the damage. (Complaint ¶ 10.) On February 13, 2024, Plaintiff
filed a complaint against Defendant City of Los Angeles and Does 1 through 25,
alleging that on or about February 24, 2023, Defendants did not properly
maintain the tree that caused the damage. (Complaint ¶ 9.)
 
On August 26, 2024, Defendant City of Los Angeles (“Defendant”)
filed a Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings. Plaintiff filed no opposition. On
September 19, 2024, Defendant filed a reply to Plaintiff’s non-opposition. 
 
II.            
JUDICIAL NOTICE
 
Defendant requests the court take judicial notice of Plaintiff’s
complaint. Defendant’s request is denied, as there is no need to take judicial
notice since the court can review the records of the case at hand. 
 
Defendant also requests the court take judicial notice of City
Clerk Michael Valdivia’s declaration. “If a plaintiff alleges compliance with
the claims presentation requirement, but the public records do not reflect
compliance, the governmental entity can request the court to take judicial
notice under Evidence code section 452, subdivision (c) that the entity’s
records do not show compliance." (Gong v. City of Rosemead (2014)
226 Cal.App.4th 363, 376.) Defendant’s request for judicial notice
of the City Clerk’s declaration is granted.
 
III.          
DISCUSSION
 
a.     Legal Standard
 
Under
the Government Claims Act, “[a] claim relating to a cause of action for death
or for injury to person or to personal property . . . shall be presented . . .
no later than six months after the accrual of the cause of action.” (Gov. Code
§ 911.4(a).) The party may file a lawsuit for money or damages only if the
public entity denies or rejects the claim (either expressly or by operation of
law). (Gov. Code §§ 905, 945.4; City of Ontario v. Superior Court (1993)
12 Cal.App.4th 894, 898.)¿ The claims presentation requirement provides the
public entity with an opportunity to evaluate the claim and decide whether to
pay on the claim.¿ (Roberts v. County of Los Angeles (2009) 175
Cal.App.4th 474, 480.)¿
¿¿ 
A
party may apply for leave to present an untimely claim (Govt. Code § 911.4),
which the board “shall grant or deny … within 45 days after it is presented to
the board.” (Govt. Code § 911.6(a). “The claimant and the board may extend the
period within which the board is required to act on the application by written
agreement made before the expiration of the period.” (Gov. Code § 911.6(a).)
“The board shall grant the application if one of more of the following is
applicable: (1) The failure to present the claim was through mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect and the public entity was not
prejudiced in its defense of the claim by the failure to present the claim
within the time specified in Section 911.2.” (Gov. Code § 911.6(b).)¿¿¿¿ 
¿ 
“If
the board fails or refuses to act on an application within the time prescribed
by this section, the application shall be deemed to have been denied on the 45th
day or, if the period within which the board is required to act is extended by
agreement pursuant to this section, the last day of the period specified in the
agreement.” (Gov. Code § 911.6(c).) “In all circumstances, a late claim
application is deemed denied after 45 days, even though section 911.6(b)(2)
would entitle the [individual] to relief if the application had merit. By
placing this limitation on the entity’s time to act, the Legislature ensured
that applications would not languish.” (J.M. v. Huntington Beach Union High
School Dist. (2017) 2 Cal.5th 648, 653.)¿ 
¿ 
“If
an application for leave to present a claim is denied or deemed to be denied
pursuant to Section 911.6, a petition may be made to the court for an order
relieving the petitioner from Section 945.4.” (Gov. Code § 946.6(a).) The
petition shall show each of the following: (1) the application was denied or
deemed denied, (2) the reason for the failure to present a timely claim, and
(3) information required in section 910. (Gov. Code § 946.6(b).) “The applicant
has six months to seek relief in court ‘after the application to the
[entity] is denied or deemed to be denied.’ The six-month period
‘operates as a statute of limitations. It is mandatory, not discretionary.’” (J.M.,
supra, 2 Cal.5th at 653 (alterations and emphasis in original,
citations omitted).)¿ ‘
 
b.     Analysis
 
Plaintiff’s
complaint alleges that on or about February 24, 2023, Defendant “negligently,
carelessly, and or recklessly cared for, managed, owned, possessed, and or
otherwise controlled, the area around its power lines, including but not
limited to allowing for years the power lines to rub up against trees” and
“[a]s a direct and proximate result . . . Insured sustained substantial damage
to his property when a tree having suffered damage from the years of rubbing
against a power line fell onto his residence.” (Complaint ¶¶ 8-9.) Because the injury occurred on or about February
24, 2023, Plaintiff had until August 24, 2023, to file a claim under the
Government Claims Act.
 
Defendant
argues Plaintiff failed to file a timely government claim within six months
after the incident. (Motion p. 4.) Defendant submits a declaration by a Deputy
City Clerk dated August 21, 2024, stating that “[t]he City Clerk was requested
by the Office of the Los Angeles City Attorney to determine whether a Claim for
Damages (“Claim”) had been filed by, General Insurance Company of America on
behalf of its insured Ori Zelig for an alleged incident on February 24, 2023 at
or near 6008 Melvin Avenue in the City of Tarzana.” (Valdivia Declaration ¶ 4.) The Deputy City Clerk’s declaration states that
“[a]fter a diligent search of the City’s records, it was determined that the
Office of the City Clerk does not have any record of receiving a claim from or
on behalf [of] Orig Zelig and/or from plaintiff General Insurance Company of
America for an incident date of February 24, 2023 at the subject location.”
(Valdivia Declaration ¶ 5.) 
 
Plaintiff’s
complaint alleges it was required to and did comply with the applicable claims
statute, but Plaintiff filed no opposition showing it filed a timely government
claim. (Complaint ¶ 4.)
 
Therefore, because the record shows that
Plaintiff did not timely file a claim, the action is barred.
 
IV.          
CONCLUSION
 
In this case, granting leave to amend would be futile because the
cause of action is time-barred. 
 
Accordingly, the court grants Defendant’s Motion for Judgment on
the Pleadings without leave to amend.
