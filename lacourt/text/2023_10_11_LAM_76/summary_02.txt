Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the motion to quash the deposition subpoena for production of business records served upon Wells Fargo and has also granted the request for a protective order. The court has also granted the request for sanctions against the plaintiff in the reduced amount of $1,250.

The court found that the plaintiff did not provide sufficient facts to justify the discovery requests, and therefore, the requests were overly broad and oppressive. The court also found that the plaintiff did not demonstrate good cause for the discovery requests, which was required under California law.

The court notes that while the scope of civil discovery is broad, it is not limitless, and discovery devices must be used as tools to facilitate litigation rather than as weapons to wage litigation. The court also cites previous cases that emphasize the importance of setting forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the discovery sought.

The court's ruling is based on the California Code of Civil Procedure and the California Civil Code, and the court relies on previous case law to support its decision.
