Background
 
on December 4, 2019, Iris Echeverria and
Carlos Castano (collectively “Plaintiffs”) filed a Complaint against Kia Motors
America (“Kia” or “Defendant”) and Does 1 to 10. The Complaint alleged three
causes of action related to violations of the Song-Beverly Act: (1) breach of
express warranty, (2) breach of implied warranty, and (3) breach of Civil Code
§ 1793.2.
 
After a trial that
began August 14, 2023, the jury rendered a verdict on August 31, 2023. The jury
found in favor of the Plaintiffs as to the first and third causes of action,
but not the second cause of action. (8/31/23 Verdict.) The jury awarded
Plaintiff damages in the total sum of $149,435.80.  
On September 15, 2023,
Plaintiffs filed a memorandum of costs seeking to recover $65,003.69 in costs. On
October 3, 2023, Defendant Kia filed a Motion to Tax Costs. Plaintiffs oppose
the motion. The matter is now before the court. 
motion to
tax costs
I.         Legal Standard
 
Under
the Song-Beverly Act, the prevailing party can recover “costs and expenses . .
. based on actual time expended, determined by the court to have been
reasonably incurred by the buyer in connection with the commencement and
prosecution of such action.” (Civ. Code, § 1794(d).)  
 
Assuming
the “prevailing party” requirements are met, the trial court has no discretion
to order each party to bear his or her own costs of suit.¿ (Michell v. Olick
(1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 1194, 1198; Nelson v. Anderson (1999) 72
Cal.App.4th 111, 129.) 
 
After judgment is entered, the prevailing party “who claims costs
must serve and file a memorandum of costs within 15 days after the date of
service of the notice of entry of judgment or dismissal, or within 180 days
after entry of judgment, whichever is first.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1700(a).) “The memorandum of costs must be verified by a statement of the
party, attorney, or agent that to the best of his or her knowledge the items of
cost are correct and were necessarily incurred in this case.” (Id.)¿¿ 
¿¿ 
In turn, the losing party may file a motion to strike or tax
costs. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1700(b).) Procedurally, “[a]ny notice of
motion to strike or to tax costs must be served and filed 15 days after service
of the cost memorandum.” (Id.) “Unless the objection is made to the
entire cost memorandum, the motion to strike or tax costs must refer to each
item objected to by the same number and appear in the same order as the
corresponding cost item claimed on the memorandum of costs and must state why
the item is objectionable.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1700(b)(2).)
“Allowable costs shall be¿reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation
rather than merely convenient or beneficial to its preparation.” (CCP §
1033.5(c)(2).)¿¿ 
 
II.        Discussion
 
The
Plaintiffs’ Memorandum of Costs seeks to recover $65,0003.69 in
costs. Defendant Kia now moves to strike the Memorandum of Costs or tax
$60,051.00 in costs as follows: 
 
1)    
$199.70 in Filing and Motion fees,
claimed under Item 1;
2)    
$3,262.15 in Deposition costs, claimed
under Item 4;
3)    
$2,004.28 in Service of Process costs,
claimed under Item 5;
4)    
$70.00 in Ordinary Witness fees,
claimed under Item 8(a);
5)    
$21,228.36 in Expert fees, claimed
under Item 8(b);
6)    
$1,474.27 in Models, Blowups, and
Photocopies of Exhibits, claimed under Item 11;
7)    
$17,145.00 in Court Reporter fees,
claimed under Item 12; and
8)    
$14,667.24 in “Other” costs, claimed
under Item 13. 
 
Defendant
Kia argues that the Plaintiffs’ cost should be stricken because the costs are
excessive and not reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation. (CCP §
1033.5(c)(2). 
 
A verified memorandum
of costs is prima facie evidence that the costs, expenses, and services therein
listed were necessarily incurred. (See Rappenecker v. Sea-Land Serv., Inc.
(1979) 93 Cal.App.3d 256, 266 (Rappenecker).) A party seeking to tax
costs must provide evidence to rebut this prima facie showing.  (Jones v. Dumrichob (1998) 63
Cal.App.4th 1258, 1266.) Mere statements unsupported by facts are insufficient
to rebut the prima facie showing that costs were necessarily incurred. (Ibid.)
“If the
items in a cost memorandum appear proper, the verified memorandum is
prima facie evidence the expenses were necessarily incurred by the defendant.
The burden of showing an item is not properly chargeable or is unreasonable
falls on the objector.” (Benach v. County of Los Angeles (2007)
149 Cal.App.4th 836, 858.) Therefore, the burden is on Defendant Kia to show
that Plaintiffs’ costs were not reasonably incurred. 
 
A.        Item 1:
Filing and Motion Fees
 
Defendant
Kia objects to $199.70 in costs incurred relating to filing and motion fees
because the fees were unnecessarily incurred. Defendant Kia alleges that
Plaintiffs filed and “downloaded” various matters including an ex parte motion
and other motions that did not advance the litigation such that all filing fees
should be stricken except the $435.00 fee for filing the initial complaint. 
 
Plaintiffs
as the prevailing parties are entitled to recover costs, including but not
limited to filing fees. (CCP § 1033.5(a)(1).) Defendant Kia fails to point to
any case law or statute that limits Plaintiffs’ fee recovery to only those
arguments or motions that were successfully argued or granted. (See Sundance
v. Municipal Court (1987) 192 Cal.App.3d 268, 273 [“[A]
a practical matter, it is impossible for an attorney to determine before
starting work on a potentially meritorious legal theory whether it will or will
not be accepted by a court years later following litigation”].)
 
Therefore,
filing and motion fees will not be taxed. 


B.        Item 4:
Deposition Costs
 
Defendant
Kia seeks to tax $3,262.15 in deposition costs on the basis that only
Plaintiff’s deposition, the person most knowledgeable of Kia of Downtown LA,
the person most knowledgeable of Kia, and one deposition of Kia’s expert,
Albert Perez, were the only depositions necessary in this action. Defendant Kia
argues that there was no need to take the deposition of the dealership
personnel and service advisors because they kept contemporaneous records in
their repair orders. Therefore, Kia argues that deposition costs should be
taxed. 
 
Plaintiffs
assert that Defendant Kia refused to stipulate to the admissibility of the
repair orders at trial so the depositions were necessary to make them
admissible at trial. (Devabose Decl. ¶ 6, Ex. C.) Plaintiffs also state it was
necessary to depose personnel who worked on the subject vehicle and have the
transcripts to prepare for trial as the personnel could be called by either
party to testify at trial or to rebut expert testimony. Furthermore, deposition
costs are a permitted cost. (CCP § 1033.5(a)(3).) Plaintiffs also provide
copies of their internal spreadsheet and relevant invoices to collaborate these
costs and show their reasonableness. (Devabose Decl. ¶¶ 4-8, Ex. A-e.) 
 
The
court finds the deposition costs were reasonably incurred and will not be
taxed. 
 
C.        Item 5:
Service of Process Costs
 
Defendant
Kia similarly asserts that $2,004.28 in service of process costs were not
reasonably incurred because the depositions of various Kia personnel were not
necessarily incurred. However, as stated above, the court found that the
deposition costs were necessarily incurred; then so too were the service of
process costs to serve the deposition notices. 
 
Accordingly,
Item 5 will not be taxed. 
 
D.        Item 8:
Ordinary and Expert Fees
 
Defendant
Kia objects to the $70.00 paid in ordinary witness fees to Frank Gonzalez, “who
no longer works for Kia Downtown LA,” because Plaintiff failed to provide
receipts. However, a verified memorandum of costs is prima facie evidence and
Defendant has failed to rebut this evidence and show that the costs were not
reasonably incurred. (Rappenecker, supra, 93 Cal.App.3d at p.
266.) Therefore, ordinary witness fees will not be taxed. 
 
Defendant
Kia argues that the Plaintiffs’ case did not require an expert and that expert
fees based on 53 hours of work, at varying rates, are unreasonable and
excessive. Defendant Kia also argues that expert fees are not an allowable cost
except when authorized by law. (CCP § 1033.5(b)(1).) 
Plaintiffs
point out that expert witness fees are recoverable under the Song-Beverly Act
even though they are not recoverable under CCP § 1033.5. 
 
The Legislature intended the word
‘expenses’ to cover items not included in the detailed statutory definition of
‘costs,’ and the legislative history of the statute indicates that the Legislature
exercised its power to determine selectively the types of actions and
circumstances in which expert witness fees should be recoverable as costs so as
to permit the recovery of expert witness fees by prevailing buyers under the
[Song-Beverly Act].

(Jensen v.
BMW of North America, Inc. (1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 112, 119 (Jensen).)
 
Plaintiffs
further assert that their expert witness fees were reasonably incurred because
Anthony Micale's fees include time spent reviewing documents to prepare for the
vehicle inspection, traveling to the vehicle inspection, preparing to discuss
the vehicle inspection, repair orders, and preparing for trial. Plaintiffs
include a spreadsheet of the fees incurred by Mr. Micale in this matter and Mr.
Micale’s invoices. (Devabose Decl. ¶¶ 4-5, Ex. A-B.) Plaintiffs also explain
that Mr. Micale’s fees vary because his rate varies depending on the task. Mr.
Micale’s expertise was also necessary to determine the subject vehicle’s
defect, the existence of those defects, what Kia knew, and how Kia chose to respond
to the Plaintiffs’ demands under the Song-Beverly Act. 
As
Defendant Kia fails to show that the expert witness costs were unreasonably
incurred, they will not be taxed. 
 
E.        Item 11: Models, Blowups, and Photocopies
of Exhibit Costs
Defendant Kia argues that
$1,474.27 should be taxed from Item 11 because the costs were not reasonably
incurred since Plaintiffs failed to provide any receipts and how each item was
used at trial to aid the jury. 
In opposition, the Plaintiffs
provide invoices for the costs in Item 11. (Devabose Decl. ¶ 7, Ex. D.) The
court finds that Defendant Kia has failed to meet its burden of showing that
the costs in Item 11 were not reasonably incurred. 
Therefore, Item 11 will not be
taxed. 
F.        Item 12:
Court Reporter Fees
 
Defendant
Kia states that $17,145.00 in court reporter costs were excessive because under
the Los Angeles Superior Court fee schedule, court reporters receive $764.00
for proceeding over 4 hours and $382.00 for proceedings between 1 and 4 hours,
and a per diem of $30.00 for proceedings under 1 hour. Defendant Kia states
that none of the hearings in this case lasted more than one hour and that court
transcripts not ordered by the court are not allowable costs. (CCP, §
1033.5(b)(5).) Therefore, court reporter fees should be taxed. 
 
Court reporter fees are an allowable cost under
the CCP § 1033.5(a)(11). “Any allowable costs must be ‘reasonably¿necessary¿to
the conduct of the litigation rather than merely convenient or beneficial to
its preparation,’ and reasonable in amount.¿(CCP § 1033.5(c)(2), (3).)” (Bender v. County of Los Angeles¿(2013) 217
Cal.App.4th 968, 990.) Plaintiffs assert that the court reporter costs
were necessary in case there was a dispute between the parties as to what
occurred at said proceedings and as evidence for later motions. Second,
Defendant Kia signed and acquiesced to the use of a court reporter at the
hearings. Third, the court does not automatically provide a court reporter for
every hearing and does not guarantee their availability such that the Plaintiffs
needed to retain independent court reporters to transcribe the proceedings
leading up to and through trial. The Plaintiffs also provide a spreadsheet
detailing the costs for the court reporter fees and the supporting invoices.
(Devabose Decl. ¶ 8, Ex. E.) 
 
As
explained above, the Song-Beverly Act and not CCP § 1033.5 governs this action.
(Jensen, supra, 35 Cal.App.4th at p. 119.) The Song-Beverly Act
permits the recovery of “costs and expenses . . . based on actual time expended, determined
by the court to have been reasonably incurred by the buyer in connection
with the commencement and prosecution of such action.” (Civ. Code, § 1794(d).)
Here, Defendant Kia fails to show that the court reporter costs and transcripts
were not reasonably incurred and that certain hearings did not require a court
reporter. Moreover, Defendant Kia signed and acquiesced to the use of a court
reporter such that Kia is barred from arguing only the court’s minute order
should have been used to ascertain what was said at the hearings. Furthermore,
Defendant Kia fails to cite case law to show that privately engaged court
reporters must charge fees pursuant to the Los Angeles Superior Court fee
schedule for court reporter services for the fees to be reasonable. 
 
As
Defendant Kia has failed to show that the court reporter fees were not
reasonably incurred, Item 12 will not be taxed. 
 
G.        Item 13:
Other Costs
 
Defendant
Kia seeks to strike $14,667.24 in other costs incurred. 
 
a.         Attorney Service and Messengers 
 
Defendant
Kia argues that attorney service and messenger fees were not reasonably
necessary to the conduct of the litigation but fails to explain why. 
 
Plaintiffs assert that the attorney service and messenger fees
were related to the “prosecution of this action” for purposes of filing
documents such as the Complaint and Case Management Statement. (See Ladas
v. California State Automobile Association (1993) 19
Cal.App.4th 761, 776.) Moreover, the use of a
lower-cost attorney service to file documents was more cost-effective than
sending an attorney incurring a lodestar hourly rate. Thus, the court agrees
that attorney service and messenger fees were reasonably incurred. 
 
                        b.         PGI Invoices
 
Defendant
Kia objects to the $1,366.50 in costs due to Plaintiffs’ billing for “PGI
Invoices” on the basis that the costs do not appear proper. In response, the
Plaintiffs provide PGI invoices, which indicate that the costs were incurred to
locate the addresses of Riley Hope and Frank Gonzalez. (Devabose Decl. ¶ 4, Ex.
A.) Defendant Kia states that TLOxp service from TransUnion provides public
background checks on individuals and that such a search should cost less than
$100.00. (Reply at 7: 23-26.) However, Defendant Kia fails to provide a
declaration showing that address location service costs should be in the
$100.00 range. The fact that Defendant Kia finds the costs excessive is not
sufficient to rebut Plaintiffs’ Memorandum of Cost attesting that the costs
were reasonably incurred. 
 
Therefore,
the PGI invoice costs will not be taxed. 
 
c.
        Travel Expenses
 
Plaintiffs
also assert that travel costs, including parking and mileage, are recoverable
costs under the Civ. Code § 1794(d) because the costs were reasonably incurred.
Exhibit A to the Declaration of Deepak Devabose includes a spreadsheet
itemizing the travel expenses. Most travel expenses related to mileage and
parking to attend hearings; thus these costs were reasonably incurred in the
prosecution of this action. (Civ. Code § 1794(d).) However, the court finds
that meal expenses were not reasonably incurred. 
 
While section 1033.5, subdivision (a)(3) allows the cost of taking and transcribing depositions
and ‘travel expenses to attend depositions,’ it does not mention meals eaten
while attending local depositions. Nor can meal expenses be justified as
‘necessary to the conduct of the litigation’ since attorneys have to eat,
whether they are conducting litigation or not.
 
(Ladas,
supra, 19 Cal.App.4th at p. 774 [italics added].) 

The court finds that meal expenses were not reasonably incurred and should be
taxed. 
 

$10.04
     for meal for “KE” incurred on 3/21/23
$15.17
     for meal for “KE” incurred on 6/21/23
$7.64
     for meal for “JMP” incurred on 8/14/23
$9.27
     for feal for “JMP” incurred on 8/15/23
$8.40
     for meal for “JMP” incurred on 8/16/23
$64.10
     for meal for “BPS and JMP” incurred on 8/17/23
$5.85
     for meal for “JMP” incurred on 8/17/23
$6.55
     for meal for “JMP” incurred on 8/18/23
$65.00
     for meal for “BPS and JMP” incurred on 8/21/23
 

Accordingly,
$192.02 will be taxed from Item 13. 
 
d.         Mediation Costs 
 
Defendant
Kia fails to explain why mediation costs should be taxed and why such costs are
not recoverable under the Song-Beverely Act. Plaintiffs’ opposition further
asserts this case was resolved for more than what Defendant Kia offered at
mediation such that the costs were reasonable. 
 
Therefore,
mediation costs will not be taxed from Item 13.
 
e.         Interpreter Fees
 
Defendant
Kia argues that interpreter fees are not recoverable because under CCP § 1033.5(a)(12),
interpreter fees are only recoverable when the matter involves court
interpreter fees authorized by the court for an indigent person represented by
a qualified legal services project. 
 
Plaintiffs
argue that the costs recoverable under the Song-Beverly Act are more expansive
than under CCP § 1033.5 because it includes “costs and expenses” “incurred by
the buyer in connection with the commencement and prosecution of such action.”
(Civ. Code § 1794(d).) Plaintiffs only understood Spanish, which is why
interpreters were needed. A spreadsheet of the interpreter costs is included in
Exhibit A to the Declaration of Deepak Devabose. 
 
In
reply, Defendant Kia argues that the interpreter costs do not follow the rates
set forth in the Payment Policies for Independent Contractor Interpreters
published by the Judicial Council. However, those rates pertain to the payment
for independent contractor interpreters retained by the California trial
courts rather than by independent counsel. 
Defendant Kia again fails to point to case law or statutes that require
the Plaintiffs’ counsel to use interpreters that charge rates similar to those
set by the Judicial Council. 
 
The
court finds that the interpreter costs were reasonably incurred in prosecuting
this action. Therefore, the interpreter costs will not be taxed. 
 
H.        plaintiffs’ Request for
Attorney’s Fees for Opposing Motion 
 
The
California Supreme Court in Serrano v. Unruh¿(1982) has held that
Plaintiff’s counsel is entitled to recovery attorney’s fees for opposing fee
motions, such as Defendant’s Motion to Tax Costs. (32 Cal.3d 621, 639 [“We hold
therefore that, absent circumstances rendering the award unjust, fees recoverable
under section 1021.5 ordinarily include compensation for all hours reasonably
spent, including those necessary to establish and defend the fee claim.”].) Therefore, the court agrees that Plaintiffs are
entitled to recover attorney’s fees for opposing this Motion. 
 
Plaintiffs’
counsel states he spent 0.5 hours reviewing Defendant Kia’s Motion and
declaration, 3.0 hours drafting this opposition, and all relevant exhibits, and
drafting the supporting declaration, and 1.0 hour preparing to attend this
hearing remotely. (Devaboos Decl. ¶ 12.) In total, Plaintiffs’ counsel states
he spent 5.0 hours billed at an hourly rate of $425.00 hours opposing this
Motion and incurred $2, 125.00 in fees. 
 
Defendant
Kia opposes the Plaintiffs’ fee motion request on the basis that fees are
excessive and Plaintiffs are not entitled to a fee request. The court disagrees
and grants the Plaintiffs’ fee request in the sum of $1,912.50 for 4.5 hours of
work. 
 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant
Kia’s Motion to Strike is denied. Defendant Kia’s Motion to Tax Costs is
granted in part and $192.02
will be taxed from Item 13. Plaintiffs’ request for opposing this Motion is
granted in the sum of $1,912.50
for 4.5 hours of work.
