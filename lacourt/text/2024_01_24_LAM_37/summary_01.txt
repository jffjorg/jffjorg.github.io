The Judge's tentative ruling denies Defendant Kia's Motion to Strike the Plaintiffs' Memorandum of Costs. The Judge grants Defendant Kia's Motion to Tax Costs in part, taxing $192.02 from Item 13. The Judge also grants Plaintiffs' request for attorney's fees for opposing the Motion to Tax Costs in the sum of $1,912.50.

The Judge's ruling is based on the Song-Beverly Act, the California Rules of Court, and the California Code of Civil Procedure. The Judge also cites relevant case law, including Serrano v. Unruh (1982).
