```

And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants Uber's motion to seal its unredacted motion for determination of good faith settlement and corresponding confidential documents. The ruling states that the court may order that a record be filed under seal only if it finds that there exists an overriding interest that overcomes the right of public access to the record, and that the proposed sealing is narrowly tailored and no less restrictive means exist to achieve the overriding interest. In this case, the Judge finds that the parties have a strong interest in keeping their financial and other private matters out of the public record, and that failure to seal the requested settlement information would result in the disclosure of private, sensitive information.
