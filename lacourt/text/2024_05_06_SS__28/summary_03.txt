Summary:
The Tentative Ruling is a summary of the court's decision on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the defendants. The court overrules the demurrer to the claims for assault, battery, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The court grants the motion to strike the allegations of malice, oppression, fraud, conscious and reckless disregard, despicable conduct, and reckless indifference, and the punitive damage claims from the causes of action for assault, battery, negligent hiring, supervision, training, and retention, and negligence per se. The court denies the motion to strike in all other respects.
