```

And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the defendant's motions to compel the plaintiff to respond to the special interrogatories and requests for production. The plaintiff did not respond to the discovery requests, and the defendant is entitled to compel a response. The plaintiff did not file an opposition to the motions, so the defendant's request for sanctions is denied. The court orders the plaintiff to provide a verified, code-compliant, written response to the special interrogatories and requests for production within 21 days of notice.
