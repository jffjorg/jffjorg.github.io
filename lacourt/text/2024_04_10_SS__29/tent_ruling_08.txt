 Case Number:  23STCV15899    Hearing Date:   April 10, 2024    Dept:  29 Defendant’s Motion to Compel Plaintiff to Respond to Form
Interrogatories (Set One), Special Interrogatories (Set One), and Request for
Production of Documents (Set One)
 
Tentative
The motion is granted.
The request for sanctions is denied.
Background
On July
7, 2023, Hector Arroyo (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against SHZ Development,
Inc. (“Defendant”) and Does 1 through 100, asserting causes of action for
general negligence and premises liability arising from an injury at a
construction site on August 24, 2021, on Melrose Avenue in Los Angeles. 
 
On August
31, 2023, Defendant filed its answer. The next day, Defendant filed a cross-complaint
against Chip-Rocke Construction, Inc, and Roes 1 through 50 for Equitable
Indemnity, Contribution, Express Indemnity, Breach of Contract, and Declaratory
Relief.  On October 16, 2023, Defendant filed
a request for dismissal of the claims against Chip-Construction, Inc., in the
cross-complaint.
 
On October
9, 2023, Defendant served Plaintiff with discovery, including Form
Interrogatories (Set One), Special Interrogatories (Set One), and Requests for
Production (Set One). (Schmid Decl., ¶¶ 6-9 & Exhs. A-D.)  Plaintiff did not respond to the
discovery.  (Id., ¶ 13.)
 
On January 31, 2024, Defendant filed this motion to
compel.  No opposition has been filed. 
 
Legal Standard
A party must respond to interrogatories within 30 days
after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom
interrogatories are directed does not provide a timely response, the propounding
party may move for an order compelling response to the interrogatories. (Id.,
§ 2030.290, subd. (b).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial
responses, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2030.290;
Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants
(2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In
addition, a party who fails to provide a timely response generally waives all
objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290, subd. (a).) 
When a party moves to compel initial responses to
interrogatories, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the motion], unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd.
(c).)
A party must respond to requests for production of
documents within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260,
subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for production of documents are directed
does not provide timely responses, the requesting party may move for an order
compelling response to the demand. (Id., § 2031.300, subd. (b).) There
is no time limit for a motion to compel initial responses, and no meet and
confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare
Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th
390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who
fails to provide a timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).) 
When a party moves
to compel initial responses to requests for production, “the court shall impose
a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against
any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the motion],
unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.300, subd. (c).)
In Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery
Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision (d), defines
“[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to respond to or to
submit to an authorized method of discovery.” 
Where a party or attorney has engaged in misuse of the discovery
process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in the amount of “the
reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result
of that conduct.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2023.020, subd. (a).)
Discussion
Defendant
served Plaintiff with form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and
requests for production on October 9, 2023. 
(Schmid Decl., ¶¶ 6-8 & Exhs. A-D.)  Plaintiff did not serve responses to these
discovery requestes. (Id., ¶ 13.)
 
Defendant
need show nothing more. The motion to compel is granted.
 
Defendant’s
request for sanctions is denied.  
Defendant seeks sanctions under Code of Civil
Procedure sections 2030.290, subdivision (c), and 2031.300, subdivision
(c).  These statutes authorize an award
of sanctions “against any party,
person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes” a motion to compel
initial responses.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.290, subd. (c); § 2031.300, subd. (c).)  Here, Plaintiff did not file any opposition,
and so there is no authority under these statutes to award sanctions against
Plaintiff or Plaintiff’s counsel.
Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030 does not
provide an independent basis to award sanctions; to the contrary, the statute
expressly states that a sanctions award must be “authorized by the chapter
governing any particular discovery method or any other provision of this
title.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030.)  The Court of Appeal, in an opinion by Justice
Moor, recently made this very point in City of Los Angeles v.
PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLC (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 466, 504 (“sections
2023.010 and 2023.030 do not independently authorize the trial court to impose
monetary sanctions for misuse of discovery … without regard to any other
provision of the Discovery Act”).  The
Court is aware that the California Supreme Court has granted review of the City
of Los Angeles case, but the Court notes that the order granting review,
filed on January 25, 2023, states that pending review, the appellate opinion
“may be cited,” including “for its persuasive value.”  The Court finds the reasoning of Justice Moor
to be persuasive. 
Conclusion 
The Court GRANTS Defendant’s motions to compel.
The Court ORDERS Plaintiff to provide verified,
code-compliant, written responses, without objection, to Defendant’s Form Interrogatories
(Set One), Special Interrogatories (Set One), and Requests for Production (Set
One) within 21 days of notice.
The Court DENIES Defendant’s request for monetary sanctions. 
Moving party is ordered to give notice.
