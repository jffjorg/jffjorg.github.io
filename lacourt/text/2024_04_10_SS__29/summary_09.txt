And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling grants the defendant's motion to strike the plaintiff's prayer for punitive damages, along with paragraphs 20 and 27 of the complaint. However, the court denies the motion to strike paragraph 12 of the complaint. The court also grants the plaintiff leave to amend the complaint within 21 days. The ruling is based on the court's review of the plaintiff's complaint, which fails to state facts with sufficient particularity to support a claim for punitive damages.
