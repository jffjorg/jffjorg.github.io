And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies without prejudice a motion filed by Johnny Rundell, of Hershey Law, P.C., to be relieved as counsel in the case of Micael Nystrom vs. Margaret E. Davis. The motion was filed on March 15, 2024, but the notice was not timely because it was served by mail on March 15, 2024, which is less than 16 court days before the hearing. Additionally, the declaration required for electronic service was not included with the motion. The Judge concludes that the motion is denied without prejudice and orders moving counsel to give notice.
