And here is the English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Defendants, State of California, California Highway Patrol, and Alfredo Gutierrez, have filed a motion to bifurcate the trial into two parts, one for liability and one for damages. The motion is denied without prejudice. The Court finds that the trial judge should make the discretionary determination on bifurcation, as it relates to the management of the trial proceedings. The Court rules that the Defendants may submit a motion for bifurcation at the time that motions in limine are filed, and any other party may submit an opposition when oppositions to motions in limine are filed.
