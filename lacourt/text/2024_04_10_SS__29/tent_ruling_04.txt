 Case Number:  20STCV49328    Hearing Date:   April 10, 2024    Dept:  29 Motion to be Relieved as Counsel, filed by Plaintiff’s Counsel
Johnny Rundell of Hershey Law, P.C.
 
Tentative
The motion is denied without prejudice.
Background
On December 28, 2020, Micael Nystrom
(“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Margaret E. Davis (“Defendant”) and
Does 1 through 50 asserting one cause of action for motor vehicle negligence
arising out of an accident on December 28, 2018, near the intersection of
Ventura Boulevard and Sepulveda Boulevard in Sherman Oaks. Defendant filed her
answer on March 14, 2022.
On March 15, 2024, Johnny Rundell of Hershey
Law, P.C. (“Counsel”) filed this motion to be relieved as counsel. No
opposition has been filed. Proof of Service was filed with the Court on March
18, 2024.
Legal
Standard
The court may order that an attorney be changed or
substituted at any time before or after judgment or final determination upon
request by either client or attorney and after notice from one to the other.
(Code of Civ. Proc., § 284(b).) An attorney is permitted to withdraw where
conflicts between the attorney and client make it unreasonable to continue the
representation. (See Cal. Rules of Prof. Conduct 3-700(C)(1).) “The
determination whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel lies
within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi & Levine v.
Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1133.)   
 
An application to be relieved as counsel must be made on
Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion) (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.136(c)), and MC-053 (Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362(e)).   
 
Further, the requisite forms must be served on the client
and all other parties who have appeared in the case. (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1362(d).) The court may delay effective date of the order relieving
counsel until proof of service of a copy of the signed order on the client has
been filed with the court. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).) 
 
Discussion
 
Counsel has
filed the Notice, Declaration and Order to be Relieved as Counsel. On March 18,
2024, Counsel filed proof of service of the documents. 
 
According to the
moving papers and the proof of service, Plaintiff currently lives in
Portugal.  In general, a noticed motion
must be served 16 court days before the hearing; the 16-day period for a motion
is increased by 5 calendar days for service by mail within the State of
California, by 10 calendar days for service by mail outside California and
inside the United States, and by 20 calendar days “if either the place of
mailing or the place of address is outside the United States.” (Code of Civ.
Proc. § 1005, subd. (b).) 
 
Accordingly, for
a hearing on April 10, 2024, service by mail on Plaintiff in Portugal on March
15, 2024, is not timely.
 
While the proof
of service includes Plaintiff’s email, electronic service requires a
declaration stating the electronic service address is the client’s current
address. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362(d).) No such declaration has been included with this motion.
 
Accordingly, the
motion is DENIED without prejudice based on untimely notice.
Conclusion
The motion to be
relieved as counsel is DENIED without prejudice.
Moving counsel
to give notice.
