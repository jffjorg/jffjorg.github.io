And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

"In this tentative ruling, the court denies Plaintiff Robert Joiner's motion for reconsideration, which seeks to set aside the dismissal of the case. The court previously denied the motion in October 2023 and granted Plaintiff additional time to provide a supplemental brief. However, no supplemental brief has been filed, and the court finds that the motion is without merit. The court's decision is based on the parties' lack of diligence in pursuing the motion and the absence of new or different facts that would warrant reconsideration of the dismissal."
