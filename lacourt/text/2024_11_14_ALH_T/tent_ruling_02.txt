BACKGROUND
 
This is a car accident case arising from a July 25, 2019 incident.
(Declaration of Leah J. Kim, ¶2.) Defendant served Form Interrogatories, Set
One, on Plaintiff on May 31, 2024. (Kim Decl. ¶3, Exh. A) Responses were
originally due on July 3, 2024. Plaintiff served unverified responses on August
30, 2024 (Kim Decl., ¶7, Exh. D) On September 3, 2024, counsel met and
conferred regarding the lack of verification and incomplete, non-code compliant
responses to Form Interrogatories Nos. 2.6, 4.1, 20.3-20.5, and 20.9-20.11. (Kim
Decl., ¶8.) Defense counsel has since reached out several times to remind
Plaintiff’s counsel to provide verified responses and address the incomplete,
non-code compliant responses. (Kim Decl., ¶¶10-11) (Motion to Compel Further,
p. 63.)
 
 
MOVING PARTY POSITION
 
            Defendant argues Plaintiff’s failure
to timely provide amended verified responses to Defendant’s Form
Interrogatories Nos. 2.6, 4.1, 20.3-20.5; 20.9-20.11 forced Defendant to file
the instant motion to compel Plaintiff’s verified amended responses. Defendant
requests the Court grant an order compelling Plaintiff to provide further,
verified responses to the at-issue interrogatories within twenty days. 
 
Defendant also requests the Court award monetary sanctions in the amount
of $1,3115.65 against Plaintiff for violating the Discovery Act and misusing
the discovery process.  
  
OPPOSITION
No
opposition has been filed to this motion.
ANALYSIS
I.                  
Motion to
Compel Further Responses
Where a party fails to serve timely
responses to discovery requests, the court may make an order compelling
responses. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290; 2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare
Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th
390, 403.) The propounding party may file motions to compel further
responses to requests for production if it believes the responses received are
(1) evasive, (2) incomplete, or (3) if the objections raised are meritless or
overly general. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.310(a).) In response to a motion to
compel further responses, the respondent bears the burden of justifying any
objections. (Fairmont Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (2000) 22 Cal.4th 245,
255.) 
The party to whom interrogatories
have been propounded shall respond in writing under oath separately to each
interrogatory by any of the following (1) an answer containing the information
sought to be discovered (2) an exercise of the party’s option to produce
writings (3) an objection to the particular interrogatory. (Cal. Code of Civ
Proc. § 2031.210 (a).) “Each answer in a response to interrogatories shall be
as complete and straightforward as the information reasonably available to the
responding party permits.” (Emphasis added.) (Code of Civil Procedure
§2030.220(a).) “If the responding party does not have personal knowledge
sufficient to respond fully to an interrogatory, that party shall so state, but
shall make a reasonable and good faith effort to obtain the information by
inquiry to other natural persons or organizations, except where the information
is equally available to the propounding party.” Code of Civil Procedure §
2030.220(c).
There is good cause to grant Defendant’s
motion to compel further responses.  . As
an initial matter, Defendant attempted in good faith to meet and confer with Plaintiff
regarding Plaintiff’s failure to provide adequate responses. Additionally,
Plaintiff’s responses to each of Defendant’s identified Form Interrogatories
are incomplete. For instance, Plaintiff’s response to Form Interrogatory 2.6
provides: “(a) Self-employment, Hairstyle, Part Time; (b) Uber Driver” — and
fails to address several subparts of the interrogatory, including the name, address,
and telephone number. (Plaintiff Lilia Montalvo Form Interrogatories, Set One,
p. 2.) Plaintiff’s response to Form Interrogatory 4.1 similarly omits most
information, and merely acknowledges Plaintiff had health insurance but failing
to provide information regarding the health insurance policy. (Id. at 3.)
Plaintiff’s responses to Form Interrogatories 20.3, 20.4,
20.5, and 20.9-20.11 are identical, stating “Expert discovery has not yet
commenced, and Responding Party reserves the right to amend and/or supplement
this response as discovery and investigation are ongoing.” (Id. at 10-11.)  In each instance, Plaintiff’s responses — each
referring to expert discovery — are not applicable to the nature of the
information requested, and are therefore incomplete. The Court thus finds Plaintiff
has failed to provide adequate responses to Defendant's Form Interrogatories,
Set One. It is thus appropriate to grant Defendant’s motion to compel further
responses to Defendant’s Form Interrogatories.
II.               
Sanctions
The Court shall impose monetary
sanctions against any party or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a
motion to compel further responses to interrogatories. (Code Civ. Proc. §
2030.300(d).) 
Pursuant to Code Civ. Proc. §
2023.030: 
The
court may impose a monetary sanction ordering that one engaging in the misuse
of the discovery process, or any attorney advising that conduct, or both pay
the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a
result of that conduct. The court may also impose this sanction on one
unsuccessfully asserting that another has engaged in the misuse of the
discovery process, or on any attorney who advised that assertion, or on both.
If a monetary sanction is authorized by any provision of this title, the court
shall impose that sanction unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust.
Here, Defendant requests sanctions in the amount of $1,3115.65 against
Plaintiff based on a total of 5.0 hours of work at a $250.00 per hour rate, in
addition to a $61.65 filing fee. Defendant reports spending 3.0 hours
preparing the instant motion, and an anticipated 1.0 hour to review any
opposition and draft a reply in addition to 1.0 hour to attend the hearing. (Motion
to Compel Further, p. 13.) The Court finds Defendant is entitled to filing fees
($61.65). Additionally, the Court finds Defendant’s number of hours worked preparing
the instant motion is reasonable, as well as Defendant’s anticipated 1.0 hour
to attend the hearing. Because no opposition has been filed, the Court reduces
Defendant’s awarded number of hours to 4.0. Defendant’s $250.00 hourly rate is
reasonable. As a result, Defendant is entitled to $1,061.65 in sanctions.
RULING
Defendant’s motion to compel
further is GRANTED. Defendant’s
motion for sanctions is GRANTED in the amount of $1,061.65.
