And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the defendant's motion to compel further responses to the plaintiff's Form Interrogatories. The plaintiff failed to provide adequate responses to the defendant's discovery requests, including incomplete and non-code compliant responses. The judge finds that the plaintiff has failed to meet its obligations under the discovery process and orders the plaintiff to provide further, verified responses to the defendant's Form Interrogatories.

The judge also awards the defendant $1,061.65 in sanctions, which is reduced from the defendant's requested amount of $1,3115.65. The judge finds that the defendant's hours spent preparing the motion and anticipated time spent attending the hearing are reasonable, and that the defendant's hourly rate is reasonable.
