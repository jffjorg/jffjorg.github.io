And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion for determination of good faith settlement filed by Defendant Michelle Carriger. The case involves a car accident between Plaintiff Douglas Da Silva McGlew and Defendant Carriger, where Plaintiff claims to have suffered severe pain and injuries. Plaintiff filed lawsuits for the accident and also for two separate other accidents involving him. Defendant Carriger reached a settlement with Plaintiff for $30,000.00 to avoid further litigation costs and uncertainty.

The Judge found that the settlement is in good faith, considering the factors outlined in Code of Civil Procedure Section 877.6, including a rough approximation of Plaintiff's total recovery and Defendant's proportionate liability, the amount paid in settlement, and the financial conditions and insurance policy limits of the settling defendants. The Judge also considered Plaintiff's deposition testimony, which suggests that the settlement amount is within the ballpark of liability, representing a minority proportion of Plaintiff's economic damages claim.

The Judge rejected the arguments made by Defendants Fatameh Shamie and Mohammed Shamie, who argued that the settlement is not in good faith, as they did not provide sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the settlement is inconsistent with the equitable objectives of the statute. The Judge granted the motion and found that the settlement agreement between Defendant Carriger and Plaintiff represents a good faith settlement.
