Here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to bifurcate the trial of plaintiff Rocco Distefano's punitive damages. The motion was filed by defendant Equinox Holdings, Inc. on January 31, 2024, and the plaintiff opposed it on February 20, 2024. The Judge has granted the motion, finding that bifurcation will promote judicial economy by avoiding the introduction and consideration of unnecessary evidence, and will prevent the determination of liability from being tainted by the consideration of irrelevant, confusing, misleading, and prejudicial evidence related to the issue of damages. The bifurcation will allow the trial to be divided into two phases: the first phase will focus on the liability and compensatory damages, and the second phase will focus on the punitive damages. The Judge has also ordered that the plaintiff will be able to argue and present evidence that the defendants acted with malice, fraud or oppression in the first phase, but will not be able to argue or present evidence as to the amount of such damages until the second phase.
