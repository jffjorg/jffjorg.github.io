Significant Statements:

- The court should consider both the conduct being sanctioned and its effect on the party seeking discovery.
- Discovery sanctions should be appropriate to the dereliction, and should not exceed that which is required to protect the interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery.
- Terminating sanctions are drastic sanctions that should be imposed sparingly and only when it is clear that the party to be sanctioned has left no viable alternatives.
- Issue sanctions are justifiably treated as such where the effect of the order is to preclude proof of essential elements of each cause of action.
- Monetary sanctions are warranted, but in a reduced amount, due to the unreasonable delay in serving responses.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's motion for terminating sanctions against Everbrands-CA, alternative issue sanctions against Everbrands in the form of admission of facts stated, and request for monetary sanctions in the amount of $4,661.52.

The court denies the request for terminating sanctions, finding that terminating sanctions are not merited in this case. The court also denies the request for issue sanctions, finding that the issue sanctions are moot because Everbrands-CA served supplemental responses to the Requests for Admission, Set One, Nos. 23-24.

The court grants the request for monetary sanctions in the amount of $2,840, finding that Everbrands-CA unreasonably delayed in serving responses to the Requests for Admission, Set One, Nos. 23-24. The court also encourages the parties to meet and confer regarding further discovery.

The judge's ruling is based on the court's discretion in selecting discovery sanctions, as well as the parties' conduct and the effect of that conduct on the parties. The court findings are supported by relevant statutes and case law, including the Code of Civil Procedure and California Labor Code.
