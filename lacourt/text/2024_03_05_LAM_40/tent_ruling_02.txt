Motion for Sanctions
Legal
Standard
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2023.030 permits California courts to impose issue
or evidence sanctions for discovery misuses, which are defined by section
2023.010 of the Code of Civil Procedure. (See Peat, Marwick, Mitchell &
Co. v. Superior Court (1988) 200 Cal.App.3d 272, 288 [The court’s inherent
power to curb abuses and promote fair process extends to the preclusion of
evidence].)
“‘The
trial court has broad discretion in selecting discovery sanctions, subject to
reversal only for abuse. [Citations.] The trial court should consider both the
conduct being sanctioned and its effect on the party seeking discovery and, in
choosing a sanction, should “‘attempt[] to tailor the sanction to the harm
caused by the withheld discovery.’” [Citation.] The trial court cannot impose
sanctions for misuse of the discovery process as a punishment. [Citation.] [¶]
The discovery statutes evince an incremental approach to discovery sanctions,
starting with monetary sanctions and ending with the ultimate sanction of
termination. “Discovery sanctions ‘should be appropriate to the dereliction,
and should not exceed that which is required to protect the interests of the
party entitled to but denied discovery.’” [Citation.] If a lesser sanction
fails to curb misuse, a greater sanction is warranted: continuing misuses of
the discovery process warrant incrementally harsher sanctions until the
sanction is reached that will curb the abuse.’” (Padron v. Watchtower Bible
& Tract Society of New York, Inc. (2017) 16 Cal.App.5th 1246,
1259-1260, quoting Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th
967, 992; accord Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771, 793
[Discovery sanctions “should be appropriate to the dereliction, and should not
exceed that which is required to protect the interests of the party entitled to
but denied discovery”]; Karlsson v. Ford Motor Co. (2006) 140
Cal.App.4th 1202, 1217 [“Discovery sanctions must be tailored in order to
remedy the offending party’s discovery abuse, should not give the aggrieved
party more than what it is entitled to, and should not be used to punish the
offending party”].) 
I. Terminating Sanctions
Local
Standard
Terminating
sanctions are drastic sanctions that should be imposed sparingly and only when
it is clear that the party to be sanctioned has left no viable alternatives.
(See Dept. of Forestry & Fire. Prot. v. Howell (2017) 18 Cal.App.5th
154, 191, disapproved on other grounds in Presbyterian Camp & Conf.
Ctrs, Inc. v. Superior Court (2021) 12 Cal.5th 493; Lopez v. Watchtower
Bible & Tract Soc’y (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 566, 604.)
The
court should consider the totality of the circumstances before ordering
terminating sanctions, including (1) whether the conduct of the party was
willful, (2) the detriment to the party propounding discovery, and (3) the
number of formal and informal attempt to obtain the discovery. (Los
Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 377, 390.) The Court is
not required to find that a party acted in bad faith before imposing
terminating sanctions. (See Creed-21 v. City of Wildomar (2017) 18
Cal.App.5th 690, 703.)
Request
for Terminating Sanctions: DENIED.
The
Court finds that terminating sanctions are not merited here.
First,
the incremental approach here does not warrant terminating sanctions because
other alternatives exist—namely, the requested issue sanctions.
Moreover,
insofar as the motion is based on failure to provide responses to Requests for
Admission, Set One, Nos. 23-24—the RFAs to which Everbrands CA provided
defective responses on September 11, 2023, and to which the Court ordered
further responses on November 13, 2023—supplemental responses were served to
those admission requests by Everbrands CA on January 3, 2024 and February 20,
2024. (Opp’n, Birnbaum Decl., Exs. A, C.)
Insofar
as terminating sanctions are premised on a holistic pattern of discovery
abuses, the Court notes that this motion is framed around delayed supplemental
responses to RFAs, Set One, Nos. 23-24. While the motion briefly references
other discovery abuses, they are not sufficiently detailed in the moving papers
or summarized in a separate statement style document. (Mot., pp. 5-6.) It
behooves the movant, as the master of the moving papers, to properly frame the
legal arguments on which the movant premises the relief sought from the Court.
Terminating
sanctions are thus DENIED.
II. Issue Sanctions
Local
Standard
“A
discovery order, though not in the form of a default or dismissal, is justifiably
treated as such where the effect of the order is to preclude proof of essential
elements of each cause of action.” (Puritan Ins. Co. v. Superior Court
(1985) 171 Cal.App.3d 877, 884, citing Karz v. Karl (1982) 137
Cal.App.3d 637, 648.) “The sanction of dismissal or the rendition of a default
judgment against the disobedient party is ordinarily a drastic measure which
should be employed with caution. [Citation.] The sanction of dismissal, where
properly employed, is justified on the theory the party’s refusal to reveal
material evidence tacitly admits his claim or defense is without merit.” (Puritan
Ins. Co., supra, at p. 885.) Except for in cases of extreme
misconduct and when other viable options are unavailable, a trial court abuses
its discretion when a sanctions order deprives a party “of any right to defend
the action upon its merits” and was “designed not to accomplish the purposes of
discovery but designed to punish” the party for not fully complying with its
discovery obligations. (Caryl Richards, Inc. v. Superior Court (1961)
188 Cal.App.2d 300, 305; accord Newland v. Superior Court (1995) 40
Cal.App.4th 608, 613-616 [party’s failure to timely pay monetary sanctions did
not warrant terminating sanctions].)
Misuses
of the discovery process include, but are not limited to, the following:
(a)
Persisting, over objection and without substantial justification, in an attempt
to obtain information or materials that are outside the scope of permissible
discovery.
(b)
Using a discovery method in a manner that does not comply with its specified
procedures.
(c)
Employing a discovery method in a manner or to an extent that causes
unwarranted annoyance, embarrassment, or oppression, or undue burden and
expense.
(d)
Failing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.
(e)
Making, without substantial justification, an unmeritorious objection to
discovery.
(f)
Making an evasive response to discovery.
(g)
Disobeying a court order to provide discovery.
(h)
Making or opposing, unsuccessfully and without substantial justification, a
motion to compel or to limit discovery.
(i)
Failing to confer in person, by telephone, or by letter with an opposing party
or attorney in a reasonable and good faith attempt to resolve informally any
dispute concerning discovery, if the section governing a particular discovery
motion requires the filing of a declaration stating facts showing that an
attempt at informal resolution has been made.
(Code
Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subds. (a)-(i); see, e.g., Vallbona v. Springer
(1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 1525, 1545 [a court imposed evidence sanctions where defendants
misused discovery process by not responding to authorized method of discovery];
In re Marriage of Eustice (2015) 242 Cal.App.4th 1291, 1308-1309 [respondent
was sanctioned for willfully violating order to produce accounting and
financial documents].)

Request for Issue Sanctions:
DENIED.
Here, the Court determines that
issue sanctions are MOOT because the issue sanctions seek issue preclusion as
to RFAs, Set One, Nos. 23-24, for which Everbrands CA served supplemental
responses on January 3, 2024, and on February 20, 2024. (Opp’n, Birnbaum Decl.,
Exs. A, C.) 
While the Court understands
Plaintiff’s argument that the responses were not filed until after the motion
was filed, trial is not scheduled until September and the Court does not find
that it would be proportionate to the conduct engaged in to deem the RFAs admitted,
since the filing, albeit late, is with sufficient time to give Plaintiff a
chance to complete discovery. (Cf. Peat, Marwick, Mitchell & Co. v.
Superior Court (1988) 200 Cal.App.3d 272, [issue sanctions upheld where a defendant
accounting firm merged with the other side’s expert accounting firm during the
litigation such that it was impossible to otherwise remedy the conflict of
interest that the defendant had created].) Accordingly, the requested Issue
Sanctions are denied.
III. Monetary
Sanctions
Local Standard
See Issue Sanctions standard.
Request for Monetary Sanctions:
GRANTED, IN PART.
Here, the Court determines that
monetary sanctions are warranted, but in a reduced amount.
Here, Everbrands CA served its
verified amended responses on January 3, 2024, and on January 9, 2024.  Defendant then determined that they needed to
amend their responses, and served second amended responses on February 20, 2024
(Opp’n, Birnbaum Decl., Exs. A, C). While Everbrands CA correctly notes that
the Court’s November 13th order did not set a timeframe by which responses to
RFAs, Set One, Nos. 23-24 would be served (Opp’n, p. 5), it is not reasonable
to expect an open-ended timeframe for those responses, let alone nearly two
months for the amended responses served in January.
For these reasons, even if
Everbrands CA and counsel have been sanctioned before, the Court finds monetary
sanctions are warranted pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 2023.010,
subdivisions (d) and (g), and 2023.030, subdivision (a) based on the unreasonable
delay.
The Court also determines that the
proper award of sanctions is $2,840, comprised of a reasonable fee rate of $695
per hour, 1.5 hours reasonably expended drafting the motion, 1.5 hours
reasonably expended reviewing the opposition and drafting the reply, and one
hour reasonably expended attending this hearing, plus costs of $60 for filing
of the motion.
However, the Court strongly
encourages the parties to meet and confer regarding further discovery. Motions
such as the instant motion are simply draining the activities of counsel and
the Court away from the substantive resolution of this case.
Conclusion
Plaintiff Karen Flores’s Motion for
Terminating Sanctions Against Everbrands-CA, Alternatively Issue Sanctions
Against Everbrands in the Form of Admission of the Facts Stated, and Request
for Monetary Sanctions in the Amount of $4,661.52 is:
(1) DENIED as to terminating
sanctions;
(2) DENIED as to issue sanctions;
and
(3) GRANTED, in part, as to
monetary sanctions, in the amount of $2,840.
Defendant Everbrands Inc.
(Everbrands CA) and counsel of record, Allyson Thompson, are ORDERED to remit $2,840
to Plaintiff Karen Flores, jointly and severally, within 30 days of this order.
