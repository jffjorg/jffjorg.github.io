The motion was filed on June 20, 2024, and was set for hearing on August 6, 2024. Plaintiff did not file an opposition. The motion was based on Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.450, which allows a party to move for an order compelling a deponent's attendance and testimony if they fail to appear for examination. However, the Judge found that Defendant did not satisfy the requirements of the statute by failing to show that they met and conferred or contacted Plaintiff's counsel to inquire about Plaintiff's nonappearance. As a result, the Judge denied the motion.
