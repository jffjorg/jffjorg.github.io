LEGAL STANDARD 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2025.450 provides in part: 
“(a) If, after service of a deposition notice, a party
to the action or an officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a party,
or a person designated by an organization that is a party under Section
2025.230, without having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails
to appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for inspection
any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in
the deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order
compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production for
inspection of any document, electronically stored information, or tangible
thing described in the deposition notice. 
“(b) A motion under subdivision (a) shall comply with
both of the following: 
“(1) The motion shall set forth specific facts showing
good cause justifying the production for inspection of any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice. 
“(2) The motion shall be accompanied by a meet and
confer declaration under Section 2016.040, or, when the deponent fails to
attend the deposition and produce the documents, electronically stored
information, or things described in the deposition notice, by a declaration
stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire about the
nonappearance.

 “(g)(1) If a motion under subdivision (a) is granted,
the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010) in favor of the party who noticed the deposition and against
the deponent or the party with whom the deponent is affiliated, unless the
court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust. . . .” 
(Code
Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subds. (a), (b), (g)(1).) 
DISCUSSION 
On February
22, 2024, Defendant noticed Plaintiff’s deposition for March 21, 2024.  Plaintiff did not object to the deposition
notice and did not appear for the deposition. 
A motion
to compel a party’s deposition under Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.450
must be “accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040,
or, when the deponent fails to attend the deposition and produce the documents,
electronically stored information, or things described in the deposition
notice, by a declaration stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent
to inquire about the nonappearance.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (b)(2).) 
Defendant has not satisfied this requirement because the supporting
declaration does not show that Defendant’s counsel met and conferred or
contacted Plaintiff’s counsel to inquire about Plaintiff’s nonappearance. 
The
Court denies the motion.CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES Defendant Adam Brett
Goldberg’s motion to compel Plaintiff
Matt Bilinsk’s attendance at a deposition and
for sanctions. 
Moving
party is to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
party is to file proof of service of this ruling with the Court within five
days.
