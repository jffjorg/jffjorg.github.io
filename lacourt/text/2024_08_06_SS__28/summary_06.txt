(Pointe San Diego Residential Community, L.P. v. Procopio, Cory, Hargreaves & Savitch, LLP)
  - "In reviewing the motion, [the Court] deem[s] true all properly pleaded material facts, but not contentions, deductions, or conclusions of fact or law, and [the court] may also consider judicially noticed matters." (Bear Creek Master Assn. v. Southern California Investors, Inc.)
  - "Judicial notice may conclusively defeat the pleading [for example] where it establishes res judicata or collateral estoppel. The pleader's own concession may have this same conclusive effect." (Columbia Casualty Co. v. Northwestern Nat. Ins. Co.)
```

And here is the English summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants Uber's motion for judgment on the pleadings with 30 days' leave to amend. The court has reviewed the pleadings and deemed true all properly pleaded material facts, but not contentions, deductions, or conclusions of fact or law. The court has also considered judicially noticed matters, including the June 7, 2024 order granting Uber's motion to deem admitted matters specified in requests for admission. The deemed admissions negate the allegations in Plaintiff's complaint concerning negligence, causation, and damages. Since the deemed admissions cannot reasonably be controverted, the court grants Uber's motion for judgment on the pleadings.
