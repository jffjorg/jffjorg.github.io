 Case Number:  20STCV25822    Hearing Date:   August 6, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
considered the moving papers, the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On July
8, 2020, Plaintiff Financial Indemnity Company (“Plaintiff”) filed this action
against Defendants SOS Motors Inc. (“Defendant”) and
Does 1-25 for unjust enrichment and declaratory relief.  The complaint demanded $7,343.80 and requested “a judicial determination
pursuant to California Vehicle Code Section 22524.5 as to the amount
constituting a reasonable fee to be paid to Defendant for storage and tear down
fees of a 2015 Mercedes Benz, California License No. 8HBZ488 (‘the subject
vehicle’), which was insured by Plaintiff at all relevant times herein.” 
On
December 23, 2021, Plaintiff filed a first amended complaint changing the
amount demanded to $26,225.80. 
On
February 8, 2022, Plaintiff filed a “Stipulation for Settlement and Order for
Dismissal Pursuant to C.C.P. § 664.6.” 
On
April 28, 2022, the Court dismissed the case without prejudice “per settlement.” 
On
June 15, 2023, Plaintiff filed a motion to vacate the dismissal and enter judgment
under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6. 
The motion was set for hearing on June 12, 2024.  The Court continued the hearing to August 6,
2024.  Defendant has not filed an opposition.
No
trial date is currently set. 
PARTY’S REQUESTS 
Plaintiff
asks the Court to vacate the judgment of dismissal and enter judgment against Defendant. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 664.6 provides in part: 
“(a) If parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a
writing signed by the parties outside of the presence of the court or orally
before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon
motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement. If
requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to
enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of the
settlement. 
“(b) For purposes of this section, a writing is signed
by a party if it is signed by any of the following: 
“(1) The party. 
“(2) An attorney who represents the party. 
“(3) If the party is an insurer, an agent who is
authorized in writing by the insurer to sign on the insurer’s behalf.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6,
subds. (a), (b).) 
DISCUSSION 
Plaintiff
and Defendant stipulated that the Court would dismiss the action without
prejudice.  In return, Defendant agreed to
make specified monthly payments to Plaintiff until Defendant paid the amount it
owed Plaintiff. 
Defendant
made monthly payments totaling $8,000.00 but then defaulted on its payment
obligation.  Plaintiff’s counsel sent a default
payment email to Defendant on December 5, 2022 advising Defendant that it was
in default.  Defendant has failed to bring its payments current.
Because
Defendant did not cure the default, Plaintiff asks the Court to enter judgment in Plaintiff’s favor for $6,060.00,
representing the original amount owed of $14,00.00,
less $8,000.00 in payments by Defendant, plus $60.00 in costs.  The Court grants the motion. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court GRANTS Plaintiff Financial Indemnity Company’s
motion to set aside the dismissal and enter judgment.  The Court vacates the April 28, 2022 dismissal
and awards Plaintiff Financial Indemnity
Company $6,060.00 against Defendant SOS Motors Inc.
