Here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The Court has considered the moving papers and rules as follows. Plaintiff Taylor Briscoe filed an action against Defendant Heide Orellana for negligence. The case has a complex history, with multiple dismissals and reinstatements. Intervenor Liberty Mutual Fire Insurance Company filed an answer in intervention and a cross-complaint against Cross-Defendants Roes 1-50. Intervenor then filed motions to compel Plaintiff's responses to requests for production of documents, special interrogatories, and form interrogatories, as well as motions for sanctions. The motions were set for hearing on August 6, 2024, but Plaintiff did not file oppositions. The Court denies the motions without prejudice due to Intervenor's failure to provide proper proofs of service. Intervenor is ordered to give notice of this ruling and file proof of service within five days.
