The Court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Financial Indemnity Company against SOS Motors Inc. The case was initially filed on July 8, 2020, and was dismissed without prejudice on April 28, 2022, as part of a settlement agreement. However, the parties failed to comply with the terms of the settlement, and the Court is now considering Plaintiff's motion to vacate the dismissal and enter judgment.

The Court found that Defendant SOS Motors Inc failed to make payments to Plaintiff Financial Indemnity Company, despite agreeing to do so as part of the settlement. As a result, Plaintiff is seeking judgment in the amount of $6,060.00, representing the original amount owed minus the payments made by Defendant.

The Court grants Plaintiff's motion and vacates the previous dismissal, awarding Plaintiff $6,060.00 against Defendant SOS Motors Inc.
