The judge has granted the motion for summary judgment filed by HHGC Management, LLC (HHGC) in the case of Ty Nguyen, et al. v. Akiyama International Company Limited, et al. The case involves a dispute over injuries sustained by Ty Nguyen, who was allegedly injured when his arm became caught in the rollers of an Akiyama International printing press while he was working for Nationwide Plastic Products, Inc.

The judge found that HHGC, the owner of the premises where the incident occurred, did not owe a duty of care to Nguyen and that there was no triable issue of material fact as to the element of breach of a duty of care. The judge noted that HHGC submitted competent evidence to demonstrate that the printing press was not a fixture and that there was no evidence to establish that HHGC breached a duty to inspect the premises to discover the allegedly defective printing press.

Additionally, the judge found that there was no evidence to establish that HHGC's agent, Daniel Tai, was a managing agent of HHGC, and therefore, there was no constructive knowledge of the defective condition. The judge also noted that HHGC's principal, Jia Ge, did not consent for Daniel Tai to act on her behalf, and there was no evidence to establish that HHGC had any knowledge of a defective condition on the property.

As a result, the judge granted HHGC's motion for summary judgment, dismissing the case against HHGC.

## Summary of Tentative Ruling in Case: 19STCV26578

**Case Number:** 19STCV26578
**Plaintiffs:** Ty Nguyen, et al. 
**Defendant:** HHGC Management, LLC
**Hearing Date:** October 4, 2023

**Summary:**

The Judge has granted HHGC Management, LLC's motion for summary judgment. The case revolves around an injury Ty Nguyen sustained while operating a printing press owned by Akiyama International, located on property owned by HHGC. Plaintiffs alleged negligence, premises liability, and other claims against HHGC. 

**Key Points:**

* **No Fixture:** The Court held that the printing press was not a fixture attached to the property, thus HHGC did not have a duty to inspect it for defects. 
* **No Imputed Knowledge:** Plaintiffs failed to provide evidence that Daniel Tai, the owner of the tenant company and Ty Nguyen's employer, was acting as an agent for HHGC. Therefore, HHGC could not be held liable for any knowledge Tai might have had about the printing press defect.
* **No Evidence of Prior Notice:** Plaintiffs did not provide evidence that HHGC had constructive notice of a prior defect similar to the one that caused Ty Nguyen's injury.
* **Lack of Evidence:** Plaintiffs failed to present any competent evidence to demonstrate that HHGC breached a duty of care to inspect the premises for dangerous conditions.

**Intentions:** The Judge's ruling intends to dismiss all claims against HHGC based on the lack of evidence supporting their liability.

**Laws and Statutes:** The ruling cites California Code of Civil Procedure section 437c and relevant case law regarding summary judgment, negligence, premises liability, and agency.

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted HHGC Management, LLC's motion for summary judgment in the case of Ty Nguyen and Trang Nguyen vs. Akiyama International Company Limited, et al. The plaintiffs alleged that HHGC breached a duty of care to them due to a defective printing press on the property, which caused Ty Nguyen's arm to become caught and amputated.

The judge found that there is no triable issue of material fact as to whether HHGC breached a duty of care to the plaintiffs. The evidence presented by the plaintiffs failed to establish that HHGC had actual or constructive knowledge of the defective condition or that HHGC failed to inspect the property to discover the hazard.

The judge also found that the evidence presented by the plaintiffs failed to establish that Daniel Tai, an employee of Nationwide Plastic Products, Inc., was a managing agent of HHGC, which would have provided constructive notice of the defective condition. The judge concluded that HHGC did not breach a duty of care to the plaintiffs and that there is no triable issue of material fact to support the plaintiffs' claims.

As a result, the judge granted HHGC's motion for summary judgment, dismissing the plaintiffs' claims against HHGC.
