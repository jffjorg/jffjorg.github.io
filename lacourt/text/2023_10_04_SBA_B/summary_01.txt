And here is the English text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the motion for summary judgment filed by HHGC Management, LLC (HHGC) in the case of Ty Nguyen, et al. v. Akiyama International Company Limited, et al. The case involves a dispute over injuries sustained by Ty Nguyen, who was allegedly injured when his arm became caught in the rollers of an Akiyama International printing press while he was working for Nationwide Plastic Products, Inc.

The judge found that HHGC, the owner of the premises where the incident occurred, did not owe a duty of care to Nguyen and that there was no triable issue of material fact as to the element of breach of a duty of care. The judge noted that HHGC submitted competent evidence to demonstrate that the printing press was not a fixture and that there was no evidence to establish that HHGC breached a duty to inspect the premises to discover the allegedly defective printing press.

Additionally, the judge found that there was no evidence to establish that HHGC's agent, Daniel Tai, was a managing agent of HHGC, and therefore, there was no constructive knowledge of the defective condition. The judge also noted that HHGC's principal, Jia Ge, did not consent for Daniel Tai to act on her behalf, and there was no evidence to establish that HHGC had any knowledge of a defective condition on the property.

As a result, the judge granted HHGC's motion for summary judgment, dismissing the case against HHGC.
