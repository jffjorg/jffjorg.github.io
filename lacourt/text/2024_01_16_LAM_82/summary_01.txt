Significant Statements:
  - "The grounds for the new trial motion may be either issues of fact such as insufficiency of the evidence or issues of law such as... that the decision is 'against the law,' 'error in law, occurring at the trial,' and others." (Carney v. Simmonds, 49 Cal.2d 84)
  - "It is a well-established principle of statutory law that, where a statute adopts by specific reference the provisions of another statute, regulation, or ordinance, such provisions are incorporated in the form the which they exist at the time of the reference and not as subsequently modified..." (Palermo v. Stockton Theaters, Inc., 32 Cal.2d 53)
  - "The payment under protest requirement provides fiscal protection to the collecting entity, as payment received under protest puts the entity on notice that a refund may eventually be required." (Padilla v. City of San Jose, 78 Cal.App.5th 1073)
  - "Before pursuing judicial relief, respondent was required to pay the taxes and file a claim for refund... pursuant to [R&T] section 5141. Instead, she bypassed the administrative procedure to use a declaratory relief action as a springboard to allege intentional torts of defamation and abuse of process." (Rickley v. County of Los Angeles, 114 Cal.App.4th 1002)
  - "To the extent the complaint seeks a judicial determination of the legal validity of the in-lieu fee, it does not involve an issue subject to determination through the administrative refund remedy available to plaintiffs." (Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Ass'n v. City of Roseville, 97 Cal.App.4th 637)
