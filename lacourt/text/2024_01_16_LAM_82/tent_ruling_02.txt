[TENTATIVE] RULING ON VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT
  OF MANDATE
 
Dept. 82 (Hon. Curtis A. Kin)
 
 

 



 


 


 


 

 


Petitioner
Salvador Velasquez petitions for a writ of mandate directing respondents
California Public Employees’ Retirement System and Board of Administration of
the California Public Employees’ Retirement System to void the decision finding
that petitioner’s post-retirement work from January 1, 2003 to June 2014
violated the Public Employees’ Retirement Law.
 
I.       Factual Background
 
A.          
Public
Employees’ Retirement Law
 
Respondent
California Public Employees’ Retirement System (“CalPERS”) “is a unit of the
Government Operations Agency responsible for administering the retirement
systems for the State of California and ‘contracting agencies’—local public
agencies that have ‘elected to have all or part of [their] employees become
members of this system and that ha[ve] contracted with [CalPERS] for that
purpose.’” (Marzec v. California Public Employees Retirement System
(2015) 236 Cal.App.4th 889, 896, citing Gov. Code §§ 20001, 20002, 20004,
20022, 20028.)[1]

 
Pursuant
to the Public Employees’ Retirement Law (“PERL”), respondent Board
of Administration of the California Public Employees’ Retirement System
(“Board”) manages
and controls pensions for public employees. (Gov. Code § 20120-20122.) “The
board shall determine who are employees and is the sole judge of the conditions
under which persons may be admitted to and continue to receive benefits under
this system.” (§ 20125.) Subject to the PERL, “the board shall determine and
may modify benefits for service and disability.” (§ 20123.) 
 
The
Board has “plenary authority and fiduciary responsibility for investment of
moneys and administration” of CalPERS. (Cal. Const., art. XVI, § 17.) Such
authority and responsibility encompass the protection of public pension monies
from misappropriation. (City of Oakland v. Oakland Police & Fire
Retirement System (2018) 29 Cal.App.5th 688, 711.) 
 
B.          
Working
After Retirement
 
“A
person who has been retired under this system…may not be employed in any
capacity thereafter by the state…or a contracting agency…unless the employment,
without reinstatement, is authorized by this article.” (§ 21220.) Retirees who work
in violation of section 21220 “may be reinstated to membership in the category
in which, and on the date on which, the unlawful employment occurred.” (§ 21202.)
 “When any person is reinstated from
retirement…his or her retirement allowance shall be canceled immediately….” (§
21200.) “A person employed in violation of Section 21220 may be reinstated to
membership in the category in which, and on the date on which, the unlawful
employment occurred.” (§ 21202.)
 
“Any
retired member employed in violation of this article…shall…[¶] (1) Reimburse
this system for any retirement allowance received during the period or periods
of employment that are in violation of law. [¶] (2) Only if reinstated pursuant
to Section 21202, pay to this system an amount of money equal to the employee
contributions that would otherwise have been paid during the period or periods
of unlawful employment, plus interest thereon. [¶] (3) Contribute toward
reimbursement of this system for administrative expenses incurred in responding
to this situation, to the extent the member is determined by the executive
officer to be at fault.” (§ 21220.)
 
            Retirees may serve without being
reinstated from retirement “upon appointment by the appointing power of a state
agency or public agency employer” if they “perform[] work of limited duration.”
(§ 21224(a).) “The compensation for the appointment shall not exceed the
maximum monthly base salary paid to other employees performing comparable
duties as listed on a publicly available pay schedule divided by 173.333 to
equal an hourly rate.” (Ibid.) Retirees “shall not receive any benefit,
incentive, compensation in lieu of benefits, or other form of compensation in
addition to the hourly pay rate.” (Ibid.) 
 
            Retirees may also serve without
being reinstated from retirement “[u]pon interim appointment by the governing
body of a contracting agency to a vacant position during recruitment for a
permanent appointment….” (§ 21221(h).) “A retired person shall only be
appointed once to this vacant position.” (Ibid.) “The compensation for
the interim appointment shall not exceed the maximum monthly base salary paid
to other employees performing comparable duties as listed on a publicly
available pay schedule for the vacant position divided by 173.333 to equal an
hourly rate.” (Ibid.) Retirees appointed to a vacant position “shall not
receive any benefits, incentives, compensation in lieu of benefits, or any
other forms of compensation in addition to the hourly rate.” (Ibid.) 
 
C.          
Petitioner’s
Employment and Post-Retirement Employment
 
From
December 1, 1979 through December 1, 2002, petitioner was employed by LA Works
as a Director, Executive Director, and eventually its Chief Executive Officer.
(AR 16-17, 807, 1583-85, 1598, 1799.) LA Works contracted with CalPERS at all
relevant times to have LA Works’ employees receive retirement benefits under
CalPERS. (AR 17.) 
 
Petitioner
submitted his application for retirement to CalPERS effective December 31,
2002. (AR 47-50, 1584-85.) On November 18, 2002, petitioner wrote a memorandum
to LA Works’ Board of Directors wherein he proposed “a method for redesigning [his]
current employment relationship” with LA Works. (AR 201.) Petitioner stated in
the memorandum: “In summary, I propose to ‘retire’ under PERS effective January
1, 2003, while simultaneously continuing to lead LA Works as Chief Executive
Officer (CEO).” (AR 201.) Petitioner proposed to work up to 960 hours and be
compensated at $88.42 per hour. (AR 201-02.) Petitioner’s plan was approved,
and it governed his post-retirement employment as LA Works’ CEO from January 1,
2003 through June 10, 2014. (AR 193-95, 321-23.)
 
D.          
Administrative
Proceedings
 
On
April 27, 2015, CalPERS’ Office of Audit Services (“OFAS”) began a review of LA
Works’ compliance with the PERL. (AR 742-52, 1950.) OFAS found evidence that
Velasquez’s post-retirement employment did not comply with the PERL’s
working-after-retirement laws. (AR 83.) The PERL violations were reviewed and
confirmed by CalPERS’ Employment Account Management Division (“EAMD”) in preliminary
and final determination letters. (AR 51-62.) The final determination letter
informed Velasquez that, because of his violations, he would be reinstated from
retirement for the period January 1, 2003 through June 10, 2014. (AR 52.)
Velasquez timely appealed the final determination. (AR 63-72.) 
 
CalPERS
filed a Statement of Issues on December 12, 2019 and Amended Statement of
Issues on January 24, 2022 with the Office of Administrative Hearings (“OAH”).
(AR 16-30, 805-819.) OAH held a three-day evidentiary hearing from January
24-26, 2022 and issued a proposed decision finding that petitioner violated
sections 21221 and 21224 of the PERL in two primary respects. (AR 1936-82.)
First, petitioner violated the PERL because his post-retirement employment with
LA Works was not limited in duration. (AR 1972-73.) Second, petitioner violated
the PERL by accepting a post-retirement pay rate ($88.42) that exceeded his
pre-retirement pay rate in the same position ($61.67). (AR 1973.) 
 
The
Administrative Law Judge (“ALJ”) also rejected petitioner’s defenses, including
the argument that the administrative process had denied him due process. (AR
1980.) Accordingly, the ALJ concluded in the proposed decision that CalPERS
correctly reinstated petitioner and that petitioner must “repay certain
retirement benefits paid by CalPERS” and “pay an amount equal to the employee
contributions that would have been paid during the period, plus interest.” (AR
1982.) The proposed decision was adopted by the CalPERS Board. (AR 1935.)
 
 
II.      Procedural History
 
            On
October 17, 2022, petitioner Salvador Velasquez filed a verified Petition for
writ of administrative mandamus and other relief. On November 17, 2022, respondents
California Public Employees’ Retirement System and Board of Administration of
the California Public Employees’ Retirement System filed an Answer.
 
            On
August 18, 2023, petitioner filed an opening brief. On September 15, 2023, respondents
filed an opposition. On October 2, 2023, petitioner filed a reply. The Court
has received an electronic copy of the administrative record and a hard copy of
the joint appendix. 
 
 
III.     Standard of Review
 
          Petitioner seeks writ relief under both CCP § 1085 and 1094.5.
 
A.          
CCP § 1085
 
CCP
§ 1085(a) provides: “A writ of mandate may be issued by any court to any
inferior tribunal, corporation, board, or person, to compel the performance of
an act which the law specially enjoins, as a duty resulting from an office,
trust, or station, or to compel the admission of a party to the use and
enjoyment of a right or office to which the party is entitled, and from which
the party is unlawfully precluded by that inferior tribunal, corporation,
board, or person.”
 
“There
are two essential requirements to the issuance of a traditional writ of
mandate: (1) a clear, present and usually ministerial duty on the part of the
respondent, and (2) a clear, present and beneficial right on the part of the
petitioner to the performance of that duty.” (California Assn. for Health
Services at Home v. State Dept. of Health Services (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th
696, 704.) “An action in ordinary mandamus is proper where…the claim is that an
agency has failed to act as required by law.” (Id. at 705.)
 
“When
a party seeks review of an administrative decision pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 1085, judicial review is limited to examining the agency
proceedings to ascertain whether the agency's action has been arbitrary,
capricious or lacking entirely in evidentiary support, or whether the agency
failed to follow the proper procedure and give notices required by law. And,
where the case involves the interpretation of a statute or ordinance, our
review of the trial court's decision is de novo.” (Ideal Boat & Camper
Storage v. County of Alameda (2012) 208 Cal.App.4th 301, 311, citing Pomona
Police Officers' Assn. v. City of Pomona (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 578, 584.)
In independently reviewing legal questions, “An administrative agency's
interpretation does not bind judicial review but it is entitled to
consideration and respect.” (Housing Partners I, Inc. v. Duncan (2012)
206 Cal.App.4th 1335, 1343.) 
 
An
agency is presumed to have regularly performed its official duties. (Evid. Code
§ 664.) In a CCP § 1085 writ petition, the petitioner generally bears the
burden of proof. (California Correctional Peace Officers Assn. v. State
Personnel Bd. (1995) 10 Cal.4th 1133, 1154.)         
 
B.          
CCP § 1094.5
 
Under CCP § 1094.5(b),
the pertinent issues are whether the respondent has proceeded without
jurisdiction, whether there was a fair trial, and whether there was a
prejudicial abuse of discretion. An abuse of discretion is established if the
agency has not proceeded in the manner required by law, the decision is not
supported by the findings, or the findings are not supported by the evidence.
(CCP § 1094.5(b).)
 
Because the
administrative decision substantially affects a fundamental vested right, the
Court exercises its independent judgment on the record. (See Prentice
v. Board of Admin. (2007) 157 Cal.App.4th 983, 988.) “Retirement benefits
of the nature involved here have long been held to be a vested and fundamental
right.” (Molina v. Board of Admin. (2011) 200 Cal.App.4th 53, 60
[petition concerning right to receive pension benefit “in an amount specified
by law”]; O’Connor v. State Teachers’ Retirement System (1996) 43
Cal.App.4th 1610, 1620 [same].)
 
Under the independent
judgment test, “the trial court not only examines the administrative record for
errors of law, but also exercises its independent judgment upon the evidence
disclosed in a limited trial de novo.”
(Bixby, 4 Cal.3d at 143.) The court
must draw its own reasonable inferences from the evidence and make its own
credibility determinations. (Morrison v.
Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles Board of Commissioners (2003)
107 Cal. App. 4th 860, 868.)  
 
An agency is presumed to
have regularly performed its official duties. (Evid. Code § 664.) “In
exercising its independent judgment, a trial court must afford a strong
presumption of correctness concerning the administrative findings, and the
party challenging the administrative decision bears the burden of convincing
the court that the administrative findings are contrary to the weight of the
evidence.”  (Fukuda v. City of Angels (1999) 20 Cal.4th 805, 817, internal
quotations omitted.) A reviewing court “will not act as counsel for either
party to an appeal and will not assume the task of initiating and prosecuting a
search of the record for any purpose of discovering errors not pointed out in
the briefs.” (Fox v. Erickson (1950)
99 Cal.App.2d 740, 742.) When an appellant challenges “‘the sufficiency of the
evidence, all material evidence on the point must be set forth and not merely
their own evidence.” (Toigo v. Town of Ross (1998) 70 Cal.App.4th 309,
317.)  
 
 
IV.     Analysis
 
A.          
Jurisdiction
 
Citing
section 20163, petitioner contends that CalPERS does not have the right to
seize, forfeit, or seek repayment from petitioner’s private property. (OB at
8:27-28.) Rather, petitioner contends that CalPERS is restricted to reducing
his pension. Petitioner notes that he stopped receiving pension payments in May
2018. (AR 837, 1416.) 
 
The
administrative decision discusses petitioner’s liability for violating the
post-retirement employment laws set forth in section 21221 and 21224. (AR 1894-95.)
Petitioner was ordered to “repay certain retirement benefits paid by CalPERS
during that period of time” and “pay an amount equal to the employee
contributions that would have been paid during the period, plus interest.” (AR
1904.) 
 
Section
20163(a) states, in relevant part: “Adjustments to correct overpayment of a
retirement allowance may also be made by adjusting the allowance so that the
retired person…will receive the actuarial equivalent of the allowance to which
the member is entitled.” Petitioner appears to argue that, by stopping his
pension payments in May 2018, CalPERS no longer has jurisdiction or authority
to order petitioner to make any further payments. While section 20163 provides
for one option to recoup the amount of overpayment through administrative
adjustment, the statute does state administrative adjustment is the only method
of recoupment. Importantly, section 21220 allows CalPERS to seek reimbursement
of retirement allowances received while unlawfully employed post-retirement
without any reference to section 20163. 
(§ 21220 [“Any retired member employed in violation of this article . .
. shall . . . [r]eimburse this system for any retirement allowance received
during the period or period of employment that are in violation of law”].)
 
CalPERS
had jurisdiction to consider the conditions under which petitioner may continue
to receive retirement benefits. (See § 20125 [“The board shall determine…is
the sole judge of the conditions under which persons may be admitted to and
continue to receive benefits under this system”].) Whether petitioner was
unlawfully employed after his retirement and whether he is obligated to make
payments to CalPERS pursuant to section 21220(b) is part of that jurisdiction. 
 
            Petitioner’s contention that CalPERS
exceeded its jurisdiction is without merit. 
 
B.          
Due
Process
 
Petitioner
contends that CalPERS violated due process by not specifying the facts and law
that petitioner violated from 2003 to 2014. (OB at 2:12-15; see also OB
10:19-21, quoting Barber v. State Personnel Bd. (2019) 35 Cal.App.5th
500, 505-06 [“The SOI did not provide Velasquez with sufficient notice of the rules
he allegedly violated or the specific manner in which the violation occurred, thus
‘he was deprived of his due process right to prepare an effective defense
against the charge and to argue the appropriate punishment’.”].) 
 
            In the Statement of Issues dated
December 12, 2019, the CalPERS Board notified petitioner that his appeal was “limited
to the issue of whether respondent Velasquez’s post retirement employment as a
Chief Executive Officer from January 1, 2003 through May 28, 2014, and
Management Consultant from May 29, 2014 through June 10, 2014, for LA Works
violated the PERL’s post-retirement employment restrictions, making respondent
Velasquez subject to mandatory reinstatement for the period of January 1, 2003
through June 10, 2014, and subject to repayment to CalPERS of retirement
benefits paid during that period.” (AR 30.) As the basis for liability, the
CalPERS Board stated: “Government Code Section 21221(h), in effect as of
January 1, 2003, stated that a retired annuitant appointed to work under this subdivision
could not exceed a total of one year. However, the retired annuitant worked as
the CEO for eleven and a half years.” (AR 20.) Based on the foregoing,
petitioner was sufficiently notified that he had to defend against allegations
that his employment at LA Works from January 1, 2003 to June 10, 2014 violated
section 21221(h). CalPERS thus provided sufficient notice of how the duration
of petitioner’s post-retirement employment violated 21221(h). 
 
Petitioner
accordingly was provided adequate notice and opportunity to defend against
CalPERS’s allegations with respect to duration of his employment.
 
C.          
Post-Retirement
Employment
 
1.           
Burden
of Proof
 
Petitioner
contends that the ALJ improperly applied a preponderance of the evidence
standard. Petitioner maintains that the ALJ should have applied a clear and
convincing standard because the claims against him were originally raised in a
criminal complaint. (OB at 2:10-11.) 
 
“[T]he
party asserting the affirmative at an administrative hearing has the burden of
proof, including both the initial burden of going forward and the burden of
persuasion by a preponderance of the evidence.” (McCoy v. Board of Retirement
(1986) 183 Cal.App.3d 1044, 1051, fn. 5.) Based on McCoy, the ALJ
correctly found that “CalPERS has the burden of establishing by a preponderance
of the evidence that Respondent's post-retirement employment violated the PERL,
and that Respondent should be retroactively reinstated from retirement for the
period of January 1, 2003, through June 10, 2014, as a consequence of violating
the PERL.” (AR 1886.) 
 
            Petitioner relies on Cornell v.
Reilly (1954) 127 Cal.App.2d 178 to support the application of a clear and
convincing evidence standard. “[I]n disciplinary administrative proceedings the
burden of proof is upon the party asserting the affirmative, and that guilt
must be established to a reasonable certainty, and cannot be based on surmise
or conjecture, suspicion or theoretical conclusions, or uncorroborated hearsay.”
(Cornell, 127 Cal.App.2d at 183-84; see
also Johnstone v. Daly City (1958) 156 Cal.App.2d 506, 515-16, quoting Cornell
v. Reilly (1954) 127 Cal.App.2d at 183.) However, Cornell and Johnstone
are license revocation or employment disciplinary actions. (See Kapelus
v. State Bar (1987) 44 Cal.3d 179, 184, fn. 1 [license revocation
proceedings subject to “clear and convincing evidence” standard].) 
 
“[T]he
clear and convincing evidence burden of proof has been applied where
constitutional due process rights or important general public policy
considerations are implicated.” (Baxter Healthcare Corp. v. Denton
(2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 333, 365.) “Generally, a higher burden of proof applies
only where particularly important individual interests or rights, which are
more substantial than the loss of money, are at stake.” (Ibid.) Here,
money is at stake. As respondents point out, petitioner does not cite any cases
indicating that the clear and convincing standard applies in pension violation
cases. 
 
            Accordingly, the ALJ correctly
applied a preponderance of the evidence standard. 
 
2.           
Limited
Duration
 
The
ALJ found that petitioner post-retirement employment with LA Works from January
1, 2003 to June 10, 2014 violated section 21221(h) and 21224(a). (AR 1894-95.)
 
When
petitioner retired as of January 1, 2003, section 21221(h) provided:
 
Upon
appointment by the governing body of a contracting agency to a position deemed
by the governing body to be of a limited duration and requiring specialized
skills or during an emergency to prevent stoppage of public business. These
appointments, in addition to any made pursuant to Section 21224, shall not
exceed a total for all employers of 960-hours in any calendar year. When an
appointment is expected to, or will, exceed 960-hours in any calendar year, the
governing body shall request approval from the board to extend the temporary
employment. The governing body shall present a resolution to the board
requesting action to allow or disallow the employment extension. The resolution
shall be presented prior to the expiration of the 960-hour maximum for the
calendar year. The appointment shall continue until notification of the board's
decision is received by the governing body. The appointment shall be deemed
approved if the board fails to take action within 60 days of receiving the
request. Appointments under this subdivision may not exceed a total of one
year.
 
(Former
§ 21221(h).) 
 
            Current section 21221(h), effective
January 1, 2013, provides:
 
Upon
interim appointment by the governing body of a contracting agency to a vacant
position during recruitment for a permanent appointment and deemed by the
governing body to require specialized skills or during an emergency to prevent
stoppage of public business. A retired person shall only be appointed once to
this vacant position. These appointments, including any made concurrently
pursuant to Section 21224 or 21229, shall not exceed a combined total of 960
hours for all employers each fiscal year. The compensation for the interim
appointment shall not exceed the maximum monthly base salary paid to other
employees performing comparable duties as listed on a publicly available pay
schedule for the vacant position divided by 173.333 to equal an hourly rate. A
retired person appointed to a vacant position pursuant to this subdivision
shall not receive any benefits, incentives, compensation in lieu of benefits,
or any other forms of compensation in addition to the hourly rate. A retired
annuitant appointed pursuant to this subdivision shall not work more than 960
hours each fiscal year regardless of whether he or she works for one or more
employers.
 
(§
21221(h).) 
 
With
respect to the current version of 21221(h), the statute now reads to provide
that the appointment is “interim” and “to a vacant position during recruitment
for a permanent appointment.” The current version now states that a “retired
person shall only be appointed once to this vacant position.” These amendments
became effective in 2012. (AR 1973.) 
 
“Generally,
statutes do not apply retroactively unless the Legislature clearly indicated
otherwise.” (Phillips v. St. Mary Regional Medical Center (2002) 96
Cal.App.4th 218, 229.) However, a “statute that merely clarifies, rather
than changes, existing law does not operate retrospectively even if applied to
transactions predating its enactment” “because the true meaning of the statute
remains the same.” (Western Security Bank v. Superior Court (1997) 15
Cal.4th 232, 243.) “[I]n determining the retroactivity of a statutory
amendment, an amendment that adopts a reasonable interpretation of a previously
ambiguous statute is regarded as clarifying, rather than changing.” (Alameda
County Deputy Sheriff's Association v. Alameda County Employees' Retirement
Association (2020) 9 Cal.5th 1032, 1085, fn. 24, citing In re J.C.
(2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 1462, 1479-80.) 
 
Arguably,
the 2012 amendments are not clarifying because the Legislature added an
additional requirement of the existence of recruitment for a permanent
appointment. Former 21221(h) in existence in 2003 made no reference to the need
to fill a permanent appointment. Moreover, the interim appointment appears to
allow for a duration of more than one year, so long as the retiree does not
work for more than 960 hours “each fiscal year” and so long as recruitment
takes place for a permanent appointment. This is inconsistent with former
21221(h), which only stated that “[a]ppointments…may not exceed a total of one
year.”
 
            Nevertheless, petitioner’s
post-retirement employment violated former 21221(h), at the very least. It is
undisputed that petitioner worked for LA Works from January 1, 2003 to June 10,
2014. Petitioner was Chief Executive Officer of LA Works from January 1, 2003
to March 2013. (AR 1947-48, 1972.) From March 2013 to June 10, 2014, petitioner
worked for LA Works as a consultant, but the ALJ found that such classification
was not persuasive, as petitioner’s paychecks still referred to him as the CEO
and petitioner had testified that he was an at-will employee when he fully
retired from LA Works in 2014. (AR 1972.)
 
Petitioner
contends that, until 2013, section 21221 allowed for multiple “limited
duration” appointments. (OB at 13:5-9.) Petitioner’s employment was renewed
annually. (AR 1958.) 
 
Petitioner
argues former section 21221(h)’s use of the plural “appointments” permitted
“multiple appointments of ‘limited duration’ or ‘one year’ in succession.” (OB
at 13:5-7.) “It is fundamental that legislation should be construed so as to
harmonize its various elements without doing violence to its language or
spirit.” (Wells v. Marina City Properties, Inc. (1981) 29 Cal.3d 781,
788.) Petitioner’s interpretation does violence to the words “limited duration”
in former section 21221(h). Under no reasonable interpretation can successive
appointments, when considered in their aggregate, be considered “limited
duration.” This is especially the case when petitioner remained CEO for more
than 10 years. 
            
To
the extent that former section 21221(h) is ambiguous, “[i]f the words in the statute do not, by themselves, provide a reliable
indicator of legislative intent, ‘[s]tatutory ambiguities often may be resolved
by examining the context in which the language appears and adopting the
construction which best serves to harmonize the statute internally and with
related statutes.’ [Citation.]” (People v. Arias (2008) 45 Cal.4th 169,
177.) “If the statute is ambiguous, we may consider a variety of extrinsic
aids, including legislative history, the statute's purpose, and public policy.”
(Ibid.)
 
Senate
Bill 371, which enacted provisions for repayment in the case of unlawful
employment after retirement, required “retired PERS members to adhere to
imposed work limits if they return to work for a PERS agency.” (AR 667-68., 674.)
“The Legislature imposed this policy to preclude retirees from displacing
active employees, and to preclude public employees from drawing both public
salaries and a publicly-funded retirement benefit.” (AR 674.) Under
petitioner’s interpretation, he could draw both a public salary and retirement
benefits under CalPERS. Petitioner’s position is inconsistent with the public
policy of the “working after retirement” statutes. 
 
Moreover,
CalPERS has instructed that retirees “may work for a CalPERS-covered employer without
reinstatement if [their] employment is temporary in nature.” (AR 473 [April
2000 interpretation]; see also AR 481 [November 2002 interpretation],
493 [September 2004 interpretation – “If you intend to work as a permanent
employee of any CalPERS employer, even if the position requires less than 960
hours of work per year, CalPERS’ law requires reinstatement into active
employment”].) “[W]hile interpretation of a statute or regulation is ultimately
a question of law, [courts] must also defer to an administrative agency’s
interpretation of a statute or regulation involving its area of expertise,
unless the interpretation flies in the face of the clear language and purpose
of the interpreted provision.” (Communities for a Better Environment v.
State Water Resources Control Bd. (2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 1089, 1104.) Considering
the policy behind the “working after retirement” statutes, CalPERS’s guidance
that retirees may work without reinstatement only if the employment is
temporary is entitled to deference. Under no reasonable interpretation can
petitioner’s more than 10 years of employment as CEO post-retirement be
considered temporary. 
 
With
respect to section 21224, when petitioner retired as of January 1, 2003, section
21224 provided:
 
A
retired person may serve without reinstatement from retirement or loss or
interruption of benefits provided by this system upon appointment by the
appointing power of a state agency or any other employer either during an
emergency to prevent stoppage of public business or because the retired
employee has skills needed in performing work of limited duration. These
appointments shall not exceed a total for all employers of 960 hours in any
calendar year, and the rate of pay for the employment shall not be less than
the minimum, nor exceed that paid by the employer to other employees performing
comparable duties.
 
(Former
§ 21224.) 
 
Current
section 21224(a), effective June 27, 2012, provides:
 
A
retired person may serve without reinstatement from retirement or loss or
interruption of benefits provided by this system upon appointment by the
appointing power of a state agency or public agency employer either during an
emergency to prevent stoppage of public business or because the retired person
has specialized skills needed in performing work of limited duration. These
appointments shall not exceed a combined total of 960 hours for all employers
each fiscal year. The compensation for the appointment shall not exceed the
maximum monthly base salary paid to other employees performing comparable
duties as listed on a publicly available pay schedule divided by 173.333 to
equal an hourly rate. A retired person appointed pursuant to this section shall
not receive any benefit, incentive, compensation in lieu of benefits, or other
form of compensation in addition to the hourly pay rate. A retired annuitant
appointed pursuant to this section shall not work more than 960 hours each
fiscal year regardless of whether he or she works for one or more employers.
 
(§
21224(a).) 
 
            Both former and current section
21224 provide that a retiree may work without reinstatement as long as the work
is of “limited duration.” For the reasons stated with respect to section 21221,
petitioner’s more than 10 years of employment post-retirement cannot be
considered “limited duration.” 
 
            Petitioner’s post-retirement
employment thus violated the “working after retirement” statutes.  Accordingly, petitioner is not entitled to
have the administrative decision against him set aside.[2]


V.      Conclusion
 
The petition is DENIED. Pursuant to Local Rule
3.231(n), respondents shall prepare, serve, and ultimately file a proposed
judgment.
