**Tentative Ruling on Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate**

**Case Number:** 22STCP03770
**Hearing Date:** January 16, 2024
**Dept:** 82

**Summary:**

The Court is considering a petition for a writ of mandate filed by Salvador Velasquez, seeking to overturn a decision by the California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS) Board. The dispute revolves around Velasquez's post-retirement employment with LA Works from January 1, 2003, to June 10, 2014, and whether it violated the Public Employees' Retirement Law (PERL).

**Key Points:**

1. **Jurisdiction:** The Court finds that CalPERS had jurisdiction to consider the conditions under which Velasquez may continue to receive retirement benefits.
2. **Due Process:** The Court holds that Velasquez was provided adequate notice and opportunity to defend against CalPERS's allegations regarding the duration of his employment.
3. **Limited Duration:** The Court finds that Velasquez's post-retirement employment with LA Works from January 1, 2003, to June 10, 2014, violated former section 21221(h) of the PERL, which prohibited appointments in excess of one year.
4. **Section 21221(h) Amendments:** The Court concludes that the 2012 amendments to section 21221(h) did not apply retroactively, and therefore, Velasquez's employment remained subject to the one-year limitation.
5. **Public Policy:** The Court finds that the policy behind the "working after retirement" statutes is to prevent retirees from displacing active employees and to preclude public employees from drawing both public salaries and retirement benefits.

**Analysis:**

The Court finds that Velasquez's post-retirement employment with LA Works was not limited in duration, as required by former section 21221(h), and therefore, violates the PERL. The Court also concludes that the 2012 amendments to section 21221(h) did not apply retroactively, and therefore, Velasquez's employment remained subject to the one-year limitation.

**Conclusion:**

The Court grants the writ of mandate and orders CalPERS to vacate its decision and to recalculate Velasquez's retirement benefits in accordance with the PERL.
