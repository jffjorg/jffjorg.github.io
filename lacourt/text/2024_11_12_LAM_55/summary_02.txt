And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Sierra Elizabeth's motion to release the levy on her bank accounts and quash the writ of execution. The writ of execution was issued against Sierra Elizabeth's bank accounts, which were seized and released to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Office. Sierra Elizabeth argues that the funds in her accounts are exempt from collection because they are her earnings from her employment during her marriage to Warren Braithwaite, who was the defendant in the underlying action. The judge finds that the accounts were not liable to satisfy the judgment against Warren Braithwaite because the funds were not commingled with other community funds. The judge also finds that the accounts were exempt without making a claim under Family Code section 911. Finally, the judge orders the return of the funds to Sierra Elizabeth, as the writs of execution were erroneously granted and the accounts were automatically exempt.
