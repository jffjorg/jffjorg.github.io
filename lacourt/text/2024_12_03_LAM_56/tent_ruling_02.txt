MOVING PARTY: Plaintiffs
Diana Sparagna, as an individual, and as Co-Trustee of
Rayna Stephanie Alice Navarro Special Needs Trust dated October 1, 2010 and
Stephen Biafora as Co-Trustee of Rayna Stephanie Alice Navarro Special Needs
Trust dated October 1, 2010 (collectively, “Plaintiffs”)
 
RESPONDING PARTY: Defendant
Linda Spinella (“Defendant”)
 
            The Court has considered the moving,
opposition and reply papers. 
 
BACKGROUND
             This action arises from a settlement agreement
(the “Settlement Agreement”) entered into between Plaintiffs and Defendant on
February 11, 2022 in Los Angeles Superior Court Case No. BC683350 (the “Underlying
Case”). Although the complaint in the within action (the “Complaint”) alleges
that the Settlement Agreement provided that the court in the Underlying Case retained
jurisdiction to enforce the terms thereof [Complaint, ¶1], instead of seeking
relief in the Underlying Case, Plaintiffs filed this separate action, and on
July 2, 2024, Plaintiffs filed the operative Complaint seeking to enforce
certain provisions of the Settlement Agreement. Specifically, the Complaint here
seeks to require Defendant to remit $296,666.67 to Plaintiff Diana Sparagna for
her 1/3 interest in the real property located at 350 Paseo De Playa, Unit 231,
Ventura, CA 93001 (“Paseo de Playa Property”), and to remit $296,666.67 to the
Rayna Stephanie Alice Navarro Special Needs Trust dated October 1, 2010, for
its 1/3 interest in the Paseo de Playa Property. 
 
            On August 15, 2024, Defendant filed
an Answer to the Complaint.
 
            On August 27, 2024, Plaintiffs filed
the instant Demurrer to Defendant’s Answer and Motion to Strike. On November
18, 2024, Defendant filed Oppositions to both the Demurrer and Motion to
Strike. On November 25, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Reply to Defendant’s Opposition
to Motion to Strike. 
 


 
MEET AND CONFER
             The meet and confer requirement has been met. (Code
Civ. Proc., §§ 430.41 subd. (a), 435.5 subd. (a); Su Decl. ¶ 4, Ex. B.) 
 
DEMURRER
            Where pleadings are defective, a
party may raise the defect by way of a demurrer.
(Coyne v.
Krempels (1950) 36 Cal.2d 257, 262.) When considering a demurrer, a court
reads the allegations stated in the challenged pleading liberally and in
context, and "treat[s] the demurrer as admitting all material facts
properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or
law." (Serrano v. Priest (1971) 5 Cal.3d 584, 591.)
 
A
demurrer to an answer may be appropriate if "[t]he answer does not state
facts sufficient to constitute a defense [or] [t]he answer is uncertain."
(Code Civ. Proc., § 430.20,
subds. (a), (b).)
 
Ultimate
facts are generally sufficient, rather than evidentiary matters or legal
conclusions. (Doe
v. City of Los Angeles (2007) 42 Cal.4th 531, 550.)
 
            The critical inquiry when a plaintiff
demurs to an answer is whether the answer raises a defense to plaintiff’s
stated cause of action. (Timberidge Enterprises, Inc. v. City of Santa Rosa
(1978) 86 Cal.App.3d 873, 879-80.) Even where a defense is defectively pled, it
may be allowed if the answer gives sufficient notice to enable the plaintiff to
meet the defense, in part because defenses not pled are waived. (Harris v.
City of Santa Monica (2013) 56 Cal.4th 203, 240.) 
 
            Defendant asserts 13 affirmative
defenses in her Answer. Plaintiffs demur to each of Defendant’s affirmative
defenses on the grounds that they fail to state sufficient facts to constitute
affirmative defense, are ambiguous and state only conclusionary matter.
Additionally, Plaintiffs demur to the Answer on the grounds that it fails to
state facts sufficient to constitute a defense that not all parties were
signatories to the Settlement Agreement. Plaintiffs also contend that the
Answer fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a defense that the absence
of a condition precedent excuses Defendant’s performance. 
            
While the evidentiary facts alleged in the Answer
are sparse, the cardinal rule of pleading is that only the ultimate facts need
to be alleged. (Semole v.
Sansoucie (1972) 28 Cal.App.3d 714, 719.) The “‘distinction
between conclusions of law and ultimate facts is not at all clear and involves
at most a matter of degree. [Citations]. For example, the courts have permitted
allegations which obviously included conclusions of law and have termed them
“ultimate facts” or “conclusions of fact.””’ (Perkins
v. Superior Court (1981) 117 Cal.App.3d 1, 6.)  
 
Most importantly, the sufficiency of an answer
depends on the complaint to which it purports to answer. (South Shore Land Co. v. Petersen (1964) 226 Cal.App.2d 725, 733.) Even where an answer is entirely bare
of facts, it is read with reference to the facts alleged in the complaint or
cross-complaint. Additionally, some vagueness may exist in a defendant’s answer
because most defendants do not have the ability to prove their defenses at the
initial answering phase; accordingly, a defense may be allowed if the
defendant’s pleading gives sufficient notice to enable the plaintiff to prepare
to meet the defense. (Harris, supra 56 Cal.4th at
240.) 

 
Thus, Plaintiffs’ contention that each of the
affirmative defenses fails to include sufficient facts is unavailing.  The Court has reviewed the Answer and finds
that it fairly apprises the Plaintiffs of Defendant’s affirmative defenses. As
pled, the defenses are sufficient to withstand demurrer. (Khoury v. Maly’s of California Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616 [“A demurrer for uncertainty is
strictly construed, even where a complaint is in some respects uncertain,
because ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery procedures.”].) Any
uncertainty as to the facts underlying Defendant’s defenses, including whether
all relevant parties were signatories to the Settlement Agreement or whether
there is a condition precedent to performance, can be clarified in discovery. 
 
            Accordingly, the Demurrer is
OVERRULED in its entirety. 
 
MOTION TO STRIKE 
The
court may, upon a motion or at any time in its discretion and upon terms it
deems proper: (a) strike out any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted
in any pleading; or (b) strike out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or
filed in conformity with the laws of California, a court rule, or an order of
the court. (Code Civ. Proc. § 436, subds. (a), (b); Stafford v. Shultz
(1954) 42 Cal.2d 767, 782 [“Matter in a pleading which is not essential to the
claim is surplusage; probative facts are surplusage and may be stricken out or
disregarded”].)
 
For
the purposes of a motion to strike pursuant to Sections 435 to 437 of the Code
of Civil Procedure, the term “pleading” generally means a demurrer, answer,
complaint, or cross-complaint, (Code Civ. Proc., § 435, subd. (a)), and an
immaterial allegation or irrelevant matter in a pleading entails (1) an
allegation that is not essential to the statement of a claim or defense, (2) an
allegation that is neither pertinent to nor supported by an otherwise
sufficient claim or defense, or (3) a demand for judgment requesting relief not
supported by the allegations of the complaint or cross-complaint (Code Civ.
Proc., § 431.10, subds. (b)(1)-(3), (c)).
In
analyzing a motion to strike, California courts “accept as true the
well-pleaded allegations” in the challenged pleadings, as well as “well-pleaded
allegations admitted in” the responsive “answer.” (Atwell Island Water Dist.
v. Atwell Island Water District (2020) 45 Cal.App.5th 624, 628; Clauson
v. Superior Court (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 1253, 1255 [California courts “read
allegations of a pleading subject to a motion to strike as a whole, all parts
in their context, and assume their truth”].)
 
            Plaintiffs move to strike certain portions
of Defendant’s Answer, and all the affirmative defenses, as false and
irrelevant. (Mot. to Strike, pp. 5:15-6:21.) As discussed above, the Court
finds that the affirmative defenses are well-pled. Further, the challenged sections
of paragraphs 1, 12, 13, and 17 in the Answer are not irrelevant because they
relate directly to Defendant’s ninth affirmative defense of lack of standing
and her eleventh affirmative defense of failure of condition precedent. Thus,
the motion to strike is DENIED. 
            
 
            Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ Demurrer to
Defendant’s Answer is OVERRULED. 
 
            Plaintiffs’ Motion to Strike is
DENIED. 
 
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
