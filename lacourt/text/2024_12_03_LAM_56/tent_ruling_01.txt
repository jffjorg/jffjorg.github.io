            The Court has considered the moving
papers. No opposition or reply has been filed. 
 
BACKGROUND
            Plaintiff’s Complaint arises from an
alleged breach of a construction contract. On April 2, 2024, Plaintiff filed
the operative First Amended Complaint against Defendants asserting the
following causes of action: (1) breach of written contract; (2) breach of
implied warranty; (3) for money paid; (4) open book account; (5) unjust
enrichment; (6) negligence; (7) intentional misrepresentation; (8) false
promises; (9) fraudulent suppression of material fact; (10) disgorgement –
violation of Business & Professions Code §§ 7031, et seq.; (11) unfair
competition and business practices – Business & Professions Code § 17200;
(12) declaratory relief; and (13) action on contractor’s license board.       
             
On
November 05, 2024, Defendant Ben Amin Assil, individually and d/b/a Biltmore
Inc. d/b/a Buildmore Construction & Remodeling, Biltmore, Inc. filed a First
Amended Cross-Complaint asserting the following causes of action: (1) breach of
contract; (2) open book account; (3) negligence; (4) intentional
misrepresentation; (5) unjust enrichment; (6) violation of Business and
Professions Code § 17200 et seq.; (7) retaliation; and (8) injunctive relief.
 
On
September 16, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant Motion for an Order Compelling
Response to Form Interrogatories from Defendant Ben Amin Assil (“Assil”), Motion
for an Order Compelling Response to Request for Production of Documents from
Assil, and Motion for an Order Establishing Admissions from Assil. No
opposition has been filed. 
 
DISCUSSION
            A motion to compel an initial
response can be made on the ground that a party did not serve a timely response
to interrogatories or a demand to produce. (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2030.290, subd.
(a) [interrogatories], 2031.300, subd. (a) [demand to produce]; Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 404 (Sinaiko).) 
 
To establish this
ground, a movant must show:
(1) Proper service (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.080, subd. (a)
[interrogatories], 2031.040 [demand to produce]);
(2)
Expiration of the deadline for the initial response 30 days after service or on
date agreed to by parties (see Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.260, subds. (a), (b)
[interrogatories], 2031.260, subds. (a), (b) [demand to produce]); and
(3)
No timely response (see Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290 [interrogatories],
2031.300 [demand to produce]).
 
Additionally,
the discovering party can make a motion to deem as admitted any unanswered
requests for admission or any requests answered in a late or unverified
response. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.240,
subd. (a) [RFA responses must be signed by responding party under oath]; Appleton
v. Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 632, 636 (Appleton) [unsworn
response to RFAs is treated like no response].) These requests are not
automatically deemed admitted; the discovering party must make the motion.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).)
 
To
establish this ground, a movant must show:
(1)
Proper service (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.070);
(2)
Expiration of the deadline for the initial response 30 days after service or on
date agreed to by parties (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.250, subds. (a), (b)); and
(3)
That (a) the responding party served no response (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280,
subd. (b)), (b) the propounding party served a late response (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2033.280, subd. (b)); or (3) the responding party served an unsworn response.
(Appleton, supra, 206 Cal.App.3d at  636).
 
A
court must deny a motion to compel initial discovery where the discovery sought
is outside the scope of discovery. (CBS, Inc. v. Superior Court (1968)
263 Cal.App.2d 12, 19; Code. Civ. Proc., § 2017.010 [scope of discovery].) 
 
The
discovery was served via mail and electronic mail on Assil on August 2, 2024. (All
Motions, Omrani Decl., ¶ 6, Exs. A-B [Proof of Service].) The deadline to
respond was 30 days after service, plus five days for service via mail. (Code
Civ. Proc. § 1013 subd. (a).) Thus, responses were due on September 7, 2024. As
of the date of the hearing on these motions, there is no evidence before the
Court that Assil has responded to the discovery requests. 
 
Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s Motion for an Order Compelling Response to
Form Interrogatories is GRANTED.
Plaintiff’s
Motion for an Order Compelling Response to Request for
Production of Documents is GRANTED 
Plaintiff’s
Motion for an Order Establishing Admissions is
GRANTED. 
 
SANCTIONS
The
Court must impose monetary sanctions against anyone—party, nonparty, or
attorney—who unsuccessfully makes or opposes the motion, unless it finds that
the person to be sanctioned acted with substantial justification or other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanctions unjust. (Code Civ. Proc., §§
2030.290, subd. (c) [interrogatories], 2031.300, subd. (c) [demand to produce];
Sinaiko, supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at 404 [interrogatories and
demand to produce].)
 
The
Court must award sanctions when a party’s response to request for admissions is
untimely, and the discovering party makes a motion to deem the requests
admitted. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c); Appleton, supra,
206 Cal.App.3d at 635-636 [sanctions are mandatory].)
 
The
court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files
a motion to compel discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was
filed, or opposition to the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery
was provided to the moving party after the motion was filed. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1348, subd. (a).)
 
Even
after a party provides discovery responses, a party can keep its motion on
calendar and the court has authority to grant sanctions, even if it denies the
motion to compel responses “as essentially unnecessary, in whole or in part.” (Sinaiko,
supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at 409.)
 
            Plaintiff
requests sanctions for the Motion for an Order Compelling Response to Form
Interrogatories against Assil in the total amount of $1,263.52 based upon
counsel’s rate of $475.00/hour for: (1) 1.0 hour meeting and conferring,
researching, preparing, and filing the motion and accompanying documents; (2)
0.75 hours reviewing the opposition and preparing a reply; (3) 0.75 hours for
the hearing on the motion; and (4) filing fees of $76.02. As no opposition was
filed and as an argument in excess of .5 hours us unlikely, a 1.0 hour reduction
is appropriate. Also, the actual Court filing fee for motions is $60.  Thus, the request for sanctions is GRANTED in
the reduced amount of 772.50. 
            
Plaintiff requests sanctions for the Motion
for an Order Compelling Response to Request for Production of Documents against
Assil in the total amount of $1,263.52 based upon counsel’s rate of
$475.00/hour for: (1) 1.0 hour meeting and conferring, researching, preparing,
and filing the motion and accompanying documents; (2) 0.75 hours reviewing the
opposition and preparing a reply; (3) 0.75 hours for the hearing on the motion;
and (4) filing fees of $76.02. As no opposition was filed, and the time meeting
and conferring and attending the hearing on this motion is duplicative of the
other motions, and for the reasons set forth above, a reduction is appropriate.
Thus, the request for sanctions is GRANTED in the reduced amount of $535.00.
 
Plaintiff
requests sanctions for the Motion for an Order Establishing Admissions against
Assil in the total amount of $1,263.52 based upon counsel’s rate of
$475.00/hour for: (1) 1.0 hour meeting and conferring, researching, preparing,
and filing the motion and accompanying documents; (2) 0.75 hours reviewing the
opposition and preparing a reply; (3) 0.75 hours for the hearing on the motion;
and (4) filing fees of $76.02. As no opposition was filed, and the time meeting
and conferring and attending the hearing on this motion is duplicative of the
other motions, a similar reduction is appropriate. Thus, the request for
sanctions is GRANTED in the reduced amount of 535.00.
 
Plaintiff’s
Motion for an Order Compelling Response to Form Interrogatories, is GRANTED. Assil
is ordered to serve full, Code-compliant, verified responses, without
objections within 20 days.

is GRANTED. Assil is ordered to serve full,
Code-compliant, verified responses, without objections within 20 days. 
 
Plaintiff’s
Motion for an Order Establishing Admissions is GRANTED. The admissions are
deemed ADMITTED as truth. 
 
Assil
is ordered to pay a total of $1,842.50 to Plaintiff within twenty days of the
date of this order.
 
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.            
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
