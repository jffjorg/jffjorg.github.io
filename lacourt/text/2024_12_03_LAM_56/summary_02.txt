Here is a brief summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has considered the demurrer to the answer and the motion to strike. The demurrer is overruled, and the court finds that the affirmative defenses are well-pled and sufficient to withstand demurrer. The motion to strike is also denied. The court finds that the answer fairly apprises the plaintiffs of the defendant's affirmative defenses, and that the challenged sections of the answer are not irrelevant because they relate directly to the defendant's ninth affirmative defense of lack of standing and her eleventh affirmative defense of failure of condition precedent.
