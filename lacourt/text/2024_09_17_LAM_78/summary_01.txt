And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Michelle Kim on a motion for attorney's fees filed by Commercial Loan Servicing, LLC (CLS) against Lawrence E. Feigen, Jeffrey Ahlholm, and SA Hospital Real Estate Holdings-Jefferson, LLC (Cross-Defendants). The motion is to recover attorney's fees in the amount of $407,942.50 based on 580.9 hours of work performed by CLS's attorneys at hourly rates ranging from $325 to $825. The Court finds that CLS is the prevailing party on its Cross-Complaint and that the rates requested by CLS are reasonable. The Court also finds that CLS has provided sufficient evidence to support the work that was performed. However, the Court does not intend to award hours for work that was performed in connection with CLS's defense against Plaintiff's complaint. The motion is continued to allow CLS to submit an amended declaration in support of the motion that details only the work performed in connection with CLS's prosecution of the action against Cross-Defendants.
