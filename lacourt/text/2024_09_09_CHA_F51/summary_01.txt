```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the plaintiff's motion to vacate the dismissal of her complaint is granted. The plaintiff's counsel failed to appear for two hearings, one on April 25, 2024, and another on May 30, 2024, leading to the dismissal of the complaint. However, the plaintiff's counsel had a legitimate reason for not appearing, as she was hospitalized due to a biopsy procedure and later diagnosed with pneumonia. The judge finds that the failure to appear was due to excusable neglect and that all requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 473 have been satisfied. Therefore, the judge grants the plaintiff's request to set aside the dismissal of her complaint.
