And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is granting the defendant's motion to file a first amended answer to assert additional affirmative defenses. The defendant's counsel claims they were under the mistaken impression that the plaintiff's First Amended Complaint (FAC) only added the defendant as a party, and not also included claims under the Private Attorney General Act (PAGA). The judge finds that this mistake is good cause to grant the requested amendments. The plaintiff argues that the court should not grant the motion because affirmative defenses must be pled in the answer, but the judge finds this argument to be fallacious and without merit. The judge also notes that the plaintiff delayed approximately one year between filing the initial complaint and bringing the defendant into the case, and that the defendant's counsel raised the issue with the plaintiff's counsel within 60 days of the answer being filed. The judge orders the defendant to file its first amended answer forthwith.
