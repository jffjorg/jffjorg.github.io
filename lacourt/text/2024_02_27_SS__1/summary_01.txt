And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to file an amended complaint, which adds new claims of sexual orientation discrimination, disability discrimination, retaliation, and wrongful termination. The judge finds that the motion is insufficiently supported, violating California Rules of Court, rule 3.1112(a). Additionally, the judge believes that the case is no longer complex, as all individual and class claims have been dismissed, and the remaining claims are not complex. The judge also notes that the plaintiff has not followed the proper procedures for presenting his claims to the DFEH or EEOC, and therefore, the amendments are not in furtherance of justice. Instead, the judge suggests that the plaintiff should file a new action, which may be assigned to an independent calendar court.
