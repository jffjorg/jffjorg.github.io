This is an employment action.  Plaintiff Martin Ansoorian seeks to compel further responses to his requests for production, set one, nos. 1-118 from Defendant Tesla Motors, Inc.  Tesla objected to every single request but for most requests made a reference to documents having Bates numbers 1-262.Tesla argues the Motion is “moot” because it has since produced more documents.  This mostly lacks merit because Tesla’s initial responses, including its objections, are still at issue.  The Motion is granted as to request nos. 1-14, 16-21, 23-58, 60-64, 68-71, 73-74, 76-78, 80-102, 105-118.  This is mostly basic or essential discovery relating to pay, job duties, complaints, communications, hiring documents, warnings, investigations, performance evaluations, instances of harassment, etc.  If a privilege applies, a privilege log must be provided.  All other objections lack merit.  The Motion is denied as to request nos. 15 (any communication that could relate to Plaintiff’s job duties), 22 (entire personnel file of Defendant Affre), 59 (every email involving Plaintiff), 65 (identity of anyone terminated by Defendant when Affre was supervisor), 66 (all Parts Advisors), 67 (documents relating to any fact alleged by Plaintiff), 72 (all documents pertaining to person that replaced Plaintiff), 75 (somewhat unintelligible), 79 (duplicative job duties), 103 (overreaching and irrelevant transfer documents), and 104 (overbroad and poorly written request), which are overbroad, overburdensome, and/or duplicative.  The Motion is granted in part.  Further responses and production are to be provided within 30 days.   The Court awards Plaintiff $1,000 in sanctions.Moving party to give notice.
