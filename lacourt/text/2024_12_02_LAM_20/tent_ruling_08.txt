 On March 6, 2023, Plaintiff AMAG, Inc. filed the operative First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) for (1) fraudulent conversion, (2) misrepresentation, (3) constructive fraud, (4) breach of fiduciary duty, and (5) declaratory relief.  Plaintiff alleges that Defendant Vlaze Media Networks, Inc. sought to avoid the judgment against it in case no. BC587406 by fraudulently transferring certain assets to the other Defendants or with the help of the other Defendants.   On May 1, 2023, Anastasiia Arseneva filed the operative Second Amended Cross-Complaint (“SACC”) for (1) breach of written contract, (2) quantum meruit, (3) violation of Pen. Code §§ 528.5, 529, and (4) declaratory relief. Arseneva now seeks to compel further responses to her requests for production, nos. 1-33 from Zambrano.   No opposition was filed. The Motion is denied.  Evidence of the burglary seems to be in the possession of the Baldwin Police Department, and the other requests are unsupported, overboard, overburdensome, duplicative and/or irrelevant.  The Court will also note that Arseneva’s phone records—that she fought for months not to disclose—will likely reveal whether she was involved in the subject burglary. No sanctions will be awarded. Moving party to give notice.
