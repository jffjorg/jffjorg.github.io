And here is the summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case BC587406. The plaintiff, AMAG, Inc., filed a First Amended Complaint (FAC) alleging fraudulent conversion, misrepresentation, constructive fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, and declaratory relief against the defendant, Vlaze Media Networks, Inc. The defendant allegedly transferred assets to other defendants to avoid a judgment. The cross-defendant, Anastasiia Arseneva, filed a Second Amended Cross-Complaint (SACC) seeking to compel further responses to requests for production from Zambrano. The motion was not opposed. The judge denied the motion and noted that evidence related to a burglary seems to be in the possession of the Baldwin Police Department. The judge also stated that Arseneva's phone records, which she fought to keep private, may reveal her involvement in the burglary. No sanctions will be awarded. The moving party is required to give notice of the ruling.
