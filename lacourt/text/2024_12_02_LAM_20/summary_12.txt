And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling concerns an employment action brought by plaintiff Martin Ansoorian against defendant Tesla Motors, Inc. Ansoorian seeks to compel further responses to his requests for production of documents related to his employment. Tesla objected to most of the requests, citing Bates numbers for a few documents. However, Tesla's initial responses, including objections, are still at issue, and the motion is not moot. The court grants the motion as to most requests, including those related to pay, job duties, complaints, communications, and hiring documents. However, the court denies the motion as to certain requests deemed overbroad, overburdensome, and/or duplicative. The court awards Ansoorian $1,000 in sanctions and orders Tesla to provide further responses and productions within 30 days.
