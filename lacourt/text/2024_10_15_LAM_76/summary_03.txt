And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling sustaining the demurrer of the defendants, JLR Los Angeles, LLC and US Auto CA, LLC, to the first cause of action of the plaintiff's First Amended Complaint. The plaintiff alleges sexual harassment and failure to prevent sexual harassment by Renata Grinshpun, a sales representative. The judge finds that the claim for sexual harassment is not sufficiently pled because the plaintiff has not alleged specific details of the harassing conduct, and that the claim for failure to prevent sexual harassment is not sufficiently pled because there is no allegation of actual discrimination, harassment, or retaliation. The judge gives the plaintiff 30 days' leave to amend the complaint.
