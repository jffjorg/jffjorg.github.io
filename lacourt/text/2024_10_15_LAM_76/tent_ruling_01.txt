ANALYSIS
Motion To Consolidate
Discussion
Plaintiff Kim Pham moves to
consolidate this action with 23STCV01787 for all purposes or, in the
alternative, at the time of trial. 
Plaintiff represents the following
as to the cases: (1) Case No. 20STCV16798 Kim Pham V. County Of Los Angeles
Probation Department; Los Angeles County Probation Department; Toyea Sims,
Cynthia Milauto; (2) Case No. 23STCV0178 Kim Pham V. County Of Los Angeles
Probation Department; Los Angeles County Probation Department; Toyea Sims,
Cynthia Milauto.  
Plaintiff KIM PHAM has made an
appearance in both actions and whose counsel of record in this matter is
Kristen B. Brown, Esq., Kristen Brown Law Firm.  
Defendant(s) COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES
PROBATION DEPARTMENT; LOS ANGELES COUNTY PROBATION DEPARTMENT have made
appearances in both actions and represented in both actions by Hausman &
Sosa, LLP. 
TOYEA SIMS has answered in Case No.
20STCV16798 and represented by Hausman & Sosa, LLP. 
TOYEA SIMS has been served in Case
No. 23STCV0178 with a responsive pleading due on or about July 3, 2024. 
CYNTHIA MILAUTO has been served in
both cases Case No. 20STCV16798 and Case No. 23STCV0178 with responsive
pleadings due on or about July 3, 2024. 
This motion is made pursuant to
Code Civ. Proc. § 1048(a) on the grounds that the actions involve common
questions of law or fact and are pending before this Court and the cases arise
out of the same transaction or incident. Plaintiff argues that the same
witnesses will likely testify and the same evidence will be presented in both
actions, and consolidated discovery and motions will avoid unnecessary costs
and delays and will serve the interests of economy and convenience. Plaintiff
argues that consolidation will avoid prejudice to Defendant of inconsistent
adjudications by the trier of fact on the same issues.
Regarding
consolidation, Civ. Proc. Code, § 1048(a) provides: 
(a) When actions involving a common
question of law or fact are pending before the court, it may order a joint
hearing or trial of any or all the matters in issue in the actions; it may
order all the actions consolidated and it may make such orders concerning
proceedings therein as may tend to avoid unnecessary costs or delay.
 
(Civ. Proc. Code, § 1048(a).)
 
            “Whether
separate actions shall be consolidated for trial is a matter within the
discretion of the trial court and its decision will not be disturbed on appeal
absent a clear showing of abuse of discretion. (Citation omitted.) . . . ‘A
consolidation of actions does not affect the rights of the parties. The purpose
of consolidation is merely to promote trial convenience and economy by avoiding
duplication of procedure, particularly in the proof of issues common to both
actions.’ (Citation omitted.)” (Estate of Baker (1982) 131 Cal.App.3d 471, 485 [bold
emphasis added].)
            Here, 20STCV16798 is set to go to
trial on August 25, 2025, while 23STCV01787 is set to go to trial on April 14,
2025. In this action, 20STCV16798, Defendants have a motion for summary
judgment or, in the alternative, summary adjudication set to be heard on July
10, 2025.
            At this point, the trial in 23STCV01787
will occur four months prior to the trial in 20STCV16798. Plaintiff has not
presented a persuasive issue why consolidation should occur when it would have
the effect of continuing the April 14, 2025 trial in 23STCV01787, which should
deal with conduct that occurred before the Complaint in 20STCV16798 was filed
on May 1, 2020, while 23STCV01787 should deal with the discrete conduct that
occurred between May 1, 2020 (when 20STCV16709 was filed) and January 26, 2023,
when the Complaint was filed in 23STCV01787.
            Accordingly, the Court exercises its
discretion to decline consolidation, but Plaintiff may renew this motion at a
later date.
The motion to consolidate is DENIED without prejudice.
