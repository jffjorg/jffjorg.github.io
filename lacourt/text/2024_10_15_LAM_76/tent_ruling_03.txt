Declaration of Fallon Martinez reflects that Defendants’ counsel satisfied the meet
and confer requirement set forth in Civ. Proc. Code, § 430.41 as to the First Amended
Complaint.DiscussionDefendants
JLR Los Angeles, LLC and US Auto CA, LLC demur to the First Amended Complaint.1.         First
Cause of Action (Sexual Harassment/Failure To Prevent Sexual Harassment).            Defendants
argue that this cause of action is not sufficiently pled to constitute severe and
pervasive sexual harassment.            Plaintiff
cites the recent amendment to Government Code § 12923(b) which states that even
a single incident of harassing conduct is sufficient to create a triable issue.It is an unlawful employment practice for an
employer to “harass” an employee based on membership in a protected class, including
“because of race.” (§ 12940, subd. (j)(1).) “Harassment of an employee … by an employee,
other than an agent or supervisor, shall be unlawful if the entity, or [*627]  its agents or supervisors, knows or should have
known of this conduct and fails to take immediate and appropriate corrective action.”
(Ibid.) Harassment includes “[v]erbal harassment” such as “epithets, derogatory
comments or slurs on a basis enumerated in the Act” (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 2, §
11019, subd. (b)(2)(A)); it also includes “[p]hysical” and “[v]isual forms of harassment”
(id., subd. (b)(2)(B), (C)).To prevail on a claim that a workplace is racially
hostile under FEHA, an employee must show she was subjected to harassing conduct
that was (1) unwelcome; (2) because of race; and (3) sufficiently severe or pervasive
to alter the conditions of her employment and create an abusive work environment.
(See Lyle v. Warner Brothers Television Productions (2006) 38 Cal.4th 264,
279 [42 Cal. Rptr. 3d 2, 132 P.3d 211] [setting out prima facie requirements for
sexual harassment claims under FEHA]; Boyer-Liberto v. Fontainebleau Corp.
(4th Cir. 2015) 786 F.3d 264, 277 (Boyer-Liberto) [setting out prima facie
requirements for racial harassment claims under Title VII].) In addition, she must
establish that the offending conduct was imputable to her employer. (Lyle,
at p. 279; Boyer-Liberto, at p. 277.) The parties here do not dispute that
Larkin’s conduct was unwelcome and because of race.4 We therefore turn to consider
its severity and the City’s liability.            .
. .The objective severity of harassment should
be judged from the perspective of a reasonable person in the plaintiff’s position.
(Miller, supra, 36 Cal.4th at p. 462; Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services,
Inc. (1998) 523 U.S. 75, 78 [140 L. Ed. 2d 201, 118 S. Ct. 998] (Oncale).)
We acknowledge, as has the Ninth Circuit before us, that “[r]acially motivated comments
or actions may appear innocent or only mildly offensive to one who is not a member
of the targeted group,” but “intolerably abusive or threatening when understood
from the perspective of a plaintiff who is a member of the targeted group.” (McGinest
v. GTE Service Corp. (9th Cir. 2004) 360 F.3d 1103, 1116 (McGinest).)
We must therefore consider allegations of a racially hostile workplace “from
the perspective of a reasonable person belonging to the racial or ethnic group of
the plaintiff.” (Id. at p. 1115; accord, Nazir v. United Airlines,
Inc. (2009) 178 Cal.App.4th 243, 264 [100 Cal. Rptr. 3d 296] (Nazir).)
This allows us to “recognize forms of discrimination that are real and hurtful,
and yet may be overlooked if considered solely from the perspective of an adjudicator
belonging to a different group than the plaintiff.” (McGinest, at p. 1116.)(Bailey v. San Francisco Dist. Attorney’s
Office (2024) 16 Cal. 5th 611, 626-27, 629 [bold emphasis added].)            Here,
the 1AC alleges as follows:

10. In February
of 2024, Sales Representative Renata Grinshpun made sexually explicit comments and
advances towards Plaintiff, and sexually harassed him in a manner that was severe
and/or pervasive, satisfying the elements of Cal. Gov. Code § 12923. 11. On February
12, 2024, after Plaintiff authorized a paint correction for Grinshpun’s customer,
she called Plaintiff and screamed at him aggressively. Plaintiff is informed and
believes that Grinshpun’s behavior was substantially motivated by the fact that
Plaintiff rejected her sexual advances, compounding the hostile work environment.
Plaintiff immediately reported his concerns to Brown and documented them in an email,
including Grinchpun’s sexual harassment.. . .  17. Plaintiff
was subjected to harassing conduct by his co-worker, and this harassment was sexual
in nature and predicated upon his sex.     (1AC, ¶¶ 10, 11, 17.)            Here,
Plaintiff must allege exactly what Grinshpun said to Plaintiff, such that it can
be said that, as an objective matter, what a female subordinate (Grinshpun) said
to a male superior (Plaintiff) could be considered sexually harassing by a reasonable
person in Plaintiff’s position. There is no justification for vagueness in
relating the comments or conduct. “Although a court must on demurrer accept as true properly
pleaded facts, a demurrer does not admit contentions or conclusions of law or fact.”
(Freeman
v. San Diego Assn. of Realtors (1999) 77 Cal.App.4th 171, 185.)            As
such, the claim for sexual harassment is not sufficiently pled.Nor is the claim for failure to prevent sexual harassment
sufficiently pled. A failure to prevent claim under FEHA requires that the actual
discrimination, harassment or retaliation have actually occurred. (See Carter v. California Dept. of Veterans
Affairs (2006) 38 Cal.4th 914, 925, fn. 4; Kelley v. The Conco Companies (2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 191, 208,
superseded by statute on other grounds as stated in Taylor v. Nabors Drilling
USA, LP (2014) 222 Cal.App.4th 1228, 1239; Scotch v. Art Institute of California (2009) 173 Cal.App.4th 986, 1021; Thompson v. City of Monrovia (2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 860, 880,)            The
demurrer to the first cause of action is SUSTAINED with leave to amend.
            Plaintiff is given 30 days’ leave to
amend.
