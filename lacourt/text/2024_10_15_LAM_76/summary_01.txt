And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to consolidate two cases, 20STCV16798 and 23STCV01787, filed by Plaintiff Kim Pham against the County of Los Angeles Probation Department and others. The Plaintiff seeks to consolidate the two cases for all purposes or at the time of trial. The judge has denied the motion without prejudice, meaning that the Plaintiff may refile the motion at a later date. The judge finds that the two cases are pending before different trial dates and that consolidating them would create unnecessary delay and prejudice to the Defendant. The judge also notes that the Plaintiff has not presented a persuasive argument for consolidation, and that the two cases involve distinct conduct and issues.
