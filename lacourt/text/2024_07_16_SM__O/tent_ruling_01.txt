TENTATIVE
RULING
            Defendant/Cross-Complainants James and Ada Horwichs’ Motion
to Reopen Discovery to Allow Property Inspection is GRANTED. The Court orders
discovery reopened for the limited purposes of allowing the
Defendant/Cross-Complainants’ Property Inspection. 
 
            Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant
Adam Askari’s RJN is GRANTED as to the existence of articles, court documents,
and the administrative ruling documents, but not to the “truth of the hearsay
statements in the documents.” (In re Vicks (2013) 56 Cal.4th 274, 314.)
The Court notes that the discovery cutoff date was 3-11-24, not 3-8-24 as
stated in the opposition. 
 
 
REASONING
Any party shall be entitled as a matter of right to
complete discovery proceedings on or before the 30th day, and to have motions
concerning discovery heard on or before the 15th day, before the date initially
set for trial.  (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2024.020.)  “The purpose of
imposing a time limit on discovery is to expedite and facilitate trial
preparation and to prevent delay.¿ Without a cutoff date, the parties could tie
up each other and the trial court in discovery and discovery disputes right up
to the eve of trial or beyond. Furthermore, . . . to be effective the cutoff
date must be firm or some litigants will manipulate the proceedings to avoid
the cut-off date.”  (Beverly Hosp. v. Superior Court¿(1993) 19
Cal.App.4th 1289, 1295.)  The reopening of discovery is a matter that is
committed to the trial court’s sound discretion.¿ (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2024.050,
subd. (a), (b).)
 
Pursuant to CCP §2024.050, the court shall take into
consideration any matter relevant to the leave requested, including, but not
limited to, the following:  (1) The necessity and the reasons for the
discovery; (2) The diligence or lack of diligence of the party seeking the
discovery or the hearing of a discovery motion, and the reasons that the
discovery was not completed or that the discovery motion was not heard earlier;
(3) Any likelihood that permitting the discovery or hearing the discovery motion
will prevent the case from going to trial on the date set, or otherwise
interfere with the trial calendar, or result in prejudice to any other party;
and (4) The length of time that has elapsed between any date previously set,
and the date presently set, for the trial of the action.  (See Code Civ.
Proc., § 2025.050, subd. (b); see also  Cottini
v. Enloe Medical Center (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 401,
420-421 [trial court properly denied request to reopen discovery to conduct
expert discovery where moving party refused to disclose grounds for late expert
witnesses and failed to demonstrate diligence in seeking discovery prior to the
cutoff date].)   
            
            Defendants/Cross-Complainants James and Ada Horwich (the
“Horwiches”) request that discovery be reopened so that they may complete the
property inspection of Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant Adam Askari’s (“Askari”)
property. The Horwiches establish necessity by explaining that the inspection
is “critical” to their claims and defenses made in the Complaint and Cross-Complaint.
(Motion, p. 8:2–5.) Inspection of the property is essential to determine the
Tennis court noise levels and the decibels generated by Askari’s sound system. 
 
            The Horwiches establish their
diligent efforts to inspect the property prior to the discovery cutoff date of
3-11-24. The initial demand to inspect the property was served on 7-6-23, with
an inspection date initially set for of 8-11-23, however Askari did not repond
or object to the demand. (Ruttenberg Decl., ¶ 2, Ex. A.) The Horwiches
repeatedly met and conferred with Askari beginning in August 2023 regarding the
property inspection demand, but Askari refused. (Ruttenberg Decl., ¶ 3; Ex. B.)
The Horwiches establish why the motion was not heard prior to the discovery
deadline because both parties were “in frequent contact, getting along, and
actively discussing settlement in earnest.” (Ibid.) The Horwiches
declare that they continued to make efforts to inspect the property up until
4-10-24 but no inspection date was ever agreed upon, and no response was given
on the last attempt. (Id., ¶¶ 3, 4; Ex. C.) Thus, the Horwiches
establish their diligent efforts to conduct the inspection, and the reasons the discovery was not completed or that the discovery
motion was not heard earlier. 
 
            The Trial
is set for 10-14-24, around five months away, and with the limited nature of
the discovery request a further trial continuance should not be necessary. Furthermore,
the Horwiches filed this motion on 4-19-24, less than a month after the
discovery motion cut-off date of 3-25-24. Due to the ongoing communication and
efforts to settle the case between the parties, this is reasonable amount of
time after the cut-off to file the motion to reopen discovery. 
 
            Additionally,
Askari does not provide persuasive evidence showing Askari will suffer any prejudice
if discovery is reopened for this limited purpose
 
            For
these reasons, the Horwiches motion to reopen discovery is GRANTED pursuant to
CCP §2024.050.
