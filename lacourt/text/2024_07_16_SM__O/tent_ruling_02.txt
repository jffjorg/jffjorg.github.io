TENTATIVE
RULING
            Plaintiff Ann Cherico’s Motion for Monetary Sanctions in
the amount of $1,717.60 is GRANTED. The Court orders Defendant Chateau Bretana,
LP ordered to produce the June 2021 mold test or provide a statement of
inability to comply with the request pursuant to CCP § 2031.230. The Court
orders Defendant Chateau Bretana, LP to pay sanctions in the amount of $1,717.60
(Greer Decl., ¶ 13; 3.8 hrs @ $452/hr.)
 
Plaintiff
served RFPs on 9-21-23, Defendant provided initial responses on 10-23-23.
(Greet Decl., ¶¶ 2, 3, Ex. A, B.) Defendant provided supplemental responses on
11-27-23 after Plaintiff sent and meet and confer email on 10-27-23. (Greer
Decl., ¶¶ 4, 5, Ex. C, D.) The Parties met and conferred again on 11-16-23 via
a phone conversation where Defendant agreed to provide, and did provide,
additional supplemental responses by 11-27-23. (Greer Decl., ¶¶ 6, 7. Ex. F.) Plaintiff’s
motion to compel further responses to RFPs was granted on 3-28-24, Defendants
partially supplemented their RFPs on 4-12-24, and then submitted more responses
to RFPs on 7-2-24 along with the opposition to this motion. (See 3-28-24 Minute
Order; Greer Decl., ¶ 10, Ex. K, I; Torsney Decl., ¶ 2, Ex. A.) Plaintiffs
argue Defendants produced the July and August mold tests, but still have not
produced the June 2021 test in their 7-2-24 supplemental responses. (See Reply,
pp. 2–3.) 
 
Defendants
are ordered to produce the June 2021 mold test or provide a statement of
inability to comply with the request pursuant to CCP § 2031.230. Defendant
filed supplemental responses in response to this motion being filed and thus
are ordered to pay sanctions in the amount of $1,717.60 (3.8 hrs. @ $452/hr.) pursuant
to Cal. Rules of Court Rule 3.1348. The Court will not honor Plaintiff’s
request to triple the monetary sanctions as no authority is provided to show
that this type of request is warranted. Furthermore, issue and evidentiary
sanctions are not warranted at this stage.
