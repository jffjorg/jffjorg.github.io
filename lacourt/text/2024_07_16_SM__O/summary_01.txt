Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to reopen discovery to allow for a property inspection. The defendant, James and Ada Horwich, need to inspect the plaintiff's property to determine the noise levels and decibels generated by the plaintiff's sound system. The judge finds that the defendant has established the necessity of the inspection and has been diligent in their efforts to conduct the inspection prior to the discovery cutoff date. The plaintiff, Adam Askari, has not shown that he will be prejudiced if discovery is reopened for this limited purpose. The judge orders discovery to be reopened for the limited purpose of allowing the defendant to complete the property inspection. The trial is currently set for October 14, 2024, and the judge does not expect the reopening of discovery to cause any significant delay in the trial.
