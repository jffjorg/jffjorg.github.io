And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,717.60. The defendant, Chateau Bretana, LP, is ordered to produce the June 2021 mold test or provide a statement of inability to comply with the request. The court also orders the defendant to pay sanctions in the amount of $1,717.60, which is the result of 3.8 hours of work by the plaintiff's expert at $452 per hour. The court notes that the parties have been in a dispute over the production of documents, with the defendant providing initial responses and then supplemental responses, but not producing the June 2021 mold test. The court finds that the defendant's delay in producing the test has caused unnecessary delay and expense to the plaintiff, and therefore grants the motion for monetary sanctions. However, the court declines to triple the monetary sanctions as requested by the plaintiff, as there is no authority to support this request. The court also finds that issue and evidentiary sanctions are not warranted at this stage.
