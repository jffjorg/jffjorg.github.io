And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is that the demurrer to the First Amended Cross-Complaint is overruled. The Court finds that the allegations in the Cross-Complaint state a cause of action for Fraud and Negligent Misrepresentation. The Court rejects the arguments of Cross-Defendants Beverly Hills Tower and Shawn Far that the Cross-Complainants did not plead enough facts to show reasonable reliance and that the claims are based on a prediction about future events. The Court also rejects the argument that the fraud claims fail because they are based on the legal opinion of a lay person. The Court finds that the allegations in the Cross-Complaint show that Cross-Defendants knew of the outdoor space's limitations but concealed this information, and that Cross-Complainants relied on Cross-Defendants' representations and suffered losses as a result.
