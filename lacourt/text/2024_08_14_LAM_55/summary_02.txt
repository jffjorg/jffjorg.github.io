And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is to continue the order to show cause (OSC) regarding contempt for violating a court order. The OSC was filed by the plaintiff, Queen Esther Square, LP, against Defendant Ken Trimmer, who was granted summary judgment against him on August 9, 2023. The court ordered Defendant Ken Trimmer to deliver certain property to the levying officer, but he failed to do so. The plaintiff filed an ex parte application for an OSC Re: Contempt and Sanctions, which was served on Defendant Ken Trimmer electronically, but no proof of personal service was filed. Therefore, the OSC Re: Contempt is continued to allow the plaintiff to personally serve the defendant with notice of the order to show cause. The judge notes that a contempt proceeding is punitive and separate from the underlying cause of action, and that every detail must be carefully considered.
