And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by counsel for the plaintiff, Richard Pallack, to be relieved as attorney of record in a legal malpractice case against the McCune Law Group, Richard D. McCunn, and Joshua A. Genzuk. The motion is granted, and the judge will sign the order submitted by counsel. The judge notes that the determination to grant or deny such a motion lies within the sound discretion of the trial court, taking into account whether the withdrawal might work an injustice in the handling of the case. The judge finds that the moving counsel has demonstrated a cognizable ground for withdrawal, citing client conduct that renders it unreasonably difficult to carry out the representation effectively. The plaintiff's opposition argues that relieving his attorney will cause him prejudice, but the judge disagrees, finding that the case is not yet at issue and the plaintiff has ample time to obtain new counsel. The judge will continue the case management conference (CMC) for 90 days to a date that works with the plaintiff's schedule.
