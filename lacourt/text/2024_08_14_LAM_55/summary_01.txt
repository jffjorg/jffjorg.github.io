And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the defendant's motion for terminating sanctions, which was based on the plaintiff's alleged failure to comply with court orders to pay monetary sanctions. The court found that the motion was moot because the plaintiff had paid the sanctions and there was no dispute about this fact. Additionally, the court held that a court may not issue a terminating sanction for failure to pay a monetary discovery sanction, as this would be an abuse of discretion.

The court also denied the defendant's motion to hold the plaintiff and her counsel in contempt for their failure to pay the sanctions. The court found that the proper procedure for seeking contempt was not followed, and that the plaintiff had paid the sanctions. The court noted that contempt would not be proper in this case because the issue was a failure to pay monetary sanctions, which does not tend to impede, embarrass, or obstruct the court's discharge of its duties. Instead, the defendant could have enforced the sanctions order as a money judgment through the execution of judgment laws.
