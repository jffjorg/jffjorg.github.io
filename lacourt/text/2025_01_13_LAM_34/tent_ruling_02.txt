             Defendants Daniel Hinman, Duc
Pham, Vincent Pham, and Verona Street Holdings, LLC have not filed their answer
to Plaintiffs’ TAC.


[2]
             The court notes that the
discovery responses from Seller Defendants were served to Plaintiffs after filing
their opposition. If after reviewing such responses Plaintiffs find evidence
that supports their burden to show that a triable issue of fact exists as to
any of their causes of action against Broker Defendants, Plaintiffs will be
allowed to submit such evidence for the court to review. Broker Defendants will
then have an opportunity to respond. However, if Plaintiffs have no other evidence
to present, the court will proceed with granting Broker Defendants’ motion for
the reasons discussed above.
