And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendants' motion to strike certain portions of the plaintiff's complaint. The defendants moved to strike paragraphs of the complaint that alleged "pain and suffering" and "emotional distress" damages, as well as allegations of "gross negligence". The judge found that the plaintiff's complaint did not adequately allege a basis for an award of general damages, as the injuries alleged were all economic in nature and lacked sufficient allegations of accompanying emotional distress or other non-economic losses. The judge also found that the plaintiff's complaint did not adequately state the amount of damages sought, as required by California Code of Civil Procedure section 425.10(a)(2). Finally, the judge granted the defendants' motion to strike the plaintiff's allegation of "gross negligence" as the complaint did not make sufficient allegations that the defendants' negligent conduct amounted to the degree of gross negligence. The court will inquire at the hearing whether leave to amend should be granted.
