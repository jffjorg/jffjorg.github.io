```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge notes that the defendants have not filed an answer to the complaint. The court has received discovery responses from the seller defendants, which were served after the plaintiffs filed their opposition. The judge gives the plaintiffs an opportunity to review these responses and submit any evidence that supports their claims against the broker defendants. If the plaintiffs find evidence that supports their claims, the broker defendants will have a chance to respond. However, if the plaintiffs have no other evidence to present, the court will grant the broker defendants' motion for the reasons discussed above.
