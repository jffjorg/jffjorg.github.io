And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the Plaintiff's motion for an order compelling compliance with the court's April 22, 2024 Order and requesting monetary sanctions. The Plaintiff, Aidee Jacqueline Tinoco Bucio, alleges that the Defendants, Khowsrow Benji and Anna Benji, have failed to provide full discovery responses despite a stipulation and order requiring them to do so.

The judge finds that while the Defendants have provided some discovery responses, they have been excessively dilatory in responding to the requests. The judge awards sanctions in the amount of $1,940.00 to the Plaintiff's counsel, which includes $375.00 per hour for 5.0 total hours of work.

The judge grants the Plaintiff's motion for monetary sanctions and orders the Defendants and their counsel to pay the sum of $1,940.00 to the Plaintiff's counsel within 30 days. The judge declines to impose sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure sections 177.5, as the discovery sanctions are specifically tailored to discovery disputes.
