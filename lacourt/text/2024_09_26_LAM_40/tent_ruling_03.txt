  6552]

I. Background
Plaintiffs Eduardo Rodolfo Rojas
Esquivel (Esquivel), Jose Carlos Garcia Herrera (Herrera), and Jose Eduardo
Flores Jimenez (Jimenez), (collectively Plaintiffs), sue Defendant Belmont
Enterprises, LLC (Belmont) and Does 1 through 10, pursuant to a February 14,
2024 Complaint alleging causes of action for: (1) Breach of Warranty of
Habitability; (2) Breach of Warranty of Quiet Enjoyment; (3) Nuisance; (4)
Violations of Civil Code Section 1941.1 et. seq.; and (5) Negligence. 
The claims arise from allegations
that Belmont owns/manages the property located at 560 Gladys Avenue in Los
Angeles, California. The Plaintiffs allege that throughout their tenancy,
Belmont failed to adequately maintain the property, leading to substandard living
conditions and habitability issues, resulting in injury to the Plaintiffs. 
On May 7, 2024, Plaintiffs Esquivel
and Jimenez propounded Form Interrogatories Set One (FROGs), Special
Interrogatories Set One (SROGs), and Request for Production of Documents (RFPs)
on Belmont. 
On August 9, 2024, Plaintiff
Esquivel filed (1) a motion to compel responses to FROGs Set One and SROGs Set
One and for monetary sanctions against Belmont
Enterprises and its counsel in the amount of $2,000, and (2) a motion to
compel responses to RFPs and for monetary sanctions against Belmont Enterprises
and its counsel in the amount of $1,200. 
The same day, Plaintiff Jimenez
also filed (1) a motion to compel responses to FROGs Set One and SROGs Set One
and for monetary sanctions against Belmont Enterprises and its counsel in the
amount of $2,000, and (2) a motion to compel responses to RFPs and for monetary
sanctions against Belmont Enterprises and its counsel in the amount of $1,200. 
            Belmont has
not replied to any of the motions, despite facially valid proofs of service
attached to the motions.
 
II. Motion to Compel
A. Legal Standard
A motion to compel an initial
response can be made on the ground that a party did not serve a timely response
to interrogatories or a demand to produce. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd.
(a) [interrogatories], 2031.300, subd. (a) [demand to produce]; see Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 404 (Sinaiko).) To establish this ground, a movant must
show: 
(1) Proper service (see Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 2030.080, subd. (a) [interrogatories], 2031.040 [demand to
produce]); 
(2) Expiration of the deadline for
the initial response 30 days after service or on date agreed to by parties (see
Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.260, subds. (a), (b) [interrogatories], 2031.260,
subds. (a), (b) [demand to produce]); and 
(3) No timely response (see Code
Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290 [interrogatories], 2031.300 [demand to produce]).
The Court retains jurisdiction to
rule on the merits of discovery motions even after requested discovery was
provided after the motion was filed. (Sinaiko, supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at
p. 409.) 
B. Analysis
Here, the motions were properly
served on Belmont on May 7, 2024. (All Motions, Agge Decl., Exs. A-B.) The
parties agreed to a discovery deadline of August 1, 2024. (All Motions, Agge
Decl., Ex. C [email correspondence between parties agreeing to extend June 7
deadline to June 20, then July 11, then July 21, then August 1, 2024.].) 
As of the date of the hearings on
these motions, there is no evidence before the Court that Belmont has served the
requested discovery responses.  
Accordingly, Plaintiff Esquivel’s
motion to compel discovery responses (FROGs,
Set One and SROGs, Set One) is GRANTED. 
Plaintiff Esquivel’s motion to compel discovery responses
(Production of Documents) is GRANTED. 
Plaintiff Jimenez’s motion to compel discovery responses (Production of Documents)
is GRANTED. 
 
III. Sanctions 
A. Legal Standard
The Court must impose monetary
sanctions against anyone—party, nonparty, or attorney—who unsuccessfully makes
or opposes the motion, unless it finds that the person to be sanctioned acted
with substantial justification or other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanctions unjust. (See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (c)
[interrogatories], 2031.300, subd. (c) [demand to produce]; see Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants, supra,
148 Cal.App.4th at p. 404 [interrogatories and demand to produce].) 
The court may award sanctions under
the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery,
even though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion
was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party
after the motion was filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1348, subd. (a).)
Even after a party provides
discovery responses, a party can keep its motion on calendar and the court has
authority to grant sanctions, even if it denies the motion to compel responses
“as essentially unnecessary, in whole or in part.” (Sinaiko, supra, at
p. 409.)
B. Analysis
Plaintiff Esquivel request
sanctions for the motion to compel
discovery responses (FROGs, Set One and SROGs, Set One) [RES ID # 6552] against
Defendant, Belmont Enterprises, LLC and his counsel, Jonathan Deer, in the total amount of $2,000.00 based upon
counsel’s rate of $400.00/hour for 5.0 total hours of work as follows: (1) 4.0
hours to prepare, research, and review this motion, (2) 0.5 hours for the
hearing, (3) and 0.5 hours to travel to and from court for the hearing. 
The request for sanctions is GRANTED in the total amount of $2,000.00. 
Plaintiff Esquivel request
sanctions for the motion to compel
discovery responses (Production of Documents) [RES ID # 2233] against Defendant,
Belmont Enterprises, LLC and his counsel, Jonathan Deer, in the total amount of $1,200.00 based upon counsel’s rate of
$400.00/hour for 3.0 total hours of work as follows: (1) 2.0 hours to prepare,
research, and review this motion, (2) 0.5 hours for the hearing, (3) and 0.5
hours to travel to and from court for the hearing. 
The request for sanctions is GRANTED in the total amount of $1,200.00. 
Plaintiff Jimenez request sanctions
for the motion to compel discovery
responses (Production of Documents) [RES ID # 1650] against Defendant,
Belmont Enterprises, LLC and his counsel, Jonathan Deer, in the total amount of $1,200.00 based upon counsel’s rate of
$400.00/hour for 3.0 total hours of work as follows: (1) 2.0 hours to prepare,
research, and review this motion, (2) 0.5 hours for the hearing, (3) and 0.5
hours to travel to and from court for the hearing. 
As this hearing is set for the same day and time as the hearing for
Plaintiff Esquivel’s motion to compel discovery responses for production of
documents, the 0.5 hours for the hearing and 0.5 hours to travel to and from
the court for the hearing are duplicative. 
The request for sanctions is GRANTED in the reduced amount of $800.00. 
 
IV. Conclusion
The Motion to Compel Discovery
Responses (Form Interrogatories and Special Interrogatories) [RES ID # 6552] is GRANTED. Defendant is ordered
to serve fully compliant responses without objections within 20 days. The
request for sanctions is GRANTED in the amount of $2,000.00
