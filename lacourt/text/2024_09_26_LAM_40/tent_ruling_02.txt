I. Background
A. Pleadings
On January 16, 2024, Plaintiff
Aidee Jacqueline Tinoco Bucio filed the operative First Amended Complaint (FAC)
against Defendants Khowsrow Benji, Anna Benji, and DOES 1 through 100,
inclusive. The FAC asserts twenty-one (21) causes of action against all Defendants
concerning FEHA violations, assault, battery, Labor Code violations, and
wrongful termination. 
This action involves Plaintiff’s
employment with the Defendants around December 22, 2020 until May 3, 2023.
Plaintiff alleges she worked as the Defendants’ housekeeper before she was
constructively terminated. Plaintiff alleges Mr. Benji consistently sexually
harassed, assaulted, and battered her. 
On February 26, 2024, Mr. Benji
filed a Cross-Complaint against Plaintiff for the following causes of action:
1) Negligence; 2) Assault; 3) Battery; 4) Intentional Infliction of Emotional
Distress; and 5) Physical Elder Abuse.
B. Relevant Procedural History
As detailed in the Declaration of
Plaintiff’s attorney Navid Barahmand in support of the motion, Plaintiff filed
numerous motions to compel further responses against the Defendants including:
(i) Plaintiff’s Requests for Production of Documents to Defendant Khowsrow
Benji, number 36; (ii) Plaintiff’s Requests for Production of Documents to
Defendant Anna Benji, numbers 4, 5, 7, 8, 15, 16, 17, 23, 25, 28, 30, 31, 33,
36, 43, and 44; and (iii) Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatories, General to
Defendant Khosrow Benji, numbers 2.6. 
After an Informal Discovery
Conference, the parties agreed that Plaintiff would withdraw her motions in
exchange for receiving the further responses. This became an order of the Court
on April 22, 2024. Responses were due in conformity with the stipulation and
order on May 3, 2024. On May 3rd, Plaintiff received only objections without
substantive responses. On May 7th, the Defendants provided substantive
responses to some of the discovery requests, but not to others. 
On May 7, 2024, Defendants served
their verified supplemental responses to Plaintiff’s form interrogatories –
general and employment law, set one. (Kroll Decl., ¶ 9; Exhibits 1-4 [Defs.
Suppl. Resp. to Plf. Form Interrogatories].) 
On May 13, 2024, Defendants served
their respective verified supplemental responses to Plaintiff’s request for
production, set one and supplemental document production bates labeled
BEN000039 to 00136. (Kroll Decl., ¶ 10; Exhibits 5-6 [Defs. Suppl. Resp. to
Plf. Req. for Prod.].)
On May 13, Plaintiff filed a motion
to compel compliance with the prior court orders. The Court heard the motion
and awarded sanctions against Defendants and Defendants counsel. (Minute Order,
July 25, 2024)
On August 7, the parties met and
conferred regarding the outstanding discovery requests. 
The parties continued to correspond
regarding the discovery requests throughout August. (Barahmand Decl. ¶¶ 11-13;
Exs. G, H, I; Kroll Decl. ¶ 11.) Plaintiff contends that as of the filing of
this motion, Defendants have still not produced all the verified discovery responses
or related documents. 
C. Motion Before the Court
On August 20, 2024, Plaintiff filed
the instant motion for (1) an order enforcing the Court’s April 22, 2024 Order,
(2) $1,500.00 in sanctions against Defendants and Defendants counsel pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure section 177.5, and (3) $1,940.00 in sanctions
against Defendants and Defendants counsel pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
2023.030
On September 13, 2024, Defendants
opposed the motion, arguing that Defendants have substantially complied with
the parties’ joint stipulation and provided the requested supplemental
responses and documents in so far as they exist. (Kroll Decl. ¶¶ 9-10, Exs. 6.)
 
 
II. Motion
A. Legal Standard
Code of Civil Procedure section
177.5 provides that “A judicial officer shall have the power to impose
reasonable money sanctions, not to exceed fifteen hundred dollars ($1,500),
notwithstanding any other provision of law, payable to the court, for any
violation of a lawful court order by a person, done without good cause or
substantial justification. This power shall not apply to advocacy of counsel
before the court. For the purposes of this section, the term “person” includes
a witness, a party, a party’s attorney, or both. Sanctions pursuant to
this section shall not be imposed except on notice contained in a party’s
moving or responding papers; or on the court’s own motion, after notice and
opportunity to be heard. An order imposing sanctions shall be in writing and
shall recite in detail the conduct or circumstances justifying the order.”
Code of Civil Procedure section
2023.030 permits California courts to impose issue or evidence sanctions for
discovery misuses, which are defined by section 2023.010 of the Code of Civil
Procedure. (See Peat, Marwick, Mitchell & Co. v. Superior Court
(1988) 200 Cal.App.3d 272, 288 [The court’s inherent power to curb abuses and
promote fair process extends to the preclusion of evidence].) 
B. Analysis
Upon review, it appears the Defendants
have substantially complied with the discovery requests and provided responsive
documents, to the extent that they exist, as well as verified supplemental responses
to the extent they were called for by the Order. Although Plaintiff asserts
that Defendants have not filed all of the verified supplemental discovery
requests they were obligated to serve, they do not specify any information that
is still lacking. However, Defendants have been exceedingly dilatory in
responding to the requests, particularly given that the parties stipulated that
conforming responses were due by May 3, 2024 and a total of 8 months has
transpired since the discovery requests were served. 
Plaintiff requests monetary
sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure sections 177.5 and 2023.030 (Notice of Motion).

Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 2023.030, Plaintiff’s counsel requests sanctions in the total amount of
$1,940.00 based upon counsel’s rate of $375.00/hour for 5.0 total hours of work
as follows: (1) 3.0 hours to draft this motion, declarations, and exhibits, (2)
2.0 hours to prepare a reply and appear at the hearing, and (3) $65.00 for the
cost of bringing forth this motion. 
 The hourly rate of $375 is reasonable, thus,
the Court will award sanctions in the amount of $1,940.00.The Court declines to impose sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure sections 177.5, as the discovery
sanctions are specifically tailored to discovery disputes and the Court declines
to issue supplemental sanctions.
Finally, to the extent that
Plaintiff contends there are related cases, as detailed in the Reply
Declaration of Navid Barahmand, counsel is required to follow the procedures
outlined in California Rules of Court, rule 3.300 to bring them to the attention
of all the courts in which such pending cases have been filed so that appropriate
rulings can be made. No such notice of related case appears in this case. 
III. Conclusion
            Based on
the foregoing, Plaintiff Aidee Jacqueline Tinoco Bucio’s motion requesting monetary
sanctions is GRANTED in the amount of $1,940.00.
Defendants and their counsel are
jointly and severally ordered to pay such sum within 30 days to Plaintiff’s
counsel.
