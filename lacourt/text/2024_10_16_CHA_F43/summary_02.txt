And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to set aside the default entered against him. The defendant, Ashot Mkhitaryan, claims that he did not receive notice of the lawsuit due to construction on his residence, and that the papers were served on construction workers who were working on his home. The judge found that the defendant had met the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure Section 473(b) and that the law favors hearings on the merits. The judge also noted that the defendant had filed his motion to set aside default within the six-month timeframe contemplated by CCP Section 473(b) and that it was accompanied by his proposed motion to strike. As a result, the judge granted the defendant's motion to set aside and vacate the entry of default.
