```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The Court has denied Defendant Kyle Perez's petition to compel arbitration and stay the action. The petition was filed on July 26, 2024, and the Court found that Perez did not prove that the arbitration agreement would apply to him. The agreement, which was attached to Perez's motion, only mentions disputes between the "Resident and Facility" and does not make any mention of disputes between the Resident and individual employees of the Facility. Perez was an employee of White House Recovery LLC, and the Court found that he had waived the issue of whether he could enforce the agreement as a non-signatory third party or beneficiary. Therefore, the Court denied Perez's petition to compel arbitration and stay the action.
