Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by Cross-Defendant T.C. against the cross-complaint filed by William S. Hart Union High School District. The court has taken judicial notice of the filed complaint, cross-complaint, and answer, but has not considered the facts alleged in the complaint.

The court has found that the demurrer lacks authority and is therefore off-calendar pending resolution of the guardian ad litem appointment. The court has also declined to consider the merits of each and every individual cause of action in the operative complaint relative to a determination of a valid indemnity claim.

Regarding the motion to strike, the court has found that it is either off-calendar or moot, as the court granted the motion to strike the claim for attorney fees without prejudice on August 19, 2024, and the district elected not to file a first amended cross-complaint.

The court will concurrently conduct a Case Management Conference and OSC re: Sanctions. Cross-Defendant T.C. is required to give notice.
