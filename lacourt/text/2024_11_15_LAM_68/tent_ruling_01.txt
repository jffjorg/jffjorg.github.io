SUMMARY
OF ACTION
On
November 21, 2023, Guadencio Yap filed a complaint for Fraud, Breach of
Fiduciary Duty, and Quantum Meruit. On February 5, 2024, Plaintiff filed a
verified derivative first amended complaint for Breach of Fiduciary Duty, Abuse
of Control, and Unjust Enrichment. On April 15, 2024, Co answered the verified
first amended complaint, and filed a cross-complaint against Yap for
Conversion, Violation of Penal Code section 496, Breach of Contract, Breach of
Fiduciary Duty, Unjust Enrichment, and Unfair Business Practices. 
 
RULING: Granted.
Defendant/Cross-Complainant,
Samuel Co moves to compel responses to Form Interrogatories (set one) and
Request for Production of Documents (set one) served on Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant,
Guadenico Yap. The court consolidates the separately filed motions into a
single order.
 
Defendant represents service of requests for production and
form interrogatories on April 16, 2024. [Declarations of David Shinder, ¶ 2,
Ex. A.] Plaintiff only provided untimely unverified responses with a promise to
produce on the document demand, and unverified deficient responses on the form
interrogatories. [Id., ¶ 6, Ex. C.]
 
The motions are unopposed. The court electronic filing
system shows no reply filed at the time of the tentative ruling publication
cutoff. Unverified responses constitute non-responses. The court otherwise
declines to determine any waiver of objections, the promise to produce, or the
merits of the responses, as any such determination requires actual verified
responses and a motion to compel further responses. The unopposed motions are
granted. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a-b), 2031.300, subd. (a-b).) Sanctions
in the amount of $1,250 imposed against defendant Guadencio Yap, joint and
several with counsel, and payable within 30 days. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2023.040,
2030.290, subd. (c), 2031.310, subd. (d).)
 
Demurrer
to the cross-complaint filed by Yap scheduled for February 5, 2025. Trial remains
set for February 24, 2025. 
 
Defendant to provide notice.
