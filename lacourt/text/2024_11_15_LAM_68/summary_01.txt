And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case 23STCV28508. The case involves Guadencio Yap as the Plaintiff and Samuel Co as the Defendant. Yap filed a complaint for Fraud, Breach of Fiduciary Duty, and Quantum Meruit, and later filed a verified derivative first amended complaint. Co answered and filed a cross-complaint against Yap.

The Defendant, Co, moves to compel responses to Form Interrogatories and Request for Production of Documents served on Yap. The Court grants the motion and imposes sanctions in the amount of $1,250 against Yap, joint and several with counsel, payable within 30 days.

The Court notes that Yap only provided untimely unverified responses to the document demand and unverified deficient responses to the Form Interrogatories. The Court declines to determine any waiver of objections, the promise to produce, or the merits of the responses, as any such determination requires actual verified responses and a motion to compel further responses.

The demurrer to the cross-complaint filed by Yap is scheduled for February 5, 2025, and the trial remains set for February 24, 2025.
