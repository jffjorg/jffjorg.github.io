Silverman v. Shokrian,
et al., Case No. 21CHLC37706
Hearing date 3/27/24
Counsel for Defendant
Shokrian & Calitex’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel (Atty. Stone)
 
Jason Stone,
counsel for defendants Shokrian and Calitex, brings a motion to be relieved as
counsel. The motion is unopposed.
 
The court has
discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw, and such a motion should be
granted provided that there is no prejudice to the client and it does not
disrupt the orderly process of justice. See Ramirez
v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915.
 
Counsel seeks
withdrawal based on a breakdown of the attorney client relationship (Stone
decl., para. 2). Counsel filed the mandatory forms and served Shokrian and
Calitex at the last known address by mail.
 
There is no
opposition filed. There is no trial scheduled, as cross-defendant Adli Law
Group is in bankruptcy, and the matter is stayed. There is no prejudice to
Shokrian and Calitex. GRANTED.
