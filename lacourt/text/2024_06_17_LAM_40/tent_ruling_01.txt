 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
Cross-Defendant
  Stallion, Inc.’s Motion to Deem Objections to Interrogatories to be Without
  Merit; to Compel Answers and for Sanctions Against Cross-Complainant and His
  Attorney [Res ID # 7130].



 
I. Background
On February 21, 2024, Cross-Defendant Stallion, Inc. (Stallion)
filed a motion to compel further responses to six interrogatory requests served
on Cross-Plaintiff Michael Pappas (Michael Pappas) around December 5, 2023 (hereafter, SROGs,
Set One, Nos. 1-6), to which Michael Pappas served objection-only responses on
January 8, 2024.
On May 31, 2024,
Michael Pappas filed an opposition. The opposition argues that this motion is
moot because Michael Pappas served supplemental responses to SROGs, Set One, Nos. 1-6 on May 29, 2024. A
review of the proof of service for the opposition shows that service was
effected on Stallion’s counsel at a P.O. box address, which is the same address
that appears in the proof of service attached to Stallion’s February 20, 2024,
motion, as well as its March 28, 2023, Answer to Cross-Complaint.
No reply appears in the
record.
Stallion’s motion is
now before the Court.
 
II. Motion to Compel Further
Interrogatory Responses and Motion for Sanctions

A. Motion to Compel Further
Interrogatory Responses: MOOT.
1. Legal
Standard
A motion to compel a further
response is used when a party gives unsatisfactory answers or makes untenable
objections to interrogatories, demands to produce, or requests for admission.
(See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300, subd. (a), 2031.310, subd. (a), 2033.290,
subd. (a); Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403 [interrogatories and demands to
produce].)
To compel a further response to
interrogatories, the movant can show that: (1) the responding party’s answer to
a particular interrogatory is evasive or incomplete (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.300, subd. (a)(1)); (2) the responding party’s exercise of the option to
produce documents in response to an interrogatory was unwarranted or the
required specification of those documents was inadequate (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.300, subd. (a)(2)); and (3) the responding party’s objection to an
interrogatory is without merit or too general (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300,
subd. (a)(3); see, e.g., Williams v. Superior Court (2017) 3 Cal.5th
531, 550 [defendant’s argument that plaintiff was required to establish good
cause or prove merits of underlying claim before propounding interrogatories
without merit]).
2. Analysis
“Whether a particular response does
resolve satisfactorily the issues raised by a motion is a matter best
determined by the trial court in the exercise of its discretion, based on the
circumstances of the case.” (Sinaiko, supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at
p. 409.)
Here, the Court determines that
Stallion’s motion is MOOT as to further responses.
Stallion served SROGs, Set One,
Nos. 1-6 on Michael Pappas around December 5, 2023, in response to which
Plaintiff served objection only responses. (Mot., Kalajian Decl., Exs. A, B.)
On May 29, 2024, Stallion served
supplemental responses to SROGs, Set One, Nos. 1-6. A review of these responses
shows statements that are Code-compliant. The supplemental responses to SROGS,
Nos. 1-5 are substantive “yes” or “no” answers to questions posed to elicit
such a response, as qualified by objections. The supplemental response to
SROGs, No. 6, contains more detailed information than the previous four
supplemental responses and is Code-compliant. (Opp’n, Abramson Decl., Ex. 1,
Supplemental Responses to SROGs, Set One, Nos. 1-6.)
Based on these responses, the Court
determines that Stallion’s motion is moot insofar as it seeks an order
compelling further responses to SROGs, Set One, Nos. 1-6.
B. Motion for Sanctions: GRANTED
in part.
1. Legal
Standard
The court must impose a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person,
or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a further
response to interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the
sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make
the imposition of the sanction unjust. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd.
(d).)
The court may award sanctions under the
Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even
though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was
withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after
the motion was filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1348, subd. (a).)
2. Analysis
The Court GRANTS sanctions in part
as follows.
There was a nearly five-month delay
between service of the initial January 8, 2024, objection-only responses and
service of the supplemental responses on May 29, 2024.
Michael Pappas’s opposition argues
and cites evidence for the contention that that the objection-only responses
were served in light of scheduling difficulties for counsel, which necessitated
a continuance that counsel for Stallion refused to accommodate. (Opp’n,
Abramson Decl., ¶¶ 3-6, 10, Exs. 2-4.)
Michael Pappas’s opposition also
details post-January 8, 2024, time conflicts arising from (1) the death of
Michael Pappas’s brother, where Michael Pappas was appointed executor in charge
of administering the estate, (2) the frequent travel of Michael Pappas, and (3)
the birth of counsel’s first grandchild in Arizona. The death of Michael
Pappas’s brother is stated as having occurred in January 2024, while the birth
of counsel’s grandchild is represented to have occurred in February 2024, with
the estate proceedings continuing in February 2024 as well. (Opp’n, Abramson
Decl., ¶¶ 11-12.)
However, the same evidence shows
that counsel for Stallion refused the extension request based on past
extensions resulting in purportedly inconsistent and evasive responses from
Michael Pappas and where the client, Stallion, did not wish to provide an extension.
(Opp’n, Abramson Decl., Ex. 4.)
The moving papers’ evidence, in
turn, references meet and confer emails between counsel on January 28, January
30, and February 2, 2024—efforts which are quoted into the declaration rather
than incorporated by attachment. Those efforts included Michael Pappas’s
counsel asking for more time to serve responses in relation to SROGs, Set One,
Nos. 1-6 and promising to serve responses twice by a certain date only to fail
to serve discovery by those dates. (Mot., Kalajian Decl., ¶¶ 8-11.)
Under these circumstances, the
Court relies on California Rule of Court, rule 3.1348(a) to determine that even
though supplemental responses were served, sanctions may still be imposed on
Michael Pappas and his counsel, John M. Kalajian.
The basis for sanctions is failing
to respond to an authorized method of discovery in SROGs, Set One, Nos. 1-6,
through May 29, 2024. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2023.010, subd. (d), 2023.030, subd.
(a), 2031.310, subd. (h).)
The amount requested in sanctions
is reasonable—though the Court reduces the amount below. Counsel’s declaration
shows experience and skill supporting the modest $400 per hour fee rate. The
declaration sets out a ceiling of $1,600 in monetary sanctions, connoting four
hours of work by counsel on this motion and on the hearing, which is
reasonable. Last, the $60 motion fee is reasonable.
As to joint and several sanctions,
the Court orders sanctions be paid jointly and severally by counsel. While the
Court understands that estate and family matters conflicted with supplemental
responses in January and February 2024, supplemental responses were not served
until May 29, 2024, well beyond January and February 2024. (Opp’n, Abramson
Decl., ¶¶ 10-15.) It is unclear why this delay took place, but the evidence
attached to the moving papers represents that Michael Pappas’s counsel agreed
to serve supplemental responses following service of the January 8, 2024,
objections only to twice fail to serve those responses. (Mot., Kalajian Decl.,
¶¶ 8-11.) Under these circumstances, sanctions against Michael Pappas and
counsel appear appropriate.
However, the Court, in the
interests of justice, reduces the sanctions amount to $860 as opposed to the
requested $1,660, splitting the $1,600 requested in pure sanctions between the
parties to balance the emergencies that arose in relation to Michael Pappas and
counsel.
Sanctions are thus GRANTED, in
part, as against Michael Pappas and counsel, Joe R. Abramson, Esq. (SBN
105241), jointly and severally.
