And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling addresses the motion to compel further responses to interrogatories and the motion for sanctions. The Judge finds that the motion to compel is moot as supplemental responses were served on May 29, 2024. However, the Judge grants the motion for sanctions in part against Michael Pappas and counsel, Joe R. Abramson, Esq., in the amount of $860, to be paid jointly and severally. The Judge reduces the amount of sanctions from the requested $1,660 to balance the emergencies that arose in relation to Michael Pappas and counsel. The Judge orders the parties to remit the sanctions within 14 days of the order.
