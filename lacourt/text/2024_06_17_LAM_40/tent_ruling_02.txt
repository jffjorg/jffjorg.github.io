 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
Plaintiffs’ Motion
  to Compel Further Responses to Plaintiffs’ Request for Production of
  Documents, Set Two [Res ID # 6659].



 
I. Background
On January 23, 2024, Plaintiffs
Gerardo Monroy and Patricia Mascorro Monroy served Requests for Production of
Documents (RPDs), Set Two, on Defendant American Honda Motor Co. (Honda).
On February 26, 2024, Honda served
responses to RPDs, Set Two.
On April 10, 2024, Plaintiffs filed
a motion for an order compelling further production from Honda in relation to
RPDs, Set Two, Nos. 10, 14, 23, 24, 33, 37, 46, 47, 56, 60, 69, 70, 79, 83, 92,
and 93. A facially valid proof of service is attached to the motion.
No opposition, reply, or notice of
non-opposition appear in the record.
 
II. Motion to Compel Further Production: DENIED.
After review, the Court DENIES
Plaintiff’s motion.
A motion to compel a further
response is used when a party gives unsatisfactory answers or makes untenable
objections to demands to produce. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a).) The
movant must establish good cause, as well as, for example, that a response is
evasive or that a stated objection lacks merit. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310,
subds. (a)(2)-(3), (b)(1).)
Here, no relief is warranted. As
shown by Plaintiffs’ separate statement, all 16 of Honda’s challenged responses
involve initial responses with objections and a statement of inability to
comply because the documents at issue never existed. The Court’s review of
those nearly identical statements shows that they comply with Code of Civil
Procedure section 2031.230 because the statements identify an ability to comply
after a reasonable and diligent search and further give the reason why no
documents can be produced: The requested documents never existed. To the extent
that Plaintiffs’ separate statement challenges Honda’s section 2031.230
statements of inability to comply, the Court is unconvinced Honda’s statements
of inability to comply are defective or other than Code compliant.
 
III. Conclusion
Plaintiffs’ Motion to Compel Further Responses to Plaintiffs’ Request for
Production of Documents, Set Two [Res ID # 6659] is DENIED.
