BACKGROUND
This is a wage and
hour class action. Defendants Charles E. Thomas Company, Inc. is full ­­service
general engineering contractor in the city of Gardena, CA, employing
individuals to perform construction jobs for various retail and commercial
businesses in California, namely gas stations.
Plaintiff filed a
class action complaint against Defendant on December 2, 2022, which alleges
class wide causes of action for: (1) minimum wage violations (2) failure to pay
all overtime wages; (3) meal period violations; (4) rest period violations; (5)
waiting time penalties; (6) wage statement violations; and (7) unfair
competition.  On March 14, 2023,
Plaintiff amended his complaint as a matter of right pursuant to Labor Code
Section 2699.3(a)(2)(c) to add an additional cause of action (8) for civil penalties
under the Private Attorneys General Act pursuant to Labor Code Sections 2698 et
seq. 
Plaintiff filed a Second
Amended Complaint on September 7, 2023, to redefine the class definition from
all current and former non-exempt employees of Defendants to only those
non-exempt employees who worked in the positions of: (i) Construction
Technician; (ii) Service Technician; (iii) Construction Technician Trainee;
(iv) Service Technician Trainee; and/or (v) Superintendent (if such
Superintendent was paid on an hourly basis).
Counsel represent
that prior to mediation, Defendant informally produced all relevant time and
pay records as well as its wage and hour policies and other documents and
information relevant to the claims alleged in advance of mediation. Counsel
represents that they transmitted Defendant’s mediation production to expert,
Bennett Berger, a Partner and Senior Data Analyst at Berger Consulting Group to
perform a damages analysis.  
On May 3, 2023, a full-day
in-person mediation was held with the Hon. Leo Wagner (ret.), where the Parties
ultimately accepted a mediator’s proposal for a class and representative wide
settlement. A fully executed copy of the Settlement Agreement was filed with
the Court on July 25, 2023, attached to the Declaration of Daniel J. Brown, (“Brown
Decl.”) in Support of Preliminary Approval (“ISO Prelim”), as Exhibit 1. 
Preliminary approval
was granted on September 6, 2023. Notice was given to the Class Members as
ordered (see Declaration of Madely Nava (“Nava Decl.”).) Now before the Court
is the Motion for Final Approval of the proposed class action settlement. 
 
SETTLEMENT CLASS DEFINITION
·      
“Class” means all non-exempt employees who worked
for Defendant at any time during the Class Period and held the job title of:
(i) Construction Technician; (ii) Service Technician; (iii) Construction
Technician Trainee; (iv) Service Technician Trainee; and/or (v) Superintendent
(if such Superintendent was paid on an hourly basis). (¶1.5)
o   “Class Period” means the period from December 2, 2018
to November 1, 2023. (¶1.12)
·       “Aggrieved Employee” means all non-exempt employees
who worked for Defendant at any time during the PAGA Period and held the job
title of: (i) Construction Technician; (ii) Service Technician; (iii)
Construction Technician Trainee; (iv) Service Technician Trainee; and/or (v)
Superintendent (if such Superintendent was paid on an hourly basis). (¶1.4)
o   “PAGA Period” means the period from December 2, 2021
to November 1, 2023.  (¶1.31) 
·       Based on a review of its records to date, Defendant
estimates there are 62 Class Members who collectively worked a total of 7,450
Workweeks, and 40 Aggrieved Employees who worked a total of 1,450 PAGA Pay
Periods.  (¶4.1)
·       This Settlement Agreement is based on an estimated
total of 7,450 Workweeks for the Class Period. If the actual number of
Workweeks for the Class Period exceeds 8,195 (representing an increase of 745,
or 10%, over the 7,450 estimate), then the Gross Settlement Amount shall
automatically increase by $48 for each Workweek that exceeds 8,195. Because the
amount of $25,000 allocated to PAGA Penalties is based on a reasonable
compromise under Labor Code section 2699(l)(2), there shall be no adjustment to
the LWDA PAGA Payment or Individual PAGA Payments. (¶8) 
o   At Final Approval, the Administrator declares that Settlement
Class Members have worked a collective total of seven thousand nine hundred
thirty (7,930) Eligible Workweeks during the Class Period. (Nava Decl., ¶10.)
Therefore, the escalator was not triggered. 
·       The parties stipulate to class certification for settlement
purposes only. (¶12.1.)
 
TERMS OF SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT
The
essential terms are as follows:
·       The Gross Settlement Amount (“GSA”) is $357,600, non-reversionary.
(¶3.1)
·       The Net Settlement Amount (“Net”) ($186,751) is
the GSA minus the following:
o   Up to $119,200 (33
1/3%) for attorney fees (¶3.2.2); 
§  Fee split: 80% to Stansbury Brown Law, PC (“SBL”) and 20%
to Panitz Law Group (“PLG”). (Cruz Decl., ¶7.)
o   Up to $18,000 for litigation costs (Ibid.); 
o   Up to $10,000 for a Service Payment to the
Named Plaintiff (¶3.2.1);
o   Up to $4,899 for settlement administration
costs (¶3.2.3); and
o   Payment of $18,750 (75% of $25,000 PAGA penalty)
to the LWDA. (¶3.2.5)
·       Defendants will pay their share of taxes seperate from
the GSA. (¶3.1)
·       Funding of Settlement: Defendant shall fully
fund the Gross Settlement Amount, and also fund the amounts necessary to fully
pay Defendant’s share of payroll taxes by transmitting the funds to the
Administrator no later than 30 days after the Effective Date.  (¶4.3) 
·       There is no claim form requirement. (¶3.1)
·      
Individual Settlement Payment Calculation:  An Individual Class Payment calculated by (a)
dividing the Net Settlement Amount by the total number of Workweeks worked by
all Participating Class Members during the Class Period and (b) multiplying the
result by each Participating Class Member’s Workweeks.  (¶3.2.4)
o   Tax Allocation: 20% as wages and 80% as interest and penalties.
(¶3.2.4.1) 
·       PAGA Payments: The Administrator will calculate each
Individual PAGA Payment by (a) dividing the amount of the Aggrieved Employees’
25% share of PAGA Penalties ($6,250.00) by the total number of PAGA Period Pay
Periods worked by all Aggrieved Employees during the PAGA Period and (b)
multiplying the result by each Aggrieved Employee’s PAGA Period Pay Periods.
Aggrieved Employees assume full responsibility and liability for any taxes owed
on their Individual PAGA Payment.  (¶3.2.5.1.)

·       “Response Deadline” means 60
days after the Administrator mails Notice to Class Members and Aggrieved
Employees, and shall be the last date on which Class Members may: (a) fax,
email or mail Requests for Exclusion from the Settlement, or (b) fax, email or
mail his, her, or their Objection to the Settlement. Class Members to whom
Notice Packets are resent after having been returned undeliverable to the
Administrator shall have an additional 14 calendar days beyond the Response
Deadline has expired. (¶1.43) The same deadline and extension applies to
challenges to the number of Class Workweeks and PAGA Pay Periods. (¶7.6)
o   If the number of valid
Requests for Exclusion identified in the Exclusion List exceeds 10% of the
total of all Class Members, Defendant may, but is not obligated to, elect to
withdraw from the Settlement. (¶9) 
·       Uncashed Settlement Checks: For any Class Member whose
Individual Class Payment check or Individual PAGA Payment check is uncashed and
cancelled after the void date, the Administrator shall transmit the funds
represented by such checks to the California Controller’s Unclaimed Property
Fund in the name of the Class Member thereby leaving no “unpaid residue”
subject to the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 384, subdivision
(b). (¶4.4.3)
·       The settlement administrator will be Apex Class Action LLC.
(¶1.2)

ANALYSIS OF SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT
 
A.    
Does a presumption of fairness
exist? 

The
Court preliminarily found in its Order of September 6, 2023, that the
presumption of fairness should be applied. 
No facts have come to the Court’s attention that would alter that
preliminary conclusion.  Accordingly, the
settlement is entitled to a presumption of fairness as set forth in the
preliminary approval order.
 
B.    
Is the settlement fair, adequate,
and reasonable?
The
settlement was preliminarily found to be fair, adequate and reasonable.  Notice has now been given to the Class and
the LWDA.  
 
  Reaction of the class members to the
proposed settlement. 
Number of class members: 66 (Nava
Decl. ¶3.)
Number of notice packets mailed: 66
(Id. at ¶5.) 
Number of undeliverable notices: 0
(Id. at ¶6.) 
Number of opt-outs: 0 (Id. at ¶7.)
Number of objections: 0 (Id. at ¶8.)
Number of participating class
members: 66 (Id. at ¶10.)
Average individual payment: $2,767.53
(Id. at ¶12.)
Highest individual payment: $5,781.44
(Ibid.)
Number of Aggrieved Employees: 44
(Id. at ¶14.)
Average individual payment: $142.05
(Ibid.)
Highest individual payment: $212.09
(Ibid.)
 
The Court finds that the notice was given as
directed and conforms to due process requirements.  Given the reactions of the Class Members and
the LWDA to the proposed settlement and for the reasons set for in the Preliminary
Approval order, the settlement is found to be fair, adequate, and reasonable.
 
C.    
Attorney Fees and Costs
            Class Counsel requests an award of $119,200 in fees and $15,844.20 in costs. (MFA at 13:27-14:1, 17:7-8.) The
Settlement Agreement provides for up to $119,200 (33 1/3%) of the settlement amount in fees and $18,000 in
costs (¶3.2.2). 
“Courts
recognize two methods for calculating attorney fees in civil class actions: the
lodestar/multiplier method and the percentage of recovery method.”  (Wershba
v. Apple Computer, Inc. (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 224, 254.)  Here, class counsel
request attorney fees using the percentage method, as crosschecked by lodestar.
(MFA at pp. 13-17.) 
In
common fund cases, the Court may employ a percentage of the benefit method, as
cross-checked against the lodestar. (Laffitte
v. Robert Half Int’l, Inc. (2016) 1 Cal.5th 480, 503.) The fee request represents approximately
one-third of the gross settlement amount, which is the average generally
awarded in class actions.  (See In re Consumer Privacy Cases (2009) 175
Cal.App.4th 545, 558, fn. 13 [“Empirical studies show that, regardless whether
the percentage method or the lodestar method is used, fee awards in class
actions average around one-third of the recovery.”].) 
Class
Counsel has provided information, summarized below, from which the lodestar may
be calculated:



Attorney


Rate


Hours


Totals




Daniel J. Brown


$777


72.6


$56,410.20




Ethan C. Surls


$538


126.4


$68,003.20




Totals


 


 


$124,413.40



(Decl. of Daniel J. Brown
ISO Final ¶20, Exhibit C; Decl. of Ethan C. Surls ISO Final, ¶7.)
Counsel’s
percentage-based fee request is lower than the unadjusted lodestar and would
represent application of a negative multiplier of approximately 0.95.
Fee
split: 80% to Stansbury Brown Law, PC (“SBL”) and 20% to Panitz Law Group
(“PLG”). (Cruz Decl., ¶7.)
Here,
the $119,200 (33 1/3%) fee request
represents a reasonable percentage of the total funds paid by Defendant. Notice
of the fee request was provided to class members in the Notice, and none objected.
(Nava Decl.
¶8, Exhibit A thereto.)
 

            As for costs, Class Counsel is requesting a cost amount
of $15,844.20. This is less than the $18,000 cap estimated at preliminary
approval, which was disclosed to Class Members and not objected to. (Nava Decl. ¶8, Exhibit A thereto.) Costs include, but are not limited to:
Mediation ($8,775), Filing Fees ($1,730.26), and Expert Data Analysis[1] ($4,320). (Brown Decl. ISO
Final ¶18, Exhibit E thereto.) The costs appear to be reasonable in amount and
reasonably necessary to this litigation. 
 
Based
on the above, the Court awards $119,200 (33 1/3%) in fees and $15,844.20
in costs.
 
D.   
Incentive Award
The
class representative, Christian Cruz, seeks an enhancement payment of $10,000
for his contributions to the action. (MFA at pp. 18-19.)  
In
connection with the final fairness hearing, named Plaintiffs must submit
declarations attesting to why they should be entitled to an enhancement award
in the proposed amount.  The named
Plaintiffs must explain why they “should be compensated for the expense or risk
he has incurred in conferring a benefit on other members of the class.”  (Clark v. American Residential Services LLC
(2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 785, 806.)  Trial
courts should not sanction enhancement awards of thousands of dollars with
“nothing more than pro forma claims as to ‘countless’ hours expended, ‘potential stigma’ and ‘potential risk.’
Significantly more specificity, in the form of quantification of time and
effort expended on the litigation, and in the form of reasoned explanation of
financial or other risks incurred by the named plaintiffs, is required in order
for the trial court to conclude that an enhancement was ‘necessary to induce
[the named plaintiff] to participate in the suit . . . .’”  (Id.
at 806-807, italics and ellipsis in original.)
Plaintiff
represents that his contributions to this litigation include: engaging in phone
calls with his attorneys, discussing Defendant’s wage and hour policies, gathering
and reviewing employment and non-employment related documents for use in the
lawsuit, contacting numerous other class members, and coordinating obtaining other
class members’ Declarations. (Declaration
of Christian Cruz, ¶¶4-6 [attached as Exhibit G to the Brown Decl. ISO Final].) 
Plaintiff’s efforts are commendable, but not
exceptional. Based on the above, as well as the benefits obtained on behalf of
the class, the Court grants the enhancement payment in the reduced amount of $7,500 to
Plaintiff. 
 
E.     Settlement Administration Costs
            The
settlement administrator, Apex Class Action, LLC, is requesting $4,899 for
the costs of settlement administration. (Nava
Decl. ¶15.) This equals the cost of $4,899
provided for in the Settlement Agreement (¶3.2.3) and disclosed to
class members in the Notice, to which there were no objections. (Nava
Decl. ¶8, Exhibit A thereto.) Based on
the above, the Court awards costs in the requested amount of $4,899.
