PETITION TO CONFIRM MINOR’S COMPROMISE (filed 11/27/2024
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
The court GRANTS the petition to confirm the
minor’s compromise.
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
              On March 4, 2024, Plaintiffs
Lourdes McGarr and Angel Giovanni Tovar by and through his Guardian Ad Litem Lourdes
McGarr filed a complaint alleging (1) negligence, (2) private nuisance, (3)
breach of contract, and (4) intentional infliction of emotional distress.
 
              On November 27, 2024, Petitioner
Lourdes McGarr filed a petition to approve minor’s compromise. 
 
II. ANALYSIS
 
A.      Legal
Standard for Petition to Confirm Minor’s Compromise
 
An enforceable settlement of a minor’s or incompetent’s claim can
only be consummated with court approval. (Prob. Code, §§ 2504, 3500, 3600 et
seq.; Code Civ. Proc., § 372.) For this purpose, a petition for approval must
be presented to the court and until it is granted, there is no final
settlement. (Scruton v. Korean Air Lines Co. (1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 1596,
1603-1606.) Any settlement agreement therefore is voidable by the minor’s
guardian ad litem. (Id., at p. 1606.) 
 
Probate Code section 3600, et seq., governs how the settlement
proceeds are to be paid. Pursuant to Probate Code section 3601, the order shall
approve payment of reasonable expenses from the settlement as follows: 
 
The court making the order or giving the judgment referred to in
Section 3600, as a part thereof, shall make a further order authorizing and
directing that such reasonable expenses (medical or otherwise and including
reimbursement to a parent, guardian, or conservator), costs, and attorney’s
fees, as the court shall approve and allow therein, shall be paid from the
money or other property to be paid or delivered for the benefit of the minor or
incompetent person. (Prob. Code, § 3601, subd. (a).) 
 
In cases pursuant to Probate Code section 3601, “unless the court
has approved the fee agreement in advance, the court must use a reasonable fee
standard when approving and allowing the amount of attorney’s fees payable from
money or property paid or to be paid for the benefit of a minor or a person
with a disability.” (Cal. Rules of Court 7.955, subd. (a)(1).) In doing so,
“[t]he court must give consideration to the terms of any representation
agreement made between the attorney and the representative of the minor or
person with a disability and must evaluate the agreement based on the facts and
circumstances existing at the time the agreement was made, except where the
attorney and the representative of the minor or person with a disability
contemplated that the attorney's fee would be affected by later events.” (Cal.
Rules of Court 7.955, subd. (a)(2).)
 
B.      Analysis
 
The current matter involves negligence, private nuisance and
breach of contract causes of action due to Miraleste Canyon Estates Homeowners
Association failure to repair multiple leaks in Plaintiffs' home that were
originally reported December 5, 2022 and lead to mold and asbestos contamination
which required remediation and strip down of Plaintiffs' property, destruction
of personal belongings and relocation for six weeks. 
 
Pursuant to the settlement agreement reached between the parties, Miraleste
Canyon Estates Homeowners Association will pay a total of $75,000.00 to
Claimant. 
 
The contingency agreement is attached to the Petition as
Attachment 17a. In it, the attorney fees will be 33 1/3% of the gross recovery.
If settled, or 40% if suit is instituted or arbitration is demanded. Counsel
requests $15,000.00 in attorney fees which constitutes 20% of the gross
recovery. As a result, Claimant will receive a total net amount of $60,000.00 with
funds being deposited into a financial institution (Bank of America – San
Pedro) subject to withdrawal only on authorization of the court.
 
Based on the petition, the amount awarded to the Claimant is
reasonable. The court also finds counsel’s recovery of fees in the amount of 20%
is reasonable. Last, the court finds the use of settlement funds being
deposited subject to withdrawal by court authorization to be reasonable.
Accordingly, the petition is GRANTED.
 

III. DISPOSITION
 
Based on the foregoing, the court GRANTS the
petition to confirm the minor’s compromise.
