motion FOR ATTORNEY’S FEES (filed 11/22/2024)
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
The Court grants Defendant’s motion for attorney’s fees in part,
reducing Defendant’s requested fees by $97,157, and awarding a total of
$221,155. 
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
On August 4, 2022, Plaintiffs Culberstone-Stowers, Inc.; Culberson
Rental and Leasing Co., Inc.; and Richard Stowers, filed a complaint against
Defendant Toyota Motor Credit Corporation (“Defendant” or TMCC”) and Does 1-25,
inclusive.
 
On September 12, 2022, Defendant filed a demurrer to the
complaint, which was rendered moot by Plaintiffs’ filing of the First Amended
Complaint (“FAC”) on October 19, 2022.
 
The FAC alleges the following causes of action:
1. Breach of Contract;
2. Breach of Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing;
3. Civil Conspiracy – Fraud;
4. Violation of California Commercial
Code; and
5. Conversion
 
On March 7, 2023, the Court sustained
Defendant’s demurrer as to the FAC’s third and fifth
causes of action, and overruled as to the first, second, and fourth
causes of action.
 
              On August 14, 2024,
the Court granted Defendant’s motion for summary judgment.
 
On November, 22, 2024, Defendant filed a Motion for Attorney’s Fees,
arguing:
·               
That it is entitled to an award of
attorneys’ fees and costs under California Code of Civil Procedure §§ 1032,
1033.5, and Civil Code § 1717(a), following the Court’s summary judgment in its
favor. 
·               
The judgment dismissed all claims in the
Plaintiffs’ First Amended Complaint, including breach of contract, breach of
the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and violation of the
California Commercial Code. 
·               
These claims arose from Defendant’s
foreclosure sale of assets pledged as collateral, which Plaintiffs alleged was
commercially unreasonable. 
·               
TMCC successfully defended against these
claims based on the contract, securing case dismissal. 
·               
As the prevailing party, Defendant seeks
reimbursement for its legal fees and costs. 
·               
Defendant states its fees are
reasonable.
In opposition, Plaintiffs argues that
the fee request should be denied due to multiple issues, including (a) a
demurrer and a motion to compel rendered moot, (b) inflated fees for the motion
for summary judgment (MSJ) and the fee motion, (c) inefficiencies and
unnecessary costs from the transition between law firms and premature trial
preparation, and (d) block billing and vague or objectionable fee entries
throughout the billing records.
In reply, Defendant states that Plaintiffs
do not dispute that Defendant is entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees but
challenge the reasonableness of the amount sought. Defendant counters
Plaintiff’s arguments as follows:
·       It successfully pursued its demurrers, with the first prompting
Plaintiffs to amend their deficient complaint and the second narrowing the
issues, advancing the case. 
·       It justifies its trial preparation due to the proximity of the trial
date to the MSJ hearing, emphasizing that suspending trial preparation entirely
would have been impractical. 
·       Plaintiffs’ failure to identify specific unreasonable tasks or
problematic billing entries further undermines their objections. 
 
Defendant concludes that the fee request
is reasonable and should be granted in full.
 
II. ANALYSIS
 
A.      Request for
Judicial Notice
 
The Court grants Defendant’s request for judicial notice in full
pursuant to Evidence Code sections 452 (d) and (h) and Evidence Code section
453.
 
B.      Legal
Standard for Motion for Attorney’s Fees
 
A prevailing party is entitled to recover costs as a matter of
right. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd. (a)(4), (b).) “[W]hen authorized by
contract, statute or law; attorney fees are allowable as ‘costs’ under Code of
Civil Procedure section 1032.” (Del Cerro Mobile Estates v. Proffer
(2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 943, 947.) However, “‘recoverable litigation costs [under
section 1032] . . . include attorney fees, . . . only when the party entitled
to costs has a legal basis, [that is] independent of the cost statutes and
grounded in an agreement, statute, or other law, upon which to claim recovery
of attorney fees.’ [Citation.]” (Id.)
 
All costs must be “reasonably necessary to the conduct of the
litigation rather than merely convenient or beneficial to its preparation” and
reasonable in amount. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (c)(2), (3).) 
 
The breach of contract attorney fees and costs provision is found
in Civil Code § 1717.  It reads in pertinent part:  
 
“In any action on a contract, where the contract specifically
provides that attorney's fees and costs, which are incurred to enforce that
contract, shall be awarded either to one of the parties or to the prevailing
party, then the party who is determined to be the party prevailing on the
contract, whether he or she is the party specified in the contract or now,
shall be entitled to reasonable attorney's fees in addition to other
costs."  
 
(Civil Code §
1717(a).)  
 
C.      Defendant is
Entitled to Attorney’s Fees
 
Defendant argues that because Plaintiffs’ claims were dismissed
and they did not obtain any relief against Defendant, it is considered a “prevailing
party” under CCP section 1032. Defendant argues that it is entitled to recover
attorneys’ fees under the terms of the Inventory Loan agreements, including the
Loan Agreement and Forbearance Agreements, which explicitly provide for the
recovery of reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs by the prevailing party in
litigation. (FAC Ex. 1; TMCC Decl. Ex. B.) specifically, each of the
Forbearance Agreements contains the following provision: 
 
k. Attorneys’ Fees and Costs. If any litigation arises under this
Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to reimbursement of
reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs of suit in addition to any other relief to
which it may be entitled.
 
(FAC, Exs. 2 (¶ 21(k)), 4 (¶ 10(k), 5 (¶ 10(k)), 6 (¶ 14(k)); TMCC
Decl., Exs. C (¶ 21(k)), D (¶ 10(k)), E (¶ 10(k)), F (¶ 14(k)).)
 
Defendant further argues that this case qualifies as an
"action on a contract" under California Civil Code Section 1717
because Plaintiffs’ claims were based on the terms of the Loan Agreement and
Forbearance Agreements. The fact that Defendant incurred attorneys’ fees in a
defensive posture does not affect its entitlement to recover those fees. 
 
Plaintiffs do not dispute that Defendant is entitled to attorney’s
fees, rather they attack the reasonableness of the fees. 
 
Thus, the Court finds that Defendant is entitled to attorney’s
fees. 
 
D.     Reasonableness
of Fees
 
Defendant contends that its attorneys’ hourly rates were
reasonable and aligned with market rates for similar work in Los Angeles.
Holland & Knight initially represented TMCC, charging hourly rates ranging
from $625 to $990, which it argues were justified by the firm’s reputation, the
attorneys’ experience, and the complexity of the case. After Hinshaw &
Culbertson took over, its attorneys charged rates between $350 and $550, which
Defendant again states reflects the reasonable market value for similar services.
 
Defendant also asserts that the amount of hours worked by its
counsel was reasonable given the case’s complexity, which involved a commercial
loan dispute, multiple discovery motions, and a successful summary judgment.
Holland & Knight worked 397.76 hours, incurring $289,864.00 in fees, while
Hinshaw & Culbertson expended 131.3 hours, resulting in $55,962.50 in fees.
These hours were meticulously documented with detailed billing statements.
Defendant further argues that it is entitled to recover litigation costs under
CCP section 1032 and the Forbearance Agreements, which expressly allow
prevailing parties to recoup such costs. Additionally, Defendant seeks
$16,107.50 in fees for preparing this motion and anticipates $4,735.00 in
further costs related to the motion’s resolution. 
 
In total, Defendant requests $345,826.50 in attorneys’ fees and
costs, plus additional amounts for this motion. 
 
In opposition, Plaintiffs contend that Defendant’s request for
$374,163.51 in attorneys’ fees and costs, which includes defending against
Plaintiffs’ claims and preparing the fee motion, is unreasonably high.
Plaintiffs take issue with the following:
 
a.      Demurrer
 
Plaintiffs argue that Toyota’s request for $67,232.50 in
attorneys’ fees for its two demurrers is excessive, as the demurrers only
succeeded in dismissing two out of five claims. The first demurrer was mooted
by Plaintiffs’ First Amended Complaint, which revised allegations and added a
conversion claim, while the second demurrer largely repeated arguments from the
first. Although the second demurrer was untimely, the court sustained it for
two claims (civil conspiracy/fraud and conversion) but overruled it for three
others, finding questions of fact and rejecting Toyota’s key arguments,
including its “sham pleading” claim.
 
Plaintiffs emphasize that the demurrers did not resolve the case,
as Toyota still had to litigate the remaining three claims through summary
judgment. Plaintiffs contend that the court has discretion to deny or reduce
fees when the outcome of a motion is only partially successful. (See Moran
v. Endres (2006) 135 Cal.App.4th 952, 955 (affirming denial of fees for
motion to strike where only one claim was stricken, explaining “Defendants
sought to dismiss the entire complaint and instead obtained only the most
illusory victory” and noting that the underlying fact allegations were not
stricken)). Plaintiffs propose that Toyota be awarded $28,000, or 40% of the
fees incurred, arguing this amount reflects the limited success of the
demurrers.
 
In Moran, the defendants filed a special motion to strike
under the anti-SLAPP statute, and the court granted the motion only as to one
claim, conspiracy, but denied it for the remaining causes of action, finding
that they were not covered by the anti-SLAPP statute. (Moran, supra,
135 Cal.App.4th at 954.) The court found that the conspiracy claim added
little to the case, as it did not change the factual allegations or legal
burdens faced by the defendants. (Id.) When the defendants sought
attorneys’ fees as prevailing parties, the court denied the request,
determining that their success was too minimal and did not justify a fee award.
(Id.) On appeal, the Court of Appeal affirmed, stating: 
 
[The] defendants' motion accomplished nothing, except that
plaintiffs were put to the cost of defending the motion. The possible recovery
against defendants did not change. The factual allegations which defendants had
to defend did not change. The work involved in trying the case did not change.
Defendants' burden concerning their jurisdictional defense did not change. The
case was essentially the same after the ruling on the special motion to strike
as it was before. The results of the motion were minimal and insignificant,
fully justifying the court's finding that defendants should not recover fees.
 
(Id. at 955.) 
 
The Court finds that the fees incurred by Defendant for its
demurrers were reasonable, contrary to Plaintiffs’ argument that the fees were
excessive because the demurrers succeeded on only two of five causes of action.
The Court finds this case to be distinguishable from the situation in Moran,
where the defendants’ motion “accomplished nothing.” As Defendant discusses in
its reply, the demurrers achieved narrowed the issues in the case and
eliminated some of Plaintiffs’ claims, thereby advancing the litigation.
Defendant sufficiently satisfied its burden in demonstrating that the rates and
hours worked were reasonable. 
The Court finds that the hourly rates charged by Holland &
Knight and Hinshaw & Culbertson attorneys are reasonable and align with
market rates for similar work in the relevant community. For Holland &
Knight, Elissa McClure was the partner and supervising counsel. She declares
that she has over a decade of experience in complex commercial litigation and
corporate investigations, charged an hourly rate starting at $775 and later
increasing to $990. (McClure Decl., ¶¶ 6, 8, 15.) She states these rates are justified
given the case’s complexity, the amount in controversy, the reputation of Ms.
McClure and the firm, and the skill required to defend Defendant successfully.
(McClure Decl., ¶¶ 8, 15-17.) Associates at Holland & Knight, who also
contributed to the case, billed at hourly rates between $625 and $775, which
are similarly reasonable under the circumstances. (McClure Decl., ¶¶ 9-15.)
For, Hinshaw & Culbertso, Brian A. Paino was the lead trial counsel. He
declares that he has nearly 20 years of experience in financial litigation, and
charged $550 per hour. (Paino Decl., ¶¶ 3, 8.) Additional team members, Zeeshan
Iqbal and Helen Mosothoane, billed at $350 and $425 per hour, respectively.
(Paino Decl., ¶¶ 10-11.) He states these rates are consistent with those
charged by attorneys of comparable skill and experience in Los Angeles for
similar cases. (Paino Decl., ¶ 12.) Courts have held that attorney declarations
are a reliable basis for determining reasonable rates. (Pasternack v.
McCullough (2021) 65 Cal.App.5th 1050, 1059.) 
 
The Court finds that the proposed 40% reduction in fees is
unwarranted. However, the Court finds that while Defendant’s demurrers
succeeded in narrowing issues and eliminating two claims, a reduction in billed
hours is appropriate to account for duplication and inefficiencies,
particularly where arguments in the second demurrer largely repeated those in
the first. The Court acknowledges that the hourly rates charged by Defendant’s
counsel are reasonable and align with market standards, but the hours spent were
excessive given the limited success relative to the total number of claims
addressed. For Holland & Knight, the Court reduces partner hours from 20 to
16 and associate hours from 25 to 20, resulting in adjusted fees of $13,600 for
partner work and $14,000 for associate work. For Hinshaw & Culbertson, the
Court reduces partner hours from 12 to 10 and associate hours from 15 to 12,
resulting in adjusted fees of $5,500 for partner work and $4,800 for associate
work. 
 
In total, the Court reduces the original fee request of $67,232.50
by $11,450, yielding an adjusted award of $55,782.50. 
 
b.      Discovery
 
Plaintiffs argue that Defendant’s request for $131,208 in
discovery-related fees is excessive, as much of the work was unnecessary in a
relatively straightforward case. They note that Holland’s attorneys served
discovery requests, engaged in meet-and-confer efforts, and filed two motions
to compel. While the first motion supported the successful summary judgment,
the second was rendered moot by the judgment and accomplished nothing.
Additionally, no depositions were taken or defended during discovery. Plaintiffs
urge the Court to reduce the fees by excluding approximately $42,000 related to
the second, unnecessary motion to compel and by limiting discovery-related fees
to $76,876, which they argue is reasonable for the work performed. Plaintiffs
also request the exclusion of $12,864.50 in fees for experts unrelated to the
summary judgment issues. They propose awarding at most $34,000 for discovery
tasks, reflecting only the necessary and relevant efforts.
 
              In reply, Defendant argues that
the discovery-related fees it incurred were reasonable and necessitated by the
circumstances of the case. Plaintiffs challenge the fees associated with Defendant’s
second motion to compel and its retention of experts, but Defendant asserts
that these actions were caused by Plaintiffs’ repeated failure to comply with
discovery obligations. The second motion to compel was filed on January 8,
2024, before Defendant’s dispositive motion for summary judgment on February 9,
2024. Defendant emphasizes that it was reasonable to seek compliant discovery
responses within the statutory 45-day deadline for filing motions to compel
(Civ. Proc. Code § 2030.300(c)) and before the MSJ ruling.
 
Defendant also argues that retaining experts was justified given the
trial’s September 30, 2024, date, the August 30, 2024, discovery cut-off, and
the July 22, 2024, deadline to make expert demands. (Civ. Proc. Code §§
2024.020(a), 2034.220, 2034.230). Defendant contends it was necessary to
prepare for trial due to the uncertainty surrounding the MSJ outcome and the
rapidly approaching deadlines. The second motion to compel was only rendered
moot because the court granted the MSJ, not because it was unwarranted or
lacked merit. Defendant argues that its discovery-related actions were
reasonable, proportionate, and required to address the realities and procedural
demands of the case.
 
The Court finds that some of the fees associated with Defendant’s
discovery-related work should be reduced to account for inefficiencies and
tasks of limited utility, such as the second motion to compel and fees related
to experts that were not directly tied to the summary judgment issues. The
Court finds that Defendant is entitled to fees because the motion was caused by
Plaintiffs’ repeated failure to comply with discovery obligations and filing
the motion prior to the MSJ was reasonable. However, the amount requested
appears to be somewhat excessive. The Court will instead award based on an
estimated allocation of 20 partner hours at $850 per hour ($17,000) and 35
associate hours at $700 per hour ($24,500), for a total of $41,500.
 
As for the expert fees, the Court finds that retaining experts was
justified given the case’s procedural timeline, including the September 30,
2024, trial date, the August 30, 2024, discovery cut-off, and the July 22,
2024, expert demand deadline. Thus, the Court declines to reduce any fees
associated with this.
 
Preparing for trial while awaiting the MSJ ruling was a reasonable
litigation strategy, as suspending trial preparation entirely would have risked
missing key deadlines if the MSJ had been denied. Finally, the Court agrees
with Defendant that the second motion to compel was rendered moot only because
the MSJ was granted, not because the motion lacked merit or was unnecessary.
The Court finds that Defendant’s discovery-related actions were proportionate
and reasonable given the procedural demands and uncertainties of the case. 
 
Thus, the Court
reduces Defendant’s discovery-related fees by $21,000, awarding $110,208.  
 
c.       MSJ
 
Plaintiffs argue that Defendant’s request for $44,754 in fees for
its motion for summary judgment is unreasonable, given the simplicity of the
case and the brief nature of the motion and opposition. The MSJ and opposition
were both only eight-and-a-half pages long, focusing on a single issue related
to the lack of damages information provided during discovery. Plaintiffs
contend that reasonable fees for the MSJ should not exceed $15,000, citing
inefficiencies likely caused by the transition between Defendant’s two law
firms. Additionally, they point out that nearly as much was billed for the
reply brief ($13,067.50) as for the motion itself ($16,142.50), further
indicating inefficiency. Plaintiffs ask the court to limit the award for the
MSJ to $15,000.
 
              In reply, Defendant argues that
Plaintiffs fail to identify specific time entries or provide evidence that the
time spent was excessive. Instead, Plaintiffs rely solely on their counsel’s
conclusory opinion, without analyzing the actual billing records related to the
MSJ preparation. Defendant asserts that such unsupported assertions are
insufficient to establish that the fees were unreasonable. 
 
              The Court agrees with Plaintiffs
that the requested fees for the MSJ do not warrant $44,754, including
$16,142.50 for preparing the motion and $13,067.50 for the reply brief.
Plaintiffs point out that the MSJ is only eight-and-a-half-page length and
focus on a single issue related to damages. The Court agrees with Plaintiffs
that the requested fees are excessive. The Court finds $15,000 to be
reasonable. The Court allocates 9 hours for motion preparation and 6 hours for
the reply brief, with hourly rates of $550 for partners and $375 for
associates. This results in $4,250 for motion preparation ($2,750 for partners
and $1,500 for associates) and $2,775 for the reply brief ($1,650 for partners
and $1,125 for associates). An additional $7,975 is allocated for other supporting
tasks, bringing the total to $15,000. The Court finds this to appropriately
compensate Defendant for its work.
 
              Thus, the Court reduces the amount
requested for the MSJ by $29,754, awarding $15,000. 
 
d.      Non-Attorney
Work
 
Plaintiffs argue that $26,503.50 of Defendant’s claimed fees are
improper because they involve vague descriptions, duplicative work, or
non-attorney tasks performed by attorneys. They contend that these issues make
the entries objectionable and request that the Court not allow these fees. Plaintiffs’
counsel, Timothy M. Kowal points out specific entries as objectionable. Kowal
criticizes certain entries for vague descriptions, such as "research
xxxx," "multiple correspondence xxxx," or "detailed
correspondence regarding xxxx," which lack sufficient detail to determine
the reasonableness or necessity of the work performed. Kowal also states that a
significant number of descriptions are also redacted, further complicating the
assessment of whether the time spent was justified. Additionally, Kowal points
out a pattern of duplicative work, with multiple team members performing
similar tasks, such as analyzing the same issues, strategizing, or reviewing
identical documents. Several entries also involve non-attorney tasks, such as
coordinating court reporters, formatting responses, or monitoring court
websites, which were billed at attorney rates ranging from $625 to $890 per
hour. Kowal states these tasks could have been performed by administrative
staff at a lower cost, raising efficiency concerns. Furthermore, Kowal states there
is noticeable repetition in activities like "conferring with Ms.
McClure" or "correspondence with opposing counsel," often
without clear justification for their frequency. Kowal states these patterns
suggest inefficiencies and raise questions about whether the requested fees are
reasonable given the nature of the work performed. 
 
              In reply, Defendant argues that
Plaintiffs' claim of vague, duplicative, or non-attorney work entries in the
fee bills lacks merit. Defendant emphasizes that under the lodestar method,
attorneys are not required to record minute-by-minute details of their time but
must provide sufficient information about the general subject matter of the
work. The time entries Plaintiffs challenge meet this standard, particularly
when viewed in the context of surrounding entries. Defendant notes that any
redactions in the invoices were made to protect attorney-client privilege and
prevent disclosure of litigation strategy, given the ongoing appeal of the
court's order on the MSJ. Defendant asserts that these redactions are
reasonable and offers to provide unredacted invoices for in-camera review if
the court requires further clarification. Defendant concludes that Plaintiffs
have failed to identify specific entries warranting a reduction and that the
provided records are sufficiently detailed to support the claimed fees.
 
The Court finds that some of the fees requested here should be
reduced. While Defendant argues that the time entries provide sufficient detail
under the lodestar method, Plaintiffs have identified specific issues that
suggest inefficiencies and unnecessary costs. The Court agrees that vague
descriptions, such as "research xxxx" or "multiple
correspondence xxxx," lack sufficient detail to assess the reasonableness
of the work performed. Plaintiffs identified these vague entries to total
$5,880. The Court declines to award any of these fees and reduces the entire
amount ($5,880) attributed to vague descriptions.
 
Additionally, Plaintiffs highlighted instances of duplicative
work, where multiple attorneys performed similar tasks, such as conferring on
strategy or reviewing the same documents. These duplicative efforts, billed at
rates between $625 and $890 per hour, amounted to $3,560. The Court reduces
this amount by $3,000 to reflect overlap while preserving reasonable efforts. 
 
For non-attorney tasks, such as coordinating court reporters,
formatting responses, and monitoring court websites, were billed at attorney
rates, totaling $1,875. The Court reduces this amount by $1,120, representing a
60% adjustment.
 
Thus, the Court reduces the fees identified as vague, duplicative,
and non-attorney work by $16,503.50 and will instead award $10,000. 
 
e.      Two Firms for
Different Stages of Litigation; Trial Preparation
 
Plaintiffs argue that they should not be required to pay for
duplicative efforts caused by Defendant’s decision to use two law firms at
different stages of litigation, which resulted in inefficiencies and
unnecessary billing. Holland handled the case through the pleading stage,
discovery, and the motion for summary judgment, while Hinshaw was brought in
later as trial counsel, leading to significant overlap in efforts. Plaintiffs
highlight examples of duplicative work, such as both firms conducting similar analyses
of the complaint and contracts at different times. They contend that much of
Hinshaw’s early work involved getting up to speed and transitioning files,
rather than advancing the defense or contributing to the case's resolution.
 
Plaintiffs argue that courts may reduce fees when multiple counsel
create duplication and inefficiency. (California Common Cause v. Duffy
(1987) 200 Cal.App.3d 730, 753-754.) They note that the July 2024 invoices from
both firms reflect extensive time spent on file transfers and discussions,
which added costs unrelated to the litigation’s substantive progress or
Plaintiffs’ actions. Plaintiffs request that any fee award beyond specific
tasks—such as the demurrer, summary judgment, and fee motion—be reduced to
account for this unnecessary duplication and wasteful effort.
 
Plaintiffs argue that Defendant’s trial counsel, Hinshaw,
unnecessarily incurred $27,772 in trial preparation fees before the Court
granted Defendant’s motion for summary judgment. They contend that preparing
for trial was premature and contrary to the purpose of a summary judgment
motion, which is to avoid the expense of trial. These fees included $3,232.50
for identifying and interviewing expert witnesses shortly before the tentative
ruling granting summary judgment. Plaintiffs acknowledge that the new trial
team may have wanted to “work ahead,” but assert that this preparation did not
contribute to winning the dispositive motion or resolving the case. They
request that any fee award beyond specific tasks, such as the demurrer, summary
judgment, and fee motion, be reduced to account for these unnecessary and
ill-timed trial preparation efforts.
 
In reply, Defendant argues that the services performed by Hinshaw,
including trial preparation, were necessary and reasonable, even though
Plaintiffs claim that these efforts were duplicative of work previously done by
Holland. Plaintiffs specifically criticize Hinshaw for analyzing Plaintiffs’
claims and loan documents, which Holland had reviewed two years earlier, but
they concede that Hinshaw’s efforts may have been necessary in preparing for
trial. (Opposition, 14:10-19.) Defendant counters that it was not practical or
prudent to suspend trial preparation activities solely on the assumption that
its MSJ would be granted, as summary judgment motions are often denied. Defendant
further argues that duplication of work is a normal and necessary aspect of
long-running litigation. Over time, legal work product can become outdated,
requiring attorneys to update research, revisit prior analyses, and ensure
accuracy in light of new case law or developments. Defendant contends that this
type of duplication is inherent in the litigation process and cannot be deemed
unreasonable. Plaintiffs' general claims of excessive or duplicative fees fail
to cite specific time entries or provide sufficient evidence, which is
inadequate to demonstrate that the fees were unreasonable.
 
The Court finds that the fees incurred by Hinshaw for trial
preparation were reasonable, as Defendant has explained the need to prepare for
trial in light of the uncertainties surrounding the MSJ. However, the Court
agrees with Plaintiffs that some hours billed during the transition of Hinshaw
as trial counsel, including those related to file transfers, discussions, and
duplicative analyses of case materials, were inefficient and overlapped with
work previously performed by Holland. Based on the July 2024 invoices, the
Court estimates that 50 hours were spent on transition-related activities and
finds that 30% of these hours, or 15 hours, were duplicative or unnecessary. 
 
Given the billing rates for this work, which ranged from $550 to
$775 per hour, the Court applies an average rate of $650 per hour to calculate
the reduction. Accordingly, the Court reduces the fee award by $9,750 (15 hours
× $650/hour) to address inefficiencies and duplication during the transition.
The remaining fees are deemed reasonable and appropriate.
 
Thus, the Court reduces the fees for the transition and trial
preparation in the amount of $9,750 and will award $18,022.
 
f.       
Fee Motion
 
Plaintiffs argue that Defendant’s $20,842.50 expense for preparing
the fee motion is excessive and should be reduced to $10,000. They contend that
the motion devoted unnecessary time to basic issues, such as the entitlement to
fees under Civil Code Section 1717, which could have been streamlined by
stipulating to this point with Plaintiffs. Plaintiffs criticize Defendant for
filing redundant documents, such as a motion for judicial notice and an
unnecessary declaration, in a case where the court was already familiar with
the record. They also claim the brief included boilerplate legal standards
requiring minimal effort and lacked a clear narrative explaining why the tasks
were necessary. Additionally, Plaintiffs highlight inefficiencies and
duplication in the preparation process. For instance, two attorneys spent over
ten combined hours reviewing invoices for confidential or privileged
information that should not have been included in the first place. Similarly,
multiple attorneys reviewed lawyer biographies that were only briefly mentioned
in the motion. Plaintiffs argue that this overstaffing and duplication inflated
costs unnecessarily and ask the court to limit the award for preparing the fee
motion to a reasonable amount of $10,000.
 
In reply, Defendant argues that the services performed in
connection with its motion for fees were reasonable and necessary, countering
Plaintiffs' claims to the contrary. Plaintiffs suggest Defendant could have
saved time by asking for a stipulation on its entitlement to fees, but Defendant
points out that Plaintiffs consistently failed to cooperate throughout the
case. Plaintiffs necessitated Defendant’s initial demurrer, failed to comply
with discovery obligations, required multiple discovery motions, and objected
to a proposed order recognizing Defendant’s entitlement to recover costs. (Opposition,
16:23-28; 17:1-21.) Defendants argue these actions demonstrated that Plaintiffs
were unlikely to agree to a stipulation. Plaintiffs also challenge Defendant’s
preparation of the request for judicial notice (RJN), claiming it was
unnecessary. Defendant counters that California law mandates courts to take
judicial notice of certain matters when requested. (Cal. Evid. Code § 453.)
Thus, preparing the RJN and supporting declarations was entirely reasonable.
Additionally, Plaintiffs argue against time spent reviewing invoices for
attorney-client privileged or confidential information, suggesting such
information should not have been included. Defendant asserts it was reasonable
to review invoices for protected content given the ongoing appeal and the need
to safeguard sensitive information.
 
              The Court finds that while some of
Defendant’s efforts in preparing the fee motion were reasonable, the total
expense of $20,842.50 is excessive and warrants a reduction. Plaintiffs have
highlighted specific tasks that inflated costs, such as over 10 hours spent by
two attorneys reviewing invoices for confidentiality, which the Court finds
could have been completed in 5 hours. This results in a reduction of $3,750
based on an average billing rate of $750 per hour. Similarly, while the
preparation of the request for judicial notice and supporting documents was
reasonable given the legal context, the time billed for these tasks was
excessive and is reduced by $1,950, based on 3 hours at a rate of $650 per
hour. Additionally, overlapping and duplicative efforts, such as analyzing
attorney biographies and preparing boilerplate sections, unnecessarily
increased costs. The Court reduces these efforts by 4 hours, resulting in a
reduction of $3,000, based on an average rate of $750 per hour.
 
In total, the Court reduces Defendant’s fees for preparing the fee
motion by $8,700, bringing the award to $12,142.50. 
 
g.       Motion to
Strike
 
Plaintiffs argue that Defendant's request for $6,210 in fees for a
motion to strike is unjustified, as the purpose and outcome of the motion are
not explained in the fee bills or moving papers. They contend that without a
clear explanation of the motion’s necessity to the litigation objectives, the
fees should not be awarded. Plaintiffs request that the court reduce the fee
award in full.
 
In reply, Defendant argues that the services performed in
connection with the motion to strike were reasonable and necessary. Plaintiffs
object to six time entries in Holland’s invoices related to the motion to
strike, claiming Defendant did not explain its purpose or necessity. Defendant
clarifies that the motion to strike was filed by Plaintiffs and pertained to Defendant’s
Demand for Bill of Particulars, which was aimed at addressing Plaintiffs’
repeated failure to provide meaningful discovery responses supporting their
claimed damages.  Under CCP § 454, a
demand for a bill of particulars is permitted in contract actions involving
money claims with multiple items. The Demand was warranted given Plaintiffs’
non-compliance in discovery, which ultimately contributed to judgment in Defendant’s
favor. Plaintiffs responded with a motion to strike instead of complying with
the Demand, further obstructing Defendant’s efforts to ascertain damages. Defendant
asserts that the legal services involved in reviewing and responding to
Plaintiffs’ motion to strike were directly necessitated by Plaintiffs’ actions
and were reasonable in light of the circumstances.
 
The Court finds that the $6,210 in fees for the motion to strike
were reasonable. Plaintiffs’ objection, based on the lack of a detailed
explanation for the motion’s purpose in the fee bills, is unpersuasive.
Defendant has clarified that the motion to strike was filed by Plaintiffs in
response to Defendant’s Demand for Bill of Particulars, which was aimed at
addressing Plaintiffs’ repeated failure to provide adequate discovery responses
regarding their claimed damages. Under CCP § 454, a demand for a bill of
particulars is a valid procedural tool in contract actions involving monetary
claims with multiple items. Defendant’s demand was justified given Plaintiffs’
non-compliance with discovery, and the motion to strike was a direct response
to this demand, further reflecting Plaintiffs’ obstructive litigation tactics.
The legal services performed by Defendant in reviewing and responding to the
motion to strike were used to advance the case and address Plaintiffs’ failure
to provide meaningful discovery responses. These efforts ultimately contributed
to the judgment in Defendant’s favor. 
Accordingly, the Court finds that the fees associated with the
motion to strike were reasonable under the circumstances and awards the full
amount of $6,210.
 
h.      Block Billing
 
Plaintiffs argue that Holland & Knight’s block billing
practices make it impossible to accurately assess the time spent on specific
tasks, undermining the credibility of the invoices and Toyota’s ability to
justify its fee request. Block billing—where multiple tasks are combined into a
single entry—prevents determining whether time was spent efficiently or on
appropriate activities. Plaintiffs contend that Defendant as the moving party,
bears the burden of demonstrating that its fees are reasonable, and vague,
block-billed entries warrant reductions or denial of fees. Plaintiffs highlight
that courts often apply global downward adjustments of 10-30% to address block
billing. Given the pervasive block billing in Holland & Knight’s invoices,
which total $288,332, Plaintiffs request that the court apply a downward
adjustment of 20-30% to these fees or refuse to award fees for the offending
entries altogether.
 
In reply, Defendant argues that the purported use of block billing
by its counsel, Holland, does not preclude the recovery of attorneys’ fees. Defendant
contends that Plaintiffs’ argument against block billing is largely conclusory
and lacks specific citations to the invoices. Plaintiffs rely on cherry-picked
examples of block-billed entries, such as "meeting and conferring with
plaintiffs’ counsel, conferring internally, and preparing drafts," but
fail to demonstrate that any of the entries involved non-compensable tasks.
(Opposition, 18:4-28; 19:1-6.) Defendant emphasizes that block billing is not
inherently objectionable and does not automatically render fees non-compensable.
(Jaramillo v. County of Orange (2011) 200 Cal.App.4th 811, 830; Heritage
Pacific Financial, LLC v. Monroy (2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 972, 1010.) Courts
retain discretion to address block billing only when it prevents distinguishing
between compensable and non-compensable tasks. Defendant argues that this issue
is irrelevant here because all fees sought are for compensable work. Plaintiffs
neither identify non-compensable tasks nor provide evidence that block billing
has impaired the Court’s ability to assess the fees. Defendant concludes that
Plaintiffs’ blanket assertions are insufficient to justify reducing or
eliminating any of the requested fees.
 
The Court declines to reduce Defendant’s fees because Plaintiffs fail
to demonstrate that the block billing practice rendered the invoices unreliable
or prevented the Court from distinguishing between compensable and
non-compensable tasks. While Plaintiffs argue that block billing undermines the
credibility of the fee request and cite examples of combined entries such as
"meeting and conferring with plaintiffs’ counsel, conferring internally,
and preparing drafts," they do not provide sufficient evidence that the
entries include non-compensable work or that the block billing prevented an
accurate assessment of the tasks performed. Upon review of the billing, the
Court finds that Defendant’s invoices adequately detail the general subject
matter of the work performed, and the Court finds that the fees sought are for
compensable tasks. 
 
Thus, the Court will not reduce any fees for block billing.
