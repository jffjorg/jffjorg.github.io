TENTATIVE
RULING

Defendants
Jiefeng Cao and Everflow Renovations’ Demurrer and Motion to Strike Plaintiff’s
Complaint are SUSTAINED IN PART with twenty (20) days
leave to amend as to the fourth cause of action and without leave to amend as
to the eighth cause of action. The Demurrer and Motion to Strike are also
OVERRULED IN PART as to the first, second, third, fifth, sixth, seventh, and
ninth causes of action.
 
BACKGROUND

This is an action for contractual fraud. In July 2023,
Plaintiffs Hubert Co and Linh Trac hired Defendants Jiefeng Cao and Everflow
Renovations (Everflow) to renovate a property in San Gabriel. Subsequently,
they allege Cao and Everflow failed to complete the renovations on time and
demanded extra payments. They also allege the renovations were substandard and
defective.
 
On June 28, 2024, Co and Trac filed a complaint against
Cao; Everflow; Yecai Zhou; ZH Excellent Construction, Inc.; and Does 1-50,
alleging the following causes of action: (1) violation of state contractor’s
license law; (2) declaratory relief; (3) violation of Civil Code sections
1689.5 to 1689.14 and Business and Professions Code section 7163; (4)
negligence; (5) breach of implied warranty/covenant to perform work in a good
and competent manner; (6) violation of Business and Professions Code section
7160; (7) fraud; (8) constructive fraud; and (9) attempted extortion.
 
On September 23, 2024, Cao and Everflow filed the present
demurrer and motion to strike. On November 12, 2024, Cao and Everflow’s counsel
telephonically met and conferred with Co and Trac’s counsel. (Ng Decl., ¶ 2.)

A hearing on the present motions is set for November 27,
2024, along with a case management conference.
 
ANALYSIS

Cao and Everflow demur to Co and Trac’s
entire Complaint. For the following reasons, the court SUSTAINS their demurrer as to the fourth cause of action with leave to amend and
the eighth cause of action without leave to amend. The court also OVERRULES their demurrer as to the first, second, third, fifth, sixth, seventh, and
ninth causes of action.
 
Legal Standard

A party may demur to a complaint on the
grounds that it “does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of
action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e).) A demurrer tests whether the
complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147
Cal.App.4th 740, 747 (Hahn).) When considering demurrers, courts accept
all well pleaded facts as true. (Fox v. JAMDAT Mobile, Inc. (2010) 185
Cal.App.4th 1068, 1078.) In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent
on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian v.
Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) “A demurrer tests the
pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters. Therefore, it
lies only where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are
judicially noticed.” (SKF Farms v. Superior Court (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d
902, 905.) “The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing is whether the
complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters, states a cause of
action.” (Hahn, supra, at p. 747.)
 
Violation of State Contractor’s License
Law (First Cause of Action)
 
Cao and Everflow argue Co and Trac’s first
cause of action for violation of state contractor’s license law fails because
it inadequately alleges damages. The court disagrees.
 
Legal Standard

Business and Professions Code section 7031, subdivision (b)
states “[e]xcept as provided in subdivision (e), a person who utilizes the
services of an unlicensed contractor may bring an action in any court of
competent jurisdiction in this state to recover all compensation paid to the
unlicensed contractor for performance of any act or contract.” Subdivision (e)
states as follows:
 
“The
judicial doctrine of substantial compliance shall not apply under this section
where the person who engaged in the business or acted in the capacity of a
contractor has never been a duly licensed contractor in this state. However,
notwithstanding subdivision (b) of Section 143, the court may determine that
there has been substantial compliance with licensure requirements under this
section if it is shown at an evidentiary hearing that the person who engaged in
the business or acted in the capacity of a contractor (1) had been duly
licensed as a contractor in this state prior to the performance of the act or
contract, (2) acted reasonably and in good faith to maintain proper licensure,
and (3) acted promptly and in good faith to remedy the failure to comply with
the licensure requirements upon learning of the failure.” (Bus. & Prof.
Code, § 7031, subd. (e).)
 
Discussion
 
In this case, Cao and Everflow argue the
specific allegations of the Complaint fail to support requested damages of
$110,000.00 as they only add up to $32,600.00. (Motion, p. 7:1-11.) But Cao and
Everflow fail to point to any authority that allows them to demur to a cause of
action on the grounds that it fails to adequately allege the specific amount of
damages, especially where it also alleges such damages are “according to
proof.” (Complaint, ¶ 36.)
 
Accordingly, the court OVERRULES Cao and Everflow’s demurrer to this cause of action.
 
Declaratory Relief (Second Cause of
Action)
 
Cao and Everflow contend Co and Trac’s second
cause of action for declaratory relief fails as a matter of law. The court disagrees.
 
Legal Standard
 
“To qualify for declaratory relief, a party would have to
demonstrate its action presented two essential elements: (1) a proper subject
of declaratory relief, and (2) an actual controversy involving justiciable
questions relating to the party’s rights or obligations.” (Jolley v. Chase
Home Finance, LLC (2013) 213 Cal.App.4th 872, 909, quotation marks and
brackets omitted.) “The courts do not issue advisory opinions about the rights
and duties of the parties under particular agreements, if no actual,
justiciable controversy has yet developed.” (Otay Land Co. v. Royal
Indemnity Co. (2008) 169 Cal.App.4th 556, 563.)
 
Discussion
 
In this case, Cao and Everflow contend
declaratory relief is inappropriate because Co and Trac are seeking to obtain
an additional cause of action for the determination of identical issues.
(Motion, p. 8:5-10.) But as their own briefing acknowledges, the existence of
other remedies is not an absolute bar to declaratory relief. (Herrmann v.
Fireman’s Fund Ins. Co. (1954) 127 Cal.App.2d 560, 566.) Instead, it
provides a discretionary basis for the court to deny declaratory relief
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1061. (General of America Ins.
Co. v. Lilly (1968) 258 Cal.App.2d 465, 471.)
 
Accordingly, the court OVERRULES Cao and Everflow’s demurrer to this cause of action.
 
Violation of Civil Code §§ 1689.5 to
1689.14 and Business and Professions Code § 7163 (Third Cause of Action)
 
Cao and Everflow maintain Co and Trac’s third
cause of action for violation of Civil Code section 1689.5 to 1689.14 and
Business and Professions Code section 7163 fails to plead sufficient facts to
state a claim. But in arguing that this cause of action is insufficiently pled,
they fail to cite to a single statute or case. Instead, they appear to contest
the allegations of the Complaint which is the purpose of an answer, not a
demurrer or motion to strike. (Motion, p. 8:17-25.)
 
Accordingly, the court OVERRULES Cao and Everflow’s demurrer to this cause of action.
 
Negligence (Fourth Cause of Action)
 
Cao and Everflow argue Co and Trac’s fourth
cause of action for negligence fails because it is insufficiently pled. The
court agrees.
 
Legal Standard
 
The basic elements of a negligence claim are
(1) duty, (2) breach, (3) causation, and (4) damages. (Leslie G. v. Perry
& Associates (1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 472, 480.) Because “[a]llegations of
negligence have long been exempted from the code pleading requirement to state
the facts constituting the cause of action,” it may be pleaded generally. (McCoy
v. Gustafson (2009) 180 Cal.App.4th 56, 102.)
 
Discussion
 
In this case, the Complaint alleges Cao and
Everflow owed Co and Trac a duty to exercise reasonable care in performing
services or providing materials for the remodeling of their property.
(Complaint, ¶ 47.) Cao and Everflow argue this cause of action fails because it
does not allege Cao and Everflow caused property damage. (Motion, p. 9:13-27.)
Although they do not invoke it by name, this argument is based on the economic
loss rule which bars “recovery in tort for negligently inflicted ‘purely
economic losses,’ meaning financial harm unaccompanied by physical or property
damage.” (Sheen v. Wells Fargo Bank. N.A. (2022) 12 Cal.5th 905, 922.) It
“functions to bar claims in negligence for pure economic losses in deference to
a contract between litigating parties.” (Id., at p. 922.) It also applies
to allegations of negligent construction unless the alleged defects cause
property damage. (Aas v. Superior Court (2000) 24 Cal.4th 627, 643,
652-653, superseded by statute on other grounds as stated in Rosen v. State
Farm General Ins. Co. (2003) 30 Cal.App.4th 1070, 1079.) 
 
Here, while the Complaint alleges Cao and
Everflow’s renovations were defective and inadequate, the Complaint fails to
allege how these deficiencies or defects caused Co and Trac to suffer property
damage. (Complaint, ¶ 48.) Thus, as pled, this cause of action is barred by the
economic loss rule.
 
Accordingly, the court SUSTAINS Cao and Everflow’s demurrer to this cause of action with leave to amend.
 
Breach of Implied Warranty (Fifth Cause
of Action)
 
Cao and Everflow contend Co and Trac’s fifth
cause of action for breach of implied warranty fails because their work was
performed pursuant to plans provided by Co and Trac. (Motion, p. 10:22-26.) But
this contention misstates and misconstrues the pleadings. Nowhere does the
Complaint allege Cao and Everflow performed renovations pursuant to Co and
Trac’s plans. Instead, it claims the opposite by alleging Cao failed to
complete the work that was promised. (Complaint, ¶ 10, 22, 26.)
 
Accordingly, the court OVERRULES Cao and Everflow’s demurrer to this cause of action.
 
Violation of Business and Professions
Code § 7160 (Sixth Cause of Action)
 
Cao and Everflow maintain Co and Trac’s sixth
cause of action for violation of Business and Professions Code section 7160
fails because it is uncertain and duplicative. Cao and Everflow maintain this
cause of action is uncertain because it uses the ambiguous term “remodeling”
while the rest of the Complaint refers to “renovations.” (Motion, p. 11:5-13.) This
is a distinction without a difference that merits no further discussion. Cao
and Everflow also maintain this cause of action is duplicative because it is a
subset of claims for fraud. (Motion, p. 11:13-26.) But while this cause of
action is based on the elements of common law fraud, it is separately brought
pursuant to Business and Professions Code section 7160 which provides
additional remedies and attorney fees for fraud claims arising from a home
improvement contract.

And even if it was duplicative, this is not a proper ground
for demurrer. There is a split of authority on whether a demurrer can be
sustained on grounds that a cause of action is duplicitous. In Blickman
Turkus, LP v. MF Downtown Sunnyvale, LLC (2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 858 (Blickman
Turkus), the Sixth District Court of Appeal held a demurrer could not be
sustained on grounds that it is duplicative pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 430.10. (Id., at p. 890.) In Palm Springs Villas II
Homeowners Assn., Inc. v. Parth (2016) 248 Cal.App.4th 268 (Palm Springs
Villas), the Fourth District Court of Appeal held the opposite, noting a
duplicative cause of action is grounds upon which a demurrer may be sustained
according to Rodrigues v. Campbell Industries (1978) 87 Cal.App.3d 494,
501 (Rodrigues). (Palm Springs Villas, supra, 248
Cal.App.4th at p. 290.)
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10 authorizes a party
to bring a demurrer on eight different grounds, none of which explicitly
include grounds that a cause of action is duplicative or superfluous. In Rodrigues,
the Fourth District Court of Appeal noted the cause of action at issue merely
combined all the previous causes of action and did not add anything to the
complaint by way or fact or theory of recovery. (Rodrigues, supra,
87 Cal.App.3d at p. 498, 501.) But the reasoning of Blickman Turkus is more
persuasive. Noting the jurisprudential maxim that “superfluity does not
vitiate” (Civ. Code, § 3537), the court held “[t]his is the sort of defect
that, if it justifies any judicial intervention at all, is ordinarily dealt
with most economically at trial, or on a dispositive motion such as summary
judgment.” (Blickman Turkus, supra, 162 Cal.App.4th at p. 890.)
 
Accordingly, the court OVERRULES Cao and Everflow’s demurrer to this cause of action.
 
Fraud (Seventh Cause of Action)
 
Cao and Everflow argue Co and Trac’s seventh
cause of action for fraud fails because it is not pled with the required
specificity. The court disagrees.
 
Legal Standard
 
“The elements of fraud, which give rise to
the tort action for deceit, are (a) misrepresentation (false representation,
concealment, or nondisclosure); (b) knowledge of falsity (or ‘scienter’); (c)
intent to defraud, i.e., to induce reliance; (d) justifiable reliance; and (e)
resulting damage.” (Lazar v. Superior Court (1996) 12 Cal.4th 631, 638,
quoting 5 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (9th ed. 1988) Torts, § 676, p. 778.) The
facts constituting the alleged fraud must be alleged factually and specifically
as to every element of fraud, as the policy of “liberal construction” of the
pleadings will not ordinarily be invoked. (Id., at p. 645.) In
alleging a cause of action for fraud, “[t]he specificity requirement means a
plaintiff must allege facts showing how, when, where, to whom, and by what
means the representations were made, and, in the case of a corporate defendant,
the plaintiff must allege the names of the persons who made the
representations, their authority to speak on behalf of the corporation, to whom
they spoke, what they said or wrote, and when the representation was made.” (West
v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (2013) 214 Cal.App.4th 780, 793.)
 
Discussion
 
In this case, Cao and Everflow argue the
Complaint fails to allege fraud with specificity because it does not specifically
allege which defendant made the alleged misrepresentations. (Motion, p. 12:19-28.)
But the Complaint does so by alleging Cao was the one that made the
representations on the behalf of all other defendants. (Complaint, ¶ 9-15, 63.)
 
Accordingly, the court OVERRULES Cao and Everflow’s demurrer to this cause of action.
 
Constructive Fraud (Eighth Cause of
Action)
 
Cao and Everflow contend Co and Trac’s eighth
cause of action for constructive fraud fails because it does not allege the
existence of a fiduciary duty. (Motion, p. 13:8-14.) The court agrees.
 
Legal Standard
 
“The elements of the cause of action for
constructive fraud are: (1) a fiduciary relationship; (2) nondisclosure (breach
of fiduciary duty); (3) intent to deceive, and (4) reliance and resulting
injury (causation).” (Younan v. Equifax Inc. (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 498,
516, fn. 14.)
 
Discussion
 
In this case, the Complaint fails to allege
any facts establishing how Cao and Everflow were in a fiduciary relationship
with Co and Trac. (Complaint, ¶ 70-79.) In their opposition, Co and Trac
contend that a fiduciary relationship arose from their contractor-consumer
relationship. (Opp., p. 14:19-28.) But they fail to point to a single case that
has held such a relationship gives rise to fiduciary duties. In fact,
authorities suggest the opposite. (See, McCauley v. Dennis (1963) 220
Cal.App.2d 627, 636; see also, Gonsalves v. Hodgson (1951) 38 Cal.2d 91,
98-98.)
 
Accordingly, the court SUSTAINS Cao and Everflow’s demurrer to this cause of action without leave to
amend.
 
Attempted Extortion (Ninth Cause of
Action)
 
Cao and Everflow maintain Co and Trac’s ninth
cause of action for attempted extortion fails because it does not name the
family members that they allegedly harassed as parties to this action. (Motion,
p. 13:22-25.) But they fail to establish or explain how Co and Trac’s failure
to name the allegedly harassed family members is fatal to Co and Trac’s cause
of action where the Complaint alleges they allegedly directed threats at Co and
Trac. (Complaint, ¶ 28, 82.)
 
Accordingly, the court OVERRULES Cao and Everflow’s demurrer to this cause of action.
 
CONCLUSION

Based on the
foregoing, Cao and Everflow’s demurrer and motion to strike are SUSTAINED IN
PART with twenty (20) days leave to amend as to the fourth cause of action
and without leave to amend as to the eighth cause of action. The demurrer and
motion to strike are also OVERRULED IN PART as to the first, second,
third, fifth, sixth, seventh, and ninth causes of action.
