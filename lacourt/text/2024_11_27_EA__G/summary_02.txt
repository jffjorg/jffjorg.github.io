And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on Cao and Everflow's demurrer and motion to strike against Co and Trac's complaint. The Judge has sustained Cao and Everflow's demurrer and motion to strike in part, specifically as to the fourth cause of action (negligence) with 20 days' leave to amend, and without leave to amend as to the eighth cause of action (constructive fraud). The Judge has also overruled Cao and Everflow's demurrer and motion to strike in part, specifically as to the first, second, third, fifth, sixth, seventh, and ninth causes of action.

The Judge has found that Co and Trac's complaint is flawed in some causes of action, specifically the fourth cause of action (negligence), which is insufficiently pled. The Judge has also found that Cao and Everflow's demurrer and motion to strike are not justified in some causes of action, specifically the first, second, third, fifth, sixth, seventh, and ninth causes of action.

The Judge has also ruled that Cao and Everflow's demurrer and motion to strike are based on flawed legal arguments, specifically the economic loss rule, which bars recovery for pure economic losses in deference to a contract between the parties. The Judge has also ruled that Cao and Everflow's demurrer and motion to strike are based on a misinterpretation of the pleading requirements, specifically the specificity requirement for alleging fraud.

The Judge has set a hearing date for November 27, 2024, to consider the parties' arguments and evidence.
