STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is an action for conversion. Plaintiff alleges that he contracted
with Defendants to restore a 1955 Chevrolet pickup truck, and that Defendants,
without Plaintiff’s authorization, released the truck to a third-party
automotive workshop, and then lost the truck to that third party via a
mechanic’s lien for failure to pay for those services.
 
Plaintiff, as Judgment Creditor,
moves to amend the judgment to correct the calculated prejudgment interest.
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
            Plaintiff’s
Motion to Amend the Judgment is GRANTED.
 
            The Court
finds that paragraph 6 of the Judgment should be amended to reflect an award of
prejudgment interest to Plaintiff and against Defendant in the amount of
$18,793.44.
 
            The Court
also finds sua sponte that paragraph 8 of the Judgment should be amended
to indicate that Judgment is granted on the sixth cause of action for
negligence only. 
 
            Plaintiff
is directed to prepare an amended judgment in conformity with the Court’s
ruling within 20 days of this order.  
 
DISCUSSION:
 
Plaintiff, as Judgment Creditor,
moves to amend the judgment to correct the calculated prejudgment interest.
 
Under Code of Civil Procedure section
473 subdivision (d), the Court may, on motion of an injured party or on its own
motion, correct clerical mistakes in its judgment or orders as entered so as to
conform to the judgment or order directed. (Code Civ. Proc. § 473(d).) “A
clerical error results when the order or judgment misstates the court’s actual
intent (i.e., error in recording the judgment rendered), and judicial error
results when the order or judgment entered was intended, even though based on
an error of law (i.e., error in rendering the judgment).” (Burch v.
CertainTeed Corp. (2019) 34 Cal.App.5th 341, 346.) 
 
On September 9, 2024, the Court
entered judgment for Plaintiff and against Defendants following a bench trial.
(See September 9, 2024 Judgment.) As reflected in the Court’s Final Statement
of Decision dated July 26, 2024, the Court found against Plaintiff on the first
cause of action for conversion, but found in favor of Plaintiff on the sixth
cause of action for negligence, awarding Plaintiff $79,800 in damages plus
prejudgment interest “at an annual rate of 7 percent from March 16, 2021, to
the present.” (Plaintiff’s Exh. C. p.6 [Final Statement of Decision].) The
Judgment as entered awarded a total of $13,708.80 as prejudgment interest. (See
Judgment p.2.) However, at a rate of 7% per annum from March 16, 2021 to July
26, 2024, the correct amount of prejudgment interest on $79,800 in damages was
$18,793.44 ($79,800 x 0.07 divided by 365 days/year x 1,228 days.) The Court
concurs with Plaintiff that the judgment, as entered does not accurately
reflect the Court’s Final Statement of Decision, and, therefore, that there is
a clerical error as to the correct amount of prejudgment interest. 
 
The Court also independently
observes that the Judgment, as entered, states that judgment is entered in
Plaintiff’s favor on both the first cause of action for conversion and
the sixth cause of action for negligence, contrary to the Court’s ruling which
only found in favor of plaintiff on the negligence claim. (See Plaintiff’s Exh.
C. p.6.) The Court therefore finds sua sponte that the judgment contains
a further clerical error in that it does not accurately reflect the Court’s
findings on the first cause of action. 
 
CONCLUSION: 
 
            Accordingly, Plaintiff’s
Motion to Amend the Judgment is GRANTED.
 
            The Court
finds that paragraph 6 of the Judgment should be amended to reflect an award of
prejudgment interest to Plaintiff and against Defendant in the amount of
$18,793.44.
 
            The Court
also finds sua sponte that paragraph 8 of the Judgment should be amended
to indicate that Judgment is granted on the sixth cause of action for
negligence only. 
 
            Plaintiff
is directed to prepare an amended judgment in conformity with the Court’s
ruling within 20 days of this order.  
 
            The Court
sets a non-appearance case review to review the proposed Amended Judgment for
December 2, 2024.
            
            Moving
Party to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
