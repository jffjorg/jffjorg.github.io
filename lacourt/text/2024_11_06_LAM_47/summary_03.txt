And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion of Attorney Cristina M. Saca, counsel for Kittrich Corporation and Robert Friedland, to be relieved as counsel. The judge found that the moving counsel has demonstrated good cause for withdrawal, citing a breach of a material term of the agreement between the defendants and counsel, and the clients' refusal to execute a substitution of attorney. The judge noted that the risk of prejudice to the parties at this juncture is low, as trial has not yet been set and the only other hearings scheduled are a Case Management Conference and a Motion to Compel Responses to Requests for Production. The judge ordered that Attorney Saca serve notice to all parties and file proof of service of the court's ruling and orders with the court.
