And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling grants State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company's motion for leave to intervene in the case. The original complaint was filed by Seanna Stewart and Jordynn-Bell Stewart against Yuan Jeanie Son on May 23, 2022, alleging damages resulting from an auto accident on March 16, 2021. State Farm is seeking to intervene because it was the insurer of the defendant at the time of the accident and can be liable for the damages. The court finds that State Farm's motion is timely and supported by an appropriate substantive showing, and that State Farm's interests are not adequately represented by the defendant, who is nonresponsive. As a result, the court grants State Farm's motion to intervene and orders State Farm to file a proposed complaint-in-intervention within 10 days of this order.
