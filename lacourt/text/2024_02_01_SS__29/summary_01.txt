And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the request to specially set the hearing for the motion for summary adjudication, as the court does not have any available dates for a summary adjudication hearing before the trial date. However, the judge has granted the request to continue the trial, finding that the defendants have a right to have their motion for summary adjudication heard before trial. The trial date is advanced and continued to a date in early September 2024, and all other deadlines remain in place except for the deadline for the hearing on the motion for summary adjudication.
