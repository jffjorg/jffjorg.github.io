The judge has relied on the plaintiff's responses to discovery, which indicate that the total amount of special damages for medical treatment is $5,190 and the estimate for property damage to the plaintiff's vehicle is $6,817.36. The judge has also noted that the plaintiff has not alleged a specific damages sum in the complaint and that there has been no opposition to the motion. The judge has ordered the case to be reclassified and transferred to a limited jurisdiction court.
