Kwan and Ki Tak P. Leung to invest in the Riverbend International School, Inc., which operated a private science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) boarding school for grades 9 through 12 in Atchison, Kansas, and was owned and managed by defendants KLL Investments and Kansas Education Holdings, LLC, which were in turn managed by the individual defendants.  Plaintiff alleges that she invested $550,000.00 in Kansas Education Holdings, based on assurances that she would become a shareholder in Kansas Education Holdings, share in the profits of the operation, and would be eligible as a EB-5 shareholder to apply for a green card.    Plaintiff alleges that despite defendant’s promises and assurances that the school was operating at a profit, and the partners would be exploring opening another campus in California, and that plaintiff’s application for a green card would be approved, defendants did not list plaintiff as a shareholder, leading to plaintiff’s loss in the investment money and its benefit, and also leading to plaintiff not being qualified as an EB-5 investor, resulting in the denial of plaintiffs application by the US immigration services.  Plaintiff alleges that the defendants misappropriated plaintiff’s investment money, transferring it from the bank account of Riverbend International School immediately after deposit, for their own personal use and their own benefit.  Plaintiff has since learned that the school, including the property, has been auctioned by Atchison County to pay off property taxes and wages owed to teachers.   The file shows that this demurrer was originally scheduled to be heard on May 10, 2024, but was continued to this date pursuant to an ex parte application by plaintiff to continue the hearing date. On June 7, 2024, the court granted a Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel filed by plaintiff’s attorney.  Plaintiff is evidently now representing herself. There has been no timely written opposition filed to this demurrer. ANALYSIS:Statute of Limitations  Defendants Carol W. Kwan and Ki Tak P. Leung argue that the entire complaint and all causes of action are barred by the applicable statutes of limitations.  Specifically, defendants argue that the causes of action for breach of contract or account stated must be brought within four years of breach, and an action based on oral contract must be brought within two years of breach pursuant to CCP sections 337 (a)-(b) and 339, and that fraud and conversion causes of action must be brought within three years of discovery of the alleged conversion or fraud under CCP section 338(c)-(d).    Defendants argue that the complaint discloses a bar to recovery because it concedes that “From the year 2018 to early 2023, Li and Plaintiff were in contact with Leung and Kwan.  Li and Plaintiff sent messages to Leung and Kwan to ask for an update regarding Plaintiff’s investment and its returns, but they had no direct reply to Plaintiff and Li’s inquiries.”   [Complaint, para. 55].   Defendants argue that plaintiff filed her complaint on January 23, 2024, even though she knew at some time as early as 2018 that something was amiss.  It is not clear from these allegations that any particular cause of action would be barred, as the allegations themselves encompass “early 2023,” which could fall within one year of the filing of the action in January of 2024, so falling within any potential statute of limitations.   In Marshall v. Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1397, the Second District reversed the trial court’s judgment of dismissal of a legal malpractice action after sustaining a demurrer based on the bar of the one-year statute of limitations, and directed the trial court to overrule the demurrer.  The Second District set forth the following standard in connection with a demurrer based on a statute of limitations:“On appeal from a judgment of dismissal following the sustaining of a demurrer without leave to amend, the reviewing court must accept as true not only those facts alleged in the complaint but also facts that may be implied or inferred from those expressly alleged. (Rose v. Royal Ins. Co. (1991) 2 Cal.App.4th 709, 716 [3 Cal.Rptr.2d 483].)  A demurrer based on a statute of limitations will not lie where the action may be, but is not necessarily, barred. (Moseley v. Abrams (1985) 170 Cal.App.3d 355, 359-360 [216 Cal.Rptr. 40].) In order for the bar of the statute of limitations to be raised by demurrer, the defect must clearly and affirmatively appear on the face of the complaint; it is not enough that the complaint shows that the action may be barred. (Mangini v. Aerojet-General Corp. (1991) 230 Cal.App.3d 1125, 1155 [281 Cal.Rptr. 827].)”Marshall, at 1403. The Second District in Roman v. County of Los Angeles (2000) 85 Cal.App.4th 316 followed Marshall in reversing a trial court’s order dismissing causes of action in a racial discrimination case on the ground the claims were barred by the applicable statute of limitations, observing:“A general demurrer based on the statute of limitations is only permissible where the dates alleged in the complaint show that the action is barred by the statute of limitations. (See Saliter v. Pierce Brothers Mortuaries (1978) 81 Cal.App.3d 292, 300 [146 Cal.Rptr. 271].) The running of the statute must appear “clearly and affirmatively” from the dates alleged. It is not sufficient that the complaint might be barred. (Marshall v. Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1397, 1403 [44 Cal.Rptr.2d 339].) If the dates  establishing the running of the statute of limitations do not clearly appear in the complaint, there is no ground for general demurrer. The proper remedy “is to ascertain the factual basis of the contention through discovery and, if necessary, file a motion for summary judgment ....” (United Western Medical Centers v. Superior Court (1996) 42 Cal.App.4th 500, 505 [49 Cal.Rptr.2d 682].)”Roman, at 324-325, italics in original.  Here, it is not clear from the pleading that any particular claim is necessarily barred.   Defendants argue that even if plaintiff here intends to rely on an argument that there was a delay in discovery of defendants’ alleged misconduct, such a delay must be alleged with specificity.  A review of the complaint shows that it includes a very detailed account of representations and assurances received by plaintiff, while plaintiff was residing in China, concerning awards the school was receiving and that it was thriving, with a business plan proposed for a second school, and the complaint also details plaintiff learning for the first time in June of 2023 that her immigration application had been denied, prompting plaintiff to talk to another member of the investment entities, who revealed details of the wrongdoing to plaintiff for the first time.  [Complaint, paras. 50-75].  The following day, it is alleged that Li was in contact with Leung, who provided further details concerning the situation.  [Complaint, paras. 78-79].   The allegations are sufficiently specific to support an inference that there was a reasonable delay in discovery, and if defendants want to pursue the argument further that the delay was not reasonable, they may proceed as the Second District suggested in Roman to ascertain the factual basis of plaintiff’s allegations through discovery and, if necessary, file a motion for summary judgment.   The demurrer on this ground overruled.     Sixth Cause of Action—Breach of Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing It is recognized that “Every contract imposes upon each party a duty of good faith and fair dealing in its performance and its enforcement.”  Carma Developers (Cal.), Inc. v. Marathon Development California, Inc. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 342, 371, quoting Restatement 2nd Contracts, §205.  The elements of a claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing are:1) That plaintiff and defendant entered into a contract;2) That plaintiff did all, or substantially all of the significant things that the contract required plaintiff to do or that plaintiff was excused from having to do those things;3) That all conditions required for defendant’s performance had occurred;4) That defendant unfairly interfered with plaintiff’s right to receive the benefits of the contract; and 5) That plaintiff was harmed by defendant’s conduct. See CACI 325.  These elements have all been alleged here.  [Complaint, paras. 127-129].   Defendants argue that where allegations do not go beyond the statement of a mere contract breach, rely on the same alleged acts, and seek the same damages as already claimed in a breach of contract cause of action, the allegations in support of a claim for breach of implied covenant may be disregarded as superfluous.  The cause of action alleges that defendants engaged in conduct which prevented plaintiff from receiving the benefits under the contract by failing to list plaintiff as a shareholder.  [Complaint, para. 131].  While this overlaps with the allegations in the breach of contract causes of action, this matter is currently at the pleading stage, and it is not to be improper for plaintiff to allege here that conduct which is alleged to breach the express covenants of the arrangement between the parties in the alternative breaches the implied covenant, in the event discovery or future legal proceedings suggest the term requiring the designation of plaintiff as a shareholder to obtain the EB-5 status does not technically transgress the express terms of the alleged contract itself, but frustrates plaintiff’s rights to the benefit of the contract.   Under the liberal rules of pleading, parties are permitted to plead duplicative, alternative, or even inconsistent causes of action.   See, Jackson v. County of Los Angeles (1997) 60 Cal.App.4th 171, 181.  The demurrer on this ground accordingly is overruled.  Eighth Cause of Action—Unjust Enrichment  Defendants argue that this cause of action fails because there is no independent cause of action for unjust enrichment. Defendants rely on Melchoir v. New Line Productions, Inc.  ( 2003, 2nd Dist.)  106 Cal. App.4th 779, in which the Second District affirmed the granting of summary judgment, noting:“In addition, as the trial court observed, there is no cause of action in California for unjust enrichment. "The phrase 'Unjust Enrichment' does not describe a theory of recovery, but an effect: the result of a failure to make restitution under circumstances where it is equitable to do so." (Lauriedale Associates, Ltd. v. Wilson (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1439, 1448 [9 Cal. Rptr. 2d 774].) Unjust enrichment is " 'a general principle, underlying various legal doctrines and remedies,' " rather than a remedy itself. (Dinosaur Development, Inc. v. White (1989) 216 Cal. App. 3d 1310, 1315 [265 Cal. Rptr. 525].) It is synonymous with restitution. (Id. at p. 1314.)”Melchoir, at 793. However, in Lectrodryer v. SeoulBank (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 723, 726, the Second District affirmed a trial court judgment based on a jury verdict in favor of plaintiff, determining:“Evidence also supported the conclusion that Lectrodryer satisfied the elements for a claim of unjust enrichment: receipt of a benefit and unjust retention of the benefit at the expense of another. (First Nationwide Savings v. Perry (1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 1657, 1662-1663 [15 Cal.Rptr.2d 173].).”Lectrodryer, at 726.  The Second District accordingly recognized an independent unjust enrichment cause of action.  There is some disagreement concerning the existence of such a stand-alone cause of action in California.  In fact, in Wilder v. JP Morgan Chase Bank, NA (2009) 2009 U.S. Lexis  124242, a federal district court criticized the broad holding that such a cause of action is not recognized in California, summarizing the conflicting authorities on this issue as follows:“Defendant urges the Court to dismiss this claim based on the argument that there is no unjust enrichment cause of action in California as a matter of law.  California courts have provided conflicting direction as to whether a separate cause of action exists for unjust enrichment. Some courts have held as an absolute that no such cause of action exists in California. See Melchior v. New Line Prod., Inc., 1601 Cal. App. 4th 779,793,131 Cal. Rptr. 2d 347 (Cal Ct. App. 2003)("[t]here is no cause of action in California for unjust enrichment"); Jogani v. Superior Court, 165 Cal. App. 4th 901, 911, 81 Cal. Rptr. 3d 503 (Cal. Ct. App. 2004). However, other various courts, including the Ninth Circuit, have held just the opposite. See, e.g., Western Pac. R. Corp. v. Western Pac. R. Co., 206 F.2d 495, 498 (9th Cir. 1953) ("it is of course true that the California courts, in common with authorities generally, recognize a cause of action based on unjust enrichment"); Gerlinger v.Amazon.com, Inc., 311 F. Supp. 2d 838, 856 (N.D. Cal. 2004) ("[u]nder California law, unjust enrichment is an action in quasi-contract") (citing Paracor Fin. v. Gen. Elec. Capital Corp., 96 F.3d 1151, 1167 (9th Cir. 1996)); Nordberg v. Trilegiant Corp., 445 F. Supp. 2d 1082, 1100 (N.D. Cal. 2006) (courts holding that no cause of action for unjust enrichment exists have focused on semantic arguments; cause of action for unjust enrichment can be understood as a proper and valid cause of action for restitution); F.D.I.C. v. Dintino, 167 Cal. App. 4th 333, 346, 84 Cal. Rptr. 3d 38 (Cal. Ct. App. 2008) (upholding unjust enrichment cause of action). The Court finds that the weight of authority indicates that California law recognizes a cause of action for unjust enrichment/restitution.”Wilder at 124242.Given the split of authority, and the practice of the courts of appeal in evaluating an unjust enrichment cause of action as a claim for restitution, this court is reluctant to at the pleading stage to sustain a demurrer on the ground the cause of action is not a recognized cause of action. Hence, the court defer any determination of this issue following the development of actual proof in this matter. The demurrer on this ground and to this cause of action accordingly is overruled. RULING:[No Opposition]Defendants Carol W.
