**Significant Statements**
  - "Partition is a matter of absolute right and in the absence of waiver or estoppel or other equitable defenses, each co-tenant in ownership has the right to petition for partition of the common property." (Miller and Starr, California Real Estate (4th Ed.) ยง 40:126)
  - "A co-owner of property has an absolute right to partition unless barred by a valid waiver." (LEG Investments v. Boxler (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 484, at 493)
  - "Equitable defenses. The element of unfairness that precludes an absolute right of partition under various circumstances often results from the fact that a court ordered sale of the property in a partition action is a sale of the entire interest in the property and not merely a sale of the individual interests of the co-owners." (Miller and Starr, California Real Estate (4th Ed.) ยง 11:20)
