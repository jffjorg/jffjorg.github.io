And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the petition for approval of the compromise of the claim or action for the minors, Jacob and Felicity Daco. The petition alleges that the defendants, Arman Sargsyan and Lusine Bushnakyan, were negligent in the operation and ownership of a vehicle, which resulted in the children's injuries and damages.

The court has reviewed the settlement agreements and finds that the settlements are reasonable and in the best interests of the minors. The court has also reviewed the attorneys' fees and finds that the fees are reasonable and justified.

The court grants the petition for approval of the compromise of the claim or action for Jacob Daco and Felicity Daco. The court orders that the settlement agreements be approved and that the proceeds be distributed as set forth in the agreements.

The court notes that the defendants have not opposed the petition and that the parties have agreed to the settlement agreements. The court also notes that the attorneys' fees have been reduced from the original agreement to 25% of the gross settlement.

The court orders that the parties appear remotely through LACourtConnect on the date set forth in the order.
