And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Dani Robin Lancer v. City of Beverly Hills, granting the City's motion for summary judgment. The City argued that there is no evidence of a dangerous condition and no notice of the alleged condition, and the Judge agrees. The Judge finds that the defect in the sidewalk is trivial as a matter of law, and that the City is not liable for the plaintiff's injury. The Judge notes that the plaintiff was able to observe the condition without any visual obstructions, and that the defect has no jagged breaks or cracks. The Judge also considers the nature and quality of the defect, and concludes that it is not a substantial risk of injury. The Judge grants the City's motion for summary judgment, and orders the City to file and serve a proposed judgment within 10 days.
