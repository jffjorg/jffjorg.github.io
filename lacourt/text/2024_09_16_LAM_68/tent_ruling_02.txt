LLC
 
SUMMARY
OF ACTION
Plaintiff Rex Wise alleges defendants Solgen Construction,
LLC, Sunlight Financial, LLC and Cross River Bank, denies ever executing a
30-year loan agreement for the financing of solar panels to Plaintiff’s
residence. Plaintiff sought to cancel the contracts, but defendants refused. 
 
Plaintiff seeks a Public Injunction enjoining Solgen
Construction, LLC from engaging in solar panel installations without adhering
to certain standards, due to prior fraudulent activities.
 
On August 1 and 24, 2023, Plaintiff filed a complaint and
first amended complaint for Fraudulent Concealment; Negligence; Violations of
The Elder Abuse And Dependent Adult Civil Protection Act (Welfare &
Institutions Code §15610.07, Et Seq.); Violations Of The Rosenthal Fair Debt
Collection Practices Act (Civil Code §1788, Et Seq.); Violations Of The Home
Solicitation Sales Act (Civil Code §1689.5, Et Seq.); Violations Of Business
And Professions Code §7150, et seq.; Violations Of The Truth In Lending Act (15
U.S.C. § 1601, Et Seq.); Violations Of The Credit Services Act (Civil Code
§1789.10, Et Seq.); and, Violations Of The Unfair Competition Law (Business
& Professions Code §17200, et seq.)
 
On November 1, 2023, Sunlight Financial LLC filed a notice
of stay of proceedings based on the filing of a Chapter 11 Bankruptcy petition
on October 31, 2023. On November 2, 2023, the court stayed the entire case. On
January 16, 2024, Sunlight Financial filed a notice of termination of stay. On
April 11, 2024, the court denied the motion of Defendants Sunlight Financial
LLC and Cross River Bank compel arbitration. Sunlight Financial LLC and Cross
River Bank answered the complaint on May 13, 2024.
 
RULING: Granted.
Plaintiff Rex Wise moves for an extension of time to request
a default judgment against Solgen Construction, LLC, until after completion of
the trial against the appearing defendants, Sunlight Financial LLC and Cross
River Bank. Plaintiff filed a notice of non-receipt of position.
 
“In an action against several defendants, the Court may, in
its discretion, render judgment against one or more of them, leaving the action
to proceed against the others, whenever a several judgment is proper.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 579.) 
 
Plaintiff moves to postpone due to the “interconnectedness”
of the parties. More specifically, Plaintiff relies on an agency theory of
liability for six of the nine causes of action, so any judgment against the
appearing parties will “necessarily implicate” Solgen. “The rule is definitely
established that where there are two or more defendants and the liability of
one is dependent upon that of the other the default of one of them does not
preclude his having the benefit of his codefendants establishing, after a
contested hearing, the nonexistence of the controlling fact; in such case the
defaulting defendant is entitled to have judgment in his favor along with the
successful contesting defendant.” (Adams Mfg. & Engineering Co. v. Coast
Centerless Grinding Co. (1960) 184 Cal.App.2d 649, 655.)
 
An argument can be made as to the necessity of the motion in
that a previously obtained judgment can be amended, thereby rendering the
subject motion superfluous. “The court erred in refusing to exercise this
discretion and vacate the judgment entered by the clerk against appellant. If
the trial court sees fit to render another judgment of like effect its action
will be valid unless it involves an abuse of discretion. If it refuses to do
so, the case can proceed to trial upon the issues tendered by the answers of
the other defendants, and at its conclusion a judgment may be rendered settling
the rights and obligations of all the parties, including those of appellant. (Trans-Pacific
Trading Co. v. Patsy Frock & Romper Co. (1922) 189 Cal. 509, 513; see Morehouse
v. Wanzo (1968) 266 Cal.App.2d 846, 852.)
 
The court declines to consider unmade challenges and
unopposed positions. The motion is therefore granted. The court grants
Plaintiff leave to defer proceeding with a default judgment against Solgen
Construction, LLC, until the time of the trial. The court will address the
default judgment at the time of trial. Meanwhile the court dockets shows no
entry of even a request for entry of default.
