And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by the defendants, DirecTV, LLC, AT&T Services, Inc., and AT&T, Inc. The demurrer challenges the sufficiency of the 8th and 9th causes of action in the complaint, which allege intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress. The judge has sustained the demurrer, but with leave to amend.

The judge found that the emotional distress claims are subsumed within the workers' compensation preclusion provisions, and that the plaintiff's allegations of emotional distress resulting from discriminatory practices or conduct in violation of public policy are outside the scope of the workers' compensation exclusivity provisions.

The judge has given the plaintiff 30 days to amend the two challenged causes of action, but has prohibited the plaintiff from adding any new causes of action. The defendants will have 10 days to answer the remaining causes of action in the complaint after the amendment deadline has lapsed.
