SUMMARY
OF ACTION:

Plaintiff Victor Perez was employed by
third party On Time Installer, as a “Premises Technician” doing contract work
on behalf of Defendants DirecTV, LLC, AT&T Services, Inc., and AT&T,
Inc. In 2017, Plaintiff sustained a back injury on the job, and a second
unspecified injury in 2021. Plaintiff received workers’ compensation provided
medical treatment, with the second injury leading to a 15 pound lifting limit,
and no ladders or crawling work limits as well.
 
Plaintiff elected to take medical leave.
After medical leave ran out, Defendants extended the leave period, but
ultimately informed Plaintiff to either find a new position within the company
or face termination. Plaintiff was unable to secure a new position. Plaintiff
was terminated on August 15, 2022. 
 
On
March 26, 2024, Plaintiff filed a complaint for 1. Disability Discrimination in
Violation of FEHA; 2. Failure to Engage in the Interactive Process in Violation
of FEHA; 3. Failure to Provide Reasonable Accommodations in Violation of FEHA;
4. Retaliation in Violation of FEHA; 5. Wrongful Termination in Violation of
Public Policy; 6. Failure to Prevent Discrimination and Retaliation in
Violation of FEHA; 7. Retaliation in Violation of Labor Code § 98.6; and 8.
Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress; and 9. Negligent Infliction of
Emotional Distress.
 
RECOMMENDED
RULING:
Sustained with Leave to Amend
Defendants
DirecTV, LLC, AT&T Services, Inc., and AT&T, Inc. submit the subject
demurrer to the eighth and ninth causes of action in the complaint for Intentional
Infliction of Emotional Distress, and Negligent Infliction of Emotional
Distress. Defendant brings the demurrer on multiple grounds, including Workers’
Compensation claim preclusion, and lack of sufficient facts.
 
Plaintiff
in opposition contends the case is not precluded by Workers’ Compensation law,
as the subject conduct alleged the operative complaint falls beyond the
“compensation bargain” governing the applicability of said rules. Plaintiff
asserts the emotional distress and unfair business practices claims present
sufficient facts. 
 
Defendant
in reply reiterates the Workers’ Compensation preclusion argument, and
challenges to the individual causes of action. 
 
A
demurrer is an objection to a pleading, the grounds for which are apparent from
either the face of the complaint or a matter of which the court may take
judicial notice. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.30, subd. (a); see also Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311,
318.) The purpose of a demurrer is to challenge the sufficiency of a pleading
“by raising questions of law.” (Postley
v. Harvey (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 280, 286.) “In the construction of a
pleading, for the purpose of determining its effect, its allegations must be
liberally construed, with a view to substantial justice between the parties.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 452.) The court “ ‘ “treat[s] the demurrer as admitting all
material facts properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions
of fact or law . . . .” ’ ” (Berkley v.
Dowds (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 518, 525.) In applying these standards, the
court liberally construes the complaint to determine whether a cause of action
has been stated.  (Picton v. Anderson Union High School Dist. (1996) 50 Cal.App.4th
726, 733.)
 
“A demurrer for uncertainty is strictly
construed, even where a complaint is in some respects uncertain, because
ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery procedures.” (Khoury v. Maly's of California, Inc. (1993)
14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616; Williams v.
Beechnut Nutrition Corp. (1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 135, 139 [“[U]nder our liberal pleading rules, where the
complaint contains substantive factual allegations sufficiently apprising
defendant of the issues it is being asked to meet, a demurrer for uncertainty
should be overruled or plaintiff given leave to amend.]
 
Workers’
Compensation Preclusion
Injury claims are subject to the exclusive
provisions of the Workers’ Compensation statutory provisions, where the injury
to the employee occurs as a result of a “service growing out of and incidental”
to employment, and the employee is “acting within the course” of employment.
(Lab. Code, § 3600, subd. (a)(2); Charles
J. Vacanti, M.D., Inc. v. State Comp. Ins. Fund (2001) 24 Cal.4th 800, 813.) The injury must cause a disability and/or require medical
attention. (Gomez v. Acquistapace
(1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 740, 748.) “The employee is afforded relatively swift and
certain payment of benefits to cure or relieve the effects of industrial injury
without having to prove fault but, in exchange, gives up the wider range of
damages potentially available in tort.” (Fermino v. Fedco, Inc. (1994) 7 Cal.4th 701, 708; Shoemaker v. Myers (1990) 52 Cal.3d 1, 16.) The exclusive remedies may not apply where “the
employer…stepped out of their proper roles.” (Shoemaker v. Myers, supra,
52 Cal.3d at p. 16.) Emotional distress in general may
be subject to workers’ compensation preclusion, but claims of emotional
distress arising from discriminatory practices or conduct in violation of
public policy remains outside preclusion defenses. (Miklosy v. Regents of University of California (2008) 44 Cal.4th 876, 902; Livitsanos v. Superior Court (1992) 2 Cal.4th 744, 754, 756; Cole v. Fair Oaks Fire Protection Dist. (1987) 43 Cal.3d 148, 160.) 
 
Plaintiff maintains the
course of conduct directing Plaintiff towards the ultimately futile task of
finding a position accommodating the Workers’ Compensation physician imposed physical
limitations constituted a pretense for ultimately terminating Plaintiff. The
resulting emotional distress from said course of improper conduct in violation
of public policy constitutes the basis for emotional distress.
 
The court appreciates
the reliance on the allegedly wrongful conduct supporting the unchallenged wrongful
employment practice causes of action, but both the complaint and opposition
conflate the role of the public policy violation provision in the Workers’
Compensation statute. The emotional distress resulting from the alleged public
policy violations in no way depends on said wrongful violations of employment
practices. The distress was the result of Defendants allegedly “executing a
retaliatory scheme” and/or “negligently” causing harm due to the “employment
environment.” Such claims clearly articulate separate and distinct claims
outside the exemptions. The emotional distress claims are therefore subsumed
within the Workers’ Compensation preclusion provisions. (Miklosy v. Regents
of University of California, supra, 44 Cal.4th at pp. 902-903; Livitsanos v. Superior Court, supra, 2 Cal.4th at pp. 754, 756; Shoemaker v. Myers, supra,
52 Cal.3d at p. 25; Cole v. Fair Oaks Fire Protection Dist. (1987) 43 Cal.3d at p. 160; Yau v. Santa Margarita Ford, Inc. (2014) 229 Cal.App.4th 144, 161-162.)
 
The complaint otherwise
sufficiently alleges outrageous conduct and the elements for intentional
infliction of emotional distress, and also alleges a basis for negligent
infliction of emotional distress. The court declines to substantively further
address the challenge to the sufficiency, however, given the workers’
compensation preclusion finding. 
 
The
demurrer is sustained with 30 days leave amend. Plaintiff may only amend the
two challenged cause of action, and may NOT add any new causes of action. (Harris
v. Wachovia Mortgage, FSB (2010) 185 Cal.App.4th 1018, 1023.) Any new
causes of action added without leave of court may be subject to a motion to
strike. Material changes to the operative complaint seeking to alter the basis
of the claim may also be subject to a demurrer under the sham pleading
standard. If Plaintiff elects to not file a first amended complaint, Defendants
shall answer the remaining causes of action of the complaint within 10 days of
the lapse of the 30 day amendment deadline (e.g. 40 days from the date of this
order).
 
“In
response to a demurrer and prior to the case being at issue, a complaint or
cross-complaint shall not be amended more than three times, absent an offer to
the trial court as to such additional facts to be pleaded that there is a
reasonable possibility the defect can be cured to state a cause of action. The
three-amendment limit shall not include an amendment made without leave of the
court pursuant to Section 472,
provided the amendment is made before a demurrer to the original complaint or
cross-complaint is filed.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (e)(1).) While the
subject motion constitutes the first review of the subject action, the court
cites to the standard upon the potential for a future challenge to the first
amended complaint.

Defendants to give notice.
