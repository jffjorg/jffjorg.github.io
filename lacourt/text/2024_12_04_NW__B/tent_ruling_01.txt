I.      
BACKGROUND  
            On November 9, 2021, Pedram Shaerzadeh
(“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint in the instant action against Defendants Allison
Alisa Hindin Newmark (“Allison”), Lewis C. Newmark (“Lewis”), and Does 1 to 50 (collectively
“Defendants”) alleging two causes of action: (1) motor vehicle negligence; and
(2) general negligence. Plaintiff alleges that, on or about November 25, 2019, due
to Defendants’ negligence in operating their motor vehicle, collided with
Plaintiff’s vehicle, causing injuries thereof.
            On June 7, 2024, the matter was
assigned to the Honorable Judge Moskowitz in Department B of Van Nuys
Courthouse East, effective June 24, 2024.
            On August 12, 2024, Defendant
Allison filed the instant motion for leave to file a cross-complaint.
On
November 19, 2024, Plaintiff filed their opposition.
            On November 25, 2024, Allison filed
their reply.
 
II.         
LEGAL
STANDARD
Generally, a party must file a cross-complaint against any of the
parties who filed the complaint or cross-complaint against him or her before or
at the same time as the answer to the complaint or cross-complaint. (Cal. Code
of Civ. Proc.§ 428.50(a).)
The court may grant leave to file a cross-complaint if the failure to
plead a cause of action was the result of oversight, inadvertence, mistake,
neglect, or other cause. (CCP § 426.50.) Where the proposed cross-complaint
arises out of the same transaction as plaintiff’s claim, the court must grant
leave to file the cross-complaint provided the defendant is acting in good
faith. (Ibid.) Judicial policy favors resolution of all disputed matters
between the parties in the same lawsuit and discretion will usually be
exercised liberally to permit amendment of the pleadings. (See Nestle v.
Santa Monica (1972) 6 Cal.3d 920, 929.)
A party may obtain leave of court to file a cross-complaint at any time during
a lawsuit, and leave may be granted in the interest of justice. (CCP §§ 426.50,
428.50; see also Sidney v. Superior Court (1988) 198 Cal.App.3d 710,
718.) “To the extent practicable, all supporting memorandums and declarations
must be attached to the notice of motion.” (Cal. Rules of Court Rule
3.1113(j).)
 
III.      
DISCUSSION 
Allison seeks to
file a cross-complaint asserting four causes of action: (1) equitable
indemnity; (2) contribution; (3) comparative fault and apportionment; and (4)
declaratory relief. (Davis Decl. ¶ 4; Exh. A [proposed cross-complaint].)
Allison is unaware of the true name of Cross-Defendant as investigation into
the underlying car accident remains ongoing. (Motion p. 1:7-8.) Once
Cross-Defendant's true identity is known, Allison will file a Roe amendment. (Ibid.
at 1:8-9.)
Allison
asserts her failure to file her cross-complaint at an earlier date is due to
impossibility. Allison filed her answer to Plaintiff’s complaint on January 23,
2023. Through discovery, Allison learned that, on August 2, 2023, Plaintiff was
involved in a subsequent accident. (Davis Decl. ¶ 6.) Allison believes the
individual involved in the subsequent accident may have caused, contributed, or
worsened Plaintiff’s alleged injuries. (Motion p. 1:10-13.) Upon learning this
information, Allison unsuccessfully attempted to resolve the issue outside of
court, then promptly filed the instant motion.
In
opposition, Plaintiff claims that Allison’s motion should be denied because it
fails to state valid causes of action. A court has discretion to deny leave to
file a cross-complaint where the proposed pleading fails to state a valid cause
of action. (California Casualty General Ins. Co. v. Sup. Ct. (1985) 173
Cal.App. 274, 280-281.) Allison’s cross-complaint is based on a theory
of equitable indemnity. Unless the prospective indemnitor and indemnitee are
jointly and severally liable to the plaintiff, there is no basis for equitable
indemnity. (Munoz v. Davis (1983) 141 Cal.App.3d 420, 425.) A party who
owes no duty of care to the tort plaintiff has no liability to that plaintiff,
and therefore, cannot be liable to a tortfeasor for equitable indemnity. (Seamen’s
Bank v. Superior Court (1987) 190 Cal.App.3d 1485, 1491-1492.)
Here,
the alleged individual involved in Plaintiff’s August 2, 2023, accident, is not
jointly and severally liable for the underlying accident which occurred on
November 25, 2019. This accident is the basis of Plaintiff’s causes of actions
against Allison. Allison makes no claim that the unknown individual is in any
way involved with the November 25, 2019, accident. Therefore, Allison’s
cross-complaint fails to state a valid cause of action.
 
IV.   
CONCLUSION
            The proposed cross-complaint fails
to state any valid causes of action. Accordingly, Allison’s motion for leave to
file cross-complaint is DENIED.
            Moving party to give notice.
