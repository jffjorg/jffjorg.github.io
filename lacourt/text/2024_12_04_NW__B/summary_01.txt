And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Defendant Allison's motion for leave to file a cross-complaint. The proposed cross-complaint fails to state any valid causes of action. The judge found that Defendant Allison's theory of equitable indemnity is flawed because the alleged individual involved in the subsequent accident is not jointly and severally liable for the underlying accident, and therefore, cannot be liable to a tortfeasor for equitable indemnity. The judge also noted that Defendant Allison has failed to state a valid cause of action because she has made no claim that the unknown individual is in any way involved with the November 25, 2019, accident.
