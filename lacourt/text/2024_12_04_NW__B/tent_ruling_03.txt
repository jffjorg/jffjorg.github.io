On May 17, 2022, Plaintiff Marshall
Krupp (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendants Kroenke Sports &
Entertainment LLC (“Kroenke”), StadCo LA, LLC (“StadCo”), the Chargers Football
Company (“Chargers”), the Contemporary Services Corporation (“Contemporary
Services”), and Does 1 to 50 (collectively “Defendants”) alleging two causes of
action: (1) premises liability; and (2) negligence.
 
On October 27, 2023, Defendants Kroenke,
StadCo, and the Chargers filed a motion for summary judgment on Plaintiff’s
complaint.
 
On November 8, 2023, Contemporary
Services filed a motion for summary judgment on Plaintiff’s complaint.
 
On June 5, 2024, the action was
reassigned to the Honorable Karen Moskowitz in Department B at Van Nuys
Courthouse East, effective June 24, 2024.
 
On August 30, 2024, Kroenke, StadCo,
and the Chargers’s motion for summary judgment was granted in their favor. On
the same date, Contemporary Service’s motion for summary judgment was also
granted in their favor.
 
On October 9, 2024, Contemporary Services filed a Memorandum of Costs.
 
On November 1, 2024, Plaintiff filed a
motion to strike and tax Contemporary Service’s costs.
 
On November 19, 2024, Contemporary
Services filed their opposition.
 
On November 22, 2024, Plaintiff filed
their reply.
 
[Tentative] Ruling
 
Plaintiff’s motion to strike and tax
costs is GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.
 
LEGAL STANDARD
 
In general, the prevailing party is
entitled as a matter of right to recover costs for suit in any action or
proceeding.  (Cal. Code of Civ. Proc.
§1032(b); Santisas v. Goodin (1998) 17 Cal.4th 599, 606; Scott Co. of
Calif. v. Blount, Inc. (1999) 20 Cal.4th 1103, 1108.)  The term prevailing party is defined by
statute to include: the party with a net monetary recovery; a defendant who is
dismissed from the action; a defendant where neither plaintiff nor defendant
recovers anything; and a defendant as against those plaintiffs who do not
recover any relief against that defendant. (CCP § 1032(a)(4).)
 
For costs to be allowable under CCP §
1033.5, they must be reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation, as
opposed to merely convenient or beneficial to its preparation, and they must be
reasonable in amount. (CCP § 1033.5(c)(2).) An item not specifically allowable
under § 1033.5(a) nor prohibited under subdivision (b) may nevertheless be
recoverable in the discretion of the court if they meet the above requirements
(i.e., reasonably necessary and reasonable in amount). (Ladas v. California
State Automotive Assoc. (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761, 773-774.)  
 
If the items appearing in a cost bill
appear to be proper charges, the burden is on the party seeking to tax costs to
show that they were not reasonable or necessary. (Ladas v. California State
Automotive Assoc. (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761, 773-774.) On the other hand,
if the items are properly objected to, they are put in issue and the burden of
proof is on the party claiming them as costs. (Ibid.)
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff seeks to strike or tax the
following items from the memorandum of costs filed by Contemporary Services:
 
1.      Item
5 “Service of Process” on the grounds that some of the costs associated with
service of process include witness fees, preparation of document fees, check
advance fees, and more, are not costs specified in CCP § 1033.5 and were not
reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation.
2.      Item
16 “Other” of $2,475.00 on the grounds that the cost of mediation is not a cost
specified in CCP § 1033.5 and mediation was not reasonably necessary to the
conduct of the litigation.
 
Service of Process Costs
 
Contemporary Services seeks service of
process costs in the amount of $2,779.07. (See Contemporary Services
Memorandum of Costs Item 5.) This total comprises of registered process fees
for 23 different individuals or entities. (Ibid.; Attachment 5a.)
Plaintiff asserts these costs improperly include costs for “downloading,
preparing, subpoena, check advancement, [and] service notice to opposing
counsel . . .” (Motion p. 4:1-2; Chun Decl. ¶ 5.) Plaintiff itemizes the
service of process costs which they seek to strike or tax in paragraph 5 of
Eric S. Chun’s declaration. (See Chun Decl. ¶ 5.) A trial court acts
within its discretion when awarding fees actually incurred with effectuating
service of process. (Citizens for Responsible Development v. City of West
Hollywood (1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 490, 506.) All of these costs identified by
Plaintiff are reasonably related to the service of process and are amounts
actually incurred in effecting service of process by a registered process
server. (See CCP 1033.5(a)(4)(B).)
 
Additionally, Plaintiff misstates the burden
of proof for success on a motion to strike or tax costs. Plaintiff claims that
it is the prevailing party’s burden to demonstrate that its costs were necessary
to the conduct of litigation, citing Jones v. Dumrichob (1998) 63
Cal.App.4th 1258, 1266. (Reply p. 3:6-7.) However, “[i]f items on their face
appear to be proper charges, the verified memorandum of costs is prima facie
evidence of their propriety, and the burden is on the party seeking to tax
costs to show they were not reasonable or necessary.” (Jones, supra, 63
Cal.App.4th at 1266.) Here, Contemporary Services provides a verified
memorandum of costs itemizing its fees incurred for effectuating service of
process. Therefore, Plaintiff bears the burden to show these costs were not
reasonable or necessary, which it has failed to do.
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s motion to tax
Contemporary Services’s service of process costs is denied.
 
Mediation
 
Contemporary Services seeks reimbursement for
mediation costs in the amount of $2,475.00. Generally, it is within the trial
court’s discretion to award costs for mediation fees. (Gorman v. Tassajara
Development Corp. (2009) 178 Cal.App.4th 44, 77; Berkeley Cement, Inc.
v. Regents of University of California (2019) 30 Cal.App.5th 1133, 1140.)  The Court declines to exercise its discretion
in this case and the motion to tax the mediation costs is granted. 
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s motion to strike
Contemporary Services’s mediation costs is granted in part, denied in part.
 
 
Moving party is ordered to give
notice.
