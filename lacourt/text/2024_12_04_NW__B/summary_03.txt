And here is the summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Plaintiff, Marshall Krupp, filed a motion to strike and tax certain costs from the Memorandum of Costs filed by the Defendant, Contemporary Services. The Defendant seeks to recover costs for service of process and mediation. The Court has reviewed the Memorandum of Costs and the motion to strike and tax costs.

The Court finds that the Plaintiff's motion to strike and tax the service of process costs is denied. The costs for service of process are reasonably related to the service of process and are amounts actually incurred in effecting service of process by a registered process server.

The Court grants the motion to tax the mediation costs. The Court declines to exercise its discretion in this case and finds that the mediation costs were not reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation.

Accordingly, the Plaintiff's motion to strike and tax Contemporary Services's costs is granted in part and denied in part. The moving party is ordered to give notice.
