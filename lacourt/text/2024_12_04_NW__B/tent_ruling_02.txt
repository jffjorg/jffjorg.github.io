BACKGROUND
 
On March 2, 2022, Plaintiff Suzanne
Marie Brooks (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendants the County of
Los Angeles (“County”), City of Pomona (“Pomona”), Fairplex Enterprises, Inc.
(“Fairplex”), and Does 1 to 25 (collectively “Defendants”) alleging two causes
of action: (1) general negligence; and (2) premises liability.
 
On June 6, 2024, the action was
reassigned to the Honorable Karen Moskowitz in Department B at Van Nuys
Courthouse East, effective June 24, 2024.
 
On September 4, 2024, Pomona filed the instant motions to compel
Plaintiff’s further responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, Special
Interrogatories, Set One, Request for Production, Set One, and Request for
Admissions, Set One (“Discovery Motions”). Pomona also requests sanctions.
 
On November 19, 2024, Plaintiff filed
their opposition.
 
Pomona did not file a reply.
 
[Tentative] Ruling
 
Pomona’s Discovery Motions are DENIED
as moot.
 
LEGAL STANDARD
Interrogatories
Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. § 2030.300 provides, in pertinent
part, that “[o]n receipt of a response to interrogatories, the propounding
party may move for an order compelling a further response if the propounding
party deems that any of the following apply: (1) An answer to a particular
interrogatory is evasive or incomplete. (2) An exercise of the option to
produce documents under Section 2030.230 is unwarranted or the required
specification of those documents is inadequate. (3) An objection to an
interrogatory is without merit or too general.” (CCP § 2030.300(a).) 
Unless notice of a motion to compel further responses is
given within 45 days of the service of the verified response, or any
supplemental verified response, or on or before any specific later date to
which the propounding party and the responding party have agreed in writing,
the propounding party waives any right to compel a further response. (CCP §
2030.300(c).) 
Request for Production of Documents
CCP §
2031.310 provides, in pertinent part, that “[o]n receipt of a response to
demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling, the demanding party may
move for an order compelling further response to the demand if the
demanding party deems that any of the following apply: (1) A statement of
compliance with the demand is incomplete. (2) A representation of inability to
comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive. (3) An objection in the response
is without merit or too general.” (CCP § 2031.310(a).)
 
Unless notice of a motion to compel further responses is
given within 45 days of the service of the verified response, or any
supplemental verified response, or on or before any specific later date to
which the propounding party and the responding party have agreed in writing,
the propounding party waives any right to compel a further response. (CCP §
2031.310(c).) 
Request for Admissions
CCP § 2033.290(a) provides that a
party may bring a motion to compel further responses to requests for admission
where the responding party provides evasive or incomplete responses, or their
objections are too general or without merit. (CCP § 2033.290(a).)
Unless notice of a motion to compel
further responses is given within 45 days of the service of the verified
response, or any supplemental verified response, or on or before any specific
later date to which the propounding party and the responding party have agreed
in writing, the propounding party waives any right to compel a further
response. (CCP §§ 2033.290(c).) 
Under California law, the objecting party has the burden
of justifying its objections when the propounding party requests that the Court
order further responses. (Coy v. Superior Court (1962) 58 Cal.2d 210,
220-221.) Further, under CCP § 2023.010, it is a misuse of discovery to make
unmerited objections. (CCP § 2023.010(e).) 
 
DISCUSSION
Meet and Confer
Requirement
A motion to compel
further responses to discovery motions shall be accompanied by a meet and
confer declaration. (CCP §§ 2030.300(b), 2031.310(b), and 2033.290(b).) Pomona
propounded discovery requests upon Plaintiff on June 17, 2024. (Suarkeo Decl. ¶
3.) Plaintiff provided responses on June 18, 2024. (Ibid.; Exh. A
[Plaintiff‘s responses].) On August 23, 2024, Pomona sent a meet and confer
letter regarding alleged deficiencies in Plaintiff’s responses. (Ibid. at
¶ 4; Exh. B [meet and confer correspondence].) Pomona declares Plaintiff failed
to respond. (Ibid.) Therefore, Pomona satisfies the meet and confer requirements
of CCP §§ 2030.300(b), 2031.310(b), and 2033.290(b).
Pomona’s Motions are Moot
In their opposition, Plaintiff asserts that they served
Pomona with further responses to each discovery request on August 28, 2024.
(Kasler Decl.; Opposition Exh. A [service of further responses].) Pomona filed
the instant motions on September 4, 2024, after receipt of Plaintiff’s further
responses, yet failed to address these responses in their Discovery Motions. 
“A case becomes moot when a court ruling can have no practical
effect or cannot provide the parties with effective relief. [Citation.]” (People
v. Alsafar (2017) 8 Cal.App.5th 880, 886.) Here, Pomona asks the Court to
compel Plaintiff’s further responses to Pomona’s Discovery Motions, which
Plaintiff has already done. Therefore, the instant motions are moot.
 
CONCLUSION
 
Based on the foregoing, Pomona’s Discovery Motions are DENIED
as moot.
 
Moving party is ordered to give
notice.
