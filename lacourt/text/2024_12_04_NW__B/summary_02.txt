Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the City of Pomona's motion to compel further responses to discovery requests, as the motion is considered moot. The City of Pomona had filed the motion on September 4, 2024, after the plaintiff had already provided additional responses to the discovery requests. The plaintiff had served the additional responses on August 28, 2024, but the City of Pomona did not address these responses in their motion. The judge has ordered the moving party to give notice of this tentative ruling.
