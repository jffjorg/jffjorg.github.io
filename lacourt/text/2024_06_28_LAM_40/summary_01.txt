And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has granted the Plaintiffs' motion to compel further responses to their request for production of documents, Set One, in part. The Court finds that the discovery relating to vehicles of the same year, make, and model is relevant, but limits the scope of discovery to the "2021 Mercedes-Benz GLA 250W4 4MATIC 2.0L, 8 Speed Automatic Transmission". The Court also strikes the objections raised by the Defendant, Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC, as to vagueness, ambiguity, unintelligibility, unclear definition, compound, overbreadth, relevance, failure to narrow requests, and arbitration. The Defendant is ordered to provide further responses to the Plaintiffs' request for production of documents within 45 days of this ruling.
