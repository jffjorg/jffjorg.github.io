And here is the English text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) to the Complaint for Damages filed by J.S. and S.S., individual minors, by and through Guardian ad Litem, Rolando Zamora-Gonzalez.

The Complaint alleges that LAUSD failed to supervise and stop an older peer who sexually assaulted the plaintiffs, and that LAUSD staff failed to take reasonable steps to protect the plaintiffs. LAUSD filed a demurrer arguing that the Complaint does not sufficiently allege grounds for derivative liability against LAUSD.

The Judge has overruled the demurrer, finding that the Complaint alleges sufficient ultimate facts to state a cause of action for derivative liability against LAUSD. The Judge notes that the Complaint alleges that the plaintiffs exhibited distressed behavior that should have signaled to LAUSD employees that the plaintiffs had undergone a traumatic experience and triggered an investigation by LAUSD. The Judge concludes that the Complaint sufficiently alleges grounds for foreseeable harm to the plaintiffs and that LAUSD's demurrer is therefore overruled.
