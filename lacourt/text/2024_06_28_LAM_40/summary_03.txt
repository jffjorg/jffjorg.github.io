And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication in the case of Prime/Park LaBrea Titleholder, LLC v. Arzu Kocgirli, Serra Altan, and Does 1 to 10. The plaintiff is seeking to recover possession of the subject premises and obtain summary judgment or summary adjudication.

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment, finding that the plaintiff has carried its burden of showing that there is no defense to the cause of action. The judge has determined that the plaintiff has provided prima facie evidence that the defendant is currently in possession of the premises, that the possession is without consent, and that the defendant has not paid the past due rent.

The judge has also found that the plaintiff has provided prima facie evidence of a default on the rental agreement and proper service of a three-day notice to pay or quit. The judge has determined that the burden shifts to the defendant, who did not file an opposition to the motion, and therefore does not meet the responsive burden on summary judgment.

As a result, the judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment and has declared that the defendant is in default. The judge has also declared that the summary adjudication in the alternative is moot. The plaintiff is required to file a proposed judgment within seven days of the ruling.
