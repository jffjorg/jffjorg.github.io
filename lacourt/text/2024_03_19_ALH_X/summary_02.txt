And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling addresses three motions filed by the parties in a lemon law case. Plaintiff Estephanie Sanchez moves to compel the deposition of Defendant American Honda Motor Co., Inc.'s person most qualified, while Defendant moves to compel the inspection of Plaintiff's vehicle. The Court grants Plaintiff's motion to compel deposition, but declines to set a deadline for the hearing and orders the parties to meet and confer to find a mutually agreeable date and time. The Court also denies Plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to its requests for the production of documents, finding that Plaintiff's separate statement is deficient. Finally, the Court denies Defendant's motion to compel inspection of Plaintiff's vehicle, finding that Defendant has not provided a separate statement as required by California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1345. The parties are ordered to meet and confer in good faith regarding possible dates for the deposition and inspection.
