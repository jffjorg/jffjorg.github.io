And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling grants Plaintiff Rob C. Pun's motion to compel Defendant Julian Fong to answer deposition questions. The ruling orders Defendant Fong to provide responses to questions 1-34 and 38-53 at the resumption of his deposition. Additionally, the court grants Plaintiff's request for sanctions against Defendant Fong's counsel in the amount of $2061.65.

The ruling is based on the California Code of Civil Procedure and California Constitution, which provide that a party seeking discovery must show good cause and that the information sought is relevant to the case. The court found that Defendant Fong's objections to certain questions were unfounded and that the information sought was relevant to the case. The court also found that Defendant Fong failed to meet the three-prong requirements of the Hill test, which requires a party to establish a legally protected privacy interest, an objectively reasonable expectation of privacy in the given circumstances, and a threatened intrusion that is serious.

The court's decision is based on the facts of the case, which include Plaintiff's allegations of wrongful termination and retaliatory conduct, Defendant Fong's failure to answer certain questions during deposition, and Plaintiff's request for sanctions against Defendant Fong's counsel. The court's ruling is intended to ensure that the parties comply with the discovery obligations and to protect Plaintiff's rights to seek discovery.
