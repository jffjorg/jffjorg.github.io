And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on Richard Hester's motion to vacate the order compelling the case to arbitration. The Judge finds that the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) preempts California Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.98, which allows a party to withdraw a claim from arbitration if they fail to pay fees or costs required to continue the arbitration proceeding within 30 days after the due date. The Judge relies on the Court of Appeal's decision in Hernandez v. Sohnen Enterprises, Inc. and the dissenting opinion in Hohenshelt v. Superior Court, which argue that the FAA preempts California statutes that discriminate against arbitration. As a result, the Judge denies the motion to vacate the order compelling the case to arbitration.
