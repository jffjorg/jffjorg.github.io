 Case Number:  22STCV13174    Hearing Date:   August 14, 2024    Dept:  52 Defendant Los Angeles Unified School
District’s Motion for a Stay Pending Appeal or in the Alternative to Continue
Trial
Defendant Los Angeles Unified School
District (LAUSD) moves to stay this action pending appellate review of other
cases involving an issue present in this action.  In the alternative, LAUSD moves to continue
the trial.
LAUSD moved for judgment on the pleadings on
plaintiff’s complaint on the basis that AB 218 violated the California
Constitution’s prohibition on gifts of public funds.  The court denied the motion.  When LAUSD filed this motion to stay the
action, the Court of Appeal had
several pending cases on that issue. 
None had been decided.  On July
31, 2024, the Court of Appeal issued a published decision holding AB 218 does
not violate the prohibition on gifts of public funds.  (West Contra Costa Unified School District
v. Superior Court of Contra Costa County (July 31, 2024, No. A169314) ___
Cal.App.5th ___, 2024 WL 3593932.)  That
opinion is binding authority on this court. 

After
considering all relevant factors, the court finds neither staying this action
nor continuing the trial would serve the interests of justice or judicial
economy.
Defendant
Los
Angeles Unified School District’s motion to stay the action or to continue the
trial is denied.
