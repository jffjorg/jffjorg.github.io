And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion for a protective order filed by the defendants, Farmers Group, Inc., et al. The defendants are seeking to limit the scope of discovery in this employment and labor code case. The plaintiff, Maureen Martinez, has propounded seven sets of requests for production, totaling 667 categories of documents, and hundreds of other requests in deposition notices. The defendants estimate that responding to all of these requests would require 1,000 hours of work, which is unduly burdensome and expensive. The judge finds that the defendants have shown good cause for the protective order and grants it. The court orders that the defendants need not produce any documents or provide any further responses to the pending requests for production and deposition notices. The plaintiff is limited to serving amended notices of depositions including no more than 10 document requests each, and may propound no more than 100 additional requests for production, aggregated among all six Farmers defendants. The plaintiff is also ordered to pay $3,000 in sanctions to the defendants.
