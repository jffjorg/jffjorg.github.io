And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Los Angeles Unified School District's (LAUSD) motion to stay the action pending appellate review or in the alternative, to continue the trial. LAUSD argued that the action should be stayed pending appellate review of other cases involving an issue present in this action, specifically the constitutionality of AB 218. The Court of Appeal had previously issued a decision on July 31, 2024, holding that AB 218 does not violate the California Constitution's prohibition on gifts of public funds. The Judge found that neither staying the action nor continuing the trial would serve the interests of justice or judicial economy, and therefore denied LAUSD's motion.
