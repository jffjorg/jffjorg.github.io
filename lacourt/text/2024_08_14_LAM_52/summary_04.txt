And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) has moved to stay this action pending the outcome of an appeal to the Court of Appeal, or in the alternative, to continue the trial. The motion is based on the court's earlier ruling that AB 218 does not violate the California Constitution's prohibition on gifts of public funds. However, the Court of Appeal has since issued a published decision holding the same thing, and that decision is binding authority on this court. After considering the relevant factors, the court has denied LAUSD's motion to stay or continue the trial, finding that neither action would serve the interests of justice or judicial economy.
