And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction to turn over client files, an alternative motion for an order to provide information needed for a writ of possession, and a request for sanctions or fee award. The court finds that the plaintiff has failed to establish a sufficient showing to justify the issuance of a preliminary injunction. The court also finds that there is an adequate remedy available to the plaintiff under the claim and delivery law, and therefore denies the motion for a writ of possession. Finally, the court denies the plaintiff's request for sanctions or fee award.
