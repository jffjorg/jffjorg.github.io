And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the Plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment. The Plaintiff, Jose Meza Torres, filed a Complaint against his former employer, CBW Doors Inc., alleging several violations of California Labor Codes. The Plaintiff was wrongfully terminated on February 1, 2023, and had previously informed his supervisor of his injuries and his wife's pregnancy. The Judge found that the default packet contains all the requisite materials, except for the interest calculation, which is incorrect. The Judge has given the Plaintiff two options: either correct the interest calculation or provide evidence that the employment was based on a contract, which would permit the use of a 10% interest rate. The hearing will be held on September 16, 2024, where the calculation of interest at the 7% rate can be presented.
