Background
            On March 4,
2024, Jeremy Lundblad (Plaintiff) filed a Complaint containing ten causes of
action against his former employer Game 1, LLC (Game 1), and the Co-Founder and
Chief Executive Officer of the company, Basil Iwanyk (Iwanyk, collectively
Defendants). 
 
            In February
of 2020, Plaintiff was hired by Game 1 as Vice President of Development.
(Compl., ¶3.) The agreed upon salary was $200,000.00, which was increased in
October of 2021 to $225,000.00. (Compl., ¶¶3-4.) An employment agreement
(Employment Agreement) was executed on May 1, 2022 for a term of three years.
(Compl., ¶5.) However, on November 3, 2022, Defendants ceased to pay Plaintiff
money earned, and did not resume payment until January 2023, with no
retroactive pay. (Compl., ¶¶10-13.) Failed payments occurred again in March
2023, April 2023, and May 2023. (Compl., ¶¶14, 15, & 17.) After notifying
Defendants they were in breach of the terms of the Employment Agreement,
Plaintiff was advised by both Mark Peterson (Peterson) the Chief of Staff and
Ben Bitonti the Chief Creative Officer to seek other work to help alleviate the
financial pressure on Game 1. (Compl., ¶22.) On December 1, 2023, Peterson
called Plaintiff to tell him Defendants learned Plaintiff was working for
another company at the same time as Game 1. Plaintiff was then given a notice
of termination on December 12, 2023 without being paid at least $229,167.00 in
unpaid wages. (Compl., ¶¶34-35.) Plaintiff then filed suit.
 
            The motion
now before the Court is Defendants’ Motion for Leave to File a Cross-Complaint
(the Motion). The Motion is unopposed.             
 
Discussion
 
Legal Standard
A cross-complaint may be filed by
anyone against whom a complaint or cross-complaint has been filed. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 428.10.) The cross-complaint may be filed at any time before the Court
has set a date for trial. (Code Civ. Proc., § 428.50(b).) If the proposed
cross-complaint is permissive, leave of court may be granted "in the
interest of justice" at any time during the course of the action. (Code
Civ. Proc. § 428.50 (c).) If defendant's cause of action against plaintiff is
related to the subject matter of the complaint, it must be raised by
cross-complaint and is therefore compulsory; failure to plead it will bar
defendant from asserting it in any later lawsuit. (Code Civ. Proc., § 426.30.)
 
Analysis
            Upon moving
for leave to file a cross-complaint, Defendants argue their cross-complaint is
compulsory because it arises out of the same transaction or occurrence as the
cause of action Plaintiff alleges in their Complaint. The Court agrees. 
 
Concurrently filed with their
Motion, Defendants attach the Declaration of Daniel Kitzes (Kitzes Decl.) which
contains the proposed Cross-Complaint. The proposed Cross-Complaint alleges two
causes of action: (1) breach of duty of loyalty and (2) breach of contract. The
causes of action in the proposed Cross-Complaint and allegations therein stem
from the same employment relationship and Employment Agreement Plaintiff
alleges in their initial Complaint. Failure by Defendants to plead their own
allegations now bars their ability to do so in the future. Therefore, the
Cross-Complaint is compulsory, and leave shall be permitted in order to file
it.   
 
Conclusion
            Accordingly, Defendants Motion for Leave to File a
Cross-Complaint
