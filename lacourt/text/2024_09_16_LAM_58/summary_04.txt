And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of granting the Motion for Leave to File Cross-Complaint filed by the defendants, Game 1, LLC and Basil Iwanyk. The motion is unopposed. The court agrees that the cross-complaint is compulsory because it arises out of the same transaction or occurrence as the cause of action alleged in the plaintiff's complaint. The cross-complaint alleges two causes of action: breach of duty of loyalty and breach of contract, which stem from the same employment relationship and employment agreement alleged in the initial complaint. The court has concluded that the cross-complaint is compulsory and therefore grants leave to file it.
