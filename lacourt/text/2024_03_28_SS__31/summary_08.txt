And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's request for default judgment against Arthur Muradyan. The plaintiff must dismiss all other defendants against whom judgment is not sought or seek an application for separate judgment against specified parties. The plaintiff must also submit a copy of the Statement of Damages that was served on defendants against whom default is sought. The court notes that the plaintiff's counsel's declaration attesting to the plaintiff's damages is insufficient because counsel was not involved in the accident and did not incur the medical expenses. The plaintiff is required to authenticate his own records. The plaintiff is given a deadline to submit a new default judgment package correcting these defects, and failure to do so may result in the imposition of sanctions.
