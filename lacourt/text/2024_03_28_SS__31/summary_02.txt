Summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment, finding that the plaintiff failed to timely present a claim to the defendant. The plaintiff alleged a slip and fall incident on October 23, 2019, and presented a claim via certified mail on November 25, 2019. However, the judge found that the plaintiff did not provide sufficient proof of mailing, as the declaration of the plaintiff's counsel's secretary did not comply with the statutory requirements. The judge ruled that the plaintiff's failure to timely present a claim bars the lawsuit, and therefore granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment.
