And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge is tentatively ruling to grant the defendant's motion to continue the trial date from June 11, 2024, to October 11, 2024, or a date thereafter. The defendant argues that the plaintiff's current counsel was retained late in the case, and the parties have only recently been able to engage in meaningful discovery. The plaintiff has also undergone major back surgery, which has impacted their ability to participate in discovery. The Judge finds good cause to continue the trial date by six months to allow the parties sufficient time to complete discovery prior to trial. The parties must plan all discovery and trial preparation accordingly.
