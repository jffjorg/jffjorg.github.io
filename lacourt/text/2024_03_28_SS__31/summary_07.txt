And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed the petition to approve the compromise of a pending action of a minor, NATAN TOPPS, and has tentatively granted the petition upon certain conditions. The parties have agreed to settle their claims for a total amount of $29,000, with $15,000 going to the Claimant. The settlement will be used to pay medical expenses, attorneys' fees, and costs, with the net balance of $6,677.66 to be deposited into a blocked account. The Court finds the settlement and attorney's fees fair and reasonable. However, in order to approve the settlement, the parties must file an Order to Deposit Funds Into Blocked Account (MC-355). The Court sets a hearing to review the proof of deposit and orders the moving party to give notice.
