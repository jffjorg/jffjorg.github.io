And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the defendant's motion to compel the plaintiff's physical examination. The plaintiff was injured in a motor vehicle incident and the defendant has been seeking a physical examination of the plaintiff to assess the extent of the injuries. The defendant served a notice of neurosurgical examination with Dr. Macyszyn, but the plaintiff did not oppose the motion or provide valid grounds for refusing to proceed with the examination. The judge has ordered the plaintiff to appear for a physical examination with Dr. Macyszyn and has also denied the defendant's request for monetary sanctions. The parties must meet and confer to determine the date and time for the examination, and if the plaintiff does not meaningfully participate in the meet and confer process, the defendant may unilaterally set the date and time for the examination.
