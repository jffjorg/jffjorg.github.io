And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The City of Los Angeles moves for an order compelling Plaintiff Reina Resnik to undergo a mental examination by neuropsychologist Earl C. Thorndyke, Ph.D. The City argues that Plaintiff's testimony at deposition and her diagnosis of PTSD by her provider, Dr. Mac, put her mental condition in controversy. Plaintiff opposes the motion, stating that she will not claim any emotional or psychological damages above the routine garden variety and will not claim any neuropsychological treatment received from Dr. Mac. The Court finds good cause for a mental examination, but notes that Plaintiff's representations that she will limit her claims for emotional distress to those usually associated with physical injuries arising from the incident. The Court orders the parties to meet and confer to draft a formal stipulation giving effect to Plaintiff's representations. Once a stipulation is signed, the motion will be rendered moot. The Court will continue the motion to a later date to allow the parties to finalize the stipulation.
