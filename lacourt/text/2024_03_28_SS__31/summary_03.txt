And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling addresses plaintiff Arsho Haroutanian's motion to compel further discovery responses from defendants Access Services, San Gabriel Transit, Inc., and Rodolfo Martinez. The motion is premature because the parties did not schedule an Informal Discovery Conference (IDC) prior to the hearing. The Court orders the parties to participate in an IDC as required by the Eight Amended Standing Order for Procedures in the Personal Injury Hub Courts. The IDC is intended to avoid the necessity of a motion to compel and to informally resolve outstanding discovery issues. The parties are also ordered to continue the hearing on the motion to compel further responses using the online reservation management system, at least three weeks after the IDC. If outstanding issues are not resolved at the IDC, the parties must submit a joint statement of items in dispute at least two weeks prior to the continued hearing date.
