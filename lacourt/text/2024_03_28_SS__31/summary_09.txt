And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling denies the plaintiff's request for default judgment against Carlos Pizza Food Services, Inc. dba Carlos Pizza House (CPH). The plaintiff, Joselyn Espinoza, alleges that she was assaulted and battered by CPH's employee, Marian De Jesus, on May 14, 2021. The plaintiff seeks default judgment against CPH only, but her request is denied due to several defects in her submission. Specifically, the plaintiff failed to submit a CIV-100 check marking a request for "Court Judgment", did not provide authenticated records of damages, and did not submit a copy of the Statement of Damages served on CPH. Additionally, the plaintiff has not yet dismissed Does 1-100. The plaintiff is ordered to submit a new default judgment package correcting these defects by a certain date, or risk facing sanctions, including monetary sanctions and/or dismissal.
