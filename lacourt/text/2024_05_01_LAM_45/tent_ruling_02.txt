Discussion
Katherine F.
Wenger and Brown, Gee & Wenger LLP (“Counsel”) moves to be relieved as
counsel of record for defendant Grace & Co. Inc. The court has discretion
to allow an attorney to withdraw and such a motion should be granted provided
that there is no prejudice to the client, and it does not disrupt the orderly
process of justice. (See Ramirez v.
Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal. App. 4th 904, 915; People v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398.)
 
CRC, Rule 3.1362
(Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel) requires (1) notice of motion and motion to
be directed to the client (made on the Notice of Motion and Motion to Be
Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-051)); (2) a declaration stating in general
terms and without compromising the confidentiality of the attorney-client
relationship why a motion under CCP § 284(2) is brought instead of filing a
consent under CCP § 284(1) (made on the Declaration in Support of Attorney's
Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-052)); (3) service of the
notice of motion and motion and declaration on all other parties who have
appeared in the case; and (4) the proposed order relieving counsel (prepared on
the Order Granting Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form
(MC-053)).
 
Here, Counsel has complied
with CRC, Rule 3.1362. Prof. Conduct,
Rule 1.16(b)(10) provides that a permissive request for withdrawal may be
properly granted where an attorney believes that the tribunal will find good
cause for withdrawal. In the attorney declaration (Form MC-052), Counsel
indicates that Defendant failed to pay Brown Gee &Wenger LLP’s fees. (Counsel
Decl., ¶ 2.) Moreover, Counsel submits the declaration of Daniel Grace who was
Defendant’s former Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”). Daniel Grace states that
“[a]t the beginning of February, Grace & Co. entered into an assignment for
the benefit of its creditors. In connection with that assignment for benefit of
creditors, I resigned all of my positions with Grace & Co. including my
former position as an officer and director. Grace & Co. no longer has any
directors or officers. As a result of this assignment, Brown Gee & Wenger
LLP’s representation of Grace & Co. has been terminated.” (Grace Decl. ¶¶
2-3.)  This is a proper basis for
withdrawal. Although trial has been set for October 14, 2024, the Court finds
that there would not be obvious prejudice because there are about five months
for a new counsel to prepare for trial. Moreover, Defendant was notified of the
withdrawal but did not file an opposition. The next hearing is a Mandatory
Settlement Conference scheduled for October 4, 2024. Therefore, there is no
reason to believe that Counsel’s withdrawal will prejudice Defendant. 
 
The court
therefore GRANTS Counsel’s motion to be relieved as counsel. 
 
It is so ordered.
