Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

**Tentative Ruling**

The court has reviewed the demurrer to the cross-complaint and motion to strike. The demurrer is overruled, as the cross-complaint alleges breach of contract and the court must treat as true the material factual allegations. The motion to strike is denied, as the allegations being sought to be struck are not irrelevant, false or improper.

The court has also reviewed the motion to enforce subpoena for business records. The motion is denied, as the responding party has provided the necessary information regarding the insurance policy and the court sees no need for additional documents to show relevance.

**Next Steps**
