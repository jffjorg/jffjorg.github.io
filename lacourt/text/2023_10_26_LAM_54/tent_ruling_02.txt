Hearing Date: October 26, 2023
Department 54, Judge Maurice Leiter
Motion for Bench Trial
Moving Party: Defendant Shmuel Erde
Responding Party: None
 
T/R:      DEFENDANT’S MOTION IS DENIED.
 
DEFENDANT TO NOTICE.
 
If the parties wish to submit on the tentative, please
email the courtroom at SMCdept54@lacourt.org with
notice to opposing counsel (or self-represented party) before 8:00 am on the
day of the hearing.
 
The Court considers the moving papers.
No opposition has been received.
 
Defendant moves for a court trial
rather than jury trial. Defendant asserts a jury trial is not “necessary”
because there are no constitutional issues in this action and the facts are
largely not in dispute. The motion cannot be granted on this basis. 
 
The salient issue is whether Plaintiff
is entitled to a jury trial on each of the causes of action in the complaint.
The complaint contains three causes of action: declaratory relief, cancellation
of written instrument, and conspiracy to conceal property/assets. The Court
will expect both sides to research and address this issue as the case
approaches trial.
 
Defendant’s motion is DENIED without
prejudice.
