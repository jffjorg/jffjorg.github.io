Department 54, Judge Maurice Leiter
Motion to Set Aside Default 
Moving Party: Defendant Angela Johnson
Responding Party: Plaintiff Eric Portegies
 
T/R:      DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO SET ASIDE DEFAULT
IS GRANTED.
 
DEFENDANT TO NOTICE.
 
If the parties wish to submit on the tentative, please email
the courtroom at SMCdept54@lacourt.org with
notice to opposing counsel (or self-represented party) before 8:00 am on the
day of the hearing.
 
The Court considers the moving papers
and opposition.
 
CCP § 473(b) provides, in pertinent
part, “[t]he court may, upon any terms as may be just, relieve a party or his
or her legal representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other
proceeding taken against him or her through his or her mistake, inadvertence,
surprise, or excusable neglect.” 
 
Defendant moves to set aside default
entered against her on February 24, 2023 on the grounds of mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. Defendant represents that
Plaintiff told her and their shared children that the sale and division of the
family home would be resolved amicably through mediation. Defendant asserts
that she relied on these representations and was surprised when Plaintiff went
back on his word and sought default judgment. This is sufficient grounds to set
aside default. 
 
Defendant’s motion is GRANTED.
