ANALYSIS:
 
I.                   
Background

 
On July 8, 2024, Petitioners Iehab A. Ibrahim and
Christina M. Ibrahim (“Petitioners”) filed the instant verified Petition for
Release of Property from Lien (the “Petition”) against Universal Floor Source,
Inc. (“Respondent”). The Petition seeks an order releasing property commonly
known as 1921 Voorhees Avenue, Redondo Beach, California 90278 (the “Subject
Property”) from a mechanic’s lien recorded on November 16, 2023 by Respondent.
(Pet., ¶¶ 1, 2.) 
 
Petitioners filed a proof of service demonstrating
Respondent was substitute served with the Petition and Notice of Hearing on
August 16, 2024 at 24520 Crenshaw Boulevard, Unit A, Torrance, CA 90505 (the “Crenshaw
Address”). (8/27/24 Proof of Service.) The proof of service also includes a
declaration of due diligence and a declaration of mailing demonstrating the
documents were mailed to Respondent to the Crenshaw Address on August 19, 2024.
(8/27/24 Proof of Service.) 
 
On September 4, 2024, Petitioners filed proof of service
demonstrating Respondent was served by mail with the notice of hearing on
August 20, 2024. (9/4/24 Proof of Service.) 
 
On November 4, 2024, Petitioners filed a Proposed Order
and proof of service demonstrating Respondent was served by mail with the
Proposed Order on November 4, 2024. (11/4/24 Proof of Service.) 
 
On November 12, 2024, the Court continued the hearing on
the Motion due to deficiencies in service of process and to allow Petitioners to
file and serve new proof of service. (11/12/24 Order.)
 
On November 22, 2024, Petitioners filed a new Proposed
Order.
 
On December 12, 2024, Petitioners filed a new proof of
service demonstrating Respondent was personally served with the Petition,
Notice of Hearing, Proposed Order, and other case documents on December 2, 2024
at 24520 S Crenshaw Blvd, Unit A, Torrance, CA 90505. (12/12/24 Proof of
Personal Service.) That same day, Petitioners also filed an additional proof of
service demonstrating Respondent was served by certified mail/return receipt
requested with the Petition, Notice of Hearing, Proposed Order, and other case
documents on November 22, 2024 at 24520 S Crenshaw Blvd, Unit A, Torrance, CA
90505. (12/12/24 Proof of Service by Mail.)
 
To date, no Response has been filed. 
 
II.                
Legal
Standard
 
After a mechanic’s lien has been
recorded, “[t]he owner of property or the owner of any interest in property
subject to a claim of lien may petition the court for an order to release the
property from the claim of lien if the claimant has not commenced an action to
enforce the lien within the time provided in Section 8460.”  (Civ. Code, § 8480, subd. (a).)  A claimant must commence an action to enforce
a lien within 90 days of recording the lien. (Civ. Code, § 8460, subd.
(a).)  Section 8460 further provides that
“[i]f the claimant does not commence an action to enforce the lien within that
time, the claim of lien expires and is unenforceable.” (Civ. Code, § 8460,
subd. (a).) Section 8460 also provides that the 90-day time limit to commence an
action to enforce a lien does not apply if there was an agreement to extend
credit and a notice of that fact was recorded within 90 days after recordation
of the claim of lien or more than 90 days after recordation of the claim of
lien but before a purchaser or encumbrancer for value and in good faith
acquires rights in the property.  (Civ.
Code, § 8460, subd. (b).)  
 
III.             
Discussion

 
A.   
Service Requirements 
 
“The petitioner shall serve a copy of the petition
and a notice of hearing on the claimant at least 15 days before the
hearing.  Service shall be made in the
same manner as service of summons, or by certified or registered mail, postage
prepaid, return receipt requested, addressed to the claimant as provided in Section
8108.” (Civ. Code, § 8486, subd. (b).)
Section 8108 provides addresses at which a respondent must be served, depending
on the title of the person to be served. The petitioner bears the burden of
proving he complied with service and date for hearing requirements. (Civ. Code,
§ 8488, subd. (a).)
 
Here, Respondent was originally
served by substitute service on August 16, 2024 at the Crenshaw
Address. While the Crenshaw Address is substantially similar to the address
that Respondent listed on the Claim of Mechanic’s Lien filed with the County
Recorder’s Office (Petn., Exh. A), the Court noted at the previous hearing that
there was a discrepancy between the two addresses – namely, the Crenshaw
Address does not contain the “South” demarcation present in the address listed
on the Claim of Mechanic’s Lien. Additionally, the Court noted Petitioners
served the notice of hearing and Proposed Order by mail without acknowledgement
of receipt (Code Civ. Proc., § 415.30) and did not use certified or registered
mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested (Civ. Code, § 8486, subd. (b)).
Finally, the Court noted Petitioners failed to serve Respondent with the
Proposed Order until November 4, 2024, just five court days before the instant
hearing. 
 
On December 12, 2024,
Petitioners filed new proofs of service demonstrating Respondent was personally
served by a registered California process server on December 4, 2024 at 24520 S Crenshaw Blvd, Unit A,
Torrance, CA 90505 with the “Notice of
Continued Hearing on Petition with Minute Order, Petition for Release of
Property from Lien, Civil Case Cover Sheet, Notice of Case Assignment, General
Order re: Limited Jurisdiction Civil Procedure, Notice of Availability of
Limited Civil Jurisdiction, Proposed Order Releasing Mechanics Lien.” (12/12/24
Proof of Personal Service.) Respondent was additionally served with the listed
documents by certified mail/return receipt requested on November 22, 2024 at 24520
S Crenshaw Blvd, Unit A, Torrance, CA 90505. (12/12/24 Proof of Service by Mail.) 
 
Accordingly, the Court finds
the service requirements are now satisfied.
 
B.    
Petition Requirements 
 
            Civil Code section 8484 requires
that the petition for release order be verified by the petitioner and allege
the following:
 
(a) The date of recordation of the claim of lien. A certified copy of
the claim of lien shall be attached to the petition.
(b) The county in which the claim of lien is recorded.
(c) The book and page or series number of the place in the official
records where the claim of lien is recorded.
(d) The legal description of the property subject to the claim of lien.
(e) Whether an extension of credit has been granted under Section 8460,
if so to what date, and that the time for commencement of an action to enforce
the lien has expired.
(f) That the owner has given the claimant notice under Section 8482
demanding that the claimant execute and record a release of the lien and that
the claimant is unable or unwilling to do so or cannot with reasonable
diligence be found.
(g) Whether an action to enforce the lien is pending.
(h) Whether the owner of the property or interest in the property has
filed for relief in bankruptcy or there is another restraint that prevents the
claimant from commencing an action to enforce the lien. 
 
            (Civ.
Code, § 8484.) 
 
A property owner “may not petition the
court for a release order … unless at least 10 days before filing the petition
the owner gives the claimant notice demanding that the claimant execute and
record a release of the claim of lien.” (Civ. Code, § 8482.)
 
The instant Petition is verified and is accompanied by a
certified copy of the Claim of Mechanic’s Lien, Document No. 20230794418, filed
with the Los Angeles County Recorder’s Office on November 16, 2023. (Pet., Exh.
A.) The Petition states the legal description of the subject property, that no
extension of credit has been granted, that the 90-day time period to enforce
the lien has expired, that Petitioners gave notice under Section 8482 of their
demand and Respondent did not respond, that Petitioners have not filed for
bankruptcy, and that no other restraint exists preventing Respondent from
filing an action to enforce the lien. (Pet., at pp. 1-2.) 
 
Petitioners also include a copy of an April 9, 2024
letter that was mailed to Respondent at 24520 S. Crenshaw Boulevard, Suite A,
Torrance, California 90505 – the same address listed on the Claim of Mechanic’s Lien filed with the
County Recorder’s Office – demanding that the mechanic’s lien be
released. (Pet., Exh. B.) 
 
            Thus, the Court finds the
requirements of Civil Code section 8484 to be satisfied. 
 
C.     Attorney’s Fees & Costs
 
In the Petition’s Prayer for Relief, Petitioners request reasonable
attorney fees, costs, and such other relief as may be just. (Pet., p. 3.)
 
Civil Code section 8488 states:
 
(a)   At the hearing both (1) the petition
and (2) the issue of compliance with the service and date for hearing
requirements of this article are deemed controverted by the claimant. The
petitioner has the initial burden of producing evidence on those matters. The
petitioner has the burden of proof as to the issue of compliance with the
service and date for hearing requirements of this article. The claimant has the
burden of proof as to the validity of the lien.
(b)   If judgment is in favor of the
petitioner, the court shall order the property released from the claim of lien.
(c)   The prevailing party is entitled to
reasonable attorney’s fees.
 
(Civ. Code, § 8488.)
 
Petitioners do not present any evidence
of costs or a specific amount of attorney’s fees. Petitioners may separately
file a noticed motion for attorney’s fees pursuant to California Rules of
Court, rule 3.1702. 
 
IV.             
Conclusion
& Order 
 
Accordingly, Petitioners Iehab A. Ibrahim and Christina
M. Ibrahim’s Petition for Release of Property from Mechanic’s Lien is GRANTED. Petitioners
may move for attorney’s fees pursuant to a noticed motion.
 
Moving parties are ordered to give notice.
