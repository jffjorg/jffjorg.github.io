And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to set aside the default and default judgment without prejudice. The defendant, Tameka Wells, had claimed that she was never served with the summons and complaint and that the default judgment was entered without her knowledge. However, the judge found that the defendant was served personally with the summons and complaint on June 16, 2022, and that she failed to file a response to the complaint. The judge also noted that the defendant's motion did not include a concise statement of the law, evidence, and arguments relied on, and that it did not cite any case law or statutory authority that authorized the court to set aside the default or default judgment. The judge ordered the moving party to give notice of the ruling.
