ANALYSIS:
 
I.                   
Background

 
On June 6, 2022, Plaintiff United
Financial Casualty Company (“Plaintiff”) initiated this action against Defendant
Tameka Wells (“Defendant”) and Does 1-20 alleging a Motor Vehicle cause of
action. (Compl., pp. 1, 4-5.) On July 6, 2022, Plaintiff filed proof of
personal service of the Summons and Complaint and relevant documents on
Defendant on June 16, 2022. (7/6/22 Proof of Service.)
 
On December 4, 2023, default was
entered against Defendant. (12/4/23 Request for Entry of Default and Default
Judgment.) The same day, Does 1-20 were dismissed (12/4/23 Request for
Dismissal), and the Non-Jury Trial in this matter was taken off
calendar/vacated. (12/4/23 Order.)
 
On December 12, 2023, default judgment
was entered against Defendant in the total amount of $10,318.00. (12/12/23
Judgment by Default.)
 
On October 23, 2024, Defendant filed
the instant “Notice of Motion and Motion Order Vacating and Setting Aside
Default (and Default Judgment])” (the “Motion”). 
 
On October 28, 2024, Defendant filed
an “amended” version of the instant Motion.
 
On December 2, 2024, the Court
continued the hearing on the Motion due to several deficiencies in the Motion.
(12/2/24 Order.) The Court ordered that, at least 16 court days before the next
scheduled hearing, Defendant must file and serve proof of service on Plaintiff.

 
On December 26, 2024, Plaintiff filed
an Opposition stating Defendant received actual notice of the action, Defendant
is not entitled to relief, and Defendant’s Motion fails to include a proposed
Answer.
 
No Reply has been filed. Additionally,
Defendant has not filed any supplemental papers or proof of service since the
December 2, 2024 hearing. 
 
While Defendant has filed two motions
regarding Setting Aside/Vacating Default and Default Judgment, the Court
continues to address the motion filed on October 23, 2024 at this time.
 
II.                
Procedural
Issues
 
Defendant still has not filed proof of
service of the Notice of Hearing and Motion. 
 
Additionally, Plaintiff’s Opposition
is untimely.
 
However, the Court exercises its
discretion to address the Motion on the merits given the filing of the Opposition,
and the Court exercises its discretion to address the untimely Opposition given
the lack of proof of service of the Motion.
 
III.             
Legal
Standard & Discussion
 
The court has broad discretion to
vacate the entry of default, default judgment, or a dismissal where the moving
party timely establishes a proper ground for relief.  (Cruz v. Fagor America, Inc. (2007)
146 Cal.App.4th 488, 495.)  Code of Civil Procedure § 473, subdivision (b)
contains two distinct provisions for relief from default.  The first
provision is discretionary and broad in scope, providing: “The court may, upon
any terms as may be just, relieve a party or his or her legal representative
from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against him or her
through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. 
Application for this relief shall be accompanied by a copy of the answer or
other pleading proposed to be filed therein, otherwise the application shall
not be granted, and shall be made within a reasonable time, in no case
exceeding six months, after the judgment, dismissal, order, or proceeding was
taken.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 473(b).) 
 
The
general underlying purpose of Section 473, subdivision (b)
is to promote the determination of actions on their merits.  (Even Zohar Const. & Remodeling, Inc.
v. Bellaire Townhouses, LLC (2015) 61 Cal.4th 830, 838-839.)
 “Apart from any statute, courts have the inherent authority to vacate a
default and default judgment on equitable grounds such as extrinsic fraud or
extrinsic mistake.” (Bae v. T.D. Service Co. of Arizona (2016)
245 Cal.App.4th 89, 97.) A motion seeking such equitable relief “‘may be
brought on such ground even though the statutory period [for relief under Code
of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b)] has run.’
[Citation.]”  (Ibid.)  
 
Notably, in limited civil cases,
the grounds for equitable relief are extended to include “inadvertence or
excusable neglect.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 86, subd. (b).) ¿
 
To qualify for equitable relief from a default judgment on
the basis of extrinsic mistake or fraud, one must satisfy three elements: “
‘First, the defaulted party must demonstrate that it has a meritorious case.
Second, the party seeking to set aside the default must articulate a
satisfactory excuse for not presenting a defense to the original action. Last
[], the moving party must demonstrate diligence in seeking to set aside the
default once … discovered.’ ” (Rappleyea
v. Campbell (1994) 8 Cal.4th 975, 982 (Rappleyea).)
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 473.5 provides:  
 
“(a)¿When service of a summons has not resulted in actual
notice to a party in time to defend the action and a default or default
judgment has been entered against him or her in the action, he or she may serve
and file a notice of motion to set aside the default or default judgment and
for leave to defend the action. The notice of motion shall be served and filed
within a reasonable time, but in no event exceeding the earlier of: (i)¿two
years after entry of a default judgment against him or her; or (ii)¿180 days
after service on him or her of a written notice that the default or default
judgment has been entered. 
 
(b)¿A notice of motion to set aside a default or default
judgment and for leave to defend the action shall designate as the time for
making the motion a date prescribed by subdivision (b) of Section 1005, and it
shall be accompanied by an affidavit showing under oath that the party’s lack
of actual notice in time to defend the action was not caused by his or her
avoidance of service or inexcusable neglect. The party shall serve and file
with the notice a copy of the answer, motion, or other pleading proposed to be
filed in the action. 
 
(c)¿Upon a finding by the court that the motion was made
within the period permitted by subdivision (a) and that his or her lack of
actual notice in time to defend the action was not caused by his or her
avoidance of service or inexcusable neglect, it may set aside the default or
default judgment on whatever terms as may be just and allow the party to defend
the action.”  
 
Here, the Motion states that the
default and default judgment should be vacated/set aside because Defendant was
never served with the summons and complaint. (Motion, p. 2.) Further, Defendant
states the judgment was made without her knowledge and that she “received
notice by Department of Motor Vehicle [(“DMV”)] that the plaintiff had
requested license suspension.” (Motion, p. 1.) After receiving the documents
from the DMV, Defendant states she “read the complaint and believed that [she]
had a good and substantial defense to the action, and continue to believe so,
as shown by [her] proposed answer to the complaint.” (Motion, p. 2.)
 
However, Defendant fails to present “a
concise statement of the law, evidence and arguments relied on, and a
discussion of the statutes, cases, and textbooks cited in support of the
position advanced.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rules 3.1113.) Defendant’s Motion
does not include any legal authority or clear discussion of the authority
supporting the stated positions. Defendant does not cite any case law or
statutory authority that authorizes this Court to set aside the default or default
judgment. 
 
More importantly, in review of the
Proof of Service on file, it appears that Tameka Wells was served personally at
12951 Benson Ave. #133, Chino, CA 91710, on June 16, 2022 at 8:31 a.m., which
Tameka Wells does not dispute in her Motion to be her address.  
 
Further, Defendant states she attached
a proposed answer, but no such document is included with the Motion.
 
Accordingly, Defendant’s Motion is DENIED
WITHOUT PREJUDICE.  
 
IV.             
Conclusion
& Order
 
For the foregoing reasons, Defendant
Tameka Wells Motion to Set Aside/Vacate the Default and Default Judgment is DENIED
WITHOUT PREJUDICE.
 
Moving party is ordered to
give notice.
