ANALYSIS:
 
I.                   
Background
 
On November 29, 2021, Plaintiff Nicollee
Inguagiato (“Plaintiff”), proceeding pro se, filed this action against
Defendants Juan Feldman and Ignacio Feldman alleging Breach of Contract and
Negligence causes of action. (Compl., ¶¶ 1, 8.) 
 
On August 31, 2023, Plaintiff filed a
First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) against Defendant Juan Feldman (“Defendant”),
alleging Breach of Contract and Common Counts causes of action. (FAC, ¶¶ 1, 8.)
 
On December 12, 2023, the Court found
that no proof of service had been filed for the FAC and dismissed the FAC
without prejudice pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 583.410.
(12/12/23 Order.)
 
On February 22, 2024, the Court
granted Plaintiff’s Motion to Vacate Dismissal of FAC and set an OSC Re:
Failure to File Proof of Service. (2/22/24 Order.)
 
On May 6, 2024, the Court ordered
service of the complaint shall be ordered upon Defendant by publication in the
Los Angeles Daily Journal. (5/6/24 Order.)
 
On June 12, 2024, Plaintiff filed
Proof of Publication. 
 
On July 10, 2024, Defendant filed an
Answer to the FAC. 
 
On December 13, 2024, Plaintiff filed
the instant Motion to Compel Further Responses to Requests for Documents and
Request for Monetary Sanctions in the Amount of $5,900 (the “Motion”).
 
On December 18, 2024, the Court granted
in part Plaintiff’s Ex Parte Application to Advance Hearing Date of Plaintiff’s
Motion and to hear the Motion on January 13, 2025, after the motion hearing
cutoff date. (12/18/24 Order.) Further, the Court ordered the parties to meet
and confer telephonically within ten days to discuss any and all outstanding
discovery issues as raised in the Motion. (12/18/24 Order.) 
 
On December 30, 2024, Defendant filed
an Opposition, stating the Motion must be denied as it was scheduled beyond the
applicable motion cut-off deadline via ex parte application in violation of
Code of Civil Procedure section 2024.050 and, in any event, Plaintiff fails to
establish good cause. In (Opp., pp. 2-7.) In the event the Court grants the
Motion, Defendant states the sanction request must be denied since Plaintiff
does not clearly identify who should pay sanctions, Defendant’s objection was
raised in good faith, and the sanctions request is “absurdly disproportionate.”
(Opp., pp. 7-9.) 
 
No Reply has been filed. 
 
The trial in this matter is set for
January 28, 2025. 
 
II.                
Procedural
Issues
 
Plaintiff failed to file proof of
service of the Proposed Order on Defendant. However, given Defendant’s
Opposition, the Court will exercise its discretion to hear the Motion on the
merits. 
 
Additionally, the Court notes
Defendant’s Opposition is untimely. However, the Court considers the arguments
raised therein. 
 
III.             
Legal
Standard 
 
Discovery Requests
 
A party must respond to requests for
production of documents within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260,
subd. (a).) If a party to whom requests for production of documents are
directed does not provide timely responses, the requesting party may move for
an order compelling responses to the discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300,
subd. (c).) The party also waives the right to make any objections, including
one based on privilege or work-product protection. (Code Civ. Proc., §2031.300,
subd. (a).) 
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 94
limits discovery in limited jurisdiction actions to any combination of 35
interrogatories with no subparts, demands to produce documents, and requests
for admission with no subparts. (Code Civ. Proc., § 94, subd. (a).)
 
            Discovery
Responses
 
Parties responding to requests for
production “shall respond separately to each item or category of item by any of
the following: (1) [a] statement that the party will comply with the particular
demand … [;] (2) [a] representation that the party lacks the ability to comply
with the demand … [; or] (3) [a]n objection to the particular demand.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2031.210, subd. (a).)
 
Motions to Compel Further Responses 
 
Code of Civil Procedure section
2031.310, subdivision (a), provides that “[o]n receipt of a response to a
demand for inspection … the demanding party may move for an order compelling
further response to the demand if the demanding party deems that any of the
following apply:  (1) [a] statement of
compliance with the demand is incomplete[;] (2) [a] representation of inability
to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive[; or] (3) [a]n objection in the
response is without merit or too general.” 

 
            Notice
of the motion must be given within 45 days of service of the verified
response, otherwise, the propounding party waives any right to compel a further
response. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (c).) 
 
The motions
must also be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (b)(2).)   
 
            Finally, California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1345 requires
that all motions or responses involving further discovery contain a separate
statement with the text of each request, the response, and a statement of
factual and legal reasons for compelling further responses. (Cal. Rules of
Court, Rule 3.1345, subd. (a)(3)). 
 
IV.             
Discussion
 
As an initial matter, the Court notes
that while Plaintiff moved to compel after 45 days of service of the responses,
Defendant’s responses to the Requests for Production are not verified. Thus, Plaintiff,
the propounding party, did not waive the right to compel a further response.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (c).) 
 
Additionally, the Court notes that, to
date, Plaintiff has submitted evidence of just six discovery requests propounded
on Defendant – namely, the six requests in the Requests for Documents. Thus,
the Court finds Plaintiff is in compliance with Code of Civil Procedure section
94.
 
Accordingly, the Court addresses the
merits of the Motions.
 
In California, discovery statutes
“must be construed liberally in favor of disclosure unless the request is
clearly improper.” Williams v. Superior Court (2017) 3 Cal.5th 531, 541.
“Under the discovery statutes, information is discoverable if it is
unprivileged and is either relevant to the subject matter of the action or
reasonably calculated to reveal admissible evidence.” John B. v. Superior
Court (2006) 38 Cal.4th 1177, 1186. “Discovery may relate to the claim or
defense of the party seeking discovery or of any other party to the action.” Ibid.
“When discovery requests are grossly overbroad on their face, and hence do not
appear reasonably related to a legitimate discovery need, a reasonable
inference can be drawn of an intent to harass and improperly burden.” Obregon
v. Superior Court (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 424, 431.
On receipt of a response to a demand
for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling, the demanding party may move for
an order compelling further response to the demand if the demanding party deems
that any of the following apply: (1) a statement of compliance with the demand
is incomplete; (2) a representation of inability to comply is inadequate,
incomplete, or evasive; or (3) an objection to the response is without merit or
too general. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.310(a)(1)-(3).) Where a party seeks to compel
further responses to requests for production of documents, a showing of good
cause must be established before production may be compelled. Williams v.
Superior Court, supra, 3 Cal.5th 531, 550. 
To establish good cause, a
discovery proponent must identify a disputed fact that is of consequence in the
action and explain how the discovery sought will tend in reason to prove or
disprove that fact or lead to other evidence that will tend to prove or
disprove the fact. Digital Music News LLC v. Superior Court (2014) 226
Cal.App.4th 216, 224. The specific facts must be set forth in a declaration.
Calcor Space Facility, Inc. v. Superior Court (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 216,
224. “In law and motion practice, factual evidence is supplied to the court
by way of declarations.” Ibid. 
A.    Meet and Confer 
 
Plaintiff’s counsel submitted a
declaration that the parties’ counsel attempted to meet and confer via letter
from November 5, 2024 to November 22, 2024, regarding the instant discovery
request to no avail. (Motion, Counts Decl., ¶¶ 5-7, Exh. C.) 
 
B.     Motion to Compel Further Responses to
Request for Production
 
Plaintiff moves to compel responses to
one request for production. (Motion, p. 3; Sep. Statement.)
 
On September 4, 2024, Plaintiff’s
counsel served a copy of Request for Production, Set One, on Defendant. (Motion,
Counts Decl., ¶ 2, Exh. A.) The one request at issue here is Request No. 3,
which seeks all documents that evidence all rental income that Defendant
received for the rental properties each month from June 2018 through November
2020. (Motion, Sep. Statement.)
 
In response to Request No. 3, Defendant
stated: “Objection: This request seeks private financial information and thus
violates Article I, Section 1 of the California Constitution.” (Motion, Sep.
Statement; Counts Decl., Exh. B, p. 2.) 
 
            Defendant
argues that the Motion was filed untimely after the applicable motion cut-off
deadline; however, the Court addressed this issue at the Ex Parte
hearing on December 18, 2024. 
 
            The
Court finds that Plaintiff has shown good cause. Plaintiff’s discovery request
is indeed pertinent to the cause as it seeks documents evidencing, not just
damages needed to calculate the unpaid property management fees owed, but also
to prove the breach of damages needed to calculate the unpaid property
management fees owed, as well a to prove the breach of contract claim itself by
showing Defendant failed to make payments to Plaintiff as agreed. The Court
agrees that the information is integral to Plaintiff’s ability to substantiate
her claims in the matter and meet her burden of proof. The Court further notes
that the Request for Production of Documents, lists in the definitions “RENTAL
PROPERTIES” to include real estate located at 1130 Rose Avenue, Venice, CA
90291; 4268 Jackson Avenue, #A&B) Culver City, CA 90232; and 12711 Mitchell
Avenue, #1, Los Angeles, CA 90066.) This description matches to the properties
listed in the operative Complaint for breach of contract.  
 
            Thus,
Plaintiff has presented specific facts as to why further responses should be
compelled and why the documents requested will tend to prove or disprove a fact
of consequence in this action or will lead to other evidence that will tend to
prove or disprove such fact. In sum, Plaintiff has established good cause. 
 
            Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion to
Compel Defendant to provide a response to Request for Production request No. 3
is GRANTED. Defendant is to provide a response with said documents by January
20, 2025. 
 
C.     Request for Sanctions
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.040
states, “A request for a sanction, shall, in the notice of motion, identify
every person, party, and attorney against whom the sanction is sought, and
specify the type of sanction sought.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.040)
 
Here, Plaintiff requests sanctions of
$5,900.00, reflecting nine hours at $440.00 per hour to bring the instant Motion
and prior Ex Parte Application, two hours at $580.00 per hour to travel to and
attend the Motion hearing, and $60.00 in filing fees. (Motion, Counts Decl., ¶
9.) 
 
The Court finds Plaintiff did not
comply with Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.040. Thus, the Court DENIES the
request for sanctions. 
 
V.
