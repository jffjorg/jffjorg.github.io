[TENTATIVE] ORDER TAKING OFF
 CALENDAR DEFENDANT’S DEMURRER TO FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT
 
       The first
amended complaint alleges that Defendant allegedly misrepresented the finance
contract terms for Plaintiff’s purchase of a vehicle, engaged in fraudulent
debt collection practices, and wrongfully repossessed the vehicle.  Plaintiff alleges 29 causes of action for
statutory violations and other common law claims arising from these facts.           
       Defendant served
this demurrer on Plaintiff, an unrepresented litigant, by electronic mail. However,
electronic service on an unrepresented party is permitted if that party provides
express consent filed with the court and serves that notice on all parties, or
manifesting affirmative consent through electronic means with the court or the
court’s electronic service provider. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1010.6 subd. (c).) The act of
electronic filing “shall not be construed as express consent." (Id.)
            
       There is no
evidence of Plaintiff’s consent to electronic service. Accordingly, the
demurrer is taken off calendar.
