[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING
 DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR TERMINATING SANCTIONS
 
       This
action arises from injuries Plaintiff allegedly sustained in an auto accident. On
May 2, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel served notice on the client that the court
granted counsel’s motion to be relieved as attorney of record. Plaintiff is now
a self-represented litigant.
       Defendant
filed a motion for terminating sanctions on July 16, 2024 for Plaintiff’s
failure to comply with the court’s order of June 27, 2024 to respond to
Defendant’s second document request. While the motion was set for hearing on
August 20, 2024, the court’s record does not reflect that the motion was heard.

       Defendant
filed the identical motion on August 19, 2024, scheduled for hearing for
Tuesday, October 15, 2024. Defendant argues that Plaintiff failed to comply
with the order by July 8, 2024. Defendant timely served Plaintiff with the
motion. Plaintiff did not respond.
       Discovery sanctions are not to be imposed
for punishment, but instead are used to encourage fair disclosure of discovery
to prevent unfairness resulting from the lack of information. (Midwife v. Bernal (1988) 203 Cal.App.3d
57, 64.) The type of sanction imposed should be “appropriate to the
dereliction,” and tailored to accomplish the discovery sought. (Do It Urself Moving &
Storage, Inc. v. Brown, Leifer, Slatkin & Berns (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 27, 35.)
There are two prerequisites for the imposition of a discovery sanction: “(1)
there must be a failure to comply [with a valid discovery order] . . . and (2)
the failure must be willful.” (Young v.
Rosenthal (1989) 212 Cal. App. 3d
96, 114.)
        Plaintiff’s failure to respond to discovery
propounded by Defendant and failure to comply with the court’s order is an
abuse of the discovery process warranting terminating sanctions. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2023.010.) 
       Accordingly, Defendant’s motion
dismissing the action is GRANTED.
