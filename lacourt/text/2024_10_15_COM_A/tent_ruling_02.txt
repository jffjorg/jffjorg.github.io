USA
 
      The complaint
alleges that Defendants employed Plaintiff on December 6, 2021, as a full-time
“finisher.” Defendants allegedly terminated Plaintiff because of a disability that
required Plaintiff to wear a 2-inch custom, platform shoe. Plaintiff alleges
claims for wrongful termination in violation of contract and against public
policy, disability discrimination, and for Defendant’s denial of a workplace
environment free from discrimination and/or retaliation. 
      On February 15,
2024, Plaintiff filed an amendment naming Fu Sheng USA as Doe 1, and F Sheng
Industrial Co. Ltd as Doe 2 (“Defendants”).

requiring service of the application on all parties as well as the California
State Bar with the required application fee. (Michael S. Powers decl.,  ¶ 7, Ex. 1.)

Applicant lives in and is admitted in Missouri. Applicant declares he is in
good standing in the courts where he is admitted to practice and is not
currently suspended and is not disbarred. (Id.) 
      Applicant has
