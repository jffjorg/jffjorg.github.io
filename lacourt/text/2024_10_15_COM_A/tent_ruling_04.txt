[TENTATIVE] ORDER CONTINUING
THE HEARING ON PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR ATTORNEY’S FEES
 
I.       
BACKGROUND
       This
action arises from alleged violations under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty
Act (“SBA”). On August 13, 2024, the court entered judgment in favor of
Plaintiff for $18,537.60 and a payoff of the prior balance owed of $6,606.00
and a payoff of the remaining balance of the lease totaling $43,648.10.
II.     
ARGUMENTS
       Plaintiffs
request an order for $108,957.92 in fees incurred over the last 17 months by
three different law firms, increased by a multiplier of 1.5 for total fees of
$154,029.25. Plaintiffs contend they are also entitled to all costs obtained
totaling $7,386.36. 
       In
opposition, Defendant asks the court to reduce fees by $31,400 for an adjusted
total of $77,557.92. A multiplier is not warranted as the case was not complex.
Even after settlement was agreed upon, Plaintiffs continued to expend time on
discovery, motions, and correspondence which was unnecessary. 
       In
reply, Plaintiff contends that the case settled on May 2, 2024, one day after
Defendant relayed a full, complete, and enforceable settlement offer. The case
settled less than eight weeks before trial. 
III.   
LEGAL STANDARDS
       A
prevailing buyer in an action under the SBA “shall be allowed by the court” to
recover the aggregate amount of costs and expenses, “including attorney’s fees
based on actual time expended, determined by the court to have been reasonably
incurred by the buyer in connection with the commencement and prosecution of
such action.” (Civ.
Code, § 1794 subd.(d).) A prevailing buyer has the burden of showing that
the fees incurred were allowable, reasonably necessary to the conduct of the
litigation, and were reasonable in amount. 
(Pulliam
v. HNL Automotive Inc. (2021) 60 Cal.App.5th 396, 405.) The
reasonable hourly rate is that prevailing in the community for similar work.
(Id.) 
       A reasonable fee can be measured by the
marketplace by analyzing the quality and necessity of services and then
comparing that cost with what other attorneys with similar experience and
ability charge for the same services. (Shaffer
v. Superior Court (1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 993, 1002.)
       In Song-Beverly cases,
the court applies the lodestar method in calculating attorney’s fees, including
the use of fee multipliers where applicable. (Robertson v. Fleetwood Travel Trailers of California, Inc. (2006)
144 Cal.App.4th 785, 818.) The court determines a lodestar
figure “based on a careful compilation of the actual time spent and reasonable
hourly compensation for each attorney.” (Robertson at 819.) The lodestar may be
augmented or diminished “by taking various relevant factors into account
including (1) the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved and the
skill displayed in presenting them; (2) the extent to which the nature of the
litigation precluded other employment by the attorneys; and (3) the contingent
nature of the  fee award, based on the uncertainty of prevailing on
the merits and of establishing eligibility for the award.” (Robertson at 819.) The multiplier is a risk
enhancement based on the probability of loss. (Robertson at 821.)  
       The prevailing party is entitled to
“’compensation for all the hours reasonably spent” in litigating
the action to a successful conclusion. (Ibid., italics in original.)
‘Reasonably spent’ means that time spent ‘in the form of inefficient or
duplicative efforts is not subject to compensation. (Horsford
v. Board of Trustees of California State University
(2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 359, 394.)
       The court may rely on his or her own
experience and is given broad discretion in calculating reasonable attorney’s
fees. (Ketchum
v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1132
["The experienced trial judge is the best judge of the value of
professional services rendered in his court, and while his judgment is of
course subject to review, it will not be disturbed unless the appellate court
is convinced that it is clearly wrong.”].)
IV.   
DISCUSSION
       The
procedure for obtaining costs is governed by California Rules of Court, rule 3.1700,
which requires service and filing of a cost memorandum, ordinarily within 15
days from entry of judgment. (CA
ST CIVIL RULES Rule 3.1700.) The 15-day time limit is mandatory. (Sanabria
v. Embrey (2001) 92 Cal.App.4th 422.) A party opposing costs must,
within the required time limit, file and serve a motion to tax costs. (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1700.) The court’s file does not reflect that Plaintiffs
filed a cost memorandum or that Defendant filed a motion to tax costs. Accordingly,
Plaintiffs’ request for an award of costs is DENIED without prejudice and
subject to compliance with Rule 3.1700. 
       With
respect to attorney’s fees, Plaintiffs request the following fees:



ATTORNEY


HOURLY FEE


BILLED HOURS


TOTAL FEE




 


 


 


 




Pouyan Bohloul


$375


198.76


$74,534.17




John Hanson/and
  paralegal


$600/$200


30.90


$15,606.50




Carey Wood (prior
  counsel) (plus founding partner, and four paralegals)


$410-$500


32.90


$12,167.84




Total fee request


 


 262.56


$102,308.51



 
       The
total fees shown by the evidence does not correspond with Plaintiffs’ request
for a total fee award of $108,957.92. 
        The Court does not find that this case, which
did not concern novel issues or protracted litigation warranted a team of four
attorneys and four paralegals to prosecute which alone suggests overlapping and
inefficient work. Plaintiffs’ request for a lodestar multiplier is DENIED. 
       The
Court has reviewed the billing record and finds that a number of the itemized
tasks are unreasonable, inefficient, and at times duplicative among the eight
individuals who submitted time records. Plaintiffs’ counsel is entitled to
reasonable compensation; however, “‘padding” in the form of inefficient or
duplicative efforts is not subject to compensation." (Ketchum
v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1132.) 
       The
Court is permitted to make “across the board cuts and apply a negative
multiplier” where it determines that the case was not complex. (Warren
v. Kia Motors America, Inc. (2018) 30 Cal.App.5th 24, 41 [permitting a
negative multiplier of 33% to the lodestar fee request of $351,055.26,
resulting in a fee award of $115,848.24].) 
       Proper
factors to consider in applying a negative reduction are the lack of
complexity, that the matter did not go to trial, that name partners were doing
work that could have been done by lower-billing attorneys, and that all the
attorneys were doing work that could have been done by paralegals, thus
applying a 39% reduction in the lodestar. (Morris
v. Hyundai Motor America (2019) 41 Cal.App.5th 24, 41.) These factors
are applicable here. 
       The
billing records of Carey Wood requires more detail. Plaintiffs shall reformat
the billing records and regroup the items by each attorney and each paralegal,
to separately reflect the itemized tasks, hours, and rates hours followed by a
separate total of hours incurred and billed by each person to facilitate the
court’s review.  
V.     
CONCLUSION
       Based
on the foregoing, the hearing on this motion is continued to November 26, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. in Department A of the Compton Courthouse. Attorney Carey Wood is
ordered to submit the reformatted billing records ten days prior to the
hearing. Attorney Bouloul is ordered to reconcile the discrepancy between the
evidence and total award sought. The request for costs is DENIED without
prejudice subject to compliance with Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1700.
