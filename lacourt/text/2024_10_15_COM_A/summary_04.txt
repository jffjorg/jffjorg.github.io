And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for attorney's fees filed by the plaintiffs, Lourdes Avalos Paz, et al., against Kia America, Inc. The plaintiffs are seeking an order for $108,957.92 in fees incurred over the last 17 months by three different law firms, increased by a multiplier of 1.5 for a total of $154,029.25. The defendant opposes the fee request and asks the court to reduce the fees by $31,400.

The court finds that the case did not concern novel issues or protracted litigation and that the plaintiffs' request for a lodestar multiplier is denied. The court also finds that a number of the itemized tasks in the billing records are unreasonable, inefficient, and duplicative, and that "padding" in the form of inefficient or duplicative efforts is not subject to compensation.

The court orders the plaintiffs to reformat the billing records and regroup the items by each attorney and each paralegal, and it continues the hearing on the motion to November 26, 2024. The court also denies the request for costs without prejudice, subject to compliance with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1700.
