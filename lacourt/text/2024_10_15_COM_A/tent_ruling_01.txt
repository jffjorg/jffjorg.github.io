[TENTATIVE] ORDER 
MOTION TO UNSEAL THE RECORD PURSUANT TO THE PARTIES’ STIPULATION
 
       This
is an unlawful detainer action that the parties resolved through a stipulated
judgment filed January 11, 2022. Plaintiff argues that Defendant failed to
comply with the terms of the agreement. The parties agreed that the record
would remain confidential so long as defendant complies with the terms of
settlement. (Stip. Jgmt. filed 1/11/22, ¶ 6.)
       Plaintiff
argues that Defendant failed to comply with the requirement for payments and
was subsequently locked out on May 12, 2023. Therefore, the court should unseal
the record.
       Public
access to unlawful detainer actions is limited until 60 days after the filing
of the complaint, subject to certain exceptions showing good cause. (U.D.
Registry, Inc. v. Municipal Court (1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 671, 674; (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1161.2.)
       Given
that the complaint was filed on November 8, 2021, and pursuant to the parties’
stipulation, the motion is GRANTED. The court orders this case unsealed.
