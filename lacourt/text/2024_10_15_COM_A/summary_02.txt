And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge regarding a motion for admission pro hac vice filed by Michael S. Powers, counsel for the defendants FS Precision Tech. Co., LLC, et al. The motion is granted, allowing Mr. Powers to practice law in California for the purposes of this case.

The case involves Jorge Delgado, the plaintiff, who was employed by the defendants as a finisher from December 6, 2021, until his termination due to a disability that required him to wear a 2-inch custom platform shoe. The plaintiff alleges claims for wrongful termination, disability discrimination, and denial of a workplace environment free from discrimination and/or retaliation.

The defendants have filed an amendment naming Fu Sheng USA as Doe 1 and Fu Sheng Industrial Co. Ltd as Doe 2. Mr. Powers is a lawyer from Missouri who is not a member of the California State Bar, but he has been retained by the defendants' local counsel, K.W. Kampe, III. No opposition to the motion has been filed, and therefore the motion is granted.
