And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on a motion for attorney's fees brought by Pedro Mauricio Mendoza, the plaintiff, against General Motors, LLC, the defendant. The case arose from alleged violations of the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act in connection with the purchase of a vehicle. The plaintiff is seeking an award of statutory attorney's fees of $33,777.00 with a multiplier of 1.5.

The judge has reviewed the billing records and finds that a number of the itemized tasks are unreasonable, inefficient, and duplicative. The judge has reduced the plaintiff's total billed hours from 112.97 hours to 90.38 hours and has determined that the following hourly fee is reasonable: $450.00 for Carey Wood, $350.00 for Lara Rogers, $425.00 for Erik Whitman, and $200.00 for paralegals.

Based on the foregoing, the judge has awarded reduced fees of $31,971.00. The judge has denied the plaintiff's request for a lodestar multiplier and has applied a 39% reduction in the lodestar fee request due to the lack of complexity in the case and the excessive billing by the attorneys.
