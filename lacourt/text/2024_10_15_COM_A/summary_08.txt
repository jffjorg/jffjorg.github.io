And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the demurrer to the first amended complaint filed by the defendant shall be taken off the calendar. The plaintiff, an unrepresented litigant, did not provide consent to electronic service of the demurrer, which was served to them by electronic mail. The judge is relying on California Civil Procedure Code section 1010.6, subdivision (c), which permits electronic service of a party's consent, but notes that the act of electronic filing does not constitute express consent. As a result, the demurrer will not be heard on the scheduled date of October 15, 2024.
