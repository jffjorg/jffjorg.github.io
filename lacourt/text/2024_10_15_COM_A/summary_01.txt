And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

On October 15, 2024, Judge [unnamed] issued a tentative ruling granting the motion to unseal the record in the case of CD Asset Company v. Yigal Keren, individually and dba Socially Oriented United Living, Inc. The parties had previously stipulated to a confidential record as part of a settlement agreement filed on January 11, 2022. However, the plaintiff claimed that the defendant failed to comply with the terms of the settlement, including making payments, and was subsequently locked out on May 12, 2023. The court found that, given the parties' stipulation and the defendant's non-compliance with the settlement terms, the motion to unseal the record was granted. The court ordered the case unsealed, citing California Code of Civil Procedure section 1161.2, which limits public access to unlawful detainer actions until 60 days after the filing of the complaint.
