And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendant's motion for terminating sanctions in this personal injury action. The plaintiff, who is now self-represented, failed to respond to the defendant's second document request and did not comply with the court's order to do so. The judge found that the plaintiff's failure to comply with the order is an abuse of the discovery process and warrants terminating sanctions. The judge cites relevant case law and statutes, including Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010, and notes that discovery sanctions are intended to encourage fair disclosure of discovery and prevent unfairness resulting from lack of information. As a result, the defendant's motion to dismiss the action is granted.
