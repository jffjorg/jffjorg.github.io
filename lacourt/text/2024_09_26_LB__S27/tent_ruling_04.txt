 Case Number:  23LBCV02201    Hearing Date:   September 26, 2024    Dept:  S27 Thomas H. Schelly, attorney of
record for Plaintiff, Evangelina Alfaro, seeks to be relieved as counsel,
declaring the relationship has broken down such that relief is necessary.  The motion is denied for two reasons.
 
First, the proof of service of the
moving papers is unsigned.
 
Second, Counsel declares he
confirmed Client’s address by certified mail, return receipt requested.  The Court is aware that Counsel often send
documents in this manner but do not obtain the signed return receipt.  Thus, if Counsel re-files the motion, Counsel
must provide a copy of the signed return receipt with the moving papers so the
Court can ensure the address has been confirmed.
 
Counsel is ordered to give notice.
