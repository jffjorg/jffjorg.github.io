And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on the motion for an order of partition by sale filed by Harvey and Devay Reese, the plaintiffs, against Kimo and Lee Reese, the defendants. The plaintiffs seek an interlocutory judgment for partition and sale and appointment of a referee. However, the judge finds that there is no authority permitting the partition determination to be made by way of noticed motion, as opposed to trial. Therefore, the motion is denied.

The judge notes that the parties are unable to agree on how to sell the property and distribute the proceeds, and that the previous listing of the property for sale resulted in an offer below market value. The judge advises the parties that if they are successful in showing the need for partition at trial, appointment of a referee is required. The judge also encourages the parties to work together to list the property prior to trial and accept the best sale price they can obtain.

Finally, the judge orders the parties to give notice and provides instructions for submitting on the tentative ruling.
