And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has seen a significant increase in motions to compel further responses in lemon law cases, and has become frustrated with counsel's failure to meet and confer in good faith to resolve these disputes. The Court has ruled on similar discovery motions in other cases and finds that counsel can easily resolve the issues on these motions. The Court expects counsel to meet and confer with its prior rulings in mind and to file a joint statement of items in dispute. If the parties are unable to resolve their issues, they must file briefs and declarations detailing their efforts to meet and confer and making any argument against imposition of sanctions. The hearing on the motion is continued to October 24, 2024, and the parties are ordered to give notice and to submit on the tentative ruling.
