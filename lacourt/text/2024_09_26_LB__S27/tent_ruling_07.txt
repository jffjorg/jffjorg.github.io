Basic
Law Governing Medi-Cal Lien Recovery
The Rutter Guide on Personal Injury Law provides the following synopsis
of the law regarding contested Medi-Cal liens asserted in connection with
personal injury settlements.  The
treatise, of course, is not a primary authority, but the Court has used the
treatise as a jumping-off point in analyzing the issues.  The Guide states the following:
7. [1:56] Evaluate Potential Subrogation Rights and Liens for
Government-Provided Benefits: A client's injury or death claim may also be
affected by government rights of reimbursement for benefits paid to the client
(or decedent).
 
a. [1:56.1] Medi-Cal and related medical liens: Under the Medi-Cal
program, eligible beneficiaries receive benefits in the form of payments to
health care providers who render medical services to or on behalf of the
beneficiaries (Welf. & Inst.C. § 14000 et seq.). In turn, the State,
through the Director of the Department of Health Care Services and the
providers, may obtain reimbursement of those benefits from the beneficiary's
personal injury recovery. [Welf. & Inst.C. § 14124.71 et seq.; see Fitch v.
Select Products Co. (2005) 36 C4th 812, 818-821, 31 CR3d 591, 594-596;  McMillian v. Stroud (2008) 166 CA4th 692,
698, 83 CR3d 261, 266-267]
(1) [1:56.2] State's first lien against personal injury recovery: The
Director of Health Care Services has a right to recover the reasonable value of
the benefits provided from any insurance (e.g., uninsured motorist coverage)
payable to the Medi-Cal beneficiary or from a third party responsible for the
Medi-Cal beneficiary's injuries. When the beneficiary asserts a claim against
the insurer or third party, the State is afforded a first lien against the
portion of the recovery representing past medical expenses (see ¶ 1:56.4 ff.),
reduced by (a) 25% to defray attorney fees and (b) the portion of litigation
expenses that the amount recovered on the lien (before deducting attorney fees
and litigation expenses) bears to the beneficiary's total recovery. [Welf.
& Inst.C. §§ 14124.70(d), 14124.71(a), (d), 14124.72(c), (d), 14124.76(a),
14124.78; see  Branson v. Sharp
Healthcare, Inc. (2011) 193 CA4th 1467, 1474, 123 CR3d 462, 466;  Riddell v. State of Calif. (1996) 50 CA4th
1607, 1611-1612, 58 CR2d 555, 557—Medi-Cal lien attaches even when third party
tortfeasor is another State agency]
…
(b) [1:56.4] Determination of lien amount—allocation between medical
and other damages: “All reasonable efforts shall be made” to obtain the
Director's advance agreement as to what portion of a settlement, judgment or
award represents payment for medical expenses (see ¶ 1:56.2). Where advance
agreement cannot be reached, the court must resolve the dispute. [Welf. &
Inst.C. § 14124.76(a)]
1) [1:56.4a] Motion procedure: Either the Director or the beneficiary
may seek resolution of the allocation dispute by filing a motion in the pending
action against the third party. …
The court has authority to render a “final determination” of the
parties' rights and obligations with respect to the Director's lien. [Welf.
& Inst.C. § 14124.76(c); see  Branson
v. Sharp Healthcare, Inc. (2011) 193 CA4th 1467, 1476, 123 CR3d 462, 468—court
may order Director to refund overpayment of lien amount]
2) [1:56.5] Ratio of medical expenses to total claim where no
allocation made in recovery: Where a settlement, judgment or award fails to
specify the portion representing past medical expense damages (or where a
settlement allocation appears suspect or otherwise unreliable), the court
should be “guided” by “relevant statutory and case law” in determining the
appropriate amount of the State's lien. [Welf. & Inst.C. § 14124.76(a); see
Daniel C. v. White Memorial Med. Ctr. (2022) 83 CA5th 789, 811-814, 299 CR3d
571, 586-589—in minor's wrongful life case, trial court erred in failing to
allocate settlement between past medical expenses, other compensable expenses
paid by plaintiff and any future compensable medical expenses Medi-Cal had not
demonstrated it was reasonably likely to pay; 
Lopez v. Daimler Chrysler Corp. (2009) 179 CA4th 1373, 1386-1387, 102
CR3d 285, 293-294—not an abuse of discretion to make allocation based on
injured party's evidence where Department failed to explain or present evidence
to support its allocation;  Lima v. Vouis
(2009) 174 CA4th 242, 260-261, 94 CR3d 183, 196-197—court erred in making
allocation that failed to distinguish settlement portions attributable to
medical expenses from other damages]
If the beneficiary's injuries have pretty much run their economic
course by the time the recovery is obtained, a lien amount in the proportion
that medical expenses bear to the total amount of the claim (not the recovery)
may be considered appropriate. [ Bolanos v. Sup.Ct. (State Dept. of Health Care
Services) (2008) 169 CA4th 744, 754-755, 87 CR3d 174, 181-182; see  McMillian v. Stroud (2008) 166 CA4th 692,
701-705, 83 CR3d 261, 269-272—where Director established lien based on medical
care provided to beneficiary, beneficiary who had exclusive access to evidence
regarding settlement discussions failed to satisfy his burden of proving lien
should be reduced;  Espericueta v. Shewry
(2008) 164 CA4th 615, 625-627, 79 CR3d 517, 525-526—where court approved
minor's settlement that included payment of Director's lien, minor could not
thereafter reduce lien based on evidence that was available but not presented
in approval petition]
• [1:56.5a] Example: A Medi-Cal beneficiary and tortfeasor settled for
$150,000, and the Director asserted a medical lien for $86,676. The court added
the $250,000 maximum MICRA noneconomic damages to produce a total claim of
$336,676. It then reduced the lien to $39,004 to reflect the ratio of medical
expenses to the total claim—i.e., $150,000 divided by $336,676, rounded off to
45%. (The lien was further reduced to defray attorney fees; see ¶ 1:56.2.) [
Martinez v. Department of Health Care Services (2018) 19 CA5th 370, 373-375,
227 CR3d 483, 484-486]

Summary
of Issues
The parties’ briefs take myriad twists and turns, and the issues
presented are complicated.  The Court has
narrowed the issues to the following:
·        
Can
Medi-Cal recover benefits paid by a third party managed care plan?
·        
Did
Medi-Cal establish the validity of its lien?
·        
What
portion of the settlement should be attributed to past medical expenses?
o   
Can
future medical expenses be included in the settlement attribution?
·        
How
should the lien be calculated?
 
e.     Third Party Managed Care Claim
DHCS explains that, under current
law, Medi-Cal no longer pays medical providers directly for care rendered.  Instead, Medi-Cal pays third party managed
care plans (health insurance companies) a fixed sum for each insured, which sum
does not change based on how much care the insureds receive.  The issue, therefore, is whether Medi-Cal can
assert its lien based on the full amount paid by Health Net.  Plaintiff argues that, because the statute
says “reimbursement,” Medi-Cal can only assert a lien for the amount it
actually paid to Health Net, which would be the fixed sum paid to all Health
Net’s Medi-Cal qualified insureds.  DHCS
argues it can assert a lien for the full amount paid by Health Net.  
 
Notably, 42 U.S.C. §1396a(a)(25)(I)
obligates Health Net to assign all recovery rights over to Medi-Cal.  Neither party cites any case law directly on
point on this issue.  The Court
understands Plaintiff’s position, which is that the statute uses the word
“reimburse,” and reimburse has the dictionary definition of paying back monies
actually spent.  That said, the entire
scheme for determining the amount of the lien to be paid out of the settlement would
be rendered meaningless if the payments by the third party health insurance
provider were not taken into consideration. 
The Court finds Medi-Cal, which by law has been assigned Health Net’s
rights to recovery, has the right and duty to assert its lien for all amounts
spent by Health Net.
f.      Validity
and Amount of Lien
DHCS contends the proper amount of
its lien is $224,189.79.  DHCS supports
this contention with the Declaration of Vibha J. Khalasi, a Supervisor for
Clerical and Third Party Liability Claims Operations at Health Net.  Plaintiff objects to the Khalasi
Declaration.  The objections are
overruled.  The Court finds the
declaration is sufficient to establish Health Net actually paid the amount of
the lien, finds the amount is objectively reasonable in light of the injuries
sustained and care provided, and finds there is no evidence to contest this
amount was actually paid.  
 
g.     Apportionment
of Settlement
The crux of the issue between the
parties is how the Court should apportion the value of the settlement.  Both parties agree that Medi-Cal can only
enforce its lien in a proportionate manner. 

 
The crux of the holding in Ahlborn,
which California has since codified, is that Medi-Cal cannot recover more than
the ratio of the settlement to the entire claim.  In other words, if a settlement is for $10
and a claim is for $100, then Medi-Cal can recover 10% of its lien.  
 
Plaintiff herein argues that the
value of his claim is approximately $11,382,123, with a claim for $250,000
(Micra cap) in pain and suffering, $3,445,202 in lost future wages, $7,467,889
in future medical, attendant, and other needs, and $219,022 (should be
224,189.79) in medical expenses. 
Plaintiff therefore contends his settlement represents 43.93% of his
total claim value, and therefore DHCS can only recover 43.93% of its total
expenditures.  
DHCS correctly notes, in opposition
to the motion, that Ahlborn considered a situation where the parties had
stipulated to the reasonable value of the claim, which they have not done
here.  It argues both that (a) it does
not agree to the value of the overall claim, and (b) the future medical
expenses should be considered as part of the DHCS portion of the claim, such
that no reduction is necessary.  
While the Court understands that
DHCS does not agree with Plaintiff’s valuation of the claim, DHCS has offered
no alternative calculation.  The Court
finds the calculations are objectively reasonable, as Plaintiff was a teenager
when he sustained the permanent and life-altering damages that formed the basis
of this case, such that many years of lost earnings and future medical care are
in play.  The Court therefore accepts
Plaintiff’s calculation of the value of his claim.  
 
The more difficult issue is whether
the future medical damages should be attributed to the lien value or to the
non-lien claim value.  DHCS contends
Medi-Cal covers the “vast majority” of the services and items enumerated in
Plaintiff’s Life Care Plan, and other services not normally covered may be
covered with applicable wavers. 
Plaintiff, in reply, contends the declarations upon which DHCS bases
this contention are subject to objection, as they fail to specify which
services are covered and fail to establish reasonable probability, as opposed
to “possibility,” of coverage of services that “may” be covered.  The Court overrules the objections, but does
wish to obtain more specific argument on this issue at the hearing.
 
The Court will review this issue
with the parties at the time of the hearing. 
The Court does not expect the parties to go through the voluminous Life
Care Plan line by line.  The parties
should, however, be prepared at argument to provide a detailed analysis of the
percentage of care from the Life Care Plan that will be covered by Medi-Cal
(through its third party insurer).  The
Court will then work with the parties to calculate the total value of the
proper lien reduction, including the reductions the parties agree upon for
attorneys’ fees (25%) and costs (proportionate) once a decision regarding the
appropriate value of the future medical care claim that will be covered by
Medi-Cal has been rendered.
 
The Court asks Counsel to
make arrangements to appear remotely at the hearing on the motion.
