And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a lemon law case, addressing a surge in motions to compel further responses and PMK depositions. The judge finds that the parties' failure to meet and confer in good faith is causing unnecessary delays and increasing attorneys' fees. The judge orders the parties to meet and confer in good faith and file a joint statement of items in dispute. If the parties are unable to resolve their issues, they must file briefs and declarations detailing their efforts to meet and confer. The judge sets a continued hearing date and warns that if the parties do not submit on the tentative, they should arrange to appear remotely.
