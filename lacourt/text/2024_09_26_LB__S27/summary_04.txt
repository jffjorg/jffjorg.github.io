And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case 23LBCV02201. Thomas H. Schelly, the attorney for plaintiff Evangelina Alfaro, has moved to be relieved as counsel, claiming that the relationship has broken down. The Judge has denied the motion for two reasons: first, the proof of service of the moving papers is unsigned, and second, although counsel claims to have confirmed the client's address through certified mail, the Court is skeptical since counsel often sends documents without obtaining a signed return receipt. To rectify this, the Judge orders counsel to provide a copy of the signed return receipt with the moving papers if counsel re-files the motion. The Judge also reminds the parties that they must indicate their intention to submit on the tentative by emailing the Court and must arrange to appear remotely if they do not submit on the tentative.
