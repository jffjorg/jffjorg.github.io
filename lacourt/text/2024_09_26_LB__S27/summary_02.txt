And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding a petition to approve a compromise of a minor's claim. The petition was originally scheduled for a hearing on September 26, 2024, but due to lack of timely papers in support of the petition, the hearing has been continued to October 24, 2024. The parties must file the petition and all related papers at least 16 court days prior to the hearing and serve them on all parties to the action. The parties who intend to submit on the tentative ruling must send an email to the court indicating their intention to do so. If a party does not submit on the tentative ruling, they must make arrangements to appear remotely at the hearing.
