Thomas D.
 Sands, Esq. seeks to be relieved as counsel of record for defendants
 Corinthian Hospice Inc. and Abegail Cook (collectively, “Defendants”) on
grounds that effective representation is impossible based on failure to
 cooperate and a breakdown in communication. Absent a showing of
resulting prejudice, an attorney’s request for withdrawal should be granted. (People
v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406.) 
The Court notes that trial in this
matter is not yet set and no prejudice will result from granting this motion.
However, the proposed orders that are on file need to be revised. Counsel needs
to check Items 3a and 5a and indicate that the addresses provided are “current”
in Item 6. The revised proposed order should also list the case management
conference scheduled for April 23, 2024, and the upcoming hearings on discovery
motions which are scheduled for July 8 and 9, and August 5, 6, and 7, 2024. Last,
Item 9 of the proposed orders incorrectly states that trial has been set
(despite not specifying the date, time, or place as required). 
Accordingly, the hearing on these
motions is continued to April 15, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. in Department 3 of the
Alhambra Courthouse. The revised proposed orders should be filed no later than April
11, 2024.  The Court is imposing a stringent
turn-around schedule on this revision so as not to re-schedule the April 23,
2024, Case Management Conference.
 
Moving party to give notice.
 
Dated
this 10th
day of April 2024
