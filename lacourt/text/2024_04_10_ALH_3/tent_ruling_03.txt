          On February
6, 2024, defendant City of Pasadena (“City”) filed this motion to compel
plaintiff Jessica Austin’s (“Plaintiff”) further responses to Form
Interrogatories-General, Set One, Form Interrogatories-Employment Law, Set One,
Requests for Production of Documents, Set One, and Requests for Admission, Set
One. Plaintiff served objections in response to City’s discovery requests on
the grounds that City was in default and unable to propound discovery. Plaintiff
also objected to the term “Incident” as compound, conjunctive, vague, ambiguous
and overbroad. Plaintiff additionally objected on the grounds of
attorney-client privilege and that the information sought could only be
disclosed following a Pitchess motion. 
          On March 5,
2024, the Court set aside the default which had been entered against City on
November 14, 2023. 
          On March 25,
2024, Plaintiff filed her opposition to this motion. Plaintiff argues that the
discovery was improperly served and the motion improperly filed while City was
in default. Plaintiff does not mention that she also served discovery requests
on City during this period of default or that City served responses. 
          On April 3,
2024, City filed the declaration of its defense counsel David C. Casarrubias,
in which Mr. Casarubbias reported that both Plaintiff and the City re-served
their discovery requests on March 19, 2024, after the default was set aside. 
          Because the
default was recently set aside and the parties have each re-served discovery
requests which were improperly served while City was in default, the Court
takes the motion off calendar as moot. 
Both parties’ requests for sanctions
are DENIED.

I.           
INTRODUCTION
On
August 15, 2023, plaintiff Jessica Austin filed this action against City of
Pasadena (“City”) and named Pasadena Police Department (“PPD”) as a separate
defendant. Plaintiff alleges that she was employed as a full-time sworn police
officer, hired in February of 2019. (Compl., ¶¶ 5, 16.) In or about September
2021, Plaintiff was investigated for allegations of misconduct. (Compl., ¶ 17.)
Plaintiff alleges that the manner in which the investigation was conducted
violated her rights under Government Code section 3300 et seq; the memorandum
of understanding between the Pasadena Police Officers Association and the City,
and City’s policy. (Ibid.) 
On
November 30, 2023, City and PPD filed this demurrer and motion to strike. City
argues that Plaintiff’s Second Cause of Action fails because Plaintiff has not
exhausted her administrative remedies and her Fourth Cause of Action is
uncertain because it is unclear which claims against the City are being brought
under the Meyers-Milias-Brown Act (“MMBS”). PPD demurs to the entire Complaint
on the grounds that it is misjoined as a defendant. City also moves to strike allegations
seeking damages for violations of the California Constitution’s due process
clause. 
II.         
LEGAL
STANDARD
A.  
Demurrer
A demurrer for sufficiency tests
whether the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007)
147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When considering demurrers, courts read the
allegations liberally and in context. In a demurrer proceeding, the defects
must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian
v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) A demurrer tests the
pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters. Therefore, it
lies only where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are
judicially noticed. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 430.30, 430.70.) At the pleading
stage, a plaintiff need only allege ultimate facts sufficient to apprise the
defendant of the factual basis for the claim against him. (Semole v.
Sansoucie (1972) 28 Cal. App. 3d 714, 721.) ¿
B.  
Motion
to Strike
The court may, upon motion, or at any
time in its discretion, and upon terms it deems proper, strike any irrelevant,
false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading. (Code Civ. Proc., § 436,
subd. (a).) The court may also strike all or any part of any pleading not drawn
or filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order
of the court. (Code Civ. Proc., § 436, subd. (b).) The grounds for a motion to
strike are that the pleading has irrelevant, false, or improper matter, or has
not been drawn or filed in conformity with laws. (Code Civ. Proc., § 436.) The
grounds for moving to strike must appear on the face of the pleading or by way
of judicial notice. (Code Civ. Proc., § 437.)
III.       
DISCUSSION
A.  
Timeliness

As an initial matter, the Court addresses
Plaintiff’s claim that the demurrer and motion to strike are untimely due to
Defendants’ ineffective attempts to obtain an automatic extension to respond.
First, insofar as the demurrer is untimely, the Court treats the demurrer as a
motion for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 438. Second, a motion to strike may be brought within the time allowed
to respond or “at any time in [the court’s discretion].” (Code Civ. Proc., §
436.) Therefore, the Court proceeds to evaluate the demurrer and motion to
strike on their merits. 
B.  
Demurrer
to Second Cause of Action
Plaintiff’s second cause of action
alleges that she was retaliated against for engaging in whistleblowing
activities protected under Labor Code sections 1102.5 and 1102.6. (Compl., ¶¶
105-106.) City demurs to this cause of action on the grounds that Plaintiff has
failed to exhaust all administrative remedies and only alleges that she has
“attempted” to do so. (Compl., ¶ 99.) 
Defendant relies on Campbell v. Regents
of University of California (2005) 35 Cal.4th 311, 321, which included
“internal grievance procedures” as administrative remedies. In opposition, Plaintiff
argues Campbell is distinguishable because it was decided before the
Legislature in 2014 implemented Labor Code section 244, which states that an
individual “is not required to exhaust administrative remedies or procedures in
order to bring a civil action under any provision of this code, unless that
section under which the action is brought expressly requires exhaustion of an
administrative remedy.” This argument is unpersuasive. In Terris v. County
of Santa Barbara (2018) 20 Cal.App.5th 551, 556-558, the Second Appellate
District noted that section 244’s reference to “administrative remedies” only
refers to Labor Commissioner claims and held that nothing in the legislative
history of section 244 indicated an intent to overturn Campbell. Additionally,
Plaintiff states in her opposition that her employment has been reinstated. 
Accordingly, City’s demurrer is
SUSTAINED with leave to amend.  
C.  
Demurrer
to Fourth Cause of Action
City demurs to Plaintiff’s cause of
action under the MMBA on the grounds that it is uncertain. Demurrers for
uncertainty are disfavored and should only be sustained where the complaint is
so uncertain that the demurring defendant cannot reasonably respond thereto
(see, e.g., Khoury v. Maly's of Calif., Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612,
616). 
Here, Plaintiff's Complaint is not so
uncertain that City cannot reasonably respond to it.  The Complaint specifically alleges violations
of the MMBA through a blanket “gag order” (see Complaint, ¶30, ¶31 and ¶131) and
the failure to provide a copy of the complaint giving rise to the
administrative investigation. (Compl., ¶¶ 35, 133). Plaintiff also alleges Defendants
failed to comply with the Memorandum of Understanding by failing to provide
required documents to Plaintiff prior to her interrogation. (Compl., ¶¶ 32-33,
35, 134.) Plaintiff also alleges that the failure to comply with the Memorandum
of Understanding constitutes a unilateral change in working conditions without
meeting and conferring. (Compl., ¶ 134.) Moreover, even if the pleading is
somewhat vague, “ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery
procedures.” (Khoury, supra, 14 Cal.App.4th at p. 616.) To the
extent that City argues that these are not changes in working conditions which
constitute a violation of the MMBA, this argues that Plaintiff fails to state a
claim, which is not asserted as a basis for its demurrer. 
City’s demurrer is OVERRULED. 
D.  Demurrer Based on Misjoinder of Parties
PPD argues that it should be dismissed
from this case as an improper party. The Court agrees. PPD is a subdivision of
the City and the proper defendant is City. (See Thompson v. City of Petaluma
(2014) 231 Cal.App.4th 101, 103, n.1.)
PPD’s demurrer is SUSTAINED in its
entirety without leave to amend. Because the demurrer is sustained, Defendants’
motion to strike, insofar as it requests to strike PPD as a defendant from this
action, is moot. 
E.  
Motion
to Strike Requests for Damages for Violation of Due Process
City moves to strike Plaintiff’s requests
for damages in her Third Cause of Action on the grounds that she cannot recover
damages for alleged violations of the California Constitution’s due process
clause. City cites to Javor v. Taggart (2002) 98 Cal.App.4th 795, 807,
in which the Second Appellate District stated, “It is beyond question that a
plaintiff is not entitled to damages for a violation of the due process clause
or the equal protection clause of the state Constitution.” 
In opposition, Plaintiff argues that
her due process claims entitle her to back pay if she prevails at trial.
Plaintiff relies on Barber v. State Personnel Board (1976) 18 Cal.3d 395,
which City contends is only applicable to “Skelly violations”, not
general due process violations. City’s distinction is unpersuasive where Plaintiff’s
Complaint is essentially alleging a Skelly violation, i.e., a violation
of her right to pre-disciplinary and post-disciplinary due process based on her
vested right to continued employment as a civil servant. Moreover, City’s
emphasis on Plaintiff’s recent reinstatement and back pay relies on extrinsic
evidence which is not available for consideration on a motion to strike. 
Accordingly, the motion to strike is
DENIED.  
 
IV.       
CONCLUSION
City’s demurrer is SUSTAINED with 20
days’ leave to amend as to the Second Cause of Action and OVERRULED as to the
Fourth Cause of Action.
PPD’s demurrer is SUSTAINED in its
entirety without leave to amend. 
City’s motion to strike is DENIED with
respect to Plaintiff’s claim for damages associated with her due process claim.
The motion to strike is MOOT as to the references to PPD as a defendant within
the Complaint.
