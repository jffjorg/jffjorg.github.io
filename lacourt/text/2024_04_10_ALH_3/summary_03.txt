Here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The tentative ruling addresses the motion to compel further responses to written discovery, as well as a demurrer and motion to strike filed by the defendants. The plaintiff, Jessica Austin, alleges that she was retaliated against for engaging in whistleblowing activities protected under Labor Code sections 1102.5 and 1102.6. The defendants argue that the plaintiff has not exhausted all administrative remedies and that her claims under the Meyers-Milias-Brown Act (MMBA) are uncertain.

The tentative ruling sustains the city's demurrer to the plaintiff's Second Cause of Action, which alleges retaliation against the plaintiff for engaging in whistleblowing activities. The ruling overrules the city's demurrer to the plaintiff's Fourth Cause of Action, which alleges violations of the MMBA. The tentative ruling also denies the city's motion to strike the plaintiff's requests for damages for violations of due process.

The tentative ruling also addresses the defendants' demurrer to the plaintiff's Fourth Cause of Action, which alleges violations of the MMBA. The defendants argue that the plaintiff's allegations are uncertain and that the plaintiff has not exhausted all administrative remedies. The tentative ruling overrules the defendants' demurrer to the plaintiff's Fourth Cause of Action, finding that the plaintiff's allegations are not uncertain and that the plaintiff has not exhausted all administrative remedies.

The tentative ruling also addresses the defendants' motion to strike the plaintiff's requests for damages for violations of due process. The defendants argue that the plaintiff cannot recover damages for violations of the California Constitution's due process clause. The tentative ruling denies the defendants' motion to strike, finding that the plaintiff's allegations of due process violations are valid.
