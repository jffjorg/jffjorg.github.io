I.           
INTRODUCTION
Plaintiffs Michael Machowsky and
Cameron Machowsky (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) filed this action against Ford
Motor Company (“Defendant”) on May 8, 2023. This motion is for $63,252.09 in
attorneys’ fees and costs following a settlement agreement entered into between
the parties on December 11, 2023, which identified Plaintiffs as the prevailing
parties. 
II.         
FACTUAL
AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND
 
On March 15, 2023, Plaintiffs submitted
a claim through Defendant’s third-party dispute resolution provider, the Better
Business Bureau Auto Line program (“BBB Auto Line”), requesting that Defendant
repurchase their 2020 Ford Ranger (“Subject Vehicle.”) (Sanjur-Van Brande
Decl., ¶ 6.) An arbitration hearing was held through BBB Auto Line on April 18,
2023, but no decision was rendered within 40 days of the opening of the claim
(April 24, 2023). (Ibid.) Therefore, Plaintiffs filed this action on May
8, 2023. (Ibid.) On May 9, 2023, BBB Auto Line issued its decision, found
the Subject Vehicle to be a lemon, and ordered Defendant to repurchase the
vehicle within 30 days. (Ibid.) Defendant accepted this decision on May
11, 2023, giving it 30 days to complete the repurchase and provide payment.
(Dizon Decl., ¶¶ 6-7.) On May 23, 2023, Defendant requested additional
information from Plaintiffs to complete the repurchase. (Dizon Decl., ¶ 8.) On
May 26, 2023, Defendant presented a settlement offer and release. (Dizon Decl.,
¶ 9.) On May 30, 2023, Plaintiffs’ counsel requested for the registration fee
to be added to the settlement. (Ibid.) On June 19, 2023, Defendant
repurchased the Subject Vehicle. (C. Machowsky Decl., ¶ 7.) 
On December 11, 2023, the parties
entered into a Settlement Agreement. (Sanjur-Van Brande Decl., Ex. 1.) 
III.       
LEGAL
STANDARD
Pursuant
to Civil Code section 1794(d), “[i]f the buyer prevails in an action under this
section, the buyer shall be allowed by the court to recover as part of the
judgment a sum equal to the aggregate amount of costs and expenses, including
attorney's fees based on actual time expended, determined by the court to have
been reasonably incurred by the buyer in connection with the commencement and
prosecution of such action.” “The lodestar method is applicable to calculating
attorney fees under section 1794, subdivision (d).” (Doppes v. Bentley
Motors, Inc. (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 967, 997.) As stated by the court in Goglin
v. BMW of North America, LLC (2016) 4 Cal.App.5th 462: 
The statute requires the trial court to make an initial
determination of the actual time expended; and then to ascertain whether under
all the circumstances of the case the amount of actual time expended and the
monetary charge being made for the time expended are reasonable. These
circumstances may include, but are not limited to, factors such as the
complexity of the case and procedural demands, the skill exhibited and the
results achieved. If the time expended or the monetary charge being made for the
time expended are not reasonable under all the circumstances, then the court
must take this into account and award attorney fees in a lesser amount. A
prevailing buyer has the burden of ‘showing that the fees incurred were
“allowable,” were “reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation,” and
were “reasonable in amount.”  
 
(Goglin,
supra at p. 470 [quoting Nightingale v. Hyundai Motor America
(1994) 31 Cal.App.4th 99, 103.) “The reasonableness of attorney fees is within
the discretion of the trial court, to be determined from a consideration of
such factors as the nature of the litigation, the complexity of the issues, the
experience and expertise of counsel and the amount of time involved. The court
may also consider whether the amount requested is based upon unnecessary or
duplicative work.”  (Wilkerson v.
Sullivan (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 443, 448.) “The basis for the trial court's
calculation must be the actual hours counsel has devoted to the case, less
those that result from inefficient or duplicative use of time.” (Horsford v.
Board Of Trustees Of California State University (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th
359, 395.) “The reasonable hourly rate is that prevailing in the community for
similar work.” (PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095.)
“The experienced trial judge is the best judge of the value of professional
services rendered in [her] court.” (Ibid.)
The
Court cannot tie the attorney fee award to the amount of plaintiff’s recovery.
(Warren v. Kia Motors America, Inc. (2018) 30 Cal.App.5th 24, 37 (“it is
inappropriate and an abuse of a trial court's discretion to tie an attorney fee
award to the amount of the prevailing buyer/plaintiff's damages or recovery in
a Song-Beverly Act action.”).) Furthermore, “[t]he law is clear . . . that an
award of attorney fees may be based on counsel's declarations, without
production of detailed time records. (Raining Data Corp. v. Barrenechea
(2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 1363, 1375.) “In challenging attorney fees as excessive
because too many hours of work are claimed, it is the burden of the challenging
party to point to the specific items challenged, with a sufficient argument and
citations to the evidence. General arguments that fees claimed are excessive,
duplicative, or unrelated do not suffice.” (Premier Medical Management
Systems, Inc. v. California Ins. Guarantee Assn. (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th
550, 564.)
IV.       
DISCUSSION
As an initial matter, Defendant argues
that this motion should be denied because the case should have settled in May
2023. (Opp., pp. 4-5.) Defendant argues that Plaintiffs unnecessarily filed
this lawsuit and increased fees and costs by demanding additional money for the
registration fee as part of the settlement agreement and refusing to extend
Defendant’s deadline to comply with the BBB Auto Line decision. This is
unpersuasive. Defendant failed to include the registration fee in its
settlement payment even though it is explicitly included as restitution under
Civil Code section 1793.2(d)(2)(A). Also, Plaintiffs sent a settlement demand
on June 30, 2023, to which Defendant did not respond until November of 2023.
(Supp. Sanjur-Van Brande Decl., ¶ 4.) Instead, Defendant served written
discovery on October 4, 2023. Therefore, the Court rejects Defendant’s
invitation to deny the motion and proceeds to consider the reasonableness of
Plaintiffs’ fee request. 
Plaintiffs state that they have billed
a total of $42,427.34 for this matter and request a multiplier of 1.5 for a
total of $62,474.25 in fees. Plaintiffs provide declarations from counsel, as
well as their billing records to support the fees claimed. (Sanjur-Van Brande
Decl., Ex. 2; ¶¶ 7, 9-10; Kaufman Decl., ¶¶ 6-10.) Plaintiffs seek recovery for
work performed by 3 attorneys and 2 paralegals handling this action: 
-     
Joseph
A. Kaufman, attorney practicing for over 20 years with an hourly rate of $595,
who supervised this matter and billed 10.8 hours setting case evaluation,
settlement, and discovery strategies; 
-     
J.
Brian Lynn, attorney practicing for 17 years with an hourly rate of $475, who
billed 9.4 hours for editing and finalizing Plaintiffs’ discovery responses and
preparing filings related to this fee motion; 
-     
Maria
Sanjur-Van Brande, attorney practicing for 2 years with an hourly rate of $375,
who was the lead attorney and billed 79.4 hours representing Plaintiff in the
BBB Auto Line arbitration, handling discovery, investigating Plaintiffs’
claims, and representing Plaintiffs at case management conferences;
-     
Adrian
Flansburg, a paralegal with 25 years’ experience with an hourly rate of $210,
who billed 6.1 hours on tasks mostly related to the vehicle repurchase; and
-     
Melissa
Lopez, a paralegal with 3 years’ experience with an hourly rate of $175, who
billed 8.5 hours mostly on tasks related to discovery. 
(Kaufman Decl., ¶ 14.) Plaintiffs’
counsel provide evidence that their rates have been previously approved in
other cases in the Los Angeles Superior Court. (Kaufman Decl., ¶ 9; Sanjur-Van
Brande Decl., ¶ 9.) “[R]ate determinations in other cases, particularly those
setting a rate for the plaintiffs' attorney, are satisfactory evidence of the
prevailing market rate.” (Heritage Pacific Financial, LLC v. Monroy
(2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 972, 1009.)  
Defendants argue that Plaintiffs’
counsel’s hourly rates are excessive and argue that their declarations are self-serving.
Defendants instead suggest that the Court should base its award on an hourly
rate of $500 for Mr. Kaufman and $325 for Mr. Lynn and Ms. Sanjur Van-Brande.
Defendants’ sole authority for this is Mikhaeilpoor v. BMW of N. Am., LLC
(2020) 48 Cal.App.5th 240, 256, in which the trial court set a reasonable
hourly rate of $350. However, the Mikehaeilpoor court set this hourly
rate after considering that similar or more experienced attorneys had been
awarded billable rates of $345 and $350. (Ibid.) Also, the attorney in Mikhaeilpoor
had only been practicing for approximately five years and had litigated
hundreds of automotive defect cases involving the Song-Beverly Act. (Ibid.)
Here, in contrast, Plaintiffs’ counsel also declare that other plaintiffs-side
lemon law attorneys with over 20 years of experience have hourly rates ranging
from $595 to $850, which supports the finding that the requested rates are
reasonable. 
As for whether the hours expended by
Plaintiffs’ counsel is reasonable, Defendant first identifies blockbilled
entries which it claims should be discounted. (Opp., pp. 10-14.) The Court has
reviewed the described tasks and amount of time expended and does not find that
they are excessive or unreasonable. Second, Defendant challenges the amount of
time Plaintiffs’ counsel expended on drafting Plaintiffs’ responses to initial
written discovery and preparing documents for production. The Court rejects
this contention. Defendant served approximately 133 discovery requests on each
plaintiff, whereas Ms. Sanjur-Can Brande only billed 22.2 hours to respond to
all 266 requests, which amounts to approximately 6 minutes per request. This is
a reasonable amount of time to respond to discovery requests even if such
responses are boilerplate and the matter is uncomplicated. 
Defendant further contends the costs anticipated
for the reply brief in support of this fee motion are not allowed. Plaintiffs’
counsel estimated that it would spend 3 hours and $1,325 in fees to respond to Defendant’s
opposition and prepare for and attend the hearing. Given the length of
Defendants’ opposition brief and the number of arguments raised, this amount of
time is reasonable. 
Last, the Court addresses whether a
lodestar multiplier is appropriate. Plaintiffs argue that this case required
extensive effort due to Defendant’s misconduct in refusing to repurchase
Plaintiffs’ vehicle in accordance with the arbitration award. Plaintiffs also
emphasize that this case was taken on contingency and argue that a multiplier
would properly account for counsel’s opportunity costs, the delay in payment,
and the contingent risk. However, Plaintiffs do not show how the facts of the
case present any unusual legal challenge. Defendant’s conduct may have added a
considerable amount of frustration to the process but addressing this did not
require any particularly advanced amount of skill, especially when Plaintiffs
consistently refer to the binding nature of the BBB Auto Line arbitration award
and their statutory entitlement to registration fees. Accordingly, no lodestar
multiplier will be applied. 
Plaintiffs seek costs in the amount of
$777.84 pursuant to the memorandum of costs. This is not challenged and the
Court awards Plaintiffs’ the entire amount of the requested costs.
V.         
CONCLUSION
In conclusion, the Court awards fees in
the amount of $41,649.50 and costs in the amount of $777.84 for a total of $42,427.34.
