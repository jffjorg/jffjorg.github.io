Summary:

The judge's tentative ruling denies Defendant's special motion to strike Plaintiff's Complaint as a whole, but grants the motion as it pertains to Plaintiff's 4th cause of action for civil extortion and portions of the 5th cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress. The judge finds that Defendant's actions were protected by the anti-SLAPP statute and that Plaintiff failed to demonstrate a probability of prevailing on his claims for civil extortion and intentional infliction of emotional distress as they relate to the threat of prosecution as leverage to extort money from Plaintiff.
