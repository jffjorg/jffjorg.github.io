And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling addresses Verizon's motion to compel further responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One, Nos. 10, 13, 16, 19, 25, and 31, and for monetary sanctions of $3,100. The court has reviewed the parties' disputes and has determined that Verizon has the better of the argument in the dispute over Special Interrogatory No. 31, which asks the Church to provide information regarding rainstorms that led to water accumulation and/or penetration and leakage at the Property. The court orders the Church to respond to this interrogatory within 30 days. As for Verizon's request for monetary sanctions, the court finds that the Church's objection to this interrogatory was substantially justified, but not the Church's initial objections to the other Special Interrogatories. Therefore, Verizon is entitled to attorney's fees it incurred with respect to each of the Special Interrogatories other than No. 31, in the amount of $2,580.
