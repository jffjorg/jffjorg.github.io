  - "A party to a civil action who is over 70 years of age may petition the court for a preference, which the court shall grant if the court makes both of the following findings..." (CCP Section 36(a))
  - "The trial court has no power to balance the differing interests of opposing litigants in applying [CCP ยง 36]. The express legislative mandate for trial preference is a substantive public policy concern which supersedes such considerations." (Swaithes v. Superior Court)
```

And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court grants the plaintiff's motion for a trial preference due to the plaintiff's advanced age (73 years old) and compromised health. The plaintiff seeks a preferential trial date to prevent prejudicing her interest in the litigation. The court finds that the plaintiff meets the requirements of CCP Section 36(a) and grants the motion. The court sets the trial date for December 10, 2024, with a final status conference on December 3, 2024. The court also grants Defendant Martin's request for shortened notice for the deposition and examination, and orders the plaintiff to appear, testify, and produce documents at deposition on a date in June 2024.
