  Case Number:  23SMCV01349    Hearing Date:   June 10, 2024    Dept:  205 HEARING DATE:  June 10, 2024 JUDGE/DEPT:  Moreton/Beverly Hills, 205 CASE NAME: Novian & Novian LLP v. Raphael Berry, et al.  CASE NUMBER:  23SMCV01349  COMP. FILED:  March 28, 2023    PROCEEDINGS:  REQUEST FOR ENTRY OF DEFAULT JUDGMENT MOVING PARTY:  Novian & Novian LLP RESPONDING PARTY: Rapheal Berry, Samir Berry, Berri’s Pizza Cafe LLC, RHB Group LLC      and Morisani Enterprises BACKGROUND This case arises from an attorney-client dispute over fees.  Plaintiff Novian & Novian LLP entered into a series of hourly-based, written retainer agreements (“Retainers”) with Defendant Raphael Berry (“Raphael”).  Defendants Raphael and Samir Berry are the managing members of Defendants Berri’s Pizza Cafe, LLC, RHB Group LLC and Morisani Enterprises (collectively the “Entity Defendants”).   Under the Retainers, Raphael agreed to pay Plaintiff’s prevailing hourly rates and to advance and/or pay all necessary costs and expenses incident to the representation of Defendants.  Plaintiff alleges the Entity Defendants are bound by the Retainers because they are the alter egos of Raphael.   Plaintiff represented Defendants in various legal matters, including (1) a class action lawsuit against Defendants filed in the Los Angeles Superior Court, Perez v. Berri’s Pizza Westwood, Inc., et al., Case No. 19STCV05944 (“First Matter), (2) an action brought by the office of the State Labor Commissioner against Defendants, Vasquez v. Berri’s Kitchen Hollywood LLC, Case No.: WC-CM-760405 (the “Second Matter”), and (3) a case styled Rosendo v. Berri’s Pizza Cafe LLC, Case No. 20STCV22597 (the “Third Matter”).      On March 28, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Complaint against Defendants.  The Complaint alleges five claims for (1) breach of written contract, (2) common count for goods and services rendered, (3) account stated, (4) quantum meruit and (5) unjust enrichment.   The Complaint seeks (1) $179,033.90 in monetary damages (comprising of $113,260.25 for the First Matter, $1,135 for the Second Matter, $64,596.15 for the Third Matter, and $42.50 for general business representation), (2) prejudgment interest at the rate of 10% per annum from the date of breach, (3) attorneys’ fees, and (4) costs.   Plaintiff filed proofs of service showing RHB Group LLC, Morisani Enterprises and Berri’s Pizza Cafe LLC were served by substitute service on April 10, 2023; Raphael Berry was served by substitute service on April 12, 2023, and Sami Berry was served personally on April 12, 2023.  Defendants were obligated to respond within 30 days. Defendants did not do so. Plaintiff successfully requested the entry of Defendants’ default, which was entered by the Clerk’s Office on June 13, 2023, July 27, 2023 and October 18, 2023.  Plaintiff requested a default judgment on March 6, 2024.  Plaintiff served Defendants by mail with both the Request for Entry of Default and Request for Default Judgment.  Defendants have not appeared.  RELIEF REQUESTED  Default judgment against Defendants for a total of $196,067.01, which is comprised of: (1) $179,039.05 in damages, (2) $12,213.45 in interest, (3) $3,732.39 in attorneys’ fees, and (4) $1,082.12 for costs.   ANALYSIS  Code Civ. Proc. § 585 sets forth the two options for obtaining a default judgment. First, where the plaintiff’s complaint¿seeks compensatory damages only, in a sum certain which is readily ascertainable from the allegations of the complaint or statement of damages, the clerk may enter the default judgment for that amount. However, if the relief requested in the complaint is more complicated, consisting of either nonmonetary relief, or monetary relief in amounts which require either an accounting, additional evidence, or the exercise of judgment to ascertain, the plaintiff must request entry of judgment by the court. In such cases, the plaintiff must affirmatively establish his entitlement to the specific judgment requested.¿ (Kim v. Westmoore Partners, Inc. (2011) 201 Cal.App.4th 267, 287.) Section 585 also allows for interest, costs and attorney fees, where otherwise allowed by law. (Code of Civ. Proc. § 585(a).)  Multiple specific documents are required, such as: (1) form CIV 100, (2) a brief summary of the case; (3) declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested; (4) interest computations as necessary; (5) a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (6) a proposed form of judgment; (7) a dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application for separate judgment under Code Civ. Proc. § 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; (8) exhibits as necessary; and (9) a request for attorneys’ fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.  (CRC Rule 3.1800.)  Here, Plaintiff is seeking damages in excess of that stated in the Complaint.  Plaintiff seeks $179,039.05 in damages while the Complaint seeks damages of $179,033.90.  The Court will only award damages stated in the Complaint as doing otherwise would render the judgment void.  (Burtnett v. King (1949) 33 Cal.2d 805, 808 (the court lacks jurisdiction to award damages in excess of the demand in the Complaint).)   Otherwise, the Court concludes Plaintiff has met the substantive and procedural requirements for seeking a default judgment.  Substantively, Plaintiff provides a declaration calculating the amount of damages sought.  (Novian Decl. ¶¶ 28-30.)  Plaintiff also provides via declaration a calculation of the interest sought of $12,213.45.  (Id.)  A memorandum of costs in the amount of $1,082.12 is set forth in Item 7 of the CIV-100 form.  Plaintiff states a contractual basis for the attorneys’ fees it seeks (i.e., the Retainers allow for the recovery of attorneys’ fees to the prevailing party) and provides a calculation for such fees.  (Id. ¶ 32.)  Procedurally, Plaintiff properly served Defendants more than 30 days prior to requesting entry of default and default judgment, correctly completed JC Form CIV-100 in a manner that would not void or put at issue the entry of default, provided a declaration of non-military status, requested dismissal of the fictitious defendants, and filed a proposed judgment (JUD-100).   As default has already been entered and there has been no appearance or filing whatsoever from Defendants, default judgment is appropriate here.   CONCLUSION AND ORDER   For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff Novian & Novian, LLP’s Request for Default Judgment is GRANTED as to Defendants Raphael Berry, Samir Berry, Berri’s Pizza Cafe LLC, RHB Group, LLC and Morisani Enterprises.  Default judgment in the amount of $196,061.86 is awarded in favor of Plaintiff.
