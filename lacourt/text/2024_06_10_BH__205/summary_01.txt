And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the plaintiff's motion for leave to amend the complaint to name Joshua Gershovich as a defendant. The court finds that the proposed amendment is time-barred, and the relation-back doctrine does not apply. The court notes that the identity of Joshua Gershovich as the driver of the car was disclosed to the plaintiff in writing at least twice before the statute of limitations expired, and the plaintiff failed to take action to amend the complaint within the statutory time period.
