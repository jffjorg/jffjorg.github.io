And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Shanna X. Chen, has filed a motion to strike certain portions of the complaint filed by the plaintiffs, Houshang Rezvan Behbahani and Mina Sadighi. The motion seeks to strike the introduction of the complaint, as well as certain paragraphs and phrases that the defendant claims are irrelevant, improper, or lacking in specificity.

The court has reviewed the complaint and the motion to strike, and has found that the introduction of the complaint is improper argument. However, the court has also found that the remaining allegations sought to be stricken in relation to the plaintiffs' claim for punitive damages are sufficiently supported by the totality of the facts alleged in the complaint.

The court has granted the motion to strike certain portions of the complaint without leave to amend, but has denied the motion to strike the remaining allegations. The answer is due within 20 days.
