SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of Plaintiffs Houshang Rezvan
Behbahani and Mina Sadighi’s (Plaintiffs) claim that Defendant Shanna X. Chen,
individually and as Trustee of the Chen Family Trust (Defendant) trespassed
onto Plaintiffs’ property and cut, or had cut, several mature trees without
Plaintiffs’ permission.  On 4/18/23,
Plaintiffs filed this action against Defendant for: (1) Trespass, (2) Negligence
and (3) Intentional Cutting, Damaging and Trespass to Timber.  Plaintiffs’ complaint includes claims for
statutory treble damages; alternatively, statutory double damages; or
alternatively, punitive damages; injunctive relief and attorney fees.  (See Complaint, p.6:21-p.7:8).  
 
After meet and confer efforts failed to resolve issues
Defendant had with the complaint, on 6/28/23, Defendant filed and served the
instant motion seeking an order striking the following portions of Plaintiffs’
complaint:  
 
(1) Page 1 Line 25 to Page 2
Line 16: The entire INTRODUCTION as being irrelevant and improper; 
(2) Page 3 Line 14 the word
“unlawfully” as being improper and irrelevant as a legal conclusion; 
(3) Page 3 Lines 18-24: The
entire paragraph as being improperly plead, ambiguous and lacking in
specificity as to the facts plead; 
(4) Page 4 Line 27 to Page 5
Line 3 The entire paragraph as being improperly plead, ambiguous and lacking in
specificity as to the facts plead necessary to warrant the imposition of
punitive damages; 
(5) Page 7 Lines 4-5 of the
Prayer: “4. For a preliminary and permanent injunction requiring Defendants to
cease any future trespass on to the Property” – a request for injunctive relief
in this matter is not supported by the allegations in the Complaint; and 
(6) Page 7 Line 8 of the Prayer:
“6. For attorney fees and costs of suit.”
 
Plaintiffs have opposed the motion and Defendant has
filed a reply to the opposition.  
 
ANALYSIS
 
CCP 436 provides: 
 
“The court may, upon a motion made
pursuant to Section 435, or at any time in its discretion, and upon terms it
deems proper: 
(a) Strike out any irrelevant,
false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading. 
(b) Strike out all or any part of
any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a
court rule, or an order of the court.”
 
Punitive damages may only be awarded in cases involving
fraud, oppression or malice.  Civil Code
3294.  A claim for punitive damages must
be supported by specific factual allegations. 
Hilliard (1983) 148 CA3d 374, 391-392.
 
Defendant contends that Plaintiffs have failed to plead
sufficient facts to support the imposition of punitive damages against
Defendant in this case.  As such,
Defendant seeks to strike the introductory paragraphs of the complaint
(p.1:25-p.2:16), the word “unlawfully” including in paragraph 11 of the
“Factual Allegations” in the complaint, (p.3:14), allegations that Defendant
acted outrageously by intentionally and knowingly entering Plaintiffs’ property
without permission and cutting down trees to improve the access to sun for
Defendant’s solar panels (p.3:18-24), and allegations
regarding punitive damages in the trespass cause of action (p.4:27-p.5:3).  Defendant does not include the prayer for
punitive damages contained paragraph 3 of the prayer at p.7:1-3 in the items to
be stricken.
 
The Court finds that the allegations in the
“Introduction” of the complaint are improper argument.  Similarly, the Court finds that the word
unlawfully is an improper legal conclusion. 
However, the Court finds that the remaining allegations sought to be
stricken in relation to Plaintiffs’ claim for punitive damages  are sufficiently supported by the totality of
the facts alleged in the complaint.  
 
In order to obtain injunctive relief, a plaintiff must
establish: (1) a tort or other wrongful act constituting a cause of action and
(2) irreparable injury.  Brownfield
(1989) 208 CA3d 405, 410.  Plaintiffs
have alleged sufficient facts to constitute the tort/wrongful act of trespass
and cutting of trees without permission. 
Plaintiffs have also alleged sufficient facts to establish irreparable
injury from the conduct of cutting mature trees which took decades to grow that
cannot be compensated by an ordinary award – i.e., to prevent Defendant from
entering Plaintiffs’ property in the future without permission for similar
purposes.  As such, the Court finds that
Plaintiffs’ prayer for injunctive relief is sufficiently supported.
 
Generally, attorney’s fees may only be awarded when
authorized by a contract, statute or law. 
CCP 1033.5(a)(10).  Plaintiffs
fail to allege any basis for their claim for attorney’s fees in the
complaint.  The opposition to the motion
cites to Government Code 53067(a)(4).  (See
Opposition, p.8:13-26).  However, nothing
in this Government Code section provides authority for an award of attorneys’
fees under the circumstances.
  
CONCLUSION
 
Based on the foregoing, Defendant’s requests to strike
p.1:25-p.2:16, the word “unlawfully” at p.3:14 and the prayer for “attorney
fees” at p.7:8 (the prayer for costs of suit is not stricken) are granted
without leave to amend.
 
Defendant’s requests to strike the remaining allegations,
p.3:18-24 and p.4:27-p.5:3, relating to punitive damages and the prayer for
injunctive relief, p.7:4-5, are denied.
 
Answer is due within 20 days.
