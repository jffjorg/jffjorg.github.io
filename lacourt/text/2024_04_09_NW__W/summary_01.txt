English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer to the second amended complaint. The court has sustained the demurrer with leave to amend in part. The court has given the plaintiff one more opportunity to sufficiently plead a breach of contract claim against the defendants. The court has also sustained the demurrer with leave to amend in part with regards to the second cause of action for conversion of stolen property. The court has sustained the demurrer without leave to amend with regards to the third cause of action for malicious sabotage as it is unclear what the cause of action is that is alleged against the defendants. The court has sustained the demurrer without leave to amend with regards to the fourth cause of action for fraud on the court as it is not a cognizable cause of action. The court has given the plaintiff one more opportunity to sufficiently plead an interference with prospective economic advantage claim against the defendants.
