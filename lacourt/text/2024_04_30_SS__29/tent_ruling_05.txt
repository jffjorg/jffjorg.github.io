 Case Number:  22STCV06939    Hearing Date:   April 30, 2024    Dept:  29 Motion to be
Relieved as Counsel, filed by Plaintiff’s Counsel Edward M. Morgan. 
Tentative
The hearing on the motion is
continued so that moving counsel may file a complete and updated proposed
order.
Background
On February 25, 2022, Talbot Louis Wells
(“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against PIH Health Downey Hospital, Juan Jose
Macias Barreto and Does 1 to 100 for (1) assault, (2) battery, (3) infliction
of emotional distress, (4) negligence, and (5) negligent hiring, supervision,
and retention causes of action arising from a physical altercation occurring on
March 15, 2020.
On March 28, 2024, Edward
M. Morgan of Downtown L.A. Law Group (“Counsel”) filed this motion to be
relieved as counsel. No opposition has been filed. 
Legal
Standard
The court may order that an attorney be changed or
substituted at any time before or after judgment or final determination upon
request by either client or attorney and after notice from one to the other.
(Code of Civ. Proc., § 284(b).) An attorney is permitted to withdraw where
conflicts between the attorney and client make it unreasonable to continue the
representation. (See Cal. Rules of Prof. Conduct 3-700(C)(1).) “The
determination whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel lies
within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi & Levine v.
Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1133.)   
 
An application to be relieved as counsel must be made on
Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion) (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.136(c)), and MC-053 (Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362(e)).   
 
Further, the requisite forms must be served on the client
and all other parties who have appeared in the case. (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1362(d).) The court may delay effective date of the order relieving
counsel until proof of service of a copy of the signed order on the client has
been filed with the court. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).) 
 
Discussion
 
Counsel has
filed the Notice, Declaration and Order to be Relieved as Counsel. Service has
been made on all parties in this action. Counsel contends there has been a
breakdown of the attorney-client relationship. Counsel confirmed Plaintiff’s
address by telephone.  Counsel has shown
a sufficient substantive basis for an order to be relieved.  
 
Procedurally,
however, there is an issue with the moving papers.  The proposed order (Form MC-053) is not
completed correctly.  Item 8 is
blank.  It should include all future hearings
and other dates.  Moreover, subsequent to
the filing of the motion, the Court granted an order, on the stipulation of the
parties, to continue trial and other dates.
 
Accordingly, the
hearing is continued so that moving counsel may file a new proposed order that lists
all future dates (in item 8) and updates the trial date (in item 9).
 
Conclusion
The Court
CONTINUES the hearing on counsel’s motion to be relieved.
Moving counsel
to give notice.
