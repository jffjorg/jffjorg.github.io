significant_statements:
  - "The purpose of the law of summary judgment is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut through the parties' pleadings in order to determine whether, despite their allegations, trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute."
  - "A plaintiff must establish the following elements: (1) the duty of the professional to use such skill, prudence, and diligence as other members of the profession commonly possess and exercise; (2) a breach of that duty; (3) a proximate causal connection between the negligent conduct and the resulting injury; and (4) actual loss or damage resulting from the professional's negligence."
```

Summary: The court has denied the defendant's motion for summary judgment, finding that there are triable issues of material fact as to whether the defendant complied with the standard of care in treating the plaintiff. The court found that the plaintiff presented sufficient evidence to show that there are genuine issues of material fact as to breach and causation.
