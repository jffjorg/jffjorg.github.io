```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants Defendant Mildred Johanna Fuentes' motion to compel compliance with Defendant's request for production of documents. Defendant had served Plaintiff Emmanuel Anyaogu with a request for production of documents, and Plaintiff had promised to produce responsive documents. However, Plaintiff failed to produce the documents as promised. The judge orders Plaintiff to produce all documents in his possession, custody, or control responsive to the requests within 21 days.

The judge also denies Defendant's request for sanctions. The judge finds that the circumstances do not justify the imposition of sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure sections 2031.320, 2023.010, and 2023.030.
