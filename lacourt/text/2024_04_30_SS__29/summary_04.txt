The tentative ruling denies the plaintiff's motion to serve the defendant by publication or posting. The plaintiff filed the complaint on February 22, 2022, and has been attempting to serve the defendant to no avail. The plaintiff has attempted to serve the defendant at his previous address in Santa Monica, through registered UPS Mail Delivery, and at his mother's address in Las Vegas. However, the plaintiff has not shown sufficient evidence of reasonable diligence in attempting to serve the defendant. Additionally, the plaintiff has not shown a sufficient basis for service by publication or posting. The court notes that service by publication is a last resort and that the plaintiff must establish reasonable diligence in attempting to serve the defendant.
