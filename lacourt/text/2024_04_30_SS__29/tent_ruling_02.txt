Tentative
The motion is granted.
The request for sanctions is denied.
Background
This case arises out of a vehicle accident that allegedly
occurred on May 14, 2019, near the intersection of Prairie Street and 118th
Street in Hawthorne, California. 
Plaintiff Emmanuel Anyaogu (“Plaintiff”) alleges that the accident was
caused by the negligence of Defendant Mildred Johanna Fuentes (“Defendant”),
and that he sustained injuries as a result. 

Plaintiff filed a Complaint on May 11, 2021, asserting one
cause of action for motor vehicle negligence against Defendant and Does 1
through 10.  Defendant filed her answer
on May 12, 2022.
As
is relevant to this motion, on May 11, 2022, Defendant served Plaintiff with
Requests for Production of Documents (Set One). (Garibyan Decl., ¶ 3 & Exh.
A.) Plaintiff served a verified written response stating that he would produce
all responsive documents in his possession, custody, and control in response to
Requests Nos. 1, 2, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 15. (Id., ¶ 4 & Exh. B.)  Plaintiff has not, however, produced any
responsive documents.  (Id., ¶ 6.)
 
On May
26, 2023, Defendant filed this motion to compel compliance.  Defendant also seeks sanctions.
 
No opposition
has been filed.
 
Legal Standard
“If a party filing a response to a demand for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling … thereafter fails to permit the inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling in accordance with that party’s statement of
compliance, the demanding party may move for an order compelling
compliance.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.320, subd. (a).)  
“[T]he court shall
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)
against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a
motion to compel compliance with a demand, unless it finds that the one subject
to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.320, subd. (b).)
In Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery Act, Code of Civil
Procedure section 2030.030 provides that the court may impose sanctions “[t]o
the extent authorized by the chapter governing any particular discovery method
or any other provision of this title.”  Code
of Civil Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision (d), defines “[m]isuses of the
discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to respond to or to submit to an
authorized method of discovery.”  Where a
party or attorney has engaged in misuse of the discovery process, the court may
impose a monetary sanction in the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including
attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.020, subd.
(a).)
Discussion
On or about April 12,
2023, Plaintiff served a verified written response to Requests
for Production (Set One) stating that he would produce all responsive documents
in his possession, custody, and control in response to Requests Nos. 1, 2, 10,
11, 12, 13, and 15. (Garibyan Decl., ¶ 4 & Exh. B.)  Plaintiff has not, however, produced responsive
documents as promised.  (Id., ¶ 6.)
 
Defendant need not show anything more.  The request for an order compelling Plaintiff
to comply with his statement of compliance is granted.
 
Defendant’s request for sanctions is denied.
 
Defendants seek sanctions under Code of Civil
Procedure sections 2031.320, 2023.010, and 2023.030.  Section 2031.320, subdivision (b), authorizes
an award of sanctions only against a party or attorney “who unsuccessfully
makes or opposes” a motion to compel compliance; here, no opposition was
filed.  And sections 2023.010 and
2023.030 “do not independently
authorize the trial court to impose monetary sanctions for misuse of
discovery.”  (City of Los Angeles v. PricewaterhouseCoopers,
LLC (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 466, 504.)  (The Court is aware
that the California Supreme Court has granted review of the City of Los Angeles
case, but the Court notes that the order granting review, filed on January 25,
2023, states that pending review, the appellate opinion “may be cited,”
including “for its persuasive value.”  The Court finds the reasoning
of Justice Moor in the City of Los Angeles case to be persuasive.)
Conclusion
 
The Court GRANTS Defendant’s motion to compel
compliance.
 
The Court ORDERS Plaintiff to produce all documents
within his possession, custody, or control responsive to Document Requests Nos.
1, 2,
10, 11, 12, 13, and 15 within 21 days
of notice.
 
The Court DENIES Defendant’s request for
sanctions.  
 
Moving party is ordered to give notice.
