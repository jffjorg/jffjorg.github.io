And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of 22STCV06939, regarding a motion to be relieved as counsel by Plaintiff's Counsel, Edward M. Morgan. The motion was filed on March 28, 2024, without opposition. The court has determined that the attorney-client relationship has broken down, and Counsel seeks to be relieved. However, the proposed order submitted by Counsel is incomplete and does not include all future hearing dates. Therefore, the hearing on the motion is continued to allow Counsel to file an updated proposed order that includes all future dates and updates the trial date. The court will continue to consider the motion at a later date.
