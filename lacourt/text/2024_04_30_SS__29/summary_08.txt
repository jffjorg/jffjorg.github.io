Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding a motion by Lyft, Inc. to conduct an additional physical examination of plaintiff Eric Jason Austin. The motion was denied without prejudice due to procedural reasons. The judge found that Lyft failed to satisfy the mandatory requirements for a motion to obtain discovery through an additional physical examination. Specifically, the motion did not specify the time of the examination, as required by California Code of Civil Procedure section 2032.310, subdivision (b). The judge noted that Lyft had previously prepared a notice with a specific date and time for an examination, but chose not to comply with the code requirements in this case. As a result, the judge denied the motion without reaching the issue of whether good cause had been shown for the additional physical examination. The denial is without prejudice, meaning that the motion can be refiled if the necessary requirements are met.
