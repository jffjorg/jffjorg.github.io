Legal
Standard
 
“The purpose of the law of summary judgment
is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut through the parties’ pleadings in
order to determine whether, despite their allegations, trial is in fact
necessary to resolve their dispute.” (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co.
(2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) Code of Civil Procedure section 437c, subdivision
(c), “requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment if all the evidence
submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence’ and
uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that there is no triable
issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment
as a matter of law.” (Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7
Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.) “The function of the pleadings in a motion for summary
judgment is to delimit the scope of the issues; the function of the affidavits
or declarations is to disclose whether there is any triable issue of fact
within the issues delimited by the pleadings.” (Juge v. County of Sacramento
(1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 59, 67, citing FPI Development, Inc. v. Nakashima
(1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 367, 381-382.)
As to each cause of action as framed by the
complaint, a defendant moving for summary judgment or summary adjudication must
satisfy the initial burden of proof by presenting facts to show “that one or
more elements of the cause of action ... cannot be established, or that there
is a complete defense to the cause of action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd.
(p)(2); see also Aguilar, supra, 25 Cal.4th at pp. 850-851; Scalf
v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1520.) Once the
defendant has met that burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that
a “triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to the cause of action
or a defense thereto.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2); see also Aguilar,
supra, 25 Cal.4th at pp. 850-851.)
A plaintiff or cross-complainant moving for
summary judgment or summary adjudication must satisfy the initial burden of
proof by presenting facts to show “that there is no defense to a cause of
action if that party has proved each element of the cause of action entitling
the party to judgment on the cause of action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd.
(p)(1).) Once the plaintiff or cross-complainant has met that burden, the
burden shift to the defendant or cross-defendant to show that a “triable issue
of one or more material facts exists as to the cause of action or a defense
thereto.” (Ibid.)
The party opposing a motion for summary
judgment or summary adjudication may not simply “rely upon the allegations or
denials of its pleadings” but must instead “set forth the specific facts
showing that a triable issue of material fact exists.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
437c, subds. (p)(1) & (p)(2). To establish a triable issue of material
fact, the party opposing the motion must produce substantial responsive
evidence. (Sangster v. Paetkau (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 151, 166.)
Courts “liberally construe the evidence in
support of the party opposing summary judgment and resolve doubts concerning
the evidence in favor of that party.” (Dore v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc.
(2006) 39 Cal.4th 384, 389.)
 
Evidentiary Objections
 
Plaintiff makes 12 objections to Defendant’s evidence. Evidence
presented in support of, or in opposition to, a motion for summary judgment
must be admissible. (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (d); Perry v. Bakewell
Hawthorne LLC (2017) 2 Cal.5th 536, 541-43.) The court must “consider all of
the evidence set forth in the papers, except the evidence to which objections
have been made and sustained.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (c).)
 
The Court OVERRULES objections 2-3, 5-12. The Court SUSTAINS objection 1
as to improper authentication. The Court SUSTAINS objection 4 as to relevance.
 
Discussion
 
In the complaint,
Plaintiff asserts one cause of action for professional negligence against Defendant.
Specifically, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant failed to conduct the necessary
tests to determine if there was a foreign substance in Plaintiff’s hand before placing
sutures on the wound. (Complaint, ¶ 20.) 
 
In a
medical negligence action, a plaintiff must establish the following elements:
“(1) the duty of the professional to use such
skill, prudence, and diligence as other members of [the] profession commonly
possess and exercise; (2) a breach of that duty; (3) a proximate causal
connection between the negligent conduct and the resulting injury; and (4)
actual loss or damage resulting from the professional’s negligence.” (Galvez
v. Frields (2001) 88 Cal.App.4tha 1410, 1420; Simmons v. West Covina
Medical Clinic (1989) 212 Cal.App.3d 696, 701-02.)  “Both the standard of care and defendants’ breach must normally be
established by expert testimony in a medical malpractice case.” (Avivi v.
Centro Medico Urgente Medical Center (2008), 159 Cal.App.4th 463, 467.) 
A medical
professional breaches the duty of professional care by failing to act in
accordance with the prevailing industry standard of care. (See Folk v. Kilk
(1975) 53 Cal.App.3d 176, 186.) “The standard of care
against which the acts of a physician are to be measured is a matter peculiarly
within the knowledge of experts; it presents the basic issue in a malpractice
action and can only be proved by their testimony …, unless the conduct required
by the particular circumstances is within the common knowledge of the layman.’”
(Landeros v. Flood (1976) 17 Cal.3d 399, 410.) 
A defendant
moving for summary judgment in a medical malpractice action must “present
evidence that would preclude a reasonable trier of fact from finding that it
was more likely than not that their treatment fell below the standard of care.”
(Johnson v. Super. Ct. (2006) 143 Cal.App.4th 297, 305.) “When a
defendant moves for summary judgment and supports [the] motion with expert
declarations that [their] conduct fell within the community standard of care, [the
defendant] is entitled to summary judgment unless the plaintiff comes forward
with conflicting expert evidence.”¿¿(Munro v. Regents of University of
California¿(1989) 215 Cal.App.3d 977, 984-985.)¿ An expert declaration, if
uncontradicted, is conclusive proof as to the prevailing standard of care and
the propriety of the particular conduct of the health care provider.¿¿(Starr
v.¿Mooslin¿(1971) 14 Cal.App.3d 988, 999.)¿
Here, Defendant contends that he complied with the applicable standard of
care in the treatment of Plaintiff and did not cause or contribute to
Plaintiff’s injuries. In support of his motion, he offers the expert
declaration of Robert T. Goldweber, M.D.
 
Dr. Goldweber is board-certified in emergency medicine, has been the
Associate Director of the Department of Emergency Medicine at Huntington
Memorial Hospital since 1987, and served as a clinical professor in the
Department of Emergency Medicine at USC from 1985 to 2018. (Goldweber Decl., ¶ 2.)
In forming his opinion in this matter, Dr. Goldweber reviewed Plaintiff’s
medical records and Plaintiff’s interrogatory responses. (Id., ¶ 5.) 
 
Dr. Goldweber states that, based on his education, training, and
experience, he is familiar with the standard of care for patients similar to
Plaintiff. (Id., ¶ 4.) Dr. Goldweber opines that, based on his review of
Plaintiff’s medical record, Defendant Gill complied with the standard of care
and treatment of Plaintiff. (Id., ¶ 8.) Specifically, Dr. Goldweber
opines that Gill noted no foreign body was detected after irrigation. (Id.,
¶ 9.) Further, there was no evidence of any foreign body. (Ibid.)
Lastly, Dr. Goldweber opines that no negligent act or omission by Gill caused
or significantly contributed to Plaintiff’s injury. (Id., ¶ 10.) 
 
This is “evidence which, if
uncontradicted, would constitute a preponderance of evidence that an essential
element of the plaintiff’s case cannot be established.” (Kids’ Universe v.
In2Labs (2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 870, 879.) The expert opinion testimony of
Dr. Goldweber is evidence that Defendant Gill complied with applicable standard
of care and did not cause any injury to Plaintiff.
 
With this evidence, Defendant Gill
has satisfied the initial burden of showing that one or more elements of the
causes of action in the complaint cannot be established. (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2).)
This shifts the burden to Plaintiff to show that there is a triable issue of
one or more material facts as to the causes of action. (Ibid.)
 
In opposition, Plaintiff offers the expert declaration of Michael Ritter,
M.D. Dr. Ritter is board certified in Emergency Medicine, a Fellow of the
American College of Emergency Physicians, a Fellow of the American Academy of
Emergency Medicine, the former Associate Medical Director (1999-2012) and Medical
Director (2012-2018) of the Emergency Department of Mission Hospital and
Children’s Hospital at Mission, and a clinical professor in the Department of
Emergency Medicine at UC Irvine (1998 to present). (Ritter Decl., ¶ 4 &
Exh. A.) Dr. Ritter states he is familiar with the standard of care for
emergency physicians in similar circumstances to this case in the same or
similar location. (Id., ¶ 8.) Dr. Ritter bases his opinion on his review
of Plaintiff’s medical records, Defendant’s motion for summary judgment and
supporting documents, Plaintiff’s discovery responses, photographs of
Plaintiff’s left hand with the foreign objection, and a video of the
Plaintiff’s left hand with Plaintiff’s supporting declaration. (Id., ¶ 11.)

 
Dr. Ritter opines that based on his review of these records, as well as
his education, training, and experience, it is his opinion that Defendant Gill did
not comply with the applicable standard of care in treating Plaintiff. (Id.,
¶ 12.) Specifically, Dr. Ritter opines that Dr. Gill failed to take a proper
history of Plaintiff and failed to obtain x-rays of the hand before closing
Plaintiff’s wound. (Id., ¶ 15.) Dr. Ritter further opines that Dr.
Gill’s act or omission caused or contributed to Plaintiff’s injuries. (Id.,
¶¶ 16, 19.)
 
Plaintiff’s evidence, including but not limited
to the expert opinion testimony, is sufficient to show that there are triable
issues as to breach and causation. At the summary judgment stage, the Court
does not weigh the evidence.
Accordingly, the Court concludes that Plaintiff
has met her burden in establishing the existence of genuine issues of material
fact sufficient to defeat Defendant’s motion for summary judgment.
Conclusion
 
Defendant’s
motion for summary judgment is DENIED.
 
Moving party is to give notice.
