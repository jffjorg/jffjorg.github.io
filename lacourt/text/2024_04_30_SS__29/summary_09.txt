As for the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants Defendant's Motion to Continue Trial. The trial date is advanced and continued for approximately six months. The Final Status Conference and all deadlines are reset based on the new trial date. The court finds good cause for the continuance due to the need for additional discovery and the unavailability of defense counsel for the current trial date.
