And here is the English text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the defendants' unopposed motion for summary judgment. The defendants, Soha Idriss, M.D. and White Memorial Neonatal Medical Group, argue that they met the standard of care in their care and treatment of Matthew Ceballos, and that no act or omission by them caused or contributed to the plaintiff's injuries. They also argue that they did not treat plaintiff Michelle Rodriguez. The defendants present expert declarations from Philippe Friedlich, M.D., who opines that the defendants' care was timely, appropriate, and well within the standard of care. The defendants' expert also opines that the infant was delivered with no to minimal signs of life, and was successfully resuscitated by the timely efforts of the Code Blue NICU team. The defendants' expert further opines that there is no evidence to suggest that any improper or negligent act or omission by the defendants caused or contributed to the plaintiff's alleged injuries. The plaintiff has not filed an opposition to the motion, therefore, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show a triable issue of fact exists. Since the plaintiff has not provided any conflicting evidence by an expert, the defendants' motion for summary judgment is granted.

## English Summary:

The Judge has granted the motion for summary judgment filed by Dr. Soha Idriss and White Memorial Neonatal Medical Group (WMNMG). The Judge found that the evidence presented by Defendants showed that they met the standard of care in treating Matthew Ceballos, the infant plaintiff in this case. 

The Judge emphasized that expert testimony from Dr. Philippe Friedlich, who reviewed the case and found no negligence or breach of the standard of care by Dr. Idriss or WMNMG, supported this conclusion. 

Additionally, the Judge noted that Plaintiff Michelle Rodriguez, the mother of Matthew Ceballos, was not treated by Dr. Idriss or WMNMG, so there were no claims against them related to her care.

Since Plaintiffs did not offer any opposing evidence, the Judge decided in favor of Defendants, dismissing the case.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendants, Soha Idriss, M.D. and White Memorial Neonatal Medical Group, have moved for summary judgment on the grounds that they met the standard of care in their care and treatment of Matthew, that no act or omission by them caused or contributed to the alleged injuries, that they are immune from liability pursuant to Health & Safety Code Section 1317(f), and that they did not render care to the plaintiff, Michelle Rodriguez.

The court has reviewed the evidence presented and finds that the defendants have met their burden of proof by showing that their care and treatment of Matthew was well within and above the community standard of care. They have presented expert testimony from Dr. Philippe Friedlich, who opines that the defendants' care was timely, appropriate, and well within the standard of care.

The court finds that the plaintiff has not presented any conflicting evidence to challenge the defendants' claims, and therefore, the defendants' motion for summary judgment is granted. The court orders the moving party to give notice of this ruling.
