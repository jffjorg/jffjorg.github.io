And here is the English text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the defendants' unopposed motion for summary judgment. The defendants, Soha Idriss, M.D. and White Memorial Neonatal Medical Group, argue that they met the standard of care in their care and treatment of Matthew Ceballos, and that no act or omission by them caused or contributed to the plaintiff's injuries. They also argue that they did not treat plaintiff Michelle Rodriguez. The defendants present expert declarations from Philippe Friedlich, M.D., who opines that the defendants' care was timely, appropriate, and well within the standard of care. The defendants' expert also opines that the infant was delivered with no to minimal signs of life, and was successfully resuscitated by the timely efforts of the Code Blue NICU team. The defendants' expert further opines that there is no evidence to suggest that any improper or negligent act or omission by the defendants caused or contributed to the plaintiff's alleged injuries. The plaintiff has not filed an opposition to the motion, therefore, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show a triable issue of fact exists. Since the plaintiff has not provided any conflicting evidence by an expert, the defendants' motion for summary judgment is granted.
