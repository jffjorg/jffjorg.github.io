And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction. The purpose of a preliminary injunction is to preserve the status quo pending final resolution on a trial. The plaintiff must show a likelihood of prevailing on the merits of the case and that the harm they suffer outweighs the injury incurred by the defendant if an injunction is not granted. The plaintiff has failed to provide sufficient evidence to meet this burden, including a lack of discussion on the likelihood of success and the irreparable harm elements. Additionally, the plaintiff has not provided an undertaking for damages, which is required for a preliminary injunction to take effect. The judge has denied the motion based on the lack of evidence and the failure to meet the burden of proof.
