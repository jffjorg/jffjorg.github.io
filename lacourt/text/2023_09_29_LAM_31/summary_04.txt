And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction. The purpose of a preliminary injunction is to preserve the status quo pending final resolution on a trial. The plaintiff must show a likelihood of prevailing on the merits of the case and that the harm they suffer outweighs the injury incurred by the defendant if an injunction is not granted. The plaintiff has failed to provide sufficient evidence to meet this burden, including a lack of discussion on the likelihood of success and the irreparable harm elements. Additionally, the plaintiff has not provided an undertaking for damages, which is required for a preliminary injunction to take effect. The judge has denied the motion based on the lack of evidence and the failure to meet the burden of proof.

## English Summary:

The judge has denied the Plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction.  The judge found that the Plaintiff failed to provide enough evidence to show they are likely to win their case and that the harm they would suffer without the injunction outweighs the harm the Defendant would suffer if the injunction were granted.  

The Plaintiff argued that the Child Support Services Division (CSSD) violated their due process rights by not properly serving them with an income withholding order and providing notice of a hearing. However, the judge found that the Plaintiff did not provide sufficient evidence to support this claim. The judge also noted that the Plaintiff did not adequately discuss the required balancing of harm and the need for an undertaking.

Here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction. The plaintiff, Hinton, had sought to enjoin the Child Support Services Division (CSSD) from garnishing their wages, claiming that the CSSD had not properly served them with an income withholding order and had violated their due process rights. However, the judge found that the plaintiff had not met their burden of proof to show a likelihood of prevailing on the merits of their claims. The plaintiff had not provided sufficient evidence to support their claims, and their declaration was not enough to satisfy their burden. The judge also noted that the plaintiff had not discussed the balancing of harm between the parties, which is a required factor in determining whether to grant a preliminary injunction. Additionally, the plaintiff had not provided an undertaking, which is also required. Therefore, the judge denied the plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction.
