And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by the plaintiff to exclude the defendant's expert testimony from trial or, in the alternative, to compel the defendant's expert deposition. The motion was granted in part and denied in part. The judge found that the defendant's failure to produce its expert witness for deposition was not unreasonable and therefore denied the motion to exclude the expert's testimony from trial. However, the judge did find that the defendant's expert's deposition should be compelled and granted the motion to compel the deposition. The judge ordered the defendant's expert, James Oaks, to appear for deposition within 30 days of the order.
