## English Text Summary

The judge's tentative ruling is granting part of the Plaintiff's motion. 

The Plaintiff wanted to exclude the testimony of Defendant GM's expert witness, James Oaks, from trial because Defendant GM had not made him available for a deposition. The Plaintiff also wanted to compel Oaks' deposition. 

The judge found that Defendant GM's actions did not constitute "gamesmanship" and therefore, denied the motion to exclude Oaks' testimony. However, the judge found that the deposition should be compelled because Defendant GM had not provided a date for Oaks to be deposed despite Plaintiff's attempts to schedule it.

Therefore, the judge ordered Oaks to appear for a deposition within 30 days.
