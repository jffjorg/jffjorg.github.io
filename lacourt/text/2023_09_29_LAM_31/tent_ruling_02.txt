Legal Standard
 
Code of Civil Procedure section
2034.300 provides: 
 
Except as provided in Section 2034.310 and in Articles 4
(commencing with Section 2034.610) and 5 (commencing with Section 2034.710), on
objection of any party who has made a complete and timely compliance with
Section 2034.260, the trial court shall exclude from evidence the expert
opinion of any witness that is offered by any party who has unreasonably failed
to do any of the following: 
 
(a) List that witness as an expert under Section 2034.260. 
 
(b) Submit an expert witness declaration. 
 
(c) Produce reports and writings of expert witnesses under Section
2034.270.
 
 (d) Make that expert
available for a deposition under Article 3 (commencing with Section 2034.410).
 
Failure to comply with expert designation
rules may be found to be “unreasonable” when a party's conduct gives the
appearance of gamesmanship. (Staub v. Kiley (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 1437,
1447, citing Stanchfield v. Hamer Toyota, Inc. (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th
1495, 1504.) The operative inquiry is whether the conduct being evaluated will
compromise these evident purposes of the discovery statutes: “to assist the
parties and the trier of fact in ascertaining the truth; to encourage settlement
by educating the parties as to the strengths of their claims and defenses; to
expedite and facilitate preparation and trial; to prevent delay; and to
safeguard against surprise.” (Id. at p. 1504.) 
 
On receipt of an expert witness list from a party, any other party may
take the deposition of any person on the list.  Except as otherwise
provided, the procedures for taking oral and written depositions apply to a
deposition of a listed trial expert witness.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2034.410.)  The service of a proper deposition notice accompanied by the
tender of the expert witness fee is effective to require the party employing or
retaining the expert to produce the expert for the deposition.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2034.460, subd. (a).)  If the party noticing the deposition fails
to tender the expert’s fee under Section 2034.430, the expert shall not be
deposed at that time unless the parties stipulate otherwise.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2034.460, subd. (b).) 
Discussion
Plaintiff moves to exclude Defendant GM’s expert
James Oaks’ testimony from trial, arguing that Defendant has acted unreasonably
in failing to produce him. In the alternative, Plaintiff moves to compel Oaks’
deposition.
On July 6, 2023, GM served a
demand for the exchange of expert witness information pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 2034.210(c). (Kim Decl., Exh. 1.) On July 27, 2023, GM
served its First Designation of Expert Witness, identifying James Oaks as GM’s
retained expert witness. (Id., Exh. 2.) 
On July 28, 2023, Plaintiff
noticed the deposition of GM’s expert witness, Mr. Oaks pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure section 2034.410. On August 8, 2023, Defendant served
boilerplate objections, and objected to the holding of the deposition on
several grounds including the unavailability of its designated expert witness.
While stating that it would produce a witness at a mutually convenient time and
place, Defendant did not provide a new date for Mr. Oaks’s deposition. (Id.,
Exh. 5.) On August 9, 2023, Plaintiff sent Defendant a meet and confer email
requesting dates for the deposition to go forward. No response was received.
(Id., Exh. 6.) On August 10, 2023, Plaintiff attempted to meet and confer
telephonically regarding this dispute. A voicemail was left due to Defendant’s
unavailability. No return call was received. (Id., Decl. ¶ 10.) On August 17,
2023, the parties met and conferred telephonically regarding the deposition of
Mr. Oaks. Plaintiff requested dates of availability for the deposition of Defendant’s expert, Mr. Oaks to
go forward, but Defendant did not provide a date for the deposition to go
forward. (Id., ¶ 11.) As of the date of this Motion, GM has not provided
alternate dates for GM’s expert witness to be deposed. 
The
Court finds that Defendant’s position is not unreasonable in that it does not
show gamesmanship. As such, the motion to exclude Defendant’s expert’s
testimony is denied. 
However, the Court
finds that Defendant’s expert’s deposition should be compelled. While Defendant objected to the deposition notice
because it was unilaterally set, Plaintiff’s counsel attests to and provides
evidence of his efforts to schedule the deposition on a mutually convenient
date. Defendant did not respond. As such, the Court finds the objection to the
deposition based on being unilaterally set is invalid. 
The Court notes
that Plaintiff’s deposition notice included a request for documents under Code of Civil Procedure section 2034.415. However, although not requested by Plaintiff in this
motion, the Court clarifies that it is not compelling the production of the
materials called for by the deposition notice as no legal authority is cited in
this motion to do so, and Plaintiff is moving under Civil Procedure section
2034.010 et seq.
 
Therefore,
the motion to compel the deposition of Oaks
is granted. Oaks is
ordered to appear for deposition within 30 days of this order. 
 
Conclusion
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion to Exclude Expert at Trial or, in the Alternative, Compel
Deposition is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part. The motion to compel the
deposition is granted. Oaks is ordered to appear for deposition within 30 days of this
order. The motion to exclude is denied. 
Moving party is ordered to give
notice.
