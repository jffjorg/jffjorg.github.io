And here is the English text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has denied the defendant's ex parte application to advance the hearing date on its motion to stay the proceedings. The defendant had sought to advance the hearing date due to pending appellate matters that may determine whether the plaintiff's claims violate the Gift Clause of the California Constitution. The court has instead advanced the defendant's motion for stay from January 22, 2025 to August 7, 2024, with opposition and reply briefs due in compliance with the new hearing date.
