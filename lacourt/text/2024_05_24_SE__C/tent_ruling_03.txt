Hernandez vs Daniel Lopez, et al., Case No. 24NWCV00960
This is an
unlawful detainer action. Plaintiff moves ex parte to advance the hearing on
Defendants’ demurrer. 
A party may
seek ex parte relief upon an affirmative factual showing "irreparable
harm, immediate danger, or any other statutory basis for granting relief ex
parte." (Cal. R. Ct. 3.1202(c).)
Defendants’
demurrer is currently scheduled for December 17, 2024. Plaintiff contends that
unlawful detainer actions have a right to a quick and expeditious remedy as
established by statute. (See CCP § 1179a and § 1170.5(a).) 
The Court finds
that Plaintiff would be harmed by delay by possibly being deprived of
possession of the subject property. 
Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s ex parte application is GRANTED. Defendants’ demurrer is ADVANCED
from Tuesday, December 17, 2024 to today’s date and CONTINUED to Tuesday, June
4, 2024 at 10:30 a.m. in Department SE-C.  Opposition is due May 29, 2024
and Reply is due May 31, 2024.  
Moving party to
