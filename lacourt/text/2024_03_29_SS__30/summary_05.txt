And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling grants the motions of defendants Gregory S. Smith and Barbara S. Reece to compel responses to form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for production of documents. The plaintiff, Johnnie Jackson, Jr., is ordered to provide verified responses without objections to the discovery requests within 20 days. The defendants' request for sanctions is denied due to inadequate notice, as they failed to identify who they seek sanctions against in the notice of motion. The court finds that the defendants are entitled to a court order directing the plaintiff to provide responses because they properly served the requests for discovery and the plaintiff has failed to provide responses.
