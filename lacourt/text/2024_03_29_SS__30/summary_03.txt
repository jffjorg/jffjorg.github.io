And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling denies the defendant's motion to compel the plaintiff's attendance at an independent medical examination (IME). The defendant had previously noticed the IME for January 8, 2024, but the plaintiff objected and failed to appear. The defendant then noticed a second IME for January 15, 2024, with only 12 days' notice, which is less than the 30 days required by law. The court finds that there is no valid notice in order to compel the plaintiff's attendance at the IME. As a result, the motion is denied. The court also denies the defendant's request for sanctions against the plaintiff. The court notes that the defendant should meet and confer with the plaintiff to obtain a date for her availability and encourages the plaintiff to cooperate in setting up her IME to avoid the imposition of monetary sanctions in the future.
