```

And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge, Jose Quintanilla, has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendants' unopposed motion to dismiss the plaintiff's action against them. The motion was based on the plaintiff's failure to comply with a court order to respond to discovery, but the defendants did not give proper notice to the plaintiff. The notice of motion stated that the hearing was set for March 29, 2020, which is an incorrect date. The Judge has denied the motion without prejudice so that the defendants can give the plaintiff proper notice.
