And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for an order deeming the truth of matters stated in requests for admissions propounded to plaintiff Jeff Shin, and a request for sanctions. The motion is denied as moot because plaintiff has served verified responses to the requests for admissions. The request for sanctions is also denied because the court finds that the fee request is unreasonably inflated. The court notes that the parties should have looked to Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280(c) instead of subdivision (a) when dealing with responses to requests for admissions.
