And here is the English-text summary:

The Court has reviewed the Partition Referee's Notice of Motion and Motion for Order, which seeks to approve and settle the Referee's Final Report and Accounting, direct West Coast Escrow to release $250,000 in Escrow Account to Referee Estate, and approve the Referee's Recommended Distribution of Funds. The Court has also reviewed Plaintiffs' Response to Referee Final Report, in which Plaintiffs confirm they have no objections to the Report or opposition to the motion. The Court received an email from Defendant Edward H. Lubin, which appears to be an improper ex parte communication to the Court. Despite this, the Court denies Defendant's request for a continuance of the hearing because he fails to demonstrate good cause. The Court grants the motion of the Partition Referee and awards additional fees to the Referee to cover attorney's fees generated to respond to Defendant's ex parte request. The Court sets a non-appearance case review to consider the proposed final order on November 16, 2023.
