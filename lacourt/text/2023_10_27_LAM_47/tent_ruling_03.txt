OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is a breach of contract action. Plaintiff seeks to recover a
principal of $749,499.42 for a loan on which Plaintiff alleges Defendants
defaulted. 
 
Plaintiff moves for entry of
judgment pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure §644. 
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Plaintiff’s motion for entry of
judgment is GRANTED. 
 
Judgment is entered this date for
Plaintiff and against Defendant in the amount of $891,356.37,
plus $58,160 in attorney’s fees and $44,026.08 in costs, for a total award of
$993,542.45, for which Defendants shall be jointly and severally liable. 
 
DISCUSSION:
 
Plaintiff moves for entry of
judgment pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 644. 
 
Code of Civil Procedure section
644(a) provides that, “[i]n the case of a consensual general reference pursuant
to Section 638, the decision of the referee or commissioner upon the whole
issue must stand as the decision of the court, and upon filing of the statement
of decision with the clerk of the court, judgment may be entered thereon in the
same manner as if the action had been tried by the court.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 644(a).)
Under Local Rule 3.9(c), a prevailing party must file a noticed motion
requesting the Court issue judgment consistent with the report of the referee.
(Super. Ct. L.A. County, Local Rules, Rule 3.9(c).) 
 
On
September 2, 2022, this Court ordered a general reference of this action
pursuant to an agreement by the parties under Code of Civil Procedure section
638. (September 2, 2023 Minute Order.) On August 22, 2023, Plaintiff filed a
Notice of Entry of Referee’s Statement of Decision, which incorporated the
August 21, 2023 Statement of Decision finding in favor of Plaintiff and against
Defendants in the amount of $891,356.37, jointly and severally, plus attorney’s
fees and costs to be determined. (Notice of Entry of Referee Statement of Decision.)
Plaintiff states that following briefing on the proper amount of attorney’s
fees and costs, the referee issued an Amended Statement of Decision dated
September 14, 2023, awarding Defendant an additional $58,160 in attorney’s fees
and $44,026.08 in costs, for a total award of $993,542.45. (Declaration of
Wayne Terry ISO Mot. Exh. 3.) Plaintiff has provided the Court with a proposed
judgment consistent with the Amended Statement of Decision. (Id. Exh.
4.) 
 
As Plaintiff’s
filings all appear in order, Plaintiff’s request for entry of judgment is
granted. 
 
CONCLUSION:

 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s motion for entry of
judgment is GRANTED. 
 
Judgment is entered this date for
Plaintiff and against Defendant in the amount of $891,356.37,
plus $58,160 in attorney’s fees and $44,026.08 in costs, for a total award of
$993,542.45, for which Defendants shall be jointly and severally liable. 
 
Moving Party to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.

            Any party may submit on the
tentative ruling by contacting the courtroom via email at Smcdept47@lacourt.org by no later than 4:00 p.m. the day
before the hearing. All interested parties must be copied on the email. It
should be noted that if you submit on a tentative ruling the court will still
conduct a hearing if any party appears. By submitting on the tentative you
have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you
should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an
order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
