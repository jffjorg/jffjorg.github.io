Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer and motion to strike filed by the defendant, Elden Elms, LP, against the complaint of the plaintiffs, Joshua Lombardo and Michael D. Everett. The demurrer challenges the sixth, eighth, and ninth causes of action, and the motion to strike seeks to remove references to punitive damages.

The court has sustained the demurrer as to the sixth cause of action, alleging intentional infliction of emotional distress, because the plaintiffs failed to allege facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The court has also sustained the demurrer as to the ninth cause of action, alleging fraudulent concealment, because the plaintiffs failed to plead facts with the requisite specificity.

The court has granted the motion to strike the references to punitive damages, as the plaintiffs failed to plead facts sufficient to support a claim for punitive damages. The court has granted the defendant's demurrer and motion to strike without leave to amend, but has given the plaintiffs 30 days to amend their complaint to cure the defects.

The court has noted that this is the first demurrer brought against the plaintiffs' original complaint, and has therefore given the plaintiffs leave to amend with a liberal hand, cautioning them that they may only amend the complaint as authorized by the court's order.
