And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

This tentative ruling is issued by Judge Maurice A. Leiter in a case between Plaintiffs Steven Douglas Green and Nicholas Ray Green and Defendants Los Angeles Dodgers, LLC, Christian Mejia, and Winnie Landrum. The case involves a dispute arising from a baseball game where Plaintiffs were wrongfully and forcefully detained, searched, and ejected, and were wrongfully caused LAPD to arrest and detain them.

The Judge denies the Defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings, finding that the Plaintiffs have stated claims for violation of the Bane Act. The Judge finds that the Plaintiffs have alleged sufficient facts to show that the Defendants interfered with their legal rights through threat and violence.

The Judge grants the Defendants' motion to bifurcate the liability/compensatory damages phase of trial and any punitive damages phase of trial, as required by California Civil Code § 3295(d). The Court will bifurcate the trial into two phases: Phase 1 will include liability, compensatory damages, and entitlement to punitive damages, and Phase 2 will address the amount of punitive damages.
