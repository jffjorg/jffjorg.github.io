And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Barrington Pacific LLC, moved to compel further discovery from the plaintiffs, Stacey Carr-Susor, Chi Cho, Deanne Turner, and Jean Mejia, in regards to their affirmative defense. The plaintiffs argued that the defendant's motion is based on an overstatement of the meaning and purpose of the Investigative Consumer Reporting Agencies Act (ICRAA). The court found that the defendant did not sufficiently support its position and that the discovery sought would not tend to show whether or not there was a violation of ICRAA. As a result, the court denied the defendant's motion to compel further discovery.
