And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the Defendant's motion to compel arbitration. The Plaintiff, Tressia Mitchell, filed a lawsuit against the Defendant, American Honda Motor Co., alleging breach of express warranty and concealment. The Defendant submitted evidence of an arbitration agreement that was entered into by the Plaintiff on September 28, 2021, as part of a purchase contract for a new 2021 Honda CR-V. The arbitration provision in the contract states that any claim arising out of the purchase and condition of the vehicle could be resolved by binding arbitration. The Judge concludes that the preponderance of evidence indicates the existence of an arbitration agreement that covers the Plaintiff's claim. Since the Plaintiff did not oppose the motion, the Judge grants the motion and orders the matter stayed pending the completion of arbitration proceedings.
