And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for terminating sanctions against defendant Nile Niami. As a result, Niami's answer is stricken, and the plaintiff is ordered to seek the entry of default with the clerk's office. Niami is also sanctioned $8,676, payable within 30 days. The judge found that Niami repeatedly failed and refused to participate in discovery and depositions, and feigned interest in settlement and delay discovery. The court considers Niami's failure to oppose the motion as a concession to the plaintiff's request for sanctions.
