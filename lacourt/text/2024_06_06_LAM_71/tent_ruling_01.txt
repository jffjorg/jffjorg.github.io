 Case
  No.:  22STCV15728 
 
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  June 6, 2024



 
Defendant Hollywood Foreign Press Association’s
motion for attorneys’ fees against pro per Plaintiff Husam Asi is granted in the reduced total amount of $322,354.90.
 
Defendant
Hollywood Foreign Press Association (“HFPA”) (“Defendant”) moves for an order
awarding it attorneys’ fees against pro per Plaintiff Husam Asi (“Asi”) (“Plaintiff”) in
the total amount of $460,507.00 for fees incurred from May 18, 2022, to the
present in connection with its successful special motion to strike (“anti-SLAPP
Motion”) and to prepare this motion for award of mandatory attorneys’ fees.  (Notice of Motion, pg. 2; C.C.P. §425.16(c).)  HFPA moves on the basis it is the “prevailing
defendant” under C.C.P. §425.16(c). On June 14, 2023, this Court issued an
order granting in part the HFPA’s anti-SLAPP motion to strike Plaintiff’s 8th
cause of action to the extent it was based on protected activity.  On December 27, 2023, remittitur issued
following the Court of Appeal’s October 13, 2023 opinion instructing the Court
to strike Plaintiff’s 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th causes of action to
the extent they are based on the HFPA’s protected activity, and granting the
HFPA its costs of appeal as the prevailing party.  (12/27/23 Remittitur; 10/13/23 Opinion at pg.
33.)
 
Background
On May 11, 2022, Plaintiff
filed his initial complaint against HFPA and Non-Moving Defendants Greg
Goeckner (“Goeckner”) and James Lee (“Lee”) (collectively, “Defendants”)
alleging fourteen causes of action: (1) breach of contract [alleged against
HFPA]; (2) breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing [alleged
against HFPA]; (3) tortious breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair
dealing [alleged against HFPA]; (4) tortious interference with contractual
relations [alleged against HFPA]; (5) tortious interference with prospective
economic advantage [alleged against HFPA]; (6) violation of Business &
Professions Code §§1700 et seq. [alleged against HFPA]; (7) intentional
infliction of emotional distress [alleged against HFPA]; (8) negligent
infliction of emotional distress [alleged against HFPA]; (9) violation of the
California Right of Fair Procedure [alleged against HFPA]; (10)
constructive/retaliatory discharge in violation of public policy; (11) sexual
harassment in violation of FEHA (hostile work environment); (12) harassment and
discrimination on the basis of race, national origin, and/or color in violation
of FEHA; (13) violation of FEHA- failure to prevent discrimination, harassment,
and retaliation; and (14) retaliation for engaging in protected activity.  
On December 5, 2022, the
Court heard oral argument on the HFPA’s anti-SLAPP Motion as to the nine causes
of action alleged against it.  On
December 9, 2022, following the hearing, the Court granted the HFPA’s
anti-SLAPP Motion as to Plaintiff’s 8th cause of action, but denied it with
respect to the 1st-7th and 9th causes of action, finding that Plaintiff had
demonstrated a probability of prevailing on those claims.
On January 25, 2023, the HFPA
timely appealed.  Following oral argument
on October 9, 2023, the Court of Appeal issued an opinion on October 13, 2023
(“Appellate Opinion”) reversing the Trial Court Order and remanding with instructions
to strike Plaintiff’s 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th causes of action to
the extent they are based on the HFPA’s Press Releases.  (12/27/23 Remittitur, pg. 33.)  The Court of Appeal affirmed, on different
grounds, the Trial Court Order solely with respect to Plaintiff’s 9th cause of
action, concluding that it did not arise out of the HFPA’s Press Releases.  (12/27/23 Remittitur, pgs. 15-16.)
On February 5, 2024, HFPA filed
the instant motion for attorneys’ fees. 
On May 23, 2024, Plaintiff filed his opposition.  On May 30, 2024, HFPA filed its reply.
 
Discussion
C.C.P.
§425.16(c)(1) provides, in part, “a prevailing defendant on a special motion to
strike shall be entitled to recover that defendant’s attorney’s fees and costs.”  California law makes the award of attorneys’
fees and costs to a prevailing anti-SLAPP defendant mandatory.  (See Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th
1122, 1131 [“[u]nder Code of Civil Procedure §425.16, subdivision (c), any
SLAPP defendant who brings a successful motion to strike is entitled to
mandatory attorney’s fees.”].)  Here, HFPA
was the prevailing party in the Anti-SLAPP Motion.  (See 12/27/23 Remittitur, pg. 1;
CRC, Rule 8.278(a)(1) [“party prevailing in the Court of Appeal in a civil case
. . . is entitled to costs on appeal”].) 
Accordingly, HFPA’s motion for attorneys’ fees is proper and it is
entitled to recover attorneys’ fees and costs.
 
Reasonable Fees
The California Supreme Court has determined
the lodestar method is the proper mechanism to calculate attorneys’ fees under
C.C.P. §425.16(c).  (See Ketchum, 24 Cal.4th at pg. 1136.)  To calculate a
lodestar amount, the Court must first determine the reasonableness of the
hourly rates sought by Defendant’s counsel.  The “reasonable hourly rate” applicable under
the lodestar method is the rate “prevailing in the community for similar work.”
 (PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000)
22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095.)  “The trial court
makes its determination after consideration of a number of factors, including
the nature of the litigation, its difficulty, the amount involved, the skill
required in its handling, the skill employed, the attention given, the success
or failure, and other circumstances in the case.”  (Id. at pg. 1096.)
HFPA’s Counsel declares the following hourly
rates charged by Latham & Watkins attorneys on this matter: (1) Robert J.
Ellison (2022- $1,265/hour; 2023- $1,360/hour; 2024- $1,495/hour); (2) Chandler
S. Howell (2022- $990/hour; 2023- $1,140/hour; 2024- $1,275/hour); and (3) Alexa
A. Nakamura (2022- $655/hour; 2023- $830/hour; 2024- $1,030/hour).  (Decl. of Ellison ¶¶3-6.)  The Court determines based on its experience
that HFPA’s Counsel’s hourly rates are not reasonable in their community of
practice.  HFPA’s counsel declares that
the fees sought represent an approximate $100,000 voluntary reduction, which is
still hard to believe.  (Decl. of Ellison
¶16.)
Plaintiff’s arguments that HFPA’s Counsel’s
fees are excessive are well taken.  While
HFPA’s counsel was successful in trimming down Plaintiff’s allegations against
HFPA, evidenced by the Court of Appeal overturning the Trial Court Order on
seven of the eight causes of action in the anti-SLAPP motion, the requested fees
exceeding $1,000/hour, particularly for associates with less than a decade of
practice, is excessive.
Therefore, the Court will impose an overall reduction in the
fees requested below.
 
Billed Hours
The verified time entries of the attorneys
are entitled to a presumption of credibility, which extends to an attorney’s
professional judgment as to whether time spent was reasonably necessary to the
litigation.  (Horsford v. Board of Trustees of California State University (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 359, 396 [“We think
the verified time statements of the attorney as officers of the court are
entitled to credence in the absence of a clear indication the records are
erroneous.”].)  “California courts do not
require detailed time records, and trial courts have discretion to award fees
based on declarations of counsel describing the work they have done and the
court’s own view of the number of hours reasonably spent.”  (Syers
Properties III, Inc. v. Rankin
(2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 691, 698-699.) 
Here, HFPA’s counsel does not submit a billing
statement of its fees and costs, rather, HFPA’s counsel provides a chronological,
month-by-month summary of the fees and specific tasks undertaken by HFPA’s
counsel. HFPA’s counsel’s month-by-month summary appears unnecessary; a detailed,
itemized billing statement would have sufficed.  (See Decl. of Ellison ¶¶17-34.)  HFPA’s counsel declares Latham & Watkins
expended a total of 505.7 hours ($460,507.00): (1) 123.8 hours ($101,246.50) to
draft the anti-SLAPP Motion; (2) 43.5 hours ($36,996.00) to oppose Plaintiff’s
attempts to obtain discovery ahead of the hearing on the anti-SLAPP Motion; (3)
67.6 hours ($59,552.00) to prepare HFPA’s reply papers, draft evidentiary objections
to Plaintiff’s declaration in support of his opposition, prepare its opposition
to Plaintiff’s Discovery Motion, and prepare for the hearing; (4) 215.5 hours ($205,680.00)
appealing the Court’s denial of the HFPA’s anti-SLAPP Motion on eight of
Plaintiff’s causes of action; and (5) 35.3 hours ($35,217.00) to prepare the
instant motion.  (Decl. of Ellison ¶¶16, 35.)  HFPA’s counsel also requests twenty
anticipated hours ($21,815.00) in connection with preparing a reply brief and
appearing at the hearing.  (Decl. of
Ellison ¶¶34-35.)
Plaintiff’s arguments in opposition to HFPA’s
motion are unavailing because his objections to HFPA’s request for fees do not
point to the specific items challenged with sufficient arguments and citations
to the evidence; general arguments that fees claimed are excessive,
duplicative, or unrelated do not suffice. 
(Premier Medical Management
Systems, Inc. v. California Insurance Guarantee Association (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 550, 564.)
However, the Court is disinclined to grant
an additional twenty hours to draft a reply on the instant motion, particularly
in light of the fact that Plaintiff’s arguments were not particularized, and addresses
issues extraneous to an analysis to determine if the attorneys’ fees requested
are reasonable.  Further, 67.6 hours to oppose
and draft evidentiary objections to Plaintiff’s Discovery Motion, including
Plaintiff’s ex parte application, also appears excessive.  HFPA’s summary of its month-by-month fees has
a similar effect of block billing—the Court is unable to discern whether HFPA’s
counsel has padded the hours requested.
Accordingly, the Court reduces HFPA’s
requested hours by 30% of the requested total, or $138,152.10, granting HFPA’s
requested hours in the reduced total of $322,354.90.
 
Conclusion
HFPA’s
motion is granted in the reduced amount of $322,354.90.
