Summary:

The court has denied the defendant's motion for summary judgment in the case Graham Nudd v. Elizabeth Shaw et al. The defendant had argued that the plaintiff's cause of action for breach of contract fails because the defendant did not breach the lease and the plaintiff was aware of the leak by October 1, 2018. However, the court found that there are triable issues of material fact on the issues of whether the defendant breached the lease, whether the plaintiff was aware of the leak by October 1, 2018, and whether the plaintiff could have avoided the damages. The court also found that the defendant's claim that the plaintiff could not recover indemnification damages because the parties did not contemplate such damages when they entered the contract is not supported by evidence.
