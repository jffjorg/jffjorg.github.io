And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to expunge a lis pendens filed by plaintiff Juan Manuel Correa. The motion was filed by Christopher Cox, who purchased the property in early 2024. The judge finds that the presumption that Cox is a bona fide purchaser for value is rebuttable because Correa's lis pendens was filed in 2023, prior to Cox's purchase, and put Cox on constructive notice of Correa's claim to the property. The judge also finds that Correa's documentary evidence that his signature on the grant deed was forged supports the probable validity of his claim. The judge notes that the bankruptcy court's dismissal orders were not final judgments on the merits, and therefore, res judicata does not apply. As a result, the judge denies the motion to expunge the lis pendens and orders Cox to give notice.
