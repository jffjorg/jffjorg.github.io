  Case Number:  23STCV09552    Hearing Date:   January 21, 2025    Dept:  74 JUAN MANUEL  CORREA vs SKT INVESTMENT GROUP LLC, et al. 23STCV09552 Motion to Expunge Lis Pendens    The  presumption that Christopher Cox is a bona fide purchaser for value is rebuttable  because plaintiff’s lis pendens filed in 2023 before Cox bought the property in  early 2024 put Cox on constructive notice of plaintiff’s claim to the property.  Plaintiff’s documentary evidence that his signature on the grant deed was  forged supports the probable validity of his claim. The bankruptcy court’s  dismissal orders were not a final judgment on the merits. Accordingly, res  judicata does not apply. The  court denies the motion to expunge the lis pendens. Cox  to give notice.
