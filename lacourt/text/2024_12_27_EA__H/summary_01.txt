And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's application for default judgment without prejudice. The judge notes that the plaintiff has not shown that the defendants continue to engage in trademark infringement and unfair competition, and therefore does not see the need for a permanent injunction. The judge also points out several discrepancies in the plaintiff's proposed judgment, including inconsistencies in the calculation of costs and attorney's fees. The judge requests that the plaintiff submit a revised, full, and complete default judgment packet that addresses these issues.
