Buddhist Association of the United States v. The Buddhist Association of the
United States, et al., Case No. 22PSCV00691


ORDER ON DEFAULT JUDGMENT APPLICATION
Plaintiff The Buddhist Association of the
United States’ Application for Default Judgment is DENIED without prejudice.
 
Background
Plaintiff
The Buddhist Association of the United States (“New York BAUS”) alleges as
follows:

          New York BAUS was formed in 1964 and
is a New York non-profit corporation located in Carmel, New York. New York BAUS
was granted tax exempt status by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) in 1965.
New York BAUS owns, manages and operates a large Buddhist monastery in Carmel,
as well as a temple in the Bronx, offers a wide range of programs and has an
extensive Internet presence through its website www.baus.org. New York BAUS
also has active, registered trademarks for “Buddhist Association of the United
States” and for its Chinese name. Defendant The Buddhist Association of the
United States (“California BAUS”) was incorporated in California on May 10,
2005. In early 2018, the IRS communicated with New York BAUS about a change of
address to a location in El Monte; it was at this time that New York BAUS
learned that California BAUS was using the BAUS name and was also using New
York BAUS’s federal EIN number for tax purposes, without its consent. California
BAUS, Zhong Lin Sun (“Sun”), Zengkui Li (“Li”), Ke You Han (“Han”), and Chan De
(“De”) (together, “Defendants”) have also used New York BAUS’s name, trademarks,
and other information without its consent.
On
July 8, 2022, New York BAUS filed a complaint, asserting causes of action
against California BAUS, Sun, Li, Han and De for:
          1.       Conversion,
          2.       Fraud,
          3.       Federal
Trademark Infringement Under 15 U.S.C. § 1114(1),
          4.       Common
Law Trademark Infringement,
          5.       Unfair
Competition Under California Business & Professions Code § 17200 et seq.,
          6.       False
Designation of Origin, False Advertising, and Unfair Competition Under 15
U.S.C. § 1125, and
          7.       California
Common Law Unfair Competition. 
On
November 7, 2022, an “Order for Service by Publication of Summons” was filed as
to Sun, Li, Han, and De; on December 9, 2022, proof of publication was filed. 
On
March 22, 2023, the Clerk entered default against California BAUS, Sun, Han, Li.
and De. 
On
July 30, 2024, Plaintiff dismissed Li, without prejudice. 
Pending
before the Court is Plaintiff’s Application for Default Judgment.  
Discussion 
Plaintiff’s
Application for Default Judgment is denied without prejudice. The
following defects are noted: 
          1.       The
Court notes that on June 14, 2024, Judge Peter A. Hernandez denied Plaintiff’s
previous application, in part, on the following basis: 
          “Plaintiff seeks injunctive relief via
its fifth cause of action for ‘Unfair Competition—California Business &
Professions Code § 17200 et seq.’ Plaintiff has not shown that Defendants ‘continue
to engage in trademark infringement, unlawful, unfair, and/or fraudulent
conduct[ ] in violation of § 17200, et seq. of the California Business and
Professions Code. . .,’ that Defendants ‘continue to engage in conduct
that is deceptive, untrue, and misleading in violation of California Business
and Professions Code § 17500 . . .’ and that ‘unless enjoined, [Defendants’
conduct] will continue to cause irreparable harm to Plaintiff and the
general public.’ (Memorandum, 8:5-11 [emphasis added]).” 
The
Court does not see that Plaintiff has addressed the above concern. “Although a
decision whether to issue, and how to phrase, a permanent injunction is
essentially discretionary, the trial court’s discretion is by no means as broad
as that which it might exercise in weighing the equities of the parties’
positions for the purpose of deciding whether to issue a preliminary injunction
or other provisional relief.” (DVD Copy Control Assn., Inc. v. Kaleidescape,
Inc. (2009) 176 Cal.App.4th 697, 721 [quotations and citation omitted]). 
“[A]
permanent injunction, notwithstanding its discretionary component, must be
sufficiently supported by the evidence of record.” (Id.). “Injunctive power
is not used as punishment for past acts and is ordered against them only if
there is evidence they will probably recur.” (Mallon v. City of Long Beach
(1958) 164 Cal.App.2d 178, 190.)
Here,
the latest date identified in the complaint appears to be August 9, 2021, when
Plaintiff received a communication from the Internal Revenue Service.
(Complaint, ¶ 34, Exh. 8.) Plaintiff alleged therein that Defendants “infringed
the Trademarks in at least three filings with the California Secretary of State
and at least four communications with the IRS.” (Id., ¶ 79; see also, ¶
102 and Prayer, ¶ 6.)  
Hsu
Chieh-Ming (“Chieh-Ming”), in the instant default prove-up packet, identifies
the three filings with the California Secretary of State as the Articles of
Incorporation filed May 10, 2015, the Statement of Information filed August 24,
2015 and the Statement of Information filed January 2, 2018. (Chieh-Ming Decl.,
¶ 3(i), Exh. 1.) Chieh-Ming identifies the four communications with the IRS as
occurring in or around June 2018, May 2019, June 2020, and May 2021; again, the
last communication identified in Exhibit 2 is dated August 9, 2021. (Id.,
¶ 3(ii), Exh. 2.)
Plaintiffs
assert that “the declaration of Tsu-Ku Lee explains how defendants continue to
engagement [sic] in trademark infringement, unlawful, unfair, and/or fraudulent
conduct in violation of § 17200, et seq., continue to engage in conduct that is
deceptive, untrue, and misleading in violation of § 17500, and unless enjoined
will continue to cause irreparable harm to Plaintiff and the general public.”
(Memorandum, 5:27-6:3). The Court disagrees. Tsu-Ku Lee (“Lee”) attests that
Plaintiff received a letter around July 24, 2022 from Sun, which is attached as
Exhibit 8 to Lee’s declaration.[FN] Lee,
however, does not identify any subsequent dates. Plaintiff concedes that it
“does not have more information regarding the infringements.” (See “Memorandum
in Support of Requests for Entry of Default Judgment Against All Defendants”
[“Memorandum”], 5:18-19.) Under the circumstances, the Court is not inclined to
grant a permanent injunction against Defendants.
          2.       Paragraphs
2 and 7 of Plaintiff’s Judicial Council form CIV-100 Request for Court
Judgment list costs as “0.00.” Paragraph 6a.(4) of the proposed judgment is
blank next to the line “Costs.” Plaintiff, however, has submitted a separate
Judicial Council form MC-010 Memorandum of Costs (Summary), which
identifies costs of $6,252.30. Attorney Anastasiya Menshikova (“Menshikova”) also
identifies costs of $6,275.53 and provides a calculation of these costs in
Paragraphs 9-11 of her declaration. Plaintiff’s Memorandum identifies costs.
(Memorandum, 10:25-11:7.) The Court requests that Plaintiff reconcile these
discrepancies.  
          3.       Paragraph
2 of Plaintiff’s Judicial Council form CIV-100 Request for Court
Judgment is blank with respect to the line
“Attorney fees.” Paragraph 6a.(3) of the proposed judgment is blank next to the
line “Attorney fees.” Menshikova, however, identifies $67,665.00 in attorney’s
fees in Paragraph 12 of her declaration. Plaintiff’s Memorandum identifies
attorney’s fees. (Memorandum, 11:8-15). These discrepancies must be reconciled.
          4.       Paragraph
2 of Plaintiff’s Judicial Council form CIV-100 Request for Court Judgment
is blank with respect to the line “Demand of Complaint.” Paragraph 6a.(1) of
the proposed judgment lists “Damages” as “0.00.” Plaintiff’s Memorandum, however,
“asks the Court to enter default judgment against Defendants, obligating them
to pay Plaintiff $73,917.30 in damages. . . Alternatively, Plaintiff agrees to
a nominal damages award of $1.00.” (Memorandum, 3:13-16 [see also, 6:24-25
[“Plaintiff is entitled to judgment in the amount of $73,917.30 or if the Court
so decides a nominal damage award of $1.00”].).
Accordingly,
the application is denied without prejudice, and Plaintiff is directed to
submit a revised, full, and complete default judgment packet that addresses the
aforementioned issues.
