And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling in this case, continuing the matter to January 17, 2025, and ordering the parties to meet and confer by December 13, 2024. The parties have been unable to agree on document production and meet and confer, with each side blaming the other for the lack of progress. The Court has advised the parties that it typically orders and limits production of documents, including electronically stored information, in Song-Beverly single-vehicle cases. The parties are instructed to produce specific documents, including purchase and lease contracts, repair orders, and warranty claims, and to file a joint statement setting forth any unresolved discovery disputes by January 3, 2025. The Court hopes that the meet and confer process will facilitate a resolution of the outstanding issues in the case.
