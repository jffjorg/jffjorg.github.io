And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Hanmi Bank to the Cross-Complaint filed by Cross-Complainants. The demurrer is sustained in its entirety, and Cross-Complainants are granted 10 days leave to amend their Cross-Complaint. The First Amended Complaint must be filed by July 22, 2024.

The judge's ruling is based on the arguments presented by Hanmi Bank, which alleged that the Cross-Complaint fails to state facts sufficient to support its causes of action. Specifically, the judge found that the Cross-Complaint does not allege the existence of a legal duty of care, breach of that duty, and proximate cause resulting in injury. Additionally, the judge found that the Cross-Complaint does not allege the essential facts with reasonable particularity sufficient to acquaint the defendant with the nature, source, and extent of the cause of action.

The judge granted leave to amend because there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. The ruling is subject to change after the parties have filed their responses and the judge has reviewed the case.
