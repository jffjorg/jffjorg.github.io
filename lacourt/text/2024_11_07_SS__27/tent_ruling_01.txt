CASE NO./NAME: 20STCV42239 WALTER RAGSDALE
vs COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES et al.
Moving Party: Defendant County of Los Angeles
Responding Party: Plaintiff¿ 
Notice: Sufficient¿ 
Ruling: COURT TO HEAR FROM PARTIES 
 
On November 4, 2020,
Plaintiff Walter Ragsdale filed the present complaint, alleging a dangerous
condition of public property against the County of Los Angeles. Plaintiff
claims he was injured while sitting in the lobby area of the probation office
located at 1660 W. Mission Blvd., Pomona, CA 91766 ("Subject
Property"), waiting for his probation officer, when his chair suddenly
collapsed. Defendant now moves the Court for summary judgment, asserting that Plaintiff’s
discovery responses are factually devoid and that the County had no actual or
constructive notice of the alleged dangerous condition.
In its opposition to
the motion, Plaintiff contends he has other necessary discovery to do to
adequately oppose the motion.  The Court
will discuss this issue with the parties.
