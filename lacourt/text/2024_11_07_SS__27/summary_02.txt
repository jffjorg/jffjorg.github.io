The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the plaintiff's motion to vacate the dismissal of the case. The plaintiff's counsel failed to inform the court that the settlement was no longer in effect and that the parties intended to proceed with litigation. The court found that the dismissal was caused by the counsel's mistake and that all requirements for mandatory relief under Code of Civil Procedure, ยง 473, subdivision (b) have been met. The motion was filed within the six-month deadline and includes counsel's declaration attesting to his mistake. A trial setting conference is scheduled for November, 2024, at 8:30 a.m.
