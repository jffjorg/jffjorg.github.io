And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Josiah Orellana, et al. vs. Ovig Vartanian, et al. The motion to quash and requests for sanctions were filed by the plaintiffs, who allege that the defendant issued workers' compensation subpoenas with incorrect forms. The defendant acknowledges that the subpoenas were withdrawn and reissued with the correct forms, but the plaintiffs argue that the defendant failed to provide timely confirmation of the withdrawal.

The court finds that the motion to quash is moot because the defendant has withdrawn the incorrect subpoenas and reissued the correct ones. However, the court grants the requests for sanctions because the defendant failed to provide timely confirmation of the withdrawal, causing the plaintiffs to incur attorney's fees. The court reduces the sanction to $1000, payable jointly and severally by the defendant and his attorney to the plaintiffs within 20 days of the order.

The court notes that the parties must submit to this tentative ruling by email or appear remotely or in person for oral argument. If the parties neither submit nor appear, the court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the court.
