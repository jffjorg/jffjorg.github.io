And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling by Judge Lee S. Arian grants relief from waiver to Defendant Smart & Final Stores, LLC, allowing the company to overcome its late responses to discovery requests. The Defendant attributed the delay to a clerical error during new personnel onboarding, and the Court finds this explanation credible. The Court also finds that the Defendant's verification of its responses, although imperfect, is substantially compliant with the requirements. The Plaintiff, Mony Oren-Benhamou, challenged the adequacy of the verification and argued that the delay in receiving responses prejudiced their ability to conduct discovery. However, the Court finds that the delay was unintentional and did not materially impact the Plaintiff's ability to proceed with litigation. The Court grants relief from waiver and allows the Defendant to respond to the Plaintiff's discovery requests.
