MOTION FOR RELIEF FROM WAIVER 
Hearing Date: 11/7/24 
CASE NO./NAME: 23STCV31815 MONY
OREN-BENHAMOU vs SMART & FINAL STORES, LLC
Moving Party: Defendant Smart & Final
Responding Party: Plaintiff 
Notice: Sufficient 
Ruling: GRANTED 
 
Background
On May 24, 2024, Plaintiff Mony Oren-Benhamou served
multiple discovery requests to Defendant Smart & Final Stores, LLC
(“Defendant”). Defendant’s responses were served on September 6, 2024, but were
late. Plaintiff argues that Defendant’s failure to provide timely, verified
responses resulted in a waiver of all objections, including those based on
privilege. Defendant seeks relief from this waiver, attributing the delay to
inadvertent calendaring errors during new personnel onboarding. Defendant asserts
that the delay was unintentional and was promptly corrected upon discovery.
Legal
Standard
Under California Code of Civil Procedure §§ 2030.290(a),
2031.300(a), and 2033.280(a), a party waives objections to discovery requests
if responses are not timely served. However, the court may grant relief from
this waiver if the responding party demonstrates substantial compliance with
discovery requirements and establishes that the delay was due to “mistake,
inadvertence, or excusable neglect.”
Discussion
Plaintiff challenges the adequacy of Defendant’s
verification, arguing that the statement “The matters stated in the foregoing
document are true of my knowledge” fails to satisfy the verification
requirements of California Code of Civil Procedure § 2015.5, which mandates
verification “under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
California.” The Court finds, however, that the verification is substantially
compliant for the purposes of relief from waiver. Any issue with the
verification language could have been addressed through a meet-and-confer
process as proposed by Defendant.
The Court finds Defendant’s explanation that the delay was
due to a clerical error related to calendaring deadlines during new personnel
onboarding credible. Plaintiff did not provide any evidence disputing this.
Defendant’s actions show that the mistake was unintentional, and responses were
served promptly upon discovery of the error. Courts recognize excusable neglect
when an unintentional error occurs despite reasonable precautions, and here,
Defendant’s immediate corrective action demonstrates diligence.
Plaintiff claims prejudice from the delay in receiving
responses but has not shown that the delay materially impacted Plaintiff’s
ability to conduct discovery or proceed with litigation. Defendant has
committed to providing any necessary privilege log and has indicated that all
responsive documents have been disclosed in good faith.
Plaintiff also points to minor deficiencies in Defendant’s
responses, such as insufficient linkage of documents to specific requests and
the need for clarification on privilege claims. However, the Court finds that
these issues are better addressed through a motion to compel further responses
rather than through waiver of objections.
Conclusion
Overall, the Court finds that Defendant’s responses
minimally satisfy the requirements for substantial compliance, and grants
relief from waiver.
