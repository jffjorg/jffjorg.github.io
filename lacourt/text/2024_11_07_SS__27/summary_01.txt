And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a motion for summary judgment filed by the County of Los Angeles against Walter Ragsdale, the plaintiff. The plaintiff is suing the county for a dangerous condition of public property, alleging that he was injured when the chair he was sitting in at a probation office in Pomona suddenly collapsed. The county is seeking summary judgment, arguing that the plaintiff's discovery responses are factually devoid and that the county had no actual or constructive notice of the alleged dangerous condition. The plaintiff opposes the motion, claiming that he needs additional discovery to adequately respond. The judge has scheduled a hearing for November 7, 2024, to discuss the issue of discovery with the parties.
