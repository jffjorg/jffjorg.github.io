The Court is unpersuaded by Defendant’s
due process argument that because Plaintiff failed to provide notice of the
August 13, 2024, order, Plaintiff’s motion should be denied.  Defendant had notice of the ruling, as both
parties submitted responses to the tentative ruling via email. Upon review, the
Court’s order to compel discovery was clearly stated in the tentative ruling.
