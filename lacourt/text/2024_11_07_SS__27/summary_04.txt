And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for trial continuance filed by Defendant Lyft. The motion is granted in part. The trial date is currently set for December 4, 2024, but Defendant Lyft requests a six-month continuance due to a trial conflict on December 2, 2024, and the need to complete discovery and mediation. The judge notes that this case is now more than two years old, and discovery and mediation should have been completed by now. While a change in counsel does not constitute good cause for a continuance, the judge is willing to grant a continuance due to the trial conflict. The trial date is continued to March 24, 2025, at 8:30 a.m., and the FSC will be continued to March 10, 2024, at 10:00 a.m.
