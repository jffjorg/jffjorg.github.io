Summary:
This tentative ruling pertains to case number 22STCV01789, a landlord-tenant dispute between plaintiffs Karime Caetano and Javier Caetano Tapiz and defendants Mario Garrido, Edgar Garrido, and Manuel Mendoza. The plaintiffs have filed a complaint alleging negligence, breach of implied warranty of habitability, breach of Los Angeles County Code section 8.52.130 et seq., and violation of Business and Professions Code section 17200. The defendants initially filed general denials, but the court struck these and entered default as to the defendants. Subsequently, the court entered default judgment against the defendants.

The defendants have now moved to set aside the default and default judgment, citing numerous legal grounds, including attorney mistake. The plaintiffs opposed the motion. The court has granted the motion based on attorney fault, ordering the defendants' counsel to pay $1,000 to the plaintiffs' counsel. The defendants are required to serve and file their responsive pleading on or before October 20, 2023.
