ANALYSIS:
 
I.                   
Background

 
On February 16, 2023, Plaintiff Kim
Youngblood (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant action against Defendant Marton
Price (“Defendant”) and Does 1-20, alleging Motor Vehicle and General
Negligence causes of action. (Compl., pp. 1, 4, 5.) The underlying facts of
this dispute involve a motor vehicle collision between the parties at the
intersection of Manchester Avenue and Normandie Avenue, Los Angeles,
California, 90047. (Compl., p. 5.) 
 
On May 6, 2024, Defendant filed an
Answer.
 
On June 3, 2024, the Court granted the
parties’ stipulation to continue the trial date from August 15, 2024 to
December 13, 2024 and to continue all discovery and trial-related deadlines.
(6/3/24 Order.) 
 
On June 4, 2024, Plaintiff acquired
new counsel – Raymond Feldman of Law Offices of John Ye. (6/4/24 Notice of
Association of Counsel.)
 
On October 2, 2024, Plaintiff filed
the instant Motion to Reclassify Action from Limited to Unlimited Jurisdiction
(the “Motion”). 
 
On November 22, 2024, Defendant filed
an Opposition. 
 
On December 3, 2024, the Court, as
part of its rulings, per the oral agreement of the parties, continued the jury
trial from December 13, 2024 to June 24, 2025. (12/3/24 Order.)
 
II.                
Legal
Standard 
 
Code of Civil Procedure section
403.040 allows a plaintiff to file a motion for reclassification of an action
within the time allowed for that party to amend the initial pleading. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 403.040, subd. (a).) “A party may amend its pleading once without
leave of court at any time before an answer, demurrer, or motion to strike is
filed, or after a demurrer or motion to strike is filed if the amended pleading
is filed and served no later than the date for filing an opposition to the
demurrer or motion to strike. (Code Civ. Proc., § 472, subd. (a).) If the
motion is made after the time for the plaintiff to amend the pleading, the
motion may only be granted if (1) the case is incorrectly classified; and (2)
the plaintiff shows good cause for not seeking reclassification earlier. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 403.040, subd. (b).) 
 
In Walker v. Superior Court (1991) 53
Cal.3d 257, 262, the California Supreme Court held that a matter may be
reclassified from unlimited to limited only if “the absence of
jurisdiction is apparent before trial from the complaint, petition, or related
documents,” or “during the course of pretrial litigation, it becomes clear that
the matter will ‘necessarily’ result in a verdict below the superior court jurisdictional
amount, and the court affords the parties an opportunity to contest transfer.”
(Walker, supra, 53 Cal.3d at p. 262.) This high
standard is appropriate in light of “the circumscribed procedures and recovery
available in the limited civil courts.” (Ytuarte
v. Superior Court (2005) 129 Cal.App.4th 266, 278.) 
 
            In Ytuarte, the
Second District Court of Appeal examined the principles set forth in Walker and granted a petition for writ
of mandate regarding the trial court’s denial of a party’s motion to reclassify
her case from limited to unlimited. (Ytuarte, supra, 129 Cal.App.4th 266.) In so
concluding, the Court of Appeal held that “the court should reject the
plaintiff’s effort to reclassify the action as unlimited only when the lack
of jurisdiction as an ‘unlimited’ case is certain and clear.” (Id., at p. 279.) In other words, the
trial court should deny reclassification “only where it appeared to a legal certainty
[the party’s] damages would necessarily be $25,000 or less.” (Id.,
at p. 271.) The Court qualified that a “party must present evidence to
demonstrate a possibility that the verdict will exceed $25,000,” and the
trial court must review the record to determine “whether a judgment in excess
of $25,000.00 is obtainable.” (Id., at pp. 277, 279.) 
 
III.             
Discussion
 
Moving
Party Position
 
            Plaintiff
seeks to reclassify the action to unlimited jurisdiction on the basis that Plaintiff
“claims bilateral knee injury from the subject accident and her orthopedic
surgeon recommends surgery costing about $250,000.” (Motion, p. 3; Feldman Decl., ¶ 5; Exh. B.) Plaintiff
also states that Defendant has indicated he would pay 80 percent of Plaintiff’s
damages. (Motion, p. 3.)
 
Opposition
            
            Defendant
opposes reclassification on the grounds that Plaintiff’s Motion is untimely, there
is “no good cause articulated by Plaintiff which excuses her from seeking
reclassification earlier,” and the action is correctly classified. (Motion, pp.
2, 3.) Indeed, Defendant argues that this matter is correctly classified
because “Plaintiff’s medical specials total approximately $13,000 [and]
Plaintiff has not been treated for his alleged injuries from the subject
accident since August 2021, over three years ago.” (Motion, pp. 3-4; Park
Decl., ¶ 3.) 
 
                        Reply
            
            Plaintiff
highlights Defendant did not dispute that Defendant agreed to pay 80 percent of
Plaintiff’s damages. (Reply, p. 2.) Next, Plaintiff notes Defendant does not
deny Plaintiff’s claim regarding bilateral knee surgery and future medical
expenses; instead, Defendant merely raises the past medical expenses of
$13,000. (Reply, p. 2.) Additionally, Plaintiff highlights Defendant
misgendered Plaintiff. (Reply, p. 2.) Finally, Plaintiff states that Defendant
fails to cite any legal authority for the proposition that Plaintiff’s Motion
is untimely, Defendant misconstrues the standard for motions to reclassify, and
there would be no prejudice to the parties should the case be reclassified.
(Reply, pp. 2-3.)
 
 
            Analysis
 
The instant Motion to Reclassify
was filed after the time to amend the Complaint. Thus, Plaintiff must show that
the amount in controversy exceeds the jurisdiction of this Court and good cause
for the timing of the Motion. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 403.040, subd. (b).) 
 
As to the amount in controversy, Plaintiff
relies on Plaintiff counsel’s declaration and Plaintiff’s medical records to
support the claim that the amount in controversy exceeds the jurisdiction of
this Court. (Feldman Decl.; Exh. B.) Plaintiff’s counsel states
Plaintiff’s orthopedic surgeon recommends bilateral knee surgery from the
subject accident costing about $250,000. (Feldman Decl., ¶ 5.) Dated August 12, 2021, Plaintiff’s medical
records from Michael d. Smith, M.D., an Orthopaedic Surgeon, state that “based
upon the patient’s subjective complaints and objective findings on physical
examination, as well as the results of the CT scans, it is within reasonable
medical probability [Plaintiff] will require right and/or left total knee
replacement surgery in the future.” (Exh. B, p. 7.) Plaintiff’s medical records
then list the costs associated with a total knee replacement, which total to be
approximately $107,460 to $117,460 per knee replacement. (Exh. B, pp. 7-8.) 
 
After reviewing
the record, the Court
finds Plaintiff has demonstrated an Award of over $35,000 is obtainable. (Ytuarte, supra, 129 Cal.App.4th
at pp. 277-279.) Plaintiff presents evidence by way of Plaintiff’s
counsel’s declaration and Plaintiff’s medical records that her projected future
medical costs far exceed $35,000.  Plaintiff need only demonstrate the
possibility that a $35,000 award is attainable under Ytuarte; in this
action, Plaintiff has presented sufficient evidence for the Court to find such
an award is possible. (Id., at pp. 277, 279.)
 
The Court
reminds the parties that jurisdiction may be defeated only if “it appears to a legal
certainty that plaintiff cannot recover the amount [of the] deman[d].”
(Maldonado v. Superior Court (1996) 45 Cal.App.4th 397, 401, emphasis in
original.) Here, it does not appear, to legal certainty, that Plaintiff cannot
recover more than $35,000.00.  
 
Plaintiff also
has shown good cause for the timing of this Motion. In Plaintiff’s counsel’s meet
and confer correspondence with Defendant’s counsel, Plaintiff’s counsel states:
“[P]ls advise by tmrw at 5pm if defense will stipulate to reclassify this
action to unlimited jurisdiction, or if not, why def so claims[.] [U]nfortunately,
the atty of record law office of howard choi appears to have filed this
action in limited court looking only at the past meds, not the futures.”
(Exh. A, emphasis added; Feldman
Decl., ¶ 4; Motion, p. 3.) The Court finds this note and Plaintiff’s
change in counsel satisfactorily demonstrates Plaintiff’s delay in raising this
issue and is sufficient good cause for the timing of this Motion. (Exh. A.) Moreover, reclassification is
appropriate if “during the course of
pretrial litigation, it becomes clear that the matter will ‘necessarily’
result in a verdict” above the limited jurisdictional amount, and “the court
affords the parties an opportunity to contest transfer.” (Walker, supra, 53 Cal.3d at p. 262, emphasis added.)
 
Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s Motion is GRANTED.
