And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Del Rosario, et al. v. Velasquez. The case involves a petition for approval of a compromise of a minor's claim, which was initially denied due to several deficiencies. The petition was updated and resubmitted, but the judge still found several deficiencies, including a lack of attachment describing the terms of the settlement, unclear total medical expenses, and discrepancies in the totals listed in the petition.

The judge has continued the hearing to January 27, 2025, and ordered the petitioner to file supplemental papers addressing the deficiencies at least 16 court days before the next scheduled hearing. Failure to do so may result in the petition being placed off calendar or denied. The judge has also ordered the petitioner to give notice.

The judge's tentative ruling is based on California Code of Civil Procedure, section 372, California Rules of Court, rule 7.950, and California Probate Code, section 3505, which require court approval of settlements of a minor's claim. The judge has also cited relevant case law, including Pearson v. Superior Court (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th 1333 and Barnes v. Western Heritage Ins. Co. (2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 249.
