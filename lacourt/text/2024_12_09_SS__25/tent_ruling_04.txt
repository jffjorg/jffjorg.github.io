ANALYSIS:
 
I.                   
Background
 
            On
June 1, 2021, minor Aayden Del Rosario (“minor Plaintiff”) was in a vehicle with
his father, Petitioner Andrew Del Rosario (“Petitioner”), when their vehicle
and Defendant Samuel Velasquez’s (“Defendant”) vehicle collided.  (Compl., ¶¶ 7-8.) Minor Plaintiff sustained
injuries as a result of the accident. (Compl., ¶ 9.) 
 
            On
April 3, 2023, Petitioner and minor Plaintiff filed this action against
Defendant and Does 1-10, alleging a Negligence cause of action. (Compl., p. 1.)

 
            On
May 3, 2023, Petitioner was appointed Guardian Ad Litem for Minor Plaintiff.
(5/3/23 Application and Order for Appointment of Guardian Ad Litem.) 
 
            On
June 14, 2024, the Court denied Petitioner’s Expedited Petition for Minor’s
Compromise without prejudice, filed on June 10, 2024, due to several
deficiencies. (6/14/24 Order.) 
 
            On
September 19, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel filed a Notice of Settlement of Entire
Case. (9/29/24 Notice.) 
 
            On
September 20, 2024, the Court set a hearing for the instant Expedited Petition
for Minor’s Compromise (“Expedited Petition”), filed on June 28, 2024, due to
several deficiencies in the Expedited Petition. 
(9/20/24 Order.)
 
            On
October 29, 2024, the Court continued the hearing on the Expedited Petition due
to the Court’s unavailability. (10/29/24 Order & Certificate.) 
 
            On
November 12 and 13, 2024, Petitioner filed an updated Expedited Petition, Proposed
Order, and Proposed Order to Deposit Funds in Blocked Account.
 
II.                
Legal
Standard & Discussion 
 
            Court approval is required for all settlements of a minor’s
claim. (Prob. Code, §§ 3500, 3600, et
seq.; Code Civ. Proc., § 372.) “ ‘[W]ithout trial court approval of the
proposed compromise of the ward’s claim, the settlement cannot be valid.  [Citation.] [¶] Nor is the settlement binding
[on the minor] until it is endorsed by the trial court.’ ” (Pearson v. Superior Court (2012) 202
Cal.App.4th 1333, 1338.) A minor, like Claimant, “shall appear either by a
guardian or conservator of the estate or by a guardian ad litem appointed by
the court in which the action or proceeding is pending, or by a judge thereof,
in each case.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 372, subd. (a)(1).) Alternatively, the
petitioner may file a declaration demonstrating that he or she has a right to
compromise the minor’s claim under California Probate Code section 3500. 
 
            Regarding the substance of the
Petition, to obtain court approval of the settlement of a minor’s claims, the
petitioner must file a “verified petition for approval of the settlement and
must disclose ‘all information that has any bearing upon the reasonableness of
the compromise.’ ” (Barnes v. Western
Heritage Ins. Co. (2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 249, 256, fn. 4, citing Cal. Rules
of Court, rule 7.950.)  
 
            Here, the Court previously ruled on
the Expedited Petition and found it to be incomplete. (9/20/24 Order.) The
Expedited Petition was set for hearing, and Petitioner was ordered to address
the following deficiencies: 
 
(1)  
Petitioner
had not listed the net balance of proceeds remaining for Minor Plaintiff in ¶
16 of MC-350EX. 
(2)  
Petitioner
listed statutory or contractual liens in the amount of $1,712 in medical
expenses; however, medical expenses are calculated as $776.83. (MC-350EX ¶ 13a(5).)

 
(9/20/24
Order.)
 
On November
12 and 13, 2024, Petitioner filed an updated Expedited Petition that states the
net balance of proceeds remaining for Minor Plaintiff is $1,094.03 (MC-350EX, ¶
16) and medical expenses are calculated as $776.83. (MC-350EX ¶ 13a(5).) 
 
            While
some of the issues were resolved, the Court finds the following deficiencies in
the updated Expedited Petition remain:
 
            -¶
11(c): There is no attachment describing the terms of the settlement. 
            -¶
13(a): It is unclear the basis for the total medical expenses amount of $1,712,
as attachments to ¶ 13(a)1 and ¶ 12(g) seem to indicate the total medical
expenses amount are $1,500.
            -¶
14(b): There are no items or amounts listed in conjunction with each of the six
presented payee lines. Further, the costs in Attachment 14b only total $979.14,
which differs from the $1,129.14 total amount listed on ¶ 14(b). This
discrepancy then also impacts the totals in ¶¶ 16, 17 and 19(b)(2).  
 
Accordingly, the Expedited Petition is
CONTINUED. 
 
III.

to Probate Code section 3505, hearing on the Expedited Petition is CONTINUED TO JANUARY 27, 2025 at 10:00 a.m. in Department 25 at the SPRING STREET
