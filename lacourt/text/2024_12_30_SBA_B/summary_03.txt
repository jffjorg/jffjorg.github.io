And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Infinity Select Insurance Company's motion to intervene in the lawsuit between Chaucer Syndicate at Lloyd's No. 1084 and Porter Run, Inc. Infinity Select is the insurer of Porter Run, Inc., which has been suspended as a corporation and is unable to defend itself in the lawsuit. As a result, Infinity Select may become liable for any judgment rendered against Porter Run, Inc. and has a sufficient interest in the lawsuit to intervene. The judge found that Infinity Select may properly intervene in the case to avoid harm to the insurer. The motion is granted, and Infinity Select is ordered to file its proposed Answer-in-Intervention within 10 days of receiving the order.
