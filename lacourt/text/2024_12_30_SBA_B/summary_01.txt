And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for award of attorney's fees and costs brought by Plaintiff Theodor Cohen against Defendant Lester Pioch. The case arises from a breach of contract based on a promissory note. Plaintiff seeks to recover attorney's fees in the amount of $54,242.50 and costs in the amount of $8,507.11. The judge finds that Plaintiff is entitled to an award of attorney's fees as the prevailing party on a contract claim that includes an attorney's fees provision. The judge calculates the reasonable attorney's fees using the "lodestar" method, which takes into account the number of hours reasonably expended and the reasonable hourly rate. The judge also finds that the costs sought are authorized by statute or are appropriately incurred in the litigation. The judge grants the request for attorney's fees and costs and orders Plaintiff to give notice of the order.
