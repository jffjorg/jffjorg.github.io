  Case Number:  23TRCV03586    Hearing Date:   December 30, 2024    Dept:  B Theordore Cohen v. Lester Pioch
Case No. 23TRCV03586
Motion for Award of Attorney’s Fees – Contract
Plaintiff prevailed on a motion for summary judgment
and now brings this motion seeking an award of attorney’s fees pursuant to
contract.  This action arises out of a complaint
for breach of contract based upon a promissory note.  Plaintiff seeks to recover attorney’s fees in
the amount of $54,242.50.  No opposition
has been filed.
Plaintiff is entitled to an award of attorney’s fees
as he is the prevailing party on a contract claim which includes an attorney’s
fees provision.  The Note provides:
“The Debtors agree to pay
all costs, charges and expenses incurred by the Holder
and/or its as assignees (including, without limitations, costs of collection,
court costs, and reasonable attorneys’ fees and disbursements) in connection
with the enforcement of the Holder’s rights under this Note (all such
costs, charges and expenses being herein referred to as “Costs”).
The basic rule of law
governing the manner in which attorney’s fees are to be awarded pursuant to
contract is relatively straight forward.
“In determining
the amount of reasonable attorney fees to be awarded under a statutory attorney
fees provision, the trial court begins by calculating the “lodestar”
amount.  (Ketchum, supra, 24
Cal.4th at p. 1131, 104 Cal.Rptr.2d 377, 17 P.3d 735; Meister v. Regents of
University of California (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 437, 448–449, 78 Cal.Rptr.2d
913 (Meister).)  The “lodestar” is
“the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly
rate.”  (PLCM Group, Inc. v. Drexler
(2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095, 95 Cal.Rptr.2d 198, 997 P.2d 511.)  To determine the reasonable hourly rate, the
court looks to the “hourly rate prevailing in the community for similar
work.”  (Ibid.)  Using the lodestar as the basis for the
attorney fee award “anchors the trial court’s analysis to an objective
determination of the value of an attorney’s services, ensuring that the amount
awarded is not arbitrary.  [Citation.].”
(Ibid.)
The California
Supreme Court has further instructed that attorney fee awards “should be fully
compensatory.”  (Ketchum, supra,
24 Cal.4th at p. 1133, 104 Cal.Rptr.2d 377, 17 P.3d 735.)  Thus, in the absence of “circumstances
rendering an award unjust, an attorney fee award should ordinarily include
compensation for all of the hours reasonably spent, including
those relating solely to the fee. 
[Citation.]”  (Ibid.)  However, “[a] fee request that appears
unreasonably inflated is a special circumstance permitting the trial court to
reduce the award or deny one altogether.” 
(Serrano v. Unruh (1982) 32 Cal.3d 621, 635, 186 Cal.Rptr. 754,
652 P.2d 985.)
As this court has
previously observed, “California courts have long held that trial courts have
broad discretion in determining the amount of a reasonable attorney’s fee
award.  This determination is necessarily
ad hoc and must be resolved on the particular circumstances of each
case.”  (Meister, supra, 67
Cal.App.4th at p. 452, 78 Cal.Rptr.2d 913.) 
In exercising its discretion, the trial court may accordingly “consider
all of the facts and the entire procedural history of the case in setting the
amount of a reasonable attorney’s fee award.” 
(Ibid.)  An attorney fees
award “‘will not be overturned in the absence of a manifest abuse of
discretion, a prejudicial error of law, or necessary findings not supported by
substantial evidence.  [Citations.]’
[Citation.]”  (Blickman Turkus, LP v.
MF Downtown Sunnyvale, LLC (2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 858, 894, 76 Cal.Rptr.3d
325.)
In reviewing the
trial court’s exercise of its discretion, we also recognize that “[t]he
‘experienced trial judge is the best judge of the value of professional
services rendered in his [or her] court, and while his [or her] judgment is of
course subject to review, it will not be disturbed unless the appellate court
is convinced that it is clearly wrong.’” 
(Serrano v. Priest (1977) 20 Cal.3d 25, 49, 141 Cal.Rptr. 315,
569 P.2d 1303.)”  Bernardi v. County of Monterey (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 1379, 1393-94
[84 Cal.Rptr.3d 754, 765-66]
The Court has reviewed
the hourly rates claimed by Plaintiff in the Declarations filed to support the
requested fees.  The rates are
reasonable.  As the Court that has
handled this action, the Court is familiar with the efforts that were
undertaken in the prosecution of this action by Plaintiff.  The Court has evaluated the work performed in
the case, and the hours are reasonable.
The Court finds that the
attorneys fee sought in the amount of $54,242.50 is a reasonable attorney’s fee.
Plaintiff also seeks an
award of costs in the amount of $8,507.11 pursuant to the Memorandum of Costs
filed December 3, 2024.  No motion to tax
costs has been filed.
The Note authorizes the
award of “all costs, charges and expenses incurred by the Holder and… in
connection with the enforcement of the Holder’s rights under this Note.”  The Court finds that the “costs” sought are
either authorized by statute or are appropriately incurred in this litigation.  The request for an award of costs in the
amount of $8,507.11 is GRANTED.
ORDER
1. Plaintiff is awarded
attorneys fees in the amount of $54,242.50.
2. Plaintiff is awarded
costs as noted in the Mrmorandum of Costs filed December 3, 2024 in the amount
of $8,507.11.
3. Plaintiff shall give
notice of this Order.
