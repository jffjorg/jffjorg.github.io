Here is the English text to summarize this judge's tentative ruling:

The Court has reviewed the documents related to this motion and will not decide the motion on the merits at this time. The Court orders the parties to meet and confer directly, not by email or letter. Additionally, the parties are ordered to file a joint statement of remaining issues by a date to be set by the Court. The joint statement should briefly describe the matters in dispute, followed by the Plaintiff's arguments, then the Defendant's arguments. Prior to meeting and conferring and preparing their joint statement, the parties should refer to the Court's Lemon Law discovery order posted online.
