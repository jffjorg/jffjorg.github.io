SUMMARY OF
ACTION
Plaintiff
Albert Dib (Plaintiff) sued Defendants Habibollah Elahinejad and LA Home
Improvement, Inc. (Defendants) for a breach of lease. After a bench trial,
Plaintiff prevailed on his breach of lease claim. Judgment was entered in
Plaintiff’s favor on January 12, 2024, and Plaintiff was awarded $472,096.00 in
damages.
 
A provision of
the lease agreement between Plaintiff and Defendants allows Plaintiff to
recover attorney fees if he needed to bring an action to enforce the terms of
the lease agreement. (Stepanski Decl., ¶ 3, Ex. 1.) Because of this provision,
Plaintiff filed this motion for attorney fees pursuant to Civ. Code § 1717 on
January 18, 2024.
 
Plaintiff is
requesting $181,650.00 in attorney fees from Defendants. Plaintiffs argue in
their motion that the attorney fees and hourly rates are reasonable. Plaintiff’s
only evidence in support of his motion for attorney fees is a declaration from
his attorney, Lisa A. Stepanski. (Stepanski Decl., ¶¶ 6-8.)
 
Ms. Stepanski’s
hourly rate for trial, court appearances, settlement conferences, and
depositions was $350, and she represents that she charged Plaintiff 71.1 hours
at $350 an hour for a total of $24,885. (Stepanski Decl., ¶ 6.) She charged
Plaintiff $225 an hour for 513.2 hours of drafting motions and opposition, the
FAC and SAC, propounding and responding to written discovery, deposition
preparations and trial preparation, for a total of $115,470. (Stepanski Decl.,
¶ 7.) Finally, she charged Plaintiff $150.00 an hour for 275 hours to gather
and produce documents, review documents, communications, and research, for a
total of $41,250. (Stepanski Decl., ¶ 8.)
 
The total hours
spent on the case was 859.3 hours. When adding these together, the total
lodestar amount is $181,605. This is different from the $181,650 that Plaintiff
is requesting. It is unknown where the extra $45 comes from, unless Plaintiff
just transposed the numbers.
 
Defendants
filed their opposition late on June 3, 2024. However, the Court will consider
Defendants’ opposition, despite the late filing.
 
Defendants
argue in their opposition that Plaintiff’s attorney has not sufficiently
documented the reasonableness of her request. She has attached no billing
statements to the motion. Instead, the entirety of Plaintiff’s request for
attorney fees is based on his attorney’s declaration. Defendants also argue
that Plaintiff has not provided sufficient detail of her billing under the
circumstances.
 
Plaintiff
argues in his reply that his attorney’s declaration is sufficient and further
detail is not required. Plaintiff also argues that the record allows for the Court
to value the attorney fees awarded to Plaintiff at the requested amount.
 
ANALYSIS
A prevailing
party is entitled to recover its attorneys’ fees when authorized by contract,
statute, or law. (See CCP § 1033.5(a)(10); Civ. Code § 1717(a).) “A
successful party means a prevailing party, and [a party] may be considered
prevailing parties for attorney’s fees purposes if they succeed on any
significant issue in litigation which achieves some of the benefit the parties
sought in bringing suit.” (Bowman v. City of Berkeley (2005) 131
Cal.App.4th 173, 178.)
 
Plaintiff is
the prevailing party because Plaintiff prevailed on his breach of lease action.
Therefore, Plaintiff can recover attorney fees pursuant to Civ. Code § 1717.
 
In determining
the reasonableness of fees, courts look to the factors from Church of
Scientology v. Wollersheim (1996) 42 Cal.App.4th 628, disapproved on other
grounds by Equilon Enters. v. Consumer Cause, Inc. (2002) 29 Cal.4th 53,
68 n.5. The factors from Wollersheim are (1) the amount of money
involved in the litigation; (2) the nature of the litigation and its difficulty
and the intricacies and importance of the litigation; (3) the skill required
and employed in handling the litigation, the necessity for skilled legal
training and ability in trying the case, and counsel’s education and experience
in the particular type of work involved; (4) the attention given to the case; (5)
the success of the attorneys efforts; and (6) the time consumed by the
litigation. (Id.)
 
Defendants
argue in their opposition that there is no way to determine whether Plaintiff’s
requested fees are reasonable because Plaintiff has not provided billing
records or any other detailed breakdown of the requested costs. Plaintiff’s
attorney has provided a declaration that states how many hours were spent on
broad categories of work, such as trial, drafting motions, and communications. 
 
Plaintiff
argues in his reply that detailed billing records are not necessary and that
the declaration of his attorney is sufficient. Plaintiff cites Raining Data
Corp. v. Barrenechea (2009) 175 Cal.App.5th 1363, which states that “The
law is clear, however, that an award of attorney fees may be based on counsel’s
declarations, without production of detailed time records. (See Bernardi v.
County of Monterey (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 1379, 1398, 84 Cal.Rptr.3d 754;
Weber v. Langholz (1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 1578, 1587, 46 Cal.Rptr.2d 677.)
Raining Data’s attorneys provided declarations detailing their experience and
expertise supporting their billing rates, and explained the work provided to
Raining Data. Barrenechea did not offer any evidence to challenge any statement
in Raining Data’s counsel’s declarations.” (Id. at 1375.) 
 
Weber,
the case cited by Raining Data, states the following: “Plaintiff
complains that counsel did not state the total number of hours nor substantiate
the hours or amounts with copies of time records or copies of billing
statements. Counsel’s declaration and verified cost memorandum were, however,
made under penalty of perjury. Mathematical calculation could show the number
of hours was between 90 and 103. The work done was described. The trial court
could make its own evaluation of the reasonable worth of the work done in light
of the nature of the case, and of the credibility of counsel’s declaration
unsubstantiated by time records and billing statements. Although a fee request
ordinarily should be documented in great detail, it cannot be said in this
particular case that the absence of time records and billing statements
deprived the trial court of substantial evidence to support an award; we do not
reweigh the evidence.” (Weber, 39 Cal.App.4th at 1587.)
 
The Court
interprets this paragraph from Weber to mean that whether an attorney’s
declaration is sufficient to detail the fees incurred rests in the trial
court’s sound discretion. The statements in the declaration of Plaintiff’s
attorney do not provide substantial evidence to support the requested reward.
While the case did go on for four years, 513.2 hours spent drafting motions,
complaints, and responding to discovery appears quite excessive. The Court
would like to see a further breakdown of this time spent before the Court grants
Plaintiff’s motion in the requested amount. Looking at the history of this
case, there were very few motions filed. If there were any discovery disputes,
they did not come before the Court. The 275 hours that Plaintiff’s attorney
claims that she spent to “gather and produce documents in this action, review
documents produced by others, communications and legal research” also appears
excessive.
 
For a request for attorney fees of over
$181,600, the Court would like more detail before it grants Plaintiff’s motion.
This is a large amount of fees, and the Court does not want to grant it based
on the broad strokes description given in Plaintiff’s attorney’s declaration.
Further detail is needed before the Court can determine the reasonableness of
the requested amount.
 
Plaintiffs’
motion for attorney fees is denied without prejudice.
