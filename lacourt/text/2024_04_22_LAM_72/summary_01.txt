And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Tracfone Wireless, Inc.'s motion to set aside the default that was entered against it on March 27, 2024. The default was entered because Tracfone failed to respond to the complaint filed by Jaston Archie on February 21, 2024. Tracfone's attorney made a mistake and did not file a timely answer to the complaint. The judge has granted the motion because Tracfone's attorney's mistake was excusable and the motion was filed within the six-month window allowed by law. The judge has ordered Tracfone to respond to the complaint within 10 days.
