COUNSEL TO NOTICE.
 
The Court considers the moving papers.
No opposition has been received.
 
The Court may issue an order allowing
an attorney to withdraw from representation, after notice to the client.  (CCP § 284.) 
The attorney may withdraw from representation when the withdrawal would
not result in undue prejudice to the client’s interest—that is, counsel cannot
withdraw at a critical point in the litigation. 
(Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal. App. 4th 904, 915; see
California Rule of Professional Conduct 3-700.) 
 
Jasmine J. Badawi, counsel of record
for Plaintiff Marcelo Rodriguez, seeks to withdraw from representation of Plaintiff.
Counsel states that the attorney-client relationship has deteriorated, and
counsel has lost contact with Plaintiff. Trial is not set, and no prejudice
will result from counsel’s withdrawal. Counsel has complied with CRC 3.1362. 
 
There is good cause for counsel’s
withdrawal. The motion is GRANTED.
