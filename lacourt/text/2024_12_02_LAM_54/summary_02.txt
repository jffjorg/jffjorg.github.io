And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer to the First Amended Complaint and the Motion to Strike. The Court has overruled the demurrer to the fifth and sixth causes of action for Unruh violations and disability discrimination, respectively, finding that they are not barred by collateral estoppel/issue preclusion.

The Court has also overruled the demurrer to the second cause of action for harassment, finding that the allegations of harassment are sufficient. Additionally, the Court has overruled the demurrer to the fourth cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress, finding that the allegations of extreme and outrageous conduct are sufficient.

The Court has overruled the demurrer to the ninth cause of action for breach of contract, finding that the allegations of breach of contract are sufficient. The Court has denied the Motion to Strike the prayers for punitive damages, finding that the allegations of oppression, fraud, or malice are sufficient to support a claim for punitive damages.

The Court has ordered Defendant to file and serve an answer to the First Amended Complaint within 30 days of notice of the ruling. If the parties wish to submit on the tentative ruling, they must email the courtroom by 8:00 am on the day of the hearing.
