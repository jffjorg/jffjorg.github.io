And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted a motion filed by Jasmine J. Badawi, counsel for plaintiff Marcelo Rodriguez, to be relieved from her representation of the plaintiff. The judge has found that there is good cause for the withdrawal, as the attorney-client relationship has deteriorated and the counsel has lost contact with the plaintiff. Since trial is not set and no prejudice will result from the withdrawal, the judge has granted the motion. The counsel must file proof of service of the order on the plaintiff within 5 days of notice of the ruling, and will be relieved from her representation upon filing of the proof of service of the order.
