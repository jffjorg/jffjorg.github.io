And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer to the Second Amended Complaint filed by the plaintiffs against the defendants. The defendants, John C. McManus and Patricia A. McManus, as trustees of the John C. McManus and Patricia A. McManus Living Trust, dated July 4, 1996, have demurred to the complaint, arguing that it failed to plead sufficient facts to support the elements of duty and causation.

The judge has sustained the demurrer without leave to amend, meaning that the plaintiffs will not be able to re-file their complaint with additional facts to support their claims. The judge has also granted the defendants' request for judicial notice of certain documents, but only as to the existence of the documents, not as to any facts in dispute or hearsay.

The judge has also found that the defendants owed no duty to the plaintiffs and that the allegations in the complaint are insufficient to support a claim of negligence. The judge has ordered that the demurrer be sustained and that the motion to strike be dismissed as moot.
