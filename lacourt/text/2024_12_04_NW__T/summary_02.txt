The Judge also grants the plaintiff's motion to establish that statements by dealership personnel are not hearsay and admissible.

* Evidence of other similar incidents

The Judge grants the defendant's motions to exclude:

* Mention of one time complaints
* Evidence of other similar incidents
* Reference to the Golden Rule or reptile arguments
