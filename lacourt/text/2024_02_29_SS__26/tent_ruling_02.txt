ANALYSIS:  
 
Judgment Creditor Nextgear Capital, Inc. (“Judgment
Creditor”) filed the instant application for entry of sister state judgment on
July 20, 2020. Judgment was entered on that date against Hamlet Rubenovich
Movsisyan d/b/a Greenway Auto Mart and Ruben Movsisyan (“Judgment Debtors”) in
the amount of $14,785.46. (Judgment, 07/27/22.) 
 
 Judgment Creditor
filed the instant Motion to Amend Judgment on February 7, 2024. To date, no
opposition has been filed.  
 
Discussion
 
The Motion is brought pursuant to
Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (d), which provides that the
court may “correct clerical mistakes in its judgments or orders as entered, so
as to conform to the judgment or order directed . . . .” (Code Civ. Proc., §
473, subd. (d).) The application for entry of sister state judgment reflects
the correct judgment amount of $10,938.46 principal, $3,236.76 interest, and
$370.00, for a total judgment of $14,545.22. (App., filed 07/20/23, ¶5.) The
judgment entered by the clerk, however, states that the unpaid amount of the
judgment is $14,785.46, plus costs and interest, for a total of $18,392.22.
(Judgment, 07/27/23.) 
 
The request to correct the clerical
error is hereby granted pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 473,
subdivision (d). Judgment Creditor has submitted a proposed amended judgment
within ten (10) days of this order.
