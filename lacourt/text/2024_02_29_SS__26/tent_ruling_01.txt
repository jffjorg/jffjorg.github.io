Examination and Judicial Notice Pursuant to Evidence Code section 452 is GRANTED
SOLELY AS TO IN CAMERA REVIEW OF THE CONFIDENTIAL MARRIAGE LICENSE OF JUDGMENT

ANALYSIS:
 
Judgment Creditor Andrew Krain (“Judgment Creditor”), in pro
per, filed the instant action for fraud against Alina Grygoryshyna (“Judgment
Debtor”), also in pro per, on July 6, 2020. Following Judgment Debtor’s failure
to appear, the Court entered default judgment in Judgment Creditor’s favor on
January 4, 2021. On December 14, 2023, the Court ruled on Judgment Creditor’s
Motion to Compel Third Party Production of Documents and ordered the County
Clerk to promptly make a copy of the confidential marriage license of Judgment
Debtor Alina Grygoryshyna and Sammy Hakim available to Judgment Creditor.
(Minute Order, 12/14/23, p. 1.) 
 
On February 5, 2024, Judgment Creditor filed the instant
Motion for In Camera Examination and Judicial Notice Pursuant to Evidence Code
section 452. No opposition has been filed to date. However, the Motion is not accompanied by a proof of
service demonstrating service of the moving papers and notice of the hearing
date on Judgment Debtor. A proof of service was filed concurrently with this
Motion on February 5, 2024 but it does not state what papers were served.
(Proof of Service, filed 02/05/24, ¶4 and p. 3.) 
 
Regarding the
merits, Judgment Creditor asks the Court to conduct an in camera
examination and take judicial notice of the (1) certified copy of Judgment
Debtor’s Confidential License and Certificate of Marriage; (2) copies of
Judgment Debtor’s bank account statements produced by Bank of America, N.A.;
(3) copies of Judgment Debtor’s bank account statements produced by Wells Fargo
Bank, N.A.; (4) copies of Judgment Debtor’s credit applications produced by
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Bank of America, N.A. and Tesla, Inc.; and (5)
copies of the deposit slips produced by Bank of America, N.A. that show checks
from S2 Properties, LLC being deposited to Judgement Debtor’s accounts.
 
Judgment Creditor further requests that the Court (1) order
the clerk to release copies of said Judgment Debtor’s bank account statements
produced by Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.; (2) continue adjudication of the Motion to
Compel Third Parties to Produce Documents currently set for hearing on March
14, 2023; (3) Review Judgement Debtor’s eligibility for the court fee waiver
and services of a Public Defender; and (4) award all other and further relief
as the Court may deem just and proper.
 
In camera review “is
routinely used when a judicial decision concerns information claimed to be
covered by some rule of confidentiality or privilege.” (Pack v. Kings County
Human Services Agency (2001) 89 Cal.App.4th 821, 837.) Pursuant to this
rule, in camera review of the confidential marriage license of Judgment
Debtor Alina Grygoryshyna and Sammy Hakim is appropriate. Following the in
camera review, the Court will make a determination regarding whether judicial
notice of the marriage is appropriate pursuant to Evidence Code section 452. 
 
However, Judgment Creditor’s request for in camera review of
Judgment Debtor’s bank records and credit applications is not supported by a
showing of some rule of confidentiality
or privilege. The extent to which these financial documents will be placed in
the public record or their contents are subject to judicial notice is not
explained. Nor is any analysis provided as to why the Court should grant
Judgment Creditor’s remaining requests to (1) order the clerk to release
copies of said Judgment Debtor’s bank account statements produced by Wells
Fargo Bank, N.A.; (2) continue adjudication of the Motion to Compel Third
Parties to Produce Documents currently set for hearing on March 14, 2023; (3)
Review Judgement Debtor’s eligibility for the court fee waiver and services of
a Public Defender; and (4) award all other and further relief as the Court may
deem just and proper.
 
Conclusion
 
Therefore, Judgment
Creditor Andrew Krain’s Motion for In Camera Examination and Judicial Notice
Pursuant to Evidence Code section 452 is GRANTED SOLELY AS TO IN CAMERA REVIEW
OF THE CONFIDENTIAL MARRIAGE LICENSE OF JUDGMENT DEBTOR ALINA GRYGORYSHYNA AND
SAMMY HAKIM. JUDICIAL NOTICE OF THE CONFIDENTIAL MARRIAGE LICENSE WILL BE
DETERMINED FOLLOWING IN CAMERA REVIEW. THE MOTION IS DENIED AS TO THE REMAINING
REQUESTS.
