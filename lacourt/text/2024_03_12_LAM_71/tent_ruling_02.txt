Background 
          This matter involves Plaintiff’s negotiation of a long-term
lease with Non-Party Robert Ohanian (“Ohanian”) regarding real property located
at 631 Caleb Street, Glendale, CA 90212 (“Property”).  (Complaint ¶11.)  Plaintiff alleges Ohanian, at various times, has
purported to be Defendant Hrayr Brian Der Vartanian’s (“Der Vartanian”)
(“Defendant”) property manager, business partner, general contractor, and co-owner
of the Property.  (Complaint ¶12.)  Plaintiff alleges Hovsepian is Der Vartanian’s
counsel.  (See Complaint ¶220.)
Plaintiff filed his operative
Complaint against Defendants Hasti Rahsepar (“Rahsepar”), HDR Law Group, Inc.
(“HDR”), Hovsepian, and Der Vartanian (collectively, “Defendants”) on December
5, 2023, alleging eighteen causes of action: (1) malicious prosecution [against
Der Vartanian, Rahsepar, and HDR]; (2) abuse of process [against all
Defendants]; (3) intentional infliction of emotional distress [against
Der Vartanian]; (4) breach of contract [against Der Vartanian];
(5) breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing [against
Der Vartanian]; (6) breach of the implied warranty of habitability [against
Der Vartanian]; (7) breach of the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment [against
Der Vartanian]; (8) tenant harassment and retaliation [against Der
Vartanian]; (9) negligence [against Der Vartanian]; (10)
fraud in the inducement [against Der Vartanian]; (11) concealment
[against Der Vartanian]; (12) false promise [against Der
Vartanian]; (13) intentional misrepresentation (fraud) [against Der
Vartanian]; (14) negligent misrepresentation [against Der
Vartanian]; (15) intrusion into private affairs [against Der
Vartanian]; (16) violation of Los Angeles County Tenant Protections
Resolution [against Der Vartanian]; (17) violation of Glendale
Rental Rights Program [against Der Vartanian]; and (18) Unfair
Competition, Business & Professions Code §17200 [against Der
Vartanian].  (See Complaint.) 
On February 13, 2024, Hovsepian
filed the instant motion.  On March 4,
2024, Plaintiff filed his opposition.  On
March 5, 2024, Hovsepian filed his reply. 

On March 6, 2024, Plaintiff
filed a notice of partial settlement of all claims as to HDR and Rahsepar (collectively,
“Settling Defendants”).[1]
Hovsepian objects to
Plaintiff’s opposition as untimely on the basis the filing was due to be filed
and served no later than February 28, 2024. 
The Court in its discretion will consider Plaintiff’s untimely
opposition.
 
Special Motion to Strike
          “Litigation of an anti-SLAPP motion involves a two-step
process. First, ‘the moving defendant bears the burden of establishing that the
challenged allegations or claims ‘aris[e] from’ protected activity in which the
defendant has engaged.’ [Citation.] Second, for each claim that does arise from
protected activity, the plaintiff must show the claim has “at least ‘minimal
merit.’ [Citation.]”  (Bonni v. St.
Joseph Health System (2021) 11 Cal.5th 995, 1009, citations omitted.)  As to the second step inquiry, a plaintiff
seeking to demonstrate the merit of the claim “may not rely solely on its
complaint, even if verified; instead, its proof must be made upon competent
admissible evidence.”  (Sweetwater Union High School District v.
Gilbane Building Co. (2019) 6 Cal.5th 931, 940, citations omitted.)
A defendant opposing a
special motion to strike has the burden to “state [] and substantiate [] a
legally sufficient claim.”  (Navellier
v. Sletten (2002) 29 Cal.4th 82, 88 & 93.)  “‘Put another way, the defendant “must
demonstrate that the complaint is both legally sufficient and supported by a
sufficient prima facie showing of facts to sustain a favorable judgment if the
evidence submitted by the defendant is credited.”’ [Citations.]”  (Id. at pgs. 88-89.)  To that end, the defendant must present
competent evidence, “that would be admissible at trial.”  (HMS Capital, Inc. v. Lawyers Title Co.
(2004) 118 Cal.App.4th 204, 212.)  “[D]eclarations
may not be based upon ‘information and belief’ [citation]” and documents
submitted without the proper foundation will not be considered.  (Id.) 
The complaint, even if verified, is insufficient to carry the plaintiff’s
shifted burden.  (Roberts v. Los
Angeles County Bar Association (2003) 105 Cal.App.4th 604, 614; Karnazes
v. Ares (2016) 244 Cal.App.4th 344, 354 [“pleadings do not constitute
evidence”]; see also Burke, Anti-SLAPP Litigation (The Rutter Group,
Civil Litigation Series 2018 §5:13) [“To satisfy prong two, the plaintiff must
submit admissible evidence that if credited is sufficient to sustain a
favorable judgment against the legal theories asserted by the defendant.”].)
 
Prong One: Arising from
Protected Activity
“A cause of action is subject
to a special motion to strike if the defendant shows that the cause of action
arises from an act in furtherance of the defendant’s constitutional right of
petition or free speech in connection with a public issue and the plaintiff
fails to demonstrate a probability of prevailing on the claim. [Citations.]”  (Digerati
Holdings, LLC v. Young Money Entertainment, LLC (2011) 194 Cal.App.4th 873,
883.) 
“An ‘act in furtherance of a
person’s right of petition or free speech under the United States or California
Constitution in connection with a public issue’ is defined by statute to
include ‘(1) any written or oral statement or writing made before a legislative,
executive, or judicial proceeding, or any other official proceeding authorized
by law, (2) any written or oral statement or writing made in connection with an
issue under consideration or review by a legislative, executive, or judicial
body, or any other official proceeding authorized by law, (3) any written or
oral statement or writing made in a place open to the public or a public forum
in connection with an issue of public interest, or (4) any other conduct in
furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of petition or the
constitutional right of free speech in connection with a public issue or an
issue of public interest.’  [Citation.]
If the defendant shows that the cause of action arises from a statement
described in clause (1) or (2) of section 425.16, subdivision (e), the defendant is not
required to separately demonstrate that the statement was made in connection
with a ‘public issue.’ [Citation.]”  (Id.)
“A cause of action is one
‘arising from’ protected activity within the meaning of section 425.16,
subdivision (b)(1) only if the defendant’s act on which the cause of action is
based was an act in furtherance of the defendant’s constitutional right of
petition or free speech in connection with a public issue. [Citation.] In
deciding whether the ‘arising from’ requirement is satisfied, ‘the court shall
consider the pleadings, and supporting and opposing affidavits stating the
facts upon which the liability or defense is based.’ [(C.C.P. §425.16(b)(2).)]
Whether the ‘arising from’ requirement is satisfied depends on the ‘gravamen or
principal thrust’ of the claim. [Citations.] A cause of action does not arise
from protected activity for purposes of the anti-SLAPP statute if the protected
activity is merely incidental to the cause of action. [Citations.]”  (Digerati
Holdings, LLC, 194
Cal.App.4th at pgs. 883-884,
citations omitted.)  To show that a claim
arises from protected activity under §425.16(b)(1), it is not sufficient to
show that the claim “was filed after, or because of, protected activity, or
when protected activity merely provides evidentiary support or context for the
claim.” (Rand Resources, LLC v. City of Carson (2019) 6 Cal.5th 610, 621.)
 “Rather, the protected activity must
‘supply elements of the challenged claim.’ [Citation.]”  (Id., citations omitted.)
“At the first step, the
moving defendant bears the burden of identifying all allegations of protected
activity, and the claims for relief supported by them. When relief is sought
based on allegations of both protected and unprotected activity, the
unprotected activity is disregarded at this stage.  If the court determines that relief is sought
based on allegations arising from activity protected by the statute, the second
step is reached. There, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to demonstrate that
each challenged claim based on protected activity is legally sufficient and
factually substantiated. The court, without resolving evidentiary conflicts,
must determine whether the plaintiff’s showing, if accepted by the trier of
fact, would be sufficient to sustain a favorable judgment. If not, the claim is
stricken. Allegations of protected activity supporting the stricken claim are
eliminated from the plaintiff, unless they also support a distinct claim on
which the plaintiff has shown a probability of prevailing.”  (Baral
v. Schnitt (2016) 1 Cal.5th 376, 396, emphasis added.)
The burden is on the
plaintiff to produce evidence that would be admissible at trial—i.e., to
proffer a prima facie showing of facts supporting a judgment in plaintiff’s
favor.  (Chavez v. Mendoza (2001)
94 Cal.App.4th 1083, 1087.)
Hovsepian argues Plaintiff’s singular
cause of action alleged against him for abuse of process is a claim of
malicious prosecution, and “[t]he plain language of the anti-SLAPP statute
dictates that every claim of malicious prosecution is a cause of action arising
from protected activity because every such claim necessarily depends upon
written and oral statements in a prior judicial proceeding.”  (Motion, pg. 7; Daniels v. Robbins (2010)
182 Cal.App.4th 204, 215.)
 
Statements or Writing Made in Connection
with an Issue Under Consideration or Review by a Judicial Body (C.C.P.
§425.16(e)(2))
Hovsepian met his burden to
show the single cause of action against him in Plaintiff’s Complaint arises
from an “act in furtherance of a person’s right of petition or free
speech under the United States or California Constitution in connection with a
public issue.”  (C.C.P. §§425.16(b), (e).)  
Plaintiff’s single cause of
action for abuse of process against Hovsepian is based on the following
allegations: “On
December 20, 2022, Defendants Der Vartanian and Hovsepian submitted false
declarations, later served and filed by Defendant Rahsepar of Defendant HDR Law
Group, attesting that they had never received the lease extension options” submitted
in opposition to Plaintiff’s summary judgment motion containing materially
false facts used to defeat summary judgment in Case No. 22PDUD01479 (Complaint
¶¶311, 313, Exh. JJ); “On January 3, 2022, based on the perjured declarations,
the Court found that there may be triable issues of material fact and summary
judgment was denied, forcing Plaintiff to prepare for trial” (Complaint ¶315);
“Throughout the litigation in the cases filed against Plaintiff, Defendants and
each of them exhibited abusive and improper litigation behavior and abused the
legal process in myriad ways” (Complaint ¶316); “On information and belief,
Defendant Hovsepian would have been liable for the tort of malicious
prosecution in filing and/or maintaining those actions, but for the short
statute of limitations applicable to attorneys for a malicious prosecution
claim” (Complaint ¶363); “Defendant Hovsepian abused the legal process and
actively and maliciously assisted Defendants Der Vartanian and Rahsepar in
maintaining Case No. 22PDUD01479 when it had no legal basis to proceed, by
signing and submitting to the Court a false and perjured declaration in
opposition to Plaintiff’s summary judgment motion in that action. Mr. Hovsepian
did so with malice, oppression and fraud” (Complaint ¶364); “Immediately after
being made aware of the perjured declaration from Defendant Raymond Hovsepian,
Plaintiff’s counsel wrote to Mr. Hovsepian directly, informing him that his
declaration was clearly perjured and false, and requested that Hovsepian
immediately correct the record. Plaintiffs’ counsel attached detailed evidence
that directly contradicted what was being falsely attested” (Complaint ¶365); “Mr.
Hovsepian never responded to that communication in any way” (Complaint ¶366); “Defendants
never withdrew their perjured declarations” (Complaint ¶370); “Defendants
intentionally submitted perjured declarations to commit fraud on the Court,
confuse the record, and to maliciously deprive Plaintiff of his due process
right to summary judgment in Case No. 22PDUD01479” (Complaint ¶371).
“The constitutional right to
petition, as we have seen, includes the basic act of filing litigation or
otherwise seeking administrative action.”  (Ludwig v. Superior Court (1995) 37
Cal.App.4th 8, 19.)  The right of
petition includes access to the courts.  (Briggs, 19 Cal.4th at pg. 1115 [“[j]ust
as communications preparatory to or in anticipation of the bringing of an
action or other official proceeding are within the protection of the litigation
privilege of Civil Code section 47, subdivision (b) . . . such statements are
equally entitled to the benefits of section 425.16.”].)  
Plaintiff’s abuse of process
cause of action is explicitly and solely predicated on a declaration filed by
Hovsepian in an Unlawful Detainer (“UD”) action to which he was not Der
Vartanian’s counsel.  (Reply, pg. 3;
Complaint ¶364, Exh. JJ.)  Hovsepian’s
filing of a declaration in a judicial proceeding is a protected activity under
the anti-SLAPP statute.  (See Neville
v. Chudacoff (2008) 160 Cal.App.4th 1255, 1266; Rohde v. Wolf (2007)
154 Cal.App.4th 28, 35.)  Therefore, Hovsepian
met his burden of demonstrating Plaintiff’s allegations in his Complaint for
damages against Hovsepian arises from protected activity.  
Plaintiff’s argument that
Hovsepian’s conduct is not protected under the anti-SLAPP statute because the
activity was illegal as a matter of law is unavailing.  The term “illegal” means criminal, rather
than merely violation of a statute or common law standard (as alleged in every
complaint).  (Mendoza v. ADP Screening
& Selection Services, Inc. (2010) 182 Cal.App.4th 1644, 1654 [stating even
if disclosure of information regarding registered sex offender to prospective
employer violated applicable statute, it was not criminal conduct beyond
protection of anti-SLAPP statute]; Bergstein v. Stroock & Stroock &
Lavan LLP (2015) 236 Cal.App.4th 793, 806-807; Dziubla v. Piazza
(2020) 59 Cal.App.5th 140, 150-151.)  If a
plaintiff claims that a defendant’s speech or petitioning activity is illegal
and thus not protected, “plaintiff bears the burden of conclusively proving
the illegal conduct”; a defendant need not prove its conduct was legal in
order to meet its burden under the first prong of the anti-SLAPP statute.  (Cross v. Cooper (2011) 197 Cal.App.4th
357, 385, emphasis added [“As in Flatley [v. Mauro (2006) 39
Cal.4th 299], the Paul [for Council v. Hanyecz (2001) 85
Cal.App.4th 1356] court emphasized the narrow circumstances in which a
defendant’s assertedly protected activity could be found to be illegal as a
matter of law. ‘In order to avoid any misunderstanding as to the basis for our
conclusions, we should make one further point. This case, as we have
emphasized, involves a factual context in which the defendants have effectively
conceded the illegal nature of their election campaign finance activities for
which they claim constitutional protection. Thus, there was no dispute on the
point and we have concluded, as a matter of law, that such activities are not a
valid exercise of constitutional rights as contemplated by section 425.16.
However, had there been a factual dispute as to the legality of defendants’
actions, then we could not so easily have disposed of defendants’ motion.
[¶] As we have noted, a defendant need only make a prima facie showing that
the plaintiff’s suit arises ‘from any act of [defendant] in furtherance of
[defendant’s] right of petition or free speech under the United States or
California Constitution in connection with a public issue.’ [Citation.] If
the plaintiff contests this point, and . . . cannot demonstrate as a matter of
law that the defendant’s acts do not fall under section 425.16’s protection,
then the claimed illegitimacy of defendant’s acts is an issue which plaintiff
must raise and support in the context of the discharge of plaintiff’s burden to
provide a prima facie showing of the merits of plaintiff’s case.”], emphasis
added.)  
Here, Plaintiff has not conclusively
demonstrated Hovsepian’s conduct alleged in the cause of action for abuse of
process was illegal, and Hovsepian has not effectively conceded that the
declaration he signed and submitted to the UD Court was false and perjured.  (See Cross, 197 Cal.App.4th at
pg. 385.)  Therefore, Hovsepian met his
burden to make a prima facie showing that the Plaintiff’s suit arises “from any
act of [defendant] in furtherance of [defendant’s] right of petition or free
speech under the United States or California Constitution in connection with a
public issue.”
The burden shifts to Plaintiff
to demonstrate a probability of prevailing on the cause of action against Hovsepian.  Plaintiff has not met his burden.
 
Prong
Two: Probability of Prevailing
A.   Abuse of Process
In order to establish a cause
of action for abuse of process, a plaintiff must demonstrate the following
elements: (l) the defendant used a legal procedure; (2) defendant intentionally
used this legal procedure for an improper purpose; (3) plaintiff was harmed;
and (4) defendant’s conduct was a substantial factor in causing plaintiff’s
harm.  (CACI 1520; Spellens v.
Spellens (1957) 49 Cal. 2d 210; Loomis v. Murphy (1990) 217 Cal.App.3d
589.)
Plaintiff failed to establish
a probability of prevailing on his cause of action for abuse of process.  
Assuming,
arguendo, that Plaintiff had met his burden of establishing the elements of his cause of action for abuse
of process, his allegation pertaining to Hovsepian’s declaration falls
within the litigation privilege, which is absolute and applies regardless of
malice.  (See Civ. Code §47(b)
[defining “privileged publication” as a communication made “in any (1)
legislative proceeding, (2) judicial proceeding, (3) in any other official
proceeding authorized by law, or (4) in the initiation or course of any other
proceeding authorized by law”]; Bergstein, 236 Cal.App.4th at pg. 814  [“the litigation privilege is absolute and
applies regardless of malice and has been given broad application”], internal
quotations and citations omitted; Cantu v. Resolution Trust Corp. (1992)
4 Cal.App.4th 857, 886 [“Cantu’s conclusory allegation that the defendants
knowingly filed an allegedly false and libelous declaration also fails to
satisfy the wilful act requirement. Statements made in the course of litigation
are subject to the privilege set forth in Civil Code section 47, subdivision
(2) (currently Civil Code § 47, subd. (b)) and cannot provide the basis for an
abuse of process action. (Silberg v. Anderson (1990) 50 Cal.3d 205, 212-215,
266 Cal.Rptr. 638, 786 P.2d 365; Kachig v. Boothe (1971) 22 Cal.App.3d
626, 99 Cal.Rptr. 393.”].)
Accordingly, Plaintiff failed
to establish a probability of prevailing on his cause of action against Hovsepian.
 
Conclusion
          Based on the foregoing, Hovsepian’s special motion to
strike Plaintiff’s cause of action for abuse of process against him is granted.  
Hovsepian may
separately move for an award of attorneys’ fees and costs.  
          Moving Party to give notice.
