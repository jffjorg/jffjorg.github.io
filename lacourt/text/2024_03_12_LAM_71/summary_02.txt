And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the special motion to strike the cause of action for abuse of process filed by the plaintiff against Raymond Hovsepian. The judge finds that the cause of action arises from protected activity, specifically the filing of a false and perjured declaration in an Unlawful Detainer action, which is a protected activity under the anti-SLAPP statute. The judge also finds that the plaintiff has not met the burden of demonstrating a probability of prevailing on the cause of action. Therefore, the motion to strike is granted, and Hovsepian may separately move for an award of attorneys' fees and costs.
