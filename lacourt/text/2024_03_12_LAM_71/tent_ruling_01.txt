Petitioners
Heng Li’s, Jie Li’s, and Nina Jiang’s unopposed petition to confirm the Consent
Award granted by Hon. Suzanne Brugera (Ret.) on January 25, 2021, is
granted.  Petitioners are to submit a
proposed judgment in ten days.  
 
          Petitioners
Heng Li, Jie Li, and Nina Jiang (collectively, “Li Party”) (collectively, “Petitioners”)
move unopposed for this Court to confirm their arbitration award (“Consent
Award”).  (Notice of Petition, pg. 2;
C.C.P. §§1285 et seq.)
 
Background
This dispute arises from Respondents MB
Development, LLC (“MB Development”) and FMB Consulting, LLC (“FMB Consulting”) (collectively,
“Respondents”) entering into a Limited Liability Company Membership Interest
Purchase Agreement (“Agreement”) with Kevin Zhang, Rockport Development, Inc.,
and Maestro Investments, Inc. (collectively, “Zhang Parties”) (collectively,
“Assignors”) in or around April 2019, wherein Respondents agreed to pay
$2,930,637 for Assignors’ membership interests.  (Petition ¶8.) 
The Petition states Respondents paid a total of $300,000 under the
Agreement and did not make any further payments under the Agreement.  (Petition ¶9.)  On or about December 18, 2019, Respondents
were served a notice of default, and Respondents failed to timely cure the
default.  (Petition ¶10.)  On January 2, 2020, Assignors assigned all
their rights, title, and interest, in and to the Agreement, to Petitioners.  (Petition ¶11.)
On March 20, 2020, pursuant to the Agreement
¶15, Petitioners demanded a mediation with Respondents.  (Petition ¶14.)  The Parties attended mediation on May 19,
2020, but were unable to resolve the matter at mediation.  (Petition ¶14.)
On July 3, 2020, the matter was submitted to
arbitration before Hon. Suzanne G. Bruguera (Ret.) (“Arbitrator”) with ADR
Services.  (Petition ¶15.)  Prior to the arbitration hearing set for
January 2021, and in order to avoid the further expenditure of time, money and
resources, the Parties agreed to settle the dispute through a consent award
(“Consent Award”) in favor of Petitioners. 
(Petition ¶16, Exh. 2.)  On
January 25, 2021, the Arbitrator signed the Consent Award.  (See Petition, Exh. 2.)
Petitioner filed its petition on June 5,
2023.  Petitioner filed the instant
motion on December 28, 2023.  As of the
date of this hearing no opposition has been filed.
 
Arbitration Award
          The party
seeking judicial enforcement of a private arbitration award has the burden of
proving the award as well as the existence of a valid arbitration
agreement.  (Toal v. Tardif (2009)
178 Cal.App.4th 1208, 1223 [holding burden not met by submitting copy of
contract with arbitration provision signed by party’s attorney rather than by
party personally].)
The specific grounds upon which an arbitrator’s award may
be vacated are set forth in C.C.P. §1286.2.  Except for such grounds, arbitration awards
are
immune from judicial review.  (See Moncharsh v. Heily & Blase (1992)
3 Cal.4th 1, 10-11 [limiting grounds for judicial review effectuates the
parties’ agreement that the award be final and also reflects that arbitrators
need not follow the law and may base their decisions on “broad principles of
justice and equity . . . paths neither marked nor traceable by judicial review”].)  Generally, errors of law committed by the
arbitrator are not grounds for challenging the arbitration award.  (Id. at pg. 11.)  The sufficiency of the evidence to support the
award is immaterial and courts cannot review the same.  (See Morris v. Zuckerman (1968) 69
Cal.2d. 686, 691.)  Courts cannot pass
upon the validity of the arbitrator’s reasoning and cannot substitute its
judgment for that of the arbitrator.  (See
Moncharsh, 3 Cal.4th at pg. 11.)
          Petitioners
have met their burden to prove the existence of the Consent Award and the
existence of the valid Arbitration Agreement. 
(Petition ¶16, Exh. 2;
Petition ¶¶8, 12, Exh. 1 at ¶¶15-16.) 
The Agreement contains a mediation provision followed by an arbitration provision.
The arbitration provision states, “If the dispute is not resolved in mediation,
then the following Arbitration Provision applies: . . . [¶] (b) Any Claim shall
be resolved by binding arbitration pursuant to this Arbitration Provision and
the applicable rules of ADR Services Inc. . . . [¶] (d) NO PARTY WILL HAVE THE RIGHT
TO LITIGATE ANY CLAIM IN COURT OR HAVE A JURY TRIAL ON THAT CLAIM . . .. THE
ARBITRATOR’S DECISION WILL BE FINAL AND BINDING.”  (Petition ¶12, Exh. 1 at ¶¶16(b), (d).)  
          Accordingly,
Petitioners’ petition to confirm the Consent Award is granted.
 
Conclusion
Based on the foregoing, Petitioners’ unopposed petition
to confirm the Consent Award is granted.  Petitioners are to submit a proposed judgment
within ten days.
Moving Party to give notice.
