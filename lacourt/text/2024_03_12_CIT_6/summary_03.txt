And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to strike the plaintiff's prayer for punitive damages with 20 days leave to amend. The judge has also ordered the defendant to give notice of the ruling within five calendar days of the order.

The judge's ruling is based on the plaintiff's complaint, which lacks allegations of fraud, oppression, or malice. The judge finds that the complaint does not demonstrate a deliberate failure to prevent the dangerous consequences of the cellular device at issue, and therefore does not support a claim for punitive damages.

The judge also denied the motion to strike the plaintiff's prayer for punitive damages on the grounds that the complaint lacks allegations of an officer, director, or managing agent's acts. The judge notes that the complaint does not allege that the defendant's alleged wrongful conduct was committed by an officer, director, or managing agent of the defendant.

Overall, the judge's tentative ruling strikes the plaintiff's prayer for punitive damages, requiring the plaintiff to amend the complaint to include allegations of fraud, oppression, or malice or to allege that the defendant's alleged wrongful conduct was committed by an officer, director, or managing agent of the defendant.
