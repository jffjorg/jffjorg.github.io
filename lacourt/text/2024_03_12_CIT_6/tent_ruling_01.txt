  Case Number:  22STCV18128    Hearing Date:   March 12, 2024    Dept:  6 CASE  NAME:  Beth  Browne v. Pomona Valley Hospital Medical Center, et al.  Motion  for Summary Judgment of Defendant Adeel M. Popalzai, D.O.  TENTATIVE  RULING  The Court GRANTS the motion for summary judgment of Defendant  Adeel M. Popalzai, D.O.  The Court will sign the proposed judgment submitted December 27,  2023.               Defendant Popalzai is ordered to  give notice of the Court’s ruling within five calendar days of this order.  BACKGROUND  This is a  medical malpractice case. On June 2, 2022, plaintiff Beth Browne, an incompetent  person, by and through her Guardian Ad Litem, Phillip Browne, filed this action  (LASC Case No. 22STCV18128) against defendants Pomona Valley Hospital Medical  Center, Phillip Lopez, RN, Janice Valledor, RN, Alan M. Wong, D.O., Kevin  Goldman, M.D., Adeel M. Popalzai, D.O. (Defendant or Popalzai), Daniel R.  Heitz, M.D., and Does 1 through 30, alleging one cause of action for medical  malpractice/professional negligence. Plaintiff Beth Browne passed away on September  24, 2022.  On March 8, 2023, plaintiffs Phillip Browne, Ryan Browne, Chad  Browne, and Allan Delabest filed a separate action (LASC Case No. 23PSCV00680) against  defendants Pomona Valley Hospital Medical Center, Phillip Lopez, RN, Janice  Valledor, RN, Alan M. Wong, D.O., Kevin Goldman, M.D., Adeel M. Popalzai, D.O.  , Daniel R. Heitz, M.D., and Does 1 through 30, alleging one cause of action  for wrongful death. Both actions were later consolidated, with Case No.  22STCV18128 being designated as the lead case.  On December 26, 2023, Defendant Popalzai filed a motion for  summary judgment. On February 21, 2024, Plaintiffs[1] filed a notice of non-opposition.  LEGAL  STANDARD  The  purpose of a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication “is to provide  courts with a mechanism to cut through the parties’ pleadings in order to  determine whether, despite their allegations, trial is in fact necessary to  resolve their dispute.” (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25  Cal.4th 826, 843.) “Code of Civil Procedure section 437c, subdivision (c), requires  the trial judge to grant summary judgment if all the evidence submitted, and  ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence’ and uncontradicted by  other inferences or evidence, show that there is no triable issue as to any  material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of  law.” (Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119,  italics in original and quoting Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (c).) “The  function of the pleadings in a motion for summary judgment is to delimit the  scope of the issues; the function of the affidavits or declarations is to  disclose whether there is any triable issue of fact within the issues delimited  by the pleadings.” (Juge v. County of Sacramento (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th  59, 67, citing FPI Development, Inc. v. Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d  367, 381-382.)  “On  a motion for summary judgment, the initial burden is always on the moving party  to make a prima facie showing that there are no triable issues of material  fact.” (Scalf v. D.B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510,  1519.) A defendant moving for summary judgment or summary adjudication “has met  his or her burden of showing that a cause of action has no merit if the party  has shown that one or more elements of the cause of action, even if not  separately pleaded, cannot be established, or that there is a complete defense  to the cause of action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2); see also Scalf v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1520.)  Once  the defendant has met that burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff “to show  that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to the cause of  action or a defense thereto.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2).) To establish a triable issue of  material fact, the party opposing the motion “shall not rely upon the  allegations or denials of its pleadings to show that a triable issue of  material fact exists but, instead, shall set forth the specific facts showing  that a triable issue of material fact exists as to the cause of action or a  defense thereto.” (Id.; see also Sangster  v. Paetkau (1998) 68  Cal.App.4th 151, 166.)  Courts  “liberally construe the evidence in support of the party opposing summary  judgment and resolve doubts concerning the evidence in favor of that party.” (Dore  v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 384, 389.)  DISCUSSION  Summary of Undisputed Material Facts  On April 8, 2021, at approximately 8:36 p.m., decedent Beth Browne  (Decedent) was admitted to Pomona Valley Hospital Medical Center after having  been involved in a car accident. (UMF 1.) Upon arrival, a neurological exam was  performed, and Decedent was documented as being alert and oriented, moving all  extremities, and having no focal deficits. (UMF 2.) A CT scan was performed  around 11:00 p.m. later that evening, in which there was no evidence of a  stroke. (UMF 3.) The following morning on April 9, 2021 at 2:02 a.m., Dr. Wong  indicated in a note that Decedent has no evidence of an acute traumatic process  requiring surgery or further workup and Decedent was to be discharged later  that morning. (UMF 4.) At 6:33 a.m., Decedent opened her eyes, answered  questions but was drowsy and had pain of 7/10 on the pain scale. (UMF 5.) At 9:49  a.m., Decedent had slurred speech and was unable to open her eyes upon command.  When Decedent did wake up, she was too sleepy to drink water as instructed and  fell back asleep. (UMF 6.) These findings were discussed with an emergency room  physician who reviewed the records and suggested Narcan. (UMF 6.) At 10:15  a.m., a stroke alert was called when Decedent was unable to move the left side  of her body, and her NIK stroke scale value was 22, at which point a consultation  with Defendant Popalzai, a neurologist, was requested. (UMF 7.) Defendant Popalzai  was contacted within 10 minutes and was advised of what had occurred and  ordered labs and imaging studies. (UMF 8.) Following another CT scan, Defendant  Popalzai concluded Decedent had suffered a stroke, the timing of which was not  clear, but may have occurred overnight after Decedent’s arrival. (UMF 10.)  Defendant Popalzai directed Decedent to be transferred and admitted to the ICU.  (UMF 11.) Popalzai prescribed treatments for Decedent to help stabilize her  condition, and continued to monitor Decedent’s condition for a few weeks  thereafter until she was discharged. (UMF 12.)  Defendant Popalzai’s expert witness, Dr. Sanossian, is of the  opinion that the evidence reflects Popalzai was timely notified regarding  Decedent’s stroke, and that his response was appropriate. (UMF 14.) Dr.  Sanossian agrees with Popalzai’s assessment that, based on the record, it is  unclear when the stroke occurred. (UMF 15.) Dr. Sanossian agrees that Popalzai’s  recommended treatment was appropriate given the record. (UMF 18.) Dr. Sanossian  further agrees that, to a reasonable degree of medical probability, there was  nothing Popalzai did or did not do that caused or contributed to Decedent’s  injuries, and that the stroke had already progressed to a point where other  interventions, such as a thrombectomy, would not have changed the outcome here.  (UMF 19.)  Analysis  “The elements of Plaintiff's medical negligence cause of  action allege ‘(1) the duty of the professional to use such skill, prudence,  and diligence as other members of his profession commonly possess and exercise;  (2) a breach of that duty; (3) a proximate causal connection between the negligent conduct  and the resulting injury;  and (4) actual loss or damage resulting from the professional's negligence.’  [Citation.]” (Belfiore-Braman v. Rotenberg (2018) 25 Cal.App.5th 234,  238 fn. 3.) “As in medical malpractice cases, standards of due care and  competence are commonly established by the generally accepted practices and  procedures within the professional community. [Citations.]” (Milligan v. Hearing Aid Dispensers Examining Com.  (1983) 142 Cal.App.3d 1002, 1006.)  Defendant Popalzai argues that the expert testimony from Dr.  Sanossian establishes there are no triable issues of material fact, as Popalzai  met the standard of care and did not cause or contribute to Decedent’s  injuries. The Court agrees.  Dr. Sanossian’s expert testimony clearly provides that Popalzai did  not breach the applicable standard of care within the relevant professional  community, and that Popalzai did not cause or contribute to Decedent’s alleged  injuries. (See Sanossian Decl., ¶¶ 2-14; UMF 14-19.) “Expert evidence in a  malpractice suit is conclusive as to the proof of the prevailing standard of  skill and learning in the locality and of the propriety of particular conduct  by the practitioner in particular instances because such standard and skill is  not a matter of general knowledge and can only be supplied by expert  testimony.” (Willard v. Hagemeister (1981) 121 Cal.App.3d 406, 412,  quoting Starr v. Mooslin (1971) 14 Cal.App.3d 988, 999.) The burden of  proof now shifts to Plaintiffs to establish the absence of a triable issue of  material fact.  Plaintiffs expressly indicated that they do not oppose Defendant  Popalzai’s motion for summary judgment. (Notice of Non-opposition, 2:1-8.)  Accordingly, Plaintiffs have not established the existence of a triable issue  of material fact as to Defendant Popalzai.  Based on the foregoing, the Court GRANTS Defendant Popalzai’s  motion for summary judgment.  CONCLUSION  The Court GRANTS the motion for summary judgment of Defendant  Adeel M. Popalzai, D.O.  The Court will sign the proposed judgment submitted December 27,  2023.               Defendant Popalzai is ordered to  give notice of the Court’s ruling within five calendar days of this order.
