On March 7, 2024, the Court entered a
default judgment of $33,416.93 against defendant/judgment debtor Alma Cruz (“Cruz”).
Cruz now seeks an exemption for “any and all deposits held in [her] name at
Bank of America Corporation.” Plaintiff/judgment creditor TD Bank, N.A. opposes
the claim. 
          Cruz cites to
Code of Civil Procedure section 704.220 as authority for her claimed exemption.
Under section 704.220, “[m]oney in the judgment debtor’s deposit account in an
amount equal to or less than the minimum basic standard of adequate care for a
family of four for Region 1, established by Section 11452 of the Welfare and
Institutions Code and as annually adjusted by the State Department of Social
Services pursuant to Section 11453 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, is
exempt without making a claim.” Under W&I Code section 11452, the minimum
basic standards of adequate care for a family of four is $824. The exemption
provided by section 704.220 is per debtor, not per account, therefore, this
amount is automatically exempt from only one of Cruz’s deposit accounts. (See
Code Civ. Proc,. § 704.220, subd. (e)(1).) 
          Next,
although Cruz does not specifically cite this statute, pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure section 704.225, “[m]oney in a judgment debtor's deposit
account that is not otherwise exempt . . . is exempt to the extent necessary
for the support of the judgment debtor and the spouse and dependents of the
judgment debtor.” “The determination of what is ‘necessary’ for the support of
the judgment debtor or his family has not been subject to a precise definition
and differs with each debtor [Citations].” (J. J. MacIntyre Co. v. Duren
(1981) 118 Cal.App.3d Supp. 16, 18.) 
Here, Cruz states that her total
monthly income is $3,850.80 and her total monthly expenses are $4,595. Cruz’s claimed
expenses for utilities and telephone ($375), transportation & auto expenses
($650), laundry and cleaning ($200), and entertainment ($120) do not appear
reasonable for Cruz and her 26-year old daughter, who is Cruz’s only dependent,
given Cruz’s take-home pay. For instance, $650 per month is unreasonably high for
transportation and auto expenses especially since Cruz does not list any car
payments. If, at the hearing, Cruz can explain why these amounts are reasonable
and necessary, the Court will continue the hearing for 2 weeks to allow
Defendant to submit evidence corroborating this claim. Otherwise, the Court
only exempts $824 from enforcement.
