I.           
INTRODUCTION
On July 8,
 2024, this wrongful termination action was filed by plaintiff
 Jason Ray Castellano (“Plaintiff”) against New
 Perspective Recovery LLC (“NPR”), Benchmark Young Adult School, Inc.
 (“Benchmark”), Emend Health Corporation (“Emend”), and Emend Healthcare.

On August 12,
 2024, NPR, Benchmark, and Emend (collectively, “Defendants”) filed
this motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, to compel arbitration and stay
action. 
Plaintiff filed an opposition brief and
objection on August 22, 2024. 
Defendants filed a reply brief on November
 13, 2024. 
II.         
LEGAL
STANDARD
In deciding a motion to compel
arbitration, trial courts must decide first whether an enforceable arbitration
agreement exists between the parties, and then determine the second gateway
issue whether the claims are covered within the scope of the agreement. (Omar
v. Ralphs Grocery Co. (2004) 118 Cal.App.4th 955, 961.) The party seeking
arbitration has the “burden of proving the existence of a valid arbitration
agreement by a preponderance of the evidence, while a party opposing the
petition bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence any
fact necessary to its defense.” (Ruiz v. Moss Bros. Auto Group, Inc.
(2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 836, 842.) The trial court “sits as the trier of fact,
weighing all the affidavits, declarations, and other documentary evidence, and
any oral testimony the court may receive at its discretion, to reach a final
determination.” (Id.) General principles of contract law govern whether
parties have entered a binding agreement to arbitrate. (Pinnacle Museum
Tower Assn. v. Pinnacle Market Development (US), LLC (2012) 55 Cal.4th 223,
236; see also Winter v. Window Fashions Professions, Inc. (2008) 166
Cal.App.4th 943, 947.)¿
III.       
DISCUSSION
“The party seeking to compel
arbitration bears the burden of proving the existence of a valid arbitration
agreement.” (Flores v. Evergreen at San Diego, LLC (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 581, 586.) Here, Defendants assert that NPR and Plaintiff entered
into at-will employment pursuant to an Offer Letter dated June 22, 2023, and a
Mutual Agreement to Arbitrate Employment (“Arbitration Agreement”) dated June
22, 2023. (Motion, p. 1.) Defendants state that Plaintiff began working as a
night-shift behavioral health technician beginning on June 28, 2023, and that his
employment was terminated on May 14, 2024. Defendants contend that Plaintiff
must arbitrate his employment claims pursuant to the Arbitration Agreement,
which is attached as Exhibit B to the Declaration of Christopher Wilson. 
The Arbitration Agreement is entered
into between NPR and Plaintiff (defined as the “Parties”) and applies to “any
claim, complaint or dispute that relates in any way to the Parties’ employment
relationship.” (‘Wilson Decl., Ex. B.) However, on August 22, 2024, Plaintiff
dismissed NPR from the Complaint. Therefore, the motion, as to NPR, is DENIED
as moot. Additionally, since Benchmark and Emend, as the sole remaining
defendants, do not contend that a valid arbitration agreement exists between
them and Plaintiff, the motion to compel Plaintiff to arbitrate his claims
against them is DENIED. 
IV.       
CONCLUSION
Defendants’ motion to compel
arbitration is DENIED.

this 20th
day of November, 2024
