Summary of the tentative ruling:

The tentative ruling addresses the defendants' motions to compel further responses to written discovery. The court finds that the plaintiff's contention that the motions are moot because further responses have already been served is rejected. The court grants the motions in part and requires the plaintiff to provide further responses to certain requests for production and form interrogatories. The court also sustains the plaintiff's objections based on the taxpayer privilege and the attorney-client privilege/attorney-work product doctrine, on the condition that the plaintiff provide a privilege log. The court awards monetary sanctions against the plaintiff and counsel of record in the amount of $2,490.
