And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of TD Bank, NA vs. Alma Cruz regarding Cruz's claim of exemption for deposits held in her name at Bank of America Corporation. Cruz had previously been awarded a default judgment of $33,416.93 against her, and she is now seeking an exemption for some of her deposits. The judge notes that under Code of Civil Procedure section 704.220, a judgment debtor's deposits up to a certain amount are exempt from enforcement, but that this amount is per debtor, not per account. The judge also notes that under section 704.225, a judgment debtor's deposits that are not otherwise exempt are exempt to the extent necessary for the support of the judgment debtor and their dependents.

The judge finds that Cruz's claimed expenses for utilities, transportation, laundry, and entertainment do not appear reasonable, and that she will need to explain why these amounts are necessary at the hearing. If Cruz can provide evidence to support her claimed expenses, the judge will continue the hearing for two weeks to allow her to do so. Otherwise, the judge will only exempt $824 from enforcement, which is the minimum basic standard of adequate care for a family of four.

The judge has scheduled a hearing for November 20, 2024, and has set forth instructions for parties who intend to submit on the tentative ruling.
