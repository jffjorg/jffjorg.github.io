And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge William A. Crowfoot in the case of Jason Ray Castellano v. New Perspective Recovery, LLC, et al. (Case No. 24NNCV02757). The case involves a wrongful termination action filed by Castellano against New Perspective Recovery LLC, Benchmark Young Adult School, Inc., Emend Health Corporation, and Emend Healthcare. The defendants filed a motion to compel arbitration and stay the action, which was opposed by Castellano. The judge has denied the motion, ruling that the defendants have failed to prove the existence of a valid arbitration agreement between Castellano and the remaining defendants, Benchmark and Emend. The judge also noted that Castellano had dismissed New Perspective Recovery LLC from the complaint, making the motion moot as to that defendant.
