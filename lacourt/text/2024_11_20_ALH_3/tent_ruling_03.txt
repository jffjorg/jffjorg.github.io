On December 4, 2023, plaintiff Samson
Mulugeta (“Plaintiff”) filed this medical malpractice action against The
Oncology Institute of Hope and Innovation (“Oncology Institute”) and Amitabha
Mazumder (“Mazumder”). On October 1, 2024, Oncology Institute and Mazumder
(collectively, “Defendants”) filed these six motions for orders compelling
Plaintiff to serve further responses to written discovery. On October 24, 2024,
the Court advanced the hearings on Defendants’ motions and ordered the parties
to file joint separate statements. 
          On November
13, 2024, Plaintiff filed six joint separate statements and Defendants filed
their reply briefs noting Plaintiff’s failure to oppose the motions. The next
day, on November 14, 2024, Plaintiff filed two belated consolidated opposition
briefs and objected to Defendants’ arguments within their reply briefs. 
          As an initial
matter, the Court addresses Plaintiff’s claim that Defendants’ motions are moot
because further responses have already been served on October 31, 2024. (Opp.,
p. 2.) The Court rejects the contention that Plaintiff may “unilaterally divest
the court of authority to rule on the motion by serving a further response”
while a motion to compel further is pending. (County of San Benito v.
Superior Court (2023) 96 Cal.App.5th 243, 256.) This approach “would permit
a party faced with a motion to compel to delay its adjudication indefinitely by
successive supplemental but inadequate responses, each prompting a further
motion to compel, each of which in turn would be defeated by piecemeal
supplementation.” (Ibid.) 
          While
Plaintiff does not include copies of these further responses, and there appears
to be some dispute as to whether these further responses have even been served,
the Court notes that the joint statements appear to include Plaintiff’s further
responses within them. The Court therefore proceeds to rule on Defendants’
maintained requests for further responses as outlined in the separate
statements. Additionally, since Oncology Institute and Mazumder’s discovery
requests are identical, the Court addresses them jointly. 
Requests for Production (Set One), Nos.
2-14, 16-17, 19-22, 24-31, and 34-38
          The motions are
GRANTED in part and further responses are required in response to RFP Nos. 2-3,
8, 10-12, 16-17, 20-22, 24-30, 34-35. If Plaintiff intends to comply with a
request for production, Plaintiff must provide a Code-compliant response
stating that the production will be in whole or in part and that documents in
his possession, custody, or control will be produced. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.220.) If Plaintiff cannot comply with the request for production,
Plaintiff must provide a Code-compliant response stating that a diligent search
and reasonable inquiry has been made and provide the reason for his inability
to comply. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.230.) The Court sustains Plaintiff’s
objections based on the taxpayer privilege and the attorney-client privilege/attorney-work
product doctrine, on the condition that Plaintiff provide a privilege log. All
other objections are overruled. 
Based on Plaintiff’s representation
that he waives all claims for past medical expenses, the motion is DENIED as to
RFP Nos. 4-7, 9, 19, and 31. 
Special Interrogatories (Set One), Nos.
10-14, 16-17, 19-22, 27, and 41
          The motions
are DENIED as to SROG Nos. 10-14, and 27 based on Plaintiff’s representation
that he is waiving his claims for past medical expenses. 
The motion is DENIED as to SROG Nos. 16
as the Court SUSTAINS the objection that the interrogatories call for the
premature disclosure of expert witness opinion. 
          The motion is
GRANTED as to SROG Nos. 17, 21, 22. The Court overrules the objections to SROG
No. 17 as no expert witness opinion is being sought. The objections to SROG
Nos. 21 and 22 are also overruled. 
          The motion is
DENIED as to SROG Nos. 19 and 41 as moot. 
Form Interrogatories (Set One), Nos. 2.6(b),
6.5, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5, 8.6, 8.7, 8.8, 10.1, 10.2, 13.1, and 13.2
          Plaintiff
agrees to supplement his responses to FROG Nos. 2.6, 6.5; therefore, the motion
is GRANTED as to these interrogatories. 
          The motions
are DENIED as to FROG Nos. 8.2 through 8.8 and 13.1 as moot. 
          The motions
are GRANTED as to FROG Nos. 10.1 and 10.2. If Plaintiff alleges in his
Complaint that “his cancer worsened” as a result of Defendants, Plaintiff
clearly has medical conditions and injuries that preexisted Defendants’ alleged
wrongful conduct. Therefore, Plaintiff must either substantiate or disavow the
allegations in his Complaint in response to FROG Nos. 10.1 or 10.2. 
          Monetary Sanctions
          The Court awards
sanctions in connection with Defendants’ motions to compel further responses to
their Requests for Production and Form Interrogatories, even if Plaintiff
eventually served further responses while these motions were pending. (CRC
3.1348.) The Court does not award sanctions in connection with Defendant’s
motions to compel further responses to Special Interrogatories (Set One)
because Plaintiff’s objection to Special Interrogatory No. 16 was justified. 
          However,
since each defendant’s motions were substantively identical, the Court imposes
monetary sanctions against Plaintiff and counsel of record, jointly and
severally, in the reduced amount of $2,490, consisting of 10 hours at defense
counsel’s hourly rate of $225, plus $240 in filing fees.
