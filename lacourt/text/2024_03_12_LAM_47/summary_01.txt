And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion by the plaintiff, Justin Beimforde, to set aside a judgment entered against him. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant, Kirk Retz, interfered with contractual relations. The defendant filed a special motion to strike under Code of Civil Procedure ยง 425.16, which the court granted. The judgment was entered based on the court's ruling on the special motion to strike.

The plaintiff's motion to set aside the judgment is untimely served, but the court overlooks this deficiency and addresses the motion on its merits. The plaintiff's papers consist only of citations to Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b), which provides for discretionary relief from a judgment. However, the plaintiff does not apply these authorities to the facts of the case and does not identify any mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect that would support relief from the judgment.

The court concludes that there is no basis to grant the relief requested and denies the plaintiff's motion to set aside the judgment.
