CASE
HISTORY:
·        
05/05/23: Complaint filed.
·        
02/05/24: Judgment entered.
 
STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is an action for intentional interference with contractual
relations. Plaintiff alleges that Defendant interfered with a series of
agreements for Plaintiff to act as agent for the sale of several pieces of real
property. 
 
Plaintiff moves to set aside the
judgment entered against him. 
 
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Plaintiff moves to set aside the
judgment entered against him. 
 
At the outset, the Court observes
that Plaintiff served this motion by mail on February 15, 2024. Pursuant to
Code of Civil Procedure section 1005(b), notice of this motion was due on
February 16, 2024, plus five calendar days for service by mail. (Code Civ.
Proc. § 1005(b); 1013.) Plaintiff’s motion was therefore untimely served. As
Defendant has substantively responded to this motion without objecting to the
manner of service, the Court overlooks this deficiency and addresses the motion
on its merits. 
 
Plaintiff’s papers consist entirely
of recitation of authorities pertaining to Code of Civil Procedure section
473(b)’s discretionary relief provision. This section provides:
 
The court may, upon any terms as may be
just, relieve a party or his or her legal representative from a judgment…taken
against him or her through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or
excusable neglect. Application for this relief shall be accompanied by a copy
of the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed therein, otherwise the
application shall not be granted, and shall be made within a reasonable time,
in no case exceeding six months, after the judgment…was taken.
 
(Code Civ. Proc.
§ 473(b).)
 
Plaintiff offers no application of
these authorities to the facts of this case and identifies no mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect on his part that would support
relief from the judgment.  Moreover,
judgment was entered against Plaintiff based on the Court’s ruling on
Defendant’s special motion to strike under Code of Civil Procedure § 425.16,
issued on January 12, 2024.  Although
there was a question about service of Defendant’s motion, Plaintiff did file an
opposition, and the Court considered the opposition even though it was filed
late.  The Court’s order granting the
motion was grounded on the assessment that all the misconduct alleged to have
been committed by Defendant in Plaintiff’s complaint were statements made and
actions taken in the course of conduct that were non-actionable because they
are absolutely privileged under Civil Code section 47.  (1/12/24 Minute Order, p. 6.)  Because it concluded that   “all
interfering conduct alleged by Plaintiff arose in the context of ongoing
litigation,” the Court found that “Plaintiff cannot show probability of success
on the merits because the conduct on which the action is based is absolutely
privileged.”  (Id.)  Given this legal basis for the Court’s
judgment, and the absence of any showing that that there was “mistake,
inadvertence, surprise or excusable neglect” with respect to Plaintiff’s
defense of the special motion to strike, the Court concludes there is no basis
to grant the relief requested.
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion to
Set Aside the Judgment is DENIED. 
 
Moving Party to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.

            Any party may submit on the
tentative ruling by contacting the courtroom via email at Smcdept47@lacourt.org by no later than 4:00 p.m. the day
before the hearing. All interested parties must be copied on the email. It
should be noted that if you submit on a tentative ruling the court will still
conduct a hearing if any party appears. By submitting on the tentative you
have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you
should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an
order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
