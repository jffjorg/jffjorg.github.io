And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion in limine to preclude evidence of harms suffered by Plaintiff Serpuhie Sarkissian based on the loss of revenues of Central Valley Cheese, Inc. The court found that this issue is now moot because Plaintiff has elected to pursue the remedy of disgorgement.

The judge also denied the defendants' motion to deny Plaintiff Serpuhie Sarkissian standing to pursue her causes of action. The court ruled that Plaintiff's causes of action are direct, not derivative, because they arise from the defendants' alleged misrepresentations of the value of Central Valley Cheese, Inc. and the failure to disclose the sale of Karoun. The court found that Plaintiff was individually harmed and the harm is not merely incidental to the harm to the corporation.
