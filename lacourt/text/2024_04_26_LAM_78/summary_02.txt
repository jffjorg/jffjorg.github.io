And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motion to deem requests for admissions, set one admitted. The defendant failed to respond to the requests for admissions, which is a misuse of the discovery process. As a result, the court imposes sanctions in the amount of $655 on the defendant, payable within 20 days. The court also awards the plaintiff $595 in sanctions for one hour of attorney time at a rate of $595 per hour and filing fees in the amount of $60.
