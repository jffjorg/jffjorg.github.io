Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel further responses from defendant Inland Valley Partners. The plaintiff, Renew Health, seeks information from the defendant's confidential personnel files, but the defendant has objected to the request. The court has declined to consider the defendant's objections, finding that they were not properly made.

The court has also agreed that Inland Valley should not be compelled to produce the confidential personnel files of its employees without any limitation on the basis of third-party privacy rights. The court has followed the framework established in Hill v. National Collegiate Athletic Assn. (1994) for evaluating potential invasions of privacy, balancing the competing interests of the parties.

In reaching its decision, the court has considered the relevant laws and precedents, including Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.220, Evidence Code section 1157, and cases such as Williams v. Superior Court (2017) and Board of Trustees v. Sup. Ct. (Dong) (1981).

The court's tentative ruling is subject to change after further consideration and argument by the parties.
