  Case Number:  19PSCV00291    Hearing Date:   September 10, 2024    Dept:  H Cross-Complainant Lone Oak Fund’s Application
for Default Judgment is DENIED without prejudice.
 
Background
Plaintiffs
Zengpeng Feng (“Zengpeng”), Jiaxiang Feng (“Jiaxiang”) and Yongxiang Feng (“Yongxiang”)
(collectively, “Plaintiffs”) allege as follows:
Plaintiffs are Chinese nationals with limited knowledge of
English and limited knowledge of the California real estate markets. In or
around April 2012, Zengpeng and non-party Zhengjun Wang (“Zhengjun”) traveled
together to Las Vegas, where they won a significant sum of money gambling.
While in Las Vegas, Zengpeng and Zhengjun met Fai Wong (“Wong”), who
represented himself as a casino host. Wong told Zengpeng and Zhengjun that they
could not legally return to China with their winnings or otherwise transfer the
money to China and that they had to invest the money in the United States. Wong
represented that he knew of properties in Las Vegas that could be purchased as
an investment for approximately the amount of money Zengpeng and Zhengjun had
won and that he could handle this transaction for them. Zengpeng provided Wong
with $460,000.00 to invest on his behalf.
Wong promised to invest the money in properties in Las
Vegas, and the first of the properties was purchased on or about May 7, 2012.
These properties are currently involved in litigation in Case No. A-18-777837-C
(the “Nevada Case”). Zengpeng, and his sons Jiaxiang and Yongxiang, agreed to
acquire additional properties, including properties in Southern California, by
and through Wong. Wong would recommend a particular property and then, on
Wong’s instructions, Plaintiffs would transfer funds into accounts controlled
by Wong in China.
Wong and his associates, including his wife Liming Jiang
(“Jiang”), would use funds transferred into the account to purchase the
recommended property through a now-defunct entity controlled by them (i.e.,
Golden Ocean Investment, LLC [“Golden Ocean”]) and then have Golden Ocean sell
the property to Zengpeng or his sons at inflated prices.
In 2012, Golden Ocean purchased three properties, (1) 14730
Finisterra Place, Hacienda Heights, California (the “Finisterra Property”), (2)
8684 Via Santa Cruz, Whittier, California (the “Santa Cruz Property”) and (3)
vacant land near Via Santa Cruz and La Cuarta Street, Whittier, California (the
“Vacant Lot”) on behalf of Zengpeng, which were titled in Jiaxiang’s and
Yongxiang’s names. Wong, Jiang and their associates took care of the Finisterra
and Santa Cruz Properties and the Vacant Lot.
In August 2014, Wong told Zengpeng that Jiaxiang should
sign a power of attorney so that he could hire a professional property
management company to manage the Santa Cruz Property. Jiaxiang signed a power
of attorney which was recorded January 29, 2015 (the “2014 Santa Cruz Power of
Attorney”).
In 2015, Wong told Zengpeng that Yongxiang needed to sign a
power of attorney so that he could lease the Finisterra Property out to a
tenant. Yongxiang signed a power of attorney which was recorded on November 9,
2015 (the “2015 Finisterra Power of Attorney”).
On or about January 20, 2015, Jiang, as “attorney in fact”
for Jiaxiang, signed a grant deed conveying the Santa Cruz Property from Jiaxiang
to Global Panda Entertainment LLC (“Global Panda”), without Plaintiffs’
knowledge or consent. The grant deed was recorded January 29, 2015 (the “2015
Santa Cruz Grant Deed”). Wong, as manager of Global Panda, signed a Deed of
Trust with Absolute Assignment of Leases and Rents, Security Agreement and
Fixture Filing (First Priority—to be recorded in Los Angeles County) for the
benefit of Lone Oak Fund, LLC (“Lone Oak”) to secure a loan for $3,660,000.00 (the
“2015 Lone Oak Deed of Trust (LA)”), again without Plaintiffs’ knowledge or
consent. The 2015 Lone Oak Deed of Trust (LA) encumbered the Santa Cruz
Property as well as the Northview Property and the Las Palmas Property (the latter
two properties which are the subject of other litigations) and was recorded on
January 29, 2015. On or about January 22, 2015, Wong, as manager of Global
Panda, signed a Deed of Trust with Absolute Assignment of Leases and Rents,
Security Agreement and Fixture Filing (First Priority—to be recorded in Orange
County) for the benefit of Lone Oak to secure a loan for $3,660,000.00 (the
“2015 Lone Oak Deed of Trust (OC)”), without Plaintiffs’ knowledge or consent.
The 2015 Lone Oak Deed of Trust (OC) encumbered the Santa Cruz Property, the Northview Property, and the Las Palmas Property and was recorded
on January 29, 2015. These loans were paid off.
On or about December 21, 2016, Wong forged a “Power of
Attorney—Special” that was recorded on January 5, 2017 (the “2016 Forged Power
of Attorney”); this purported to have been signed by Baohua Wang (“Baohua”),
the owner of the Northview and Las Palmas Properties, and appointed Wong as
attorney in fact with respect to the Santa Cruz Property, the Northview Property, and the Las Palmas Property. On or about December 27, 2016, Wong, as managing
member of Global Panda, signed a grant deed (the “2016 Santa Cruz Grant Deed”)
conveying the Santa Cruz Property from Global Panda to Global Travel &
Cultural Entertainment (“Global Travel”). The Santa Cruz Grant Deed was
recorded on January 4, 2017.
On or about December 27, 2016, Wong, as managing member of
Global Panda and “attorney in fact,” signed a Deed of Trust with Absolute
Assignment of Leases and Rents, Security Agreement and Fixture Filing (First
Priority—to be recorded in Los Angeles County) (the “2016 Lone Oak Deed of
Trust (LA)”) and a Deed of Trust with Absolute Assignment of Leases and Rents,
Security Agreement and Fixture Filing (First Priority—to be recorded in Orange
County) (the “2016 Lone Oak Deed of Trust (OC)”) for the benefit of Lone Oak to
secure a loan in the amount of $4,145,000.00; these documents were recorded on
January 4, 2017, without Plaintiffs’ knowledge or consent.
On or about October 31, 2017, Wong, Qun Yang (“Yang”), a
member and officer of Global Travel, and their associates forged another Power
of Attorney recorded November 13, 2017 (the “2017 Forged Power of Attorney”);
this purported to have been signed by Baohua and appointed Yang as “attorney in
fact” for the Santa Cruz Property and the Northview Property. On or about
November 7, 2017, Yang, as “attorney in fact” for Baohua, signed a grant deed
purporting to transfer the Northview Property from Baohua to Global Travel (the
“2017 Northview Grant Deed”); this was recorded on November 15, 2017.
On or about November 7, 2017, Wong, as managing member of
Global Travel, signed a Deed of Trust with Absolute Assignment of Leases and
Rents, Security Agreement and Fixture Filing (Second Priority—to be recorded in
Los Angeles County) for the benefit of Qualfax to secure a loan in the amount
of $300,000.00 (the “2017 Qualfax Deed of Trust”) which was recorded on
November 15, 2017, without Plaintiffs’ knowledge or consent.
On or about January 9, 2019, Qualfax held a foreclosure
sale, at which time it obtained a Trustee’s Deed, which was recorded on January
11, 2019 (“2019 Trustee’s Deed”).
Also, on or about November 4, 2015, Wong, as “attorney in
fact” for Yongxiang, signed a Deed of Trust (the “RBB Deed of Trust”) and an
Assignment of Rents, for the benefit of Royal Business Bank (“RBB”) to secure a
loan for $1,680,000.00; these documents were recorded on November 9, 2015 against
the Finisterra Property without Plaintiffs’ knowledge or consent. Wong, Yang
and their associates also forged an Unconditional Limited Guarantee on of about
November 3, 2015 wherein Yongxiang purportedly was “guarantor” to secure the
loan, again without Plaintiffs’ knowledge or consent.
On or about June 12, 2018, Wong, Yang and associates forged
a grant deed, which purports to convey the Vacant Lot from Jiaxiang to Global
Travel; this was recorded on June 20, 2018, without Plaintiffs’ knowledge or
consent.

Discussion 
Cross-Complainant
Lone Oak’s Application for Default Judgment is denied without prejudice.
The following defects are noted: 
1.
      Lone Oak has failed to dismiss Roes
1-20.

2.
      Lone Oak lists the “demand of
complaint” in Paragraph 2(a) of Request for Court Judgment Judicial Council
Form CIV-100 as $10,815,568.20. This amount includes interest calculations,
fees, and costs, each of which should be set forth separately. 
3.       The figure of $20,994,416.10 set forth on
page 6, line 12 of Lone Oak’s Case Summary appears to have been made in error.
The Court requests confirmation in this regard, as well as substitution of the
correct figure. 
4.
      Lone Oak is directed to provide a
separate interest calculation providing the Court with where each different
interest rate is located in the loan documents.

5.
      Lone Oak is directed to provide the
Court with documentary evidence of the “estimated” fees identified on page 6,
line 25 through page 7, line 4 of its Case Summary, as well as the “[d]eferred
[f]orbearance [f]ee through 12/31/2018” of $41,450.00 and the “[f]oreclosure
fees and costs paid as of 05/08/2108” of $11,395.54, identified on page 6,
lines 23 and 24 of its Case Summary. 
6.
      Lone Oak is directed to provide the
Court with an itemization of the fees identified on lines 1, 4, 12 and 16 of
its Memorandum of Costs (Summary). Lone Oak is further directed to explain to
the Court why it is entitled to jury fees. 
7.
      Lone Oak is directed to provide the
Court with a statement of account, to the extent one exists, reflecting
payments and charges on the loan. 
8.
      Lone Oak seeks $755,257.50 in
attorney’s fees. The Court notes that Garrett’s hourly rate of $360.00 during
the September 29, 2021 to December 9, 2021 time period thereafter jumped to
$625.00 during the January 21, 2022 to October 31, 2022 time period before
being reduced to $562.50 during the November 2, 2022 to March 7, 2024 time
period. The Court requests an explanation regarding the above billing rates,
particularly the $265.00 hourly increase between the first and second time
periods. The Court makes the same requests as to the rates set forth for Ryan
C. Squire. In the absence of time records, the Court also requests a detailed
fees declaration from Candie Y. Chang regarding the 1,131.4 hours she expended
in connection with this matter.
9.
      Lone Oak appears to seek punitive
damages but has not provided the Court with any information as to the financial
status of Wong, Jiang, Global Panda, and Global Travel. It is also unclear to
the Court whether Lone Oak ever served Wong, Jiang, Global Panda, and Global
Travel with a statement prescribed by Code of Civil Procedure section 425.115.
 
Accordingly, Lone Oak’s application for default judgment is
denied without prejudice and Lone Oak is directed to submit a new default
judgment packet that addresses the aforementioned issues.
