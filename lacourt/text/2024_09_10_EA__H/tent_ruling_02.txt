The Court is not inclined to award  sanctions under the circumstances. 6.       As  to Plaintiff Ruben Olague’s Motion to Compel Further Responses and Documents  from Defendant Inland Valley Partners, LLC to Request for Identification and  Production of Documents, Set One, (a) the  motion appears to be moot as to Nos. 38-40, 64, 65 and 69, provided that  Inland Valley provides verifications at or before the time of the hearing; (b)  the motion is denied as to Nos. 48 and 78; and (c) the motion is granted as to  Nos. 1, 22-30, 56, 62, 63, 66-68 and 79. Inland Valley is to provide further,  Code-compliant responses to Request for Production of Documents Nos. 1, 22-30,  56, 62, 63, 66-68 and 79 and to provide a further privilege log with respect to any requests for  which any responsive documents are being withheld on the basis of privilege within 20 days from the date of the notice of ruling. Sanctions are  declined.   Background  Plaintiff Ruben Olague (“Plaintiff”) alleges that he is a  dependent adult and that while he was a resident at Inland Valley Care and  Rehabilitation Center, he developed severe pressure sores due to deficiencies  in care. On April 24, 2024, Plaintiff filed a First Amended  Complaint (the “Operative Complaint”), asserting causes of action against  Inland Valley Partners, LLC (“Inland Valley”), Renew Health Consulting  Services, LLC (“Renew Health”) (together, “Defendants”) and Does 1-250 for (1)  dependent adult abuse under the Elder Abuse and Dependent Adult Civil  Protection Act (Welfare and Institutions Code §§ 15600, et seq.) and (2)  negligence. Pending before the Court are Plaintiff’s five motions to  compel further responses and/or documents from either Renew Health or Inland  Valley. Prior to filing the instant motions, Plaintiff and Defendants met and  conferred as to each motion. Many of the motions were also previewed at an  Informal Discovery Conference (IDC) held before Judge Hernandez.   Legal Standards  “[A]ny party may  obtain discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the  subject matter involved in the pending action or to the determination of any  motion made in that action, if the matter either is itself admissible in  evidence or appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of  admissible evidence. . .” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2017.010). “In the context of  discovery, evidence is ‘relevant’ if it might reasonably assist a party in  evaluating its case, preparing for trial, or facilitating a settlement.” (Glenfed  Development Corp. v. Superior Court (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 1113, 1117). “On  receipt of a response to requests for admissions, the party requesting  admissions may move for an order compelling a further response if that party  deems that . . . (1) An answer to a particular request is evasive or incomplete  [and/or that] (2) An objection to a particular request is without merit or too  general.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.290, subd. (a).) “On  receipt of a response to interrogatories, the propounding party may move for an  order compelling a further response if the propounding party deems that . . .  (1) An answer to a particular interrogatory is evasive or incomplete[,] (2) An  exercise of the option to produce documents under Section 2030.230 is  unwarranted or the required specification of those documents is inadequate[,  and/or that] (3) An objection to an interrogatory is without merit or too  general.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (a).)  As to requests for admissions and  interrogatories, the responding party has the burden of  justifying the objections to the requests. (Coy  v. Superior Court (1962) 58 Cal.2d 210, 220-221.) “On receipt of a response to a demand for  inspection, copying, testing, or sampling, the demanding party may move for an  order compelling further response to the demand if the demanding party deems  that. . . (1) A statement of compliance with the demand is incomplete[,] (2) A  representation of inability to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive  [and/or that] (3) An objection in the response is without merit or too  general.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a).)  A motion to compel further responses to a demand for  inspection or production of documents must “set forth specific facts showing  good cause justifying the discovery sought by the demand.” (Code Civ. Proc., §  2031.310, subd. (b)(1).) If the moving party has shown good cause for the  production of documents, the burden is on the objecting party to justify the  objections. (Kirkland v. Superior Court  (2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 92, 98.)    All  of the aforementioned discovery motions require a meet and confer declaration stating  “facts showing a reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal resolution of  each issue presented by the motion.” (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2016.040, 2033.290,  subd. (b)(1), 2030.300, subd. (b)(1),  2031.310, subd. (b)(2).) “In  lieu of a separate statement required under the California Rules of Court, the  court may allow the moving party to submit a concise outline of the discovery  request and each response in dispute.” (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2033.290, subd.  (b)(2), 2030.300, subd. (b)(2), 2031.310,  subd. (b)(3).) Notice  of the motions must be provided “within 45 days of the service of the verified  response, or any supplemental verified response” or by “any specific later date”  to which the parties have agreed in writing. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300,  subd. (c); 2031.310,  subd. (c).) “The  court shall impose a monetary sanction . . . against any party, person, or  attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel further  response [for admissions, to interrogatories, or to a demand], unless it finds  that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or  that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code  Civ. Proc., §§ 2033.290, subd. (d), 2030.300, subd. (d), 2031.310, subd.  (h).)   Discussion Plaintiff brings six motions to compel further  responses and/or documents from Defendants, each of which the Court addresses  in turn.[FN1]   Motion 1: Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Further  Responses from Renew Health to Request for Admissions  Plaintiff  first moves the Court for an order compelling Renew Health to provide further  verified responses to Plaintiff’s Requests for Admissions, Set No. One (i.e.,  No. 1). Plaintiff also seeks monetary sanctions against Renew Health and its  attorneys of record, jointly and severally, in the amount of $3,610.00. Request  No. 1 reads as follows: “Please admit that you are aware of no documents which  you contend evidence the responding party having been adequately capitalized  during the residency of the plaintiff in the facility.”  Renew  Health provided an objections-only response. Renew Health asserts that the  request is irrelevant, overbroad, unduly burdensome, violates its right to  privacy, and violates Civil Code section 3295.[FN2] As  to relevance, the Court disagrees that the requested information is irrelevant.  Plaintiff has alleged that he suffered stage II+ coccyx pressure sore and Stage  III+ left heel pressure sore while under the facility’s care; that Renew Health  is the facility’s “owner[], operator[], parent company, and/or management  company . . . and actively participated and controlled the business of the  FACILITY and thus provided long-term professional and custodial care as a  24-hour skilled nursing facility”; and that the facility’s misconduct, which led  to Plaintiffs’ injuries, was the direct result and product of financial  limitations imposed upon the facility. (See FAC ¶¶ 3, 8, 9, 11 and 132.) The  Operative Complaint also includes allegations of alter ego and single  enterprise. (Id., ¶¶ 12 and 13.) Inadequate capitalization may be  considered as a factor in an alter ego analysis. (Automotriz Del Golfo De  California S.A. De C.V. v. Resnick (1957) 47 Cal.2d 792, 797.) Accordingly,  the requested information is relevant as it “might reasonably assist [Plaintiff]  in evaluating [his] case, preparing for trial, or facilitating a settlement.” (Glenfed  Development Corp., supra, 53 Cal.App.4th at 1117).  The  Court also overrules the objections based on undue burden and overbreadth. The  request merely seeks a response of “admit” or “deny” and is expressly limited  to the time period of Plaintiff’s residency at the facility. As  to Renew Health’s objection based on Civil Code section 3295, the Court  disagrees that a response of “admit” or “deny,” without more, would somehow  divulge evidence of profit or financial condition prohibited from disclosure by  that section. More fundamentally, disclosure is warranted here given the nature  of Plaintiff’s case. While “the party against whom the discovery is sought  should be afforded the full benefit of Civil Code section 3295” where “the only  reason for seeking financial information is to give a tactical edge” to the  requesting party “by allowing that party the benefit of pressure in settlement  negotiations by threat or implication of disclosure,” disclosure should “not be  denied . . . so easily” where “the financial information goes to the heart of  the cause of action itself.” (Rawnsley v. Superior Court (1986) 183 Cal.App.3d 86,  91 [“Unlike the situation in which a plaintiff seeks to discover a defendant’s  financial status solely for the purpose of assessing a punitive damages claim,  the documents sought by petitioner were fundamental to his case.”].)  Here,  Plaintiff does not seek the information for the purposes of punitive damages  and the information sought “goes to the heart” of Plaintiff’s elder abuse and  negligence causes of action. Plaintiff seeks financial information in an  attempt to prove Defendants’ “policy to systematically withhold care from  residents in favor of profit maximization,” which allegedly led to Plaintiff’s  injuries. (FAC, ¶ 11.) The  Court also disagrees that a response of “admit” or “deny” would invade privacy  “to the extent that the information sought constitute[d] disclosure of  unintended third parties.”[FN3] Accordingly,  the motion is granted. Renew Health is directed to provide a further, Code-compliant  response to Request No. 1 within 20 days from the date of the notice of ruling.  As  to Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions against Renew Health and its  attorneys of record, jointly and severally, in the amount of $3,610.00, the  Court grants the request but orders that the amount be reduced to $935. Utilizing  a Lodestar approach, and in view of the totality of the circumstances, the Court  finds that the total and reasonable amount of attorney’s fees and costs  incurred for the work performed in connection with the pending motion is  $935.00 [i.e., 1.5 hours at $150.00/hour, plus 1.5 hours at $350.00/hour, plus  $60.00 filing fee, plus $125.00 court reporter fee ($750.00 divided by 6  motions)]. Sanctions are payable within 30 days from the date of the notice of  ruling.   Motion 2: Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Further  Responses from Renew Health to Form Interrogatories  Plaintiff  next moves the Court for an order compelling Renew Health to provide further  verified responses to Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatories, Set No. One (i.e., Nos.  12.1, 12.3, 12.6 and 17.1). Plaintiff also seeks monetary sanctions against  Renew Health and its attorneys of record, jointly and severally, in the amount  of $4,110.00.  At  the outset, the Court notes that while the instant motion purports to seek  further responses to Nos. 12.1, 12.3, 12.6 and 17.1, the only interrogatory  specifically addressed in the California Rules of Court rule 3.1345  accompanying separate statement is No. 17.1. Accordingly, the motion is  summarily denied as to Nos. 12.1, 12.3 and 12.6.  As  to No. 17.1, the motion is granted, based on the analysis set forth in  connection with the first motion. The only Request for Admission identified  with respect to Form Interrogatory No. 17.1 is No. 1. The Court has ruled that  a further response to No. 1 is warranted; as such, a further response to Form  Interrogatory No. 17.1 is likewise warranted.  Renew  Health is to provide a further, Code-compliant response to No. 17.1 within 20  days from the date of the notice of ruling.  As  to Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions, the Court grants the request but  reduces the amount of $935. Utilizing a Lodestar approach, and in view of the  totality of the circumstances, the Court finds that the total and reasonable  amount of attorney’s fees and costs incurred for the work performed in  connection with the pending motion is $935.00 [i.e., 1.5 hours at $150.00/hour,  plus 1.5 hours at $350.00/hour, plus $60.00 filing fee, plus $125.00 court  reporter fee ($750.00 divided by 6 motions)]. Sanctions are payable within 30  days from the date of the notice of ruling.    Motion 3: Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Further  Responses from Renew Health to Special Interrogatories          Plaintiff  moves the Court for an order compelling Renew Health to provide further  verified responses to Plaintiff’s Special Interrogatories, Set No. One (i.e.,  No. 15). Plaintiff also seeks monetary sanctions against Renew Health and its  attorneys of record, jointly and severally, in the amount of $3,610.00.  No.  15 reads as follows: “Please designate each document which you contend  evidences the responding party having been adequately capitalized during the  time period of the residency of Ruben Olague in the facility.” The  motion is granted, based on the analysis set forth in connection with  Plaintiff’s first motion.[FN4] Moreover,  it is unclear to the Court how simply providing a description of the existence  of documents (versus disclosing the content of the documents) would divulge any  information of profit or financial condition. Renew  Health is to provide a further, Code-compliant response to Special  Interrogatory No. 15 within 20 days from the date of the notice of ruling.  As  to Plaintiff’s request for sanctions, the Court grants the request but reduces  the amount to $935. Utilizing a Lodestar approach, and in view of the totality  of the circumstances, the Court finds that the total and reasonable amount of  attorney’s fees and costs incurred for the work performed in connection with  the pending motion is $935.00 [i.e., 1.5 hours at $150.00/hour, plus 1.5 hours  at $350.00/hour, plus $60.00 filing fee, plus $125.00 court reporter fee  ($750.00 divided by 6 motions)]. Sanctions are payable within 30 days from the  date of the notice of ruling.    Motion 4: Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Further  Responses and Documents from Renew Health to Request for Identification and  Production of Documents  Plaintiff  moves the Court for an order compelling Renew Health to provide further  verified responses to Plaintiff’s Request for Production of Documents, Set No.  One (i.e., No. 86). Plaintiff also seeks monetary sanctions against Renew  Health and its attorneys of record, jointly and severally, in the amount of  $3,610.00.  No. 86 reads as follows: “Please produce all  documents which you contend evidence the responding party having been  adequately capitalized during the time period of the residency of Ruben Olague  in the facility.”  The  motion is granted, based on the analysis set forth in connection with the first  motion. [FN5] Accordingly, Renew Health is to  provide a further, Code-compliant response to Request for Production of  Documents No. 86 within 20 days from the date of the notice of ruling. As  to Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions, the Court orders sanctions in  the reduced amount of $935. Utilizing a Lodestar approach, and in view of the  totality of the circumstances, the Court finds that the total and reasonable  amount of attorney’s fees and costs incurred for the work performed in  connection with the pending motion is $935.00 [i.e., 1.5 hours at $150.00/hour,  plus 1.5 hours at $350.00/hour, plus $60.00 filing fee, plus $125.00 court  reporter fee ($750.00 divided by 6 motions)]. Sanctions are payable within 30  days from the date of the notice of ruling.     Motion 5: Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Further  Responses from Inland Valley to Special Interrogatories  Plaintiff  moves the Court for an order compelling Inland Valley to provide further  verified responses to Plaintiff’s Special Interrogatories, Set No. One (i.e.,  Nos. 14, 16, 29-35, 38, 40, 41 and 44-46). Plaintiff also seeks monetary  sanctions against Inland Valley and its attorneys of record, jointly and  severally, in the amount of $4,110.00.  Nos.  14 and 16 ask Inland Valley to identify each individual who made any entry in  the facility “Baseline Care Plan” form/“SBAR 4.0 Communication Form,”  respectively, as to Ruben Olague.  No  29 asks Inland Valley to identify each individual who made any entry into the  “Departmental Notes” relating to the Plaintiff during Plaintiff’s residency at  the facility.  Nos.  30 and 31 ask Inland Valley to identify each person who participated in the  provision of physical therapy/occupational therapy, respectively, to Plaintiff  during Plaintiff’s residency at the facility.  Nos.  32-34 ask Inland Valley to identify each person who was employed by the  facility as a nurse aide/registered nurse/licensed vocational nurse,  respectively, during the time Plaintiff was a facility resident.  No.  35 asks Inland Valley to identify each person who was employed by the facility  in the social services department during the time Plaintiff was a facility  resident.  No.  38 asks Inland Valley to identify each Director of Staff Development of the  facility during the time Plaintiff was a facility resident.  No.  40 asks Inland Valley to identify each individual member of the facility’s  governing body during the time Plaintiff was a facility resident.  No.  41 asks Inland Valley to identify each member of the facility “patient care  committee: which is responsible to ‘establish policies governing the following  services: physician, dental, nursing, dietetic, pharmaceutical, health records,  housekeeping, activity programs. . .’ consistent with the provisions of 22  California Code of Regulations § 72525 during the residency of PLAINTIFF  in the facility.”  No.  44 asks Inland Valley to identify each individual who provided services to the  facility on behalf of any named defendant herein during the January 1, 2023  through June 21, 2023 time period.  At issue in Nos. 14,  16, 29-35, 38, 40, 41 and 44 is the  parties’ dispute regarding the handling of contact information for witnesses  identified in the above requests.  Inland  Valley asserts that it should not be  compelled to disclose the contact information of current employees and that  these individuals may be contacted through Inland Valley’s counsel. At the hearing, the Court would  like to hear further from Inland Valley’s counsel as to why Inland Valley is  not receptive to entering into the stipulation proffered by Plaintiff’s counsel  Stephen Garcia (“Garcia”) in this regard (Garcia Moving Decl., ¶ 15, Exh. 3),  particularly since Inland Valley’s  counsel has in “well in excess of twenty (20) occasions” agreed to the use of  same. (Garcia Reply Decl., ¶¶ 2 and 3, Exh. 2.) The proposed Stipulation, in  the Court’s view, appears to strike a fair balance between safeguarding the  contact information of current employees while providing Plaintiff with the  contact information of such employees in the event their employment  relationship with Inland Valley ceases  for any reason. The Court will hear further from counsel in this regard at the  time of the hearing. The  Court will otherwise deny the motion with respect to Nos. 45 and 46. No.  45 asks Inland Valley to identify each resident of the facility during the time  period(s) in which Plaintiff was a facility resident.  No.  46 asks Inland Valley to identify the responsible party for each resident of  the facility during the time period(s) in which Plaintiff was a facility  resident.  The  Court agrees that disclosure of such information is prohibited by the Health  Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), which prohibits  the disclosure of “protected health information.” (45 C.F.R. § 164.502(a).)  “Protected health information” is defined as “individually identifiable health  information” (Id. at § 160.103), which in turn is defined as  “information that. . .[r]elates to the past, present, or future physical or  mental health or condition of an individual; the provision of health care to an  individual; or the past, present, or future payment for the provision of health  care to an individual; and (i) That identifies the individual; or (ii) With  respect to which there is a reasonable basis to believe the information can be  used to identify the individual.” (Id.)  “A covered entity may determine that health information is  not individually identifiable health information only if: . . .  (2)(i) The following identifiers of the  individual or of relatives, employers, or household members of the individual,  are removed: (A) Names; (B) All geographic subdivisions  smaller than a State, including street address, city, county, precinct, zip  code. . .  (D) Telephone numbers; (E) Fax numbers; (F) Electronic mail addresses; (G) Social security numbers . . . (Q) Full face photographic images  and any comparable images; and (R) Any other unique identifying  number, characteristic, or code, except as permitted by paragraph (c) of this  section . . .”  (45 C.F.R. § 164.514).  As  Inland Valley points out, there is a reasonable basis to believe that  responsible parties’ contact information can be used to identify residents,  particularly where the responsible party is a relative of the resident, often  with the same last name. Accordingly,  the Court denies the motion as to Requests Nos. 45 and 46 and will hear further  from the parties as to the other requests at the hearing. The Court is not  inclined to award sanctions as to this motion.    Motion  6: Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Further Responses and Documents from Inland  Valley for Request for Identification and Production of Documents  Plaintiff  moves the Court for an order compelling Inland Valley to provide further  verified responses to Plaintiff’s Requests for Production of Documents, Set No.  One (i.e., Nos. 1, 22-30, 32, 38-40, 48, 56, 62-69, 78 and 79). Plaintiff also  seeks monetary sanctions against Inland Valley and its attorneys of record,  jointly and severally, in the amount of $4,110.00.  At the outset, Inland Valley represents in  opposition that it served Code-compliant responses to Nos. 64 and 65. It also  represents that it served supplemental responses on August 27, 2024, as to Nos.  22-30, 32, 38-40, 62, 63, 66-69, 78 and 79, as well as a privilege log, and  that the motion should now be moot except as to Nos. 1 and 56.   Plaintiff agrees that the motion would be moot as to  Nos. 38-40, 64, 65 and 69 if Inland Valley had provided verifications to  its supplemental responses served on August 27, 2024, which it failed to do. At  the hearing, counsel for Inland Valley should address whether or not  verifications for the above requests have been provided. Plaintiff disagrees that the motion is otherwise  moot. Plaintiff complains that Inland Valley is standing on its objections as  to Nos. 1, 62, and 63, that Inland Valley failed to produce a “good number of  the promised documents,” and that as to Nos. 22-30, not only were the promised  documents not produced but the privilege log is deficient.  Based on the above representations, the following  analysis is limited to Nos. 1, 22-30, 32, 48, 56, 62, 63, 66, 68, 78 and 79.  The  Court notes that No. 48, while identified in the notice of motion, is not  addressed in Plaintiff’s California Rules of Court rule 3.1345 accompanying  separate statement. The motion is thus summarily denied as to No. 48.  Request No. 1 asks Inland Valley to provide all  applicable insurance agreements and policies, which Inland Valley agreed to do.  Inland Valley, however, produced a redacted copy of the policy, which includes  redaction of all additionally named insureds. Inland Valley contends that  Plaintiff’s request for an unredacted copy violates third party privacy rights;  this argument, however, is not well-taken, given Inland Valley’s statement that  “[i]nformation regarding any potential  overlap in ownership of Defendant and another facility is publicly available  information and reflected in the Long-Term Care Facility Integrated Disclosure  and Medi-Cal Cost Report which was previously produced to Plaintiff.” (Opp. Sep  State., 8:26-28). Production of an unredacted copy of the policy is warranted.  Request  No. 32 seeks the facility’s 24 Hour Communication Log pertaining to the  facility’s operations during the time period Plaintiff was a resident there. Inland  Valley agreed to produce this log but redacted acuity information. Inland  Valley represents that it supplemented this request, such that the issue is now  moot; however, Plaintiff advises that the only documents produced in Inland  Valley’s supplemental response as to No. 32 was 23 pages of a document entitled  “Punch Detail Audit Log,” rather than the 24 Hour Communication Log with the  acuity information unredacted. A further response is warranted. The  Court has reviewed Inland Valley’s supplemental responses to Nos. 22-30. The Court  agrees that these responses do not contain a statement of compliance as per  Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.220.[FN6] Further,  it appears to the Court from the July 29, 2024 deposition excerpt of Inland  Valley’s person most knowledgeable (“PMK”) attached as Exhibit 4 to Garcia’s  moving declaration that internal trending information exists which was not  produced and which would not appear to be protected from discovery pursuant to  Evidence Code section 1157[FN7],  inasmuch as the PMK testified that this information is given to staff outside  of committees. Further,  the Court has reviewed Inland Valley’s privilege log concurrently produced with  its supplemental responses for Nos. 22-30, 62 and 63. (Isfeld Decl., ¶ 5, Exh.  B.) Admittedly,  “[t]he precise information required for an adequate privilege log will vary  from case to case based on the privileges asserted and the underlying  circumstances.” (Catalina Island Yacht Club v. Superior Court (2015) 242  Cal.App.4th 1116, 1130.) That said, “a privilege log typically should provide  the identity and capacity of all individuals who authored, sent, or received  each allegedly privileged document, the document’s date, a brief description of  the document and its contents or subject matter sufficient to determine whether  the privilege applies, and the precise privilege or protection asserted.” (Id.)  Here, Inland Valley’s privilege log is insufficient in terms of information for  the Court and Plaintiff’s counsel to determine whether the “Quarterly Quality  Assurance Performance Improvement Meeting Minutes” are privileged. Further  responses are warranted, as is a further privilege log.  Plaintiff  represents that Inland Valley falsely stated that it provided supplemental  responses to Nos. 66 and 67. Plaintiff is wrong; further responses were provided.  Still, the further response to No. 66 does not comply with Code of Civil  Procedure section 2031.220. A further response is warranted. The Court also  takes issue with the apparent inconsistency in Inland Valley’s original and  further responses to No. 67; Inland Valley initially responded that it was  “unable to comply with this request as responsive documents have never  existed,” but then subsequently responded that “[f]ollowing a diligent search  and reasonable inquiry, no responsive emails have been located. A diligent  search and reasonable inquiry is ongoing and if non-privileged, non-protected  responsive emails are located they will be provided.” Further responses are  warranted.  It  is evident to the Court that Inland Valley has not produced and/or identified  all documents responsive to No. 56 in compliance with Code of Civil Procedure  section 2031.220. (See also, Garcia Decl., ¶ 2, Exh. 4, 29:15-31:12).[FN8] Inland  Valley’s response to No. 68 also reflects non-compliance with this Code  provision. Further responses are warranted.  Inland  Valley supplemented its response to No. 78. No further response is warranted. Inland  Valley’s further response to No. 79 is deficient, in that it is not accompanied  by a privilege log. A further response is warranted.  The  motion, then, appears to be moot as to Nos. 38-40, 64, 65 and 69, provided that Inland Valley provides  verifications at or before the time of the hearing. The motion is denied  as to Nos. 48 and 78 and granted as to Nos. 1, 22-30, 56, 62, 63, 66-68 and 79.  Inland Valley is to provide further, Code-compliant responses to Request for  Production of Documents Nos. 1, 22-30, 56, 62, 63, 66-68 and 79 and to provide  a further privilege log with respect to any requests for which any responsive  documents are being withheld on the basis of privilege within 20 days from the  date of the notice of ruling.  Based  on the totality of the circumstances, the Court is not inclined to award  sanctions as to this motion. Conclusion For the foregoing reasons, the Court rules on the  motions as follows: Motion 1:  The Court grants the motion as to Request for Admission No. 1. Renew Health is  directed to provide a further, Code-compliant response to Plaintiff’s Request No.  1. Sanctions are awarded in the amount of $935.
