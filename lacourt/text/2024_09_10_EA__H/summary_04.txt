And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's application for default judgment without prejudice. The plaintiff, Gref GG Eastland Center, LP, filed a complaint against the defendant, West Covina Fire Wings, Inc. dba Fire Wings, for unlawful detainer. The defendant's default was entered on April 2, 2024. The plaintiff's application for default judgment is denied because the lease agreement does not clearly indicate whether the security deposit has been applied or credited back to the defendant. Additionally, the court is unclear how the attorney, John P. Byrne, gained knowledge of certain facts and calculations. The judge is requesting that the plaintiff provide a revised default judgment packet that addresses these issues.
