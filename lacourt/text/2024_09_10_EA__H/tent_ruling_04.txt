 Case Number:  24PSCV00328    Hearing Date:   September 10, 2024    Dept:  H Plaintiff Gref GG Eastland Center, LP’s Application  for Default Judgment is DENIED without prejudice. Background This is an unlawful detainer action regarding the commercial property  located at 2851 E. Eastland Center Drive, Suite #5, aka Suite #162, West  Covina, CA 91791. On January 30, 2024, Plaintiff Gref GG Eastland Center, LP (“Plaintiff”)  filed a complaint, asserting a cause of action against Defendant West Covina  Fire Wings, Inc. dba Fire Wings (“Defendant”) and Does 1-10 for unlawful detainer. On April 2, 2024, Defendant’s default was entered. Pending before the Court is Plaintiff’s Application for Default Judgment.  For the reasons stated herein, the Court denies that application without  prejudice and directs Plaintiff to file a revised default judgment packet. Discussion In denying Plaintiff’s Application for Default Judgment, the Court notes  the following defects:  1.       On June 11, 2024, the  Honorable Peter A. Hernandez adopted his tentative ruling denying Plaintiff’s application for default judgment, which  stated, in pertinent part, as follows:  “The court notes that the lease agreement (attached as Exhibit 4c to the  Declaration of James Sattler provides for a security deposit of $11,207.17 (see pg. ii). It is unclear to the court whether or not the security deposit has been applied to the amount outstanding or credited back to Defendant. The court requests that a supplemental declaration be provided in this regard.” On July 25, 2024, attorney John P. Byrne (“Byrne”) filed a supplemental  declaration purporting to address the Court’s query. However, it is unclear to  this Court how Byrne would have personal knowledge of the facts set forth in  Paragraphs 3 and 4 or of Exhibit B thereto. 2.       Judge Hernandez’s June 11,  2024 ruling also “request[ed] that Plaintiff explain how the $11,590.00 monthly rent was calculated.” Again, the Court  is unclear how Byrne would have personal knowledge of the facts set forth in  Paragraph 5 of his supplemental declaration filed July 25, 2024. The Court also  requests that Plaintiff identify the specific provisions of the lease (in  addition to Lease Article 4.2) that were used to calculate the retail insurance  and prorated real estate taxes. Accordingly, the Court denies Plaintiff’s Application for  Default Judgment without prejudice and directs Plaintiff to filed a revised  default judgment packet that addresses the aforementioned issues.
