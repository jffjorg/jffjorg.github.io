The Honorable Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of 3800 West Sixth Street, LLC v. Steven C. Kim, Case No. 22STCV21799. The case involves motions to compel further responses from the Plaintiffs to discovery requests, including special interrogatories and requests for production of documents. The Judge has denied the Defendant's motion to compel further responses to the special interrogatories as moot, as the Plaintiffs have already supplemented their responses. The Judge has granted the Defendant's motions to compel further responses to the requests for production of documents, ordering the Plaintiffs to produce all responsive non-confidential documents within 30 days, and to supplement their responses regarding non-existent documents and documents not in their possession, custody, or control. The Judge has also denied the Defendant's request for monetary sanctions, finding that both parties bear responsibility for the dispute and that any award of sanctions would be unjust. The Court has ordered the parties to meet-and-confer and file a joint status report, and has advanced the Plaintiff's pending discovery motions and motion for a protective order to March 14, 2024.
