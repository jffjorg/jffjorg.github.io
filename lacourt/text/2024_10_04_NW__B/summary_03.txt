The court holds that the defendants have met their initial burden of showing that the plaintiff's claims are barred by the doctrine, and that the plaintiff has failed to provide evidence of a triable issue of fact as to the defendants' primary assumption of risk defense. Additionally, the court finds that the alleged oil spill was trivial or minor in nature, and therefore, the defendants had no duty to warn the plaintiff of it.
