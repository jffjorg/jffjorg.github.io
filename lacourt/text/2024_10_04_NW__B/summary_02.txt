And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion to transfer the venue of the case from the Los Angeles County Superior Court Van Nuys East Courthouse to the Los Angeles County Superior Court Pasadena Courthouse. The case arises from a motor vehicle collision on August 3, 2018, and the plaintiff seeks to transfer the venue to promote judicial efficiency and convenience. The court finds that the case was originally assigned to the wrong courthouse, and that the parties stipulated to transfer venue but the court denied the stipulation. The court further finds that the Los Angeles County Superior Court Pasadena Courthouse is a proper venue for the case under California Code of Civil Procedure section 395(a). The motion is granted, and the case will be transferred to the Pasadena courthouse.
