COMPLAINT

TRIAL
  DATE: DECEMBER 16, 2024



 
I.      
BACKGROUND  
            On December 10, 2021, Plaintiff
Christian Manuel Esparza, III (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint in the instant
action against Defendants GCHMP, Inc. (“GCHMP”) and Vista Del Loma, LLC
(“Vista”)(collectively “Defendants”) alleging two causes of action: (1)
premises liability and (2) general negligence. Plaintiff alleges that, on or
about December 13, 2020, he fell while skateboarding on Vista’s property due to
Defendants’ negligence and suffered serious injuries as a result.
            On May 31, 2024, Defendants filed
the instant motion for summary judgment on both causes of action.
            On June 6, 2024, the matter was
assigned to the Honorable Judge Moskowitz in Department B of Van Nuys
Courthouse East.
            On September 20, 2024, Plaintiff
filed their opposition.
            On September 26, 2024, Defendants
filed their reply.
 
II.      
MOTION
FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
            Defendants move for summary judgment
on Plaintiff’s complaint for (1) premises liability; and (2) general
negligence. Defendants allege that Plaintiff’s claims fail as a matter of law
because (1) they are barred by primary assumption of risk; (2) Plaintiff cannot
prove the essential element of notice in his premises liability claim; and (3)
Defendants had no duty to warn Plaintiff of a trivial minor defect on their
property. (See Motion pp. 4, 7, and 10.)
 
III.      
LEGAL
STANDARDS 
            In reviewing a motion for summary
judgment, the Court must apply a three-step analysis: (1) identify the issues
framed by the pleadings; (2) determine whether the moving party has met his or
her initial burden; and (3) determine whether the opposition has demonstrated
the existence of a triable, material factual issue.  (Hinesley v. Oakshade Town Center
(2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 289, 294.)  “[T]he
initial burden is always on the moving party to make a prima facie showing that
there are no triable issues of material fact.” 
(Scalf v. D.B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510,
1519.) A defendant moving for summary judgment or summary adjudication has met
his or her burden of showing that a cause of action has no merit if the party
has shown that one or more elements of the cause of action . . . cannot be
established, or that there is a complete defense to the cause of action.” (Code
Civ. Proc. § 437c, subd. (p)(2).)
            A moving defendant may satisfy the
initial burden to show that one or more elements cannot be established by
“presenting evidence that conclusively negates an element of the plaintiff's
cause of action or by relying on the plaintiff's factually devoid discovery
responses to show that the plaintiff does not possess, and cannot reasonably
obtain, evidence to establish that element.” (Schmidt v. Citibank, N.A.
(2018) 28 Cal.App.5th 1109, 1119; Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co.
(2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 856 [It is insufficient for the defendant to merely
point out the absence of evidence.]; Gaggero v. Yura (2003) 108
Cal.App.4th 884, 891.) ) The defendant must present evidence… showing that
plaintiff does not have and cannot reasonably obtain evidence to support his or
her claim.” (Ibid.)
            Unless and until a defendant meets
that burden, the plaintiff has no burden to present controverting evidence. (Consumer
Cause, Inc. v. SmileCare (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 454, 468 [“There is no
obligation on the opposing party . . . to establish anything by affidavit
unless and until the moving party has by affidavit stated facts establishing
every element . . . necessary to sustain a judgment in his favor.”].) If a
defendant fails to meet that burden, summary judgment must be denied, even if
the plaintiff fails to file an opposition and fails to proffer any evidence.
On
the other hand, if the defendant “has met that burden, the burden shifts to the
plaintiff . . . to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts
exists as to the cause of action or a defense thereto.” (CCP § 437c, subd.
(p)(2).) The plaintiff may not merely rely on allegations or denials in its
pleadings to show that a triable issue of material fact exists, but instead
“shall set forth the specific facts showing that a triable issue of material
fact exists as to the cause of action.” (Ibid.) “If the plaintiff cannot
do so, summary judgment should be granted.” (Avivi v. Centro Medico Urgente
Medical Center (2008) 159 Cal.App.4th 463, 467.)     
 
IV.      
DISCUSSION 
Evidentiary
Objections
            Defendants’ September 26, 2024, objections to the
declaration of Jeffrey Bonsall (“Bonsall”) are sustained as to Nos. 1, 2, 3,
and 4. Bonsall relies on improper hearsay as the basis for his opinions. (Cal.
Evid. Code § 801; see People v. Sanchez (2016) 63 Cal.4th 665, 686.)
            Defendants’ objections to
Plaintiff’s May 1, 2023, deposition are sustained as to Nos. 6 and 12 as
Plaintiff’s deposition clearly and unequivocally contradicts his prior
admissions in discovery responses. Nos. 9, 10, and 11 are also sustained for
speculation. Nos. 5, 7, and 8 are overruled.
            Defendants’ objection to Plaintiff’s
deposition transcript of Cathy Sanchez is sustained. The transcript is not
properly authenticated pursuant to Cal. Evid. Code §§ 1400 and 1410 and is
therefore inadmissible. Accordingly, objection Nos. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19,
20, 21, 22, and 23 are sustained.
            Defendants’ objection to Plaintiff’s
deposition transcript of Katie Morris is sustained for the same reason
(improper authentication pursuant to Cal. Evid. Code §§ 1400 and 1410.)
Accordingly, objection Nos. 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36,
37, and 38 are sustained.
 
Defendants’
Burden
            Defendants meet their initial
burden.
            Defendants argue that Plaintiff’s
causes of action are barred by primary assumption of risk because Plaintiff’s
skateboarding carried an inherent risk of incurring injury from falls.
The
primary assumption of risk doctrine was developed in recognition that some
activities are inherently dangerous such that the defendant has no duty to
protect the plaintiff from those inherent dangers.  (Nalwa v. Cedar
Fair, L.P. (2012) 55 Cal.4th 1148, 1154; Knight v. Jewett (1992) 3
Cal.4th 296, 308.)  “The primary assumption of risk doctrine rests on a
straightforward policy foundation: the need to avoid chilling vigorous
participation in or sponsorship of recreational activities by imposing a tort
duty to eliminate or reduce the risks of harm inherent in those
activities.”  (Nalwa, at p. 1156.)  “It operates on the
premise that imposing such a legal duty ‘would work a basic alteration—or cause
abandonment’ of the activity.”  (Ibid. (quoting Kahn v. East
Side Union High School Dist. (2003) 31 Cal.4th 990, 1003).)  “Where
the doctrine applies to a recreational activity, operators, instructors and
participants in the activity owe other participants only the duty not to act so
as to increase the risk of injury over that inherent in the
activity.”  (Ibid. at 1154 (emphasis in original).)  “When the
doctrine applies, the plaintiff’s assumption of the risk acts as a complete bar
to liability.”  (Moser v. Ratinoff (2003) 105 Cal.App.4th 1211,
1219.)  “Determining whether the primary assumption of risk doctrine
applies is a legal question to be decided by the court.”  (Ibid. at
1217.) 
            “[T]he primary assumption of risk
doctrine is not limited to activities classified as sports, but applies as well
to other recreational activities ‘involving an inherent risk of injury to
voluntary participants . . . where the risk cannot be eliminated without
altering the fundamental nature of the activity.’”  (Nalwa, supra,
55 Cal.4th at p. 1156 (quoting Beninati v. Black Rock City, LLC (2009)
175 Cal.App.4th 650, 658).)  “Judges deciding inherent risk questions
under Knight may consider not only their own or common experience with
the recreational activity involved but may also consult case law, other
published materials, and documentary evidence introduced by the parties on a
motion for summary judgment.”  (Ibid. at 1158.) 
            The primary assumption of risk
doctrine applies to Plaintiff’s skateboarding. Skateboarding is an activity
covered by the primary risk of assumption doctrine as it “is done for enjoyment
or thrill, requires physical exertion as well as elements of skill, and
involves a challenge containing a potential risk of injury.” (Calhoon v.
Lewis (2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 108, 115 [quoting Bjork v. Mason (2000)
77 Cal.App.4th 544, 550.]) Imposing a duty on most property owners to “guard
against injuries to those voluntarily participating in skateboarding would
change the nature of skateboarding.” (Ibid. at p. 117.) “As with skiing,
the existence of obstacles in the environment is part of the thrill of the
sport.” (Ibid.) The most “obvious risk of injury [from skateboarding
comes from] the prospect of falling off the board.” (Bertsch v. Mammoth
Community Water Dist. (2016) 247 Cal.App.4th 1201, 1209.)
            Here, it is undisputed that
Plaintiff fell while skateboarding. (Undisputed Separate Statement of Fact
“USSF” Nos. 1 and 9. [Complaint at P.4.]) Therefore, Defendants have met their
initial burden by showing that Plaintiff was participating in an activity
covered by the primary risk of assumption doctrine and, as a result, his claims
for premises liability and general negligence are barred.
 
Plaintiff’s
Burden
            The burden now shifts to Plaintiff to show a triable
issue of fact as to Defendants’ primary assumption of risk defense.
            Plaintiff argues that the primary
assumption of risk doctrine does not cover the underlying incident because, at
the time of Plaintiff’s fall, he was using his skateboard as a means of
transportation and not to engage in sport or recreational activity. (Plaintiff’s
Undisputed Separate Statement of Fact “PUSSF” No. 1, Plaintiff Depo. 32:14-18.)
Specifically, Plaintiff claims he used his skateboard to commute from his
mother’s residence to his brother’s residence on the premises. (Ibid.)
            Plaintiff uses Bertsch v. Mammoth
County Community Water District, supra, 247 Cal.App.4th to support their
argument that skateboarding, if used primarily as a means of transportation,
does not fall under the primary assumption of risk. However, in Bertsch,
the Court found that skateboarding was covered by the doctrine when, although
decedent was travelling by skateboard to meet his father, decedent elected to
skateboard down a large hill for purposes of thrill and sport, thus causing his
skateboarding to surpass the primary use of transportation. (Bertsch, at
p. 1209.)
            Here, Plaintiff admits to “puddling”
on his skateboard at the time of injury. (Defendants’ Exhibit List, Ex. C:
Response to Special Interrogatories, Set One, at No. 2.) This response
constitutes an admission against Plaintiff’s own interest and therefore has a
“very high credibility value.” (D’Amico v. Board of Medical Examiners (1974)
11 Cal.3d 1, 21.) “Accordingly, when such an admission becomes relevant to the
determination, on motion for summary judgment, of whether or not there exist
triable issues of Fact . . . between the parties, it is entitled to and should
receive a kind of deference not normally accorded [to] evidentiary allegations
in affidavits.” (Ibid. at 25.) Therefore, Plaintiff fails to set forward
evidence of a triable issue of fact as to Defendants’ primary assumption of
risk defense.
            Even assuming, arguendo,
Plaintiff was riding his skateboard for transport, Plaintiff still does not
provide evidence of a triable issue of fact. Plaintiff alleges Defendants’
negligence caused his fall after he slipped on an oil spill while skateboarding
on a road which Defendants maintain. (PUSSF Nos. 3, 9, and 10.) A property
owner is not liable for damage caused by a minor, trivial, or insignificant
defect in property. (Caloroso v. Hathaway (2004) 122 Cal.App.4th 922,
927.) “If the defect is of such trivial character that it presents no element
of conspicuousness or notoriety, its continued existence does not impart
constructive notice” to property owners. (Barrett v. City of Claremont
(1953) 41 Cal.App.4th 922, 927.) Here, Plaintiff’s only evidence of the alleged
oil spill are photographs of roadway discoloration taken two days after
Plaintiff’s fall. Therefore, Plaintiff has not provided evidence showing that
the alleged defect caused by Defendants’ negligence was not trivial or minor in
nature.
            Accordingly, Plaintiff fails to meet
their burden.
 
V.      
CONCLUSION
            No triable issue of material fact
exists. Accordingly, Defendants’ motion for summary judgment is GRANTED.
            Moving party is ordered to give
notice.
