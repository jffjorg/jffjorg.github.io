BACKGROUND
On
May 24, 2019, Plaintiff Alan Sandleman (“Plaintiff”) brought the present action
against Defendant Jagwinder Singh (“Singh”) and DOES 1 to 50
(“DOES”)(collectively “Defendants”) alleging one cause of action for motor
vehicle negligence.
On
October 9, 2023, Plaintiff filed a notice of settlement.
On
March 7, 2024, Plaintiff filed a first motion to enforce settlement. Singh
opposed the motion. 
On
May 14, 2024, the Court denied the motion as Plaintiff provided no evidence of
a signed settlement agreement between the parties pursuant to CCP § 664.6. 
On
July 15, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant motion to enforce settlement
pursuant to CCP § 664.6. 
On
September 20, 2024, Defendant filed their opposition as well as a request for
$2,025.00 in sanctions against Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel for bringing
this motion in bad faith.
On
September 26, 2024, Plaintiff filed their reply.
 
LEGAL STANDARD
Code Civ. Proc. §664.6
provides, in pertinent part, as follows: “If parties to pending litigation
stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties outside the presence of the court
or orally before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the
court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the
settlement.”  
In hearing a Code Civ. Proc.
§664.6 motion, the trial court may receive evidence, determine disputed facts,
and enter terms of a settlement agreement as a judgment.  (Bowers v.
Raymond J. Lucia Companies, Inc. (2012) 206 Cal.App.4th 724,
732.)  The Court may also receive oral
testimony in addition to declarations. (Kohn v. Jaymar-Ruby, Inc. (1994)
23 Cal.App.4th 1530, 1533.)  
The Court may interpret the
terms and conditions of the settlement (Fiore v. Alvord (1985) 182
Cal.App.3d 561, 566), but the Court may not create material terms of a
settlement, as opposed to deciding what terms the parties themselves have
previously agreed upon.   (Weddington
Productions, Inc. v. Flick (1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 793, 810). 
Strict compliance with the
statutory requirements is necessary before a court can enforce a settlement
agreement under this statute.  (Sully-Miller Contracting Co. v.
Gledson/Cashman Construction, Inc. (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 30, 37.) 
The party seeking to enforce a settlement “must first establish the agreement
at issue was set forth ‘in a writing signed by the parties’ (§ 664.6) or was
made orally before the court.”  (Harris v. Rudin, Richman & Appel
(1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 299, 304.)  
The settlement must include
the signatures of the parties seeking to enforce the agreement, and against
whom enforcement is sought.  (J.B.B. Investment Partners, Ltd. v. Fair
(2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 974, 985.)  “[A] writing is signed by a party if it
is signed by … [a]n attorney who represents the party.”  (Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 664.6(b)(2).)  
 
ANALYSIS
Here, Plaintiff has again failed to provide evidence
of a writing signed by both parties for the court to enforce as required by CCP
§ 664.6. By Plaintiff’s counsel’s own admission, no such signed writing exists.
(Zeesman July 15, 2024 Decl. ¶ 5.) Plaintiff’s counsel alleges that the parties
reached a settlement agreement in mediation, but that Defendant has since failed
to provide a Proposed Release. (Ibid.) There is no written settlement
agreement signed by both parties.
CCP § 664.6 requires strict compliance. (Sully-Miller
Contracting Co. v. Gledson/Cashman Construction, Inc. (2002) 103
Cal.App.4th 30, 37.) “A procedure in which a settlement is evidenced by one
writing signed by both parties minimizes the possibility of . . . dispute[s]
and legitimizes the summary nature of the Section 664.6 procedure.” (Robertson
v. Chen (1996) Cal.App.4th 1290, 1293.) Accordingly, Plaintiff’s motion to
enforce settlement must be denied for failure to comply with the requirements
of CCP § 664.6.
Defendant’s Request for Sanctions
Defendant requests sanctions, in the amount
of $2,025.00, on the grounds that Plaintiff’s disregard for the Court’s May 14,
2024, Minute Order constitutes intentional or negligent misconduct pursuant to
CCP § 128.7. (Opposition pp. 6-7, lines 23-28 and 1-7; Wang Decl. ¶ 14.) 
CCP § 128.7(b) provides that by signing and
filing a pleading, an attorney “is certifying that to the best of the person’s
knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable under
the circumstances, all of the following conditions are met: (1) [i]t is not
being presented primarily for an improper purpose, such as to harass or to
cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation[;] (2)
[t]he claims, defenses, and other legal contentions therein are warranted by
existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for the extension, modification, or
reversal of existing law or the establishment of new law[;] (3) [t]he
allegations and other factual contentions have evidentiary support or, if
specifically so identified, are likely to have evidentiary support after a
reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery[;] (4) [t]he
denials of factual contentions are warranted on the evidence or, if
specifically so identified, are reasonably based on a lack of information or belief.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 128.7(b).) CCP § 128.7 authorizes the court to impose
appropriate sanctions upon attorneys or parties that have violated subsection
(b). (Ibid., § 128.7(c).)
“[T]o obtain sanctions, the moving party must
show the party’s conduct in asserting the claim was objectively unreasonable.” (Peake
v. Underwood (2014) 227 Cal.App.4th 428, 440.) “A claim is
objectively unreasonable if ‘any reasonable attorney would agree that [it] is
totally and completely without merit.’” (Ibid.)
Here, Plaintiff filed a nearly identical
motion to enforce settlement as their March 7, 2024, motion, which was denied
by the Court for the same reason as the instant motion because Plaintiff failed
to provide a signed writing of the settlement agreement as required by CCP §
664.6. (See May 14, 2024, Minute Order.) Despite the Court’s clear
order, Plaintiff has once again failed to provide a signed writing of the
settlement agreement.  Plaintiff’s
instant motion violates CCP § 128.7(b). Defendant has shown that Plaintiff’s
instant claim is completely without merit. Furthermore, Defendant provided a
declaration that demonstrates $2,025.00 as a reasonable amount in attorney’s
fees. (Wang Decl. ¶ 14.) Accordingly, the Court grants sanctions against
Plaintiff’s counsel in the amount of $2,025.00. 
 
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, the Court DENIES Defendant’s
motion to enforce settlement and grants sanctions against Plaintiff’s counsel
in the amount of $2,025.00.  Sanctions to
be paid within 20 days of this Order. 
Moving party is directed to give notice.
