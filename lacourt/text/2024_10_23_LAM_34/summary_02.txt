Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The court denies Defendant ENI-JR286, Inc.'s motion to compel arbitration. The court finds that Defendant failed to pay arbitration fees in a timely manner, which constitutes a material breach of the arbitration agreement. The court also finds that the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) does not preempt California Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.97, which mandates findings of breach and waiver of arbitration. As a result, the court concludes that Defendant waived its right to arbitrate and that the arbitration agreement is no longer enforceable.
