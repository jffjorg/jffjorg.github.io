             Defendant’s motion states that
“on November 5, 2018, Plaintiff willingly and voluntarily executed the
Agreement.” (Motion to Compel Arbitration, at p. 2.) However, the copy of the
arbitration agreement attached as Exhibit A to the Declaration of Blake Fix has
September 5, 2018 as the date the arbitration agreement was executed. This was
Plaintiff’s hiring date with Defendant. 


            [2]       Defendant
does not dispute it failed to pay its filling fees in a timely manner.
