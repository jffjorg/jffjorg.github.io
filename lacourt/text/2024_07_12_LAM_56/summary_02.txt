And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the Motion for Order Authorizing Settlement Under C.C.P. Section 708.440(b) filed by Plaintiff Paula R. Green and has denied the motion. The court lacks jurisdiction to rule on the validity of Plaintiff's attorney's lien and therefore cannot conclude what amount was paid to settle the claims brought by Plaintiff and what funds, if any, would be available to satisfy Lien Claimant's judgment lien. The court also notes that the proposed settlement agreement provides for the deposit of the settlement funds into a blocked interest-bearing account, pending determination by the court of how the funds shall be disbursed as between Plaintiff and Judgment Creditor. The court denies the motion and orders that the parties provide notice of the ruling.
