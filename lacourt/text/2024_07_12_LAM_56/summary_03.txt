And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for reconsideration filed by the defendant, Thomas Edward Waljeski. The motion seeks to increase the amount of sanctions ordered from $2,998.08 to $5,372.08, citing additional deposition costs that were not included in the original moving papers. However, the Judge finds that there is no good cause for reconsideration, as there are no new or different facts, circumstances, or law that were not available to the moving party at the time of the hearing on the original motion. The Judge also finds that the relief requested is not supported by the facts or the law. Therefore, the motion is denied.
