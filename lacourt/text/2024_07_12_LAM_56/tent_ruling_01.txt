On
November 14, 2022, this Court entered an Order and Judgment (the “Judgment”) against
Defendants Jay Prop Investments, LLC and Dank Depot, a Business Entity Unknown
(“Defendants”), based upon its finding that Defendant Jay Prop Investments, LLC
(“JP”) owned certain real property located at 455 E. Alondra Blvd., Gardena,
California 90248-2901 (the “Property”), and that Defendant Dank Depot, which did
not possess a state license to operate a cannabis dispensary, was operating an
illegal cannabis dispensary on the Property. 
The Court found that Defendants had defaulted on the Complaint filed in
the instant action and that after entry of default, was found liable for the
causes of action alleged therein.  
On
May 28, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a Notice of Motion and Motion for Appointment of
Receiver to Enforce Court Judgment (the “Motion”), concurrently with a Request
for Judicial Notice, which is hereby granted, and the Declarations of Mark
Adams and Jessica Cohen in support of the Motion.  No opposition was filed.  
 
Based
upon the Motion and the supporting evidence, as well as on the Judgment, the
Court finds that good cause exists for the issuance of the proposed Order re
Motion for Appointment of Receiver to Enforce Court Judgment submitted by
Plaintiffs.
 
The
Motion is therefore GRANTED.
