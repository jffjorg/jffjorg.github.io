      CASE NO.: 22STCV18964
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: MOTION FOR
  RECONSIDERATION

Dept. 56
 



AND
RELATED CROSS-ACTION
 
MOVING
PARTY: Defendant Thomas Edward Waljeski (“Defendant”)
OPPOSING
PARTY: Plaintiffs
 
Defendant
has filed a motion captioned “Motion for Reconsideration and/or Be [sic] Relieved
of Default” (the “Motion”).  The Motion
itself requests that the Court issue an order “amending the Court’s order of
April 2, 2024” to increase the amount of sanctions ordered from $2,998.08 to
$5,372.08.  The ground stated for this
Motion are that invoices for additional deposition costs were not included in
the moving papers on the original Motion to Compel for which sanctions were
granted.  


 
The Court finds that there is no good
cause for reconsideration of the order, as there are no new or different facts,
circumstances or law that were not available to the moving party at the time of
the hearing on that order. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1008, subd. (a).) Neither
does the Court find that relief pursuant to Code Civ. Proc. §473(a)(1) would be
appropriate, even if such relief had been requested in the Notice of the
Motion, which it was not.  Nor is the
Court able to understand what “default” the Motion seeks to be relieved of as
indicated on the face page of the Motion and nowhere else.  None of the relief requested is supported in
the facts or the law.
 
In
any event, there is no good cause on any ground for this Court to increase the
sanctions awarded, as the Court used its own discretion to determine the
reasonable amount of sanctions to be awarded on the original Motion to Compel
and based its order thereon.  
 
The
Motion is therefore DENIED.
 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
 


 
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at

department does not receive an email and there are no appearances at the
hearing, the motion will be placed off calendar.
