SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of Plaintiffs Sayra Ramirez Munoz
and Martha Guzman’s (Plaintiffs) purchase of a 2022 Hyundai Tucson (the
Vehicle) on 2/12/22.  The Vehicle purportedly
came with an express written warranty provided by Defendant Hyundai Motor
America (Defendant) which is located in Plaintiffs’ Owner’s Handbook &
Warranty Information (Warranty). 
(Ameripour Decl., Ex.3 – NOT ATTACHED).  Defendant contends that the Warranty included
a binding arbitration provision.  Id.  Additionally, on 2/12/22, Plaintiffs enrolled
the Vehicle in Defendant’s Bluelink services. 
(Rao Decl. ¶5).  To enroll in Defendant’s
 Bluelink services, Defendant contends
that customers must agree to the then-effective Bluelink Connected Services
Agreement (CSA), the terms and conditions of which also include a binding
arbitration provision.  (Rao Decl. ¶4,
Ex.2).  
 
Plaintiffs contend that the Vehicle suffers from defects
and nonconformities to warranty which substantially impaired its use, value
and/or safety; that Plaintiffs delivered the Vehicle to Defendant’s authorized
repair facility for repair and Defendant was unable to conform the Vehicle to
the applicable express warranty after a reasonable number of repair attempts.  (See Complaint ¶¶17-19).  Further, Plaintiffs allege that despite the
foregoing, Defendant has failed to replace the Vehicle and/or provide Plaintiffs
with restitution as required under the Song-Beverly Act.  (Complaint ¶20).  Therefore, on 4/15/24, Plaintiffs filed this
action against Defendant for Violation of Song-Beverly Act  - Breach of Express Warranty.  On 5/28/24, Defendant answered the
complaint.  
 
On 8/26/24, Defendant requested that Plaintiffs stipulate
to arbitration; however, Plaintiffs have not agreed to do so.  Therefore, on 8/26/24, Defendant filed and
served the instant motion seeking an order compelling Plaintiffs to arbitrate
all of their claims pursuant to the arbitration agreement and staying this
action pending the outcome of the arbitration. 
Plaintiffs opposed the motion and Defendant filed a reply to the
opposition.    
 
ANALYSIS
 
The motion was originally set for hearing on 10/29/24.  With the filing of the motion, Defendant
failed to include certain evidence relied on in the motion.  Specifically, none of the exhibits referenced
as being attached to the declaration of Ali Ameripour are attached thereto and
the exhibit referenced in the Request for Judicial Notice is not attached
thereto.  To allow the Court to review
all of the evidence relied on by the parties, the hearing was continued to
allow Defendant to file complete copies of the Ameripour declaration and
Request for Judicial Notice, including exhibits.  (See 10/29/24 Minute Order; 11/26/24
Notice of Continuance & Order; 12/11/24 Notice of Court Order Re Motion to
Compel Arbitration).
 
Defendant’s above-mentioned amended documents were due to
be filed and served at least 16 court days before the continued hearing
date.  (See 10/29/24 Minute
Order).
 
Despite the foregoing, Defendant has failed to file the
amended documents permitted in the Court’s 10/29/24 order.  On 1/2/24, Plaintiffs filed their
supplemental opposition as permitted by the Court’s 10/29/24 order which notes
Defendant’s failure to file and serve its amended documents in support of the
motion.  (See 10/29/24 Minute
Order).
 
Defendant has failed to adequately support the motion to
establish that Plaintiffs agreed to arbitrate the dispute which is the subject
of this action.  Without adequate evidence
of such an agreement, the motion must be denied.  See Duffens (2008) 161 CA4th
434, 443; United Steelworkers (1960) 363 U.S. 574, 582; Mundi (9th
Cir. 2009) 555 F.3d 1042, 1045; Engineers & Architects Association
(1994) 30 CA4th 644, 653; Condee (2001) 88 CA4th 215, 218-219. 
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion is denied.
