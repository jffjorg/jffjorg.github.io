SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of a landlord tenant dispute
regarding property located at 13547 Osborne Street in Arleta, California. On
11/4/19, Plaintiff Jamal Salim Nasrallah (Plaintiff) filed this action alleging
causes of action for: (1) forcible entry and (2) forcible detainer against
Padita Ayana and Parawan Ayana. 
 
On 5/10/22, default was entered against Padita Ayana.  Also on 5/10/22, Plaintiff filed a Doe
Amendment naming Padita Ayana as Trustee of the Parawan Ayana Living Trust.  On 5/11/22, pursuant to Plaintiff’s request,
the Court entered a dismissal without prejudice of Parawan Ayana. (See 5/11/22
Minute Order).  On 6/6/22, the Court
entered an order pursuant to the stipulation of the parties setting aside the
default entered against Padita Ayana. 
 
On 12/7/22, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint
which again asserted causes of action for: (1) forcible entry and (2) forcible
detainer.  On 2/28/23, the Court
sustained, in part, Padita Ayana’s demurrer to the First Amended Complaint and
granted Padita Ayana’s motion to strike portions of the First Amended
Complaint, both with leave to amend. (See 2/28/23 Minute Order). On 4/4/23,
Plaintiff filed a Second Amended Complaint for forcible entry against Padita
Ayana, individually (Padita), and as Trustee of the Parawan Ayana Living Trust
(Trustee) (collectively, Defendant).  On
7/25/23, Defendant’s motion to strike portions of the Second Amended Complaint
was denied.  On 8/14/23, Padita filed an
answer.  
 
On 8/15/23, Padita served Plaintiff with Form
Interrogatories, Set 1, making answers due 9/18/23.  (Petrosyan Decl. ¶7).  Despite being granted multiple extensions of
time to respond, Plaintiff has failed to serve responses to the subject
discovery.  (Id. ¶8).  Therefore, on 11/7/23, Padita filed and
served a motion seeking an order compelling Plaintiff to serve verified
answers, without objections, to Form Interrogatories, Set 1, and for monetary
sanctions.  (Id. ¶9).  On 6/3/24, this Court heard and granted the
motion ordering Plaintiff to provide responses without objections and for
Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel to pay sanctions in the amount of $460.00,
both within 30 days.  (Id. ¶10,
Ex.A).  Plaintiff failed to provide
responses and the sanctions ordered were not paid.    
 
Therefore, on 8/12/24, Padita filed and served the
instant motion seeking an order imposing terminating sanctions to dismiss
Plaintiff’s case with prejudice as to Defendant Padita Ayana under CCP
2023.030(d)(3), 2030.290(c) and 2031.300(c) as a result of Plaintiff’s failure
to comply with the Court’s 6/3/24 order requiring Plaintiff to provide verified
responses, without objections, to Form Interrogatories, Set 1, and requiring
Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel, Bryan Castorina, to pay sanctions in the
amount of $460.00 within 30 days.   
 
Alternatively, Defendant Padita Ayana requests that issue
and evidentiary sanctions be imposed precluding Plaintiff from presenting any
evidence at trial, including testimony on any of the matters addresses by the
unanswered discovery.  
 
Additionally, Defendant Padita Ayana seeks an order
imposing monetary sanctions in the amount of $460.00.
 
Plaintiff has not opposed or otherwise responded to the
motion.  
 
ANALYSIS
 
If a party fails to obey a court order to provide
discovery responses, the Court may impose whatever sanctions are just,
including, monetary sanctions, issues sanctions, evidence sanctions and/or
terminating sanctions.  See CCP
2023.030(a), (b), (c); CCP 2023.030(d)(1), (3); CCP 2030.290(c).
 
Here, Plaintiff has failed to respond to the discovery
despite being granted multiple extensions and ultimately being ordered to do so
by this Court.  Additionally, Plaintiff
has failed to oppose or otherwise respond to this motion explaining the failure
to comply with Plaintiff’s discovery obligations.  As such, the Court finds that imposing terminating
sanctions dismissing Plaintiff’s action as against Defendant Padita Ayana are
warranted.
 
The request for additional monetary sanctions is denied
as the motion fails to indicate against whom such sanctions are sought (i.e.,
Plaintiff, Plaintiff’s counsel, or both). 
See CCP 2023.040. 
Additionally, the conclusion portion of the motion indicates that the
request for monetary sanctions is part of the alternative request for relief,
if terminating sanctions are not granted. 
(See Motion, p.8:1-9).
 
CONCLUSION
 
The request for terminating sanctions is granted.  Plaintiff’s case as against Defendant Padita
Ayana is dismissed with prejudice.  Based
on the foregoing, the request for issue and/or evidence sanctions is moot.  The request for additional monetary sanctions
is denied.
