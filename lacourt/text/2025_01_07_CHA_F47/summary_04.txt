And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Defendant Hyundai Motor America's motion to compel arbitration and stay this action. The motion was filed on August 26, 2024, after Defendant failed to include certain evidence relied on in the motion. The judge continued the hearing to allow Defendant to file complete copies of the evidence, but Defendant failed to do so. As a result, the judge found that Defendant failed to adequately support the motion to establish that Plaintiffs agreed to arbitrate the dispute. Without adequate evidence of such an agreement, the motion must be denied.
