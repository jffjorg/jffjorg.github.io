And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Padita Ayana, filed a motion for terminating sanctions to dismiss the plaintiff's case with prejudice. The plaintiff, Jamal Salim Nasrallah, failed to comply with the court's order to provide verified responses to discovery requests and failed to pay sanctions. The court granted the motion, dismissing the plaintiff's case as against the defendant with prejudice. The court also denied the defendant's request for additional monetary sanctions, as the motion failed to specify against whom such sanctions were sought. The request for issue and/or evidence sanctions was deemed moot due to the dismissal of the case.
