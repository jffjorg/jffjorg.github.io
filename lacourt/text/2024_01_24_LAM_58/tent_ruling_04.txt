            This
action arises from an agreement with Defendant Brian & Sons Plumbing
(Defendant) to perform rough and finish plumbing for a 33-unit apartment
complex. Defendant started and then abandoned this project. (Compl., ¶¶ 11-12.)
The Complaint alleges, based on information and belief, Plaintiff was overbilled
by $200,000 and is entitled to restitution in the sum of $26,787.90. (Compl., ¶¶ 29, 32.) 
 
            On
August 23, 2022, Plaintiff dismissed Defendant National Western National Mutual
Insurance Company. On September 30, 2022, Plaintiff dismissed Defendant Wells
Fargo Bank. On July 6, 2023, Plaintiff dismissed East West Bank. 
            
            The
Complaint was filed on August 11, 2022. On January 20, 2023, default was entered
against Defendant Brian & Sons Plumbing. Does 1-15 have been dismissed.
 
            Plaintiff
now moves for entry of default judgment against Defendant Brian & Sons
Plumbing. The request for entry of default judgment is denied. 
 
Discussion
 
            Plaintiff
seeks default judgment in the amount of $1,170,643, which includes $48,352 in
interest, and $19,245.45 in costs (which includes attorney fees). 
 
            Plaintiff
states that it entered into an agreement with Defendant Brian & Sons
Plumbing to perform all rough and finish plumbing, and related tasks for a
33-unit apartment complex at 1300 Mission Boulevard,
Pomona, California 91766 (Property) and Defendant was to be paid $465,000.00
for this work. (Morillo Decl., ¶ 2.) Defendant abandoned the work on the
project in October 2021 and Plaintiff was forced to engage other vendors to
complete the work on the Property. (Morillo Decl., ¶ 3.) Plaintiff represents
that the total amount paid to other vendors was $1,103,045.66. (Morillo Decl.,
¶ 5.)
 
            As
preliminary matter, the table purporting to show the damages incurred appears
to include the amounts paid to Defendant Brian & Sons Plumbing; that is, it
is unclear whether this amount includes amounts for work actually performed and
are therefore not recoverable as damages. Moreover, the evidence submitted is
vague and conclusory as to the damages incurred. Plaintiff relies almost
entirely on this table purporting to show amounts paid to other vendors, but no
underlying invoice evidence was submitted or other evidence demonstrating that
the underlying work was within the scope of Defendant’s work agreement. Plaintiff
does not even attach its contract with Brian & Sons for the Court to
understand the scope of the work. Plaintiff’s evidence is woefully inadequate. 
 
            Even
assuming the evidence was adequate, the amount sought for entry of default
judgment exceeds the amount requested in the prayer of the Complaint. 
 
            A default judgment “cannot exceed that demanded in the complaint.” (Code
Civ. Proc., §§ 580, 585, subds. (a), (b).) “[A] default judgment greater than
the amount specifically demanded is void as beyond the [trial] court's
jurisdiction.” (Greenup v. Rodman (1986) 42 Cal.3d 822, 826, [italics
added].) A prayer for relief “in excess of” a specified dollar amount will
result in a default award of no more than that amount. (Traci & Marx Co.
v. Legal Options, Inc. (2005) 126 Cal.App.4th 155, 160.) 
 
            Specifically, the
Complaint’s prayer against Defendant Brian & Sons Plumbing seeks “damages
and restitution in an amount proven at trial.” (Compl., Prayer ¶ 1.) The body
of the Complaint only references the specific amounts of $200,000 and 26,787.90.
(Compl., ¶¶ 29, 32.) Thus, damages on this Complaint are limited to, at most,
$226,787.90 – assuming these damages can be properly substantiated.
 
            Further, although Plaintiff requests
attorney fees, Plaintiff fails to demonstrate any entitlement to attorney fees
based on either an agreement or statute. Local Rule 3.214, which Plaintiff
cites, does not serve as an independent basis to recover attorney fees.
 
            Lastly, Plaintiff’s interest
calculation is based on this excessive judgment amount and, therefore, faulty.
(Blum Decl., ¶ 3.) 
 
            Accordingly, the request for entry
of default judgment is denied.
