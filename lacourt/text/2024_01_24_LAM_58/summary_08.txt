And here is the English text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the motion for attorney's fees filed by Defendant The Westside Group is denied. The Plaintiff, Cates, had denied certain requests for admissions made by the Defendant, and the Defendant has proved the truth of the facts at trial. The Judge finds that the Plaintiff did not have a good faith belief that he would prevail on the issue at trial, and therefore, the Defendant is not entitled to reimbursement of its attorney's fees. The Judge also finds that the Defendant's request for attorney's fees is excessive, as it seeks four years of fees and over $120,000, but provides insufficient evidence to support this amount.
