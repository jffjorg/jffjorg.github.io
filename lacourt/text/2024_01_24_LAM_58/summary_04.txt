And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge denies the Plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment against Defendant Brian & Sons Plumbing. The Plaintiff seeks damages and restitution in the amount of $1,170,643, which includes $48,352 in interest and $19,245.45 in costs, based on an alleged agreement with the Defendant to perform plumbing work for a 33-unit apartment complex. However, the Judge finds that the Plaintiff's evidence is woefully inadequate to support the claimed damages, and that the amount sought exceeds the amount requested in the prayer of the Complaint. Additionally, the Judge notes that the Plaintiff fails to demonstrate entitlement to attorney fees based on either an agreement or statute. As a result, the Judge denies the request for entry of default judgment.
