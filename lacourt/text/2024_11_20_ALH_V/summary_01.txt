And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge in the case of Charlie Rhyne vs. DOES 1 THROUGH 100, INCLUSIVE. The case involves allegations of childhood sexual assault and a cover-up. The plaintiff, Charlie Rhyne, has moved to file under seal the Certificate of Corroborative Facts and to name and serve Doe 2.

The court has considered the moving papers and has denied the motion to serve Doe 2 and the motion to name Doe 2. The court has also denied the motion to file under seal the Certificate of Corroborative Facts. However, the court has granted the motion to file the Certificate of Corroborative Facts under seal.

The judge has found that the Certificate of Corroborative Facts is insufficient because it relies solely on the plaintiff's allegations and does not provide corroboration of the facts. The judge has also found that the plaintiff has not complied with Code of Civil Procedure section 340.1, which requires the filing of a certificate of merit and a certificate of corroborative fact.

The judge has ordered the plaintiff to give notice of this ruling.
