BACKGROUND
This is a Song-Beverly Act action. Plaintiff Steve Jung
filed the complaint against defendant Volkswagen Group of America, Inc. on
February 2, 2024. Plaintiff alleges the following causes of action: (1)
violation of subdivision (d) of Civil Code section 1793.2; (2)violation of
subdivision (b) of Civil Code section 1793.2; (3) violation of subdivision
(a)(3) of Civil Code section 1793.2; (4) breach of express written warranty;
and (5) breach of the implied warranty of merchantability. Plaintiff alleges he
purchased a 2022 Volkswagen Jetta SEL (subject vehicle) on April 18, 2022.
Plaintiff alleges that the subject vehicle contained or developed engine and
brake defects.
Plaintiff filed
the instant motion on October 14, 2024. Defendant filed the opposition on
November 6, 2024. Plaintiff filed his reply on November 13, 2024.
LEGAL STANDARD
With respect to requests for production of documents there
are three appropriate responses: (1) a statement that the party will comply
with the request; (2) a statement of inability to comply; or (3) an objection.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.210(a).)
The requesting party may move for an order compelling
further responses to request for production of documents if any of the
following apply: (1) a statement of compliance with the demand is incomplete;
(2) a representation of inability to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or
evasive; or (3) an objection in the response is without merit or too general.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310(a).)
The motion must be filed within 45 days from verified
responses, supplemental responses, or a specific later date agreed to in
writing (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310(c).) Failure to make motion within the
specified period constitutes waiver of right to compel a further response.
(Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.) The time period is
mandatory and jurisdictional in the sense that it renders the Court without
authority to rule on motions to compel other than to deny them. (Id.)
The motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer
declaration under Code of Civil Procedure section 2016.040. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.310(b)(2).) The purpose of the meet and confer requirement is to encourage
the parties to make serious effort to work out differences informally and avoid
a need for a formal order. (Stewart v. Colonial Western Agency, Inc. (2001) 87
Cal. App. 4th 1006, 1016.)
Under Rule of Court 3.1345, the movant must submit a
separate statement along with the motion to compel further responses. The
movant must include specific facts showing good cause justifying further
responses. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310(b)(1).)
DISCUSSION
A. Timeliness
Plaintiff served Request for Production of Documents, Set
One by mail on April 18, 2024. (Decl. of Benjeman Beck, ¶ 15.) On June 24,
2024, defendant served responses, consisting only of objections, to plaintiff’s
written discovery. (Decl. of Benjeman Beck, ¶ 19.) On August 5, 2024, defendant
served further, verified responses. (Decl. of Benjeman Beck, ¶ 22.) On
September 18, 2024, counsel met and conferred telephonically and agreed to
extend the deadline to file a motion to compel to October 7, 2024, which was
memorized in an email. (Decl. of Benjeman Beck, ¶ 26; Exh. 11.) On October 7,
2024, counsel agreed to extend plaintiff's filing deadline through October 14,
2024. (Decl. of Benjeman Beck, ¶ 28; Exh. 11.) Since plaintiff filed the
instant motion on October 14, 2024, plaintiff’s motion is timely.
 
B. Meet and Confer
After defendant provided further response, plaintiff’s
counsel sent a meet and confer letter to defendant’s counsel on September 16,
2024. (Decl. of Benjeman Beck, ¶ 25; Exh. 10.) On September 18, 2024, counsel
met and conferred telephonically and agreed to allow defendant more time to
respond to the meet and confer correspondence. (Decl. of Benjeman Beck, ¶ 26.)
On October 4, 2024, plaintiff’s counsel emailed counsel for defendant regarding
the status of a response to the September 16, 2024, meet and confer letter.
(Decl. of Benjeman Beck, ¶ 27.) On October 7, 2024, counsel agreed to provide
defendant additional time to resolve the disputed discovery. (Decl. of Benjeman
Beck, ¶ 28.) The court finds that plaintiff satisfied the meet and confer
requirement.
 
C. Separate Statement
Plaintiff’s statement of insufficiency in his separate
statement consists mostly of boilerplate language plaintiff copy and pasted for
each request, sometimes including language relating to vehicles other than the
subject vehicle, “the 2019 Infiniti Vehicles” and includes reference to “GM”
when the defendant is Volkswagen Group of America Inc. Plaintiff argues that
defendant’s responses are boilerplate objections. Despite these deficiencies,
the court will consider the motion on the merits.
 
D. Motion to Compel Further Responses to RFP Nos. 7, 10,
16-22, 27, 34, 37, 41-42, and 56
Plaintiff moves to compel defendant to provide further
responses to RFP nos. 7, 10, 16-22, 27, 34, 37, 41-42, and 56. Defendant states
that on November 6, 2024, it served additional confidential documents
responsive to request nos. 7, 8, 34, and 37 under the stipulated to protective
order. (Decl. of Shaun Kim, ¶ 6.) Plaintiff does not dispute this. Because
defendant produced further documents, these requests are moot.
 
As for RFP no. 10, the court finds that the workshop manual
sought by this request is relevant to evaluating whether the manufacturer
provides effective instructions to perform repairs properly, and whether the
technician properly repaired the subject vehicle. The request for the entire
manual is overbroad and limits the production of the workshop manual to
portions that address the repairs the subject vehicle needed and/or performed
on the subject vehicle. The court orders defendant to provide further responses
and produce documents to RFP no. 10.
Regarding RFP nos. 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, and 41 the court
finds that analysis and investigation documents; communications; and notices,
letters, campaigns, warranty extensions, technical service bulletins (TSBs),
recalls, failure rates, fixes, and vehicle warranty history reports for
repurchased or replaced vehicles regarding the emissions defect are relevant
because the subject vehicle experienced the emissions defect, as defined, and
these documents could tend to
establish that defendant was aware of the emission defect, investigated the
defect, and may have provided repair procedures for the defect that were
ineffective. This is relevant to show that defendant may not have known how to
fix the emissions defect and nevertheless failed to repurchase the vehicle.
These documents are also probative to plaintiff’s ability be awarded civil
penalties. The court orders defendant to provide further responses and produce
documents to RFP nos. 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, and 41.
RFP no. 19 seeks
documents regarding the emissions defect that may be relevant. However, the
request is overbroad because it seeks customer complaints, claims, reported
failures, and warranty claims, and defendant’s responses to these, related to
the emissions defect in general. The court narrows the request to those
customer complaints, claims, reported failures, and warranty claims made
regarding the emission defect in vehicle of the same year, make, and model as
the subject vehicle from the time plaintiff purchased the subject vehicle,
2022, to the present. Accordingly, the court orders defendant to provide
further responses and produce documents to RFP no. 19 as narrowed by the court.
Regarding RFP no. 22, plaintiff has not provided good cause
for further responses be issued regarding TSBs issued or in the process of
being issued for vehicles of the same year, make, and model. Plaintiff only
argues that emissions defects were present in the subject vehicle, and this
request asks for more than TSBs related to the emissions defect. Without a
showing of good cause, the court denies plaintiff’s request to provide further
responses and produce additional documents to RFP no. 22.
As to RFP no. 27, the court finds that plaintiff did not
provide good cause for the production of documents regarding defendant’s
document retention policy. Plaintiff’s statement of insufficiency argues that
emissions defects were present in the subject vehicle which is not relevant to
defendant’s document retention policy. Absent the requisite showing of good
cause, the court denies plaintiff’s request to provide further responses and
produce additional documents to RFP no. 27.
Regarding RFP
no. 42, the court concludes that this request is relevant to identifying which
employees were involved in or had oversight of the decision to deny plaintiff’s
alleged repurchase request. These individuals could provide testimony to show
whether defendant’s refusal was willful or made in good faith. However,
defendant states that it already produced documents that included the names of
all persons involved with plaintiff’s case including those involved in
prelitigation communications between plaintiff and defendant. Accordingly, the
court finds that further responses and documents to RFP no. 42 are not required.
RFP no. 56 is
overbroad because it requests electronic mail, including but not limited to
current, backed-up and archived programs, accounts, unified messaging,
server-based e-mail, Web-based e-mail, dial-up e-mail, user names and
addresses, domain names and addresses, e-mail messages, attachments, manual and
automated mailing lists and mailing list addresses relating to emissions
defects. While information on emissions defects, may be relevant to the case,
plaintiff has not shown why these specific categories of documents are relevant
and may lead to information that would help plaintiff prove its case. The
statement of insufficiency merely points out that emissions defects are present
in the subject vehicle and that TSBs show a repair procedure to address
concerns. Without more, the court denies plaintiff’s request for further
responses and production of documents to RFP no. 56.
 As to any claims
of privilege, the court orders defendant to provide a privilege log pursuant to
Code of Civil Procedure section, 2031.240(c)(1): “If an objection is based on a
claim of privilege or a claim that the information sought is protected work product,
the response shall provide sufficient factual information for other parties to
evaluate the merits of that claim, including, if necessary, a privilege log.”
(Code of Civ. Proc., § 2031.240(c)(1).)
Based on the
foregoing, the court GRANTS plaintiff’s motion to compel further responses to
RFP nos. 10, 16-21, and 41. The court DENIES plaintiff’s motion to compel
further responses to RFP nos. 22, 27, 42, and 56. The court finds that RFP nos.
7, 8, 34, and 37 are MOOT.
