And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made tentative rulings on several motions filed by the plaintiff, Acuna, to compel special requests and answers from the defendant, Perez. The judge has denied most of the motions, finding that they are overbroad, irrelevant, and do not lead to admissible evidence. The judge has also found that some of the requests are burdensome and harassing as to time, and do not limit themselves to issues related to the case.

The judge has granted a few of the motions, including one request to compel a verified answer with production of documents, but only limited to a specific period of time. The judge has also overruled some objections and ordered the plaintiff to serve a verified answer within 10 days.

The judge will discuss sanctions at the upcoming court hearing.
