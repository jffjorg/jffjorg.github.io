Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding plaintiff Sara Simms's motions to compel further discovery responses from defendants Epione Beverly Hills, Inc. and Beverly Hills Plastic Surgery Associates. The plaintiff sought to compel the defendants to serve further responses to requests for production and special interrogatories, as well as sanctions for the defendants' meritless objections.

The judge granted the plaintiff's motions, ordering the defendants to serve further verified responses to the requests for production and special interrogatories without objections. The judge also ordered the defendants to pay sanctions to the plaintiff for their misuse of the discovery process.

The judge found that the defendants' objections to the requests for production and special interrogatories were meritless and failed to justify their positions. The judge also noted that the defendants did not act with substantial justification and that sanctions were justified.

The judge ordered the defendants to pay the following sanctions: Epione Beverly Hills, Inc. - $960 for special interrogatories and $1,740 for requests for production; Beverly Hills Plastic Surgery Associates - $840 for requests for production and $1,320 for special interrogatories. The judge also ordered the defendants' counsel, Steven M. Kroll, to jointly and severally be liable for the sanctions.
