And here is a summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Salvador Lopez, Jr. against Advance Pipe Bending. The plaintiff is seeking default judgment against the defendant, but the judge has denied this request due to defects in the application. The judge has also ordered the plaintiff to pay $100 in sanctions for failing to timely request entry of default judgment. The plaintiff's application is defective because it does not explain a basis for recovering damages for physical pain and emotional distress suffered as a result of a workplace injury. The judge has ruled that the superior court does not have jurisdiction over claims covered by the Workers' Compensation Act, and that the plaintiff's claims are not a cause of action for damages based on personal injury. The judge has ordered the plaintiff to file a complete default judgment application by January 20, 2025, and has continued the order to show cause re: entry of default judgment to January 30, 2025.
