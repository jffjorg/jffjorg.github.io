And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendants' motions for judgment on the pleadings are denied. The case is a wrongful death and medical malpractice action brought by the plaintiffs, Melissa and Collier Hansen, against the defendants, Jodie Votava-Smith, Vaughn A. Starnes, M.D., Jennifer Shepard, Shilpa Shah, M.D., and Children's Hospital Los Angeles.

The defendants moved for judgment on the pleadings, arguing that the plaintiffs' claims against them are barred by the statute of limitations. The defendants claimed that the plaintiffs should have filed their claims within one year of the death of Maia Hansen, which occurred on October 25, 2021. However, the court found that the plaintiffs' allegations, which were made in the original and amended complaints, established that they did not discover their injury until October 12, 2022, and therefore had until October 3, 2023, to assert their claims against the defendants.

The court also found that the defendants' meet and confer obligations had been satisfied. Therefore, the court denied the defendants' motions for judgment on the pleadings.
