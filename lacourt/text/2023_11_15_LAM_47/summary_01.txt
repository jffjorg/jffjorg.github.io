The plaintiff, Bruce Dwain Copeland, had moved to compel responses from the defendant, Amy Pham, but the judge has denied the motion. The defendant had also requested sanctions against the plaintiff for propounding discovery during a stay of litigation, and the judge has granted that request in the amount of $1,446.50. The judge found that the plaintiff had engaged in a misuse of the discovery process by persisting in pursuing discovery despite the stay, and that the defendant had incurred reasonable expenses as a result.
