MOVING
PARTY:  Plaintiff Floridalma Agustin
(“Petitioner”)
 
The
Court has considered the moving papers. 
No opposition papers were filed. 
Any opposition papers were required to have been filed and served at
least nine court days before the hearing under California Code of Civil
Procedure (“CCP”) section 1005, subdivision (b).
 
BACKGROUND
            Petitioner, individually and as guardian ad litem for
minor claimants Kayro Jehiel Carranza-Agustin (10); Loida Jocabed Carranza (8);
and Elimelec Aliel Carranza-Agustin (4) (collectively, “Minor Claimants”), and Plaintiff
Hugo Adolfo Carranza (collectively “Plaintiffs”), initiated this action against
Defendants Gary Gillman; Debbie Gillman; and Encino Management Services
(collectively, “Defendants”).  This
action arises out of a landlord/tenant relationship.  The complaint alleges: (1) breach of warranty
of habitability; (2) breach of covenant of quiet enjoyment; (3) negligence; and
(4) breach of contract.
 
Petitioner
filed the instant petitions to approve the compromise of disputed claim on
behalf of Minor Claimants (collectively, the “Petitions”).  
 
DISCUSSION
If
an action is pending and settlement is effected prior to trial, the minor’s
compromise must be approved by the court. 
(CCP § 372.)  A petition to
approve a minor’s compromise is governed by California Rules of Court (“CRC”), rules 7.950, et seq. and Probate Code sections 3500 and 3600 et seq.  The
trial court is authorized to approve and allow payment of reasonable expenses,
costs, and attorney fees in an action concerning the compromise of a minor’s
claim.  (Prob. Code, § 3601, subd. (a); Curtis v. Estate of Fagan (2000) 82
Cal.App.4th 270, 277-79; see also CCP § 373.5.)
 
Attorney’s Fees
Unless
the court has approved the fee agreement in advance, the court must use a
reasonable fee standard when approving and allowing the amount of attorney's
fees payable from money or property paid or to be paid for the benefit of a
minor or a person with a disability. 
(CRC, r. 7.955(a).)  The court
must give consideration to the terms of the agreement between the attorney and
minor’s representative and must evaluate the agreement based on the facts and
circumstances existing at the time the agreement was made.  (CRC, r. 7.955(a)(2).)  CRC Rule 7.955(b)(2) sets out nonexclusive
factors the court may consider in determining the reasonableness of attorney’s
fees in connection with a petition for minor’s compromise.  Under CRC Rule 7.955(c), the petition must
include a declaration by the attorney addressing the factors set forth in CRC
Rule 7.955(b)(2) that are applicable to the matter that is before the Court.
 
Here,
the Minor Claimants, by and through Petitioner, their guardian ad litem, have
agreed to settle their claims against Defendants in exchange for $5,000
each.  Upon approval, $1,250 of each
settlement payment will be allocated towards attorney’s fees, and $725.61 will
be used to reimburse the fees and costs advanced by Plaintiffs' counsel, leaving
a balance of $3,024.39 to be disbursed to Petitioner for each minor claimant.
 
            The Court finds that the settlement is fair and
reasonable.  Further, the Court considers
the requested amount in attorney’s fees, which amounts to 25% of each settlement
payment, to be fair and reasonable.  For
these reasons and because they are unopposed, the Court provisionally GRANTS
the Petitions, conditioned on Petitioner appearing (either remotely or in
person) at the hearing.  (Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.)
 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
