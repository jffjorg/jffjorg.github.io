```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendant's motion to vacate the default judgment and orders the defendant to file an answer within 10 days. The judge finds that the entry of default was a result of the defendant's counsel's neglect and that the defendant's motion was timely filed within the six-month period allowed by law. The judge notes that the defendant's counsel failed to properly monitor the court's docket and was unaware that the defendant had been served with process. The judge concludes that the default was caused by the defendant's counsel's mistake and grants the motion.
