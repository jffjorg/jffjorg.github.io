  Case Number:  23PSCV00488    Hearing Date:   June 12, 2024    Dept:  G Plaintiff Cassandra Ruiz’s Motion for Attorney’s Fees for
Time Actually Expended and Reasonably Incurred
Respondent: Defendant Kia
America, Inc.
TENTATIVE RULING
Plaintiff Cassandra Ruiz’s Motion for Attorney’s Fees
for Time Actually Expended and Reasonably Incurred is GRANTED in the reduced
amount of $21,413 in attorney fees and costs in the amount of $1,206.14.
BACKGROUND
This
is an action governed by the Song-Beverly
Consumer Warranty Act. In March 2020, Plaintiff
Cassandra Ruiz entered into a warranty contract with Defendant Kia America,
Inc. (Kia America) by purchasing a 2021 Kia Seltos. Subsequently during the
warranty period, Ruiz alleges the vehicle developed defects with its engine and
warning light system.
On February
21, 2023, Ruiz filed a complaint against Kia America, Kia of Cerritos, and Does
1-50, alleging (1) breach of express warranty, (2) breach of implied warranty,
(3) violation of Civil Code section 1793.2, subdivision (b), and (4) negligent
repair.
On
February 9, 2024, Ruiz filed a notice of settlement. On March 5, 2024, Ruiz filed
the present motion. A hearing on Ruiz’s motion is set for June 12, 2024, along
with an OSC Re: Dismissal on June 20, 2024.
ANALYSIS
Ruiz
moves the court for an award of reasonable attorney fees in the amount of $28,687.50
and costs in the amount of $1,206.14. For the following reasons, the Court GRANTS Ruiz’s motion in
the reduced amount of $21,413 in
attorney fees and costs in the amount of $1,206.14.
Legal
Standard
Pursuant to the Song-Beverly Consumer
Warranty Act, a prevailing buyer “shall be allowed by the court to recover as
part of the judgment a sum equal to the aggregate amount of costs and expenses,
including attorney’s fees based on actual time expended, determined by the court
to have been reasonably incurred by the buyer in connection with the
commencement and prosecution of such action.” (Civ. Code, § 1794, subd. (d).) They
have “the burden of showing that the fees incurred were reasonably necessary to
the conduct of the litigation, and were reasonable in amount.” (Robertson v.
Fleetwood Travel Trailers of California, Inc. (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 785,
817.) In granting their motion, “[a] trial court may not rubber stamp a request
for attorney fees, but must determine the number of hours reasonably expended.”
(Morris v. Hyundai Motor America (2019) 41 Cal.App.5th 24, 38 (Morris),
quoting Donahue v. Donahue (2010) 182 Cal.App.4th 259, 271.) “If the
time expended or the monetary charge being made for the time expended are not
reasonable under all the circumstances, then the court must take this into
account and award attorney fees in a lesser amount.” (Nightingale v. Hyundai
Motor America (1994) 31 Cal.App.4th 99, 104.)
Calculation of attorney fees
begins with the lodestar approach in which the court fixes the lodestar at “the
number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate.”
(Margolin v. Regional Planning Com. (1982) 134 Cal.App.3d 999, 1004,
quoting Copeland v. Marshall (D.C. Cir. 1980) 641 F.2d 880, 891.)
“California courts have consistently held that a computation of time spent on a
case and the reasonable value of that time is fundamental to a determination of
an appropriate attorneys’ fee award.” (Ibid.) “The lodestar figure may
then be adjusted, based on consideration of factors specific to the case, in
order to fix the fee at the fair market value for the legal services provided.”
(PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095.) “The factors to be
considered include the nature and difficulty of the litigation, the amount of
money involved, the skill required and employed to handle the case, the
attention given, the success or failure, and other circumstances in the case.” (EnPalm,
LLC v. Teitler (2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 770, 774.)
“It is appropriate for a
trial court to reduce a fee award based on its reasonable determination that a
routine, noncomplex case was overstaffed to a degree that significant
inefficiencies and inflated fees resulted.” (Morris, supra, 41
Cal.App.5th at p. 39.) It is also appropriate to reduce a fee award based on
“inefficient or duplicative efforts” in the billing record. (Id., at p.
38.) But the analysis must be “reasonably specific” and cannot rely on general
notions about the fairness of the fee award. (Kerkeles v. City of San Jose
(2015) 243 Cal.App.4th 88, 102.) And in conducting the analysis, courts are not
permitted to tie any reductions in the fee award to some proportion of the
buyer’s damages recovery. (Warren v. Kia Motors America, Inc. (2018) 30
Cal.App.5th 24, 39.)
Discussion
In this case, Ruiz argues entitlement
to a total of $28,687.50 in attorney fees. In opposition, Kia America argues Ruiz’s
requested attorney fees should be reduced to $13,860, while not disputing Ruiz
is a prevailing party entitled to attorney fees.
Reasonableness of
Hourly Rate
Ruiz’s counsel requests
hourly rates of $695 per hour for Michael Saeedian, $525 per hour for
Christopher Urner, and $250 per hour for Jorge L. Acosta. (Saeedian Decl., ¶ 24.)
In opposition, Kia America argues Ruiz failed to provide evidence that
demonstrates these fees are the prevailing rate for similar non-contingent
lemon law litigation in southern California. (Opp., p. 4:17-22.) Kia America
also argues Saeedian failed to present evidence of lemon law experience that
justifies an hourly rate of $695 and recommends the Court reduce the reasonable
rate to a blended amount of $300 per hour. (Opp., p. 5:10-21.)
To determine if an hourly
rate is reasonable, courts consider the rates of similar attorneys in the community
as well as “the experience, skill, and reputation of the attorney requesting
fees.” (Heritage Pacific Financial, LLC v. Monroy (2013) 215 Cal.App.4th
972, 1009.) Here, Saeedian’s declaration provides an overview of Saeedian, Urner,
and Acosta’s experience and credentials. (Saeedian Decl., ¶ 2-5.) In claiming
these rates are reasonable, Ruiz’s counsel argues they are below the
contingency rates reflected in the Laffey Matrix, which summarizes the rates
charged by contingency attorneys. (Saeedian Decl., ¶ 12.) This matrix, however,
only provides billing rates for attorneys in the Washington, D.C. area and must
be adjusted with data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics when applied to other
areas. (Pasternack v. McCullough (2021) 65 Cal.App.5th 1050, 1057, fn.
5.) Ruiz fails to establish how the data in Laffey Matrix is adjusted to the
rates charged in southern California.
In this case, while Saeedian
states Saeedian has been licensed to practice law in California since 2009,
Saeedian does not describe Saeedian’s lemon law experience in detail. (Saeedian
Decl., ¶ 1-3.) Thus, based on the Court’s own experience with the billing rates
of Los Angeles-area counsel in similar lemon law cases, the Court finds an
hourly rate of $695 to be unreasonable and reduces Saeedian’s requested hourly
rate to $450. As for Urner, Saeedian’s declaration states Urner has been
licensed to practice law in California since 2016 and has more than five years
of experience in litigating lemon law cases. (Saeedian Decl., ¶ 4.) Based on
the Court’s experience, the Court finds Urner’s hourly rate of $525 to be
unreasonable and reduces Urner’s requested hourly rate to $390. Last, the Court
finds Acosta’s hourly rate of $250 is reasonable and does not require
adjustment.
Reasonableness of Hours
Billed
Ruiz requests attorney fees
for a total of 61.1 hours spent by counsel on this action including 26 hours
for Saeedian, 6.7 hours for Urner, and 28.4 hours for Acosta. (Saeedian Decl.,
¶ 24.) In opposition, Kia America contends the Court should reduce the time
requested by 14.9 hours. (Opp., p. 7:17.)
Although a verified fee bill
is “prima facie evidence the costs, expenses and services listed were
necessarily incurred,” (Hadley v. Krepel (1985) 167 Cal.App.3d 677,
682), counsel still has the burden to demonstrate the reasonableness of
charges. (Mikhaeilpoor v. BMW of North America, LLC (2020) 48
Cal.App.5th 240, 247.) The Court addresses the parties’ contentions below.
Time Billed for
Administrative Tasks
Kia America first contends
Ruiz is seeking to recover fees for 31.2 hours of administrative tasks performed
by non-attorneys. (Opp., p. 6:16-18.) Kia America requests the Court reduce the
time requested by twenty-five percent or 7.8 hours. (Opp., p. 6:16-7:2.) But
while Kia America generally cites to Saeedian’s declaration, Kia America fails
to provide specific citations or references to the billing entries that should
not be awarded. Because the Court is not in a position to guess which entries
are included in Kia America’s total of 31.2 hours, Kia America’s requested
reduction is denied.
Time Billed for Use of
Form Documents
Kia America next contends Ruiz’s
request should be reduced by 6.1 hours to account for the use of form documents
by Ruiz’s counsel. (Opp., p. 7:3-16.) Kia America points to entries where
counsel billed 2.3 hours for drafting the Complaint, 4.2 hours for drafting
discovery requests, 3.0 hours to review discovery responses, and 4.6 hours on
the present motion. (Opp., p. 7:9-16.) Kia America fails to provide, however,
specific citations to the billing entries at issue, and the Court finds the
subject entries do not appear to be excessive on their face. Thus, Kia
America’s requested reduction is denied.
Accordingly, the Court awards
attorney fees to Ruiz in the amount of $21,413, including $11,700 for Saeedian
at an hourly rate of $450 for 26 hours, $2,613 for Urner at an hourly rate of
$390 for 6.7 hours, and $7,100 for Acosta at an hourly rate of $250 for 28.4
hours.
Costs
Ruiz also requests the Court
award costs in the amount of $1,206.14. Because Kia America has not objected to
or opposed Ruiz’s requested costs, the Court awards costs in the amount requested.
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, Ruiz’s
motion for attorney fees is GRANTED in the reduced amount of $21,413 in
attorney fees and costs in the amount of $1,206.14.
