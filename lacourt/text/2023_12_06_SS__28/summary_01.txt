Significant Statements:

But where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction." (Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 262, 279-280.)
  - "A terminating sanction is a 'drastic measure which should be employed with caution.'" (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771, 795-796.)
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Walmart's motion for terminating sanctions and dismissed the case with prejudice. The judge found that Walmart made reasonable efforts to schedule the deposition, but Plaintiff failed to comply with the court's October 3, 2023 order to attend a deposition within 30 days and provide appropriate documentation showing a medical emergency. The judge was not persuaded by Plaintiff's claims that she was still experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 and needed to spend her time catching up at work. The judge concluded that Plaintiff's failure to comply with the court's order and provide a valid excuse was a willful violation of the discovery rules, and therefore justified the imposition of terminating sanctions.
