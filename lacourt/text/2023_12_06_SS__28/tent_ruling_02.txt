rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On
September 4, 2019, Plaintiff Jeffrey Nabatmama (“Plaintiff”) filed this action
against Defendants John Alexander Laing (“John Laing”), Lydia Laing, and Does
1-50 for negligence. 
On
March 9, 2022, Plaintiff filed a proof of service showing substituted service
on John Laing of the summons, complaint, statement of damages, and other
documents on March 2, 2022. 
On
June 1, 2022, the Court dismissed Defendant Lydia Laing without prejudice at
Plaintiff’s request. 
On
September 8, 2022, the clerk entered John Laing’s default. 
On
September 8, 2023, Plaintiff filed a request for Court judgment against John Laing
to be heard on December 6, 2023.  On
September 11, 2023, the Court dismissed the Doe defendants without prejudice at
Plaintiff’s request. 
PARTY’S REQUEST 
Plaintiff
Jeffrey Nabatmama requests that the Court enter default judgment against
Defendant John Laing and award Plaintiff $36,462.75, consisting of $10,800.00
in special damages, $25,000.00 in general damages, $0.00 in prejudgment
interest, $0.00 in attorney’s fees, and $662.75 in costs. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
A.      Default
judgment 
“[With
exceptions that do not apply here,] [a] party seeking a default judgment on
declarations must use mandatory Request for Entry of Default (Application to
Enter Default) (form CIV-100) . . . The following must be included in the
documents filed with the clerk: 
“(1)  Except in unlawful detainer cases, a brief
summary of the case identifying the parties and the nature of plaintiff's
claim; 
“(2)  Declarations or other admissible evidence in
support of the judgment requested; 
“(3)  Interest computations as necessary; 
“(4)  A memorandum of costs and disbursements; 
“(5)  A declaration of nonmilitary status for each
defendant against whom judgment is sought; 
“(6)  A proposed form of judgment; 
“(7)  A dismissal of all parties against whom
judgment is not sought or an application for separate judgment against specified
parties under Code of Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of
grounds for each judgment; 
“(8)  Exhibits as necessary; and 
“(9)  A request for attorney fees if allowed by
statute or by the agreement of the parties.” 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1800(a).) 
B.       Damages 
 On a request for default judgment, “[w]here a
cause of action is stated in the complaint, plaintiff merely needs to introduce
evidence establishing a prima facie case for damages.”  (L. Edmon & C. Karnow, Cal. Practice
Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶ 5:213.1, p. 5-56 (Cal.
Practice Guide), citing Johnson v. Stanhiser (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 357,
361 [trial court erred in applying preponderance of the evidence standard].) 
 The relief granted to a plaintiff upon entry
of a defendant's default cannot exceed the amount demanded in the complaint or,
for personal injury cases where damages may not be stated in the complaint, the
amount listed in the statement of damages. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 580, subd. (a),
585, subd. (b).) “The notice requirement of section 580 was designed to insure
fundamental fairness.” (Becker v. S.P.V. Construction Co. (1980) 27
Cal.3d 489, 494 (Becker).) The statute insures that “defendants in cases
which involve a default judgment have adequate notice of the judgments that may
be taken against them. [Citation.] ‘If a judgment other than that which is
demanded is taken against him, [the defendant] has been deprived of his day in
court—a right to a hearing on the matter adjudicated.’ ’’ (Id. at p.
493.) A trial court exceeds its jurisdiction if it awards damages in excess of
the amount specified in the complaint or statement of damages. (Id. at
p. 494; see Cal. Practice Guide, supra, ¶ 5:258, p. 5-70.) 
DISCUSSION 
Plaintiff’s
request for $10,800 in special damages appears to include amounts owed to
Elyasi Chiropractic.  However, the report
from Elyasi Chiropractic states that Plaintiff received treatment for injuries that
he suffered in an accident on August 3, 2018. 
Plaintiff’s complaint alleges that the accident took place on September
7, 2017.  The defendant is not responsible
for medical expenses incurred due to a subsequent accident. 
The
Court denies the application. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES the application for default judgment filed on September 8, 2023
without prejudice. 
Plaintiff
is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
