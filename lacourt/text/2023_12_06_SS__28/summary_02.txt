And here is the English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has denied the application for default judgment filed by Jeffrey Nabatmama against John Alexander Laing. The Judge found that the requested damages of $10,800 for special damages appear to include amounts owed to Elyasi Chiropractic, but the report from Elyasi Chiropractic states that the treatment was for injuries suffered in an accident on August 3, 2018, which is subsequent to the accident alleged in the complaint. The court does not have jurisdiction to award damages in excess of the amount specified in the complaint or statement of damages. The application is denied without prejudice, and the plaintiff is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
