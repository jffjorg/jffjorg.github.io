  Case Number:  19STCV10866    Hearing Date:   December 6, 2023    Dept:  28 Having  considered the moving, opposing and reply papers, the Court rules as follows.  BACKGROUND  On  March 29, 2019, Plaintiff Carmela Tyson (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against  Defendants Walmart, Inc. (“Walmart”) and Does 1-100 for premises liability and  negligence. Plaintiff later amended the complaint to include Defendants Tammy  Cannon, Robin Abbott, Brenda Robert, J.T. Doe, Isabell Doe, Julio Doe, Gilbert  Doe and Vincent Doe.  On  December 9, 2020, Walmart filed an answer.  On  November 3, 2023, Walmart filed a motion for terminating sanctions to be heard  on December 6, 2023. On November 21, 2023, Plaintiff filed an opposition. On  November 29, 2023, Walmart filed a reply.  The  trial is currently scheduled to begin on January 8, 2024.  PARTIES’ REQUESTS  Walmart  requests that the Court issue terminating sanctions against Plaintiff and dismiss the case.  Plaintiff  requests that the Court deny the motion.  LEGAL STANDARD  Code  of Civil Procedure section 2023.030 provides in part:  “To the extent authorized by the chapter governing any  particular discovery method or any other provision of this title, the court,  after notice to any affected party, person, or attorney, and after opportunity  for hearing, may impose the following sanctions against anyone engaging in  conduct that is a misuse of the discovery process:  “(a) The court may impose a monetary sanction ordering  that one engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney  advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses, including  attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct. The court may  also impose this sanction on one unsuccessfully asserting that another has  engaged in the misuse of the discovery process, or on any attorney who advised  that assertion, or on both. If a monetary sanction is authorized by any  provision of this title, the court shall impose that sanction unless it finds  that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or  that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.  * * *  “(d) The court may impose a terminating sanction by  one of the following orders:  “(1) An order striking out the pleadings or parts of  the pleadings of any party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process.  “(2) An order staying further proceedings by that  party until an order for discovery is obeyed.  “(3) An order dismissing the action, or any part of  the action, of that party.  “(4) An order rendering a judgment by default against  that party.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030,  subds. (a), (d).)  A  violation of a discovery order supports the imposition of terminating  sanctions. (Collison & Kaplan v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th  1611, 1620.) Terminating sanctions are appropriate when a party persists in  disobeying the court's orders. (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d  771, 795-796 (Deyo).)  A  terminating sanction is a "drastic measure which should be employed with  caution." (Deyo, supra, 84 Cal.App.3d at p. 793.) "A  decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly. But where a  violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows  that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery  rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction." (Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 262, 279-280.)  DISCUSSION A.   Previous attempts to complete Plaintiff’s deposition  On  June 21, 2023, Walmart began to take Plaintiff’s deposition but Plaintiff  terminated it after a few hours because she had a headache. Plaintiff’s counsel  promised to provide dates for Plaintiff’s continued deposition within one week.  The same day, Walmart’s counsel sent an email to Plaintiff’s counsel confirming  their discussion and requesting “dates that Plaintiff is available for BEFORE  June 29th to have the remainder of her deposition taken.”    On  June 28, 2023, the Court granted Walmart’s motion to compel Plaintiff to appear  for a deposition and ordered Plaintiff to appear for a deposition within 30  days of service of notice of the Court’s order and pay sanctions to Walmart.  Walmart served notice of the June 28, 2023 ruling on July 5, 2023. Therefore,  Plaintiff was required to appear for a deposition by August 4, 2023.  On  September 6, 2023, Walmart filed a motion to dismiss the case because Plaintiff  had not appeared for a deposition by August 4, 2023.   On  October 3, 2023, the Court denied Walmart’s motion without prejudice, observing  that Walmart had not submitted any information showing that it attempted to  take Plaintiff’s deposition between June 28, 2023, and August 4, 2023.  In addition, while Plaintiff failed to appear  for a noticed deposition on September 5, 2023, Plaintiff argued that she and  her counsel were not aware of the deposition.  The  Court ordered Plaintiff to appear for a deposition within 30 days of the October  3, 2023 hearing and ordered Walmart’s counsel to work with Plaintiff’s counsel  to schedule a deposition within that period. The Court ordered Walmart to  confirm service of its deposition notice on Plaintiff’s counsel. The Court  specified that if Plaintiff failed to appear at the deposition for any reason  other than a medical emergency, proved with appropriate documentation, the  Court would dismiss the case.  B.   Walmart’s motion  Between  October 3, 2023 and November 3, 2023, Walmart’s counsel asked Plaintiff’s counsel  for deposition dates for Plaintiff on October 4, 9, 13, 18, 20, 23, and 25.  (Colbert Dec. ¶ 19.)  On  October 23, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel informed Walmart’s counsel that Plaintiff  “was diagnosed with COVID and was taken off work for the majority of October  2023” but “will be available for her Deposition on November 14 or 15.”  (Colbert Dec. exh. 14.)  Walmart’s counsel asked Plaintiff’s counsel  to provide medical documentation supporting his assertion.  (Colbert Dec. exh. 14.)  Walmart’s motion does not discuss  whether Plaintiff provided medical documentation but asserts that Plaintiff did  not appear for a deposition on or before November 2, 2023.  C.   Plaintiff’s opposition  Plaintiff  argues that she was unavailable for a deposition during October 2023 due to a “COVID-19  diagnosis, physical and mental health disability.”  (Opposition p. 3.)  She asserts that her counsel “provided  Defendant’s counsel with medical documentation confirming the COVID-19  diagnosis.”  (Opposition p. 3.)  In a  declaration supporting Plaintiff’s opposition to the motion to dismiss,  Plaintiff’s counsel states: “I asked my client for her availability for her  deposition for the month of October 2023. However, Plaintiff informed me that  she had been diagnosed with COVID-19. Plaintiff provided me with medical  documentation that I forwarded to Defendant’s counsel in addition to available  dates in November 2023.”  (Levian Dec. ¶  29.)  Plaintiff  has submitted two letters on the letterhead of Joshua Medical Group, from  Juliana Wilson, PA-C.  The first letter,  dated September 30, 2023, states: “This letter is to request Carmela Tyson to  be excused from work for 10 days.   Patient was seen in clinic on 9/30/23 and tested covid positive.  She is symptomatic with cough, runny nose,  and bodyache/chills.  Patient may return  to work on 10/11/23.”  The  second letter, dated October 10, 2023, states:: “This letter is to request  Carmela Tyson to be excused from work until 10/17/23.  After testing covid positive on 9/30/23, she  was seen again in clinic on 10/10/23.   She continues to show symptoms of cough.   Patient may return to work on 10/18/23.”   (Exhibit G to Tyson Dec.)  D.   Walmart’s replyWalmart  has submitted an October 14, 2023 letter from Caleb Kil, PA-C, from Joshua  Medical Care stating: “Carmela Tyson tested negative for COVID-19 today.  She is currently asymptomatic and her  physical exam was unremarkable.  Please  allow her to return to work on 10/16/23.”   (Exh. 15 to Colbert Dec.)  E.   Analysis  Walmart  made reasonable efforts to schedule Plaintiff’s deposition within 30 days of  the Court’s October 3, 2023 order.  Plaintiff,  however, has not complied with the Court’s October 3, 2023 order to attend a  deposition within that time or provide appropriate documentation showing a  medical emergency.  Plaintiff’s medical documentation  shows that Plaintiff was ill from September 30, 2023 to October 16, 2023.  Even assuming that the illness prevented  Plaintiff from attending a deposition, Plaintiff has not shown why she could  not have scheduled and attended a deposition between October 16, 2023 (when she  was medically cleared to return to work) and November 2, 2023.  In  her declaration, Plaintiff asserts: “When I was able to return to work, I was  not fully recovered and was feeling very exhausted after a few hours of work as  I still had residual effects of having COVID-19, I was still coughing, sneezing  and experiencing runny nose symptoms periodically. I really wanted to have my  deposition continued but I needed to  catch up with my work so I would not lose my job . . . .”  (Tyson Dec. ¶ 15.)   The  Court is not persuaded.  Although  Plaintiff asserts that she was still experiencing symptoms, the October 14,  2023 letter from Joshua Medical Care states that Plaintiff was asymptomatic and  her physical exam was unremarkable.  In  addition, Plaintiff’s wish to spend her time catching up at work does not  excuse her failure to comply with the Court’s October 3, 2023 order.  The  Court grants Walmart’s motion, imposes terminating sanctions, and dismisses Plaintiff's claims against Walmart.  CONCLUSION  The  Court GRANTS Defendant Walmart, Inc.’s motion for terminating sanctions.  The Court dismisses Plaintiff Carmela Tyson's claims against Defendant Walmart, Inc. with prejudice under Code of Civil Procedure section  2023.030, subdivision (d)(3).  Moving  party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
