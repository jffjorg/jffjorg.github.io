And here is the English summary:

The Court has considered the motion to sever and stay the First Amended Cross-Complaint of Caring Heart In-Home Care Services, Inc. (CH) against the Underwriters. The Underwriters contend that the insurance policy issues should be tried separately from the liability issues in the underlying action. The Court finds that a severance is warranted, as the issues presented would pose a serious risk of confusing the jury over the issues of liability in the underlying claim with the issue of coverage alleged in the FAXC. The motion to sever and stay is GRANTED, and the action on the FAXC is stayed pending the outcome of the underlying action.
