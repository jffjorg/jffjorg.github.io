The Regents of the University of California (erroneously

as “University of California” and “UCLA Medical Center”)
            The Court has considered the moving,

BACKGROUND
On February
2, 2023, Plaintiff Darletha Matthews initiated this employment action against
Defendant The Regents of the University of California (erroneously sued as
“University of California” and “UCLA Medical Center”). On April 24, 2023,
Plaintiff filed the operative First Amended Complaint against Defendant
alleging the following causes of action: (1) Disability Discrimination in
Violation of FEHA; (2) Racial Discrimination in Violation of FEHA; (3) Failure
to Engage in the Interactive Process; (4) Failure to Accommodate; (5)
Retaliation in Violation of FEHA; and (6) Failure to Prevent Discrimination in
Violation of FEHA. 
 
Plaintiff
alleges that she was employed with Defendant as a registered nurse starting in
October 2013. (FAC ¶ 6.) In June 2020, Plaintiff was diagnosed with breast
cancer and took an unpaid leave of absence the following month. (Id. at
¶ 8.) Around August 2020, Plaintiff requested an accommodation to not care for
COVID-19 patients or suspected COVID-19 patients, but in September 2020,
Defendant stated that it could not accommodate this request. (Id. at ¶¶
8-9.) By November 2020, Plaintiff had an unplanned surgery due to an infection,
and when she returned to work on January 12, 2021, she was afforded certain
restrictions. (Id. at ¶ 11.) By June 15, 2021, Defendant could no longer
accommodate her disability and placed her on an unpaid leave of absence. (Id.
at ¶ 12.) Plaintiff was then placed on a reassignment period, and despite
applying to several positions, Plaintiff was turned away while non-African
American nurses and those without disabilities with less experience were given
those positions. (Id.at ¶ 13.) On June 8, 2022, Defendant terminated
Plaintiff’s employment due to her medical condition. (Id. at ¶ 14.)
 
On March
28, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant motions to quash relating to the business
record subpoenas issued by Defendant to the following entities: (1) Valley
Community Health, (2) Mend Urgent Care; (3) Cerebral Inc.; (4) Millennium
Medical Associates, Inc.; and (5) MemorialCare.
 
On April
12, 2024, Defendant filed an omnibus opposition to the motions to quash
relating to the subpoenas issued to Cerebral Inc. and Millennium Medical
Associates, Inc. On April 16, 2024, Defendant filed an omnibus opposition to
the motions to quash relating to the subpoenas issued to Valley Community
Health and Mend Urgent Care.  On April
23, 2024, Defendant filed an opposition to the motion to quash relating to the
subpoena issued to MemorialCare.
 
On April
18, 2024, Plaintiff filed her replies to Defendant’s omnibus oppositions.   
 
DISCUSSION
            Code of Civil Procedure § 1987.1
states, “[w]hen a subpoena requires the attendance of a witness or the
production of books, documents or other things before a court, or at the trial
of an issue therein, …, upon motion reasonably made by the party, the witness,
or any consumer described in Section 1985.3, or upon the court's own motion
after giving counsel notice and an opportunity to be heard, may make an order
quashing the subpoena entirely, modifying it, or directing compliance with it
upon such terms or conditions as the court shall declare, including protective
orders.” There is no requirement that
the motion contain a meet-and-confer declaration demonstrating a good-faith
attempt at informal resolution. (See id.)  A motion to quash does
require a separate statement. (California Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(a)(5).)
 
“The
court shall limit the scope of discovery if it determines that the burden,
expense, or intrusiveness of that discovery clearly outweighs the likelihood
that the information sought will lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.
The court may make this determination pursuant to a motion for protective order
by a party or other affected person. This motion shall be accompanied by a meet
and confer declaration under Section 2016.040.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc. §
2017.020(a).)¿¿¿ “The court, for good cause shown, may make any order that
justice requires to protect any party or other natural person or organization
from unwarranted annoyance, embarrassment, or oppression, or undue burden and
expense.” (Code of Civ. Proc. § 2031.060.)
 
Mertis
Plaintiff
seeks to quash the various subpoenas seeking her employment records with Valley
Community Health, Mend Urgent Care, Cerebral Inc., Millennium Medical
Associates, Inc. and MemorialCare.  (Notices
of Motion at pg. 2.)
 
Generally,
an individual has a legally protected privacy interest with respect to his
personnel, financial, and medical records. (See Davis v. Superior Court
(1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1008, 1019; Valley Bank of Nev. V. Superior Court
(1975) 15 Cal.3d 652, 656; Puerto v. Superior Court (2008) 158
Cal.App.4th 1242, 1251; see also Williams v. Superior Court
(2017) 3 Cal.5th 531, 552).
 
Here,
each subpoena seeks the following information: “Any and all DOCUMENTS wherever
located which constitute EMPLOYMENT RECORDS as defined in California Code of
Civil Procedure section 1985.6 including, but not limited to resume, job
application, personnel file, performance reviews, correspondence, memoranda,
employment contract for services, and wage and payment records related to
Darletha Matthews (DOB: 8-20-1982).” (Motions at pp. 3-4; Separate Statements
at pg. 1; Hames Decls. ¶ 4, Exhs. C.) Plaintiff contends that the information
sought by these subpoenas is not directly relevant to her claims, is
inadmissible, and can be obtained through less intrusive means. (Motions at pp.
4-6.)
 
There
can be no dispute that Plaintiff has a legally protected privacy interest
with respect to her personnel records. (See Davis, supra, 7
Cal.App.4th at 1019; Valley Bank of Nev., supra, 15 Cal.3d at
656; and Puerto, supra, 158 Cal.App.4th at 1251.) Under these
circumstances, the Court finds that the threatened intrusion is not serious. (Williams,
supra, 3 Cal.5th at 552.) This is especially the case because the
parties have entered into a protective order on August 15, 2023. Moreover,
Defendant has a compelling interest in accessing those records, and the scope
of discovery is broad.  (Code Civ. Proc.
§ 2017.010 [allowing discovery of any matter that is “relevant to the subject
matter involved in the pending action or to the determination of any motion
made in that action, if the matter either is itself admissible in evidence or
appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible
evidence.”]) As Defendant has pointed out in its oppositions, the information
sought by these subpoenas are necessary to evaluate Plaintiff’s alleged damages
for lost wages and other compensation benefits and to support its defense of
failure to mitigate damages. Thus, the subpoenas relating to Plaintiff’s past
and current employment are proper.
 
Based
on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s motions to quash the business record subpoenas
issued by Defendant on Valley Community Health, Mend Urgent Care, Cerebral
Inc., Millennium Medical Associates, Inc. and MemorialCare are DENIED.
 
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
            
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
