And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the hearing on Defendant Aaron Moore's motion to set aside default will be continued to February 10, 2025 at 8:30 a.m. By January 24, 2025, Aaron Moore must file a declaration setting forth facts that demonstrate the entry of default was caused by his mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. If the Plaintiff does not oppose the motion, the judge may set aside the default and require Aaron Moore to file an answer to the complaint within seven days. The judge has also ordered Aaron Moore to give notice of the continuance. The motion to set aside default was filed on November 19, 2024, which is within the six-month period allowed by law. However, the motion was only supported by a fill-in-the-blanks form and lacked specific facts to support Aaron Moore's claims.
