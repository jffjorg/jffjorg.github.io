And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This tentative ruling addresses the defendants' motion to vacate the default and default judgment entered against them in the case of OnTap Trade, Inc. v. Bram Weinkselbaum, et al. The defendants' counsel admitted fault for mistakenly believing there was an open extension and failing to obtain a written confirmation from the plaintiff's counsel. The court finds that this is a sufficient explanation to warrant mandatory relief under California Code of Civil Procedure, § 473(b). The court sets aside the default judgment and orders the defendants to file a responsive pleading within 10 days. The court also awards the plaintiff $2,316.10 for their expenses in previously securing the default judgment. The case is set for a case management conference on January 14, 2025.
