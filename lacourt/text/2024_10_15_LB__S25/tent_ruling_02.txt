 Case Number:  24LBCV00047    Hearing Date:   October 15, 2024    Dept:  S25 Case Name: OnTap Trade, Inc. v. Bram Weinkselbaum, et al.Case No. 24LBCV00047Motion: Defendants Bram Weinkselbaum and Stephanie Pogorelsky’s Motion to Vacate Default and Default JudgmentMoving Party: Defendants Bram Weinkselbaum and Stephanie Pogorelsky (“Defendants”)Responding Party: Plaintiff OnTap Trade, Inc. (“Plaintiff”)DiscussionOn January 9, 2024, Plaintiff filed this complaint. On February 27, 2024, Plaintiff filed a request for entry of default for Defendants. (February 27, 2024 Entry of Default.) On March 28, 2024, Defense counsel requested that Plaintiff’s counsel to stipulate to set aside the default. (Diefenbach Decl., ¶ 13; Exhibit 3). On April 16, 2024, it appears Plaintiff’s counsel did not agree to stipulate and, instead, choose to file a request for entry of default judgment on May 31, 2024. Default judgment was entered by this court on July 1, 2024.Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b), provides discretionary relief in that: “[t]he court may, upon any terms as may be just, relieve a party or his or her legal representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against him or her through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b).) Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b), also mandates relief in that: “the court shall, whenever an application for relief is made no more than six months after entry of judgment, is in proper form, and is accompanied by an attorney's sworn affidavit attesting to his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect, vacate any…resulting default judgment or dismissal entered against his or her client, unless the court finds that the default or dismissal was not in fact caused by the attorney's mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect. The court shall, whenever relief is granted based on an attorney's affidavit of fault, direct the attorney to pay reasonable compensatory legal fees and costs to opposing counsel or parties.” (Ibid.) A party seeking relief under section 473 on the ground of excusable neglect bears the burden of demonstrating that the neglect was excusable in order to secure relief. (Cochran v. Linn (1984) 159 Cal.App.3d 245, 252.) However, under the mandatory provision of Section 473(b), the attorney’s neglect does not need to be excusable. (Henderson v. Pacific Gas & Electric Co. (2010) 187 Cal.App.4th 215, 225.)The Court finds the motion timely as entry of judgment was on July 1, 2024 and Defendants’ motion was filed on August 22, 2024. Defendants’ counsel has admitted fault that he mistakenly believed there was an open extension but failed to obtain a writtenconfirmation from Plaintiff’s counsel. (Diefenbach Decl., ¶ 16.) The Court finds that this is a sufficient explanation to warrant mandatory relief pursuant to Section 473(b).Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b), mandates reasonable legal fees and costs when mandatory relief is granted, stating that “[t]he court shall, whenever relief is granted based on an attorney's affidavit of fault, direct the attorney to pay reasonable compensatory legal fees and costs to opposing counsel or parties.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b).) The court considers Plaintiff’s request for legal fees and costs in the amount of $15,572.28 is unreasonable.A plaintiff is not required to agree to stipulate to set aside a default. While Plaintiff’s client did not agree to stipulate to set aside the default, it was foreseeable in April 2024, prior to Plaintiff’s filing of the request for entry of default judgment, that Defendants would likely have an available remedy under Code Civ. Proc., § 473(b).Plaintiff’s Request for Entry of Default Judgment sought $7,480 in attorney’s fees and $926.90 in costs. Plaintiff did not provide a breakdown for those fees or costs. Upon further review, under Local Rule of the Court, rule 3.214(a), which should have been applied in this case, the maximum permitted in this type of action for attorney fees for a default judgment is $1,389.02.Tentative RulingDefault judgment is aside set. Defendants are ordered to file a responsive pleading within 10 days of the date of this hearing. The Court finds an award of $2,316.10 ($1,389.20 in attorney’s fees and $926.90) is reasonable for Plaintiff’s expenses in previously securing a default judgment considering Defendant’s failure to timey respond or seek relief once request for entry of default was filed. Payment is to be made within 45 days of the date of the ruling.Case management conference is set for 1/14/25 at 8:30 a.m.
