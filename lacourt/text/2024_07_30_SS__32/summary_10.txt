And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court is considering a motion for leave to file a cross-complaint by Defendant Food 4 Less of California, Inc. against American Guard Services, Lester Finnell, and Rolando Vega. The motion is granted because the proposed cross-complaint arises out of the same occurrence alleged in the complaint and generally seeks indemnification. No opposition has been filed asserting any reasons why allowing the filing would not be in the interest of justice. The Court orders Defendant to file and serve its proposed cross-complaint within ten days of the date of this Order.
