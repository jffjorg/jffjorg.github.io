And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion to reopen discovery to complete the depositions of Jason Heesch and Renny Chu, and to hear the motion as to Shayon Stamper. The judge notes that the discovery is important since it could reveal information about the subject incident from percipient witnesses. The judge declines to award sanctions since none are requested.

The judge denies the motion to compel Shayon Stamper's further deposition. The judge notes that a notice of deposition was not served, and that the provision under which the motion was made does not apply. The judge also denies the defendants' motion for a protective order to prevent further questioning of Stamper, as well as their request for monetary sanctions.

The judge orders the parties to meet and confer promptly to ensure that the depositions can be completed by the current trial date.
