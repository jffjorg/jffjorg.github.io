TENTATIVE
RULING
 



DEPT:


32




HEARING DATE:


July
  19, 2024




CASE NUMBER:


22STCV30841




MOTIONS:  


Motion
  for Terminating Sanctions   




MOVING PARTY:


Defendant Michelle D. Minott 




OPPOSING PARTY:


None
  



 
 
BACKGROUND
 
Defendant Michelle D. Minott (“Defendant”) moves for
terminating sanctions against Plaintiff Alejandro Hernandez Ignacio
(“Plaintiff”) for failure to comply with the Court’s April 17, 2024 discovery
order. No opposition has been filed. 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
“To
the extent authorized by the chapter governing any particular discovery method
or any other provision of this title, the court, after notice to any affected
party, person, or attorney, and after opportunity for hearing, may
impose…sanctions against anyone engaging in conduct that is a misuse of the
discovery process.” (Code Civ. Proc. section 2023.030.) The court may impose a
terminating sanction for misuse of the discovery process by any of the
following: “(1) An order striking out the pleadings or parts of the pleadings
of any party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process; (2) An order
staying further proceedings by that party until an order for discovery is
obeyed; (3) An order dismissing the action, or any part of the action, of that
party; (4) An order rendering a judgment by default against that party.” (Code
Civ. Proc. § 2023.030(d).)  Failing to
respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery, or
disobeying
a court order to provide discovery, constitutes a
misuse of the discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d), (g).)

 
“The trial court may order a terminating sanction for discovery abuse
‘after considering the totality of the circumstances: [the] conduct of the
party to determine if the actions were willful; the detriment to the
propounding party; and the number of formal and informal attempts to obtain the
discovery.’” (Los Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal. App. 4th 377, 390,
quoting Lang v. Hochman (2000) 77 Cal. App. 4th 1225, 1246.)   
 
“Generally, ‘[a] decision to order terminating sanctions should not be
made lightly.  But where a violation is
willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less
severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the
trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.’” (Los Defensores,
supra, 223 Cal. App. 4th at p. 390 [citation omitted].)    
 
“Under this standard, trial courts have properly imposed terminating
sanctions when parties have willfully disobeyed one or more discovery orders.”
(Los Defensores, supra, 223 Cal.App.4th at p. 390 citing Lang, supra, 77
Cal.App.4th at pp. 1244-1246 [discussing cases]; see, e.g., Collisson &
Kaplan v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1617-1622 [terminating
sanctions imposed (by striking the defendant’s Answer and subsequently granting
default judgment) after defendants failed to comply with one court order to
produce discovery]; Laguna Auto Body v. Farmers Ins. Exchange (1991) 231
Cal.App.3d 481, 491, disapproved on other grounds in Garcia v. McCutchen (1997)
16 Cal.4th 469, 478, n. 4 [terminating sanctions imposed against the plaintiff
for failing to comply with a discovery order and for violating various
discovery statutes].)  
 
“If that party or party-affiliated deponent then fails to obey an
order compelling attendance, testimony, and production, the court may make
those orders that are just, including the imposition of an issue sanction, an
evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010) against that party deponent or against the party with whom
the deponent is affiliated. In lieu of, or in addition to, this sanction, the
court may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against that deponent or against the party with whom that party
deponent is affiliated, and in favor of any party who, in person or by
attorney, attended in the expectation that the deponent's testimony would be
taken pursuant to that order.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2025.450(h).) 
 
DISCUSSION
 
On
July 25, 2023, the Court granted Plaintiff’s former counsel’s motion to be
relieved as counsel. Plaintiff is currently self-represented.  
 
Here,
on September 14, 2023, Defendant mailed notice of Plaintiff’s deposition, set
for October 16, 2023. (Smith-Mars Decl. ¶ 6.) On the date of the deposition,
Plaintiff failed to appear.
 
On
April 17, 2024, the Court granted Defendant’s unopposed motion to compel
Plaintiff’s deposition. Plaintiff was ordered to appear within 15 days’ notice
of the order. (Min. Order, 4/17/24.) On April 23, 2024, Defendant filed a
notice of the ruling which was served on Plaintiff via mail. Therefore,
Plaintiff had to appear for a deposition by May 13, 2024. The notice of the
ruling contained a meet and confer letter to coordinate a date for the
deposition. (Smith-Mars Decl. ¶ 8.)
 
On
May 14, 2024, Defendant sent a meet and confer letter reminding Plaintiff of
the overdue deposition. (Smith-Mars Decl. ¶ 9, Exh. A.) Defendant contends that
Plaintiff failed to respond to the meet and confer and has not appeared for a
deposition. 
 
The Court finds that Plaintiff has not complied with the April 17,
2024 order. Plaintiff also has been unresponsive in attempts to schedule his
deposition since September 2023. Plaintiff does not oppose this motion and
therefore fails to set forth reasons for the discovery abuse. Accordingly, the
Court grants the motion.
 
CONCLUSION
 
Therefore, Defendant’s motion for terminating sanctions is GRANTED. The complaint as
to Defendant Michelle D. Minott is dismissed without prejudice. As the only
remaining defendants are unnamed Doe defendants, the Court dismisses the
entirety of the complaint. All dates are advanced and vacated. 
 
Defendant shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file a proof
of service of such.
