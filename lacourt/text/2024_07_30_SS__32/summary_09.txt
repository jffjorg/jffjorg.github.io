And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion for terminating sanctions filed by the defendant, Michelle D. Minott, against the plaintiff, Alejandro Hernandez Ignacio. The defendant claims that the plaintiff has misused the discovery process by failing to comply with a court order to appear for a deposition. The plaintiff failed to appear for the deposition on October 16, 2023, and also failed to comply with a subsequent court order to appear for a deposition within 15 days. The defendant sent meet and confer letters to the plaintiff, but the plaintiff did not respond. The judge finds that the plaintiff has not complied with the court's order and has misused the discovery process. Therefore, the judge grants the defendant's motion for terminating sanctions and dismisses the complaint with prejudice.
