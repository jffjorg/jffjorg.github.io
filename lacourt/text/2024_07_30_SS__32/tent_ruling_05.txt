[1]
Defendant filed the original motion for summary judgment on March 29, 2023, but
subsequently on February 9, 2024, filed the amended moving papers. As a result,
the Court will only consider the most recent filings on February 9, 2024. 


[2] Although
Defendant argues that the pleadings define the scope of the issues, here, the
complaint simply alleges a “dangerous condition.” (Compl. ¶ 8, 17.)
