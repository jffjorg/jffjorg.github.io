Moving Parties:          Plaintiff, Janie Vieyra
Responding Party:      Defendant, General Motors, LLC
HEARING: MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TO REQUESTS FOR PRODUCTION
OF DOCUMENTS 
            The
Court considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers.  
RULING
Plaintiff’s motion to compel
further responses to requests 16, 27, 28, 57, 58, 63, 111 is GRANTED, and 112
and DENIED as to requests 15, 23, 24, 37, and 38.
 
Plaintiff’s request for sanctions
is DENIED.
 
BACKGROUND
            On May 3, 2023, Plaintiff Janie
Vieyra filed a complaint against Defendant General Motors, LLC for violation of
(1) violation of Civil Code §1793.2(d), (2) violation of Civil Code §1793.2(b),
(3) violation of Civil Code §1793.2(a)(3), (4) breach of the implied warranty
of merchantability, and (5) fraudulent concealment. 
 
On August 25, 2023, Plaintiff filed a FAC against the same defendant
and alleging the same causes of action.
 
A final status conference is set for April 18, 2025.
 
Trial is set for April 28, 2025.
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
The propounding party may file motions to compel further responses to requests
for production if it believes the responses received are (1) evasive, (2)
incomplete, or (3) if the objections raised are meritless or overly general.
(Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.310(a).) In response to a motion to compel further
responses, the respondent bears the burden of justifying any objections. (Fairmont
Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (2000) 22 Cal.4th 245, 255.)
 
The prevailing party on a motion to compel further responses is
entitled to sanctions pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.310(h),
which states: “Except as provided in subdivision (j), the court shall impose a
monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against
any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to
compel further response to a demand, unless it finds that the one subject to
the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances
make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”
 
REQUEST FOR
JUDICIAL NOTICE
 
            The Court DENIES Plaintiff’s
requests for judicial notice in full.
 
DISCUSSION 
 
            The Court finds that
Plaintiff satisfied the meet and confer requirements as evidenced by
Plaintiff’s counsel’s declaration, wherein he states that he met and conferred
with GM’s counsel beginning on March 26, 2024 and as recently as July 10, 2024.
(Sanaia Decl. ¶¶ 29-34.) 
 
Plaintiff alleges that General
Motors, LLC (“GM”) violated California’s Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act by
failing to repair Plaintiff’s 2018 Cadillac XT5 (“Subject Vehicle”) despite
repeated attempts, specifically regarding transmission defects and electrical
issues. Plaintiff claims GM knew about these defects and its inability to
repair them but willfully refused to repurchase the vehicle, thus violating the
Act.
 
            On March 26, 2024,
Plaintiff propounded RFP, Set One seeking documents relating to GM’s internal
investigation and analysis, among other things, of the Transmission and
Electrical
Defects. (Sanaia Decl. ¶ 22-24, Ex. 7.) Plaintiff requested several
categories of documents, including:
 
1.    
Documents related to the Subject Vehicle (RFP Nos.
1, 2, 3, 7, and 8).
2.    
Internal knowledge and investigations concerning the
electrical and transmission defects in 2018 Cadillac XT5 vehicles (RFP Nos. 15,
16, 23, 24, 27, 28, 37, 38, 49, 50, 57, 58, 63, 64, 67, and 68).
3.    
Summaries, memoranda, and presentations regarding
these defects (RFP Nos. 69, 70, 78, and 79).
4.    
GM’s policies and procedures related to the
Song-Beverly Act (RFP Nos. 84, 86, 88, and 97).
5.    
Communications with governmental agencies and
suppliers about the defects (RFP Nos. 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, and 116).
6.    
GM’s production of documents in a related class
action case, Speerly et al v. General Motors LLC (RFP Nos. 128, 130, and
131).
 
Defendant provided unverified responses
on April 24, 2024. Verifications were served on May 28, 2024. (Sanaia Decl. ¶
25, Ex. 8.) 
 
Plaintiff argues that GM has
not complied with California’s discovery rules in responding to the RFPs by using
nearly identical boilerplate objections for all requests (including RFP Nos. 1,
2, 3, 7, 8, 15, 16, 23, 24, 27, 28, 37, 38, 49, 50, 57, 58, 63, 64, 67, 68, 69,
70, 78, 79, 84, 86, 88, 97, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 128, 130, and 131),
which Plaintiff claims do not meet the specificity requirements in CCP. The
objections can be summarized as follows:
 
GM objects on the grounds that the discovery
requests are overly broad, irrelevant, and unduly burdensome. GM contends that
the discovery sought by Plaintiff extends beyond the specific issues in the
case, which concern whether GM failed to repair Plaintiff’s 2018 Cadillac XT5
within a reasonable number of attempts, as required by the warranty. GM
maintains that documents related to other vehicles, customer complaints, or the
general design of components are irrelevant to the breach of warranty claims at
hand. GM asserts that it has already complied with relevant discovery
obligations by producing documents specific to Plaintiff’s vehicle, such as
warranty history, repair orders, and applicable technical service bulletins
(TSBs). It has also agreed to produce further relevant documents upon
reasonable request.
 
GM further objects to the Plaintiff’s requests
for all repair documents, technical bulletins, and internal communications,
arguing that such requests are overreaching and unnecessary, especially when
many of these documents are publicly available or irrelevant to whether GM
repaired Plaintiff’s vehicle as per the warranty. Additionally, GM refuses to
provide information on defects in other vehicles of the same make and model,
contending that such documents are not pertinent to determining whether
Plaintiff’s specific vehicle was repaired within a reasonable timeframe. GM
also objects to producing internal policy documents related to warranties,
customer complaints, and vehicle repurchases, arguing that these are beyond the
scope of discovery for this case.
 
Regarding compliance with the California
Electronic Discovery Act, GM asserts that it has fully adhered to its
obligations concerning electronically stored information (ESI) and denies any
failure to comply. GM maintains that there is no valid basis for the court to
find a violation of the Act and argues that it should not be compelled to
produce the additional materials Plaintiff demands. 
 
However, Plaintiff contends
that these general objections lack merit and reflect a lack of good faith in
fulfilling GM’s discovery obligations, as they fail to address each request
separately or provide a specific basis for objection. Moreover, GM’s objections
that certain requests are “vague,” “ambiguous,” or irrelevant are unsupported,
and GM has not demonstrated any undue burden that would justify these
objections. Plaintiff states that the absence of any evidence or detailed
explanation to substantiate claims of burden further undermines GM’s position.
 
Additionally, Plaintiff asserts
that GM’s responses are deficient because they do not include the required
statements of compliance under section 2031.220 of the Code of Civil Procedure,
which mandates a responding party to explicitly state that they will comply
with a demand for production, including all documents or things in their
possession, custody, or control to which no objection is being made. Plaintiff
argues that GM’s omission of this statement renders its responses non-compliant
with the statutory requirements. Furthermore, Plaintiff argues that GM has
waived its objections relating to ESI because it failed to identify the types
or categories of ESI that are not reasonably accessible, as required by section
2031.210(d). 
 
In opposition, GM argues that
the Court should uphold its objections to the Plaintiff’s discovery requests,
which it contends are overly broad, irrelevant, and burdensome. GM asserts that
discovery should be limited to narrowing issues and uncovering relevant facts,
not allowing unlimited access to any information a party desires. According to
GM, Plaintiff’s requests are not tailored to the specific issues in the case
and instead constitute an improper “fishing expedition” seeking irrelevant
documents, such as those related to other vehicles, other consumers’ complaints,
or the general design of vehicle components, none of which are pertinent to the
specific breach of warranty claims concerning Plaintiff’s 2018 Cadillac XT5. GM
maintains that the case centers on whether Plaintiff’s XT5 conformed to the
warranty and whether GM repaired it within a reasonable number of attempts.
Documents related to other vehicles or GM’s general business practices are
therefore irrelevant. GM further argues that it has already complied with
discovery requests relevant to Plaintiff’s claims. It has either produced or
agreed to produce documents specifically concerning Plaintiff’s XT5, such as
the factory invoice, warranty history reports, and repair orders. GM also
states that it has provided information about applicable TSBs and recalls and
has agreed to supplement its production as needed. GM contends that Plaintiff's
requests for additional documents, including internal analyses, investigations,
and documents related to other vehicles, are facially overbroad and irrelevant
to the breach of warranty claim.
 
Moreover, GM asserts that it
has properly objected to requests for documents concerning general policies and
procedures (such as training manuals and vehicle repurchase policies) because
these documents are beyond the scope of Plaintiff’s claims. GM has already
agreed to provide specific policy documents under a protective order but argues
that further production is unwarranted. Additionally, GM refutes Plaintiff’s
claim that it failed to comply with the California Electronic Discovery Act
regarding ESI, stating that it has adhered to its obligations and that there is
no basis for finding a violation of the Act.
 
            In reply, Plaintiff
contends that GM has not provided crucial categories of documents, including
all materials related to the subject vehicle, complete internal investigations,
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) documents, internal emails,
lemon law documentation, and ESI that led to the issuance of recalls and TSBs.
Plaintiff maintains that these documents are necessary to support the civil
penalties claim and that GM’s production is incomplete and inadequate. Plaintiff
also addresses GM’s concerns about the confidentiality of certain documents,
noting that Plaintiff proposed a protective order to resolve any trade secret
issues, which GM has refused to sign. Plaintiff argues that GM is using
confidentiality as a pretext to avoid producing documents that are required
under California law. Plaintiff contends that if GM believes certain documents
are protected, it must obtain a formal court order rather than relying on unsubstantiated
claims. Moreover, Plaintiff disputes GM’s assertion that the discovery requests
are overly broad, explaining that the requests are specifically tailored to
focus on the electrical and transmission defects in vehicles of the same year,
make, and model as the Plaintiff’s vehicle. Plaintiff argues that GM is
obligated to respond in good faith based on a reasonable interpretation of the
requests and that the documents sought are already in GM’s possession.
 
Plaintiff further asserts that GM’s
claims of undue burden are unsupported by evidence. Plaintiff points out that
GM has failed to provide any factual basis, such as time, labor, or monetary
costs, to substantiate its claims of burden. Plaintiff argues that GM has not
met its initial burden of proving that the requested documents are not
reasonably accessible due to undue burden or expense, as required by law. GM’s
objections should be overruled because they are based on unsupported and
conclusory statements. Additionally, Plaintiff argues that GM has not
adequately searched its databases and document repositories for responsive
documents, despite having used these same databases in response to NHTSA
investigations. Plaintiff contends that the databases contain vital
information, such as customer complaints, warranty claims, and engineering
analyses, that are relevant to the investigation of alleged defects in GM
vehicles. Plaintiff maintains that GM must produce all documents related to
internal investigations and analyses of the defects affecting the subject
vehicle and that GM’s objections are misleading and unsupported. Lastly,
Plaintiff asserts that GM has not complied with the California Electronic
Discovery Act concerning the production of ESI. GM has failed to produce any
emails or ESI and refuses to perform the necessary searches, claiming that
court orders are required before compliance. Plaintiff argues that GM is
obligated to produce ESI and disclose its electronic search protocols, and that
GM’s failure to do so violates California law. Plaintiff requests that the
court compel GM to produce all relevant documents and provide code-compliant
responses to the discovery requests.
 
The requests at issue here, as
identified in Plaintiff’s separate statement are as follows. The Court notes
that while GM’s separate statement includes more requests, the Court only
considers the discovery requests identified by Plaintiff.
 
The requests include all
documents, including emails, related to internal analyses or investigations
regarding electrical defects (Request No. 15) and transmission defects (Request
No. 16) in Cadillac XT5 vehicles, including any root cause analyses,
development of countermeasures, failure rate investigations, and cost or
savings analyses. Additionally, Plaintiff requests documents regarding internal
investigations into root cause efforts or problem-solving concerning electrical
architecture defects (Request No. 23) and defects in the 8-speed transmission
(Request No. 24) of Cadillac XT5 vehicles. Plaintiff also seeks documents
related to field reports, dealer contacts, warranty claims, customer
complaints, and reported failures concerning electrical defects (Request No.
27) and transmission defects (Request No. 28), including GM’s responses to
these issues. 
 
Plaintiff requests documents
indicating when GM’s recall committee or task force first became aware of
electrical defects (Request No. 37) and transmission defects (Request No. 38)
in Cadillac XT5 vehicles. Plaintiff also seeks Failure Mode and Effects Analysis
reports related to electrical defects (Request No. 49) and transmission defects
(Request No. 50) in Cadillac XT5 vehicles. Plaintiff seeks all documents
related to decisions to issue notices, recalls, or technical service bulletins
concerning electrical defects (Request No. 57) and transmission defects
(Request No. 58), including underlying investigations and analyses. There are
also requests for documents related to modifications of the electrical
architecture (Request No. 63) and 8-speed transmission (Request No. 64) in
response to identified defects. Documents regarding fixes for electrical
defects (Request No. 67) and transmission defects (Request No. 68), along with
reports, assessments, and engineering reviews prepared by GM engineers or suppliers
concerning these defects (Request Nos. 69 and 70), are also requested. 
 
Plaintiff requests documents
related to software release notes for updates addressing electrical defects
(Request No. 78) and transmission defects (Request No. 79) in Cadillac XT5
vehicles. Plaintiff also seeks documents regarding investigations or communications
between GM and government agencies about electrical defects (Request No. 111)
and transmission defects (Request No. 112), as well as all Early Warning
Reports (Request No. 113) and TREAD reports (Request No. 114) submitted to
regulatory agencies. Additionally, Plaintiff requests NHTSA complaints related
to electrical defects (Request No. 115) and transmission defects (Request No.
116) in GM's possession. Further, Plaintiff asks for all deposition transcripts
of GM employees regarding transmission defects in Cadillac XT5 vehicles
(Request No. 128) and all documents produced by GM in the Speerly v. General
Motors, LLC case related to transmission defects (Request No. 130).
Finally, Plaintiff requests an index of documents regarding transmission
defects in Cadillac XT5 vehicles produced in the Speerly case (Request
No. 131). These requests aim to gather comprehensive evidence of GM’s
awareness, analysis, and response to defects in the Cadillac XT5 vehicles. 
 
The Court finds that Plaintiffs
are entitled to further responses to requests 16, 27, 28, 57, 58, 63, 111, and
112 as these requests are reasonably tailored and seek information relevant to
the alleged defects in Plaintiff’s vehicle. Request No. 16 asks for documents
concerning internal analysis or investigations into transmission defects in
vehicles of the same year, make, and model as Plaintiff’s vehicle, which is
directly related to Plaintiff’s claim regarding the transmission defect.
Requests Nos. 27 and 28 seek documents related to field reports, dealer
contacts, warranty claims, and customer complaints about electrical and
transmission defects in Cadillac XT5 vehicles, which are relevant to
determining whether GM was aware of and properly responded to known defects.
Requests Nos. 57 and 58 focus on decisions to issue notices, recalls, or
technical service bulletins concerning these defects, which are essential for
understanding GM’s response to potential safety issues and compliance with its
warranty obligations. Request No. 63 seeks documents related to any
modifications made to the electrical architecture in response to identified
defects, which is relevant to whether GM attempted to address the defect in the
Plaintiff's vehicle or similar vehicles. Similarly, Requests Nos. 111 and 112
seek documents regarding communications between GM and government agencies
about the alleged electrical and transmission defects, which are pertinent to
establishing GM’s knowledge and actions concerning these defects. The Court
finds that these requests are not overly broad and are focused on gathering
information that directly impacts Plaintiff’s claims, making them appropriate
for discovery under the applicable standards.
 
However, the Court finds that
Plaintiffs are not entitled to further responses to requests 15, 23, 24, 37,
and 38 because these requests are overly broad and seek information beyond what
is necessary or relevant to the specific claims at issue. Request No. 15
demands all documents, including emails, regarding internal analysis or
investigations into electrical defects in Cadillac XT5 vehicles. The Court
finds that the inclusion of emails and broader internal documents makes Request
No. 15 go beyond what is necessary and permitted. Similarly, Requests Nos. 23
and 24 request all documents, including emails, related to internal
investigations of potential defects in the electrical architecture and 8-speed
transmission, which are not limited to the specific year, make, and model of Plaintiff’s
vehicle or the exact defects alleged. The Court finds that these requests may encompass
a vast array of internal documents and communications, which may not be
relevant to the particular issues in this case. Requests Nos. 37 and 38, which
seek documents concerning when GM’s recall committee or task force first became
aware of electrical and transmission defects, also go beyond what is reasonably
necessary for discovery. These requests focus on internal awareness and
communications that are not directly tied to Plaintiff’s claims about GM’s
failure to repair the specific vehicle in question within a reasonable number
of attempts. The Court has already permitted discovery of relevant documents,
such as recall notices and technical service bulletins, but does not find it
necessary to compel GM to produce extensive internal communications or evidence
of internal awareness timelines. 
Thus, the Court GRANTS
Plaintiff’s motion to compel further responses to requests 16, 27, 28, 57, 58,
63, 111, and 112 and DENIES as to requests 15, 23, 24, 37, and 38. 
Sanctions
The Court DENIES Plaintiff’s
request for sanctions because it appears that there were genuine disputes
regarding the scope and relevance of the discovery requests. While Defendant’s
objections to certain requests were found to be overly broad or insufficient,
the Court does not find that Defendant acted with the intent to delay,
obstruct, or frustrate the discovery process. Defendant has made a good faith
effort to comply with discovery obligations by providing some relevant
documents and raising objections that, although not all upheld, were not
frivolous or entirely without merit.
