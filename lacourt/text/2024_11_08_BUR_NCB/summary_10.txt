And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the application for writ of attachment filed by Mitsubishi HC Capital America, Inc. against Smbat Tumanyan dba West to East Trucking. The plaintiff is seeking to secure the recovery on two finance agreements that the defendant has defaulted on. The judge finds that the plaintiff has established the probable validity of its claims for breach of contract and that the attachment is not sought for a purpose other than the recovery on the claim upon which the attachment is based. The judge orders the plaintiff to post an undertaking in the amount of $10,000.00 prior to the issuance of the writ of attachment. The case is scheduled for a hearing on November 8, 2024, where the plaintiff's counsel will be required to explain the calculations for the amounts due and owing on the agreements.
