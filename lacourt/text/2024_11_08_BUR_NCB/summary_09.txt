And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The City of Pasadena has filed a demurrer to the complaint brought by Horace B. Williams, III, and Theresa Alfred, seeking to dismiss the complaint in its entirety. The City argues that the complaint fails to state sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action against it. The judge has ruled in favor of the City, sustaining the demurrer and dismissing the complaint.

The judge found that the complaint fails to comply with the Government Claims Act, as it does not allege facts showing that a claim was timely presented or that compliance with the claims statute is excused. The judge also found that the complaint fails to allege sufficient facts for an accounting cause of action, violation of the Tom Bane Civil Rights Act, violation of Penal Code, § 832.5, fraud, and breach of contract.

The judge has given the Plaintiffs an opportunity at the hearing to provide additional facts to show whether amendment of the complaint is possible. If the Plaintiffs fail to appear at the hearing, the demurrer will be sustained without leave to amend.

The City's motion to strike allegations for punitive damages is taken off-calendar as moot, as the demurrer has already been sustained.
