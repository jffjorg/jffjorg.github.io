 [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: 
motion to compel deposition attendance of person
  most qualified and custodian(s) of record



 
BACKGROUND
A.   
Allegations
Plaintiffs Benedict Fernandes, Christina
Fernandes, and Lily Fernandes (“Plaintiffs”) allege that on July 10, 2021, they
purchased a new 2021 Honda Pilot.  They
allege they entered into an express written New Vehicle Limited Warranty with
Defendant American Honda Motor Co., Inc. (“Defendant”).  (Compl., ¶9.) 
Plaintiffs allege that the subject vehicle was
equipped with a defective 9-Speed Transmission. 
(Id., ¶¶12, 56.)  They
allege that they visited a car dealership, were assisted by a salesperson, and
had reviewed Defendant’s marketing brochures and commercials regarding the
vehicle and relied on such representations and Defendant’s reputation when
purchasing the vehicle.  (Id., ¶¶57-59.)  
Plaintiffs
allege that they delivered the subject vehicle to an authorized repair facility
with complaints that the subject vehicle felt like it was going to stall while
driving and was heavy idling, oil may be leaking due to oil marks and the oil
being low, the Bluetooth was not connecting, and the air conditioning would
drop in speed.  (Id., ¶68.)  Plaintiffs delivered the vehicle to a repair
facility on September 20, 2021, October 4, 2021, November 1, 2021, January 31,
2022, June 27, 2023, June 30, 2023, July 8, 2023, July 13, 2023, September 25,
2023, and November 11, 2023 for various issues. 
(Id., ¶¶61-70.)  
The complaint, filed May 2, 2024, alleges
causes of action for: (1) violation of Song-Beverly Act – breach of express
warranty; (2) violation of Song-Beverly Act – breach of implied warranty; and
(3) fraudulent inducement – concealment. 

On August 9, 2024, the Court sustained
Defendant’s demurrer to the 3rd cause of action without leave to
amend.  
B.    
Motions on Calendar 
On September 30, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a
motion to compel Defendant to produce a Person(s) Most Qualified and Custodian
of Records (“PMQ”) to be deposed.  
On October 28, 2024, Defendant filed an
opposition brief. 
On November 1, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a
reply brief.  
DISCUSSION

            Plaintiffs move to compel Defendant
to produce its PMQ. 
Plaintiff states that on June 24, 2024,
Plaintiff served the deposition notice for Defendant’s PMQ, seeking 54 matters
for examination and 53 requests for production of documents (“RPDs”),
scheduling the deposition for August 20, 2024 or requesting alternate dates.  (Nandivada Decl., Exs. A-B.)  On August 15, 2024, Defendant served a
response, stating that it would not produce a PMQ for August 20, 2024, but did not
provide alternative dates.  (Id.,
Ex. C.)  On August 16, 2024, Plaintiffs
sent Defendant a meet and confer letter regarding the objections.  (Id., Ex. D.)  On August 20, 2024, Plaintiffs logged onto
the video link provided in the deposition notice for the deposition, but
Defendant did not appear.  On September
10, 2024, Plaintiffs sent an email requesting dates, but Defendant did not
provide a deposition date.  (Id.,
Ex. B.)  
Plaintiff states that the matters for
examination and RPDs fall within 8 categories: (1) reports, surveys, summaries
identifying defects with the 9-speed transmission, including design and
internal testing of the 9-speed transmission (Matter Nos. 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 12,
19, 22; RPD Nos. 6, 8-10, 15, 18-31); (2) advertisements, marketing, and
communications from Defendant to its customers regarding the 9-speed
transmission (Matter Nos. 8-10, 13, 18, 26; RPD Nos. 11-13, 16, 17); (3)
corrective action to address defects with the 9-speed transmission (Matter Nos.
14, 16, 20, 21; RPD Nos. 7, 10, 14); (4) estimated costs to remove the 9-speed
transmission from the United States market (Matter Nos. 23-24; RPD Nos. 32-33);
(5) discovery regarding Defendant’s production, ESI, and evidence preservation
efforts (Matter Nos. 27, 28, 29, 38, 50-53; RPD Nos. 35-36); (6) Plaintiffs’
request for a repurchase or replacement of the vehicle (Matter Nos. 34-37; RPD
Nos. 38-40, 42); (7) repairs and warranty coverage for Plaintiffs’ vehicle
(Matter Nos. 30, 32, 33; RPD Nos. 4, 5, 37, 43, 44, 45, 52, 53); and (8) Defendant’s
policies and procedures regarding evaluation and handling of consumers’ request
for repurchase or replacement of their vehicles (Matter Nos. 39-49; RPD Nos.
41, 46-50).  (Mot. at p.9.)  
In opposition, Defendant argues that it
has never withheld the deposition of its PMQ and that deposition is currently
scheduled for November 20, 2024 to address the matters concerning the alleged
transmission and marketing issues related to the 9-speed transmission.  Defendant intends to produce 2 witnesses:
Robert Hall and Chris Martin.  Defendant
argues that it only objected to the deposition date that was unilaterally set
by Plaintiffs’ counsel.  Defendant also
argues that it provided documents to Plaintiff, including: (1) Honda Pilot
Owner’s Manual; (2) Honda Pilot Brochure; (3) Consumer Information Booklet; (4)
Honda Pilot Warranty Booklet; (5) Honda Pilot CA Emissions Warranties; (6)
Sales File for the Subject Vehicle; (7) Honda of Pasadena service records; (8)
Honda Hollywood service records; (9) ACS file; (10)Non-Confidential Warranty
History; and (11) Service Bulletins.  
In light of Defendant’s willingness to
produce PMQs and its production of documents, the Court denies the motion to
compel the deposition and production of documents.  If Plaintiffs find that the PMQs are not
qualified to speak about the topics for which they were produced or the
document production is unsatisfactory, Plaintiff may move to compel further
answers to deposition topics and RPD production following the deposition.  The Court notes that it does not view this
case as a matter of such complexity that it requires 54 separate matters of
examination or 53 document requests. Document requests at a deposition should
not be duplicative of document requests separately made. The ordinary
guidelines of 35 requests seem sufficient for this matter. 
            Plaintiffs seek $2,240 in sanctions
against Defendant and its counsel of record, SJL Law LLP.  In the opposition brief, Defendant points out
that it is not represented by SJL Law LLP, but instead by Nelson Mullins Riley
& Scarborough LLP.  Plaintiffs’
request for sanctions is denied as the request was not properly noticed and
based on the outcome of this motion.  Defendant
did not request sanctions. 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
Plaintiffs Benedict Fernandes, Christina
Fernandes, and Lily Fernandes’ motion to compel Defendant to produce a PMQ is denied
in light of the scheduled deposition date of November 20, 2024.  No sanctions will be awarded on this motion. 
Plaintiffs shall
provide notice of this order.
