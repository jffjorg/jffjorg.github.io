The judge has granted the defendant's motion to compel nonparty Thang Le & Associates Structural Engineers, Inc. (TL) to comply with a deposition subpoena for production of business records. The defendant argues that TL is a material witness in the case and that the documents requested will aid in ascertaining the timing of the plaintiffs' discovery of the SCE easement and the impact of the easement on the property and the plaintiffs' alleged plans to renovate the property. The judge has also awarded the defendant $1,660 in sanctions against TL for failing to comply with the subpoena. The judge has ordered TL to produce the requested documents within 20 days of notice of the order and to pay the sanctions within the same timeframe.
