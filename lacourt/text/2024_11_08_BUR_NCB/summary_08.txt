And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the Plaintiffs' motion to compel the Defendant, American Honda Motor Co., Inc., to produce a Person(s) Most Qualified and Custodian of Records (PMQ) for deposition. The Plaintiffs had sought to compel the Defendant to produce a PMQ to answer questions about the 9-speed transmission and marketing issues related to the 2021 Honda Pilot. The Defendant had agreed to produce 2 witnesses, Robert Hall and Chris Martin, for deposition on November 20, 2024. The Judge found that the Defendant had already produced documents and was willing to produce PMQs, and therefore denied the motion to compel. The Judge also denied the Plaintiffs' request for sanctions, which sought $2,240 in damages.
