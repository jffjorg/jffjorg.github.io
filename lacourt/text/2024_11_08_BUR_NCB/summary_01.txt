Summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling in a civil case (Case Number: 21GDCV01353) involving a group of plaintiffs (andrew bergman, et al.) against several defendants (isaac blocher, et al.). The case involves allegations of breach of fiduciary duty, conversion, fraud, negligence, breach of written contract, and breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The plaintiffs invested $2,437,488 into Shepherds LLC, a company managed by Isaac Blocher, who allegedly made false promises to induce the investment. The defendants have filed a cross-complaint, and the case has been stayed due to the filing of bankruptcy petitions by several defendants. The plaintiff has moved to compel further responses from three defendants, but the motions are taken off-calendar due to the stay. The court sets a status conference for April 23, 2025, and the plaintiff is required to provide notice of this order.
