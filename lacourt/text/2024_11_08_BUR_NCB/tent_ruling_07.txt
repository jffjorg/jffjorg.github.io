Case
  No.: 24NNCV00476
 
  Hearing Date:  November 8, 2024
 
 [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
motions to compel discovery responses; requests for sanctions
 



 
There are 4
motions on calendar. 
On October 4,
2024, Plaintiff Alberto Licea (“Plaintiff”) filed 3 motions to compel initial responses
from Defendant Nissan North America, Inc. (“Defendant”) for: (1) Form
Interrogatories (“FROG”), set one; (2) Special Interrogatories (“SROG”), set
one; and (3) Request for Production of Documents (“RPD”), set one.  Plaintiff also filed a motion for order
deeming Requests for Admissions (“RFA”), set one, admitted.  
On August 9,
2024, Plaintiff served on Defendant the discovery requests, such that responses
were due by September 9, 2024.  Plaintiff
states that his counsel attempted to meet and confer with Defendant prior to filing
this motion.  As of the filing of the
motions, Plaintiff states that he has not received responses from Defendant.  
Plaintiff’s unopposed
motions to compel responses to the FROG, SROG, and RPD are granted pursuant to
CCP §§ 2030.290 and 2031.300.  Defendant
is ordered to provide verified responses to Plaintiff’s discovery
requests, without
objections, within 20 days of notice of this order.  
Plaintiff’s unopposed
motion for an order deeming the RFAs admitted is granted, pursuant to CCP § 2033.280.  
Plaintiff requests
sanctions against Defendant and its attorney in the amount of $2,760 per motion
(= [4 hours on the motion + 2 anticipated hours to review the opposition,
prepare the reply, and attend the hearing, at $450/hour], plus $60 in filing
fees).  The requests are granted in the
amount of $800 total for attorney’s fees on the 4 motions, plus $240 in filing
fees, as these were relatively simple and essentially identical motions to
compel initial responses.  Defendant and its counsel of record, jointly and severally, are ordered to
pay monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,040 to Plaintiff, by
and through counsel, within 20 days of notice of this order. 
Plaintiff shall provide
notice of this order.
