And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the motion to be relieved as counsel filed by Plaintiff's counsel, Derek A. Newman and Keith Scully of Newman LLP, is granted. The breakdown in the working relationship between the Plaintiff and Counsel has led to Counsel seeking to withdraw from representing the Plaintiff. The judge finds that there is sufficient time for the Plaintiff to obtain substitute counsel, given the upcoming hearing dates, including a Mandatory Settlement Conference, Final Status Conference, and Trial. The judge orders that the motion to be relieved as counsel is granted, and the order will become effective upon the filing of a proof of service of a signed copy of the order on the Plaintiff.
