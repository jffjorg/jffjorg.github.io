  order RE:
motion to be relieved as counsel



 
Plaintiff’s counsel, Derek A. Newman and
Keith Scully of Newman LLP (“Counsel”), moves to be relieved as counsel for
Plaintiff Michael L. Zinna (“Plaintiff”). 

Counsel filed this instant motion to be
relieved as counsel on October 10, 2024.  Counsel has filed the requisite forms pursuant
to CRC Rule 3.1362.  
According to the declaration of Counsel,
Counsel seeks to be relieved as counsel because there has been a breakdown in
the working relationship with Plaintiff. 
(MC-052, §2.)  For these reasons,
Counsel seeks to withdraw from representing Plaintiff in this action.  
Counsel properly served Plaintiff at his
last known mailing address, which was confirmed by email within the past 30
days of filing the motion.  Defense
counsel was also served with the motion by mail. 
As for future hearing dates, a Mandatory
Settlement Conference is set for January 3, 2025, the Final Status Conference
is set for April 3, 2025, and the Trial is set for April 14, 2025.  Thus, there is sufficient time for Plaintiff
to obtain substitute counsel. 
Accordingly, the motion to be relieved as
counsel is granted.  The order electronically
lodged by Counsel will be signed at the hearing.  The order will become effective upon the
filing of a proof of service of a signed copy of the order on Plaintiff.  
Notice to be provided by Counsel.
