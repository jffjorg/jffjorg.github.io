And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge John J. Kralik regarding a motion to strike filed by Plaintiff Unite Welding Enterprises, Inc. against Contractor Defendants E Roane Construction Management, Inc., Christopher David Dillon, Edward Deane Roane, Dillon Roane A Joint Venture Inc., and Dillon Construction Inc.

The Plaintiff alleges that the Contractor Defendants did not include an attorney's fees clause in their answer to the Second Amended Complaint (SAC) and that there is no statutory basis for the Contractor Defendants to recover attorney's fees. The Contractor Defendants argue that the oral agreement between the parties does not specify whether attorney's fees are included, and that they have not identified a statute under which attorney's fees are permitted.

The Judge grants the motion to strike, but allows the Contractor Defendants one opportunity to amend their answer to allege a contractual or statutory basis for attorney's fees, if possible. The Judge also gives the Plaintiff 20 days to amend its complaint.
