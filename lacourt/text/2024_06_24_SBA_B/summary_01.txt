Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel the deposition of Defendant's Person Most Knowledgeable and to produce certain documents. The motion was granted as to Categories Nos. 17, 18, and 30-34, and denied as to Category No. 29. The court ordered Defendant to produce for deposition its Person(s) Most Knowledgeable within twenty days. The request for sanctions was denied. The court found that Defendant's objections lacked merit as to Nos. 17, 18, and 30-34, and that the motion was moot as to the requests for production of documents at the deposition. The court also denied the request for sanctions, finding that the notice was deficient under CCP §2023.040.
