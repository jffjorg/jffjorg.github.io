BACKGROUND
            On December 29, 2022, plaintiff
Enrique Salas filed a complaint against Nissan North American, Inc. for violations
of statutory obligations under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act and
fraudulent concealment.
LEGAL AUTHORITY
            CCP §2025.450(a) provides:  “If, after service of a deposition notice, a
party to the action or an officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a
party, . . , without having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410,
fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for
inspection any document . . . described in the deposition notice, the party
giving the notice may move for an order compelling the deponent’s attendance
and testimony, and the production for inspection of any document . . .
described in the deposition notice.” 
CCP §2025.450(b) provides, “A
motion under subdivision (a) shall comply with both of the following:
(1)        The
motion shall set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the
production for inspection of any document, electronically stored information,
or tangible thing described in the deposition notice.
(2)        The
motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section
2016.040, or, when the deponent fails to attend the deposition and produce the
documents, electronically stored information, or things described in the
deposition notice, by a declaration stating that the petitioner has contacted
the deponent to inquire about the nonappearance.”
CCP
§2025.230 states:  “If the deponent named
is not a natural person, the deposition notice shall describe with reasonable
particularity the matters on which examination is requested.  In that event,
the deponent shall designate and produce at the deposition those of its officers,
directors, managing agents, employees, or agents who are most qualified to
testify on its behalf as to those matters to the extent of any information
known or reasonably available to the deponent.”
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff
Enrique Salas requests that the Court compel the deposition of defendant Nissan
North America, Inc.’s Person Most Knowledgeable (“PMK”), Nos. 1 through 34
along with Request for Production, Nos. 1 through 24. 
The
complaint alleges that on March 17, 2020, plaintiff leased a 2020 Nissan
Sentra.  The subject vehicle was
delivered to plaintiff with serious defects and nonconformities to warranty,
such as suspension, steering, electrical, and structural system defects,
including those listed in the repair history. 
Plaintiff’s repair history includes presenting to defendant’s authorized
repair facility on May 31, 2020 (116 miles), April 27, 2020 (1037 miles), May
20, 2020 (1519 miles), January 11, 2021 (10,130 miles), November 16, 2021
(20,193 miles), May 5, 2022 (23,881 miles), October 19, 2022 (29,967 miles) for
complaints regarding inoperative remote start function on key remote, improper
engagement of Automatic Emergency Braking, faulty fuel door latch, stuck
driver’s side buckle, abnormal clicking noise upon turning left, infotainment
system changing color, abnormal clicking noise upon turning he steering wheel.  None of the repair attempts successfully
repaired the subject vehicle.
Plaintiff
argues defendant’s knowledge of the defects plaguing the subject vehicle is through
its internal investigation and analysis of customer complaints, warranty data,
field service reports, recalls and product evaluations. 
Plaintiff
explains that on November 10, 2023, plaintiff served a notice of deposition and
document demand for Nissan’s PMK, for November 30, 2023.  On November 21, 2023, defendant served its
objections.  On March 14, 2024, plaintiff
served an amended notice of deposition of defendant’s PMK, for May 28, 2024,
along with a detailed meet and confer letter, asking for alternative dates for
before June 11, 2024.  On May 24, 2024,
defendant served its objections.
Plaintiff
argues that the scope of discovery is broad, and that defendant’s objections
are without merit.  Plaintiff also argues
that the categories and requests are directly relevant to plaintiff’s claims as
to whether defendant complied with the Song-Beverly Act.  Plaintiff further contends that they are also
relevant to defendant’s monitoring, discussions, internal investigations, and
analysis of the various defects contained in the vehicle and to establishing
defendant previously knew of these defects but yet refused to replace or
repurchase it.  Plaintiff asserts that as
evidenced by its own Technical Service Bulletins, and like records, the
testimony and documents will establish that defendant is and has been aware of
the defects, that the defects are ongoing, and that defendant is unable to
repair the defects, and that despite all of this information, defendant acted
in bad faith by willfully violating the Song Beverly Act by refusing to accept
the return of plaintiff’s vehicle.
In
opposition, defendant contends that plaintiff failed to adequately meet and
confer as to Nissan’s objections to the categories of examination or documents
served on May 24, 2024.  Rather,
defendant asserts, plaintiff “merely sought a date upon which the PMK witness
would be produced,” and Nissan complied by providing plaintiff’s counsel with a
date for the deposition to take place on July 29, 2024.
In reply,
plaintiff contends that Nissan produced a PMK on June 14, 2024 but that the
deponent was not produced for matters of examination Nos. 17, 18, and 29-34.  Thus, those categories remain at issue.   
The Court
rules as follows:  As stated in the
reply, Nissan produced its PMK on June 14, 2024.  According to plaintiff, the deponent failed
to testify as to categories Nos. 17, 18, and 29-34.  It appears that the motion is moot as to the
requests for production of documents at the deposition.  The Court addresses the categories that
remain at issue and considers defendant’s objections.  The Court finds that defendant’s objections
lack merit as to Nos. 17, 18, and 30-34. 
As to No. 29, the category is overly broad as to time and plaintiff has
not shown good cause.
Accordingly,
the motion is GRANTED as to Categories Nos. 17, 18, and 30-34, and DENIED as to
Category No. 29.
Sanctions
If a motion to compel deposition is
granted, the court shall impose a monetary sanction in favor of the party who
noticed the deposition and against the deponent or the party with whom the
deponent is affiliated, unless the court finds that the one subject to the
sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make
the imposition of the sanction unjust. CCP §2025.450(g)(1).
Under CCP §2023.030(a), “[t]he
court may impose a monetary sanction ordering that one engaging in the misuse
of the discovery process, or any attorney advising that conduct, or both pay
the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a
result of that conduct. If a monetary sanction is authorized by any provision
of this title, the court shall impose that sanction unless it finds that the
one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” Under CCP §2023.010,
an example of the misuse of the discovery process is “(d) Failing to respond or
to submit to an authorized method of discovery.”
The Court DENIES plaintiff’s
request for sanctions as the notice is deficient under CCP §2023.040 as the
notice does not “identify every person, party, and attorney against whom the
sanction is sought, and specify the type of sanction sought.”
ORDER
The
motion is GRANTED as to Categories Nos. 17, 18, and 30-34, and DENIED as to No.
29, and MOOT as to the balance.
Defendant
is ordered to produce for deposition its Person(s) Most Knowledgeable within
twenty days. 
The
request for sanctions is DENIED.
Plaintiff
is ordered to give notice.
