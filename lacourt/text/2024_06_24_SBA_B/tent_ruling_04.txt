Parties:                      Plaintiff Rodolfo Q. Nicdao
Responding
Party:                  Defendant American Honda Motor Co.
Motion
to Compel Compliance with Defendant’s Own Response to Request for Production of
Documents, Set One
 
            The court considered the moving, opposition,
and reply papers.
RULING
            The motion is DENIED as MOOT. 
BACKGROUND
            On November 20, 2023, plaintiff
Rodolfo Nicdao filed a complaint against American Honda Motor Company, Inc. for
violations of statutory obligations under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty
Act based on the purchase of a 2021 Honda Accord.
            On March 15, 2024, plaintiff filed a
FAC.
LEGAL AUTHORITY
            “(a) If a party filing a response to
a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling under Sections 2031.210,
2031.220, 2031.230, 2031.240, and 2031.280 thereafter fails to permit the
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling in accordance with that party's
statement of compliance, the demanding party may move for an order compelling
compliance.
(b) Except as provided in
subdivision (d), the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel compliance with a demand,
unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust.”  CCP §2031.320.
DISCUSSION
            Plaintiff
requests an order compelling defendant American Honda’s compliance with its own
response to plaintiff’s Requests for Production of Documents, Set One, pursuant
to CCP §2031.320.
            Plaintiff
explains that on January 19, 2024, he served his Request for Production of
Documents, Set One on defendant.  On
March 21, 2024, defendant served its responses. 
As to Nos. 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 86, 89, 90, 91, 96, 98, 100, 103, 115,
116, and 134, defendant responded that subject to and without waiving certain
objections, “the requested production will be allowed in whole and all
documents specific to the subject vehicle maintained in AHM’s database that are
in the possession, custody, or control of AHM and to which no objections are
being made will be included in the production” and specified certain documents
or that it would produce documents “pursuant to the entry of an appropriate
protective order.”  On April 15, 2024,
plaintiff’s counsel sent an email to defense counsel requesting the
documents.  On April 18, defense counsel
responded that they would “look into these productions.”  On April 22, 2024, plaintiff’s counsel sent a
follow-up request for defendant’s production of responsive documents.  Plaintiff asserts that, as of the filing date
of the motion (on May 15, 2024), defendant had not served any responsive
documents.
On May
30, 2024, the Joint Stipulation and Protective Order, Confidential Designation
Only was entered.  
In
opposition, defendant argues that there was no unreasonable delay.  It asserts that on May 16, 2024, even before
the protective order was entered, it produced 1124 pages of documents.
In reply,
plaintiff requests monetary sanctions because defendant “stalled more than two
months to produce its promised documents.”
The Court
finds that the motion is MOOT in light of defendant’s production of
documents.  As for sanctions, the motion
is DENIED as it appears that defendant produced documents once the stipulation
was submitted to the court on May 16, 2024, thus acting with “substantial
justification.”
 
ORDER
            The
motion is DENIED as MOOT. 
            Plaintiff
is ordered to give notice of ruling.
