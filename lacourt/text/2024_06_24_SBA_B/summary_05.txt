And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the motion to set aside the default judgment entered against defendants Chun Kil Chong, Min Ju Bark, and Richard Chong. The defendants claimed that they made an appointment with an attorney, Howard Lee, who helped them prepare an answer to the complaint, but it was filed under Chun Kil Chong's name only. They did not learn about the default until they appeared at a case management conference on April 16, 2024. The court finds that the defendants have met their burden of showing that the defaults were entered based on their mistake, inadvertence, and/or neglect, and grants the motion to set aside the defaults. The defendants are ordered to file a responsive pleading forthwith.
