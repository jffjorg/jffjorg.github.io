And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in plain English:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to strike certain parts of a complaint filed by the plaintiffs against the defendant. The defendant, Vince Valdez, is accused of breaching a contract and failing to pay back loans. The plaintiffs are seeking to recover interest and principal from the loans, but the defendant argues that the loans are usurious and therefore invalid.

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to strike, meaning that the plaintiffs' claims will proceed. However, the judge has also declined to make a ruling on whether the loans are usurious and whether the plaintiffs are entitled to 10% interest or no interest. This issue will need to be decided at a later stage in the litigation.

The defendant is ordered to file an answer to the complaint within 20 days, and the plaintiffs are ordered to give notice of the ruling.
