And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the defendant's motion to compel responses to interrogatories and has ordered the plaintiffs to respond without objections to the defendant's Form Interrogatories, Set One and Special Interrogatories, Set One within 20 days. Additionally, the court has ordered the plaintiffs to pay a monetary sanction to the defendant in the amount of $490 within 30 days. The defendant had served written discovery on the plaintiffs on December 11, 2023, but the plaintiffs failed to respond despite the defendant's attempts to extend the deadlines for responses. The court found that the defendant properly served the written discovery and that the plaintiffs waived their objections by failing to respond.
