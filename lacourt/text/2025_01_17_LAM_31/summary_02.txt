And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the motion to quash service of summons filed by defendant Liliana Frankel, finding that the exercise of personal jurisdiction over her would be unreasonable. According to the court, the plaintiff, Arturo Viscarra, has not filed an opposition to the motion and therefore has not met his initial burden to justify the exercise of jurisdiction. Additionally, Frankel has established that she lacks sufficient minimum contacts with California, as she is a non-resident defendant who lives in Mexico and has never resided in California or been employed by a company with headquarters in California. As a result, the court has granted the motion and quashed the service of process.
