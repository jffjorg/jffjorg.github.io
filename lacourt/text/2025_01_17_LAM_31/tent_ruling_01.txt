MOVING PARTY:               Plaintiffs and Cross-Defendants Jeff Kwatinetz and
Prospect Park, LLC
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     Defendant and Cross-Complainant Azealia
Banks


 
I.          INTRODUCTION
            
This action arises from the deterioration of a business relationship
between Jeff Kwatinetz (“Kwatinetz”), founder and manager of music production
company, Prospect Park, LLC, and Azealia Banks (“Banks”), a recording artist
and rapper.  
 
            On September 20, 2021, Kwatinetz and
Prospect Park, LLC (collectively, “Plaintiffs”), initiated this action against
Banks and Lasagna Girl, LLC (collectively, “Defendants”).  The operative
is the First Amended Complaint (FAC).  The
FAC alleged the causes of action for (1) Breach of Implied Covenant of Good
Faith and Fair Dealing; (2) Interference with Contractual Relations; (3)
Defamation; (4) Trade Libel; (5) Stalking in Violation of California Civil Code
Section 1708.7; (6) Invasion of Privacy; (7) Civil Extortion, and (8)
Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress.
 
Procedural History
 
            On November 14, 2023, Banks filed a
Special Motion to Strike Pursuant to C.C.P § 425.16 to the Eighth Cause of
Action for Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress in the FAC. The motion
was denied on April 30, 2024. 
 
            On May 2, 2024, Banks filed a Notice
of Appeal of the court’s April 30, 2024, order. 

 
            On May 3, 2024, the court stayed the
entire action pending resolution of Banks’s appeal.
 
            On July 18, 2024, a Notice of
Default was issued as to Banks’s appeal.
 
            On August 13, 2024, Plaintiffs filed
this motion to partially lift the stay as to all causes of action not embraced
by Banks’s appeal.  The hearing was
continued to September 6, 2024. 
 
            On September 6, 2024, after oral
argument, the court continued the hearing on the motion to October 8, 2024, to
allow the Court of Appeal to determine the status of the appeal. 
 
On September 23, 2024, the court
granted Defendants’ counsel’s motion to be relieved as counsel.  
 
            On September 24, 2024, the Second
District Court of Appeal granted Banks’s motion for relief from default.  
 
            On October 8, 2024, after oral
argument, the court continued the hearing on the motion and directed Plaintiffs
to file a status report regarding the appeal. 
 
            On October 17, 2024, Plaintiffs filed
a status report indicating Banks’s opposition to Plaintiffs Motion to Dismiss
the appeal is due by October 18, 2024, and further, that Banks’s counsel also
filed a motion to withdraw as counsel in the appeal.
 
            The motion was heard on October 22,
2024.  Based on Plaintiffs’ status
report, the court continued the hearing for the motion to December 10, 2024,
pending resolution of the issues in the Court of Appeal.  At Plaintiffs’ request, the court set an
OSC regarding status of counsel for Defendants for December 10, 2024. 
 
            On November 7, 2024, the
Court of Appeal denied Banks’s counsel’s motion to withdraw as counsel and
denied Plaintiffs’ motion to dismiss the appeal.
 
            On December
4, 2024, Defendants filed a substitution of attorney. 
 
The court now rules as follows.
 
II.        DISCUSSION
& LEGAL STANDARD
 
The court previously issued orders
stating an intent to deny Plaintiffs motion to lift the stay because Banks’s
appeal embraces or affects more than Plaintiffs’ Eighth Cause of Action for
IIED.  It is well settled law that an appeal
of ruling denying a special motion to strike automatically “stays all further
trial court proceedings on the merits upon the causes of action affected by the
motion.” (Varian Medical Systems, Inc. v. Delfino (2005) 35 Cal.4th 180,
186.)  The court need not belabor the
point further.
 
Nonetheless, the court continued
the hearing pending resolution of Banks’s counsel’s motion to withdraw as
counsel and Plaintiffs’ motion to dismiss the appeal.  The Court of Appeal has denied those
respective motions.  The appeal is moving
forward.  Accordingly, another
continuance of Plaintiffs’ motion is unnecessary.  The court now denies Plaintiffs’ motion.  
 
III.      CONCLUSION
 
The Motion to Partially Lift the Stay is DENIED. 
The stay remains in effect.
 
Pursuant to the Substitution of Attorney filed on December 4, 2024, the
Order to Show Cause re: Status of Counsel for Defendants is DISCHARGED. 
 
Defendants to give notice.
