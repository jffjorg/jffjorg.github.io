Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for summary judgment filed by Starbucks Corporation and The Vons Companies, Inc. The plaintiff, Dalia Mahgerefteh, claims that she was injured when a cup of hot tea spilled on her due to the negligence of the defendants.

The defendants argue that the plaintiff's own actions caused the accident, as her companion, Moses Javaheri, removed and replaced the lids on both cups. The court agrees with the defendants' argument, stating that the plaintiff cannot show causation because of Javaheri's actions.

The defendants also argue that they had no duty to warn that the hot tea was hot because it was an obvious danger. The court agrees with this argument, stating that the hot tea was an obvious risk and that there is no need to warn of known risks under either a negligence or strict liability theory.

Furthermore, the defendants argue that they had no role in the accident because they did not control the premises nor the employees who were manning the Starbucks kiosk. The court agrees with this argument, stating that there is no evidence to support the plaintiff's claim that the defendants failed to properly comply with industry standards.

Based on the above findings, the court grants the defendants' motion for summary judgment, dismissing the plaintiff's claim.
