And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to vacate an entry of default judgment in a collections case between Bank of America, N.A. (Plaintiff) and Babak Vahabzadeh (Defendant). The Defendant argues that he was not properly served with the summons and complaint, and presents evidence to contradict the rebuttable presumption of proper service. Since the Plaintiff has not opposed the motion, the Court will vacate the entry of default judgment. The Court finds that the Defendant has raised a valid issue regarding personal jurisdiction due to improper service, and that the Plaintiff has failed to establish proper service.
