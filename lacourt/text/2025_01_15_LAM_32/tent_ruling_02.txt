     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
plaintiff’s motion for sanctions (CRS#
  7271)




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On September 5, 2023, Plaintiff VISM
Studio filed this action against Defendants Woo-Jin Choi and Eunmi Song,
alleging breach of contract. The complaint alleges that Choi and Song breached
their employment contracts by abandoning their positions at VISM’s tattoo
studio, causing lost profits. The operative First Amended Complaint was filed
on August 26, 2024. The FAC adds defendants Grey Studio, LLC, John Prezas, and
Andres Navarro Garcia. The FAC also adds causes of action for fraud,
contractual interference, and interference with economic advantage. The FAC
alleges that Choi and Song left VISM to work for Grey Studio, a rival tattoo
parlor owned by Prezas and Garcia. 
            Choi and Song have cross-complained
against VISM, with the operative Second Amended Cross-Complaint (SACC) filed on
June 5, 2024. The SACC asserts causes of action for (1) breach of the implied
covenant of good faith and fair dealing, (2) intentional misrepresentation, (3)
negligent misrepresentation, (4) unfair business practices, and (5) common
count – goods and services rendered. The SACC alleges that Choi and Song were
induced into working for VISM through false promises. VISM also allegedly required
Choi and Song to pay VISM’s staff for overtime and allegedly instructed Choi
and Song to stop working before May 15, 2023 to prevent them from receiving
certain commissions for the month of April 2023.
            On October 30, 2024, Choi and Song
filed a motion to strike against the FAC. On November 1 and 5, 2024, Grey
Studio, Prezas, and Garcia (collectively, Grey Defendants) filed a demurrer and
motion to strike against the FAC. On November 27, 2024, the Court sustained the
demurrer and denied both motions to strike. 
            On November 26, 2024, VISM filed the
instant motion for sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure section 128.7 based
on Choi’s and Song’s filing of the motion to strike. Choi and Song filed their
opposition on December 23, 2024. VISM filed its reply on January 8, 2025. 
LEGAL STANDARD
By presenting or advocating a pleading or
petition to the court, an attorney represents that the pleading is made for a
proper purpose and is supported by the law and evidence. (Code Civ. Proc., §
128.7(b).) The court may sanction the attorneys or parties responsible for a
violation of this provision. (Id., §128.7(c).) Such a sanction is
limited to what is sufficient to deter repetition of the offending conduct and
may include nonmonetary sanctions. (Id., §128.7(d).) 
            The bar for imposing sanctions under
Section 128.7 is high. “Because our adversary system requires that attorneys
and litigants be provided substantial breathing room to develop and assert
factual and legal arguments, sanctions should not be routinely or easily
awarded even for a claim that is arguably frivolous and instead should be made
with restraint.” (Kumar v. Ramsey (2021) 71 Cal.App.5th 1110, 1121,
internal citations omitted.) A claim is frivolous only if it is “totally and
completely without merit.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 128.5(b)(2).) 
DISCUSSION
            The Court does not find that the
motion to strike was totally and completely without merit. Although the motion was
denied, Choi and Song made reasonable arguments and were entitled to challenge
the allegations pertaining to punitive damages, attorney’s fees, and
prejudgment interest. The mere fact that they lost does not make the motion
frivolous.  
            VISM also argues that the motion was
procedurally improper because it was untimely and defense counsel failed to
meet and confer. However, a court may strike a complaint or a portion thereof “at
any time in its discretion, and upon terms it deems proper.” (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 436.) Furthermore, “[t]here is no absolute right to have a pleading stricken
for lack of timeliness in filing where no question of jurisdiction is involved,
and where, as here, the late filing was a mere irregularity.” (McAllister v.
County of Monterey (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 253, 281.) “[T]he granting or
denial of the motion is a matter which lies within the discretion of the
court.” (Id. at pp. 281-82.) And inadequate meet and confer is not a
reason to deny a motion to strike. (Code Civ. Proc., § 435.5(a)(4).) Even
assuming the motion was procedurally improper, that alone would not support
sanctions. Defense counsel reasonably believed that the Court had discretion to
hear the motion. 
CONCLUSION
            VISM’s motion for sanctions is
DENIED.
