And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is in response to the plaintiffs' motion to compel compliance with a prior court order regarding the deposition of Touchstone Golf, LLC's personnel. The plaintiffs argue that Touchstone failed to produce documents demanded in the deposition notice by the date of the originally-set deposition and that Touchstone refuses to provide the availability of its personnel. The judge finds that Touchstone's failure to produce documents is not justified, as the documents were not due on the date of the deposition. The judge grants the motion to compel compliance with the deposition, ordering the deposition of two personnel to take place on specific dates. The judge also orders Touchstone to produce documents at the depositions. Additionally, the judge grants sanctions in the amount of $3,500 to be paid by Touchstone for its continuous failure to produce electronic discovery.
