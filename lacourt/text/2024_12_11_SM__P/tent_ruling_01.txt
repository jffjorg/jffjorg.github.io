State Farm Mutual Automobile
Insurance v. Dorian, Case no. 24SMCV04603
Hearing date December 11, 2024
Plaintiff
State Farm’s Motions to Compel Further Discovery
Plaintiff
State Farm Mutual insured Cobos. Defendant Dorian sustained injuries while a
passenger in Cobos’ vehicle when it was struck by an underinsured motorist.
Defendant filed a claim against plaintiff. Plaintiff served special
interrogatories (set two) and a demand production of documents (set two) on
8/16/24. Defendant served responses 9/14/24. Plaintiff moves to compel further
discovery. 
Plaintiff’s
RFPs requested documents regarding injuries, treatment, amounts billed and paid
and special interrogatories requesting names of health care providers and
charges. This is all relevant and discoverable. That such documentation or
information may already be in plaintiff’s possession does not obviate the need
for defendant to provide verified responses to the discovery.
The
reply misstates this department's IDC policy; such is typically required prior
to filing motions. The parties should have met and conferred. They did not. The
parties should have scheduled an IDC. They did not. These motions could and
should have been resolved informally. They were not. Motions granted. Sanctions
denied. Verified responses within 20 days.
