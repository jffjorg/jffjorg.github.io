The tentative ruling of Judge [Judge's name] in the case of State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance v. Dorian (Case No. 24SMCV04603) sets forth the court's intentions regarding State Farm's motions to compel further discovery. The defendant, Dorian, sustained injuries while a passenger in Cobos' vehicle, which was struck by an underinsured motorist. Dorian filed a claim against State Farm, which is insured by State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance. State Farm served special interrogatories and a demand production of documents, and Dorian responded. However, State Farm moves to compel further discovery, citing the lack of verified responses from Dorian. The court finds that the parties failed to meet and confer, as required, and failed to schedule an IDC (initial discovery conference). As a result, the court grants State Farm's motions to compel further discovery, denying sanctions. Dorian is ordered to provide verified responses within 20 days.
