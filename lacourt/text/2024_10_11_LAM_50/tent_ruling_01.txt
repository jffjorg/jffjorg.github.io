  ORDER RE:
 
DEFENDANT CITY
  OF LOS ANGELES’ DEMURRER TO PLAINTIFF JONATHAN THOMAS ELIE’S COMPLAINT



 
Background
On May 16, 2024, Plaintiff Jonathan Thomas Elie (“Plaintiff”) filed
this action against Defendants City of Los Angeles, Barbara Romero, and Mark
Fernandez. 
On May 29, 2024, Plaintiff filed the operative First Amended Complaint
(“FAC”). The FAC alleges causes of action for (1) race discrimination, (2)
racial harassment, hostile work environment, (3) retaliation, (4) associational
race discrimination, (5) associational race harassment, (6) “failure to
investigate, failure to prevent racial discrimination, harassment,
retaliation,” and (7) defamation. 
City of Los Angeles (the “City”) now demurs to each of the causes of
action of the FAC. Plaintiff opposes.  
Discussion 
As an initial matter, on
July 5, 2024, the City filed a “Declaration of Demurring or Moving Party in
Support of Automatic Extension,” which provides, inter alia, that “[d]ue
to Defense counsel’s schedule, Defense counsel has not been able to schedule a
meet and confer with Plaintiff’s counsel prior to the deadline. Defendant’s
counsel intends to schedule a meet and confer the week of July 8, 2024 and will
proceed as necessary thereafter.” However, it does not appear that the City
filed any declaration in connection with the demurrer demonstrating that the
parties ever met and conferred in person, by telephone, or by video conference,
or that the City’s counsel
attempted to do so. 
In addition, in the
opposition, Plaintiff asserts that the “demurrer should be rejected because [the
City] never complied with their Code of Civil Procedure
§ 430.41(a) mandatory meet-and-confer requirements…” (Opp’n at p. 2:1-2.) In
the reply, the City acknowledges that it left out “a section in Defendant’s
Demurrer relating to Defendant’s counsel’s inability to engage in the meet-and-confer
process due to unexpected work conflicts.” (Reply at p. 5:18-19.) 
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
430.41, subdivision (a), “[b]efore filing a
demurrer pursuant to this chapter, the demurring party shall meet and
confer in person, by telephone, or by video conference with the
party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the purpose of
determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the
objections to be raised in the demurrer.” (Emphasis added.) Such
meeting and conferring must be done in good faith with an effort to try to
resolve the issues subject to the demurrer. 
In light of the foregoing,
the hearing on the City’s demurrer
is continued to _______________,
2024 at 2:00 p.m. in Dept. 50.  
The City is ordered to meet¿and confer¿with Plaintiff within 10 days
of the date of this order.¿If the parties are unable to resolve the pleading
issues¿or if the parties are otherwise unable to meet and confer in good faith,
the City is to¿thereafter¿file and serve¿a declaration setting forth the
efforts to meet and confer in compliance with¿Code of Civil
Procedure section 430.41, subdivision (a)(3) within 15 days of this order.¿
