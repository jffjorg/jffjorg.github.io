Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The City of Los Angeles has filed a demurrer to each cause of action in the First Amended Complaint filed by Plaintiff Jonathan Thomas Elie. However, the City failed to meet and confer with Plaintiff before filing the demurrer as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41, subdivision (a). The City has acknowledged that it did not comply with the meet-and-confer requirements and has left out a section in its demurrer relating to its inability to engage in the meet-and-confer process due to unexpected work conflicts. The judge has continued the hearing on the City's demurrer to October 11, 2024, and has ordered the City to meet and confer with Plaintiff within 10 days of the date of this order. If the parties are unable to resolve the pleading issues or if the parties are otherwise unable to meet and confer in good faith, the City must file and serve a declaration setting forth the efforts to meet and confer within 15 days of this order.
