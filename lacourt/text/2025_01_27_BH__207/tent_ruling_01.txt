CAUSE OF ACTION: Temporarily [sic] and Permanent Injunctive Relief
 
Defendant Holly Hill Investments, LLC (“Holly Hill”) claims it is the
current owner of the property, as demonstrated by a December 11, 2023 judgment
quieting title to the property in its favor in case number 19SMCV02002.  
 
On October 1, 2024, the Court, finding Plaintiff failed to demonstrate
the probable validity of his real property claim, granted Holly Hill’s motion
to expunge the recorded Lis Pendens.  
 
On December 26, 2024, Plaintiff attempted to file an Amended
Complaint, which was rejected by the Court. 
As such, the original Complaint is still the operative complaint.
 
Holly Hill now demurs to the entire Complaint for failure to state
facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action on the grounds that the
doctrine of res judicata bars all of Plaintiff’s claims.  Holly Hill also specifically demurs to the
Complaint as follows:
 
1.    
The first cause of action for Fraud in the Factum (1st
COA) fails to state a cause of action pursuant to CCP § 430.10(e). 
 
2.    
The second cause of action for Conversion (2nd COA)
fails to state a cause of action pursuant to CCP § 430.10(e). 
 
3.    
The third cause of action for Quiet Title (3rd COA)
fails to state a cause of action pursuant to CCP § 430.10(e). 
 
4.    
The third [sic] cause of action for Conspiracy (3rd COA
[sic]); Fraud (4th COA) fails to state a cause of action pursuant to CCP §
430.10(e). 
 
5.    
The fifth cause of action for Cancellation of
Instruments (5th COA) fails to state a cause of action pursuant to CCP §
430.10(e). 
 
6.    
The sixth cause of action for Aiding and Abetting (6th
COA) fails to state a cause of action pursuant to CCP § 430.10(e). 
 
7.    
The seventh cause of action for Intentional Infliction
of Emotional Distress (“IIED”) (7th COA) fails to state a cause of action
pursuant to CCP § 430.10(e). 
 
8.    
The eighth cause of action for Slander of Title (8th
COA) fails to state a cause of action pursuant to CCP § 430.10(e). 
 
9.    
The tenth cause of action for Unjust Enrichment (10th
COA) fails to state a cause of action pursuant to CCP § 430.10(e). 
 
10.  The
eleventh cause of action for Violation of B&P § 17200 (“UCL”) (11th COA)
fails to state a cause of action pursuant to CCP § 430.10(e). 
 
11.  The
twelfth of action for The Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organization Act
(“RICO”) conspiracy (12th COA) fails to state a cause of action pursuant to CCP
§ 430.10(e). 
 
12.  The
thirteenth cause of action for Malicious Prosecution (13th COA) fails to state
a cause of action pursuant to CCP § 430.10(e).
 
13.  The
fourteenth cause of action for Injunctive Relief (14th COA) fails to state a
cause of action pursuant to CCP § 430.10(e)
 
Holly Hill also filed an anti-SLAPP motion to strike the Eighth Cause
of Action for Slander of Title and the Thirteenth Cause of Action for Malicious
Prosecution.
 
Defendant Jefferey Russell (“Russell”) separately demurs to the entire
operative Complaint on the grounds of res judicata and specifically demurs
to the Third Cause of Action for Conspiracy, the Sixth Cause of Action for
Aiding and Abetting, the Seventh Cause of Action for Intentional Infliction of
Emotional Distress, the Twelfth Cause of Action for RICO conspiracy, and the
Thirteenth Cause of Action for Malicious Prosecution for failure to state facts
sufficient to constitute a cause of action pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 430.10, subdivision (e).  
 
Plaintiff opposes all motions, and Defendants Holly Hill and Russell
reply.
 
REQUESTS
FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
 
Defendants’ Requests for Judicial Notice
 
Holly Hill requests judicial notice of the following in connection
with both its demurrer and its special motion to strike:
 
·      
Exhibit 1: the Grant Deed recorded as document
number 951580856 in the Official Records of Los Angeles County
 
·      
Exhibit 2: the Deed of Trust recorded as
document number 060553694 in the Official Records of Los Angeles County
 
·      
Exhibit 3: the Notice of Default and Election to
Sell Under Deed of Trust recorded as document number 20110477316 in the
Official Records of Los Angeles County
 
·      
Exhibit 4: the Notice of Trustee’s Sale recorded
as document number 20120891440 in the Official Records of Los Angeles County
 
·      
Exhibit 5: the Corporation Assignment of Deed of
Trust recorded as document number 20121142056 in the Official Records of Los
Angeles County
 
·      
Exhibit 6: the Trustee’s Deed Upon Sale recorded
as document number 20121142057 in the Official Records of Los Angeles County
 
·      
Exhibit 7: the Grant Deed recorded as document
number 20171172713 in the Official Records of Los Angeles County
 
·      
Exhibit 8: the Complaint filed by Plaintiff in
this action
 
·      
Exhibit 9: the Notice of Pending Action (Lis
Pendens) recorded as document number 20230867122 in the Official Records of Los
Angeles County
 
·      
Exhibit 10: the Notice of Entry of Judgment
filed in Case No. 19SMCV02002.
 
            In connection with his demurrer,
Russell also requests judicial notice of the Entry of Judgment filed in Case
No. 19SMCV02002.  For ease of reference,
the Court uses Holly Hill’s exhibit numbering, and refers to the judgment ss
Exhibit 10 or RJN 10.
 
With regard to Exhibits 1-7 and 9, courts can take judicial notice of the existence and recordation of real
property records, including deeds, if authenticity is not reasonably
disputed.  (Fontenot v. Wells Fargo
Bank, N.A. (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 256, 264-265.)  “The official act of recordation and the
common use of a notary public in the execution of such documents assure their
reliability, and the maintenance of the documents in the recorder’s office
makes their existence and text capable of ready confirmation, thereby placing
such documents beyond reasonable dispute.” 
(Ibid.)  Moreover, courts
can take judicial notice not only of the existence and recordation of recorded
documents but also matters that can be deduced from the documents, including
the parties, dates, and legal consequences of recorded documents relating to
real estate transactions.  (Ibid.)  
 
Therefore, the Court takes
judicial notice of Exhibits 1-7 and 9.
 
Regarding Exhibits 8 and 10, Judicial
notice may be taken of records of any court in this state.  (Evid. Code, § 452, subd. (d)(1).)  Because the Complaint is part of the Court’s
record for this case and the notice of entry of judgment is a court record from
case no. 19SMCV02002, the Court may take judicial notice of them.  (Ibid.)   However, “while courts are free to take
judicial notice of the existence of each document in a court file, including
the truth of results reached, they may not take judicial notice of the truth of
hearsay statements in decisions and court files.  Courts may not take judicial notice of
allegations in affidavits, declarations and probation reports in court records
because such matters are reasonably subject to dispute and therefore require
formal proof.”  (Lockley v. Law Office
of Cantrell, Green, Pekich, Cruz & McCort (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 875,
882 [cleaned up].)  
 
Accordingly, the Court takes
judicial notice of the existence of the Complaint filed in this matter and the
truth of the results reached in the notice of entry of judgment as court records,
but not the truth of hearsay statements or allegations contained therein.  
 
Plaintiff’s Request for
Judicial Notice
 
In opposition to the demurrers
of Holly Hill and Russell, Plaintiff requests take judicial notice of the
following:
 
1.     “the proven-to-be-void trustee’s deed
upon sale on 7/23/2012 by Bank of America’s ReconTrust in the Official Records
of Los Angeles County, a true and correct copy of which is attached as Exhibit
57, and which proves loan was assigned to the alleged credit bid beneficiary
after the foreclosure”
 
2.     “the
dismissal of U.S. Bank, N.A.’s unlawful detainer action, a true and correct
copy of which is attached as Exhibit 60.”
 
3.     “the
offers of proof demonstrating that U.S. Bank, N.A. thereafter sold its void
deed to Bank of America over 5 years before it sold a deed again to Investments
on 10/5/2017, true and correct copies of which are attached as Exhibits 47A-8;
47A12.”
 
4.     “the Decl. of ReconTrust supervisor
Sevillano regarding the backdated assignment to LaSalle Bank, backdated to
before the merger of LaSalle with Bank of America, a true and correct copy of
which is attached as Exhibit 90.”
 
5.     “the Marshall Decls. showing that the
ReconTrust trustee’s sale was on paper only, and was not cried at the location
ReconTrust gave for the auction, true and correct copies of which are attached
as Exhibits 76(1)(2)(3).”
 
6.     “the preliminary injunction which was
in effect at the time of the ReconTrust unsupervised nonjudicial sale and
recording of U.S. Bank onto record title, a true and correct copy of which is
attached as Exhibit 49.”
 
7.     “LAPD recordings of false 911 calls,
true and correct copies of which are attached as Exhibits 160; 154; 185; 225.”
 
The first exhibit, notated as
“exhibit 57” contains two separate documents – a “Corporation Assignment of
Deed of Trust” Recorded as document number 20121142056, and dated August 1,
2012 and a “Trustee’s Deed Upon Sale” recorded as document number 20121142057,
and dated June 2, 2012.  Both documents
contain extraneous markings that do not appear to be part of the originals
(such as “EXH. 72005 was 25” and “EXH. 57 004 was 10[.]”)  Because Plaintiff has attached two separate
documents, both of which appear on their face to have been altered from the
originals, the Court denies Plaintiff’s request for judicial notice.
 
The second exhibit appears to
be a request for dismissal granted by the Clerk of the Court on April 3,
2013.  However, the copy is so poor, the
Court cannot clearly discern who the Plaintiff/Petitioner is, who the
Defendant/Respondent is, or the case number. 
As such, the Court cannot take judicial notice of this exhibit.
 
The third exhibit appears to
be a settlement agreement among Bank of America, Countrywide Home Loans, Inc.
and Financial Corporation; Zuni Investors, LLC; Och-Ziff Capital Management
Group, LLC; and Joel I. Sher, in his capacity as Chapter 11 Trustee for various
entities bearing the name “TMST” signed only by Mr. Sher.  The top of each page of the document is
stamped with “Case 09-17787 Doc 1783-1 Filed 02/26/13 Page [#] of 18”
suggesting the document may have been filed in a case somewhere.  
 
However, Plaintiff does not
specify which court this case was filed in, and even if Plaintiff had specified
the court, while the Court can take judicial notice of the existence and filing
of court records, as well as the legal consequences thereof, the Court cannot
take judicial notice of the truth of hearsay statements contained in court
documents.  Therefore, the Court denies
judicial notice of the third exhibit. 
 
The fourth exhibit – a
declaration of Tina Sevillano – does not bear any stamps or other caption page
markings indicating that it was actually filed or is otherwise part of any
court file.  But even if it were part of
a court file, the Court cannot take judicial notice of the truth of hearsay
statements contained in a declaration just because it was part of a court file.
 
Although the fifth exhibit – a
declaration of John Marshal – appears to have been filed in Los Angeles
Superior Court case number SC128569, the Court cannot take judicial notice of
the truth of hearsay statements contained in a declaration.  As such, the Court declines to take judicial
notice of the Declarations of Tina Sevillano and John Marshal.
 
The sixth exhibit is not, as
Plaintiff contends, a preliminary injunction. 
Rather, the sixth exhibit is an unpublished opinion by the Court of
Appeal for the Second Appellate District, Division Five, regarding an appeal
Plaintiff filed in case number SC108012. 
Therefore, the Court declines to take judicial notice of the sixth
exhibit as requested.
 
The seventh exhibit is
purportedly “LAPD recordings of false 911 calls[.]”  However, Plaintiff has not submitted any such
recordings to the Court, and as such, the Court cannot take judicial notice of
them.  Furthermore, Plaintiff purports to
request judicial notice, pursuant to subdivision (d) of Evidence Code section
452, which pertains to court records.  Also
Plaintiff has not indicated the court case in which these calls were
submitted.  Moreover, even if Plaintiff
had established that these are court records, the Court cannot take judicial
notice of the truth of hearsay statements made in court records, particularly
in light of Plaintiff’s characterization of the calls as “false.”  
 
Therefore, the Court denies Plaintiff’s request for judicial notice in
its entirety.
 
ANALYSIS
 
1.     DEMURRER
 
“It is black letter law that a demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of
the allegations in a complaint.”  (Lewis v. Safeway, Inc. (2015)
235 Cal.App.4th 385, 388.)  In testing the sufficiency of a cause of
action, a court accepts “[a]s true all material facts properly pled and matters
which may be judicially noticed but disregard contentions, deductions or
conclusions of fact or law.  [A court
also gives] the complaint a reasonable interpretation, reading it as a whole
and its parts in their context.”  (290
Division (EAT), LLC v. City & County of San Francisco (2022) 86
Cal.App.5th 439, 450 [cleaned up]; Hacker v. Homeward Residential, Inc.
(2018) 26 Cal.App.5th 270, 280 [“in considering the merits of a demurrer,
however, “the facts alleged in the pleading are deemed to be true, however
improbable they may be”].)
 
Further, in ruling on a demurrer, a court must “liberally construe”
the allegations of the complaint “with a view to substantial justice between
the parties.”  (See Code Civ. Proc., §
452.)  “This rule of liberal construction
means that the reviewing court draws inferences favorable to the plaintiff, not
the defendant.”  (Perez v. Golden Empire Transit Dist. (2012) 209
Cal.App.4th 1228, 1238.)   
 
In summary, “[d]etermining whether the complaint is sufficient as
against the demurrer on the ground that it does not state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action, the rule is that if on consideration of all the
facts stated it appears the plaintiff is entitled to any relief at the hands of
the court against the defendants the complaint will be held good although the
facts may not be clearly stated, or may be intermingled with a statement of
other facts irrelevant to the cause of action shown, or although the plaintiff
may demand relief to which he is not entitled under the facts alleged.”  (Gressley v. Williams (1961) 193
Cal.App.2d 636, 639.)
 
A.   
FAILURE TO STATE A CAUSE OF ACTION
 
                                                        
i.         
Entire
Complaint – Res Judicata 
“Res judicata describes the preclusive effect
of a final judgment on the merits. Res judicata, or claim preclusion, prevents
relitigation of the same cause of action in a second suit between the same
parties or parties in privity with them.” 
(Consumer Advocacy Group, Inc. v. ExxonMobil Corp. (2008) 168
Cal.App.4th 675, 683 [cleaned up].)  “A
prior judgment is not res judicata on a subsequent action unless three elements
are satisfied: 1) the issues decided in the prior adjudication are identical
with those presented in the later action; 2) there was a final judgment on the
merits in the prior action; and 3) the party against whom the plea is raised
was a party or was in privity with a party to the prior adjudication. Even if
these threshold requirements are established, res judicata will not be applied
‘if injustice would result or if the public interest requires that relitigation
not be foreclosed.”  (Id. at pp.
685–686 [cleaned up].)
 
Further, “Res judicata
precludes piecemeal litigation by splitting a single cause of action or
relitigation of the same cause of action on a different legal theory or for
different relief.  . . . California's res judicata doctrine is based upon
the primary right theory. The primary right theory is a theory of code pleading
that has long been followed in California. It provides that a cause of action
is comprised of a primary right of the plaintiff, a corresponding primary duty
of the defendant, and a wrongful act by the defendant constituting a breach of
that duty.  The most salient characteristic of a primary right is that it
is indivisible: the violation of a single primary right gives rise to but a
single cause of action. As far as its content is concerned, the primary right
is simply the plaintiff's right to be free from the particular injury suffered.
. . . The primary right theory has a fairly narrow field of application. It is
invoked most often when a plaintiff attempts to divide a primary right and enforce
it in two suits. The theory prevents this result by either of two means: (1) if
the first suit is still pending when the second is filed, the defendant in the
second suit may plead that fact in abatement or (2) if the first suit has
terminated in a judgment on the merits adverse to the plaintiff, the defendant
in the second suit may set up that judgment as a bar under the principles of
res judicata.”  (Lincoln Property Co., N.C., Inc. v. Travelers Indem.
Co. (2006) 137 Cal.App.4th 905, 912, internal citations and quotations
omitted.)  
 
Here, Plaintiff acquired title to the subject property via Grant Deed
in 1995.  (RJN Ex. 1.)  In 2006, Plaintiff took out a loan from
Countrywide Home Loans, secured by a deed of trust against the property.  (RJN Ex. 2.) 
In 2011, a Notice of Default and Election to Sell Under Deed of Trust
was filed against the property.  (RJN Ex.
3.)  On June 15, 2012, a Notice of
Trustee’s Sale was recorded against the property.  (RJN Ex. 4.) 
U.S. Bank purchased the property at public auction on July 23,
2012.  (RJN Ex. 6.)  On October 5, 2017, U.S. Bank sold the
property to Defendant.  (RJN Ex. 7.)
 
Further, on December 11, 2023, judgment was entered quieting title to
the subject property in Holly Hills’ favor in case number 19SMCV02002.  (RJN Ex. 10.) 
In so holding, the court specifically found that Plaintiff’s claims that
the 2012 foreclosure was “wrongful” to be barred by the doctrine of res
judicata, as this issue was already raised and litigated to completion in case
numbers SC128569 and SC118787, where Plaintiff asserted affirmative defenses
that Recontrust wrongfully foreclosed on the Property (RJN Ex. 10 at pp. 10-12)
as Plaintiff alleges again herein (see Complaint at pp. 6:25-7:8).
 
In connection with this Court’s ruling on Holly Hill’s motion to
expunge the Lis Pendens, this Court noted that “The Judgment entered in case
number 19SMCV02002 was entered following an evidentiary hearing and provides a
detailed finding of fact and analysis.”
 
Plaintiff’s complaint alleges that the doctrine of res judicata does
not bar his claims because “none of the above issues were addressed on the
merits.”  The Court disagrees.  The issue of whether Reconstrust wrongfully
foreclosed on Plaintiff’s real property was already fully, completely, and
repeatedly litigated on the merits.  
 
As such, the doctrine of res judicata bars Plaintiff’s claims now,
which all stem from allegations that the foreclosure was wrongful.
 
2.     SPECIAL
MOTION TO STRIKE
 
“A cause of action
arising from a person's act in furtherance of the ‘right of petition or free
speech under the United States Constitution or the California Constitution in
connection with a public issue shall be subject to a special motion to
strike[….]’”  (Monster Energy Co. v.
Schechter (2019) 7 Cal.5th 781, 788 (hereafter Monster).)  Such lawsuits are commonly known as “SLAPP”
suits (Strategic Litigation Against Public Participation).  (Id. at fn. 1.)
 
Background
 
The California
Legislature enacted Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16, known as the
“anti-SLAPP statute” to “allow[] defendants to seek early dismissal of
unmeritorious claims arising from protected speech and petitioning activities.”  (Bonni v. St. Joseph Health System
(2021) 11 Cal.5th 995, 1004 (hereafter Bonni.)  “Enacted by the Legislature in 1992, the
anti-SLAPP statute is designed to protect defendants from meritless lawsuits
that might chill the exercise of their rights to speak and petition on matters
of public concern.”  (Wilson v. Cable
News Network, Inc. (2019) 7 Cal.5th 871, 883–884 (hereafter Wilson).)  The anti-SLAPP statute is also designed to
expedite the early dismissal of unmeritorious claims arising from protected
activity.  (Newport Harbor Ventures,
LLC v. Morris Cerullo World Evangelism (2018) 4 Cal.5th 637, 642; Simpson
Strong-Tie Co., Inc. v. Gore (2010) 49 Cal.4th 12, 21.)  “The anti-SLAPP statute does not insulate
defendants from any liability for claims arising from the protected
rights of petition or speech. It only provides a procedure for weeding out, at
an early stage, meritless claims arising from protected activity.”  (Baral v. Schnitt (2016) 1 Cal.5th
376, 384, emphasis in original (hereafter Baral).)  But anti-SLAPP motions are not permitted in
limited civil cases. (1550 Laurel Owner’s Assn., Inc. v. Appellate Division
of Superior Court (2018) 28 Cal.App.5th 1146, 1149.)
 
“SLAPPs are
unsubstantiated lawsuits based on claims arising from a defendant's
constitutionally protected speech or petitioning activity.”  (Kurz v. Syrus Systems, LLC (2013) 221
Cal.App.4th 748, 757 (hereafter Kurz).) 
They “seek[] to chill rights to free speech or petition by dragging the
speaker or petitioner through the litigation process, without genuine
expectation of success in the suit.”  (Area
51 Productions, Inc. v. City of Alameda (2018) 20 Cal.App.5th 581, 591–592
(hereafter Area 51 Productions.) 
They are “generally brought to obtain an economic advantage over the
defendant, not to vindicate a legally cognizable right of the plaintiff.”  (Grenier v. Taylor (2015) 234
Cal.App.4th 471, 479.)  
 
“The Legislature enacted
section 425.16 to provide a summary disposition procedure for SLAPP
claims.”  (Area 51 Productions, supra,
20 Cal.App.5th at p. 592.)  The
statute “authorizes courts, upon motion by anyone who claims to be the target
of a SLAPP suit, to probe the basis for any cause of action allegedly arising
from protected communicative activities, and to strike it if the claimant
cannot show minimal merit.”  (Ibid.)  A special motion to strike may only be
directed to a complaint, cross-complaint, or petition, but not to an answer or
affirmative defenses.  (Morris Cerullo
World Evangelism v. Newport Harbor Offices & Marina, LLC (2021) 67
Cal.App.5th 1149, 1156-1157.)
 
Procedure
 
To determine whether an
anti-SLAPP motion should be granted, courts engage in a two-step process and
evaluate the merits of the claim(s) using a “summary-judgment-like
procedure.”  (Baral, supra, 1
Cal.5th at p. 384.)  “The procedures
authorized in the statute allow a defendant to stay discovery before litigation
costs mount, obtain early dismissal of the lawsuit, and recover attorney fees.”  (Kurz, supra, 221 Cal.App.4th
at p. 757.)  A special motion to strike
“is not a substitute for a motion for a demurrer or summary judgment.”  (Belen v. Ryan Seacrest
Productions, LLC (2021) 65 Cal.App.5th 1145, 1161.)  And there is no meet and confer requirement
prior to filing an anti-SLAPP motion.  (Trinity
Risk Management, LLC v. Simplified Labor Staffing Solutions, Inc. (2021) 59
Cal.App.5th 995, 1008.)  
 
First Step
 
In the first step, the
moving defendant has the initial burden of showing that the challenged cause of
action arises from protected free speech or petitioning activity.  (Bonni, supra, 11 Cal.5th at p.
1009; Park v. Board of Trustees of California State University (2017) 2
Cal.5th 1057, 1061 (hereafter Park).) 
“The defendant's first-step burden is to identify the activity each
challenged claim rests on and demonstrate that that activity is protected by
the anti-SLAPP statute.”  (Wilson,
supra, 7 Cal.5th at p. 884.)  When
the defendant has not met this burden, the court may summarily deny the special
motion to strike “without putting the plaintiff to the burden of establishing
the probability of success on the merits.” 
(Whitehall v. County of San Bernardino (2017) 17 Cal.App.5th 352,
360 (hereafter Whitehall).)
 
“[I]n ruling on an
anti-SLAPP motion, courts should consider the elements of the challenged claim
and what actions by the defendant supply those elements and consequently form
the basis for liability.”  (Park, supra,
2 Cal.5th at p. 1063.)  It is not enough
that a claim was filed after or even “because of” protected activity, but
rather the protected activity must “supply elements of the challenged claim.”  (Id. at p. 1064.)  Moreover, courts “must distinguish between
speech or petitioning activity that is mere evidence related to liability, and
liability that is based on speech or petitioning activity.”  (Whitehall, supra, 17
Cal.App.5th at p. 361.)
 
Moreover, the anti-SLAPP
statute does not require a defendant “to disprove allegations of illicit
motive.”  (Wilson, supra, 7
Cal.5th at p. 887.)  Courts must
distinguish between “allegations of conduct on which liability is based” and
“allegations of motives for such conduct” because “the anti-SLAPP statute is
triggered only when the alleged injury-producing conduct is protected activity,
not merely the motivating conduct for that activity.”  (Gaynor v. Bulen (2018) 19 Cal.App.5th
864, 887 (hereafter Gaynor).) 
However, a defendant’s motives are not “categorically off-limits in
determining whether an act qualifies as protected activity under the anti-SLAPP
statute” but “the plaintiff's allegations cannot be dispositive of the
question.”  (Wilson, supra,
7 Cal.5th at p. 889.)  “[W]hether the
defendant's act qualifies as one in furtherance of protected speech or
petitioning will depend on whether the defendant took the action for
speech-related reasons.”  (Ibid.)  “But there is an important difference between
permitting the defendant to present evidence of its own motives in an effort to
make out its prima facie case of protected activity and treating a plaintiff's
allegations of illicit motive as a bar to anti-SLAPP protection,” which is not
proper.  (Ibid.)  
 
Second Step
 
Once the court finds the
defendant has made the threshold showing, the “the burden then shifts to the
plaintiff to show a probability of prevailing on [the] claims.”  (De Havilland v. FX Networks, LLC
(2018) 21 Cal.App.5th 845, 854.)  To meet
this burden, “the plaintiff must demonstrate that the complaint is both legally
sufficient and supported by a sufficient prima facie showing of facts to
sustain a favorable judgment if the evidence submitted by the plaintiff is
credited.”  (Finton Construction, Inc.
v. Bidna & Keys, APLC (2015) 238 Cal.App.4th 200, 211.)  “[T]he plaintiff must then demonstrate its
claims have at least ‘minimal merit.’ ” 
(Park, supra, 2 Cal.5th at p. 1061.)  “[A] plaintiff seeking to demonstrate the
merit of the claim ‘may not rely solely on its complaint, even if verified;
instead, its proof must be made upon competent admissible evidence.’”  (Monster, supra, 7 Cal.5th at
p. 788.)  “[A] court must at the second
step accept as true the evidence favorable to the plaintiff” but is not
required to give “similar credence” to allegations in the complaint “in the
face of contrary evidence.”  (Wilson,
supra, 7 Cal.5th at p. 887.)  
 
This procedure is
essentially a summary judgment motion in reverse.  (Area 55, LLC v. Nicholas & Tomasevic,
LLP (2021) 61 Cal.App.5th 136, 152.) 
“Rather than requiring the defendant to defeat the plaintiff's
pleading by showing it is legally or factually meritless, the motion requires
the plaintiff to demonstrate that he possesses a legally sufficient
claim which is ‘substantiated,’ that is, supported by competent, admissible
evidence.”  (Ibid.)  “Consistent with this summary-judgment-like
procedure, the court “must draw all reasonable inferences from the evidence in
favor of [the party opposing the anti-SLAPP motion.’”  (Ibid.)  “Only a [cause of action] that satisfies both
prongs of the anti-SLAPP statute—i.e., that arises from protected speech
or petitioning and lacks even minimal merit—is a SLAPP suit, subject to
being stricken under the statute.”  (Sheley
v. Harrop (2017) 9 Cal.App.5th 1147, 1162.) 

 
Here, because the Court sustains Defendants’ demurrers to the entire
Complaint on the grounds of res judicata, the Court denies Holly Hill’s special
motion to strike the Eighth Cause of Action for Slander of Title and the
Thirteenth Cause of Action for Malicious Prosecution as moot.  The Court similarly declines to award Holly
Hill’s request for attorneys’ fees.
 
3.    
LEAVE TO AMEND
 
A plaintiff has the burden of showing in what
manner the complaint could be amended and how the amendment would change the
legal effect of the complaint, i.e., state a cause of action. (See The
Inland Oversight Committee v. City of San Bernardino (2018) 27 Cal.App.5th
771, 779; PGA West Residential Assn., Inc. v. Hulven Int'l, Inc. (2017)
14 Cal.App.5th 156, 189.) A plaintiff must not only state the legal basis for
the amendment, but also the factual allegations sufficient to state a cause of
action or claim. (See PGA West Residential Assn., Inc. v. Hulven Int'l, Inc.,
supra, 14 Cal.App.5th at p. 189.) Moreover, a plaintiff does not meet his
or her burden by merely stating in the opposition to a demurrer or motion to
strike that “if the Court finds the operative complaint deficient, plaintiff
respectfully requests leave to amend.” (See Major Clients Agency v Diemer
(1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 1116, 1133; Graham v. Bank of America (2014) 226
Cal.App.4th 594, 618 [asserting an abstract right to amend does not satisfy the
burden].)
 
Here, Plaintiff points to the (rejected) First Amended Complaint
filed on December 26, 2024. 
Specifically, Plaintiff asserts that the argument that U.S. Bank and
Bank of America’s actions for possession were time barred.  But as discussed above, the foreclosure of
Plaintiff’s property and the legitimacy thereof, was already fully litigated on
the merits, in numerous prior lawsuits.  
 
Therefore, Plaintiff has not met his burden to present the Court
with any facts that could cure this deficiency. 
As such, the Court denies Plaintiff leave to amend the Complaint.  
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
For the reasons stated, because Plaintiff already litigated the
legitimacy of the foreclosure of his home and whether Holly Hill is the current
rightful owner of the property on the merits, the Court sustains both Holly
Hill’s and Russell’s demurrers to the entire complaint without leave to amend
on the grounds that the Complaint is barred. 

 
Because the Court sustains the demurrers to the entire Complaint
without leave to amend, the Court denies as moot Holly Hill’s special motion to
strike (anti-SLAPP) and accompanying request for attorneys’ fees.  
 
Holly Hill shall provide notice of the Court’s orders and file the
notice with a proof of service forthwith.
