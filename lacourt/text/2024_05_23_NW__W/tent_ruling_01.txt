DISCUSSION
 
I.                   
PLAINTIFF’S MOTION
FOR TERMINATING SANCTIONS OR IN THE ALTERNATIVE, FOR EVIDENTIARY SANCTIONS,
ISSUE SANCTIONS, TO COMPEL COMPLIANCE WITH THE COURT’S ORDER AND/OR TO COMPEL
FURTHER RESPONSES AS TO FORM INTERROGATORIES SETS ONE AND TWO PROPOUNDED
AGAINST DEFENDANT ANZA MANAGEMENT COMPANY 
 
Plaintiffs Clauda Calderon and Carlos Araujo
move this court for an order against Defendant Anza Management Company for
terminating sanctions, or alternatively, evidentiary sanctions and issue
sanctions to compel compliance with the court’s discovery order of December 8,
2023 and/or to compel further responses as to Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatories,
Set One and Set Two, based on Defendant’s ongoing willful failure and/or
refusal to comply in good faith with its discovery obligations. 
 
Where a party fails to obey an order
compelling answers to discovery, “the court may make those orders that are
just, including the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a
terminating sanction.”  (CCP §§ 2030.290(c), 2023.010(c); R.S.
Creative, Inc. v. Creative Cotton, Ltd. (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 486, 495.) 
The Court may impose a terminating sanction against anyone engaging in
conduct that is a misuse of the discovery process.  (CCP §
2023.030(d).)  Misuse of the discovery process includes failure to respond
to an authorized method of discovery or disobeying a court order to provide
discovery.  (CCP § 2023.010(d), (g).)  A terminating sanction may be
imposed by an order dismissing part or all of the action.  (CCP §
2023.030(d)(3).)   
 
The court should consider the totality
of the circumstances, including conduct of the party to determine if the
actions were willful, the determent to the propounding party, and the number of
formal and informal attempts to obtain discovery.  (Lang v. Hochman
(2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246.)  If a lesser sanction fails to curb
abuse, a greater sanction is warranted.  (Van Sickle v. Gilbert
(2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 1495, 1516.) However, “the unsuccessful imposition
of a lesser sanction is not an absolute prerequisite to the utilization of the
ultimate sanction.” (Deyo v. Killbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771,
787.) Terminating sanctions should not be ordered lightly, but are
justified where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and
there is evidence that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the
discovery rules.  (Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174
Cal.App.4th 967, 992.) 
 
Before any sanctions may be imposed the
court must make an express finding that there has been a willful failure of the
party to serve the required answers.  (Fairfield v. Superior Court for
Los Angeles County (1966) 246 Cal.App.2d 113, 118.)  Lack of diligence
may be deemed willful where the party understood its obligation, had the
ability to comply, and failed to comply.  (Deyo, supra, 84
Cal.App.3d at p. 787; Fred Howland Co. v. Superior Court of Los Angeles
County (1966) 244 Cal.App.2d 605, 610-611.)  The party who failed to
comply with discovery obligations has the burden of showing that the failure
was not willful.  (Deyo, supra, 84 Cal.App.3d at p. 788; Cornwall
v. Santa Monica Dairy Co. (1977) 66 Cal.App.3d 250; Evid. Code, §§ 500,
605.) 
 
Plaintiff seeks for terminating
sanctions or, alternatively, evidentiary sanctions and/or issue sanctions
precluding Defendant from employing certain affirmative defenses since
Defendant has refused to provide code-compliant discovery responses relating to
FROG involving said affirmative defenses as the court ordered it to do in its
December 8, 2023 Order. Notwithstanding whether the court decides to assess
terminating, issue, and/or evidentiary sanctions, Plaintiffs request an award
of monetary sanctions in the amount of $7,935.00 against Defendant and its
attorneys of record, Ronald S. Whitaker, Esq. (current counsel) and Amie
Jacoby, Esq. (former counsel during many of these proceedings), and whatever
law firm or company they may belong, jointly and severally, to compensate them
for the expenses incurred in bringing the subject Motion. 
 
Defendant Anza filed no opposition to
this motion.  Defendant failed to serve responses to discovery as ordered
by this court.  In light of Defendant’s failure to respond to discovery
and failure to comply with the court order, the court finds that Defendant
understood their obligations to answer discovery, had the ability to comply,
and willfully failed to comply. Given that the earlier monetary sanctions had
no effect on Defendant’s willingness to respond to discovery, the court finds
that lesser sanctions will not curb the abuse. 
 
Accordingly, the motion for terminating
sanctions is GRANTED.  The court strikes
Defendant Anza’s answers and enters default against Defendants. Plaintiffs may
file a default judgment packet to request entry of default judgment against
Defendants. As the court is granting terminating sanctions it declines to also
impose monetary sanctions. 
 
II.                 
PLAINTIFF’S MOTION
FOR TERMINATING SANCTIONS OR, IN THE ALTERNATIVE, FOR EVIDENTIARY SANCTIONS,
ISSUE SANCTIONS TO COMPEL COMPLIANCE WITH THE COURT’S ORDER AND/OR TO COMPEL
FURTHER RESPONSES AS TO FORM INTERROGATORIES SETS ONE AND TWO AGAINST DEFENDANT
