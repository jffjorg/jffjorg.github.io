DISCUSSION
 
I.                   
CROSS-COMPLAINANT’S MOTION FOR FURTHER
RESPONSES TO REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION (SET TW0) 
 
Cross Complainant Snyder moves this court
for further responses to Request for Production (Set 2), Requests Nos. 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 9, 12, 13, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20, 23 and 24, arguing that Fed Reporter’s
responses are insufficient for a host of reasons, and that responding party
interposes improper objections.   The
court notes at the outset that Snyder’s motion is procedurally deficient in
that he failed to include in the original Separate Statement the supplemental
responses served by Fed Reporter on December 15, 2023.  Nonetheless, having received and reviewed
further briefing filed by both sides and a complete Separate Statement filed by
Fed Reporter, the court addresses the merits below.  
 
The court finds the following requests
overbroad and burdensome for the reasons set forth in Fed Reporter’s Responses
to discovery and memorandum of points and authorities: Requests Nos. 1, 2, 3,
4, 12, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20, 23 and 24. 
 
The court finds that the supplemental
responses provided by Fed Reporter are adequate as to requests Nos. 5, 6, and
9.  The court finds that Request No. 13
is unintelligible as written.  
 
Accordingly, the motion to compel
further responses to Request for Production (Set 2) is denied.  No further responses are required.  
 
I.          CROSS-COMPLAINANT’S
MOTION FOR FURTHER RESPONSES TO SPECIAL INTERROGATORIES (SET TW0) 
 
Cross Complainant Snyder moves this
court for further responses to Special Interrogatories Nos. 34, 35, 36, 41,
5455, 66, 67 and 69, arguing that Fed Reporter’s responses are insufficient for
a host of reasons, and that responding party interposes improper
objections.   
 
The court finds the following  interrogatories to be compound and therefore
improper under the Code of Civil Procedure: 34, 41, 66, and 67.  
 
The court finds that the supplemental
responses provided by Fed Reporter are adequate as to Interrogatories 35, 36,
54. 
 
The court finds the following
interrogatories to be vague, ambiguous, and improper as framed: 55 and 69.  For example, some require Fed Reporter to
obtain and produce statements from witnesses or employees.  
 
Accordingly, the motion to compel
further responses to Special Interrogatories (Set 2) is denied.  No further responses are required.
