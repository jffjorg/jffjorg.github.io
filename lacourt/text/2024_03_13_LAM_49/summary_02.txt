And here is a summary in English text:

This tentative ruling addresses a demurrer to a complaint and a motion to strike in a breach of habitability case. The plaintiff alleges that the property they rent has insect infestations, visible mold and mildew, leaking walls, and defective plumbing, and that the defendants have failed to remedy these defects. The defendants demur to the first and second causes of action, alleging that the lease agreement does not include the defendant FPI Management, Inc. as a party, and that the plaintiff has failed to plead facts to support an award of punitive damages. The court sustains the demurrer to the first and second causes of action and overrules the demurrer to the third and fourth causes of action. The court also denies the motion to strike in part and grants it in part, allowing the plaintiff to amend their complaint. The court requires the plaintiff to provide facts to support an award of punitive damages, attorney's fees, and statutory damages.
