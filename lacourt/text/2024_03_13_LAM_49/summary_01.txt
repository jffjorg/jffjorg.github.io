Significant Statements:

- "The party asserting the FAA bears the burden to show it applies by presenting evidence establishing [that] the contract with the arbitration provision has a substantial relationship to interstate commerce ..."
- "The court must determine whether these terms should be severed, or whether instead the arbitration agreement as a whole should be invalidated."
- "The presence of multiple unconscionable clauses is merely one factor in the trial court's inquiry; it is not dispositive."
- "Severance of the unconscionable provisions will therefore have minimal impact on the parties' rights or the Agreement as a whole."

Summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants Defendant's Motion to Compel Arbitration and orders the case to be stayed pending the results of the arbitration. The court finds that the Arbitration Agreement is enforceable and that the dispute should be resolved through arbitration. The court also finds that the confidentiality provision and the carve-out provision in the agreement are unconscionable, but severs those provisions and enforces the agreement as modified. The court orders the parties to arbitrate the dispute according to the modified agreement.
