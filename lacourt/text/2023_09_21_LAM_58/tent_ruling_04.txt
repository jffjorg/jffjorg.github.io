 
This action arose from a dispute regarding real property located
at 1130 Rosalind Avenue, Los Angeles, CA 90023 (Property). On May 24, 2018, Plaintiffs
Rudy Montalvo and Guadalupe Montalvo (Plaintiffs) filed a Complaint alleging
they were the true fee simple title owners of the Property and had been dispossessed
through the fraudulent actions of Defendants. 
 
On September 19, 2018, Plaintiffs filed a First Amended
Complaint (FAC) against Defendants Osbaldo Martinez, OG Global Investments,
Inc., Anna Marroquin, Gilbert Slazar, Jr., JCP, LP, ALJ Realty, Inc., and all
persons unknown, claiming any legal or equitable right, title, estate, lien or
interest in the property described in the Complaint, adverse to Plaintiffs' title.
The FAC – Plaintiffs’ operative pleading – contains causes of action for (1.)
fraud, (2.) financial elder abuse, (3.) conversion, (4.) common counts, (5.) declaratory
relief, (6.) breach of fiduciary duty, and (7.) quiet title. 
 
On November 7, 2018, Defendants OG Global Investments, Inc.
and Osbaldo Martinez filed separate answers to Plaintiff’s First Amended
Complaint. 
 
On December 31, 2019, Cross-Complainants JCP, LP And AIG
Realty, Inc. filed a Third Amended Cross-Complaint. Defendants OG Global
Investments, Inc. and Osbaldo Martinez were named as Cross-Defendants. 
 
On February 26, 2019, Plaintiffs Rudy Montalvo and Guadalupe
Montalvo entered into a written Settlement Agreement with Defendant OG Global Investments,
Inc. in the amount of $125,000. 
 
On April 22, 2022, Cross-Complainants JCP, LP, and AJG Realty,
Inc. sought entry of default against Defendants/Cross-Defendants OG Global Investments, Inc. and Osbaldo Martinez. On
February 27, 2023, the Court entered Default Judgment against Cross-Defendants
OG Global Investments, Inc. and
Osbaldo Martinez on the Third Amended Cross-Complaint. 
 
On July 1, 2022, Plaintiffs and Defendant Osbaldo Martinez
entered into an oral settlement agreement in the amount of $50,000.  
 
 
Plaintiffs now move to enforce the two settlement agreements
against Defendant OG Global Investments, Inc. and Defendant Osbaldo Martinez. Plaintiffs
contend that Defendants failed to make any of the required payments under their
respective settlement agreements. No opposition was filed. 
 
The motion is granted. 
 
Legal Standard
 
The Court is authorized to enter judgment pursuant to the
stipulated settlement. (Code Civ. Proc. § 664.6.) In reviewing a motion to
enforce a settlement, the Court determines “whether the parties entered into a
valid and binding settlement.” (Hines v.
Lukes (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 1174, 1182.) “A settlement is enforceable
under section 664.6 only if the parties agreed to all material settlement
terms. [Citations.] The court ruling on the motion may consider the parties’
declarations and other evidence in deciding what terms the parties agreed to,
and the court’s factual findings in this regard are reviewed under the
substantial evidence standard. 
[Citations.] If the court determines that the parties entered into an enforceable
settlement, it should grant the motion and enter a formal judgment pursuant to
the terms of the settlement.”  (Id. at pp. 1182-1183; see also Osumi v. Sutton (2007) 151 Cal.App.4th
1355, 1357 [“Strong public policy in favor of the settlement of civil cases
gives the trial court, which approves the settlement, the power to enforce
it”].)
 
Strict compliance with
the statutory requirements is necessary before a court can enforce a settlement
agreement under section 664.6. (Sully-Miller Contracting Co. v.
Gledson/Cashman Construction, Inc. (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 30, 37.) The
party seeking to enforce a settlement “must first establish the agreement at
issue was set forth ‘in a writing signed by the parties’ (§ 664.6) or was made
orally before the court.  [Citation.]” (Harris v. Rudin, Richman
& Appel (1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 299, 304.)
 
Discussion
 
            Plaintiffs seek to enforce their settlement agreements
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6.      
 
On February 26, 2019, Plaintiffs entered into a written
Settlement Agreement with Defendant OG Global Investments, Inc. in the amount
of $125,000, which was to be paid on or before March 15, 2019. (McIntosh Decl.,
¶ 3, Ex. 1.) The written settlement was executed by the President of Defendant OG
Global Investments. (Id.)
 
Subsequently, on July 1, 2022, Plaintiffs and Defendant
Osbaldo Martinez reached a settlement agreement in the amount of $50,000, which
was to be paid on or before January 1, 2023. (McIntosh Decl., ¶ 4, Ex. 2.) The
parties stipulated to this settlement agreement orally, in the presence of the Court.
(Id.)
 
On this motion, Plaintiffs now contend Defendants breached
their respective settlement agreements because no payments have been made by
either Defendant on either settlement agreement. (McIntosh Decl., ¶¶ 3-4.)
 
            The facts of this motion are straightforward; the existence
and breach of the settlement agreements are not contested as there is no
opposition. 
 
            Additionally, while the motion does not address whether
the Court properly retained jurisdiction over these parties, retained jurisdiction under
Section 664.6 is not at issue. Specifically, court records do not indicate that
Defendants OG Global Investments, Inc. and Osbaldo Martinez have been dismissed
with respect to Plaintiff’s FAC.[1]
Thus, the Court did not lose subject matter jurisdiction over these Defendants.
(See e.g., Basinger v. Rogers & Wells
(1990) 220 Cal.App.3d 16, 23 [“[Plaintiffs] could have filed their motion under
section 664.6 ... before their dismissals were filed. Having waited to bring
their motion until after their actions were dismissed, [Plaintiffs] must now
contend with the policies favoring finality of judgments and termination of
litigation” pursuant to section 473.]; Viejo Bancorp, Inc. v. Wood
(1989) 217 Cal.App.3d 200, 206 [“Because the old action was no longer pending
at the time the court sought to enter the judgment reviewed here, the court was
without subject matter jurisdiction.”].)
 
Plaintiffs’ motion to
enforce the settlement agreements complies with all the requirements of Code of
Civil Procedure section 664.6.
 
Conclusion

 
            The Motion to Enforce the Settlement Agreements pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6 is granted. Within 15 days of service
of the notice of ruling, Plaintiffs shall prepare, serve and lodge a single, proposed
Judgment consistent with the Court's orders herein.
