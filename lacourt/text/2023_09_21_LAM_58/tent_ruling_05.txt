[1]           Plaintiffs’ written settlement
agreement with Defendant OG
Global Investments, Inc. provides that Plaintiffs would file a
dismissal of their claims with prejudice as to Defendant OG Global Investments,
Inc. “with the Court within 7 days of the payment of money.” (McIntosh Decl., ¶ 3, Ex. 1.) There is no record
that any dismissal was filed, which is consistent with Plaintiffs’ position
that no payments were made. Additionally, in Court’s Order After Hearing (entered
on December 9, 2022), which contains the terms of Plaintiffs’ settlement
agreement with Defendant Osbaldo
Martinez,
the parties did not provide for the dismissal of Defendant Osbaldo Martinez.
