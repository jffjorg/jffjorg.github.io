And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Shane Perel-Wertman vs. Liza Perel. Plaintiff Perel-Wertman had moved to compel defendant Perel to respond to his demands for production, inspection, and copying of documents. However, after the motion was filed, defendant Perel served responses to the demands, making the motion moot. Additionally, plaintiff Perel-Wertman had sought $1,257.26 in monetary sanctions against defendant Perel, claiming that defendant Perel had delayed in responding to the demands. However, the court found that defendant Perel's former counsel had mistakenly missed the email serving the demands, and that defendant Perel had only learned about the demands when plaintiff's counsel served the motion on her. Under these circumstances, the court exercised its discretion not to sanction defendant Perel. As a result, plaintiff Perel-Wertman's motion to compel response to demands is denied as moot.
