And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the motions filed by defendants Lockheed Martin Corporation and Mark Marino. The defendants move to reopen discovery to depose two witnesses, Luke Giangrande and Adrian Martinez, who submitted declarations in support of the plaintiff's opposition to defendants' motions for summary judgment. The court finds good cause to reopen discovery, as the defendants show substantial necessity and diligence in seeking to depose these witnesses, and their depositions are necessary to prevent prejudice to the defendants.

The defendants also move to compel compliance with the court's order compelling the depositions of the plaintiff and Elvira Guzman. The court grants this motion in part, ordering the plaintiff and Elvira Guzman to appear and testify at deposition on December 17, 2024. The court declines to impose sanctions on the plaintiff, finding that both sides have contributed to the discovery disputes and delays.
