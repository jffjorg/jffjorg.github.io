And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on two motions: one by the receiver, Aaron J. Kudla, seeking approval of interim fees and expenses, and another by defendants/cross-complainants Rajesh and Chetan Jogani seeking an order to issue shares in Akshi Investments. The judge grants the receiver's motion, approving interim fees and expenses of $448,700.76 and $169,668.50, respectively. The judge also notes that the receiver's decision to hire his wife, Anna Kudla, as part of his staff raises concerns about the appearance of impropriety. However, the judge finds that the work billed by Anna Kudla was reasonable and necessary.

The judge denies the Jogani brothers' motion for an order requiring issuance of shares in Akshi Investments. The judge rules that the motion is a mandatory injunction that is automatically stayed pending appeal, and that Code of Civil Procedure section 917.2 does not apply. The judge also notes that the judgment sought by the Jogani brothers is similar to one considered in the case of Baar v. Smith, in which the California Supreme Court held that a mandatory injunction is automatically stayed pending appeal.
