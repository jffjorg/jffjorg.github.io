The judge has denied plaintiff Victor Enright's motion for reconsideration of the court's order compelling further discovery responses and imposing monetary sanctions on October 23, 2024. The plaintiff's motion is untimely and does not show adequate grounds for reconsideration. The judge found that the plaintiff disobeyed discovery orders by serving incomplete and unverified responses, and that the plaintiff failed to act diligently in presenting new facts or law. The plaintiff's arguments on the merits of the discovery motions are without merit, and the judge has previously rejected similar arguments. The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for reconsideration.
