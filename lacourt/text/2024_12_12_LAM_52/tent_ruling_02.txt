 Case Number:  21STCV27825    Hearing Date:   December 12, 2024    Dept:  52 Plaintiff Victor
Enright’s Motion for Reconsideration
            Plaintiff Victor Enright moves for
reconsideration of the court’s order compelling further discovery responses and
imposing monetary sanctions on October 23, 2024.  In that order, the court found plaintiff
disobeyed discovery orders issued on July 31, 2024.  The court therefore partially granted defendants
Steven Loeb and Rosen and Loeb’s motion for discovery sanctions.  
            Plaintiff’s motion for
reconsideration is untimely.  A motion
for reconsideration must be made “within 10 days after service upon the party
of written notice of entry of the order.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1008, subd. (a).) 
Plaintiff’s motion acknowledges that deadline was November 4.  (Motion, p. 28.)  Plaintiff electronically filed this motion at
5:14 p.m. on November 6, 2024.  Defendants
Steven Loeb and Rosen and Loeb present evidence plaintiff served only an
incomplete motion on November 4 before re-serving and filing the completed
motion on November 6.  (Goldman Decl., ¶¶
6-9, Ex. 3.)
            Plaintiff also does not show adequate
grounds for reconsideration.  The moving party must show diligence and
explain why he or she could not have presented the new or different facts or
law earlier.  (California Correctional Peace Officers Assn. v. Virga (2010) 181
Cal.App.4th 30, 46; Baldwin v. Home Sav.
of America (1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 1192, 1200.)           Plaintiff relies on four purported new facts or
circumstances.  
First, plaintiff argues he did not disobey the July
31, 2024, order because he timely served responses on September 3, not
September 6 as stated in the order. 
(Motion, pp. 6-7.)  But plaintiff
acknowledges he served unverified responses on September 3, then served
verifications on September 6.  Doing so
did not comply with the court’s order because “[u]nsworn responses are
tantamount to no responses at all.”  (Appleton v. Superior Court (1988)
206 Cal.App.3d 632, 636; see also Allen-Pacific, Ltd. v. Superior Court (1997)
57 Cal.App.4th 1546, 1550.)  Plaintiff
also disobeyed the order by making objections, which the court ruled he had
waived. 
Second, plaintiff contends defendants’ counsel
agreed to permit plaintiff to object based on attorney-client privilege.  Plaintiff relies on an email sent by attorney
Diane Goldman in April 2023.  (Richie
Decl., Ex. E, p. 4.)  Assuming defendant’s
counsel still agreed to permit such objections when moving to compel discovery
responses in June 2024, plaintiff did not act diligently in presenting that
2023 email to the court.  He knew about
the email over a year before defendants moved to compel discovery
responses.  Plaintiff shows no reason he
could not have presented it when opposing the motions to compel discovery or
opposing the subsequent motion for discovery sanctions.
            Third,
 plaintiff contends he did not file
motions for relief from waiver of his objections due to illness of attorney
Tory Pankopf.  But plaintiff’s counsel,
DRE, APC, has several other attorneys. 
Defendants’ counsel states she has “dealt with no less than 6 attorneys
who have either worked on and/or supervised Plaintiff’s case.”  (Goldman Decl., ¶ 10.)  One attorney’s illness does not justify
plaintiff’s lack of diligence.   
Fourth, plaintiff makes arguments on the merits of
the discovery motions that were granted on July 31, 2024.  None of plaintiff’s arguments have
merit.  Even if plaintiff’s arguments
would otherwise be successful, plaintiff does not show he could not have made
the arguments earlier.  Plaintiff already
made some of these arguments earlier.  Plaintiff’s
motion notes, “As cited in Plaintiff’s opposition, the following
questions seek discovery on the Cross Complaint.”  (Motion, p. 9, italics added.)  The court rejected that argument at least
once before.

Enright’s motion for reconsideration is denied.
