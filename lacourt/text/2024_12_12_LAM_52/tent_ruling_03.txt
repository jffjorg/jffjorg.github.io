 Case Number:  21STCV44242    Hearing Date:   December 12, 2024    Dept:  52 Plaintiff Shane Perel-Wertman’s
Motion to Compel Response to First Set of Demands for Production 
Plaintiff Shane Perel-Wertman moves to compel defendant Liza
Perel to respond to his demands for production, inspection, and copying of
documents, set one.  After plaintiff
served and filed this motion, defendant served responses to the demands.  (Perel Decl., ¶ 8, Ex. 3.)  The motion is therefore moot as to compelling
responses.
Plaintiff also moved for $1,257.26 in monetary
sanctions against defendant.  “The court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act
in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even though no
opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was withdrawn,
or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after the motion
was filed.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1348(a).)
The court finds defendant acted with substantial
justification and sanctions would not be just under the circumstances.  Defendant’s former counsel, David B.
Felsenthal, submitted a declaration stating he mistakenly missed plaintiff’s
email serving the demands for production and did not forward them to
defendant.  (Felsenthal Decl., ¶¶ 2,
6.)  Defendant states she first learned
about the document demands when plaintiff’s counsel served this motion on
her.  (Perel Decl., ¶ 6.)  Under these circumstances, the court will
exercise its discretion not to sanction defendant.
Disposition
Plaintiff Shane Perel-Wertman’s motion to compel response to
demands for production is denied as moot.
