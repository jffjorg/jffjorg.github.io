 Case Number:  24STCV18308    Hearing Date:   December 12, 2024    Dept:  52 Defendant Sports Rehab LA’s Motion to
Compel Arbitration and Stay Case
Defendant Sports Rehab LA moves to
compel arbitration of this action by plaintiffs Shaun Baden and M Sport,
LLC.  
The
court will continue this hearing. 
Plaintiffs filed this action against 12 defendants.  Plaintiffs filed proof of service of summons
on four of the 12 defendants after Sports Rehab LA filed this motion.  The time for all 12 defendants to respond to
the complaint has elapsed.  Only Sports
Rehab LA has responded.  Plaintiffs have
not requested entry of default against any of the other 11 defendants.  Sports Rehab LA served the moving papers only
on plaintiff’s counsel.    
  Furthermore, the court’s file does not
include Sports Rehab LA’s reply brief.  Plaintiffs
opposed this motion and filed a surreply brief in response to Sports Rehab LA’s
reply brief.  The court will therefore
continue this hearing to permit Sports Rehab LA to serve the papers on all
parties and to file the reply brief.  
The
court hereby continues the hearing on defendant Sports Rehab LA’s motion
to compel arbitration from this date to January 13, 2025, at 9:00 a.m.
