However, the Judge found that the Defendant did not meet its burden to show that the case is incorrectly classified. The Judge noted that the Plaintiff incurred $7,173.31 in medical bills and alleged emotional injuries and prayed for punitive damages. The Judge also found that the Defendant did not produce evidence of additional medical expenses or show that the Plaintiff's recovery would be limited to the medical bills in light of the prayer for punitive damages and allegations of emotional injuries.
