English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling denies plaintiff Onyi Ko's motion to compel further responses to defendant Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC's requests for production of documents. The court finds that defendant's responses are code-compliant, and defendant claims to be unaware of documents in its possession, custody, or control. The court orders defendant to produce a privilege log within 20 days. The case is bifurcated for both discovery and trial, with phase one focusing on the Song-Beverly Act claim and phase two addressing the civil penalty under Civil Code §1794(c) for a willful violation of the statute.
