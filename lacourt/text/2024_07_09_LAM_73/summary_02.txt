And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for terminating and monetary sanctions against the defendant, FCA US, LLC. The defendant failed to provide discovery responses and repeatedly disobeyed court orders, leading the judge to conclude that the defendant engaged in a pattern of intentional and deliberate discovery abuse. As a result, the judge granted terminating sanctions, striking the defendant's answer and entering default against the defendant. The judge also awarded monetary sanctions of $6,743.31 to the plaintiff, which is the amount of attorney's fees incurred by the plaintiff in bringing the instant motion.
