TENTATIVE RULING
 
Plaintiff’s Motion for Sanctions against
Defendant is GRANTED as follows:

I. BACKGROUND
 
On December
15, 2022, Plaintiff Jamie Miller filed this action against Defendant FCA US,
LLC. Plaintiff’s Complaint asserts causes of action for: (1) Song-Beverly
Consumer Warranty Act; (2) Unfair Competition; and (3) Unjust Enrichment. 
 
The Complaint
alleges the following. On or about April 1, 2017, Plaintiff purchased a 2014
Ram 1500 truck (“Vehicle”), which was manufactured by Defendant. At a later
date, Plaintiff wanted to trade-in the Vehicle and learned, for the first time,
the Vehicle’s title was branded a lemon. At the time of Plaintiff’s purchase of
the Vehicle from Dealer, there was no “Lemon Law Buyback” decal affixed by the
manufacturer Defendant to the left front doorframe of the Vehicle, as required
under Civil Code section 1793.23(c) and Vehicle Code section 11713.12(a).
 
On May 10,
2024, Plaintiff filed this Motion for Terminating and Monetary Sanctions, or in
the alternative, issue sanctions against Defendant, due to:
·      
Defendant’s ongoing willful misuse of
the discovery process and ongoing willful violation of the Court’s Orders
·      
Defendant violated the Court’s November 13, 2023 and April 3, 2024 Orders granting
Plaintiff’s Motions to Compel Further Discovery Responses and sanctions and the
Court’s March 22, 2024 Order granting Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Attendance
of James Sheridan at Deposition and to Produce Documents.
·      
Plaintiff requests terminating sanctions in the form of a Court
Order striking FCA US, LLC’s answer and rendering judgment against FCA US, LLC
in the amount pled of $401,033.34 and an Order of $8,393.31 in further monetary
sanctions.
·      
If the Court is unwilling to grant terminating sanctions,
Plaintiff requests an issue sanction in the form of a Court Order conclusively
establishing that at the time of Plaintiff's purchase the subject vehicle was
sold as a Certified Pre-Owned vehicle with no notification to Plaintiff that it
was a prior lemon buyback. Plaintiff also requests the Court order that the
matters in requests for admission 4, 7, 24, 33 and 35 be deemed admitted and
requests the Court order further monetary sanctions in the amount of $8,393.31
against FCA US, LLC equal to Plaintiff’s reasonable expenses.
Defendant did not file an opposition.
Plaintiff filed a reply asserting the Court should take Defendant’s failure to
oppose as implied consent.
II. ANALYSIS
 
A.     Legal
Standard 
A misuse of the discovery process is failing to respond or to
submit to an authorized method of discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010,
subd. (d).)  A misuse of the discovery process also includes disobeying a
court order to provide discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (g).) A
court may impose issue sanctions, evidence sanctions, or monetary sanctions
against a party engaging in misuse of the discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc. §
2023.030.) Where an issue sanction is imposed, “designated facts shall be taken
as established in the action in accordance with the claim of the party
adversely affected by the misuse of the discovery process.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2023.030, subd. (b).) An issue sanction may also involve “any party engaging in
misuse of the discovery process from supporting or opposing designated claims
or defenses.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (b).) An evidence sanction
involves “an order prohibiting any party engaging in the misuse of the
discovery process from introducing designated matters in evidence.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (c).)  
A terminating sanction may be imposed by the court by one of the
following orders: (1) an order striking out the pleadings or parts of the
pleadings of any party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process; (2) an
order staying further proceedings by that party until an order for discovery is
obeyed; (3) an order dismissing the action, or any part of the action, of that
party; or (4) an order rending judgment by default against that party. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (d)(1)-(4).)  
“The discovery statutes evince an incremental approach to
discovery sanctions, starting with monetary sanctions and ending with the
ultimate sanction of termination.” (Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009)
174 Cal.App.4th 967, 992.)  “Discovery sanctions should be appropriate to
the dereliction, and should not exceed that which is required to protect the
interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery.” (Ibid.)
“[C]ontinuing misuses of the discovery process warrant incrementally harsher
sanctions until the sanction is reached that will curb the abuse.”  (Ibid.)
Where discovery violations are “willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and
the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with
discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate
sanction.” (Ibid.)  A trial court has broad discretion to impose
discovery sanctions, but two facts are generally a prerequisite to the
imposition of nonmonetary sanctions. (Biles v. Exxon Mobil Corp. (2004)
124 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1327.) Where discovery sanctions are requested against a
party, there must be a failure to comply with a court order and the failure
must be willful. (Ibid.)   
“A decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made
lightly.” (Creed-21 v. City of Wildomar (2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 690, 702.)
A trial court’s order to impose terminating sanctions will be reversed only if
it “was arbitrary, capricious, or whimsical.” (Ibid.) Trial courts have
properly imposed terminating sanctions when parties have willfully disobeyed
one or more discovery orders. (Los Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014)
223 Cal.App.4th 377, 390.) Terminating sanctions are warranted when a party’s
lack of compliance with the discovery process has caused the opposing party
prejudice. (Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc., supra, 174
Cal.App.4th 967, 989.) 
B.     Terminating Sanctions
 
Plaintiff requests terminating sanctions in the form of a Court
Order striking FCA US, LLC’s answer and rendering judgment against FCA US, LLC
in the amount pled of $401,033.34 and an Order of $8,393.31 in further monetary
sanctions. In the alternative, Plaintiff requests an issue sanction in the form
of a Court Order conclusively establishing that at the time of Plaintiff's
purchase the subject vehicle was sold as a Certified Pre-Owned vehicle with no
notification to Plaintiff that it was a prior lemon buyback. Plaintiff also
requests the Court order that the matters in requests for admission 4, 7, 24,
33 and 35 be deemed admitted.
Plaintiff asserts that Defendant
violated the Court’s November 13, 2023 and April 3, 2024 Orders granting
Plaintiff’s Motions to Compel Further Discovery Responses and sanctions and the
Court’s March 22, 2024 Order granting Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Attendance
of James Sheridan at Deposition and to Produce Documents. As the Court stated
in its April 3, 2024 Order, Defendant’s repeated failure to provide responses “is
intentional and deliberate discovery abuse by Defendant FCA, as well as
material violations of this court’s November 13 order.” (Court’s 04/03/24
Minute Order, p. 2.) The Court further granted monetary sanctions “given the
prolonged, repeated, and, at this point, willful and deliberate refusals to
engage in discovery by Defendant FCA and violations of the November 13 order.”
(Court’s 04/03/24 Minute Order, p. 3.)
The
Court finds that imposition of terminating sanctions is warranted. As the court stated in Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem
(2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 262, 279, “A decision to order terminating sanctions
should not be made lightly. But where a violation is willful, preceded by a
history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not
produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in
imposing the ultimate sanction.” The court may
issue terminating or evidentiary sanctions against a party who misuses the
discovery process, which includes failing to respond
or submit to an authorized method of discovery; making an evasive discovery
response, and disobeying a court order to provide discovery. (CCP §
2023.010(d), (f), (g).) 
 
Here, the record indicates that there has been a pattern of
Defendant repeatedly failing
to respond to Plaintiff’s discovery requests and repeatedly disobeying the
Court’s orders. The discovery requests in
question were initially served in July 2023. The Court granted Plaintiff’s
motions to compel further discovery responses and request for monetary
sanctions. However, as of today, Defendant has not submitted code-compliant
discovery responses. Defendant had nearly a year to submit initial code-compliant
responses, and both Plaintiff’s counsel and the Court have afforded Defendant
ample opportunities to comply. No opposition to the current motion for
terminating sanctions has been filed. Defendant has disobeyed the Court’s
orders to provide responses and Defendant has failed to pay the Court ordered
monetary sanctions to Plaintiff. It appears that lesser sanctions would likely
not prevent further discovery abuse. Thus, there is sufficient cause for
terminating sanctions.  
 
Accordingly, terminating sanctions are GRANTED. Because the Court
has granted terminating sanctions, the request for issue sanctions is MOOT.  
 
C.     Monetary
Sanctions
 
Plaintiff also
seeks monetary sanctions against Defendant for bringing the instant motion. 
 
California Code of Civil Procedure,
Section 2023.030 provides that “[t]he court may impose a monetary sanction
ordering that one engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any
attorney advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses, including
attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.” A court has
discretion to fix the amount of reasonable monetary sanctions. (Cornerstone
Realty Advisors, LLC v. Summit Healthcare Reit, Inc. (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th
771, 791.) 
 
Counsel’s declaration in support of the instant
motion sets forth counsel’s hourly rate and the time spent on the instant
motions. Counsel attests that Plaintiff will and has incurred attorney’s fees
and costs totaling $8,393.31 in bringing the instant motion. 
 
The Court finds sanctions warranted, but not to
the full extent requested. A court has discretion to award sanctions that are “suitable
and necessary to enable the party seeking discovery to obtain the objects of
the discovery he seeks” but they should not be punitive in nature or levied for
the purposes of punishing an offending party. (Vallbona v. Springer
(1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 1525, 1545.) Since no opposition was filed, the Court
does not grant the 3 hours counsel anticipated it would spend on reviewing the
opposition and preparing the reply brief. Therefore, the Court reduces the
requested monetary sanctions by $1,650. 
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff
is awarded $6,743.31 collectively as attorney’s fees. Sanctions are imposed against Defendant.
Defendant is ordered to pay sanctions to Plaintiff, by and through counsel of
record, in the total amount of $6,743.31, within thirty (30) days. 
 

 II. DISPOSITION
 
Plaintiff’s Motion for Sanctions against Defendant is GRANTED as
follows: 
(1)
GRANTED as to terminating sanctions; 
(2)
MOOT as to issue sanctions; and 
(3)
GRANTED as to monetary sanctions in the amount of $6,743.31. 
 
 The
Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s request for terminating sanctions and strikes
Defendant’s Answer and enters default against Defendant. Plaintiff may file a
default judgment packet to request entry of default judgment against
Defendant.  
 
Defendant
is ordered to pay sanctions to Plaintiff, by and through counsel of record, in
the total amount of $6,743.31, within thirty (30) days.
