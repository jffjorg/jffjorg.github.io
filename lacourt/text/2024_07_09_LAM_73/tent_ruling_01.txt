DEFENDANTS’ motion for TERMINATING
SANCTIONS, OR IN THE ALTERNATIVE, ISSUE AND/OR EVIDENTIARY SANCTIONS; REQUEST
FOR MONETARY SANCTIONS (filed on 02/06/24)
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
Defendant’s Motion for Sanctions against Plaintiff
is GRANTED in part as follows: 
(1) DENIED as
to terminating, issue and evidentiary sanctions; and 
(2) GRANTED
as to monetary sanctions in the amount of $4,340, to be paid within 30 days. 
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
On July 27,
2022, Plaintiff Robert Lee filed this action against Defendants William Kim and
Lorna Kim. Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint asserts causes of action for:
(1) Libel and (2) Slander.
 
The Complaint
alleges that beginning in late April 2021, Defendants Lorna Kim and her husband
William Kim began a defamatory campaign accusing Lorna’s uncle, Plaintiff, of
molesting Lorna as a child. The Complaint further alleges Defendants published
these defamatory statements by speaking and sending text messages to family
members and building tenants. 
 
On February 6,
2024, Defendant Lorna Kim filed this Motion for Terminating Sanctions, or in
the alternative, Issue and/or Evidentiary Sanctions, and request for Monetary
Sanctions, against Plaintiff, arguing:
·      
Plaintiff failed to obey this Court’s January 26, 2024 order compelling the deposition of
Plaintiff. On February 6, 2024, Plaintiff failed to appear for his
court-ordered deposition.
·      
Defendant has been hindered in preparing a defense to Plaintiff’s
claims as Plaintiff has now failed to appear for deposition for over two months
since it was first timely noticed.
·      
This Court should grant terminating sanctions, dismissing
Plaintiff’s complaint with prejudice.
·      
In the alternative, Defendant requests that the Court impose issue
sanctions precluding Plaintiff from testifying at trial and asserting any
claims that Defendant was liable for any incident claimed in this lawsuit, or
that Plaintiff suffered any damages whatsoever as a result of said incident(s).
Alternatively, Defendant requests that the Court impose evidentiary sanctions
precluding Plaintiff from introducing any evidence in support of his
allegations that Defendant is liable for any incident or that Plaintiff
suffered any damages.
·      
In addition to terminating, issue and evidence sanctions, the
Court may impose monetary sanctions for a party’s misuse of the discovery
process. Defendant requests monetary sanctions in the amount of $3,865.00.
 
Plaintiff filed an opposition, arguing:
·      
Plaintiff requests leave of court to excuse this late filing on the grounds that he was diverted into
and absorbed by trial readiness for the voluminous companion case of Jong Soo
Park v. Ben Hang Lee, 22STCV03583; FSC, June 24, 2024; jury trial, July 8,
2024; Hon. Holly J. Fujie, LASC Dept. 56. Fortunately, the court a few days ago
continued the trial date.
·      
The Court rulings of January 26, 2024, February 7 & 8, 2024,
and June 5, 2024 acknowledged that “meet & confer” was needed but was
absent. At a minimum Moving Party could have moved the Court for an Informal
Discovery Conference, where “meet & confer” would take place.
Defendant filed a reply, arguing:
·      
Plaintiff’s opposition was untimely and received by Defense counsel on July 1, 2024, the day the Reply was
due. The Opposition is untimely and should be disregarded. Plaintiff has not
presented this Court with any valid excuse.
·      
Only two things are absolutely required to grant terminating
sanctions; a failure to comply, and that the failure was willful. (See R.S.
Creative, Inc. v. Creative Cotton, Ltd. (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 486, 496.)
Both are clearly met here.
·      
Additional monetary sanctions are warranted. Plaintiff failed to
appear for his deposition yet again on February 20, 2024, after this motion was
filed. (Kerr Decl., ¶ 3.) Defendant incurred another Court Reporter fee in the
amount of $475.00, and respectfully requests this amount be added to any
sanctions awarded, bringing the total request to $4,340.00 against Plaintiff
and his attorney of record
II. ANALYSIS
 
A.     Legal
Standard 
A misuse of the discovery process is failing to respond or to
submit to an authorized method of discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010,
subd. (d).)  A misuse of the discovery process also includes disobeying a
court order to provide discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (g).) A
court may impose issue sanctions, evidence sanctions, or monetary sanctions
against a party engaging in misuse of the discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc. §
2023.030.) Where an issue sanction is imposed, “designated facts shall be taken
as established in the action in accordance with the claim of the party
adversely affected by the misuse of the discovery process.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2023.030, subd. (b).) An issue sanction may also involve “any party engaging in
misuse of the discovery process from supporting or opposing designated claims
or defenses.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (b).) An evidence sanction
involves “an order prohibiting any party engaging in the misuse of the
discovery process from introducing designated matters in evidence.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (c).)  
A terminating sanction may be imposed by the court by one of the
following orders: (1) an order striking out the pleadings or parts of the
pleadings of any party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process; (2) an
order staying further proceedings by that party until an order for discovery is
obeyed; (3) an order dismissing the action, or any part of the action, of that
party; or (4) an order rending judgment by default against that party. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (d)(1)-(4).)  
“The discovery statutes evince an incremental approach to
discovery sanctions, starting with monetary sanctions and ending with the
ultimate sanction of termination.” (Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009)
174 Cal.App.4th 967, 992.)  “Discovery sanctions should be appropriate to
the dereliction, and should not exceed that which is required to protect the
interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery.” (Ibid.) “[C]continuing
misuses of the discovery process warrant incrementally harsher sanctions until
the sanction is reached that will curb the abuse.”  (Ibid.) Where
discovery violations are “willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the
evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with
discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate
sanction.” (Ibid.)  A trial court has broad discretion to impose
discovery sanctions, but two facts are generally a prerequisite to the imposition
of nonmonetary sanctions. (Biles v. Exxon Mobil Corp. (2004) 124
Cal.App.4th 1315, 1327.) Where discovery sanctions are requested against a
party, there must be a failure to comply with a court order and the failure
must be willful. (Ibid.)   
“A decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made
lightly.” (Creed-21 v. City of Wildomar (2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 690, 702.)
A trial court’s order to impose terminating sanctions will be reversed only if
it “was arbitrary, capricious, or whimsical.” (Ibid.) Trial courts have
properly imposed terminating sanctions when parties have willfully disobeyed
one or more discovery orders. (Los Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014)
223 Cal.App.4th 377, 390.) Terminating sanctions are warranted when a party’s
lack of compliance with the discovery process has caused the opposing party
prejudice. (Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc., supra, 174
Cal.App.4th 967, 989.) 
B.     Request for
Judicial Notice
 
Plaintiff
requests the Court take judicial notice of the following:
1.     January 26,
2024, ruling of the court in Los Angeles Superior Court case Robert Lee v.
Lorna Kim, 22STCV12924;
2.     Plaintiff’s
Opposition to Second Further Declaration of Christopher G. Kerr in Los Angeles
Superior Court case Robert Lee v. Lorna Kim, 22STCV12924;
3.     Plaintiff
Robert Lee’s February 6, 2024, Points and Authorities in Support of Ex Parte
Application to Enforce Court Order on Depositions in Los Angeles Superior Court
case Robert Lee v. Lorna Kim, 22STCV12924;
4.     Plaintiff
Robert Lee’s February 7, 2024, Plaintiff’s Opposition to Defendant Lorna Kim’s
Ex Parte Application in Los Angeles Superior Court case Robert Lee v. Lorna
Kim, 22STCV12924;
5.     February 6,
2024, Defendant Lorna Kim’s Notice of Motion and Motion for Terminating
Sanctions, in Los Angeles Superior Court case Robert Lee v. Lorna Kim,
22STCV12924;
6.     February 7,
2024, ruling of the court in Los Angeles Superior Court case Robert Lee v.
Lorna Kim, 22STCV12924;
7.     February 8,
2024, ruling of the court in Los Angeles Superior Court case Robert Lee v.
Lorna Kim, 22STCV12924;
8.     June 5, 2024,
ruling of the court in Los Angeles Superior Court case Robert Lee v. Lorna Kim,
22STCV12924.
 
The court may
take judicial notice of “official acts of the legislative, executive, and
judicial departments of the United States and of any state of the United
States,” “[r]ecords of (1) any court of this state or (2) any court of record
of the United States or of any state of the United States,” and “[f]acts and
propositions that are not reasonably subject to dispute and are capable of
immediate and accurate determination by resort to sources of reasonably
indisputable accuracy.” (Evid. Code § 452, subds. (c), (d), and (h).) The Court
may take judicial notice of its own file. (See Stepan v. Garcia (1974) 43 Cal.App.3d 497, 500.)
 
The Court
grants Plaintiff’s requests for judicial notice.
 
C.     Timeliness of
Plaintiff’s Opposition
 
As an initial
matter, the Court notes that Plaintiff failed to timely file his opposition. 
 
Opposition papers are required to be filed and
served at least nine court days prior to the hearing under California Code
of Civil Procedure (“CCP”) section 1005, subdivision (b). 
 
Here,
Plaintiff’s opposition was filed on June 28, 2024 and received by Defendant on
July 1, 2024, the same day Plaintiff’s reply was due. Plaintiff asserts his
opposition was filed late because he was “diverted into and absorbed by trial
readiness” in another case. (Oppos., pp. 1-2.) The Court does not find Plaintiff’s
excuse warranted the late filing. However, a court may properly consider papers
that are not timely filed pursuant to CCP section 1005(b) unless “substantial
rights” are affected.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1300(d); Code Civ.
Proc., § 475.) Since Defendant was able to respond to Plaintiff’s opposition in
her Reply, the Court, in its discretion, considers the arguments raised in
Plaintiff’s late filed opposition.
 
D.     Discussion
 
Defendant
moves for terminating sanctions against Plaintiff and seeks an order dismissing the case, or alternatively, Defendant seeks issue
sanctions precluding Plaintiff from testifying at trial and asserting any
claims that Defendant was liable for any incident claimed in this lawsuit, or
that Plaintiff suffered any damages whatsoever as a result of said incident(s),
or evidentiary sanctions precluding Plaintiff from introducing any evidence in
support of his allegations that Defendant is liable for any incident or that
Plaintiff suffered any damages.
 
On January 26,
2024, this Court granted Defendant’s Motion to Compel the deposition of
Plaintiff. (Kerr Decl. ¶ 3, Exhibit 1.) Defendant then noticed the
Court-ordered deposition of Plaintiff for February 6, 2024. (Kerr Decl. ¶ 4.) However,
Plaintiff failed to appear for his deposition on February 6, 2024 and February
20, 2024. (Kerr Decl. ¶ 13, Suppl. Kerr Decl., ¶ 3.)
 
The
Court does not grant terminating sanctions at this time. As the court stated in Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem
(2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 262, 279, “A decision to order terminating sanctions
should not be made lightly. But where a violation is willful, preceded by a
history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not
produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in
imposing the ultimate sanction.” The Discovery Act envisions an incremental
approach to sanctions, and monetary, issue and evidentiary sanctions have not
yet been imposed against Defendant. As stated in Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc., supra, 174 Cal.App.4th 967, 992, discovery
statutes evince an incremental approach to discovery sanctions, starting with
monetary sanctions and ending with the ultimate sanction of termination.
Further, this is Plaintiff’s first failure to comply with an order
for the production of evidence and Defendant has not shown that lesser
sanctions would not prevent further discovery abuse.
 
Therefore at this time, the Court grants Defendant’s request for monetary
sanctions against Plaintiff. 
 
California Code of Civil Procedure,
Section 2023.030 provides that “[t]he court may impose a monetary sanction
ordering that one engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any
attorney advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses, including
attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.” A court has
discretion to fix the amount of reasonable monetary sanctions. (Cornerstone
Realty Advisors, LLC v. Summit Healthcare Reit, Inc. (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th
771, 791.) 
 
Counsel’s declaration in support of the instant
motion sets forth counsel’s costs and fees, including counsel’s time spent on
the motion at the hourly rate of $300 and costs incurred such as the Court
Reporter fees. Counsel attests that Plaintiff will and has incurred attorney’s
fees and costs totaling $4,340. Due to Plaintiff’s failure to appear for his
court-ordered depositions, the Court grants monetary sanctions against
Plaintiff in the amount of $4,340.
 
Accordingly,
sanctions are imposed against Plaintiff and his attorney of record. Plaintiff is
ordered to pay sanctions to Defendant, by and through counsel of record, in the
total amount of $4,340, within thirty (30) days. 
 

 II. DISPOSITION
 
Defendant’s Motion for Sanctions against Plaintiff is GRANTED in part as
follows: 
(1)
DENIED as to terminating, issue and evidentiary sanctions; and 
(2)
GRANTED as to monetary sanctions in the amount of $4,340, to be
paid within 30 days.
