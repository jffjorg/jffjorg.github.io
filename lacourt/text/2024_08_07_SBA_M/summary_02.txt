The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Credit Card Services, Inc. v. Heung Tae Oh, et al. The court has overruled Credit Card Services, Inc.'s demurrer to the Second Amended Cross-Complaint, finding that the cross-complainants have stated facts sufficient to support their claims for intentional interference with prospective economic advantage and negligent interference with prospective economic relations. The court has also granted Credit Card Services, Inc.'s motion to strike certain allegations from the Second Amended Cross-Complaint, including a claim for punitive damages, due to the lack of specific facts to support the claim. The cross-complainants have been given 20 days to amend their pleading to cure the deficiencies.
