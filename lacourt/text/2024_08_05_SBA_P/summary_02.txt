And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on the motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction filed by Defendant Anthony Arce. The motion was denied due to its untimely filing and service. The judge notes that the motion was filed and served on July 11, 2024, with a hearing date of August 5, 2024, which means that the 16-day notice period plus an additional two calendar days' notice had not been met. Additionally, the judge notes that Defendant Arce failed to present any evidence in support of the motion and did not cite any legal authority. As a result, the judge finds that the motion is procedurally flawed and denies it in its entirety. Defendant Arce is ordered to file a responsive pleading.
