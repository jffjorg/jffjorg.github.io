And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrers filed by the defendants. After reviewing the moving, opposition, and reply papers, the judge has found that the demurrers are without merit and are therefore overruled. The plaintiff's complaint alleges that the defendants were negligent in their actions, which caused the plaintiff to sustain injuries. The judge has found that the complaint is sufficient to state a cause of action and that the demurrers were filed prematurely. The judge has also noted that the allegations in the complaint are not uncertain and that any further clarifications can be resolved during discovery. As a result, the demurrers are overruled and the case will proceed to the next stage of litigation.
