RULING
            Defendants’ demurrers are OVERRULED.
BACKGROUND
            On September 12, 2023, Plaintiff
Giovannie Pierre-Louis filed a complaint against Defendants Jeffrey C. James,
Del Amo Construction, Inc. Sterling V. McCarthy, and Lyft, Inc., alleging a
cause of action for negligence.
The complaint alleges that on
September 13, 2023, Plaintiff was a passenger in a Lyft Vehicle driven by
defendant Sterling V. McCarthy. Further, it alleges that suddenly, defendant
Jefferey C. James rear-ended the vehicle in which Plaintiff was a passenger,
causing it to rear end the vehicle in front of them. Plaintiff alleges that
defendants James and McCarthy failed to exercise reasonable care. Plaintiff
claims that at the time, defendant James was employed by Del Amo Construction,
Inc. and was acting within the scope of employment. Thus, Plaintiff contends,
as an actual and proximate result of Defendants’ breach of their duty of care,
Plaintiff sustained injuries.
 
            On April 15, 2024, Defendants Del Amo
and James each filed a demurrer. On June 25, 2024, Plaintiff filed an
opposition. On July 29, 2024, Defendant filed a reply.
REQUEST FOR JUDIAL
NOTICE
Defendants
seek judicial notice of Plaintiff’s Complaint.
The
request is granted pursuant to Evidence Code section 452(d).
 
LEGAL AUTHORITY
A demurrer for sufficiency tests
whether the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007)
147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When considering demurrers, courts read the
allegations liberally and in context. (Taylor v. City of Los Angeles Dept.
of Water and Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228.) The court “treat[s]
the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded, but not
contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law ….” (Berkley v. Dowds
(2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 518, 525).) In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must
be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian
v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994).) A demurrer tests the
pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters; therefore, it
lies only where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are
judicially noticed. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 430.30, 430.70.) The only issue
involved in a demurrer hearing is whether the complaint, as it stands,
unconnected with extraneous matters, states a cause of action. (Hahn, supra,
147 Cal.App.4th at 747.) 
 
Demurrers
for uncertainty are strictly construed, because discovery can be used for
clarification, and apply where defendants cannot reasonably determine what
issues or claims are stated. (Khoury v. Maly’s of Cal., Inc. (1993) 14
Cal.App.4th 612, 616; Weil & Brown, Civ. Pro. Before Trial (The Rutter
Group 2011) ¶¶7:85-7:86.) “A demurrer for uncertainty will not lie where the
ambiguous facts alleged are presumptively within the knowledge of the demurring
party.” (Bacon v. Wahrhaftig (1950) 97 Cal.App.2d 599, 605.) 
 
DISCUSSION
i.                   
Meet and Confer Requirements 
            Defendant submits the Declaration of Christopher
Grossi, which adequately shows Counsel met and conferred prior to bringing these
demurrers.
(Code Civ. Proc. § 430.41.) 
ii.                 
Demurrer
Defendants demur to the cause of action for negligence
arguing it fails to plead sufficient facts and it is uncertain.
 
The elements for negligence are: (1) a legal duty owed to
the plaintiff to use due care; (2) breach of duty; (3) causation; and (4)
damage to the plaintiff. (County of Santa Clara v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2006)
137 Cal.App.4th 292, 318.)  In California, negligence may be
pleaded in general terms. (Landeros v. Flood (1976) 17 Cal.3d
399, 407-408.) 
Defendants argue that Plaintiff
fails to plead sufficient facts as to duty, breach of duty, and causation. 
The complaint alleges that on
September 13, 2023, Plaintiff was a passenger in a Lyft Vehicle driven by
defendant Sterling V. McCarthy. Further, it alleges that suddenly, defendant
Jefferey C. James rear-ended the vehicle in which Plaintiff was a passenger,
causing it to rear end the vehicle in front of them. Plaintiff alleges that
defendants James and McCarthy failed to exercise reasonable care. Plaintiff
claims that at the time, defendant James was employed by Del Amo Construction,
Inc. and was acting within the scope of employment. Thus, Plaintiff contends,
as an actual and proximate result of Defendants’ breach of their duty of care,
Plaintiff sustained injuries.
As noted above, negligence may be
pleaded in general terms. Plaintiff’s complaint is pleaded in general terms.
Plaintiff alleges that Defendant rear-ended the vehicle he was in. This
allegation is more than sufficient to allege the element of breach of the general
duty of care. Plaintiff alleges this caused him injuries. The facts in this
case are very straightforward, and no further elaboration is required. The general rule is that the plaintiff need only allege
ultimate facts, not evidentiary facts.  (Doe v. City of Los Angeles,
42 Cal. 4th 531, 550 (2007).) These allegations are ultimate facts and
are thus sufficient to plead general negligence against Defendants.  At a
later stage of the litigation, Plaintiff will need to prove his allegations
with substantial evidence, but for the purposes of the subject demurrer, these
allegations are enough.  (See Doe, supra, 42 Cal.4th
at p. 550.)   
 
Further, Plaintiff alleges that
James was employed by Defendant Del Amo. “Under the doctrine of respondeat superior, an employer may be held
vicariously liable for torts committed by an employee within the scope of
employment.” (Mary M. v. City of Los Angeles (1991) 54 Cal.3d 202,
208.)  As Defendant James’ alleged
employer, Del Amo’s liability is based on vicarious liability.
 
Moreover, the complaint is not
uncertain as ultimate facts have been pled. Any further clarifications as to
the allegations and claims can be resolved during discovery. Lastly, “[a] demurrer for uncertainty will not lie where the
ambiguous facts alleged are presumptively within the knowledge of the demurring
party.” (Bacon v. Wahrhaftig (1950) 97 Cal.App.2d 599, 605.) 
 
As a result, the demurrers are
OVERRULED.
