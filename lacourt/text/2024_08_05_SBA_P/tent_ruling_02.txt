  CASE NO: 24TRCV00028
 
[TENTATIVE] RULING RE: 
MOTION TO DISMISS FOR LACK OF PERSONAL
  JURISDICTION 
 
Dept. P
8:30 a.m.
August 5, 2024



 
Having considered defendant’s motion and
plaintiff’s opposition, the court rules as follows: the motion to dismiss for lack of personal
jurisdiction is denied.    
 
I.                  
PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND
On
January 3, 2024, Plaintiff Kyle Crowe (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against
Defendants Progress House, Inc. (“Progress”) and Anthony Arce (“Arce”) alleging
causes of action for: (1) negligence, (2) negligent hiring, training,
supervision, and retention, (3) intentional infliction of emotional distress,
(4) negligent infliction of emotional distress, (5) fraud, (6) negligent
misrepresentation, (7) breach of contract, (8) unfair and fraudulent business
practices, and (9) breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing. 
 
On
January 24, 2024, this action was reassigned to the Honorable David K. Reinert
sitting in Department P at Torrance Courthouse effective January 29, 2024. 
 
On
June 9, 2024, Defendant Arce was served with the summons and complaint by
personal service. (See 06/11/24 Proof of Service.)  
 
On
July 11, 2024, Defendant Arce, specially appearing, filed and served the
instant Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Personal Jurisdiction. The motion was
noticed for an August 5, 2024 hearing date. 
On
July 23, 2024, Plaintiff filed and served an opposition to the motion. 
 
As
of August 1, 2024, no reply brief has filed. Any reply brief was required to
have been filed and served at least five court days prior to the hearing. (CCP
§ 1005(b).) 
 
II.               
FACTUAL BACKGROUND 
 
Plaintiff alleges that while staying at
Progress House located at 1409 Marcelina Ave., Torrance, CA 90501 (the
“Property”), he was exposed to bed bugs and suffered injuries therefrom.
(Complaint, ¶¶ 3, 21.)   
 
 
III.            
LEGAL STANDARD
A defendant, on or before the last day of his
or her time to plead, may file and serve a motion to quash service of summons
on the ground of lack of jurisdiction of the court over him or her. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 418.10, subd. (a)(1).)
IV.            
DISCUSSION
 
Moving Party’s Arguments
 
Defendant Arce contends that he was not
involved with Progress House at the time of the incident and therefore cannot
be held liable for the claims alleged in the complaint. 
 
Responding Party’s Opposition 
 
Plaintiff argues that Defendant Arce’s
motion is untimely and must be denied. Plaintiff additionally argues that the
motion is procedurally flawed. 
 
Moving Party’s Reply 
 
As of August 1, 2024, no reply brief has
been filed. 
 
Merits of the Motion
 
Procedural Defects in the Motion
 
“Unless otherwise ordered or specifically
provided by law, all moving and supporting papers shall be served and filed at
least 16 court days before the hearing. The moving and supporting papers served
shall be a copy of the papers filed with the court.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005,
subd. (b).) “[I]f the notice is served by facsimile transmission, express mail,
or another method of delivery proving for overnight delivery, the required
16-day period of notice before the hearing shall be increased by two calendar days.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1005, subd. (b).) “Any period of notice, or any right or
duty to do any act or make any response within any period or on a date certain
after the service of the document . . . shall be extended after service by
electronic means by two court days.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1010.6, subd.
(a)(3)(A).) “When a document may be served by mail, express mail, overnight
delivery, or fax transmission, the document may be served electronically . . .
.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 2.251(a).) 
 
Plaintiff argues that the motion was
untimely filed as it was filed and served on July 11, 2024 with an August 5,
2024 hearing date. The Court agrees. The hearing was noticed for August 5, 2024
so Plaintiff was entitled to 16 court days’ notice plus an additional two calendar
days’ notice. Thus, the instant motion was untimely served and filed. 
 
Additionally, the Court notes that
Defendant Arce did not present any evidence in support of the motion to
dismiss. No declaration accompanied the motion to dismiss. "In law and
motion practice, factual evidence is supplied to the court by way of
declarations.” (Calcor Space Facility, Inc. v. Superior Court (1997) 53
Cal.App.4th 216, 224.) 
 
The Court also
notes that Defendant Arce failed to cite any legal authority in his motion to
dismiss. While the Court recognizes that Defendant Arce is self-represented, a
self-represented litigant is “held to the same standards as attorneys.” (Kobayashi
v. Superior Court (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 536, 543.) 
 
 
    
V. CONCLUSION
 
Based on the foregoing, Defendant Anthony
Arce’s Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Personal Jurisdiction is DENIED in its
entirety. Defendant Arce is ordered to file a responsive pleading.
