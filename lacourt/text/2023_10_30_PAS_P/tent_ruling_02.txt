[1] In the September 15 order, the Court declined to rule
on the other two causes of action in the complaint, unjust enrichment and
promissory estoppel. As these causes of action have not been ruled on or
dismissed, they are technically still operative.  The Court invites Cadelrock to address this
issue at the hearing.
