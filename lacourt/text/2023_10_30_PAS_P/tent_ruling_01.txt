[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR ATTORNEY FEES
 
Date:   October
  30, 2023
Time:  8:30 a.m.
Dept.:  P



          I.
       INTRODUCTION
           This is a collection action with an unusual
wrinkle. In the main action, Plaintiff Cadlerock Joint Venture, L.P.
(Cadlerock) alleges it purchased all right and title to a Citibank,
N.A.(Citibank) business loan. Cadlerock alleges Citibank had extended the loan
to Edith Enterprise, Ltd. (Edith) and that the loan was guaranteed by Edith’s
principal, Helen Young (Young). 
The central contention is that Edith defaulted on
the loan in October 2020, owing $22,999.79, plus interest and late charges.
Cadlerock alleges that after purchasing the loan from Citibank it sent
correspondence to Edith in an attempt to collect the debt, but that Edith
disputed it. This action was filed in May 2022.  
Edith filed a cross-complaint against Citibank.
Edith alleges that from 2008 to November 2020 it maintained a business checking
account. It alleges that in 2011, Citibank offered Edith a business line of
credit, requiring that the business checking account be designated to repay the
loan. Edith alleges that once approved it began using the line of credit and
always paid on time, never missing a payment. Edith alleges that in November
2020, it discovered that Citibank had zeroed out its entire business checking
account without explanation. At the time, the checking account had a balance of
$31,396.60. Edith believed that the business account funds had been used to pay
the line of credit until it was contacted by Cadlerock.  
          The main action was resolved by way of
a motion for summary adjudication granted September 15, 2023. Cadlerock now
moves for an order fixing their fee award. The motion is granted and fees are
awarded in the amount requested. 
 
II.       LEGAL
STANDARD
          Code Civ. Proc. §1033.5(a)(1) provides for attorney fees as
costs when provided for by contract, statute, or law. 
          Civ. Code §1717 (a) provides in part that “reasonable
attorney’s fees shall be fixed by the court and shall be an element of the
costs of suit.”
          PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084
contains the Supreme Court’s explanation of how fees are to be determined. It
states that Civ. Code §1717, “reflects the legislative purpose ‘to establish
uniform treatment of fee recoveries in actions on contracts containing attorney
fee provisions.’ (Citation.) Consistent with that purpose, the trial court has
broad authority to determine the amount of a reasonable fee.” (Id. at
1095.) PLCM teaches that fees are to be determined by calculating the “‘lodestar,’
i.e., the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable
hourly rate.” (Ibid.)   
 
III.     ANALYSIS
A. Prevailing Party
 “In any action on a contract, where the
contract specifically provides that attorney’s fees and costs, which are
incurred to enforce that contract, shall be awarded either to one of the
parties or to the prevailing party, then the party who is determined to be the
party prevailing on the contract, whether he or she is the party specified in
the contract or not, shall be entitled to reasonable attorney’s fees in
addition to other costs.” (CCP § 1717(a).)  “The court, upon
notice and motion by a party, shall determine who is the party prevailing on
the contract for purposes of this section, whether or not the suit proceeds to
final judgment.” (CCP § 1717(b)(1).) “To achieve its goal, [Civil Code section
1717] generally must apply in favor of the party prevailing on a contract claim
whenever that party would have been liable under the contract for attorney fees
had the other party prevailed.” (Hsu v. Abbara (1995) 9 Cal.4th 863,
870–871.) 
Here, Cadlerock argues that it is entitled to
attorney’s fees. Cadlerock urges that it “prevailed upon summary adjudication
on September 15, 2023.” (Motion, p. 3: 9-10.) Cadlerock attaches the ruling on
the summary adjudication in support. (Motion, Exh. 4.) Cadlerock also argues
that “costs permitted under statute and reasonable attorney fees are
recoverable here[.]” (Motion, p.3: 7-8.) Cadlerock avers that “[b]ut for the
efforts of Plaintiff’s attorney and the costs accrued in pursuit of this
matter, Plaintiff would not have been successful on the motion for summary
judgment.” (Motion, p.3: 15-17.) Cadlerock urges that “[t]he entirety of
Plaintiff’s claims against Defendants other than this Motion have been resolved[.]”
(Reply, p. 3: 13-14.) Cadlerock does not argue that it is the prevailing party
on the contract using prevailing party language but functionally does so. 
In reply, Cadlerock urges that it is not a party to
the pending cross-complaint. (Reply, p.4: 17-18.) To the extent that Cadlerock
is attempting to argue that it is the prevailing party on the contract, this is
sufficient as it does address the cross-complaint and argue why the court
should consider it the prevailing party on the complaint.
 
B. Final Judgment on Breach of Contract
Cause of Action 
          Case law establishes that “[a]n order granting partial
summary judgment—or summary adjudication—is not an appealable order.” (Zucker
Ellis LLP v. Superior Court (Nelson) (2017) 12 Cal.App.5th 1233, 1240.) “When a defendant obtains a simple,
unqualified victory by defeating the only contract claim in the action,
[Civil Code] section 1717 entitles the successful defendant to recover
reasonable attorney fees incurred in defense of that claim if the contract
contained a provision for attorney fees. The trial court has no discretion to deny
attorney fees to the defendant in this situation by finding that there was no
party prevailing on the contract.” (Hsu, at p. 877, emphasis added.)
          Here, Cadlerock lodged a proposed judgment on September 15,
2023. (9/15/23 Proposed Judgment.) 
In a
related case citing Hsu, the Court granted attorney fees to the party
that prevailed on the contract causes of action, without respect to the
non-contract causes of action, such as unjust enrichment. (Federal Deposit
Ins. Corp. v. Dintino (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 333, 357.) Whoever prevailed
on the non-contract causes of action did not affect attorney fees granted under
CC 1717. Therefore, the fact that the Court declined to rule on the unjust
enrichment cause of action does not defeat the motion for attorney’s fees. 
Furthermore,
CC section 1717 has a limited application. “[Civil Code section 1717] covers only
contract actions, where the theory of the case is breach of contract, and where
the contract sued upon itself specifically provides for an award of attorney
fees incurred to enforce that contract.” (Xuereb v. Marcus &
Millichap, Inc. (1992) 3 Cal.App.4th 1338, 1342.) Therefore, as Cadlerock
is the prevailing party on the breach of contract cause of action, it is the
prevailing party in terms of CC 1717. As such, it is entitled to attorney’s
fees.[1]
 
B. The Cross-Complaint
It is a well-established law that, in civil matters,
only final judgments are appealable under that statute, which codifies the
"one final judgment rule" (9 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (3d ed. 1985)
Appeal §§ 43-44, pp. 66-68; Eisenberg et al., Cal. Practice Guide: Civil
Appeals & Writs (Rutter 1989) §§ [2.21]-[2.23], pp. 2-8 - 2-9), "and
there cannot be such a final judgment with respect to parties as to whom a
cross-complaint remains pending, even though the complaint has been fully adjudicated.
(9 Witkin, supra, § 56, p. 78.)" (California Dental Assn. v. California
Dental Hygenists' Assn. (1990) 222 Cal. App. 3d 49, 59.)
Defendants argue that attorney fees are not
appropriate here because they are sought on the basis of a non-final judgment.
(Opposition, p.2: 12-13.) Defendant and Cross-Complainant Edith Enterprises
filed a cross-complaint on April 3, 2023, amending it twice to file the Second
Amended Cross-Complaint filed August 28, 2023. Here, Edith Enterprises attempted
to amend their complaint to rename the fictitious Roe 1 as Cadlerock. (10/17/23
Amendment to Complaint- Fictitious or Incorrect Name.) However, the October 17
amendment has not been signed and entered by the Court. (Id.) Cadlerock
has not been served with summons on the Cross-Complaint. (Reply, p.4: 20-21.) Unless
and until the Court signs the October 17 amendment naming Cadlerock as Roe 1 in
the cross-complaint, there is no pending cross-complaint against Cadlerock.
(Reply, p. 4: 21-23.) Additionally, any cross-complaint against Cadlerock would
be subject to CCP section 426.30 and is untimely on that basis. (Reply, p.4: 24-26;
see CCP § 426.30.) 
In sum, the cross-complaint does not preclude
Cadlerock from prevailing on their motion for attorney fees.
 
C.
Reasonableness of Fees
          Defendants argue that the billing records attached to the
Sayyar declaration contain several issues, namely, what the billing records
relate to, and that several other individuals’ names appear on the billing
records.  As there are no declarations
from these individuals, defendants argue the billings may not be correct.
          There is no requirement that billing records be provided in
connection with a motion for fees pursuant to contract. The declaration of
counsel as to the hours expended on this litigation and the hourly rates
charged for such time is all that is required. “[T]here is no legal requirement
that an attorney supply billing statements to support a claim for attorney
fees.” (Mardirossian & Associates, Inc. v. Ersoff (2007) 135
Cal.App.4th 257, 269.) “[T]here is no legal requirement that such statements be
offered in evidence. An attorney’s testimony as to the number of hours worked
is sufficient evidence to support an award of attorney fees, even in the
absence of detailed time records.” (Steiny & Co., Inc. v. California
Electric Supply Co. (2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 285, 293.) 
  “ ‘Although a fee request ordinarily should
be documented in great detail, it cannot be said ... that the absence of time
records and billing statements deprive[s] [a] trial court of substantial
evidence to support an award....’ (Citation.) ‘[T]he verified time statements
of [an] attorney [ ], as [an] officer[ ] of the court, are entitled to credence
in the absence of a clear indication the records are erroneous.’ (Citation.)” (City
of Colton v. Singletary (2012) 206 Cal.App.4th 751, 784-785.) “The law is
clear, however, that an award of attorney fees may be based on counsel’s
declarations, without production of detailed time records.” (Raining Data
Corp. v. Barrenchea (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 1363, 1375.)
          Per City of Colton, the billing records are
assumptively correct, without indication that the records are erroneous.
Defendants do not provide support for their contention that the billing records
are erroneous. As such, because the request for attorney fees is accompanied by
a signed declaration of Ms. Sayyar, plaintiff’s counsel, the request is
sufficiently supported.  
          As to the argument that Cadlerock is limited to recovering
costs related to the collection of amounts due on the account, this argument is
supported by the contract between the parties. (Opposition, Exh. A.) Defendants
do not support how Cadlerock is not doing this, however. In reply, Cadlerock
urges that the attorney fees requested are amounts expended attempting to
collect on the Loan documents. (Reply, p.6: 14-15.)
As
to the argument that Cadlerock should not recover fees for discovery,
Defendants cite no applicable law or cases as to why this is true. Defendants
argue that “[i]t is patently unreasonable for an assignee to conduct discovery
regarding the Loan that it bought from its assignor in a subsequent collection
action for the purposes of driving up more legal fees.” (Opposition, p.4:
15-16.) To the extent that defendants are arguing that the discovery was unreasonable,
this is insufficient as they do not support this contention. Additionally, the
reply provides that these amounts were incurred trying to recover on the Loan
Documents, which the attorney fees provision in the contract provides for.
(Reply, p.7: 6-7.)
Here,
the declaration of counsel provides a sufficient basis for its fee request. Sayyar
avers that “In this action, attorneys in my Firm have spent a total of 106.80
invoiced hours of attorney time and an additional 20.20 hours incurred but not
yet invoiced as of September 30, 2023 for a grand total of 127 billable hours.”
(Sayyar Decl., ¶ 6.)  She further
declares that “In this matter, I and any licensed attorneys of my firm billed
my time at $175.00 an hour, well below the market value for an attorney of our
skill and experience. I have been practicing since 2004 and have been licensed
in California since 2008. My firm also includes an of counsel attorney who has
been practicing law in California since 1988.” (Sayyar Decl., ¶ 4.) In sum,
Sayyar’s averments that the billing records attached to her declaration reflect
hours billed in this action are statements made as an officer of the court.  
          The Court has examined the evidence presented by Cadlerock
and makes the following findings: $175.00 per hour is a reasonable hourly rate.
127 billable hours, while high, reflects the amount of time expended in this
litigation. As such, the Court GRANTS the motion for attorney fees in the
amount of $22,225.00. As to costs, the Court finds that the memorandum of costs
filed September 28, 2023 provides sufficient basis to award the costs requested
in the amount of $2,168.88. (9/28/23 Memorandum of Costs.)
          
IV.     CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
          Cadlerock’s motion for attorney fees and costs is granted.
Attorney Fees are awarded in the amount of $22, 225.00. Costs are awarded in
the amount of $2,216.88. 
          Cadelrock is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
