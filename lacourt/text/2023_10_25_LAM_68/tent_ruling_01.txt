  Case Number:  23STCV00203    Hearing Date:   October 25, 2023    Dept:  68 Shalana Beard vs. SBS Trust Deed Network, 23STCV00203Motion to Deem Requests for Admission AdmittedMotion to Compel Responses to Form InterrogatoriesMotion to Compel Responses to Requests for ProductionMoving Party – Shalana BeardMoving Parties’ PositionOn June 18, 2023, Plaintiff Shalana Beard (Plaintiff) served Defendant SBS Trust Deed Network (Defendant) with Requests for Admission, Form Interrogatories, and Requests for Production. After Plaintiff granted an extension, responses were due by July 31, 2023, but no responses were ever received. (Motions at p. 1.) Plaintiff filed these motions on September 6, 2023. Plaintiff seeks an order deeming the requests for admission admitted and an order compelling responses to the form interrogatories and requests for production. Pursuant to CCP § 2033.280, Plaintiff seeks sanctions in the amount of $1,050 for each of the motions. No opposition has been filed.AnalysisDeem Requests for Admission AdmittedResponses to requests for admission are due within thirty days from the date the propounding party serves the requests. (CCP § 2033.250.) Failure to timely respond to requests for admission results in waiver of all objections to the requests, including claims of privilege or work product protection. (CCP § 2033.280(a).) The propounding party of requests for admission may move for an order that “the truth of any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction.” (CCP § 2033.280(b).)  Defendant has not responded to Plaintiff’s Requests for Admission. Plaintiff has moved for orders deeming the RFAs admitted. The Court grants Plaintiff’s motion. Form InterrogatoriesThe propounding party may move for an order compelling responses and monetary sanctions if a party to whom the interrogatories are directed fails to respond. (CCP §§ 2030.290, 2030.300; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 404.) Responses to interrogatories are due within thirty days from the date of service of the interrogatories. (CCP §§ 2030.260(a), 2016.050.) The responding party waives any objections to the interrogatories by failing to serve responses in a timely manner. (CCP § 2030.290(a).)Defendant has failed to respond to Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatories. Plaintiff has moved for an order compelling Defendant’s response to these Interrogatories. The Court grants Plaintiff’s motion to compel responses to the Form Interrogatories.Requests for ProductionA propounding party may move to compel responses to requests for production of documents where the responding party fails to provide responses. (CCP § 2031.300.) The responding party must provide responses within thirty days after the demand is served. (CCP § 2031.030(c)(2) & (3).) The responding party waives all objections, including privilege and work product, by failing to timely respond to requests for production of documents. (CCP § 2031.300.)Defendant has failed to provide responses to Plaintiff’s request for production of documents. Plaintiff has moved for an order compelling production of those documents. The Court grants Plaintiff’s motion to compel responses to the requests for production.SanctionsCCP § 2030.290(c) states “the Court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with § 2033.010) against any party, person or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or the other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” Moreover, CCP §2023.030 authorizes the Court to issue sanctions against a party engaging in conduct that is a misuse of the discovery process. Failure to respond to discovery, evasive responses, and objections lacking substantial justification are “misuses of the discovery process.” (CCP § 2023.010, subd. (d)-(f).) Further, “it is mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction…on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion.” (CCP § 2033.280.)Plaintiff has requested sanctions in the amount of $1,050 against Defendant and its attorney of record, Shalom Rubanowitz, for each of the three motions. The amount was based on Plaintiff’s counsel spending a total of 1.0 hours preparing each of the motions, 0.5 hours expected to review the opposition and draft a reply, and 0.5 hour attending the hearing at $525.00 an hour. (Brinton Decl., ¶ 6.) That would be 6 hours between the three motions for a total of $3,150 in sanctions.Because no opposition and reply were filed, the Court will deduct 1.5 hours from the 6 hours. Additionally, because the motions will all be heard at the same hearing, the Court will deduct another hour from the total. That would be 3.5 hours at $525 an hour for a total of $1,837.50 in sanctions.Plaintiff’s request for sanctions against Defendant and its attorney of record is granted in the total amount of $1,837.50.OrderPlaintiff’s motion to deem requests for admission admitted is granted.Plaintiff’s motion to compel responses to form interrogatories is granted.Plaintiff’s motion to compel responses to requests for production is granted.Defendant is ordered to serve its responses within twenty (20) days of this order.Defendant and its attorney of record are ordered to pay sanctions in the total amount of $1,837.50. Defendant is ordered to pay these sanctions to Plaintiff’s counsel within twenty (20) days of this order.
