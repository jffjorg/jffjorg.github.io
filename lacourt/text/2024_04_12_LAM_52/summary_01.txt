Here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Bernhard G. Mueller v. Hyundai Motor America. The plaintiff, Mueller, had applied to reopen discovery to defend himself against defendant Hyundai's claims of spoliation of evidence. The court has denied Mueller's application, finding that he failed to show good cause to reopen discovery. The court has also granted defendant Hyundai's motion for sanctions for spoliation of evidence in part, ordering that the jury be instructed to consider the ability of each party to provide evidence and whether one party intentionally concealed or destroyed evidence. The court will not give the jury instructions Nos. 203 and 204 if the evidence at trial does not support them.
