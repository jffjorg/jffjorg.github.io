CRISTAL
  PICTURES, INC., et al.


 Case No.: 
  23STCV14822
 
 
 
 Hearing
  Date:  March 5, 2024



 
The Court denies
Plaintiff’s default judgment packet.  
The
Court sets a hearing on an order to show cause why the complaint should not be
dismissed and/or Plaintiff’s counsel sanctioned $250 for failing to enter
default judgment (California Rule of Court, rule 3.110(h)) on April 5, 2024, at
8:30 AM in Department 71 at Stanley Mosk Courthouse for the following reasons:

1.    
The
request for court judgment does not properly seek an amount that is equal to or
less than the amount sought in the complaint or C.C.P. §425.11 statement of
damages.  Plaintiff’s prayer does not provide a specific amount of damages. 
(See, e.g., Falahati v. Kondo (2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 823, 830-831 [stating court acts in excess of its
jurisdiction and the resulting default judgment is void if the court awards
default judgment in an amount greater than that demanded in the complaint,
including if the complaint does not specify the amount demanded].)
2.    
Declarant
does not submit exhibits with authenticated foundation in support of the amount
of damages sought. 
3.    
Plaintiff
has not shown liability as to each defendant and that recovery is not
duplicative.
4.    
No
interest calculation provided.
5.    
Attorneys’
fees sought are not calculated according to the local rule but are for an
amount less than the Local Rule 3.2 schedule would provide for the damages
sought.
