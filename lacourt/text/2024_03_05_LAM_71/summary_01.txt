Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on Vegamour, Inc.'s unopposed motion to quash the three record subpoenas served on the Better Business Bureau (BBB) by Erica Wohlwend, the plaintiff. The judge grants the motion in part and modifies it in part.

The judge grants the subpoena to the BBB in McLean, Virginia, as it is not subject to the court's jurisdiction because the BBB is a non-party entity located outside of California.

The judge grants the motion to quash the two subpoenas to the BBB in San Jose, California, as modified, with regard to Requests 1-4, and denies it, but subject to a protective order for Requests 5-8. The judge finds that the requests are overbroad and lack specificity, and that they are not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.

The judge limits the scope of the requests to the period during which Erica Wohlwend was employed by Vegamour, Inc., and orders that the requests be subject to a protective order for any privileged or confidential information.
