The Judge's tentative ruling grants the motion to consolidate the two cases, 21STCV19312 and 24LBCV00458, for trial efficiency and to avoid inconsistent adjudications. The Court finds that the cases are related and that the need to have both the wrongful death trial and the trial of the survival claims held together outweighs any prejudice that will occur as a result of the need to continue the trial date. The Court sets the demurrers for hearing in Department S27 at 8:30 a.m. on August 1, 2024. The motion to consolidate is therefore granted.
