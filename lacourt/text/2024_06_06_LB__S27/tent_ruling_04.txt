 Case Number:  22LBCV01066    Hearing Date:   June 6, 2024    Dept:  S27 On 5/03/24, the Court heard
Defendant’s ex parte application for a protective order to prevent Plaintiff
from deposing him twice.  The Court
granted the application and scheduled a hearing on a motion to compel the
deposition of Rodger Wilson for 6/06/24. 
To date, Plaintiff has not filed papers in support of a motion to compel
deposition.  
 
Notably, the Court did not issue an
order shortening notice for any motion to compel deposition.  Moving papers were therefore due at least
sixteen court days prior to the hearing pursuant to CCP §1005.  Because no timely moving papers were filed, the
Court takes the motion to compel off calendar. 

 
Plaintiff is ordered to give
notice.  
 
Parties who intend to submit
on this tentative must send an email to the court at gdcdepts27@lacourt.org indicating intention to submit on the tentative
as directed by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department
does not receive an email indicating the parties are submitting on the
tentative and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion may be placed
off calendar.  If a party submits on
the tentative, the party’s email must include the case number and must identify
the party submitting on the tentative. If any party does not submit on the
tentative, the party should make arrangements to appear remotely at the hearing
on this matter.
