And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case where the plaintiff obtained a default judgment against the defendant on March 5, 2024. The plaintiff then filed a motion for attorneys' fees and costs on April 22, 2024. The judge has denied the motion to the extent it seeks an award of attorneys' fees, citing Garcia v. Politis (2011) which states that requests for attorneys' fees must be made with the request to enter default judgment. The judge has also denied the motion to the extent it seeks recovery of costs, as costs on default judgment are recovered by filling out a form, which the plaintiff already did and received an award of $999.98. The judge has ordered the plaintiff to give notice.
