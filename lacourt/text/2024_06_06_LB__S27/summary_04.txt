The judge is considering a motion to enforce a settlement between Senator Corner LLC (the plaintiff) and Hans Peter Koch (the defendant). The plaintiff is seeking to enforce the settlement, which was entered into on September 29, 2023. The settlement requires the defendant to cede possession of the subject premises and pay past due rent, holdover damages, attorneys' fees, and costs. The judge has concerns about the motion, including the lack of a declaration from Debra Friedman, the inconsistency between the stipulation and the plaintiff's motion, and the unclear status of the writ of possession and sealing of the file. The judge is requiring the plaintiff to clarify these issues at the hearing before granting the motion.
