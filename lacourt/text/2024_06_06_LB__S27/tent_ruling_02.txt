 Case Number:  21STCV19312    Hearing Date:   June 6, 2024    Dept:  S27 1.     Background
Facts
Plaintiffs, Claudia and Josue
Morales filed this action against Defendants, Long Beach Memorial Medical
Center, Memorial Health Services, Praveen R. Jonnala, M.D., and Ali Khoynezhad,
M.D., PhD for negligence, hospital negligence, and loss of consortium.  Plaintiff added Ivana Radeva, M.D. as Doe 1
and California Anesthesia Associates Medical Group, Inc. as Doe 5.  The complaint arises out of Defendants’ care
and treatment of Claudia Morales for cardiothoracic surgery.  
 
2.     Motions
to Consolidate
a.     Parties’ Positions 
Plaintiffs move to consolidate this
case with 24LBCV00458.  Plaintiffs
contend consolidation is appropriate because Morales succumbed to her injuries
on 4/12/23, necessitating the filing of a wrongful death action against the
same defendants who were named in the original action.  
 
Defendants oppose the motion.  Initially, they note that the two cases have
not been deemed related and are not pending in the same department.  Second, they contend there is a demurrer
pending in the newly-filed case that will be heard on 7/23/24, and the demurrer
is well-taken and necessary to challenge claims Plaintiffs have attempted to
resurrect by filing a new action.  They
note that a new defendant is named in the newly-filed action, and a defendant
who was recently dismissed by way of summary judgment is also added back into
the new action.  
 
Any reply to the opposition was due
on or before 5/30/24.  The Court has not
received timely reply documents.
 
b.     Law Governing Consolidation
CCP §1048 grants discretion to the
trial courts to consolidate actions involving common questions of law or
fact.  The trial court's decision will
not be disturbed on appeal absent a clear showing of abuse of discretion.  (Feliner v. Steinbaum (1955) 132 Cal.App.2d
509, 511.)  A consolidation of actions
does not affect the rights of the parties. 
The purpose of consolidation is to avoid unnecessary costs or delay,
avoid duplication of procedure, particularly in the proof of issues common to
both action, and avoid inconsistent results by hearing and deciding common
issues together.  (See Estate of Baker
(1982) 131 Cal.App.3d 471, 485.)  Each
case presents its own facts and circumstances, but the court generally
considers the following: (1) timeliness of the motion: i.e., whether granting
consolidation would delay the trial of any of the cases involved; (2)
complexity: i.e., whether joining the actions involved would make the trial too
confusing or complex for a jury; and (3) prejudice: i.e, whether consolidation
would adversely affect the rights of any party. (See State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins.
Co. v. Superior Court (1956) 47 Cal.2d 428, 430–431.)  In deciding whether to grant a motion to
consolidate, the court should weigh whether the common issues predominate over
the individual issues and whether any risks of jury confusion or prejudice to
the parties outweighs the reduction in time and expense that would result from
consolidation. (Todd-Stenberg v. Shield (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 976, 978.)  
 
Consolidation is a procedure for
uniting separate lawsuits for trial, where they involve common questions of law
or fact and are pending in the same court. 
(See CCP § 1048.)  The purpose is
to enhance trial court efficiency (i.e., to avoid unnecessary duplication of
evidence and procedures); and to avoid the substantial danger of inconsistent
adjudications (i.e., different results because tried before different juries,
or a judge and jury, etc.).  (See
Todd-Stenberg v. Dalkon Shield Claimants Trust (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 976,
978–979.)  There are two types of
consolidation under §1048: (1) a consolidation for purposes of trial only,
where the two actions remain otherwise separate, and (2) a complete
consolidation or consolidation for all purposes, where the two actions are
merged into a single proceeding under one case number and result in only one
verdict or set of findings and one judgment. 
(Hamilton v. Asbestos Corp. (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1127, 1147.)  The trial court's decision will not be
disturbed on appeal absent a clear showing of abuse of discretion.  
 
A consolidation of actions does not
affect the rights of the parties.  The
purpose of consolidation is merely to promote trial convenience and economy by
avoiding duplication of procedure, particularly in the proof of issues common
to both actions.  (See Estate of Baker
(1982) 131 Cal.App.3d 471, 485.)  In
deciding whether to grant a motion to consolidate, the court should weigh
whether the common issues predominate over the individual issues and whether
any risks of jury confusion or prejudice to the parties outweighs the reduction
in time and expense that would result from consolidation. (Todd-Stenberg v.
Shield (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 976, 978.)  
c.     Analysis
Plaintiffs did not file a notice of
related cases before they filed this motion. 
Instead, they filed their notice of related cases on 5/23/24, the same
day Defendants filed their opposition to the motion.  The Court finds the cases are related, and
24LBCV00458 is transferred to Department S27 for all further proceedings.  
 
Because the cases are now related,
the issue of whether or not to consolidate them is now ripe for
determination.  The crux of Defendants’
opposition is that Plaintiffs have improperly brought both a cause of action (battery)
and a dismissed defendant (Dr. Jonnala) back into the action, and have also
added a new defendant (Dr. White) into the action.  It is unclear why Plaintiffs named Dr.
Jonnala in 24LBCV00458, but Plaintiffs’ notice of motion expressly indicates
that any defendant dismissed from 21STCV19312 by way of summary judgment will
also be dismissed from 24LBCV00458; indeed, dismissal of Dr. Jonnala was filed
on 5/30/24.
 
As will be discussed further below,
this court will hear the demurrer in 24LBCV00458 prior to trial, and if any
cause of action has been improperly pled, it will be dismissed
accordingly.  
 
The biggest issue is the fact that
Dr. White is named as a defendant in 24LBCV00458, but was never named in
21STCV19312.  This means Dr. White will
necessarily not be prepared for the currently scheduled trial date of 9/30/24
in 21STCV19312.  
 
The Court finds the need to have
both the wrongful death trial and the trial of the survival claims held
together far outweighs any prejudice that will occur as a result of the need to
continue the trial date.  The motion to
consolidate is therefore granted.
 
d.     Clarifying Details
The cases are deemed related, and
the motion to consolidate is granted. 
21STCV19312 is the lead case.  All
future papers must be filed in 21STCV19312 and all future hearings must be
scheduled in 21STCV19312.  All future
hearing dates in 24LBCV00458 are vacated.
 
There are demurrers scheduled in
24LBCV00458 for 7/23/24 and 8/01/24.  The
Court sets both demurrers for hearing in Department S27 at 8:30 a.m. on
Thursday, 8/01/24.  
 
The Court is not, at this time,
continuing the FSC and trial dates, which are scheduled for 9/26/24 and 9/30/24
respectively.  In the event Dr. White is
dismissed in the nascent stages of litigation in 24LBCV00458, the trial date
will stand.  In the event the case
against Dr. White ultimately goes forward, the Court will permit the parties,
on or after 8/01/24, to file an ex parte application to continue the FSC and
trial dates in light of his recent appearance in the action.  
 
Plaintiffs are ordered to give
notice.   
 
Parties who intend to submit
on this tentative must send an email to the court at gdcdepts27@lacourt.org indicating intention to submit on the tentative
as directed by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department
does not receive an email indicating the parties are submitting on the
tentative and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion may be placed
off calendar.  If a party submits on
the tentative, the party’s email must include the case number and must identify
the party submitting on the tentative.  If
the parties do not submit on the tentative, they should arrange to appear
remotely.
