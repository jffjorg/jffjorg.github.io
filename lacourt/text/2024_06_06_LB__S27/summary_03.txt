And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The court has issued a tentative ruling regarding the hearing on the motion to compel the deposition of Rodger Wilson. The court granted the defendant's ex parte application for a protective order to prevent the plaintiff from deposing him twice. The court scheduled a hearing on the motion to compel deposition for June 6, 2024. However, the plaintiff failed to file papers in support of the motion to compel deposition, and the court did not issue an order shortening notice for the motion. As a result, the court takes the motion to compel off calendar. The court orders the plaintiff to give notice, and parties who intend to submit on the tentative must send an email to the court indicating their intention to submit. The court will consider the motion to compel off calendar if no submissions are made.
