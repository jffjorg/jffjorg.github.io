 Case Number:  23LBCV01052    Hearing Date:   June 6, 2024    Dept:  S27 Plaintiff obtained a default
judgment against Defendant on 3/05/24. 
On 4/22/24, Plaintiff filed this motion for attorneys’ fees and
costs.  
 
To the extent the motion seeks an
award of attorneys’ fees, it is summarily denied.  Pursuant to Garcia v. Politis (2011) 192
Cal.App.4th 1474, 1479, a request for attorneys’ fees MUST be made
with the request to enter default judgment, and a post-judgment motion is not
permitted and is improper.  
 
To the extent the motion seeks
recovery of costs, it is also summarily denied. 
Costs on default judgment are recovered by way of filling out ¶7 of the
request for entry of default judgment form, which Plaintiff filled out and
which resulted in an award of costs in the amount of $999.98 in the
judgment.  There is no authority
permitting a motion to recover additional costs, and no additional costs are
awarded.
 
Plaintiff is ordered to give
notice.
