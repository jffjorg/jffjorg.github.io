And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving a lawsuit against Dollar Tree Stores, Inc. and others. The lawsuit was filed by Adam Dolewski, who alleges that he was confined in a freezer at a Dollar Tree location in Long Beach for a substantial period of time, which caused him injuries and damages. The defendants, including Hill Phoenix, Inc. and Hill Phoenix WIC, LLC, have filed a cross-complaint against Hill Phoenix, which seeks terminating sanctions against Dollar Tree due to its destruction of the freezer in which the incident occurred. The judge has ruled that terminating sanctions are not appropriate in this case as Dollar Tree did not engage in egregious misconduct. Instead, the judge has ordered a jury instruction under CACI 204, which will allow the jury to consider the destruction of the freezer and determine whether to draw any inferences from it.
