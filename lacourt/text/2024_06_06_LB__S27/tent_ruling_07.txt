 Case Number:  23LBCV01452    Hearing Date:   June 6, 2024    Dept:  S27 2.     Motions  to be Relieved as Counsel Platinum’s Attorney, Omar S. Anorga, seeks to be relieved as counsel of  record for Platinum in both the above case, and also related case 23LBCV02437,  contending there has been a breakdown of the attorney-client relationship, such  that relief is necessary.     The Court has one minor concern with the moving papers, which must be  addressed at the hearing prior to the Court granting the motion.  Counsel failed to check box 3a(1) or 3a(2) on  the declaration form, one of which must be checked in order to grant the  motion.  The Court presumes Counsel  intended to check box 3a(2) in light of his response to 3b(1)(b), but Counsel  must clarify at the hearing.   If and only if the Court is satisfied with Counsel’s responses, the Court  will grant the relief sought.     3.     Case  Management Conference The parties are reminded that there  is a CMC on calendar in both related cases today.  The Court asks the parties to make  arrangements to appear remotely at the hearing on the petition, motions to be  relieved, and CMCs.
