And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling regarding a petition for release of property from a lien. The petition was previously denied due to defects in the petition, including insufficient proof of service and failure to attach necessary documents. However, new documents have been filed, including a Declaration of Brian J. Wagner and a Notice of Hearing, which cure the defects. The judge notes that the lien has not been removed, and the petition is not moot. The judge is inclined to grant the petition and limit attorneys' fees to $5583.50. The judge also notes that the lien has not been removed and wishes to hear from counsel concerning the current status of the lien.
