The court notes that the petitioner has cured the defects in the original petition, including the failure to attach copies of Exhibits A, B, and C. The court will hear from counsel at the hearing concerning whether the lien has been removed. If the lien has not been removed, the court will grant the petition. The court is inclined to limit attorneys' fees to $5583.50. The court also notes that the petitioner seeks to recover attorneys' fees in the amount of $12,852.18, but this amount is not supported by the evidence. The court will hear the motion to be relieved as counsel of record for Platinum.
