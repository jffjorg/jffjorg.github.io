**Significant Statements**
```
"The court sustains the demurrer with leave to amend and denies the motion to strike."
"The Complaint does plead that Plaintiff was subjected to offensive and harmful contact from the bedbugs, but it does not plead that Defendants intended the harm or offensive contact to occur."
"Punitive damages may not be pleaded generally. The mere allegation of an intentional tort was committed is not sufficient to warrant an award of punitive damages."
"These constitute sufficient facts to support Plaintiff's prayer for punitive damages."
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the defendants, JM Holdings LLC and Joseph Mersi, and has made the following ruling.

First, the judge sustains the demurrer with leave to amend, meaning that the complaint does not adequately state a cause of action for battery, and gives the plaintiff an opportunity to amend the complaint.

Second, the judge denies the motion to strike, which sought to strike punitive damages and all allegations supporting punitive damages from the complaint.

The judge's reasoning is that the complaint does not plead that the defendants intended the harm or offensive contact to occur, and that the allegations of punitive damages are insufficient. However, the judge notes that the complaint does plead sufficient facts to support a claim for punitive damages, and therefore denies the motion to strike.

Finally, the judge grants leave to amend, allowing the plaintiff to revise the complaint to address the defects identified in the demurrer and motion to strike.
