COURT’S [TENTATIVE]
  RULING RE: 
 
(1) Demurrer
(2) Motion to Strike 
 



[THE FOLLOWING IS
A TENTATIVE RULING IN THE ABOVE CASE]:                                                                                                  
 
Defendants JM
Holdings LLC and Joseph Mersi demur to the sixth cause of action for battery in
and move to strike punitive damages from the complaint brought by Plaintiff
Kevin Moda. This court sustains the demurrer with leave to amend and denies the
motion to strike.
 
I. BACKGROUND
Plaintiff Kevin
Moda (“Plaintiff”) has been a residential tenant of defendants JM Holdings LLC
(“JM Holdings”) and Joseph Mersi (“Mersi” and, together with JM Holdings,
“Defendants”) since August 2017. (Complaint p. 3, 8.) Plaintiff alleges that
during his tenancy, Defendants failed to correct the uninhabitable conditions
at Plaintiff’s rented apartment.
On November 27,
2023, Plaintiff initiated this action by filing a complaint (the “Complaint”)
alleging causes of action for (1) Breach of the warranty of habitability (Civil
Code § 1941.1), (2) breach of the warranty of habitability (Health & Safety
Code § 17920.3), (3) breach of the warranty of habitability (Civil Code §
1942.4), (4) negligence—premises liability, (5) nuisance, (6) battery, (7) intentional
infliction of emotional stress, (8) breach of contract, (9) breach of the covenant
of quiet enjoyment, and (10) unfair business practices (Business and
Professions Code § 17200, et seq.).
 
On June 3, 2024,
Defendants filed a demurrer (the “Demurrer”) and a motion to strike (the
“Motion”). On July 3, 2024, Plaintiff filed oppositions (the “Oppositions”) to
the Demurrer and the Motion, to which Defendants replied on July 8, 2024.
 
II. PROCEDURAL MATTERS 
 
A.   Timeliness of Filings 
 
Per California Code of Civil Procedure
§¿430.40, subdivision (a), a demurrer to a complaint should be filed within 30
days after service of the complaint. Similarly, per California Code of Civil
Procedure §¿435, subdivision (b)(1), a motion to strike should be filed “within
the time allowed to respond to a pleading,” which is 30 days. (See Cal. Code
Civ. Proc. §¿412.20, subd. (a)(3).) “If the
parties are not able to meet and confer at least five days prior to the date
the responsive pleading is due, the demurring party shall be granted an
automatic 30-day extension of time within which to file a responsive pleading,
by filing and serving, on or before the date on which a demurrer would be due,
a declaration stating under penalty of perjury that a good faith attempt to
meet and confer was made and explaining the reasons why the parties could not
meet and confer.” (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §¿430.41(a)(2).)¿
 
Per California Code of Civil Procedure
§¿1005, subdivision (b), moving papers should be filed at least 16 court days
before they are set for hearing, oppositions thereto should be filed at least
nine court days before the set hearing, and replies to any oppositions should
be filed at least five court days before the set hearing. Judges have discretion
as to whether to consider or strike an untimely demurrer or pleading. (McAllister
v. County of Monterey (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 253, 281; Tuck v. Thuesen
(1970) 10 Cal.App.3d 193, 196, disapproved on other grounds by Neel v.
Magana, Olney, Levy, Cathcart & Gelfand (1971) 6 Cal.3d 176.)¿¿¿¿ 
 
Plaintiff filed proofs of service
indicating that Defendants were each personally served on April 8, 2024. On May
3, 2024, Defendants filed a declaration stating
that parties had not been able to meet and confer and seeking an automatic
30-day extension of time within which to file a demurrer or motion to strike. 
 
We are satisfied that all
filings made in connection with the Demurrer and the Motion are timely.
 
B.   The Meet and Confer Requirement 
 
California Code of Civil Procedure
§¿430.41, subdivision (a) and §¿435.5, subdivision (a) requires parties to
“meet and confer” in good faith before the filing of a demurrer or a motion to strike,
respectively, to attempt to informally resolve the objections raised in the
demurrer or the motion to strike. Each section requires that such meet and
confer be done “in person or by telephone.” (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §§¿430.1,
subd. (a), 435.5, subd. (a).)¿¿¿¿¿ 
 
Defendants submit with the Demurrer and the Motion a declaration by their
counsel stating that she met and conferred with Plaintiff’s counsel before the
filing of the Demurrer and the Motion but that they were unable to resolve the
issues therein. (Mintesnot Decl. ¶ 2.) We are therefore satisfied that
this requirement has been met.
 
III. DISCUSSION 
 
A.   The Demurrer 
 
Defendants demur
to the sixth cause of action for battery on the grounds that the Complaint
fails to state facts sufficient to constitute the cause of action. (Notice of
Demurrer p. 2.) They argue that the Complaint “offers no facts reflecting any
intent on the part of Defendants required to maintain a battery cause of action.”
 
The elements of civil battery are:
(1) defendant intentionally performed an act that resulted in a harmful or
offensive contact with the plaintiff's person;
(2) plaintiff did not consent to the contact; and (3)the harmful or offensive contact caused injury, damage, loss or harm to plaintiff.
(Brown v. Ransweiler (2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 516, 526–27.) That “defendant
touched plaintiff, or caused plaintiff to be touched, with the intent to harm
or offend plaintiff” is one of the “essential elements of a cause of action for
battery.” (So v. Shin (2013) 212 Cal.App.4th 652, 669.) Battery is an
intentional tort and “[i]n the perpetration of [battery] negligence is not
involved.” (Bartosh v. Banning (1967) 251 Cal.App.2d 378, 385.)
 
Plaintiff rebuts
that he pleads “throughout the Complaint” that Defendants acted intentionally
in failing to remedy the bedbug infestation in his apartment. (Opposition p.
8.)
 
While Plaintiff
does plead that Defendants acted intentionally in failing to remedy the alleged
bedbug infestation, this is a step removed from the harm that Plaintiff
suffered, that being offensive and harmful contact from the bedbugs. Following So
v. Shin, supra, 212 Cal.App.4th 652 at 669, Plaintiff must allege
that Defendants intended the harm or offensive contact with Plaintiff to occur,
not just the act that caused such harm or offensive contact. As Defendants
observe, the conduct that Plaintiff alleges could arise to mere negligence
rather than intentionality, which is insufficient to support a cause of action
for battery.
 
Accordingly, this
court SUSTAINS the Demurrer.
 
B.  
The Motion to Strike
 
Defendants move to
strike punitive damages and all allegations supporting punitive damages from
the Complaint. (Motion p. 4.)
 
A motion to strike is appropriate to
attack a claim for punitive damages. (Grieves v. Superior Court (1984)
157 Cal.App.3d 159, 164.) “In order to survive a motion to strike an allegation
of punitive damages, the ultimate facts showing an entitlement to such relief
must be pled by a plaintiff.¿In passing on the correctness of a ruling on a
motion to strike, judges read allegations of a pleading subject to a motion to
strike as a whole, all parts in their context, and assume their truth.” (Clausen
v. Superior Court (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 1253, 1255 (internal citations
omitted).) “Further, even though certain language pleads ultimate facts or
conclusions of law, such language when read in context with the facts alleged
as to defendants' conduct may adequately plead the evil motive requisite to
recovery of¿punitive¿damages.” (Monge v. Superior Court (1986) 176
Cal.App.3d 503, 510.)¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿ 
“In order to state a prima facie claim
for¿punitive¿damages, a complaint must set forth the elements as stated in the
general¿punitive¿damage¿statute,¿Civil Code section 3294.” (Turman v.
Turning Point of Central California, Inc. (2010) 191 Cal.App.4th 53, 63.)
California Civil Code section 3294 authorizes the recovery of punitive damages
“[i]n an action for the breach of an obligation
not arising from contract, where it is proven by clear and convincing evidence
that the defendant has been guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice….”¿
(Civ. Code § 3294(a).) “In order to justify an award of punitive¿damages, the
defendant must be guilty of oppression, fraud or malice. He must act with the
intent to vex, injure or annoy, or with a conscious disregard of the
plaintiff's rights.” (Silberg v. California Life Ins. Co. (1974) 11
Cal.3d 452, 462 (internal citations omitted).) “A claim for exemplary damage
may be supported by pleading that the wrong was committed willfully or with a
design to injure.” (Spinks v. Equity
Residential Briarwood Apartments
(2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 1004, 1055.) “[M]alice in fact is required rather
than implied malice.¿However, malice does not require actual intent to
harm.¿Conscious disregard for the safety of another may be sufficient where the
defendant is aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his or her conduct
and he or she willfully fails to avoid such consequences.” (Angie M. v.
Superior Court (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1217, 1228 (internal citations
omitted).) “In order to justify an award of punitive damages on this basis, the
plaintiff must establish that the defendant was aware of the probable dangerous
consequences of his¿conduct, and that he wilfully and deliberately failed to
avoid those consequences.” (Taylor v. Superior Court (1979) 24 Cal.3d
890, 895–96.)¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿ 
“Punitive¿damages¿may not
be¿pleaded¿generally.” (Today’s IV, Inc. v. Los Angeles County Metropolitan
Transportation Authority (2022) 83 Cal.App.5th 1137, 1193.) “The mere
allegation an intentional tort was committed is not sufficient to warrant an
award of¿punitive¿damages.” (Grieves v. Superior Court, supra,
157 Cal.App.3d 159 at 166.) And, “conclusory characterization of defendant's
conduct as intentional, wilful and fraudulent is a patently insufficient
statement of “oppression, fraud, or malice, express or implied,” within the
meaning of¿section 3294.” (Brousseau v. Jarrett (1977) 73 Cal.App.3d
864, 872.) “Not only must there be circumstances of oppression, fraud or
malice, but facts must be alleged in the pleading to support such a claim.” (Grieves,
supra, at 166; Today’s IV, Inc. v. Los Angeles County Metropolitan
Transportation Authority, supra, at 1193 [“In addition to the requirement
that the operative complaint set forth the elements as stated in¿section 3294,
it must include¿specific¿factual allegations showing that defendant's conduct
was oppressive, fraudulent, or malicious to support a claim
for¿punitive¿damages.”].)¿ 
 
“[P]unitive¿damages¿may
be awarded in an action by a¿residential¿tenant¿based on the landlord's
interference with peaceful possession. Punitive¿damages¿likewise are
recoverable for… the infliction of emotional distress.” (Spinks v. Equity
Residential Briarwood Apartments, supra, 171 Cal.App.4th 1004 at
1055, internal citations omitted.) In Stoiber v. Honeychuck (1980) 101
Cal.App.3d 903, 920, a residential tenant “pleaded sufficient facts to support
her prayer for exemplary damages” when her complaint both “alleged that
defendant had actual knowledge of defective conditions in the premises
including leaking sewage, deteriorated flooring, falling ceiling, leaking roof,
broken windows, and other unsafe and dangerous conditions” and “alleged that
defendants ‘In maintaining said nuisance,… acted with full knowledge of the
consequences thereof and the damage being caused to plaintiff, and their
conduct was willful, oppressive and malicious.’”¿ 
 
Defendants argue that the
Complaint “ha[s] made broad allegations and blanket characterizations of
Defendant[s’] conduct without explaining how such conduct arises to the
requisite level of culpability to impose punitive damages.” (Motion p. 7.)
Defendants contend that the Complaint contains mere “conclusions of law” rather
than the “ultimate facts.” (Ibid.)
 
However, the Complaint
alleges that (1) there was a bedbug infestation in the apartment Plaintiff
rented from Defendants (Complaint p. 13), (2) Plaintiff notified Defendants of
the infestation “incessantly” (id. at pp. 13–14), (3) Defendants, who
are experienced landlords, failed to remedy the infestation despite this notice
(id. at p. 14), and (4) Defendants’ conduct in doing so was “intentional,
malicious, willful and reckless” (ibid.). Following Stoiber v.
Honeychuck, supra, 101 Cal.App.3d 903 at 920, these constitute
sufficient facts to support Plaintiff’s prayer for punitive damages. 
 
Accordingly, this
court DENIES the Motion.
 
C.  
Leave to Amend
 
“Where the defect raised
by a¿motion¿to¿strike¿or by demurrer is reasonably capable of cure,
leave¿to¿amend¿is routinely and¿liberally¿granted to give the plaintiff a
chance to cure the defect in question.” (CLD Construction, Inc. v. City of
San Ramon (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 1141, 1146.) “[An order granting a motion
to strike] is analogous to an order sustaining a demurrer.” (Vaccaro v.
Kaiman (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 761, 768.) “If the plaintiff has not had an
opportunity to amend the complaint in response to the demurrer, leave to amend
is liberally allowed as a matter of fairness, unless the complaint shows on its
face that it is incapable of amendment.” (City of Stockton v. Superior Court
(2007) 42 Cal.4th 730, 747.) Courts generally allow at least one time to amend
a complaint, after sustaining a demurrer, even without any request for leave to
amend. (McDonald v. Superior Court (1986) 180 Cal. App. 3d 297, 303.)¿¿¿ 
¿ 
We note that this is the first time the Complaint has
been subject to a motion to strike or demurrer and believe that the defects in
the Complaint that are struck are reasonably capable of cure.¿ 
¿ 
Accordingly, this court GRANTS leave to amend.¿
