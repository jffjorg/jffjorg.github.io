COURT’S [TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE: Motion for Leave to File an Amended Complaint 
 
 



 
[THE FOLLOWING IS A TENTATIVE RULING IN THE ABOVE CASE]:

 
Plaintiff Karl Perman seeks to amend the Complaint by
filing a First Amended Complaint ("FAC") substituting in Karl Perman
as successor-in-interest to deceased plaintiff Niko Honarbakhsh pursuant to
Code of Civil Procedure section 377.31. 
 
The Court GRANTS the unopposed
Motion for Leave to file an Amended Complaint. 
 
BACKGROUND
         On
February 11, 2020, Plaintiffs Karl Perman, and Niko Honarbakhsh, husband and
wife, filed the complaint against Defendants Yulia Gayevska; Balboa Real Estate
Holdings, LLC; Balboa Mortgage and Realty, Inc., a California corporation, Oak
Tree Realty, a business entity form unknown; and DOES 1 through 25. The
complaint alleges (1) breach of contract, (2) breach of implied covenant of
good faith and fair dealing, (3) promise without intent to perform, (4)
negligence, (5) fraud in the inducement, and (6) declaratory relief. 
         
         On
June 3, 2024, Plaintiff Karl Perman filed his motion for leave to amend
complaint. 
 
         As
of August 5, 2024, no opposition has been filed. 
 
LEGAL STANDARD
 
         Leave
to amend is permitted under Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision
(a) and section 576. The policy favoring amendment and resolving all matters in
the same dispute is “so strong that it is a rare case in which denial of leave
to amend can be justified. . ..” “Although courts are bound to apply a policy
of great liberality in permitting amendments to the complaint at any stage of
the proceedings, up to and including trial [citations], this policy should be
applied only ‘where no prejudice is shown to the adverse party . . ..
[citation].  A different result is
indicated ‘where inexcusable delay and probable prejudice to the opposing
party’ is shown. [Citation].” (Magpali v.
Farmers Group (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 471, 487.) 
 
           A
motion for leave to amend a pleading must also comply with the procedural
requirements of California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1324, which requires a
supporting declaration to set forth explicitly what allegations are to be added
and where, and explicitly stating what new evidence was discovered warranting
the amendment and why the amendment was not made earlier. The motion must also
include (1) a copy of the proposed and numbered amendment, (2) specifications
by reference to pages and lines the allegations that would be deleted and
added, and (3) a declaration specifying the effect, necessity and propriety of
the amendments, date of discovery and reasons for any delay. (See Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1324, subds. (a), (b).)
                                                                                                          
DISCUSSION
 
           Plaintiff
Karl Perman has complied with California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1324. Here,
Plaintiff Karl Perman submits the proposed FAC which substitutes in Karl Perman
as successor-in-interest to Niko Honarbakhsh. No other changes have been made. Niko
Honarbakhsh passed away on February 12, 2024. 
California Code of Civil Procedure section 377.31 states: "On
motion after the death of a person who commenced an action or proceeding, the
court shall allow a pending action or proceeding that does not abate to be
continued by the decedent's personal representative or, if none, by the
decedent's successor in interest. Further, "The court in which an action
is commenced or continued under this article may make any order concerning
parties that is appropriate to ensure proper administration of justice in the
case ... " Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §377.33. No opposition has been filed as
of August 5, 2024. 
 
Thus, the Court GRANTS the motion
for leave to amend.
