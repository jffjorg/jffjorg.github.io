And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court grants the unopposed motion for leave to file an amended complaint, allowing Plaintiff Karl Perman to substitute himself as successor-in-interest to deceased plaintiff Niko Honarbakhsh. The motion was filed on June 3, 2024, and no opposition was filed by the deadline of August 5, 2024. The proposed First Amended Complaint (FAC) does not include any changes other than the substitution of Karl Perman as successor-in-interest. The court notes that Niko Honarbakhsh passed away on February 12, 2024, and that the FAC is filed under Code of Civil Procedure section 377.31, which allows a pending action to be continued by the decedent's personal representative or successor-in-interest. The court finds that the motion complies with the procedural requirements of California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1324, and grants the motion for leave to amend.
