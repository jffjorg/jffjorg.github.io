The judge has also granted the plaintiff's motion for order permitting discovery of defendant Philip Sobol, MD's financial condition. The judge has weighed the evidence and found that the plaintiff has established a substantial probability of prevailing on the punitive damage claim. The judge has ordered the defendant to comply with the discovery order by November 12, 2024. The judge has also indicated that if the case proceeds to trial, they may bifurcate the punitive damage phase and require evidence of the defendant's financial condition to be disclosed only if the jury finds that the defendant acted with oppression, fraud, or malice.
