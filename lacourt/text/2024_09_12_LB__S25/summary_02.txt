And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Defendant Insource. The demurrer challenges the legal sufficiency of the 2nd, 3rd, and 6th causes of action in the complaint. The court finds that the complaint fails to state sufficient facts to support the 2nd cause of action (emotional distress) and the 3rd cause of action (violation of Business and Professions Code 17200). The court also finds that the 6th cause of action (violation of California Homeowner's Bill of Rights) fails to state a claim, but gives the plaintiff leave to amend the complaint to possibly cure these defects. The court orders the plaintiff to have 30 days leave to amend the complaint.
