And here is the English text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the Defendant's Motion to Bifurcate. The motion is denied without prejudice, meaning it can be raised again at a later time. The court orders that the bifurcation briefing be included in the trial binders along with any motions in limine filed in the case. The judge recognizes that a motion in limine cannot be used to seek an order to try an issue before the trial of another issue or issues. The Defendant properly sought a bifurcation order in advance of the trial date, but the court finds it appropriate for the trial judge to determine whether bifurcation is warranted, given that the case will be tried by a different court than the one ruling on this motion.
