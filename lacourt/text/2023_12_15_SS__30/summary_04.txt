Judge Dwayne Ellis Burt's tentative ruling on plaintiff's motion to consolidate cases with related case 22STCV16202. The motion is continued to allow plaintiff to file and serve the notice of motion to consolidate in the related case. The court finds that both cases arise from the same vehicle collision and involve identical issues of law and fact, making consolidation feasible. However, plaintiff has not complied with CRC Rule 3.350(a)(1) by not filing the notice of motion to consolidate in the related case. The purpose of consolidation is to enhance trial court efficiency by avoiding unnecessary duplication of evidence and the danger of inconsistent adjudications. The court will continue the matter to allow plaintiff to correct the issue and re-file the notice of motion.
