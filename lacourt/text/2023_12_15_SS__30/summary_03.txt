And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for sanctions filed by Postmates, Inc. against Rafael Quijano. The motion is denied. The court finds that the record does not reflect an adequate basis for a finding that the complaint is frivolous to warrant sanctions of any kind under Section 128.7 of the California Code of Civil Procedure. The court also notes that sanctions under Section 128.7 are not mandatory and should be made with restraint. The judge also denies Quijano's request for sanctions against Postmates, Inc. The court finds that Quijano and his counsel did not file the complaint for an improper purpose and that the complaint is not without merit. The court also finds that the creation of a Postmates account under Hernandez's name by Quijano was done with authorization from Hernandez and therefore does not constitute fraud.
