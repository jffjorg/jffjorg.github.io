And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by counsel for plaintiff Karen Shahgeldyan to be relieved as counsel. The motion is denied without prejudice because the proposed order is incomplete and does not list all hearing dates, and there is no proof of service showing that the defendants have been served with the papers. The Judge orders counsel to file a new motion, declaration, and corrected proposed order that lists all current hearing dates, serves all parties who have appeared, and files proof of service.
