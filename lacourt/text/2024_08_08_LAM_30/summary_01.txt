And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed the motion by Nasimi and A&Y International Global Inc. (Defendants) to disqualify Plaintiff's counsel, Andrew Ritholz, from participating in the case. The motion is denied. The Court finds that there is no substantial relationship between attorney Ritholz's prior representation of Nasimi and A&Y International Global Inc. in an unrelated matter and the current case, which involves a breach of contract claim related to the purchase of textiles. The Court concludes that attorney Ritholz did not acquire confidential information "material to the current representation" and therefore did not breach his fiduciary duties. The motion to disqualify counsel is denied.
