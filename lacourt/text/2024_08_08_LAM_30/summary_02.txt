And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This tentative ruling denies the defendant's renewed motion for summary adjudication on the issue of duty. The defendant argues that it did not owe a duty to the plaintiff under their employment contract to refrain from requiring the plaintiff to participate in the preparation and presentation of fabricated avatars, and to refrain from retaliating against or terminating the plaintiff if they raised concerns over their reasonable belief that the defendant violated California and federal laws. However, the court has already ruled on the issue of breach of contract and duty, and the defendant has not presented newly discovered facts, circumstances, or a change of law supporting the issues reasserted in the latest summary adjudication motion.
