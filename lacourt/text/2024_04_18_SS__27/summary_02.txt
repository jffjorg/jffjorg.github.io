And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the defendant's motion to compel further responses to discovery requests. The court finds that the plaintiff did not fail to produce responsive medical and billing records, and that the defendant's motion is premature. The court notes that the parties must participate in an initial discovery conference (IDC) before a motion to compel further responses can be heard. The court also denies the defendant's request for sanctions. A hearing will be held on April 18, 2024, at which the parties may submit or appear to argue their positions.
