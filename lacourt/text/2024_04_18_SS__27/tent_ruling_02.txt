Case No./Name.:      21STCV46815 RENEE HATFIELD vs STATER BROS
MARKETS
Motion Name:           MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TO REQUESTS
FOR PRODUCTION, SET ONE, AND FOR SANCTIONS
Moving Party:           Defendant Stater Bros Markets
Responding Party:    Plaintiff
Notice:                     Sufficient
 
Ruling:                     MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TO REQUESTS
FOR PRODUCTION, SET ONE, AND FOR SANCTIONS IS DENIED.
 
On December 23, 2021,
Plaintiff filed the present premises liability case. On October 6, 2023,
Defendant served Plaintiff with Request for Production, Set One. After several
extensions, Plaintiff served discovery responses on January 16, 2024. Defendant
contends that Plaintiff did not produce the responsive medical and billing
records and now moves the court to compel further responses.
The Parties need to attend an IDC before the
present motion can be heard. Personal Injury Hub Courts will not entertain
Motions to Compel Further Discovery Responses until the parties have
participated in an IDC. (See Eighth Amended Standing Order for
Procedures in the Personal Injury Hub Court at p. 7.) The Court may either deny
or continue a Motion to Compel Further Responses to discovery if the parties do
not schedule and complete an IDC prior to the hearing date set for a Motion to
Compel Further Responses to Discovery. (Id.) 
If Plaintiff, in her responses to requests for
production, agreed to produce the responsive medical and billing documents but
failed to do so, the proper motion to bring would be a motion to compel
compliance under CCP 2031.320, not a motion to compel further under CCP
2031.310.  
The present motion to compel further is DENIED without
prejudice and the request for sanctions is likewise DENIED.
