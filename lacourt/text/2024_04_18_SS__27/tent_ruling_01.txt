Background
On April 1,
2019, Plaintiff filed the present medical malpractice case. The complaint
alleges that Plaintiff was born prematurely at 30 weeks gestation, resulting in
a bilateral Grade 4 intraventricular hemorrhage. The case was settled on
December 14, 2020. As a Medi-Cal recipient, Plaintiff received services worth
$151,920.04 for his injuries, paid by Medi-Cal. On April 22, 2021, the
Department of Health Care Services (DHCS) sent Plaintiff a letter with an
itemized list of services received from the Medi-Cal program, setting a final
lien amount at $153,084.17, but reduced that to $112,157.75 pursuant to Welfare
and Institutions Code section 14124.72. Plaintiff requested a further
reduction, but DHCS refused. The parties dispute the appropriate amount to be
reimbursed. Medi-Cal now moves the court to determine the amount of the
Medi-Cal lien and reimbursement.
Analysis
Under
Welf. & Inst. Code §14124.785, “The director’s recovery is limited to the
amount derived from applying Section 14124.72 [reduction for attorney fees and
costs only], 14124.76 [Ahlborn
methodology], or 14124.78 [Department cannot recover more than plaintiff],
whichever is less, to the total settlement . . . .”  
Welf.
& Inst. Code §14124.72(d)
Under
Welf. & Inst. Code §14124.72(d), “The director’s claim for reimbursement of
the benefits provided to the beneficiary shall be limited to the amount of the
director’s lien, as defined in subdivision (d) of Section 14124.70 [reasonable
value of benefits provided on behalf of the beneficiary].  If the action or claim is brought by the
beneficiary alone and the beneficiary incurs a personal liability to pay
attorney’s fees and costs of litigation, the amount of the director’s lien that
is reimbursed shall be reduced by 25 percent, which represents the director’s
reasonable share of attorney’s fees paid by the beneficiary, and that portion
of the cost of litigation expenses determined by multiplying the actual
litigation expenses by the ratio of the amount reimbursed to the director as
satisfaction of the director’s lien, prior to deducting reasonable attorney’s
fees and litigation expenses, to the full amount of the settlement . . . .”
Plaintiff
received $151,920.04 worth of services arising out of his injuries and paid by
Medi-Cal. (Declaration of Karina Valadez (Valadez Decl.), ¶ 31.) This amount is
not disputed by Plaintiff in the opposition. With a reduction of 25 percent for
director’s reasonable attorney’s fee, the total amounts to $112,157.75 under §14124.72(d).

Welf
& Inst. Code 14124.76
Under
Welf. & Inst. Code 14124.76(a), “. . . . Recovery of the director’s lien
from an injured beneficiary’s action or claim is limited to that portion of a
settlement . . . that represents payment for medical expenses, or medical care,
provided on behalf of the beneficiary. 
All reasonable efforts shall be made to obtain the director’s advance
agreement to a determination as to what portion of a settlement . . . that
represents payment for medical expenses, or medical care, provided of behalf on
the beneficiary.  Absent the director’s
advance agreement as to what portion of a settlement . . . for medical
expenses, or medical care, provided on behalf of the beneficiary, the matter
shall be submitted to a court for decision. 
Either the director or the beneficiary may seek resolution of the dispute
by filing a motion, which shall be subject to regular law and motion
procedures.  In determining what portion
of a settlement . . . represents payment for medical expenses, or medical care,
provided on behalf of the beneficiary and as to what the appropriate
reimbursement amount to the director should be, the court shall be guided by
the United States Supreme Court decision in Arkansas
Department of Health and Human Services v. Ahlborn (2006) 547 U.S. 268 and
other relevant statutory and case law.”
“In
Ahlborn, the United States Supreme Court held that in seeking
reimbursement ‘the State's assigned rights extend only to recovery of payments
for medical care.’  In response to Ahlborn,
the California Legislature amended the California statutes governing claims for
reimbursements made by the Department for funds expended on behalf of injured
parties by the Medi-Cal program.  (Bolanos
v. Superior Court (2008) 169 Cal. App. 4th 744, 747 . . . .)  Namely, from any settlement, judgment or
award obtained by an injured party, the Department is limited to recovering
payments it made for medical expenses. 
(§ 14124.76, subd. (a).)  ‘In
determining what portion of a settlement, judgment, or award represents payment
for medical expenses, or medical care, provided on behalf of the beneficiary
and as to what the appropriate reimbursement amount to the director should be,
the court shall be guided by . . . Ahlborn . . . and other relevant
statutory and case law.’  ‘[W]hen the
settlement, judgment or award does not specify what portion thereof was for
past medical expenses, an allocation must be made in the settlement, judgment
or award that indicates what portion is for past medical expenses as distinct
from other damages.  The director’s
recovery is limited to that portion of the settlement that is allocated to past
medical expenses.’”  Aguilera v. Loma
Linda University Medical Center (2015) 235 Cal. App. 4th 821,
827 (citations omitted).
“Settlements,
however, are often not allocated between past medical expenses and other
damages.  This was the situation in Ahlborn. 
Thus, the parties in Ahlborn
stipulated to the use of a formula (the Ahlborn
formula) as an allocation method. . . . The Ahlborn
formula is the ratio of the settlement to the total claim, when applied to the
benefits provided by the Department. 
Expressed mathematically, the Ahlborn
formula calculates the reimbursement due as the total settlement divided by the
full value of the claim, which is then multiplied by the value of benefits
provided.  (Reimbursement Due = [Total
Settlement ÷ Full Value of Claim] x Value of Benefits Provided.).”  Id.
at 827-28.
“The
fundamental point is that a settlement that does not distinguish between past
medical expenses and other damages must be allocated between these two classes
of recoveries.  Without such an
allocation, the principle set forth in Ahlborn,
that the state cannot recover for anything other than past medical expenses,
cannot be carried into effect.”  Bolanos, supra, at 753.  
In
calculating the Full Value of Claim, the court eliminates the future expenses
for medical care because plaintiff is covered by Medi-Cal, and it is reasonably
probable that the Department will be paying those future expense. (Declaration
of Sara McDonald, ¶ 8.)
The
court accepts the amount of $3,293,040 for lost wages, as presented by
Plaintiff, and $250,000.00 for pain and suffering for a medical malpractice
case. The lien amount of $151,920.04 is
undisputed.  Thus, the court finds the
Full Value of Claim is approximately $3,694,960.04.
Using
the Ahlborn formula,
Total
settlement $2,200,000.00 ÷ $3,694,960.04. = .595
.595
x $151,920.04 = $90,392.42
Then
using §14124.72(d) for the reduction of attorney’s fees, 
$90,392.42– $22,598.11 (25% in
attorney fees) = $67,794.31
 
Then,
using §14124.72(d) for the reduction for litigation expenses,
$90,392.42÷ $2,200,000.00
= .0411 (ratio of Department’s share of settlement amount)
 
.0411
x $38,161(total costs) = $1,568.42
 
        $67,794.31- $1,568.42 = $66,225.89
 
Welf
& Inst. Code §14124.79
“Notwithstanding
any other provision of law, in no event shall the director recover more than
the beneficiary recovers after deducting, from the settlement judgment, or
award, attorney fees and litigation costs paid for by the beneficiary. If the
director’s recovery is determined under this section, the reductions in
subdivision (d) of Section 14124.72 shall not apply.”
The
court finds that this section does not apply because plaintiff recovered more
than the Department under the maximum recoverable by the Department.
Conclusion
Under
Welf. & Inst. Code §14124.785, the lowest of the three sections (Section
14124.72 [reduction for attorney fees and costs only], 14124.76 [Ahlborn methodology], or 14124.78
[Department cannot recover more than plaintiff]) is $66,225.89. Thus, the Court orders Plaintiff to pay $66,225.89 to California Department of Health Care
Services
