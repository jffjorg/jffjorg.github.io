  Case Number:  21PSCV00617    Hearing Date:   November 13, 2023    Dept:  G Defendants Fleet Capital, Inc., Sam Ostayan, and Inco Builders’  Motion for Dismissal and Monetary Sanctions Respondent: Plaintiff Diana  Culkin TENTATIVE RULING Defendants Fleet Capital, Inc., Sam Ostayan, and Inco  Builders’ Motion for Dismissal and Monetary Sanctions is DENIED without  prejudice. BACKGROUND This  is a wrongful foreclosure action. On July 30, 2021, Plaintiff Diana Culkin,  also known as Diana Jannette Marmolejo Corona, filed a complaint against Fleet  Capital, Inc. (Fleet Capital), Best Alliance Foreclosure and Lien Services  Corp. (Best Alliance), Inco Builders (Inco), and Does 1-25, alleging the  following causes of action: (1) violation of California's non judicial  foreclosure statutes, (2) wrongful foreclosure, (3) conversion, (4) unfair  business practices, and (5) declaratory relief. On  February 9, 2022, Inco filed a cross-complaint against Culkin, Michael Culkin,  and Roes 1-10, alleging the following causes of action: (1) trespass and (2)  slander of title. On  February 23, 2022, Fleet Capital and Inco filed a motion for judgment on the  pleadings as to Culkin’s complaint. On August 4, the court granted the motion  with leave to amend. On  October 7, 2022, Culkin filed a First Amended Complaint (FAC) against the same  defendants, as well as Sam Ostayan, alleging the following causes of action: (1)  violation of California's nonjudicial foreclosure statutes, (2) wrongful  foreclosure, (3) quiet title, (4) unfair business practices, and (5)  declaratory relief. On January 5, 2023, the court sustained a demurrer by Fleet  Capital, Inco, and Ostayan. On  February 24, 2023, the court denied Fleet Capital and Inco’s motion to dismiss  Culkin’s action for failure to file a timely amended complaint and deemed  Culkin’s Second Amended Complaint (SAC) filed as of that date. The SAC is  against the same defendants and alleges the following causes of action: (1)  violation of California's nonjudicial foreclosure statutes, (2) wrongful  foreclosure, (3) quiet title, (4) promissory estoppel, (5) breach of the  covenant of good faith and fair dealing, (6) violation of the Rosenthal Fair  Debt Collection Practices Act, (7) unfair business practices, and (8)  declaratory relief. On May 4, the court sustained a demurrer by Fleet Capital,  Inco, and Ostayan in part and overruled it in  part. On August 4, 2023, Fleet  Capital, Ostayan, and Inco (collectively, Defendants) filed the present motion.  A hearing on the motion is set for November 13 along with a case management  conference, OSC Re: Why this court should not assess Defendant reasonable  attorney fees and costs, and a hearing on a motion to be relieved as counsel. ANALYSIS Defendants  move for monetary and terminating sanctions against Culkin and Culkin’s counsel  pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 128.7. For the following reasons,  the court DENIES Defendants’ motion. Legal Standard Pursuant  to Code of Civil Procedure section 128.7, “a court may impose sanctions if it  concludes a pleading was filed for an improper purpose or was indisputably  without merit, either legally or factually.” (Bucur v. Ahmad (2016) 244  Cal.App.4th 175, 189.) “A claim is factually frivolous if it is ‘not well  grounded in fact’ and is legally frivolous if it is ‘not warranted by existing  law or a good faith argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of  existing law.’” (Ibid, quoting Guillemin v. Stein (2002) 104  Cal.App.4th 156, 167.) The moving party bears the burden of showing the “the  party’s conduct in asserting the claim was objectively unreasonable.” (Ibid.)  “A claim is objectively unreasonable if ‘any reasonable attorney would agree  that [it] is totally and completely without merit.’” (Ibid, quoting In  re Marriage of Flaherty (1982) 31 Cal.3d 637, 650.)¿But this section “should  be utilized only in ‘the rare and exceptional case where the action is clearly  frivolous, legally unreasonable or without legal foundation, or brought for an  improper purpose.’” (Kumar v. Ramsey (2021) 71 Cal.App.5th 1110, 1121 (Kumar),  quoting Operating Engineers Pension Trust v. A-C Co. (9th Cir. 1988) 859  F.2d 1336, 1344.) Code  of Civil Procedure section 128.7 also includes a safe harbor provision that states  a “[n]otice of motion shall be served as provided in Section 1010, but shall  not be filed with or presented to the court unless, within 21 days after  service of the motion, or any other period as the court may prescribe, the  challenged paper, claim, defense, contention, allegation, or denial is not  withdrawn or appropriately corrected.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 128.7, subd. (c)(1);  Li v. Majestic Industry Hills, LLC (2009) 177 Cal.App.4th 585, 590-591.)  This safe harbor requirement is strictly enforced, and substantial compliance is  not sufficient. (See Cromwell v. Cummings (1998) 65 Cal.App.4th  Supp.10, 15.) “If  warranted, the court may award to the party prevailing on the motion the  reasonable expenses and attorney’s fees incurred in presenting or opposing the  motion.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 128.7, subd. (c)(1).) An award of fees is not  warranted unless the motion was “frivolous, unfounded, filed for an improper  purpose, or otherwise unreasonable.” (Musaelian v. Adams (2011) 197  Cal.App.4th 1251, 1258.) Discussion Prior  to the filing of this motion on August 4, 2023, Defendants’ counsel served a  copy of the motion on Culkin’s counsel via email on July 11. Because Defendants’  original service of this motion was twenty-four days before it was filed, the  court finds Defendants have complied with the safe harbor provisions of Code of  Civil Procedure section 128.7. In  this case, Defendants’ motion is premature. Defendants argue sanctions are  warranted because Culkin’s first, second, and seventh causes of action are  based on “knowingly false allegations.” But because the issues raised here are  more appropriately raised in a motion for summary judgment or adjudication, the  court exercises its discretion and declines to find Culkin’s SAC is without  merit. Accordingly,  the court DENIES Defendants’ motion without prejudice. CONCLUSION Based on the foregoing,  Defendants’ motion for sanctions is DENIED without prejudice.
