And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling denies Plaintiff Gregory Allen French's motion for trial preference without prejudice. The court analyzed the motion under California Code of Civil Procedure section 36, which allows for trial preference in certain circumstances. French argued that his medical condition, which includes a spinal infection, poor diabetes management, morbid obesity, and vascular disease, raises substantial medical doubt regarding his survival beyond six months. However, the court found that the doctor's opinion, while indicating that French is in significant ill health, lacked clear and convincing evidence to support the claim of substantial medical doubt. The court also noted that the doctor's declaration repeated the same findings, giving the misleading impression that the declaration was more substantial than it was. As a result, the court denied French's motion for trial preference without prejudice.
