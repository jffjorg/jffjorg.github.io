English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling on a motion for sanctions filed by Fleet Capital, Inc., Sam Ostayan, and Inco Builders. The court denies the motion without prejudice, finding that it is premature and that the issues raised are more appropriate for a motion for summary judgment or adjudication. The court also notes that the safe harbor provision of Code of Civil Procedure section 128.7 has been complied with. The court declines to find that Culkin's Second Amended Complaint is without merit, and therefore, the motion for sanctions is denied.
