- "The Court finds that AUSD has not shown that O'Brien's actions fall within the scope of Gov. Code § 815."

```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court denied Arcadia Unified School District's (AUSD) motion for summary judgment, which argued that Plaintiff Ze Yu Bei (Kevin Bei) did not timely submit a government tort claim and that AUSD is immune from common law tort liability. The court found that Plaintiff's evidence, including a declaration and supporting exhibits, established a triable issue of fact as to whether a government tort claim was timely submitted. The court also held that AUSD's arguments in support of its motion were not persuasive and that Plaintiff's claims for negligence, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and negligent infliction of emotional distress were not barred by Government Code § 815. The court denied AUSD's motion for summary adjudication of the first, fourth, and fifth causes of action.
