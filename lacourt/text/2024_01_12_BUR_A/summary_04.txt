And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the motion for summary judgment filed by American Express National Bank against Aluyah Imoisili. The court has found that American Express has met its burden to show that there is no triable issue of fact regarding Imoisili's indebtedness for consideration and his subsequent nonpayment. The court has considered the credit card statements presented by American Express, which show that Imoisili failed to make monthly payments on his credit card account. Imoisili has not provided any evidence to refute these statements.

The court has also considered Imoisili's arguments that he was not personally served with process and that the timing of issuance of his American Express Platinum Card is material. However, the court has found that Imoisili's declaration based on his best recollection is insufficient to rebut the evidence presented by American Express.

As a result, the court has granted American Express's motion for summary judgment and has entered a judgment in the amount of $73,934.56 against Imoisili.
