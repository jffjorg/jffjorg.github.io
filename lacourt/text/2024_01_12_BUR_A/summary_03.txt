And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the plaintiff's First Amended Complaint (FAC) and has overruled the state's demurrer to the second cause of action for dangerous condition. The court finds that the FAC contains sufficient facts to state a cause of action and that any ambiguities or uncertainties in the pleading can be resolved through discovery. The court also notes that the state's demurrer was based on an apprehension that there may be additional facts not stated in the FAC, but the court does not find that this constitutes a sufficient ground for demurrer. The court orders that responsive pleadings shall be filed within 30 days, and the case management conference is continued to February 28, 2024.
