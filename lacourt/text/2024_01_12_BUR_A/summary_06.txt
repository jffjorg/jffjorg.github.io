Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motions to compel discovery responses from the defendants and deem request for admissions (RFA) matters admitted. The defendants failed to respond to the plaintiff's discovery requests, including form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for production of documents (RFPD). The plaintiff's counsel attempted to contact the defendants' counsel, Isaiah Artest, regarding the delinquent discovery responses, but received no response. The judge finds that the defendants' failure to respond waives any objections to the discovery requests and grants the plaintiff's motions to compel.

The judge also awards sanctions against the defendants and their counsel in the amount of $1,620. The sanctions are for the defendants' failure to timely respond to the discovery requests and for failing to file an opposition to the plaintiff's motions to compel.

The judge orders that verified responses to the discovery requests are due within 30 days, and that the plaintiff is to give notice to all parties unless they waive notice. The ruling is subject to change after the parties' review and any objections they may have.
