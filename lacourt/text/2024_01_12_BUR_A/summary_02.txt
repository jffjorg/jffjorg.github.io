And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to substitute party plaintiff, brought by Erma Miller to substitute herself for the deceased party L.B. Stites. The court has granted the motion, finding that Miller has satisfied all the statutory requirements to substitute as the party plaintiff. The court has considered the parties' submissions and has determined that Miller's declaration, which describes her relationship with Stites and her claim to be his successor in interest, is sufficient to establish her standing to bring the action. The court has also considered the defendants' arguments, including their contention that Miller and Stites were not married, but has found that these arguments do not affect the court's decision on the motion. The court's ruling does not affect the defendants' ability to argue that Stites lacks standing to bring the action in future motions.
