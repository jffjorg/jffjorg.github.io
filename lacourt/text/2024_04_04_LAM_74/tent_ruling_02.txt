The court notes Plaintiff’s proposed preliminary injunction would enjoin
Defendant from disposing of Plaintiff’s personal property, including a 2004
Porsche. The proposed injunction would also require Defendant to return to
Plaintiff his personal property, including the 2004 Porsche. But the vehicle
has been returned to Plaintiff. (Whittmore Supp. Decl., ¶ 29.) Moreover, the ex parte
application and proposed order do not identify the other personal property to
which the injunction would apply. Thus, the court will not grant this portion
of the preliminary injunction Plaintiff seeks.
