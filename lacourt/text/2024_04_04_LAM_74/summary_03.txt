And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court denies Defendants' motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication. The notice to pay rent or quit was not defective, as it provided alternative payment methods, including an online tenant portal that the parties had already agreed to use. The court finds that Defendants have not met their prima facie burden to show that the notice is defective.
