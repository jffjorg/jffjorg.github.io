Summary:

This is a tentative ruling on an order to show cause whether to issue a preliminary injunction in a business dispute between Hussein Sidky (Plaintiff) and Ramy Baramily, et al. (Defendants). The Plaintiff seeks a preliminary injunction to enjoin the Defendants from operating the subject business, accessing its accounts and systems, and disposing of the Plaintiff's personal property. The court finds that the Plaintiff has a reasonable probability of prevailing on the merits and that the balance of harm tips in his favor. Therefore, the court will issue a preliminary injunction that enjoins the Defendants from engaging in any conduct that impairs the assets of the subject business, but will not enjoin them from operating the business or accessing its accounts and systems. The court will also not vest in the Plaintiff total control of the Defendant's business, exclusive access to its accounts and systems, and exclusive property rights of all assets and opportunities arising from the Defendant's business.
