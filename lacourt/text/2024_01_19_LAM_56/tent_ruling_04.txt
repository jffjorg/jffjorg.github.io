AND RELATED CROSS-ACTION
 
MOVING PARTY: Robert Marc Hindin (“Hindin”)
 
On
December 20, 2023, Hindin filed a motion to be relieved as counsel (the
“Motion”) for Defendant/Cross-Complainant Khalil Brian Zaghian
(“Defendant”).  The Motion is compliant
with California Rules of Court,
rule 3.1362.  The Motion is
unopposed.  Any opposition papers were
required to have been filed and served at least nine court days before the
hearing under California Code of Civil Procedure section 1005,
subdivision (b).
 
DISCUSSION
The
court has discretion on whether to allow an attorney to withdraw, and a motion
to withdraw will not be granted where withdrawal would prejudice the
client.  (Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915.)  
 
In
support of the Motion, Hindin declares that there has been a complete breakdown
in attorney/client communication that renders effective representation
impossible.  The Court finds this to be
an adequate basis for withdrawal.  For
this reason and because it is unopposed, the Court provisionally GRANTS the
Motion.  (Sexton v. Superior Court (1997)
58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.)  Defendant may indicate whether he needs a
trial continuation in order to retain new representation at the time of the
hearing. 
 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If
the department does not receive an email and there are no appearances at the
hearing, the motion will be placed off calendar. 
 
         Dated this 19th day of January 2024
