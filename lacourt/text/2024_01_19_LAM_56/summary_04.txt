And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has provisionally granted a motion filed by Robert Marc Hindin, the attorney for Defendant/Cross-Complainant Khalil Brian Zaghian, to be relieved as counsel. Hindin claims that there has been a complete breakdown in attorney/client communication, making it impossible for him to effectively represent Zaghian. The judge finds this to be an adequate basis for withdrawal and grants the motion, as it is unopposed. The judge notes that the decision is subject to change if Zaghian indicates that he needs a trial continuation to retain new representation. The moving party is ordered to give notice of this ruling, and parties who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the court as directed.
