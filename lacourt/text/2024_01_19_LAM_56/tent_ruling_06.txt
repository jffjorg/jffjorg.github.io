[1] The applicable version of CCP
section 340.1 requires plaintiffs over the age of 40 in actions seeking damages
for childhood sexual assault to execute certificates of merit at the time the
action is filed.  Plaintiffs did not file
certificates of merit at the time they filed the Complaint.  The Court notes that when the Complaint was
filed on December 30, 2022, Plaintiffs’ counsel contemporaneously filed a
declaration that references CCP section 340.1, subdivision (g)(3).  On February 28, 2023, Plaintiffs lodged
certificates of merit under CCP section 340.1, subdivision (g)(1)-(g)(2).
