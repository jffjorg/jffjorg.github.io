And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the moving defendants, Doe Archdiocese and Doe Seminary, and granted their motion to quash service of summons and dismiss the action. The moving defendants contend that the complaint and summons were not properly served, and since no opposition was filed, the plaintiffs have not satisfied their burden of demonstrating that service was proper. The judge finds that the procedural preconditions for establishing jurisdiction set forth in California Code of Civil Procedure section 340.1 were not met, and therefore, the court lacks personal jurisdiction over the moving defendants. The motion is granted, and the moving party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
