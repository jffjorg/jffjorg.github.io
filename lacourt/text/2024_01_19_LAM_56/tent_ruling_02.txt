MOVING PARTY: Plaintiff
 
RESPONDING PARTIES: (1) Defendants R&R
Remodeling, Inc and Rafael Adan Ayala; and (2) Defendants Christian Church
(Disciples of Christ) Pacific Southwest Region, McCarty Memorial Christian
Church, Branden Hendricks, Lorenzo Johnson, and Bruce Indermill (collectively,
“Defendants”) 
 
The Court has considered the moving,
opposition and reply papers. 
 
 
 
 
 
BACKGROUND
This action arises out of an employment
relationship.  This
action arises out of a landlord/tenant relationship.  The currently operative operative third
amended complaint (the “TAC”), filed on May 31, 2022, alleges: (1) trespass,
(2) negligence per se; and (3) negligence.[1]
 
            On December 21, 2023,
Plaintiff filed a motion for leave to file a “first amended pleading” (the
“Motion”).  
 
DISCUSSION
California Code
of Civil Procedure (“CCP”) section 473 permits the trial court
in its discretion to allow amendments to pleadings in the furtherance of justice.  (CCP § 473, subd. (a)(1).)  CCP section 576 provides that any judge, at
any time before or after commencement of trial, in the furtherance of justice,
and upon such terms as may be proper, may allow the amendment of any pleading
or pretrial conference order.  (CCP §
576.)  There is a policy of great
liberality in permitting amendments to the pleadings at any stage of the
proceeding.  (Berman v. Bromberg (1997)
56 Cal.App.4th 936, 945.)  An application
to amend a pleading is addressed to the trial judge’s sound discretion.  (Id.)  If the motion to amend is timely made and the
granting of the motion will not prejudice the opposing party, it is error to
refuse permission to amend and where the refusal also results in a party being
deprived of the right to assert a meritorious cause of action or a meritorious
defense, it is not only error but an abuse of discretion.  (Morgan v. Superior Court of Cal. In and
For Los Angeles County (1959) 172 Cal.App.2d 527, 530.)  Where no prejudice is shown to the adverse
party, the liberal rule of allowance prevails.  (Higgins v. Del Faro (1981) 123
Cal.App.3d 558, 564.)
 
Under California Rules of Court (“CRC”), rule
3.1324, a motion for leave to amend a pleading must be accompanied by a
declaration that sets forth: (1) the effect of the amendment; (2) why the
amendment is necessary and proper; (3) when the facts giving rise to the
amended allegations were discovered; and (4) the reasons why the request for
amendment was not made sooner.  (CRC, r.
3.1324(b).)
 
            The
Motion does not comply with the requirements of CRC, rule 3.1324.  The Motion appears to consist of a copy of
the proposed fourth amended complaint, which is an 87-page document alleging 26
causes of action.  Nor does the Motion
comply with the general requirements for motions (in either form or content)
articulated by CRC, rule 3.1113.  (See
CRC, r. 3.1113(a)-(d).)  The Court
therefore DENIES the Motion. 
 
 
            Moving party is ordered
to give notice of this ruling.
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
 
 
       Dated this 19th day of January 2024
