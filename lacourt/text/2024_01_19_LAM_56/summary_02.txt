Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the motion for leave to file an amended complaint filed by the plaintiff, Tamu Blackwell. The motion seeks to file a "first amended pleading" but does not comply with the requirements of California Rules of Court (CRC) rule 3.1324. The motion appears to consist of a copy of the proposed fourth amended complaint, which is an 87-page document alleging 26 causes of action. The Court denies the motion and orders the moving party to give notice of this ruling. The Court also notes that the motion does not comply with the general requirements for motions articulated by CRC rule 3.1113.
