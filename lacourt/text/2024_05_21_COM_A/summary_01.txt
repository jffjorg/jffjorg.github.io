And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

This tentative ruling grants Plaintiff's motion to file a first amended complaint. The Plaintiff seeks to add new claims for breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, accounting, and ouster. The Defendant argued that the proposed amended complaint changes the nature of the action from partition to one for contract-related claims, and that granting the motion would require a continuance of trial and cause prejudice to the Defendant. However, the Court finds that the proposed amended complaint does not result in prejudice to the Defendant, given the parties' stipulation to continue trial. Therefore, the motion is granted, and Plaintiff is ordered to file and serve the amended pleading forthwith.
