Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the anti-SLAPP motion to strike the second amended complaint (SAC) filed by the defendants, Law Office of T. Mae Yoshida, Rodney C. Pranin, and Long Beach Memorial Medical Center. The SAC alleges that the defendants conspired to avoid contract rates required by health insurance providers and asserted a lien against the plaintiff's personal injury settlement. The judge finds that the defendants have established that the SAC arises from protected activity under the anti-SLAPP statute. The judge also finds that the plaintiff has not met its burden of showing a probability of prevailing on the merits of the abuse of process claim. The judge concludes that the plaintiff's claim is barred by the litigation privilege and collateral estoppel. The judge grants the defendants' request for attorney's fees and takes the demurrer to the SAC off calendar as rendered moot by this ruling.
