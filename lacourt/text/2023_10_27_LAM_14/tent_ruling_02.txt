 Case Number:  19STCV43813    Hearing Date:   October 27, 2023    Dept:  14 Instant Motions
 
Plaintiff now moves this court, per
Code of Civil Procedure §§ 2030.290, 2031.300, and 2033.280 for orders: 
 
(1) compelling Defendants Helima and
Antoun to serve initial responses to Plaintiff’s Form and Special
Interrogatories, Set No. One, and Requests for Production, Set No. One, 
 
(2) deeming Plaintiff’s Requests for
Admissions Set No. One as admitted by Defendants  Helima and Antoun, and 
 
(3) awarding sanctions of $870 per
motion, amounting to a total of $3,480.00 from Defendant Helima and $3,480.00
from Defendant Antoun. 
 
Decision
 
The motions are DENIED as MOOT. Counsel
for Defendants Helima and Antoun represents that he has now served all the
responses sought. 
 
Defendant Helima is to pay
sanctions of $3,480.00 to Plaintiff’s counsel within 30 days. 
 
Defendant Antoun is to pay
sanctions of $3,480.00 to Plaintiff’s counsel within 30 days.
 
The court sets an OSC re: Dismissal
of Defendants Pacific Hardwood and DOES 2-25 for December 14, 2023 at 8:30 am.
 
Discussion
 
Code of Civil Procedure §§ 2030.290,
2031.300, and 2033.280 make the award of monetary sanctions mandatory. Defendants
have offered no substantial justification for their inability to serve
discovery responses in this case.
 
Additionally, every party who
brings a complaint has a time limit of three years from the date they initially
filed their pleading to identify and serve DOE defendants. Code of Civil
Procedure § 583.210(a); Inversiones Papaluchi S.A.S. v. Superior Court
(2018) 20 Cal.App.5th 1055, 1061. If a party fails to meet this
deadline, the court is obliged to dismiss those defendants “on its own motion”
and “after notice to the parties.” Code of Civil Procedure § 583.210(a).
 
Plaintiff’s initial pleading was
filed on December 5, 2019. Their deadline to identify and serve DOES passed on
December 5, 2022. Defendant Pacific Hardwood, and the remaining DOES, are
therefore subject to dismissal. Should Plaintiff elect to dismiss them rather
than file a response to the OSC, that hearing will be taken off-calendar.
