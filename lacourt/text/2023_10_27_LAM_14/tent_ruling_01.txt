  Case Number:  19STCV06025    Hearing Date:   October 27, 2023    Dept:  14 Instant Motion
 
Attorneys Keith Berglund (“Berglund”)
and Russell Miller now seek to be relieved as counsel of record for Plaintiff,
Alvin Brown. 
 
Decision
 
            The motion
is GRANTED, effective upon the filing
of the proof of service of the signed order upon the client. 
 
Governing Rule
 
            California
Rules of Court Rule 3.1362 requires that counsel fill out forms MC-051, MC-052,
and MC-053. These forms serve two basic functions: (1) ensuring that notice is
given to the client and (2) providing the court with an adequate explanation of
why the matter is being handled via motion rather than mutual consent. See Code
of Civil Procedure § 284; California Rules of Court Rule 3.1362.
 
Discussion
 
            Counsel Berglund
has completed the required forms. Those forms indicate that the client has been
served by mail at an address that was confirmed current within the past 30 days
by mail, return receipt requested. 
 
            Counsel Berglund
indicates that he and his firm wish to withdraw because there has been a
breakdown in the attorney-client relationship and because Plaintiff has failed
to pay his fees.
 
            Counsel has
complied with the requirements of Rule 3.1362, and relief is appropriate under
the circumstances of this case. The motion is GRANTED, effective upon the filing of the proof of service of the signed
order upon the client.
