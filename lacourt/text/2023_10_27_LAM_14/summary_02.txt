Here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling from the court regarding a motion filed by the plaintiff seeking to compel discovery responses from the defendants, Helima and Antoun, and to award sanctions. The motion is denied because the defendants have already served the discovery responses. However, the court finds that the defendant, Helima, must pay sanctions of $3,480.00 to the plaintiff's counsel within 30 days, and the defendant, Antoun, must pay the same amount. The court also sets a hearing to consider dismissing the defendants, Pacific Hardwood and the remaining Doe defendants, due to the plaintiff's failure to identify and serve them within the required timeframe.
