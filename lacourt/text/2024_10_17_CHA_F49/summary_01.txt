And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendant's motion to compel the plaintiff to appear and testify at deposition. The plaintiff failed to appear for a deposition on June 3, 2024, and did not serve written objections to the deposition notice. The defendant made multiple attempts to reschedule the deposition and resolve issues, but the plaintiff failed to respond or provide an explanation for her nonappearance.

The judge also grants the defendant's request for monetary sanctions in the amount of $2,475.00. The defendant's counsel incurred fees and costs due to the plaintiff's untimely notice of cancellation, including fees for Spanish interpreting service, certificate of non-appearance, process and compliance, and remote video conferencing.

The plaintiff is directed to attend and testify at a deposition, and produce documents as requested in the Second Amended Notice of Deposition, within 30 days of this order. The plaintiff and her attorney of record are ordered to jointly and severally pay the sanctions to the defendant's counsel.
