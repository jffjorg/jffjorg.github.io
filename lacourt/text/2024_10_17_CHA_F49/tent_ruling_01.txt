MOVING PARTY: Defendant American Honda Motor Co.,
Inc.
RESPONDING PARTY: None
NOTICE: OK.
 
RELIEF
REQUESTED: An
order from this Court to compel Plaintiff to appear and testify at deposition
and to produce documents, and to impose monetary sanctions against Plaintiff
and her counsel in the amount of $3,550.00.
 
TENTATIVE
RULING: The
motion is GRANTED. The Request for Monetary Sanctions is GRANTED IN PART. 
 
BACKGROUND
 
Plaintiff Ludivina Tovar (“Plaintiff” or “Tovar”) filed this
lawsuit under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act over alleged defects in
her 2022 Honda HR-V (the “Subject Vehicle”), which was manufactured by
Defendant American Honda Moto Co., Inc. (“Defendant” or “AHM”). Plaintiff
alleges that she purchased the Vehicle in new condition on February 28, 2022,
with AHM’s express manufacturer’s warranty.
 
On May 15, 2023, Plaintiff filed her Complaint against
Defendant AHM and Does 1–10, alleging the following causes of action: (1)
Violation of Song-Beverly Act – Breach of Express Warranty, and (2) Violation
of Song-Beverly Act – Breach of Implied Warranty. Subsequently, AHM filed its
Answer to the Complaint on June 21, 2023.
 
On July 10, 2024, AHM filed the
instant Motion to Compel Plaintiff to Appear and Testify at Deposition (the
“Motion”). Subsequently, on October 10, 2024, AHM filed a Notice of
Non-Opposition.
 
No Opposition papers have been
received by the Court. 
 
ANALYSIS
 
To compel the deposition of a
party to an action or its officer, director, managing agent, or employee, the
deposing party need only serve a notice in compliance with Code of Civil Procedure
section 2025.240. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.280, subd. (a).) Nothing further is
needed. If, after service of the deposition notice, the deponent fails to
appear “without having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410 . . .”
the deposing party may move for an order compelling the deponent’s attendance
and testimony. (Id., § 2025.450, subd. (a).)
 
A.   
Procedural
Requirements
 
1.     
Meet and Confer
 
"Implicit in the requirement
that counsel contact the deponent to inquire about the nonappearance is a
requirement that counsel listen to the reasons offered and make a good faith
attempt to resolve the issue," including by rescheduling.¿(Leko v.
Cornerstone Bldg. Inspection Serv. (2001) 86 Cal. App. 4th 1109, 1124.) 
 
Here, on June 21, 2023, AHM
served notice of Plaintiff’s deposition for July 26, 2023; however, due to the nonappearance
by Plaintiff and her counsel, AHM took a Certificate of Non-Appearance on July
26, 2023. (Hernandez Decl. ¶ 5.) Between January 19 and February 2, 2024, AHM made multiple
requests to Plaintiff’s counsel to provide dates for Plaintiff’s deposition. (Id.
¶¶ 6-12.) Plaintiff’s counsel responded with available dates on February
2, 2024. (Id. ¶ 13.)
 
Subsequently, on February 6,
2024, AHM served a First Amended Notice of Deposition for a deposition on June
4, 2024. (Hernandez Decl. ¶ 14.)
 
Following this, upon the
parties’ agreement, on May 8, 2024, AHM served Plaintiff with the operative Second
Amended Notice of Taking the Deposition and Request for Production of Documents
and Things for a deposition on June 3, 2024. (Hernandez Decl. ¶ 16.)
Subsequently, on May 16, 2024, Plaintiff responded and stated that she will
appear for deposition as notice. Additionally, Plaintiff stated that she would
require a Spanish interpreter for the deposition. (Id. ¶ 17.)  On May 31, 2024, at 4:15 p.m., Plaintiff’s
counsel sent correspondence to AHM’s counsel, informing that Plaintiff will not
be able to proceed with her deposition on Monday. (Id. ¶ 18.) Plaintiff
and her counsel did not appear for the deposition on June 3, 2023 (sic), AHM
took another Certificate of Non-Appearance. (Id. ¶ 19.)
 
On July 3, 2024, AHM
attempted to request Plaintiff to propose dates for her deposition. However, by
the filing of the Motion, no responses have been received from Plaintiff.
(Hernandez Decl. ¶¶ 21-22.)
 
Based on the above records,
the Court finds that AHM has made good faith attempts to reschedule and resolve
issues raised in the instant Motion while Plaintiff has failed to respond or
provide an explanation of her nonappearance at the June 3, 2024 deposition.
(See Hernandez Decl. Ex. “K.”)
 
B.    
Motion to
Compel Deposition of Plaintiff 
 
Code of Civil Procedure section
2025.280 subdivision (a) provides that service of a deposition notice “is
effective to require any deponent who is a party to the action [] to attend and
to testify, as well as to produce any document, electronically stored
information, or tangible thing for inspection and copying.”
 
An
objection under Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.410 is one that is
written, made “at least three calendar days prior to the date for which the
deposition is scheduled,” and pertains to an “error or irregularity” with the
notice itself. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.410, subd. (a).) The procedure for a
deponent who seeks to narrow the scope of a discovery request is to move for a
protective order. (Id., § 2025.420, subd. (a).)
 
Objections
do not stay the taking of the deposition. To do so, the objecting party
should move to quash the deposition notice and stay the taking of the
deposition. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.410 (c), [“In addition to serving this
written objection, a party may also move for an order staying the taking of the
deposition and quashing the deposition notice. The motion shall be accompanied
by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040. The taking of the
deposition is stayed pending the determination of this motion.”])
 
Here, Plaintiff and her counsel failed to appear for her
noticed deposition on June 3, 2024, and did not serve written objections to the
operative Notice of Deposition. (Hernandez Decl. ¶¶ 4-5.) 
 
Accordingly, AHM is entitled to the deposition of Plaintiff
upon serving her the Second Amended Deposition Notice. 
 
Therefore, the Court GRANTS the Motion.
 
C.   
Monetary
Sanctions
 
If
a motion to compel a party deponent to appear for a deposition is granted, the
court must impose a monetary sanction "in favor of the party who noticed
the deposition and against the deponent . . . unless the court finds that the
one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust." (Code Civ
Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (g)(1).)
 
Given
that the Court has granted the Motion, it finds the mandatory sanctions under
Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.450, subdivision (g) applicable. 
 
Here,
AHM’s counsel attest that due to Plaintiff’s untimely notice of cancellation,
it incurred a total fee of $1,950.00, including $1,050.00 for Spanish
interpreting service, $675.00 for certificate of non-appearance, $75.00 for
process and compliance, and $150.00 for remote video conferencing. (Hernandez
Decl. Ex. “M.”)
 
Utilizing
a lodestar approach, and in view of the totality of the circumstances, the
Court finds that the total and reasonable amount of attorney’s fees and costs
incurred are $2,475.00, calculated at a reasonable hourly rate of $350.00 for 1.5
hours reasonably spent, plus $1,950.00 in additional incurred fees.
 
CONCLUSION
 
The
Court hereby GRANTS Defendant American Honda Motor Co., Inc.’s unopposed Motion
to Compel Plaintiff Ludivina Tovar to Appear and Testify at
Deposition.
 
Plaintiff Ludivina Tovar is directed to
attend and testify at a deposition, and produce documents as requested in the
Second Amended Notice of Deposition, dated May 8, 2024, within 30 days of this
order. 
 
The
Court GRANTS IN PART Defendant American Honda
Motor Co., Inc.’s Request for
Monetary Sanctions.
 
Plaintiff Ludivina Tovar and her attorney of record are ordered
to jointly and severally pay $2,475.00 in sanctions to Defendant American Honda Motor Co., Inc.’s counsel.
