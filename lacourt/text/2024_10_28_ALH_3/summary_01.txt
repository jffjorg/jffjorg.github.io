And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the plaintiff's motion to strike the defendant's answer is granted. The defendant failed to appear at a hearing on the motion and did not provide proof of service of an order relieving defense counsel. The plaintiff's counsel suggested that the defendant be given notice of the court's ruling and file an ex parte application with a revised order, which was granted. The defendant's notice of ruling did not include the updated hearing date, and the plaintiff subsequently filed a proof of service showing that the revised order was served on the defendant. Since the defendant did not oppose the motion to strike, the court has granted the motion. The court will adopt the tentative ruling as the final order unless the parties submit otherwise.
