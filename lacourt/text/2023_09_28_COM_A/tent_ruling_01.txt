 Jessica Figueroa, et al v. David Ahdoot

[TENTATIVE]
ORDER CONDITIONALLY
 GRANTING PETITIONS FOR APPROVAL OF MINORS’ COMPROMISE OF CLAIMS 
 
      This
action involves injuries sustained by two adults and three minor claimants, allegedly
caused by uninhabitable conditions in residential real property owned by
Defendant. Plaintiff’s counsel corrected the allocation of the global
settlement to reflect that Erica’s gross settlement is $10,000.



Jessica
  Figueroa and Daniel Pololizzio (adults)


$280,000




Erica
  Hernandez (age 17)


10,000




Evelyn
  Hernandez (age 15)


5,000




Jesselle
  Hernandez (age 12)


5,000



 
      A
minor’s settlement is valid if approved by the court after a hearing.  (Prob. Code, §§3505, 3500.) Petitioner has allocated a larger portion of the settlement to
the adult Plaintiffs who suffered economic damages arising from the conditions.
Petitioner also allocated a larger portion of the settlement among the claimants
to Erica because she suffered more substantial injuries. 
      The
Court previously continued the hearing to permit Petitioner to submit medical
reports documenting each claimant’s current condition. (Petition, Item 8.)
Instead of medical reports, Plaintiff’s counsel submitted the verified
interrogatory responses to substantiate a larger allocation of the funds to
Erica. Erica states her residual injuries included an occasional migraine and
mild depression for which she underwent psychological treatment. (Decl. of Dorenfeld filed 9/21/23, Ex. A .pdf page 1-3.) 
      Counsel
contends that attorney’s fees and costs will be deducted from the adult
Plaintiffs’ settlement resulting in deposits of each Claimant’s gross
settlement into separate blocked accounts of $5,000 each for Evelyn and Jeselle
and $10,000 for Erica. 
      Given
the relatively minor injuries sustained by Claimants and their assertion that
they have fully recovered from their injuries, the Court will hear from the Guardian
ad Litem regarding the Claimants’ current medical condition.
