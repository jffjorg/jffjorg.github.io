This is a tentative ruling by the Court regarding the petition for approval of the compromise of claims by the minor claimants. The case involves injuries sustained by two adults and three minor claimants, allegedly caused by uninhabitable conditions in a residential real property owned by the Defendant. The Court has previously continued the hearing to permit the submission of medical reports documenting each claimant's current condition. Instead of medical reports, the Plaintiff's counsel submitted verified interrogatory responses to substantiate a larger allocation of the funds to Erica, one of the minor claimants. The Court will hear from the Guardian ad Litem regarding the Claimants' current medical condition, as the relatively minor injuries sustained by the Claimants and their assertion that they have fully recovered from their injuries raise concerns about the allocation of the settlement funds.

## English-Text Summary

The judge is considering a request to approve settlements for three minor children who were injured, along with two adult plaintiffs. The injuries allegedly stemmed from uninhabitable conditions in a property owned by the defendant. 

The plaintiffs' attorney originally allocated a portion of the settlement funds. However, the judge requested medical reports to support the allocation, particularly for one of the minor claimants (Erica Hernandez) who allegedly suffered more substantial injuries.  Instead of medical reports, the attorney submitted verified interrogatory responses. 

The judge will hear from the Guardian ad Litem, who represents the best interests of the minor claimants, to get more information about their current medical condition before making a final decision on approving the settlements.

The judge has approved the allocation of the global settlement, which includes a larger portion allocated to the adult claimants who suffered economic damages and to Erica, who suffered more substantial injuries. The judge has also ordered that the settlement funds be deposited into separate blocked accounts for each claimant, with attorney's fees and costs to be deducted from the adult claimants' settlement. The judge has scheduled a hearing to permit the Guardian ad Litem to provide information on the claimants' current medical condition, as the claimants have asserted that they have fully recovered from their injuries.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling conditionally granting the petitions for approval of minors' compromise of claims in the case of Jessica Figueroa et al. v. David Ahdoot. The case involves injuries sustained by two adults and three minor claimants due to uninhabitable conditions in a residential real property owned by the defendant. The plaintiffs have allocated a global settlement of $280,000, with the adult plaintiffs receiving a larger portion due to economic damages. The minor claimants, Erica, Evelyn, and Jesselle Hernandez, will receive $10,000, $5,000, and $5,000, respectively. The court has previously continued the hearing to permit the petitioner to submit medical reports documenting each claimant's current condition. Instead, the petitioner submitted verified interrogatory responses, which include statements from Erica about her residual injuries, including occasional migraines and mild depression. The court will hear from the Guardian ad Litem regarding the claimants' current medical condition before making a final decision.
