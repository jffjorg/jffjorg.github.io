And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by the Court regarding the petition for approval of the compromise of claims by the minor claimants. The case involves injuries sustained by two adults and three minor claimants, allegedly caused by uninhabitable conditions in a residential real property owned by the Defendant. The Court has previously continued the hearing to permit the submission of medical reports documenting each claimant's current condition. Instead of medical reports, the Plaintiff's counsel submitted verified interrogatory responses to substantiate a larger allocation of the funds to Erica, one of the minor claimants. The Court will hear from the Guardian ad Litem regarding the Claimants' current medical condition, as the relatively minor injuries sustained by the Claimants and their assertion that they have fully recovered from their injuries raise concerns about the allocation of the settlement funds.
