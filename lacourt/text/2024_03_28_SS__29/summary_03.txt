Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Defendant's motion to deem admitted the truth of the matters specified in Defendant's Requests for Admission (Set One). The motion was filed after Defendant served Plaintiff with the requests on January 12, 2024, and Plaintiff failed to respond. The judge found that Plaintiff's failure to respond waived all objections and that Defendant need not show anything more to support the motion. The judge also granted Defendant's request for monetary sanctions in the amount of $522.50, which is calculated based on 2.5 hours of attorney work and a $60 filing fee. The judge ordered Plaintiff to pay the sanctions within 30 days of notice. The judge's ruling does not specify any further action or consequences for Plaintiff's failure to respond to the requests.
