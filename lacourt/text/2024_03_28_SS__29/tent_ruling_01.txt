Examination of Plaintiff 
 
Tentative
The motion is granted.
The request for sanctions is denied.
Background
On January
7, 2020, Christian Argueta (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Roman
Smbatyan, Smbat Smbatyan, Leanna Furtado, and Does 1 through 50 for negligence
arising from an automobile accident occurring on January 9, 2018.
Defendants
Roman Smbatyan and Smbat Smbatyan (collectively “Defendants”) filed their
answers on August 11 and October 25, 2021.
On November
22, 2022, Defendants served a demand for a physical examination of Plaintiff
for February 6, 2023. (Reed Decl., ¶ 5.) 
Plaintiff did not respond to the demand, object, or appear.  (Id., ¶ 6.)  On February 8, 2023, Defendant served a
second demand for a physical examination of Plaintiff, this one set for March
23.  (Id., ¶ 7.) Plaintiff timely
responded and objected to the date.  (Id.,
¶ 8.)  Following unsuccessful efforts to
communicate with Plaintiff to select a mutually available date, Defendants
served a third demand for a physical examination of Plaintiff, this one set for
May 15, 2023.  (Id., ¶¶ 9-11.)  Plaintiff did not respond to the demand,
object, or appear.  (Id., ¶ 12.)  
On July
5, 2023, Defendants filed this motion to compel the physical examination of
Plaintiff.  Defendants also seek sanctions.
No
opposition has been filed. 
Legal Standard
Code of Civil Procedure section 2032.220 provides,
in pertinent part:
(a)  In any case in which a plaintiff is seeking recovery for personal
injuries, any defendant may demand one physical examination of the plaintiff,
if both of the following conditions are satisfied:
 
(1)  The examination does not include any diagnostic test or procedure that is
painful, protracted, or intrusive.
(2)  The examination is conducted at a location within 75 miles of the
residence of the examinee.
 
(b)  A defendant may make a demand under this article without leave of court
….
 
(c)  
A demand under
subdivision (a) shall specify the time, place, manner, conditions, scope, and
nature of the examination, as well as the identity and the specialty, if any,
of the physician who will perform the examination.
 
(d)  A physical examination demanded under subdivision (a) shall be scheduled
for a date that is at least 30 days after service of the demand ….
 
Within 20 days of service of a demand for a physical
examination, the plaintiff to whom the demand is directed must respond in
writing and state that the plaintiff “will comply with the demand as stated,
will comply with the demand as specifically modified by the plaintiff, or will
refuse, for reasons specified in the response, to submit to the demanded
physical examination.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2032.230, subd. (a).)  Failure to serve
a timely response waives any objection to the demand.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2032.240, subd. (a).)
If a plaintiff fails to comply, the defendant may
move for an order compelling plaintiff to appear at and submit to a physical
examination. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2032.240, subd. (b), and § 2032.250, subd.
(a).)  The motion “shall be accompanied
by a meet and confer declaration.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2032.250, subd. (a).)
“The court shall impose
a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against
any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to
compel compliance with a demand for a physical examination, unless it finds
that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or
that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2032.250, subd. (b).)
In
Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery Act, section 2023.010, subdivision (d),
defines “[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to respond
to or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.”  Where a party or attorney has engaged in
misuse of the discovery process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in
the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by
anyone as a result of that conduct.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (a).) 
Discussion
Defendants
served demands for physical examinations of Plaintiff scheduled for February 6
and March 23, 2023, but Plaintiff did not appear. (Reed Decl., ¶¶ 5-8.)  After efforts to communicate with Plaintiff’s
counsel to select a mutually available date, Defendants served a third demand
for a physical examination of Plaintiff, this one scheduled for May 15,
2023.  (Id., ¶¶ 9-11.)  Plaintiff did not respond to the demand,
object, or appear.  (Id., ¶ 12.)
Defendants
do not need to show anything more.  Their
motion to compel Plaintiff to appear for a physical examination is GRANTED.
Defendants’
request for sanctions is denied.  Under the
applicable code section, Code of Civil Procedure section 2032.250, subdivision
(b), the court is authorized to impose a sanction “against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel compliance with a demand for
a physical examination.”  Here, however,
Plaintiff has not opposed the motion.
Conclusion
The Court
GRANTS Defendants’ motion.
The
Court ORDERS Plaintiff to appear for and submit to a physical examination by
Philip S. Yuan, M.D., an orthopedic surgeon, at 2760 Atlantic Avenue, Long
Beach, California 90806 on _____________________, 2024, at ________ am/pm.
The
Court DENIES Defendants’ request for sanctions. 
Moving
Party is ORDERED to give notice.
