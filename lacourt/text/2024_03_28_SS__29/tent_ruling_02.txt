for Production (Set One)
Defendant’s Motion to Compel Plaintiff’s Responses to Requests for Production (Set
Two)
 
Tentative
The motions to compel are granted.
The request for sanctions are granted in
part.
Background
On December 28, 2020, Micael Nystrom
(“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Margaret E. Davis (“Defendant”) and
Does 1 through 50 asserting one cause of action for motor vehicle negligence
arising out of an accident on December 28, 2018, near the intersection of
Ventura Boulevard and Sepulveda Boulevard in Sherman Oaks.  Defendant filed her answer on March 14, 2022.
On May 3, 2022, Defendant served Plaintiff
with discovery, including Requests for Production (Set One). (First Castronovo
Decl., ¶ 4 & Exh. A.) 
On July 19, 2022, Plaintiff served objections
and unverified responses. (Id., ¶ 6; Exh. B.) Approximately 18 months
later, Defendant followed up with Plaintiff, but no verifications were
provided.  (Id., ¶¶ 7-8.)
On November 16, 2023, Defendant served
Plaintiff with Requests for Production (Set Two).  (Second Castronovo Decl., ¶ 4 & Exh. A.) 
On January 5, 2024, Plaintiff served objections
and unverified responses. (Id., ¶ 5; Exh. B.) Defendant followed up with
Plaintiff, but no verifications were provided. 
(Id., ¶¶ 6-7.)
On February 7, 2024, Defendant filed these two motions: to
compel Plaintiff’s verified responses to Requests for Production (Set One) and to
compel Plaintiff’s verified responses to Requests for Production (Set Two).  Defendant also seeks sanctions.  Plaintiff filed an opposition on March 15,
2024, limited to the issue of sanctions against counsel. 
Legal Standard
A party must respond to requests for production of
documents within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260,
subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for production of documents are directed
does not provide timely responses, the requesting party may move for an order
compelling response to the demand. (Id., § 2031.300, subd. (b).) There
is no time limit for a motion to compel initial responses, and no meet and
confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare
Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th
390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who
fails to provide a timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).) 
When a party moves to compel initial responses to
requests for production, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the motion], unless it finds that
the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that
other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd.
(c).)
“On receipt of a response to a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling, the demanding party may move for an order compelling
further response to the demand if the demanding party deems that any of the
following apply: (1) A statement of compliance with the demand is
incomplete.  (2) A representation of
inability to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive.  (3) An objection in the response is without
merit or too general.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.310, subd. (a).)
Notice of a motion to compel further responses must be given
“within 45 days of the service of the verified response, or any supplemental
verified response, or on or before any specific later date to which the
propounding party and the responding party have agreed in writing.” (Id.,
subd. (c).)
A motion to compel further responses must set forth specific
facts showing good cause for the discovery and must be accompanied by a meet-and-confer
declaration and a separate statement or, in the discretion of the Court, a
“concise outline of the discovery request and each response in dispute.” (Id.,
subd. (b)(1)-(3); Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345.)
“[T]he court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel further response to a
demand, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.310, subd. (h).)
In
Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010,
subdivision (d), defines “[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include
“[f]ailing to respond to or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.”  Where a party or attorney has engaged in
misuse of the discovery process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in
the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by
anyone as a result of that conduct.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.020, subd. (a).)
Discussion
On May 3, 2022, Defendant served Plaintiff
with Requests for Production (Set One). (First Castronovo Decl., ¶ 4 & Exh.
A.) On November 16, 2023, Defendant served Plaintiff with Requests for
Production (Set Two).  (Second Castronovo
Decl., ¶ 4 & Exh. A.)
Plaintiff responded with objections and
unverified responses.  (First Castronovo
Decl., ¶ 6 & Exh. B; Second Castronovo Decl., ¶ 5; Exh. B.) 
Defendant now moves to compel.  The motions are in a sense a hybrid between motions
to compel initial responses and motions to compel further responses.  Substantive responses to requests for
production must be verified.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.250, subd. (a).)  An
unverified response is the equivalent of no response at all.  (See Appleton v. Super. Ct. (1988) 206
Cal.App.3d 632, 636.) Objections need not be verified by the party (a signature
by counsel is sufficient).  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.250, subds. (a), (c).)  
There is no time limit on a motion to compel
initial responses.  There is a 45-day
time limit on motions to compel further responses, but where, as here, there
are both objections and unverified substantive responses, the 45-day time
period does not begin to run until the verification of the responses is
served.  (See Golf & Tennis Pro
Shop, Inc. v. Super. Ct. (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 127, 136-137.)  That has not occurred here.  Thus, whether construed as motions to compel
initial responses or further responses, the motions are timely.
Defendant’s
motions are also meritorious. 
Plaintiff’s objections are overruled, Plaintiff has failed to provide a
verified response to the requests for production, and Defendant has shown good
cause.  Accordingly, Defendant’s motions
are GRANTED.
Defendant’s
request for sanctions is also GRANTED in part. 
Given the relatively straightforward nature of a
motion to compel initial responses, and the economies of scale associated with
filing multiple discovery motions (additional motions are scheduled for hearing
on other days this week), the Court sets sanctions on each motion in the amount
of $360.00, calculated based on 1.5 hours of attorney work, multiplied by
counsel’s billing rate of $200 per hour, plus a $60 filing fee.  (See Castronovo Decls., ¶¶ 10, 11.)
No sanctions are awarded against
Plaintiff’s counsel.
Conclusion
The Court GRANTS Defendant’s motions to compel
Plaintiff’s responses to requests for production.
The Court ORDERS
Plaintiff to serve verified, written, code compliant responses, without
objection, to Defendant’s Requests for Production (Set One), within 30 days of notice.
The Court ORDERS
Plaintiff to serve verified, written, code compliant responses, without
objection, to Defendant’s Requests for Production (Set Two), within 30 days of notice.
The Court ORDERS
Plaintiff to pay monetary sanctions to Defendant under the Civil Discovery Act
in the amount of $720 within 30 days of notice.
Moving
party is ORDERED to give notice.
