Matters Specified in Requests for Admission
 
Tentative

Background
This
cases arises out of a vehicle accident on September 19, 2021, on the I-10

On February 1, 2022, Plaintiff Devon Baylor (“Plaintiff”) filed a
complaint against Defendants Los Angeles Community Hospital, Alta Los Angeles
Hospitals, Inc., John Doe 1, John Doe 2, and Does 1 through 50, asserting causes
of action for motor vehicle negligence and general negligence.
On April
11, 2022, Defendant Alta Los Angeles Hospitals, Inc. (“Defendant”) filed its answer.
On April
13, 2022, Plaintiff amended the complaint to name Marlon R. Mejia Paz as John
Doe 1.
On
October 12, 2022, the Court granted the motion of Plaintiff’s attorney to be
relieved as counsel.
On January 12, 2024, Defendant served Plaintiff with Requests
for Admission (Set One).  (Bauerlein
Decl., ¶ 2 & Exh. A.)  The discovery
was served by mail.  (Id., Exh.
A.)  Plaintiff did not request an
extension or serve responses.  (Id.,
¶¶ 3-4.)
 
On March 1, 2024, Defendant filed this motion for an
order deeming admitted the truth of the matters specified in the Requests for
Admissions.  Defendant also seeks
monetary sanctions.  The motion was
served by mail.
 
No opposition has been filed. 
 
Legal Standard
 
A party must
respond to requests for admission within 30 days after service. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.250, subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for admission are directed
does not provide a timely response, the propounding party “may move for an
order that … the truth of [the] matters specified in the requests be deemed
admitted.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).) There is no time
limit for such a motion, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id.,
§ 2033.280; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement
be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who fails to provide a
timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (a).) 
The court “shall”
make the order that the truth of the matters specified in the request be deemed
admitted unless the court “finds that the party to whom the requests for
admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a
proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial
compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c); see St. Mary v. Super. Ct. (2014)
223 Cal.App.4th 762, 778-780.)
“It is mandatory
that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a
timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion [to deem
admitted the truth of the matters specified in the requests for admission].”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd.
(c).)
In Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery Act, Code of Civil
Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision (d), defines “[m]isuses of the
discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to respond to or to submit to an
authorized method of discovery.”  Where a
party or attorney has engaged in misuse of the discovery process, the court may
impose a monetary sanction in the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including
attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd.
(a).)
“The court may award sanctions
under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel
discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to
the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving
party after the motion was filed.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1348(a).) 
Discussion
Defendant served Plaintiff with Requests for Admission
(Set One) on January 12, 2024. 
(Bauerlein Decl., ¶ 2 & Exh. A.) 
Plaintiff did not respond. (Id., ¶¶ 3-4.)
 
Defendant need not show anything more.  The motion is GRANTED.
Defendant’s requests for sanctions
are GRANTED in part and DENIED in part. Given the relatively straightforward
nature of a motion to deem admitted the truth of the matters specified in
requests for admission, the Court sets sanctions in the amount of $522.50,
calculated based on 2.5 hours of attorney work, multiplied by counsel’s reasonable
billing rate of $185 per hour, plus a $60 filing fee.  (See Bauerlein Decl., ¶ 5.)
Conclusion
The Court’s GRANTS Defendant’s motion.
The Court ORDERS that Plaintiff is deemed to have admitted the
truth of the matters specified in Defendant’s Requests for Admission (Set One).

The Court ORDERS Plaintiff to pay monetary sanctions under the
Civil Discovery Act to Defendant in the amount of $522.50 within 30 days of
notice.
Moving party is ORDERED to give notice.
