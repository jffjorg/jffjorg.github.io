```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion to stay discovery pending the resolution of an ongoing criminal investigation involving the plaintiff. The defendants had argued that the investigation was still ongoing and that disclosure of the relevant information would compromise it, citing the "official information" doctrine in Evidence Code § 1040. However, the judge found that the defendants had not made a sufficient showing to justify a stay of discovery, and that the interests of the plaintiff in pursuing the civil action outweighed the defendants' interest in keeping the information confidential.

The judge has also granted the plaintiff's motion to compel responses to certain interrogatories and requests for production of documents. The defendants had failed to provide complete and adequate responses to the interrogatories, and the judge found that they had not made a good faith effort to obtain the information. The judge ordered the defendants to provide further responses to the interrogatories and to comply with the requests for production of documents.

Finally, the judge denied the plaintiff's motion for sanctions against the defendants, finding that the defendants had not acted in bad faith in their responses to the interrogatories and requests for production of documents.
