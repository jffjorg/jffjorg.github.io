The tentative ruling grants Defendant JOVA BOVADILLATENTATIVE's motion to file a cross-complaint against third-party Lordon Management. The cross-complaint seeks indemnity, apportionment of fault, and declaratory relief. The Court finds that the cross-complaint is compulsory because it arises out of the same occurrence as the main action, a vehicle collision. The Court grants the motion because there is no opposition showing that Defendant acted in bad faith. The cross-complaint is ordered to be filed within 10 days of this order.
