And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has denied Plaintiff's motion for reconsideration of the court's March 6, 2024 ruling. The court found that the motion was untimely, as it was filed more than 10 days after the ruling. Additionally, the court noted that Plaintiff failed to provide notice of the relief sought, which is a requirement under Code of Civil Procedure Section 1008(a). The court also found that the motion was not properly filed, as it did not include a memorandum of points and authorities or a declaration setting forth facts supporting the amount of any monetary sanction sought. Finally, the court noted that Plaintiff's argument regarding Dhatt's subsequent failure to provide proper verifications was moot, as Dhatt had already admitted the requests for admissions.
