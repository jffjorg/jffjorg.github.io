And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court grants the plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal of the action. The action was dismissed on December 12, 2023, due to the plaintiff's counsel's mistake, inadvertence, or neglect in failing to file proof of service of summons and complaint within two years. The court finds that the plaintiff's counsel has sufficiently established mistake, inadvertence, or neglect in supervising the work of his staff, and the dismissal must be set aside. The court schedules an OSC re sanctions in the amount of $250 for the plaintiff's failure to file proof of service and complaint within two years. The court also orders all responsive paperwork to be filed at least five days prior to the next court date.
