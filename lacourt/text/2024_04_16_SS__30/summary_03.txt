And here is the English summary:

The tentative ruling sustains Defendant Steve Patterson's demurrer without leave to amend. The complaint alleges that Defendant failed to board up or cover trenches created by construction workers on his property, causing Plaintiff DANA GANT to fall and injure her right knee on May 20, 2020. Defendant argues that the complaint fails to state a cause of action because it is barred by the two-year statute of limitations. The Court finds that Plaintiff knew of Defendant's identity at the time of the filing of the original complaint and that the amended complaint does not relate back to the filing of the complaint. As a result, the complaint is deemed barred by the statute of limitations. The Court also denies Plaintiff's request for leave to amend the complaint.
