And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Justina Antoon, has filed a motion to strike punitive damages from the plaintiff, Drew Albo's, complaint. The defendant argues that punitive damages cannot be recovered for negligent conduct and that the plaintiff's complaint lacks sufficient allegations to support the claim for punitive damages. The court agrees with the defendant and grants the motion to strike. However, since this is the initial complaint and the defect is one of specificity in pleading, the court grants the plaintiff leave to amend. The plaintiff has 21 days to file an amended complaint.
