And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is granting the defendant's motion to set aside the default and default judgment. The defendant, City of Los Angeles, filed the motion after realizing its mistake in not responding to the complaint and subsequently entering a default. The judge finds that the defendant has shown an adequate basis for relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b) and has acted promptly in seeking to set aside the default. The judge is not required to reach the defendant's request to set aside the default under section 473.5. The default entered on October 5, 2023, is set aside, and the defendant is granted leave to defend the action.
