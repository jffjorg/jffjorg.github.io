Legal Standard
The Civil Discovery
Act authorizes discovery in the form of a physical or mental examination of a
party whose physical or mental condition is in controversy in the action. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2032.020, subd. (a).)  Code
of Civil Procedure section 2032.220 provides, in pertinent part:
(a)  In any case in which a plaintiff is seeking recovery for personal
injuries, any defendant may demand one physical examination of the plaintiff,
if both of the following conditions are satisfied:
 
(1)  The examination does not include any diagnostic test or procedure that is
painful, protracted, or intrusive.
 
(2)  The examination is conducted at a location within 75 miles of the
residence of the examinee.
 
(b)  A defendant may make a demand under this article without leave of court
….
 
(c)  
A demand under
subdivision (a) shall specify the time, place, manner, conditions, scope, and
nature of the examination, as well as the identity and the specialty, if any,
of the physician who will perform the examination.
 
(d)  A physical examination demanded under subdivision (a) shall be scheduled
for a date that is at least 30 days after service of the demand ….
Within 20 days of service of a demand for a physical
examination, the plaintiff to whom the demand is directed must respond in
writing and state that the plaintiff “will comply with the demand as stated,
will comply with the demand as specifically modified by the plaintiff, or will
refuse, for reasons specified in the response, to submit to the demanded
physical examination.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2032.230, subd. (a).)  Failure to serve
a timely response waives any objection to the demand.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2032.240, subd. (a).)
If a plaintiff fails to comply, the defendant may
move for an order compelling plaintiff to appear at and submit to a physical
examination. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2032.240, subd. (b), and § 2032.250, subd.
(a).)  The motion “shall be accompanied
by a meet and confer declaration.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2032.250, subd. (a).)
“The court shall impose a monetary sanction
under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person,
or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel compliance
with a demand for a physical examination, unless it finds that the one subject
to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2032.250, subd. (b).)
In
Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery Act, section 2023.010, subdivision (d),
defines “[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to respond
to or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.”  Where a party or attorney has engaged in
misuse of the discovery process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in
the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by
anyone as a result of that conduct.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (a).) 
Discussion
Plaintiff
in this action seeks recovery for physical injuries allegedly sustained in a motor
vehicle accident.  (Complaint, ¶¶ 9-12.)  Defendant twice served demands for a physical
examination of Plaintiff.  (Young Decl.,
¶ 3 & Exhs. A, H.) Plaintiff did not appear. (Id., ¶ 3.) Most
recently, Defendant set the examination for November 17, 2023; Plaintiff
initially confirmed her availability but then cancelled the evening before the
examination. (Id., ¶ 3 & Exhs. G, I.) 
Plaintiff
did not serve any timely response or objection to the examination demands.
Defendant
has made a sufficient showing for the requested relief.  Defendant served a proper demand for a
physical examination, and Plaintiff (without objecting) failed to comply. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2032.240, subd. (b), and § 2032.250, subd. (a).)  Moreover, Defendant submitted, with the
moving papers, a meet and confer declaration in compliance with the statutory
requirement. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2032.250, subd. (a).)
Accordingly,
Defendant’s motion to compel is GRANTED.
The
Court also GRANTS Defendant’s request for $762.65 in monetary sanctions.  Defendant has shown that as a result of Plaintiff’s
failure to submit to the properly noticed physical examination, Defendant has incurred
expenses, including a $700 late cancellation fee and a filing fee of
$62.65.  (Young Decl., ¶ 5 & Exh. L.)  
Conclusion
The Court
GRANTS Defendant’s motion to compel the physical examination of Plaintiff. 
The
Court ORDERS Plaintiff to appear for a physical examination with Daniel Kaplan,
M.D., on March 5, 2024, at 11:30 a.m. at 12400 Bloomfield Ave., 2nd
Floor, Santa Fe Springs, CA 90670.
The
Court GRANTS Defendant’s request for sanctions.
The
Court ORDERS Plaintiff to pay monetary sanctions under the Civil Discovery Act
in the amount of $762.65 within 30 days of notice.
Moving
Party is ORDERED to give notice.
