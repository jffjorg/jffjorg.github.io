I. BACKGROUND¿¿ 
¿¿ 
A. Factual¿¿ 
On May 9, 2024, Plaintiff, Marsha Caree Michael (“Plaintiff”)
filed a complaint against Defendants, Lyft, Inc., Yan Zhang, Airport Automotive
Center, Manuel Flores, and DOES 1 through 50. The complaint alleges causes of
action for: (1) Negligence; (2) Negligent Hiring,
Retention, Training, and Supervision; and (3) Negligent Entrustment. 
 
On July 9, 2024,
Cross-Complainant, Yan Zhang filed a cross-complaint against Cross-Defendant,
Manuel Flores, and ROES 1 through 30. The cross-complaint alleges causes of
action for: (1) Motor Vehicle Negligence; (2) Equitable Indemnity; (3)
Comparative Contribution; (4) Apportionment of Fault; and (5) Declaratory
Relief. 
 
On June 19, 2024, Defendant/Cross-Complainant, Yan Zhang
(“Zhang”) served Form Interrogatories, Set One, Special Interrogatories, Set
One, Requests for Production of Documents, Set One, and Requests for Admission,
Set One on Plaintiff, Marsha Caree Michael. Plaintiff’s responses were due on
July 23, 2024. On July 19, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel emailed Zhang’s counsel
that they required more time. Zhang granted an extension to August 13, 2024.
Zhang then provided a second extension to Plaintiff corresponding to a deadline
of August 23, 2024. On August 23, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel requested a third
extension to provide responses, which was granted, imposing a new deadline of
August 27, 2024. However, as of the date Zhang filed these motions, Zhang
states that Plaintiff has not served responses to any of the propounded
discovery despite sending two follow up emails past the August 27, 2024
deadline to remind Plaintiff’s counsel of the deadline. 
 
As such, Zhang has
filed Motions to Compel Plaintiff’s initial responses to Form Interrogatories,
Set One, Special Interrogatories, Set
One, Requests for Production of Documents, Set One, as well as Motion to Deem
Requests for Admission as Admitted.  
 
B. Procedural¿¿ 
            On September 30, 2024, Defendant Zhang filed Motions to
Compel Form Interrogatories, Set One, Special Interrogatories, Set One,
Requests for Production of Documents, Set One, and Motion to Deem Requests for
Admission Admitted. On October 24, 2024, Plaintiff filed a joint opposition
brief as to each of the motions. On October 30, 2024, Zhang filed a reply
brief.  
 
II. ANALYSIS 
 
A.   
Motions to Compel Initial Responses 
¿ 
Plaintiff’s opposition acknowledges
that she did not provide timely responses to the propounded discovery. However,
Plaintiff has also since provided objection-free, verified responses to Zhang’s
first set of propounded discovery prior to filing the opposition. “If a part to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a
timely response, the following rules apply: (a) The party to whom the
interrogatories are directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce
writings under section 2030.230, as well as any objections to the
interrogatories, including one based on privilege or on the protection for work
product…” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290.) However, pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 2030.290, subdivision (a), “[t]he court, on motion, may
relieve that party from this waiver on its determination that both of the
following conditions are satisfied: (1) The party has subsequently served a
response that is in substantial compliance with section 2030.210, 2030.220,
2030.230, and 2030.240; [and] (2) The party’s failure to serve a timely
response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a)(1), (2).) 
The court
determines that the motion to compel an initial response to the interrogatories,
document demands, and the motion to deem requests for admission as admitted have
been MOOTED by Plaintiff’s service of belated written responses. However, the
mooting of the substantive motions does not moot Zhang’s request for sanctions.

B.    Sanctions        
Defendant Zhang has also requested monetary sanctions in
bringing his motion. Sanctions are generally awarded in
connection with motions to compel responses to interrogatories and requests for
production of documents against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel. (Code Civ. Proc. §§
2030.290 (c), 2030.300(d), 2031.300(c), and 2031.310(h).) However, sanctions
are not mandatory if the Court “finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust.”¿¿(Id.) 
 
Further, under Code of Civil
Procedure section 2033.280(c), the court shall make the order deeming the truth
of the matters admitted unless the responding party serves before the hearing a
proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial
compliance with Code Civ. Proc § 2033.220. Code of Civil Procedure section
2033.220 requires that each answer either admits, denies or specifies that the
responding party lacks sufficient information or knowledge. As stated in Demyer
v. Costa Mesa Mobile Home Estates, the moving party is not required to meet
and confer before bringing this action. (Demyer v. Costa Mesa Mobile Home
Estates, 36 Cal.App.4th 393, 395.)¿¿ 
 
Code of Civil Procedure
section 2023.030, subdivision (a) provides, in pertinent part, that the court
may impose a monetary sanction on a party engaging in the misuse of the
discovery process to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees,
incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct. A misuse of the discovery
process includes failing to respond or submit to an authorized method of
discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d).)¿¿ 
Here, Defendant Zhang has requested $1,058.75 per motion ($4,235
total). As for the request for sanctions in each of the motions, the motions
regarding interrogatories and document demands, the decision of whether to
grant or deny sanctions is discretionary with the court. However, as for the
motion to deem requests for admission as admitted, sanctions are mandatory when
a responding party untimely, but prior to the hearing, files verified,
code-complaint responses. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280(c).)
The amount requested is based on
the declaration of Zhang’s counsel, Maxwell R. Schrieffer, Esq. (“Schrieffer
Decl.”) which asserts that his billing rate for these matters is $200/hour.
Schrieffer states that he spent two hours preparing each motion, anticipates
spending one hour reviewing Plaintiff’s opposition and drafting a reply,
anticipates one hour to attend the hearing, spent $60 on the filing fees for
each motion, and the court reporter fee is $795 – so Schrieffer allotted
$198.75 per motion. The court finds the hourly rate, and amount of time spent to
be reasonable as to each motion. Thus, the court GRANTS each of Zhang’s four
(4) Requests for Monetary Sanctions. 
Plaintiff and her counsel are
ordered to pay $4,235 to Zhang’s counsel, Maxwell R. Schrieffer on or before December
6, 2024. 
III.
CONCLUSION 
 
            For the foregoing reasons, this Court
finds that Zhang’s substantive motions are MOOTED. However, the Court GRANTS
Zhang’s Request for Monetary Sanctions.  Defendant
Zhang is ordered to provide notice.
