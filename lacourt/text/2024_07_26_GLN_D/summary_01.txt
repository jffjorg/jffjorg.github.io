Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has ruled on four discovery motions filed by the defendant, Linda K. Lee, against the plaintiff, Jean Kechichian. The motions were to compel the plaintiff to respond to discovery requests, including form interrogatories, special interrogatories, requests for production of documents, and requests for admissions. The judge found that the plaintiff failed to serve timely responses to the discovery requests and therefore waived any objections to the discovery requests.

The judge granted the motions to compel responses, ordering the plaintiff to serve verified responses to the discovery requests without objection. The judge also deemed the facts admitted as true, in accordance with CCP § 2033.280(c).

The judge awarded monetary sanctions to the defendant in the amount of $1,382.50, $987.50, and $66.90, and denied the plaintiff's request for sanctions. The judge cautioned the plaintiff that in the future, the court may refuse to consider papers not filed in conformity with the statutes, rules, and procedures governing this litigation.
