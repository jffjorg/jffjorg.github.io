English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling addresses three motions to compel responses to discovery filed by the Plaintiff, Cindy Joanna Espinoza, against the Defendant, FCA US LLC.

The Order limits discovery to one set of Judicial Council Form Interrogatories, one set of 35 special interrogatories, and requests for production of documents, while the Notice provides specific requirements for document production. The Judge orders the parties to meet and confer in good faith regarding discovery and to serve any further discovery in compliance with the Order and Notice.
