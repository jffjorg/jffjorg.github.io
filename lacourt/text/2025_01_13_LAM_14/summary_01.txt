And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion filed by William Bailey and Bailey Law Corp, counsel for Defendant Southland Tactical Operation Patrol, LLC, to be relieved as counsel. However, the motion will only be granted once an updated form MC-053 is filed, effective upon the filing of the proof of service of the signed order upon the client. The judge sets an OSC (Order to Show Cause) Re: Status of Defendant's legal representation for April 4, 2025, at 8:30 a.m. to ensure that the defendant has legal representation in the matter. The judge notes that as a corporate entity, the defendant cannot represent itself in court and must have legal representation. The judge also notes that counsel complied with the requirements of Rule 3.1362 and that relief is appropriate under the circumstances of the case.
