And here is a summary in English text:

This tentative ruling addresses the demurrer filed by Defendant Clarence Tate to Plaintiff Farhad Yaghoubi's Complaint. The Complaint alleges an unlawful detainer due to a terminated oral month-to-month tenancy. The Defendant filed a notice of stay of proceedings due to an automatic stay caused by his bankruptcy filing, which automatically stays all state and federal proceedings outside of bankruptcy court against the debtor and their property. The Court has continued the demurrer scheduled for January 13, 2025, to February 10, 2025, due to the automatic stay.
