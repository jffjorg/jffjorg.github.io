MOVING PARTY: Plaintiff
Amir Sayed Moemen 
 
RESPONDING PARTY: None
 
            The Court has considered the moving papers.
No opposition has been filed as of May 3, 2024. 
 
BACKGROUND
             This is a contractual fraud case. On November
19, 2021, Plaintiffs Amir Sayed Moemen, Junjun Li, and Lino Sanchez filed a
Complaint against Defendants Jorge Vargas, JMG Logistics, Inc. and Does 1
through 20. The Complaint alleges six causes of action. 
 
DISCUSSION
            Where a party fails to serve timely
responses to discovery requests, the court may make an order compelling
responses.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, 2031.300; Healthcare
Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th
390, 403.)  A party that fails to serve timely responses waives any
objections to the request, including ones based on privilege or the protection
of attorney work product.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (a), 2031.300, subd.
(a).)¿ Unlike a motion to compel further responses, a motion to compel
responses is not subject to a 45-day time limit and the propounding party has
no meet and confer obligations.¿(Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc., supra,
148 Cal.App.4th at p. 404.)¿ 
 
            If a party to whom interrogatories
and inspection demands were directed fails to serve a timely response, the
propounding party may move for an order to compel responses without
objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (b), 2031.300, subd. (b).) 
Moreover, failure to timely serve responses waives objections to the requests.
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.280, subd. (a), 2030.290, subd. (a), 2031.300, subd.
(a).)   
 
Form Interrogatories
            On October 3, 2023, Plaintiff served
Form Interrogatories, Set Two upon Defendant Jorge Vargas. (Ritholz Decl. ¶ 2;
Ex. A.) Plaintiff’s counsel states that “on multiple occasions [he] spoke with
Defendants' counsel on the telephone and communicated by email advising that
responses to discovery were past due [and] advised that if responses were not
provided a Motion to compel would be filed. (Id. at ¶ 4.) Defendant
Vargas has not responded to Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatories, Set Two. (Id.
at 2.)
 
            Therefore, the Court grants
Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Defendant Vargas’ Responses to Form
Interrogatories, Set Two. 
 
Requests for Production 
Jorge Vargas and JMG Logistics 
            On October 3, 2023, Plaintiff served
Requests for Production on Defendants Jorge Vargas and JMG Logistics, Inc. (Id.
at ¶ 3.) Plaintiff’s counsel states that “on multiple occasions [he] spoke with
Defendants' counsel on the telephone and communicated by email advising that
responses to discovery were past due [and] advised that if responses were not
provided a Motion to compel would be filed. (Id. at ¶ 4.) To date,
Defendants Vargas or JMG Logistics, Inc. did not respond to the discovery
requests. (Id. at ¶ 5.)
 
            Therefore, the Court grants
Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Defendants Vargas and JMG Logistics’ Responses to
Requests for Production.  
 
Sanctions 
            Plaintiff seeks
sanctions in the amount of $1,667.50 against all Defendants and their counsel,
Oscar Acevedo. 
 
            Under Section 2023.030
of the California Code of Civil Procedure, and to "the extent authorized
by the chapter governing any particular discovery method or any other provision
of this title, the court, after notice to any affected party, person or
attorney, and after opportunity for hearing may impose . . . sanctions against
anyone engaging in conduct that is a misuse of the discovery process ....
" C.C.P. § 2023.030. California Code of Civil Procedure Section 2023.010
states: "Misuses of the discovery process include, but are not limited to
... (d) Failing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.
 
            The Court notes that
Plaintiff improperly combined two motions into one. Plaintiff is therefore ordered
to pay $60 for the second motion to the Court within 20 days.  The Court further orders Defendants and their
counsel, jointly and severally, to pay $1,667.50 in sanctions to Plaintiff and
his counsel within twenty days of the date of this order.
 
            Moving Party is ordered to give
notice of this ruling.            
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
 
Dated this 7th day of May 2024
