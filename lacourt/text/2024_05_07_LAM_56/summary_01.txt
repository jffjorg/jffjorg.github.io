And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The court has considered the moving papers and has continued the hearing on the petitions to confirm the minor's compromise for Plaintiffs Amiya Parrish and Amere Hicks. The court has determined that the proposed settlements appear to be fair and reasonable under the circumstances. However, there are defects in both petitions, including the failure to include an Order to Deposit Funds in Blocked Account and a copy of the written attorney fee agreement. The hearing is continued to May 28, 2024, to allow the petitioner to correct these defects.
