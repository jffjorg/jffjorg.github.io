BACKGROUND
            On October 4, 2021, Plaintiffs
Candice Hicks, Amari Parrish, a minor by and through her guardian ad litem
Candice Hicks, Amiya Parrish, a minor by and through her guardian ad litem
Candice Hicks, and Amere Hicks, a minor by and through her guardian ad litem
Candice Hicks (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) initiated this action against
Defendant Sukh Maya Properties, LLC (“Defendant”), alleging the following
causes of action: (1) breach of implied warranty of habitability; (2) negligent
hiring and supervision; (3) violation of Civil Code § 1942.4; and (4)
negligence. 
 
            On October 6, 2021, the Court
granted Petitioner’s applications for appointment of guardian ad litem for
Amere Hicks and Amiya Parrish. 
 
            On January 14, 2022, Defendant filed
its answer to the complaint. Thereafter, on January 16, 2024, Plaintiffs filed
a notice of unconditional settlement with the Court. 
 
            On March 25, 2024, Petitioner filed
the instant petitions to confirm the minor’s compromises of Plaintiffs Amiya
Parrish and Amere Hicks. 
 
DISCUSSION
            “[T]he protective role the court
generally assumes in cases involving minors, [is] a role to assure that
whatever is done is in the minor’s best interests…[I]ts primary concern is
whether the compromise is sufficient to provide for the minor’s injuries, care
and treatment.” (Goldberg v. Sup. Ct. (1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 1378,
1382.) 
 
Court
approval is required for all settlements of a minor’s claim. (Probate Code §§
3500, 3600, et seq.; Code Civ. Proc. § 372.) A petition for court approval of a
compromise or covenant not to sue under Code of Civil
Procedure section 372 must comply with California Rules of Court,
rules 7.950, 7.951 and 7.952. The petition must be verified by the petitioner
and contain a full disclosure of all information that has “any bearing upon the
reasonableness” of the compromise or the covenant. (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 7.950.)
Merits
Petitioner
has filed two petitions to confirm the minor’s compromise for Plaintiffs Amiya
Parrish and Amere Hicks. Amiya Parish, a minor, by and through Petitioner, has
agreed to release her claims against Defendant in exchange for $6,000. If
approved, $2,000 will be used to pay attorney’s fees, and $60 will be used for
nonmedical expenses, leaving a balance of $3,940 for Amiya Parish, to be
deposited in an insured account with Schools First Federal Credit Union located
4001 N. Lakewood Blvd., Ste 120, Long Beach, CA 90808, subject to withdrawal
only on authorization of the court. Also, Amere Hicks, a minor, by and through
Petitioner has agreed to release his claims against Defendant in exchange for
$4,000. If approved, $1,333 will be used to pay attorney’s fees, and $60 will
be used for nonmedical expenses, leaving a balance of $2,607 for Amere Hicks,
to be deposited in an insured account with Schools First Federal Credit Union
located 4001 N. Lakewood Blvd., Ste 120, Long Beach, CA 90808.
 
Upon
review of the proposed settlements, they both appear to be fair and reasonable
under the circumstances. Further, the requested attorney’s fees stated in both
petition, which amount to approximately a third of the total settlements, are
fair and reasonable. However, there are defects in both petitions. First,
Petitioner has failed to include an Order to Deposit Funds in Blocked Account
(form MC-355) for both petitions. Second, both petitions are missing a copy of
the written attorney fee agreement. 
 
Accordingly,
the hearing on the petitions is continued to May 28, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. in order
to allow Petitioner to correct these defects by supplementing the petitions
with the above-referenced documents by May 14, 2024.  In addition, Petitioner is ordered to appear,
either in person or remotely, at the continued hearing. 
 
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.            
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
