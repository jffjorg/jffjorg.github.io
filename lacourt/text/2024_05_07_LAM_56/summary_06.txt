And here is a summary in English text:

The Tentative Ruling is on the Demurrer to Complaint and the Motion to Strike. The ruling addresses the sufficiency of the Complaint and the Defendant's motions to strike certain paragraphs. The Court finds that the Complaint sufficiently alleges a cause of action against the Defendants and that the Defendant's demurrer is OVERRULED in its entirety. The Court also finds that the Complaint sufficiently pleads facts to support an award of attorney's fees and punitive damages. The Defendant's motion to strike is DENIED.
