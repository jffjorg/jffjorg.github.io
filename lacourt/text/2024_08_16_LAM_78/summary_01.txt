And here is the summary in English:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Fantawild Animation, Inc. (Petitioner) versus Nowa Filmlatka Distribution SP ZOO, et al. (Respondent). The case involves a dispute over an arbitration award issued on December 15, 2023, in favor of Petitioner. The award requires Respondent to deliver certain materials for animated motion pictures and to pay $87,000.

The judge has determined that the petition to confirm the arbitration award is defective due to errors in service and timeliness. Specifically, the petition was not served with a notice of hearing, and there is no proof of service to confirm that the arbitration award was served on the parties. The judge has therefore continued the hearing to a later date and ordered Petitioner to file supplemental papers to correct these errors.

The judge has also cited various laws and case citations to support the ruling, including the California Code of Civil Procedure and various court decisions. The ruling will be final unless the parties submit to it or appear at a hearing to argue the matter.
