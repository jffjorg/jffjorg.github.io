And here is a brief summary in English text:

The tentative ruling denies the petition for approval of transfer of structured settlement payment rights. The court finds that the transfer agreement complies with Insurance Code sections 10136 and 10138, but the transfer is not in the best interest of the payee. The court notes that the payee has transferred portions of his original structured settlement and received a total of $154,066, but is still experiencing financial hardship. The court also finds that the payee has not provided sufficient information regarding his financial situation and has not received independent professional advice regarding the transfer. The court requires the payee to file a supplemental declaration explaining how the $154,066 was spent, why he requires more money, and how much of the annuity this proposed transfer will leave him with.
