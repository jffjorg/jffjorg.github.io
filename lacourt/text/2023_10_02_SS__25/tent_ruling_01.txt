  Case Number:  21STLC05409    Hearing Date:   October 2, 2023    Dept:  25  Amica Mutual Insurance Co. v. Taijahn Linzy Reese  21STLC05409I.               
Background 
 
On July 26, 2021, Plaintiff Amica Mutual Insurance Company
(“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendants Taijahn Linzy Reese
(“Reese”) and Linda Anne Hollins (“Hollins”) (collectively, “Defendants”) for
damages arising from a motor vehicle incident. 
 
At this time,
Plaintiff moves to enforce the Settlement Agreement (“Agreement”) pursuant to
CCP § 664.6.  The Motion is unopposed.    
 
Plaintiff attests the Agreement was reached for the total
amount of $7,574.87. Plaintiff avers the terms of the Agreement required Defendant
Reese to make payments of $400.00 per month from September 2, 2021, to February
2, 2023, and then $374.87 paid on March 2, 2023, in exchange for Plaintiff’s
dismissal of her claims against Defendant Reese. (Tapper Decl., Exhibit A at
pg. 2:3-13.) This Court has retained jurisdiction over the parties to enforce
settlement until performance in full terms of the Agreement. (Tapper Decl.,
Exhibit A at pg. 4:1-3.)
 
To date, Defendant Reese has paid $2,000. (Tapper Decl., ¶
4.) However, Defendant Reese has not made a payment since January 2, 2023.
(Tapper Decl., ¶ 3.) Plaintiff seeks Judgment be entered against Defendant
Reese for the sum of $6,862.13.  (Tapper
Decl., ¶ 5.)  The sum is calculated in
the amount as $5,574.87 in unpaid principal, $991.26 interest at a 10% per
annum on the unpaid principal, $296.00 in court costs. (Tapper Decl., ¶
5.)  The Stipulation allows for interest
and court costs. (Tapper Decl., Exhibit A at pg. 2:3-4.)
 
II.            
Legal Standard 
 
Pursuant to CCP § 664.6: “If parties to pending litigation
stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties outside the presence of the court
or orally before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the
court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.
If requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties
to enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of the
settlement.” 
For purposes of this section, a writing is signed by a
party if it is signed by any of the following: 
(1) The party. 
(2) An attorney who represents the party. 
(3) If the
party is an insurer, an agent who is authorized in writing by the insurer to
sign on the insurer's behalf. 
(CCP §664.6(b).)  
 
Strict compliance with the statutory requirements is
necessary before a court can enforce a settlement agreement under this
statute.  (Sully-Miller Contracting Co. v. Gledson/Cashman
Construction, Inc. (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 30, 37.)  Thus, to enforce a
written settlement agreement under CCP section 664.6, the following three
elements must be met: (1) the parties must have come to a meeting of the minds
on all material points; (2) there must be a writing that contains the material
terms of the agreement; and (3) the writing must be signed by the
parties.  (Weddington Productions, Inc. v. Flick (1998) 60 Cal.App.4th
793, 797-98.) 
 
“If no time is specified for the performance of an act
required to be performed, a reasonable time is allowed.”  (Civ. Code, §
1657; see also Patel v. Liebermensch (2008) 45 Cal.4th 344, 352, fn. omitted [“In the absence
of a specified time of payment, a reasonable period is allowable under Civil
Code section 1657.”].)   
 
The Agreement submitted by Plaintiff is signed by Plaintiff
and Defendant Reese. (Tapper Decl., Exhibit A at pg. 5.) Further, the agreement
contains all material terms for the settlement, and Defendants have not been
dismissed.  (Weddington Productions, supra, 60 Cal. App. 4th at 797-98;
Tapper Decl., Exhibit A at pg. 4:1-3.)  Accordingly, the statutory
requirements of Section 664.6 have been met. 
 
Furthermore, the Agreement provides in pertinent part the
terms of the payment and payment due dates: 
 
Monetary Consideration. Defendant Reese agreed
to pay the total sum of seven thousand five hundred seventy-four dollars and
eighty-seven cents ($7,574.87) to Plaintiff (the "Settlement
Amount")', as set forth below:
 
1.
…  
(a) The sum of $ 400.00 shall be paid
on or before the 2nd of each month from September 2, 2021, to February 2, 2023;
and 
(b)
The sum of $ 374.87 shall be paid on March 2, 2023. 
... 
 
5.
Upon the failure of DEFENDANT to make the installment payments hereinabove
provided for, PLAINTIFF may cause this Stipulation to be filed with the
above-entitled court, along with a Declaration of PLAINTIFF or PLAINTIFF's
counsel of record, reciting such default in payment and setting forth the full
amount then owing, that is, the amount set forth in Paragraph 1 hereinabove,
less credit for all payments made prior to default, plus any additional court
costs hereinafter incurred by PLAINTIFF.
 
(Tapper Decl., Exhibit A at pg. 2:9-13 and 3:1-9.) (emphasis original.) 
 
The Agreement also provides in pertinent part that awarding
of interest and court costs may be entered:
In
favor of PLAINTIFF and against said DEFENDANT for damages in the principal sum
of $ 7,574.87, plus interest from July 4 21, 2021 (date of the filing of this
complaint) and court costs.
 
(Tapper Decl., Exhibit A at pg. 2:2-4.) (emphasis original.) 
 
The Agreement straightforwardly provides express terms for
breach of the contract, and the award of reasonable interest and costs in
enforcement of the agreement. Defendant Reese does not oppose this motion and
thus does not present any argument that the specific terms of the Agreement are
unenforceable, or that the parties did not come to a meeting of the minds on
all material points when effectuating the subject agreement.
 
It is undisputed that Defendant Reese failed to make payments
on the principal remaining amount of $5,574.87, after January 2,2023.  Furthermore, the Agreement provides terms for
recovery for judgment interest and costs. 
The Agreement does not stipulate the interest rate.  Plaintiff argues a 10% per annum interest
rate is reasonable. Pursuant to Cal. Const. Art XV, 1, interest shall be 7
percent per annum. From the date of the breach on January 2, 2023,
based on $5,574.87 at 7% per annum is $323.35. Costs for filing and service of
process totaled $296.00. 
 
 
III.          
Conclusion 
 
Therefore, the motion to enforce settlement is GRANTED
against Defendant Reese for the unpaid remaining amount of $5574.87, $296.00 in
costs, and $323.35 for interest. The Court intends to enter judgment in the
total sum of $6,194.22.
 
Plaintiff is ordered to give notice.
