II. Legal Standard & Discussion
A. Timeliness
“A notice of motion to
claim attorney’s fees for services up to and including the rendition of judgment
in the trial court . . . must be served and filed within the time for filing a
notice of appeal under . . . rules 8.822 and 8.823 in a limited civil case.”
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1702, subd. (b)(1).) (Emphasis added.) In a limited
civil case, a notice of appeal must be filed on or before the earliest of 30
days after service of a document entitled “Notice of Entry” of judgment or 90
days after the entry of judgment. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.822, subd.
(a)(1).)
Petitioner’s motion is
timely as it was filed within 90 days after entry of judgment.
B. Request for Attorney’s Fees and Costs
In its June 20, 2022, order, the Court ruled that
Petitioner is the prevailing party.  A
prevailing party is entitled to recover costs as a matter of right. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1032, subd. (a)(4), (b).) 
“[W]hen authorized by contract, statute or law;
attorney fees are allowable as ‘costs’ under Code of Civil Procedure section
1032.” (Del Cerro Mobile Estates v. Proffer (2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 943,
947.) However, “‘recoverable litigation costs [under section 1032] . . .
include attorney fees, . . . only when the party entitled to costs has a legal
basis, [that is] independent of the cost statutes and grounded in an agreement,
statute, or other law, upon which to claim recovery of attorney fees.’
[Citation.]” (Id.) 
All
costs must be “reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation rather
than merely convenient or beneficial to its preparation” and reasonable in
amount. (Code Civ. Proc., §
1033.5, subd. (c)(2),
(3).)
 
Petitioner’s attorney
fees are allowable as costs under Code of Civil Procedure § 1032 because this
action is based on a breach of contract claim which is a “statute ‘independent
of the cost statutes’ . . . .” (Del Cerro Mobile Estates v. Proffer,
supra, 87 Cal.App.4th at p. 948.) The breach of contract attorney fees and
costs provision is found in Civil Code § 1717. 
It reads in pertinent part: 
“In any action on a
contract, where the contract specifically provides that attorney's fees and
costs, which are incurred to enforce that contract, shall be awarded either to
one of the parties or to the prevailing party, then the party who is determined
to be the party prevailing on the contract, whether he or she is the party
specified in the contract or not, shall be entitled to reasonable attorney's
fees in addition to other costs." 
(Civil Code § 1717(a).) 
            Respondent
argues the instant petition be denied because the Court found no contract
existed between the parties.  However, in
Reply, Petitioner argues that “the
statute gives a reciprocal remedy for a nonsignatory defendant, sued on a
contract as if he or she were a party to it, when a plaintiff would clearly be
entitled to attorney's fees should he prevail in enforcing the contractual
obligation against the defendant.”  (Milman v. Shukhat (1994) 22 Cal.App.4th 538, 543.)  
            Here,
Respondent sued under a breach of contract claim and thus opened the door for
reciprocal remedy.  The
contract (Linen & Garment Rental Agreement) used to make the claim states
that the prevailing party shall be entitled to attorney’s fees and costs. (Mot.,
Exh. 1.) The Resolution of Disputes section states that the “prevailing party
shall be entitled to recover… their attorney's fees, as well as reasonable
costs incurred in pursuing the matter.” (Id.)
            Therefore,
the fees are allowable. 
            Respondent
argues that the fees are excessive on the basis that: (1) the associate billing
rate is too high based on a survey in the National Law Journal (not attached as
an exhibit) and (2) by using three attorneys there was an inordinate amount of
duplicative billing.  In reply,
Petitioner notes that the Declaration of Kenneth J. Freed contains the billing
history of the attorneys on the matter and designates which tasks were
completed by each attorney therein. 
Further each attorney has attested that their billing rate is $500 per
hour under penalty of perjury.  
Petitioner requests $6,550.00
attorney fees. (Freed Decl., ¶ 5.)  The
Court finds the requested attorney’s fees were reasonably necessary to the conduct
of the litigation and are reasonable in amount.
Petitioner also requests
$264.54 in costs. The amount consists of filing and motion fees ($240), and fees
for electronic filing or service ($24.54.) (Memorandum of Costs, filed July 11,
2023.) Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5 expressly allows for those costs.
(Civ. Code Proc., § 1033.5 (1), (4), (13), (14).) “If items on their face
appear to be proper charges, the verified memorandum of costs is prima facie
evidence of their propriety, and the burden is on the party seeking to tax
costs to show they were not reasonable or necessary.” (Jones v. Dumrichob
(1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 1258, 1266.) Here, Petitioner filed a verified memorandum
of costs, and Respondent has not opposed nor moved to tax the costs. 
Accordingly, the Court
finds the requested costs proper charges.
For the reasons discussed
above, the Court grants Petitioner’s request for costs of $264.54 and attorney’s
fees in the reduced amount of $6,550, for a total of $6,814.54.
III. Conclusion & Order
For the foregoing
reasons, Petitioner Creditors Adjustment Bureau’s Motion for Attorney’s Fees
and Costs is GRANTED. The Court awards Petitioner $6,550 in attorney’s fees and
$264.54 in costs.
