## English Summary

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a Motion to Vacate Dismissal filed by Plaintiff Sunrun Installation Services, Inc. The case involves a breach of contract dispute between Sunrun and Defendant Alejandro Salazar. 

After Defendant failed to respond to the lawsuit, a Default Judgment was entered. However, Plaintiff's counsel subsequently learned that Defendant and Plaintiff had resolved their dispute.

Plaintiff's counsel filed a Motion to Vacate Dismissal, arguing that the default judgment was a result of their inadvertence. The Judge acknowledges that Plaintiff's counsel made an error but notes that the required sworn affidavit attesting to the inadvertence has not been properly filed.

Therefore, the Judge has continued the hearing to November 7th, 2023, to allow Plaintiff's counsel to correct this error. Failure to do so will result in the motion being denied.
