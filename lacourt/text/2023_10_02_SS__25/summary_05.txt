And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in favor of Pomona Islander, L.P., the plaintiff in this case, granting a permanent injunction against Miguel A. Murillo, the defendant. The injunction is for a period of three years and prohibits Murillo from violating various rules and regulations at the Pomona Islander Mobile Home Park.

The judge's ruling is based on the fact that Murillo has allegedly been violating the rules since before October 2021 and has not complied with four separate seven-day notices issued by the plaintiff. The plaintiff has also provided evidence of the violations, including photographs and testimony from a park manager.

The injunction prohibits Murillo from storing items outside his mobile home and around the premises, from failing to maintain a clean and well-maintained mobile home and premises, and from not complying with the park's rules and regulations. The judge also orders Murillo to remove one of the two dogs from the premises and register the remaining dog with park management.

The judge's ruling is based on California Civil Code section 798.88, which gives management an injunctive relief remedy for violations of "reasonable" park rules and regulations. The judge also relies on previous case law, including Rancho Santa Paula Mobilehome Park, Ltd. v. Evans (1994) 26 Cal.App.4th 1139.

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the Plaintiff's unopposed Petition for Permanent Injunction against the Defendant for a period of three years. The Defendant has violated the park's Rules and Regulations since before October 2021 and has failed to comply with the Rental Agreement, Rules, and Pet Agreement despite multiple seven-day notices. The Judge has found that a permanent injunction is necessary to ensure the Defendant's compliance with the Rules and prevent further violations. The permanent injunction prohibits the Defendant from storing items outside the mobile home, maintaining a clearance of at least three feet around the utility pedestals, removing weeds and dead plants, and registering and preventing disturbance of dogs, among other things.
