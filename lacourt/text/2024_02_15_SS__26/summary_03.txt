And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Defendant Chatherine Zheng's motion to quash service of the summons and complaint and to vacate the default judgment. The judge found that the service of the summons and complaint was defective, as the address listed as Defendant Zheng's was actually the residence of her former romantic partner, Jonathan Nguyen. The judge also found that Defendant Zheng did not receive actual notice of the action and was not present at the service address at the time of service. As a result, the judge concluded that the default judgment was void and granted Defendant Zheng's motion to vacate it.
