Antonyan v. Shadow Mountain View COA, et al.MOTION
TO COMPEL COMPLIANCE WITH DISCOVERY
(CCP § 2031.300)
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Plaintiff Vardan Antonyan’s Motion to Compel Compliance with
Discovery Responses is PLACED OFF CALENDAR.
 
 
ANALYSIS:
 
Plaintiff Vardan Antonyan (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant
action against Defendant Shadow Mountain View Community Association
(“Defendant”) on January 11, 2023. Defendant filed an answer on February 14,
2023. On July 18, 2023, the Court denied Plaintiff’s motion to compel
production of documents pursuant to deposition subpoena and issued sanctions
against Plaintiff in the amount of $100.00. (Minute Order, 07/18/23.) 
 
Plaintiff filed a motion for sanctions on August 2, 2023,
then filed a First Amended Complaint on September 8, 2023. The Court struck the
First Amended Complaint because it was filed without leave. (See Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 472, subd. (a), 436, subd. (b).) The Court denied the motion for
sanctions on October 24, 2023. (Minute Order, 10/24/23.) On January 22, 2024,
the Court denied Plaintiff’s motion for preliminary injunction. (Minute Order,
01/22/24.) 
 
Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to Compel Responses on
February 13, 2024. No opposition has been filed to date. The Motion was filed
and served only two days before the hearing, which is insufficient notice.
Failure to give proper notice of a motion is not only a violation of the
statutory requirements but of due process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005; Jones
v. Otero (1984) 156 Cal.App.3d 754, 757.) Accordingly, the Motion is placed
off calendar. 
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff
Vardan Antonyan’s Motion to Compel Compliance with Discovery Responses is PLACED
OFF CALENDAR.
 
 
Court clerk to give notice.
