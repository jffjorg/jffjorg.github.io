Default and Default Judgment is DENIED.
 
                                                                                                                                
ANALYSIS:
 
On June 28, 2022, Plaintiff Ronald P. Slates, a professional
corporation (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendants Simeon Hixson
aka Sim J. Hixson (“Defendant”). On
July 14, 2022, Plaintiff filed a Proof of Services of Summons, stating that it
had served Defendant with the Summons, Complaint, and other documents by
substitute service. (Proof of Personal Service, filed 07/14/22.)
 
On
August 9, 2022, Defendant filed a Notice of Stay of Proceedings due to
arbitration. (Notice of Stay, filed 08/09/22.) On September 22, 2022, Plaintiff
filed a Notice of Termination of Stay of Proceedings, informing the Court that
the arbitration proceeding was terminated due to Defendant’s failure to pay
arbitration fees. (Notice of Termination, filed 09/22/22.)
 
On
October 4, 2022, default was entered against the Defendant. On February 6,
2023, the Court held a Non-Appearance Case Review Re: Bankruptcy, noting that
Plaintiff had filed a Notice of Termination of Stay of Proceedings and lifted
the stay on the case in its entirety. (Minute Order, 02/06/23.) The Court also
noted that default had been entered against the Defendant and set an Order to
Show Cause Re: Entry of Default Judgment for April 18, 2023. (Ibid.) 
 
On
August 16, 2023, default judgment of $28,684.99 was entered against Defendant
and in favor of Plaintiff. (Default Judgment, 08/16/23.) On October 23, 2023,
Defendant filed the instant motion to vacate the default and default judgment.
On November 1, 2023, Plaintiff filed its opposition to the motion. The Motion
came for hearing on November 15, 2023 in Department 25 of the Spring Street Courthouse,
at which time no ruling was issued. Instead, the case was transferred to
Department 26 in the Spring Street Courthouse and reset for hearing on February
15, 2024. 
 
Discussion
 
Defendant moves to vacate the entry of default pursuant to
Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b), which states that an
application for relief must be made within a reasonable time, no more than six
months after entry of the order from which relief is sought and must be
accompanied by an affidavit of fault attesting to the mistake, inadvertence,
surprise or neglect of the moving party or its attorney. (Code Civ. Proc., §
473, subd. (b); English v. IKON Business Solutions (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th
130, 143.) The motion must also be accompanied by a copy of the moving
defendant’s proposed pleading. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b).) This can be
corrected if Defendant submits a proposed responsive pleading by the hearing
date. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b); Carmel, Ltd. v. Tavoussi
(2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 393, 403.) The instant Motion was not timely filed
within six months of entry of default on October 4, 2022. The six-month
deadline is jurisdictional and not subject to tolling. (Manson, Iver & York
v. Black (2009) 176 Cal.App.4th 36, 42.) 
 
Even if the Court were to find that the Motion is timely
because it was filed within six months of entry of default judgment, Defendant
has not demonstrated mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect with
respect to the entry of default. As Plaintiff points out, Business and
Professions Code section 6201, subdivision (c), states that upon the filing of
the request for arbitration, the action shall be automatically stayed until the
award of the arbitration is issued or the arbitration is otherwise terminated.
Under California Rules of Court, Rule 3.650(d), when a stay is no longer in
effect, the party who filed the notice of the stay must immediately serve and
file a notice of termination. 
 
Plaintiff filed the Notice of Stay of Proceedings on August
9, 2022, thereby initiating the stay. Contrary to the assertion in Defendant’s
Motion, the Court did not issue an order with respect to the length of the stay
upon which Defendant could have relied. (See Motion, p. 2:4-8; Hixson Decl.,
¶2.) The Court did not issue any order in this action until February 6, 2023.
As of the date default was entered—October 4, 2022—Defendant could not have had
any reasonable expectation regarding the length of the stay, or that it was
still in effect at that time. 
 
Nor could Defendant have been surprised by the entry of
default judgment in August 2023. Defendant was served with the Notice of
Termination of Stay by mail on September 22, 2022. (Notice of Termination,
filed 09/22/22, pp. 5-6.) Also, on February 6, 2023, the Court noted that the
Notice of Termination of Stay had been filed and indicated that the stay was
lifted. (Minute Order, 02/06/23.) Notably, Defendant’s Motion does not address
his notice of the Notice of Termination, the request for entry of default, or
the Court’s order setting an order to show cause regarding default judgment.
(Motion, Hixson Decl., ¶4.) These documents were mailed to Defendant at their
address of record. (Notice of Termination, filed 09/22/22, pp. 5-6; Certificate
of Mailing, 02/06/23; Request for Entry of Default, filed 10/04/22, ¶6.) Therefore,
the Court finds that Defendant has not demonstrated that default or default
judgment was entered as a result of mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or
excusable neglect. 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant Simeon Hixson aka Sim J. Hixson’s Motion to Vacate
Default and Default Judgment is DENIED. 
 
Court clerk to give notice.
