And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that Defendant Simeon Hixson aka Sim J. Hixson's motion to vacate default and default judgment is denied. The judge found that the motion was not timely filed and that the Defendant has not demonstrated mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect with respect to the entry of default. The judge noted that the Defendant was served with a notice of termination of stay of proceedings and that the stay was lifted on February 6, 2023, and that the Defendant was aware of the termination of the stay. The judge also found that the Defendant was not surprised by the entry of default judgment in August 2023 and that the Defendant's motion does not address the notice of termination, the request for entry of default, or the court's order setting an order to show cause regarding default judgment.
