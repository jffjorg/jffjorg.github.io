And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to disqualify counsel filed by Samara A. Weiner, the cross-defendant. The motion seeks to disqualify the law firm, Lewis Brisbois Bisgaard & Smith, LLP (LBBS), from representing the cross-complainants, Century Property Management & Investment, Inc. and Deion Gerhard, based on alleged bigoted language used by senior partners of the law firm in their email communications over a period of 15 years. The judge has denied the motion, finding that the evidence provided is not sufficient to meet the burden of showing grounds for disqualification. The judge notes that the reported language is shocking, but it does not demonstrate grounds to disqualify the attorneys of record in this action.
