And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the plaintiff's motion to compel compliance with discovery responses is placed off calendar due to insufficient notice. The plaintiff filed the motion only two days before the hearing, which is not sufficient under the statutory requirements and violates due process. The judge notes that the plaintiff has failed to comply with discovery requests in the past, and the court has previously denied the plaintiff's motions to compel and issued sanctions. The judge concludes that the motion is placed off calendar and orders the court clerk to give notice.
