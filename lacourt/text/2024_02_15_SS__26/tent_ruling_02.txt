COUNSEL
(Rules
of Professional Conduct Rule 3-700(B), case law)
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Cross-Defendant

ANALYSIS: 
 
Samara A. Weiner (“Cross-Defendant Weiner”) filed the
instant action for recovery of COVID-19 rental debt against Cross-Complainants
Century Property Management & Investment, Inc. and Deion Gerhard (“Cross-Complainants
Century Property and Gerhard”) on July 27, 2022. Cross-Complainants Century
Property and Gerhard filed an answer and cross-complaint against Cross-Defendant
Weiner, Art Koomer, and Michael Koomer on November 23, 2022. Arthur Koomer and
Michael also filed cross-complaints against unnamed cross-defendants on May 18,
2023 and June 30, 2023, respectively.
 
Cross-Defendant Weiner’s filed the instant Motion to
Disqualify Counsel on December 5, 2023. Cross-Complainants Century Property and
Gerhard filed an opposition on February 1, 2024. On February 5, 2024, the Court
dismissed Cross-Defendant Weiner’s Complaint against Cross-Complainants Century
Property and Gerhard with prejudice. (Minute Order, 02/05/24.)
 
Discussion
 
Cross-Defendant Weiner moves to disqualify
Cross-Complainants Century Property and Gerhard’s law firm, Lewis Brisbois
Bisgaard & Smith, LLP (“LBBS”) pursuant to Rules of Professional Conduct
Rule 3-700(B) and the Court’s inherent authority. As pointed out in the
opposition, Rule 3-700(B) is no longer in effect, and the existing rule, Rule
1.16, only mandates dismissal when “the lawyer’s mental or physical condition
renders it unreasonably difficult to carry out the representation effectively.”
(Cal. Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 1.16(a)(3).) The Motion, however,
does not argue regarding the mental or physical condition regarding any
specific lawyer representing Cross-Complainants Century Property and Gerhard.
Instead, Cross-Defendant Weiner points to a news article that reported about
bigoted language used by senior LBBS partners in their email communications
over a span of 15 years. (Motion, pp. 1:9-3:25.) The reported language included
slurs and derogatory comments against women, Jewish people and gay people. (Ibid.)
Cross-Defendant Weiner argues that disqualification is appropriate given that
she is Jewish and her paralegal is gay. (Motion, Weiner Decl., ¶¶4-5; Ingram
Decl., ¶¶4-5.) 
 
The Motion also points to the Court’s inherent authority to
disqualify counsel. (Citing Ontiveros v. Constable (2016) 245
Cal.App.4th 686, 694 [quoting People ex rel. Dept. of Corporations v.
SpeeDee Oil Change Systems, Inc. (1999) 20 Cal.4th 1135, 1145].) In
opposition, Cross-Complainants Century Property and Gerhard invoke case law
warning courts that motions to disqualify are strongly disfavored and subject
to strict scrutiny. (Citing DeLuca v. State Fish Co., Inc. (2007) 217
Cal.App.4th 671, 685-686.) The evidence provided in the Motion is not
sufficient to meet this burden. The news article is not authenticated and
ultimately amounts to hearsay comments by attorneys not involved in this
action. No evidence is provided with respect to the attorneys of record for
Cross-Complainants Century Property and Gerhard. Shocking though the reported
email communications are, the Court does not find that they demonstrate grounds
to disqualify the LBBS attorneys of record in this action. 
 
 
Conclusion
 
Cross-Defendant
Samara A. Weiner’s Motion to Disqualify Counsel is DENIED.
 
 
Court clerk to give notice.
