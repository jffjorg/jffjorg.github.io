And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling in a case where the petitioner is seeking a name change. However, before the court can rule on the petition, the petitioner must clear an outstanding bench warrant. The court has continued the hearing to February 24, 2025, and the petitioner must provide written proof that the warrant has been fully addressed and resolved at least two weeks prior to the continued hearing. If the petitioner fails to provide this proof, the hearing may be taken off calendar without prejudice, pending the filing of proof that all outstanding warrants have been cleared. The court clerk will run a new criminal history assessment prior to the continued hearing to verify that the warrant has been cleared, and will notify all parties of the new date.
