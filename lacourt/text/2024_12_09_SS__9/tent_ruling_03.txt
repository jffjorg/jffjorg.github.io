 Case Number:  24STCP03179    Hearing Date:   December 9, 2024    Dept:  9 The criminal history assessment that
the Court’s Clerk’s Office has run through CLETS reveals that Petitioner has an
active outstanding warrant: Warrant #L18419719000.
Petitioner must clear the outstanding
bench warrant and file evidence of such before the Court will rule on the
petition for name change.  The OSC and hearing on the petition for name
change are continued to February 24, 2025 at 9:30 am.  No later than two
weeks before the continued OSC and hearing, Petitioner must file written proof
that the outstanding bench warrant has been fully addressed and resolved. 
Failure to do so will result in the OSC and hearing on the petition being taken
off calendar without prejudice to be placed back on calendar upon filing of
proof that all outstanding warrants have been cleared.  The Court Clerk is to run a new criminal
history assessment prior to the continued OSC to verify that the bench warrant
has been cleared.
The Court Clerk is to give notice to
all parties.
