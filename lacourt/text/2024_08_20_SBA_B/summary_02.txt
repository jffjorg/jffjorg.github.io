And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the motion of Thomas Reed's attorney, Haleh Shekarchian, to be relieved as counsel. The attorney has been unable to communicate with Thomas Reed, the plaintiff, due to a breakdown in their relationship. Despite efforts to contact Reed through private investigations, mail, email, and requests for change of address, the attorney has been unable to establish communication. The judge finds that the attorney has shown sufficient reason to be relieved as counsel and orders that the attorney will be relieved of their duties as counsel of record for Thomas Reed, effective upon the filing of the proof of service of the signed "Order Granting Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel â€“ Civil" form.
