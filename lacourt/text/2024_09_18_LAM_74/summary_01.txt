And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the Defendant's motion to terminate sanctions or, in the alternative, issue sanctions and $3,980.00 in monetary sanctions should be granted. The Defendant contends that the Plaintiff has failed to comply with the court's April 26, 29, and 30, 2024 orders directing the Plaintiff to provide responses to the Defendant's discovery requests and to pay monetary sanctions. The Defendant's discovery requests were served on October 27, 2023, with responses initially due by December 1, 2023. The Plaintiff failed to respond, and the court subsequently granted the Defendant's discovery motions, ordering the Plaintiff to provide responses within 10 days of the court's orders and to pay $3,396.60 in sanctions. Despite receiving notice by email on May 15, 2024, the Plaintiff failed to comply with the court's orders, leading the Defendant to file his motion for terminating sanctions. The court finds that the Plaintiff's actions are willful and that lesser sanctions will not produce compliance. Therefore, the court grants the Defendant's motion for terminating sanctions and orders the Plaintiff to pay $3,980.00 to the Defendant's counsel.
