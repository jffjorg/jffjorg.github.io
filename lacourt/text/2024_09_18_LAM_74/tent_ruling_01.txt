  Case Number:  22STCV35846    Hearing Date:   September 18, 2024    Dept:  74 Williams v. Williams
Defendant Corey Flournoy Williams’
Motion to Terminate Sanctions or in the Alternative, Issue Sanctions and
$3,980.00 in Monetary Sanctions
 
Defendant
Corey Flournoy Williams contends that Plaintiff has failed to comply with the
Court’s April 26, 29, and 30, 2024 orders directing Plaintiff to provide
responses to Defendant’s discovery requests and to pay monetary sanctions.
(4-26-24, 4-29-24, and 4-30 Minute Order.) Defendant seeks terminating
sanctions dismissing the Complaint against him. Defendant also seeks $3,980.00
in monetary sanctions for each motion ($3,920.00 in attorneys’ fees for
preparing his motions and $60.00 in filing fees.) (Motion, p. 7:12-20.) 
Where violation
of a discovery order is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the
evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the
discovery rules, the superior court is justified in imposing the ultimate
sanction. (Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem¿(2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 262,
280.) The Court finds that terminating sanctions
are appropriate here. Plaintiff has had sufficient time to provide responses to
Defendant’s discovery requests. Defendant’s discovery requests were served on
October 27, 2023, with responses initially due by December 1, 2023. (Declaration
of Hemin Chen (“Chen Decl.”), ¶¶ 3, 6, Exhibits A-B.) Plaintiff failed to
respond, to which the Court subsequently granted Defendant’s discovery motions,
ordering Plaintiff to provide responses within 10 days of the Court’s orders
and to pay $3,396.60 in sanctions. (Chen Decl., ¶ 13, Exhibits H-K; 4-26-24
Minute Order, 4-29-24 Minute Order, 4-30 Minute Order.) Defendant gave notice
by email on May 15, 2024. (Chen Decl., ¶ 14; Exhibit L.) Plaintiff failed to
comply with all three orders, leading Defendant to file his motion for
terminating sanctions on May 15, 2024. (Motion, p. 3.) On July 12, 2024,
Defendant filed a notice of Plaintiff’s failure to file an opposition to
Defendant’s motion for terminating sanctions. (Notice of Non-Opposition, p. 2; Code
Civ. Proc., § 1005(b).)
 The Court further notes Plaintiff’s lack of
oppositions, which the Court construes as a tacit admission that Defendant’s arguments
are meritorious. Given Plaintiff’s pattern of failing to comply with discovery obligations
and the Court’s orders, the Court finds that Plaintiff’s actions are willful, (Fairfield,
supra, 246 Cal.App.2d at p. 118), and that lesser sanctions will not
produce compliance, (see Deyo, supra, 84 Cal.App.3d at pp. 787, 797; Doppes,
supra, 174 Cal.App.4th at p. 992.) Accordingly, the Court grants Defendant’s
motion for terminating sanctions. The Court finds $3,980.00 in sanctions is proper.
($350/hour at 11.2 hours ($3,920) + $60.00 filing fees). 
 
CONCLUSION 
The
court grants Defendant’s motion for terminating sanctions and orders Plaintiff
to pay $3,980.00 to Defendant’s counsel.
Defendant
shall give notice.
