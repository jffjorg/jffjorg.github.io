  - "If plaintiffs respond to comprehensive interrogatories seeking all known facts with boilerplate answers that restate their allegations, or simply provide laundry lists of people and/or documents, the burden of production will almost certainly be shifted to them once defendants move for summary judgment and properly present plaintiff's factually devoid discovery responses." (Weber v. John Crane, Inc.)

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Allied's motion for summary judgment, dismissing Chaney's lawsuit alleging exposure to asbestos from Allied's products. The judge found that Chaney failed to provide admissible evidence of exposure to asbestos from Allied's products. Chaney's deposition testimony did not provide evidence of exposure, and his responses to interrogatories were factually devoid and did not identify specific products or experts. The judge also found that an expert declaration submitted by Chaney, Perry Gottesfeld, was inadmissible because it relied on hearsay evidence from a 2011 interrogatory response and a 2004 affidavit. As a result, the judge ruled that Chaney has not shown a disputed issue concerning his exposure to asbestos from Allied's products, and Allied is entitled to summary judgment.
