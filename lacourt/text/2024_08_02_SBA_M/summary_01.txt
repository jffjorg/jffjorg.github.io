And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the City of Hawthorne's motion to file a cross-complaint against Claudia Bonilla, the plaintiff, in this case. The judge finds that the cross-complaint arises out of the same transaction, occurrence, or series of transactions or occurrences as the plaintiff's complaint, and therefore, the granting of leave to file the cross-complaint is mandatory. The judge concludes that the interest of justice supports granting the motion, as it will allow all disputes between all parties to be adjudicated in one action. The judge also finds that the City of Hawthorne has met the statutory requirements for filing the cross-complaint and that there is no showing of bad faith on the part of the City of Hawthorne. The judge orders the City of Hawthorne to file and serve the proposed cross-complaint within five days of the date of the ruling and to give notice of the ruling.
