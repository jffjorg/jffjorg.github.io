And here is the English text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on United Brands Worldwide, LLC's (UB) motion for a new trial. UB seeks a new trial based on three grounds: newly discovered material evidence, irregularities by opposing counsel in the proceeding, and numerous errors of law occurring at the trial. The Judge denies all three grounds.

Firstly, the Judge finds that UB has not satisfied its burden of showing that the newly discovered evidence was not obtainable with reasonable diligence. UB's failure to present the deposition testimony of Suleminian at the hearing and its lack of argument in support of the motion for new trial are factors that weigh against granting a new trial.

Secondly, the Judge rejects UB's claim that opposing counsel misrepresented and concealed defendant's intention not to honor the agreement and the oral modification, preventing UB from having a fair trial. The Judge finds that defense counsel's statements are consistent with Suleminian's testimony and do not dispute the existence of the agreement.

Finally, the Judge denies UB's claim that the court made an error of law by ignoring the mandate under Civil Code section 1698(b) and ignoring established contract law principles. The Judge notes that there was no trial, as judgment was entered in the defendant's favor pursuant to a motion for summary judgment, and UB's motion for a new trial does not set forth any reasoned argument in moving for a new trial on these grounds.
