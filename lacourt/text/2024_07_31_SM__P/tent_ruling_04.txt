Hearing date July

Plaintiff
Giudice’s Motion for Summary Judgment/Adjudication - UNOPPOSED
 
This unlawful
detainer action is brought by plaintiff landlord Giudice against defendants
John Riley and Zander Riley. On January 15, 2020 plaintiff and defendant John
Riley entered into a written agreement to rent the premises on a month-to-month
basis for $4,588 per month. Complaint, ¶4-6. The rent was changed on February
8, 2024 to $4,863/month. Compliant, ¶ 6(d). Defendants failed to pay
outstanding rent or comply with a notice to quit. Complaint, ¶ 9(a)(6) and 19(c).
Giudice seeks possession, past due rent of $40,996, forfeiture of the rental
agreement, costs, reasonable attorneys’ fees and holdover damages of $162/day
from April 1, 2024. Complaint, ¶ 19.
 
On May 21, 2024,
defendant Zander Riley, in pro per, answered. On May 22, 2024, defendant John
Riley in pro per, answered. 
 
On July 3, 2024,
Giudice filed and served via U.S. mail this motion for summary judgment or, in
the alternative, summary adjudication on the grounds that there is no triable
issue of material fact as to any allegation of the complaint, and defendants
have no viable defense. As of July 26, 2024, the motion is unopposed. 
 
Legal
Standard/Applicable Law 
A motion for summary judgment or adjudication provides “courts with a
mechanism to cut through the parties’ pleadings in order to determine whether,
despite their allegations, trial is in fact necessary to resolve their
dispute.” Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.
It must be granted “if all the evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences
reasonably deducible from the evidence’ and uncontradicted by other inferences
or evidence, show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and
that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Adler v.
Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119, quoting Code Civ.
Proc., § 437c, subd. (c).
 
In the unlawful detainer context, “[a] motion for summary judgment may be
made at any time after the answer is filed upon giving five days notice.” Code
Civ. Proc., § 1170.7. “Service must be made by personal delivery, electronic
service, fax transmission, express mail, or other means consistent with Code of
Civil Procedure sections 1010, 1010.6, 1011, 1012, and 1013, and reasonable
calculated to ensure delivery to the other party or parties no later than the
close of business on the court day before the hearing.” Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1351(c). “The court, in its discretion, may consider written opposition
filed later.” Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1351(c). 
 
“The procedures governing a motion for summary judgment in an unlawful
detainer action are streamlined (e.g., separate statements are not required
under section 437c, subdivision (s) of the Code of Civil Procedure), but such a
motion shall be granted or denied on the same basis as a motion under [Code of
Civil Procedure s]ection 437c . . . .” Borden v. Stiles (2023) 92
Cal.App.5th 337, 344-345, quoting Code Civ. Proc., § 1170.7. “In moving for
summary judgment, a plaintiff . . . has met his burden of showing that there is
no defense to a cause of action if he has proved each element of the cause of
action entitling him to judgment on that cause of action.” Borden v. Stiles,
supra, 92 Cal.App.5th 337, 345, internal quotations omitted, citation
omitted. “Once the plaintiff . . . has met that burden, the burden shifts to
the defendant . . . to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts
exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto.” Id., internal
quotations omitted, citation omitted. 
 
Elements for an
Unlawful Detainer Based on Nonpayment of Rent 
“The basic
elements of unlawful detainer for nonpayment of rent contained in Code of Civil
Procedure section 1161, subdivision (2), are (1) the tenant is in possession of
the premises; (2) that possession is without permission; (3) the tenant is in
default for nonpayment of rent; (4) the tenant has been properly served with a
written three-day notice; and (5) the default continues after the three-day
notice period has elapsed.” Kruger v. Reyes (2014) 232 Cal.App.4th Supp.
10, 16. 
 
Giudice’s Evidence

Giudice presents
evidence defendants are in possession of the property. Giudice Decl., ¶ 23. Giudice
owns the property. Giudice Decl., ¶ 3; Ex. 1. Giudice entered into a lease with
defendant John Riley on or about January 15, 2020. Giudice Decl., ¶ 9; Ex. 5. In
January 2020 and April 2020, defendants failed to make rental payments. Giudice
Decl., ¶¶ 13-14; Ex. 6. Defendants have a balance of $60,448 for rent from
April through July 2024. Giudice Decl., ¶ 15; Ex. 6. 
 
On February 7,
2024, defendants and all occupants of the property were served with a “30-Day
Notice to Pay Rent of Quit.” Adams Decl., ¶¶ 4-5; Ex. 7. On March 6, 2024, Plaintiff’s
counsel prepared an “Offer of Conditional Extension to the 30-Day Notice to Pay
Rent or Quit” served on February 7, 2024, which extended the notice to pay or
quit by 30 days in exchange for defendants’ additional payment of $10,000.00 by
March 8, 2024. Adams Decl., ¶ 7; Ex. 21. The offer clarified that partial
payment does not constitute waiver of any rights and defendants failed to make
any additional payments after March 11, 2024. Adams Decl., ¶ 7; Ex. 21. 
 
On or about April
9, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel’s office prepared the “Notice to Quit (Without
Opportunity to Cure),” which provided three days for defendants to deliver
possession of the property, which was served on April 10, 2024. Adams Decl., ¶¶
8-9; Exs. 9-10. Defendants did not respond. Adams Decl., ¶ 10. The notice to
quit was issued because of defendants’ failure to comply with the February 7,
2024 thirty day notice to pay rent or quit. Adams Decl., ¶ 8; Ex. 9. Following
the failure to vacate after expiration of the notice to quit, Giudice filed the
complaint. Adams Decl., ¶ 11. Giudice presents evidence the 30-day notice to
pay rent or quit and subsequent notice to quit were properly served. Adams
Decl., ¶ 4; Rodriguez Decl., ¶¶ 2-3. Giudice has not received any payment from
defendants since March 11, 2024, and he did not waive, change, or cancel the
notice to quit. Giudice Decl., ¶¶ 16, 20. Giudice did not accept rental
payments from defendants after the notice to quit was served. Giudice Decl., ¶
22. As of the date of his declaration, defendants remain in possession of the
property. Giudice Decl., ¶ 23. 
 
Given that the
motion is unopposed, the Court finds defendants have conceded to all arguments
raised therein because “[c]ontetions are waived when a party fails to support
them with reasoned argument and citations to authority.” Moulton Niguel
Water Dist. v. Colombo (2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 1210, 1215. 
 
The plaintiff has
met his initial burden on summary judgment with evidence establishing each
element for his cause of action for unlawful detainer based on nonpayment of
rent. The defendants failed to oppose and failed to provide any responsive
evidence. As such, defendants have not met their burden in showing the
existence of a triable issue of material fact as to a cause of action or
defense thereto. GRANT.
