Rocket Ball, Ltd., et al. v. Able
Events Inc., Case No. 24SMCP00156 
Hearing Date: July 31, 2024 
Plaintiff Rocket Ball, Ltd.’s
Application for counsel Magni to Appear Pro Hac Vice (UNOPPOSED) 
 
Texas attorney Rocco Magni applies
to be admitted pro hac vice for plaintiffs. For the hearing on 6/27/24, Magni
submitted a declaration but was missing certain required affirmations under
Cal. Rules of Court, rule 9.40(d). The court continued the motion to allow
Magni to submit a proposed judgment as well as the missing information
regarding the date of each application for pro hac vice he has filed in the
last two years and whether it was granted as required under Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 9.40(d)(5). Magni’s subsequent application does correct the
deficiencies previously noted and includes a proposed order. The application is
unopposed. GRANTED.
