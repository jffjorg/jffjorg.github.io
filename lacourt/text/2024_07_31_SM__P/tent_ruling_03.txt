Mahfoud v.
Letizia, et al., Case No. 24SMCV00436 
Hearing Date: July
31, 2024  (continued from June 27, 2024)
Defendant Wonder
Nights, LLC’s Motion to Set Aside Default Judgment 
 
Mahfoud, in pro
per, sued defendants Letizia and Wonder Nights for failure to repay a business
loan and for locking him out of the business. Wonder Nights, LLC moves for an
order setting aside the default entered on April 9, 2024. The matter was set
for June 27, 2024, at which time defense counsel stated he did not inquire
whether his client was properly served and assumed his client had not been
served. See prior Morris decl. filed in regard to 6/27/24 hearing, paras. 4, 6.
The court continued the matter to allow defendant to give proper notice, file a
proposed answer and comply with applicable statutes. 
 
Code of Civil
Procedure section 473(b) provides the statutory framework for setting aside a
default, including
filing a proposed answer. Rules of Court, rule 3.1110(b) requires the first
page of each paper to specify “(1) The date, time, and location, if ascertainable,
of any scheduled hearing and the name of the hearing judge, if
ascertainable[.]” 
 
The court
continued this hearing to allow Wonder Nights to give proper notice, file a
proposed answer and comply with the applicable statutes. As above, counsel
Morris argued he was under the mistaken impression that his client had not been
served, so Morris did not timely file an answer. There is a strong public
policy in favor of matters being litigated on the merits, rather than being
resolved via default. The public policy, plus counsel’s explanation, are
sufficient to grant the motion to set aside.
 
Wonder Nights
filed proper notice and now its proposed answer to the complaint. Thus, the
filings comply with the court's order. GRANTED.
