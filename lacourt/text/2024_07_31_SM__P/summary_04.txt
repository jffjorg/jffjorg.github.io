Summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment in this unlawful detainer action. The motion was unopposed, and the defendants failed to provide any responsive evidence. The plaintiff has established each element of his cause of action for unlawful detainer based on nonpayment of rent, including that the defendants are in possession of the property, are in default for nonpayment of rent, and have been properly served with a written three-day notice. The Judge has found that the defendants have conceded to all arguments raised in the motion, and therefore, the defendants have not met their burden in showing the existence of a triable issue of material fact as to a cause of action or defense thereto.
