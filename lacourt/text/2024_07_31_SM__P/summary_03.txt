And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the motion of Wonder Nights, LLC to set aside the default judgment entered on April 9, 2024. The default was the result of Wonder Nights, LLC not being properly served, and counsel Morris not timely filing an answer due to a mistaken belief that the client was not served. The Judge continued the hearing to allow Wonder Nights, LLC to provide proper notice, file a proposed answer, and comply with applicable statutes. The Judge finds that the public policy favors litigating matters on the merits rather than resolving them via default, and that counsel's explanation is sufficient to grant the motion. As a result, Wonder Nights, LLC's proposed answer to the complaint is deemed filed, and the default judgment is set aside.
