And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the Pitchess motion filed by Plaintiff Bianca Alvarado to compel the City of Los Angeles to produce medical employment records of defendant Tyler Patrick Whiteman related to prior syncopal episodes. The judge found that Plaintiff failed to demonstrate good cause for the production of the records, as the party did not show a plausible factual foundation for discovery. The judge also noted that even if the records were considered, they did not establish a history of syncopal episodes or a reasonable belief that the City has the type of medical information sought. The motion is denied.
