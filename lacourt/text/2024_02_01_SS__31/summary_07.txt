And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to be relieved from deemed admissions, which were made in response to defendant's requests for admission. The plaintiff's counsel had failed to provide timely responses to the defendant's discovery requests, but claimed that this was due to mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. The judge finds that the failure to oppose the defendant's motions was the result of excusable neglect, and that the defendant will not be substantially prejudiced if the deemed admissions are withdrawn. The judge has also denied the plaintiff's request to set aside the monetary sanctions, as the plaintiff had served untimely responses to the discovery requests and had already paid the sanctions.
