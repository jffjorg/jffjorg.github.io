And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the Defendant's unopposed motion to compel the Plaintiff to provide responses to outstanding discovery requests. The Plaintiff failed to respond to the Defendant's supplemental interrogatories and demand for production of documents, despite being properly served and given multiple opportunities to respond. The Court finds that the Plaintiff's failure to respond constitutes a legitimate basis for the Defendant's motion. The Court orders the Plaintiff to serve verified responses to the outstanding discovery requests within 20 days.
