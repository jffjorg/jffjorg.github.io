The Judge's tentative ruling is regarding a motion to contest the good faith determination of a settlement between the Plaintiff, Melissa Martinez, and ABM, Advanced Building Maintenance, Inc. The settlement was for $60,000 and was reached after a slip and fall on a staircase. The Defendants, LPC West, Inc., Rockwood Capital Corporation, and Gateway El Segundo Fee Owner, LLC, filed a motion to contest the good faith of the settlement, but it has not been taken off-calendar despite them filing a notice of settlement of the entire case. The Court is unclear if the entire case has indeed settled, and is therefore withholding ruling on the motion pending clarification at the hearing. The Court encourages the parties to meet and confer to reach an agreement.
