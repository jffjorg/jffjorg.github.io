  Case Number:  20STCV45774    Hearing Date:   April 12, 2024    Dept:  27 Tentative Ruling re Blasi v. Lesky Figueroa Aguiar, et
al. and CONSOLIDATED CASES, 20 STCV45774 and others
 
Defendants seek a Court order to allow two orthopedic medical
examinations of each Plaintiff Willie Daniel Marquez and Plaintiff Woztbeli
Antonio Garcia.  Both plaintiffs have
both knee and shoulder injuries and Defendants want both Plaintiffs seen by
orthopedists for each issue.  With regard
to Plaintiff Marquez, the motion is denied. 
One orthopedist chosen by Defendants, Dr. Weinstein, is sufficient to
address the issues regarding Plaintiff Marquez. 
Plaintiff Marquez’s future care requires only injections in relation to
his shoulder.  Dr. Weinstein’s online
information demonstrates that he can sufficiently address this care, and he is
a clear expert regarding spine injuries. 

The Court is unclear from the moving papers what the
specific issues are that warrant examination by two different orthopedists
regarding Plaintiff Garcia.  Thus, the
Court will hear from the parties regarding Plaintiff Garcia.
