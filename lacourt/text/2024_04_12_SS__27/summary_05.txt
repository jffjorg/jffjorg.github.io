And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the motion of Timothy M. Ghobrial to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff Justin Freeman. The reason for withdrawal is a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship due to a considerable difference of opinion regarding the handling of the case. The judge notes that the parties have made reasonable efforts to confirm the current mailing address of the Plaintiff. The judge grants the motion, effective upon Notice on the Plaintiff. The next hearing is set for July 22, 2024, which should be sufficient time for the Plaintiff to retain new counsel.
