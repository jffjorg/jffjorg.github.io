And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the defendant's motion for summary judgment. The defendant, Fleet Lease, sought to dismiss the plaintiffs' claims, alleging that it was not negligent in maintaining the truck involved in the accident. The court found that the defendant failed to meet its burden of showing that the plaintiffs' claims had no merit. The court also found that the plaintiffs had raised triable issues of fact, including the defendant's duty to maintain the truck and the causation of the accident. The court further found that the defendant failed to present evidence regarding causation and thus failed to uphold its burden. The case will proceed to trial.
