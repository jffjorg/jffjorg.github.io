Background
On March 5, 2021,
Plaintiff filed the present auto accident case. On October 3, 2022, Defendants
SALVADOR TAPIA and PATRICIA MOLINA served Plaintiff with the Request for
Production, Set One, Special Interrogatories, Set One, and Form
Interrogatories, Set One. Plaintiff's Responses were due on November 7, 2022.
In December 2023 and January 2024, Defendants sent Plaintiff several emails
requesting the overdue responses. However, as of February 20, 2024, no
responses were provided, and Defendants now move the Court to compel Plaintiff
to provide the discovery responses at issue. No opposition has been filed.
Legal
Standard
A plaintiff may make a demand for
production of documents and propound interrogatories without leave of court at
any time 10 days after the service of the summons on, or appearance by, the
party to whom the demand is directed, whichever occurs first. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.020, subd. (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.020, subd. (b).) The demand for
production of documents is not limited by number, but the request must comply
with the formatting requirements in Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.030. A party
may propound 35 specially prepared interrogatories that are relevant to the
subject matter of the pending action and any additional number of official form
interrogatories that are relevant to the subject matter of the pending action.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.030, subd. (a)(1) - (a)(2).)
 
The party whom the request is
propounded upon is required to respond within 30 days after service of a
demand, but the parties are allowed to informally agree to an extension and
confirm any such agreement in writing. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260, subd. (a);
Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.270, subd. (a)
- (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.270, subd. (a) - (b).)
 
If a party fails to timely respond
to a request for production or interrogatories, the party to whom the request
is directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under
Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.230, and waives any objection, including one based on
privilege or on the protection for work product. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300,
subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).)¿¿The party propounding the
discovery requests may move for an order compelling responses. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (b).) Unlike a motion to compel further discovery responses, a
motion to compel initial discovery responses does not have any meet and confer
requirements.
 
Code of Civil Procedure section
2023.030, subdivision (a) provides, in pertinent part, that the court may
impose a monetary sanction on a party engaging in the misuse of the discovery
process to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by
anyone as a result of that conduct. A misuse of the discovery process includes
failing to respond or submit to an authorized method of discovery. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d).)¿¿¿A court has discretion to fix the amount of reasonable
monetary sanctions. (Cornerstone Realty Advisors, LLC v. Summit Healthcare
Reit, Inc. (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th 771, 791.)
¿¿¿¿ 
Analysis
 
It is undisputed that Plaintiff
did not serve timely initial discovery responses. Plaintiff did not file an
opposition challenging the service of the discovery requests, nor did Plaintiff
indicate that the discovery responses at issue had been served prior to the
hearing. Consequently, Defendants’ motions to compel are GRANTED, and Plaintiff
is ORDERED to submit verified discovery responses without objections within 30
days from today.
 
Sanctions 
 
Defendants request sanctions in
the amount of $560.00 for each motion. The court finds this amount reasonable.
Consequently, the Court sanctions Plaintiff in the amount of $1680. Plaintiff
and her counsel are ORDERED, jointly and severally, to pay sanctions of $1680
to Defendants within 20 days of today’s date.
 
PLEASE TAKE NOTICE:¿¿¿¿¿ 
 
If a party
intends to submit on this tentative ruling, the party must send an email to
the court at sscdept27@lacourt.org with the Subject line “SUBMIT”
followed by the case number.  The body of
the email must include the hearing date and time, counsel’s contact
information, and the identity of the party submitting.        
 
Unless all parties submit by email to this
tentative ruling, the parties should arrange to appear remotely (encouraged) or
in person for oral argument.  You should
assume that others may appear at the hearing to argue.
 
If the
parties neither submit nor appear at hearing, the Court may take the motion off
calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the Court.  After the Court has issued a
tentative ruling, the Court may prohibit the withdrawal of the subject motion
without leave.
