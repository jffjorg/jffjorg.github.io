And here is the English text summarizing the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge grants the plaintiff's motion to deem the Request for Admissions (RFA), Set One, admitted. The defendant failed to serve a timely response to the RFA, despite being granted extensions and allowed to preserve objections. The Judge finds that the defendant's counsel has not resolved the representation issue with the defendant's carrier and has not served a response in substantial compliance prior to the hearing. The Judge orders the defendant and counsel to pay sanctions of $1,250.00 and orders them to pay the sanctions within 20 days. The Judge also grants the plaintiff's request for sanctions.
