On October 12, 2021,
Plaintiff filed the current auto accident case. On February 20, Plaintiff sent
Defendant Avis a deposition subpoena for the custodian of records and requested
various document production at the deposition. On March 1, 2024, Defendant
noticed Plaintiff’s PMK depositions on 5 different categories and requested
document production. Defendant now moves the Court for a protective order.
As a preliminary
issue, deposition subpoenas to the custodian of records are directed at
non-parties. (See Naser v. Lakeridge Athletic Club (2014) 227
Cal.App.4th 571, 576–577; CCP § 2020.010.) If Plaintiff seeks documents, it is
through a request for production under CCP § 2031.010. Plaintiff can also depose
Defendant’s PMK on categories related to Defendant’s policies in managing the
documents. This can be accomplished through a notice of deposition without the
need for a subpoena.
A motion for a
protective order “shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under
Section 2016.040.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.090.) “A meet and confer
declaration in support of a motion shall state facts showing a reasonable and
good faith attempt at an informal resolution of each issue presented by the
motion.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2016.040.)
 
“The Discovery Act requires
that, prior to the initiation of a motion to compel, the moving party declare
that he or she has made a¿serious attempt¿to obtain an informal resolution
of each issue.”¿¿(Stewart v. Colonial Western Agency, Inc.¿(2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 1006, 1016.) Moving party has
burden of initiation. (Volkswagenwerk Aktiengesellshaft v. Superior Court
(1981), 122 Cal.App.3d 326 330.) Meet and confer is designed “to
encourage the parties to work out their differences informally so as to avoid
the necessity for a formal order.”¿¿(McElhaney v. Cessna Aircraft Co.¿(1982) 134 Cal.App.3d 285, 289.) “This, in turn, will lessen the burden on
the court and reduce the unnecessary expenditure of resources by litigants through
promotion of informal, extrajudicial resolution of discovery disputes.”¿(Townsend v. Superior Court¿(1998) 61 Cal.App.4th 1431,
1435.)¿ “A determination of whether an attempt at
informal resolution is adequate . . . involves the exercise of discretion.”¿(Stewart (2001) 87 Cal.App.4th at 1016.)¿“The history of the litigation, the nature of
the interaction between counsel, the nature of the issues, the type and scope
of discovery requested, the prospects for success and other similar factors can
be relevant.”¿(Id.)
 
"Meet and confer" or
"confer" means to communicate directly and discuss in good faith the
issue(s) required under the particular Rule or order… such communication may take place by
telephone. The mere sending of a written, electronic, or voice-mail
communication, however, does not satisfy a requirement to "meet and
confer" or to "confer." Rather, this requirement can be
satisfied only through direct dialogue and discussion — either in a face-to-
face meeting or in a telephone conversation. (Phleger v. Countrywide Home
Loans, Inc., No. C 07-1686 SBA, 5 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 24, 2007))
 
Defendant's meet
and confer declaration indicates the meet and confer process consisted solely
of a letter sent to Plaintiff without further detail on the meet and confer
process. The letter requested Plaintiff to withdraw the notice or face a
protective order. Defendant’s approach does not facilitate an interactive
process for the parties to engage in meaningful dialogue about the scope of the
deposition and it lacks the necessary collaborative effort envisioned by the good
faith "meet and confer" requirement. A moving
party must demonstrate a serious attempt to meet and confer in good faith,
which requires either a phone call or a face-to -face meeting.
 
Accordingly, Defendant’s motion to
compel is DENIED without prejudice and Parties are ORDERED to meet and confer
on the scope of the PMK categories.
