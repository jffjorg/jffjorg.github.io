The new Trial Date is set for November 2024, and the Final Status Conference is continued to the same date. The Court considers the following factors in granting the continuance: proximity of the trial date, previous continuances, length of the continuance, availability of alternative means, prejudice to parties or witnesses, and the parties' stipulation."
