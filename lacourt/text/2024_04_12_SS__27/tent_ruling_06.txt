Case No./Name.:      21STCV33836 NADIA ELFOURARI vs CITY OF SANTA
MONICA 
Motion Name:           Motion to Compel PMK Deposition
Moving Party:           Plaintiff
Responding Party:    Unopposed
Notice:                     Sufficient 
¿¿¿¿ 
Ruling:                     MOTION TO COMPEL PMK DEPOSITION IS DENIED. 
 
Background 
 
On September 14, 2021, Plaintiff filed the
present auto accident case. Plaintiff noticed Defendant's PMK deposition
several times, but Defendant objected on the basis of unavailability each time.
The latest deposition notice scheduled a deposition for March 22, 2024.
However, on March 15, 2024, Defendant served an objection citing
unavailability. Plaintiff now moves the Court to compel Defendant's PMK
deposition. The current trial date is April 25, 2024, and the last day to hear
a discovery motion was April 10, 2024.
 
Legal Standard and Analysis
 
Pursuant to CCP § 2024.020, "except as
otherwise provided in this section, any party shall be entitled as a matter of
right … to have motions concerning discovery heard on or before the 15th day,
before the date initially set for the trial of the action. A continuance or
postponement of the trial date does not operate to reopen discovery
proceedings." When the hearing for a discovery motion is
held after the discovery motion hearing cut-off date, the Court cannot grant a
motion to compel without first deciding on a motion to reopen discovery. (Pelton-Shepherd
Industries, Inc. v. Delta Packaging Products, Inc. (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th
1568, 1588.)
 
“The
purpose of imposing a time limit on discovery is to expedite and facilitate
trial preparation and to prevent delay.¿ Without a cutoff date, the parties could
tie up each other and the trial court in discovery and discovery disputes right
up to the eve of trial or beyond. Furthermore, . . . to be effective the cutoff
date must be firm or some litigants will manipulate the proceedings to avoid
the cut-off date.”¿ (Beverly Hosp. v. Superior Court¿(1993) 19 Cal.App.4th
1289, 1295.)
 
The current trial date is April 25, 2024.
Consequently, the discovery cut-off date was March 26, 2024, and the final date
to hear a discovery motion was on or before April 10, 2024. The motion
concerning discovery at issue is scheduled to be heard on April 12, 2024.
 
When the hearing for a discovery motion is
held after the discovery motion hearing cut-off date, the Court cannot grant a
motion to compel without first deciding on a motion to reopen discovery. (Pelton-Shepherd
Industries, Inc. v. Delta Packaging Products, Inc. (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th
1568, 1588.) No such motion has been filed. Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion to
compel is DENIED.
