And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling denies the plaintiff's motion to compel the defendant's PMK deposition. The plaintiff filed the auto accident case on September 14, 2021, and noticed the defendant's PMK deposition several times, but the defendant objected each time. The latest deposition notice scheduled a deposition for March 22, 2024, but on March 15, 2024, the defendant served an objection citing unavailability. The plaintiff now moves the court to compel the defendant's PMK deposition. The court rules that when the hearing for a discovery motion is held after the discovery motion hearing cut-off date, the court cannot grant a motion to compel without first deciding on a motion to reopen discovery. Since no such motion has been filed, the plaintiff's motion to compel is denied.
