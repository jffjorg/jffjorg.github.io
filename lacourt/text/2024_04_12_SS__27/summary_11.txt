And here is the English text summarizing the Judge's tentative ruling:

The court has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendant's motion for terminating sanctions. The plaintiff, Jaheim Martin, filed a dog bite case and the defendant, Malin Asset Management, propounded initial discovery. The plaintiff served timely responses, but the defendant requested further responses. The plaintiff's attorney withdrew from the case, and the plaintiff became pro per. The defendant moved for terminating sanctions, citing the plaintiff's failure to provide further responses. The court notes that the plaintiff is possibly handling a lawsuit for the first time and has not shown a history of discovery abuses. The court concludes that terminating sanctions are not warranted at this time, but the defendant may be able to request more severe sanctions in the future if the plaintiff fails to comply with court orders.
