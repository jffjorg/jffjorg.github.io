Background
On April 26, 2023,
Plaintiff Jaheim Martin filed the present dog bite case. On June 23, 2023,
Defendant Charlavonna M. Barrett propounded initial discovery on Plaintiff,
including Special Interrogatories (Set One). Following a few extensions,
Plaintiff served timely responses on August 29, 2023. On September 7, 2023,
Defendant served a meet and confer letter requesting further responses to the
discovery propounded. Subsequently, Plaintiff's attorney withdrew from the
case, leaving Plaintiff to proceed pro per. On October 10, 2023, Defendant filed
a Motion to Compel Plaintiff Jaheim Martin’s Further Responses to Special
Interrogatories (Set One). On November 30, 2023, the Court granted Defendant's
motion ordering Plaintiff to serve further responses within 30 days. On
December 8, 2023, notice of this ruling was served on Plaintiff. As of March 4,
2024, Plaintiff has not provided the required further responses, leading
Defendant to move the Court for terminating sanctions.
Legal Standard
The Civil Discovery Act provides
for an escalating and “incremental approach to discovery sanctions, starting
with monetary sanctions and ending with the ultimate sanction of termination.”
(Lopez v. Watchtower Bible & Tract Society of New York, Inc.¿(2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 566, 604.)¿Discovery sanctions should be
appropriate to and commensurate with the misconduct, and they “should not
exceed that which is required to protect the interests of the party entitled to
but denied discovery.” (Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc.¿(2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 967, 992.)
“If a lesser sanction fails to curb misuse, a greater sanction is warranted:
continuing misuses of the discovery process warrant incrementally harsher
sanctions until the sanction is reached that will curb the abuse.” (Ibid.;
see also, e.g.,¿Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem¿(2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 262,
279-280.)
 
The primary purpose of discovery
sanctions is to obtain compliance with the Civil Discovery Act and the Court’s
orders. It is not to punish. (Newland v. Super. Ct.¿(1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 608, 613;¿Ghanooni v. Super Shuttle of Los
Angeles¿(1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 256, 262.) A discovery sanction
should not create a “windfall” for a party or place a party in a better
position than it would have been if the opposing party had simply complied with
its obligations under the Court’s orders and the Civil Discovery Act. (Rutledge
v. Hewlett-Packard Co.¿(2015) 238 Cal.App.4th 1164, 1194; see also 2 Weil
& Brown, California Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The
Rutter Group 2023), ¶¶¿8:2214-2220.)
 
Analysis
Defendant requested only terminating sanctions
however The Civil Discovery Act provides for an escalating and “incremental
approach to discovery sanctions, starting with monetary sanctions and ending
with the ultimate sanction of termination.” (Lopez v. Watchtower Bible &
Tract Society of New York, Inc. (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 566, 604.) Defendant did
not present evidence of Plaintiff having prior sanctions, a history of
discovery abuses, or a record of disobeying court orders. What the evidence
does show is that Plaintiff recently became pro per and is possibly handling a
lawsuit for the first time. This in itself does not justify terminating
sanctions nor does it necessarily indicate a propensity for future discovery
abuses. Obviously, if Plaintiff fails to comply with other court orders, more
severe sanctions may be warranted. But at this time, Defendant’s request
for terminating sanctions is DENIED.
