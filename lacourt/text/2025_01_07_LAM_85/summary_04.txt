And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a petition by Sorensen to judicially notice certain documents and to review the Commission's opposition to his application for an expedited briefing schedule. The judge notes that there is no need to judicially notice the documents, as the court can always consider documents from the pending case file. The judge also points out that the Commission's opposition does not object to the lack of a return, which means that the Commission's new decision may not be properly before the court. The judge further notes that the Commission's conclusion about the video is inconsistent with Sorensen's testimony and that the failure of any decision-maker to view the video may be better described as a failure of proof rather than a mitigating fact. The judge is considering these issues as part of its determination of the mitigating fact.
