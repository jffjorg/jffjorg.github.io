Jablin points out that Mabus’ opposition follows a pattern of untimeliness and
procedural failure in this case.  Reply
at 2.  Mabus also failed to provide the
court with a courtesy copy of her opposition in violation of the Presiding
Judge’s First Amended General Order re: Electronic Filing.  Jablin argues that the court should not
consider the opposition and the court generally has not done so, except to note
its existence.

requests judicial notice of Mabus’ motion for attorney fees in Mabus v.
Culver City, et al., (“Mabus I”) LASC 21STCP04028 (Real Party RJN Ex.
1).  The request is granted.  Evid. Code §452(d).

Jablin contends that he meets the other elements of section 1021.5 and relies
on Mabus’ fee motion in Mabus I to argue that she is estopped from denying
that fact.   Mabus argues that Jablin
does not meet these elements, particularly that he did not confer a significant
benefit on a parge class of persons or the general public and that the issue
did not require private enforcement because the City was capable of defending
without Jablin’s support.  The court need
not decide these issues.
