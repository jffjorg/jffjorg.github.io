Cynthia Mabus v. Culver
City, et al., 23STCP03011  
Tentative decision on motion for attorney’s fees:   denied



 
 
            Real
Party-in-Interest Craig Jablin (“Real Party” or “Jablin”) moves for an award of $9,602.25 in attorney fees from Petitioner Cynthia Mabus
(“Mabus”).  
            The
court has read and considered the moving papers, opposition,[1]
and reply, and renders the following tentative decision. 
 
A. Statement of
the Case
1. First Amended
Petition
On August 18, 2023, Petitioner Mabus filed the Petition
alleging a cause of action for administrative mandamus against the City.  The operative pleading is the First Amended
Petition (“FAP”) filed on January 16, 2024 and alleging in pertinent part as
follows.
 
a.  Petitioner’s
Request for Parkway Tree Removal
Petitioner Mabus owns the property located at 10729/10731
Northgate Street, Culver City (the “Property”). 
FAP, ¶6.  Two trees located on
public property directly adjacent to the Property are known problem species
trees and are too large for the area in which they are located.  FAP, ¶7. 
These problem trees have caused substantial damage to Petitioner’s improvement
on the Property, the Property itself, and public property.  FAP, ¶7. 

On October 1, 2019, Petitioner filed a request for a parkway
tree removal of the two trees (the “Request”) with the Culver City Public Works
Department-Maintenance Operations Division (“Public Works”) pursuant to Culver
City Municipal Code (“CCMC”) section 9.08.210.B.  FAP, ¶8. 
Tree removal is required under CCMC section 9.08.210.c.2.b.-.c if a tree
meets either of the following conditions: 
(1) the tree roots are creating extensive and repeated damage to public
and/or private infrastructure, including sidewalks, sewer lines or other
utility lines, but a history of sewer blockages does not alone provide
sufficient reason for tree removal and rather suggests the need for sewer
repair and/or (2) the tree is creating a public or private nuisance.  FAP, ¶8.
After an arborist inspected the two trees, Public Works
determined that both trees exhibit potential for major branch failure and need
to be removed.  FAP, ¶10.  On February 25, 2020, Public Works provided
notice to the public pursuant to CCMC section 9.08.21.E that Petitioner’s
Request to remove the trees had been granted. 
FAP, ¶11.
 
b.  Jablin’s Appeal
Pursuant to CCMC section 9.08.210(F), any party wishing to
reverse a decision by Public Works must submit an appeal in writing.  Pursuant to that same section, “[a]ppeals
shall be heard by the City Council, which shall affirm the decision of the
Public Works Director, unless the appellant demonstrates, by substantial
evidence, that the decision is based on error in fact or dispute findings.  The decision of the appeal shall be final.”  FAP, ¶12.
On March 2, 2020, City resident Jablin appealed the Public
Works decision to remove the two trees. 
FAP, ¶13.  Jablin admitted in his
written appeal that the two trees “over many years, have caused damage to the
road surface and the sidewalk and meet the criteria in the City code for
potential removal.”  FAP, ¶14.
On August 10, 2020, the City Council held the initial
hearing on Jablin’s appeal.  FAP,
¶15.  The City Council voted to delay the
appeal to allow for potential resolution to be worked on by the City, Jablin,
and Petitioner.  FAP, ¶15.
On October 11, 2021, the City Council again held the hearing
on Jablin’s appeal of the Public Work’s decision to remove the trees. FAP,
¶16.  At the hearing, neither Jablin nor
any other party provided any substantial evidence or testimony showing that
Public Work’s decision to remove the trees was based on error in fact or
disputed findings.  FAP, ¶17.  On October 11, 2021, despite the lack of any
evidence that would support reversal of the Public Works decision to remove the
trees, the City Council voted to grant Jablin’s appeal.  FAP, ¶18. 

 
c. Mabus v. Culver City (“Mabus I”)
Petitioner filed a mandamus petition from the City Council’s
decision to grant Jablin’s appeal and reverse the decision of Public Works to
remove the two trees.  FAP, ¶20.  The mandamus petition was granted and
judgment was rendered in Petitioner’s favor on March 15, 2023.  FAP, ¶20. 

 
d. The City Council’s May 22, 2023 Resolution
In response to the writ, on May 22, 2023, the City Council
held a public hearing and adopted Resolution No. 2023-R033 (the “Resolution”)
setting aside the October 11, 2021 decision reversing the Public Works’
decision to remove the trees.  FAP, ¶21.
 
e.  Request for
Relief
Petitioner maintains that the Resolution is erroneous and
improper in that the City Council prepared and considered new and additional
evidence in coming to its conclusions. 
FAP, ¶22.  The Resolution does not
conform to, and is in violation of, the judgment in Mabus I.  FAP, ¶23. 
The Property and Petitioner have been harmed by the trees and will
continue to be harmed.
 
2.  Course of
Proceedings
Petitioner filed the Petition on August 18, 2023.  Petitioner served Respondents City and City
Council on August 23, 2023.  
The Petition did not name Jablin as a Real Party.  The court held trial setting conferences on
November 27, December 14, and January 9, 2024, and ordered Petitioner to name
Jablin as a Real Party.  
On January 16, 2024, Petitioner filed the FAP naming Jablin
as Real Party.  Petitioner served Jablin
with the FAP on January 21, 2024.  
On March 12, 2024, the City filed its Answer to the
FAP.  On March 15, 2024, Jablin filed his
Answer to the FAP.
On July 3, 2024, the court denied Petitioner’s ex parte
application to exceed the page limits of CRC 3.1113(d).  
            On August 6, 2024, the
court denied Petitioner’s FAP.  
 
B. Applicable Law
            “[A]s a
general rule, attorney fees are not recoverable as costs unless they are
authorized by statute or agreement.”  People ex rel. Dept. of
Corporations v. Speedee Oil Change Systems, Inc., (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th
424, 429. 
CCP section 1021.5 (“section 1021.5”) codifies the “private
attorney general” exception to the general rule that each side bears its own
fees unless the parties contracted otherwise. 
See CCP §1021.  Section 1021.5 permits a trial court to award
fees to a successful party in any action where it has been established that (1)
plaintiff’s action has resulted in the enforcement of an important right affecting
the public interest, (2) a significant benefit, whether pecuniary or
nonpecuniary, has been conferred on the general public or a large class of
persons, and (3) the necessity and financial burden of private enforcement are
such as to make the award appropriate.  Conservatorship
of Whitley, (2010) 50 Cal.4th 1206, 1214.  The burden is on the party requesting section
1021.5 fees to demonstrate all elements of the statute, including that the
litigation costs, transcend his or her personal interest.  Millview
County Water Dist. v. State Water Resources Control Bd.,  (2016) 4
Cal.App.5th 759, 769.  The issue is committed
to the trial court’s discretion.  Ibid.
Courts take a “broad,
pragmatic view of what constitutes a ‘successful party’” in order to effectuate
the policy underlying section 1021.5.  Graham v. DaimlerChrysler Corp., (“Graham”) (2004) 34 Cal.4th
553, 565.  The party seeking attorney
fees need not prevail on all of its alleged claims in order to qualify for an
award.  Harbor
v. Deukmejian, (1987) 43 Cal.3d
1078, 1103; Daniels v. McKinney, (1983) 146 Cal.App.3d 42, 55.  The party is considered “successful” under section
1021.5 if the litigation “contributed substantially to remedying the conditions
at which it was directed.” Planned Parenthood v.
Aakhus, (“Aakhus”) (1993)
14 Cal.App.4th 162, 174.  In other words,
the “successful” party under section 1021.5 is the party that succeeds on “any
significant issue in litigation which achieves some of the benefit the parties
sought in bringing suit.”  Maria P. v. Riles,
(“Maria P.”) (1987) 43 Cal.3d 1281, 1292; see Tipton-Whittingham v. City of Los
Angeles, (2004) 34 Cal.4th 604,
610.  Prevailing counsel who qualify for
an award under section 1021.5 are entitled to compensation for all hours
reasonably spent.  Serrano v. Unruh,
(1982) 32 Cal.3d 621, 632–33.
Unlike the separate
substantial benefit doctrine, “the ‘significant benefit’ that will justify an
attorney fee award need not represent a ‘tangible’ asset or a ‘concrete’ gain
but, in some cases, may be recognized simply from the effectuation of a fundamental
constitutional or statutory policy.” Woodland Hills Residents Assn., Inc. v. City Council, (1979)
23 Cal.3d 917, 939.  “[T]he benefit may be conceptual or doctrinal
and need not be actual or concrete; further, the effectuation of a statutory or
constitutional purpose may be sufficient.” 
Braude v. Automobile Club of Southern Cal., (1986) 178 Cal.App.3d 994, 1011.  Moreover, the extent of the public benefit
need not be great to justify an attorney fee award.  See,
e.g., Protect Our Water v. County of Merced, (2005) 130 Cal.App.4th 488, 496 (significant
public benefit where litigation prompted agency to improve methods of creating
and managing its CEQA records). The trial court determines “the significance of
the benefit, as well as the size of the class receiving benefit, from a
realistic assessment, in light of all the pertinent circumstances, of the gains
which have resulted in a particular case.” 
Woodland Hills, supra, 23 Cal.3d at 939-40.
The party seeking
attorney’s fees must show that the necessity for pursuing the lawsuit placed a
burden on the plaintiff “out of proportion to his individual stake in the
matter.” Woodland Hills, supra, 23 Cal. 3d at 941.  Although cases refer to this requirement as
the “financial burden” criterion, nothing in the language of CCP section 1021.5
limits the consideration of the necessity and financial burden clause to solely
financial interests.  Hammond v. Agran,
(2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 115, 125.  “The
idea is that the litigation for which fees are claimed must transcend one's
interests, whether pecuniary or not.”  Id. at 127.  The question is whether advancement of the
public interest was merely coincidental to the attainment of the party’s
personal goals.  Bowman
v. City of Berkeley, (2005)
131 Cal.App.4th 173, 181.  The party
seeking attorney fees bears the burden of establishing that its litigation
costs transcend its personal interests.  Save Open Space Santa Monica Mountains v. Superior Court, (2000) 84 Cal.App.4th 235, 247.  The trial court's application of the
financial burden criterion involves a “realistic and practical comparison of
the litigant's personal interest with the cost of suit.” Families Unafraid to Uphold Rural El Dorado
County v. Bd. of Supervisors, (2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 505, 515.
            The prevailing party bears the burden of proof as to the
reasonableness of any fee claim.  CCP §1033.5(c)(5).  This burden
requires competent evidence as to the nature and value of the services
rendered.  Martino v. Denevi, (1986) 182 Cal.App.3d 553, 559. 
“Testimony of an attorney as to the number of hours worked on a particular case
is sufficient evidence to support an award of attorney fees, even in the
absence of detailed time records.” Id.  “‘The reasonable market
value of the attorney's services is the measure of a reasonable hourly
rate.  This standard applies regardless of whether the attorneys claiming
fees charge nothing for their services, charge at below-market or discounted
rates, represent the client on a straight contingent fee basis, or are in-house
counsel.’”  Center For Biological Diversity v. County of San Bernardino,
(2010) 188 Cal.App.4th 603, 619 (citations omitted). 
            In determining whether the requested attorney’s fees are
reasonable, the court’s “first step involves the lodestar figure—a calculation
based on the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the lawyer’s
hourly rate.  The lodestar figure may then be adjusted, based on
consideration of facts specific to the case, in order to fix the fee at the
fair market value for the legal services provided.”  Gorman v.
Tassajara Development Corp., (2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 770, 774 (“Gorman”). 
In adjusting the lodestar figure, the court may consider the nature and
difficulty of the litigation, the amount of money involved, the skill required
and employed to handle the case, the attention given, the success or failure,
and other circumstances in the case. EnPalm LLC v. Teitler, (2008) 162
Cal.App.4th 770, 774; see also PLCM Group, Inc. v. Drexler,
(2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095. 
 
            C. Statement of Facts[2]
            1.
Jablin’s Evidence
            Richard W. Davis, Esq. (“Davis”) is
the attorney for Real Party Jablin. 
Davis Decl., ¶1.  He has been
practicing civil litigation in California since 1992.  Davis Decl., ¶4.  Davis billed his time to Jablin at a
discounted hourly rate of $295.00.  Davis
Decl., ¶4.  
            To date, Davis has expended 19.7
hours in connection with the litigation and the fee motion.  Davis Decl., ¶5, Ex. C.  The invoices reflect 18.2 hours of attorney
time expended in the proceeding.  Davis
Decl., ¶5, Ex. C.  Based on a discounted
hourly rate of $295.00, the total attorneys’ fees incurred to date by Jablin in
the litigation total $5,811.50.  Davis
Decl., ¶5, Ex. C.  
            Davis anticipates spending at least two
additional hours reviewing any opposition to the fee motion, drafting a reply,
and attending a hearing on the motion. 
Davis Decl., ¶6.  Therefore, he
expects Jablin to incur additional attorneys’ fees of at least $590.00.  Davis Decl., ¶6.  
            Davis is aware that Mabus’ fee motion
in Mabus I sought a 1.5 multiplier to her attorneys’ hourly rates given
the complexity of the issues raised. 
Davis Decl., ¶7.  Davis is also
informed and believes that he has been practicing approximately six years
longer than Petitioner’s most senior counsel, Peter Sunukjian, Esq.  Davis Decl., ¶7.  
            After applying a 1.5 multiplier to
Davis’ rates, the total attorneys’ fees incurred to date in this proceeding
total $8,717.25.  Davis Decl., ¶8.  After applying a 1.5 multiplier to the
additional two hours Davis expects to bill in connection with drafting a reply
and attending a hearing on the fee motion, the total future attorneys’ fees
total $885.00.  Davis Decl., ¶8.  The total fees sought are $9,602.25.  Davis Decl., ¶8.  
 
            2. Mabus’ Evidence 
            On November 4, 2024, Petitioner
Mabus’ counsel, Jeffrey Weber, Esq. (“Weber”), was served via email with Real
Party Jablin’s motion for attorney fees. 
Weber Decl., ¶2.  The hearing was
scheduled for January 7, 2025.  Weber
Decl., ¶2.  Due to a calendaring mistake,
Weber inadvertently calendared the opposition to be filed by no later than
December 27, 2024.  Weber Decl., ¶3.  It was not until he was about to file the
opposition that he realized he had mis-calendared the date the opposition was
due.  Weber Decl., ¶3.  Due to Weber’s mistake, the opposition was
filed two days late.  Weber Decl.,
¶4.  
 
            D. Analysis
            Real Party Jablin moves for an award of $9,602.25 in attorney fees from Petitioner Mabus.  The court has no difficulty with Jablin’s
requested lodestar or total fee request. 
However, he does not show entitlement to a fee award.
Jablin correctly
notes (Mot. at 6-7) that section 1021.5 attorney fees are available not only to
the party who initiates litigation but also to respondents and real
parties-in-interest who successfully defend such litigation.  Refusing a fee award to a real party who
satisfies the requirements of section 1021.5 would have a chilling effect on
citizens’ willingness to advocate for the public interest.  Hull v. Rossi, (1993) 13 Cal.App.4th
1763, 1769.
The threshold issue
is whether Jablin was actually a real party who could be entitled to attorney
fees.  The court ordered Mabus to
add Jablin as a real party.  Mabus untimely
named Jablin as a Respondent or Real Party on January 16, 2024.  At trial, Mabus
argued that there was a legitimate question whether Jablin is actually a real party-in-interest,
defined in a mandate proceeding as a person or entity with an interest that will
be directly affected by the proceeding.  Rudisill
v California Coastal Comm'n, (2019) 35 Cal.App.5th 1062, 1072.  Mabus noted that Jablin has no personal interest
that will be directly affected by these proceedings.  He does not own the trees at issue and does
not even live on the block where the trees are located.  
Despite this argument, the court found Jablin to be a
necessary party within the meaning of CCP section 389(a).  He lives near Marcus and the City Council
granted his appeal from the former Director’s decision to remove the
trees.  He claimed an interest relating
to the subject of the action and was so situated that the disposition of the
action in his absence may have, as a practical matter, impaired or impeded his
ability to protect that interest.  Jablin
was a necessary party, which is why the court ordered Marcus to name him as a
Real Party. 
However, the court did not find Jablin to be an
indispensable party within the meaning of CCP section 389(b).  It was true that he filed the administrative
appeal, a judgment rendered in his absence might have been prejudicial to him,
and the judgment could not be shaped to avoid that prejudice.  However, a judgment rendered in Jablin’s
absence would be adequate because the City can be relied upon to protect his
interests, which are co-extensive.  See
TG Oceanside, L.P. v. City of Oceanside, supra, 156 Cal.App.4th
at 1365-66.  As a consequence, the court
did not dismiss the FAP for failing to timely name and serve Jablin.  Jablin was a necessary, but not
indispensable, party for the case.  
While real parties
may be entitled to attorney fees under section 1021.5, amicus curiae are
not.  Connerly v. State Personnel
Board, (“Connerly”) (2006) 37 Cal.4th 1169, 1177.  In Connerly, the court considered the
litigation conduct of a non-profit organization (California Business Council)
which filed motions and actively participated in the case.  Id. at 1173-74.  In deciding whether the non-profit could be
liable to the petitioner for attorneys’ fees as an opposing party under section
1021.5, the court noted that the opposing party for purposes of section 1021.5
attorney’s fees generally is the defendant person or agency sued which is
responsible for initiating and maintaining actions or polices that are deemed
harmful to the public interest and gave rise to the litigation.  Id. at 1176-77.  The non-profit did not meet this
standard.  Id. at 1177.  Nor was it a real party-in-interest, because
a real party is “a person or entity whose interest will be directly affected by
the proceeding.”  Id. at
1178.  A real party may be the person or
entity in whose favor the public agency’s policy operates or having a direct
interest in the result.  Id.  The non-profit’s only interest was
ideological or policy, which was insufficient. 
Connerly noted that “no court has held that active participation
alone, without a direct interest in litigation, can be grounds for awarding
section 1021.5 fees.”  Id. at
1181.  Despite its participation in the
litigation, the non-profit was an amicus curiae not liable for section
1021.5 fees.  Id. at 1182-83.
In Vosburg v.
County of Fresno, (2020) 54 Cal.App.5th 439, as part of
its analysis that an unincorporated association was a de facto intervenor for
purposes of section 1021.5 fee award, the court explained the difference
between a successful party under section 1021.5 and amicus curiae.  Id. at 457-58.  A successful party may be a plaintiff,
defendant, or real party-in-interest.  Id.
at 457.  In contrast to a real party, amicus
curiae “generally are not entitled to fees under section 1021.5 because
they are not parties.  Id. at
457-58.  Under California law, an
intervenor (de facto or de jure) becomes a party with the same procedural
rights and remedies as the original parties. 
Id. at 458.  Leave to
appear as an amicus curiae is not the full equivalent of
intervention.  Unlike intervenors, amicus
curiae are confined to legal argument, cannot plead or offer evidence, and
cannot appeal from an adverse decision.  Id.
at 462 (citing Witkin).
Jablin was not an amicus curiae because he had the
right of full participation in the case. 
He was a real party-in-interest. 
Nonetheless, he is not entitled to an attorney fee award under section
1021.5 because he has not shown that he is a successful party.  Courts
take a “broad, pragmatic view of what constitutes a ‘successful party’” in
order to effectuate the policy underlying section 1021.5.  Graham, supra, 34 Cal.4th at 565.  A real party is considered “successful” under section
1021.5 if the litigation “contributed substantially to remedying the conditions
at which it was directed.” Aakhus, supra, 14 Cal.App.4th at
174.  In other words, the successful
party under section 1021.5 is the party that succeeds on “any significant issue
in litigation which achieves some of the benefit the parties sought in bringing
suit.”  Maria P., supra, 43
Cal.3d at 1292; see Tipton-Whittingham v. City of Los Angeles, supra, 34 Cal.4th at 610.
Jablin argues that he
was a successful party because the Judgment refers to him and the City as the
prevailing parties.  A successful party
under section 1021.5 is synonymous with prevailing party.  Graham, supra, 34 Cal.4th
at 571.  Mot. at 7; Reply at 3.  Since the Judgment refers to him as a
prevailing party, Jablin argues that it is a waste of time to address the issue
further.  He adds that he successfully
showed that he was untimely added to the case even though the court did not
dismiss the case because he was not indispensable.  He disputes Mabus’ contention that he should
not be considered a successful party simply because he joined the City’s other
arguments.  Reply at 4.
The Judgment’s reference
to Jablin as a prevailing party is not dispositive.  Taking a pragmatic view of the case, the
court concludes that Jablin is not a successful party.  Jablin points to no substantive issue or
argument in his trial brief on which he was successful.  The court has reviewed Jablin’s trial brief
and he did not make any arguments concerning the legal, Topanga, and substantial
evidence arguments on which the City prevailed. 
He argued only that the Petition was time-barred because he was untimely
named, that he was an indispensable party, that Mabus failed to serve him with
her opening brief, that Mabus’ claims were moot, and that he joined the City’s
arguments on the mierts.  Jablin
prevailed on none of these arguments with the exception of untimeliness, and that
argument did not lead to a remedy because the court found he was not
indispensable.  
Particularly because he
was not indispensable to the case, Jablin’s fee motion is required to show how he
contributed to the City’s success in defending its administrative decision not
to remove the two trees.  A party that is
not indispensable still may sufficiently contribute to the defense of a public
agency’s decision so as to be entitled to attorney fees.   But it is not enough to join the City’s
arguments.  A joinder is merely a
cheerleading effort that adds nothing substantive unless it is accompanied by a
memorandum of points and authorities explaining the party’s reasoning.  Jablin’s trial brief contains no substantive
argument why he joined the City’s position.
Jablin is not a
successful party for purposes of a section 1021.5 fee award.[3]
 
            E.
Conclusion
            Jablin’s
motion for
a fee award under section 1021.5 is denied.
