[1] Petitioner Sorensen asks
the court to judicially notice (a) the writ, (b) the Judgment, and (c) the
Commission’s opposition to his ex parte application for an expedited briefing
schedule for his motion.  There is no
need to judicially notice these documents; a court can always consider
documents from the pending case file.


[2] No return has been filed
and the Commission’s new decision arguably is not properly before the
court.  The Commission’s opposition does
not object on this ground.


[3] It is the court’s decision
incorporated in the Judgment that so ruled.


[4] Petitioner disputes the
existence of “further, extensive factual findings”, noting that the new
decision merely copies and pastes G.S.’s testimony.  Reply at 2.


[5] “Twerking” is defined in
the Oxford Dictionary as a dance to popular music in a sexually provocative manner
involving thrusting hip
movements and a low, squatting stance.


[6] The Commission’s
conclusion that the video could not be viewed unless Sorensen presented and
authenticated it (Ex. A, pp. 44–45 (¶¶ 56–57)) is
inconsistent with his testimony that the video was on Facebook.  The complainant could have authenticated the
video through Sorensen and relied on G.S. to refute the authentication, if
necessary.  The Commission’s conclusion also
is an explanation that does not undermine the mitigating fact.


[7] The failure of any
decision-maker to view the video may better be described as a failure of proof
rather than a mitigating fact, but this does not change the Writ’s direction to
the Commission.
