And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling concerns a dispute over whether to proceed with an action against Real Party Moshfegh, who was served but has not appeared in the action. The court must consider whether a judgment rendered in Moshfegh's absence might be prejudicial to him or to the parties already involved in the action. The judge notes that dismissal of the action would not be required if Moshfegh were a necessary but not indispensable real party. The court also addresses several requests for judicial notice, including requests from the City and Real Party Whitley to notice various documents.
