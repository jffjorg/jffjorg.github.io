And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a case brought by Jablin against Mabus. Jablin argues that Mabus' opposition was filed late and failed to follow proper procedures, and therefore should not be considered by the court. Jablin also requests that the court take judicial notice of Mabus' motion for attorney fees in a related case, Mabus v. Culver City. The judge grants this request. The judge does not need to decide whether Jablin meets the requirements of California Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5, which allows for attorney fees in certain cases, because Mabus has not met the requirements for filing an opposition.
