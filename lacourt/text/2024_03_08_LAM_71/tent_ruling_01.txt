         vs.
 
SHAHRAM MOUSSAZADEH. 


 Case No.: 
  22STCV24086
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  March 8, 2024



 
Cross-Defendant Hormoz Pourat’s, in pro
per, unopposed motion for judgment on the pleadings is denied.
 
Cross-Defendant Hormoz Pourat (“Hormoz”) (“Cross-Defendant”)
moves unopposed in pro per for a motion
for judgment on the pleadings.  (Notice
of Motion, pg. 1.)
 
Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings
          Legal Standard      
          “A motion for judgment on the
pleadings may be made at any time either prior to the trial or at the trial
itself.”  (Stoops v. Abbassi
(2002) 100 Cal.App.4th 644, 650, citing Ion Equip. Corp. v. Nelson
(1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 868, 877; see also Korchemny v. Piterman (2021) 68
Cal.App.5th 1032, 1055 [“common law ground for a motion for judgment on the
pleadings is identical to the statutory ground”].)
A
motion by a defendant (or cross-defendant) can be made on the ground that the
court lacks jurisdiction of the subject of one or more of the causes of action
alleged; or the complaint (or any cause of action therein) “does not state
facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against that defendant.”  (C.C.P. §438(c).)
The
grounds for a motion for judgment on the pleadings must appear on the face of
the challenged pleading or be based on facts the court may judicially notice. (C.C.P.
§438(d); Tung v. Chicago Title Co. (2021) 63 Cal.App.5th 734, 758-759.)
Where
the motion is based on matters the court may judicially notice (under Evidence Code
§§452, 453), such matters must be specified in the notice of motion or
supporting points and authorities.  (C.C.P.
§438(d).)
 
          Discussion
          Cross-Defendant’s motion fails to
state the grounds on which he moves for judgment on the pleadings, and which
pleading the instant motion applies to. 
(See C.C.P. §438(c).) 
Further, the relief Cross-Defendant seeks in his motion in ¶7 to “order [Cross-Complainant]
Shahram Moussazadeh to provide copies of the all the front and back of checks
for the amounts he spent from the 1.5 million Dollars my brother gave to him to
my mother and me so that my mother and I can have Shahram Moussazadeh pay us
the amount of over one million Dollars, which he has borrowed from the equity
of the condominium and used on himself” is procedurally improper, as such
relief cannot be granted on a motion for judgment on the pleadings.
 
Conclusion
Plaintiff’s unopposed
motion for judgment on the pleadings is denied.
Moving Party to give notice.
