And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for judgment on the pleadings filed by Cross-Defendant Hormoz Pourat. The motion is denied because it fails to state the grounds on which it is based and does not specify which pleading it applies to. Additionally, the relief sought by Cross-Defendant is procedurally improper and cannot be granted on a motion for judgment on the pleadings. The Plaintiff's unopposed motion for judgment on the pleadings is also denied.
