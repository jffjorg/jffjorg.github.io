Plaintiff
Cynthia Abrams moves for issue, evidence, and monetary against Defendants True
Bullion LLC dba Gold Silver International, Gold Silver International Exchange,
and/or GSI Exchange, Subculture Services LLC; Anthony Allen Anderson, and Agnes
Viacrucis (“Defendants”).
 
This
court denies the request for issue and evidence sanctions but grants monetary
sanctions in the reduced amount of $4,560.00.
 
I.               
BACKGROUND 
 
Plaintiff
Cynthia Abrams (“Plaintiff”) brings this employment action against her former
employers, True Bullion LLC, Subculture Services LLC, Anthony Allen Anderson,
and Agnes Viacrucis. 
 
On
August 2, 2021, Abrams filed her complaint against Defendants and Does 1 to
100, alleging thirteen causes of action. 
 
On
December 6, 2021, Plaintiff served her discovery requests on Defendants.
(Vardapour Declaration filed 07/26/24 ¶ 3.) Defendants served their initial
responses on March 11, 2022. (Vardapour Declaration filed 07/26/24 ¶ 5.) Defendants
served further responses on June 10, 2022. (05/24/24 Minute Order p. 2.) 
 
On
June 9, 2023, Plaintiff filed motions to compel Defendants’ further responses.
(05/24/24 Minute Order p. 2.) On May 14, 2024, Defendants served further
responses to Plaintiff’s discovery requests. (Vardapour Declaration filed
07/26/24, ¶ 27.)
 
On
May 24, 2024, the court granted in part, and denied in part Plaintiff’s motions
to compel further discovery responses. (05/24/24 Minute Order p. 25.) The court
ordered Defendants to provide further verified responses to Plaintiff’s
Requests for Admission, Request for Production, Form Interrogatories,
Employment, Form Interrogatories, General, and Special Interrogatories within
thirty days of the court’s ruling. (05/24/24 Minute Order p. 25; Vardapour
Declaration filed 07/26/24, ¶¶ 29-30.) 
 
Defendants
did not serve further responses within thirty days of the court’s May 24, 2024,
ruling. (Vardapour Declaration filed 07/26/24, ¶ 35.) On July 26, 2024,
Plaintiff filed a motion for issue, evidence, and monetary sanctions against
Defendants (the “Motion”). Defendants filed an opposition on September 24,
2024. Plaintiff filed a reply on September 30, 2024.
 
II.

     Responses To Interrogatories, Request For Production, And Request For
     Admission (Set 1) Against Defendants, filed on May 17, 2024.

 

Plaintiff Cynthia Abrams’s
     Notice Of Motion And Motion For Preliminary Injunction, filed on
     10/15/2021.

 
The
court need not take judicial notice of documents that are within the case file.
Thus, Plaintiff’s requests for judicial notice are denied.
 
III.           
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
“The court may
impose an issue sanction ordering that designated facts shall be taken as
established in the action in accordance with the claim of the party adversely
affected by the misuse of the discovery process. The court may also impose an
issue sanction by an order prohibiting any party engaging in the misuse of the
discovery process from supporting or opposing designated claims or defenses.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030(b).)  
“The court may impose
an evidence sanction by an order prohibiting any party engaging in the misuse
of the discovery process from introducing designated matters in evidence.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.030(c).)
“The court may
impose a monetary sanction ordering that one engaging in the misuse of the
discovery process, or any attorney advising that conduct, or both pay the
reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees, incurred by anyone as a result
of that conduct. The court may also impose this sanction on one unsuccessfully
asserting that another has engaged in the misuse of the discovery process, or
on any attorney who advised that assertion, or on both. If a monetary sanction
is authorized by any provision of this title, the court shall impose that
sanction unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030(a).)
Discovery
sanctions “should be appropriate to the dereliction, and should not exceed that
which is required to protect the interests of the party entitled to but denied
discovery.”¿¿(Deyo v. Kilbourne¿(1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771, 793.)  “[D]iscovery
sanctions exist ‘not to provide a weapon for punishment for past violations or
penalty for past conduct but to secure compliance with orders of the court.’” (Electronic
Funds Solutions, LLC v. Murphy¿(2005) 134 Cal.App.4th 1161, 1183.) Before
issuing a sanction, a trial court “should consider both the conduct being
sanctioned and its effect on the party seeking discovery and, in choosing a
sanction, should attempt to tailor the sanction to the harm caused by the
withheld discovery.”  (Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174
Cal.App.4th 967, 992.)
IV.           
THE
MOTION, OPPOSITION, AND REPLY
a.     The Motion
 
Plaintiff seeks an order
deeming certain issues admitted and preventing Defendants from providing
evidence to the contrary. (Notice of Motion p. 2.) Plaintiff also seeks $13,335
in monetary sanctions against Defendants. (Notice of Motion pp. 2-3.)
 
Plaintiff
argues this court should grant the Motion because Defendants did not comply
with the court’s May 24, 2024, order to provide further responses to
Plaintiff’s discovery requests. (See Motion p. 2.) Plaintiff served her first
set of discovery responses on December 6, 2021. (Motion pp. 6-7.) Plaintiff’s
counsel submits a declaration stating Plaintiff received Defendants’ initial
discovery responses on March 11, 2022. (Vardapour Declaration filed 07/26/24 ¶ 5.)
On August 10, 2022, the court instructed Defendants to provide further
responses and to produce documents in their native format. (Vardapour
Declaration filed 07/26/24 ¶ 7.) Defendants did not provide further responses.
(Vardapour Declaration filed 07/26/24 ¶ 7.) In June 2023, Plaintiff filed
motions to compel further responses. (Vardapour Declaration filed 07/26/24 ¶
11.) During a December 2023, hearing, the court instructed Defendants again to
produce documents in their native formats. (Vardapour Declaration filed
07/26/24 ¶ 13.) Defendants produced additional discovery responses on May 13,
2024. (Vardapour Declaration filed 07/26/24 ¶¶ 24, 27.) On May 24, 2024, the
court ordered Defendants to provide further responses to Plaintiff’s discovery
requests within thirty days of the court’s ruling. (Vardapour Declaration filed
07/26/24 ¶¶ 30-33.) Defendants did not serve further responses and Plaintiff
filed this Motion. (See Motion; Vardapour Declaration filed 07/26/24 ¶ 35.)
 
b.     The Opposition
 
Defendants
argue the court should deny the Motion because “Defendants have actively tried
to work with Plaintiff regarding coordinating discovery in this case as well as
the four related cases.” (Opposition p. 3.) Defendants counsel states that “Plaintiff’s
counsel never requested an Informal Discover Conference to resolve these
issues.” (Kanno Declaration filed 09/24/24 ¶ 3.) Defendants’ counsel also
states they “agreed to provide responses and proposed a discovery plan with
responses being produced in each of the five cases on a two-week interval.”
(Kanno Declaration filed 09/24/24 ¶ 4.) Defendants’ counsel further states that
“Plaintiff’s counsel has refused to work in good faith with Defendants”,
“Plaintiff’s motions are mere gamesmanship to obtain a procedural advantage and
unwarranted sanctions” and “Plaintiffs have used five separate matters as a
vehicle to propound duplicative, unduly burdensome and harassing amounts of
discovery.” (Kanno Declaration filed 09/24/24 ¶¶ 4, 7.) Defendants’ counsel
states that Defendants paid the sanctions ordered by the court in its May 24,
2024, ruling on August 6, 2024, and the delay in payment was because of an
issue with Plaintiff’s W9. (Kanno Declaration filed 09/24/24 ¶ 13.) Finally, Defendants’
counsel states Defendants provided additional supplemental responses to
Plaintiff’s discovery requests on August 16, 2024. (Opposition p. 3; Kanno
Declaration filed 09/24/24 ¶ 14; Ex. 10.)
 
c.      The Reply
 
Plaintiff
argues that Defendants did not comply with the court’s May 24, 2024, order
because their responses were untimely and substantively deficient. (Reply pp. 2,
5.) Plaintiff also states she made “telephonic and written confer efforts both
before and after [the] deadline.” (Reply p. 3.)
 
V.             
DISCUSSION
 
a.    
Issue
and Evidence Sanctions
On
May 24, 2024, the court ordered Defendants to provide further, verified,
responses to Plaintiff’s Requests for Admissions (“RFAs”), Request for
Production (“RFP”), Form Interrogatories, Employment, Form Interrogatories,
General, and Special Interrogatories, within thirty days of the court’s ruling.
(05/24/24 Minute Order p. 25.) The court also ordered Defendants to pay
$9,584.18 in monetary sanctions. (05/24/24 Minute Order p. 25.)
Defendants
state that they paid the sanctions ordered by the court on August 6, 2024.
(Kanno Declaration filed 09/24/24 ¶ 13.) Defendants further state the delay was
because Plaintiff did not provide her W9. (Kanno Declaration filed 09/24/24 ¶
13.) Plaintiff’s reply does not dispute this. (Reply.) This court, therefore,
finds that Defendants’ delay in paying sanctions was not an abuse of the
discovery process.
Defendants
also state that they served Plaintiff with further supplemental responses on
August 16, 2024. (Kanno Declaration filed 09/24/24 ¶ 14; Ex. 10.) Plaintiff
responds that Defendants’ further supplemental responses were untimely. and the
responses do not substantively comply with the court’s May 24, 2024, order.
(Reply pp. 2, 5.) 
This
court finds that Defendants’ further supplemental responses, though untimely,
substantially comply with the court’s May 24, 2024, order.
First,
Defendants were ordered to provide further, verified responses to Plaintiff’s
RFAs #7-9. (05/24/24 Minute Order p. 5-7.) Defendants’ further supplemental
responses contain verifications by each Defendant. (Ex. 16, pdf p. 121
(Subculture Services, LLC); p. 122 (True Bullion, LLC); p. 123 (Anthony
Anderson); p. 124 (Agnes Viacrucis.)
Second,
Defendants were ordered to verify their responses to Plaintiff’s RFP and to
provide further supplemental responses to RFPs #44, #48, and #69. (05/24/24
Minute Order pp. 7-11.) Defendants’ further supplemental responses contain
verifications by each Defendant. (Ex. 16, pdf p. 121 (Subculture Services,
LLC); p. 122 (True Bullion, LLC); p. 123 (Anthony Anderson); p. 124 (Agnes
Viacrucis.) Defendants also provided further supplemental responses to RFPs
#44, #46, and #69. (Ex. 16 pdf pp. 4-6.)
Third,
Defendants were ordered to provide further responses to Plaintiff’s Form
Interrogatories, Employment, #216.1 and #217.1. (05/24/24 Minute Order pp.
11-16.) The court also noted that Defendant Subculture Services LLC’s responses
were missing from Form Interrogatories #214.1 and #214.2 and ordered Subculture
Services LLC to provide further responses. Defendants’ further responses to
#214.1 and #214.2 include Subculture Services LLC’s responses. (Ex. 16 pdf pp.
14-15.) Further, Defendants have provided further supplemental responses to
Form Interrogatories, Employment, #216.1 and #217.1. (Ex. 16 pdf pp. 15-53.)
Fourth,
Defendants were ordered to provide further responses to Plaintiff’s Form
Interrogatories, General and to verify their responses. (05/24/24 Minute Order
pp. 16-20.) Defendants’ further supplemental responses contain verifications by
each Defendant. (Ex. 16, pdf. p. 121 (Subculture Services, LLC); p. 122 (True
Bullion, LLC); p. 123 (Anthony Anderson); p. 124 (Agnes Viacrucis.) Defendants
have also provided further supplemental responses to the remaining Form
Interrogatories, General. (Ex. 16 pdf pp. 62-103.)
Finally,
Defendants were ordered to provide further supplemental responses to
Plaintiff’s Special Interrogatories and to verify their responses. (Minute
Order 05/24/24 Minute Order pp. 20-22.) Defendants’ further supplemental
responses contain verifications by each Defendant. (Ex. 16, pdf. p. 121
(Subculture Services, LLC); p. 122 (True Bullion, LLC); p. 123 (Anthony
Anderson); p. 124 (Agnes Viacrucis.) Defendants have also provided further
supplemental responses to Special Interrogatories #16, #18, #21, and #22. (Ex.
16 pdf pp. 109-120.)
Discovery
sanctions exist to “secure compliance with orders of the court.” (Electronic
Funds Solutions, LLC v. Murphy, supra, 134 Cal.App.4th at p. 1183.) Discovery
sanctions should not exceed what is required to “protect the interests of the
party entitled to but denied discovery.”¿¿(Deyo v. Kilbourne, supra, 84
Cal.App.3d at p. 793.)  Because Defendants’ further supplemental responses
substantially comply with the court’s May 24, 2024, ruling, this court finds
that issue and evidentiary sanctions are not warranted.
b.    
Monetary
Sanctions
Plaintiff
seeks $13,335 in monetary sanctions. (Vardapour Declaration filed 07/26/24 ¶
43.) This includes the $60.00 motion filing fee, 30.4 hours drafting,
reviewing, and revising the Motion, declaration, request for judicial notice,
and separate statements, and five hours for reviewing the opposition, drafting
a reply, and appearing at the hearing. (Vardapour Declaration filed 07/26/24 ¶
43.) 
Defendants
argue sanctions are not warranted because Plaintiff failed to meet and confer
about the discovery issues. But this court finds no authority for the
proposition that parties are required to meet and confer after the court has
ordered a party to provide further discovery responses. 
In
its May 24, 2024, order, the court noted that “Defendants’ failures to serve
verified responses fits their ongoing pattern of providing partial responses
without satisfying their obligations under the Discovery Act.” (05/24/24 Minute
Order pp. 7, 10, 16, 20, 22.) This court also notes that Defendants’ failure to
comply with the court’s order fits with their ongoing pattern of failing to
satisfy their obligations under the Discovery Act. 
Defendants’
further responses were due thirty days after the court’s May 24, 2024, ruling.
Defendants did not serve their further supplemental responses until August 16,
2024, which is nearly two months after they were due. Further, Defendants did
not provide their further supplemental responses until after Plaintiff filed
this motion. Disobeying a court order is considered a misuse of the discovery
process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010.) Accordingly, this court finds that
Defendants have engaged in a misuse of the discovery process. This court
further finds that 35.4 hours of attorneys’ fees is excessive for this motion.
Thus,
this court grants Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions in the reduced
amount of $4,560.00, reflecting the $60.00 motion filing fee, eight hours for
preparing the Motion, and four hours for reviewing the opposition, drafting the
reply, and appearing at the hearing, at $375 per hours.
VI.           
CONCLUSION
For
the foregoing reasons, this court denies Plaintiff’s motion for issue and
evidentiary sanctions but grants sanctions against Defendants in the reduced
amount of $4,560.00. This amount is applied evenly among the four Defendants,
so each Defendant is sanctioned in the total amount of $1,140.00.
