COURT’S
  [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: 
Confirm Arbitration Award 



 
[THE FOLLOWING IS A TENTATIVE RULING IN THE ABOVE CASE]:

 
I.               
BACKGROUND 
 
On October
1, 2021, CMM, LLP (“Petitioner”) and Catherine Dunne (“Respondent”) entered
into a Litigation Services Agreement for accounting and consulting services
(the “Agreement”). (Ex. 4(b) p. 5.) The Agreement contained an arbitration
provision. (Ex. 8(c) p. 2; Ex. 4(b) p. 3.) A dispute arose regarding
non-payment of fees and costs and Petitioner filed a Demand for Arbitration.
(Ex. 8(c) p. 2.) 
 
The Arbitrator
held a hearing on February 2, 2024. (Motion p. 2.) On February 6, 2024, the Arbitrator
issued a final award in favor of Petitioner (the “Award”). (Ex. 8(c) p. 5.) 
 
On
July 8, 2024, Petitioner filed a petition to confirm arbitration award (the “Petition”).
Respondent filed a general denial on August 27, 2024.
 
II.             
MOVING
PARTY’S POSITION 
 
Petitioner
requests this court confirm the Award and enter judgment according to it. (Petition
p. 3.) Petitioner attaches to the Petition a copy of the Agreement, which
states: “In the event of any unresolved dispute or controversy under this
Agreement relating to an amount of fees and costs, the aggregate of which is
twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000) or greater, such dispute shall be
submitted to binding arbitration before a retired Judicial Officer of the
Superior Courts of the State of California, with family law experience, and
affiliated with either ADR Services of Los Angeles and/or Judicial Arbitration
and Mediation Services of Los Angeles (“JAMS”).” (Ex. 4(b) p. 3.) Petitioner alleged
respondent had an outstanding balance of $77,499.20 as of December 31, 2023.
(Ex. 8(c) p. 4.) The Arbitrator issued an Award in Petitioner’s favor on
February 6, 2024. (Ex. 8(c).) Petitioner attaches to the Petition a copy of the
Award, which requires Respondent to pay Petitioner $66,749.20, including fees
and accrued interests, and the Arbitration costs of $6,004.44. (Ex. 8(c) p. 5.)
 In total, Respondent was ordered to pay
Petitioner $72,753.64. (Ex. 8(c) p. 5; Petition p. 2.)
 
In
addition to the arbitration award, Petitioner requests this court grant it
$5,082.79 in interest, attorneys’ fees in the minimum amount of $2,457.64
(uncontested) or $4,405.28 (contested), and $545.48 in costs. (Motion p. 5; Petition
p. 3) 
 
III.           
RESPONDING
PARTY’S POSITION
 
Respondent
filed a general denial alleging three affirmative defenses. First, Respondent
argues that the complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause
of action. Second, Respondent argues she has been denied her constitutional
rights of due process. Third, Respondent argues Petitioner failed to comply
with Code of Civil Procedure sections 1280, et seq.
 
IV.           
DISCUSSION
 
Service
of the Petition and Notice of Hearing
 
“Any
party to an arbitration in which an award has been made may petition the court
to confirm, correct or vacate the award.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1285.) It must be
served between ten days and four years from the date the award was served on
the petitioner. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1288 & 1288.4.) The other party may
respond to the petition. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1285.2.)
 
Pursuant
to the Code of Civil Procedure, section 1290.4, “A copy of the petition and a
written notice of the time and place of the hearing thereof and any other
papers upon which the petition is based shall be served in the manner provided
in the arbitration agreement for the service of such petition and notice.” (Code
Civ. Proc., §1290.4(a).)  
 
But
“if the arbitration agreement does not provide the manner in which such service
shall be made and the person upon whom service is to be made has not previously
appeared in the proceeding and has not previously been served in accordance
with this subdivision . . . Service within this State shall be made in the
manner provided by law for the service of summons in an action.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1290.4(b)(1).) 
 
Here,
The Agreement provides that “all notices and/or communications pertaining to
this Agreement shall be made and given solely in writing and by recognized
means of communication, including but not limited to facsimile, U.S. Mail,
electronic mail, courier service or personal delivery.” (Ex. 4(b) p. 4.) The
Final Award was served on Respondent on February 6, 2024. (Ex. 8(c) p. 6.) 
 
The Proof
of Service shows that the Notice of Hearing, Motion to Confirm Arbitration
Award, and supporting documents were served to Respondent by mail on August 16,
2024. (Proof of Service filed 08/16/24.) Service by U.S. Mail is permissible
under the Agreement. Further, August 16, 2024, is between ten days and four
years from February 6, 2024. (Ex. 8(c) p. 6.) Thus, service of the Notice of
Motion, Motion to Confirm Arbitration Award, and supporting documents was
proper.
 
Further,
Petitioner filed a Proof of Service showing the Petition and its supporting
documents was served to Respondent by personal service on July 28, 2024. (Proof
of Service filed 09/04/2024.) Service by personal delivery or courier service is
permissible under the Agreement. 
Further, July 28, 2024, is between ten days and four years from February
6, 2024. (Ex. 8(c) p. 6.) Thus, service of the Petition and supporting
documents was proper.
 
Moreover,
service by mail and personal service are permissible methods of service. (Code
Civ. Proc. §§ 415.30, 415.10.)
 
Accordingly,
service was proper.
 
Filing
Requirements
 
A
petition to confirm arbitration award must:
 
(a)  
Set forth the substance of or have attached a copy of the
agreement to arbitrate unless the petitioner denies the existence of such an
agreement.
 
(b)  
Set forth the names of the arbitrators.
 
(c) Set forth or have attached a copy of the award and the
written opinion of the arbitrators, if any.
 
(Code
Civ. Proc., § 1285.4) 
 
Here,
a copy of the Agreement is attached to the Petition as Exhibit 4(b). The
Agreement is signed by both parties. (Ex. 4(b) p. 5.) The Agreement provides
that: “In the event of any unresolved dispute or controversy under this
Agreement relating to an amount of fees and costs, the aggregate of which is
twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000) or greater, such dispute shall be
submitted to binding arbitration before a retired Judicial Officer of the
Superior Courts of the State of California, with family law experience, and
affiliated with either ADR Services of Los Angeles and/or Judicial Arbitration
and Mediation Services of Los Angeles (“JAMS”).” (Ex. 4(b) p. 3.) Moreover, the
Petition states that the Hon. Riva G. Goetz (Ret.) was the arbitrator for this
matter. (Petition p. 2.) Finally, a copy of the arbitration award and written
opinion of the Hon. Riva G. Goetz (Ret.) is attached as Exhibit 8(c).
Accordingly, the petition is in compliance with section 1285.4’s filing
requirements.
 
Service
of the Arbitration Award
 
“The neutral arbitrator shall serve a
signed copy of the award on each party to the arbitration personally or by
registered or certified mail or as provided in the agreement.”¿(Code Civ.
Proc., § 1283.6.)
 
Here,
the Award was served to Respondent by mail on February 6, 2024. Accordingly,
this requirement is satisfied.
 
Substantive
Issues
 
¿The Court shall vacate the award if any of the following
conditions are proven: 
 
(1) The award was
procured by corruption, fraud or other undue means.
(2) There was
corruption in any of the arbitrators.
(3) The rights of
the party were substantially prejudiced by misconduct of a neutral arbitrator.
(4) The
arbitrators exceeded their powers and the award cannot be corrected without
affecting the merits of the decision upon the controversy submitted.
(5) The rights of
the party were substantially prejudiced by the refusal of the arbitrators to
postpone the hearing upon sufficient cause being shown therefor or by the
refusal of the arbitrators to hear evidence material to the controversy or by
other conduct of the arbitrators contrary to the provisions of this title.
(6) An arbitrator
making the award either: (A) failed to disclose within the time required
for disclosure a ground for disqualification of which the arbitrator was then
aware; or (B) was subject to disqualification upon grounds specified in Section
1281.91 but failed upon receipt of timely demand to disqualify himself or
herself as required by that provision. However, this subdivision does not apply
to arbitration proceedings conducted under a collective bargaining agreement
between employers and employees or between their respective representatives.
(Code Civ. Proc. § 1286.2(a).) 
 
Only where both (1) the arbitrator abused his or
her discretion and (2) there was resulting prejudice, can a trial court
properly vacate an arbitration award.  (SWAB Financial, LLC v. E*Trade
Securities, LLC (2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 1181, 1198.) 
¿
Respondent
argues the complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of
action, she has been denied her constitutional rights of due process, and
Petitioner failed to comply with Code of Civil Procedure sections 1280, et seq.
(General Denial.) 
 
As
noted, Petitioner has complied with the statutory requirements. Further, Respondent’s
General Denial does not present this court with any argument as to why the
Award should not be confirmed. Accordingly, the Petition to Confirm Arbitration
Award is granted.
 
Costs
 
The court shall award costs upon any Petition to
confirm a fee arbitration award.  (See Code Civ. Proc., § 1293.2.) 
 
Although
the cost request is in Petitioner’s Motion, the Petitioner did not check the
box in the Petition stating it is seeking costs of the suit. (Petition p. 3.)
Nevertheless, the court considers the Petitioner’s request for $545.48 in
costs. (Motion p. 5.) This includes the filing fee and service fees. (Ex. A;
Tudzin Declaration ¶ 9.) 
 
This court finds that the costs sought by Petitioner in connection
with the Petition are reasonable. Accordingly, Petitioner’s cost request is
granted in the sum of $545.48.
 
Attorneys’ Fees
 
“Neither party to the arbitration may recover
costs or attorney’s fees incurred in preparation for or in the course of the
fee arbitration proceeding with the exception of the filing fee paid pursuant
to subdivision (a) of this section.  However, a court confirming,
correcting, or vacating an award under this section may award to the prevailing
party reasonable fees and costs incurred in obtaining confirmation, correction,
or vacation of the award including, if applicable, fees and costs on
appeal.  The party obtaining judgment confirming, correcting, or vacating
the award shall be the prevailing party except that, without regard to
consideration of who the prevailing party may be, if a party did not appear at
the arbitration hearing in the manner provided by the rules adopted by the
board of trustees, that party shall not be entitled to attorney’s fees or costs
upon confirmation, correction, or vacation of the award.”  (Bus. &
Prof. Code § 6203(c).) 
 
Here, Petitioner seeks attorneys’ fees in the sum
of $2,457.64 (if uncontested) or $4,405.28 (if contested). (Ex. A.) Petitioner
calculates its attorneys’ fees using Local Rule of the Court, rule 3.214. 
 
Respondent has not argued the requested
attorneys’ fee award should be reduced in any manner. (Premier Medical
Management Systems, Inc. v. California Insurance Guarantee Association
(2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 550, 560 (emphasizing that opposing parties “submitted
no evidence that the hours claimed by counsel were excessive,” and declining to
“declare as a matter of law that the hours were unreasonable”).
 
This
court finds that Petitioner’s attorneys’ fees request is reasonable under the
circumstances. Accordingly, Petitioner’s request for attorneys’ fees in the sum
of $4,405.28 is granted.
 
Post-Judgment
Interest
 
Interest
accrues on a money judgment at a rate of 10 percent per annum from the date of
entry of judgment. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§§ 685.010(a), 685.020(a).)   
 
Here, Petitioner seeks $5,082.79 in prejudgment
interest. That amount properly reflects the interest rate allowed under
sections 685.010(a) and 685.020(a).
 
V.             
CONCLUSION
 
For
the foregoing reasons, this court grants Petitioner’s petition to confirm the
arbitration award. Petitioner’s requests for $545.48 in costs, $4,405.28 in
attorneys’ fees, and $5,082.79 in prejudgment interest are also granted.
