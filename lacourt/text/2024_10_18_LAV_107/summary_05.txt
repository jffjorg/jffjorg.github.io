And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Cynthia Abrams vs. True Bullion LLC, et al. The case involves a dispute over discovery requests made by Plaintiff Cynthia Abrams against the Defendants.

The Judge denied the Plaintiff's motion for issue and evidence sanctions, but granted monetary sanctions in the reduced amount of $4,560.00. The Plaintiff had requested $13,335 in monetary sanctions, but the Judge found that the amount requested was excessive.

The Judge found that the Defendants had engaged in a misuse of the discovery process by failing to comply with the court's May 24, 2024, order to provide further responses to the Plaintiff's discovery requests. However, the Judge also found that the Defendants' further supplemental responses, which were served on August 16, 2024, substantially complied with the court's order.

The Judge's ruling was based on the California Code of Civil Procedure and the case law of Deyo v. Kilbourne. The Judge concluded that the Defendants' failure to comply with the court's order was a misuse of the discovery process and that the Plaintiff was entitled to monetary sanctions.
