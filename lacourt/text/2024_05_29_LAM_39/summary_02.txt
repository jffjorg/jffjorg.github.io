```

And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

"This tentative ruling denies the plaintiff's motion for leave to file an amended complaint without prejudice due to procedural issues. The court cites California Code of Civil Procedure section 473 and California Rules of Court, rule 3.1324, which require a declaration specifying the effect of the amendment and why it is necessary and proper. The plaintiff's declaration does not adequately address these factors, therefore the motion is denied without prejudice. The plaintiff is to give notice of this order and file proof of service."
