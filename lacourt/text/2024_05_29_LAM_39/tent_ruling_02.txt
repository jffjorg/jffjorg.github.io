MOTION
Plaintiff 58th St
Industrial LLC (“Plaintiff”) moves for leave to amend its complaint.  The unopposed motion is denied without
prejudice.
 
ANALYSIS
Under Code of Civil
Procedure section 473, subdivision (a)(1), “The court may, in furtherance of
justice, and on any terms as may be proper, allow a party to amend any pleading
or proceeding by adding or striking out the name of any party, or by correcting
a mistake in the name of a party, or a mistake in any other respect; and may,
upon like terms, enlarge the time for answer or demurrer. The court may
likewise, in its discretion, after notice to the adverse party, allow, upon any
terms as may be just, an amendment to any pleading or proceeding in other
particulars; and may upon like terms allow an answer to be made after the time
limited by this code.”  
Judicial policy favors
resolution of all disputed matters between the parties and, therefore, leave to
amend is liberally granted.  (Berman vs. Bromberg (1986) 56
Cal.App.4th 936, 945.)  “[I]t is an
abuse of discretion for the court to deny leave to amend where the opposing
party was not misled or prejudiced by the amendment.”  (Kittredge
Sports Co. v. Superior Court (1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 1045, 1048.)
Under
California Rules of Court, rule 3.1324, a motion to amend a pleading must
include a copy of the proposed amendment and state the allegations that the
moving party proposes to add or delete.  (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1324, subd. (a)(1) & (2).)  Rule 3.1324 also requires the moving party to
provide a declaration specifying the effect of the amendment; why the amendment
is necessary and proper; when the facts giving rise to the amended allegations
were discovered; and the reasons why the request for amendment was not made
earlier.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1324, subd. (b).)
Plaintiff has submitted the Declaration
of Sasha Struthers (“Counsel”) in support of the motion.  However, in that declaration Counsel does not
adequately address the factors set forth in rule 3.1324.  Accordingly, the Court denies the motion
without prejudice, as procedurally improper. 

Plaintiff is to give
notice of this order and file proof of service of concerning it.
