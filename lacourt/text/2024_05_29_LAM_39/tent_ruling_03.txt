MOTION
Plaintiff Heidy
Garcia (“Plaintiff”) sued Defendant Oxford Grand LLC (“Defendant”) regarding an
apartment Plaintiff rents from Defendant. 
Plaintiff moves for judgment on the pleadings.  Code of Civil Procedure section 438 provides Plaintiff
may move for judgment on the pleadings if “the complaint states facts sufficient
to constitute a cause or causes of action against the defendant and [defendant’s]
answer does not state facts sufficient to constitute a defense to the complaint.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 438, subd. (c)(1)(A).)  Fatal to Plaintiff’s motion is her attachment
of documents representing extrinsic evidence which the Court cannot consider in
ruling on a motion for judgment on the pleadings.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 438, subd. (d).)  Accordingly, the Court denies the motion.
The Court directs
Defendant to file notices of related cases in Garcia v. Esmeralda
(Super. Ct. L.A. County, 2023, No. 23STCV17481) and Garcia v. LA Rentals
(Super. Ct. L.A. County, 2023, No. 23STCV09093) as required.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.300, subds. (b),
(f).) 
Plaintiff is ordered
to provide notice of this order and file proof of service of same.
