The judge has issued a Tentative Ruling, granting preliminary approval of the settlement. The judge directs the plaintiff to file and serve an Amended Proposed Order, which must articulate the details of the settlement, rather than simply referencing the Settlement Agreement. The Net Settlement Amount is $295,267.50, which will be distributed after paying attorney fees, litigation costs, a Class Representative Enhancement Payment, and settlement administration costs. The defendant will pay their share of taxes in addition to the Gross Settlement Amount. The Warehouse will fully fund the settlement and pay its share of payroll taxes by transmitting funds to the Administrator within 14 days of the Effective Date.
