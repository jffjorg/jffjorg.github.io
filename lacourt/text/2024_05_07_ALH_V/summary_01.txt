And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled in favor of the defendant, Alhambra Hospital Medical Center, and sustained the demurrer to the third cause of action for elder abuse. The plaintiff, Victor Tsai, and his siblings, Alice and Rose Tsai, alleged that the defendant negligently cared for their mother, Mimi Kuo, while she was a patient at the hospital. The judge found that the plaintiff failed to allege sufficient facts to state a claim for elder abuse and that the defendant's actions did not amount to a deliberate denial or withholding of medical care. The judge also found that the plaintiff's allegations did not show that the defendant knew that injury was substantially certain or with conscious disregard of the high probability of injury. The judge further found that the plaintiff's disagreements with the defendant about medical treatment did not amount to elder abuse and that the plaintiff was not entitled to leave to amend the complaint. The case will proceed to a hearing on May 7, 2024.
