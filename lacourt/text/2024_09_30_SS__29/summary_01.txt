Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment against the plaintiff, Sally Ydelbira Tipple, in the case of Esquivel v. Rohn. The plaintiff had filed a complaint against the defendant for general negligence and motor vehicle negligence arising from an automobile accident on April 21, 2019. The defendant had filed a motion for summary judgment, which the judge has granted.

The judge's decision is based on the fact that the plaintiff had failed to provide evidence to support her negligence cause of action, and that the defendant had presented evidence that showed that the plaintiff had no evidence to support her claims. The judge had previously granted the defendant's motion to deem the plaintiff to have admitted the truth of certain matters specified in the defendant's requests for admission.

The judge's ruling is based on the California Code of Civil Procedure, section 437c, subdivision (c), which requires the court to grant summary judgment if all the evidence submitted shows that there is no triable issue of fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The judge's decision is final unless one of the parties files an opposition to the ruling.
