Background
On January 3, 2024, Ramona Soto Lopez (“Plaintiff”) filed
a complaint against Michael Castro (“Castro”), Julianne Farias, David Ortiz, Sandra
Ortiz, and Does 1 through 25 for negligence and negligent entrustment causes of
action arising out of an incident in which, Plaintiff alleges, she was injured
when she was struck by a vehicle driven by Castro while Plaintiff was walking
in a crosswalk on November 17, 2023, at or near the intersection of Sunset
Boulevard and Portia Street in Los Angeles.
 
On April 11 and 12, 2024, each of the named defendants
filed an answer.
 
On August 22, 2024, Castro filed the two
motions that are before the Court and set for hearing on September 30: (1) a
motion to compel Plaintiff to respond to Form Interrogatories (Set One); and
(2) a motion to compel Plaintiff to respond to Requests for Production (Set One).  In each motion, Castro seeks sanctions.
No opposition has been filed. 
Legal Standard
 
A party must respond to interrogatories within 30 days
after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom
interrogatories are directed does not provide a timely response, the propounding
party may move for an order compelling response to the interrogatories. (Id.,
§ 2030.290, subd. (b).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial
responses, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2030.290;
Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants
(2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In
addition, a party who fails to provide a timely response generally waives all
objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290, subd. (a).) 
When a party moves to compel initial responses to
interrogatories, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the motion], unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd.
(c).)
A party must respond to requests for production of documents
within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260, subd.(a).) If a
party to whom requests for production of documents are directed does not
provide timely responses, the requesting party may move for an order compelling
response to the demand. (Id., § 2031.300, subd. (b).) There is no time
limit for a motion to compel initial responses, and no meet and confer efforts
are required. (See id., § 2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting,
Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.)
Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who
fails to provide a timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).) 
When
a party moves to compel initial responses to requests for production, “the
court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes [the motion], unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (c).) 
Discussion
Castro served Plaintiff with form
interrogatories and document requests April 12, 2024. (Van Wagner Decls., ¶ 3
& Exhs. A.) Plaintiff requested and received three extensions of time to
respond but still has not served any responses. (Id., ¶¶ 5-10.)
Castro need not show anything more.
The motions to compel are granted.
The requests for sanctions are denied.  The applicable provisions of the Civil
Discovery Act provide for the imposition of sanctions “against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes” the motion to compel.  (Code
Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (c) & 2031.300, subd. (c).)  Here, Plaintiff has not filed any opposition,
and so has not unsuccessfully opposed the motion.

GRANTS the motions to compel.

ORDERS Plaintiff Ramona Soto Lopez to serve code-compliant, verified, written
responses, without objection, to Defendant Michael Castro’s Form Interrogatories, Set
