21STCV09168
City’s motion to contest application for good faith settlement determination
Tentative
The
Court determines that the settlement between Plaintiff and Defendants Randolph
Schnitman & Jacqueline Schnitman is in good faith under Code of Civil Procedure
section 877.6
 
Background
On March 9, 2021, Cindi Witte (“Plaintiff”)
filed a complaint against City of Los Angeles (“City”), Randolph Schnitman, Jacqueline
Schnitman, and Does 1 through 50, asserting causes of action for dangerous
condition of public property and negligence/premises liability arising out of an
alleged trip and fall on the sidewalk in front of 222 Hilgard Avenue in Los
Angeles on February 20, 2020.
On October 28, 2021, Randolph Schnitman and
Jacqueline Schnitman (collectively the “Schnitmans”) filed an answer to
Plaintiff’s complaint as well as a cross-complaint against Roes 1 through 20. 
On August 11, 2023, the Schnitmans amended the cross-complaint
to name City as Roe 1. On September 11, 2023, City filed an answer to this
cross-complaint.
On January 10, 2022, City filed an answer and
cross-complaint against the Schnitmans. On December 4, 2023, the Schnitmans
filed an answer to this cross-complaint. 
On July 30, 2024, the Schnitman filed a notice
of settlement and application for determination of good faith settlement.
On August 23, 2024, City filed this motion
contesting the application for determination of good faith settlement. The
Schnitmans filed an opposition on September 13; Plaintiff filed an opposition
on September 16. City filed a reply on September 20.
Legal Standard
In a case involving two or
more alleged joint tortfeasors, a party may seek a court order under Code of Civil
Procedure section 877.6 determining that a settlement between the plaintiff and
one or more of the alleged tortfeasors is in good faith. A judicial
determination of good faith “bar[s] any other joint tortfeasor … from any
further claims against the settling tortfeasor … for equitable comparative
contribution, or partial or comparative indemnity, based on comparative
negligence or comparative fault.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 877.6(c).)
In evaluating whether a
settlement has been made in good faith, courts consider the following factors,
as set forth by the California Supreme Court in the landmark case Tech-Bilt, Inc. v. Woodward-Clyde &
Associates (1985) 38 Cal.3d 488: 
             1)
“a rough approximation of plaintiffs’ total recovery”;
             2)
“the settlor’s proportionate liability”;
            3) “the amount paid in settlement”;
      4) “the allocation of the settlement
proceeds among plaintiffs”;
5) “a recognition that a settlor should pay
less in settlement than he would if he were found liable after a trial”;
             6)
the settling party's “financial conditions and insurance policy limits”;
7) any evidence of “collusion, fraud, or
tortious conduct aimed to injure the interests of nonsettling defendants.”
(Id. at 499.)
“Practical considerations obviously require that the evaluation be made on the
basis of information available at the time of settlement.” (Ibid.)
The “good faith” concept in
Code of Civil Procedure section 877.6 is a flexible principle imposing on
reviewing courts the obligation to guard against the numerous ways in which the
interests of nonsettling defendants may be unfairly prejudiced. (Rankin v.
Curtis (1986) 183 Cal. App. 3d 939, 945.) Accordingly, under Tech-Bilt, the party asserting the lack
of “good faith” may meet this burden by demonstrating that the settlement is so
far "out of the ballpark" as to be inconsistent with the equitable
objectives of the statute. (Tech-Bilt, supra, 38 Cal.3d at 499-500.)
Such a demonstration would establish that the proposed settlement was not a “settlement
made in good faith” within the terms of section 877.6. (Ibid.) 
The Supreme Court explained
that Code of Civil Procedure section 877.6 is designed to further two equitable
policies: 
1)
encouragement of settlements; and 
2)
equitable allocation of costs among joint tortfeasors.  
(Ibid.)  
Those policies would not be
served by an approach which emphasizes one to the virtual exclusion of the
other. (Ibid.) Accordingly, a settlement will not be found in good faith
unless the amount is reasonable in light of the settling tortfeasor's
proportionate share of liability. (Std. Pac. of San Diego v. A. A. Baxter
Corp. (1986) 176 Cal. App. 3d 577, 589.) Or, as the California Supreme
Court has stated, a “defendant’s settlement figure must not be grossly
disproportionate to what a reasonable person, at the time of the settlement,
would estimate the settling defendant’s liability to be.” (Tech-Bilt, supra,
38 Cal.3d at 499.)
When a motion seeking a
determination under Code of Civil Procedure section 877.6 is not opposed, the
burden on the moving parties to show that the settlement was made in good faith
is slight. (City of Grand Terrace v. Superior Court (1987) 192
Cal.App.3d 1251, 1261 [holding that a “barebones motion” including a
declaration setting forth “a brief background of the case is sufficient”].) 
When a good faith motion is
contested, however, the moving parties have the initial burden of producing
evidence in support of the requested good faith determination. (Id. at pp.
1261-1262.) “Section 877.6 and Tech-Bilt require an evidentiary showing,
through expert declarations or other means, that the proposed settlement is
within the reasonable range permitted by the criterion of good faith.” (Mattco
Forge v. Arthur Young & Co. (1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 1337, 1351.)
“Substantial evidence” is required. (Id. at p. 1352.) A declaration from
a settling defendant’s attorney that states, in conclusory fashion, that the
client has little or no share of the liability may not be sufficient. (Greshko
v. County of Los Angeles (1987) 194 Cal.App.3d 822, 834-35; see also 3 Weil
& Brown, California Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The
Rutter Group 2024) ¶¶ 12:774, 12:872-873.) 

The ultimate burden of
persuasion is on the party opposing the good faith determination.  The “party asserting a lack of good faith
shall have the burden of proof on that issue.” 
(Code Civ. Proc. § 877.6(d); see also 3 Weil & Brown, supra,
at ¶ 12:875.) 
Discussion
Plaintiff alleges that she was injured on February
20, 2020, when she tripped and fell on the public sidewalk outside of 222
Hilgard Avenue in Los Angeles. (Complaint, ¶ 9.) The City owns the public sidewalk,
and the Schnitmans are the abutting property owners.
Plaintiff and the Schnitmans settled, and the
Schnitmans filed an application for determination of good faith settlement. City
contests the request for a good faith determination.
The Court must now consider and weigh the
various factors set forth in Tech-Bilt and its progeny to determine whether
the Schnitman’s settlement with Plaintiff is a good faith settlement under Code
of Civil Procedure section 877.6. 
1.                 
Rough approximation of Plaintiff’s total recovery. 
Plaintiff alleges that she has incurred $29,266.75
in past medical expenses and that she expects to incur approximately $130,000
for future medical care. (Hernandez Decl., ¶ 3 & Exh. B, Responses to Form
Interrogatories 6.4 & 6.7.) The future medical costs are uncertain and, at
least to some degree, speculative at this time; Plaintiff might or might not
prevail on this element of her damages claim. 

Viewing this as of the time of settlement, as
the Court must, the Court determines that a rough approximation of Plaintiff’s
total recovery (including both special and general damages) is in the broad range
of $150,000-$500,000. 
2.                 
The settlor’s proportionate liability. 
This factor is vigorously contested.  
City contends that the Schnitmans are exclusively (or
at least predominantly) responsible for Plaintiff’s injuries. City’s expert
witness, Guy Stivers, a professional landscape architect and certified arborist,
opines that the lift in the sidewalk was caused by the roots of a ficus hedge
on the Schnitmans’ property. 
In opposition, the Schnitmans argue that their
expert, Greg J. Monfette, opined that the sidewalk uplift was caused by City’s
magnolia tree, not by the ficus hedge. Accordingly, the Schnitmans contend that
they bear little or no responsibility for Plaintiff’s injuries.
Plaintiff filed a brief supporting the good faith
determination. Among the arguments that Plaintiff makes is that City has
responsibility because the accident occurred on a public sidewalk and the City
had been on actual notice of the defect for almost five years prior to the
accident; according to Plaintiff, the Schnitmans called City for sidewalk
repairs in April 2015, but City never made any repairs.
Had this matter been tried, it is not certain how
the “battle of the experts” would have played out or what the finder of fact
would have determined.
Viewing this as of the time of settlement, as the
Court must, the Court determines that the settlor’s share of the proportionate
liability is in the range of 35 to 65 percent.
3.                 
The amount paid in settlement. 
The Schnitman’s have agreed to pay Plaintiff
$70,000. 
4.                 
The allocation of the settlement proceeds among
plaintiffs. 
As there is only one plaintiff, this factor does not
apply here.
5.                 
A recognition that a settlor should pay less in
settlement than he would if he were found liable after a trial.  
This factor supports a good faith determination.
6.                 
The settling party’s financial conditions and
insurance policy limits. 
This is not a
policy-limits settlement or a settlement based on inability to pay. The Schnitmans
have home insurance in the amount of $500,000, plus an umbrella policy
available for $2,000,000. 
 
7.                 
Any evidence of collusion, fraud, or tortious
conduct aimed to injure the interests of nonsettling defendants. 
There is no direct evidence in the record of collusion,
fraud, or tortious conduct. 
The Court has considered all of the evidence in
the record, all of the arguments of counsel, and each of the Tech-Bilt factors.
Taking all of this into account, the Court finds that the settlement between
Plaintiff and the Schnitmans is a good faith settlement within the meaning of
Code of Civil Procedure section 877.6. In particular, the Court finds that,
based on the information available at the time of the settlement, there was a
broad range of the  Schnitmans’ potential
liability, ranging from a low amount in the range of approximately $52,500 to a
high amount in the range of approximately $325,000. Given this wide range of
potential outcomes, and after consideration of all of the factors, a settlement
in the amount of $70,000 is “within the ballpark” and in good faith under
section 877.6 
Accordingly, the motion to contest the good
faith of the settlement is denied.
Conclusion
 
The
Court the Court finds the settlement between the Schnitmans and Plaintiff in
good faith Code of Civil Procedure section 877.6, denies City’s motion to
contest the Schnitmans’ application, and grants the Schnitmans’ application. 
 
Counsel
for the Schnitmans is ordered to give notice.
