TENTATIVE
 
The Motion for Summary Judgment as against
Plaintiff Tipple (only) is granted. 
 
Background
 
On January 21, 2021, Lindsey Esquivel and

Jeanine Rohn (“Defendant”) and Does 1 through 100 for general negligence and
motor vehicle negligence arising out of an automobile accident occurring on
April 21, 2019.
 
On June 22, 2022, default was entered
against Defendant. On August 18, 2022, a stipulation to set aside the default
was filed. Defendant filed her answer on September 7, 2022. 
 
On October 3, 2023, the Court granted
Defendant’s motion to deem Plaintiff Esquivel to have admitted the truth of the
matters specified in Defendant’s Requests for Admission (Set One). On October
4, 2023, the Court granted Defendant’s motion to deem Plaintiff Tipple to have
admitted the truth of the matters specified in Defendant’s Requests for
Admission (Set One).
 
Defendant filed this motion for summary
judgment against Plaintiff Tipple on May 23, 2024. 
 
No opposition has been filed.
 
Legal
Standard
 
“The purpose of the law of summary judgment is to provide
courts with a mechanism to cut through the parties’ pleadings in order to
determine whether, despite their allegations, trial is in fact necessary to
resolve their dispute.” (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25
Cal.4th 826, 843.) Code of Civil Procedure section 437c, subdivision (c),
“requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment if all the evidence
submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence’ and
uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that there is no triable
issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment
as a matter of law.” (Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7
Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.) “The function of the pleadings in a motion for summary
judgment is to delimit the scope of the issues; the function of the affidavits or
declarations is to disclose whether there is any triable issue of fact within
the issues delimited by the pleadings.” (Juge v. County of Sacramento
(1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 59, 67, citing FPI Development, Inc. v. Nakashima
(1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 367, 381-382.)
 
As to each cause
of action as framed by the complaint, a defendant moving for summary judgment
or summary adjudication must satisfy the initial burden of proof by presenting
facts to show “that one or more elements of the cause of action ... cannot be
established, or that there is a complete defense to the cause of action.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2); see also Aguilar, supra, 25
Cal.4th at pp. 850-851; Scalf v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128
Cal.App.4th 1510, 1520.) Once the defendant has met that burden, the burden
shifts to the plaintiff to show that a “triable issue of one or more material
facts exists as to the cause of action or a defense thereto.” (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 437c, subd. (p)(2); see also Aguilar, supra, 25 Cal.4th at pp.
850-851.)
A plaintiff or
cross-complainant moving for summary judgment or summary adjudication must
satisfy the initial burden of proof by presenting facts to show “that there is
no defense to a cause of action if that party has proved each element of the
cause of action entitling the party to judgment on the cause of action.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(1).) Once the plaintiff or cross-complainant has
met that burden, the burden shift to the defendant or cross-defendant to show
that a “triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to the cause of
action or a defense thereto.” (Ibid.)
The party opposing
a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication may not simply “rely upon
the allegations or denials of its pleadings” but must instead “set forth the
specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact exists.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 437c, subds. (p)(1) & (p)(2). To establish a triable issue of
material fact, the party opposing the motion must produce substantial responsive
evidence. (Sangster v. Paetkau (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 151, 166.)
Courts “liberally construe the evidence in support of the
party opposing summary judgment and resolve doubts concerning the evidence in
favor of that party.” (Dore v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc. (2006) 39 Cal.4th
384, 389.)
Request
for Judicial Notice
 
Defendant requests judicial notice of
Plaintiff’s Complaint, Defendant’s Answer, Requests for Admission (Set One)
propounded on Plaintiff Tipple, and the Court’s October 4 Minute Order in which
the court granted Defendant motion to deem Plaintiff Tipple to have admitted the
truth of the matters specified in Defendant’s Requests for Admission (Set One).
The request is granted.
Discussion
Plaintiff
Tipple asserts causes of action for motor vehicle negligence and general
negligence against Defendant.
The
basic elements of a cause of action for negligence are (1) the existence of a
legal duty; (2) breach of that duty; (3) causation; and (4) resulting
damages. (Brown v. USA Taekwondo (2021) 11 Cal.5th 204, 213;¿Romero v. Los Angeles Rams (2023) 91 Cal.App.5th
562, 567.) 
On October
4, 2024, the Court granted Defendant’s motion to deem Plaintiff Tipple to have
admitted the truth of the matters specified in Defendant’s Requests for
Admissions. The following were deemed admitted by Plaintiff Tipple: 
(1)  
REQUEST
FOR ADMISSION NO. 1: Admit that Defendant JEANINE ROHN is not liable for the
SUBJECT INCIDENT.
(2)  
REQUEST
FOR ADMISSION NO. 2: Admit that Defendant JEANINE ROHN was not negligent during
the SUBJECT INCIDENT.
(3)  
REQUEST
FOR ADMISSION NO. 3: Admit that YOU have no facts to support YOUR contention
that Defendant JEANINE ROHN is liable for the SUBJECT INCIDENT.
(4)  
REQUEST
FOR ADMISSION NO. 4: Admit that YOU have no facts to support YOUR contention
that Defendant JEANINE ROHN was negligent during the SUBJECT INCIDENT.
(5)  
REQUEST
FOR ADMISSION NO. 5: Admit that YOU are liable for the SUBJECT INCDENT.
(6)  
REQUEST
FOR ADMISSION NO. 6: Admit that YOU were negligent during the SUBJECT INCDENT.
(7)  
REQUEST
FOR ADMISSION NO. 7: Admit that YOU were not injured during the SUBJECT
INCDENT.
(Exh.
C.)
The
Court may take judicial notice of admissions that “contain statements of the
plaintiff or his agent which are inconsistent with the allegations of the pleading
before the court.” (Del E. Webb Corp. v. Structural Materials Co. (1981)
123 Cal.App.3d 593, 604-605.) Moreover, if a party does not move the trial
court to allow for withdrawal or amendment of an admission, the admission is
conclusively established against that party in the action. (See Joyce v.
Ford Motor Co. (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 1478, 1489.) 
“‘[A]
deemed admitted order establishes, by judicial fiat, that a nonresponding party
has responded to the requests by admitting the truth of all matters contained
therein.” (Wilcox v. Birtwhistle (1999) 21 Cal.4th 973, 979.) 
In
this case, Plaintiff Tipple’s deemed admissions establish that Plaintiff has no
evidence to support her negligence cause of action, and that Defendant was not
negligent. With this evidence, Defendant has satisfied her burden as a defendant moving
for summary judgment or summary adjudication to present facts to show “that one
or more elements of the cause of action ... cannot be established, or that
there is a complete defense to the cause of action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c,
subd. (p)(2).)  
Plaintiff
Tipple has not filed an opposition. 
Based
on the foregoing, the Court concludes that there are triable issue of material
fact, and that Defendant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law as against
Plaintiff Tipple. 
Defendant’s
motion for summary judgment is GRANTED.
Conclusion
Defendant’s
motion for summary judgment against Plaintiff Tipple is GRANTED.
 
Moving Party is
to provide notice.
