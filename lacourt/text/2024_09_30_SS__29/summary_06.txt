And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court will consider a motion to consolidate the DeSilveira Case and the Bledsoe Case for all purposes. The cases arise from the same motor vehicle accident and involve related issues of law and fact. The Court has previously related the cases, and the motion to consolidate is now ripe for consideration. The Court will call this matter to inquire whether DeSilveira opposes the motion and to discuss the consolidation motion. The Court notes that Mariscos is seeking a consolidation order that includes the Branson action, but this request is denied as the Branson action is not currently pending in Department 29 of the Spring Street Courthouse.
