And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the factors set forth in Tech-Bilt, Inc. v. Woodward-Clyde & Associates to determine whether the settlement between Plaintiff Cindi Witte and the Schnitmans (Randolph and Jacqueline) is in good faith. The Court finds that the settlement is a good faith settlement under Code of Civil Procedure section 877.6. The Court considered the factors, including the rough approximation of Plaintiff's total recovery, the settlor's proportionate liability, the amount paid in settlement, the allocation of settlement proceeds, and the settling party's financial conditions and insurance policy limits. The Court also considered the argument that the Schnitmans are exclusively (or predominantly) responsible for Plaintiff's injuries, and that the City is responsible for the accident due to its failure to repair the sidewalk. The Court finds that the settlement amount of $70,000 is "within the ballpark" and in good faith under section 877.6.
