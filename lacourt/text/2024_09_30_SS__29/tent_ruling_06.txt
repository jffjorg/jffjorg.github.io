23STCV04278
Motion to Consolidate
 
Tentative
 
The Court will call this matter.
 
Background
These two related cases arise out of a
motor vehicle accident that occurred on February 24, 2022, on Finch Road, just
west of Codoni Avenue, in unincorporated Stanislaus County.
The DeSilveira Case
In the first filed case, Case No.
23STCV04278 (the “DeSilveira Case”), Plaintiffs Manuel and Gorette DeSilveira filed
a complaint on February 27, 2023, against Defendants Mariscos Bahia, Inc. (“Mariscos”),
Rene Miguel Carillo (“Carillo”), and Does 1 through 50.
On April 13, 2023, Defendants Mariscos and Carillo
filed an answer to the complaint.
On September 29, 2023, Plaintiffs amended
their complaint to name Mariscos Bahia (Phoenix), Inc. (“Mariscos Phoenis”), as
Does 6 and 16.  
On December 13, 2023, Defendant Mariscos Phoenix,
filed its answer to the complaint.
On January 29, 2024, the Court, at the
request of Plaintiffs, dismissed all causes of action asserted on behalf of
Plaintiff Gorette DeSilveira.  Plaintiff
Manuel DeSilveira (“DeSilveira”) continues to prosecute his causes of action in
this case.
On April 24, 2024, the Court granted the
motion of Modesto Irrigation District (“District”) to intervene in the
DeSilveira Case.  The next day, District
filed its Complaint-in-Intervention.
On July 10, 2024, DeSilveira amended the
complaint to name Oasis Seafood, Inc. (“Oasis”), as Does 7 and 17.  
On September 17, 2024, the Court, at the
request of DeSilveira, dismissed Oasis without prejudice.
Trial is scheduled for January 27, 2025.
The Bledsoe Case
In the second filed case, Case No.
24STCV03147 (the “Bledsoe Case”), Plaintiffs Paul Bledsoe, Courtney Smith, and
Leonard Mitchell (collectively, the “Bledsoe Plaintiffs”) filed a complaint on
February 7, 2024, against Defendants Mariscos, Mariscos Phoenix, Carillo, and
Does 1 through 50.
On March 22, April 8, and April 24, 2024,
each of the named defendants filed an answer to the complaint.
No trial date has been set.
Relation and Consolidation
On April 2, 2024, the Bledsoe Plaintiffs filed
a Notice of Related Case in the DeSilveira Case and the Bledsoe Case,
identifying these two cases plus a third case, filed on February 21, 2024, in
Stanislaus County Superior Court (Branson v. Mariscos Bahia, Inc., Case
No. CV-24-001362) as related cases.
On April 11, 2024, the Court, per the Hon.
Lynne M. Hobbs, issued an order finding that the DeSilveira Case and the
Bledsoe Case are related.  The Bledsoe
Case was reassigned to Department 30 of the Spring Street Courthouse.
On April 23, 2024, the Court, per the Hon.
Lynne M. Hobbs, issued a new order, apparently reconsidering the order of April
11 on its own motion, and made a new finding that the DeSilveira Case and the
Bledsoe Case are not related.
On May 13, 2024, Department 30 of the
Spring Street Courthouse was closed.  The
DeSilveira Case and the Bledsoe Case were reassigned to Department 29 of the
Spring Street Courthouse.
On June 5, 2024, Mariscos filed a new Notice
of Related Case.  That notice was
rejected based upon the prior determination of Judge Hobbs.
Meanwhile, on May 17, 2024, Mariscos filed this
motion to consolidate the DeSilveira Case with the Bledsoe Case. On May 21, DeSilveira
filed an opposition.  Mariscos Phoenix and
District filed joinders in the motion motion. 
Mariscos filed a reply on June 7.
The motion previously came on for hearing
on June 14.  The Court discussed the
matter with counsel and then continued the hearings.  The motion is now scheduled for hearing on
September 30.  
On June 24, 2024, Mariscos filed a motion
to relate the DeSilveira Case and the Bledsoe Case.  Pursuant to California Rules of Court, rule 3.300(h)(1)(D)
and Los Angeles County Superior Court Rules, rule 3.3(f)(3), the motion was set
for hearing in Department 1 of the Stanley Mosk Courthouse on August 1, 2024.  The hearing was continued to, and held on,
August 29.  The Court, per the Hon.
Michelle Williams Court, granted the motion and related the DeSilveira Case and
the Bledsoe Case.
With the matters related, the Court can now
proceed to consider the consolidation motion. 
On September 19, 2024, Mariscos filed a supplemental declaration in
support of the consolidation motion advising the Court of the ruling on the
motion for relation.
Legal Standard
“When
actions involving a common question of law or fact are pending before the
court, it may order a joint hearing or trial of any or all the matters in issue
in the actions; it may order all the actions consolidated and it may make such orders
concerning proceedings therein as may tend to avoid unnecessary costs or
delay.”  (Code Civ. Proc. § 1048, subd.
(a).)  The purpose of consolidation is to
enhance trial court efficiency by avoiding unnecessary duplication of evidence
and the danger of inconsistent adjudications.  (See Todd-Stenberg v. Dalkon Shield
Claimants Trust (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 976, 978-979.)
There are two types of consolidation: a complete
consolidation for all purposes, and a more limited consolidation for trial or certain
other specific purposes (such as pre-trial discovery).  (Hamilton v. Asbestos Corp., Ltd. (2000) 22 Cal.4th
1127, 1147; Sanchez v.
Super. Ct. (1988) 203 Cal.App.3d 1391, 1396;
see also 3 Weil & Brown, California Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before
Trial (2024), ¶¶ 12:340-341.3.)  When
cases are consolidated for all purposes, “the two actions are merged into a
single proceeding under one case number and result in only one verdict or set
of findings and one judgment.”  (Hamilton,
supra, 22 Cal.4th at p. 1147; see also Sanchez, supra, 203 Cal.App.3d at p. 1396.)  In a
consolidation for limited purposes, “the two actions remain otherwise
separate.”  (Hamilton,
supra, 22 Cal.4th at p. 1147; see also Sanchez, supra, 203 Cal.App.3d at p. 1396.)  
“Consolidation
under Code of Civil Procedure section 1048 is permissive, and it is for the
trial court to determine whether the consolidation is for all purposes or for
trial only.” (Hamilton, supra, 22 Cal.4th at p. 1149.) 
The trial court
should not consolidate actions where prejudice would result to any party.  (See State Farm Mutual Auto. Ins. Co. v.
Superior Court (1956) 47 Cal.2d 428, 430.)
Discussion
Mariscos (jointed by Mariscos Phoenix and District)
seek an order consolidating the DeSilveira Case with the Bledsoe Case for all
purposes.  Mariscos argues, in essence,
that both cases arise
out of the same accident and involve largely identical issues of law and fact,
and consolidation will promote efficiency and avoid any risk of inconsistent
results. 
When
DeSilveira filed his opposition on May 21, the opposition was based exclusively
on a critical procedural defect in the motion: as the cases were not related,
there was no basis for consolidation. 
That was true at the time that the opposition was filed, but it is no
longer true, as the Court (per Judge Court) has now related the cases.
It
is not clear to the Court whether DeSilveira still opposes the motion to
consolidate and, if so, on what grounds. 
Given the relatively lengthy procedural history, the Court will call
this matter and inquire whether DeSilveira opposes the motion.
Finally, the Court also notes that although
it is unclear, to the extent that Mariscos is also seeking a consolidation
order that includes the Branson action, that request is denied, as the Branson
action is not currently pending in Department 29 of the Spring Street
Courthouse in the Los Angeles County Superior Court.
Conclusion
The Court will call this matter.
