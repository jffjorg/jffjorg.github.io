And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendant's motion to continue the trial is granted. The defendant seeks a continuance of four to six months to complete discovery, which the court finds is good cause. The court notes that the defendant filed several motions to compel discovery, including the depositions of the plaintiffs and independent medical examinations of the plaintiffs, which were granted earlier this month. The court has reset the trial date to a date on or after April 10, 2025, and has reset all deadlines based on the new trial date. The defendant is ordered to give notice of the new trial date.
