evidence, as it deprives the opposing party of a fair opportunity to
respond.  (San Diego Watercrafts, Inc.
v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2002) 102 Cal.App.4th 308, 316 [“due process
requires a party be fully advised of the issues to be addressed and be given
adequate notice of what facts it must rebut in order to prevail”]; see also Wall
Street Network Ltd. v. New York Times Co. (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 1171.)
