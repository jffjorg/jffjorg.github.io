And here is the English-text summary:

The Court's tentative ruling grants in part and denies in part the defendants' motion to set aside the defaults. The Court finds that the entry of defaults against the defendants was due to the CEO's reasonable mistake, who mistakenly believed the May 1, 2024 deadline for responding to the complaint. The Court sets aside the defaults and orders the defendants to file and serve an answer to the complaint by July 1, 2024. The Court also denies the defendants' request for attorneys' fees.
