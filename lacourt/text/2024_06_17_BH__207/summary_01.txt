And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the Plaintiffs' motion for leave to amend the complaint and orders them to file and serve the First Amended Complaint on or before July 15, 2024. The proposed amendment adds a cause of action for quasi contract seeking restitution and is necessary for the Plaintiffs to assert all applicable causes of action against the Defendants. The judge finds that the amendment will not prejudice the opposing party and that judicial policy favors the resolution of all disputed matters between the parties in the same lawsuit. The judge notes that the Plaintiffs' counsel has provided a supplemental declaration to address the Court's concerns regarding the original declaration.
