And here is the English text summary:

The tentative ruling is a summary of the judge's thinking on the plaintiff's motion to continue the trial to February 3, 2025. The plaintiff, Thomas Hardeman, is suing Posse Love Corporation and others for employment discrimination and related claims. The judge notes that the plaintiff has been unable to depose the individual defendants, Otis Alexander and Rahmid Stinson, and that defense counsel has withdrawn. The judge finds that the plaintiff has not diligently pursued discovery, and that the delay is not justified. Despite this, the judge grants the parties a short continuance to September 23, 2024, but denies the motion to continue the trial. The final status conference is set for September 13, 2024, and trial will start as scheduled on September 23, 2024.
