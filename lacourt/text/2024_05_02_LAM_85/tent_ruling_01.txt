  Case Number:  24STCV06083    Hearing Date:   May 2, 2024    Dept:  85 
North Mill Equipment
Finance LLC v. Lat Long Infrastructure, 24STCV06083
 
Tentative decision on application
for a writ of possession:  granted



 
            
            Plaintiff
North Mill Equipment Finance, LLC (“North”) seeks a writ of possession against Defendant
Lat Long Infrastructure, a limited liability company (“Long”) to recover four
2022 Ford trucks, (1) VIN 1FT8W3DT6NED42876, (2) VIN 1FT8W3DT8NED42877, (3) VIN
1FT8W3DTXNED42878, and (4) VIN 1FT8W3DTXNED42881 (collectively, “Trucks”).
            The
court has read and considered the moving papers (no opposition was filed) and
renders the following tentative decision.
 
            A. Statement of the Case
            1.
Complaint
            Plaintiff
North filed the Complaint against Defendant Long on March 12, 2024, alleging
(1) breach of written agreement; (2) account stated; (3) indebtedness; (4)
conversion; and (5) claim and delivery.  The
Complaint alleges in pertinent as follows.
            Long
entered into a written Contract in which North Mill Credit Trust to finance the
lease of the Trucks, which were collateral. 
At all relevant times, North has been the holder of a first priority security
interest in the Trucks.  The Certificates
of Title from the California Department of Motor Vehicles (“DMV”) reflects Ford
Motor Credit Company’s interest and the Plaintiff North maintains a security
interest.  The Contract gives
North the right to take and have immediate possession of the Trucks after default.  
            Long
breached the Contract on November 30, 2022 by failing to make the $4,870.07
monthly installment due.  Long has since
failed to make the regular monthly payments of $4,870.07 due thereafter.  The balance due and owing is $324,580.04.  Demands to turn over the Trucks have
failed.
            North
seeks recovery and a pretrial writ of possession for the Trucks, and $324,580.04 in
damages less proceeds from being able to re-lease the four Trucks. 
 
            2.
Course of Proceedings 
            On
March 21, 2024, Plaintiff North served Defendant Long with the Complaint,
Summons, and moving papers by personal service, effective March 21, 2024.
 
            B.
Applicable Law
            A
writ of possession is issued as a provisional remedy in a cause of action for
claim and delivery, also known as replevin. 
See Pillsbury, Madison
& Sutro v. Schectman, (1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 1279, 1288.  As a provisional remedy, the right to
possession is only temporary, and title and the right to possess are determined
in the final judgment.  
            A
writ of possession is available in any pending action.  It also is available where an action has been
stayed pending arbitration, so long as the arbitration award may be ineffectual
without provisional relief.  See CCP §1281.7. 
 
            1. Procedure
            Upon
the filing of the complaint or at any time thereafter, a plaintiff may apply
for an order for a writ of possession. 
Unlike attachment, where Judicial Council forms are optional, the
parties must use the mandatory approved Judicial Council forms in a claim and
delivery proceeding.  (Judicial Council
Forms CD-100 et seq.).
            A
plaintiff must make a written application for a writ of possession.  CCP §512.010(a), (b); (Mandatory Form
CD-100); CCP §512.010(a).  A verified
complaint alone is insufficient.  6
Witkin, California Procedure, (5th ed. 2008) §255, p.203.  The application may be supported by
declarations and/or a verified complaint. 
CCP §516.030.  The declarations or
complaint must set forth admissible evidence except where expressly permitted
to be shown on information and belief.  Id.
            The
application must be executed under oath and include: (1) A showing of the basis
of the plaintiff's claim and that the plaintiff is entitled to possession of
the property claimed.  If the plaintiff's
claim is based on a written instrument, a copy of it must be attached; (2) A
showing that the property is wrongfully detained by the defendant, how the
defendant came into possession of it, and, the reasons for the detention based
on the plaintiff’s best knowledge, information, and belief; (3) A specific description
of the property and statement of its value; (4) The location of the property
according to the plaintiff’s best knowledge, information, and belief.  If the property, or some part of it, is
within a private place which may have to be entered to take possession, a
showing of probable cause to believe that the property is located there; and
(5) A statement that the property has not been taken for (a) a tax, assessment,
or fine, pursuant to a statute, or (b) an execution against the plaintiff’s
property.  Alternatively, a statement
that if the property was seized for one of these purposes, it is by statute
exempt from such seizure.  CCP
§512.010(b).
 
            2. The Hearing
            Before
noticing a hearing, the plaintiff must serve the defendant with all of the
following: (1) A copy of the summons and complaint; (2) A Notice of Application
and Hearing; and (3) A copy of the application and any supporting
declaration.  CCP §512.030(a).  If the defendant has not appeared in the
action, service must be made in the same manner as service of summons and
complaint.  CCP §512.030(b).
            Each
party shall file with the court and serve upon the other party any declarations
and points and authorities intended to be relied upon at the hearing.  CCP §512.050. 
At the hearing, the court decides the merits of the application based on
the pleadings and declarations.   Id.  Upon a showing of good cause, the court may
receive and consider additional evidence and authority presented at the
hearing, or may continue the hearing for the production of such additional
evidence, oral or documentary, or the filing of other affidavits or points and
authorities.  Id.  
            The
court may order issuance of a writ of possession if both of the following are
found: (1) The plaintiff has established the probable validity of the
plaintiff’s claim to possession of the property; and (2) The undertaking
requirements of CCP section 515.010 are satisfied.  CCP §512.060(a).  “A claim has ‘probable validity’ where it is
more likely than not that the plaintiff will obtain a judgment against the
defendant on that claim.”  CCP
§511.090.  This requires that the
plaintiff establish a prima facie case; the writ shall not issue if the
defendant shows a reasonable probability of a successful defense to the claim
and delivery cause of action.  Witkin,
California Procedure, (5th ed. 2008) §261, p.208.  A defendant’s claim of defect in the property
is not a defense to the plaintiff’s right to possess it.  RCA Service Co. v. Superior Court,
(1982) 137 Cal.App.3d 1, 3.
            No
writ directing the levying officer to enter a private place to take possession
of any property may be issued unless the plaintiff has established that there
is probable cause to believe that the property is located there.  CCP §512.060(b).  
            The
successful plaintiff may obtain a preliminary injunction containing the same
provisions as a TRO that remains in effect until the property is seized by the
levying officer.[1]  CCP §513.010(c).  
            The
court may also issue a “turnover order” directing the defendant to transfer
possession of the property to the plaintiff (See Mandatory Form CD-120). 
The order must notify the defendant that failure to comply may subject
him or her to contempt of court.  CCP
§512.070.  The turnover remedy is not
issued in lieu of a writ, but in conjunction with it to provide the plaintiff
with a less expensive means of obtaining possession.  See
Edwards v Superior Court, (“Edwards”) (1991) 230 Cal.App.3d 173,
178.
 
            3. The Plaintiff’s Undertaking
            Generally,
the court cannot issue an order for a writ of possession until the plaintiff
has filed an undertaking with the court (Mandatory Form CD-140 for personal
sureties).  CCP §515.010(a).  The undertaking shall provide that the
sureties are bound to the defendant for the return of the property to the
defendant, if return of the property is ordered, and for the payment to the
defendant of any sum recovered against the plaintiff.  Id. 
The undertaking shall be in an amount not less than twice the value of
the defendant's interest in the property or in a greater amount.  Id. 
The value of the defendant's interest in the property is determined by
the market value of the property less the amount due and owing on any
conditional sales contract or security agreement and all liens and encumbrances
on the property, and any other factors necessary to determine the defendant’s
interest in the property.  Id.
            However,
where the defendant has no interest in the property, the court must waive the requirement
of the plaintiff’s undertaking and include in the order for issuance of the
writ the amount of the defendant’s undertaking sufficient to satisfy the
requirements of CCP section 515.020(b).  CCP
§515.010(b). 
 
            C. Statement of Facts
            Plaintiff North is the successor-in-interest to Equilease
Financial Services, Inc., the servicing agent for North Mill Credit Trust
(“Credit Trust”).  Miller Decl., ¶1.  On May 17, 2022, Credit Trust and Defendant
Long entered into a Commercial Lease Agreement (“Lease”), along with other
related agreements for the acquisition of four Trucks.  Miller Decl., ¶¶ 3-4, Ex. 1. 
Pursuant to
the Lease, Long was required pay a Document and Administration Fee of $600 and make
60 monthly installment payments of $4,870.07, beginning on June 30, 2022 and
continuing on the 30th day of each month thereafter.  Miller Decl., ¶5, Ex 1.  Credit Trust agreed to finance the purchase
of the Trucks and was granted a security interest in the them.  Miller Decl., ¶ 18, Ex. 1.  In the event of Long’s default for failure to
pay, Credit Trust had the right to immediately repossess the Trucks.  Miller Decl., ¶18, Ex. 1.  
            On November 30, 2022, Long breached the Lease by failing
to make the required monthly payment of $4,870.07 and any required payment of
$4,870.07 thereafter.  Miller Decl.,
¶9.  On January 5, 2023, Plaintiff North
issued a Notice of Default to Defendant Long and demanded that it cure the breach.  Miller Decl., ¶10, Ex. 3.  Defendant Long subsequently failed to cure
its breach and Plaintiff North accelerated the sums due under the Lease.  Miller Decl., ¶12, Ex. 1.  As of February 23, 2024, the balance due and
owing is $324,580.04.  Miller Decl., ¶
14, Ex 4.  Demands to turn over the Trucks
have failed.  Miller Decl., ¶ 22.  
            North
is informed and believes that the Trucks have a total value of $196,000.  Miller Decl., ¶ 26.  This opinion is based on the Trucks’ original
price, their age and forecast of current market values, conversations with
various equipment vendors, and its Vice-President’s experience in equipment
leasing.  Miller Decl., ¶ 26.  
As of the date of March 5, 2024, Defendant North has an
unpaid balance on the agreement of $324,580.04 which is secured in the amount
of $196,000, leaving an unsecured balance of $128,580.04.  Miller Decl., ¶ 26, Ex. 4. 
            Plaintiff
North has Defendant Long’s address on file as 3200 Cochran Street, Simi Valley,
CA 93065.  Miller Decl., ¶¶ 14-15, 20,
Ex. 3.  
 
            D. Analysis
            Plaintiff
North seeks a writ of possession and turnover order against Defendant Long for
the four Trucks.  
 
            1.
Breach of Agreement
            The
Lease required Long to make 60 monthly installments of $4.870.07 for the Trucks.  Miller Decl., ¶5, Ex. 1.  Any late payment would entitle the assignor
to accelerate the amount owed and repossess the Trucks.  Miller Decl., ¶ 1, Ex. 1.  The Certificates of Origin from the DMV
reflect Olathe Ford’s interest in the Trucks as the distributor and
dealer.  Miller Decl., ¶2.   They do not show Credit Trust as owner.  However, the Lease declares Credit Trust as
the Lessor and provides that it has a security interest in the Trucks.  Miller Decl., ¶¶ 3, 18, Ex. 1.  Plaintiff North is the servicing agent for
Credit Trust.  Miller Decl., ¶1.
            In seeking a writ of possession, the supporting declaration
must be set forth with particularity. 
CCP §516.030.  This means that the
plaintiff must show evidentiary facts rather than the ultimate facts commonly
found in pleadings.  A recitation of
conclusions without a foundation of evidentiary facts is insufficient.  See Rodes v. Shannon, (1961)
194 Cal.App.2d 743, 749 (declaration containing conclusions inadequate for
summary judgment); Schessler v. Keck, (1956) 138 Cal.App.2d 663, 669
(same). 
            Plaintiff
North presents evidence of Defendant Long’s “Statement of Account” which
provides the relevant break down.  The
Statement provides that Defendant North owes $38,393.23 as the Total Amount
Past Due plus $286,187.01 as the Total Future Payments Remaining which equals $324,580.04
as the Total Amount Owing.   Miller Decl., ¶6, Ex. 4.  Long owes $324,580.04. 
 
            2.
Undertaking 
            The
undertaking shall be in an amount not less than twice the value of the
defendant's interest in the property or in a greater amount.  CCP §515.010(a).  
            The
Trucks’ collective value is estimated to be $196,000.[2]  Miller Decl., ¶ 26.  The balance Defendant Long owes is $324,580.04.  Miller Decl., ¶26, Ex 4.  The difference is $196,000 - $324,580.04= -$128,580.04.   Long has no legal interest in the Trucks. 
 
            3.
Redelivery
            When
an undertaking is required, the defendant may prevent the plaintiff from taking
possession by filing an undertaking in an amount equal to either the amount of
the plaintiff’s undertaking (CCP
§515.020(a)) or the amount determined by the court under CCP section
515.010(b).  The redelivery
bond will be the vehicle value of $196,000.
 
            4.
Order to Enter Private Property
            No
writ directing the levying officer to enter a private place to take possession
of any property may be issued unless the plaintiff has established that there
is probable cause to believe that the property is located there.  CCP §512.060(b).  
            Plaintiff
North has Defendant Long’s address as 3200 Cochran Street, Simi Valley, CA
93065 and Declarant Miller believes the Trucks are currently at this
location.  Miller Decl., ¶ 20, Ex 3.  This appears to  be a commercial address, but if it is a
private address Plaintiff North may obtain a writ to enter it.  
 
5. Turnover Order
            The
court may issue a turnover order directing the defendant to transfer possession
of the property to the plaintiff (See
Mandatory Form CD-120).  The order must
notify the defendant that failure to comply may subject him or her to contempt
of court.  CCP §512.070.  The turnover remedy is not issued in lieu of
a writ, but in conjunction with it to provide the plaintiff with a less
expensive means of obtaining possession. 
See Edwards, supra,
230 Cal.App.3d at 178.  
            North
requests a turnover order compelling Defendant Long to transfer possession of
the Trucks.  Mem. at 2.  The request for a turnover order is granted.
 
            E.
Conclusion
            The
application for a writ of possession and turnover order for the Trucks is
granted.  The redelivery bond  shall be $196,000.  The levying officer may enter a private
residence at 3200 Cochran Street, Simi Valley, CA 93065., as well as any
commercial or public address.
