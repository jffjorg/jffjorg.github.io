And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has granted the Motion to be Relieved as Counsel filed by Counsel for the MedMen Defendants, Scott J. Leipzig and Tim C. Hsu, on behalf of Allen Matkins Leck Gamble Mallory & Natsis LLP. The motion is based on an irreconcilable breakdown of the attorney-client relationship, which renders it difficult for the attorneys to carry out their employment effectively. The attorneys have demonstrated good cause for withdrawal, and the Court finds that granting the motion is in the best interests of the clients. The attorneys are hereby relieved of their duties as counsel, and they are ordered to give notice to the clients and all other parties in the case.
