[TENTATIVE]
ORDER OVERRULING DEMURRER TO PLAINTIFFS’ COMPLAINT
 
I.       BACKGROUND
      This action arises from alleged violations laws and ordinances
governing the habitability of rented premises. Plaintiffs allege 14 causes of
action including a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress
(ninth cause of action.)
II.     LEGAL
STANDARDS
      A demurrer tests the
sufficiency of a complaint as a matter of law and raises only questions of law.
(Schmidt
v. Foundation Health (1995) 35
Cal.App.4th 1702, 1706
      The court may not consider contentions,
deductions, or conclusions of fact or law. (Moore
v. Conliffe (1994) 7 Cal.4th
634, 638.) Plaintiff is required to allege facts sufficient to establish every
element of each cause of action. (Rakestraw
v. California Physicians Service (2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 39, 43.) Where the complaint
fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, courts should
sustain the demurrer. Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10(e); (Zelig
v. County of Los Angeles
(2002) 27 Cal.4th 1112, 1126.)
      Sufficient facts are the essential facts
of the case stated, "with reasonable precision and with particularity that
is sufficiently specific to acquaint the defendant with the nature, source, and
extent of his cause of action.” (Gressley
v. Williams (1961) 193
Cal.App.2d 636, 643-644.)  Whether the
Plaintiff will be able to prove the pleaded facts is irrelevant. (Stevens
v. Superior Court (1986) 180
Cal.App.3d 605, 609–610.)
III.    DISCUSSION
      Defendant demurs to the ninth cause of
action for intentional infliction of emotional distress on grounds the claim
does not allege outrageous conduct necessary to support the claim. Plaintiffs
argue the claim is adequately alleged. In reply, Defendant argues that
Plaintiff alleges only that Plaintiffs experienced uninhabitable conditions
which is insufficient to support the claim. 
      To prevail on this claim, plaintiff must
allege facts showing (1) extreme and outrageous conduct with the intention of
causing, or reckless disregard of the probability of causing emotional
distress, and (2) Plaintiff suffered severe or extreme emotional distress as a
proximate result. (Christensen v. Superior Court (1991) 54 Cal.3d 868, 903.)
      Conduct is “extreme and outrageous” where
a defendant (1) abuses a relation or position which gives him power to damage
the plaintiff’s interest; (2) knows the plaintiff is susceptible to injuries
through mental distress; or (3) acts intentionally or unreasonably with the
recognition that the acts are likely to result in illness through mental
distress.” (Agarwal v. Johnson (1979) 25 Cal.3d 932, 946.)
      Contrary to Defendant’s arguments,
Plaintiffs allege more than that they experienced uninhabitable conditions. Plaintiffs
allege that the conditions threatened health and safety, the conditions were
not abated, which conditions included water intrusions and/or leaks within the
rental unit, faulty electrical lighting, plumbing and drainage issues, and
interruption of the water supply and heating facilities, such that Plaintiffs
were constructively evicted. (Complaint, ¶ 50.)  Plaintiffs allege Defendant knew that this
conduct violated California law. (Id.) Defendant
allegedly blamed Plaintiffs for the condition of the premises. (Complaint, ¶
55.) Defendant failed to give Plaintiffs their security deposit and has
attempted to remodel the unit at Plaintiffs’ expense. (Complaint, ¶ 55.)
      If the court concludes that reasonable
minds may differ as to whether the conduct rises to the level of “extreme and
outrageous conduct,” then “it is for the jury, subject to the control for the
court, to determine whether, in the particular case, the conduct has been
sufficiently extreme and outrageous to result in liability.” (Alcorn v. Anbro Engineering, Inc. (1970) 2 Cal.3d 493, 499.)
IV.  
CONCLUSION
      Based on the foregoing, the demurrer to
the complaint is OVERRULED. Defendant is ordered to file an answer within 10
days.
