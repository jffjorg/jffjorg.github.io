And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on the demurrer to the complaint filed by the defendant, Gabriela Lawrence, in the case of Maria Lopez et al v. Gabriela Lawrence (Case Number 24STCV09200). The plaintiff alleges that the defendant violated laws and ordinances governing the habitability of rented premises, resulting in uninhabitable conditions, including water intrusions and/or leaks, faulty electrical lighting, and interruption of water supply and heating facilities. The plaintiff claims that the defendant's conduct was "extreme and outrageous" and caused them emotional distress.

The judge has overruled the demurrer, finding that the plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts to state a cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress. The judge notes that the plaintiff alleges that the defendant knew that their conduct was in violation of California law and that the defendant failed to provide a security deposit and attempted to remodel the unit at the plaintiff's expense.

The judge concludes that the demurrer is overruled and orders the defendant to file an answer within 10 days.
