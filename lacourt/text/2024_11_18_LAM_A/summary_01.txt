Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This tentative ruling sustains the demurrer to the second and third causes of action alleged in the first amended cross-complaint. The claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress and physical abuse are defective. The judge finds that the allegations do not meet the required standards for these claims, specifically that the alleged conduct is not extreme and outrageous, and that the allegations do not fit within the definition of "physical abuse" as described in the Welfare and Institutions Code. The judge sustains the demurrer without leave to amend.
