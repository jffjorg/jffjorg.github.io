[TENTATIVE] ORDER SUSTAINING
 DEMURRER TO THE FIRST AMENDED CROSS-COMPLAINT WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND 
 
I.      
BACKGROUND
      The first
amended complaint alleges 21 causes of action arising from alleged harassment,
discrimination, retaliation and other claims in violation of the Fair
Employment and Housing Act (“FEHA”). Plaintiff, who was employed as a
housekeeper, also alleges assault and battery and wage and hour claims in
violation of the Labor Code. 
      Khosrow
Benji (“Cross-Complainant” or “Benji”), initially filed a cross-complaint
alleging claims for negligence, assault, battery, intentional infliction of
emotional distress and physical abuse. On July 11, 2024, the Hon. Anne
Richardson, sustained demurrer with leave to amend the claims for intentional
infliction of emotional distress, battery and for physical elder abuse. (M.O.
7/11/24, p. 4-6.). 
      On July
29, 2024, Cross-Complainant filed a first amended cross-complaint (“FAXC”) against
Plaintiff (“Cross-Defendant”) alleging three causes of action limited to
negligence, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and physical elder
abuse arising from injuries suffered by Cross-Complainant, who slipped on the
tile patio at his residence after Cross-Defendant washed it. 
 
II.    
ARGUMENTS
      Cross-Defendant
demurs to the emotional distress and elder abuse claims. The FAXC was filed
five days late. The Hon. Anne Richardson sustained demurrer as noted on July
11, 2024, granting 14 days leave to amend the claims at issue here. 
      Cross-Defendant
contends that Benji did not allege extreme and outrageous conduct to support
the claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress. The alleged facts
do not support a conclusion that Cross-Defendant acted “outrageously.” The
court should not grant further leave to amend.  As to the elder abuse claim, Cross-Defendant did
not allege facts to support the “physical abuse” allegation. 
      In
opposition, Benji argues that the claims are adequately alleged. The elder
abuse claim is alleged with required specificity. 
III.   
LEGAL STANDARDS
      A demurrer tests the sufficiency of a
complaint as a matter of law and raises only questions of law. (Schmidt
v. Foundation Health (1995) 35 Cal.App.4th
1702, 1706.) In testing the complaint’s sufficiency, the court must assume the
truth of the properly pleaded factual allegations as well as facts that can be
reasonably inferred from those expressly pleaded facts. The court may also
consider matters properly subject to judicial notice. (Blank
v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.)
      The court may not consider contentions,
deductions, or conclusions of fact or law. (Moore
v. Conliffe (1994) 7 Cal.4th 634, 638.) Plaintiff is
required to allege facts sufficient to establish every element of each cause of
action. (Rakestraw
v. California Physicians Service (2000) 81
Cal.App.4th 39, 43.) Where the complaint fails to state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action, courts should sustain the demurrer. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 430.10(e); Zelig
v. County of Los Angeles (2002) 27 Cal.4th
1112, 1126.)
      Sufficient facts are the essential facts
of the case "with reasonable precision and with particularity that is
sufficiently specific to acquaint the defendant with the nature, source, and
extent of his cause of action.” (Gressley
v. Williams (1961) 193 Cal.App.2d 636, 643-644.)  Whether the Plaintiff will be able to prove
the pleaded facts is irrelevant. (Stevens
v. Superior Court (1986) 180 Cal.App.3d
605, 609–610.) 
      A demurrer may also be sustained if a
complaint is “uncertain.” Uncertainty exists where a complaint’s factual
allegations are so confusing, they do not sufficiently apprise a defendant of
the issues it is being asked to meet. (Williams
v. Beechnut Nutrition Corp. (1986) 185
Cal.App.3d 135, 139, fn. 2; Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10(f).)
      A pleading is required to assert general
allegations of ultimate fact. Evidentiary facts are not required. (Quelimane Co. v. Stewart Title
Guaranty Co. (1998) 19 Cal. 4th 26, 47; Lim
v. The.TV Corp. Internat. (2002) 99 Cal. App.
4th 684, 690.) However, unlike federal courts, California state courts are not
a notice pleading jurisdiction, and notice alone is not a sufficient basis for
any pleading. California is a fact pleading jurisdiction. Merely putting an
opposing party on notice is not sufficient. (Bach
v. County of Butte (1983) 147 Cal.App.3d
554, 561; see Diodes,
Inc. v. Franzen (1968) 260 Cal.App.2d
244, 250.)
 
IV.  
DISCUSSION
A.     Demurrer
is sustained as to the second cause of action for intentional infliction of
emotional distress 
      To
prevail on a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress, plaintiff
must allege facts showing (1) extreme and outrageous conduct with the intention
of causing, or reckless disregard of the probability of causing emotional
distress, (2) that plaintiff suffered severe or extreme emotional distress, and
(3) actual and proximate causation. (Christensen
v. Superior Court (1991) 54 Cal.3d 868, 903.) 
      Behavior is considered sufficiently
“outrageous” if defendant “(1) abuses a relation or position which gives him
power to damages the plaintiff’s interest; (2) knows the plaintiff is
susceptible to injuries through mental distress; or (3) acts intentionally or
unreasonably with the recognition that the acts are likely to result in illness
through mental distress.” (Agarwal
v. Johnson (1979) 25 Cal.3d 932, 946.)
“Outrageous conduct” may be considered “irritating, insulting or even
distressing but it is not actionable and must simply be endured without resort
to legal redress.” (Yurick
v. Superior Court (1989) 209 Cal.App.3d 1116, 1129.)

      Cross-Complainant alleges that
Cross-Defendant washed the stone tile patio despite being requested not to;
washed the area with soap and water, making the area slippery and a fall hazard;
failed to notify Cross-Complainant that she had washed the patio, and that the
area was wet and slippery. (FAXC, ¶ 26.) These allegations do not reach the
level of being so extreme as to "exceed all bounds of that usually
tolerated in a civilized community." (Davidson
v. City of Westminster (1982) 32 Cal.3d 197, 210
["The tort calls for intentional, or at least reckless conduct—conduct
intended to inflict injury or engaged in with the realization that injury will
result."].)  Accordingly, demurrer
is SUSTAINED. 
 
B.     Demurrer
to the elder abuse claim based on physical abuse is SUSTAINED. 
      A defendant is liable for physical abuse
of an elder person where it is proven by clear and convincing evidence that
defendant is guilty of recklessness, oppression, fraud, or malice in the
commission of such abuse. (Welf.
& Inst. Code, § 15657.) “Physical abuse” is
specifically defined by statute to mean assault, battery, assault with a deadly
weapon, unreasonable physical restraint, prolonged or continual deprivation of
food or water, sexual assault, or use of a physical or chemical restraint or
psychotropic medication. (Welf.
& Inst. Code, § 15610.63.)
      Cross-Complainant alleges that
Cross-Defendant committed physical abuse “by an unlawful attempt, coupled with
a present ability, to commit a violent injury on Cross-Complainant, and/or a
willful and unlawful use of force or violence” by washing the floor although
asked not to, using water and liquid dish soap on the stone tile floor, making
the area slippery and a fall hazard, and not warning that the area was wet.
(FAXC ¶ 33.)
      These allegations do not fit within the definition
of “physical abuse” as specifically described. Therefore, demurrer is
SUSTAINED. 
V.    
CONCLUSION
      Judge Richardson previously evaluated
these claims, found them defective, and gave Cross-Complainant leave to amend.
The claims remain defective. Accordingly, demurrer to the second and third
causes of action alleged in the first amended cross-complaint is SUSTAINED
without leave to amend.
