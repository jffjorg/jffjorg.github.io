[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING
PLAINTIFF’S
 MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT OR IN THE ALTERNATIVE, FOR SUMMARY
ADJUDICATION
 
I.      
BACKGROUND
      This is
an action for unlawful detainer arising from Defendant’s alleged failure to pay
rent pursuant to a commercial lease agreement. Plaintiff moves for summary
judgment of all claims for possession of the property, past due rent, and
damages.       
      Defendant,
Augusto C. Valino, dba Norma’s Income Tax & Bookkeeping Services &
Philca Enterprises and Service Bureau (“Defendant”), filed an answer on October
11, 2024. Plaintiff filed a request for entry of default on October 28, 2024,
against all unnamed occupants, which the clerk rejected. Plaintiff timely
served the motion on Defendant, who did not file an opposition. 
II.    
ARGUMENTS
      In the
context of an unlawful detainer action, a motion for summary judgment may be
made at any time after the answer is filed upon five days’ notice. The motion
shall be granted or denied on the same basis as a motion under Code of Civil
Procedure, section 437c. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1170.7.) An order granting the
motion is appropriate if all the papers submitted show that there is no triable
issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a
judgment as a matter of law.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 437c(c).) Plaintiff’s burden
is to establish that there is no defense to a cause of action if Plaintiff can
prove each element of the cause of action entitling Plaintiff to judgment.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 437c(p)(1).) If that threshold burden is established, the
burden shifts to Defendant to demonstrate with admissible evidence that a
triable issue of one or more material facts exist. (Id.) 
      A tenant of real property is guilty of
unlawful detainer where the tenant continues in possession after failing to pay
rent pursuant to the lease agreement, and after the expiration of the three-day
notice to pay rent or quit. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1161 subd(2). ) To prevail on the motion, Plaintiff must
demonstrate strict compliance with the statutory notice requirements including
providing the tenant with three days' written notice to pay rent or quit the
premises and proper service of the notice. (Culver
Center Partners East #1, L.P. v. Baja Fresh Westlake Village, Inc. (2010) 185 Cal.App.4th 744, 749–750.) 
III.   
DISCUSSION
      Plaintiff
served Defendant with a three-day notice to pay rent or quit on September 20,
2024, requiring Defendant to pay $33,384.00 in back rent or to surrender the
premises within three business days. (Mot. Exhs, D and E.) The notice indicated
that if Defendant failed to pay back rent, Plaintiff would elect forfeiture of
the lease, which will terminate. (Ex. D.) 
      The
notice provided that Plaintiff would accept any partial payments made after
service of the notice, but Plaintiff may file legal action to terminate the
lease, recover possession, and for damages, attorney’s fees, and costs. (Id.)

      Plaintiff
acknowledges acceptance of a partial payment by Defendant of $5,600 before the
three-day notice expired but commenced legal action for the difference as
permitted by statute and as alleged in the complaint. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1161.1 subd. (b) ["If the landlord accepts a partial
payment of rent, including any payment pursuant to subdivision (a), after
serving notice pursuant to Section 1161, the landlord, without any further
notice to the tenant, may commence and pursue an action under this chapter to
recover the difference between the amount demanded in that notice and the
payment actually received, and this shall be specified in the complaint."]
      Plaintiff
submits a copy of the signed leased agreement and amendments thereto. (Ex. A.)  Defendant defaulted on his obligations to pay
rent since June 21, 2023. (Ex. B.) The complaint alleges holdover damages accruing
at $91.46 for each day Defendant remains in possession from October 1, 2024,
until the date of judgment. (Complaint, 4:3-6.) Defendant remains in
possession. (Beth Bamba decl. ¶ 9.)  
      The
undisputed evidence supports damages as calculated below. The proposed order
conforms with this calculation.

  notice


$33,384.00

IV.  
CONCLUSION
      Plaintiff
has met its burden of establishing that the undisputed facts entitle Plaintiff
to summary judgment. Accordingly, Plaintiff’s for summary judgment is GRANTED.
