[TENTATIVE] ORDER  DEFENDANT’S
 MOTION TO COMPEL ARBITRATION AND STAY PROCEEDINGS
 
I.      
BACKGROUND
      The
Complaint alleges that Plaintiff retained Defendant to represent Plaintiff in a
legal matter. Plaintiff alleges that Defendant concealed matters from Plaintiff
and intentionally misrepresented facts. Plaintiff alleges claims for
negligence, breach of fiduciary duty, and breach of the implied covenant of
good faith and fair dealing.
      Defendant
moves to compel arbitration based on the parties’ written agreement retainer
agreement. Plaintiff does not oppose sending the matter to arbitration and
attempted to obtain Defendant’s stipulation, but Defendant did not respond.
Plaintiff asks the court to retain jurisdiction. 
      The court can order the parties to arbitrate
the matter on petition of a party to an arbitration agreement. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.2.) The petitioner’s burden is to establish
that a valid arbitration agreement exists. The opposing party’s burden is to
establish a defense to enforcement based on a preponderance of evidence.  (Molecular Analytical Systems v. Ciphergen
Biosystems, Inc. (2010) 186
Cal.App.4th 696, 705.)
      Plaintiff submits a copy of the parties’
retainer agreement which requires arbitration of “any dispute as to alleged
breach of professional duty.” (Ex. 1, p. 2, ¶ 12.) Plaintiff does not oppose arbitrating
the alleged claims.
      Accordingly, Defendant’s motion is
GRANTED. The court sets an OSC: Re Completion of Arbitration for September
 5, 2025,  in Department 40 of
the Stanley Mosk Courthouse at 8:30 a.m. The parties are ORDERED to submit a written
joint status report re: arbitration and/or a stipulation and order five days
prior to the hearing.
