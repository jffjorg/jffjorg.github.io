And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the motion to expunge the lis pendens and mechanics lien filed by AT&C Investment, LLC. The court finds that the mechanic's lien and related lis pendens are invalid because Claunch, the plaintiff, did not serve the statutorily required preliminary notice before recording the lien. The court also finds that there is no evidence of a contractual relationship between Claunch and AT&C, and that Claunch's arguments about the terms of the lease agreement do not lend themselves to an understanding that AT&C had actual knowledge of the electrical work completed by Claunch at the property. The court has granted AT&C's request for attorneys' fees in the amount of $6,324.29.
