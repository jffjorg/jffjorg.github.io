And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion to stay proceedings pending arbitration filed by defendants Robert Oberlander, Natalie Martin, Silvi Kopytov, and Woodland Hills Recovery Center. The defendants argue that the issues involved in the JAMS arbitration are related to the issues in front of the court, and that proceeding with the allegations against Silvi Kopytov, Oberlander, and Martin while the action against Gennadiy Kopytov proceeds in arbitration presents a significant risk of unfairness and duplication of effort. The judge agrees, stating that the parties, causes of action, and issues to be determined in this action directly overlap with those being determined in the JAMS arbitration, and that a stay is the fairest and most efficient solution to the issues before the court. The court will stay the proceedings pending the outcome of the JAMS arbitration.
