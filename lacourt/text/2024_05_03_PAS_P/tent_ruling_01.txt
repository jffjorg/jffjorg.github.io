ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO COMPEL DEPOSITION AND DENYING THE REQUEST FOR MONETARY
SANCTIONSI.        INTRODUCTION
In this lemon law case, Plaintiff
Andy Meraz sues American Honda Motor Co. Inc. (Honda) for defects with the 2022
Honda Accord he purchased. 
Before the Court is Plaintiff’s motion to compel Honda
to produce a Person Most Qualified for deposition. The motion was filed March 4,
2024. Honda filed an opposition on April 22, 2024. Plaintiff filed a reply on
April 26, 2024. 
           For
the reasons set forth below, the motion to compel the deposition of Honda’s PMQ
is GRANTED. 
 
II.       LEGAL STANDARD
 “If the
deponent named is not a natural person, the deposition notice shall describe
with reasonable particularity the matters on which examination is requested. In
that event, the deponent shall designate and produce at the deposition those of
its officers, directors, managing agents, employees, or agents who are most
qualified to testify on its behalf as to those matters to the extent of any
information known or reasonably available to the deponent. (CCP § 2025.230.)
Code
Civ. Proc. Section 2025.450 
(a)
If, after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action or an
officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a party, or a person
designated by an organization that is a party under Section 2025.230, without
having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to appear for examination,
or to proceed with it, or to produce for inspection any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order compelling
the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of
any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in
the deposition notice. 
(b)
A motion under subdivision (a) shall comply with both of the following: 
(1)
The motion shall set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the
production for inspection of any document, electronically stored information,
or tangible thing described in the deposition notice. 
(2)
The motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under
Section 2016.040, or, when the deponent fails to attend the deposition and
produce the documents, electronically stored information, or things described
in the deposition notice, by a declaration stating that the petitioner has
contacted the deponent to inquire about the nonappearance. 
. .
. 
(g)(1)
If a motion under subdivision (a) is granted, the court shall impose a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) in favor of the
party who noticed the deposition and against the deponent or the party with
whom the deponent is affiliated, unless the court finds that the one subject to
the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances
make the imposition of the sanction unjust. 
 
III.     ANALYSIS
           A. Meet and Confer Efforts Were Sufficient
           Plaintiff offers the declaration of his
attorney, Angelica Zamudio, in support of meet and confer efforts. (Zamudio
Declaration.) Zamudio declares that she first sent a meet and confer letter on January
25, 2024 as to Honda’s served objections to the deposition notice. (Zamudio
Decl. ¶ 5, Exh. C.) She declares that she logged into the deposition on January
30, 2024, but Honda nor its PMQ appeared. (Zamudio Decl. ¶ 8.) She declares she
sent follow-up emails on January 9, January 18, January 25, January 30,
February 8, and February 13as to PMQ dates. (Zamudio Decl. ¶ 9.) Honda has not
provided dates. (Zamudio Decl. ¶ 9.)
The Court finds that meet and confer efforts were
sufficient. 
B.
Motion
Plaintiff first served a notice of deposition on January
9, 2024, as to a January 30, 2024 deposition date. (Zamudio Decl. ¶ 3, see Exh.
A.) The deposition notice seeks testimony from the person most qualified about
why Honda did not purchase the vehicle back from Plaintiff prior to this
lawsuit being filed, the nature and extent of the vehicle’s repair history, and
other similar topics. On January 22, 2024, Defendant Honda served objections to
the deposition notice. (Zamudio Decl. ¶ 4, see Exh. B.) 
Code
Civ. Proc. Section 2017.010 permits a party to “obtain discovery regarding any
matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the subject matter . . . if the
matter is either itself admissible in evidence or appears reasonably calculated
to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.” (CCP § 2017.010.) 
Plaintiff urges that the information sought in the PMQ
deposition is relevant to his lemon law claims. (Motion, p. 10-11.) Plaintiff
cites CACI 3201 for the elements of a lemon law claim;
namely, that plaintiff had a defective new car, presented it for repairs,
repairs were inadequate and defendant refused to replace or buy back the car. (CACI
3201.) Information as to Honda’s
analysis of whether Plaintiff’s car should be bought back, the repair history
of the car, Honda’s lemon law policies and procedures and Honda’s staff
training regarding lemon law is relevant to Plaintiff’s claim, as they relate
to the elements of lemon law. Plaintiff also cites several cases for the
relevance of the car manufacturer’s policies, prior vehicle repairs and the
manufacturer’s criteria for determining if a car is a lemon. (See e.g., Krotin
v. Porsche Cars North America, Inc. (1995) 38 Cal. App.4th 294, 302; Kwan
v. Mercedes-Benz of North America (1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 174, 186; Oregel
v. American Isuzu Motors Inc. (1995) 90 Cal.App.4th 1094; Jensen
v. BMW of North America, Inc. (1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 112, 136.)
To the extent that Honda is still objecting based on
privacy, proprietary information or trade secret, the Court notes that parties
have entered a protective order. (12/4/23 Protective Order.) The privacy
objection is overruled.
To the extent that Honda is still objecting to the PMQ
deposition on basis of attorney-client privilege, work product privilege,
vagueness or ambiguity, these objections are not supported. (Obregon v. Superior Court (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 424, 431; West Pico
Furniture Co. of L.A. (1961) 56 Cal.2d 407, 417.)
In its opposition, Honda urges that the only issue
remaining is when the deposition will occur. Honda is not pursuing its
substantive objections any longer.  
The motion to compel the PMQ deposition is granted.
The Court concludes that Honda failed to produce its PMQ without serving any
valid objection to the deposition notice.[1]
C.
Sanctions
Plaintiff seeks sanctions of $1,830.00 against
Honda for necessitating this motion. Plaintiff’s counsel, Angelica Zamudio, declares
that she spent 3 hours preparing the motion and anticipates spending 2 hours
answering opposition and 1 hour preparing for the hearing. She also spent
$60.00 on the filing fee. Her hourly rate is $295. (Zamudio Decl. ¶¶ 11-12.)
The Court finds that sanctions are not warranted, as
the imposition of sanctions would be unjust. Honda provides an explanation of
the deposition delay. Honda’s counsel declares that Plaintiff’s counsel filed
more than 170 cases against Honda in 2022, that Plaintiff’s counsel has filed over
120 cases against it in 2023 and is seeking PMQ depositions in several of the
cases. (See Henderson Decl. ¶ 10.) Honda urges that it has offered several
dates for PMQ depositions, which it asserts Plaintiff’s counsel opted to use in
other cases. (See Henderson Decl. ¶¶ 10,11.)
 
IV.     CONCLUSION AND ORDER
           The motion by Plaintiff Meraz for an
order compelling the deposition of Honda’s person most qualified is granted.
Defendant’s PMQ is ordered to appear for deposition within 30 days.
Plaintiff’s request for sanctions is denied.
Counsel for Plaintiff is ordered to provide notice
of this ruling.
