And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

This is a tentative ruling in a contractual dispute action between E1011 Labs LLC (E1011) and Salvatore Di Benedetto. E1011 alleges that its former employees, Kevin Wang and Daniel Hwang, are in violation of their Confidential Information and Inventions Agreements for allegedly scheming with Di Benedetto to develop a competing product without E1011. Di Benedetto filed a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, arguing that he resides in Illinois and plaintiff is a Delaware corporation. However, Di Benedetto has already made a general appearance in the case, which means he has consented to the jurisdiction of this court. Therefore, the motion to dismiss is DENIED.
