             The Court grants the Motion to
Compel Further Responses as to the Request for Production, Set One, the Form

BACKGROUND
 
            On
July 24, 2020, Plaintiff Morris J Rivers filed the Complaint against Inglewood Crossroads Homeowners
Association, Crossroads Properties, and HOA Premier Management, LLC, alleging
causes of action for negligence and premises liability.
 
            On October 11, 2024, Defendant
served Plaintiff with the Request for Production, Set One, Form
Interrogatories, Set One, and Special Interrogatories, Set One.
 
            On December 13, 2022, Plaintiff
requested an extension due to an illness, which both parties agreed to.
            
On
January 16, 2023, Plaintiff provided objections to all three discovery
requests.
 
            On February 14, 2023, Defendant provided
a meet and confer correspondence relating to Plaintiff’s responses. Defendant
requested Plaintiff’s agreed responses on or before February 28, 2023.
 
            Plaintiff has failed to provide
further responses to the Request for Production, Set One, Form Interrogatories,
Set One, and Special Interrogatories, Set One.
 
            On October 17, 2024, Defendant filed
the instant Motions to Compel Further Discovery to the Request for Production,
Set One, and Form Interrogatories, Set One.
 
            Plaintiff has not filed an
opposition.
 
LEGAL STANDARD
            
A party must respond to interrogatories and
requests for production of documents within 30 days after service.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260, subd.
(a).)  If a party to whom interrogatories are directed does not provide
timely responses, the requesting party may move for an order compelling
responses to the discovery.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (b); Code
Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (c).)  The party also waives the right to
make any objections, including one based on privilege or work-product
protection.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.300, subd. (a).)  There is no time limit for a motion to compel
responses to interrogatories or the production of documents other than the
cut-off on hearing discovery motions 15 days before trial.  (Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 2024.020, subd. (a), 2030.290; Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300.)  
 
“The court shall impose a monetary sanction …
against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a
motion to compel a further response … unless it finds that the one subject to
the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances
make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.290
(d). )
 
            The propounding party
may file motions to compel further responses to requests for production if it
believes the responses received are (1) evasive, (2) incomplete, or (3) if the
objections raised are meritless or overly general. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310,
subd. (a).) In response to a motion to compel further responses, the respondent
bears the burden of justifying any objections. (Fairmont Ins. Co. v.
Superior Court (2000) 22 Cal.4th 245, 255.)
 
DISCUSSION 
 
Defendant requests that
the Court compel Plaintiff to provide verified responses to the Request for
Production, Set One, compel Plaintiff to provide verified further
responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, and compel Plaintiff to provide
verified further responses to the Special Interrogatories, Set One, 
 
Meet and Confer
 
A motion to compel
must be “accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2025.450.)
 
Here, Defendant has made multiple attempts to
meet and confer with Plaintiff, including a letter sent on August 27, 2024.
(Hall Decl. ¶ 6-10.) Therefore, the Court finds that Defendant satisfied the
meet and confer requirement.
 
Requests for Production
 
Defendant requests that
the Court compel Plaintiff to provide verified responses to the Request for
Production, Set One.
 
Defendant argues
that Plaintiff's responses to the Request for Production of Documents, Set One,
are unverified and, therefore, effectively constitute no response. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2031.250 subd. (a);
see Appleton v. Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 632,636.)
Plaintiff’s responses to requests Nos. 1 through 24 include identical
boilerplate objections and a generic statement that the documents are equally
available to Defendant, with no verification. 
 
Defendant has made
multiple attempts to meet and confer with Plaintiff, who requested extensions
due to illness but has yet to provide substantive responses. Defendant argues
that compelling, verified responses is essential to adequately prepare a
defense and fulfill the discovery obligations required for a fair trial.
 
Plaintiff has
failed to file an opposition. 
 
Defendant has shown
that Plaintiff has not complied with Code Civ. Proc., Section 2031.250 subdivision (a) by failing to provide
verified responses to the Request for Production Set One. Furthermore, in
response to a motion to compel further responses, the respondent bears the
burden of justifying any objections. (Fairmont Ins. Co., supra, 22
Cal.4th 245, 255.) Plaintiff has failed to oppose this motion and, thus,
has not justified his objections.
 
Therefore, the Court waives Plaintiff’s
objections and grants the Motion to Compel further verified responses to
Defendant’s Request for Production, Set One.
 
Form
Interrogatories
 
Defendant requests
the Court compel Plaintiff to provide verified further responses to Form
Interrogatories, Set One.
 
Defendant argues
that Plaintiff’s responses to Form Interrogatories are incomplete, evasive, and
nonresponsive.  Defendant contends
Plaintiff’s responses fall short, as they consist only of boilerplate
objections without substantive answers. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300 subd. (a).)
 
Defendant further
notes that Plaintiff agreed to provide substantive responses before the October
15, 2024, mediation, yet has not done so. Consequently, Defendant requests the
Court compel Plaintiff to provide verified, complete responses without objections
to allow Defendant to prepare a proper defense.
 
No opposition has
been filed.
 
In response to a motion to compel further
responses, the respondent bears the burden of justifying any objections. (Fairmont
Ins. Co., supra, 22 Cal.4th 245, 255.) Plaintiff has not filed any
opposition or justified any objections. Thus, Defendant has shown that
Plaintiff’s responses are evasive and incomplete. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300 subd. (a).)
 
Therefore, the
Court waives Plaintiff’s objections and grants Defendant’s Motion to Compel
Further Discovery as to Form Interrogatories, Set One.
 
Special
Interrogatories
 
Defendant requests
the Court compel Plaintiff to provide verified further responses to Defendant’s
Special Interrogatories, Set One.
 
Defendant argues
that Plaintiff’s responses to Special Interrogatories are incomplete, evasive,
and nonresponsive. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300 subd. (a).). Defendant contends that
Plaintiff's responses are inadequate, consisting solely of boilerplate
objections without substantive answers.
 
For example, in
Special Interrogatory No. 4, which asks Plaintiff to describe how the incident
occurred, Plaintiff responded with objections instead of an answer, labeling
the request as irrelevant, overly broad, and burdensome. This same objection
was repeated across all 45 interrogatories.
 
Defendant argues
that these objections hinder Defendant’s ability to understand Plaintiff’s
claims and prepare for trial. Since Plaintiff had agreed to provide responses
before an October 15, 2024, mediation but failed to do so, Defendant requests
that the Court compel Plaintiff to provide complete, verified responses without
objections.
 
No opposition has
been filed.
 
In response to a motion to compel further
responses, the respondent bears the burden of justifying any objections. (Fairmont
Ins. Co., supra, 22 Cal.4th 245, 255.) Plaintiff has not filed any
opposition or justified any objections. Thus, Defendant has shown that
Plaintiff’s responses are evasive and incomplete. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300 subd. (a).)
 
Therefore, the
Court waives Plaintiff’s objections and grants Defendant’s Motion to Compel
Further Discovery as to Special Interrogatories, Set One.
 
Sanctions
 
Failing
to respond to an authorized method of discovery is a sanctionable misuse of the
discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.030 subd. (a), 2023.010 subd. (d).)
If a motion to compel a party to respond to discovery is successful, the court
must impose a monetary sanction against that party unless the sanction
would be unjust. (Code Civ. Proc § 2030.290 subd. (c), 2023.030 subd. (a), 2023.010
subd. (d); Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 404.) The monetary sanction
includes the moving party’s reasonable expenses, such as attorney’s fees and
costs. (Code Civ. Proc § 2023.030 subd. (a).)
 
Defendant requests
the Court impose sanctions totaling $985 regarding the Request for Production,
Set One, $985 regarding the Form Interrogatories, Set One, and $985 regarding
the Special Interrogatories, Set One. For the Request for Production, Defendant’s
Counsel states they spent 2.5 hours on the motion, 2 hours on analyzing the
opposition and writing the reply, and .5 hours attending the hearing at $185 an
hour plus a $60 filing fee. (Hall Decl. ¶ 12.) The requested sanctions for
the Form Interrogatories, Set One, and Special Interrogatories, Set One are
calculated in exactly the same manner as the Request for Production, Set One.
The Court strikes the 2 hours for the opposition and replies for all motions
given the lack of opposition. Thus, the Court finds that Defendant is entitled
to sanctions equaling 7.5 hours for writing the motions and .5 hours for
attending the hearing at $185 an hour plus $180 in filing fees, totaling $1,660.
 
Therefore, the
Court imposes sanctions on Plaintiff in the amount of $1,660.
