And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling sustaining the demurrer (a motion to dismiss) filed by the defendants against the plaintiff's fifth amended complaint. The plaintiff, Fadriko Dillon, alleged that the defendants, Prime Healthcare Centinela, LLC, dba Centinela Hospital Medical Center, Prime Healthcare Services, LLC, and Veritas Health Services, Inc., were negligent in failing to prevent a gunshot wound incident that occurred outside the hospital.

The judge found that the plaintiff's claims for premises liability and general negligence failed to state a cause of action because they did not plead facts that showed the defendants owed a legal duty to protect the plaintiff from the criminal acts of a third party. The judge also found that the plaintiff's allegations were too vague and did not provide sufficient detail to establish a recognized legal duty.

The judge noted that the plaintiff had previously filed multiple amended complaints, but they still lacked sufficient allegations to state a claim. As a result, the judge sustained the demurrer without leave to amend, meaning that the plaintiff will not be allowed to revise the complaint to address the deficiencies identified by the judge.
