And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Defendant Canoo Inc. The Court finds that the parties in the instant case and the parties in the Lewis Case are identical because both cases involve PAGA claims, and thus are brought on behalf of the State of California against Defendant. The Court also finds that the causes of action are identical because both cases allege the same harm based on Defendant's failure to follow California labor law.

The Court grants the Plea in Abatement and stays the action pending disposition of the Lewis Case. This means that all further proceedings in the instant case will be suspended until the Lewis Case is resolved. The Court also denies the Defendant's request to stay the instant case under the doctrine of exclusive concurrent jurisdiction, which would have given priority to the first court to assume jurisdiction.

The Court finds that the instant case is redundant and that the Lewis Case already represents all allegedly aggrieved employees, including those in the instant case. The Court's ruling is based on the principles of PAGA, which allows for separate actions by different employees against the same employer, and the doctrine of primary right theory, which holds that every judicial action must involve the invasion of a primary right.
