```

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling discusses the doctrine of judicial estoppel, which prevents a party from gaining an advantage by taking one position and then seeking a second advantage by taking an inconsistent position. The doctrine aims to maintain the integrity of the judicial system and protect parties from unfair strategies. The doctrine applies when a party takes two inconsistent positions in judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings, is successful in asserting the first position, and the positions are not taken due to ignorance, fraud, or mistake. The ruling cites People v. Castillo (2010) 49 Cal.4th 145 as an example of the doctrine in action.
