ANALYSIS
Motions To Compel
Responses To Form Interrogatories
            Plaintiff
moves to compel responses to form interrogatories and requests the imposition
of sanctions.
When a party to whom
interrogatories are directed fails to respond, under Civ. Proc. Code, §
2030.290(b) a party propounding the interrogatories may move for an order
compelling a response. A party who fails to provide a timely response waives
any objection, including one based on privilege or work product. (Civ. Proc.
Code, § 2030.290(a).) For a motion to compel initial responses, no meet
and confer is required. All that needs to be shown is that a set of
interrogatories was properly served on the opposing party, that the time to
respond has expired, and that no response of any kind has been served. (Leach v. Sup. Ct. (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d
902, 905-06.) 
 
On May 3, 2024, Defendant served
unverified[1]
responses to form interrogatories, with objections. Responses were due on April
30, 2024. Due to the untimely response, Defenant has waived all objections. Civ.
Proc. Code, § 2030.290(a).) If Defendant seeks relief from waiver of
objections, Defendant must bring a properly-notice motion in that regard. 
 
As such, the motion to compel
responses to form interrogatories is MOOT by virtue of verified responses
having been served before the hearing on this motion. If Plaintiff seeks
further responses, Plaintiff may bring an appropriate motion.
 
The court may award sanctions under the
Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even
though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was
withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after
the motion was filed.

(Cal. Rules Court, Rule 3.1348(a).)
 
Plaintiff’s request for sanctions
against Defendant and Defendant’s attorneys of record, jointly and severally,
is GRANTED in the reduced amount of $810 (2 hours at $350, plus $60 filing
fee—Declaration of Sena Hori, ¶ 4.) Sanctions are to be paid to Plaintiff’s
counsel within 30 days.
