 “ ‘ “Judicial estoppel
precludes a party from gaining an advantage by taking one position, and then
seeking a second advantage by taking an incompatible position. [Citations.] The
doctrine's dual goals are to maintain the integrity of the judicial system and
to protect parties  from opponents' unfair strategies. [Citation.]
Application of the doctrine is discretionary.” ’ [Citation.] The doctrine
applies when ‘(1) the same party has taken two positions; (2) the positions
were taken in judicial or quasi-judicial administrative proceedings; (3) the
party was successful in asserting the first position (i.e., the tribunal
adopted the position or accepted it as true); (4) the two positions are totally
inconsistent; and (5) the first position was not taken as a result of
ignorance, fraud, or mistake.’ [Citations.]” (Citations omitted.)
