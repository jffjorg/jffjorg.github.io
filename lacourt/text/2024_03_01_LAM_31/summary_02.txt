And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by the defendants, CBRE Group, et al. The plaintiff, California Spine and Neurosurgery Institute, alleges that the defendants made misrepresentations about the payment rate for medical services provided to a patient. The defendants failed to pay for the services, and the plaintiff is seeking damages.

The judge has sustained the demurrer, meaning that the plaintiff's complaint does not adequately state a cause of action. The judge has granted leave to amend the complaint, giving the plaintiff 30 days to file a revised complaint.

The judge's ruling is based on the plaintiff's failure to plead the necessary elements of fraud, including misrepresentation, knowledge of falsity, intent to defraud, justifiable reliance, and resulting damage. The judge also notes that the plaintiff's complaint does not allege that the defendants authorized the neurospine procedure or represented that the services were covered.
