CASE:                         Maria Hernandez v. Kia America, Inc.
 
CASE NO.:                      22STCV09188
 





















 
MOTION
TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TO DISCOVERY 



 
MOVING PARTY:               Plaintiff
Maria Hernandez
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     Defendant Kia
America, Inc.
 
 
This is a Song-Beverly action.  On December 29, 2023, Plaintiff, Maria Hernandez,
filed this motion to compel Defendant, Kia America, Inc., to provide further
responses to Plaintiff’s Request for Production of Documents, Set Two, Nos. 49 and
51.  The motion was scheduled for
February 1, 2024.  
 
On February 1, 2024, the court continued the hearing on its
own motion because the parties had not participated in an Informal Discovery
Conference (IDC) prior to the hearing. 
Plaintiff filed the motion to preserve her right to have the motion
heard.  Accordingly, the court continued
the hearing to March 1, 2024 to allow the parties to participate in an IDC.  
 
The parties have not yet participated in an IDC.  There is no indication if a discovery dispute
still exists or whether Plaintiff intends to pursue this motion.  Given this background, the court is inclined
to deny the motion without prejudice. 
The court will hear from the parties. 
 
Clerk of the Court to give notice.
