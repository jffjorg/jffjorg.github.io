And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has decided to disregard the defendant's supplemental briefing on the plaintiff's third cause of action for false promises, as the parties were not granted leave to address this claim. The judge also notes that the defendant mischaracterized two cases in their argument about part performance requiring exclusive possession. Additionally, the judge finds that the defendant's argument ignores the well-settled rules of liberal construction of pleadings in favor of the non-demurring party.

The judge has ruled that part performance does not require exclusive possession, and therefore does not address the plaintiff's equitable arguments. The judge also notes that the plaintiff's request for judicial notice of an alleged ongoing contractual relationship between the parties is not in proper form and is not relevant to the court's ruling.

The judge mentions that a life estate is an estate whose duration is limited to the life of the person holding it or of some other person, citing Peterson v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.
