And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion to quash service of summons filed by defendant Francisco Salas-Corona. The defendant argued that the service was defective and that the court lacked personal jurisdiction over him. The court found that the plaintiff failed to show that notice of service was sent to the defendant by registered mail as required by Vehicle Code section 17455. As a result, the court granted the motion to quash service of summons. The defendant is required to provide notice and file a proof of service of the quashment.
