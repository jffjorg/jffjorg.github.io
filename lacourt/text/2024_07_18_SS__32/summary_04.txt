Summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the City of Los Angeles' (Defendant) motion to continue trial in the case. The Defendant requests to continue trial to at least 30 days after the September 24, 2024 summary judgment hearing. The Defendant timely served its motion for summary judgment on May 29, 2024, and since the summary judgment hearing could not be reserved until September 24, 2024, which is after trial, the Defendant requests that the Court continue the trial date to allow for the motion for summary judgment to be heard. The Judge finds good cause to continue trial and grants the motion. The trial is continued to October 31, 2024, and all discovery and pre-trial motion cut-off dates shall be in accordance with the new trial date.
