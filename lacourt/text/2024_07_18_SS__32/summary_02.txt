And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to continue trial and all related dates filed by Cross-Defendant Berry Bowl Los Angeles, LLC. The motion was unopposed. The trial was initially set for February 5, 2024, but was continued to August 5, 2024, and then to January 30, 2025. Cross-Defendant seeks to continue the trial to May 22, 2025, citing the need for more time to conduct discovery. However, the judge did not find sufficient justification for the lengthy continuance and granted the motion in part. The trial will be continued to January 30, 2025, and the Final Status Conference will be continued to January 16, 2025. All discovery and motion deadlines will be associated with the new trial date.
