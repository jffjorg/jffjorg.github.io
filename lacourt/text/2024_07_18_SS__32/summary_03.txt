Summary in English:

The Judge has denied the motion for leave to file a first amended complaint by the Plaintiff, Bernard Nellom. The motion was filed on May 29, 2024, and sought to add a new plaintiff, Doris Sturgis, and assert new causes of action, including breach of the implied warranty of habitability, nuisance, and breach of contract. The Judge found that the proposed amendments were not timely and proper, and that they would prejudice the opposing party. The Judge also found that the proposed amendments were not necessary and proper, and that the Plaintiff failed to demonstrate that the new causes of action arose from the same operative facts as the original complaint. The Judge noted that the trial is set for January 2025, and that the discovery at issue relates to new claims and punitive damages.
