And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has denied the plaintiff's motion for leave to file a first amended complaint, which seeks to add new allegations related to the defendants' use and improvement of an adjacent property. The court has expressed concern about the timeliness of the motion, as the plaintiff did not inform the court of the possible amendment when it granted the plaintiff's ex parte motion to continue the trial date. The court has also stated that further discovery may be necessary, which would require a further continuance of the trial date. The court has denied the motion without reaching the issue of whether the new allegations are time-barred by the statute of limitations.
