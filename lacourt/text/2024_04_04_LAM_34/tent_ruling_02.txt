ANALYSIS:
 
I.         
Legal Standard
 
“The party
against whom a complaint or cross-complaint has been filed may object, by
demurrer or answer as provided in Section 430.30, to the pleading on any one or
more of” various grounds listed in statute. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10.)
 
“When any ground
for objection to a complaint, cross-complaint, or answer appears on the face
thereof, or from any matter of which the court is required to or may take
judicial notice, the objection on that ground may be taken by a demurrer to the
pleading.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.30, subd. (a).)
 
“A demurrer to a
complaint or cross-complaint may be taken to the whole complaint or
cross-complaint or to any of the causes of action stated therein.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 430.50, subd. (a).)
 
“In reviewing the sufficiency
of a complaint against a general demurrer, we are guided by long-settled rules.
We treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded, but not
contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law. We also consider matters which may be judicially
noticed. Further, we give the complaint a reasonable interpretation,
reading it as a whole and its parts in their context.” (Blank v. Kirwan (1985)
39 Cal.3d 311, 318, citations and internal quotation marks omitted.)
 
II.      
Discussion
 
Rudy Malka demurs to the entire Fourth
Amended Cross-Complaint, arguing that there has not been a sufficient pleading
of alter ego liability. (Demurrer, pp. 4:2, 6:1–2.)
 
        The Court disagrees with this argument. 
 
        Among other things, Gloria Shulman Hughes and John E. Hughes, Jr.
allege that Rudy Malka is an alter ego of Living The Dream, LTD RE, and New
Horizon. (Fourth Amended Cross-Complaint, ¶¶ 11–13.)
 
These allegations sufficiently and certainly plead the alter ego theory
as it regards Rudy Malka. The moving party can obtain further details on the
alter ego allegations through discovery.
 
III.    
Conclusion

 
The Demurrer to the Fourth Amended Cross-Complaint is
OVERRULED.
