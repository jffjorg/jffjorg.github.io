Here is a summary in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion for summary judgment and/or summary adjudication. The defendant, Avida LLC, had argued that the plaintiff, Robert Manquero, had failed to establish that the defendant breached any duty owed, caused the plaintiff's damages, or was a substantial factor in the plaintiff's damages. The plaintiff disagreed, arguing that the defendant had made false representations, was strictly liable, and was liable for breach of warranty, fraud, and violations of business and professions code sections 17200 and 17500.

The judge found that there were multiple triable issues of material fact in the case, including whether the defendant's advertising was accurate and truthful, whether the defendant's product was an actual cause of the plaintiff's failed drug tests, whether the defendant's product was a proximate cause of the plaintiff's failed drug tests, whether the plaintiff suffered separate damages by acts of the defendant from those damages caused by the plaintiff's employer, and whether the amount of damages the plaintiff suffered was larger than the amount paid to him by his employer. The judge concluded that summary judgment and summary adjudication were not appropriate and denied the defendant's motion.
