        Many
of the objections filed by Plaintiff are frivolous.  Plaintiff objects to the statement by
Defendant’s expert that “I have been engaged by Defendant, Avida LLC to provide
expert evidence” on the grounds of hearsay. 
(See Objections, Objection No. 1.)  Similarly, Plaintiff objects to the statement
by Defendant’s Chief Operating Officer that “Avida LLC is a Nevada corporation
and sole owner of the brand Avida CBD.” 
(Objections, Objection No. 10.)  The two lawyers who submitted these objections
have collectively over 70 years of experience as California attorneys. “This
is hardly good advocacy, and it unnecessarily overburdens the trial court.” (Nazir
v. United Airlines, Inc. (2009)
178 Cal.App.4th 243, 254, fn. 3.) 

 
        Plaintiff
also objected to Defendant’s Reply, and Defendant filed a Response to these objections.  Although Defendant’s Reply exceeds the
allowable length and Defendant did not receive prior leave to surpass the
length limit, the Court exercises its discretion to consider the Reply in its
entirety. 
 
 
II.      
Legal Standard
 
“A party may
move for summary judgment in an action or proceeding if it is contended that
the action has no merit or that there is no defense to the action or
proceeding. The motion may be made at any time after 60 days have elapsed since
the general appearance in the action or proceeding of each party against whom
the motion is directed or at any earlier time after the general appearance that
the court, with or without notice and upon good cause shown, may direct.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (1)(a).)
 
“[T]he party moving for summary judgment bears the burden of persuasion
that there is no triable issue of fact and that he is entitled to judgment as a
matter of law. That is because of the general principle that a party who seeks
a court’s action in his favor bears the burden of persuasion thereon. There is
a triable issue of material fact if, and only if, the evidence would allow a
reasonable trier of fact to find the underlying fact in favor of the party
opposing the motion in accordance with the applicable standard of proof.” (Aguilar
v. Atl. Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 850, citation omitted.) 
 
“[T]he party moving for summary judgment bears an initial burden of
production to make a prima facie showing of the nonexistence of any triable
issue of material fact; if he carries his burden of production, he causes a
shift, and the opposing party is then subjected to a burden of production of
his own to make a prima facie showing of the existence of a triable issue of
material fact.” (Aguilar, supra, at p. 850; Smith v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2005) 135
Cal.App.4th 1463, 1474, [applying the summary judgment standards in Aguilar
to motions for summary adjudication].) 
 
“On a summary judgment motion, the court must therefore consider what
inferences favoring the opposing party a factfinder could reasonably draw from
the evidence. While viewing the evidence in this manner, the court must bear in
mind that its primary function is to identify issues rather than to determine
issues. Only when the inferences are indisputable may the court decide the
issues as a matter of law. If the evidence is in conflict, the factual issues
must be resolved by trial.” (Binder v. Aetna Life Ins. Co. (1999) 75
Cal.App.4th 832, 839, citation omitted.) 
 
“The trial court may not weigh the evidence in the manner of a fact
finder to determine whose version is more likely true. Nor may the trial court
grant summary judgment based on the court's evaluation of credibility.” (Binder,
supra, at p. 840, citations omitted; see also Weiss v. People ex rel.
Dep’t of Transp. (2020) 9 Cal.5th 840, 864 [“Courts deciding motions for
summary judgment or summary adjudication may not weigh the evidence but must
instead view it in the light most favorable to the opposing party and draw all
reasonable inferences in favor of that party”].) 
 
“On a motion for summary adjudication, the trial court has no
discretion to exercise. If a triable issue of material fact exists as to the
challenged causes of action, the motion must be denied. If there is no triable
issue of fact, the motion must be granted.” (Fisherman's Wharf Bay Cruise
Corp. v. Super. Ct. (2003) 114 Cal.App.4th 309, 320, citation omitted.) 
 
III.     Discussion
 
A.      The
Parties’ Arguments
 
Defendant moves the Court to grant
summary judgment, or in the alternative summary adjudication, in its favor.
(MSJ, p. 31:7–8.)
 
Defendant argues: (1) that Plaintiff
cannot establish that Defendant breached any duty owed because Defendant’s
advertising was accurate and truthful; (2) that Plaintiff cannot establish that
Defendant caused his damages because the evidence shows that other parties were
the cause; (3) that Plaintiff has already successfully argued that his damages
were caused by his employer’s wrongful termination; (4) that even if the
employer was not the sole cause of damages, Plaintiff cannot prove that
Defendant’s conduct was a substantial factor cause for his damages because it
was neither a necessary nor sufficient cause of the failed drug test; (5) that
Plaintiff cannot recover damages from Defendant because he already received an
arbitration award ordering his employer to pay his damages; (6) that Plaintiff
cannot prevail on any of his causes of action; and (7) that Plaintiff cannot
prevail because Defendant is entitled to certain affirmative defenses. (MSJ,
pp. 16:15–16, 17:16–17, 18:8–9, 19:8–11, 20:22–23, 21:17, 28:5–6.)
 
Plaintiff disagrees, arguing: (1) that
Defendant knowingly made false representations and the MSJ should be denied;
(2) that Defendant is strictly liable; (3) that Defendants are liable for
breach of warranty; (4) that Defendants are liable for fraud; (5) that
Defendants are liable for violation of Business and Professions Code sections
17200 and 17500; and (6) that Plaintiff’s receipt of monies from the
arbitration does not entitle Defendant to summary judgment. (Opposition, pp.
12:11–12, 14:16, 18:26, 19:20, 20:21, 21:23, 22:26–27.)
 
Defendant reiterates its arguments in its
Reply. 
 
B.      Discussion
 
There appear to be multiple triable
issues of material fact in this matter, including but not limited to:
 
(1)      
whether Defendant’s advertising
was accurate and truthful.  This is
brought into question by Plaintiff’s declaration that he had not previously
tested positive on any drug test prior to using Defendant’s product but that he
did test positive on two drug tests after using Plaintiff’s product (Decl. Berman,
Exh. 5, Decl. Manquero, ¶¶ 3–5 [actual pages 148–149 of 168] and Exh. 6,
Decl. Scott, ¶ 4 [actual pages 155–156 of 168] and Exh. 6.2, KorvaLabs Test
Results [actual page 162 of 168]); 
 
(2)      
whether Defendant’s product was
an actual cause of Plaintiff’s failed drug tests (ibid.);
 
(3)      
whether Defendant’s product was a
proximate cause of Plaintiff’s failed drug tests (ibid.);
 
(4)      
whether Plaintiff suffered
separate damages by acts of Defendant from those damages to Plaintiff allegedly
caused by Plaintiff’s employer (Decl. Berman, Exh. 5, Decl. Manquero, ¶ 8
[actual pages 150–151 of 168]); and
 
(5)      
whether the amount of damages
Plaintiff suffered is larger than the amount paid to him by his employer (ibid.).
 
While there are other remaining issues —
some specific to individual causes of action and others pertaining to the
Complaint as a whole — those issues (including the applicability of certain
affirmative defenses) also involve triable issues of material fact. 
 
Thus, summary judgment and summary adjudication
are not appropriate. 
 
IV.     
Conclusion
 
The Motion for Summary Judgment and/or Summary Adjudication is
DENIED.
