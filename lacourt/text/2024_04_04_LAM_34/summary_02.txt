The Judge disagreed with this argument and found that the allegations in the Fourth Amended Cross-Complaint sufficiently plead alter ego liability regarding Rudy Malka. The Judge struck paragraph 168 and prayer 4 of the tenth cause of action from the Fourth Amended Cross-Complaint, but otherwise overruled the Demurrer.
