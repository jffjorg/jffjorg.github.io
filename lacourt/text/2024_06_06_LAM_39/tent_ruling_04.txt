OPPOSING PARTY


Defendant FCA US LLC



 
Plaintiff Deron
Smith (“Plaintiff”) moves to compel further responses from Defendant FCA US LLC
(“Defendant”) to Request for Production of Documents, set one (“RPD”).  Defendant represents that it will produce all
responsive documents.  (Declaration of
Michael J. Gregg, ¶ ¶ 11-13; Ehx. F, Supplemental Responses to RPDs 19, 20.)  This representation binds Defendant.  
The court notes
the supplemental responses Defendant provides in Exhibit F, attached to the
Gregg declaration, concerning RPDs 16, 17, 18, and 21 are code compliant in that
Defendant states it has conducted a diligent search and reasonable inquiry and
no documents responsive to those RPDs have ever existed.  To the extent Plaintiff determines otherwise
at some point, the court trusts Plaintiff will have this court revisit the
issue.  Therefore, with the understanding
Defendant has committed to producing responsive documents and is obligated to
do so, the court places Plaintiff’s motion off calendar as moot at this time. 
Plaintiff is
ordered to give notice of this order and file proof of service of same.
