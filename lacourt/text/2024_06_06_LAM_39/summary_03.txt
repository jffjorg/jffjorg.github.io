And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling is based on the information presented in the case. The plaintiff, Tanisha Johnson, sued General Motors, Inc. for fraud and defective vehicle. The defendant demurred to the fifth cause of action and moved to strike the prayer for punitive damages. The court ruled that the demurrer to the fifth cause of action for fraud was sustained without leave to amend. The court also granted the motion to strike the prayer for punitive damages. The court noted that the plaintiff did not allege specific facts to support the generalities of fraud and that the statute of limitations bars the plaintiff's claim for fraud. The court also noted that the plaintiff may recover civil penalties, not punitive damages, for violations of the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act. The court denied the plaintiff's request for leave to amend, stating that it would be futile.
