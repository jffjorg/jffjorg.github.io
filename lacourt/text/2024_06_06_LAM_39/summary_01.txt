Here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling of the court addresses a motion for summary judgment filed by Defendant Joseph Daneshrad, who represented Plaintiff D and M General Constructor, Inc. in an underlying case. The court finds that the motion is procedurally defective and denies it. The court also orders Defendant to give notice of the court's order and to file proof of service of same.

The court's analysis shows that to prevail on the claim for attorney malpractice, Plaintiff must show that Defendant had a duty to use the skill, prudence, and diligence that other attorneys commonly possess and exercise; Defendant breached that duty; and Defendant's breach of the duty caused damages to Plaintiff. Defendant contends that Plaintiff cannot show that Defendant's breach of duty caused Plaintiff to sustain damages. Plaintiff must advance evidence to show that a greater settlement was lost.

The court finds that Defendant presents evidence that Plaintiff agreed to a settlement one week after substituting in new counsel to replace Defendant in the underlying action. The court shifts the burden to Plaintiff to provide evidence demonstrating Defendant's conduct caused Plaintiff to lose the opportunity to settle for a greater sum.
