  Barstow Outlet, LLC




OPPOSING PARTY


(none)



 
BACKGROUND
 
This action stems from a commercial landlord-tenant dispute.  Plaintiff Merchants Barstow LLC (“Plaintiff”)
leases 24 buildings from Defendant Barstow Outlet, LLC (“Defendant”), each of
which Plaintiff subleases to separate cannabis businesses.  (SAC ¶ 1.) 
Plaintiff alleges that Defendant misrepresented that these buildings
each had 800 AMPS of power capacity, which cannabis businesses require, when
they only had 400 AMPS of capacity, which is insufficient to run a cannabis
business.  (SAC ¶¶ 2-14.)  
 
Defendant moves to compel third party Winners Circle HD, LLC (“Winners
Circle”), one of Defendant’s subtenants, to comply with the subpoena served
upon it on November 1, 2023, with a production date of November 27, 2023.  Defendant also seeks monetary sanctions.  The motion is unopposed.
 
ANALYSIS
 
Motion to Compel
 
“In California, discovery may
be obtained from a nonparty through an oral deposition, a written deposition,
or a deposition for the production of business records and things. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2020.010, subd. (a).)” (Board of Registered Nursing v. Superior
Court of Orange County (2021) 59 Cal.App.5th 1011, 1030 (“Board of
Registered Nursing”).) “To pursue the deposition of a nonparty, a party must
generally serve a deposition subpoena.” (Ibid.).)
 
“‘A deposition subpoena that
commands only the production of business records for copying shall designate
the business records to be produced either by specifically describing each
individual item or by reasonably particularizing each category of item, and
shall specify the form in which any electronically stored information is to be
produced, if a particular form is desired.’ [Citation.]” (Board of Registered
Nursing, supra, 59 Cal.App.5th at p. 1030.)
 
“‘If a deponent fails to
answer any question or to produce any document, electronically stored
information, or tangible thing under the deponent’s control that is specified
in the deposition notice or a deposition subpoena, the party seeking discovery
may move the court for an order compelling that answer or production.’ (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2025.480, subd. (a).)” (Board of Registered Nursing, supra,
59 Cal.App.5th at p. 1031.) “‘[D]iscovery conducted by
way of a business records subpoena is a
“deposition.”’ [Citation.]” (Id. at pp. 1031-1032.) “If a subpoena
requires the attendance of a witness or the production of books, documents,
electronically stored information, or other things before a court, or at the
trial of an issue therein, or at the taking of a deposition, the court, upon
motion reasonably made by [a party or a witness] . . . may make an order . . .
directing compliance with it upon those terms or conditions as the court shall
declare, including protective orders.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1987.1.)
 
            On
November 1, 2023, Defendant personally served Winners Circle with a deposition
subpoena to produce various documents pertaining to the property, with a
production date of November 27, 2023, 2023. 
(Ex. 1 to Sprague Decl.)  As of
the January 25, 2024 filing date of the motion, Desert Bloom had not produced
any documents, served objections, moved to quash, moved for a protective order,
or otherwise substantively responded to the subpoena.  (Sprague Decl. ¶ 6; Engquist Decl. ¶¶ 2-6 and
Exs. A-B.)  Accordingly, the Court finds
that Winners Circle has failed to comply with the subpoena.
 
 
Sanctions
 
            Defendant
seeks monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,000 pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 2023.050 and an additional $3,055 for reasonable attorneys’
fees and costs incurred in bringing the instant motion.            
 
            Section
2023.050 provides that “in addition to any other sanctions imposed pursuant to
this chapter, the court shall impose a one-thousand dollar ($1,000) sanction if
the production is made within seven days before the hearing on a motion to
compel brought pursuant to section 2025.480. 

 
            Here,
because no production occurred prior to seven days before the hearing, the
Court imposes the mandatory $1,000 sanction.
 
            Defendant
also seeks its reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs incurred in bringing the motion,
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1987.2, which provides that “the
court may in its discretion award the amount of the expenses incurred in making
or opposing the motion, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, if the court
finds the motion was made or opposed in bad faith or without substantial
justification[…]”  
 
            Here,
Winners Circle did not oppose the motion. 
As such, the Court cannot make a finding that the motion was opposed in
bad faith or without substantial justification. 
Therefore, the Court declines to award additional sanctions.
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
Therefore, the Court grants Defendant’s motion to compel Winners
Circle’s compliance with the deposition subpoena within 30 days of notice of
the Court’s order.  
 
The Court further awards
mandatory monetary sanctions against Winners Circle, payable to Defendant, by
and through Defendant’s counsel, in the amount of $1,000, pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure section 2023.050 within 30 days of notice of the Court’s order.
 
Defendant shall provide notice of the Court’s order and file a proof
of service of such.
