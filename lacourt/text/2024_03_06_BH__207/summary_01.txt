And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the defendant, Barstow Outlet, LLC, in its motion to compel compliance with two deposition subpoenas served on Winners Circle HD, LLC and Desert Bloom Holdings, LLC. The subpoenas were served on November 1, 2023, and November 26, 2023, respectively, with production dates of November 27, 2023. The court finds that both Winners Circle and Desert Bloom failed to comply with the subpoenas by not producing any documents or responding to the subpoenas.

The court grants the motion to compel and orders both Winners Circle and Desert Bloom to comply with the deposition subpoenas within 30 days of notice of the court's order. The court also awards mandatory monetary sanctions against both Winners Circle and Desert Bloom in the amount of $1,000 each, payable to the defendant, per California Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.050.

The court declines to award additional sanctions against Desert Bloom because it did not oppose the motion. The court notes that the defendant is responsible for providing notice of the court's order and filing a proof of service of such.
