And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court grants the plaintiff's motion to compel a further deposition by the defendant's person most qualified, Tammy Alameda. The defendant must produce Tammy Alameda for further deposition, and ensure she is better prepared by consulting with current and former employees and reviewing relevant employee handbooks. The second deposition will be limited to 3 hours, as the initial deposition was 8 hours long and some information was obtained. The court also declines to impose sanctions on the defendant and its counsel as requested by the plaintiff. The court will discuss the timing of four motions to quash renewed subpoenas to the plaintiff's former employers at the hearing.
