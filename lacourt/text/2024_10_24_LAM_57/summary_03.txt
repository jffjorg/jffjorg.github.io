And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case 24STCV13533. The ruling grants the Defendant's motion to compel arbitration of the Plaintiff's claims. The Plaintiff had contested the motion, arguing that they did not assent to the arbitration provision in the parties' commercial lease, that the provision did not encompass their claims, and that enforcement of the provision raised concerns of unconscionability. However, the Judge found that the Plaintiff's arguments were unavailing. The Judge noted that the Defendant timely filed the motion, that the Federal Arbitration Act preempts the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure Section 1298, and that the Defendant did not waive its right to seek arbitration. As a result, the Judge is denying the Plaintiff's motion for trial preference and ex parte application to shorten time, and is staying all proceedings in this Court pending the outcome of the arbitration. The Judge has set a hearing on the status of the arbitration for July 24, 2025 at 8:30 A.M.
