  Case Number:  22STCV11073    Hearing Date:   April 22, 2024    Dept:  52 Tentative Ruling:
Defendant Alliance College-Ready
Public Schools’s Motion to Bifurcate Liability from Punitive Damages at Trial
Defendant Alliance College-Ready
Public Schools moves to bifurcate the trial under Civil Code section 3295.  Section 3295, subdivision (d) provides, “The court shall, on application of
any defendant, preclude the admission of evidence of that defendant’s profits
and financial condition until after the trier of fact returns a verdict for
plaintiff awarding actual damages and finds that a defendant is guilty of
malice, oppression, or fraud in accordance with Section 3294.”  This provision “requires a court, upon
application of any defendant, to bifurcate a trial so that the trier of fact is
not presented with evidence of the defendant’s wealth and profits until
after the issues of liability, compensatory damages, and malice, oppression, or
fraud have been resolved against the defendant.”  (Torres v. Automobile Club of So.
California (1997) 15 Cal.4th 771, 777–778.) 
Plaintiff does not oppose the motion.

The motion is granted.  The court hereby bifurcates the trial into: (1) a first phase on liability,
compensatory damages, and liability for punitive damages under Civil Code §
3294; and (2) if the jury finds defendants liable for punitive damages, a
second phase to determine the amount of punitive damages.  The court hereby precludes admission of
evidence of defendants’ profits or financial condition until the second phase
of trial.
