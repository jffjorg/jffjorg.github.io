Significant Statements:
  - The court may, in furtherance of justice, and on such terms as may be proper, allow a party to amend any pleading. (CCP § 473, 576)
  - Leave to amend is generally liberally granted. (Howard v. County of San Diego (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 1422, 1428)
  - The court will not consider the validity of the proposed amended pleading in ruling on a motion for leave since grounds for a demurrer or motion to strike are premature. (Kittredge Sports Co. v. Superior Court (1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 1045, 1048)
  - The application for leave to amend should be made as soon as the need to amend is discovered. (Cal. Rules of Court, Rules 3.1324(b)(3)-(4))
  - The closer the trial date, the stronger the showing required for leave to amend. (Duchrow v. Forrest (2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 1359, 1377-78)
  - If the party seeking the amendment has been dilatory, and the delay has prejudiced the opposing party, the court has the discretion to deny leave to amend. (Hirsa v. Superior Court (1981) 118 Cal.App.3d 486, 490)
```

Please note that the judge's ruling is to deny the plaintiff's motion for leave to file a first amended complaint. The court finds that the plaintiff has not met its burden of demonstrating that leave to amend should be granted, citing the delay in seeking amendment and the lack of sufficient showing as to why the proposed defendants were not identified sooner.
