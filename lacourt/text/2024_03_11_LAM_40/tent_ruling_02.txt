I. Pleadings
A. Pleadings
Plaintiff S.C., by and through his
guardian ad litem, Sergio Cardenas Sr. (S.C.’s father), sues Defendants County
of Los Angeles (L.A. County) through its Department of Children and Family
Services (DCFS), College Hospital, Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD),
ABC Unified School District (ABC Unified), William Gee (Gee), and Does 1
through 10 pursuant to an October 23, 2023 First Amended Complaint (FAC).
This action, as framed by the initial
June 7, 2021 Complaint, was removed to federal court on or around August 3,
2021 and was remanded from federal court on August 18, 2023. While LAUSD argues
that this is the third amended pleading in the actions between the parties, the
Court refers to the operative pleading in this state action as the FAC.
The operative FAC alleges claims of
(1) Negligence against Defendants L.A. County and Does 1 through 10, (2)
Negligence against Defendants ABC Unified, Gee, and Does 1 through 10, (3)
Negligence against Defendants LAUSD and Does 1 through 10, (4) Negligence
against Defendants College Hospital and Does 1 through 10, (5) Violation of
California Government Code § 11135 against Defendants L.A. County, College
Hospital, ABC Unified, and LAUSD, and (6) Violation of California Education
Code §§ 200, 220 against Defendants ABC Unified and LAUSD.
The claims arise from the following
and other allegations contained in the FAC. Since age two, S.C. has been under
the supervision of one or more of the Defendants. S.C. has relied upon the
agencies of California including the child welfare system, social service agencies,
and educational institutions for his care, to keep him safe from harm, and to
provide developmental, educational, and disability services.
Defendants’ collective actions
caused S.C. to be placed in fifteen inappropriate foster care placements, and
sixteen of the most restrictive psychiatric placements. While at these placements.
S.C. frequently ran away, resulting in physical injuries and emotional
distress, sexual assault of S.C. once during his care, and once during an
elopement from care. Each loss of placement and each restrictive psychiatric
placement resulted in the deterioration of S.C.’s mental health and further
institutionalization.
Defendants’ collective failures
culminated in S.C.’s over three-year abandonment at the locked psychiatric
setting of College Hospital at age 15, between October 2017 and February 16, 2021,
for the sole reason that each Defendant refused to fund an appropriate
therapeutic placement. Specifically, at various Individualized Education
Program (IEP) meetings, ABC Unified and Gee refused to make recommendations for
educational placement or services for S.C., arguing that LAUSD needed to make
those determinations as S.C.’s school district of residence, and LAUSD argued
that S.C. was outside of LAUSD’s geographic boundaries and that it would not be
responsible for S.C. until he was physically released from College Hospital, thus
resulting in S.C.’s long-term abandonment at College Hospital. Both districts
also initially refused to fund S.C.’s placement at a Texas county school, with
LAUSD later offering to fund the placement if ABC Unified recommended that S.C.
be transferred, which ABC Unified refused to do.
In December 2019, S.C. filed an
administrative due process complaint with the California Office of
Administrative Hearings (OAH), which was directed against ABC Unified and LAUSD
and sought a determination as to each agency’s responsibilities regarding
offering and securing placement for S.C. On July 21, 2020, the OAH found, among
other things, that ABC Unified violated S.C.’s rights under the Individual with
Disability Education Act by refusing to evaluate and considering S.C.’s
educational placement. The OAH ordered ABC Unified to hold an IEP for S.C.
within 30 days and that LAUSD need not attend IEP meetings but would need to find
S.C. appropriate care after release from College Hospital. ABC Unified and Gee
did not comply with the OAH’s orders within the specified 30 days.
At some point after the OAH’s July
21, 2020, order, LAUSD took responsibility for locating a residential treatment
for S.C. Thereafter, in October 2020, ABC Unified and Gee held an IEP meeting
and offered S.C. a placement in Massachusetts, an offer that ABC Unified forwarded
to LAUSD, and which would include intensive mental health and behavioral
services for S.C. After various complications arose and were resolved—e.g.,
College Hospital’s failure to provide a discharge date, thus delaying the
placement—in January 2021, S.C. was placed in Massachusetts. There, he has for
the first time received 24-hour disability related care and has been stable,
safe, and making progress.
S.C.’s special education
eligibility ends on June 29, 2024, upon his reaching age 22, at which time S.C.
anticipates a return to California, where the South Central Los Angeles
Regional Center (SCLARC) is now planning for S.C.’s services and placement
needs in anticipation of his return to California.
S.C. claims (1) injuries to his
civil rights, denial of access to services, discrimination, exclusion/denial of
access to all aspects of society, unjustifiable isolation and segregation, and violations
of his rights under the U.S. and California Constitutions, (2) pain and
suffering including physical injuries, exacerbation of his condition, causing
new disabilities, permanent loss of developmental opportunities and functional
impairment, (3) emotional distress in the form of serious emotional distress,
trauma, and humiliation, (4) special damages and economic losses including
denial of access to his social security income and other public benefits, and
(5) loss of earning capacity, loss of future earnings and future medical and
mental health costs. S.C. prays for nominal, special, general, and compensatory
damages, as well as equitable and injunctive relief tailored to each Defendant.
B. Demurrer by Defendant L.A.
County
On December 7, 2023, L.A. County
filed a demurrer against the FAC’s first and fifth causes of action as alleged
against it.
On February 27, 2024, S.C. filed an
opposition to L.A. County’s demurrer.
On March 4, 2024, L.A. County filed
a reply to S.C.’s opposition.
L.A. County’s demurrer is now
before the Court.
 
II. Demurrer
A.
Legal Standard
A
demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action.
(Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747; see Code Civ. Proc., §
430.10, subd. (e).) This device can be used only to challenge defects that
appear on the face of the pleading under attack or from matters outside the
pleading that are judicially noticeable. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39
Cal.3d 311, 318.) To sufficiently allege a cause of action, a complaint must
allege all the ultimate facts—that is, the facts needed to establish each element
of the cause of action pleaded. (Committee on Children’s Television, Inc. v.
General Foods Corp. (1983) 35 Cal.3d 197, 212, superseded by statute as
stated in Branick v. Downey Savings & Loan Assn. (2006) 39 Cal.4th
235, 242.) Thus, “[t]o survive a [general] demurrer, the complaint need only
allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action; each evidentiary fact that
might eventually form part of the plaintiff’s proof need not be alleged.” (C.A.
v. William S. Hart Union High School Dist. (2012) 53 Cal.4th 861, 872.) In
testing the sufficiency of the cause of action, the demurrer admits the truth
of all material facts properly pleaded. (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist.
(1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 966-67.) A demurrer, however, “does not admit
contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law.” (Daar v. Yellow Cab
Co. (1967) 67 Cal.2d 695, 713.) When considering demurrers, courts read the
allegations liberally and in context. (Taylor v. City of Los Angeles Dept.
of Water and Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228, disapproved on other
grounds, Jones v. Lodge at Torrey Pines Partnership (2008) 42 Cal.4th
1158, 1162.) The face of the complaint includes exhibits attached to the
complaint. (Frantz v. Blackwell (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 91, 94.) If facts
appearing in the exhibits contradict those alleged, the facts in the exhibits
take precedence. (Holland v. Morse Diesel Intern., Inc. (2001) 86
Cal.App.4th 1443, 1447, superseded by statute on other grounds as stated in White
v. Cridlebaugh (2009) 178 Cal.App.4th 506, 521.)
B.
Demurrer, FAC, First Cause of Action, Negligence: OVERRULED.
1. Relevant Law
“‘The
elements of a cause of action for negligence are … “(a) a legal duty to use due
care;¿(b) a breach of such legal duty;¿[and] (c) the breach as the proximate or
legal cause of the resulting injury.”’” (Ladd v. County of San Mateo
(1996) 12 Cal.4th 913, 917, citations omitted.)
A
public entity cannot be held directly liable for a common law tort. (Miklosy
v. Regents of University of California (2008) 44 Cal.4th 876, 899, citing
Gov. Code, § 815, subd. (a).) This includes a claim for abuse of process. (Yee
v. Superior Court (2019) 31 Cal.App.5th 26, 33.) However, pursuant to
Government Code section 815.2, subdivision (a), a “public entity is liable for
injury proximately caused by an act or omission of an employee of the public
entity within the scope of his employment if the act or omission would, apart
from this section, have given rise to a cause of action against that employee.”
(Ibid.)
Moreover,
in the absence of an explicit provision of statutory liability against a public
entity, a plaintiff can pursue a claim that the entity failed to perform a
mandatory duty imposed on it by law. Section 815.6 provides that “[w]here a
public entity is under a mandatory duty imposed by an enactment … the public
entity is liable for an injury … proximately caused by its failure to discharge
the duty ….” The enactment at issue must be “obligatory, rather than merely
discretionary or permissive … [i.e.,] it must require rather than merely
authorize or permit that a particular action be taken or not taken.” (Haggis
v. City of Los Angeles (2000) 22 Cal.4th 490, 498.) “It is not enough,
moreover, that the public entity or officer have been under an obligation to
perform a function if the function itself involves the exercise of discretion.”
(Id.)
In
turn, Government Code section 820.2 provides that “a public employee is not
liable for an injury resulting from his act or omission where the act or
omission was the result of the exercise of the discretion vested in him,
whether or not such discretion be abused.” An exercise of discretion within the
meaning of section 820.2 means a “conscious balancing of risks and benefits.” (Caldwell
v. Montoya (1995) 10 Cal.4th 972, 983 (Caldwell).) Where “individual
[government employees] will be making assessments of the situation and of the
relevant considerations and dangers in determining the best outcome”, the
actions are discretionary. (Recchia v. City of Los Angeles Dept. of Animal
Services (9th Cir. 2018) 889 F.3d 553, 564.)
Government
Code section 821.6 provides that “[a] public employee is not liable for injury
caused by his instituting or prosecuting any judicial or administrative
proceeding within the scope of his employment, even if he acts maliciously or
without probable cause.” Section 821.6 is not limited to conduct occurring
during formal proceedings. “[I]t also extends to actions taken in preparation
for formal proceedings. Because investigation is ‘an essential step’ toward the
institution of formal proceedings, it is also cloaked with immunity.” (Javor
v. Taggart (2002) 98 Cal.App.4th 795, 808 (Javor), disapproved on
other grounds in Leon v. County of Riverside (Jun. 22, 2023) 14 Cal.5th
910, 931 (Leon) [disapproved string of case law including Javor
that went contrary to the interpretation that section 821.6 is limited to protecting
public employees from liability only for the initiation or prosecution of an
official proceeding].) The policy behind section 821.6 is to encourage state
employees to investigate and prosecute matters “without fear of reprisal from
the person or entity harmed thereby. Protection is provided even when official
action is taken maliciously and without probable cause.” (Shoemaker v. Myers
(1992) 2 Cal.App.4th 1407, 1424.) “Although section 821.6 primarily has been
applied to immunize prosecuting attorneys and similar individuals, the section
is not restricted to legally trained personnel but applies to all employees of
a public entity.” (See Lawrence v. Superior Court (2018) 21 Cal.App.5th
513, 526.)
2. Analysis
The
FAC’s first cause of action alleges negligence against L.A. County and Does 1
through 10 pursuant to allegations located at paragraphs 54-120, 191-193, and
201-203 of the FAC. Those paragraphs allege that the County, through DCFS, owed
various duties of care to juvenile dependents in its charge, and that the
County, through DCFS, “has a history of placing S.C. without providing him with
specialized supports and with caregivers, group homes and institutionalized
settings that were not equipped or specially trained to meet his individual
needs”—e.g., placing S.C. in fifteen inappropriate foster care placements, and
sixteen of the most restrictive psychiatric placements, and subsequently
placing S.C. at College Hospital Cerritos, where S.C. languished for over three
years before being placed in a Massachusetts care facility—thus causing
emotional distress and other injuries to S.C. The claim premises liability
against L.A. County under Government Code sections 815.2 and 815.6, based on breaches
of mandatory duties owed to S.C. by the County through the conduct of DCFS and
other personnel. (FAC, ¶¶ 54-120, 191, 193, 201-203, 204-226 [statutory scheme
at ¶ 214, specific breaches of mandatory duties at ¶¶ 215-217 under specific
statutory schemes].)
In
its demurrer, L.A. County argues that the FAC fails to allege breach of a
specific mandatory duty pursuant to Government Code section 815.6, for which
reason the negligence claim fails. L.A. County also argues that it is entitled
to immunity pursuant to Government Code sections 820.2 and 821.6. (Demurrer,
pp. 4-7.)
In
opposition, Plaintiff S.C. argues that the first cause of action sufficiently
alleges alternate liability premised on Government Code sections 815.2 and
815.6. Plaintiff S.C. also argues that section 821.6 immunities do not apply to
a section 815.2 claim, that the FAC does not allege a basis to find that
section 820.2 and 821.6 immunities exist, and that 820.2 immunity is the
exception to the rule, which should not be applied here based on a comparison
of the FAC’s allegations and various authorities. (Opp’n, pp. 4-12.)
In
reply, L.A. County argues that no liability is stated pursuant to Government
Code section 815.2 where the FAC merely alleges a vague statutory scheme that
does not identify with reasonable particularity the facts supporting a
violation of the specified obligatory statutes, ordinances, policies, and
regulations. L.A. County also argues that the statutes identified in the
opposition do not impose mandatory duties on L.A. County, as supported by
various cited authorities, thus undercutting liability pursuant to section
815.6.
The
Court finds in favor of SC.
First,
at the least, the FAC alleges vicarious liability of certain Division 31
Regulations imposing a mandatory duty. (FAC, ¶¶ 217-217(l).) This is because
social workers “do not have discretion regarding compliance with regulations”
by not complying with the minimum standards required by those regulations,
e.g., monthly home visits to children in foster care. (Scott v. County of
Los Angeles (1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 125, 144 (Scott).) The Court notes
that although Scott involved a total omission (making monthly visits)
rather than negligence in making those visits, for the purposes of the
sufficiency of the first cause of action, the Court is satisfied that Scott
stands for the proposition that a social worker does not have the discretion to
act below the minimum standard of care imposed by applicable regulations. The FAC
pleads this type of failure by alleging DCFS’s employee(s) failure to abide by
a minimum standard of care imposed by regulations applicable to S.C. The Court
notes that L.A. County’s reply does not address Scott at all, merely
focusing on the “statutory scheme” argument in the opposition. (Reply, p. 2.)
The negligence claim thus sufficiently arises from allegations of section 815.2
vicarious liability against L.A. County through, at the very least, the cited
conduct by DCFS.
The
Court therefore need not discuss liability pursuant to section 815.6.
Second,
immunity pursuant to Government Code section 821.6 is not applicable where Scott—an
authority not distinguished in the reply, as discussed above—held that “a
county and its employees are not immune under Government Code sections 815.2
and 821.6 for negligence in the performance of … functions” “performed by a
[public agency] pursuant to [its applicable statutory regulatory framework].” (Scott,
supra, 26 Cal.App.4th at p. 135.)
Moreover,
the claim involves breaches of various regulations, not all of which arise from
allegations that can be construed as the initiation or prosecution of an
official proceeding, undercutting the applicability of this immunity defense to
various portions of the first cause of action. (Leon, supra, 14
Cal.5th at p. 931.)
Third,
immunity pursuant to Government Code section 820.2 is inapplicable where a review
of the FAC as a whole alleges a string of placements by L.A. County that were
harmful to S.C. and do not rise to a “conscious balancing of risks and
benefits” of the duties owed to Plaintiff S.C. as a charge of the County. (Caldwell,
supra, 10 Cal.4th at p. 983; FAC, ¶¶ 54-120, 191, 193, 201-203, 204-226.)
Last,
even if the FAC states improper bases for liability for negligence against L.A.
County, there are some proper bases for liability alleged, as discussed above.
For this reason, the Court cannot sustain a demurrer to the first cause of
action assuming, arguendo, those deficiencies exist. (Kong
v. City of Hawaiian Gardens Redevelopment Agency (2002) 108 Cal.App.4th
1028, 1047 [“A demurrer cannot rightfully be sustained to part of a cause
of action or to a particular type of damage or remedy]; see Code Civ. Proc., §
430.50, subd. (a) [A demurrer can be made to an entire complaint or individual
causes of action therein]; Pierson v. Sharp Memorial Hospital, Inc.
(1989) 216 Cal.App.3d 340, 342 [A motion to strike is generally used to reach
defects in a pleading that are not subject to demurrer].)
L.A.
County’s demurrer to the first cause of action is thus OVERRULED.
C.
Demurrer, FAC, Fifth Cause of Action, Violation of California Government
Code § 11135: SUSTAINED, with leave to amend.
Plaintiff
S.C. concedes the fifth cause of action is not sufficiently stated against
Defendant L.A. County (Opp’n, p. 16), thus MOOTING the analysis of the demurrer
as to this claim. The Court will accordingly SUSTAIN the demurrer as to this
claim. 

III. Conclusion
Defendant County of Los Angeles’s
Demurrer to Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint [CRS# 4712] is OVERRULED in
part and SUSTAINED in part as follows:
(1) OVERRULED as to the First
Amended Complaint’s first cause of action; and
(2) SUSTAINED, with leave to amend,
as to the First Amended Complaint’s fifth cause of action insofar as it relates
to the County of Los Angeles.
