And here is a summary in English text:

This tentative ruling addresses the demurrer filed by Defendant County of Los Angeles to Plaintiff S.C.'s First Amended Complaint. The complaint alleges that the County, through its Department of Children and Family Services, failed to provide adequate care and services to S.C., resulting in harm and injuries. The County argues that the complaint does not sufficiently allege a breach of a specific mandatory duty, and that immunities under Government Code sections 820.2 and 821.6 apply.

The Court finds in favor of the Plaintiff, ruling that the complaint sufficiently alleges a cause of action for negligence against the County. The Court also rules that the complaint's fifth cause of action, which alleges a violation of California Government Code § 11135, is not sufficiently stated and is therefore sustained, with leave to amend.

The Court's ruling is based on the allegations in the complaint, which describe S.C.'s experiences as a child in foster care and psychiatric placements, and the County's alleged failures to provide adequate care and services. The Court finds that the complaint alleges a breach of legal duty by the County and fails to perform mandatory duties, and that the immunities argued by the County do not apply.
