```

And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is a summary of the Judge's decision regarding the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the defendants. The Judge has sustained the demurrer with leave to amend, meaning that the plaintiffs have 20 days to re-file a revised complaint that addresses the issues raised in the demurrer. The motion to strike is deemed MOOT, or unnecessary, since the demurrer has been sustained.

The Judge's decision is based on the uncertainty and ambiguity of the Second Amended Complaint. The complaint is unclear about the type of contract at issue (oral, written, or implied), and the terms of the alleged joint venture agreement are not specified. The Judge finds that the complaint is insufficient to state a cause of action and that the defendants have raised valid grounds for demurrer.
