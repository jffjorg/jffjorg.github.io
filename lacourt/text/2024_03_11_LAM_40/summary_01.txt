Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has tentatively ruled in favor of Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A., Inc.'s Motion to Compel Plaintiffs' Depositions and Request for Sanctions. The Court finds that Plaintiffs Jorge Hernandez Camacho and Sara Martinez failed to appear at depositions and failed to produce documents requested in the amended deposition notices. The Court grants the motion to compel depositions and orders Plaintiffs to appear at depositions within 21 days. The Court also grants monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,750 against Plaintiffs and their counsel, Knight Law Group, LLP, Roger Kirnos, and Angelica Zamudio. The Court finds that Plaintiffs' refusal to submit to depositions is a basis for the sanctions. The Court notes that Plaintiffs had proposed deposition dates in April 2024, but these dates did not occur until after the motion was filed. The Court concludes that Toyota USA has standing to move to compel the initial attendance of Plaintiffs at a deposition and that good cause exists for production of the documents requested in the amended deposition notices.
