And here is a summary in plain English:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on a motion by the plaintiff, Westside Valley Venture, LLC, to file a first amended complaint. The plaintiff wants to delete all causes of action except for declaratory relief and quiet title. The defendant, James Chewen Chang, is opposing the motion, arguing that the plaintiff cannot avoid a ruling on an anti-SLAPP motion by amending the complaint.

The judge has granted the request of the defendant to continue the hearing on the motion for leave to amend to be heard the same day as the anti-SLAPP motion. The court will rule on the anti-SLAPP motion first, and then hear the motion for leave to amend.

The dispute is about whether the plaintiff can file a first amended complaint without prejudice, and whether the sixth cause of action can be stricken by an anti-SLAPP motion. The judge will consider the applicable laws, including Code of Civil Procedure sections 473 and 425.16, as well as case law, including Dickinson v. Cosby (2017) 17 Cal.App.5th 655.
