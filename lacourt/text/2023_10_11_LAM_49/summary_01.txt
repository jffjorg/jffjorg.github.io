English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the motion for judgment on the pleadings filed by the defendants, Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority and Public Transportation Services Corporation. The plaintiff, Andrew Black, alleges that the defendants terminated him after he made complaints about bus driver safety and for informing the bus drivers of solutions to protect them. The plaintiff also alleges that the defendants made false assurances to him regarding his ability to be fired.

The judge finds that both defendants are public entities and therefore subject to the Government Claims Act, which requires a claim to be filed prior to filing a lawsuit. The plaintiff has not pleaded facts addressing the claim presentation requirement, and therefore, his complaint is barred against both defendants.

The judge also finds that the plaintiff's Labor Code claims, which are based on alleged violations of Labor Code sections 6310(a)(1) and 970, are subject to the claim filing requirements and that the plaintiff has not complied with these requirements.

The judge grants the motion for judgment on the pleadings and orders the plaintiff to have the opportunity to make an offer of proof as to how he can reasonably amend the complaint consistent with this ruling. If the plaintiff cannot make a reasonable amendment, no leave to amend will be given.
