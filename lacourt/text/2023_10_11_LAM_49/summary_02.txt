And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiffs' motion to strike various affirmative defenses raised by the defendant, Pasadena Unified School District. The plaintiffs are a group of Latino students and parents who are suing the district for closing three predominantly Latino elementary schools. The plaintiffs allege that the closures had a disproportionate effect on Latino students and seek declaratory and injunctive relief.

The judge has granted the motion to strike in part, finding that some of the defendant's affirmative defenses are irrelevant to the action. Specifically, the judge has struck the defendant's fifth, ninth, sixteenth, nineteenth, twentieth, and twenty-first affirmative defenses, which relate to damages, speech, and the Government Claims Act. The judge has also struck the defendant's first affirmative defense, which is based on negligence principles, since the plaintiffs do not assert any negligence claims.

The judge has denied the motion to strike the entirety of the defendant's answer, finding that it was not filed in nonconformity with the court's prior ruling on the defendants' demurrer. The judge has ordered the parties to give notice of the ruling, unless waived.
