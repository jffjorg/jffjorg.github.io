Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Yvonne Johnson (also known as Yvonne Manesh) against United Specialty Insurance Company. The plaintiff has brought a lawsuit against the defendant, seeking to recover the amount of the judgment and attorney's fees from a prior action. The defendant has filed a demurrer to the third and fourth causes of action, arguing that they are barred by the statute of limitations and that the defendant had no duty to defend the plaintiff in the underlying action.

The judge has sustained the demurrer without leave to amend, meaning that the plaintiff will not be able to refile the claims. The judge has also granted the defendant's request for judicial notice of the underlying action.

The judge has found that the new allegations in the third amended complaint relate back to the original complaint, but that the statute of limitations has been tolled due to the insurer's failure to respond to the plaintiff's tender. However, the judge has also found that the defendant had no duty to defend the plaintiff in the underlying action because the claims made against the plaintiff were not for bodily injury or property damage, which are the only types of claims that the insurance policy covers.

The judge has therefore sustained the demurrer to the third and fourth causes of action, and the plaintiff will not be able to recover the amount of the judgment and attorney's fees.
