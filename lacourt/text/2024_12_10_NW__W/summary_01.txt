And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to compel compliance with the court's order to produce discovery responses, in part. The defendant had requested that the plaintiff comply with the court's September 4, 2024 order, which required the plaintiff to produce further discovery responses without objection within 30 days. However, the plaintiff failed to comply with the order, and the defendant has sought terminating sanctions against the plaintiff. The judge has found that the plaintiff's failure to comply with the court's order is a flagrant abuse of the discovery process and has granted the defendant's motion to compel compliance with the court's order. The judge has also denied the defendant's request for terminating sanctions at this time, but has left the door open for the defendant to seek further sanctions if the plaintiff fails to comply with the court's order in the future.
