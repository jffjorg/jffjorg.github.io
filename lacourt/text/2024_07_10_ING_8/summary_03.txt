Significant Statements:
  - "To survive a demurrer, the complaint need only allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action; each evidentiary fact that might eventually form part of the plaintiff's proof need not be alleged."
  - "A demurrer for uncertainty is strictly construed, even where a complaint is in some respects uncertain, because ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery procedures."
  - "The discovery rule only delays accrual until the plaintiff has, or should have, inquiry notice of the cause of action."
  - "A plaintiff whose complaint shows on its face that his claim would be barred without the benefit of the discovery rule must specifically plead facts to show (1) the time and manner of discovery and (2) the inability to have made earlier discovery despite reasonable diligence."
```

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendant's demurrer is sustained with leave to amend. The demurrer argues that the plaintiff's lawsuit is time-barred by the statute of limitations, which is four years for breach of implied warranty of merchantability. The judge finds that the plaintiff's complaint does not adequately plead the discovery rule, which delays the start of the statute of limitations until the plaintiff discovers or should have discovered the cause of action. The judge requires the plaintiff to amend their complaint to plead the tolling allegations with greater specificity, including details about the repair history of the vehicle and the circumstances of the claimed belated discovery.
