```

And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the defendants' request for judicial notice and continues the hearing on their demurrer to January 11, 2024. The demurrer was filed in response to the plaintiff's complaint, which alleges legal malpractice, fraud, and other claims. The defendants argue that the complaint fails to state a cause of action. The Judge finds that the action against America First Credit Union is still pending and a dismissal has not been entered, which affects the plaintiff's claims in the instant action. Therefore, the hearing is continued to allow for further developments in the related action.
