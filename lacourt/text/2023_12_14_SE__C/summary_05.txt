Summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the motion to consolidate the three related cases, 22STCV29276, 23NWCV03161, and 23NWCV03263, into a single case. The Judge finds that consolidating the cases would promote judicial economy and minimize prejudice to the parties. The Judge also grants the motion to sever Minor Plaintiffs' claims from the consolidated action, allowing them to proceed to trial sooner. Finally, the Judge denies the motion to reclassify Minor Plaintiffs' claims as limited civil cases, finding that the claims necessarily involve more than $25,000.00.
