And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Plaintiff Elizabeth A. Velasco's motion for summary adjudication in its entirety. The motion was filed in response to Defendant Dyno Autosales, Inc.'s various affirmative defenses. The judge found that Defendant failed to comply with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1350 and Code of Civil Procedure § 437c(b)(3) in its opposition papers, which resulted in the judge granting the motion. The judge also noted that Defendant withdrew several of its affirmative defenses, which were no longer applicable. The judge's decision is based on the facts of the case, including the purchase of a used vehicle with an express warranty and extended warranty, the repair of the vehicle's engine, and the replacement of the vehicle's engine and turbo kit. The judge's decision is a significant step in the case, which will now proceed to the next stage.
