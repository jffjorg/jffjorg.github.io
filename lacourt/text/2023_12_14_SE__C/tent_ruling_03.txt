TENTATIVE ORDER
 
Defendants BLK Support Firm and Bruce Loren Karey’s
demurrer is CONTINUED to January 11, 2024 at 9:30 a.m. in Dept. SE-C. 
 
 
Moving parties to give notice. 
 
 
This action arises from alleged legal malpractice. On
October 12, 2022, Plaintiff Maria Esther Flores Prieto (“Plaintiff”) filed a
complaint against Defendants BLK Legal Support Firm, Bruce Loren Karey
(“Karey”), Alexander Cotton, and Does 1 through 10, alleging causes of action
for: (1) Professional Negligence (Legal Malpractice); (2) Fraud; (3) Intentional
Infliction of Emotional Distress; (4) Breach of Contract; (5) Breach of
Fiduciary Duties; and (6) Negligent Supervision.  
 
Plaintiff alleges that “around January 2020, due to
Defendants undue delay in preparing Plaintiff’s paperwork for her small claim,
one of her vehicles was sold in an auction by the bank without her notice.
Plaintiff called Defendant Cotton and informed him of the sale of her vehicle. Plaintiff
was upset and confused since she didn’t understand why her vehicle was sold
since she was under the impression that the small claim would have stopped the
bank from taking any further action without the court’s authority. Defendant
Cotton informed Plaintiff that he had not worked on her small claim and that he
was unable to prepare it at the moment because her vehicle was already sold.”
(Complaint, ¶ 17.) 
 
Plaintiff further alleges that “Defendants provided
Plaintiff with an altered/fraudulent document in order to silence her about her
case updates and to put up a farce that they were actively working on her case when
in reality they were unduly delaying it, substantially reducing her chances of
winning on the merits. Moreover, Defendants did not file a small claims
resulting in her losing her vehicles valued at an estimate of $22,590.00.
Moreover, when the American First Credit Union Case was finally filed with the
Court on April 14, 2022, Defendants failed to file a Notice of Entry of Default
against American First Credit Union when sufficient time passed from the
allocated time to respond.” (Id., ¶ 29.)
 
On February 15, 2023, Defendants BLK Legal Support Firm and
Karey (“Moving Defendants”) filed a demurer to each cause of action in the
complaint. 
 
On February 15, 2023, Defendant Karey filed a
Cross-Complaint against Plaintiff alleging causes of action for: (1) Breach of
Contract; and (2) Common Count—For Unpaid Goods/Services. 
 
On August 24, 2023, after a hearing, the Court continued the
hearing on Moving Defendants’ demurrer to December 14, 2023. The Court
continued the hearing on the demurrer because an action was pending in Orange
County “pertaining to the filing of Plaintiff’s action against America First
Credit Union.” (08/24/23 Minute Order.) The Court found that Plaintiff’s claims
in the instant action were partially based on “Defendants’ purported
malpractice pertaining to the filing of Plaintiff’s action against America First
Credit Union.” (Id.) 
 
Judicial Notice 
 
The Court GRANTS Moving Defendants’ requests for judicial
notice. 
 
Legal Standard
 
“A demurrer tests the sufficiency of a complaint as a matter
of law.”  (Durell v. Sharp Healthcare
(2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 1350, 1358.) “[T]he court gives the complaint a
reasonable interpretation, and treats the demurrer as admitting all material
facts properly pleaded.”  (Ibid.)
“[A] demurrer accepts as true all well pleaded facts and those facts of which
the court can take judicial notice but not deductions, contentions, or
conclusions of law or fact.” (Fox v. JAMDAT Mobile, Inc. (2010) 185
Cal.App.4th 1068, 1078.) Although courts construe pleadings liberally,
sufficient facts must be alleged to support the allegations plead to survive a
demurrer. (Rakestraw v. California Physicians' Serv. (2000) 81
Cal.App.4th 39, 43.)  
 
Where a demurrer is sustained, leave to amend must be
allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman
v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.) The burden is on the plaintiff to
show the court that a pleading can be amended successfully. (Ibid.) “If
there is any reasonable possibility that the plaintiff can state a good cause
of action, it is error to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend.” (Youngman
v. Nevada Irrigation Dist. (1969) 70 Cal.2d 240, 245).  
 
 
The Orange County Action 
 
“[A]n attorney is subject to liability for malpractice when
his or her negligent investigation, advice, or conduct of the client’s affairs
results in loss of a meritorious claim.” (Stanley v. Richmond (1995) 35
Cal.App.4th 1070, 1092.) 
 
According to Moving Defendants’ Second Request for Judicial
Notice, on November 9, 2023, a Notice of Settlement of Entire Case was filed in
Plaintiff’s action against America First Credit Union in the Superior Court of
California, County of Orange. (Request for Judicial Notice, Exhibit A.) A
conditional settlement has been entered and a request for dismissal will be
filed no later than January 9, 2024. (Id.) The notice of settlement
provides that “[t]he settlement agreement conditions dismissal of this matter
on the satisfactory completion of specified terms that are not to be performed
within 45 days of the date of the settlement.” (Id.) The trial date in
the action against America First Credit Union has been vacated and an OSC re:
Dismissal in the Orange County action is scheduled for March 11, 2024 in the
action against America First Credit Union. (Id., Exhibit B.) The Court
ordered terms of settlement to be completed on or before January 9, 2024. (Id.)

 
Given that the action against America First Credit Union is
still pending[1]
and a dismissal has not been entered in such action, the Court finds that a
continuance of the hearing on Moving Defendants’ demurrer is appropriate. As
was stated in the Court’s August 24, 2023 Minute Order, part of Plaintiff’s
claims in the instant action arise from Defendants’ alleged malpractice
pertaining to Plaintiff’s action against America First Credit Union. 
 
Therefore, the Court CONTINUES the hearing on Moving
Defendants’ demurrer to the complaint to Thursday, January 11, 2024 at 9:30 AM
in this department.
