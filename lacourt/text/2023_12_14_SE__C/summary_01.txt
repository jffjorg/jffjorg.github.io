**Significant Statements:** The Court finds that ERRE's motion for reconsideration is denied because it does not meet the high burden of demonstrating diligence in searching for all supporting evidence available to it at the time of the set aside hearing. The Court grants Plaintiff's motion to strike the verified answer filed by Rios because it was filed after a proper entry of default. The Court grants Plaintiff's application for writ of attachment because it demonstrates the basis of its claims and that it is entitled to possession of the property at issue.
