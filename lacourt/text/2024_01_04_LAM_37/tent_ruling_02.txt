Background
 
On
June 13, 2023, Paul Dodds (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint against Aquaco
Resources, Inc. (“Aquaco”); Patrick R. McEntee (“McEntee”); and Does 1 to 100.
The Complaint alleges two causes of action: (1) Breach of Contract; and (2)
Conversion. 
On
September 26, 2023, Defendant McEntee, in pro per, filed a Response to Lawsuit.
Plaintiff now moves to strike the answer and an order directing Aquaco to
designate a licensed attorney within 30 days or that default be entered against
Aquaco.

strike[1]
 
I.         Legal Standard
 
¿Any party, within the time
allowed to respond to a pleading may serve and file a notice of motion to
strike the whole or any part thereof. (CCP § 435(b)(1); CRC, rule 3.1322(b).)
The court may, upon a motion or at any time in its discretion and upon terms it
deems proper: (1) strike out any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted
in any pleading; or (2) strike out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or
filed in conformity with the laws of California, a court rule, or an order of
the court. (CCP § 436(a)-(b); Stafford v. Shultz (1954) 42 Cal.2d 767,
782 [“Matter in a pleading which is not essential to the claim is surplusage;
probative facts are surplusage and may be stricken out or
disregarded”].)¿¿¿¿ 
  
“Where the defect raised by a
motion to strike or by demurrer is reasonably capable of cure, leave to amend
is routinely and liberally granted to give the plaintiff a chance to cure the
defect in question.” (CLD Construction, Inc. v. City of San Ramon (2004)
120 Cal.App.4th 1141, 1146.) The burden is on the complainant to show the Court
that a pleading can be amended successfully. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976)
18 Cal.3d 335, 348.)¿¿¿ 
 
II.        Discussion
 
Plaintiff moves to strike Defendant Aquaco’s Answer in its
entirety because it was filed by a pro per party, Defendant McEntee. 
“[U]nder a long-standing common law rule of procedure, a corporation, unlike a natural person, cannot
represent itself before courts of record in propria persona, nor can it
represent itself through a corporate officer, director or other employee who is
not an attorney. It must be represented by licensed counsel in proceedings
before courts of record.” (CLD Construction, Inc. v. City of San
Ramon (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 1141, 1145.) The
rationale for this rule is that “a corporation, as an artificial entity created
by law, can only act in its affairs through its natural person agents and
representatives. If the corporate agent who would likely appear on behalf of
the corporation in court proceedings, e.g., an officer or director, is not an
attorney, that person would be engaged in the unlicensed practice of law.” (Id.
at p. 1146.) For this reason, a corporation cannot file a pleading in propria
persona.  
 
When a corporation seeks to appear without the benefit of
counsel in other than small claims cases, it is the duty of the
trial court to advise the representative of the corporation of the
necessity to be represented by a licensed lawyer. If no such licensed
representative is present, appearing for the corporation, the court may: 
 
(1) hear a motion for continuance;
or 
(2) enter the corporation's default for
nonappearance at trial.
 
(Van Gundy v.
Camelot Resorts, Inc. (1983) 152 Cal.App.3d Supp. 29, 31–32.)
 
For
the reasons stated above, Plaintiff’s motion to strike Aquaco’s Answer is
granted. “[I]t is more appropriate and just to treat a corporation's failure to be
represented by an attorney as a defect that may be corrected, on such terms as
are just in the sound discretion of the court” and for this reason, the court
grants the motion with leave to amend. (CLD Construction, Inc., supra, 120
Cal.App.4th at p. 1149.) “[T]he court retains authority to dismiss an action if
an unrepresented corporation does not obtain counsel within reasonable time. (Id.
at p. 1150.) 
 
The court gives Defendant Aquaco 30 days leave to seek
representation from licensed counsel, otherwise, the court will enter default
against Defendant. 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff’s
Motion to Strike Aquaco’s Answer is granted with leave to amend. Defendant
Aquaco 
is given 30 days to find licensed
counsel. The court sets an OSC re Proof of Service for February 
9, 2024, at 8:30 a.m.
 
Plaintiff to give notice.
