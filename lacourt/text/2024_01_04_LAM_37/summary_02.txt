Summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on Plaintiff Paul Dodds' Motion to Strike Defendant Aquaco Resources, Inc.'s Answer. The Judge granted the motion due to the fact that Defendant Aquaco's Answer was filed by a pro per party, Defendant McEntee, who is not an attorney. The Judge held that a corporation cannot represent itself in court without the benefit of counsel, and that Defendant Aquaco must be represented by a licensed attorney. The Judge granted leave to amend and gave Defendant Aquaco 30 days to find licensed counsel. If Defendant Aquaco fails to do so, the court will enter default against it. The case will be set for further proceedings on February 9, 2024, at 8:30 a.m.
