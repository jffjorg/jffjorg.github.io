Significant Statements:
  - The court finds that "good cause" exists to extend the filing deadline of this Motion because the Defendant's counsel was negotiating with Plaintiffs' counsel a date to file a responsive pleading.
  - The filing of a proof of service creates a rebuttable presumption that the service was proper, but only if it "complies with the statutory requirements regarding such proofs."
  - Knowledge by a defendant of a plaintiff's action does not satisfy the requirement of adequate service of a summons and complaint.
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to quash the service of summons and complaint. The defendant had argued that he was not personally served and that the service was improper. The judge found that the plaintiff's proof of service was incomplete and did not provide sufficient evidence that the defendant was personally served. The judge also found that the defendant's neighbor was served with the summons and complaint, which further supports the defendant's claim that the service was improper. The judge denied the plaintiff's request for dismissal and granted the plaintiff a 30-day extension to serve the defendant.
