Pursuant to CCP § 435.5(a),
Plaintiff’s counsel unsuccessfully attempted to meet and confer with Defendant
McEntee prior to filing this Motion. (Schell Decl. ¶ 4, Ex. C.) “A determination by the court that the
meet and confer process was insufficient shall not be grounds to grant or deny
the motion to strike.” (CCP § 435.5(a)(4).) Therefore, the court continues to the
merits of the motion.
