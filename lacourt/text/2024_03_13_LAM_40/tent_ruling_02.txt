I. Background
A. Pleadings
On November 17, 2023, American
Business Bank (ABB) filed a Complaint suing Defendants D T S Enterprise, Inc.
(DTSE), D T S Builders Inc. (DTSB), Leslie Dain Sorg (Sorg), Ryan Thomas Isbell
(Isbell), and Does 1 through 25 pursuant to nine claims stated in the body of
the Complaint—though only seven claims are stated in the caption page:
(1) Breach of Business Loan
Agreement, (2) Breach of Promissory Note, and (3) Foreclosure of Security
Interests against Defendants DTSE and Does 1-10;
(4) Foreclosure of Security
Interests Granted by DTSB to ABB against Defendants DTSB and Does 1-10;
(5) Preliminary Injunction against
Defendants DTSE, DTSB, Sorg, Isbell, and Does 5-15; 
(6) Breach of Commercial Guaranty
and (8) Breach of Restrictive Covenant against Defendants Sorg and Does 5-15;
(7) Breach of Commercial Guaranty
against Defendants Isbell and Does 5-15;
(8) Breach of Restrictive Covenant;
and
(9) Unjust Enrichment against
Defendants Sorg, Isbell, and Does 5-15.
On January 8, 2024, Defendant Isbell
filed a Cross-Complaint suing Cross-Defendant Leslie Dain Sorg and Roes 1
through 10 pursuant to a single claim of fraud.
The claims in the pleadings arise
from a business loan made by ABB to DTSE, as secured by a loan agreement,
promissory note and promissory note agreement, and commercial security
agreement between these parties, and various other agreements between ABB and
the remaining Defendants securing the loan or securing collateral interests.
B. Relevant Procedural History
On February 20, 2024, Defendant
Isbell filed a notice of stay of proceedings as to Ryan Isbell only based on
his February 19, 2024, initiation of Chapter 13 bankruptcy proceedings.
That same day, the Court stayed
proceedings as to Thomas Ryan Isbell.
C. Petition Before the Court
On January 4, 2024, ABB filed a
petition to compel arbitration of its claims against all Defendants. The petition
arises from ABB’s invocation of arbitration clauses in agreements between ABB and
DTSE (the Loan Agreement, Promissory Note, and Commercial Security Agreement), ABB
and Defendant Sorg (Commercial Guaranty), ABB and Defendant Isbell (Commercial
Guaranty), and ABB and DTSB (Commercial Security Agreement).
ABB’s petition was served by mail
on counsel for Defendant Isbell—a party as to whom a stay has since been
imposed—and on Leslie Dain Sorg on behalf of herself and DTSE and DTSB.
ABB’s petition is unopposed by all
Defendants as of the date of this hearing.
ABB’s petition is now before the
Court.
 
II. Petition to Compel Arbitration: GRANTED [DTSE,
DTSB, Sorg]; DENIED, without prejudice [Isbell].
A. Legal Standard
On a petition to compel
arbitration, the court must grant the petition unless it finds that (1) no
written agreement to arbitrate exists, (2)¿the right to compel arbitration has
been waived, (3) grounds exist for revocation of the agreement, or (4) litigation
is pending that may render the arbitration unnecessary or create
conflicting¿rulings on common issues. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.2.)
The party seeking arbitration has
the “burden of proving the existence of a valid arbitration agreement by a
preponderance of the evidence” (Ruiz v. Moss Bros. Auto Group, Inc.
(2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 836, 842) and that the claims in the challenged pleading
fall within the scope of the arbitration agreement. (See Bono v. David
(2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 1055, 1067; Rice v. Downs (2016) 248 Cal.App.4th
175, 186.)  “Once that burden is
satisfied, the party opposing arbitration must prove by a preponderance of the evidence
any defense to the petition.” (Lacayo v. Cataline Restaurant Group Inc.
(2019) 38 Cal.App.5th 244, 257.
“A party required to prove
something by a preponderance of the evidence ‘need prove only that it is more
likely to be true than not true.’ [Citation.] Preponderance of the evidence
means ‘“that the evidence on one side outweighs, preponderates over, is more
than, the evidence on the other side, not necessarily in number of witnesses or
quantity, but in its effect on those to whom it is addressed.”’ [Citations.] In
other words, the term refers to ‘evidence that has more convincing force than
that opposed to it.’ [Citations.]” (People ex rel. Brown v. Tri-Union
Seafoods, LLC (2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 1549, 1567.)
“The trial court sits as the trier
of fact, weighing all the affidavits, declarations, and other documentary
evidence, and any oral testimony the court may receive at its discretion, to
reach a final determination.” (Ruiz, supra, at p. 842.) 
“California law, ‘like [federal
law], reflects a strong policy favoring arbitration agreements and requires
close judicial scrutiny of waiver claims.’” (Wagner Const. Co. v. Pacific
Mechanical Corp. (2007) 41 Cal.4th 19, 31.)
If the court orders arbitration,
then the court shall stay the action until arbitration is completed. (See
Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.4.)
B. Analysis
1. Preliminary Discussion
– Defendant and Cross-Complainant Isbell
Given that a stay has been entered
as to Defendant Isbell (2/20/23 Minutes, p. 1), the Court’s order here does not
apply to him. Nevertheless, for the sake of completeness, the Court discusses
the arbitration petition in full, including its references to Defendant Isbell.
2. Preliminary
Discussion – Service and Nonappearance
Here, the Complaint and summons
were served on all four Defendants—DTSE, DTSB, Sorg, and Isbell—on November 21,
2023. (11/28/23 Proofs of Service [DTSE, DTSB, Sorg, Isbell].)
Service was effected on Defendants
DTSE, DTSB, and Sorg by personal service on Defendant Leslie Dain Sorg
personally at 4530 Crestview Drive, Norco, California 92860, with service
effected on her individually and as President of DTSE and DTSB. (11/28/23
Proofs of Service [DTSE, DTSB, Sorg].)
Service was effected on Defendant
Isbell personally at 8521 Kendor Drive, Buena Park, California 90620. (11/28/23
Proof of Service [Isbell].)
Defendants DTSE, DTSB, and Sorg
have since altogether failed to make any filings in these proceedings and have
not appeared at any of the three hearings in this action, which took place on
December 12, 2023, and February 20, 2024, in Department 82, and on December 12,
2023, in Department 40. (12/12/23 & 2/20/24 Minutes.)
Defendant Isbell has only
participated in these proceedings by filing answers, his Cross-Complaint, and
his notice of stay of proceedings based on ongoing bankruptcy proceedings.
(1/8/23 Answer; 1/8/24 Cross-Complaint; 1/16/24 Verified Answer; 2/20/24 Notice
of Stay.) He has not appeared at any of the hearings. (12/12/23 & 2/20/24
Minutes.)
The instant Petition was served on
Defendants DTSE, DTSB, and Sorg on January 4, 2024 by mail to the same address
where service of the Complaint and summons was effected: 4530 Crestview Drive,
Norco, California 92860. (Petition, Proof of Service, Service List.)
Thus, the Court determines that
Defendants DTSE, DTSB, and Sorg have had adequate notice of this proceeding or
this petition, even if they have elected to not participate in the proceedings.
3. Agreement to
Arbitrate
When seeking to compel arbitration,
the initial burden lies with the moving party to demonstrate the existence of a
valid arbitration agreement by preponderance of the evidence. (Ruiz v. Moss
Bros. Auto Group (2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 836, 841-842; Gamboa v.
Northeast Community Clinic (2021) 72 Cal.App.5th 158, 164-165 (Gamboa).)
It is sufficient for the moving party to produce a copy of the arbitration
agreement or set forth the agreement’s provisions. (Gamboa, supra,
at p. 165.) Subsequently, the moving party must establish with the
preponderance of admissible evidence a valid arbitration agreement between the
parties. (Id. at pp. 165-166.)
Here, ABB attaches copies of
agreements separately entered into with each Defendant, each of which contain an
arbitration clause. (Petition, Pyle Decl., Exs. 1-6.) This evidence carries
ABB’s initial burden. (Gamboa, supra, 72 Cal.App.5th at p. 165.)
And because there is no opposition to this petition, ABB sufficiently meets its
burden as to this issue. (Ibid.)
4. Scope of
Agreement
“[T]he decision as to whether a
contractual arbitration clause covers a particular dispute rests substantially
on whether the clause in question is ‘broad’ or ‘narrow.’” (Bono, supra,
147 Cal.App.4th at p. 1067.) “‘A “broad” clause includes those using language
such as “any claim arising from or related to this agreement”’ [Citation] or
‘arising in connection with the [a]greement’ [Citation.]” (Rice, supra,
248 Cal.App.4th at p. 186, italics omitted.) “But clauses requiring arbitration
of a claim, dispute, or controversy ‘arising from’ or ‘arising out of’ an
agreement, i.e., excluding language such as ‘relating to this agreement’ or ‘in
connection with this agreement,’ are ‘generally considered to be more limited
in scope than would be, for example, a clause agreeing to arbitrate “‘any
controversy … arising out of or relating to this agreement[.]’” [Citations.]” (Id.
at p. 186-87 [italics omitted].) “Several Ninth Circuit cases have held that
agreements requiring arbitration of ‘any dispute,’ ‘controversy,’ or ‘claim’
‘arising under’ or ‘arising out of’ the agreement are intended to encompass
only disputes relating to the interpretation and performance of the agreement.”
(Id. at p. 187.)
Here, the arbitration clauses in
the six agreements are nearly identical and provide: “[A]ll disputes, claims
and controversies between [ABB and each respective Defendant,] whether
individual, joint, or class in nature, arising from [the agreement at issue] or
otherwise, including without limitation contract and tort disputes, shall be
arbitrated pursuant to the Rules of the American Arbitration Association in
effect at the time the claim is filed, upon request of either party.” (Petition, Pyle Decl., ¶¶ 4-5, 7-8,
9-10, 11-12, 13-14, 15-16; Petition, Pyle Decl., Ex. 1, p. 4, § Arbitration
& Ex. 2, p. 2, § Arbitration & Ex. 3, p. 4, § Arbitration & Ex. 4,
p. 2, § Arbitration [Sorg] & Ex. 5, p. 2, § Arbitration [Isbell] & Ex.
6, p. 4, § Arbitration [DTSB].)
A review of the Complaint’s claims
show that they arise from the agreements with Defendants because all the claims
arise from Defendants’ breaches of those agreements. (Complaint, ¶¶ 34-98.)
 Based on the above, the Court determines that
the claims alleged in the Complaint fall within the scope of the arbitration
clauses at issue.
5. Defenses
A “party opposing arbitration must
prove by a preponderance of the evidence any defense to the petition” to compel
arbitration in the matter. (Lacayo v. Cataline Restaurant Group Inc., supra,
38 Cal.App.5th at p. 257.)
Here, because no Defendant filed an
opposition, there are no defenses to ABB’s petition, for which reason there is
no valid ground to determine that ABB may not invoke the arbitration clause in
the agreements between itself and each respective Defendant.
6. Arbitration
Conclusion
ABB’s petition is GRANTED as to
Defendants DTSE, DTSB, and Sorg.
However, based on the preliminary
discussion at Section II.B.1., ABB’s petition is DENIED as to
Defendant/Cross-Complainant Isbell without prejudice, because of the stay.
7. Stay
“If a court of competent
jurisdiction, whether in this State or not, has ordered arbitration of a controversy
which is an issue involved in an action or proceeding pending before a court of
this State, the court in which such action or proceeding is pending shall, upon
motion of a party to such action or proceeding, stay the action or proceeding
until an arbitration is had in accordance with the order to arbitrate or until
such earlier time as the court specifies.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.4.)
Here, the Court has granted ABB’s
petition, for which reason the Court STAYS this action as to the Complaint against
Defendants D T S Enterprise, Inc., D T S Builders Inc., and Leslie Dain Sorg until
arbitration is had in accordance with this order or until such earlier time as
the Court specifies. This order does not apply to Defendants/Cross-Complainant
Isbell, as to whom a stay has been entered on other grounds. (2/20/24 Minutes,
p. 1.)
 
III. Conclusion
A. Arbitration
Plaintiff America Business Bank’s
Petition for An Order Compelling Arbitration is GRANTED in part and DENIED in
part as follows:
(1) GRANTED as to Defendants D T S
Enterprise, Inc., D T S Builders Inc., and Leslie Dain Sorg; and
(2) DENIED as to Defendant Ryan
Thomas Isbell, without prejudice.
The Court ORDERS Defendants D T S
Enterprise, Inc., D T S Builders Inc., and Leslie Dain Sorg to arbitration in
relation to the claims alleged against them in Plaintiff America Business
Bank’s Complaint.
B. Stay
The Court STAYS this action as to
the Complaint against Defendants D T S Enterprise, Inc., D T S Builders Inc., and
Leslie Dain Sorg until arbitration is had in accordance with this order or
until such earlier time as the Court specifies. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.4.) This
order does not apply to Defendants/Cross-Complainant Isbell, as to whom a stay
has been entered on other grounds. (2/20/24 Minutes, p. 1.)
