Respondents object to the spacing of Petitioner’s opposition, arguing that the
37 lines on the page are not 1.5 spaced in compliance with CRC 2.108(1).  Petitioner disagrees.  See Tiffany v. State Farm Mutual
Auto Insurance Co., (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 1763, 1767 (referring
to 37 lines as compliant).  The
opposition is legible, and the court accepts it as compliant.

            [3] The
City requests judicial notice of the following: (1) a certified agenda for the
September 21, 2023 CHC hearing (RJN Ex. A); (2) a certified audio for the
September 21, 2023 CHC hearing (RJN Ex. B); (3) a certified report from
Planning and LADBS on the status of the Historical Property Contracts for the
Jardinette Property and other properties (RJN Ex. C); (5) sections 50281, 502080.1,
and 50284 and 50287, both as enacted in 1972 and as effective January 1, 2012
(RJN Exs. D-I); (6) the court’s decision on the City’s demurrer to the FAP (RJN
Ex. J); and (7) a certified reporter’s transcript of the March 7, 2024 hearing
for the demurrer to the FAP (RJN Ex. K).
            There is no need to judicially notice the demurrer ruling
(RJN Ex. J) or the reporter’s transcript from that ruling (RJN Ex. K).  The court can always review the case file of
the pending case and transcripts from the cause are authorized by the CCP.  The CHC audio of its meeting is not subject
to judicial notice and the request for RJN Ex. B is denied.  The remaining exhibits (RJN Exs. A, C, and D-I)
are judicially noticed.  Evid. Code
§452(b), (c).
            Petitioner seeks judicial notice of the legislative
history of the Mills Act (RJN Exs. 16-18), including pages attached as exhibits
to the SAP.  The request is granted.  Evid. Code §452(b).


[4]
Petitioner suggests that section 50287 does not deny all third-party actions if
it is not done to enforce the property owner’s Mills Act contract.  Opp. at 9, n. 4.  Petitioner does not suggest how a third party
could bring an action for any other purpose besides enforcement of the contract.  


[5] The
parties also debate whether the fourth cause of action is moot. The City argues
that it took the precise action that Petitioner is requesting the court to
order.  SAP, Prayer ¶6.  On October 12, 2022, the City Council
instructed staff to submit within 30 days an assessment of whether the
“Jardinette is being preserved and maintained in accordance with the terms of”
the Jardinette’s Contract.”  SAP, Ex. 2.
On September 23, 2023, CHC formed a committee to inspect the Property.  RJN Ex. F. 
On November 20, 2023, City staff transmitted a report to the City
Council that discussed an October 12, 2023 inspection of the site and an
assessment that found the Jardinette Property “is in compliance with the terms
and conditions of [its] Mills Act Historical Property Contract.”  RJN Ex. G, pp. 2-3.  While staff’s report was beyond 30 days, that
does not change the fact Petitioner’s demands are moot.  Mootness is a jurisdictional issue that the
Court may address at any stage of a lawsuit’s proceedings.  Newland v. Kizer (1989) 209 Cal.App.3d
647, 657.  Dem. at 22; Reply at 7.
Petitioner responds that the City Council’s October
11, 2022 motion recognized substantial adverse changes at the Jardinette
Property. Whether the report complied with the inspection mandate of Section
50284 presents a factual dispute.  The
SAP alleges that the report ignored the City Council’s mandate of an inspection
and report on the condition of the Property, which condition was and remains
deplorable, and ignored facts showing the Mills Act Contract has been
violated.  SAP ¶¶ 96-98, 139.  Hence, the Petition alleges there is no
compliance with section 50284 and the City Council’s October 11, 2022 motion.
The demurrer seeks to resolve a factual dispute, which is improper at the
pleading stage.  Richtek USA, Inc. v.
uPI Semiconductor Corp., (2015) 242 Cal.App.4th 651, 660.  Opp. at 19.
The court need not decide the mootness issue because
Petitioner cannot enforce the Jardinette Contract.
