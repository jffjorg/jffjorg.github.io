And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering the Receiver's motion for approval of his Final Account and Report. The Receiver was appointed in June 2022 to manage the Receivership and has been working to address various issues, including the leasing arrangements, insurance coverage, and sale of the Property. The Receiver has prepared a 90-day cash flow report, negotiated the termination of Testan Law's long-term lease, and obtained a $500,000 revolving line of credit from Plaintiff Lesley. The Receiver has also marketed and sold the Property, with the court approving the sale in October 2023.

The Receiver's Final Account and Report shows that the Receivership collected total revenue of $5,809,532.45 and expended $5,265,870.75. The Receiver's professional fees, counsel fees, and CPA fees totaled $147,049.20, $120,718.03, and $34,193.88, respectively. The Receiver estimates that $492,881.70 will be distributed to the parties in accordance with their settlement.

The judge grants the Receiver's motion for approval of his Final Account and Report.
