And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the parties' submissions and is issuing a tentative ruling. The City requests judicial notice of various documents related to the Jardinette Property, including a certified agenda and audio recordings of City Council meetings. The judge grants judicial notice of these documents, but denies the City's request for judicial notice of the demurrer ruling and the reporter's transcript from that ruling.

The judge also addresses the issue of mootness, as the City argues that the fourth cause of action is moot because it took the precise action that Petitioner is requesting the court to order. The judge finds that the issue of mootness is not necessary to decide, as Petitioner cannot enforce the Jardinette Contract.

The judge notes that Petitioner argues that the City Council's October 11, 2022 motion recognized substantial adverse changes at the Jardinette Property, and that the report complied with the inspection mandate of Section 50284 presents a factual dispute. The judge finds that the demurrer seeks to resolve a factual dispute, which is improper at the pleading stage.

Finally, the judge notes that the State Resources Agency has issued regulations called "Guidelines for the California Environmental Quality Act" (Guidelines), which are contained in Code of Regulations, Title 14, Division 6, Chapter 3, beginning at section 15000. The judge finds that, as there is no project, the court need not decide whether the SAP sufficiently alleges that the City approved a project.
