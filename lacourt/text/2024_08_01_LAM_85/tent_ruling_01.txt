Lesley
F. Testan, et al. v. Susan Novell, et al., 22STCV05934


Tentative decision on motion for approval of receiver’s
final report and account:  granted



 
 
            
 
Receiver Stephen
J. Donnell (“Receiver”) moves for approval of his final account and report. 
The court has
read and considered the moving papers (no opposition was filed) and renders the
following tentative decision. 
 
A. Statement of the Case
            1. Complaint
            Plaintiff
Lesley F. Testan (“Lesley”) commenced this proceeding on February 16, 2022.  The First Amended Complaint (“FAC”)[1]
filed on April 28, 2022, alleges causes of action for (1) breach of fiduciary
duty, (2) judicial dissolution, (3) appointment of a receiver, (4) violation of
Business and Professions (“Bus. and Prof.”) Code section 17200, and (5)
declaratory relief.  The FAC alleges as
follows. 
            Defendant Testan Law (“Testan Law”)
is a civil litigation firm founded in 1996 in which Steven Testan (“Steven”)
was a partner.  In November 2013, Steven
formed TCC to acquire the Building and co-manage it with his partners in Testan
Law.  Steven had a 62% interest in TCC
and served as its Manager until his death in May 2021.
            In January 2014, Testan Law rented
60% of the Building from TCC.
            Following Steven’s death, Lesley,
his wife, inherited his 62% interest in TCC. 
Despite the TCC Operating Agreement (“Operating Agreement”) identifying Lesley
as his successor, Defendant Susan Novell, Esq. (“Novell”) has acted as Manager of
TCC despite having only 1% interest in the entity.  Novell has refused to cede the Manager role
to Lesley and has refused to provide information concerning the Building,
including whether the mortgage is being serviced.  
            Lesley has reason to believe
otherwise as of April 2022.  Lesley was
also unable to finish tax returns by the March 2022 deadline because she lacked
the necessary financial information for TCC and the Building.
            Additionally, Novell instructed
Defendant Patricia Beyer, Esq. (“Beyer”) to sign a retroactive Addendum
extending Testan Law’s lease through December 31, 2023 for a monthly rent of
$1,443.43.  The Addendum contains an
unwarranted confidentiality provision. 
As the Lease initially expired in August 2019, Novell improperly
attempted to retroactively extend the Lease by preparing this Addendum after
Steven’s death, omitting the date to hide that fact.  It is therefore void and the product of fraud.  
            Lesley
seeks (1) a decree dissolving TCC; (2) appointment of a receiver to take
possession of the Building and all other property, accounts, records, and books
of TCC, to accept all receipts, pay current debts, conduct a review of the
financial records of TCC, to report the findings to the court, and wind up and
dissolve TCC; (3) compensatory and general damages; (4) a constructive trust
concerning all assets Defendants have received collected in managing the
Building; (5) declaratory relief that Lesley has the right to be the Manager of
the Building and TCC to protect her 62% interest therein; (6) restitution of
all funds improperly retained by Novell and Testan Law; and (7) attorney’s fees
and costs.
 
            2. Course of Proceedings
            On
February 22, 2022, Lesley personally served Testan Law with the Complaint and summons.
            On
April 28, 2022, Lesley filed her FAC.
            On
May 13, 2022, Lesley served Defendant Novell with the FAC and summons.
            On
May 23, 2022, Lesley served Defendant Beyer with the FAC and summons.
            On
May 27, 2022, Lesley served Defendant Testan Law by substitute service with the
FAC and summons.
            On
November 13, 2023, the parties reached a tentative settlement through mediation.  The settlement agreement is final as of July
8, 2024 but is as yet unsigned. 
 
B. Applicable Law
Pursuant to CRC
3.1184(a), a receiver must present by noticed motion or stipulation of all
parties: (1) a final account and report; (2) a request for the discharge; and
(3) a request for exoneration of the receiver’s surety.  No memorandum is required in support of the
motion unless the court orders otherwise. 
CRC 3.1184(b).  Notice must be
given to every person or entity known to the receiver to have a substantial,
unsatisfied claim that will be affected by the order or stipulation, regardless
of whether that person or entity is a party to the action or has appeared in
it.  CRC 3.1184(c).
If any allowance
of compensation for the receiver or for an attorney employed by the receiver is
claimed in an account, it must state in detail what services have been
performed by the receiver or the attorney and whether previous allowances have
been made to the receiver or attorney, and the amounts.  CRC 3.1184(d).  
The court may
assess the costs of the receivership against the receivership property.  Andrade v. Andrade, (1932) 216 Cal.
108, 110.  The court may assess those
costs against the plaintiff if it finds that the plaintiff wrongfully obtained
an unnecessary receivership (Smith v. Hill, (1965) 237 Cal.App.2d 374,
387), and against the defendant if the plaintiff properly obtained the
appointment of a receiver and has established his or her cause of action.  Maggiora, 249 Cal.App.2d at
712-13.  The court may also apportion the
costs between the parties.  Baldwin v.
Baldwin, (12947) 82 Cal.App.2d 851, 856.
 
C. Analysis
Receiver moves for an order
approving his Final Account and Report for the management of the Receivership.  Receiver has served all persons known to have
any legal interest in the Receivership Estate. 
The Notice contained the email for Receiver’s counsel’s law firm, from
which any interested party could request a full copy of the moving papers.   No opposition was filed.
 
1. Identification and Resolution of
Issues
Upon being
appointed by the court in June 2022, Receiver began requesting and gathering
documents for a fuller understanding of the issues regarding the care and
maintenance of the Property. Donell Decl., ¶3.  Receiver discovered a complication with the
leasing arrangements on the Property that might interfere with its sale:
Defendant/Cross-Complainant Testan Law leased the entire premises from TCC for
an extended period of time, while all other tenants also leased portions of the
premises leased by Testan Law.  Donell
Decl., ¶4.  Also, Receiver discovered the
Property’s insurance coverage was about to be cancelled. Ibid.  Insurance was essential because the building
on the Property had been previously damaged by wildfire.  Donell Decl., ¶5.  There also was uncertainty as to who was
responsible for paying for things such as utilities and maintenance expenses,
and several subleases were coming up for renewal.  Donell Decl., ¶5.  Receiver retained a CPA, Brian Landau, to
assist. Ibid.
By August 2022,
the Receiver determined he needed to take control of the sale of the Property.  Donell Decl., ¶6. The litigants could not
agree on how to operate the Property, and expenses for the Property began
increasing while revenue decreased as tenant leases expired. Ibid.  Plaintiff applied ex parte to expand
the Receiver’s powers, and the court granted the application. Ibid.  Receiver also determined he would require
counsel to assist him with court filings and negotiations.  Donell Decl., ¶7.  The court approved the retention of Receiver’s
counsel, Michael Bubman, Esq., on January 4, 2023. Ibid.
Receiver
identified five issues that had to be addressed before the Property could be
sold: (1) the peculiar master lease with Testan Law and leases with other tenants,
(2) the collection of outstanding member contributions by TCC, (3) deferred and
ongoing maintenance at the Property, (4) addressing insurance issues, and (5)
determining the Property’s true value.  Donell
Decl., ¶8.
In October 2022,
Receiver prepared a 90-day cash flow report that reflected that the Property
would generate a net loss of $188,000 through December 2022, and the losses
would increase thereafter.  Donell Decl.,
¶ 9.  Receiver communicated the situation
to the parties and informed them he would need to make a capital call on the
owners or take out a loan from a third-party or one of the owners to fund the
costs of sale. Donell Decl., ¶10.
The Receiver
negotiated a termination of Testan Law’s long-term lease in exchange for a
month-to-month lease that would terminate upon the Property’s sale. Donell
Decl., ¶¶ 12-15. The remaining tenants’ leases were not renewed which, although
it was necessary to prepare the Property for sale, also exacerbated cash flow
issues. Donell Decl., ¶15.
In December
2022, the Receiver negotiated a $500,000 revolving line of credit from
Plaintiff Lesley in order to address the negative cash flow and maintain the
status quo pending a sale.  Donell Decl.,
¶¶ 17-18.
 
2. Sale of
the Property
On March 2023,
Receiver retained Chris Swatosh of Pacific Partners Commercial, Inc., to market
and sell the Property.  Donell Decl., ¶
22. The Property was on the market for 159 days, its listing viewed 43,115
times, and it was shown to 13 interested parties before three made offers.
Donell Decl., ¶ 23.  Receiver accepted an
offer for $6.3 million, and escrow opened on July 30, 2023, contingent on the
buyer’s due diligence. Ibid.
The prospective
buyer discovered that, because of the Property’s history and the increasing
costs in the California insurance market, it would cost 300% more to insure
than either party to the sale had expected. Donell Decl., ¶ 24. The buyer
terminated escrow on August 28, 2023 because of the unexpected insurance quote.
Ibid.
After the
purchase fell through, the Receivership funds were soon to be depleted and Receiver
was reluctant to take out further loans.  Donell Decl., ¶26.  Receiver’s counsel negotiated the issuance of
additional Receiver’s Certificates by stipulation of all parties.  Ibid.
The Receiver
asked Swatosh to return to the two other prospective buyers to renegotiate
their offers. Donell Decl., ¶27.  After
extensive negotiation, Receiver agreed to sell the Property to a different
buyer for $5 million, which the Receiver found consistent with market trends.  Ibid. The Receiver verified his opinion
on the Property’s value with a commercial real estate auctioneer, which
confirmed that a $5 million price was reasonable.  Donell Decl., ¶28.  On October 30, 2023, the court approved the
sale.  Donell Decl., ¶32.
 
3. Revenue
and Expenses
The Receivership
collected total revenue of $5,809,532.45 (including the $5 million sale price
for the Property) and expended $5,265,870.75.  Donell Decl., ¶¶ 34-35.  The professional fees of the Receiver, his
counsel, and his CPA totaled $147,049.20, $120,718.03, and $34,193.88,
respectively.  Donell Decl., 6.  An additional $47,500 is estimated for their
services through the close of the Receivership.  Donell Decl., ¶¶ 36-37.  Receiver also estimates that $492,881.70 will
be distributed to the parties in accordance with their settlement.  Donell Decl., ¶38.
 
D. Conclusion
The motion for approval of
Receiver’s Final Account and Report is granted.
