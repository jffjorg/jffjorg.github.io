  - "The City has a mandatory duty under section 50284 to cancel or enforce Historic Property contracts where the City Council determines the owner has breached any condition of the contract."
  - "Petitioner is informed and believes that the City has demonstrated a pattern and practice that constitutes an overarching, quasi-legislative policy of City officials to ignore and otherwise violate ministerial, mandatory duties imposed by law in connection with enforcement of Mills Act contracts."
