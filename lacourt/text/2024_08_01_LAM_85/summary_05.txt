And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is denying the application for a writ of possession by Santander Consumer USA Inc. against Khachatur Khachatryan, dba K2K Body Shop, unless Santander can demonstrate an assignment of the Vehicle through documentation presented at the hearing. The case involves a 2021 Dodge Ram 1500 that was leased to Movsesyan by Rydell Chrysler, who later assigned the lease to Santander. Movsesyan defaulted on the lease and abandoned the Vehicle, which was then taken possession of by K2K. K2K applied for a lien sale, but Santander offered to pay the maximum statutory obligation and K2K refused. The Judge finds that Santander has not shown a legal interest in the Vehicle and that the lien held by K2K is void.
