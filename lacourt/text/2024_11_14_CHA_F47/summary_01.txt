```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to set aside the default judgment. The defendant, Jessica Skinfield, claims that she did not receive notice of the request for entry of default because it was mailed to a non-existent address. However, the judge finds that the defendant failed to adequately explain how the default was entered against her as a result of her mistake, inadvertence, surprise or excusable neglect. The judge notes that the defendant was aware of the action and her need to file a response thereto as early as November 16, 2023. The judge also finds that the defendant has failed to cite any authority for the proposition that a mistake in the address where the request for entry of default was mailed to her provides grounds to set aside the default. The judge concludes that the motion is denied.
