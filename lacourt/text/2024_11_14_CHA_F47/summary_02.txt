And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case 24CHCV02702, a demurrer and motion to strike filed by defendant Magic Mountain LLC against plaintiffs Serene Fakhouri, Cassandra Fakhouri, and Reyan Fakhouri. The plaintiffs allege that they sustained injuries while riding the Riddler's Revenge roller coaster at the defendant's theme park. The defendant has filed a demurrer to the 3rd cause of action for negligent infliction of emotional distress and a motion to strike allegations regarding punitive and exemplary damages.

The judge has overruled the demurrer, finding that the plaintiffs have pleaded sufficient facts to support their claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress under a bystander theory. The judge has granted the motion to strike, but with 30 days leave to amend, giving the plaintiffs an opportunity to cure the defects in their complaint regarding punitive and exemplary damages.

The judge has also warned counsel for the parties that failure to comply with the rules of court, specifically the requirement to electronically bookmark exhibits, may result in matters being continued or sanctions being imposed.
