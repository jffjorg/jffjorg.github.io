And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the motion of counsel for defendant Jeff Kern to be relieved as counsel of record. The defendant's counsel seeks relief due to a loss of contract with the client and outstanding, unpaid bills. The client also refuses to participate or pay arbitration fees. The court finds that the motion complies with all procedural requirements and is therefore granted. The trial date remains set for November 25, 2024, and the order will not be effective until service on the client. The moving attorney is ordered to provide notice.
