And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Cross-Defendants Krohn and Ball's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings, which sought to dismiss Mary's FACC due to her death. The judge found that the court lacks jurisdiction over Mary's FACC until a personal representative is substituted in her place, but that this issue is moot since a hearing is set to substitute a personal representative. The judge also found that the other parties in the action have not been prejudiced by Mary's death, and that the court is not persuaded that the only remedy is to dismiss Mary's FACC.

The judge has granted Cross-Defendant John's Motion to Reopen Discovery for a Limited Purpose, which seeks to discover Mary's estate planning files and medical records. The judge found that John has shown that the discovery is necessary and relevant, and that Lucia and Elizabeth have failed to articulate good cause to deny the motion. The judge also noted that Lucia and Elizabeth could have filed a motion to quash or a motion for a protective order to limit discovery if they felt that John's request was duplicative, oppressive, burdensome, or irrelevant.
