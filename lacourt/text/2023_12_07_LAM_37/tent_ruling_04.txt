Background
 
On
January 31, 2023, Robert Alvarado (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint against Hood
Manufacturing (“Defendant”) and Does 1 to 5. The Complaint alleges violation of
Labor Code § 1102.5 and wrongful discharge. 
 
On
September 29, 2023, the Defendant filed a Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings.
Plaintiff filed opposing papers on November 21, 2023. Defendant filed a reply
on November 30, 2023. The matter is now before the court. 
 
motion for
judgment on the pleadings
 
I.         Legal Standard
 
“A motion for
judgment on the pleadings performs the same function as a general demurrer, and
hence attacks only defects disclosed on the face of the pleadings or by matters
that can be judicially noticed.” (Burnett v. Chimney Sweep (2004) 123
Cal.App.4th 1057, 1064.) “In deciding or reviewing a judgment on the pleadings,
all properly pleaded material facts are deemed to be true, as well as all facts
that may be implied or inferred from those expressly alleged.” (Fire Ins.
Exchange v. Superior Court (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 446, 452.) When
considering demurrers and judgment on the pleadings, courts read the
allegations liberally and in context. (Wilson v. Transit Authority of City
of Sacramento (1962) 199 Cal.App.2d 716, 720-21.) A motion for judgment on
the pleadings does not lie as to a portion of a cause of action. (Id.)
“In the case of either a demurrer or a motion for judgment on the pleadings,
leave to amend should be granted if there is any reasonable possibility that
the plaintiff can state a good cause of action.” (Gami v. Mullikin Medical
Ctr. (1993) 18 Cal.App.4th 870, 876.) A non-statutory motion for judgment
on the pleadings may be made any time before or during trial. (Stoops v.
Abbassi (2002) 100 Cal.App.4th 644, 650.)
 
II.        Discussion
 
A.        Summary
of Allegations in Plaintiff’s Complaint
 
The Complaint alleges that Defendant employed
by Plaintiff from at least September 4, 2012, to February 8, 2021, as an
outside salesperson. (Compl. ¶ 6.) On January 15, 2021, Defendant, through its
CEO, Michael Hood, demanded that Plaintiff sign an arbitration agreement and an
agreement not to compete, and a non-disparagement provision in a proposed
contract that prevent Plaintiff from disclosing working conditions. (Compl. ¶
7.) 
 
Plaintiff refused to sign the proposed
contract and informed Hood that the arbitration agreement violated Labor Code §
432.6, the non-solicitation provision was an unlawful restrain on
trade/completion because it was a covenant not to compete, and that the
non-disparagement provision may prevent Plaintiff from making lawful complaints
about any unlawful practices or work conditions that may occur in the future.
(Compl. ¶ 8.) 
 
On February 2, 2021, Defendant informed
Plaintiff that it revised the non-disparagement provision to address
Plaintiff’s concerns but refused to revise paragraphs regarding the arbitration
agreement and the covenant not to compete. (Compl. ¶ 9.) Consequently, on February
5, 2021, Plaintiff informed Defendant that he was unwilling to sign the
proposed contract because it contained provisions that violated the Labor Code
and Bus. & Prof. Code. (Compl. ¶ 10.) On February 8, 2021, Defendant
terminated Plaintiff’s employment due to Plaintiff not signing the proposed
contract. 
 
Plaintiff filed this action alleging two
causes of action: 1) violation of Labor Code § 1102.5; and 2) Wrongful
Discharge in Violation of Public Policy. Defendant now moves for a Motion for
Judgment on the Pleadings. 
 
B.        First
Cause of Action – Whistleblower Retaliation in Violation of 
Labor Code § 1102.5
 
To establish a prima facie case of
retaliation under Labor Code § 1102.5, “a plaintiff must show that (1) he
engaged in a protected activity, (2) his employer subjected him to an adverse
employment action, and (3) there is a causal connection between the two.” (Mokler
v. County of Orange (2007) 157 Cal.App.4th 121, 138.)
 
Labor Code § 1102.5 only requires that
the employee disclose information the employee reasonably believed disclosed
unlawful activity, whether it be to the government or law enforcement agent
“and to people with authority over him which he reasonably believed disclosed a
violation of or noncompliance with federal and state law applicable to criminal
prosecutions and prosecutors.” (Ross v. County of Riverside (2019)
36 Cal.App.5th 580, 592–593.)
 
Defendant argues that Plaintiff’s first
cause of action fails because Plaintiff did not objectively believe the
proposed contract with the arbitration agreement violated Labor Code § 432.6. 
 
But
the protections of section 1102.5(b) apply only where the disclosing employee
‘has reasonable cause to believe that the
information discloses a [legal] violation.’ [Citation] This clause imposes a
requirement of objective reasonableness and excludes from whistleblower
protection disclosures that involve only disagreements over discretionary
decisions, policy choices, interpersonal dynamics, or other nonactionable
issues. 
 
People ex rel. Garcia-Brower v. Kolla's, Inc. (2023) 14 Cal.5th 719, 734. The court finds that the
Complaint sufficiently alleges that Plaintiff had reasonable cause to believe
that signing the proposed contract, which contained an arbitration provision,
gave Plaintiff reasonable cause to believe, at that time, that the proposed
contract was unlawful, and that Plaintiff engaged in a protected activity by
telling Michael Hood, a person with authority over him, that the proposed
contract violated a statute. (Compl. ¶ 14.) 
 
Second, Defendant asserts that the allegation in the Complaint
that the non-solicitation provision in the proposed contract that Plaintiff
believed to be unlawful cannot support a whistleblower retaliation claim under
Labor Code § 1102.5 because such a violation would render the contract void,
not unlawful. 
 
Bus. & Prof. Code § 16600 states: 
 
Except as provided in this
chapter, every contract by which anyone is restrained from engaging in a lawful
profession, trade, or business of any kind is to that extent void.


Defendant’s argument that a whistleblower
retaliation claim cannot be premised on a belief that the contract violates
Bus. & Prof. Code § 16600 is without merit. 
The reason that the contract is void is because it is “an unlawful
restraint on trade.” (FLIR Systems, Inc. v. Parrish (2009)
174 Cal.App.4th 1270, 1281.) As the Complaint states sufficient facts to
support a claim for whistleblower retaliation, the motion as to the first cause
of action is denied.  
 
            C.        Second Cause of Action- Wrongful
Discharge in Violation of Public Policy 
 
“The elements of a
claim for wrongful discharge in violation of public policy are (1) an
employer-employee relationship, (2) the employer terminated the plaintiff’s
employment, (3) the termination was substantially motivated by a violation of
public policy, and (4) the discharge caused the plaintiff harm.” (Yau v.
Allen (2014) 229 Cal.App.4th 144, 154.) 
 
Defendant asserts
that Plaintiff’s second cause of action fails because Plaintiff’s informing
Michael Hood that the proposed contract violated a statute e and refusing to
sign the proposed contract was not a protected activity. The court is not
persuaded by this argument. Nor does Defendant cite case law to support its
proposition. 
 
Plaintiff is not a
lawyer, and Plaintiff had no way of knowing that the arbitration provision was
“clearly lawful” and that sometime later, a federal court would enjoin
enforcement of Labor Code § 432.6. Plaintiff also had no way of knowing at the
time that he refused to sign the proposed contract that if the contract did in
fact violate Bus. & Prof. Code § 1600, the contract would be void and
unenforceable. Moreover, Defendant ignores the fact that Plaintiff also alleged
that he refused to sign the proposed contract because he believed the
non-disparagement provision prevented Plaintiff from disclosing work
conditions, in violation of state law. (Compl. ¶ 7.) 
 
We
hold an employer cannot lawfully make the signing of an employment agreement,
which contains an unenforceable covenant not to compete, a condition of
continued employment, even if such agreement contains choice of law or
severability provisions which would enable the employer to enforce the other
provisions of the employment agreement. We further hold that an employer's
termination of an employee who refuses to sign such an agreement constitutes a
wrongful termination in violation of public policy. 


(D'sa v. Playhut, Inc. (2000) 85 Cal.App.4th 927, 929.) 
 
The court finds that the Complaint
sufficiently pleads a cause of action for wrongful discharge in violation of
public policy. Defendant’s motion for judgment on the pleadings is denied.  
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant’s motion for judgment on the pleadings
is denied. Defendant to give notice.
