Background
 
This
is a family dispute arising in connection with real property located at 336
Flintridge Oaks Drive, La Canada-Flintridge, California, 91011 (the
“Property”). Plaintiff Lucia Early (“Lucia”) alleges that she is the sister of
Defendant John D. Early (“John”) and that both, in addition to Elizabeth V.
Early (“Elizabeth”) are the surviving children of Mary C. Early (“Mary”) Mary
was born on October 2, 1930, and thus, allegedly qualifies as an elder for
purposes of the Elder and Dependent Adult Protection Act. 
 
Lucia
alleges that on or about March 16, 2006, Mary, as the trustee of the Mary C.
Early Trust dated December 14, 2005 (the “Trust”), took title to the Property and
later restated the Trust to provide equally for her three children. Lucia
alleges that despite Mary’s actions, John successfully demanded that she amend
her Trust to exclude Lucia and transfer substantially all of the interest in
the Property to him. Thereafter, John allegedly removed Mary from the Property to
live with relatives in Missouri, despite alleged assurances that Mary would be
allowed to live in the Property for life.¿¿
 
Lucia’s Complaint, filed May 5, 2020, alleges six causes of
action: (1) interference with expected inheritance against John, (2) fraud
against John, (3) fraud against John, (4) constructive fraud against John, (5)
injunction against John, and (6) restitution against John.
 
On
August 19, 2020, the court deemed this action related to John D. Early v.
Lucia C. Early (LASC Case No. 20GDCV00556) (the “Related Action”), with
this action deemed the lead case.  John’s
Complaint in the related action alleges seven causes of action: (1) intentional
interference with contractual relations, (2) intentional interference with
prospective economic relations, (3) breach of contract, (4) partition by
appraisal of real property, (5) partition by sale of real property, (6) specific
performance, and (7) declaratory relief.¿¿ 
 
On March 23, 2021, Lucia and Elizabeth
(“Cross-Complainants”) filed the operative First Amended Cross-Complaint
(“FACC”) in the Related Action. The FACC alleges eight causes of action: (1)
battery, (2) conversion, (3) statutory violation – theft, (4) elder abuse, (5)
conversion, (6) statutory violation – theft, (7) restitution, (8) quiet title,
(9) defamation. On March 24, 2021, the court consolidated the Related Action with
this action.¿ 
 
On
December 4, 2020, Lucia filed the First Amended Complaint. The FAC alleges the
same causes of action as the Complaint.¿¿On April 27, 2021, John’s demurrer to Lucia’s FAC was sustained with 30
days leave to amend.¿ On August 3, 2021, the court granted John’s
Ex Parte Application for an Order dismissing Lucia’s First Amended Complaint
for failure to amend.¿¿ 
 
On
October 5, 2021, Mary filed the First Amended Cross-Complaint (“FACC”) against
John, William S. Welch (“Welch”) , Samuel P. Andress, Andress Real Estate
Enterprise dba Ethos Advisors, Joey D. Ball (“Ball”), David Krohn (“Krohn”),
and Roes 1 to 50. The FACC alleges eight causes of action: (1) Conversion; (2)
Statutory Violation of Penal Code § 496(a) as to Cross-Defendant John; (3)
Statutory Violation of Wel. & Inst. Code §§ 15610.07 and 15610.30(a) as to
Cross-Defendant Welch; (4) Restitution; (5) Quiet Title; (6) Quiet Title; (7)
Declaratory relief as to Cross-Defendants Andress Real Estate Enterprise; (7)
Declaratory Relief as to Cross-Defendants Krohn and Ball; and (8) Accounting. 
 
On
September 30, 2022, Cross-Complainants Krohn and Ball filed their
Cross-Complaint against Mary as an individual, and as trustee of the Mary C.
Early Trust, as well as against John.  The First Amended
Cross-Complaint, filed January 19, 2023, alleges two causes of action: (1)
Specific Performance for Breach of Contract to Sell Real Property; and (2)
Damages for Breach of Contract. 
 
On
November 8, 2022, the court sustained Mary’s motion for judgment on the
pleadings as to causes of action 3, 4, and 6 of John’s complaint with leave to
amend. On December 12, 2022, John filed his First Amended Complaint alleging:
(1) intentional interference with contractual relations; (2) intentional
interference with prospective economic relations; (3) breach of contract; (4)
partition by sale of real property; (5) specific performance; and (6)
declaratory relief.¿¿
 
On March 9, 2023, Defendant/Cross-Complainant
John Stroh (“Stroh”) filed his Cross-Complaint against Cross-Defendants John,
Tetyana Early, and William S. Welch for (1) trespass against John, (2) trespass
to chattels against John, (3) trespass to chattels against John, Tetyana Early,
and William S. Welch, and (4) defamation against William S. Welch. On May
18, 2023, the court dismissed Stroh’s Cross-Complaint for forum non
conveniens.  
 
On
October 30, 2023, Cross-Defendants Krohn and Ball filed a Motion for Judgment
on the Pleadings as to Mary’s FACC.  Cross-Defendant
John filed a Joiner to this motion. Mary filed opposing papers on November 16,
2023. John filed a reply in support of his joiner on November 21, 2023. 
 
On
October 30, 2023, John filed a Motion for an Order to Reopen Discovery. On
November 30, 2023, Lucia and Elizabeth, and Elizabeth Early as the personal
representative of Mary’s estate, filed opposing papers to John’s request to
reopen the discovery. John filed a reply on December 1, 2023. 
 
The
court will now consider Krohn and Ball’s motion for judgment on the pleadings
and John’s motion to reopen discovery.  
 
motion for
judgment on the pleadings[1]
 
I.               
Legal Standard
 
A motion for judgment on the pleadings is the
functional equivalent to a general demurrer. (Lance Camper Mfg. Corp. v.
Republic Indemnity Co. of Am. (1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 194, 198.) Like
demurrers, motions for judgment on the pleadings challenge the legal
sufficiency of the allegations, not their veracity. (Donabedian v. Mercury
Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) 
 
II.        Request for Judicial Notice
 
The Court may take judicial notice of records of
any court of record of the United States. (Evid. Code, § 452(d)(2).) The court
may only judicially notice the existence of the record, not that its contents
are the truth. (Sosinsky v. Grant (1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 1548,
1565.) 
 
Cross-Defendants request judicial notice of the
following: 
 
Exhibit 1
- Minute Order filed in this action on March 16, 2023. 
 
Exhibit 2
- Petition for Probate filed in Estate Of Mary Celeste Early, Los
Angeles Superior Court, Case Number 23STPB06795 on June 20, 2023; 3. 
 
Exhibit 3
- Minute Order filed in Estate Of Mary Celeste Early, Los Angeles
Superior Court, Case Number 23STPB06795 on August 15, 2023; 4. 
 
Exhibit 4
- Order for Probate filed in Estate Of Mary Celeste Early, Los Angeles
Superior Court, Case Number 23STPB06795 on August 23, 2023.
 
Cross-Defendants’ request for judicial notice is
granted. 
 
John D. Early’s request for judicial notice of
the following: 
 
Exhibit 1, Exhibit 2,
Exhibit 3, Exhibit 4 and Exhibit 5. Exhibit 3 establishes that Mary died on
February 11, 2023, and Exhibit 4 and Exhibit 5 establish that there was a
probate matter for Mary’s estate and that Elizabeth was appointed as personal
representative.
 
(Joiner
at p. 6:14-17.) 
 
1)    
The Minute Order filed in this action
on March 16, 2023, a true and correct copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit
1.
 
2)    
The Petition for Probate filed in the
matter of the Estate of Mary Celeste Early, Los Angeles Superior Court, Case
Number 23STPB06795 on June 20, 2023, a true and correct copy of which is
attached hereto as Exhibit 2. 
 
3)    
The Order for Probate filed in the
matter of the Estate of Mary Celeste Early, Los Angeles Superior Court, Case
Number 23STPB06795 on August 23, 2023, a true and correct copy of which is
attached hereto as Exhibit 3
 
John
fails to state what Exhibits 4 and 5 are in his request for judicial notice.
Therefore, John’s request for judicial notice is granted as to Exhibits 1 to 3
and denied as to Exhibits 4 and 5. 
 
II.        Discussion
 
Cross-Defendants
Krohn and Ball move for an order granting Judgment on the Pleadings as to Mary’s
FACC on the basis that she died on February 11, 2023, and no personal
representative has been substituted in her place in the FACC. 
 
The
court agrees that until there is a substitution of a personal representative in
Mary’s place, the court lacks jurisdiction. (Pham v. Wagner Litho Machinery
Co. (1985) 172 Cal.App.3d 966, 971 (Pham).) In Herring v. Peterson (1981) 116 Cal.App.3d 608, 612 (Herring),
the appellate court held that upon the death of a defendant, the trial
court could take no action without someone to defend the case and that its
order of dismissal was in excess of its jurisdiction and void.
 
Neither
Pham nor Herring support Cross-Defendants’ proposition that this
action must be dismissed because a personal representative for Mary has been
substituted in her place.  According to
the legal authorities cited by Cross-Defendants, the court lacks jurisdiction
over Mary’s FACC and any order dismissing the FACC would be voidable. Moreover,
as a hearing is set to substitute a personal representative in the place of
Mary, the grounds for dismissing the FACC would be moot. Furthermore, given
that no trial date is currently set, the court is not persuaded that the other
parties in this action have been so prejudiced that the only remedy is to
dismiss Mary’s FACC. 
 
Therefore,
the court denies Cross-Defendants’ Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings. 
 
As
to John’s claim that Mary’s counsel improperly filed an Answer after Mary
passed away, this matter is not before the court.  The court declines to rule on whether the
Answer was properly filed. John’s notice of joiner gave no notice that John
also sought judgment on the pleadings as to Mary’s Answer. 


motion to
reopen discovery for a limited purpose[2]
 
I.         Legal Standard
 
“On motion of any party, the court
may grant leave to complete discovery proceedings, or to have a motion
concerning discovery heard, closer to the initial trial date, or to reopen
discovery after a new trial date has been set.¿ This motion shall be accompanied
by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040.”¿(CCP, §
2024.050(a).)¿ 
 
“In exercising its discretion to
grant or deny this motion, the court shall take into consideration any matter
relevant to the leave requested, including, but not limited to, the following:
(1) The necessity and the reasons for the discovery.¿ (2) The diligence or lack
of diligence of the party seeking the discovery or the hearing of a discovery
motion, and the reasons that the discovery was not completed or that the
discovery motion was not heard earlier.¿ (3) Any likelihood that permitting the
discovery or hearing the discovery motion will prevent the case from going to
trial on the date set, or otherwise interfere with the trial calendar, or
result in prejudice to any other party.¿ (4) The length of time that has
elapsed between any date previously set, and the date presently set, for the
trial of the action.”¿ (CCP § 2024.050(b)(1)-(4).)¿¿¿ 
 
“The court shall impose a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party,
person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to extend or
to reopen discovery, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust.”¿ (CCP § 2024.050(c).)¿¿¿ 
 
II.        Discussion
 
Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant John seeks
an order to reopen discovery in this matter for the limited purpose of
requesting the estate planning files and medical records of Mary.
 
The original discovery cutoff date
was on or about August 5, 2022, and discovery into these matters was not
possible because at the time Mary was still alive; her estate planning file and
post-discovery cutoff medical files were not discoverable until after her
death. Moreover, access to Mary’s estate planning files was also not possible
due to attorney-client privilege, which was extinguished upon Mary’s death. 
 
John asserts that access to Mary’s
estate planning files and medical records are necessary for John to prepare for
trial because Mary’s state of mind and her testamentary and contractual
capacity are highly relevant.
 
Lucia and Elizabeth Early oppose
the Motion on the basis that until a personal representative for Mary Early is
appointed, any action would be void. However, the rule is that any judgment,
rather than any court order or proceeding, is void if obtained without the
substitution of a personal representative for the deceased plaintiff. (Pham
v. Wagner Litho Machinery Co. (1985) 172 Cal.App.3d 966, 971; Sacks v.
FSR Brokerage, Inc. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 950, 957 [“A long line of cases
has therefore allowed direct attack upon a judgment obtained without
substitution of a personal representative after a party has died”].) 
 
Here, the court is not rendering a
judgment but reopening discovery. The rule prohibiting judgment against a
deceased party is that “the interests of the estate of the decedent [are] not
represented.” (Sacks, supra, 7 Cal.App.4th at p. 958.) Here,
Lucia and Elizabeth fail to show how the interest of Mary’s estate is not being
represented by permitting discovery into her contractual and testamentary
capacity, as well as her medical records. 
 
Furthermore, for purposes of this
Motion, it is immaterial that John already had the opportunity to attend the
deposition of the individuals who prepared Mary’s estate planning, or access to
the declaration of Mary’s doctors, because the right to discovery is not
limited. “[A]ny party may obtain discovery regarding any matter, not
privileged, that is relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending
action ... if the matter either is itself admissible in evidence or appears
reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.” (CCP, §
2017.010; see Davies v. Superior Court (1984) 36 Cal.3d 291, 301, 204
[“discovery is not limited to admissible evidence”].)
 
If Lucia and Elizabeth feel that
John’s request for discovery is duplicative, oppressive, burdensome, or
irrelevant, the proper course of action is to file a motion to quash or a
motion for a protective order to limit discovery. 
 
As John has shown that this motion
is necessary and the discovery sought relevant, and Lucia and Elizabeth have
failed to articulate good cause as to why this Motion should be denied, the
court grants John’s Motion. 
 
Conclusion
 
The court denies Cross-Defendants Krohn and Ball’s Motion for
Judgment on the Pleadings.
 
The court grants Cross-Defendant
John’s Motion for an Order to Reopen Discovery for a Limited Purpose.
 
Moving parties to give notice.
