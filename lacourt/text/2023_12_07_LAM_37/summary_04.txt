And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings in the case of Robert Alvarado v. Hood Manufacturing, Inc. The plaintiff, Alvarado, alleges that the defendant terminated his employment in violation of Labor Code § 1102.5 and public policy.

The defendant argued that the plaintiff's first cause of action for whistleblower retaliation fails because the plaintiff did not objectively believe that the proposed contract with the arbitration agreement violated Labor Code § 432.6. However, the court found that the complaint sufficiently alleges that the plaintiff had reasonable cause to believe that signing the proposed contract was unlawful.

The defendant also argued that the plaintiff's second cause of action for wrongful discharge in violation of public policy fails because the plaintiff's refusal to sign the proposed contract was not a protected activity. However, the court found that the complaint sufficiently pleads a cause of action for wrongful discharge in violation of public policy.

The judge's ruling is based on the allegations in the complaint and the relevant law. The defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings is denied, and the case will proceed to trial.
