Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has sustained the demurrer to the Second Amended Cross-Complaint (SACC) with leave to amend as to the second, third, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth causes of action. The court has sustained the demurrer without leave to amend as to the eleventh cause of action. The plaintiff is granted 30 days' leave to amend. The court sets the OSC RE: Amended Complaint for a date and time, and the Cross-Defendants are ordered to give notice.

The court's decision is based on the pleadings and the applicable law. The court finds that the SACC fails to allege specific facts as to how the Cross-Defendants represented to the Cross-Complainants that they would operate the business in a "diligent and honest manner." The court also finds that the SACC fails to allege that the Cross-Defendants embezzled funds from the business, and that the Cross-Complainants do not have a possessory right to the funds. The court sustains the demurrer to the fifth and sixth causes of action on the basis that the Cross-Complainants have no legal right to the funds allegedly embezzled. The court sustains the demurrer to the seventh, eighth, and ninth causes of action on the basis that the Cross-Complainants fail to allege that the Cross-Defendants had knowledge of an economic or contractual relationship between the Cross-Complainants and any third party.
