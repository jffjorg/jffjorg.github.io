And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling is a response to a demurrer filed by the defendants, The Regents of the University of California and Myo Nyunt, to dismiss the plaintiff's claims of employment discrimination and harassment. The plaintiff, Cecibel Rodriguez, alleges that she was subjected to disability discrimination and harassment by her employer, including being told that she was not suitable for a job due to her disability and being forced to take a leave of absence and being subjected to further harassment and discrimination upon her return to work.

The court finds that the plaintiff has sufficiently alleged a continuing violation of disability discrimination from 2019 to 2021, and that the defendants failed to engage in a good faith process with the plaintiff to determine any reasonable accommodation. The court also finds that the plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts to support her claim for reasonable accommodation.

However, the court sustains the demurrer as to the plaintiff's claims of sex discrimination and harassment, finding that there is an unexplained gap in the allegations that does not support application of the continuing violation doctrine. The court also finds that the defendants did not have a duty to find the plaintiff a new position where she could not perform the essential functions of her job.

Overall, the tentative ruling is a mixed decision, with the court finding in favor of the plaintiff on some claims and against her on others. The ruling is subject to change pending further argument and evidence.
