Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the motion to tax costs submitted by the plaintiff. The plaintiff had sought to strike or tax $1335.70 in costs related to motion and filing fees, electronic filing fees, service fees, and electronic document hosting fees. The judge finds that these costs are reasonably necessary and recoverable under California Civil Procedure section 1033.5. The judge also disagrees with the plaintiff's argument that deposition costs should be prorated among the defendants, finding that the costs were incurred to benefit the prevailing party and that there is no rule requiring proration. The judge notes that the law firm's cost bill does not include costs that were set forth in Integon's bill, and therefore there is no double counting.
