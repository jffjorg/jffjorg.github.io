And here is a summary in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel further responses to Special Interrogatories filed by Plaintiff, Compound Development LLC. The motion seeks to compel Defendants, Jay William Smith and David M. Robinson, to provide additional responses to the interrogatories, which seek financial information related to the legal fees paid by Plaintiff.

The Court has granted the motion in part, ordering Defendants to provide further code-compliant responses to the subject interrogatories within 30 days. The Court has also imposed sanctions against each Defendant in the amount of $750.00.

The Court has found that Plaintiff's allegations of fraud, violation of Business & Professions Code § 17200, breach of fiduciary duty, and negligent misrepresentation are sufficient to support the discovery requests. The Court has also struck down Defendants' objections to the interrogatories, finding that they are without merit.

The case involves a legal malpractice action, where Plaintiff alleges that Defendants failed to respond to discovery requests and concealed the fact that Defendant Robinson is a disbarred attorney. Plaintiff is seeking damages of $7,500.00, $30,000.00, and $100,000.00, respectively, for the alleged harm caused by Defendants' actions.
