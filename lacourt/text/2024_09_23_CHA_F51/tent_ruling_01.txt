ANALYSIS
 
This is a contract action in which Plaintiff alleges that he
purchased certain real property located at 27716 Lakehurst Avenue, Santa
Clarita CA, which included a solar panel lease from Defendants. (Compl. ¶¶ 8,
11.) Plaintiff alleges that Moving Defendant is the CEO of nonmoving defendant
Solar Service Experts, LLC. (Id. at ¶ 4.) Plaintiff alleges that
Defendants defrauded Plaintiff by overcharging him for electrical utilities
without adequate explanation, and “to date, the Plaintiff does not have a copy
of the contract lease agreement for his property.” (Id. at ¶¶ 9–17.)
 
On 1/29/24, Plaintiff filed his complaint against Defendants,
alleging the following causes of action: (1) Breach of Contract Agreement; (2)
Fraudulent Misrepresentation; (3) Breach of the Implied Covenant of Good Faith
and Fair Dealing; and (4) Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress.
 
On 5/23/24, Moving Defendant filed the instant demurrer and
motion to strike. No oppositions have been filed to date. On 9/16/24, Moving
Defendant filed a notice of non-opposition to his demurrer and motion to strike.
//
//
ANALYSIS
 
As a general matter,
a party may respond to a pleading against it by demurrer on the basis of any
single or combination of eight enumerated grounds, including that “the pleading
does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e).) In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be
apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice.¿(Donabedian
v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)¿
 
“A demurrer tests
the pleading alone, and not the evidence or facts alleged.” (E-Fab, Inc.
v. Accountants, Inc. Servs. (2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 1308, 1315.) As such,
the court assumes the truth of the complaint’s properly pleaded or implied
factual allegations. (Ibid.) The only issue a demurrer is concerned with
is whether the complaint, as it stands, states a cause of action. (Hahn v.
Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) 
 
Here, Moving Defendant demurs
against Plaintiff’s entire complaint, arguing that Plaintiff fails to allege
facts sufficient to state any of the causes of action contained therein.
 
A.   
Meet
and Confer
 
Before filing its
demurrer, “the demurring party shall meet and confer in person or by telephone
with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the
purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve
the objections to be raised in the demurrer.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 430.41, subd.
(a).) The demurring
party must file and serve a meet and confer declaration stating either: “(A)
The means by which the demurring party met and conferred with the party who
filed the pleading subject to demurrer, and that the parties did not reach an
agreement resolving the objections raised in the demurrer;” or “(B) That the
party who filed the pleading subject to demurrer failed to respond to the meet
and confer request of the demurring party or otherwise failed to meet and
confer in good faith.” (Id. at subd. (a)(3).)
 
Here, Moving
Defendant’s counsel declares that on 4/30/24, she sent Plaintiff a letter discussing
the issues raised in the instant demurrer and motion to strike. (Decl. of McKenzie
N. Hardy ¶ 2.) On 5/3/24 and 5/6/24, Moving Defendant’s attorney met and
conferred with Plaintiff, but the parties were unable to come to a resolution.
(Id. at ¶¶ 3–4.) Accordingly, the Court finds that counsel has satisfied the preliminary meet
and confer requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41, subdivision
(a).
 
B.    
Breach
of Contract
 
Plaintiff’s first cause of
action alleges against all defendants Breach of Contract Agreement. To state a
cause of action for breach of contract, a plaintiff must be able to establish
“(1) the existence of the contract, (2) plaintiff’s performance or excuse for
nonperformance, (3) defendant’s breach, and (4) the resulting damages to the
plaintiff.” (Oasis West Realty, LLC v. Goldman (2011) 51 Cal.4th 811,
821.) A written contract may be pleaded either verbatim or generally “according
to its legal intendment and effect.” (Construction Protective Services, Inc.
v. TIG Specialty Ins. Co. (2002) 29 Cal.4th 189, 198–199.)
 
Here, Plaintiff has attached a
copy of the subject agreement to his complaint. (Ex. 1 to Compl.) However, as
Moving Defendant observes, the parties to the original agreement are “Hazel
Adkins and Tredegar Solar Fund 1, LLC and is dated November 2013. The related
Transfer of Solar Agreement is between Hazel Adkins, Plaintiff Jose Miguel
Ramos Barahona, and Tredegar Solar Fund 1, LLC. Plaintiff signed the Transfer
of Solar Agreement on October 19, 2021, and thus became a party to the SPA.”
(Dem. 1:11–13, citing Ex. 1 to Compl.) Moving Defendant therefore argues that he
“is not a party to or even mentioned in the contract Plaintiff attached to his
Complaint which is accepted as true for purposes of demurrer.” (Id. at 3:21–22.)
Moving Defendant further argues that “even if SSE did have a contract with
Plaintiff, Mr. Fong cannot be held personally liable for SSE’s obligations.” (Id.
at 3:27–28, citing Corp. Code § 17703.04, subd. (a).)
 
The Court
notes that Plaintiff has not filed any opposition to Moving Defendant’s
demurrer. Based on the foregoing, the Court finds that Plaintiff has failed to
allege the existence of a written contract between himself and Moving Defendant,
and his own performance or excuse for nonperformance thereunder, and therefore
has failed to allege facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action for
Breach of Contract. Accordingly, the demurrer is sustained as to Plaintiff’s
first cause of action.
 
C.   
Fraudulent
Misrepresentation
 
Plaintiff’s second cause of
action alleges Fraudulent Misrepresentation against Defendants. “One who
willfully deceives another with intent to induce him to alter his position to
his injury or risk, is liable for any damage which he thereby suffers.” (Civ.
Code § 1709.) The elements that must be pleaded in a cause of action for fraud
are: (1) a misrepresentation (false representation, concealment or
nondisclosure); (2) knowledge of its falsity (or “scienter”); (3) intent to
defraud (i.e., to induce reliance); (4) justifiable reliance; and (5) resulting
damage. (Philipson & Simon v. Gulsvig (2007) 154 Cal.App.4th 347,
363.) Fairness requires that allegations of fraud be pled “with particularity”
so that the court can weed out nonmeritorious actions before a defendant is
required to answer. (Small v. Fritz Companies, Inc. (2003) 30 Cal.4th
167, 184.) The particularity requirement necessitates pleading facts that “show
how, when, where, to whom, and by what means the representations were
tendered.” (Lazar v. Superior Court (1996) 12 Cal.4th 631, 645.)
 
Here, Plaintiff details his
alleged communications with Defendants from September 2021 through March 2022,
alleging that Defendants were evasive and unhelpful in explaining the amounts
charged on Plaintiff’s electric bills. (Compl. ¶¶ 9–16.) Plaintiff further
alleges that “Defendants fraudulently misrepresented to Plaintiff and failed to
justify the details of the contract lease agreement,” that “Defendants knew
that these representations were false and made such representations to deceive
and defraud Plaintiff and to induce Plaintiff to act in reliance upon these
representations.” (Id. at ¶¶ 23–24.) “As a direct and proximate result
of Defendants’ fraudulent misrepresentations, Plaintiff has suffered damages,
legal fees, costs, expenses, and his credit ruined.” (Id. at ¶ 25.)
 
Moving Defendant argues that
Plaintiff’s allegations “are not specific enough to state a claim for
fraud and do not go to each element necessary.” (Dem. 5:1–2.) “From these facts
alone, it is unclear who actually made any fraudulent misrepresentations to
Plaintiff and when they were made.” (Id. at 4:3–4.) “Importantly,
Plaintiff does not state facts to support the conclusion that Mr. Fong made a
misrepresentation to Plaintiff, that Mr. Fong knew it was false, and that Mr.
Fong intended to induce Plaintiff’s reliance on that misrepresentation.” (Id.
at 4:7–9.) The Court agrees, and finds that Plaintiff’s allegations fail to
clearly state any alleged misrepresentations made by Moving Defendant.
 
Based on
the foregoing, has failed to allege facts sufficient to constitute a cause of
action for Fraudulent Misrepresentation. Accordingly, the demurrer is sustained
as to Plaintiff’s second cause of action.
 
D.   
Breach
of the Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing
 
Plaintiff’s third cause of
action alleges against Defendants a breach of the implied covenant of good
faith and fair dealing with respect to the services agreement. Every contract
contains an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing that neither party
will do anything to interfere with the other party’s right to receive the
benefits of the agreement. (Howard v. American Nat'l Fire Ins. Co.
(2010) 187 Cal.App.4th 498, 528.) The precise nature and extent of the duty
depends on the nature and purpose of the underlying contract and the parties’
legitimate expectations arising from the contract. (Ibid.) “A breach of
the implied covenant of good faith is a breach of the contract … and breach of
a specific provision of the contract is not ... necessary to a claim for breach
of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.” (Thrifty Payless,
Inc. v. The Americana at Brand, LLC (2013) 218 Cal.App.4th 1230, 1244.)
 
However, “if the allegations [of
breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing] do not go beyond the
statement of a mere contract breach and, relying on the same alleged acts,
simply seek the same damages or other relief already claimed in a companion
contract cause of action, they may be disregarded as superfluous as no
additional claim is actually stated.” (Careau & Co. v. Security Pacific
Business Credit, Inc. (1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 1371, 1395.)
 
Here, Plaintiff alleges that
Defendants breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing by
“engaging in action purposefully aligned at frustrating and wrongfully
overbilling services for solar panels to Plaintiff, or that Defendants promised
to procure on his behalf.” (Compl. ¶ 29.) Moving Defendant argues that “as Mr.
Fong is not a party to the underlying contract allegedly breached, the covenant
cannot impose any obligations on him and thus this cause of action is
inapplicable.” (Dem. 5:22–23.)
 
The Court agrees, and finds that
to the extent that Plaintiff’s third cause of action derives from his defective
cause of action for Breach of Contract, it likewise fails. Accordingly, the
demurrer is sustained against Plaintiff’s third cause of action.
 
E.    
Intentional
Infliction of Emotional Distress
 
Plaintiff’s fourth cause of
action alleges Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress against Defendant.
“The elements of a prima facie case for the tort of intentional infliction of
emotional distress are: (1) extreme and outrageous conduct by the defendant
with the intention of causing, or reckless disregard of the probability of
causing, emotional distress; (2) the plaintiff’s suffering severe or extreme
emotional distress; and (3) actual and proximate causation of the emotional
distress by the defendant’s outrageous conduct. Conduct to be outrageous must
be so extreme as to exceed all bounds of that usually tolerated in a civilized
community.” (Wilson v. Hynek (2012) 207 Cal.App.4th 999, 1009.) A mere
allegation that a plaintiff suffered severe emotional distress, without facts
indicating the nature or extent of any mental suffering incurred as a result of
the defendant’s alleged outrageous conduct, does not state a cause of action
for intentional infliction of emotional distress. (Pitman v. City of Oakland
(1988) 197 Cal.App.3d 1037, 1047–1048.)
 
Here, Moving Defendant argues
that Plaintiffs’ allegations do not rise to the requisite level of
outrageousness to support a cause of action for intentional infliction of
emotional distress because “it is unclear who exactly damaged his credit, how
they did it, or when it occurred. Moreover, there are no facts to support any
outrageous and intentional conduct by Mr. Fong.” (Dem. 7:13–15.) The Court
agrees, noting that the only factual allegation mentioning Moving Defendant
states that “Defendant, Christian Fong who is CEO, need to have a better
training staff on how to communicate with customers.” (Compl. ¶ 16.)
 
Based on the foregoing, the
Court finds that Plaintiff has failed to allege facts sufficient to state a
cause of action for Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress against Moving
Defendant. Accordingly, the demurrer is sustained against Plaintiff’s fourth
cause of action.
 
MOTION TO STRIKE 
 
The court may, upon a motion, or
at any time in its discretion, and upon terms it deems proper, strike any
irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 436, subd. (a).) The court may also strike all or any part of any
pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a court
rule, or an order of the court. (Id., § 436, subd. (b).) The grounds for
moving to strike must appear on the face of the pleading or by way of judicial
notice. (Id., § 437.) 
 
A.   
Meet-and-Confer

 
“Before filing a motion to
strike pursuant to this chapter, the moving party shall meet and confer in person
or by telephone with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to the
motion to strike for the purpose of determining if an agreement can be reached
that resolves the objections to be raised in the motion to strike.” (Code Civ.
Proc. § 435.5, subd. (a).)
 
Here, as previously mentioned, Moving Defendant’s counsel declares that on 4/30/24, she
sent Plaintiff a letter discussing the issues raised in the instant demurrer
and motion to strike. (Hardy Decl. ¶ 2.) On 5/3/24 and 5/6/24, Moving
Defendant’s attorney met and conferred with Plaintiff, but the parties were
unable to come to a resolution. (Id. at ¶¶ 3–4.) Therefore,
counsel has satisfied the preliminary meet and confer requirements of Code of
Civil Procedure section 435.5, subdivision (a). 
 
B.    
Punitive
Damages
 
Punitive damages may be
recovered upon a proper showing of malice, fraud, or oppression by clear and
convincing evidence. (Civ. Code § 3294, subd. (a).) “Malice” is defined as
conduct intended to cause injury to a person or despicable conduct carried on with
a willful and conscious disregard for the rights or safety of others. (Id.
at subd. (c); Turman v. Turning Point of Cent. Cal., Inc. (2010) 191
Cal.App.4th 53, 63.) “Oppression” means despicable conduct subjecting a person
to cruel and unjust hardship, in conscious disregard of the person’s rights. (Ibid.)
“Fraud” is an intentional misrepresentation, deceit, or concealment of a
material fact known by defendant, with intent to deprive a person of property,
rights or otherwise cause injury. (Ibid.)
 
Punitive damages must be
supported by factual allegations. Conclusory allegations, devoid of any factual
assertions, are insufficient to support a conclusion that parties acted with
oppression, fraud or malice. (Smith v. Superior Court (1992) 10
Cal.App.4th 1033, 1042; Anschutz Entertainment Group, Inc. v. Snepp
(2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 598, 643.)
 
1.     
Breach
of Contract
 
Punitive damages are not
recoverable in contract actions. (Civ. Code § 3294, subd. (a).) As a
preliminary matter, Moving Defendant correctly observes that Plaintiff’s prayer
for punitive damages in connection with his first cause of action for Breach of
Contract must be stricken. Accordingly, the Court grants the motion to strike
page 8, lines 4 through 5, paragraph 2, from Plaintiff’s complaint without
leave to amend.
 
2.     
Malice,
Fraud, Oppression
 
Here, Moving Defendant argues
that punitive damages are not warranted because “Plaintiff concludes
that all Defendants acted with oppression, fraud, and malice without providing
any factual allegations of oppression, fraud, or malice. There are no facts,
for example, which demonstrate or even infer that Mr. Fong intended to cause
Plaintiff injury or deprive Plaintiff of a property or legal right.” (MTS 4:14–17.) The Court agrees, and again
notes that Plaintiff has failed to oppose the instant demurrer and motion to
strike. Accordingly, the motion to strike the remaining references to punitive
damages from Plaintiff’s complaint is granted as to Moving Defendant.
 
LEAVE TO AMEND
 
Where a demurrer is sustained,
leave to amend must be allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of
successful amendment. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.)
The burden is on the plaintiff to show the court that a pleading can be amended
successfully. (Id.; Lewis v. YouTube, LLC (2015) 244 Cal.App.4th
118, 226.) However, “[i]f there is any reasonable possibility that the
plaintiff can state a good cause of action, it is error to sustain a demurrer
without leave to amend.” (Youngman v. Nevada Irrigation Dist. (1969) 70
Cal.2d 240, 245).
 
Here, the Court notes that this
is the first demurrer brought against Plaintiff’s original complaint. Therefore,
under the Court’s liberal policy of granting leave to amend, Plaintiff is
granted 30 days leave to amend the complaint to cure the defects set forth
above. 
 
CONCLUSION
 
The
unopposed demurrer is sustained and the unopposed motion to strike is partially
granted, with 30 days leave to amend. The Court strikes page 8, lines 4 through
5, paragraph 2, from Plaintiff’s complaint without leave to amend.

and Motion to Strike Filed: 5/23/24
 
MOVING
PARTY: Defendant
Solar Service Experts, LLC, dba Spruce Power, Spruce Finance, Inc. (“Moving Defendant”)
RESPONDING
PARTY: Plaintiff
Jose Ramos Barahona, in pro per (“Plaintiff”)
NOTICE:
OK
 
RELIEF REQUESTED: Moving Defendant demurs Plaintiff’s entire complaint.
Moving Defendant also moves to strike references to punitive damages from Plaintiff’s
complaint.
 
TENTATIVE
RULING: The
unopposed demurrer is sustained with 30 days leave to amend. The motion to
strike is partially granted. The Court strikes page 8, lines 4 through 5,
paragraph 2, from Plaintiff’s complaint without leave to amend.
 
 
ANALYSIS
 
This is a contract action in which Plaintiff alleges that he
purchased certain real property located at 27716 Lakehurst Avenue, Santa
Clarita CA, which included a solar panel lease from Defendants. (Compl. ¶¶ 8,
11.) Plaintiff alleges that Defendants defrauded Plaintiff by overcharging him
for electrical utilities without adequate explanation, and “to date, the
Plaintiff does not have a copy of the contract lease agreement for his
property.” (Id. at ¶¶ 9–17.)
 
On 1/29/24, Plaintiff filed his complaint against Defendants,
alleging the following causes of action: (1) Breach of Contract Agreement; (2)
Fraudulent Misrepresentation; (3) Breach of the Implied Covenant of Good Faith
and Fair Dealing; and (4) Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress.
 
On 5/23/24, Moving Defendant filed the instant demurrer and
motion to strike. On 7/2/24, Plaintiff filed his opposition Moving Defendant’s
motion to strike. No opposition to Moving Defendant’s demurrer has been filed
to date. On 9/16/24, Moving Defendant filed its reply, and a notice of
non-opposition to its demurrer.
 
ANALYSIS
 
As a general matter,
a party may respond to a pleading against it by demurrer on the basis of any
single or combination of eight enumerated grounds, including that “the pleading
does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e).) In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be
apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice.¿(Donabedian
v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)¿
 
“A demurrer tests
the pleading alone, and not the evidence or facts alleged.” (E-Fab, Inc.
v. Accountants, Inc. Servs. (2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 1308, 1315.) As such,
the court assumes the truth of the complaint’s properly pleaded or implied
factual allegations. (Ibid.) The only issue a demurrer is concerned with
is whether the complaint, as it stands, states a cause of action. (Hahn v.
Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) 
 
Here, Moving Defendant demurs
against Plaintiff’s entire complaint, arguing that Plaintiff fails to allege
facts sufficient to state any of the causes of action contained therein.
 
A.   
Meet
and Confer
 
Before filing its
demurrer, “the demurring party shall meet and confer in person or by telephone
with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the
purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve
the objections to be raised in the demurrer.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 430.41, subd.
(a).) The demurring
party must file and serve a meet and confer declaration stating either: “(A)
The means by which the demurring party met and conferred with the party who
filed the pleading subject to demurrer, and that the parties did not reach an
agreement resolving the objections raised in the demurrer;” or “(B) That the
party who filed the pleading subject to demurrer failed to respond to the meet
and confer request of the demurring party or otherwise failed to meet and
confer in good faith.” (Id. at subd. (a)(3).)
 
Here, Moving
Defendant’s counsel declares that on 4/30/24, she sent Plaintiff a letter discussing
the issues raised in the instant demurrer and motion to strike. (Decl. of McKenzie
N. Hardy ¶ 2.) On 5/3/24 and 5/6/24, Moving Defendant’s attorney met and
conferred with Plaintiff, but the parties were unable to come to a resolution.
(Id. at ¶¶ 3–4.) Accordingly, the Court finds that counsel has satisfied the preliminary meet
and confer requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41, subdivision
(a).
 
B.    
Breach
of Contract
 
Plaintiff’s first cause of
action alleges against all defendants Breach of Contract Agreement. To state a
cause of action for breach of contract, a plaintiff must be able to establish
“(1) the existence of the contract, (2) plaintiff’s performance or excuse for
nonperformance, (3) defendant’s breach, and (4) the resulting damages to the
plaintiff.” (Oasis West Realty, LLC v. Goldman (2011) 51 Cal.4th 811,
821.) A written contract may be pleaded either verbatim or generally “according
to its legal intendment and effect.” (Construction Protective Services, Inc.
v. TIG Specialty Ins. Co. (2002) 29 Cal.4th 189, 198–199.)
 
Here, Plaintiff has attached a
copy of the subject agreement to his complaint. (Ex. 1 to Compl.) However, as
Moving Defendant observes, the parties to the original agreement are “Hazel
Adkins and Tredegar Solar Fund 1, LLC and is dated November 2013. The related
Transfer of Solar Agreement is between Hazel Adkins, Plaintiff Jose Miguel
Ramos Barahona, and Tredegar Solar Fund 1, LLC. Plaintiff signed the Transfer
of Solar Agreement on October 19, 2021, and thus became a party to the SPA.”
(Dem. 1:11–15, citing Ex. 1 to Compl.) Moving Defendant therefore argues that
it “is not a party to or even mentioned in the contract Plaintiff attached to
his Complaint which is accepted as true for purposes of demurrer.” (Id. at
3:21–22.) Moving Defendant further argues that “Plaintiff does not show he
performed under the contract or was excused from performance. Regardless, the
most glaring issue is that there are no facts to prove SSE has a contractual
relationship with Plaintiff.” (Id. at 3:13–15.)
 
The Court
notes that Plaintiff has not filed any opposition to Moving Defendant’s
demurrer. Based on the foregoing, the Court finds that Plaintiff has failed to
allege the existence of a written contract between himself and Moving Defendant,
and his own performance or excuse for nonperformance thereunder, and therefore
has failed to allege facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action for
Breach of Contract. Accordingly, the demurrer is sustained as to Plaintiff’s
first cause of action.
 
C.   
Fraudulent
Misrepresentation
 
Plaintiff’s second cause of
action alleges Fraudulent Misrepresentation against Defendants. “One who
willfully deceives another with intent to induce him to alter his position to
his injury or risk, is liable for any damage which he thereby suffers.” (Civ.
Code § 1709.) The elements that must be pleaded in a cause of action for fraud
are: (1) a misrepresentation (false representation, concealment or
nondisclosure); (2) knowledge of its falsity (or “scienter”); (3) intent to
defraud (i.e., to induce reliance); (4) justifiable reliance; and (5) resulting
damage. (Philipson & Simon v. Gulsvig (2007) 154 Cal.App.4th 347,
363.) Fairness requires that allegations of fraud be pled “with particularity”
so that the court can weed out nonmeritorious actions before a defendant is
required to answer. (Small v. Fritz Companies, Inc. (2003) 30 Cal.4th
167, 184.) The particularity requirement necessitates pleading facts that “show
how, when, where, to whom, and by what means the representations were
tendered.” (Lazar v. Superior Court (1996) 12 Cal.4th 631, 645.)
 
Here, Plaintiff details his
alleged communications with Defendants from September 2021 through March 2022,
alleging that Defendants were evasive and unhelpful in explaining the amounts
charged on Plaintiff’s electric bills. (Compl. ¶¶ 9–16.) Plaintiff further
alleges that “Defendants fraudulently misrepresented to Plaintiff and failed to
justify the details of the contract lease agreement,” that “Defendants knew
that these representations were false and made such representations to deceive
and defraud Plaintiff and to induce Plaintiff to act in reliance upon these
representations.” (Id. at ¶¶ 23–24.) “As a direct and proximate result
of Defendants’ fraudulent misrepresentations, Plaintiff has suffered damages,
legal fees, costs, expenses, and his credit ruined.” (Id. at ¶ 25.)
 
Moving Defendant argues that
Plaintiff’s allegations “are not specific enough to state a claim for
fraud and do not go to each element necessary.” (Dem. 4:21–22.) “From these
facts alone, it is unclear who actually made any fraudulent misrepresentations
to Plaintiff and when they were made.” (Id. at 4:23–24.) The Court
agrees, and finds that Plaintiff’s allegations fail to clearly state the
alleged misrepresentations made by Moving Defendant.
 
Based on
the foregoing, has failed to allege facts sufficient to constitute a cause of
action for Fraudulent Misrepresentation. Accordingly, the demurrer is sustained
as to Plaintiff’s second cause of action.
 
D.   
Breach
of the Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing
 
Plaintiff’s third cause of
action alleges against Defendants a breach of the implied covenant of good
faith and fair dealing with respect to the services agreement. Every contract
contains an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing that neither party
will do anything to interfere with the other party’s right to receive the
benefits of the agreement. (Howard v. American Nat'l Fire Ins. Co.
(2010) 187 Cal.App.4th 498, 528.) The precise nature and extent of the duty
depends on the nature and purpose of the underlying contract and the parties’
legitimate expectations arising from the contract. (Ibid.) “A breach of
the implied covenant of good faith is a breach of the contract … and breach of
a specific provision of the contract is not ... necessary to a claim for breach
of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.” (Thrifty Payless,
Inc. v. The Americana at Brand, LLC (2013) 218 Cal.App.4th 1230, 1244.)
 
However, “if the allegations [of
breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing] do not go beyond the
statement of a mere contract breach and, relying on the same alleged acts, simply
seek the same damages or other relief already claimed in a companion contract
cause of action, they may be disregarded as superfluous as no additional claim
is actually stated.” (Careau & Co. v. Security Pacific Business Credit,
Inc. (1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 1371, 1395.)
 
Here, Plaintiff alleges that
Defendants breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing by
“engaging in action purposefully aligned at frustrating and wrongfully
overbilling services for solar panels to Plaintiff, or that Defendants promised
to procure on his behalf.” (Compl. ¶ 29.) Moving Defendant argues that “because
SSE is not a party to the underlying contract, and Plaintiff’s cause of action
for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing is based
entirely on the same allegations in the breach of contract cause of action, the
demurrer to this cause of action should be sustained without leave to amend.” (Dem.
5:23–26.)
 
The Court agrees, and finds that
to the extent that Plaintiff’s third cause of action derives from his defective
cause of action for Breach of Contract, it likewise fails. Accordingly, the
demurrer is sustained against Plaintiff’s third cause of action.
 
E.    
Intentional
Infliction of Emotional Distress
 
Plaintiff’s fourth cause of
action alleges Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress against Defendant.
“The elements of a prima facie case for the tort of intentional infliction of
emotional distress are: (1) extreme and outrageous conduct by the defendant
with the intention of causing, or reckless disregard of the probability of
causing, emotional distress; (2) the plaintiff’s suffering severe or extreme
emotional distress; and (3) actual and proximate causation of the emotional
distress by the defendant’s outrageous conduct. Conduct to be outrageous must
be so extreme as to exceed all bounds of that usually tolerated in a civilized
community.” (Wilson v. Hynek (2012) 207 Cal.App.4th 999, 1009.) A mere
allegation that a plaintiff suffered severe emotional distress, without facts
indicating the nature or extent of any mental suffering incurred as a result of
the defendant’s alleged outrageous conduct, does not state a cause of action
for intentional infliction of emotional distress. (Pitman v. City of Oakland
(1988) 197 Cal.App.3d 1037, 1047–1048.)
 
Here, Moving Defendant argues
that Plaintiffs’ allegations do not rise to the requisite level of
outrageousness to support a cause of action for intentional infliction of
emotional distress because “it is unclear who exactly damaged his credit, how
they did it, or when it occurred. Moreover, there are no facts to support any
outrageous and intentional conduct by SSE.” (Dem. 6:27–7:1.)  The Court agrees.  
 
The demurrer is sustained
against Plaintiff’s fourth cause of action.
 
MOTION TO STRIKE 
 
The Court adopts the same
findings from its companion tentative ruling. The Court strikes page 8, lines 4
through 5, paragraph 2, from Plaintiff’s complaint without leave to amend.
 
CONCLUSION
 
The
unopposed demurrer is sustained with 30 days leave to amend. The motion to
strike is partially granted. The Court strikes page 8, lines 4 through 5,
paragraph 2, from Plaintiff’s complaint without leave to amend.
