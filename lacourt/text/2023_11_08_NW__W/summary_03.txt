Here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling on a motion to compel responses to a deposition subpoena for production of business records to A3 Artists Agency, LLC and a request for monetary sanctions. The plaintiff, Hongmaisui International A/K/A Hongmaisui International Culture (Beijing) Co., Ltd, is seeking to compel A3 Artists Agency, LLC to respond to the deposition subpoena and is also seeking monetary sanctions against A3 Artists Agency, LLC in the amount of $2,460.00 for attorney fees and costs incurred in bringing forth the motion. The defendant, Simon Alexander West, has not opposed the motion. The court notes that objections were never served on the subpoena deposition and therefore, the 60-day deadline has not been triggered. Additionally, the court notes that the plaintiff did not satisfy the service requirements described in Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1346, which provides that a written notice and all moving papers supporting a motion to compel answer to a deposition question must be personally served on the non-party deponent. As a result, the court denies the motion to compel responses to the deposition subpoena and also denies the request for monetary sanctions.
