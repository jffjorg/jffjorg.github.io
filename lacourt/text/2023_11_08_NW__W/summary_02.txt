```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge denies the Los Angeles Unified School District's motion for judgment on the pleadings, which argued that the district is immune to the plaintiff's claims due to the retroactive application of Assembly Bill 218. The Judge finds that AB 218 does not constitute an unconstitutional gift of public funds, as it revives previously time-barred civil claims and does not create an obligation on the part of the district to pay a claim made by the plaintiff. The Judge also finds that the public purpose of AB 218 is to ensure that victims of childhood sexual abuse can seek compensation from those responsible, whether private or public entities.
