[Tentative] Ruling: GRANT
 
Melanie Carbajal, Maymarie Carbajal,
Mason Cardona, Michael Carbajal, Bella Rodriguez, and Chanel Carbajal, minors
by and through their parent, Melvy Cardona, have agreed to settle their claims
against Defendants SFV Portfolio – 14732 Blythe Owner, LP and 14732 Blythe
Associates, L.L.C. in exchange for $4,000.00 each. 
 
Court approval is required for all
settlements of a minor’s claim.  (Prob.
Code §§ 3500, 3600, et seq.; CCP § 372.) 
CRC Rule 7.950 provides that a petition “must be verified by the
petitioner and must contain a full disclosure of all information that has any
bearing upon the reasonableness of the compromise.”  (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.950.)  Rule 7.950 states that the Petition must be
filed on Judicial Council Form MC-350 and must be fully completed.  Finally, per California Rules of Court, Rule
7.952, Petitioner and Minor Claimant must appear at the hearing. The Court will
require their appearance in order to grant the petition.
 
The total settlement amount is
$100,000.00. Each minor is to receive $4,000.00. The remaining adults are to
receive $26,666.67, minus $10,666.67 each for attorney's fees and deduction of
$4,000 each for costs. Counsel seeks $1,600.00 in attorney fees per minor. This
will leave a balance of $2,400.00 per minor. The $2,400.00 ($14,400.00 total)
will be paid directly to the parent. As noted above, all other costs will be
deducted from the adult Plaintiffs' Settlement. The settlement amounts appear
to be fair and reasonable. 
 
The court must apply a reasonable fee
standard in approving attorney’s fees in a minor’s compromise petition. (Cal.
Rules of Court, Rule 7.955(a).) Generally, the court finds that 25% in
attorney’s fees for a minor’s compromise petition is more than reasonable,
unless a higher award can be justified. Counsel seeks 40% attorney fees. Based
upon the declarations submitted, the court is satisfied with the efforts in
this case to justify such a high fee. 
 
However, Bella Rodriguez’s Form MC-350
is missing pages. If Petitioner can provide the missing pages before the
hearing, the court will grant the six petitions. Per California Rules of Court,
Rule 7.952, Petitioner and Claimant must appear at the November 8, 2023
hearing, unless the court finds good cause to excuse their appearance.
Petitioner is  requested to appear
telephonically for the hearing; the minors are excused form appearing given
their youth and the information provided in support of the minor’s
compromise.
