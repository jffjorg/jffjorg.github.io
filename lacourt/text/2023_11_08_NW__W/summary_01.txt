And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is granting the petition to confirm the minor's compromise between the minors (Melanie Carbajal, Maymarie Carbajal, Mason Cardona, Michael Carbajal, Bella Rodriguez, and Chanel Carbajal) and the defendants (SFV Portfolio - 14732 Blythe Owner, LP and 14732 Blythe Associates, L.L.C.). The minors have agreed to settle their claims against the defendants in exchange for $4,000.00 each. The total settlement amount is $100,000.00. The court will require the appearance of the petitioner (Melvy Cardona) and the minors at the hearing to grant the petition. The court will also consider the attorney's fees and costs associated with the settlement. The judge notes that the settlement amounts appear to be fair and reasonable, and that the court must apply a reasonable fee standard in approving the attorney's fees. The judge will grant the petition if the missing pages of Bella Rodriguez's Form MC-350 are provided before the hearing.
