BACKGROUND
 
This action arises out of allegations by Plaintiff Jane Doe that
she was sexually abused by a former employee of Defendant Los Angeles Unified
School District (“LAUSD”), Defendant William Paden, while he was employed by LAUSD.
On September 28, 2022, Plaintiff filed a complaint against LAUSD and Paden for
(1) sexual abuse of a minor, (2) intentional infliction of emotional distress,
(3) sexual harassment, (4) negligent hiring, supervision, and retention of an
unfit employee, (5) breach of mandatory duty: failure to report suspected child
abuse (Government Code section 815.6), (6) negligent failure to warn, train, or
educate, (7) negligent supervision of a minor, and (8) negligence. 
 
[Tentative] Ruling
 
Defendant Los Angeles Unified School District’s Motion for
Judgment on the Pleadings is DENIED. 
 
REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
 
In opposition, Plaintiff requests this
court take judicial notice of several documents regarding the legislative
history of Assembly Bill 218 (“AB 218”). (See RJN, Exhs. 1-8.) The court GRANTS
Plaintiff’s request. 
 
DISCUSSION
 
Defendant LAUSD moves for an order for judgment on the pleadings
with respect to all four of Plaintiff’s causes of action against them on the
grounds LAUSD is immune to the claims set forth in Plaintiff’s complaint. Specifically,
LAUSD contends Plaintiff never submitted a tort claim to LAUSD and California
Assembly Bill 218, on which Plaintiff relies, is unconstitutional. 
 
Under California Code of Civil Procedure section 438(c)(1)(B), a
defendant may move for judgment on the pleadings if the complaint does not
state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against that defendant.
(CCP § 438(c)(1)(B).)  The standard for
granting a motion for judgment on the pleadings is essentially the same as that
applicable to a general demurrer. (Burnett v. Chimney Sweep (2004) 123
Cal.App.4th 1057, 1064.)  The court must
assume the truth of all factual allegations in the complaint, along with
matters subject to judicial notice.  (Wise
v. Pacific Gas & Electric Co. (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th. 725, 738.)  The court must view the allegations in the
light most favorable to the plaintiff. (Edwards v. Centex Real Estate Corp.
(1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 15, 28.)   
 
LAUSD first argues the Legislature cannot pass a law attempting to
impose liability on a public entity for a past occurrence where there is no
enforceable claim, as such imposition constitutes the making of a gift of
public funds. LAUSD contends, however, that is exactly what the Legislature did
in passing AB 218. 
 
Under Code of Civil Procedure section 340.1, as amended by AB 218,
in an action for recovery of damages suffered as a result of childhood sexual
assault, the time for commencement of the action shall be within 22 years of
the date the plaintiff attains the age of majority or within five years of the
date the plaintiff discovers or reasonably should have discovered that
psychological injury or illness occurring after the age of majority was caused
by the sexual assault, whichever period expires later, for any of the following
actions: (1) an action against any person for committing an act of childhood
sexual assault; or (2) an action for liability against any person or entity who
owed a duty of care to the plaintiff, if a wrongful or negligent act by that person
or entity was a legal cause of the childhood sexual assault that resulted in
the injury to the plaintiff.  (CCP § 340.1(a)(1)-(2).) AB 218 also amended
the provision that lists exceptions to the Government Claims Act, Government
Code section 905, by removing language in subdivision (m) that limited the
exception to claims arising out of conduct that occurred on or after January
2009 and adding subdivision (p), which made this change retroactive.  (See
Coats v. New Haven Unified School District (2020) 46 Cal.App.5th 415, 424
(“Coats”); Gov. Code § 905(m), (p).)   
 
As noted above, LAUSD argues AB 218’s retroactive imposition of
liability upon a public entity like LAUSD is unconstitutional under Article
XVI, Section 6 of the California Constitution, which prohibits gifts of public
funds.  LAUSD cites several cases for its proposition AB 218 violates
the gift clause because it retroactively strips statutory government immunity
from public entities such as LAUSD by eliminating the time limit to initiate
lawsuits for childhood sexual assault claims brought pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 340.1. (See Shirk v. Vista Unified Sch. Dist. (2007)
42 Cal.4th 201; see also State of California v. Sup. Ct. (2004) 32
Cal.4th 1234.) 
 
In opposition, Plaintiff relies on Coats v. New Haven Unified
School District (2020) 46 Cal.App.5th 415, which discussed the legislative
history of Section 340.1, making it clear that the modification of Government
Code section 905 was to allow this section to be applied retroactively. 
 
The court agrees. The Legislature expressly intended and had the
authority to revive lapsed claims, including lapsed claims against the State. (Liebig
v. Superior Court (1989) 209 Cal.App.3d 828, 830 [“[T]he Legislature has
the power to retroactively extend a civil statute of limitations to revive a
cause of action time-barred under the former limitations period.”].) Moreover,
AB 218 did not create an obligation on the part of a governmental agency to pay
a claim made by Plaintiff.  Rather, AB 218 revives previously time-barred civil
claims, which still must be proven in court. As noted in Heron v. Riley
(1930) 209 Cal. 507, cited by LAUSD, judgments which are to be paid by the
State “bear no semblance to gifts.” (Heron v. Riley (1930) 209 Cal. 507,
517.) 
 
In reply, LAUSD attempts to differentiate Coats on the
basis Coats did not address the gift clause at all and, in fact, only
addresses whether AB 218 runs afoul of the constitutional prohibition against
ex post facto laws and the due process clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth
Amendments to the United States Constitution. However, the court finds the same
rational applies to the situation at hand. Specifically, Coats addressed
how “subdivision (m) was added to section 905 in 2008, in direct response to Shirk”,
and found by enacting AB 218, the Legislature “lengthened the time within which
an action for damages resulting from ‘childhood sexual¿assault’ could be
brought and revived lapsed claim that had “not been litigated to finality and
that would otherwise be barred as of January 1, 2020, because the applicable
statute of limitations, claim presentation deadline, or any other time
limit had expired[.]” (Coats, supra, 46 Cal.App.5th 415, 422-424
(emphasis added).) 
 
Plaintiff also argues in opposition even if AB 218 constituted an
allocation of public funds, the public purpose at the heart of AB 218 disposes
of any impermissible "gift" challenge. In reply, LAUSD argues California
authority makes clear that the appropriation of public funds for the payment of
unenforceable claims serves no public purpose. (See Orange County Foundation
v. Irvine Co. (1983) 139 Cal.App.3d 195, 200 (holding that, when state
funds are used to satisfy “wholly invalid claim[s]” “no ‘public purpose’ is
achieved”).) The court disagrees with LAUSD. Orange County Foundation held
that the settlement of a good faith dispute between the State and a private
party in an appropriate use of public funds and is not a gift barred by art.
XVI, § 6 of the California constitution “because the relinquishment of a
colorable legal claim in return for settlement funds paid by the State is good
consideration and accomplishes a valid public purpose.” (Orange Cnty. Found.,
supra, at p. 200.) However, if the claim is invalid or unfounded, a
promise to compromise “is not valuable consideration.” (Id. p.
201 [italics original].) To support their contention Plaintiff has no colorable
claim, LAUSD cites to Conlin v. Board of Sup'rs of City and County of San
Francisco (1893) 99 Cal. 17. There, the court invalidated a law requiring
San Francisco to pay a contractor under an explicitly unenforceable contract.
The
court made clear: “An appropriation of money by the legislature for the relief
of one who has no legal claim therefor must be regarded as a gift within the
meaning of that term … and it is none the less a gift that a sufficient motive
appears for its appropriation[.]” (Id., at p. 22.) Because the plaintiff
in Conlin did not have a basis for a claim for compensation from the
City before his injury, the court found the law did not serve a public purpose.
However, unlike Conlin, the Plaintiff here could have sought liability
against LAUSD back when the alleged sexual abuse occurred and therefore, could
have a colorable legal claim against them. 
 
Based on the foregoing, the court finds AB 218 fits within the
public purpose exception to the California constitution’s gift clause. “The
determination of what constitutes a public purpose is primarily a matter for
the Legislature to determine, and its discretion will not be disturbed by the
courts so long as that determination has a reasonable basis. [Citations.]” (County
of Alameda v. Carleson (1971) 5 Cal.3d 730, 746.) The public purpose of Code
of Civil Procedure section 340.1 was “ ‘to ensure that victims severely damaged
by childhood sexual abuse are able to seek compensation from those responsible,
whether those responsible are private or public entities....’ ” [Citations.] (A.M.
v. Ventura Unified School Dist. (2016) 3 Cal.App.5th 1252, 1264.) 
 
Accordingly, Defendant LAUSD’s Motion for Judgment on the
Pleadings is DENIED.
