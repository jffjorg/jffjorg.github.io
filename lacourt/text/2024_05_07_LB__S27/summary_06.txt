And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed the motions for protective orders filed by Plaintiffs and has issued a tentative ruling. The Court finds that Plaintiffs have not met their burden to show that the discovery is oppressive and burdensome. The Court notes that while the volume of discovery may be large, it is not unreasonable to expect Plaintiffs to respond to discovery. The Court grants the motion for protective order in part, requiring Plaintiffs to respond to discovery. The Court also limits the number of discovery responses to 35 questions. The Court denies both parties' requests for sanctions due to a lack of good faith in the meet and confer process. The Court orders the parties to meet and confer to limit the discovery and to respond to discovery by the specified deadlines.
