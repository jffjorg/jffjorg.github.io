And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court will hear the plaintiff's motion to compel answers to questions at the deposition of Defendant's PMQ, Yordan Nachev. The court finds the motion timely, as the deposition was conducted in February 2024, and the motion was filed promptly upon receipt of the transcript. The court will decide at the hearing whether the dispute needs to be submitted to the discovery referee or whether it should be heard by the court. If the court decides to hear the motion, it will briefly continue the hearing to permit the defendant to substantively respond and support its privilege objections. The court will also discuss a timeline for the resolution of the PMQ deposition issue and the hearing on the summary judgment motion.
