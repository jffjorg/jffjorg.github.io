And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The court has denied the defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings, which argued that Assembly Bill 218, which modified the statute of limitations for childhood sexual abuse claims, is unconstitutional. The court found that the bill was enacted to reduce barriers for victims to assert claims and that the public purpose in reviving claims is valid. The court also noted that statutes should be construed, if reasonably possible, to avoid finding they are unconstitutional. The court has ordered LBUSD to give notice of the tentative ruling and has set a hearing date for May 7, 2024.
