 Case Number:  22LBCV00049    Hearing Date:   May 7, 2024    Dept:  S27 Willow has motions to compel
further responses scheduled on 5/07/24, 6/06/24, 6/11/24, and 8/13/24.  
 
SEJ’s attorney of record, Stone
& Sallus, was relieved as counsel on 3/12/24.  On 3/22/24, the firm filed a notice of
attorneys’ lien.  To date, SEJ has not
substituted a new attorney into the action. 
However, on 4/18/24, Charles G. Gomez of Gomez Law, APC, filed a Notice
of Appeal in this action on behalf of SEJ. 
It appears Gomez is representing SEJ.
 
The Court is hopeful that Counsel,
now that SEJ is represented, can resolve the issues posed by way of the
motions.  The Court notes that the
discovery responses at issue appear to consist solely of objections, and that
the motion on calendar on 5/07/24 is unopposed. 
The burden to justify an objection to a discovery request is on the
party asserting the objection.  See
Fairmont Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (2000) 22 Cal.4th 245, 255.  
 
The Court reschedules the hearing
for all four motions for Thursday, 6/06/24 at 8:30 a.m. in Department S27.  Counsel are ordered to meet and confer in
good faith in an attempt to resolve all disputes prior to the hearing.  To the extent SEJ intends to stand on its
objections, SEJ must submit timely opposition to the motion(s) and justify the
objection(s).  If the parties resolve
their issues prior to the hearing, Willow must take the motions off
calendar.  Opposition and reply are due
per Code.  
 
Willow is ordered to give notice.
 
Parties who intend to submit
on this tentative must send an email to the court at gdcdepts27@lacourt.org indicating intention to submit on the tentative
as directed by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department
does not receive an email indicating the parties are submitting on the
tentative and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion may be placed
off calendar.  If a party submits on
the tentative, the party’s email must include the case number and must identify
the party submitting on the tentative.  If
the parties do not submit on the tentative, they should arrange to appear
remotely.
