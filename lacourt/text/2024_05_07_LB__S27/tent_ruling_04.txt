Requested Relief
Plaintiff seeks to recover
attorneys’ fees and costs in the total amount of $43,934.66, which amount

$5000 in potential fees for reviewing the opposition and preparing the reply.  
 
c.    
Opposition
Any opposition to the motion was
due on or before 4/24/24.  The Court has
not received timely opposition, and will not consider late-filed
opposition.  
 
d.    
Request for Judicial Notice
Plaintiff seeks judicial notice of
numerous trial court orders wherein Plaintiff’s attorney has sought and been
awarded attorneys’ fees.  The purpose of
the RJN is to establish the hourly rate and amount of fees sought is
reasonable.  The RJN is granted.
 
e.    
Attorneys’ Fees
Plaintiff is entitled to attorneys’
fees pursuant to Civil Code §1974(d).  Exhibit
23 to Plaintiff’s attorney’s declaration is a schedule of tasks billed and
hourly rates.  The schedule shows
Plaintiff’s attorney’s firm billed at rates ranging from $200/hour to
$530/hour.  Ultimately, 89.5 hours were
billed with a total fee of $37,517, meaning the average billing rate was $419.18/hour.  
 
Plaintiff made a prima facie
showing that the fees sought are reasonable. 
In the absence of opposition, the motion is granted in full.  The Court will, however, not award the requested
$5000 to review the opposition and prepare a reply, as no opposition was filed.
 
f.     
Costs
Plaintiff seeks to recover $1417.66 in costs.  Costs
are recoverable by way of a memorandum of costs, and any challenge must be made
by way of a motion to strike or tax costs. 
CRC 3.1700.  Plaintiff has set
forth no authority permitting it to recover costs via noticed motion, and the
Court knows of none.  The Court notes
that Plaintiff also filed a memorandum of costs, and the relief sought by way
of this motion is superfluous.  The
request for costs is therefore denied as unnecessary and improper.  
 
g.    
Conclusion
Plaintiff’s motion for attorneys’ fees is granted in part.  Plaintiff is awarded fees in the amount of $37,517,
the amount of attorneys’ fees incurred to date.
 
Plaintiff is ordered to give
notice.
