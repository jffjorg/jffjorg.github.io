And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Roseana Lucero vs. The Kroger Company. The plaintiff, Roseana Lucero, filed a lawsuit against The Kroger Company for damages arising from a slip and fall on a cherry in one of the company's stores. The plaintiff moved to compel the deposition of Shaun Richmond, a former employee of The Kroger Company, who allegedly saw the cherry before the fall and did not pick it up. However, Richmond failed to appear for the deposition, and the plaintiff served the moving papers on him by mail and email. The court denied the motion to compel deposition due to improper service of the moving papers. The judge ordered the plaintiff to give notice, and instructed the parties to indicate their intention to submit on the tentative ruling.
