And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the Plaintiff's motion for leave to amend the complaint to add a direct liability claim against the City. The Plaintiff, Ginger Andre Dolle, seeks to add claims against the City on a direct liability theory (Monell claim) arising from a series of sexual assaults perpetrated by Officer Assef when she was a minor. The City opposes the motion, arguing that the proposed amended complaint fails to state a cause of action and that the delay in seeking relief bars the claim. The Court denies the motion, finding that the proposed Monell claim does not relate back to the original complaint, citing the case of Newton v. County of Napa.
