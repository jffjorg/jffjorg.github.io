The court has also approved the payment of $2,441.95 in attorney fees and $232.50 in costs, leaving a net balance of $7,325.55 to be deposited into a blocked account. The court notes that the petition lacks specific articulation of the $232.50 in costs, but accepts and approves the costs as part of law firm billing. The judge orders the moving party to provide notice of the settlement.
