SUMMARY
OF ACTION
On
August 9, 2022, Plaintiffs filed a complaint for 1) Breach Of Implied Warranty
Of Habitability 2) Breach Of Statutory Warranty Of Habitability 3) Breach Of
The Covenant Of Quiet Enjoyment 4) Negligence 5) Private Nuisance. On June 24,
2024, Plaintiffs filed a Notice of Settlement of Entire Case.
 
RULING: Granted.
Plaintiffs settled with defendants for a total of $150,000:
$70,000 to Matthew Lewis, $70,000 to Kalauni Jackson, and $10,000 to 17 year
old Dezirae Jackson. 
 
Counsel seeks $2,441.95 in attorney fees, which is slightly
below 25% of the total settlement, plus, $232.50 in costs, thereby leaving a
net balance of $7,325.55 to be deposited into a blocked account. The petition
lacks specific articulation of the $232.50 in costs, but the court accepts and approves
the costs as part of law firm billing.
 
The petition is granted.
