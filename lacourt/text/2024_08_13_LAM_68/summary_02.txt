And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving a motion to compel compliance with a deposition subpoena for production of documents. The plaintiff, South Bay Steel Erectors, seeks to compel compliance with the subpoena, while the defendant, Build Group Construction Company, Inc., opposes the motion on behalf of the non-party, Ocotillo LA 9001SMB, LLC. The court has declined to address the motion until the parties clarify the scope of the judicial reference entered into on May 15, 2024. If the parties agree that all discovery matters, including the subject motion, should proceed before the referee, the court will take the matter off-calendar. However, if the referral limits the referee's scope to items unrelated to the subject discovery, and the parties require court intervention on discovery, the court will continue the hearing to August 23, 2024, for a hearing on the merits.
