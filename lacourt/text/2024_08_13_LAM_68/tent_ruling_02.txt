On
February 2, 2023, Build Group Construction Company, Inc. filed a complaint

Pacific Western Bank, and Pacific Western National Bank.
 
On
May 15, 2024, the court entered the stipulation of the parties for judicial
reference. 
 
RULING: Off-Calendar or
Continued. 
Request
for Judicial Notice: Denied
The
court cannot take judicial notice of filed documents and/or searches with the
California Secretary of State. The items are not reflective of an actual official act of the Secretary of
State. (Friends of Shingle Springs
Interchange, Inc. v. County of El Dorado (2011) 200 Cal.App.4th 1470, 1483-1484.)
 
Plaintiff
South Bay Steel Erectors moves to compel compliance with the Deposition Subpoena
for Production of Documents Ocotillo LA 9001SMB, LLC (Ocotillo). Build Group
Construction Company, Inc. opposes the motion on behalf of “non-party”
Ocotillo. Plaintiff challenges the lack of any opposition from Ocotillo itself,
and challenges the basis of standing by Build Group Construction Company. 
 
On
May 15, 2024, the court entered the stipulation for judicial reference. An
Order Appointing Referee under Code of Civil Procedure section 638 was
submitted on July 31, 2024. The subject motion was filed prior the stipulation
on April 26, 2024, but it remains unclear whether the order for judicial
reference also includes any and all discovery matters, even for third parties
(former, now dismissed parties).
 
The
court therefore declines to address the motion unless and until the parties
clarify the scope of the judicial reference. If the parties agree that all
discovery proceeds before the referee, then the court will take the matter
off-calendar. If the referral as to the subcontract somehow limits the referral
to items completely unrelated to the subject discovery, and the parties require
court intervention on discovery, the court will continue the hearing to Friday
August 23, 2024, for a hearing on the merits.
 
Plaintiff to give notice.
