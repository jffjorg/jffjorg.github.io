SUMMARY
OF ACTION

On
December 10, 2023, the court entered judgment in favor of Plaintiff Medina
against Defendant Lighthouse Healthcare Center, LLC, for $12,500 pursuant to an
Offer to Compromise under Code of Civil Procedure section 998. 
 
RULING: Granted.
Plaintiff Bertha Medina moves for $53,034 in attorney fees following
the 998 offer to compromise and agreement for the recovery of fees. Defendant
Lighthouse Healthcare Center, LLC, in opposition challenge any recovery of
attorney fees, and alternatively maintain the requested fees are inflated.
Plaintiff in reply challenges the lack of any substantive specific challenge
presented by Defendant. Plaintiff reiterates the categorical entitlement to
attorney fees pursuant to acceptance of the 998 offer, and the application of
the multiplier. Plaintiff also challenges any reduction based on a ratio to the
amount recovered.
 
The
998 offer led to an $12,500 recovery, with attorney fees to be determined via
noticed motion before the court. The accepted offer specifically delegated
determination of fees to the court, thereby entitling Plaintiffs to bring the
subject motion. (Engle
v. Copenbarger & Copenbarger, LLP (2007) 157 Cal.App.4th 165, 168–169.) Plaintiff is a
presumed a prevailing party and entitled to recover statutory fees. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1032, subd.
(a)(4), 1033.5, subd. (a)(10)(B).)
 
A motion for attorney fees leading up to and including
rendition of the judgment must be served and filed within the time for the
filing of a notice of appeal in a civil case. (Cal. Rules Ct., rule
3.1702(b)(1).) The time for the filing of a notice of appeal in an unlimited
action is 60 days if a “Notice of Entry” of Judgment was served by the court
clerk or a party to the action, or within 180 days of entry of judgment.
(California Rules of Court rule 8.104.) 
The motion was timely filed 100 days after entry of judgment.
 
The court considers the sought after request for $53,034. “‘[T]he lodestar is the basic fee for
comparable legal services in the community; it may be adjusted by the court
based on factors including, as relevant herein, (1) the novelty and difficulty
of the questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the
extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded other employment by the
attorneys, (4) the contingent nature of the fee award. [Citation.] The purpose
of such adjustment is to fix a fee at the fair market value for the particular
action. In effect, the court determines, retrospectively, whether the
litigation involved a contingent risk or required extraordinary legal skill
justifying augmentation of the unadorned lodestar in order to approximate the
fair market rate for such services.’” (Graciano v. Robinson Ford Sales, Inc. (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 140, 154.)
 
The reasonableness of attorney fees lies within the
discretion of the trial court. (PLCM
Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1096.) The court makes it
determination based on the consideration of a number of factors, including,
“the nature of the litigation, its difficulty, the amount involved, the skill
required in its handling, the skill employed, the attention given, the success
or failure, and other circumstances in the case.” (Ibid.) The court should apply an objective standard of
reasonableness. (Id. at p. 1098.) “A
fee request that appears unreasonably inflated is a special circumstance
permitting the trial court to reduce the award or deny one altogether.” (Serrano v. Unruh (1982) 32 Cal.3d
621, 635.) The court adheres to the “market
rate” approach for contingency cases. (Pasternack
v. McCullough (2021) 65 Cal.App.5th 1050,
1057; Center for Biological Diversity
v. County of San Bernardino (2010) 188 Cal.App.4th 603,
619-620.)
 
The
number of hours is not separately totaled in any form. The court calculates a
total number of hours at just under 62 subject to arithmetic
verification/correction by either party. [Evidence Package, Ex. A.]
 
Counsel
lists billable rates between $250 to $1,200 per hour, with a specific itemized
statement of work from September 14, 2021, through February 26, 2024, with total
fees adding up to $44,195, plus an additional $8,500 sought for the instant
motion. Defendant only offers a summary challenge to the hourly rates. While the court cannot take judicial notice of other courts
approved billable rates, the court finds the collective billing represents a
reasonable range of market rates and a properly blended rate structure.
(Mikhaeilpoor v. BMW of North America, LLC (2020) 48 Cal.App.5th 240, 247, 256; Center for Biological Diversity v. County of San Bernardino
(2010) 188 Cal.App.4th 603, 619-620; see Lindy Bros. Builders, Inc. of Phila. v. American Radiator &
Standard Sanitary Corp. (3d Cir. 1973) 487 F.2d 161, 167.) 
 
The
billing statement provides a number of variable rates: significant amounts of
work by support staff at $250 per hour, MQE at $550 per hour, with later work
by SLO at $650 and FRN at $950, and finally limited work by RRY at $1,200. The
court finds a blended rate of $750/hour constitutes a representative blended
market rate recovery.
 
Defendants seek to reduce or even index the recovered amount
downward in some sort of proportion to the 998 recovery. Some courts in fact
advised against rewarding fees as means of discouraging attorneys from
litigating “questionable claims.” (Weeks v. Baker & McKenzie (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1175; Sokolow v. County of San Mateo
(1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 231, 250.) The position finds general support. (Hensley v. Eckerhart (1983) 461 U.S. 424, 434-436;
Chavez v. City of Los Angeles (2010)
47 Cal.4th 970, 990.) The court declines to consider the opinions of the
parties over merits of the underlying action, and the court was not presented
with a. request to consider the evidentiary value of the claims. The settlement
offer itself therefore demonstrates a measure of validity to the underlying
claims. The court also declines to reduce the award on the basis of the
“limited” success given the public policy goals for enforcement of labor
standards inherent in employment litigation. The court instead addresses the
reasonableness of the items. (Ketchum v. Moses (2001)
24 Cal.4th 1122, 1132-1134; Serrano
v. Unruh, supra, 32 Cal.3d at p. 635.)
 
“In referring to ‘reasonable’ compensation, we indicated that trial
courts must carefully review attorney documentation of hours expended;
‘padding’ in the form of inefficient or duplicative efforts is not subject to
compensation.” (Ketchum v. Moses, supra,
24 Cal.4th at p. 1132; Levy v. Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc. (1992) 4
Cal.App.4th 807,  817.) Defendant
generally challenges both the reasonableness of effort spent and the resources
dedicated to the claim without specific address of any particular entries or
the exact conduct. 
 
While
the opposition presents a facially deficient and conclusive challenge to the
requested fees, the court can neither rubber stamp
approve the billing statement nor categorically reduce fees. The billing
statement contains documented examples of seemingly redundant billing on items
and to unidentified personnel. (Donahue v. Donahue (2010) 182 Cal.App.4th 259,
271.) The statement shows significant amounts entries both pre-filing on the
February 10, 2023, filed complaint, as well as numerous items following the
complaint into mediation and the 998 offer. “[C]ounsel
may not submit a plethora of noncompensable, vague, blockbilled attorney time
entries and expect particularized, individual deletions as the only
consequence. The trial court could reasonably conclude counsel made no effort
to prune the fee request to comply with the law. Counsel erred grievously by
attempting to transfer that responsibility onto the trial court. The trial
court could reasonably conclude counsels disregard for the law undercut the
credibility of their fee request and, as officers of the court, warranted a
severe reaction.” (Christian Research Institute v.
Alnor (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1329.) The
court must make an individual determination of entitlement. (Mountjoy v. Bank of America,
N.A. (2016) 245 Cal.App.4th 266, 280-281.)
 
According
to Ramin Younessi and Fumio Nakahiro, the initials of FRN, SLO, CAF, and MQE
correspond to [] attorneys Fumio Nakahiro, Samantha L. Ortiz, Christopher
Afgani, and either former colleague or Mae Elain Delos Santos, who never
submitted a separate declaration notwithstanding the representation in the
declaration of Younessi [Declarations of Ramin Younessi ¶ 16, and Fumio
Nakahiro, ¶ 3.] None of the declarations identify JEN, HBL, or GGZ, though
given persons billing rate at $250/hour, the court presumes clerical or
paralegal staff.
 
The court finds multiple entries by MQE “Emailed JEN to
update SOL calendar,” including 10-1-2021, 11-1-21, 12-1-21, 2-23-22, 3-31-22,
4-27-22, 7-5-22, 8-3-22, 9-12-22, with additional entries on 4-18-22, 4-22-22
and 4-27-22, from MQE to HBL to “update calendar.” The e-mails to JEN regarding
the SOL calendar resumed on 6-1-22, and back to HBL and GGZ on 8-3-22 regarding
calendar updates, with a second e-mail to JEN for the SOL calendar on the same
date. Next JEN SOL updates on 9-12-22, and finally on 11-1-22. JEN reviewed
said e-mail on 10-1-21, and reviewed the SOL calendar on 7-5-22 and 9-12-22 The
court finds the 16 entries excessively redundant and lacking justification again
notwithstanding the lack of any specific challenge from Defendant on any
particular item. 
 
The
court finds the number of entries, even by clerical staff excessive and
insufficiently descriptive, including entry of “word instead of two” on 1-23-23
by JEN, “attached email” by ARS on 2-15-23 (to be followed by a second email
entry on 2-17-23), “cleared task” by ARS on 2-17-23, 2-26-23 “process mail” by
COR, 8-29-23 “information” on 8-29-23 by FRN. Even for slightly more
descriptive entries, the court notes a number of entries for the “ER” related
issues on 12-16-21, 12-29-21, 1-17-21, 1-24-22, 3-14-22, 6-1-22, which presumably
refer to some form of records obtained through Plaintiff’s own executed release.
The court also takes particular note of the two (2) hours for “File review and
training with RMO re ER records issue” on 12-29-21, which questions the
necessity of “training” for this specific case. Scheduling the second client
interview also finds multiple entries on 2-23-22 from three different people,
3-24-22, 3-28-22, 4-18-22, 4-22-22, 4-28-22, 5-5-22, 5-11-22, 7-8-22
(rescheduled interview), 7-18-22, 8-1-22 (no answer), 8-3-22, and 9-1-22.
Notwithstanding the multiple entries on certain items, the court accepts the mutilple
entry billing statements from the individual participants, including the
subject items as well as the entry on December 1, 2021. 
 
The
mediation section also includes any number of redundant entries. On 9-20-23,
LZB indicates two separate entries for “convo with client re: mediation,” which
also included multiple other entries on the same date for said medication from
LZB, and two additional conversation entries on 10-17-23 and 10-18-23. A number
of mediation related entries follow in May, June, July, and August into
September 2023, which the court will not individually list each item given the
dozens of entries, though the court accepts the six hours spent for the
appearance at the mediation. The 998 offer includes more than a dozen entries
from September to October, and again in December.
 
Also
buried into the expense report is review for the entry of attorney fees on
11-16-23, 11-21-23, 12-7-23, 12-21-23, 1-18-24, 1-19-24, and 2-26-24, which is
directly incorporated into the request for the base fee, and not acknowledged
in the additional and separate request for fees. The subject fields also raises
questions on the number of entries on the expense report items on January 29,
2024 and February 7, 2024, especially given the separate, unarticulated request
for attorney fees in the instant motion, other than a requested total for over
$8,000. 
 
The court finds the subject items show redundant billing and a
conflation of items, especially the attorney fee request. The court therefore
deducts 25 hours from the approximately 62 hours totaled, and allows for five
(5) hours on the subject motion to recover. Given the vast majority of the
billing was completed in 0.10 hour increments, with only selective amounts of
work billed at anything more than said units, the court finds 37 hours of work
completed by at least seven different individually identified persons billing
more than reflects the workload for a case settled after mediation and pursuant
to a 998 offer without any significant discovery or law and motion. In other
words, the court finds the dozens and dozens of redundant and questionably
necessary entries at increments from 0.10 to 2.0 hours more than justifies the
reduction of nearly 25 hours, while also supporting its finding from the
reviewed work that the 37 hours of listed work (plus five for the instant
motion) supports the course and conduct of the litigation independent of the
monetary amount recovered. The court therefore uses an hourly figure of 42
hours multiplied by the $750 hourly rate for a total of $31,500.
 
When considering a lodestar enhancement request, the court
must consider a series of factors. “[T]he lodestar is the basic fee for comparable legal services in the
community; it may be adjusted by the court based on factors including, as
relevant herein, (1) the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, (2)
the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the extent to which the nature of
the litigation precluded other employment by the attorneys, (4) the contingent
nature of the fee award.” (Ketchum v. Moses, supra,
24 Cal.4th at p. 1132.) “Contingency and delay factors” apply in consideration
of the application of a lodestar enhancement in order to reflect the “semiguaranteed”
recovery of fees upon a successfully prevailing party, but any consideration
must still acknowledge the “contingency” nature of representation in general. (Horsford v. Board of Trustees
of California State University (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 359, 400
(footnote 11).) 
 
“In Serrano IV, applying
the same principles to the statutory fee award under Code of Civil Procedure
section 1021.5, we reiterated that fee awards should be fully compensatory. We
approved the calculation of attorney fees beginning with a lodestar figure
based on the reasonable hours spent, multiplied by the hourly prevailing rate
for private attorneys in the community conducting noncontingent litigation
of the same type. (Citation.) [¶] We
held in Serrano IV that, absent circumstances rendering
the award unjust, an attorney fee award should ordinarily include compensation
for all the hours reasonably spent, including
those relating solely to the fee. (Citation.) We
explained that the purpose behind statutory fee authorizations—i.e.,
encouraging attorneys to act as private attorneys general and to vindicate
important rights affecting the public interest—'will often be frustrated,
sometimes nullified, if awards are diluted or dissipated by lengthy,
uncompensated proceedings to fix or defend a rightful fee claim.’ (Citation.) [¶] We acknowledged the discretion of the
trial court in setting attorney fees, but emphasized that because the
determination of the lodestar figures is so fundamental to arriving at an
objectively reasonable amount, ‘the exercise of that discretion must be based
on the lodestar adjustment method.’ (Ibid.) We also
reiterated that the lodestar figure may be increased by application of a fee
enhancement, or reduced as appropriate, after the trial court has considered
other factors concerning the lawsuit, including the contingent nature of the
fee award.” (Ketchum v. Moses, supra, 24 Cal.4th at pp.
1133–1134.)
 
The court declines to award a
multiplier on the subject action. “The lodestar
amount is presumptively the reasonable fee amount, and thus a multiplier may be
used to adjust the lodestar amount upward or downward only in “ ‘rare’ and
‘exceptional’ cases, supported by both ‘specific evidence’ on the record and
detailed findings by the lower courts” that the lodestar amount is unreasonably
low or unreasonably high.” (Van Gerwen v. Guarantee Mut. Life Co. (9th Cir.
2000) 214 F.3d 1041, 1045.) The court finds the lodestar determination
sufficiently addresses the fee. Nothing in the litigation over the subject
vehicle which led to a 998 offer following mediation demonstrates a rare or
exceptional case showing a significant benefit beyond compensation for the wage
and hour and FEHA claim, as well as a fee reflecting the contingency nature of
the representation. (Blum v. Stenson (1984) 465 U.S. 886, 901; Hensley v. Eckerhart,
supra, 461 U.S. at p. 434; see Thayer v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2001) 92
Cal.App.4th 819, 844.) 
 
The court also denies the negative
multiplier request. Application of a negative multiplier effectively
constitutes a collateral device for reducing the fee on the basis of the size
of the accepted 998 offer. (See Warren v. Kia Motors America,
Inc. (2018) 30 Cal.App.5th 24, 41.)
 
The court therefore awards $31,500 in fees reflecting
lodestar calculated fee, recovery for the instant motion, and lack of any
multiplier enhancement or negative application.
 
As a prevailing party, Plaintiffs are also entitled to
recover post-offer costs as well. The court in no way addresses the right to
recovery of costs. The burden remains with Defendant to challenge the February
8, 2024, filed memorandum of costs 
 
Plaintiff to give notice.
