[1] Plaintiff did not file a
declaration.  He does not declare that he
requested an explanation or that he failed to receive opportunities to read the
agreement and to consult attorneys.


[2]
Plaintiff’s  “fraud in the execution”
argument is unavailing.  (See Opposition,
pp. 8-9.) Plaintiff cites zero evidence showing fraud.  (See ibid.) 
Plus, he expressly agreed that the agreement would be binding on him,
signed or not.  (See Cuevas Decl., Ex. A,
pp. 26, 98.)


[3] The arbitrator can assess the
arbitrability of these claims if Plaintiff moves to add them during the
arbitration.
