And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for attorneys' fees filed by Georges Mikhael, plaintiff, against Carwell, LLC, and Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC, defendants. The motion seeks $39,192 in attorneys' fees based on 85.2 hours of work at $460 per hour. The defendants oppose the motion, arguing that the plaintiff's counsel is entitled to only $7,945 in attorneys' fees. The judge finds that the plaintiff's counsel is entitled to reasonable attorneys' fees, but reduces the amount to $25,300 due to excessive hours spent on tasks such as communicating with the client and drafting documents. The judge also awards $664.21 in costs. The defendants are ordered to pay the plaintiff's counsel a total of $25,964.21 within 30 days. The case is continued to May 21, 2024.
