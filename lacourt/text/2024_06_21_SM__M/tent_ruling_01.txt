MOTION:                     Demurrer to the Third Amended
Complaint  
HEARING DATE:   6/21/2024
 
LEGAL STANDARD 
 
A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether
the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147
Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations
liberally and in context. In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be
apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian
v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) A demurrer tests the
pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters. Therefore, it
lies only where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are
judicially noticed. (CCP §§ 430.30, 430.70.) At the pleading stage, a plaintiff
need only allege ultimate facts sufficient to apprise the defendant of the
factual basis for the claim against him. (Semole v. Sansoucie (1972) 28
Cal. App. 3d 714, 721.) A “demurrer does not, however, admit contentions,
deductions or conclusions of fact or law alleged in the pleading, or the
construction of instruments pleaded, or facts impossible in law.” (S. Shore
Land Co. v. Petersen (1964) 226 Cal.App.2d 725, 732, internal citations
omitted.) 
 
A special demurrer for uncertainty is
disfavored and will only be sustained where the pleading is so bad that
defendant cannot reasonably respond—i.e., cannot reasonably determine what
issues must be admitted or denied, or what counts or claims are directed
against him/her. (CCP § 430.10(f); Khoury v. Maly’s of Calif., Inc.
(1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.) Moreover, even if the pleading is somewhat
vague, “ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery procedures.” (Ibid.)  
 
“Liberality in permitting amendment is
the rule, if a fair opportunity to correct any defect has not been given.” (Angie
M. v. Superior Court (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1217, 1227.) It is an abuse of
discretion for the court to deny leave to amend where there is any reasonable
possibility that plaintiff can state a good cause of action. (Goodman v.
Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349.) The burden is on plaintiff to show¿in
what manner¿plaintiff can amend the complaint, and¿how¿that
amendment will change the legal effect of the pleading.¿(Id.) 
 
REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE 
 
Defendant’s request for judicial notice is GRANTED. (Evid. Code
§ 452(d).)  
 
ANALYSIS 
 
Defendant
Malibu West Swimming Club demurs to the first and fourth causes of action of the
third amended complaint (TAC). Defendant asserts that Plaintiff failed to allege
it has breached any obligations under the operative Conditions, Covenants and
Restrictions (“CC&Rs”). 
 
CC&Rs
are contracts between a homeowner and a homeowner association. (Frances T.
v. Village Green Owners Association (1986) 42 Cal.3d 490, 513.) Civil Code
section 5975(a) provides that CC&Rs terms are enforceable by owners as an
equitable servitude. It states: “(a) The covenants and restrictions in the
declaration shall be enforceable equitable servitudes, unless unreasonable, and
shall inure to the benefit of and bind all owners of separate interests in the
development. Unless the declaration states otherwise, these servitudes may be
enforced by any owner of a separate interest or by the association, or by
both.”
 
A
cause of action for breach of contract requires the following elements: (1)
existence of a contract; (2) plaintiff’s performance of the contract or excuse
for nonperformance; (3) defendant’s breach; and (4) resulting damage. (Harris
v. Rudin, Richman & Appel (1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 299, 307.) “On a
demurrer, the court must consider the sufficiency of the allegations, including
any parol evidence allegations, to determine whether the contract is reasonably
susceptible to plaintiff’s alleged interpretation.” (George v. Automobile
Club of Southern California (2011) 201 Cal.App.4th 1112, 1128.) A pleader’s
legal characterization of a contract is not controlling, particularly when the
contract is attached to the pleading. (Morris v. Redwood Empire Bancorp (2005)
128 Cal.App.4th 1305, 1314.) However, courts will defer to plaintiffs’ reasonable
interpretations. (Performance Plastering v. Richmond American Homes of Cal.,
Inc. (2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 659, 672.) 
 
            Defendant argues that the TAC still
fails to state a duty or breach under the CC&Rs. The TAC cites four
sections from the CC&Rs that provide for a duty and breach in this matter: 1)
Section 5.2(d); 2) Section 7.2; 3) Section 7.7; and 4) Section
7.9. 
 
            Upon review of the new allegations,
the Court concurs that the TAC still fails to state a duty under sections 5.2, 7.7,
and 7.9. The same reasoning from the prior demurrer to the SAC still applies.
Section 5.2(d) does not relate to Plaintiffs’ use of their own unit, and only
reflects the Associations’ ability to adopt and enforce reasonable rules for
use of the common areas. Section 7.7 only requires the Board to have found one
of the listed circumstances, in good faith, if the variance is granted. That
is not the issue here.
 
            As to section 7.9, the TAC’s new
allegations do not save the cause of action. Plaintiffs allege that the
Association's demands, vis-à-vis Plaintiffs’ purported view obstruction, conflict
with section 7.9. (TAC ¶¶ 141-142.) Plaintiffs focus on the dispute resolution
process of section 7.9, noting that the individual neighbors Little and Howland
failed to resolve any view obstruction informally. (¶¶ 139-144.) The first
cause of action also specifically focuses on such facts and attempts to
establish a breach therefrom. (¶¶ 242-246.) However, in the body of the TAC,
Plaintiffs shift to the alleged fact that the dispute “was submitted to the
Board during ADR,” that the Board therefore “had a duty to make a final
determination, but they breached that duty by refusing to make a final
determination of the dispute regarding the disposition of the tree.” (¶144.) This
new breach is summarily alleged without any factual specificity. Plaintiffs do
not state the facts supporting their “submission” of the issue to the Board.  Without alleging further facts showing their
submission of the issue to the Board, the TAC does not fairly allege the
Board’s failure to make a final determination on the submission. Therefore, the
TAC does not state a breach of section 7.9. 
 
That
said, Plaintiffs plead facts supporting a breach of section 7.2 and resulting
damage. 
 
Section 7.2 Removal of Sycamore and
Oak Trees. No Owner shall destroy or remove any sycamore and/or oak trees
located on the Owner's Lot without obtaining the prior written approval of the
Board. In deciding whether or not to grant approval of the proposed destruction
or removal of any sycamore or oak tree(s), the Board shall consider the effect
on the environment arising from the destruction or removal of such trees. 
 
Plaintiffs allege that the Board determined that
the dead sycamore trees cannot be removed. (TAC ¶ 238.) In making that
determination, Defendants failed to consider the environment arising from the
destruction or removal of the dead trees. (¶ 241.) Strictly speaking, this
states the Board’s breach of section 7.2’s mandate to consider this factor in
making such a determination. The TAC alleges that the presence of the dead
trees created an unreasonable fire risk. (¶ 240.) The creation or elimination
of such a fire risk may be fairly described as an environmental effect
resulting from the destruction or removal of the trees. The Board should have
considered such environmental effects, among any others, before denying Plaintiffs’
proposed removal of the trees. 
 
Plaintiffs
also establish resulting damages. Without considering the environmental effects
of the tree removal, the Board forbade Plaintiffs from removing the dead trees.
Plaintiffs were thereby precluded from Plaintiffs rebuilding their home,
resulting in delays and other damages. (TAC ¶¶ 137, 240, 282.)
 
Accordingly,
the demurrer is OVERRULED.  Defendants to
file an answer within 20 days.
