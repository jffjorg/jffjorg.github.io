```

And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling denies the motion by Jonathan Andrade and Jennifer Andrade to set aside the default and default judgment entered against them. The ruling states that Jonathan Andrade's default was entered in July 2020, and the default judgment was entered in February 2022, and therefore, he missed the six-month deadline to file the motion. Additionally, he failed to provide evidence of excusable neglect or mistake that would justify setting aside the default and default judgment. The ruling also states that the court cannot set aside a default judgment entered without valid service on a defendant, but on this record, the evidence does not support a finding that Jonathan Andrade was not served or that the judgment is void.
