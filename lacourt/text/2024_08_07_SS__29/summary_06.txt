And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the Keshishyan Defendants' motion to continue the trial, which was set for August 21, 2024, to a date in late February 2025. The judge finds good cause to grant the continuance, citing the need to hear the Keshishyan Defendants' motion for summary judgment, which is set to be heard on December 30, 2024. The judge denies the request for a special setting of the motion for summary judgment, as no dates are available. The final status conference and all deadlines are reset based on the new trial date.
