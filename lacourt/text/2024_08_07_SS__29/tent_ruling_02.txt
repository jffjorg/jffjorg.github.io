 Case Number:  21STCV36571    Hearing Date:   August 7, 2024    Dept:  29 Peck v. Jasper
21STCV36571
Motion to Deem the Truth of the
Matters Specified in Requests for Admission filed by Defendant Irwin Leslie
Jasper.
 
Tentative
The motion is granted.
Background
On October 4, 2021,
Ralph Peck (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Irwin Lesile Jasper
(“Defendant”) and Does 1 through 15 for motor vehicle negligence and general
negligence arising out of an accident occurring on October 4, 2019. 
 
Defendant filed an answer
to the complaint on October 18, 2023.
 
On February 20, 2024, Defendant
served Plaintiff with written discovery, including requests for admission.
(Ballard Decl., ¶ 4.)
 
On July 3, 2024, Defendant filed this
motion for an order deeming Plaintiff to have admitted the truth of the matters
specified in the requests for admission. No opposition has been filed.  
 
Legal Standard
 
A party must
respond to requests for admission within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2033.250, subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for admission are directed
does not provide a timely response, the propounding party “may move for an
order that … the truth of [the] matters specified in the requests be deemed
admitted.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).) There is no time
limit for such a motion, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id.,
§ 2033.280; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement
be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who fails to provide a
timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (a).) 
The court “shall”
make the order that the truth of the matters specified in the request be deemed
admitted unless the court “finds that the party to whom the requests for
admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a
proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial
compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c); see St. Mary v. Super. Ct.
(2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 762, 778-780.)
“It is mandatory
that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a
timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion [to deem
admitted the truth of the matters specified in the requests for
admission].”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2033.280, subd. (c).)
In Chapter 7 of
the Civil Discovery Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision
(d), defines “[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to
respond to or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.”  Where a party or attorney has engaged in
misuse of the discovery process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in
the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by
anyone as a result of that conduct.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (a).)
“[P]roviding untimely responses does not divest the
trial court of its authority [to hear a motion to compel responses].”  (Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc.,
supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at p. 407.) 
Even if the untimely response “does not contain objections [and]
substantially resolve[s] the issues raised by a motion to compel responses …
the trial court retains the authority to hear the motion.”¿ (Id. at pp. 408-409.)¿ This rule gives “an important incentive for parties to
respond to discovery in a timely fashion.”¿ (Id. at p. 408.)¿ If “the propounding party [does not] take the motion off
calendar or narrow its scope to the issue of sanctions,”
the trial court may “deny the motion to compel responses as essentially
unnecessary, in whole or in part, and just impose sanctions.”¿ (Id. at p. 409.) “The court may award sanctions
under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel
discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to
the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving
party after the motion was filed.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1348(a).) 
Discussion
On February 20, 2024, Defendant served
Plaintiff with written discovery, including Requests for Admission (Set One).
(Ballard Decl., ¶ 4; Exh. A.) Plaintiff has not responded. (Id., ¶ 6.)
 
No opposition has been filed. 
 
Defendant need not show anything more.
The Court GRANTS Defendant’s motion.
 
Given the relatively straightforward
nature of the motion, the Court sets sanctions in the amount of $500,
calculated based on two hours of attorney work, multiplied by reasonable
billing rate of $250.00 per hour.  (See Ballard
Decl., ¶ 8.)
 
Conclusion
 
The Court GRANTS Defendant’s Motion
for a Deemed-Admitted Order. 
 
The Court ORDERS that Plaintiff RALPH
PECK is DEEMED TO HAVE ADMITTED the truth of the matters specified in Requests
for Admission (Set One).

The Court ORDERS Plaintiff RALPH PECK
to pay sanctions under the Civil Discovery Act in the amount of $500 to
Defendant IRWIN LESLIE JASPER within 30 days of notice. 
 
Moving party is ORDERED to give
notice.
