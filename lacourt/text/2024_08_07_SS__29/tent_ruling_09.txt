 Case Number:  23STCV29908    Hearing Date:   August 7, 2024    Dept:  29 Ramirez v. Dewey
Case No. 23STCV29908
Motion to Compel Plaintiff
Esmirna Ramirez to Respond to Form Interrogatories (Set One)
Tentative
The
motion to compel is granted.
The
request for sanctions is denied.
Background
On December 7, 2023, Esmirna
Ramirez, Angel De Leon, and Josue Ramirez (collectively “Plaintiffs”) filed a
complaint against Olver Dewey (“Defendant”) and Does 1 through 100 for motor
vehicle negligence arising out of an accident occurring on May 15, 2022.
On January 29, 2024, Defendant filed
an answer.
On June
25, 2024, Defendant filed this motion to compel.  No opposition has
been filed.
Legal Standard
A party
must respond to interrogatories within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom interrogatories are directed
does not provide a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order
compelling response to the interrogatories. (Id., § 2030.290, subd.
(b).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial responses, and no
meet and confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2030.290; Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007)
148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules
of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who fails to
provide a timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).)
When a
party moves to compel initial responses to interrogatories, “the court shall
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)
against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the
motion], unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (c).)
In
Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010,
subdivision (d), defines “[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include
“[f]ailing to respond to or to submit to an authorized method of
discovery.”  Where a party or attorney has engaged in misuse of the
discovery process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in the amount of
“the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a
result of that conduct.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.020, subd.
(a).)
Discussion
On March 4, 2024,
Defendant served Plaintiff Esmirna Ramirez with form interrogatories.  (Opfell
Decl., ¶ 3 & Exh. A.)  Plaintiff has not responded.  (Id.,
¶ 6.)
Defendant need not show
anything more.  The motion to compel Plaintiff to respond to the form
interrogatories is GRANTED. 
The request for sanctions is
DENIED. 
Code of Civil Procedure
section 2023.010, subdivision (d), defines “[m]isuses of the discovery process”
to include “[f]ailing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of
discovery” but does not independently authorize sanctions for such conduct.
Code of Civil Procedure
section 2023.030 provides for the imposition of sanctions against any party or
attorney who engages in conduct that is a misuse of the discovery process “[t]o
the extent authorized by the chapter governing any particular discovery method or
any other provision of this title [the Civil Discovery Act].”  This
section, itself, does not independently authorize sanctions.
In the chapter of the
Civil Discovery Act governing interrogatories, the Legislature has authorized
sanctions in the context of a motion to compel initial responses “against any
party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes” the motion to
compel.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (c).)  Here,
however, Plaintiff has not opposed the motion.  Accordingly, no
sanctions are authorized.
Conclusion
The Court GRANTS Defendant
Oliver Dewey’s Motion to Compel.
The
Court ORDERS Plaintiff Esmirna Josue Ramirez to serve code compliant,
written, verified responses, without objection, to Defendant’s Form
Interrogatories (Set One) within 20 days of notice of this order.
The
Court DENIES Defendant’s requests for monetary sanctions.
Moving party is ORDERED to give notice.
