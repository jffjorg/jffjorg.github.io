And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the motion filed by Plaintiff's Counsel, Mitchell P. Beck, to be relieved as counsel. The motion was filed on July 15, 2024, and no opposition has been filed. The court has determined that the motion cannot be granted at this time because the necessary papers were not properly served on the Plaintiff 16 court days prior to the hearing, as required by law. The hearing is therefore continued for approximately 30 days to allow proper notice to be given to the Plaintiff. The moving counsel is directed to give notice of the continued hearing and to file proof of service with the court.
