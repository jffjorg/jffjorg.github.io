  - "It is mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion [to deem admitted the truth of the matters specified in the requests for admission]."

```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to deem the truth of the matters specified in the requests for admission as true. The plaintiff failed to respond to the requests for admission, and the defendant filed a motion to deem admitted. The judge finds that the plaintiff's failure to respond is a misuse of the discovery process and is ordering sanctions in the amount of $500. The judge also deems the truth of the matters specified in the requests for admission as true.
