Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment 
 
Tentative Ruling
 
The motion for summary judgment is DENIED.
 
Background 
 
On February
17, 2022, Diego Blanco (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Jingjing Li, DDS;
Western Dental Services, Inc. (collectively “Defendants”); and Does 1 through
20, asserting a cause of action for medical/dental negligence. 
On March
14, 2023, Western Dental Services, Inc. filed an answer to the complaint.
On June 6,
2023, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) against Defendants. 
On July 6,
2023, Defendants filed an answer to the First Amended Complaint.
On November
3, 2023, Defendants filed this motion for summary judgment. Plaintiff filed an
opposition on July 25, 2024. On August 2, 2024, Defendants filed a reply and one
objection to Plaintiff’s evidence.
Legal Standard
“The purpose of
the law of summary judgment is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut
through the parties’ pleadings in order to determine whether, despite their
allegations, trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute.” (Aguilar
v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) Code of Civil
Procedure section 437c, subdivision (c), “requires the trial judge to grant summary
judgment if all the evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably
deducible from the evidence’ and uncontradicted by other inferences or
evidence, show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that
the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” (Adler v.
Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.) “The function of
the pleadings in a motion for summary judgment is to delimit the scope of the
issues; the function of the affidavits or declarations is to disclose whether
there is any triable issue of fact within the issues delimited by the
pleadings.” (Juge v. County of Sacramento (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 59, 67,
citing FPI Development, Inc. v. Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 367,
381-382.)
As to each cause of
action as framed by the complaint, a defendant moving for summary judgment or
summary adjudication must satisfy the initial burden of proof by presenting
facts to show “that one or more elements of the cause of action ... cannot be
established, or that there is a complete defense to the cause of action.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2); see also Aguilar, supra, 25
Cal.4th at pp. 850-851; Scalf v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128
Cal.App.4th 1510, 1520.) Once the defendant has met that burden, the burden
shifts to the plaintiff to show that a “triable issue of one or more material
facts exists as to the cause of action or a defense thereto.” (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 437c, subd. (p)(2); see also Aguilar, supra, 25 Cal.4th at pp.
850-851.)
A plaintiff or cross-complainant
moving for summary judgment or summary adjudication must satisfy the initial
burden of proof by presenting facts to show “that there is no defense to a
cause of action if that party has proved each element of the cause of action
entitling the party to judgment on the cause of action.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
437c, subd. (p)(1).) Once the plaintiff or cross-complainant has met that
burden, the burden shift to the defendant or cross-defendant to show that a
“triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to the cause of action
or a defense thereto.” (Ibid.)
The party opposing
a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication may not simply “rely upon
the allegations or denials of its pleadings” but must instead “set forth the
specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact exists.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 437c, subds. (p)(1) & (p)(2). To establish a triable issue of
material fact, the party opposing the motion must produce substantial
responsive evidence. (Sangster v. Paetkau (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 151,
166.)
Courts “liberally construe the evidence in support of the
party opposing summary judgment and resolve doubts concerning the evidence in
favor of that party.” (Dore v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc. (2006) 39 Cal.4th
384, 389.)
Objections to Evidence
 
Defendants assert an objection to Exhibit B attached to Plaintiff’s
Declaration. Evidence
presented in support of, or in opposition to, a motion for summary judgment
must be admissible. (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (d); Perry v. Bakewell Hawthorne LLC (2017) 2 Cal.5th 536, 541-43.) The court
must “consider all of the
evidence set forth in the papers, except the evidence to which objections have
been made and sustained.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (c).). 
 
The objection is overruled.
Discussion
In this malpractice action, Defendants
move for summary judgment on one ground: that the parties executed an agreement
in which Plaintiff released all claims against Defendant.
Plaintiff received a dental
implant from Defendants on February 16, 2021. 
(Defendants’ Statement of Undisputed Material Facts [“DSUMF”], No.
1.)  Plaintiff complained of numbness,
and Defendants removed the implant on March 16, 2021.   (DSUMF,
No. 2.)
Plaintiff requested a
refund.  (DSUMF, No. 3.)  On November 30, 2021, Plaintiff signed a three-page
document entitled “Compromise and Release Agreement.”  (DSUMF, No. 4; Flatley Decl., Exh. D.)  The agreement provides, among other things,
that Defendants will pay Plaintiff $1,980 and Plaintiff will release all claims
against Defendants.  (Flatley Decl., Exh.
D., ¶¶ 1, 3.)  Defendants processed the
payment through a credit to Plaintiff’s credit card in December 2021.  (DSUMF, No. 7.)
Plaintiff testified that on
November 30, 2021, he was told by a representative of Defendants, Maria
Oropreza, that this was the last day that she would be in the office and that
he needed to come by the office before 6 pm that day to get a refund.  (Plaintiff’s Statement of Additional Material
Facts [“PSAMF”], No. 15.)  Plaintiff
arrived at Defendants’ office shortly before 6 pm, after work.  (PSAMF, Nos. 16-17.)  
Ms. Oropreza presented the
agreement to Plaintiff with the first and second pages folded back so that
Plaintiff could not read those pages. 
(PSAMF, Nos. 19, 24.)  Ms.
Oropreza told him that Defendants were going to process a refund and showed
Plaintiff where to sign (on page three of the agreement.  (PSAMF, Nos. 18-19.)  
Ms. Oropreza did not give
Plaintiff time to read the full agreement. 
(PSAMF, Nos. 20, 22, 24, 25.)  Mr.
Oropreza told him that it was not a release. 
(PSAMF, No. 21.)  At no time did
Ms. Oropreza explain that Defendants would provide only a partial refund (not a
full refund) or that there was a release in the agreement.  (PSAMF, Nos. 24, 30.)  Plaintiff signed the agreement relying on Ms.
Oropreza’s representations.  (PSAMF, No.
25.)
On this factual record, the
Court finds that there is a triable issue of material fact as to whether, when Plaintiff
signed the Compromise and Release Agreement, he gave his consent freely and
free from the taint of fraud by Defendants or mistake.  Accordingly, the Court cannot grant
Defendants’ motion for summary judgment.
The motion for summary
judgment is DENIED.
Conclusion
The Court
DENIES the motion of Defendants Jingjing
Li, DDS and Western Dental Services, Inc’s for summary
judgment.


Moving party is to
give notice.
