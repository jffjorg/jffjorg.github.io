Summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies Walmart's motion for summary judgment against TKE. The motion was filed in connection with Walmart's cross-complaint against TKE, which asserts seven causes of action, including breach of express contract, express contractual indemnity, breach of duty to defend, and declaratory relief. The Judge notes that there are two significant procedural issues with Walmart's motion: first, the motion is only for summary judgment, and not for summary adjudication, and second, Walmart has not specified the causes of action, claims for damages, or issues of duty that are the subject of the motion.

The Judge also recognizes that there are material factual disputes regarding the evidence presented by Walmart. Despite this, the Judge concludes that Walmart has not shown, with evidence, that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on its First Cause of Action (equitable indemnity) and its Second Cause of Action (comparative indemnity). Therefore, the motion is denied.
