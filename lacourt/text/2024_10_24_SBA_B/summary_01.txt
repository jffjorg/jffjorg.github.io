Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the defendant hospital's motion for summary judgment, finding that there are triable issues of material fact as to breach of duty and causation. The defendant hospital argued that it met the standard of care in the care and treatment of the decedent, Barbara Bechler, and that the attempted NG tube placement did not cause her death. However, the plaintiff's presented conflicting expert evidence, which created a triable issue of fact. The judge also found that the defendant hospital failed to meet its burden of showing that the plaintiffs' cause of action for wrongful death had no merit.
