And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel responses to discovery requests filed by defendant Chao-Tien "Stephen" Huang. The motion was filed after the defendant's counsel sent an email to the plaintiff's counsel on August 4, 2023, stating that the responses to the discovery requests were due on that date and had not been received. However, on March 13, 2024, the plaintiff served the defendant with responses to the discovery requests.

The judge finds that the motion is moot because the plaintiff has already responded to the discovery requests. Therefore, the judge denies the defendant's motion to compel responses to the discovery requests and also denies the defendant's request for monetary sanctions of $1,614.15. The judge notes that the defendant's counsel's hourly rate is reasonable, but the number of hours sought to be recovered is unreasonable.
