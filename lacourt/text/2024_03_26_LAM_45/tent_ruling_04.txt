(1)  
Motion
to be Relieved as Counsel for Mohammad Chaudry
(2)  
Motion
to be Relieved as Counsel for Bushra Chaudry
The court has
considered the moving papers.  No
opposition was received.
The court DENIES
WITHOUT PREJUDICE Counsel’s motions to be relieved as counsel. CRC, Rule
3.1362(d), which requires Counsel to serve other parties who have appeared in
the case, has not been complied with. 
 
Discussion
 Counsel has not served other parties who have
appeared in the case, specifically, defendants KTown Metro Plaza LLC,
Greenbridge Management Company, and Sean Hashem, as required under CRC, Rule
3.1362(d).
The court
therefore DENIES Counsel’s motions, without prejudice.
