Motion
to Compel Responses to Discovery Requests
 
The
court has considered the moving and opposition papers.
            Defendant
Chao-Tien “Stephen” Huang’s motion to compel responses from Plaintiff to Requests
for Production of Documents, Set One is MOOT because Plaintiff provided
responses to the discovery. 
Background
On September 15, 2022 Plaintiff Air Tiger Express (USA) Inc., filed their
complaint against Defendants Chao-Tien Huang AKA Stephen Huang (“Huang”), Eric
Wu (“Wu”), and Straight Forwarding, Inc. (collectively, “Defendants”) alleging
six causes of action: (1) Misappropriation of Trade secrets, Cal. Civ. Code
§3426 et seq., (2) Trespass, (3) Intentional Interference with Prospective
Economic Advantage, (4) Breach of Fiduciary Duty of Loyalty and Care, (5)
Breach of Comprehensive Computer Data Access and Fraud Act, Cal. Penal Code
§502(c), (e)(1), and (6) Violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, 18
U.S.C. §1030 et seq. On June 4, 2023 Huang served Request for Production, Set
One, on Plaintiff. On or about August 4, 2023 counsel for Defendant emailed
Plaintiff counsel stating responses had not been received and responses and
responsive documents were due, without objections by August 4, 2023. Attached
hereto and incorporated herein as Exhibit 2 is a true and correct copy of the
email from counsel for Defendant. As of the filing of this Motion, Air Tiger
Express (USA) Inc. still has not provided responses to Request for Production,
Set One, and this motion is necessary.
Legal
Standard
If a party to whom requests for production
of documents were directed fails to serve a timely response, the propounding
party may move for an order compelling responses and for a monetary sanction.
(CCP § 2031.300(b)-(c).) CCP § 2031.300 contains no time limit for a motion to
compel where no responses have been served. The propounding party need not
demonstrate good cause or satisfy a meet-and-confer requirement – all that
needs to be shown in the moving papers is that a set of requests for production
of documents was properly served on the opposing party, that the time to
respond has expired, and that no response of any kind has been served. (See Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v.
Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403-04.)
Discussion
            Defendant
moves to compel responses from Plaintiff to Requests for Production of Documents,
Set One.
            Defendant
establishes the following: On June 4, 2023, Defendant Chao-Tien “Stephen” Huang
served Plaintiff  with Requests for
Production of Documents, Set One. (Gross Decl., ¶ 2; Exh. 1.) On August 4, 2023,
Defendant’s counsel followed up with Plaintiff’s counsel by email regarding the
discovery requests, which were due on August 4, 2023. (Id. at ¶3, Exh. 2.) On March 13, 2024, Plaintiff served Defendant Huang
with responses to Requests for Production, Set One. (Opp. p. 1.) Therefore, Plaintiff requests that this matter be
taken off-calendar. (Id.)
            The
court finds that the instant Motion is MOOT because Plaintiff served discovery
responses on March 13, 2024.
            The
court therefore DENIES Defendant’s motion to compel responses from Plaintiff to
Requests for Production of Documents, Set One because it is MOOT. 
            Request for Monetary Sanctions
            Defendant
requests $1,614.15 in attorney’s fees and costs for monetary sanctions against
Plaintiffs for this motion. (Gross Decl., ¶ 5.) Defendant’s counsel’s hourly
rate is $450 per hour and Defendant seeks to recover 2.15 hours for this motion
and $161.65 in costs. (See id.)
            Defendant’s
counsel’s hourly rate is reasonable, but the number of hours Defendant seeks to
recover is unreasonable because Plaintiff did not file a reply and it accounts
for an hour responding. This is a basic motion and the issues raised in the
motion do not justify the amount Defendant seeks. 
            Plaintiff’s
opposition, filed on March 14, 2024, notified the court that it had served
responses and requested to take the matter off calendar. Defendant did not file
a reply. 
Since the Motion is MOOT and Defendant did
not file a reply still seeking sanctions, sanctions are not warranted at this
time. 
The court
therefore DENIES Defendant’s request for monetary sanctions. 
It is so
ordered.
