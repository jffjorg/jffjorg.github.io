Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has ruled on the demurrer filed by the cross-defendants, James H. Tuggle and Robert Conrad, to the cross-complaint filed by Reshma Kamath. The court has sustained the demurrer as to the sixth, seventh, eighth, tenth, and eleventh causes of action, and overruled it as to the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth causes of action.

The court found that Kamath failed to comply with Civil Code § 1714.10, which requires a prima facie showing of a reasonable probability of prevailing before filing a claim. The court also found that the sixth and seventh causes of action for racial and gender discrimination were insufficiently pleaded, as Kamath did not allege a prima facie case of discrimination.

The court sustained the demurrer to the eighth cause of action for unfair business practices, as Kamath did not allege a violation of an underlying law. The court sustained the demurrer to the tenth cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty, but granted leave to amend if legal authority exists to support the claim. The court sustained the demurrer to the eleventh cause of action for breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing, as it was superfluous and failed to allege damages.

The court granted Kamath leave to amend the tenth cause of action, assuming legal authority exists to support the claim. Kamath is ordered to file an amended pleading within 20 days of the ruling.
