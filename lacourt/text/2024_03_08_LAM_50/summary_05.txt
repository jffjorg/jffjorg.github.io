And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling on a petition for approval of a transfer of structured settlement payment rights. The petition was filed by American Annuity Funding, LLC, the transferee, and seeks approval to transfer 120 monthly life contingent payments from Robert Suarez, Jr., the payee. The transfer agreement complies with California Insurance Code section 10136, but the court notes that the agreement does not clearly show that it was signed by the payee. The court also notes that the transfer agreement contains a forum selection provision providing for jurisdiction to be in a court outside of California and a choice-of-law provision that provides for controlling law to be other than California law. The payee has not provided the required information about his minor children. The court finds that the transaction appears to be fair and reasonable and in the best interest of the payee, but denies the petition without prejudice pending further information and compliance with California Insurance Code section 10139.5.
