[1]The Court notes
that Plaintiffs also filed an “Opposition to Defendant Transunion Rental
Screening Solutions, Inc.’s Motion to Strike Plaintiffs’ Complaint.” However,
it does not appear that TURSS filed any motion to strike as to the FAC.
Thus, it appears this opposition may have been filed by Plaintiffs inadvertently.



[2]The Court notes
that Equity moves, inter alia, for “an order striking Paragraphs 5, 49,
and 73,” (Notice of Mot at p. 2:5-6) but such paragraphs do not solely seek
declaratory relief. As noted by Plaintiffs, “[a]
notice of motion to strike a portion of a pleading must quote in full the
portions sought to be stricken except where the motion is to strike an entire
paragraph, cause of action, count, or defense...” (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1322, subd. (a).) 


[3]In the first cause
of action for violations of the ICRAA, Plaintiffs allege, inter alia,
that Equity failed to comply with Civil Code section
1786.16. (FAC, ¶¶ 58-60, 62-63.)
