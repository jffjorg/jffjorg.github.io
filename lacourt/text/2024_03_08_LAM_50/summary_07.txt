Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court notes that the Plaintiffs filed an opposition to the Defendant's motion to strike, but it appears that the Defendant did not file a motion to strike as to the FAC. The Defendant, Equity, moves to strike paragraphs 5, 49, and 73, but these paragraphs do not solely seek declaratory relief. The Court also notes that the Plaintiffs' allegations of violations of the ICRAA (Interstate and Foreign Claims Registration Act) are relevant to the case. The Court will consider the opposition and the motion to strike at the future hearing.
