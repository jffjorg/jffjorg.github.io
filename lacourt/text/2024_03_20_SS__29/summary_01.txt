The Judge's tentative ruling is to grant the motion to set aside the default and default judgment filed by the Defendant, Discovery Days Early Learning Center, Inc. The motion was filed after the default was entered on April 28, 2022, but the Judge finds that the Defendant has presented sufficient evidence to support its claim of excusable neglect and a meritorious defense.

The Judge sets aside the default and default judgment and grants the Defendant leave to file an answer to the complaint within 7 days of the hearing. The Judge also orders the Defendant to pay the sanctions to the Plaintiff within 30 days of the hearing.
