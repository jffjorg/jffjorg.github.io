  Case Number:  20STCV39557    Hearing Date:   March 20, 2024    Dept:  29 Motion to Set Aside Default and Default Judgment filed by
Defendant Discovery Days Early Learning Center, Inc.
 
Tentative
The motion is granted.
Background
On October 15, 2020, Eric Renteria
(“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Paul Argueta, 85 Palmetto Drive LLC,
United Pacific Bank, and Does 1 through 25 for injuries Plaintiff allegedly
sustained on April 4, 2019, while Plaintiff was performing work at premises
owned or controlled by Defendants.
On January 26, 2021, Plaintiff amended the
complaint to name Mark A. Baratta as Doe 1 and Discovery Days Early Learning
Center, Inc. (“Defendant”) as Doe 2.
On March 16, 2021, Plaintiff filed a request
to dismiss his claims against United Pacific Bank.
On April 12, 2021, 85 Palmetto Drive, LLC and
Mark A. Barrata filed an answer to the complaint.  On March 11 and September 7, 2022, Plaintiff
filed requests to dismiss his claims against these defendants.
On April 28, 2022, default was entered
against Defendant. 
On September 26, 2022, Defendant filed a
motion to set aside the default.  The
motion was set for hearing on April 14, 2023. The Court’s tentative ruling was
to grant the motion, but when Defendant’s counsel did not appear at the
hearing, the Court took the motion off calendar.
On May 1, 2023, Defendant filed a motion for
reconsideration of the April 14 ruling, arguing that counsel failed to appear because
of a conflicting hearing and due to technical problems.  On May 26, 2023, the Court denied the motion,
reasoning that the Court made no ruling on April 14 and that the failure to
appear for oral argument is not a new or different fact or circumstance
warranting reconsideration.
 
On May 30, 2023, Defendant filed a new motion
to set aside the default.  The motion was
set for hearing on March 20, 2024.  On
March 5, 2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition and objection to some of Defendant’s
evidence.  No reply has been filed.
Objections
Plaintiff’s objections are OVERRULED.  With regard to the hearsay objections, the
statements are offered for a non-hearsay purpose (not for the truth of the
matters asserted).
Legal Standard
“The court may, upon any terms as may be
just, relieve a party or his or her legal representative from a judgment,
dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against him or her through his or
her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. Application for this
relief shall be accompanied by a copy of the answer or other pleading proposed
to be filed therein, otherwise the application shall not be granted, and shall
be made within a reasonable time, in no case exceeding six months, after the judgment,
dismissal, order, or proceeding was taken.” 
(Code Civ. Pro., §473, subd. (b).) 
To qualify for relief under section 473,
the moving party must act diligently in seeking relief and must submit
affidavits or testimony demonstrating a reasonable cause for the
default. (Elston v. City of Turlock (1985) 38 Cal.3d 227, 234.) 
“In a motion under section 473 the initial
burden is on the moving party to prove excusable neglect by a “preponderance of
the evidence. [Citations]”” (Kendall v. Barker (1988) 197 Cal.App.3d
619, 624.) “The moving party has a double burden: He must show a satisfactory
excuse for his default, and he must show diligence in making the motion after
discovery of the default.” (Id. at p. 625.)
In addition, and separately, even when there
is no statutory basis to set aside a default or default judgment, courts have “the
inherent authority to vacate a default and default judgment on equitable
grounds such as extrinsic fraud or extrinsic mistake.”  (Bae v. T.D. Service Co. (2016) 245
Cal.App.4th 89, 97; see also, e.g., Rappleyea v. Campbell (1994) 8
Cal.4th 975, 981-982.)
“Extrinsic fraud” generally involves some act
that kept the party seeking relief “in ignorance of the action or proceeding”
or “fraudulently prevented” the party “from presenting his claim or
defense.”  (Kulchar v. Kulchar
(1969) 1 Cal.3d 467, 471; see also, e.g., Bae, supra, 245 Cal.App.4th at
p. 97.)  
“Extrinsic mistake” is defined broadly and encompasses “almost any set of extrinsic circumstances
which deprive a party of a fair adversary hearing.”  (In re Marriage of Park (1980) 27
Cal.3d 337, 342; see also, e.g., Rappleyea,
supra, 8 Cal.4th at p, 981.)  There need not
necessarily be a mistake “in the strict sense.” 
(Park, supra, 27 Cal.3d at p. 342.)  But a mistake
is intrinsic, and not extrinsic, when “a party’s own negligence allows the …
mistake to occur.”  (Kramer v.
Traditional Escrow (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th 13, 29.)  Intrinsic mistakes relate to the merits of
the case, such that granting relief would improperly allow a party to
relitigate the case.  (Kulchar, supra,
1 Cal. 3d at pp. 472-73.)  Examples of
intrinsic mistakes, or intrinsic fraud, are perjury, failing to complete
discovery, or failing to prepare adequately for trial.  (Ibid.)
Courts apply a stringent,
three-part test for equitable relief pursuant to the inherent authority of the
court.  A party seeking relief on
equitable grounds must show (1) “a satisfactory excuse”; (2) “a meritorious
case”; and (3) "diligence in seeking” relief.  (Rappleyea, supra, 8 Cal.4th at p.
982; see also, e.g., Kramer, supra, 56 Cal.App.5th at p. 29; 1 Weil
& Brown, California Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The
Rutter Group 2023), ¶ 5:435.)
Discussion
The request for
statutory relief is denied.  Default was
entered against Defendant on April 26, 2022. 
This motion was filed more than six months later, in May 2023.  The request for statutory relief from the
default under Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b), is therefore
untimely and cannot be granted.
The request for
discretionary relief is granted.  Defendant
has presented sufficient evidence in support of each of the three required
elements – a satisfactory excuse, a meritorious case (defense), and diligence
in seeking relief.  (See Scott Decl., ¶¶ 2-6,
9; Agge Decl., ¶¶ 8, 10.)  Defendant also
attaches to the motion (as Exhibit 1) a copy of the answer to the complaint
that it seeks to file.
The Court also grants Plaintiff’s request for
sanctions.  Plaintiff is not responsible
in any way for the failure to Defendant to file a timely response to the
complaint and has now been forced to incur unnecessary expenses in connection
with these relief from default proceedings. 
Where relief is sought on a statutory basis, the power to award
sanctions is clear.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
473, subd. (c).)  The Court concludes that
it has at least the equivalent power to award sanctions when granting relief on
an equitable, non-statutory basis.
 
Sanctions are set in the amount of $1,000.
 
Conclusion
 
The Court GRANTS the motion to set aside the default on
equitable grounds.
 
The Court ORDERS that the default entered on April 26,
2022, is hereby SET ASIDE.
 
The Court GRANTS LEAVE to Defendant to file the Answer
attached to its moving papers within 7 days of the hearing.
 
The Court ORDERS Defendant to pay sanctions in the amount
of $1,000 to Plaintiff within 30 days of the hearing.
 
The OSC re Default Judgment is discharged.
 
The Court SETS a Trial Setting Conference in approximately
21 days.
 
Moving party is ordered to give notice.
