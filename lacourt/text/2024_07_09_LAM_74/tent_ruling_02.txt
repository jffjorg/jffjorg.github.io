 Case Number:  23STCV19069    Hearing Date:   July 9, 2024    Dept:  74 The People
of the State of California v. Ultimate Host, LLC, et al.
Plaintiff People of the State of
California’s Motions to Deem Matters Admitted and Requests for Monetary
Sanctions (x2)
 
BACKGROUND 
            Plaintiff
The People of the State of California (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint against
Defendants Ultimate Host, LLC dba The Nightfall Group (“UHL”); Mokhtar Jabli
(“Jabli”); Jungle Kerry, Inc.; 5554 Green Oak, LLC; Kirill “Kirk” Ayzenberg, as
Trustee of the Gabriel Mark Trust dated May 19, 2021, and DOES 1-50, inclusive,
asserting causes of action for public nuisance and unfair business practices.
Plaintiff alleges defendants operate unlawful party houses in violation of the
City of Los Angeles Short Term Rental Ordinance (“STR”). (Compl., ¶¶ 26-62.)
            On
March 22, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant Motions to Deem Requests for
Admissions Admitted and Request for Monetary Sanctions directed to defendants UHL
and Jabli, respectively. Neither defendant filed an opposition.
 
LEGAL STANDARD
¿¿            Pursuant to
Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280, subdivision (a), “[i]f a party to
whom requests for admission are directed fails to serve a timely response…[t]he
party to whom the requests for admission are directed waives any objection to
the requests, including one based on privilege or on the protection for work
product[.]”  (Code Civ. Proc.,, §
2033.280(a).)  
Where a party fails to
respond to requests for admissions, the propounding party may move for an order
that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in
the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction.  (Id.,
§ 2033.280 (b).)  
The court “shall” grant a motion to
deem admitted the matters specified in the requests for admissions, “unless it
finds that the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has
served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests
for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.” (Id.,
§ 2033.280(c).) 
            Finally,
“[i]it is mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction ... on the party
or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely response to requests for
admission necessitated [a] motion [to deem matters admitted].” (Id., §
2033.280(c).)
 
DISCUSSION  
            Plaintiff
moves for an order deeming matters referred to in two sets of Requests for
Admission (“RFAs”) admitted. One set of RFAs was served on UHL, the other on
Jabli.
Because
neither defendant filed an opposition, it is undisputed that Plaintiff served
each with RFAs on October 5, 2023 and Defendants’ final deadline to respond –
after several extensions – was February 5, 2024. (Tejeda-Rodriguez Decl., ¶¶ 4,
8- 9). 
            Plaintiff
acknowledges that Jabli served responses on February 7, 2024, but argues the
responses were woefully and unjustifiably insufficient. (Id., ¶ 10.) The
Court agrees.
It
is undisputed that neither Jabli nor UHL timely responded to the RFAs.
Because they did not, the matters referred to in the RFAs must be deemed
admitted unless (1) the untimely responses substantially complied with Code of
Civil Procedure sections 2033.210, 2033.220, and 2033.230, and (2) the
failure to respond was the result of mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or
excusable neglect. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280(a)(1).)
            Defendants
have not substantially complied, nor have they shown mistake, inadvertence,
etc.
On
February 7, two days after his responses were due, Jabli emailed counsel a link
to a Google document. (Id., ¶ 10.) The document’s first page, titled
“REQUESTS FOR ADMISSION”, contained only a numbered list that enumerated
eighteen single-word responses – either “Correct” or “False” – with a
nineteenth numbered response reading: “?”. (Ibid.) The responses are
unverified. They also do not specify whether they intend to respond to the RFAs
served on Jabli or served on UHL. The responses do not comply with any of the
formal or substantial requirements imposed by Code of Civil Procedure sections
2033.210-2033.240.
Also,
because Defendants filed no opposition, they made no showing of mistake, etc. –
a second necessary finding for them to avoid deemed admissions.
Defendants
have not made either showing required by section 2033.280(c). Plaintiff is
entitled to an order deeming the matters referred to in its RFAs admitted. 
 
Request for Monetary Sanctions 
            Where
a motion to deem matters admitted is granted, it is mandatory that the Court
impose a monetary sanction. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280(c).)
The
court orders each Defendant to pay Plaintiff’s counsel $720 (for a total of
$1,440) in attorney’s fees as discovery sanctions within 30 days.
 
CONCLUSION 
The
court deems admitted the matters referred to in the Requests for Admission (Set
One) subject to each of the instant motions.
Defendant
Mokhtary Jabli is ordered to pay $720 in sanctions to Plaintiff and/or its
counsel within 30 days of this order.
Defendant
Ultimate Host, LLC is ordered to pay $720 in sanctions to Plaintiff and/or its
counsel within 30 days of this order.
Plaintiff
shall give notice.
