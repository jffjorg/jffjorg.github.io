And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion filed by RRM Properties, Ltd. and Robertson’s Ready Mix, Ltd. (together "Defendants") for an order granting leave to supplement its list of expert witnesses. The motion seeks to designate Michael Orozco, a civil engineer employed by RRM, as an expert witness for examination at trial. The judge finds that the Defendants have not shown that they made good faith efforts to comply with the applicable statute, nor have they demonstrated that they exercised due diligence in designating expert witnesses. The judge also finds that the Plaintiff has relied on the original list of expert witnesses for a year and a half and that the Defendants will not be prejudiced if their motion is denied. The judge concludes that the Defendants' motion must be denied.
