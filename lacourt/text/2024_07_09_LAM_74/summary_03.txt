And here is the English summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the defendants, Steven Hargrove and Jessica Hargrove, ordering the plaintiff, Living the Dream, to return their security deposit of $117,000. The defendants had filed a motion to compel the plaintiff to return the security deposit or deposit it with the court, arguing that the plaintiff had failed to comply with California Civil Code section 1950.5, which governs a landlord's right to withhold a security deposit. The Judge found that the plaintiff had conceded its failure to provide a timely 1950.5 notice, and therefore, had forfeited its right to hold the deposit in the interim. The Judge granted the defendants' motion and ordered the plaintiff to deliver the balance of the security deposit to the defendants or their counsel within 30 days of the ruling.
