And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Meyers v. Mikail, granting the plaintiff's counsel's motion to be relieved from the case. The motion was procedurally proper and was filed using the correct judicial counsel forms. The counsel claimed that they had irreconcilable differences with the plaintiff, Meyers, regarding the handling of the case. The judge found this to be a valid basis for the counsel's withdrawal, and since there is no trial date set, the plaintiff would not be prejudiced as a result. The plaintiff does not oppose the withdrawal, and the judge has granted the motion.
