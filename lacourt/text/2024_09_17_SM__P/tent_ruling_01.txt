Meyers v. Mikail, Case No. 24SMCV00139  
Hearing date: September 17, 2024 
Plaintiff’s Counsel’s Motion to be Relieved 
 
Plaintiff Meyers sues for personal
injury alleging motor vehicle negligence. Attorneys Harry Nalbandyan, Gor
Asryan and Levin & Nalbandyan, LLP move to be relieved as counsel for plaintiff
Meyers. 
The motion is procedurally
proper and uses the correct judicial counsel forms – MC-051, MC-052, and
MC-053. Counsel cites irreconcilable differences between Meyers and Levin &
Nalbandyan, LLP regarding the handling of the action. See Nalbandyan form
MC-052 ¶2. This is a valid basis for counsel’s withdrawal under the
circumstances; moreover, Meyers would not be prejudiced as a result as a result
of the withdrawal. See Ramirez
v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.
App. 4th 904, 915. This is a relatively new case, which has only been at issue
since June 14, 2024. There is no trial date set.
Meyers does not oppose the
withdrawal. GRANTED.
