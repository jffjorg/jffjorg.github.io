 Case Number:  23STLC04564    Hearing Date:   October 26, 2023    Dept:  85 
Santander Consumer, USA Inc. v. Gloria De
Alvarado et al.,
23STLC04564
 
Tentative decision on application
for writ of possession: conditionally granted
 



            
            
Plaintiff Santander Consumer, USA Inc. (“Santander”) seeks a
writ of possession against Defendant Hugo Ramirez (“Ramirez”), individually and
doing business as King Auto (“King”), to recover a 2017 Toyota Sienna, VIN 5TDYZ3DC7HS892934
(“Vehicle”).   
            The
court has read and considered the moving papers[1] (no
opposition was filed) and renders the following tentative decision. 
 
            A. Statement of the Case
            1.
Complaint
            Plaintiff
Santander commenced this proceeding on July 19, 2023, against Defendants Gloria
De Alvarado (“Alvarado”), Ramirez, King, and California Department of Motor
Vehicles (“DMV”), alleging (1) claim and delivery of personal property for
pretrial writ of possession, and order directing transfer of personal property
and restraining order; (2) conversion; (3) quiet title; and (4) declaratory
relief.  The Complaint alleges in
pertinent part as follows. 
            Prior to the commencement of this action,
Alvarado and non-party Hamer Toyota (“Seller”)
entered into a contract to purchase the Vehicle (“Agreement”) which Seller then
assigned to Santander.  Pursuant to the
Agreement, Alvarado was required to pay $1,000
on July 7, 2021 and 72 monthly installments of $846.04 beginning July 13, 2021.  The Agreement required that Alvarado provide Seller, and therefore Santander, with a security
interest in the Vehicle and right to immediate possession should Alvarado default. 
            On April 23, 2022 and thereafter, Alvarado failed to pay the required monthly installment.  She owes $33,674.29 plus other charges
provided for in the Agreement.
            Alvarado has transferred the Vehicle to King for repairs and storage. 
Santander believes that Alvarado has
accrued $9,330 in unpaid labor, tow, and storage fees.  King has not
applied to the DMV for approval to conduct a lien sale, which Santander opposes.  King has
confirmed it still has the Vehicle but Santander’s demands for its return have
failed.
            Santander seeks recovery of the
Vehicle or the value thereof, a writ of possession directing Defendants to
transfer the Vehicle to Santander, $18,500 plus interest for damages for
conversion, punitive damages, judgment that the plaintiff is the legal owner, and
attorney’s fees and costs.
 
            2.
Course of Proceedings
            On
July 21, 2023, Santander served Defendant DMV with the Complaint and Summons.
            On
August 17, 2023, Department 26 (Hon. Mark Windham) ordered Defendant DMV
excused from future proceedings pursuant to a stipulation whereby it agreed to
abide by any determination of the court as to transfer of Vehicle title,
provided that all parties with an interest receive proper notice of the action.
            On
September 7, 2023, Santander served Defendant Ramirez with the Complaint, Summons
and moving papers by substitute service, effective September 17, 2023. 
            No
proof of service is no file for Defendant Alvarado. 
            
            B.
Applicable Law
            A
writ of possession is issued as a provisional remedy in a cause of action for
claim and delivery, also known as replevin. 
See Pillsbury, Madison
& Sutro v. Schectman, (1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 1279, 1288.  As a provisional remedy, the right to
possession is only temporary, and title and the right to possess are determined
in the final judgment.  
            A
writ of possession is available in any pending action.  It also is available where an action has been
stayed pending arbitration, so long as the arbitration award may be ineffectual
without provisional relief.  See CCP §1281.7. 
 
            1. Procedure
            Upon
the filing of the complaint or at any time thereafter, a plaintiff may apply
for an order for a writ of possession. 
Unlike attachment, where Judicial Council forms are optional, the
parties must use the mandatory approved Judicial Council forms in a claim and
delivery proceeding.  (Judicial Council
Forms CD-100 et seq.).
            A
plaintiff must make a written application for a writ of possession.  CCP §512.010(a), (b); (Mandatory Form
CD-100); CCP §512.010(a).  A verified
complaint alone is insufficient.  6
Witkin, California Procedure, (5th ed. 2008) §255, p.203.  The application may be supported by
declarations and/or a verified complaint. 
CCP §516.030.  The declarations or
complaint must set forth admissible evidence except where expressly permitted
to be shown on information and belief.  Id.
            The
application must be executed under oath and include: (1) A showing of the basis
of the plaintiff's claim and that the plaintiff is entitled to possession of
the property claimed.  If the plaintiff's
claim is based on a written instrument, a copy of it must be attached; (2) A
showing that the property is wrongfully detained by the defendant, how the
defendant came into possession of it, and, the reasons for the detention based
on the plaintiff’s best knowledge, information, and belief; (3) A specific description
of the property and statement of its value; (4) The location of the property
according to the plaintiff’s best knowledge, information, and belief.  If the property, or some part of it, is
within a private place which may have to be entered to take possession, a
showing of probable cause to believe that the property is located there; and
(5) A statement that the property has not been taken for (a) a tax, assessment,
or fine, pursuant to a statute, or (b) an execution against the plaintiff’s
property.  Alternatively, a statement
that if the property was seized for one of these purposes, it is by statute
exempt from such seizure.  CCP
§512.010(b).
 
            2. The Hearing
            Before
noticing a hearing, the plaintiff must serve the defendant with all of the
following: (1) A copy of the summons and complaint; (2) A Notice of Application
and Hearing; and (3) A copy of the application and any supporting declaration.  CCP §512.030(a).  If the defendant has not appeared in the
action, service must be made in the same manner as service of summons and
complaint.  CCP §512.030(b).
            Each
party shall file with the court and serve upon the other party any declarations
and points and authorities intended to be relied upon at the hearing.  CCP §512.050. 
At the hearing, the court decides the merits of the application based on
the pleadings and declarations.   Id.  Upon a showing of good cause, the court may
receive and consider additional evidence and authority presented at the
hearing, or may continue the hearing for the production of such additional
evidence, oral or documentary, or the filing of other affidavits or points and
authorities.  Id.  
            The
court may order issuance of a writ of possession if both of the following are
found: (1) The plaintiff has established the probable validity of the
plaintiff’s claim to possession of the property; and (2) The undertaking
requirements of CCP section 515.010 are satisfied.  CCP §512.060(a).  “A claim has ‘probable validity’ where it is
more likely than not that the plaintiff will obtain a judgment against the
defendant on that claim.”  CCP
§511.090.  This requires that the
plaintiff establish a prima facie case; the writ shall not issue if the
defendant shows a reasonable probability of a successful defense to the claim
and delivery cause of action.  Witkin,
California Procedure, (5th ed. 2008) §261, p.208.  A defendant’s claim of defect in the property
is not a defense to the plaintiff’s right to possess it.  RCA Service Co. v. Superior Court,
(1982) 137 Cal.App.3d 1, 3.
            No
writ directing the levying officer to enter a private place to take possession
of any property may be issued unless the plaintiff has established that there
is probable cause to believe that the property is located there.  CCP §512.060(b).  
            The
successful plaintiff may obtain a preliminary injunction containing the same
provisions as a TRO that remains in effect until the property is seized by the
levying officer.[2]  CCP §513.010(c).  
            The
court may also issue a “turnover order” directing the defendant to transfer
possession of the property to the plaintiff (See Mandatory Form CD-120). 
The order must notify the defendant that failure to comply may subject
him or her to contempt of court.  CCP
§512.070.  The turnover remedy is not
issued in lieu of a writ, but in conjunction with it to provide the plaintiff
with a less expensive means of obtaining possession.  See
Edwards v Superior Court, (1991) 230 Cal.App.3d 173, 178.
 
            3. The Plaintiff’s Undertaking
            Generally,
the court cannot issue an order for a writ of possession until the plaintiff
has filed an undertaking with the court (Mandatory Form CD-140 for personal
sureties).  CCP §515.010(a).  The undertaking shall provide that the
sureties are bound to the defendant for the return of the property to the
defendant, if return of the property is ordered, and for the payment to the
defendant of any sum recovered against the plaintiff.  Id. 
The undertaking shall be in an amount not less than twice the value of
the defendant's interest in the property or in a greater amount.  Id. 
The value of the defendant's interest in the property is determined by
the market value of the property less the amount due and owing on any
conditional sales contract or security agreement and all liens and encumbrances
on the property, and any other factors necessary to determine the defendant’s
interest in the property.  Id.
            However,
where the defendant has no interest in the property, the court must waive the
requirement of the plaintiff’s undertaking and include in the order for
issuance of the writ the amount of the defendant’s undertaking sufficient to
satisfy the requirements of CCP section 515.020(b).  CCP §515.010(b). 
 
            C. Statement of Facts
            King is a licensed automotive repair
dealer with California Bureau of Automotive
Repair License Number 289828.  Vargas Decl.,
¶5.
            On May 29, 2021, Alvarado entered into the Agreement to purchase the Vehicle.  Vargas Decl., ¶7, Ex. A.  Pursuant to the Agreement, Alvarado was required to pay $1,000 on July 7, 2021 and 72 monthly
installments of $846.04 beginning July 13, 2021.  Vargas Decl., ¶7, Ex. A.  The Agreement also required that the Vehicle
title reflect Seller’s security interest in the Vehicle.  Vargas Decl., ¶7, Ex. A.  In the event of default for failure to make a
payment on time, the Agreement gave Seller the right to assess late charges, accelerate
the amount owed, repossess the Vehicle peacefully, and sell it to apply the
sale price less expenses to the amount owed under the Agreement.  Vargas Decl., ¶7, Ex. A.  
            Seller assigned the Agreement to
Santander.  Vargas Decl., ¶7, Ex. A.  The Lien
and Title Information Report reflects
Santander’s interest as lienholder, as the Agreement requires.  Vargas Decl., ¶7, Exs. A-B.
            On April 23, 2022 and thereafter, Alvarado failed to pay the required monthly installment.  Vargas Decl., ¶8.  As of July 2023, Alvarado’s payment
history shows that she owes $31,637 in outstanding
principal, $1,608.25 in interest, $338.40 in late fees, and $90 in
miscellaneous charges for a total of $33,674.29.  Vargas Decl., ¶8, Ex. C.
            Alvarado has transferred the Vehicle to King for repairs and storage. 
Vargas Decl., ¶10.  Santander
believes that Alvarado has accrued $9,330 in
unpaid labor, tow, and storage fees. 
Vargas Decl., ¶10.  King failed to
timely send a notice of the stored Vehicle to Santander and apply for DMV
approval to conduct a lien sale.  Vargas
Decl., ¶11.  
            On July 25, 2023, Santander offered
to pay King the $2,750 maximum for repair and storage fees owed under Civil
Code section 3068.  Vargas Decl., ¶13,
Ex. D.  Santander made this offer despite
King’s failure to timely apply for a lien sale. 
Vargas Decl., ¶13, Ex. D.  Santander
also warned King of case law that rejecting the offer would waive the right to
recover on any repair and storage lien.  
Vargas Decl., ¶13, Ex. D.  King
rejected this offer.  Vargas Decl., ¶13.
            The June 2023 N.A.D.A. Auto Market
Report lists the average wholesale and retail values of the Vehicle as $18,500
and $23,750, respectively.  Vargas Decl.,
¶14, Ex. E.
            Santander’s offer letter lists
King’s address as 2301 W Martin Luther King Jr Blvd., Los Angeles, CA 90008.  Vargas Decl., ¶13, Ex. D.  Santander believes this is King’s principal
place of business and the current location of the Vehicle.  Vargas Decl., ¶18.
 
            D. Analysis
            Plaintiff
Santander applies for a writ of possession for the Vehicle against Defendant Ramirez,
individually and doing business as King.  No proof of service is on file for Defendant
Alvarado and her rights with respect to the Vehicle are not at issue in this
application.
 
            1.
Merits
            a.
Alvarado’s Breach of the Agreement
            The
Agreement required Alvarado to pay $1,000 on July 7,
2021 and 72 monthly installments of $846.04 beginning July 13, 2021.  Vargas Decl., ¶7, Ex. A.  In the event of default such as failure to
make a payment on time, the Agreement gave Seller the right to assess late
charges, accelerate the amount owed, repossess the Vehicle peacefully, and sell
it to apply the sale price less expenses to the amount owed under the
Agreement.  Vargas Decl., ¶7, Ex. A.  Seller then assigned its rights to Santander.  Vargas Decl., ¶7, Ex. A.  A Lien and Title Information Report reflects Santander’s
interest in the Vehicle.  Vargas Decl.,
¶7, Ex. B.
            Alvarado’s payment history shows
she defaulted in April 2022 and owes a total of
$33,674.29.  Mem. at 2; Vargas Decl., ¶8,
Ex. C.  
 
            b.
Storage and Repair Liens
            A
person performing repairs has a lien on a vehicle for the services and for
storage subject to limitations.  Civil
Code §3068(a).  The lien arises after a
written statement for charges is given to the vehicle’s registered owner or 15
days after the work or services are completed. 
Ibid.  
            A
lien in excess of $1500 for work performed, and in excess of $1025 for any
storage of a vehicle, is invalid unless written consent of the vehicle’s legal
owner or lessor was obtained before the work was performed or the storage
occurred.  Civil Code §3068(c)(1).  The maximum lien for storage of the vehicle
increases to $1,250 if an application for an authorization to conduct a lien
sale has been filed within 30 days after the commencement of the storage or
safekeeping.  Id.  The term “legal owner” is defined as a person
holding a security interest in a vehicle which is subject to UCC.  Civil Code §3067; Vehicle Code §370.   The lien shall be extinguished if the body
shop rejects an offer by the vehicle’s legal owner or lessor of the statutory
amount for payment of the mechanic’s lien for repair and/or storage of the
vehicle.  Universal CIT Credit Corp.
v. Rater, (1963) 214 Cal.App.2d 493, 495.
            The
lien also is extinguished unless the lienholder either applies to the DMV for
an authorization to conduct the sale or files a court action within 30 days
after the lien arises.  Civil Code
§3068(b)(1)(A).  The lienholder shall
apply to the DMV for authorization to conduct a liens sale for any vehicle with
a value more than $4000.  Civil Code
§3071(a).  For a vehicle valued at $4000
or less, the lienholder shall apply to the DMV for the names and addresses of
the registered and legal owners and notify them of a pending lien sale.  Civil Code §3071(a), (b).  If the DMV receives a timely Declaration of
Opposition form, it shall notify the lienholder within 16 days of receipt of
the form that a lien sale shall not be conducted unless the lienholder files an
action in court within 30 days of the DMV’s notice.  Civil Code §3071(d).  Any lien sale shall be void if the lienholder
does not comply with this requirement. 
Civil Code §3071(l).
             Santander asserts that Alvarado incurred
$9,330 in total repair and storage fees owed to King.  Vargas Decl.,
¶11.  Santander never authorized or
consented to these charges before they were incurred as required by Civil Code
section 3068(c)(1).  Mem. at
3.  The lien
limits under Civil Code section 3068(c)(1) apply.  
            King
has also failed to timely apply for DMV approval to conduct a lien sale.  Vargas Decl., ¶¶ 11, 13, Ex. D.  Santander still offered the $2,750 maximum
for repair and storage fees owed if King did timely apply for approval.  Mem. at 3; Vargas Decl., ¶13, Ex. D.  As Santander warned King, the failure to
accept this offer extinguished King’s lien. 
Mem. at 4-5; Vargas Decl., ¶13, Ex. D; Civil Code §3068(c); Universal
CIT Credit Corp. v. Rater, supra, 214 Cal.App.2d at 495.  
 
            c.
Conclusion
            Santander
has demonstrated its right to repossess the Vehicle.
 
            2.
Undertaking
            The
undertaking shall be in an amount not less than twice the value of the
defendant's interest in the property or in a greater amount.  CCP §515.010(a).  Because King’s storage and repair liens are
extinguished, it has no interest in the Vehicle.  No undertaking is required.
            
            3.
Order to Enter Private Property
            No
writ directing the levying officer to enter a private place to take possession
of any property may be issued unless the plaintiff has established that there
is probable cause to believe that the property is located there.  CCP §512.060(b).  
            The
application requests a writ authorizing the levying officer to enter 2301 W.
Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd., Los Angeles, CA 90008.  Santander presents evidence that this is the
Vehicle’s current location insofar as this is King’s
principal place of business and the recipient address on Santander’s offer
letter. Vargas Decl., ¶¶ 13, 18, Ex. D.  This suggests the address is commercial in
nature.  In any case, Santander has
justified a writ to enter a private residence at this address.  
 
            E.
Conclusion
            The
application for a writ of possession is granted
against Defendant King.  However,
Santander has not served Defendant Alvarado or provided her notice of this
application.  Sandander is directed to
notify Alvarado through service of process as a condition of the writ of
possession.  If Alvarado cannot be located
through due diligence, Santander may file a declaration to that effect and
provide her notice through mail or electronic service at her last known
address.
Once this condition is performed,
the writ of possession may issue.  Santander
has not submitted an order for writ of possession and must do so within two
court days of service on Alvarado or it will be waived.  The levying officer may enter King’s address
of 2301 W. Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd., Los Angeles, CA 90008, as well
as any commercial and public address, to seek
possession of the Vehicle.
