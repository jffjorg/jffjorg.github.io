  Case Number:  22STCP03019    Hearing Date:   October 26, 2023    Dept:  85 
Guy Atkinson
Construction v. California Occupational Safety and Health Appeals Board, 22STCP03019

Tentative decision on petition for writ of mandate:  denied



 
            
Petitioner Guy Atkinson Construction (“Atkinson”) petitions
for a writ of administrative mandate to compel Respondent California
Occupational Safety and Health Appeals Board (“Board”) to vacate its decision sustaining
a serious accident-related citation.
            The
court has read and considered the moving papers, opposition,[1]
and reply,[2]
and renders the following tentative decision. 
 
            A.
Statement of the Case
            1.
Petition
            Petitioner
Atkinson commenced this proceeding on August 11, 2022, alleging a cause of
action for administrative mandamus.  The
verified Petition alleges in pertinent part as follows.
            On
July 20, 2018, Real Party-in-Interest DOSH began an investigation at a worksite
located at Pomona, California.  As a
result of its inspection, on January 19, 2019, DOSH cited Atkinson for one
General citation (“Citation 1”) and a serious accident-related Citation 2 based
on various violations of Title 8 of the California Code of Regulations (“CCR”).
            Atkinson
filed a timely appeal, and an evidentiary hearing took place before the Board’s
Administrative Law Judge (“ALJ”).  On
October 20, 2021, the ALJ issued her decision affirming Citation 1 but granting
Atkinson’s appeal of Citation 2.  
            On
November 19, 2021, DOSH filed a petition for reconsideration.  On July 13, 2022, the Board issued its decision
sustaining Citation 2 and the accompanying penalty of $18,000.
            Atkinson
contends that the Board acted unreasonably and exceeded its powers contrary to
Labor Code section 6629.  The Board’s
findings do not support the decision and the findings are not based on
substantial evidence in the record.  The
Board also abused its discretion by failing to apply Board precedent in issuing
its decision.  Atkinson seeks a writ of
mandate setting aside and vacating the decision and awarding costs.
 
            2.
Course of Proceedings
            No
proof of service is on file.
            On
September 6, 2022, DOSH filed its Answer.
            On
September 8, 2022, the Board filed its Answer.
 
            B.
Standard of Review[3]
            Labor
Code[4]
section 6627 authorizes mandamus review of final Board decisions.  CCP section 1094.5 is the administrative
mandamus provision which structures the procedure for judicial review of
adjudicatory decisions rendered by administrative agencies.  Topanga Ass’n for a Scenic Community v.
County of Los Angeles, (“Topanga”) (1974) 11 Cal.3d 506, 514-15.  The court’s review is limited to whether (a)
the Board acted in excess of its powers, (b) the Board’s decision was procured
by fraud, (c) the decision was unreasonable, (d) the decision was not supported
by substantial evidence, and (e) if any findings of facts support the order or
decision under review.   §6629.  
            Judicial
review of the Board’s decision is governed by the substantial evidence
standard.  §6629(d); Overaa
Construction v. California Occupational Safety and Health Appeals Board,
(2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 235, 244-45. 
“Substantial evidence” is relevant evidence that a reasonable mind might
accept as adequate to support a conclusion (California Youth Authority v.
State Personnel Board, (“California Youth Authority”) (2002) 104
Cal.App.4th 575, 585) or evidence of ponderable legal significance, which is
reasonable in nature, credible and of solid value.  Mohilef v. Janovici, (1996) 51
Cal.App.4th 267, 305, n.28.  Under the
substantial evidence standard, the court must give the evidence every
reasonable inference and resolve all conflicts so as to support the agency’s
finding.  Gaehwiler v. California
Occupational Safety and Health Appeals Board, (“Gaehwiler”) (1983)
141 Cal.App.3d 1041, 1045, n. 2.  The
trial court considers all evidence in the administrative record, including
evidence that detracts from evidence supporting the agency’s decision.  California Youth Authority, supra,
104 Cal.App.4th at 585.           
The agency’s decision must be based on the evidence
presented at the hearing.  Board of
Medical Quality Assurance v. Superior Court, (1977) 73 Cal.App.3d 860,
862.  The hearing officer is only
required to issue findings that give enough explanation so that parties may
determine whether, and upon what basis, to review the decision.  Topanga, supra, 11 Cal.3d at
514-15.  Implicit in CCP section 1094.5
is a requirement that the agency set forth findings to bridge the analytic gap
between the raw evidence and ultimate decision or order.  Id. at 515.
            An
agency is presumed to have regularly performed its official duties (Evid. Code
§664), and the petitioner therefore has the burden of proof.  Steele v. Los Angeles County Civil Service
Commission, (1958) 166 Cal.App.2d 129, 137. 
The petitioner has the burden of demonstrating that the agency’s
findings are not supported by substantial evidence in light of the whole
record.  Young v. Gannon, (2002)
97 Cal.App.4th 209, 225; Gaehwiler, supra,
141 Cal.App.3d at 1045, n.2.  “[T]he
burden of proof falls upon the party attacking the administrative decision to
demonstrate wherein the proceedings were unfair, in excess of jurisdiction or
showed prejudicial abuse of discretion.  Afford
v. Pierno, (1972) 27 Cal.App.3d 682, 691.
 
            C.
Governing Law
            DOSH has primary responsibility
for administering and enforcing the California Occupational Safety and Health
Act of 1973 (“Act”), §6300 et seq. 
DOSH inspects workplaces and issues citations for violations of the
safety orders adopted by the Occupational Safety and Health Standards
Board.  §§ 142, 6307, 6308 et seq.
            The
Board is an independent adjudicatory agency responsible for resolving appeals
from citations and special orders issued by the DOSH.  §§ 6600, 6600.5; Rick's Electric Inc. v.
California Occupational Safety and Health Appeals Bd., (2000) 80
Cal.App.4th 1023, 1027.  DOSH has the
burden of proving a violation of a safety order by preponderance of
evidence.  RJN Ex. A (Barrett Business
Services, Inc., (2016) Cal/OSHA App. 315526582)
            There
shall be a rebuttable presumption of a “Serious” violation in a place of employment if DOSH
demonstrates that there is a realistic possibility that death or serious
physical harm could result from the actual hazard created by the
violation.  §6432(a)(2).  The demonstration of a violation is not
sufficient by itself to establish that the violation is Serious.  Id. 
The actual hazard may consist of, among other things, the existence in
the place of employment of one or more unsafe or unhealthful practices, means,
methods, operations, or processes that have been adopted or are in use.  Id. 
A realistic possibility is one within the bounds of reason, and not
purely speculative.  RJN Ex. C (United
Parcel Service, (2018) Cal/OSHA App. 1158285).
            If
DOSH establishes a presumption that a violation is Serious, the employer may rebut the presumption and establish
that a violation is not Serious
by demonstrating that the employer did not know and could not, with the
exercise of reasonable diligence, have known of the presence of the
violation.  The employer may accomplish
this by demonstrating both of the following: (1) the employer took all the
steps a reasonable and responsible employer in like circumstances should be
expected to take, before the violation occurred, to anticipate and prevent the
violation, taking into consideration the severity of the harm that could be
expected to occur and the likelihood of that harm occurring in connection with
the work activity during which the violation occurred; and  (2) the employer took effective action to
eliminate employee exposure to the hazard created by the violation as soon as
the violation was discovered.  §6432(c).  
Factors for determining whether an employer took all the
steps of a reasonable and responsible employer pursuant to section include but
are not limited to: (1) Training for employees and supervisors relevant to
preventing employee exposure to the hazard or to similar hazards; (2)
Procedures for discovering, controlling access to, and correcting the hazard or
similar hazards; (3) Supervision of employees exposed or potentially exposed to
the hazard; (4) Procedures for communicating to employees about the employer's
health and safety rules and programs; and (5) Information that the employer
wishes to provide, at any time before citations are issued, including (a) the
employer's explanation of the circumstances surrounding the alleged violative
events; (b) why the employer believes a serious violation does not exist; (c) why
the employer believes its actions related to the alleged violative events were
reasonable and responsible; and (d) any other information that the employer
wishes to provide.  §6432(b)(1).
            The
Board has held that if a hazard is in plain view, it necessarily constitutes a Serious violation because the
employer can detect it by exercising reasonable diligence.  RJN Ex. B (Home Depot USA, Inc.,
(2017) Cal/OSHA App. 15-2298).
 
            3. 8 CCR Section 3328
            All machinery and
equipment shall be designed or engineered to safely sustain all reasonably
anticipated loads in accordance with recognized engineering principles.  8 CCR §3328(a)(1).  It shall not be used or operated under
conditions of speeds, stresses, loads, or environmental conditions that are
contrary to the manufacturer's recommendations or, where such recommendations
are not available, the engineered design. 
8 CCR §3328(a)(2).
            Industrial trucks and
tow tractors shall be operated in a safe manner.  8 CCR §3650(t).  When provided by the industrial truck
manufacturer, an operator restraint system such as a seat belt shall be
used.  8 CCR §3650(t)(33).
            The
penalty for any Serious violation
of an occupational safety and health standard, order, or special order, is up
to $25,000 per violation, with a minimum base penalty of $18,000.  8 CCR §336(c)(1).  A Serious
violation is one that creates a realistic possibility of death or serious
physical harm.  8 CCR §334(c)(1).  
            If
the employer commits a Serious violation and DOSH has determined that the
violation caused death or serious injury, illness or exposure as defined
pursuant to section 6302, the penalty shall not be reduced except as based on
the size of the business per 8 CCR section 336(d)(1).  8 CCR §336(c)(2).  The penalty shall not exceed $25,000.  Id. 
To sustain an accident-related classification, the DOSH must demonstrate
a causal nexus between the violation and the serious injury.  RJN Ex. C (United Parcel Service).
 
            4.
Appeal Procedure
            Any
employer served with a citation by DOSH may appeal it to the Board within 15
working days.  §§ 6600, 6600.5, 6601,
6601.5, 6602.  The Board may appoint a
hearing officer or ALJ to hold a hearing, ascertain facts, try the issues in
the case, and make and file a finding, order, or decision.  §§ 6604, 6605, 6608.  
            The
hearing need not be conducted according to technical rules relating to evidence
and witnesses.  8 CCR §376.2.  Any relevant evidence shall be admitted if it
is the sort of evidence on which responsible persons are accustomed to rely in
the conduct of serious affairs, regardless of the existence of any common law
or statutory rule which might make improper the admission of such evidence over
objection in civil actions.  Id.
            If
the employer fails to notify the Board that it intends to contest the citation
within 15 working days, the citation shall be deemed a final order of the Board
and not subject to review by any court or agency.  §6601. 
The Board may extend the 15-day period for good cause.  Id. 

            Within
30 days after service of any final order or decision made and filed by the ALJ,
any party aggrieved thereby may, upon the grounds listed in section 6617,
petition the Board for reconsideration of the ALJ’s decision.  §6614. 
Parties waive any arguments not included in the petition.  §6618. 
Upon reconsideration, the Board may affirm, rescind, alter, or amend the
order or decision of the ALJ.  §§ 6620,
6621, 6622.  Any such decision shall be
in writing, signed by a majority of the Board, and shall state the evidence
relied upon and specify in detail the reasons for the decision.  §6623.
            A
party may seek judicial review of a final decision or order of the Board.  §6627. 
The party must file a petition for writ of mandate within “30 days after
a petition for reconsideration is denied” or “within 30 days after the filing
of the order or decision following reconsideration.”  §6627. 
The court may reverse the Board’s decision if (1) the Board exceeded its
powers, (2) the decision was procured by fraud, or (3) the decision was
unreasonable or not supported by substantial evidence in the record.  §6629.  
The Board’s findings and conclusions on questions of fact
are conclusive and are not subject to review. 
The court shall enter judgment either affirming or annulling the order
or decision, or the court may remand the case for further proceedings before the
appeals board.  §6630.
 
            D.
Statement of Facts
            1.
The Incident
            In
a DOSH incident report, Los Angeles County Fire Department (“LAFD”) employee
Danielle Smith reported the death of a construction worker at 9:35 a.m. on July
20, 2018.  AR 453.  The worker had fallen off the freeway wall
and was pinned under a large forklift. 
AR 453.  
            Atkinson’s
incident report identified the victim as Jordan Hoyt (“Hoyt”).  AR 473. 
He was operating the 1245
Xtream Forklift on the unpaved access road when the forklift randomly left
the roadway and fell into a ravine.  AR
473.  Atkinson found the forklift in an
upright position with Hoyt face down under the left rear wheel without a pulse.  AR 473. 
LAFD arrived at approximately 9:55 a.m. and confirmed Hoyt had no
pulse.  AR 473.  LAFD also found Hoyt’s seatbelt
unbuckled.  AR 473.  Fire rescuers arrived at 10:00 a.m. to help
pull Hoyt’s body out, which they finally did at about 11:00 a.m.  AR 473.
            An
eastbound picture of the accident site at 12:53 p.m. that day shows that the
wall on one side of the access road has three-feet-high footing.  AR 191-92, 395.  The other side is next to a ravine with grass
and trees.  AR 395.  A westbound picture shows where the forklift originally
was parked up the hill.  AR 201-02, 403.  Other pictures show where the forklift landed
in the ravine after the accident.  AR 194,
399.
            A
soil compaction test from the day of the accident reflects two ten-foot-wide tests
on areas that were respectively 56 and 33 feet long.  AR 467, 469. 
The calculated relative compaction for both was 91%.  AR 467, 469. 

 
            2.
The Citations
            On
January 19, 2019, DOSH issued two citations to Atkinson.  AR 1-7. 
Citation 1 was a General violation under 8 CCR section 3650(t)(33) for
failure to use an operator restraint system such as a seat belt when provided
with an industrial truck.  AR 6.  The recommended fine was $750.  AR 6.
            Citation
2 was a Serious Accident-Related violation of 8 CCR section 3328(a), use of
machinery under conditions of speeds, stresses, loads, or environmental
conditions that were contrary to the manufacturer's recommendations.  AR 7. 
The forklift’s manufacturer advised against its use on soft road edges
that could collapse under the forklift, which led to Hoyt’s death.  AR 7. 
The recommended fine was $18,000. 
AR 7.
 
            3.
The ALJ Hearing
            Atkinson
appealed the citations.  The Board’s ALJ conducted
a hearing on the appeal in February and June 2021.  AR 101, 485. 
Although Atkinson appealed both citations, it accepted Citation 1 and the
parties stipulated to focus on Citation 2. 
AR 112-13.  
            Atkinson’s
appeal of Citation 2 contended that the company did not violate the safety order,
the classification was incorrect, and the proposed penalty was unreasonable,
and it also raised 31 affirmative defenses. 
AR 114.  Atkinson stipulated that
the accident resulted in Hoyt’s death. 
AR 115.
            Pertinent
testimony is as follows.
 
            a.
Steven Honjio
            Steven
Honjio (“Honjio”) has been a DOSH senior safety engineer for 15-16 years.  AR 126. 
He has been involved in 1500 construction investigations, including a
lot of forklift investigations.  AR
129-30.  He is current on all mandated Cal/OSHA
training.  AR 129.
            Honjio
conducted the July 20, 2018
investigation into Hoyt’s accident, from the initial site visit with associate engineer
Mariaeva Garland to signing the citations. 
AR 130-31.  Atkinson was improving
the 10 Freeway near Cal Poly Pomona, which included building, widening, and
improving a retaining wall on either side. 
AR 132.  The accident site was
close to Cal Poly Pomona on the 10 freeway going east.  AR 132.
            Honjio spoke with
Atkinson Safety Manager Ryan Castillo (“Castillo”).  AR 145. 
Castillo said Hoyt usually wore his seat belt and was certified to
operate the forklift.  AR 148.  He was capable of driving it on rough
terrain.  AR 148.  Atkinson had never received any complaints
about safety or width of the access road, which had been present for the whole
project.  AR 148.
            Honjio also spoke
with Gary Payne (“Payne”), an Atkinson carpenter foreman and Gary’s direct
supervisor.  AR 150.  Payne had the authority to stop someone when
they were doing something unsafe, and he would do so.  AR 150. 
He reported that the forklift had been parked west of the site where the
ravine is.  AR 151.  Atkinson was moving it along the access road
to the east of the ravine for scaffolding work. 
AR 151.
            Honjio spoke to Atkinson
grading foreman Rex Henderson (“Henderson”), who confirmed that no employee complained
about the access road.  AR 152-53, 156.  No one told the crew to not use that access
road or that it was unsafe.  AR 153.  Henderson also explained that the road was
okay to him, and that Atkinson could not make it wider without throwing dirt
into the ravine and causing environmental issues.  AR 156.
            Honjio interviewed
Travis Todd Hicks (“Hicks”), another foreman, who said no rule prohibited any
equipment from being used on the access road. 
AR 157.  Someone could drive a
regular-sized truck like a Ford F-150 on it if so desired.  AR 157-58. 

            There was no witness
to the forklift rollover, but there were witnesses at the site.  AR 168.
            Honjio measured the
distance between the retaining wall and the beginning of slope down to the
ravine, which ranged from 10.5 to 12 feet.  
AR 172, 175.  At its narrowest
point, which was right above the forklift, the distance was 129 inches.  AR 172, 175, 202.  The parties later stipulated to the 129-inch
measurement.  AR 230-31.  The forklift was 99 inches wide, from the
outside of one back wheel to the other. 
AR 180.  This left 15 inches of
road on either side of the forklift.  AR
234-35.
            Honjio also checked
the slope of the access road.  AR 183. In
his experience, it was not sufficiently steep to make it prohibitive to drive
an all-terrain forklift.  AR 183-84.  The slope was well within the manufacturer’s
recommendations, but he wanted to document that he confirmed it.  AR 184. 
The height of the access road changed by 4.875 inches per 4-6 feet.  AR 188-89. 
This was well within the tolerances of the vehicle’s capability of
climbing up and down a road.  AR 189.
            Honjio also climbed
down the slope of the ravine to examine the forklift.  AR 199. 
The soil was not sandy.  AR
221.  It was loose and dry like a spoils
pile type of soil.  AR 199, 221.  It was also steep, which made it hard for
Honjio to walk or climb up and down.  AR
199.  One of the pictures depicts
this.  AR 207.  Nothing in the investigation notes suggests
that Atkinson had any work to do in the ravine. 
AR 278-79.
            Because the width of
the road was asymmetrical and the dirt was sloughed off, it appeared that the
side of the road collapsed from the weight of the forklift and fell into the
ravine.  AR 222, 227.  Ex. 7-24 shows this uneven edge.  AR 227. 
Ex. 7-22 shows Honjio measuring the access road right above where
the forklift landed, his foot on the tape measure to hold it flat on the edge
of the road.  AR 213-14, 220.  Because the tape measure does not bend left
or right, it is a straight edge that shows where the road collapsed just above where
the forklift landed.  AR 214.  
            There
is no indication that the road gave way within the 129-inch distance from the
wall out where the forklift wheels would be traveling.  AR 283. 
The forklift manufacturer’s manual does not say a rough terrain forklift
cannot drive on a compacted road like this access road.  AR 280. 
Rough terrain forklifts are meant for rough terrain like dirt
roads.  AR 280.  There was no indication of a load or
additional stress on the forklift from an outside force.  AR 289.
            The
manufacturer manual’s Safety section advises users to operate the forklift for
maximum stability to avoid injury.  AR
253-54.  Unstable forklifts can tip over
resulting in serious injury, death, or property damage.  AR 254. 
“Use caution around steep slopes, ridges, ditches and ravines.”  AR 254-255. 
“Stay away from soft edges that could collapse under the forklift.”  AR 255.  The manual says the forklift weighs 32,930
pounds, which is very heavy.  AR 260.  The parties stipulated that this was about
six times heavier than a pickup truck. 
AR 261-62.  
            Honjio
characterized the violation as Serious
and Accident-Related because it caused Hoyt’s death.  AR 264.
            
            b.
Ramsey Doumani
            Ramsey
Doumani (“Doumani”) spent ten years as a materials tester for Caltrans and
similar agencies through a private company. 
AR 497, 499, 502.  He prepared the
soil compaction tests in this case on a standard template based on a
ten-foot-wide sample.  AR 507-08.  These samples were at least ten feet wide but
could have been more.  AR 519, 544.  
            Average
compaction of these samples was 91%.  AR
543-44, 548.  Doumani was not qualified
to say whether the sample would be properly compacted for Caltrans
purposes.  AR 550.
 
            c.
Thia Nilawat
            Thia Nilawat
(“Nilawat”) is a DOSH associate safety engineer.  AR 557-58. 
He filled the intake form when Atkinson Area Safety Manager Kirk Hansen (“Hansen”)
called the office to report the incident on July 20, 2018 at 11:45 a.m.  AR 562. 
Hansen explained that Hoyt was operating a 12K extendable forklift and
either was close to the edge or the ground gave out and the forklift rolled and
crushed Hoyt underneath it.  AR 566.
            The description in
the form Nilawat filled out was not a conclusion about what caused the accident;
it was just a summary intake of information for initiating an
investigation.  AR 576.
 
            d.
Benjamin Turnham
            Benjamin
Turnham (“Turnham”) is an Atkinson heavy equipment mechanic.  AR 594-95. 
At the time of the accident, he had been part of the project for two
years.  AR 597.  
            Turnham
was familiar with Atkinson requirements for safe equipment operation.  AR 603. 
His responsibilities include ensuring no one violates safety rules.  AR 603. 
He never observed anyone break those rules in operating a forklift.  AR 603. 
If anyone had violated an operator’s manual rule while Turnham was on
site, he would have stopped that employee and prohibited them from
proceeding.  AR 613.  Before Hoyt’s death, the project had no
accidents.  AR 603-04.
            When
he arrived at the scene of the accident, he checked for injuries and tried to
understand what happened.  AR 596.  He then operated the forklift to relieve the
pressure on Hoyt’s body and help LAFD get the forklift off him.  AR 596.
            Turnham
wondered how the forklift fell down the slope. 
AR 596.  It did not look like a
section of the road had given way.  AR
596.  Turnham agreed that the forklift
left the roadway and fell into the ravine for “unknown reasons.”  AR 608-09. 
The road’s soil looked as compact as it always did.  AR 632. 
Atkinson did not have work to do in the ravine.  AR 604-05. 
While it was possible to drive off the edge of the access road, the soil
there was soft and not as compact.  AR
637, 639.  
            Turnham
had seen and driven various types of vehicles on that road, from pickup trucks to
oilers to 80-ton rough terrain cranes. 
AR 598.  The 100,000-pound crane
is wider, taller, and heavier than the 40,000-pound forklift at issue.  AR 599. 
The crane spans the full width of the access road, but neither it nor
the forklift had caused safety concerns. 
AR 601.  The forklift uses that
road every day.  AR 601.
            Hoyt
did not have his seatbelt when the forklift flipped or rolled off the road.  AR 621-22. 
He therefore was ejected and possibly thrown, landing where the
forklift’s left rear tire would land.  AR
621.
 
            4.
The ALJ’s Decision
            On
October 20, 2021, the ALJ issued her decision affirming Citation 1 and its $750
fine but granting the appeal as to Citation 2. 
AR 677, 682-83.  
            DOSH
had the burden of proving a violation by preponderance of the evidence.  AR 679. 
At issue was whether Atkinson operated the forklift under speeds,
stresses, loads, or environmental conditions contrary to the manufacturer’s
recommendations.  AR 678-79.  DOSH had not presented any evidence about
speed.  AR 680.
            As
to stress, the DOSH failed to present evidence establishing that the forklift was
operated under conditions of stress beyond the manufacturer’s
recommendations.  AR 680-81.  Honjio testified that operating a forklift
off-center could create stress and tip the forklift over.  AR 681. 
Because there were no witnesses to the accident, his testimony was
speculation.  AR 681.
            In
contrast, Turnham had observed the forklift on many occasions.  AR 681. 
He testified that the center of gravity would not cause the forklift to
flip unless someone drove it extremely
far sideways.  AR 681.  Heavier equipment had driven on the same road
with no problem.  AR 681. Turnham did not
observe part of the road collapse when he viewed the accident site.  AR 681.
            As to load, there was
no evidence that the forklift was carrying a load.  AR 681. 
Honjio testified there was no stress on the forklift from a load.  AR 681.
            As to environmental
conditions, DOSH alleged that the environmental condition was the road on which
the forklift was driven collapsed due to it being driven on soft edges of the road
that could collapse contrary to the manufacturer’s recommendations.  AR 681. 
Honjio conceded that this kind of rough terrain forklift is usually
driven on rough terrain like dirt roads. 
AR 681.  He testified the manual
said to stay away from soft edges that could collapse under the forklift.  AR 682. 
DOSH referred to, but did not produce, the manufacturer’s manual.  AR 681. 
As a result, Honjio’s testimony regarding the manufacturer’s
recommendations cannot be fully credited. 
AR 681.  
            Because the term “soft
edges” is ambiguous, DOSH had the burden of showing that the correct
interpretation is one Atkinson violated. 
AR 682.  Henderson told Honjio
that there had been no complaints about the access road.  AR 682. 
Hicks told Honjio that there were no limitations on what equipment to
use on the access road.  AR 682.  
            Honjio did not
testify to evidence of collapse due to soft soil.  AR 682. 
The average soil compaction was 91%, but nothing links that to the manufacturer’s
recommendation to avoid soft soil when driving the forklift.  AR 682. 
Accordingly, DOSH failed to establish that the forklift was operated
under conditions contrary to the manufacturer’s recommendations.  AR 682.
 
            5. The Petition
for Reconsideration
            On November 19, 2021,
DOSH filed a petition for reconsideration for the Board to reverse the ALJ’s decision
on Citation 2.  AR 693, 701.  DOSH argued that it had established that Atkinson
operated the forklift contrary to manufacturer recommendations.  AR 697. 
The fatal accident occurred when the forklift was driven on the soft
shoulder of the road, which collapsed and tipped the forklift into the
ravine.  AR 697.  Honjio and Turnham had concurred that the
edges beyond the width of the access road were soft.  AR 699. 
They agreed that driving on that soft edge could cause the forklift to
tip over.  AR 699.
 
            6. The Board’s
Decision
            On July 13, 2022, the
Board issued a decision reversing the ALJ’s decision for Citation 2.  AR 715-25.
 
            a. Violation of
8 CCR Section 3328(a)(2)
            To prevail, DOSH
needed to demonstrate that (1) the citation concerns a piece of machinery or
equipment; (2) the machinery was used or operated by Employer; and (3) the use
of the machinery was contrary to the manufacturer’s recommendations concerning
a speed, stress, load, or environmental condition.  AR 717. 
The first two elements were not at issue because the case concerns the
operation of Atkinson’s forklift operated by its employee Hoyt.  AR 717.
            As a threshold issue,
the third element requires competent evidence as to the contents of the
manufacturer’s recommendations.  AR
717.  Honjio read from the manufacturer’s
manual, but the ALJ’s decision chose not to fully credit this testimony due to DOSH’s
failure to move the document into evidence. 
AR 717-19.  
There is no
doubt that DOSH erred in not moving the manual into evidence.  AR 719. 
However, an administrative entity is not required to follow the rules of
evidence.  AR 719.  Section 6612 states that an order or decision
shall not be invalidated based on the admission of evidence not admissible
under the common law or statutory rules of evidence and procedure.  AR 719. 
The Board may rely on any relevant evidence that is of the sort on which
responsible persons are accustomed to rely in the conduct of serious
affairs.  AR 719.  Honjio read from what Atkinson had
specifically identified as the “Operator’s Manual” for the forklift.  AR 719-20. 
Atkinson did not contemporaneously object to Honjio reading the manual.  AR 720. 
The Board therefore credited his testimony as to the manual’s
contents.  AR 720.
            Because DOSH’s
petition focused on environmental conditions and not speeds, stresses, or loads,
the Board only addressed whether Atkinson operated the forklift in environmental
conditions contrary to those in the manual. 
AR 720.  The Board relied on the
plain language of the 8 CCR section 3328(a)(2). 
AR 720.  The word “environmental”
refers to circumstances, objects, or conditions by which one is
surrounded.  AR 720.  The word “condition” refers to a state of
being or attendant circumstances.  AR
720.  The plain meaning of the regulation
therefore focuses on one’s surroundings or surrounding circumstances.  AR 720.
            The Board found merit
in DOSH’s argument that Atkinson’s operation of the forklift near the access
road’s soft edges violates the manual’s order to stay away from soft edges that
could collapse.  AR 720-21.  According to Honjio, the manual states: “Stay
away from soft edges that could collapse under the forklift.”  AR 720. 
This identified the road’s soft edges as the relevant environmental
condition.  AR 720.  
            The testimony and
photographic evidence showed that the soft edge bordering at least one side of
the access road could collapse.  AR
721.  Although much of the road had been
compacted, the edge of the road near the ravine was not at all compacted.  AR 721. 
Honjio testified that soil above the forklift’s location after the
accident was loose and dry, like a spoils pile. 
AR 721.  The road was not
symmetrical, and it had appeared that portions of the road had previously
collapsed or sloughed off.  AR 721.  The photographs support this, and even
Turnham described the soil next to the road as soft soil.  AR 721. 
The condition of the soil on the slope down to the ravine also was
loose, dry, and sleep.  AR 721.  Thus, the access road was bordered on one
side by soft edges that could collapse in the area above where the forklift
came to rest.  AR 721.
            The question becomes
whether Hoyt operated the forklift too closely to that soft edge.  AR 721. 
The parties disputed whether the edge of the road collapsed from the forklift’s
weight.  AR 721.  The Board did not need to address this issue because
actual collapse of the road was not a prerequisite to a violation.  AR 721. 

The manufacturer’s
recommendation was to stay away from a soft edge that could collapse.  AR 721. 
For two reasons, the evidence shows that the forklift failed to stay
away from the soft edge of the access road that could collapse.  AR 721. 
First, the location of the forklift at the bottom of the ravine below
the soft edges of the road demonstrates that it came to close to a soft
edge.  Even assuming that the accident was
not caused by a collapse of soil, it could not have occurred if there was
adequate distance between the forklift and the edge.  AR 721. 
Second, the violation would have been established even if the accident
had not occurred.  AR 722.  It was virtually impossible for Hoyt to stay
away from the soft edges of the road.  AR
722.  The forklift had only 30 inches of
free space on its sides at the narrowest point of the access road.  AR 722. 
The forklift weighed over 30,000 pounds and fell to the bottom of the
ravine below the narrowest point of the road. 
AR 722.  At that point, the
forklift driver could not reasonably stay away from the soft edges that could
collapse.  AR 722.
            DOSH had established that
the use of the forklift was under environmental conditions contrary to the
manufacturer’s recommendations in that it failed to stay away from soft edges
that could collapse.  AR 722.  All elements of the violation had been
established and Citation 2 was affirmed. 
AR 722.
 
            b. Serious
Violation
            A rebuttable
presumption of a Serious violation exists if there is a realistic possibility
that death or Serious physical harm could result from the hazard created by
that violation.  AR 722.  An operator’s manual provides evidence of a
realistic possibility that deviation from it will result in serious physical
harm or death.  AR 722.  The parties also stipulated that Hoyt died as
a result of the accident.  AR 722-23.  This was sufficient to establish a rebuttable
presumption of a Serious violation.  AR
723.
            To rebut the
presumption, Atkinson needed to show pursuant to section 6432(c) that it took
all steps a reasonable and responsible employer in like circumstances should be
expected to take before the violation occurred, taking into consideration the
severity of the harm that could be expected to occur and the likelihood of that
harm occurring in connection with the work activity during which the violation
occurred.  AR 723.  It also needed to show that it took effective
action to eliminate employee exposure to the hazard created by the violation
once discovered.   AR 723.
            The widths of the
access road and of the forklift were in plain view.  AR 723. 
It should have been clear that the forklift could not keep away from the
soft edges.  AR 723.  It was also perceivable that those edges
could collapse.  AR 723.  The Board has long held that hazardous
conditions in plain view constitute Serious violations because the employer
could detect them through reasonable diligence. 
AR 723.  The Board affirmed
Citation 2’s classification as a Serious violation.  AR 723.
 
            c. Causal Nexus
            DOSH classified the
citation as Accident-Related.  AR
724.  A showing of a causal nexus between
the violation and a serious injury is required to classify the citation as
Accident-Related.  AR 724.  The violation need not be the only cause of
the accident, but DOSH must show that the violation more likely than not was a
cause of the injury.  AR 724.
            The parties do not
dispute that the forklift fell into the ravine. 
AR 724.  The forklift would not
have been found at the bottom of the ravine unless it was operated close to a
soft edge that could collapse.  AR 724.  Regardless of whether the edge collapsed, the
accident would not have occurred had adequate distance been maintained between
the forklift and the edge.  AR 724.  As such, the violation was a cause of the
injury and therefore Accident-Related. 
AR 724.  
 
            d. Foreseeability
            Atkinson invoked an
unforeseeable employee act as a defense. 
AR 725.  In addition to the
violation being unforeseeable, an employer must show that it (1) did not and
could not have known of the potential danger to employees, (2) exercised
adequate supervision to ensure safety; and (3) ensured employee compliance with
its safety rules.  AR 724.
            Atkinson did not show
that it could not have known of the potential danger to employees or that the
violation was unforeseeable.  AR
724.  The condition of the road and the
widths of the road and forklift were in plain view.  AR 724. 
Atkinson could have known of the hazard with the exercise of reasonable
diligence.  AR 724.  The violation was foreseeable, and the
defense fails.  AR 724.
 
            e. Penalty
            Because the accident
was Serious, the base penalty was $18,000. 
AR 724.  Because it was
accident-related, Atkinson could only have the penalty reduced based on its
business size.  AR 724.  Atkinson had over 100 employees and does not
qualify for reduction.  AR 724.  $18,000 was the appropriate penalty for
Citation 2.  AR 725.  
 
            E.
Analysis
            Petitioner
Atkinson contends that the Board’s decision is not supported by substantial
evidence.
 
1. The Finding of a 8 CCR Section 3328(a)(2) Violation Is
Supported by Substantial Evidence
Citation 2 alleged a Serious,
Accident-Related violation of 8 CCR section 3328(a)(2), which provides:
“(a) All machinery and equipment...(2) shall
not be used or operated under conditions of speeds, stresses, loads, or
environmental conditions that are contrary to the manufacturer’s
recommendations or, where such recommendations are not available, the engineered
design.”
A violation
of 8 CCR section 3328(a)(2) requires proof of three elements: (1) the citation
concerns a piece of machinery or equipment; (2) the machinery was used or
operated by the employer; and (3) the use of the machinery was contrary to the
manufacturer’s recommendations concerning a speed, stress, load or
environmental condition.  See AR
716-17.  The Board correctly noted that
there was no dispute regarding the first two elements.  The citation concerns a piece of machinery or
equipment (the forklift) that was operated by Atkinson’s employee.  The dispute pertained to the third element: whether
the use of the machinery was “under…environmental conditions that are contrary
to the manufacturer’s recommendations.”  
The Board found that, while DOSH failed to offer the
manufacturer’s manual into evidence, Honjio
read from the manual without objection and the Board could rely on his
testimony for its content.   AR 720.  The Board also
found that the term “environmental conditions”
was undefined and relied on its plain dictionary meaning.  The Board concluded that the word “environmental” refers to
circumstances, objects, or conditions by which one is surrounded.  AR 720. 
The word “condition” refers to a state of being or attendant
circumstances.  AR 720.  The plain meaning of the regulation therefore
focuses on one’s surroundings or surrounding circumstances.  AR 720. 
Finally, the Board concluded that the relevant
environmental condition is “the alleged soft edges that could collapse”.  AR 720.  Atkinson’s opening brief does not dispute any of these conclusions by
the Board.
In reply, Atkinson argues for the first time that DOSH
provided no evidence that the soft road edge is an environmental
condition.  Atkinson contends that it has
not waived this issue because its opening brief focuses on the arguments raised
by the Board in its decision.  Reply at
9.  This argument is spurious.  New evidence/issues raised for the first time
in a reply brief are not properly presented to a trial court and may be
disregarded.  Regency
Outdoor Advertising v. Carolina Lances, Inc., (1995) 31 Cal.App.4th 1323,
1333.
Atkinson also argues in reply that the ALJ found the term
“soft edges” to be ambiguous. Where language in a manufacturer’s recommendation
is ambiguous, DOSH has the burden of showing that its interpretation is
correct.  Washington Ornamental Iron
Works dba Washington Iron Works, Cal/OSHA 1226666, Decision After
Reconsideration (Dec. 28, 2020).  DOSH did
not satisfy its burden in proving that its interpretation of the term “soft
edges” is correct.  Reply at 10.  
Although Atkinson mentioned the ambiguity of “soft edges” in
its opening brief (Pet. Op. Br. at 10), it is unclear what Atkinson contends.  Neither the ALJ nor Atkinson ever stated that
the term had any different meaning than its ordinary dictionary meaning.  Both simply suggested that the road did not
have soft edges because Henderson stated that there had been no complaints,
Hicks stated there were no limits on the vehicles that could use the road, and
the road was compacted.  See AR
682.  This is not a dispute about what
“soft edges” means.
 
a. The
Access Road’s Soft Edge Could Collapse 
The Board
found that the testimony and photographic evidence showed that the soft edge
bordering at the side of the access road could collapse.  AR 721. 
Although much of the road had been compacted, the edge of the road near
the ravine was not at all compacted.  AR
721.  Honjio testified that soil above
the forklift’s location after the accident was loose and dry, like a spoils
pile.  AR 721.  The road was not symmetrical, and it had
appeared that portions of the road had previously collapsed or sloughed
off.  AR 721.  Even Turnham described the soil next to the
road as soft soil.  AR 721.  Thus, the access road was bordered on one
side by soft edges that could collapse in the area above where the forklift
came to rest.  AR 721.
            This
conclusion is supported by substantial evidence.  The
pictures and Honjio’s measurements demonstrate that the edge of the road near
the ravine did not have a uniform width.  AR
174-75, 417 (Ex. 7-12), 437 (Ex.
7-22), 441 (Ex. 7-24), 447 (Ex. 7-27).  The road varied in width from 10
¾ to 12 feet but was narrowest directly above the location where the forklift
came to rest in the ravine.  AR 175, 202,
234.  Honjio testified that the soil at
the edge was loose and appeared to be collapsing in places. AR 213-15 (“This is
right above the area where the forklift was in the ravine…”), 220-21 (“I’m on
the edge of the road. My foot is on the edge…”), 437 (Ex. 7-22).  The soil at the edge was dry and loose, like a
spoils pile.  AR 220-21.  “[I]t appeared that…the side of the road
closest to the ravine collapsed…I mean, the –the loose dirt was sloughed off
and it looks like parts of the road were taken out—that chunks were taken out.
It wasn’t totally…a symmetrical width of the road.” AR 222, 227, 437 (Ex. 7-22) 441 (Ex. 7-24).  Turnham, Atkinson’s heavy equipment mechanic, corroborated Honjio’s
statements. Turnham admitted that not all of the road’s edge was compacted and
the soil next to the road was “soft soil.” 
AR 639, 637, 471 (Ex. BB).  There
is substantial evidence that the access road was narrow at the point of the
forklift’s entry into the ravine and had soft edges that could collapse.  
Atkinson argues that the ALJ’s decision, not the Board’s
decision, was correct.  The ALJ relied on
Honjio’s witness interviews about the access road’s wide, safe, well-compacted condition.
Hicks, an Atkinson foreman, indicated that there is no limitation on what
equipment could be used on the access road.  The road was adequately compacted and there
were no indications of collapse at any point.  Turnham testified that he could not see a
section of the road that collapsed or gave way.  AR 596.  Henderson, Atkinson’s grading foreman,
indicated that there had been no complaints about the access road.  Turnham testified that that he saw the subject
forklift traveling that access road numerous times without an issue.  AR 598.  He had seen an 80-ton rough terrain Link-Belt
Crane travel the access road without any issues, which is wider, taller and
much heavier than the forklift Hoyt was driving.  AR 599. The Crane is approximately two feet
wider than the forklift and weighs approximately 60,000 pounds more. AR 598-601.  Pet. Op. Br. at 9-10.
Atkinson adds that DOSH witness Honjio admitted that he did
not see anything in the forklift’s manual that a rough terrain forklift cannot
drive on a compacted dirt road.  AR 279-80.
 He affirmed that rough terrain forklifts
are made to be driven on rough terrain, which includes dirt roads.  AR 280.  The rough-terrain forklift at issue also can drive
on steeply sloped roads.  AR 183-84.  The access road was not too steep for the
forklift as its slope measured a modest 4 and 7/8 inches per four to six feet.  AR 188-89.  Honjio confirmed that the forklift had at
least 15 inches of road on each side.  AR
234-35.  Finally, and perhaps most
importantly, Honjio confirmed the observation of Atkinson’s employees that there
was no evidence that the access road collapsed at the edges.  AR 283.  Because there was no
evidence that the roadway collapsed or that it was operated contrary to the
manufacturer’s recommendations, the ALJ correctly found that the Division had
not met its burden for Citation 2.  Pet.
Op. Br. at 10.
According to Atkinson, the Board merely speculated that the
road was not able to support the forklift and that the edges collapsed.  The evidence adduced showed that the roadway
was more than adequate to support the forklift's weight and width, and that the
roadway edges did not collapse.  Honjio
admitted that there
is no indication that the roadway gave way. AR 182-83, 203.  As such, DOSH did not prove that Atkinson
failed to operate the forklift according to the manufacturer’s recommendations
in violation of 8 CCR section 3328(a).  Pet. Op. Br. at 12-13.
Atkinson is
wrong.  There is no need to
resolve the parties’ dispute over whether the soft road edge collapsed from the forklift’s weight because
the Board found it unnecessary to do so.  AR
721.  DOSH was only required to demonstrate that the forklift operator drove too near an
edge that could collapse, not that the edge did collapse.  Atkinson’s opening brief does not dispute the
Board’s finding that the soft edge could collapse.
In reply, Atkinson tries to contest that the soft edge could
collapse.  It argues that all the
evidence proved that the road was adequately compacted and there was no
evidence that the road did collapse.  Henderson,
Atkinson’s grading foreman, indicated that there had been no complaints about
the access road. There was no visual or prior knowledge of any unsafe condition
or caving of the fully compacted roadway.  Hicks, another Atkinson foreman, indicated
that there is no limitation on what equipment can be used on the access
road.  While Honjio climbed down the
slope of the ravine to examine the forklift and he described the soil as “loose
and very dry, and it was quite steep”, this testimony is irrelevant as the
forklift driver was not driving in the ravine.  The Board claims that Honjio testified about
the soil at the edge of the road being “soft soil.”  But Honjio’s testimony also confirmed that
there was no evidence that the access road collapsed at the edges.  AR 283.  The Board’s opposition simply reiterates the
Board decision’s assumption that, because the forklift ended up in the ravine,
Atkinson must have violated a manufacturer’s recommendation to “stay away from
soft edges that could collapse under the forklift.” [5]
Again, Atkinson cannot contest that the soft edge could
collapse for the first time in reply.  See
Regency Outdoor Advertising v. Carolina Lances, Inc., supra,
31 Cal.App.4th at 1333.  In any event,
the overwhelming evidence is that the edges of the road were soft and capable
of collapsing.  The photographs alone
show as much.[6]
 
 
 
b. Hoyt Could Not
Avoid Traveling Too Near a Soft Road Edge
In addition to
finding that the soft road edge could collapse, the Board found that Hoyt
operated the forklift too closely to that soft edge.  AR 721. 
The manufacturer’s recommendation was to stay away from a soft edge that
could collapse, and the evidence showed that the forklift failed to do so.  AR 721. 
The fact that the forklift was found at the bottom of the ravine below
the soft edges of the road demonstrates that it came too close to the soft
edge.  AR 721.
The Board
further found that it was virtually impossible for Hoyt to stay away from the
soft edge of the road.  AR 722.  The forklift had only 30 inches of free space
on its sides at the narrowest point of the access road.  AR 722. 
At the narrowest point of the road where the forklift fell, the forklift
driver could not reasonably stay away from the soft edges that could
collapse.  AR 722.  DOSH had established that the use of the
forklift was under environmental conditions contrary to the manufacturer’s recommendations
in that it failed to stay away from soft edges that could collapse.  AR 722. 
All elements of the violation had been established and Citation 2 was
affirmed.  AR 722.
This conclusion is supported by substantial evidence.  This
was a matter for which no direct evidence of the accident’s mechanism was
required.  The forklift would not have been found at the bottom of the
ravine unless it came too near a soft edge. 
Hoyt did not, and could not, follow the
manufacturer’s recommendation to “[s]tay away from soft edges that could
collapse under the forklift.”  Honjio
testified that the width of the access road was at its narrowest just above
where the forklift came to rest in the ravine, measuring at approximately 129
inches. AR 172, 175, 202, 230-35, 275, 295.  The forklift itself was 99 inches wide,
meaning that it only had 30 inches of free space on each side, or 15 inches per
side at the narrowest point.  AR 179-180,
234-35.  The forklift also weighed more
than 30,000 pounds, as much as multiple pickup trucks.  AR 260-61.  Given these facts, Hoyt could not
realistically stay away from the soft edge of the road.  As the Board’s opposition argues (Opp. at 17),
it does not matter whether the road collapsed, only that Hoyt drove too near an
edge that could collapse and it was virtually
impossible for Hoyt to do so.  The fact
that forklifts and other vehicles had traveled the same route without accident
does not undermine the conclusion that Hoyt could not avoid traveling too near
an edge that could collapse.
In reply, Atkinson argues that there is no evidence that Atkinson
acted contrary to the manufacturer’s recommendation when Hoyt drove the
forklift on the well-compacted access road.  There was no evidence from the fact that the
forklift had 15 inches of road on each side was insufficient.  Reply at 9. 
The Board claims that the forklift could not have been found at the
bottom of the ravine unless it came too near a soft edge that had the
possibility of collapse.  There was no
evidence that Hoyt drove too close to an edge of the road that could collapse.  Reply at 11.
Again, this is a new issue raised for the first time in
reply and is waived.  See Regency
Outdoor Advertising v. Carolina Lances, Inc., supra, 31 Cal.App.4th
at 1333.  In any event, no witness needed
to opine that a 15-inch gap is insufficient for a heavy forklift traveling on a
compacted access road with a soft edge and a steep ravine.  The issue is whether Hoyt had room to stay
away from the soft edge and the leeway of only 15 inches is not sufficient to
do so as a matter of law.
 
            2.
The Board’s Finding that the Violation Was Serious Is Supported by
Substantial Evidence
The Board
noted that a rebuttable presumption of a Serious violation exists if there is a
realistic possibility that death or Serious physical harm could result from the
hazard created by that violation.  AR
722.  An operator’s manual provides
evidence of a realistic possibility that deviation from it will result in serious
physical harm or death.  AR 722.  The parties also stipulated that Hoyt died from
the accident.  AR 722-23.  This was sufficient to establish a rebuttable
presumption of a Serious violation.  AR
723.
            To rebut the
presumption, Atkinson needed to show pursuant to section 6432(c) that it took
all steps a reasonable and responsible employer in like circumstances should be
expected to take before the violation occurred, taking into consideration the
severity of the harm that could be expected to occur and the likelihood of that
harm occurring in connection with the work activity during which the violation
occurred.  AR 723.  It also needed to show that it took effective
action to eliminate employee exposure to the hazard created by the violation
once discovered.   AR 723.
            The widths of the
access road and of the forklift were in plain view.  AR 723. 
It should have been clear that the forklift could not keep away from the
soft edges.  AR 723.  It was also perceivable that those edges
could collapse.  AR 723.  The Board has long held that hazardous
conditions in plain view constitute Serious violations because the employer
could detect them through reasonable diligence. 
AR 723.  The Board affirmed
Citation 2’s classification as a Serious violation.  AR 723.
Atkinson argues that the Board reached this conclusion in
error.  Under section 6432, it is
insufficient for DOSH to show a violation of 8 CCR section 3328(a)(2) to meet its burden.  Rather, DOSH had an obligation to
present evidence demonstrating a “realistic possibility that death or serious
physical harm could result from the actual hazard created by the violation.” MDB Management Inc., Cal/OSHA App. 14-2373, DAR (Apr. 25,
2016). The term “realistic possibility” means that DOSH’s demonstration must be
within the bounds of reason and not purely speculative. Langer Farms, LLC, Cal/OSHA App.
13-0231, DAR (Apr. 24, 2015).  DOSH cannot
meet its burden without some satisfactory evidence demonstrating the types of
injuries that could result and the possibility of those injuries occurring.  MDB
Management Inc., Cal/OSHA
App. 14-2373, DAR (Apr. 25, 2016).  Pet.
Op. Br. at 13; Reply at 12-13.
Atkinson contends that there was no realistic possibility of death or
serious physical harm from an actual hazard rather than pure speculation. The
Board merely speculated that the roadway was not able to support the forklift
and that the edge collapsed without the support of any evidence. The evidence showed
that the roadway was more than adequate to support the forklift’s weight and
width and that the roadway edge did not collapse.  Pet. Op. Br. at 13-14.
The Board’s opposition rebuts Atkinson’s argument.  Honjio
testified that he is current on all DOSH-mandated training.  AR 129. 
Therefore, he is competent as a matter of law to establish each element
of a serious violation.  §6432(g).  Honjio classified the citation as Serious
because the accident caused Hoyt’s death.  AR 264-65.  Honjio also read an excerpt from the manufacturer’s
manual that the failure to follow the rules therein could lead to death or
serious injury: “Operate the forklift for maximized stability. Unstable
forklifts can tip over resulting in death, serious injury, or property damage.”
 AR 252-56.  This created a
presumption that the violation was Serious. 

To overcome this
presumption, Atkinson was required to demonstrate that it “did not know and
could not, with the exercise of reasonable diligence, have known of the
presence of the violation.”  §6432(c). Atkinson did not, and could
not, make this showing.  The narrow width of the access road and
the forklift’s narrow 15 inches per side of leeway were in plain view.  The soft road edges that could collapse were obvious.   Given the dimensions of the road and the
forklift, it should have been clear that the forklift could not avoid the soft road
edges that could collapse.  An employer cannot rebut the presumption when
the hazardous condition is in plain view. Home Depot USA, Inc., Cal/OSHA App. 15-2298, Decision After
Reconsideration (May 16, 2017).
The Board’s decision that the
violation was Serious is supported by substantial evidence. 
 
3. The Board’s Finding That the Violation Was Accident-Related
Is Supported by Substantial Evidence
The Board
noted that a showing of a causal nexus between the violation and a serious
injury is required to classify the citation as Accident-Related.  AR 724. 
The violation need not be the only cause of the accident, but DOSH must show
that the violation more likely than not was a cause of the injury.  AR 724.
            The parties do not
dispute that the forklift fell into the ravine. 
AR 724.  The forklift would not
have been found at the bottom of the ravine unless it was operated close to a
soft edge that could collapse.  AR
724.  Regardless of whether the edge
collapsed, the accident would not have occurred had adequate distance been
maintained between the forklift and the edge. 
AR 724.  As such, the violation
was a cause of the injury and therefore Accident-Related.  AR 724.
As the Board’s opposition argues (Opp. at 20), Atkinson does
not contest the Accident-Related classification.[7]  
            4. Atkinson Did Not Show That the
Accident Was Unforeseeable
The Board
noted that Atkinson invoked an unforeseeable employee act as a defense.  AR 725. 
In addition to the violation being unforeseeable, an employer must show
that it (1) did not and could not have known of the potential danger to
employees, (2) exercised adequate supervision to ensure safety; and (3) ensured
employee compliance with its safety rules. 
AR 724.
            The Board found that Atkinson
did not show that it could not have known of the potential danger to employees
or that the violation was unforeseeable. 
AR 724.  The condition of the road
and the widths of the road and forklift were in plain view.  AR 724. 
Atkinson could have known of the hazard with the exercise of reasonable
diligence.  AR 724.  The violation was foreseeable, and the
defense fails.  AR 724.
Atkinson argues that the Board’s decision inappropriately
shifts the burden from DOSH to it..  The
Board claims that Atkinson did not establish the accident was unforeseeable yet
did not hear any of the evidence at the hearing.  The ALJ found that there was no realistic
possibility of death or serious physical harm because the violation was
unforeseeable. A violation “is deemed unforeseeable, therefore not punishable”
if the following four criteria exist: (1) the employer ensured its employees’
compliance with its safety rules; (2) the employer did not know, or could not
have known, of the potential danger to employees; (3) the employer exercised
supervision adequate to assure safety; and (4) the violation was unforeseeable.
Gaehwiler v. Occupational Safety
& Health Appeals Bd., 141 Cal. App. 3d 1041, 1045 (1983); Newbury Electric Co., Ameron Inc., Pole
Products Div., Cal/OSHA App. 77-677, Decision After Reconsideration
(Feb. 26, 1980).)  Pet. Op. Br. at 14.
Atkinson argues that Hoyt’s death was unforeseeable.  The company ensured that its employees’
compliance with safety rules in the safe operation of equipment.  AR 332. 
There was no work that was needed to be performed in the ravine.  AR 334. Atkinson did not and could not have
known that an employee would drive off the access road.  Atkinson never received any complaints about
safety of the access road, and that road had been there throughout the
project.  AR 48.  The soil on the access road was well compacted
and no one ever complained about the road being too narrow.  AR 48. 
Hoyt was a certified
forklift operator who was capable of driving the forklift through rough
terrain. AR 48.  There was no way to know
why the forklift left the roadway.  Pet. Op. Br. at 14-15; Reply at 13-14.
The Board did not improperly shift
the burden to Atkinson.  The lack of foreseeability
is an affirmative defense which Atkinson had the burden of proof.  The facts relied upon by Atkinson do not
undermine the plain nature of the hazard. 
The access road was compacted but had soft edges that could give
way.  The road was narrow and only
allowed the forklift 15 inches of leeway. 
The hazard was obvious and the fact that no one had complained about the
road and no previous accidents had occurred does not entirely negate the risk
or make the accident unforeseeable. 
Atkinson did not meet its burden for this affirmative defense.

Conclusion
The Petition is denied. 
The Board’s counsel is ordered to prepare a proposed judgment, serve it
on Atkinson’s counsel for approval as to form, wait ten days after service for
any objections, meet and confer if there are objections, and then submit the
proposed judgment along with a declaration stating the existence/non-existence
of any unresolved objections.  An OSC re:
judgment is set for December 12, 2023 at 1:30 p.m.
