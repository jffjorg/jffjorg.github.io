And here is the summary in English text:

This tentative ruling is based on information presented before the court. The Department of Industrial Relations, Division of Occupational Safety and Health (DOSH) joins the Board's opposition, despite it not being statutorily authorized. The court considers DOSH's joinder, which was timely filed and supported by a short memorandum. The court also grants the Board's request for judicial notice of its decisions in three previous cases.

The court addresses several disputes, including whether Atkinson violated labor code and whether the road collapse was accident-related. The court finds that Honjio testified about the road collapse, and that Turnham testified that he did not see any collapsed roadway at the accident site. The court also notes that Hansen reported the accident to DOSH, and that Nilawat testified about the C-36 forms.

The court concludes that the road collapse was caused by the weight of the forklift, and that the violation was not accident-related because it was not serious. The court admonishes Atkinson's counsel to follow the court's directions in all future writ proceedings.
