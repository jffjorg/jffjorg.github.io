And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling addresses the defendant's failure to meet his burden of proof in the case. The defendant has not provided sufficient evidence to show that service of process was properly conducted. The Judge notes that even if the defendant had provided the required declarations, it would not have cured the problem. The Judge also concludes that the two cases are related and that a notice of related case must be filed, as per California Rules of Court Rule 3.300. The Judge references a 1992 case, Bein v. Brechtel-Jochim Group, Inc., which holds that the service of process statutes should be liberally construed to effectuate service and uphold jurisdiction.
