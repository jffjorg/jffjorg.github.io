And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the defendant's motion to reconsider the court's order denying the defendant's motion to set aside default judgment. The defendant failed to provide new evidence to overcome the presumption that service was proper. The court had previously denied the defendant's motion to set aside default judgment because the defendant failed to provide evidence to overcome the presumption that service was proper. The defendant has now brought forth a new motion to reconsider, citing new evidence, but the court finds that the new evidence is not new evidence, but rather evidence that could have been presented earlier. The court finds that the defendant failed to meet its burden of showing that the service was improper. Therefore, the motion for reconsideration is denied.
