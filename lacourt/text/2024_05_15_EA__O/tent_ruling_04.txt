Brechtel-Jochim Group, Inc. (1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 1387, 1388 [“The service of process statutes are to be liberally

substituted service as well as to personal service. To be constitutionally
sound the form of substituted service must be reasonably calculated to give an
interested party actual notice of the proceedings and an opportunity to be heard,
in order that the traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice
implicit in due process are satisfied.”].)
