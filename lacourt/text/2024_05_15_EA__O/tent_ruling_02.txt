[1] The court requests Plaintiff file a proposed order. 
 


[2] Though not found in the complaint, the promissory
note (as attached to the instant motion) provides that the agreement was
between Defendant and AKBB Holdings, LLC, and Wong signed the promissory note
as managing member and manager of the LLC. 


[3] According to the opposition, Defendant did not
receive a proposed stipulation because of technological problems. 


[4] To the extent that Defendant attempts to argue that he
need not label the documents because there are less than 20 pages of documents
produced, as noted by Plaintiff in reply, the number of documents produced is
irrelevant to be a statutorily complaint response. 
 


[5] Though Plaintiff also argues that it may be the
complete text, but that sanctions should still be imposed. 
 


[6] For clarity, Plaintiff seeks $3,461.65 against the
firm and an additional $1,000 against Defendant.
