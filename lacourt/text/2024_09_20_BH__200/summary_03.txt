And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the Defendant school district's motion to bifurcate the issues of liability and damages at trial. The Defendant argued that bifurcation was necessary to avoid prejudice and to prevent the jury from being swayed by the emotional testimony of the Plaintiffs. However, the Judge found that the Plaintiffs' testimony would already be emotional and would not be unduly prejudicial to the Defendant. The Judge also noted that the jury would already be aware of the tragic circumstances of the case through voir dire and mini-opening statements, and that the Defendant's proposed bifurcation would not save significant time or create efficiencies. The Judge concluded that the motion was denied because the Defendant did not demonstrate that bifurcation was necessary to avoid prejudice or to promote justice.
