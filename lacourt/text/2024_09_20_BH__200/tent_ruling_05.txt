[1]  As stated in Leger:
“Defendants contend
imposition of liability in such a situation would contravene section
845…Defendants argue that
imposing a duty on the District is tantamount to requiring them to have a
police or security force…However, section
845 was designed to
protect from judicial review in tort litigation the political and budgetary
decisions of policy-makers, who must determine whether to provide police
officers or their functional equivalents….Plaintiff's complaint does not plead
that defendants should have provided police personnel or armed guards. There are measures
short of the provision of police protection services, such as posting
warning signs or closer supervision of students who frequent areas of known
danger, that might suffice to meet the duty of reasonable care to protect
students…We cannot assume as a matter of law, and without proof on the
question, that defendants' duty could be satisfied only by the provision of a
police protection service.” Id. 202
