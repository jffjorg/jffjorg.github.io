Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is considering a motion to compel production of an unredacted email between Christopher Lacey of GSC and Jennifer Perrone of Del Reka. GSC claims that the email is protected by a common interest privilege, but the judge finds that GSC has not met its burden to justify the claim of privilege. The judge rules that GSC waived the privilege by sharing the email with a third party without a clear agreement on confidentiality. The judge also orders GSC to produce a privilege log showing all documents withheld from production on this basis. The judge sustains the objections to the referee's recommendation and grants the motion to compel production of the unredacted email.
