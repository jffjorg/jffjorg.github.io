**Tentative Ruling**

The court is considering a case involving a complaint filed by a plaintiff against defendants, a school district. The plaintiff claims that the defendants failed to provide adequate protection to students, resulting in harm. The defendants argue that imposing liability on them would contravene section 845 of the law, which protects policy-making decisions from judicial review.

The court notes that the plaintiff's complaint does not request that the defendants provide police personnel or armed guards. Instead, the court suggests that the defendants could have taken other measures to meet their duty of reasonable care to protect students, such as posting warning signs or increasing supervision in areas of known danger.

The court cannot assume, as a matter of law, that the defendants' duty could only be satisfied by providing a police protection service. The court will need further evidence on this question before making a final decision.

**Supporting Citation:** Leger, 202 Cal.App.3d at 1463.
