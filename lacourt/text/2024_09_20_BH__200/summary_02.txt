As for the English text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling addresses several motions in limine and a motion to bifurcate the trial. Golden State Cider (GSC) seeks to exclude various pieces of evidence, including distribution agreements, financial information, and statements made by Wine Warehouse (WW) employees. WW, on the other hand, seeks to exclude GSC's expert witness, Kimberly Clements, and evidence of GSC's communications with subsequent distributors.

The Judge grants some of the motions, including GSC's motion to exclude evidence of WW's financial condition and to bifurcate the trial until there is an award of actual damages and a finding of fraud, oppression, or malice. The Judge also denies some of the motions, including GSC's motion to exclude evidence of WW's potential acquisition in 2013 and WW's motion to exclude evidence of GSC's distribution industry expert, Kimberly Clements.

The Judge rules that the statements made by Peter Elzer are relevant to GSC's claims and that the video made by Mike Richards regarding WW's facilities is inadmissible hearsay. The Judge also rejects GSC's arguments that whether there is a "pattern" of conduct is relevant here and that conduct involving WW and third parties is necessary to hear to establish any basis for punitive damages.
