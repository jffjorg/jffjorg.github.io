And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to change the venue of the case from Los Angeles County to Ventura County. The defendant, Robert Joseph Smith, resides in Ventura County and the accident at issue allegedly took place in that county. The judge found that the defendant is entitled to have the action tried in the county of his residence, unless the action falls within some exception to the general venue rule. The plaintiff, Mauricio Portan Navarrete, failed to provide any evidence that would justify trying the case in Los Angeles County, and the judge found that the defendant's motion was procedurally correct and timely filed. The judge ordered the plaintiff to pay any transfer fees and costs associated with the change of venue.
