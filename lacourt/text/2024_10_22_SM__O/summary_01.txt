And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion to quash service of summons and vacate judgment. The defendants, Brian Lam, Ji Wi, and Lina Chen, had filed their answer to the complaint without simultaneously filing a motion to quash service of summons, thus waiving any argument that service was not properly effected. The judge has also denied the defendants' request to set aside the judgment pursuant to CCP § 473(b), arguing that service was not valid and excusing their absence at the bench trial due to financial inability to hire an attorney. The judge has ruled that the defendants' claim of financial inability to hire an attorney does not constitute excusable neglect and that they were still able to attend the trial in person as self-represented litigants. The judge has also noted that the defendants failed to demonstrate that they were unexpectedly placed in a situation to their injury without fault or negligence of their own, as required by CCP § 473(b).
