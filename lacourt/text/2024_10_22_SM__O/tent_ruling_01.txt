TENTATIVE
RULING
            Defendants
Brian Lam, Ji Wi, and Lina Chen’s Motion to Quash Service of Summons and Vacate
Judgment is DENIED.  Defendants generally
appeared by filing their answer, without an accompanying motion to quash, on 3-20-24,
thus Defendant’s waived any right to object to service. Defendants do not
provide any evidence sufficient for the Court to vacate the 6-28-24 Judgment
pursuant to CCP § 473(b). 
 
REASONING
Motions to Quash Service of Summons
in an Unlawful Detainer (“UD”) case must be made withing 5 days of service of
Complaint. (See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1167.3, 418.10.) The Motion to Quash
Service of Summons in a UD case May be filed simultaneously with demurrer,
answer, or motion to strike, BUT cannot be filed after answering, striking, or demurring because defendant has
appeared, thereby subjecting himself to the jurisdiction of the Court. (See Code
Civ. Proc., §§ 418.10(e), 1014.)
 
Defendants Brian Lam, Ji Wi, and
Lina Chen (collectively, “Defendants”) answered the Complaint on 3-20-24. (See
3-20-24 Answer.) Defendants filed their motion to quash on 8-7-24, after
answering the Complaint, thus the Motion to Quash musth be denied pursuant to
CCP §§ 418.10(e) and 1014.
 
Additionally, Defendants request
the Court to set aside the judgment pursuant to CCP § 473(b) arguing service
was not valid, and excusing their absence at the 6-24-24 Bench Trial due to
“the prohibitive cost of such trial, as Defendants could not afford legal
representation.” (See Lam, Wi, Chen Decl., p. 9:2–3.)
 
"The court may, upon any terms
as may be just, relieve a party or his or her legal representative from a
judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against him or her
through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect."
(Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 473, subd. (b).) "Surprise" is defined as
"some condition or situation in which a party to a cause is unexpectedly
placed to his injury, without any default or negligence of his own, which
ordinary prudence could not have guarded against." (Hodge Sheet Metal
Products v. Palm Springs Riviera Hotel (1961) 189 Cal.App.2d 653, 656-57
(quotations omitted).) "Excusable neglect is neglect that might have been
the act or omission of a reasonably prudent person under the same or similar
circumstances." (Ebersol v. Cowan (1983) 35 Cal.3d 427, 435.)
"The party seeking relief under section 473 must also be diligent . . . in
no case exceeding six months, after the judgment, dismissal, order or
proceeding was taken." (Zamora v. Clayborn Contracting Group, Inc.
(2002) 28 Cal.4th 249, 258.) “Where the mistake is excusable and the party
seeking relief has been diligent, courts have often granted relief pursuant to
the discretionary relief provision of section 473 if no prejudice to the
opposing party will ensue." (Ibid.)
 
            Defendants
answered the Complaint on 3-20-24, without simultaneously filing a motion to
quash service of summons, thus waiving any argument that service was not
properly effected. Defendants answer thus counts as a general appearance which
waives objections to defective service. (See Fireman's Fund Ins. Co. v.
Sparks Construction, Inc. (2004) 114 Cal.App.4th 1135, 1147 [“A defendant
has a right to demand that process be issued against him in the manner provided
by law, but if process is not so issued and he appears generally without making
objection, such appearance, being the purpose of the process, confers
jurisdiction of the person and the court is empowered to act in the premises”].)
 
            Additionally,
the Defendants claim of financial inability to hire an attorney does not
constitute excusable neglect under CCP § 473(b). Defendants were still able to
attend the trial in person as self-represented litigants, which they failed to
do, obtain “a waiver of the fee by petition in forma pauperis, . . . consult[]
attorneys in legal aid offices or proceed[] in propria persona.” (Carrasco
v. Craft (1985) 164 Cal.App.3d 796, 805–806; see also McClain v. Kissler
(2019) 39 Cal.App.5th 399, 415 [“Courts neither act as guardians for
incompetent parties nor for those who are grossly careless of their own affairs....
The only occasion for the application of section 473 is where a party is
unexpectedly placed in a situation to his injury without fault or negligence of
his own and against which ordinary prudence could not have guarded”]; Burnete
v. La Casa Dana Apartments (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 1262, 1267 [“when [defendant]
asserts that he was entitled to a set aside because of a mistake of law, what
he really means is not that he made a mistake of law when he attempted to put
on his case at trial, but that he made a mistake in judgment when he chose to
act as his own attorney”].)
 

            Thus,
Defendants Motion to Set Aside the 6-28-24 Judgment pursuant to CCP § 473(b) is
DENIED.
