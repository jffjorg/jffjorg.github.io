Roles:
  - Judge: Hon. Jill Feeney
Significant Statements:
  - "A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters." (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co.)
  - "A demurrer for uncertainty will be sustained only where the complaint is so bad that defendant cannot reasonably respondâ€”i.e., he or she cannot reasonably determine what issues must be admitted or denied, or what counts or claims are directed against him or her." (Weil & Brown, Civil Procedure Before Trial)
  - "The objection of uncertainty does not go to the failure to allege sufficient facts." (Brea v. McGlashan)
  - "It goes to the doubt as to what the pleader means by the facts alleged." (Brea v. McGlashan)
  - "Such a demurrer should not be sustained where the allegations of the complaint are sufficiently clear to apprise the defendant of the issues which he is to meet." (People v. Lim)
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has sustained the demurrers filed by Pension Plan and Burton, dismissing the First Amended Complaint without prejudice. The court finds that the complaint is uncertain and fails to state a cause of action against Pension Plan and the DBRAT Trust. The court also finds that the plaintiffs lack standing to assert claims against Pension Plan. The court sets an OSC Re: Imposition of Sanctions for June 28, 2024, and orders the plaintiff to be prepared to discuss the issue of leave to amend at the hearing.
