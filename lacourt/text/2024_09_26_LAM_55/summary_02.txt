Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has deferred its decision on the plaintiffs' motion for trial preference pending a hearing and argument. The plaintiffs, represented by Maria Del Socorro Sanchez-Quezada as guardian ad litem for her minor daughters, are seeking to exercise the trial preference due to the age of the plaintiffs, Alondra Gonzalez and Candelaria Gonzalez, who are under the age of 14. However, the defendants have argued that the plaintiffs have failed to meet their evidentiary burden of showing that they meet the requirements of section 36, subdivision (b) of the California Code of Civil Procedure.

The court has concluded that the plaintiffs have failed to establish the factual prerequisites under section 36, subdivision (b) due to the lack of admissible evidence. The court has also rejected the defendants' argument that granting the motion would deny them due process, citing the mandatory nature of the statutory right to trial preference.

The court has also addressed the defendants' argument that the plaintiffs lack a substantial interest in the case, citing the legislative intent behind the statute. Finally, the court has deferred its decision pending the hearing and argument on the motion, requesting that the plaintiffs provide admissible evidence of their age and clarify their intentions regarding the dismissal of named defendants who have yet to be served.
