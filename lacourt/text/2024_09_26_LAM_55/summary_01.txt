Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court is considering Defendant Elliot Lander's motion to compel further responses from Plaintiff Gary Stiffelman and request sanctions. The parties dispute whether certain documents exchanged between Stiffelman's attorneys and Calmwater/USRECH are protected by the common interest doctrine and attorney-client privilege. The Court concludes that this dispute may be best suited for a discovery referee and proposes continuing the motion for several months. The Court also orders that the parties meet for a status conference after the Riverside lawsuit is complete to discuss an appropriate referee to work with the parties on this issue. The Court denies the motion with respect to certain requests for production and sanctions, and continues the motion on the common interest doctrine issues.
