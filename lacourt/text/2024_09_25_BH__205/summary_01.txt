And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer to and motion to strike the complaint filed by State Farm General Insurance Company. The demurrer argues that the complaint does not state a cause of action. However, the judge finds that State Farm failed to meet and confer with the plaintiffs before filing the demurrer and motion to strike. Specifically, State Farm's counsel only sent an email to the plaintiffs' counsel, without attempting to call or propose dates and times for a call. The judge finds these efforts to be insufficient and continues the hearing to October 15, 2024, to allow the parties time to meaningfully meet and confer and to file proof of their efforts.
