The Judge, Edward B. Moreton, Jr., has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Mehrad Farkhan, K.D., et al. v. Felix Adalberto Sanchez, et al. (Case No. 23SMCV05621). The case arises from a car accident involving Mehrad Farkhan and Felix Adalberto Sanchez, in which Claimant Alia Farkhan, a minor, was a passenger. The parties have agreed to a settlement of $15,000, which represents the payment of the policy limits of all liability insurance policies covering Sanchez. The settlement is being apportioned as follows: 25% for attorneys' fees and 75% for the balance of the settlement proceeds available to Claimant.

The Judge has denied the petition for expedited approval of the minor's compromise, citing the failure of the attorney's declaration to comply with California Rules of Court, Rule 7.955(c). The declaration did not address the factors enumerated in the rule, and the Judge has denied the petition without prejudice to the renewal of the application with a code-compliant declaration.

The Judge's ruling is based on the laws and statutes governing the approval of minor's compromises, including California Probate Code sections 2504, 3500, 3600 et seq., and California Code of Civil Procedure section 372. The Judge has also cited case law, including Pearson v. Sup.Ct. (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th 1333, Goldberg v. Sup. Ct. (1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 1378, and Curtis v Estate of Fagan (2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 270.
