  Case Number:  23SMCV03641    Hearing Date:   September 25, 2024    Dept:  205    Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles – West District  Beverly Hills Courthouse / Department 205  RONY SHRAM, et al.,   Plaintiffs, v.  STATE FARM GENERAL INSURANCE COMPANY, et al.,    Defendants.    Case No.:  23SMCV03641    Hearing Date:  September 25, 2024   [TENTATIVE] order RE:   DEFENDANT state farm general    insurance company’s demurrer    to and motion to strike    complaint      This hearing is on Defendant State Farm General Insurance Company’s demurrer to and motion to strike the Complaint.   Code Civ. Proc. §§ 430.41 and 435.5 requires that before the filing of a demurrer or motion to strike, the moving party “shall meet and confer in person or by telephone” with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer or motion to strike for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer or motion to strike.  (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 430.41(a), 435.5(a).)  The parties are to meet and confer at least five days before the date the responsive pleading is due. (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 430.41(a)(2), 435.5(a)(2).)  Thereafter, the moving party shall file and serve a declaration detailing their meet and confer efforts. (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 430.41(a)(3), 435.5(a)(3).)   State Farm submits the Declaration of Matthew F. Batezel which fails to show the parties met and conferred by telephone or in person.  Rather, Counsel attests he sent an email to Plaintiffs’ counsel.  Counsel did not attempt to call Plaintiffs’ counsel or otherwise propose dates and times for a call.  It is not even clear whether the e-mail addressed all the arguments raised in the demurrer and motion to strike.  These half-hearted efforts to meet and confer are insufficient.  The Court continues the hearing on the demurrer and motion to strike to October 15, 2024 at 9:00 a.m. to allow the parties time to meaningfully meet and confer, and to file proof thereof.    IT IS SO ORDERED.  DATED: September 25, 2024    ___________________________ Edward B. Moreton, Jr. Judge of the Superior Court
