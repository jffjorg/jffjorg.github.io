 Case Number:  23SMCV05203    Hearing Date:   September 25, 2024    Dept:  205  HEARING DATE:  September 25, 2024 JUDGE/DEPT:  Moreton/Beverly Hills, 205 CASE NAME: Maxim Commercial Capital LLC v. Larj Logistics LLC, et al.  CASE NUMBER:  23SMCV05203  COMP. FILED:  November 2, 2023    PROCEEDINGS:  REQUEST FOR ENTRY OF DEFAULT JUDGMENT MOVING PARTY:  Maxim Commercial Capital, LLC RESPONDING PARTY: Larj Logistics LLC, Freedom Finance LLC, Akeem Raji BACKGROUND This is a breach of contract case.  Plaintiff Maxim Commercial Capital, LLC entered into a written equipment finance agreement (the “Agreement”) with Defendant Larj Logistics LLC.  To induce Plaintiff to enter into the Agreement, Defendants Freedom Finance LLC and Akeem Raji each executed and delivered a Guaranty, whereby they unconditionally guaranteed payment and performance obligations under the Agreement.   Larj defaulted by failing to make payments under the Agreement.  Freedom and Raji defaulted on their Guaranty by failing to make the payments that Larj did not make.     On November 2, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Complaint against Defendants.  The Complaint alleges four claims for (1) breach of contract, (2) breach of guaranty, (3) a common count for money lent, and (4) claim and delivery.  The Complaint seeks an outstanding balance of $117,632.33, plus prejudgment interest at the rate of 10% per annum, plus reasonable attorneys’ fees as provided in the Agreement.     Plaintiff filed a proof of service showing Defendants were served by substitute service on January 20, 2024.  Defendants were obligated to respond.  Defendants did not do so.  Plaintiff successfully requested the entry of Defendants’ default, which was entered by the Clerk’s Office on May 13, 2024.  Plaintiff requested a default judgment.  Plaintiff served the request for entry of default and request for default judgment by mail.  Defendants have not appeared.    RELIEF REQUESTED  Default judgment against Defendants for a total of $115,305.94, which is comprised of: (1) $102,842.24, for damages, (2) $8,000.28 in interest, (3) $2,918.42 in attorneys’ fees and (4) $1,545, for costs.   ANALYSIS  Code Civ. Proc. § 585 sets forth the two options for obtaining a default judgment. First, where the plaintiff’s complaint¿seeks compensatory damages only, in a sum certain which is readily ascertainable from the allegations of the complaint or statement of damages, the clerk may enter the default judgment for that amount. However, if the relief requested in the complaint is more complicated, consisting of either nonmonetary relief, or monetary relief in amounts which require either an accounting, additional evidence, or the exercise of judgment to ascertain, the plaintiff must request entry of judgment by the court. In such cases, the plaintiff must affirmatively establish his entitlement to the specific judgment requested.¿ (Kim v. Westmoore Partners, Inc. (2011) 201 Cal.App.4th 267, 287.)  Section 585 also allows for interest, costs and attorney fees, where otherwise allowed by law. (Code of Civ. Proc. § 585(a).)  Multiple specific documents are required, such as: (1) form CIV 100, (2) a brief summary of the case; (3) declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested; (4) interest computations as necessary; (5) a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (6) a proposed form of judgment; (7) a dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application for separate judgment under Code Civ. Proc. § 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; (8) exhibits as necessary; and (9) a request for attorneys’ fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.  (CRC Rule 3.1800.)  Here, Plaintiff has properly complied with all the substantive and procedural requirements for a default judgment. Substantively, Plaintiff attests via declaration that there have been damages in the amount of $102,842.24 as amounts owed by Defendants under the Agreement.  Plaintiff also provides via declaration a calculation of the interest sought of $8,000.28, which interest is recoverable under the Agreement.  There is a contractual basis for Plaintiff’s request for attorneys’ fees, and the amount of fees sought is supported by counsel’s declaration.  A memorandum of costs in the amount of $1,545 is set forth in Item 7 of the CIV-100 form.  The supporting exhibits (the Agreement and an account summary) are authenticated by declaration.  Procedurally, Plaintiff properly served Defendants more than 30 days prior to requesting entry of default and default judgment, correctly completed JC Form CIV-100 in a manner that would not void or put at issue the entry of default, provided a declaration of non-military status, requested dismissal of the fictitious defendants, requested damages in amounts supported by the filings and not in excess of the amount stated in the Complaint, and filed a proposed judgment (JUD-100).   As default has already been entered, and there has been no appearance or filing whatsoever from Defendants, default judgment is appropriate here.   CONCLUSION AND ORDER   For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff Maxim Commercial Capital LLC’s Request for Default Judgment is GRANTED as to Defendants Larj Logistics LLC, Freedom Finance LLC and Akeem Raji.  Default judgment in the amount of $115,305.94 is awarded in favor of Plaintiff.
