The default judgment is for a total of $115,305.94, which includes damages, interest, attorneys' fees, and costs. The judge found that the plaintiff has properly complied with all the substantive and procedural requirements for a default judgment, including serving the defendants with substitute service, filing a proof of service, and providing supporting evidence and declarations. The defendants did not respond to the complaint or the request for default judgment, and therefore the judge has granted the default judgment.
