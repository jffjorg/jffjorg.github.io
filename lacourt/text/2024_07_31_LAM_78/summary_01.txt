And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion to reopen discovery for a limited purpose, allowing the plaintiff to conduct depositions on the issue of the "ministerial exception" and whether the defendants are exempt from the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA) as a non-profit religious organization. The discovery will be reopened to track with the current trial date of December 30, 2024. The judge also orders that the defendants be allowed to amend their answer to include two new affirmative defenses. The only matter at issue is the cost of the discovery, which the judge will address at the hearing.
