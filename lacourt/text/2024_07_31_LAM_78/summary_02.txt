And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed the demurrer to the First Amended Complaint and has found that the fraud claim is sufficiently pled. The Court has also found that the statute of limitations for the fraud claim has not run, as the plaintiff did not discover the defect until August 20, 2021, and the action was filed on October 21, 2023.

The Court has also denied the motion to strike punitive damages, finding that the fraud claim is pled with the required specificity and that the plaintiff has alleged facts that support a claim for punitive damages.

The Court has overruled the demurrer to the First Amended Complaint and has denied the motion to strike punitive damages. The parties are encouraged to meet and confer after reading this tentative ruling to see if they can reach an agreement.
