  Case Number:  23VECV00991    Hearing Date:   April 10, 2024    Dept:  T 23VECV00991  Kazemi v City of LA Tentative ruling on motion to continue MSJ:  The court is inclined to continue the trial and  FSC if the MSJ is continued because it is a burden on the court and counsel to  prepare for trial at the same time as working on the MSJ.  The court does inquire, however, why the  depositions of the defendants were not taken until the defendants had been in  the case for almost 10 months+.  Why was  there a delay in getting these depositions?   The plaintiff raised no issue about problems with discovery at the  CMC on 2/15/2024 at which time the court told all counsel that it was not  inclined to continue the trial dates.  Also, the MSJ was served 2 months ago, why was there delay in seeking relief?
