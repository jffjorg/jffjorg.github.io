And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case brought by Ngoc Fuhr against General Motors LLC (GM) regarding a lemon law action. The case involves a 2021 Chevrolet Bolt that was leased by Fuhr, which had a defective battery that caused it to lose range and potentially catch fire. GM was aware of the defect prior to the lease and did not disclose it to Fuhr.

The judge has overruled the demurrer to the first cause of action, which alleges fraud concealment, and has also overruled the demurrer to the second cause of action, which alleges violations of Business and Professions Code §17200. The judge has also denied the motion to strike punitive damages.

The judge has determined that the fraud cause of action is sufficiently pled and that the facts alleged in the complaint are sufficient to state a cause of action. The judge has also determined that the plaintiff has alleged a fraudulent business act that caused damages, which is required for a UCL violation.

The judge has ordered that the defendant's demurrer to the SAC be overruled in its entirety or the court may elect to sustain the demurrer because the filing of the SAC was late without a showing of good cause. The judge has also ordered that the answer to the SAC be due within 20 days.
