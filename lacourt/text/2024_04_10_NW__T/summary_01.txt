And here is the English-text summary:

The court's tentative ruling is to continue the trial and Final Status Conference (FSC) if the motion for summary judgment (MSJ) is continued. The court finds that it is a burden on the court and counsel to prepare for trial and MSJ simultaneously. The court inquires into the delay in getting the defendant's depositions, which were taken 10 months after the defendants joined the case. The court notes that the plaintiff raised no issues about problems with discovery at the Court Management Conference (CMC) on February 15, 2024. The court also wonders why the MSJ was served 2 months ago and why there was a delay in seeking relief.
