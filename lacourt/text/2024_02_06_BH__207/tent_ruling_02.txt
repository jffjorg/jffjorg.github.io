BACKGROUND
 
Plaintiff Michael Hart (“Plaintiff”) sued Defendant California Fair
Plan Association (“Defendant’) alleging causes of action for (1) Breach of
Contract and (2) Breach of Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing for
allegedly failing to adequately reimburse Plaintiff to repair Plaintiff’s main
home and guest house, pursuant to the terms of an insurance agreement, after
both structures were damaged in connection with the Woolsey fire in November
2018.   
 
Defendant now moves for summary judgment, or in the alternative,
summary adjudication.  Plaintiff opposes
the motion and Defendant replies.  
 
LEGAL STANDARDS –SUMMARY JUDGMENT/SUMMARY
ADJUDICATION
 
“[T]he party moving for
summary judgment bears the burden of persuasion that there is no triable issue
of material fact and that he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law[.]
There is a triable issue of material fact if, and only if, the evidence would
allow a reasonable trier of fact to find the underlying fact in favor of the
party opposing the motion in accordance with the applicable standard of proof.”
¿(Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 850
(hereafter Aguilar).) ¿“[T]he party moving for summary judgment bears an
initial burden of production to make a prima facie showing of the nonexistence
of any triable issue of material fact; if he carries his burden of production,
he causes a shift, and the opposing party is then subjected to a burden of
production of his own to make a prima facie showing of the existence of a
triable issue of material fact.” ¿(Ibid.; Smith v. Wells Fargo Bank,
N.A. (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 1463, 1474 [summary judgment standards held by Aguilar
apply to summary adjudication motions].)  
 
Further, “the trial court
may not weigh the evidence in the manner of a factfinder to determine whose
version is more likely true.  Nor may the
trial court grant summary judgment based on the court's evaluation of credibility.”  (Aguilar, supra, 25 Cal.4th. at p. 840
[cleaned up]; see also Weiss v. People ex rel. Department of Transportation
(2020) 9 Cal.5th 840, 864 [“Courts deciding motions for summary judgment or
summary adjudication may not weigh the evidence but must instead view it in the
light most favorable to the opposing party and draw all reasonable inferences
in favor of that party”].)  
 
A party may move for summary adjudication as to one or more causes of
action, affirmative defenses, claims for damages, or issues of duty if that
party contends that there is no merit to the cause of action, defense, or claim
for damages, or if the party contends that there is no duty owed.  (See Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd.
(f)(1).)  “A motion for summary
adjudication shall be granted only if it completely disposes of a cause of
action, an affirmative defense, a claim for damages, or an issue of duty.”  (Ibid.)  A cause of action has no merit if: (1) one or
more elements of the cause of action cannot be separately established, even if
that element is separately pleaded, or (2) a defendant establishes an
affirmative defense to that cause of action. 
(See Code Civ. Proc., §
437c, subd. (n); Union Bank v. Superior
Court (1995) 31 Cal.App.4th 573, 583.) 
Once the defendant has shown that a cause of action has no merit, the
burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that a triable issue of material fact
exists as to that cause of action.  (See Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (o)(2); Union Bank v. Superior Court, supra, 31 Cal.App.4th at p.
583.)  Additionally, in line with Aguilar,
“[o]n a motion for summary adjudication, the trial court has no discretion to
exercise.  If a triable issue of material fact exists as to the challenged
causes of action, the motion must be denied. If there is no triable issue of
fact, the motion must be granted.”  (Fisherman's Wharf Bay Cruise Corp.
v. Superior Court (2003) 114 Cal.App.4th 309, 320.)
 
EVIDENCE
            
Request for Judicial Notice
 
A motion for summary judgment
or summary adjudication may be supported by matters of which judicial notice
may be taken.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c,
subd. (b)(1).)  Here, Defendant requests
judicial notice of the Complaint filed in this matter.  
 
Judicial notice may be taken
of records of any court in this state. 
(Evid. Code, § 452, subd. (d)(1).) 
Because the Complaint is part of the Court’s record for this case, the
Court may take judicial notice of it.  (Ibid.)   However, “while courts are free to take
judicial notice of the existence of each document in a court file, including
the truth of results reached, they may not take judicial notice of the truth of
hearsay statements in decisions and court files.  Courts may not take judicial notice of allegations
in affidavits, declarations and probation reports in court records because such
matters are reasonably subject to dispute and therefore require formal proof.”  (Lockley v. Law Office of Cantrell, Green,
Pekich, Cruz & McCort (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 875, 882 [cleaned up].)  
 
Accordingly, the Court takes
judicial notice of the existence of the Complaint filed in this matter as a
court record, but not the truth of the allegations contained therein.

DISCUSSION
 
Defendant argues: (1)
Plaintiff’s first cause of action for breach of contract has no merit; (2)
Plaintiff’s second cause of action for breach of the implied covenant of good
faith and fair dealing has no merit; and (3) Plaintiff’s prayer for punitive
damages cannot be maintained.  The Court
discusses each in turn.
 
Breach of Contract
 
            Plaintiff’s complaint alleges
Defendant breached the insurance contract by failing to sufficiently reimburse
Plaintiff to repair Plaintiff’s property “to pre-loss condition upon the event
of a covered loss” even though “that was a contracted-for benefit of the
Agreement.”  (Complaint ¶¶ 56-57.)
 
            Defendant argues that Plaintiff’s
beach of contract has no merit because not only did it pay Plaintiff all that
Plaintiff was owed under the agreement, it overpaid Plaintiff by approximately
$10,000.
 
            Defendant’s Evidence
 
            In support, Defendant has provided a
series of exhibits, outlining various competing versions of adjuster reports,
as well as a series of payments Defendant made to Plaintiff.  For example, on March 10, 2019, Mr.
Soderquist of Koning & Associates, prepared a report indicating that there
was $14,422.30 worth of damage to the main house and $2,876.83 worth of damage
to the guest house.  (Natalee Decl. ¶¶
19-20 and Exs. 11-12.)  Based upon this
estimate, Defendant paid Plaintiff only $1,612.30 for damage to the garage of
the main house.  (Natalee Decl. ¶¶ 21-22
and Ex. 13.)  
 
On April 23, 2019, Mr. Soderquist apparently supplemented the
estimates.  (Natalee Decl. ¶ 23.)  Defendant did not indicate what the
supplemented estimates indicated, nor provide a copy of the supplemental
estimates.  After reviewing the
estimates, Defendant requested revisions to the estimates, and then paid Plaintiff
an additional $2,876.83 for the guest house. 
(Natalee Decl. ¶ 23 and Ex. 14.) 
Defendant subsequently paid an additional $15,693.76 for repairs to the
main house.  (Natalee Decl. ¶ 24 and Ex.
15.)
 
            Koning replaced Mr. Soderquist with
Mr. Alexander.  (Natalee Decl. ¶ 25 and
Ex. 16.)  In January 2020, Mr. Alexander
prepared statement of loss reports, indicating losses of $11,763.10 for the
Guest House and $100,625.68 for the main house. 
(Natalee Decl. ¶¶ 31-32 and Ex. 19-20.) 
In February 2020, Defendant issued additional payments of $10,144.53,
$7,122.31, and $44,978.43 for the main house and $6,128.72 for the guest
house.  (Natalee Decl. ¶¶ 35-37 and Exs.
22-24.)
 
            Once Mr. Alexander took over for Mr.
Soderquist, Plaintiff refused to cooperate with Defendant regarding additional
adjuster visits to the property.  (Natalee
Decl. ¶¶ 34-35; 38 and Exs. 21, 25.)  Plaintiff
did, however, hire his own public adjuster, Blue Oaks, whose estimates
indicated the losses to the Main House totaled $127,853.39 and losses to the
Guest House totaled $96,599.80.  (Natalee
Decl. ¶¶ 40-42 and Exs. 27-28.)
 
            In December 2020, Plaintiff permitted
Defendant to re-inspect the property. 
(Natalee Decl. ¶ 43.)  Upon
reinspection, Defendant disagreed with Blue Oaks’ inclusion of estimates to clean
or paint the interior, re-stucco the exterior, or replace roof tiles on main
house, and to replace the siding or drywall in the guest house.  (Natalee Decl. ¶¶ 44-45 and Ex. 29.)
 
            In January 2021, Defendant hired a
construction consultant, Mr. Perley, who re-inspected the property with Mr.
Alexander in February 2021.  (Natalee
Decl. ¶¶ 46 and Ex. 30.)  In April 2021,
Defendant received a report on the damages estimates from Mr. Perley.  (Natalee Decl. ¶ 47.)  The estimates demonstrated losses for the
guest house totaling $52,671.04 and for the main house totaling $81,567.16.  (See Natalee Decl. ¶¶ 48-49 and Exs. 31-32[1].)
 
In May, 2021, Defendant requested the Perley estimates to be reduced
by deducting “unsupported damages and specific allowances […] not covered under
the policies[.]”  (Natalee Decl. ¶
47.)  Included among the reductions were “$10,923.84
for residential supervision/project management, $3,584.88 for supervision for
Covid and project combined cleaning technician, $9,461.77 for personal
protective equipment, and $3,507.92 for equipment decontamination.”  (Ibid.)  Mr. Perley refused to revise the
estimates.  (Natalee Decl. ¶ 50 and Ex.
33.)
 
In June 2021, Defendant issued an additional $10,412.58 payment for
the guest house.  (Natalee Decl. ¶ 53 and
Ex. 35.)  
 
In August 2021, Defendant commissioned another independent adjusting
firm, DB Claims Services Group to inspect the property again.  DB inspected the property on October 7,
2021.  (Natalee Dec. ¶ 54.)  
 
            In January 13, 2022, Defendant sent
Plaintiff a letter regarding the main house, which included the new damages
estimate report, prepared by DB, indicating damages to the main house totaled
only $52,771.76.  The letter explained
that the “appropriate payment” amount for the main house is $46,086.51
($52,771.76 minus $6,434.25 for depreciation and $250 for Plaintiff’s
deductible), yet the amount Defendant already paid Plaintiff totals $56,258.74,
and thus, Plaintiff has been overpaid by $10,171.23 for the main house.  (Natalee Decl. ¶ 57 and Ex. 37.)
 
In March 2022, Defendant issued additional payments of $20,497.66 and
$355.63 for the guest house, purportedly based on the DB damages estimate
report.  (Natalee Decl. ¶ 55.)  Defendant has not included a copy of the DB
damages estimate report for the guest house in the record.
 
In total, Defendant has paid Plaintiff $79,551.32 for the main house
and $40,271.42 for the guest house.[2]
 
In September 2022, Defendant retained another independent adjusting
firm, Rickerby, who inspected the property on October 3, 2022.  (Natalee Decl. ¶¶ 60-61.)  The Rickerby inspection notes and reports determined
there was no remaining damage and concluded the amounts already paid must
therefore have been sufficient to restore the properties to their pre-loss
conditions.  (Natalee Decl. ¶¶ 61-64 and
Exs. 38-40.)
 
Analysis
 
            Defendant has not met its burden of
production and persuasion in establishing that there is no triable issue of
material fact regarding whether it has or has not breach the contract by
failing to pay Plaintiff all that is owed under the policy.  To the contrary, not only has Defendant
demonstrated that Plaintiff and Defendant rely on competing damage estimate
reports, but Defendant has also provided its own numerous, competing damage
estimate reports.  Moreover, Defendant’s poor
recordkeeping, which frequently conflates the main house and the guest house,
further obscures what was purportedly owed and paid with respect to each of the
structures.    
 
            Thus, Defendant’s own evidence
demonstrates there remain triable issues of material fact regarding which (if
any) of the damage estimate reports controls and what (if any) deductions (such
as COVID decontamination, etc.) are appropriate under the policy.
 
Moreover, Defendant has not included in the record the DB report for
the guest house, which it contends is the controlling report.  Thus, even if the Court were to weigh the
competing reports and determine that the DB report controls (which it is not
permitted to do on a motion for summary judgment), there is insufficient
evidence in the record that Defendant paid Plaintiff all amounts owed for the
guest house pursuant to the DB report.
 
            Therefore, the Court denies summary
adjudication as to issue 1.
 
Breach
of the Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing
 
            Defendant next contends Plaintiff’s
second cause of action fails because (1) there is no underlying breach of the
contract; and (2) any breach was the result of honest mistake, not bad faith.  
 
As discussed above, because the Court denies summary adjudication as
to the breach of contract claim, the Court cannot grant summary adjudication as
to issue 2 on this basis.
 
As for bad faith, the Court cannot conclude, as a matter of law, that
there is no evidence of Defendant’s bad faith. 
To the contrary, Defendant’s evidence indicates that when presented with
the original Soderquist report, which indicated $14,422.30 worth of damage to
the main house and $2,876.83 worth of damage to the guest house, Defendant paid
out only $1,612.30.  (Natalee Decl. ¶¶
19-22 and Exs. 11-13.)  
 
After Soderquist provided Defendant with a supplemental report, which
Defendant has neglected to include in the record, Defendant requested (presumably
downward) revisions before it paid Plaintiff any additional amounts.  It is unclear whether Soderquist further
revised the supplemental report in accordance with Defendant’s request, or
whether Defendant’s supplemental payments fully and completely paid Plaintiff
in accordance with either the original or revised (if any) supplemental report.
 
Defendant then commissioned Mr. Perley to conduct a new investigation
and report, which indicated guest house losses totaling $52,671.04 and main
house losses totaling $81,567.16.  (See
Natalee Decl. ¶¶ 48-49 and Exs. 31-32.) 
Defendant again requested downward revisions, which Mr. Perley refused
to do.  (Natalee Decl. ¶ 50 and Ex.
33.)  Despite Mr. Perley’s refusal, Defendant
still refused to pay Plaintiff $10,923.84 for residential supervision/project
management, $3,584.88 for supervision for Covid and project combined cleaning
technician, $9,461.77 for personal protective equipment, or $3,507.92 for
equipment decontamination.
 
Defendant’s own evidence therefore demonstrates that Defendant did not
pay Plaintiff in accordance with its own damage estimate reports, repeatedly
requested the independent adjusters to modify their reports downward, and,
failing that, continually commissioned new independent adjuster reports,
requiring Plaintiff to submit to additional property inspections each time, all
in an ongoing attempt to pay Plaintiff substantially less than what the
independent adjusters indicated was owed. 

 
Thus, a trier of fact could determine that Defendant’s underpayment was
not an “honest mistake” but rather a result of Defendant’s bad faith.  As such, the Court denies summary judgment as
to issue 2.
 
Punitive
Damages
 
            The Complaint alleges Defendant’s
conduct was done “in a fraudulent and oppressive manner” warranting punitive
damages, pursuant to Civil Code section 3294. 
(Complaint ¶ 69.)  
 
            Defendant argues that Plaintiff
cannot meet the “clear and convincing” evidentiary burden that Defendant acted
with oppression, fraud, or malice to support Plaintiff’s claim for punitive
damages.  
 
As set forth in the Civil Code, 
 
(1) “Malice” means conduct which is intended
by the defendant to cause injury to the plaintiff or despicable conduct which
is carried on by the defendant with a willful and conscious disregard
of the rights or safety of others.  (2)
“Oppression” means despicable conduct that subjects a person to cruel and
unjust hardship in conscious disregard of that person's rights.  (3) “Fraud” means an intentional
misrepresentation, deceit, or concealment of a material fact known to the
defendant with the intention on the part of the defendant of thereby depriving
a person of property or legal rights or otherwise causing injury.
 
(Civ.
Code, § 3294, subd. (c)(1)-(3), emphasis added.)  
 
            Here, as discussed above, Defendant’s
own evidence demonstrates Defendant (1) continually underpaid Plaintiff based
on what the independent adjuster reports indicated what was owed, (2) attempted
to modify at least two independent adjuster reports, (3) concealed the underlying
reports upon which its payments were supposedly based, and (4) continually
commissioned new adjuster reports, requiring additional home inspections each
time, until it finally obtained a sufficiently favorable estimate.  
 
Thus, a trier of fact could determine that Defendant acted fraudulently
by intentionally trying to alter and/or conceal the independent adjuster damage
estimates to deprive Plaintiff of the full value of his claims under the
contract. 
 
            As such, the Court cannot grant
summary adjudication as to issue 3.
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER 
 
“A defendant or
cross-defendant has met his or her burden of showing that a cause of action has
no merit if the party has shown that one or more elements of the cause of
action, even if not separately pleaded, cannot be established, or that there is
a complete defense to the cause of action. Once the defendant or
cross-defendant has met that burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff or
cross-complainant to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts
exists as to the cause of action or a defense thereto.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2);
accord Doe v. Good Samaritan Hosp. (2018) 23 Cal.App.5th 653, 661 [“It
is not until the defendant meets this burden that the burden of production
shifts to the plaintiff to show that a triable issue of one or more material
facts exists as to the defense”].)  
 
The Court finds that Defendant
has not met its initial burdens of production and persuasion.  Consequently, the Court determines that the
burden of production does not shift to Plaintiff to produce evidence that
raises triable issues of material fact.  
 
Having found that Defendant
has not met its initial burdens of production and persuasion, the Court denies Defendant’s
motion for summary judgment or in the alternative motion for summary
adjudication.  Defendant is not entitled
to judgment as a matter of law.  
 
The Clerk of the Court shall
provide notice of the Court’s ruling.
