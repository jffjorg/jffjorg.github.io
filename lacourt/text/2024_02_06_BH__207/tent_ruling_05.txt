[1] The Court notes that although the demurrer ends at
page 20, the memorandum begins on page 6, and therefore the demurrer falls
within the applicable 15-page limit. 
(See California Rule of Court 3.1113(d) [“The page limit does not
include the caption page, the notice of motion and motion, exhibits,
declarations, attachments, the table of contents, the table of authorities, or
the proof of service.”])
