And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer motions filed by the defendants. The Court has sustained the demurrer to the third cause of action (nuisance and trespass) due to uncertainty, and has sustained the demurrer to the fifth cause of action (breach of contract based on promissory estoppel) as to Defendant E&TB Investments, LLC, but not as to the other defendants. The Court has denied the demurrer to the ninth cause of action (quantum meruit) and has sustained the demurrer to the tenth and eleventh causes of action (intentional and negligent interference with prospective economic advantage) as to certain defendants.

The Court has also ruled on the allegations of the complaint, finding that the plaintiff has adequately stated a cause of action for promissory estoppel against certain defendants, and that the defendants have failed to state a cause of action for breach of contract based on promissory estoppel.

The Court has ordered the parties to file a joint statement of undisputed facts and has set a hearing on the tentative ruling for February 6, 2024.
