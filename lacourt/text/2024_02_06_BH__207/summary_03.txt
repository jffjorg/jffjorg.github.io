And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling addresses the issue of Exhibits 31 and 32, which appear to be mixed up. Despite Ms. Natalee's declaration stating that Exhibit 31 pertains to the main house and Exhibit 32 pertains to the guest house, the exhibits actually contain information about both houses. Specifically, the cover letter for Exhibit 31 is for the main house, but the spreadsheet and report are for the guest house, and vice versa for Exhibit 32. The Defendant's brief indicates that they paid a total of $79,551.32 for the main house, which matches the total amount calculated from the invoices.
