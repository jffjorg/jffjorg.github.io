[1] Notwithstanding Ms. Natalee’s declaration indicating that
Exhibit 31 pertains to the main house and Exhibit 32 pertains to the guest
house (Natalee Decl. ¶¶ 48-49), Exhibits 31 and 32 appear jumbled.  Each exhibit contains a cover letter, a
spreadsheet prepared by Mr. Alexander, and an estimate report prepared by Mr.
Perley.  The cover letter for Exhibit 31
pertains to the main house, but the Alexander spreadsheet and Perley report
pertain to the guest house.  Similarly,
the cover letter for Exhibit 32 pertains to the guest house, but the Alexander
spreadsheet and Perley report pertain to the main house.


[2] Defendant’s brief indicates Defendant paid $79,521.32
for the main house, but $1,612.30 + $11,280.32 + $4,413.44 + $10,144.53 +
$7,122.31 + $44,978.42 = $79,551.32.
