Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion to strike portions of the plaintiff's complaint. The plaintiff, Linda Barajas, sued the defendants, HMRTJ LLC dba Villa Valencia Apartments, Gerald Tom, Ronald Tom, and Rodolfo Campos, for damages resulting from two slip-and-fall incidents at the Villa Valencia Apartments in Arcadia, California. The plaintiff alleged that the defendants failed to repair a broken rain gutter, which created a hazardous condition and led to her injuries.

The defendants moved to strike several allegations from the complaint, including the request for punitive damages, the allegations of "Willful Failure to Warn" and "Dangerous Condition of Public Property," and the exemplary damages attachment. The judge found that the plaintiff's request for punitive damages lacked sufficient factual support to establish malice, oppression, or fraud.

The judge also found that the allegations of "Willful Failure to Warn" and "Dangerous Condition of Public Property" lacked necessary factual support and were conclusory. The judge struck these allegations from the complaint.

Finally, the judge found that the exemplary damages attachment lacked sufficient factual detail to support the claim of "conscious disregard for the safety of the public and of Plaintiff." The judge struck the exemplary damages attachment from the complaint.

The plaintiff has 20 days to amend the complaint, and the defendants are to give notice of the ruling.
