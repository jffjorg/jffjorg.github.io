And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Ting Zhao and Yong Sun v. Weixin Fu and Xian Ge. The case involves a dispute over the recognition and enforcement of a foreign judgment obtained by the plaintiffs in a Chinese court. The plaintiffs are seeking to recognize and enforce the judgment in California, while the defendants are seeking to dismiss the complaint.

The judge has found that the plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged facts to meet the requirements for recognition under the Uniform Foreign-Country Money Judgments Recognition Act. The judge has also found that the defendants' demurrer to the complaint is without merit and has therefore overruled the demurrer.

The judge has ordered the defendants to give notice and provide an answer within 10 days of the hearing. The case is set for further hearing on November 8, 2024.
