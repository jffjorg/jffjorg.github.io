And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering the plaintiff's application for a right to attach order against the defendants, seeking $2,103,754.57 in damages. The plaintiff claims that this amount includes unpaid rent and license fees under the Master Lease and Second Amendment thereto. However, the judge finds that the plaintiff has not provided a clear and definite formula for the computation of damages, and therefore, the claim is not one upon which attachment may be issued. The judge also notes that the attachments law statutes are subject to strict construction. The applications for right to attach orders are denied.
