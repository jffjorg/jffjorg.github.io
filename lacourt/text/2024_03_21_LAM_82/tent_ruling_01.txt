[TENTATIVE] RULING ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF ADMINISTRATIVE
  MANDAMUS
 
Dept. 82 (Hon. Curtis A. Kin)
 
 



 
            Petitioner John Doe petitions for a writ
of mandate directing respondents University of Southern California; Monique S.
Allard, in her
official capacity as Interim Vice President for Student Affairs; and Catherine
Spear, in her official
capacity
as Title IX Coordinator and Vice President of the Office for Equity, Equal
Opportunity,
and Title IX to set aside a decision finding that petitioner engaged in sexual
misconduct and expelling petitioner. 
 
I.       Factual Background
 
A.          
The October 15, 2021, to October 16, 2021, Incident
 
This proceeding concerns
an incident between petitioner John Doe and non-party Jane Roe while they were
having sexual intercourse. 
 
On October 15, 2021, Roe
and her friend MM met petitioner at a nightclub. (AR 89, 98, 632-35, 918,
1110.) All three of them were students at the University of Southern California
(“USC”). (AR 87, 636, 936.) Roe and petitioner began dancing together and
making out. (AR 89, 106, 693-97, 924, 926-28, 930, 1110.) After some time, Roe
told her friend MM that she was leaving with petitioner, and all three took a
Lyft back to MM’s residence. (AR 89, 697, 700-02, 933-36, 1111.) From there,
Roe and petitioner rode an electric scooter to the Sigma Nu fraternity house
where petitioner lived. (AR 89–90, 107, 703–04, 937, 1111.)
 
Roe and petitioner made
their way to petitioner’s bedroom, where they began consensual sexual
intercourse. (AR 90, 644-50, 940-41, 954-55.) After several minutes, they
changed positions to where Roe was facing away from petitioner and resumed
vaginal intercourse. (AR 90, 650-54, 985-86, 1111.) It was at this point that petitioner
began to touch and enter Roe’s anus with his fingers. (AR 90, 120, 655, 1112.)
Roe moved to physically signal petitioner to stop. (AR 90-91, 121, 655, 1112.)
When this did not work, Roe tried to lift herself up to get petitioner off her.
(AR 655-56, 1112.) This was difficult for Roe, because petitioner had his
entire upper body weight on Roe’s back and buttocks. (AR 657, 989, 1112.) As
Roe began lifting herself, petitioner removed his penis from her vagina and
began inserting it into her anus. (AR 121, 655-56, 986-87, 1112.) Roe jolted up
and out of petitioner’s bed. (AR 121, 655-56, 986, 1112.) Roe then explicitly
told petitioner that she did not want to engage in anal intercourse and began
to reach for her clothes to get dressed and leave. (AR 91, 122, 656-57, 986,
992, 1112.)
 
Petitioner was apologetic
and asked Roe to stay and assured her that they would not engage in anal
intercourse. (AR 122, 657, 1112.) Roe agreed to stay and try again with
Petitioner. (AR 91, 657, 1112.) They went back to petitioner’s bed; petitioner
retrieved another condom; and they resumed vaginal intercourse. (AR 91, 129,
662-64, 1113.) Roe ended up on her stomach again with Petitioner placing his
weight on her back and buttocks area. (AR 666–67, 1113.) Petitioner then removed
his penis from Roe’s vagina and again inserted it into her anus an unknown
number of times, according to Roe. (AR 91, 129-30, 664-67, 1113.) Eventually,
Roe found the strength to push petitioner off her. (AR 91, 130, 667, 1113.) She
stood up and said that she was “done” and “can’t do this anymore.” (AR 667.) 
 
In a frenzy, Roe searched
for her clothes in the dark. (AR 130, 667-68, 993.) When she could not find all
of her clothes, petitioner offered her a sweater, and they walked downstairs
together. (AR 91, 668, 993-94, 1113.) Petitioner made statements like, “What’s
wrong, I didn’t mean to do anything to you.” (AR 668-69, 1113.) Roe just kept
saying “It’s fine, it’s fine. I just need to go.” (AR 668-69, 993, 1114.)
Petitioner offered to call Roe a Lyft, but Roe declined. (AR 669, 1114.) Roe wanted
to leave as soon as possible. (AR 669.) They gave each other a hug goodbye, and
Roe left Sigma Nu around 3:00 a.m. (AR 92, 669, 993-94, 1114.)
 
B.          
Reporting of Incident
 
On October 16, 2021, Roe
reported that petitioner sexually assaulted her to USC’s Department of Public
Safety (“DPS”) and the Los Angeles Police Department (“LAPD”). (AR 92, 95, 145,
204-10, 213-14.) That day, DPS reported the incident to USC’s Office for
Equity, Equal Opportunity, and Title IX (“EEO-TIX”). (AR 399-400.) Roe was also
seen that day by the UCLA Rape Treatment Center where an anal laceration was
found by the examiner. (AR 92, 165-76.)
 
On October 19, 2021, Roe
met with EEO-TIX to discuss her reporting options and supportive measures
available. (AR 83.) Roe reported that she was not concerned for her physical
safety and did not have concerns about retaliation. (AR 83.) 
 
On October 20, 2021, DPS
issued a crime alert which stated: “The university has received a report of
sexual assault at the Sigma Nu fraternity house…. The university also has
received reports of drugs being placed into drinks during a party at the same
fraternity house, leading to possible drug-facilitated sexual assaults.” (AR 200.)
 
Also on October 20, 2021,
respondent Catherine Spear, USC’s Vice President of EEO-TIX and Title IX Coordinator,
sent petitioner a Notice of Emergency Removal informing him that, due to
allegations by Roe of “nonconsensual sexual activity and physical violence,” he
was immediately barred from the university campus. (AR 401-08, 1241-43.). Petitioner
was allowed to continue taking courses asynchronously, i.e., by watching
recordings of classes and completing assignments and exams without attending
class, either in-person or remotely. (AR 1321-22.)
 
On October 21, 2021, petitioner
denied the allegations against him and challenged the emergency removal. (AR 1249.)
However, respondent Monique Allard, Interim Vice President for Student Affairs,
denied his challenge on October 28, 2021, after having reviewed the risk
factors posed by petitioner’s presence on campus. (AR 81, 1287-90, 1341-45.) Allard
stated that petitioner’s assertion that he would not be a threat to safety did
not provide a basis for lifting an emergency removal order. (AR 80.) Allard also
noted that it was unknown whether the allegations against petitioner were
unrelated to the other allegations against the fraternity given that petitioner
was the Sigma Nu chapter president and leader of that student organization. (AR
81.)
 
Members of the USC
community gathered at the Sigma Nu fraternity house on or around October 21,
2021 in protest. (AR 512.) The fraternity house was vandalized with graffiti,
including petitioner’s name written on the wall; protestors entered the house
(according to petitioner); and the house was covered in various signs. (AR 490-91,
525.) Commenters on social media demanded action from USC. (AR 527.) On the
following day, petitioner’s name and image appeared throughout social media
calling him a “rapist.” (AR 522, 529.) Prior to LAPD’s confirmation that
petitioner was the “main suspect” in the sexual assault reports at the
fraternity, petitioner was rumored to have been involved in the allegations.
(AR 1076.)
 
On October 26, 2021, Roe
filed a formal complaint with EEO-TIX alleging that petitioner engaged in
“multiple instances of non-consensual oral sex and anal penetration of [Roe]
with his penis and fingers,” as well as “multiple instances of non-consensual
sexual acts, attempted non-consensual sexual acts, and acts of violence…including,
but not limited to, strangling, biting, slapping, and physically restraining
[Roe] from moving.” (AR 63-64.) That same day, EEO-TIX sent petitioner a Notice
of Investigation. (AR 1331-37.)
 
 
 
 
C.          
Investigation
 
EEO-TIX’s investigation
of petitioner’s alleged assault of Roe was separate from its investigation of
alleged drug-facilitated sexual assaults at Sigma Nu. (AR 1062-63.) Different investigators
were assigned to each investigation. (AR 1062-64.) Investigator Kyle Gruber
(“Investigator”) handled the investigation of Roe’s allegations against petitioner.
(AR 246.) Investigator Jessica Lew handled the report that drug-facilitated
sexual assaults occurred at Sigma Nu during a party on September 24, 2021. (AR
1067.)
 
For the investigation
concerning Roe’s allegations, the Investigator reached out to petitioner on
October 28, 2021, to request an interview. (AR 246-47, 1338-39.) Petitioner
declined to be interviewed and did not respond to the Investigator’s invitation
to provide the names of relevant witnesses. (AR 256-59.) Thus, the Investigator
reached out to the relevant witnesses he identified based on his investigation.
(AR 260-64, 310-12, 331-33, 352-53, 365-70, 426-40, 458-71, 481-87, 605-09.)
 
On March 14, 2022, the
Investigator completed the initial fact gathering stage and shared the evidence
with petitioner and Roe. (AR 1845-48.) Petitioner requested several extensions
to review and respond to the evidence collected, and USC extended the Evidence
Review deadline several times at his request. (AR 1866-68, 1872-74, 1919-26.)
On April 22, 2022, petitioner responded to the evidence collected and provided
additional evidence, including a news article regarding protests at the Sigma
Nu fraternity. (AR 488-512.) With his response, petitioner also requested further
investigation, including interviews of additional witnesses. (AR 488-512, 1929-53.)
The Investigator attempted to reach most of the witnesses that petitioner
identified. (AR 2293.)
 
On May 26, 2022, the
Investigator notified petitioner that he completed an additional round of fact
gathering and shared the additional evidence. (AR 2098, 2101.) On June 4, 2022,
petitioner responded to the additional evidence collected, provided additional
evidence, and again requested further investigation, including investigation
into how Roe learned petitioner’s full name, the alleged disclosure of his name
to media outlets, and an allegation that the university made a decision not to
respond to Sigma Nu residents’ emergency calls during a protest at the
fraternity. (AR 515-35, 2110-30.) The Investigator determined that this
information was not directly related to the allegations at issue in the
investigation, i.e., whether petitioner engaged in nonconsensual anal intercourse
with Roe on October 16, 2021; thus, the Investigator determined no further
investigation was necessary. (AR 2293-94.) Thereafter, a live hearing was
scheduled for July 25-27, 2022. (AR 2248-50.)
 
On June 29, 2022, petitioner
was provided with the Investigative Report and Notice of Hearing, among other
materials, as well as evidence collected. (AR 2260-2306, 2489-90.) The
Investigator recommended that the alleged conduct in Roe’s formal complaint, if
true, would constitute violations under the various USC policies at issue. (AR 2297.)
 
On July 10, 2022, petitioner
provided a written response to the Investigative Report. (AR 572-603, 2522-53.)
On July 15, 2022, petitioner sent a letter requesting the transcript of an
interview of Witness AM conducted in connection with the separate investigation
of the Sigma Nu fraternity, claiming that the interview would impeach certain
statements by Roe and show her bias against petitioner. (AR 2592-95.) The
Investigator, who was not involved in the separate fraternity investigation, subsequently
found and provided the transcript to petitioner on July 18, 2022. (AR 536-66,
1063-64, 1069.)
 
D.          
Hearing
 
The live hearing took
place over a period of five days, July 25, 2022, to July 29, 2022, via Zoom
before Hearing Officer Aaron O’Donnell (“Hearing Officer”). (AR 1105.) The
hearing was to determine whether, based on a preponderance of the evidence, the
following allegations occurred: (1) whether petitioner grabbed and pulled up
Roe’s dress at the night club to reveal her buttocks; (2) whether petitioner
engaged in multiple instances of non-consensual oral sex; (3) whether petitioner
engaged in multiple instances of non-consensual anal penetration with his penis
and fingers; (4) whether petitioner attempted to engage in non-consensual anal
penetration and vaginal intercourse without a condom; and (5) whether petitioner
committed multiple acts of violence against Roe including strangling, biting,
slapping, and physically restraining her. (AR 1127-30.) Five requested
witnesses did not participate in the hearing; according to policy, the Hearing
Officer could not rely on these witnesses’ previous statements. (AR 1106.)
Approximately 95 exhibits (including two hearing exhibits) were submitted for consideration
during the hearing. (AR 1135-40.)
 
            The first day of the hearing took place on July 25, 2022.
(AR 610.) After introductory remarks, the Hearing Officer explained the status
of the requested witnesses’ availability to participate in the hearing. (AR 612-13.)
Witness SS informed USC that she would only be available Tuesday, July 26, 2022.
(AR 613.) Witness AM advised that she would not be available during the given
dates. (AR 613, 2768.) 
 
After opening statements,
Roe was the first to be examined and gave her account of what happened on the
night of the alleged incident. (AR 629.) Roe testified that petitioner began
inserting his fingers into her anus and then inserted his penis into her anus more
than twice. (AR 655-56, 665.)
 
Officer David Reyes was then
examined and stated that Roe never made to him an allegation of violence
(including choking or biting) and that he did not observe any bruises or
lacerations on Roe when he interviewed her on October 16, 2021. (AR 723, 1126.)
 
On day two of the
hearing, July 26, 2022, Roe’s advisor informed the Hearing Officer that she had
a family emergency which resulted in the hearing ending earlier than scheduled,
at approximately 2:50 p.m. (AR 735.) Due to the change in schedule, the Hearing
Officer suggested moving SS’s testimony to the following day, although he
acknowledged SS stated she was only available at 1:30 p.m. for the day she was
originally scheduled. (AR 735-36.) Petitioner agreed to the rescheduling. (AR
736.) The cross-examination of Roe resumed, and Dr. Frank Sheridan (petitioner’s
expert in forensic pathology), MM, and Dr. Veronica Thomas (petitioner’s expert
in forensic psychology) all testified. (AR 494, 735-36, 844.)
 
On day three, July 27,
2021, prior to the cross-examination of Roe and examination of petitioner, the
Hearing Officer responded to petitioner’s concerns about SS, stating that he
understood petitioner’s interest in her as a witness but that, due to time
constraints, other witnesses were prioritized. (AR 864.) The cross-examination
of Roe then concluded, followed by petitioner’s examination. (AR 914-15.) Dr.
Thomas returned to the hearing to undergo cross-examination. (AR 964.)
Following Dr. Thomas’ testimony, petitioner’s direct examination resumed,
followed by his cross-examination. (AR 982, 1002.) 
 
During cross-examination,
petitioner admitted that he penetrated Roe’s anus without any indicia of
consent. (AR 987-88.) With respect to the degree of anal penetration,
petitioner stated initially that he believed his penis did not fully enter
Roe’s anus, stating that it just “hit the surface.” (AR 987-88.) Petitioner
later testified that he could feel the difference, stating: “it just didn’t
feel like the same area I’d been in.” (AR 1032.) While petitioner testified at
the hearing that his penetration of Roe’s anus was accidental, he never
mentioned the conduct was accidental in conversations with either of his two
experts—psychologist Veronica Thomas or polygrapher Peter Perrin. (AR 504-06,
572, 847-48, 1125.)
 
Despite attempts at
contacting SS to reschedule her testimony, SS did not respond. (AR 2917-19.) At
the end of the hearing, petitioner expressed on the record that he believed he
was given “an unfair hand” due to missing SS’s availability and the inability
to reschedule her. (AR 1038.)
 
On July 28, 2022, Roe
decided to not participate in the hearing, but her advisor was present on her behalf.
(AR 1040.) Petitioner inquired about the status of SS once again, but there was
no update. (AR 1040.) The Investigator was examined, during which he explained what
Witness SS told him concerning her encounter with Roe prior to the incident, additional
details about the investigation of the fraternity, and which witnesses were not
examined. (AR 1043-46, 1063, 1067, 1077.) On July 29, 2022, the final day of
the hearing took place, and both parties delivered their closing statements.
 
On August 17, 2022, the
Hearing Officer issued his Written Notice of Determination, finding only one
out of five allegations to be supported by a preponderance of the evidence. (AR
1127-30.) The one substantiated allegation occurred during the course of at
least three of the other allegations of nonconsensual acts that were not
sustained. (AR 1129.) The Hearing Officer assigned “more overall reliability to
[petitioner]’s denials of strangling and other physical force and violence than
to [Roe’s] account….” (AR1127.) Further, the Hearing Officer did not find that
the evidence supported the allegations of multiple instances of non-consensual
oral sex or the allegation that petitioner attempt to engage in non-consensual
anal and vaginal penetration without a condom. (AR 1128, 1130.) 
 
However, the Hearing
Officer did conclude that a preponderance of the evidence supported the
allegation that petitioner engaged in non-consensual anal penetration of Roe
with his penis and fingers. (AR 1129.) The Hearing Officer based
this determination on his assessment of the parties’ respective credibility and
the fact that, even by petitioner’s own admission, Roe did not say or do
anything that would indicate consent before petitioner engaged in anal
penetration. (AR 3693-97, 3699-3700.) The Hearing Officer assigned “more
overall reliability to [Roe]’s account regarding the allegations regarding
nonconsensual anal penetration than to [petitioner]’s denials.” (AR 3697.) Thus,
the Hearing Officer determined that petitioner violated USC’s student conduct
code and its policies prohibiting Title IX sexual harassment, sexual assault,
and sexual and gender-based harassment. (AR 3701-04.)
 
On August 29, 2022, after
consideration of petitioner’s and Roe’s impact statements, the Misconduct Sanctioning
Panel (“MSP”) determined that petitioner should be expelled, not permitted on
USC’s campus, and prohibited from contacting Roe. (AR 1141-43.)
 
E.          
Appeal
 
Petitioner submitted an
appeal on September 2, 2022, raising the following grounds: (1) procedural
irregularities; (2) newly discovered evidence; and (3) bias. Petitioner
described in detail how the decision was prejudicially impacted by USC’s
failure to call witnesses, failure to provide/consider exculpatory evidence,
and the overwhelming presence of bias against him from the media and USC
community. (AR 1156-1219.) On October 14, 2022, respondent Allard affirmed the
Written Determination by the Hearing Officer and the Sanction Decision issued
by the MSP. (AR 1220-38.)
 


II.      Procedural History
 
            On
January 4, 2023, petitioner filed a Petition for Writ of Administrative Mandamus.
On March 28, 2023, respondents USC, Allard, and Spear filed an Answer.
 
            On
October 6, 2023, petitioner filed an opening brief. On November 7, 2023,
respondents filed an opposition. On November 22, 2023, petitioner filed a
reply. The Court has received an electronic copy of the administrative record
and a hard copy of the joint appendix. 
 
III.     Standard of Review
 
Under CCP § 1094.5(b),
the pertinent issues are whether the respondent has proceeded without
jurisdiction, whether there was a fair trial, and whether there was a
prejudicial abuse of discretion. An abuse of discretion is established if the
agency has not proceeded in the manner required by law, the decision is not
supported by the findings, or the findings are not supported by the evidence.
(CCP § 1094.5(b).)
 
A.          
Substantial Evidence
Review
 
Numerous Court of Appeal
cases have affirmed that student sexual misconduct proceedings at public and
private universities do not involve a fundamental vested right, and that the
substantial evidence standard applies in the trial court. (See, e.g., Doe
v. Occidental College (2019) 40 Cal.App.5th 208, 220-221; Doe v. Allee
(2019) 30 Cal.App.5th 1036, 1060; Doe v. University of Southern California
(2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 221, 238, 239, 248-49; Doe v. Regents of the
University of California (2016) 5 Cal.App.5th 1055, 1073-74; see also
Gurfinkel v. Los Angeles Community College Dist. (1981) 121 Cal.App.3d 1, 6
[no fundamental right to a public college education].)
 
Substantial evidence is “relevant
evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a
conclusion” (California Youth Authority v. State Personnel Board (2002)
104 Cal.App.4th 575, 584-85), or evidence of ponderable legal significance
which is reasonable, credible and of solid value (Kuhn v. Department of
General Services (1994) 22 Cal.App.4th 1627, 1633). “Courts may reverse an
[administrative] decision only if, based on the evidence…a reasonable person
could not reach the conclusion reached by the agency.” (Sierra Club v.
California Coastal Com. (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 602, 610.)
 
“On substantial evidence
review, [the court] do[es] not weigh the evidence, consider the credibility of
witnesses, or resolve conflicts in the evidence or in the reasonable inferences
that may be drawn from it. The administrative agency’s findings come before
[the court] with a strong presumption as to their correctness and regularity.
[The court] do[es] not substitute [its] own judgment if the agency’s decision
is one which could have been made by reasonable people. Only if no reasonable
person could reach the conclusion reached by the administrative agency, based
on the entire record before it, will a court conclude that the agency’s
findings are not supported by substantial evidence.” (Doe v. Regents of
University of California (2016) 5 Cal.App.5th 1055, 1073, citations and
quotations omitted.)
 
B.          
Fair Hearing
 
“Generally,
a fair procedure requires ‘notice reasonably calculated to apprise interested
parties of the pendency of the action ... and an opportunity to present their
objections.’” (Doe v. University of Southern California (2016) 246
Cal.App.4th 221, 240.) “A university is bound by its own policies and
procedures.” (Doe v. Regents of the University of California (2016) 5
Cal.App.5th 1055, 1078.) “Fair hearing requirements are ‘flexible’ and entail
no ‘rigid procedure.’” (Doe v. Allee (2019) 30 Cal.App.5th 1036, 1062,
disapproved of on other grounds by Boermeester v. Carry (2023) 15
Cal.5th 72, 96.) “To comport with due process …, university procedures must be
tailored in light of the matters at issue, to ensure that parties have a
meaningful opportunity to present their case.” (Id. at 1063-64.) As a
general rule, the accused usually “must be permitted to see the evidence
against him.” (Doe v. Regents of University of California (2018) 28
Cal.App.5th 44, 57.)
 
Procedural
errors, “even if proved, are subject to a harmless error analysis.” (Hinrichs
v. County of Orange (2004) 125 Cal.App.4th 921, 928.) “The question is
whether the violation resulted in unfairness, in some way depriving [petitioner]
of adequate notice or an opportunity to be heard before impartial judges.” (Rhee
v. El Camino Hosp. Dist. (1988) 201 Cal.App.3d 477, 497; see also
Thornbrough v. Western Placer Unified School Dist. (2013) 223 Cal.App.4th
169, 200.)
 
The
procedural fairness of an administrative proceeding is a question of law and
accordingly reviewed de novo. (Doe v. University of Southern California
(2018) 29 Cal.App.5th 1212, 1231; Nasha L.L.C. v. City of Los Angeles
(2004) 125 Cal.App.4th 470, 482.)
 
IV.     Analysis
 
A.          
Fairness
of Investigation and Hearing
 
Petitioner
contends that he was deprived of exculpatory evidence, that the Investigator
did not pursue leads, and that the Hearing Officer improperly relied on a
report from a witness who did not testify at the hearing. 
 
1.           
Purported
Withholding of Exculpatory Evidence
 
Petitioner
contends that the Investigator “effectively withheld” the transcript of Witness
AM because it was provided to petitioner upon his request one week before the
hearing. (Opening Br. at 9:27-28; AR 1063-64.) Petitioner maintains that the
transcript was exculpatory because it somehow shows that Roe was present during
a September 24, 2021 party at the Sigma Nu fraternity, when Roe maintained that
she had never been at the Sigma Nu fraternity prior to the incident on October
15 and 16, 2021. (AR 1067-68.) 
 
The
Investigator testified that it was university policy to provide exculpatory
evidence to the parties. (AR 1067.) However, the Investigator had no reason to know
about AM’s statement prior to petitioner’s request for the transcript on July
15, 2022. (AR 2592-95.) AM was
interviewed by a different investigator, Jessica Lew, in connection with a
different investigation, namely the allegations against Sigma Nu fraternity,
not petitioner. (AR 536-66.) Neither petitioner nor Roe identified AM as a
witness for the Investigator to interview. (AR 489-90, 516, 1816.) Therefore, the
Investigator had no occasion to know about AM’s interview until petitioner
requested the transcript of the interview of an unnamed witness. (AR 1174.) Only
when the Investigator asked Lew about petitioner’s request and Lew identified
the interview of AM did the Investigator become aware of the transcript. (AR
1064, 1069.) The Investigator subsequently provided the transcript to
petitioner on July 18, 2022, in advance of the hearing. (AR 1069.)  
 
In
any event, despite the Investigator’s characterization of AM’s interview as
exculpatory, the Court disagrees. AM told Lew (incorrectly) that Roe was one of
the alleged seven sexual assault victims who were drugged at the fraternity
party in September 2021. (AR 562-64.) AM came to this erroneous conclusion based
on her interpretation of Roe’s postings on social media and not because Roe or
anyone told AM. (AR 562-63.) Rather, in communications AM reported that she
actually had with Roe, Roe purportedly stated that she was previously assaulted,
never obtained justice for the past assault, and encouraged AM to make a
complaint.[1]
(AR 563.) AM’s understanding of Roe’s social media posts and Roe’s prior
assault have no bearing on the Hearing Officer’s findings that petitioner had
anal intercourse with Roe without her consent, especially considering that
petitioner admitted that anal penetration occurred and no prior consent was
obtained. (AR 987-88, 993.) Put another
way, even if Roe had been at the fraternity prior to the incident, that fact
bears little on whether Roe had consented to anal intercourse the following
month. 
 
For
the foregoing reasons, the Investigator did not withhold exculpatory evidence.
To the extent that the Investigator improperly delayed in providing the
transcript of AM’s interview to petitioner, such error was harmless in light of
petitioner’s admission that the anal intercourse penetration occurred without
consent.

Purported
Failure to Follow Investigatory Leads
 
Witness
SS told the Investigator that the weekend before the subject incident started, Roe
told SS that she was going to Sigma Nu and that she knew the president, i.e.,
petitioner. (AR 339-40.) Petitioner contends that the Investigator did not
inquire who was with Roe and SS during their conversation. (Opening Br. at 10:18-22;
AR 1056 [Roe stated that she ran into SS and other friend].) However, SS told
the Investigator that she was alone during the conversation (AR 339), which
petitioner does not contest. (Reply at 4:4-5.)
 
Further,
the impeachment value of SS’s statement is hard to see.  Petitioner claims it would “heavily undermine
Roe’s credibility, especially since she asserted that she had never been to the
fraternity and did not know Doe.”  (Reply
at 4:8-10.)  But petitioner himself took
the position that he and Roe did not know one another prior to meeting at the
nightclub on October 15, 2021.  (See AR
572 [petitioner’s response to Investigative Report adopting assertion that
“[Petitioner] told me he did not know [Roe] until he met her at a bar on the
date and time in question”].)  Indeed, in
an October 16, 2021 text exchange between Roe and MM, which petitioner urged
respondents to scrutinize, Roe describes her initial impression of petitioner
from the night before as having no “red flags” because “he was very normal at
the start” (AR 591)—statements consistent with her meeting him for the first
time.  Further, similar to the finding above
with respect to AM’s statement, whether Roe had been to Sigma Nu prior to the
incident or stated that she knew petitioner has no bearing on the Hearing
Officer’s findings that petitioner had non-consensual anal intercourse with
Roe, particularly given petitioner’s admission of anal penetration without
prior consent. (AR 987-88, 993.) 
 
            Petitioner also argues that he
requested the Investigator to find out how his name was leaked and to
investigate the protests resulting in vandalism to the Sigma Nu property. (AR
515-16.) The Investigator was charged with investigating Roe’s allegations
against petitioner. (AR 246.) Petitioner’s
requests were not directly related to
Roe’s allegations. Accordingly, the Investigator appropriately determined that no
further fact gathering pursuant to petitioner’s request was necessary. (AR
2294.)
 
            Petitioner also argues that the
Investigator did not interview Witness LH, who was named by Roe as an
outreach/outcry witness and who had vilified petitioner on social media. (AR
515.) However, the Investigator did attempt to interview LH, but LH did not
respond to the Investigator’s request. (AR 468-69.)
 
For
the foregoing reasons, the Investigator did not fail to follow investigatory
leads. To the extent that the Investigator failed to pursue any purported
investigatory leads, such error was harmless in light of petitioner’s admission
that the anal intercourse was nonconsensual.

Purported
Improper Consideration of Statement of Witness
 
Petitioner
argues that the Hearing Officer should not have considered the report of Peter Perrin when the Hearing Officer made clear
that he could not rely on statements of parties or witnesses (such as Perrin)
who did not testify at the hearing and submit to cross-examination. (AR 54,
853.) 
 
In the written
determination by the Hearing Officer, he found that petitioner’s description of
his having entered Roe’s anus as “completely accidental” was contradicted by a
synopsis by Perrin of what petitioner told Perrin. (AR 3695.) Perrin had administered
a polygraph examination on petitioner. (AR 504-06.) In his report, Perrin
described petitioner’s description of the incident as follows: 
 
[Petitioner]
told me he did not know [Roe] until he met her at a bar on the date and time in
question. He said they danced and kissed, and after a short time, [Roe] agreed
to go to his residence with him. He said once at his residence they began to
kiss and took each other’s clothes off and engaged in consensual sex. [Petitioner]
said at one point he was behind [Roe] in “doggie style” position. He said his
penis entered her anus for a single thrust. He said [Roe] immediately tensed
and told him to stop. [Petitioner] said he stopped as soon as [Roe] told him to
stop. He said [Roe] told him she wanted to leave. He said he walked her to the
door where they hugged said the next day he was shocked to discover she had
made a complaint against him. 
 
(AR
504-05.) With respect to this account, the Hearing Officer found, “[i]n this
account, [petitioner]’s actions appear intentional, and there is no mention of [petitioner]’s
anal penetration of Reporting Party as being accidental.” (AR 3695.)
 
            USC’s Resolution Process for Sexual
Misconduct states: “The Hearing Officer will review the investigative report
and any written statements provided by the parties in response to the
investigative report, all exhibits, and any additional relevant evidence introduced
at the hearing.” (AR 53.) When petitioner submitted his written response to the
Investigative Report, on the very first page of his response, petitioner
asserted that “widely respected polygrapher, Pete Perrin, synopsized what
happened when he summarized my statement to him,” followed by the above excerpt
from Perrin’s report quoted verbatim. (AR 572.) 
Petitioner thus adopted the above statement by Perrin as his own.  There is no question that petitioner
testified during the hearing and was subject to cross-examination. (AR 914-15,
982, 1002.) Accordingly, pursuant to the Resolution Process for Sexual
Misconduct policy, the Hearing Officer was entitled to consider the portion of
Perrin’s report that petitioner himself adopted. 
 
            For the foregoing reasons, the
Hearing Officer did not improperly incorporate Perrin’s summary of the incident
into the written determination.
 
B.          
Substantial
Evidence Supporting Hearing Officer’s Finding
 
During
the hearing, petitioner maintained that his contact with Roe’s anus was “completely
accidental.” (AR 1125.) The Hearing Officer found this assertion not credible.
(AR 1125.) The Hearing Officer relied on the testimony of Dr. Thomas,
petitioner’s adoption of Perrin’s summary, and petitioner’s inconsistent
testimony regarding the degree of anal penetration. (AR 1125.)
 
With
respect to the testimony of Dr. Thomas, she testified that petitioner described
the sexual activity in which he and Roe engaged as consensual. (AR 1125, 3693; see
also AR 3378 [Dr. Thomas testified that petitioner told him “[t]hat they
had sex, and she was mad at him, and he said he was drunk, and most of the
conduct was between the two of them. He was adamant that he didn’t rape anybody,
and that their conduct was consensual”].) Dr. 
Thomas did not mention any statement from petitioner that any sexual
act, including anal penetration, was accidental. 
 
With
respect to Perrin’s summary of petitioner’s account of the incident, the
Hearing Officer found that such account describes intentional actions on the
part of petitioner, not accidental. (AR 3695.) Petitioner told Perrin that “he
entered [Roe]’s anus with his penis” without mentioning that it was accidental.

 
With respect to the
degree of anal penetration, petitioner stated initially that he believed his
penis did not fully enter Roe’s anus, explaining that it just “hit the
surface.” (AR 987-88.) When later asked how he knew that his penis was in Roe’s
anus rather than her vagina, petitioner testified that he could feel the difference
stating: “it just didn’t feel like the same area I’d been in. It was ... I
don't know. I don’t really want to get into it, but if you've been having sex, vagina
gets looser. This was not the same area that I was previously in.” (AR 1032.) Petitioner’s
statement suggests a greater degree of anal penetration compared to the degree
to which he had earlier testified. 
 
The
finding that petitioner engaged in non-consensual anal intercourse is subject
to a review for substantial evidence. Based on petitioner’s description to Dr.
Thomas of his sexual acts with Roe as consensual, petitioner’s incorporation of
Perrin’s summary which contained no mention that the anal penetration was
accidental, and petitioner’s inconsistent statements regarding the degree of
anal penetration, a reasonable person was entitled to find that petitioner’s
description of his contact with Roe’s anus as accidental was not credible. 
 
In
the reply, petitioner focuses on the fact that four of the five allegations
against him were unsubstantiated. (Reply at 7:12-22.) That may be true, but it
has no bearing on whether substantial evidence supported the finding that
petitioner engaged in non-consensual anal intercourse, as claimed by Roe.  Indeed, it merely demonstrates that the
Hearing Officer found that petitioner’s account on some issues was more
reliable that Roe’s account and that Roe’s account on other issues was more
reliable than petitioner’s account.  On
substantial evidence review, this Court does not evaluate the credibility or
witnesses or reweigh the evidence; rather, this Court’s review is limited to
whether there is sufficient evidence to support the findings that were
made.  (Doe, 5 Cal.App.5th at
1073.)
 
            For the foregoing reasons, the Court
finds that substantial evidence supported the Hearing Officer’s finding that
petitioner engaged in anal intercourse with Roe without her consent. 
 
For
sexual assault, expulsion is a reasonable sanction. If reasonable minds can
differ with regard to the propriety of the disciplinary action, there is no
abuse of discretion. (County of Los Angeles v. Civil Service Commission
(1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 620, 634.) The Court does not find any manifest abuse of
discretion from the imposition of discretion. (See Lake v. Civil Service
Commission (1975) 47 Cal.App.3d 224, 228.)
 
C.          
Purported
Bias
 
Petitioner
contends that USC was pressured by the community to find him in violation given
the publicity of the allegations and protest against Sigma Nu. (AR 512.) Mere accusations
of bias and prejudice on the part of an administrative decisionmaker are insufficient;
assertions of bias and prejudice must be supported by “clear averments.” (Burrell
v. City of Los Angeles (1989) 209 Cal.App.3d 568, 582, quoting Andrews
v. Agricultural Labor Relations Bd. (1981) 28 Cal.3d 781, 792.) 
 
Petitioner
fails to establish that either the Hearing Officer or respondents were biased. Petitioner
argues that the Hearing Officer excluded testimony of witnesses who did not
submit to cross-examination, when USC did not enforce this written policy in
other cases. (AR 2769; Opening Br. at 14:6-12.) However, prior to the start of
the hearing, the Hearing Officer asked whether the written policy was still
being enforced. (AR 2769.) Although no direct response to the Hearing Officer’s
inquiry is cited by either party, the record reflects that the Hearing Officer
applied the written policy during the hearing and that USC was following its
policy as written. (AR 765, 853, 1105, 2862 [7/26/22 response from Spear to SS
that policy is being followed].) The Hearing Officer’s application of the
written policy is not evidence of bias. 
 
            Petitioner also argues that the
Hearing Officer neglected the scheduling of witnesses, in particular Witness
SS. According to petitioner, the Hearing Officer should not have rescheduled SS,
who purportedly had exculpatory evidence, in favor of MM, who was not present
during the alleged conduct. As stated above, the Court disagrees that SS’s
testimony would have been exculpatory or meaningfully impeached Roe. Even if SS
could exculpate petitioner, there was no showing that the Hearing Officer knew
SS would not be available after July 26, when she was scheduled to testify. MM
had indicated that she was traveling on July 27. (AR 2844-45.) By contrast, SS
never indicated that she was not available on July 27. (AR 2859-61.) Further,
petitioner agreed to the rescheduling during the hearing. (AR 736 [“Everything
sounds great. Thank you”].) Accordingly, the Hearing Officer’s attempts to
accommodate the testimony of both MM and SS does not evidence any bias. 
 
            In the reply, petitioner also argues
that the Hearing Officer had a pecuniary interest in remaining employed by USC
to adjudicate student misconduct matters. The Hearing Officer’s mere
appointment by USC is insufficient to establish a disqualifying financial
interest, without more. (See El-Attar v. Hollywood Presbyterian Medical
Center (2013) 56 Cal.4th 976, 996 [“We see nothing in the mere fact of
having been appointed by a hospital’s governing body instead of by the medical
staff that would inherently cast doubt on the impartiality of a review hearing
participant”].) Petitioner widely speculates that “USC would not be paying for
the Hearing Officer’s services in future cases if he did not generate a finding
favorable to USC.” (Reply at 6:22-24.) Petitioner presents no evidence about how
USC selects its hearing officers to demonstrate that Mr. O’Donnell, the Hearing
Officer here, faced the risk of exclusion from future work if he were to find contrary
to USC’s interests. (Cf. Haas v. County of San Bernardino (2002)
27 Cal.4th 1017, 1020-21 [“Counties that appoint temporary administrative
hearing officers must do so in a way that does not create the risk that
favorable decisions will be rewarded with future remunerative work. The ad hoc
procedure used here does create that risk”].) Accordingly, petitioner’s
assertion of the Hearing Officer’s purported financial interest is insufficient
to demonstrate bias. 
 
            With respect to respondents, while
they were the ultimate decisionmakers who affirmed the Hearing Officer’s
findings and imposed expulsion as a sanction, respondent Allard carefully
considered petitioner’s bases for appeal and determined them to be without
merit. (AR 1220-38.) Petitioner fails to demonstrate
the “clear averments” necessary to establish bias on the part of respondents.
