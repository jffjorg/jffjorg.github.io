[1]           Petitioner served the reply on
respondent by mail at 2400 Venture Oaks Way Suite 100, Sacramento, CA 95833.
(3/4/24 Proof of Service.) However, respondent’s counsel is located at 300
South Spring Street, Suite 1702, Los Angeles, CA 90013-1230. (11/14/23 Answer;
2/20/24 Opposition.) Nevertheless, petitioner served the opening brief on
respondent by mail at the Sacramento address, and respondent was able to file a
timely opposition. Accordingly, it appears that respondent can receive filings
through the Sacramento address. The Court, therefore, considers the reply.
