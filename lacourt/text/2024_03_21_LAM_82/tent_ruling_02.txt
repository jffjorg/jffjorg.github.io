“had suffered sexual assault on prior occasions,” because petitioner sought to
exclude such evidence as “not probative of the veracity of [Roe]’s allegations
regarding [petitioner]’s conduct on October 15-16, 2021.” (AR 3677.)  The Hearing Officer agreed with petitioner
that he should not rely on such evidence in making any findings whether
petitioner committed any of the act alleged by Roe.  (AR 3677.)
