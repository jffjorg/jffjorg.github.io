And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion to compel arbitration in this case. The dispute arises from a written purchase agreement between the plaintiff, MARK LANGE, and the defendants, SANDRA HANOVER EBNER and STEPHEN EBNER, for the sale of a home in Malibu, California. The plaintiff alleges that the defendants failed to disclose defects in the property, including the fact that the septic tank systems were not compliant with city standards. The defendants argue that the parties agreed to arbitrate disputes in the arbitration agreement, but the judge has ruled that the arbitration provision only applies to disputes "arising out of" the agreement and does not encompass tort claims. The judge has concluded that the plaintiff's claims are not subject to arbitration and has denied the defendants' motion.
