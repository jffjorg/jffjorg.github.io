And here is the English-text summary of the Tentative Ruling:

The Court has reviewed the motions for determination of good faith settlement by Settling Defendants Pacific Coast Developers, Premium, Inc., Schick Geotechnical Inc., and United Excavation Group, Inc. The case involves a construction defect lawsuit by Tracie Calfee Dalton against Ocean Santa Barbara Investments, LLC, et al. The Settling Defendants argue that their settlements are "within the ballpark" of their relative liability and that the settlements were made in good faith. The Court has considered the factors set forth in Tech-Bilt, Inc. v. Woodward-Clyde & Associates, including the rough approximation of the plaintiff's total recovery and the settlor's proportionate liability, the amount of the settlement, the allocation of settlement proceeds among plaintiffs, the financial condition and insurance policy limits of the settling defendants, the discount for settlement before trial, and the evidence of collusion, fraud, or tortious conduct. Based on these factors, the Court concludes that the settlements are in good faith and grants the motions for determination of good faith settlement.
