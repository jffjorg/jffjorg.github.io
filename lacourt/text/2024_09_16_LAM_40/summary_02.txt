Here is a summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's motion for trial preference. The plaintiff, LEO DAVID TUMANYAN, a minor born with multiple serious health conditions, is seeking a preferential trial date due to his age and health circumstances. The defendants argue that the plaintiff has been dilatory throughout the litigation and that they will suffer significant prejudice if the trial date is deemed preferential. The judge finds that the plaintiff has a substantial interest in the case and that the defendants have failed to provide valid defenses to mandatory preference. Therefore, the motion for trial preference is granted, and the trial date will not be subject to continuance, except as specified by California Code of Civil Procedure section 36 subdivision (f).
