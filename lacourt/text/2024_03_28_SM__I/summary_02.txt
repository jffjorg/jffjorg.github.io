And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the request for a continuance, and the hearing will proceed as scheduled. The applications for writs of attachment have also been denied. The court found that the applicant, Ramirez, did not timely amend the cross-complaint to add cross-defendants, and many of the writ applications were for non-parties. Additionally, Ramirez sues everyone else in tort, and the writ does not lie in tort. The court has also noted that Ramirez did not take advantage of a previous leave to amend the cross-complaint, which means that the cross-defendants are not in default.
