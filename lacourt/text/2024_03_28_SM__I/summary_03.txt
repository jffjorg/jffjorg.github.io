And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling is that the ex parte application's alternative request for an OST (Order Shortening Time) will be granted. The plaintiff is seeking to re-open discovery, citing exigent circumstances. The judge believes that the parties should meet and confer today to discuss a limited re-opening of discovery. The judge understands why the plaintiff did not complete discovery, as the parties thought they had settled the case and did not want to incur unnecessary expenses. The judge is willing to consider re-opening discovery for written discovery already on the horizon when the informal stay began, but not for alleged new violations. The judge strongly urges the parties to get their settlement back on track and reminds them that they will be held to the court's FSC requirements and can expect sanctions if they do not fully comply. The hearing will be held on April 3, 2024, at 9:00 am.
