 Case Number:  23SMCV01089    Hearing Date:   March 28, 2024    Dept:  I The three unopposed motions to compel are GRANTED.  Verified responses, without objection other
than privilege, will be served no later than 30 days from today.  Documents will be served at the same
time.  If a privilege is asserted over a
document, it will be logged sufficient to make out a prima facie case
establishing privilege.  The request for
sanctions is GRANTED in the amount of $1770 for all motions combined inclusive
of filing fees.  The reduction is due in
part to the virtually cut and paste nature of the motions and the fact that the
motions are unopposed so no time was needed to review the oppositions or
reply.  The court is not criticizing the
fact that the motions are cut and paste—they are essentially identical in many
ways and so that is the most efficient way to do things.  It simply means that the overall cost is less
than it otherwise would be.
