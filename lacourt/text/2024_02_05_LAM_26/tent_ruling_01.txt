  Case Number:  23STCP03449    Hearing Date:   February 5, 2024    Dept:  26 The mandatory name change criminal
history assessment form has not been processed either because Petitioner has
failed to complete and file a request for a name change criminal history
assessment or because Probation needs more time to complete such a form. The
filing of the document from the Attorney General for California Criminal
History Information alone is insufficient as this document must be also be
included with the mandatory Name Change Criminal Assessment form completed by
Probation.
 
If Petitioner has failed to complete
the name change criminal history assessment form, Petitioner must contact
Probation at 213-974-5821, (323) 430-8260 or (323) 430-8429 and requesting the
Name Change Probation Officer to have said form completed before the continued
hearing date.  Otherwise, the instant
petition will be denied without prejudice.
 
Accordingly, the hearing on this
matter is continued to February 26, 2024 at 9:30 a.m. 
Court Clerk to give notice.
