And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies the petition without prejudice due to the petitioner's failure to provide identification tied to a fingerprint, which is necessary for probation to run a criminal history assessment. The court had previously ordered the petitioner to provide such identification, but the petitioner failed to comply. The ID number provided by the petitioner does not match the petitioner, and the petitioner has not otherwise verified their identity. The court has given the petitioner an opportunity to submit a new petition addressing this issue.
