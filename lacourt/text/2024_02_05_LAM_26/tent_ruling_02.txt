 Case Number:  23STCP04106    Hearing Date:   February 5, 2024    Dept:  26 Petitioner has failed to provide any
form of identification tied to a fingerprint on file, which is necessary for
Probation to run a criminal history assessment. 
On December 18, 2023, the Court continued the petition noting this issue
and ordered Petitioner to provide Probation with some form of identification
verified by a fingerprint to enable Probation to run a criminal history
assessment and identified how this may be done. 
However, Petitioner failed to do so. 
The ID number provided by Petitioner does not match petitioner, and Petitioner
has not otherwise verified her identity.   Accordingly, the instant petition is DENIED
WITHOUT PREJUDICE. Petitioner may submit a new petition addressing the lack of
identification tied to a fingerprint for Probation to run a criminal history
assessment.
Court Clerk to give notice.
