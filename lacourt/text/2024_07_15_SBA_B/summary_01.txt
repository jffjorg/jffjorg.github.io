And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion in limine filed by the plaintiff, 5901 Century Owner, LLC, in a lawsuit against Festival Management Corporation. The plaintiff is seeking to recover unpaid rent of $673,956.32, and the defendant is attempting to introduce evidence related to the Los Angeles County COVID-19 Tenant Protections Resolution. The judge has granted the motion, ruling that the defendant failed to properly plead its affirmative defense under the Resolution and that the evidence is therefore not admissible. The judge's decision is based on the fact that the defendant did not assert the Resolution as an affirmative defense at any point in the proceeding, and that the plaintiff's allegations of the existence of COVID ordinances and resolutions did not relieve the defendant of its obligation to plead its affirmative defense. The judge has also noted that the defendant's general denial of the material allegations was insufficient to constitute the affirmative defense, and that the defendant failed to plead the Resolution-based affirmative defense in a way that would give notice to the plaintiff. The judge's ruling is intended to prevent the introduction of evidence that may be irrelevant or prejudicial to the case.
