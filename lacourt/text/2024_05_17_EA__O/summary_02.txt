And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court's tentative ruling discusses the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the County in response to Eva's claim that the County has a mandatory duty to provide information to her regarding the placement of her great-grandson, Noah, who passed away. The court finds that the County does have a mandatory duty to consider Eva for placement of Noah, and that the County's procedures are inconsistent with Welfare & Institutions Code section 361.3. The court also notes that the County's argument that treatment of the Handbook as a regulation creates an inconsistency between the regulation and the statute is without merit.
