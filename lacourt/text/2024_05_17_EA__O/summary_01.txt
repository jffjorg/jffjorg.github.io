And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the County of Los Angeles. The court has overruled the demurrer to the 2nd Cause of Action, which alleged that the County breached its mandatory duty to contact Eva, Noah's great-great grandmother, who had been given preferential consideration for placement of the child. The court has also denied the motion to strike portions of the 6th Amended Complaint, except for paragraphs 120-135, which are stricken.

The court found that the County breached its mandatory duty to contact Eva, and that equitable estoppel applies to the 8th Cause of Action. The court also denied the County's argument that the Manual of Policies and Procedures for Child Welfare Services is not a regulation.

The court has ordered the parties to file supplemental briefing on the demurrer and motion to strike.
