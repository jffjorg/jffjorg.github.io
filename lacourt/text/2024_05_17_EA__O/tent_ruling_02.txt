[1] Due to the numerous
filings in this case, the procedural background of the case will only discuss
pertinent filings to this demurrer and motion to strike. 
 


[2] Eva is Noah’s
biological great-grandmother. AC is Noah’s biological sister, who is currently
five years old. EC is Noah’s biological brother and is currently ten years old.
RC’s, who is three years old, was Noah’s unborn sibling at the time of his
death. They will collectively be referred to as the “Minor Plaintiffs.” 
 


[3] Hathaway is a mental
health and welfare agency that provides behavioral services to dependent
minors. The County and Hathaway have a contract wherein Hathaway promises to
provide psychological counseling and family support services for consumers
referred by the County. (Id. ¶33.) 
 


[4] The RJN (Exhibits
A-E) is GRANTED pursuant to Evidence Code section 452 subdivision (h).
(Exhibits A-C are the ‘Claim for Damages to Person or Property’ (“Government
Tort Claim”) filed by each of the siblings.) 
 


[5] As the
court has already provided a thorough analysis on the issue of a mandatory duty
to Eva, the court will not belabor the point in this ruling. 
 


[6] And according to the County, WIC “has the potential …of
stating a mandatory duty.” (Demurrer p. 11:12-14.)

section E infra. 
 


[8] According to the
demurrer, after a child is placed in an emergency placement for 72 hours, there
would have to be a detention hearing pursuant to WIC section 315. (Demurrer p.
14.) The purpose of the detention hearing is to determine whether the child should
be further detained (i.e., continuing placement). The determination of who
the child is placed with for continued placement is determined by the
juvenile dependency court, not DCFS. If at the detention hearing Eva was
considered for Noah’s continued placement, then she would be entitled to
know why he had been removed. (Demurrer p. 14, citing WIC section
361.3.) 


 
[9] Per WIC section 309(c), “If the child is not released to their parent or
guardian, the child shall be deemed detained for purposes of this chapter.” 


[10] According to the
County, “AB 404 made various changes to procedures relating to the placement of
dependent children, including, among other things, by revising the preference
to make a placement with specified relatives and, instead, to grant a preference
for placement with any relative… While Welfare & Institutions Code section
361.3 was updated effective January 1, 2018 to reflect this change, section
361.3 of the Handbook, 1514 through 366.3 was not amended.” (Demurrer pp.
16-17.) Thus, the Handbook still contains the guidance that “only the following
relatives shall be given preferential consideration for the placement of the
child: an adult who is a grandparent, aunt, uncle, or sibling.”

And the County appears to argue that there is an inconsistency between
the two. (See Demurrer pp.
21-22: [“[T]reating [the Manual] as a regulation creates inconsistency between
a regulation and a statute.”].)
