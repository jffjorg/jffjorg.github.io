And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants, S&S Worldwide, Inc., S&S Power, Inc., and S&S Arrow LLC, on all four causes of action brought by the plaintiffs, Sheila Katerelos and Ari Katerelos. The plaintiffs alleged that Sheila Katerelos suffered a subdural hematoma or traumatic brain injury on the X2 roller coaster at Six Flags Magic Mountain theme park on February 16, 2020. The defendants filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that there was no evidence to support the plaintiffs' claims.

The judge found that the defendants met their burden of showing that there was no evidence to support the plaintiffs' claims, and that the plaintiffs failed to establish causation. The judge also found that the plaintiffs failed to present sufficient evidence to demonstrate a design or manufacturing defect in the X2 roller coaster, and that the claim for loss of consortium was derivative of the negligence causes of action and was therefore barred.

The judge granted summary judgment on all four causes of action, including negligence, strict product liability, negligent product liability, and loss of consortium. The defendants are ordered to submit a proposed judgment, and the plaintiffs will be notified of the ruling.
