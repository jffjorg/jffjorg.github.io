And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has sustained the demurrer to the Third Cause of Action for Negligence and the Fourth Cause of Action for Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress with leave to amend. The judge found that the complaint did not state facts sufficient to allege a cause of action for negligence against the City of Los Angeles because it failed to cite a statutory basis for the duty that the City allegedly breached. The judge also found that the complaint did not state a common law cause of action for negligent infliction of emotional distress against the City, a public entity, pursuant to the Government Claims Act. The judge gave the plaintiffs 30 days' leave to amend their complaint.
