And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal. The plaintiff argues that her attorney failed to properly calendar the November 20 hearing date, resulting in her failure to appear. However, the judge finds that the blame for the failure to appear lies with the plaintiff's attorney, and that the motion was filed one day late. The judge notes that the six-month deadline for filing the motion is mandatory and cannot be extended. Therefore, the motion must be denied.
