And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Clark Crozer and Karen Crozer (Plaintiffs) vs. General Motors, LLC (Defendant). The Plaintiffs have moved to compel the attendance of Defendant's Person Most Qualified (PMQ) at deposition and for monetary sanctions in the amount of $2,970.00. The Defendant has objected to the deposition notice, claiming that the Plaintiffs failed to meet and confer and that the requested materials are irrelevant or protected as trade secrets.

The judge has ordered the parties to meet and confer to find a mutually agreeable date for the deposition, taking into account the topics listed in the Court's Lemon Law discovery order. The judge has also ordered the parties to review the acceptable topics for a PMQ deposition and to proceed with the meet and confer and deposition based on those topics.

The judge has declined to issue sanctions at this time, but warned that if either party fails to comply with this order, the Court will determine if sanctions are appropriate.
