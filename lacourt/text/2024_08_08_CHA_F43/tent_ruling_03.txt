SUMMARY OF
ACTION
On June 1, 2022,
Plaintiff Jennie Medina (Plaintiff) filed her complaint against Defendant Paulo
Salinas Jr. (Defendant). The complaint was related to breach of contract and
fraud.
 
On August 2,
2023, Plaintiff failed to appear for a case management conference. On that
date, the Court set a hearing on an Order to Show Case Re: Plaintiff’s Failure
to Appear/Obtain Default Judgment, scheduled for November 20, 2023. Plaintiff
also failed to appear for the Order to Show Cause hearing on November 20, so
the Court dismissed the entire action without prejudice.
 
On May 21,
2024, Plaintiff filed this motion to set aside dismissal pursuant to CCP § 473.
Plaintiff argues in her motion that her counsel failed to properly calendar the
November 20 date and subsequently failed to make the appearance. Plaintiff’s
motion includes a sworn declaration from her attorney, Stephen J. Horvath,
indicating that he failed to calendar the hearing date and takes full
responsibility for the failure to appear.
 
ANALYSIS
CCP Section
473(b) states as follows: 
“The court may, upon any terms as may be
just, relieve a party or his or her legal representative from a judgment,
dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against him or her through his or
her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect…Notwithstanding any
other requirements of [§ 473(b)] the court shall, whenever an application for
relief is made no more than six months after entry of judgment, is in proper
form, and is accompanied by an attorney’s sworn affidavit attesting to his or her
mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect, vacate any (1) resulting default
entered by the clerk against his or her client, and which will result in entry
of a default judgment…unless the court finds that the default or dismissal was
not in fact caused by the attorney’s mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or
neglect.”
 
The law favors
hearings on the merits, so any doubts as to the application of CCP § 473 should
be resolved in favor of the party seeking relief from default or dismissal. (See
Shapiro v. Clark (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1139-1140.)
 
Horvath,
Plaintiff’s attorney, claims that the failure to appear was due to his mistake,
inadvertence, or neglect. He also claims that because of a calendaring failure,
he did not appear at the hearings.
 
It appears that
the blame for not appearing lies with Plaintiff’s attorney. The motion filed by
Plaintiff’s attorney is in the proper form and is accompanied by a sworn
declaration from Defendants’ attorney. However, the Court will note that such
motions are to be filed no more than six months after the dismissal. The
dismissal was entered on November 20, 2023. This motion was filed on May 21,
2024. Six months from November 20, 2023, would have been Monday, May 20, 2024. Plaintiff’s
motion was filed one day late, and Plaintiff’s attorney does not say when he
received the minute order nor give any reasons for why the motion was not filed
sooner. (See Younessi v. Woolf (2016) 244 Cal.App.4th 1137 (the motion
must be filed within a reasonable time not exceeding six month).) Furthermore,
the six month deadline is mandatory and the trial court is not authorized to
extend the six-month period. (See Arambula v. Union Carbide Corp. (2005)
128 Cal.App.4th 333, 344.) Therefore, Plaintiff’s motion must be denied.
 
Plaintiff’s motion
to set aside dismissal is denied.
