```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Powermax Electric Co. Ltd. Guangdong's motion to quash service of summons. Powermax, a Chinese corporation, argued that the court lacks personal jurisdiction over it because it has no offices, employees, bank accounts, or real property in California. The court agrees with Powermax that it does not have general jurisdiction over the company.

Powermax also argued that the court does not have specific jurisdiction over it because it did not purposefully avail itself of the benefits of the California forum. The court agrees with Powermax that there is no evidence that Powermax purposefully directed its activities toward California or expected to be haled into court there.

The court also finds that Powermax does not have minimum contacts with California, and therefore, the exercise of specific jurisdiction over it would offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.

As a result, Powermax is dismissed from the action. The court will not order additional discovery on the jurisdictional issue.
