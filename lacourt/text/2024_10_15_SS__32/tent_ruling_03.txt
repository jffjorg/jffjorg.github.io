MOTION
 
Plaintiff Tara Rogachefsky (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint against Defendant
Kate McCaslin (“Defendant”), and DOES 1 to 100, inclusive, alleging causes of
action for (1) Negligence and (2) Negligence Per Se. Defendant McCaslin now moves
for an order compelling Plaintiff to attend a deposition and monetary sanctions
in the total sum of $1,170.00 for failure to appear and bringing this motion. 
 
 
ANALYSIS
 
Under Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.010, any party may obtain
discovery (subject to the scope and restrictions provided by law) “by taking in
California the oral deposition of any person, including any party to the
action. The person deposed may be a natural person, an organization such as a
public or private corporation, a partnership, an association, or a governmental
agency.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.010.)
 
“If, after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action or an
officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a party, or a person
designated by an organization that is a party under Section 2025.230, without
having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to appear for
examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for inspection any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order compelling
the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of
any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in
the deposition notice.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (a).) 
 
“If an objection is made three calendar days before the deposition
date, the objecting party shall make personal service of that objection
pursuant to Section 1011 on the party who gave notice of the deposition. Any
deposition taken after the service of a written objection shall not be used
against the objecting party under Section 2025.620 if the party did not attend
the deposition and if the court determines that the objection was a valid one.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.410, subd. (b).)
 
“If a motion under subdivision (a) is granted, the court shall impose
a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) in favor
of the party who noticed the deposition and against the deponent or the party
with whom the deponent is affiliated, unless the court finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2025.450, subd. (g)(1).)¿ 
 
Here, Defendant McCaslin asserts she served a Notice of Taking of
Deposition on Plaintiff set for February 19, 2024 at 2:00 p.m. (Opfell Decl.,
¶3, Ex. A.) However, Defendant asserts the February 19, 2024 deposition was
taken off calendar per Plaintiff’s counsel’s request to attempt a settlement of
the case. (Id. at ¶4, Ex. B.) After settlement attempts were
unsuccessful, Defendant requested Plaintiff provide available dates for
Plaintiff’s deposition, which were not provided. (Id. at ¶6.) As such,
Defendant contends she served a Notice of Taking of Deposition on Plaintiff set
for April 10, 2024 at 2:00 p.m. (Id., Ex. C.) Defendant contend
Plaintiff’s counsel advised he was unavailable for the April 10th date
due to a trial he was participating in, thus Defendant served another notice
setting the deposition for April 23, 2024. (Id. at ¶¶7-8, Exs. D-E.)
Plaintiff’s counsel again advised the April 23rd would not work and
indicated he was booked until October or November, which led the parties to
stipulate to a trial continuance from November 1, 2024 to February 3, 2025. (Id.
at ¶9.) The final deposition was for August 2, 2024. (Id. at ¶10, Ex.
F.)
 
Defendant asserts Plaintiff failed to appear for the deposition for any
of the noticed dates and did not file objections to the notice. Plaintiff’s
counsel failed to file a formal objection to the August 2, 2024 deposition date
and only advised defense counsel of his unavailability the day before the
noticed date. (Opfell Decl., ¶11.) No opposition has been filed. Accordingly,
the Court grants the motion to compel.
 
Defendant seeks $410.00 in sanctions and attorneys’ fees associated
with 1.0 hour preparing the instant motion and 2.0 hours for attending the
hearing on the motion including travel time at an hourly rate of $175.00 plus
the filing fee of $60.00. (Opfell Decl., ¶14.) The Court finds that sanctions
are warranted but the amount is excessive in light of the nature of the motion,
and because it is unopposed and counsel can appear remotely at any hearing.
Accordingly, the Court awards monetary sanctions in the amount of $322.50 (1.5
hours of attorney time plus the filing fee).
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
Based on the foregoing, the Court grants Defendant Kate McCaslin’s Motion
to Compel Deposition. Plaintiff shall appear for deposition within 20 days.
 
Plaintiff[1] is
ordered to pay $322.50 in monetary sanctions to counsel for Defendant within 30
days of this order. 
 
Defendant shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file a proof
of service of such.
