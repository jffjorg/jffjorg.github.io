The Court also awards monetary sanctions of $322.50 to counsel for Defendant, which must be paid within 30 days of this order. The Court finds that Plaintiff failed to appear for deposition on multiple dates and did not file formal objections to the deposition notice, and therefore, the sanctions are warranted.
