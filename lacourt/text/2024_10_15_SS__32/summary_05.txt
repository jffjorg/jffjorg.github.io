And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on Defendant Target Corporation's Motion to be Relieved from Admissions. The motion was filed in response to Plaintiff Nancy Pogue's Requests for Admission (Set One), which Defendant failed to answer. Defendant claims that its failure to answer was due to mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect, but the judge finds that this claim is not supported by the evidence.

The judge notes that Defendant's handling attorney attests to being on vacation when her paralegal discovered the continued hearing date and did not return until after the hearing date, but Plaintiff has provided an email chain showing that Defendant's handling attorney acknowledged the email regarding noticed of the continued hearing date and added her paralegal to the chain.

The judge also notes that Defendant provides no explanation for why counsel could not serve responses between August 2 and August 5, when at least one counsel was present. Counsel needing to prepare for another trial is not a sufficient basis for relief.

Based on the foregoing, the judge denies Defendant's Motion to be Relieved from Admissions. Defendant shall provide notice of the Court's ruling and file a proof of service of such.
