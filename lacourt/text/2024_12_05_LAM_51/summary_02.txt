And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The court has denied the defendant's motion for an order requiring an undertaking in the amount of $400,000.00. The defendant argued that an undertaking was necessary to protect its interests in the suit, which it claims is meritless. However, the court found that Corporations Code § 5710 does not apply to the defendant, as it is a nonprofit religious corporation. The court instead relied on Corporations Code §§ 9140-9143, which pertain to nonprofit religious corporations. The court concluded that an undertaking is not warranted in this case, and therefore denied the defendant's motion.
