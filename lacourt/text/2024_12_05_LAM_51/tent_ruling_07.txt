Pursuant to Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.113(d), the court disregards argument
exceeding the 15 page memorandum limit on the demurrer. This includes the
purported supplemental briefing provided by Defendant since they did not seek
leave of court to file more than the allowable page limit. This also occurred
after repeated warnings by the court of the excessed in filings both in number
and in breadth.

Demurrer to the Complaint for failure to
state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.TENTATIVE RULING:  1.      Demurrer
to the Complaint is OVERRULED.STATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:  On June 12, 2024, Plaintiffs Rafael Raz, Fariba Ysmini,
Ohisri Yamini, Orit Nazarian, Shlomo Sherf, Javid S. Rad, Mike Noor, and David
Dardashti (Plaintiffs) filed a Verified Complaint against Defendant Beith David
Education Center for an Order Voiding Purported Election of Non0Profit
Corporation and Ordering a New Properly Supervised Election. On June 20, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a Request for Dismissal
as to Plaintiff Javid S. Rad only. On June 21, 2024, Defendant filed a Motion for Order
Requiring Undertaking. On June 21, 2024, Defendant filed a Demurrer. On June 28, 2024 Defendant filed another Demurrer. On June 28, 2024, Defendant filed another Motion for Order
Requiring Undertaking. On August 5, 2024, Plaintiffs filed the instant Motion to
Quash Subpoenas.  On October 9, 2024, Defendant filed supplemental briefs in
support of its Demurrer.[1] On November 20, 2024, Defendant filed an opposition to the
Motion to Quash Subpoenas. On November 21, 2024, Plaintiffs filed Oppositions to the
Demurrer and to the Motion for Undertaking. Replies were due on or before November 26, 2024. As of
December 2, 2024, the court has not received reply briefs. LEGAL STANDARD:  Meet and Confer Prior to filing a demurrer, the demurring party is required
to satisfy their meet and confer obligations
pursuant to Code of Civ. Proc. (CCP) §430.41 and demonstrate that they so
satisfied their meet and confer obligation by submitting a declaration pursuant
to CCP §430.41(a)(2) & (3). Here, Defendant’s meet and confer declaration
was not readily available to the court. As such, the court cannot determine
whether the parties sufficiently met and conferred. Still, failure to meet and
confer is not a sufficient ground to overrule or sustain a demurrer. (CCP §
430.41(a)(4).) Demurrer A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint states
a cause of action.¿(Hahn v. Mirda¿(2007)
147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When considering demurrers, courts read the
allegations liberally and in context.¿In a demurrer proceeding, the defects
must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice.¿(Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004)
116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)¿“A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the
evidence or other extrinsic matters. …. The only issue involved in a demurrer
hearing is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous
matters, states a cause of action.”¿(Hahn¿147
Cal.App.4th at 747.)¿¿  Request for Judicial
Notice The court DENIES Defendant’s request for judicial notice. ANALYSIS:  Pendency of First
Action – CCP 430.10(c) Defendant contends this matter should be dismissed because
there is a pending matter involving the same parties and the same dispute (the
Petition matter). Plaintiffs argue that the Petition matter is no longer
pending. Defendant did not provide a reply. A plea in abatement is disfavored, but it will be successful
if “(1) [t]hat both suits are predicated upon the same cause of action; (2)
that both suits are pending in the same jurisdiction; and (3) that both suits
are contested by the same parties.”  (Conservatorship
of Pacheco (1990) 224 Cal.App.3d 171, 176; internal quotations
omitted.)  Moreover, in order to qualify as “another action pending,”
first, the parties must stand in the same relationship (i.e., plaintiff or
defendant) in both suits.  (Plant Insulation
Co. v. Fibreboard Corp. (1990) 224 Cal.App.3d 781, 789.)  Second, the
identical cause of action must be involved in both suits, so that a judgment in
the first action would be res judicata on the claim in the present
lawsuit.  (Bush v. Superior Court (1992)
10 Cal.App.4th 1374, 1384.)  The fact that some of the same issues are
involved so that a finding in either case would give rise to collateral
estoppel in the other is not enough if in fact two different causes of action
are involved.  (Id.)  Further,
courts have concluded that the fact that the same evidence tends to prove both
causes is not enough if the causes of action are different.  (Conservatorship of Pacheco, 224
Cal.App.3d at 176.) Here, Defendant’s argument is not well taken. As the court
pointed out in a prior hearing, in order to invoke Corporation Code § 9418(b) preference
benefit, a complaint must be filed. The prior action, while predicated on the
same cause of action – namely, seeking a new election— was a petition. As such,
the pleadings did not have the benefit of section 9418.   Accordingly, the court OVERRULES the demurrer on this
ground. Procedural Defects Defendant contends Plaintiffs failed to comply with Corps.
Code §§ 7616, 9130[2],
9223[3],
9418, and 5710. i.                   
Corporations Code § 7616Here, Defendant’s contention that Plaintiffs failed to
comply with § 7616 is not well taken because, as Defendant is aware, subsection
(c) provides for service of notice of the hearing
date in the same method of service of the summons. There is not yet a hearing
set. ii.                 
Corporations Code § 9418“Upon the filing of an action therefor by any director or
member, or by any person who had the right to vote in the election at issue
after such director, member, or person has exhausted any remedies provided in
the articles or bylaws, the superior court of the proper county shall determine
the validity of any election or appointment of any director of any
corporation.” (Corps. Code § 9418(a).) This section also provides for a hearing
date. (Id. at subd. (b).) Again, there is not yet a hearing date. iii.               
Corporations Code § 5710“No action may be instituted or maintained in the right of
any corporation by any member of such corporation unless both of the following
conditions exist: (1) The plaintiff alleges in the complaint that plaintiff
was a member at the time of the transaction or any part thereof of which
plaintiff complains; and (2) The plaintiff alleges in the complaint with
particularity plaintiff’s efforts to secure from the board such action as
plaintiff desires, or the reasons for not making such effort, and alleges
further that plaintiff has either informed the corporation or the board in
writing of the ultimate facts of each cause of action against each defendant or
delivered to the corporation or the board a true copy of the complaint which
plaintiff proposes to file.” (Corps. Code § 5710(b).) Here, the Complaint does not comply with Corps. Code §
5710(b)(2) because there are no allegations as to seeking the requested relief
from the board or reasons why Plaintiffs did not make such efforts. However,
that section does not apply to Defendant.[4]
Instead, Corporations Code §§ 9140 to 9143 pertaining to nonprofit religious
corporations does.  Accordingly, the court OVERRULES Defendant’s demurrer on
this ground. Standing Defendant failed to include this ground for demurrer in
their notice and demurrer. The court therefore declines to address it.[5]
 Religious Disputes Defendant failed to include this ground for demurrer in
their notice and demurrer. The court therefore declines to address it.[6] Leave to Amend Leave to amend should be liberally granted if there is a
reasonable possibility an amendment could cure the defect. (County of Santa Clara v. Superior Court
(2022) 77 Cal.App.5th 1018, 1035.) The burden is on Plaintiff to establish that
the defect is reasonably capable of cure with leave to amend. (Hendy v. Losse (1991) 54 Cal.3d 723,
742.) Here, Plaintiffs did not request leave to amend. Still, there is
reasonable possibility that an amendment can cure the aforementioned defects. Accordingly, the court GRANTS leave to amend. CONCLUSION:             For
the foregoing reasons, the Court decides the pending motion as follows:  1.      Demurrer
to the Complaint is OVERRULED. Defendants are to ANSWER by December 19, 2024.Moving party is to give notice.  IT IS SO ORDERED.  Dated:              December 5, 2024                   __________________________________                                                                                                                Upinder
