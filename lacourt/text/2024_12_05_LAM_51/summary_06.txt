And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendant's motion for an order requiring an undertaking of $400,000.00 is denied. The defendant argued that the undertaking was necessary to protect its interests in the lawsuit, citing Corporations Code § 5710, which allows a corporation to request an undertaking if there is no reasonable possibility that the prosecution of the cause of action will benefit the corporation or its members. However, the judge found that this section does not apply to the defendant, which is a nonprofit religious corporation. Instead, the judge cited Corporations Code §§ 9140 to 9143, which pertain to nonprofit religious corporations. The judge concluded that the defendant's reliance on § 5710 was misplaced and denied the motion for an undertaking. The judge also denied the defendant's request for judicial notice.
