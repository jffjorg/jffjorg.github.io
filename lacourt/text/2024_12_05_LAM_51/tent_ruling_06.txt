TENTATIVE RULING:

STATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS: 
 
On June 12, 2024, Plaintiffs Rafael Raz, Fariba Ysmini,
Ohisri Yamini, Orit Nazarian, Shlomo Sherf, Javid S. Rad, Mike Noor, and David
Dardashti (Plaintiffs) filed a Verified Complaint against Defendant Beith David
Education Center for an Order Voiding Purported Election of Non0Profit
Corporation and Ordering a New Properly Supervised Election.
 
On June 20, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a Request for Dismissal
as to Plaintiff Javid S. Rad only.
 
On June 21, 2024, Defendant filed a Motion for Order
Requiring Undertaking.
 
On June 21, 2024, Defendant filed a Demurrer.
 
On June 28, 2024 Defendant filed another Demurrer.
 
On June 28, 2024, Defendant filed another Motion for Order
Requiring Undertaking.
 
On August 5, 2024, Plaintiffs filed the instant Motion to
Quash Subpoenas. 
 
On October 9, 2024, Defendant filed supplemental briefs in
support of its Demurrer.[1]
 
On November 20, 2024, Defendant filed an opposition to the
Motion to Quash Subpoenas.
 
On November 21, 2024, Plaintiffs filed Oppositions to the
Demurrer and to the Motion for Undertaking.
 
Replies were due on or before November 26, 2024. As of
December 2, 2024, the court has not received reply briefs.
 
LEGAL STANDARD: 
 
Corporations Code §
5710
 
The corporation may move for an order requiring the
plaintiff to furnish a bond on one of both of the following grounds: “(1) That
there is no reasonable possibility that the prosecution of the cause of action
alleged in the complaint against the moving party will benefit the corporation
or its members, economically or otherwise. (2) That the moving party, if other
than the corporation, did not participate in the transaction complained of in
any capacity.” (Corps. Code § 5710(c).) 
 
Request for
Judicial Notice
 
The court DENIES Defendant’s request for judicial notice.
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
Defendant contends an undertaking of $400,000.00 is required
to protect its interests in this suit since it is meritless. Plaintiffs argue §
5710 does not apply because the instant action seeks a new election and is not
a derivative action.
 
Here, an undertaking under Corporations Code § 5710 is not
warranted. First, that section does not apply to Defendant.[2]
Instead, Corporations Code §§ 9140 to 9143 pertaining to nonprofit religious
corporations does. Again, the court has found that Defendant is a nonprofit
religious corporation. As such, Defendant’s reliance on § 5710 is misplaced.
 
Accordingly, the court DENIES Defendant’s motion for an
order requiring an undertaking.
 
CONCLUSION:
 
            For
the foregoing reasons, the Court decides the pending motion as follows: 
 
1.      Motion
for an Order Requiring an Undertaking is DENIED.
Moving party is to give notice. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
