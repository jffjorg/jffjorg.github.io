Pursuant to Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.113(d), the court disregards argument
exceeding the 15 page memorandum limit on the demurrer. This includes the
purported supplemental briefing provided by Defendant since they did not seek
leave of court to file in excess of the allowable page limit. This also
occurred after repeated warnings by the court of the excessed in filings both
in number and in breadth.

As an aside, the Complaint alleges that the Plaintiffs are members of
Defendant. (Complaint ¶ 3.) The court accepts this as true on demurrer.

Additionally, Defendant misrepresents the extent of Hon. Goorvitch’s prior
ruling that the court cannot intervene in religious matters pursuant to New v. Kroeger (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th
800, 815-816. (Minute Order, April 11, 2024, Case No. 24STCV08540.) At that
hearing, the court indicated it could not provide the relief sought by
Plaintiffs in an ex parte application
because it sought judicial determination of Jewish dietary laws and ordering
Defendant to accept a credentials and/or opinions of various rabbis. (Ibid.)
