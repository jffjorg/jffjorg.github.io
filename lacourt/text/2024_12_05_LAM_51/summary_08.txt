And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving a nonprofit public benefits corporation as the defendant and multiple plaintiffs. The judge disregards the defendant's excess argument and briefing submitted after the 15-page memorandum limit was exceeded. The judge notes that the defendant failed to seek leave of court to file the supplemental briefing and that the court had previously warned the defendant of the excess in filings. The judge also declines to address certain points raised by the defendant because no argument was provided. The judge references a prior ruling by Hon. Goorvitch and notes that the defendant misrepresents the extent of that ruling. The judge accepts the allegation that the plaintiffs are members of the defendant as true for purposes of the demurrer.
