And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the motion to serve Sal's Roofing through publication is denied. The Judge finds that Cross-Complainant has failed to show reasonable diligence in attempting to serve Sal's Roofing, as they have not shown that they have exhausted all service methods other than publication. Additionally, the Judge notes that Cross-Complainant has not shown that they have attempted to serve Sal's Roofing through other means, such as mail or substituted service. The Judge also points out that the Amended Cross-Complaint superseded the original Cross-Complaint, but Cross-Complainant has not filed any papers showing that they attempted to serve Sal's Roofing with the Amended Cross-Complaint.
