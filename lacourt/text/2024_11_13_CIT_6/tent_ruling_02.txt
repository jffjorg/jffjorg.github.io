[1] The Court notes again that Counsel’s supplemental
declaration submitted on a general pleading form still references an outdated
version of the Rules of Professional Conduct. (Vandenberg Supp. Decl., ¶¶ 5-6; Order
re Tentative Ruling (10/2/24); see Rules Prof. Conduct, rule 1.16 [declining or
terminating representation].) An attorney’s duty of competence includes, “the
duty to keep abreast of the changes in the law and its practice.” (Rules Prof.
Conduct, rule 1.1, fn. 1.) The Court admonishes Counsel to learn and reference
the current operative California Rules of Professional Conduct going forward.
