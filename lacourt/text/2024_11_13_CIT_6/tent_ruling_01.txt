BACKGROUND 
This is a personal injury action. On November 28, 2022, plaintiff Quinlan
Jones (Plaintiff) filed this action against defendants Walmart, Inc., John Doe
(collectively, Defendants), and Does and Does 1 to 100, alleging causes of
action for assault, battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress,
negligence, and negligent hiring, supervision, and retention. 
On
October 9, 2024, Alex Vandenberg of Downtown LA Law Group, counsel for Plaintiff,
filed a motion to be relieved as counsel. The motion is unopposed. 
LEGAL
STANDARD
The Court has
discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw, and such a motion should be
granted, provided that there is no prejudice to the client, and it does not
disrupt the orderly process of justice. (See Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915; People v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d
398, 403-407.) 
A motion to be relieved as counsel must be made on Judicial Council
Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion), MC-052 (Declaration), and MC-053
(Proposed Order). (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, subds. (a), (c), (e).) The requisite forms must be served “on the client and on all
parties that have appeared in the case.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1362,
subd. (d).) 
DISCUSSION 
Alex
Vandenberg of Downtown LA Law Group (Counsel) seeks to be relieved as counsel
for Plaintiff. Counsel contends there has been an irremediable breakdown in the
attorney-client relationship. (Vandenberg Decl., ¶ 2.)[1] 
The Court finds this to be sufficient grounds for permitting
withdrawal. A breakdown in the attorney-client relationship is also grounds for
allowing the attorney to withdraw. (Estate of Falco (1987) 188
Cal.App.3d 1004, 1014.) Grounds for permitting an attorney to withdraw from
representation include the client’s conduct that, “renders it unreasonably
difficult for the lawyer to carry out the representation effectively[.]” (Cal.
Rules of Professional Conduct, rule 1.16, subd. (b)(4).) 
Counsel has provided the required Judicial Council
forms, i.e., forms MC-051, MC-052, and MC-053. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362,
subds. (a), (c), and (e).) The Court notes that Counsel again failed to
complete paragraph 3, subdivision (a), of Form MC-052 regarding service of the
motion upon the client. (MC-052, ¶ 3, subd. (a).) But, Counsel also provided
proofs of service of these documents upon Plaintiff and Defendant Walmart, Inc.,
which the Court finds sufficient. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, subd.
(d).) 
Based on the foregoing, the Court GRANTS the motion. 
CONCLUSION 
The Court GRANTS the motion of Alex Vandenberg of Downtown LA Law
Group to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff Quinlan Jones without prejudice.
The Court will sign the proposed order, which Counsel must then serve upon
Plaintiff and provide proof of such service within five calendar days of this
order. 
Counsel is ordered to give notice of this ruling and file proof of
service of same within five calendar days.
