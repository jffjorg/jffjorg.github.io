The Court has granted the motion of Alex Vandenberg of Downtown LA Law Group to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff Quinlan Jones without prejudice. The motion is unopposed and is based on an irremediable breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. The Court finds this to be sufficient grounds for permitting withdrawal. Counsel has provided the required Judicial Council forms and proofs of service, and the Court will sign the proposed order. Counsel must serve the order on the Plaintiff and provide proof of service within five calendar days of this order.
