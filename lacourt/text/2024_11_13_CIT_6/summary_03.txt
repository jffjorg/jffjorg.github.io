And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion to continue the trial date and all related deadlines. The defendants had argued that they needed more time to complete discovery and review the large number of documents produced by the plaintiff. However, the judge found that the defendants had not demonstrated good cause for the continuance and had not shown diligence in their discovery efforts. The judge noted that the case has been pending for almost two years and that the parties had recently stipulated to a continuance. The judge also found that the defendants had not explained why they had not yet deposed the plaintiff's president or the person most knowledgeable about the case, and that it was uncertain whether the physical server hard drive copy received by the defendants on October 11, 2024, was accessible. The judge ordered the plaintiff to give notice of the ruling within five calendar days of the order.
