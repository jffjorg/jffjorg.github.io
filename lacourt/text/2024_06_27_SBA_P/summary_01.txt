And here is the English summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has granted Defendant Malty Automotive, Inc. dba Redondo Mitsubishi's Motion to Compel Arbitration and request for stay. The motion was filed on May 15, 2024, and the court considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers. The court finds that the arbitration agreement between the parties is enforceable and that the dispute should be resolved through arbitration. The court distinguishes the case from McGill v. Citibank, N.A. (2017) 2 Cal.5th 945, which held that an arbitration agreement that prohibited arbitration of claims for public injunctive relief was invalid. The court finds that the arbitration agreement here does not prohibit Plaintiff from seeking injunctive relief in any forum and therefore the holding in McGill is not applicable. As a result, the court has granted the motion to compel arbitration and stayed the proceedings pending the outcome of arbitration. The Hearing Date is set for June 27, 2024.
