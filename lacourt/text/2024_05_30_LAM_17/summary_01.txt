And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The court has granted Michelangelo Tatone's motion to withdraw as counsel for plaintiff Brett Gagnon. The court finds that Tatone has made the request in the proper form and with proper notice. Although the court would normally deny the request due to the risk of prejudice to the client, the court has been informed that the plaintiff has already secured replacement counsel, which mitigates the risk of prejudice. The court has therefore granted the motion and allowed Tatone to withdraw as counsel.
