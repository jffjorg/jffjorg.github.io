The tentative ruling grants the defendant's motion to compel arbitration, staying the proceedings pending the completion of arbitration. The court finds that the preponderance of evidence indicates the existence of an arbitration agreement between the parties. The plaintiff's claims are covered within the scope of the arbitration clause. The court concludes that the defendant has established by a preponderance of the evidence that an arbitration agreement exists, and that the plaintiff's claims are covered by that agreement. The court also finds that the plaintiff has not met its burden to show that the arbitration clause should not be enforced.
