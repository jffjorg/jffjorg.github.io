And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the plaintiff's motion for entry of a stipulated consent judgment is granted. The proposed judgment includes terms for warning requirements and civil penalties. The civil penalty of $5,000 is reasonable based on the criteria set forth in Health & Safety Code § 25249.7, including the nature and extent of the violation, the number and severity of the violations, and the economic effect of the penalty on the violator. The attorney fees of $86,250 are also reasonable, considering the 112.1 hours of attorney work incurred by the plaintiff's counsel. The warnings required under the settlement comply with regulations applicable to warnings under Proposition 65. The judge finds that the settlement is reasonable in all respects and grants the plaintiff's motion.
