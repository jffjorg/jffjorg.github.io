1.    
Motion to Compel- RFP

Having reviewed Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Responses to RFP, the Court
rules as follows.
          On or about November 13,
2023, Plaintiff served RFP on MBUSA. 
(Decl. of Serrano ¶9, Exh. 1.)  MBUSA’s deadline to respond was December 13, 2023.
 On December 22, 2023, Plaintiff’s
counsel served Defendant with a meet and confer letter indicating that their
responses were overdue and that objections were waived pursuant to C.C.P. §2031.300,
wherein Plaintiff further requested a response by Defendant, no later than December
29, 2023.  (See Decl. of Serrano ¶11,
Exh. 2.)  Defendant failed to respond to
Plaintiff or serve any production. 
(Decl. of Serrano ¶13.)  Plaintiff
now moves to compel production.  
          Plaintiff’s motion to
compel RFP is denied because MBUSA’s late filed opposition indicates that
“despite an inadvertent delay, verified responses to written discovery requests
were served on May 22, 2024, rendering this motion moot. Document production
followed shortly thereafter.” 
(Opposition, pgs. 1-2; see Decl. of Dao ¶¶4-5, Exh. A.)
          Therefore, the Court
denies Plaintiff’s motion as moot.
Plaintiff requests monetary sanctions totaling $3,220.00 against MBUSA. 
          In light of the Court’s
ruling on the motion, the Court declines to award sanctions.
Moving Party is to give notice of this ruling.

wherein Plaintiff further requested a response by Defendant, no later than December
29, 2023.  (See Decl. of Serrano
¶11, Exh. 2.)  Defendant failed to
respond to Plaintiff or serve any production. 
(Decl. of Serrano ¶13.)  Plaintiff
now moves to deem admitted the RFA.  
          Plaintiff’s motion to deem
the truth of the matters admitted in the RFA is denied because MBUSA’s late
filed opposition indicates that “despite an inadvertent delay, verified
responses to written discovery requests were served on May 22, 2024, rendering
this motion moot.”  (Opposition, pgs.
1-2; see Decl. of Dao ¶¶4-5, Exh. A.)
          Therefore, the Court
denies Plaintiff’s motion as moot.
Plaintiff requests monetary sanctions totaling $2,904.00 against MBUSA. 
          In light of the Court’s
ruling on the motion, the Court declines to award sanctions.
