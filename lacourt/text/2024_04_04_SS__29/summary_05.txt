And here is a summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for sanctions filed by the plaintiff. The motion was filed on January 31, 2024, and was fully briefed and heard on February 23. The court took the matter under submission, but later vacated the submission and set the matter for further hearing on April 4. On March 27, the defendant served a supplemental declaration, which included a code-compliant response to Form Interrogatory No. 17.1. The court reviewed the supplemental response and determined that the defendant has now served a compliant response. As a result, the court denied the plaintiff's motion for sanctions. The court found that there was no basis for the requested evidence, issue, or terminating sanctions, and that the primary purpose of discovery sanctions is to obtain compliance with the Civil Discovery Act and the court's orders, not to punish.
