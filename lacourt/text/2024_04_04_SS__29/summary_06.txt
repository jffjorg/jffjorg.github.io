The Judge has ruled on the Defendant's motion to compel a second physical examination of the Plaintiff. The Defendant had sought to conduct a second physical examination of the Plaintiff, but the Plaintiff had objected to the examination. The Judge found that the Defendant did not engage in a proper meet and confer as required by the California Code of Civil Procedure, and therefore denied the motion to compel a second physical examination of the Plaintiff, without prejudice. The Judge also denied both parties' requests for sanctions.
