The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for leave to amend the complaint to correct errors regarding the date and location of the slip and fall incident. The plaintiff had previously filed a complaint against MSR Aero Properties, LLC, and later amended it to name Aim Aero Properties, LLC. The plaintiff then filed a request for dismissal of MSR Aero Properties, LLC and a motion for leave to file a first amended complaint. The judge found that the plaintiff had established good cause for the amendment and that all substantive and procedural requirements were satisfied. The judge granted the motion and allowed the plaintiff to file the first amended complaint within 10 days of the hearing.
