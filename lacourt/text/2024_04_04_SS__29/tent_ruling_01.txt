  Case Number:  20STCV38081    Hearing Date:   April 4, 2024    Dept:  29  
Defendant’s Motion to Continue Trial
 
Tentative
The motion is denied.
Background
On
October 5, 2020, Sylvia Topete (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against J.S.
Multani Subway, Inc dba Subway (“Defendant”) and Does 1 through 50 for (1)
battery, (2) intentional infliction of emotional distress, (3) negligence, (4)
negligence, premise liability, and (5) negligent hiring, training,
supervision and retention, arising from an alleged physical altercation that
took place on October 6, 2018 on Defendant’s premises.  Defendant filed its answer on December 2, 2021.
 
Plaintiff
was initially represented by counsel.  On
December 19, 2023, Plaintiff filed a substitution of attorney; Plaintiff is now
representing herself in pro per.  
 
On March 1, 2024, Defendant filed its
motion for summary judgment.
 
On March 12, 2024, Defendant filed
this motion to continue trial. No opposition has been filed.
 
Legal Standard
Code Civ. Proc. § 128(a)(8) provides that the
court has the power to amend and control its process and orders so as to make
them conform to law and justice. “The power to determine when a continuance
should be granted is within the discretion of the trial court.” (Color-Vue,
Inc. v. Abrams (1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 1599, 1603.) “A trial court has wide
latitude in the matter of calendar control including the granting or denying of
continuances.” (Park Motors, Inc. v. Cozens (1975) 49 Cal.App.3d 12, 18.)  
Each request for a continuance must be
considered on its own merits according to California Rules of Court, Rule
3.1332(c). The court may grant a continuance only on an affirmative showing of
good cause requiring the continuance. Circumstances of good cause include:  
“(1) The unavailability of an essential lay
or expert witness because of death, illness, or other excusable
circumstances;  
(2) The unavailability of a party because of
death, illness, or other excusable circumstances;  
(3) The unavailability of trial counsel
because of death, illness, or other excusable circumstances;  
(4) The substitution of trial counsel, but
only where there is an affirmative showing that the substitution is required in
the interests of justice;  
(5) The addition of a new party if: (A) The
new party has not had a reasonable opportunity to conduct discovery and prepare
for trial; or (B) The other parties have not had a reasonable opportunity to
conduct discovery and prepare for trial in regard to the new party's
involvement in the case;  
(6) A party's excused inability to obtain
essential testimony, documents, or other material evidence despite diligent
efforts; or  
(7) A significant, unanticipated change in
the status of the case as a result of which the case is not ready for
trial.”  
(Cal. Rules of
Court, Rule 3.1332(c).)  
 
California Rules
of Court, Rule 3.1332 sets forth a list of non-exhaustive factors to be
analyzed when determining whether good cause for a trial continuance is
present. A court considers factors such as: 

“(1) The proximity of the trial date;  
(2) Whether there was any previous
continuance, extension of time, or delay of trial due to any party;  
(3) The length of the continuance
requested;  
(4) The availability of alternative means to
address the problem that gave rise to the motion or application for a
continuance;  
(5) The prejudice that parties or witnesses
will suffer as a result of the continuance; 
(6) If the case is entitled to a preferential
trial setting, the reasons for that status and whether the need for a
continuance outweighs the need to avoid delay; 
(7) The court's calendar and the impact of
granting a continuance on other pending trials; 
(8) Whether trial counsel is engaged in
another trial;  
(9) Whether all parties have stipulated to a
continuance;  
(10) Whether the interests of justice are
best served by a continuance, by the trial of the matter, or by imposing
conditions on the continuance; and  
(11) Any other fact or circumstance relevant
to the fair determination of the motion or application.”  
(Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1332(d).) 
“A trial court may not refuse to hear a summary judgment
motion filed within the time limits of section 437c.” (Sentry Ins. Co. v.
Superior Court (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 526, 529; accord Cole v. Superior
Court (2022) 87 Cal.App.5th 84, 88.)
Discussion
Defendant contends that good cause exists to continue trial as Defendant
has filed a motion for summary judgment, set to be heard October 17, 2024, after
the current trial date of June 14, 2024. 
A party has a right to have a timely filed and served summary judgment
motion heard before trial.  (Cole
v. Superior Court (2022) 87 Cal.App.5th 84, 88; Sentry Ins. Co. v.
Superior Court (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 526, 529.)
Here, however, it does not appear
that the motion was timely served.  The
motion was served by electronic means on March 1, 2024.  That is not proper service on a pro per
plaintiff.  Although email service may be mandatory for
represented parties, litigants who are in pro per are not subject to mandatory
email service, and Defendant has presented no evidence that Plaintiff has
consented to email service.  (See Code
Civ. Proc., § 1010.6, subd. (c)(2); Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.251(c)(3)(B).)  
Moreover, the trial date is June 14, 2024.  The last day for summary judgment motions to
be heard is on May 15, 2024.  The last
day for timely filing and timely personal service of a summary judgment motion in
this case was on March 1, 2024.  The last
day for timely electronic service of a summary judgment motion in this case was
on February 28, 2024.  Here, the
electronic service of the summary judgment motion occurred on March 1, 2024,
two days late.
Defendant has not shown good cause for a continuance based
on a summary judgment motion that was timely filed but was not timely
served.  There is no right to have an untimely motion for summary judgment heard before trial.Defendant does not contend that
there is any other good cause for the requested continuance.
Accordingly, the motion to continue trial is DENIED.
Conclusion
The Court DENIES
the Motion to Continue Trial. 
Moving Party is
ORDERED to give notice.
