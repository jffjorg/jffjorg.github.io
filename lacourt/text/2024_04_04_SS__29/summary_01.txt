And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to continue the trial scheduled for June 14, 2024. The defendant had requested a continuance due to the pending summary judgment motion, set to be heard on October 17, 2024. However, the court found that the defendant failed to demonstrate good cause for the continuance. The defendant's motion for summary judgment was filed in a timely manner, but not served in a timely manner. The court ruled that a party has a right to have a timely filed and served summary judgment motion heard before trial, but the defendant's failure to properly serve the motion means that the motion will not be heard before trial.
