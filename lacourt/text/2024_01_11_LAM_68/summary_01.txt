Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendant's motion for summary judgment on the plaintiff's negligence cause of action. The plaintiff, Jilla Ghassemzadeh, claims that the defendant, Bruce J. Crispin, D.D.S., was negligent in his dental treatment of her, including the installation of Zirconia in her teeth without her consent, which caused her injuries and damages. The defendant argues that he acted within the standard of care and that there is no triable issue of fact regarding his negligence.

The judge finds that the defendant has presented expert testimony from Dr. Curtis E. Jansen, D.D.S., that he acted within the standard of care during his treatment of the plaintiff. The plaintiff has not presented any contrary expert testimony, and therefore, there is no triable issue of fact regarding the defendant's negligence. The judge also finds that the plaintiff has not presented any evidence that the defendant's negligence was a cause-in-fact of her injuries or damages.

Based on these findings, the judge grants the defendant's motion for summary judgment and dismisses the plaintiff's negligence cause of action.
