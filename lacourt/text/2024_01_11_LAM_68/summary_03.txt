And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the motion to compel arbitration filed by the defendants, Call-the-Car, Kelly Sanchez, Lester Rivera, and Robert Pruitt. The plaintiff, Arianna M. Mejia, alleged several causes of action related to her employment with Call-the-Car, but signed an agreement to arbitrate employment disputes as part of her New Hire Packet. The defendants argue that the arbitration agreement is valid and enforceable, and that the plaintiff's claims are subject to the arbitration agreement. Since no opposition has been filed, the court finds that the defendants have met their initial burden of showing that an arbitration agreement exists with the plaintiff. The court grants the motion to compel arbitration and stays the action pending arbitration.
