            On

            On

Discussion 
 
 On 6/6/2024, Plaintiff propounded Form
Interrogatories (Set One) on Defendant. To date, no responses have been
received. Plaintiff’s counsel also submitted a declaration setting forth
communications with Defendant’s counsel which show that counsel is aware of the
outstanding discovery, and has repeatedly represented that he would provide
responses, only to continually fail to do so. 
 
Defendant
failed to oppose this motion and thus has not set forth any facts which could
justify this failure.
 
Based on the
foregoing, Plaintiff’s motion to compel responses to her Form Interrogatories
(Set One) is granted. Defendant is sanctioned, jointly and severally with
counsel, $1,750.00. ($350/hr x 5 hr.) 
 
 
It is so ordered.
