And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendant's demurrer, which is a challenge to the plaintiff's lawsuit. The plaintiff, Sharon Rachelle Cano, is suing the defendant, Bradley Kramer, Esq., for breach of contract and legal malpractice. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant wrongfully dismissed her mother's action for medical malpractice with prejudice, which has resulted in the loss of her ability to recover from the doctors involved in her mother's death.

The defendant argues that the plaintiff does not have standing to bring the lawsuit because there is no contract between the parties. The court agrees with the defendant and sustains the demurrer without leave to amend. Additionally, the court finds that even if the plaintiff had standing, the lawsuit is untimely because it was filed more than a year after the plaintiff learned of the allegedly wrongful act or omission.
