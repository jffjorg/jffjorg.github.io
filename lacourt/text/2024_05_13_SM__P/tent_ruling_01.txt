AMC Fund 24 LLC v. Quantinal Capital Advisors, et al., Case
No. 24SMCV00136
Hearing date: May 13, 2024
Defendant Quantinal’s Motion to Compel Arbitration
 
In this declaratory relief action, plaintiff alleges it
signed 23 purchase agreements with defendant Quantinal to buy its membership
interest in 23 different limited liability companies. The identical agreements
did not include wire instructions for payment. Defendant Quantinal moves to
compel arbitration pursuant to the agreements.
 
California public policy strongly favors arbitration as an
efficient alternative to litigation. Code Civ. Proc. §1280, et seq., Madden
v. Kaiser Found. Hosps. (1976) 17 Cal.3d 699, 706.
There is a liberal federal policy favoring arbitration,
requiring arbitration agreements to be on equal footing with other contracts
and requiring courts to resolve doubts as to whether a dispute falls within an
arbitration provision in favor of arbitration. AT&T Mobility, LLC v.
Concepcion (2011) 563 U.S. 333, 339; AT&T Tech., Inc. v. Comm.
Workers of Am. (1986) 475 U.S. 643, 650. A similar policy has been
expressed by California courts. Hayes Children Leasing Co. v. NCR Corp. (1995)
37 Cal.App.4th 775, 788. The public policy in favor
of arbitration is founded in the notion that arbitration is a “speedy and
relatively inexpensive means of dispute resolution.” Adolph v. Coastal Auto
Sales, Inc. (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 1443, 1452.
 
Quantinal provides a copy of the parties’ agreement to
arbitrate. Kaminker Decl., Exh. A.  Paragraph
7(d) contains a dispute resolution provision that incorporates a reference to the
company agreement. Id. ¶ 5. Paragraph 11.12 of the company agreement states
“Any dispute among the Company, the Manager or the Members or any one of them
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the rights and obligations of
any party pertaining to the investment in the Units and any transaction among
one or more of the Company, the Manager or the Members shall be resolved
through binding arbitration as set forth in this Section.” Id. ¶ 6; Exh.
A. 
 
Plaintiff argues the agreements and arbitration provisions
are invalid and not enforceable because the interests in the subject entities
were never validly transferred, as the purchase agreements did not provide wire
transfer information. Hopper Decl., ¶ 25. Plaintiff also argues Quantinal
failed to provide arbitration provisions from each of the 23 incomplete purchase
agreement; plaintiff argues each agreement concerns a different property, so each
agreement is unique. This is not persuasive, as each agreement appears
identical but for the company name and contains identical dispute resolution
provisions. Kaminker Decl. ¶ 6.
 
Plaintiff cites Avalon Products v. Lentini (1950) 98
Cal.App.2d 177, 179, which held a contract is void if essential elements are
not agreed upon and the contract does not provide an answer, leaving it open to
future negotiation and agreement. The Avalon parties’ agreement failed
to make any provisions for how payment would be made. Id. Here, wire
instructions were not an essential element of the agreements because plaintiff
indicated payment would be made by checks and wire transfer was unnecessary. Kaminker
Dec. ¶ 9.c.; Exh. L. 
 
All claims fall within the scope of the arbitration
agreements because the claims for declaratory relief, breach of contractual
representation warranting rescission and fraud all stem from the interest
agreements. Quantinal meets its burden under Code of Civil Procedure §1281.2. 
 
Plaintiff fails to assert any other defense that would bar enforcement
of the arbitration agreement. Moreover, the court declines to adjudicate the
declaratory relief claim, as the prayer challenges the validity of the contract
as a whole. Compl. ¶¶ 101-102. All such challenges can be addressed through
arbitration, especially considering that the agreement states that “any
disputes arising out of the Agreements” would be resolved there. Hayes,
supra, 37 Cal.App.4th at 781. 
 
Since an agreement to arbitrate exists and there are no
defenses to enforcement, the motion is GRANTED.
