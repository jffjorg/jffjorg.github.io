And here is the summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the defendant's motion to compel arbitration in this declaratory relief action. The plaintiff, AMC Fund 24 LLC, signed 23 purchase agreements with the defendant, Quantinal Capital Advisors, to buy membership interests in 23 different limited liability companies. The agreements did not include wire transfer information. The defendant moves to compel arbitration pursuant to the agreements. The judge finds that the agreements are valid and enforceable, and that the claims for declaratory relief, breach of contractual representation warranting rescission, and fraud all fall within the scope of the arbitration agreements. The judge declines to adjudicate the declaratory relief claim, as the prayer challenges the validity of the contract as a whole, and instead directs the parties to arbitration to resolve all disputes.
