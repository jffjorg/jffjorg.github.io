Naldjian, as well as the depositions of the persons most knowledgeable for Dao House and WDA. The plaintiff also sought sanctions against each deponent in the amount of $3,067.26. The judge found that the plaintiff failed to file deposition notices and attach them to their moving papers, despite a previous continuance of the hearing. As a result, the motions are denied without prejudice.
