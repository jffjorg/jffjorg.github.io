I.           
INTRODUCTION
On July 10, 2024, plaintiff Alejandro
Guzman (“Plaintiff”) filed this employment law action against Nabi Merchant
(“Merchant”) for wrongful termination and various violations of the Labor Code.
On October 17, 2024, Plaintiff filed the operative First Amended Complaint
(“FAC”). Plaintiff alleges Merchant did business as Subway aka Subway 2132
(FAC, ¶ 3) at Subway Store number 2132 in Studio City, California. Plaintiff
also alleges that his manager/supervisor was Merchant’s wife, Noori Merchant.
(FAC, ¶ 14.)  
On November 20, 2024, Merchant filed
this motion to strike Plaintiff’s punitive damages allegations.
On January 2, 2025, Plaintiff filed an
opposition brief. 
No reply brief has been filed. 
II.         
LEGAL
STANDARD
Any party, within the time allowed to
respond to a pleading may serve and file a notice of motion to strike the whole
or any part thereof. (Code Civ. Proc., § 435 subd., (b)(1).) The court may,
upon a motion, or at any time in its discretion, and upon terms it deems
proper, strike any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any
pleading. (Code Civ. Proc, § 436, subd. (a); Stafford v. Shultz (1954)
42 Cal.2d 767, 782 [“Matter in a pleading which is not essential to the claim
is surplusage; probative facts are surplusage and may be stricken out or
disregarded”].) An immaterial or irrelevant allegation is one that is not
essential to the statement of a claim or defense; is neither pertinent to nor
supported by an otherwise sufficient claim or defense; or a demand for judgment
requesting relief not supported by the allegations of the complaint. (Code Civ
Proc, § 431.10, subd. (b).) The grounds for moving to strike must appear on the
face of the pleading or by way of judicial notice. (Code Civ. Proc., § 437.)
III.       
DISCUSSION
Punitive damages may be imposed where
it is proven by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant has been
guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice. (Civ. Code, § 3294, subd. (a).) A
motion to strike punitive damages is properly granted where a plaintiff does
not state a prima facie claim for punitive damages, including allegations that defendant
is guilty of oppression, fraud or malice. (Turman
v. Turning Point of Cent. California, Inc. (2010) 191 Cal.App.4th 53, 63.) “Mere negligence, even gross
negligence, is not sufficient to justify such an award” for punitive damages. (Kendall Yacht Corp. v. United California
Bank (1975) 50 Cal. App. 3d 949, 958.) The allegations supporting a request
for punitive damages must be alleged with specificity; conclusory allegations
without sufficient facts are not enough. (Smith
v. Superior Court (1992) 10
Cal.App.4th 1033, 1041-1042.)
“Malice” is conduct intended by the
defendant to cause injury to the plaintiff or despicable conduct which is
carried on with a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of
others. (Civ. Code, § 3294, subd. (c)(1).) “As amended to include [despicable],
the [Civil Code section 3294] plainly indicates that absent an intent to injure
the plaintiff, ‘malice’ requires more than a ‘willful and conscious’ disregard
of the plaintiffs’ interests. The additional component of ‘despicable conduct’
must be found.” (College Hospital Inc. v.
Superior Court (1994) 8
Cal.4th 704, 725.) Despicable conduct is “conduct which is so vile, base,
contemptible, miserable, wretched or loathsome that it would be looked down
upon and despised by ordinary decent people. Such conduct has been described as
‘having the character of outrage frequently associated with crime.’” (Tomaselli v. Transamerica Ins. Co.
(1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 1269, 1287.) Further, “[t]here must be evidence that
defendant acted with knowledge of the probable dangerous consequences to
plaintiff’s interests and deliberately failed to avoid these consequences.” (Flyer’s Body Shop Profit Sharing Plan v.
Ticor Title Ins. Co. (1986)
185 Cal.App.3d 1149, 1155; see also Angie
M. v. Superior Court (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1217, 1228 [“Conscious disregard
for the safety of another may be sufficient where the defendant is aware of the
probably dangerous consequences of his or her conduct and he or she willfully
fails to avoid such consequences”].) 
Merchant argues that Plaintiff fails to
allege facts sufficient to state a claim for punitive damages because an
employer, at its discretion, may allow customers to leave tips, allow “tip
pooling”, and direct its employees schedules. (Motion, pp. 6-7.) Merchant
argues that the mere fact that Plaintiff was terminated does not give right to
punitive damages. (Motion, p. 7.)
In opposition, Plaintiff argues that
there are sufficient allegations of malice, oppression, and fraud against
Merchant because he alleges that his manager/supervisor retaliated against him
for participating in a worker’s compensation investigation and for complaining
about withheld tips. (FAC, ¶¶ 13-14, 20, 24, 26-27.) This retaliation included:
(1) altering Plaintiff’s work schedule by first reducing his hours and then
placing him on a night shift while knowing that Plaintiff relied on public
transportation and would face commuting challenges since his bus did not
operate after the store’s closing hours and (2) wrongfully terminating him
after 9 years of “exemplary service.” (FAC, ¶¶ 17, 19, 28, 30-31.) Plaintiff
also alleges such retaliation was ratified by Merchant. (FAC, ¶ 44, 59; Civ.
Code, § 3294, subd. (b).) These allegations are sufficient to plead a punitive
damages claim against his employer, Merchant, because if they are proven to be
true, Plaintiff will have demonstrated that his manager/supervisor engaged in
intentionally malicious conduct and that Merchant ratified such conduct. In
light of the foregoing, the motion to strike is DENIED. 
IV.       
CONCLUSION
Defendant’s motion to strike is DENIED.

Moving party to give notice.
