And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion by Nabi Merchant, the defendant, to strike punitive damages allegations made by Alejandro Guzman, the plaintiff. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant is guilty of malice, oppression, and fraud, and seeks punitive damages as a result. The judge agrees with the plaintiff that the allegations are sufficient to plead a punitive damages claim, and denies the defendant's motion to strike. The judge finds that the plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts to support a claim of malice, oppression, and fraud, including allegations of retaliation against the plaintiff for participating in a worker's compensation investigation and complaining about withheld tips. The judge concludes that the defendant's actions were intentionally malicious and that the defendant ratified such conduct.
