Plaintiff SSR Paseo Colorado LLC
(“Plaintiff”) seeks a default judgment against defendant Frances Huang
(“Defendant”) in this unlawful detainer action. In a supporting declaration filed
September 10, 2024, Plaintiff’s representative, Carole Greene, declares that
Plaintiff owes $31,464 in past due rent, $22,482 in holdover damages, $1,000 in
attorney fees, and $765 in costs, for a total judgment of $55,711. However, the
proposed judgment filed on September 10, 2024, lists different figures and requests
$68,195.40 in holdover damages and $4,256.37 in attorney fees; these amounts
were previously deemed excessive in a minute order issued on August 23, 2024. 
Accordingly, the default prove-up
hearing is CONTINUED to ______________________ at 8:30 a.m. in Department 3 of
the Alhambra Courthouse. Plaintiff should submit a revised proposed judgment no
later than 5 court days before the hearing.
