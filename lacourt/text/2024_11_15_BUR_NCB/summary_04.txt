And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the petition for a minor's compromise and finds the settlement agreement to be fair and reasonable. The parties have an agreement for attorney's fees, which is attached to the petition, and the declaration of counsel is sufficient to substantiate the work done in connection with the matter. The petition is properly verified by the petitioner. Therefore, the court is inclined to grant the petition. The court notes that the claimant did not suffer an injury or treatment, and the settlement is purely financial in nature, so attendance at the hearing is not required to grant the petition.
