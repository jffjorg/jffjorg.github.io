TENTATIVE RULING:  
 
GRANTED – 
The Court has reviewed the petition and finds the settlement fair and
reasonable. The parties have an agreement for attorney’s fees, which is
attached to the petition, the Declaration of Counsel is sufficient to
substantiate the work done in connection with this matter, and the petition is
properly verified by Petitioner.  The
Court is therefore inclined to grant the petition. 
 
Per CRC Rule 7.952, Petitioner and the Claimant are required to attend
the hearing on the petition.  In view of
the fact that the Claimant did not suffer injury or otherwise treat, the
settlement is purely financial in nature and therefore, the Court will not require
attendance at the hearing in order to grant the petition.
