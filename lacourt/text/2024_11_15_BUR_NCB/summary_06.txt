And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's unopposed motions to compel discovery responses from the defendant. The plaintiff had filed three motions to compel initial responses to discovery requests, including interrogatories and requests for production of documents, which were served on the defendant in March 2024. Despite granting extensions, the defendant failed to provide responses, prompting the plaintiff to send correspondence requesting discovery responses. The judge has ordered the defendant to provide verified responses to the discovery requests without objections within 20 days of notice of this order.

The plaintiff also requested sanctions against the defendant and its attorney in the amount of $1,260 per motion, totaling $3,780. However, the judge has granted sanctions in the reasonable amount of $1,200 total for these relatively simple and identical motions, plus $180 in filing fees, totaling $1,380. The defendant and its counsel are ordered to pay monetary sanctions in this amount to the plaintiff within 20 days of notice of this order.
