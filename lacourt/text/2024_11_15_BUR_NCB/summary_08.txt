Here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling grants the Plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal without prejudice. The Plaintiff, Jing Guang Wu, alleges that he was attacked by Defendant Jesus L. Duran's dog on March 26, 2022, and suffered injuries. The Plaintiff's complaint was filed on March 22, 2024, but was dismissed without prejudice on September 23, 2024, due to the Plaintiff's failure to appear at a hearing. The Plaintiff's attorney, James J. Vititoe, has filed a declaration stating that he failed to properly serve the summons and complaint and missed a calendaring deadline. The Court finds that the Plaintiff's motion has substantive merit under the mandatory prong of CCP § 473(b) and grants the motion. The Court also sets a Case Management Conference for May 15, 2025.
