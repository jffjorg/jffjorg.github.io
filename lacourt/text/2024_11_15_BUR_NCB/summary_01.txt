And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to be relieved as counsel filed by Na’il Benjamin, who represents Selling N. Atlanta LLC. The motion was filed on October 15, 2024, and Counsel has not filed a proposed order (MC-053) form. The defendant filed a Notice of Bankruptcy (Chapter 7) on November 7, 2024, which has triggered a bankruptcy stay. Counsel seeks to withdraw due to an irreparable breakdown in the attorney-client relationship and a conflict of interest. The Court is inclined to grant the motion provided that Counsel can show that it may proceed with the motion while the bankruptcy stay is in place. The Court will set an Order to Show Cause re Status of Representation of Defendant Selling N. Atlanta LLC for March 14, 2025, at 8:30 a.m. to ensure that the defendant obtains new counsel.
