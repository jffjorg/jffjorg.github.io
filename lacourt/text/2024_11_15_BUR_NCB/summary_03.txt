And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on Plaintiff Suzanne Bank's motion for trial preference under CCP § 36. The motion is based on Plaintiff's age (84) and health conditions, including recent diagnoses of lung cancer and potential traumatic brain injury (TBI). The judge finds that Plaintiff has a substantial interest in the action as she claims she was injured by the subject incident that occurred at Whole Foods' store on October 22, 2020. However, the judge is concerned about the objective assessment of Plaintiff's condition and notes that some of the statements regarding her condition are at odds with statements made at her deposition in August 2024. The judge also finds that the constitutional due process rights of Defendants must be considered. The motion is continued to December 20, 2024, at 8:30 a.m., pending further information about Plaintiff's condition and completion of her deposition and independent medical examination (IME).
