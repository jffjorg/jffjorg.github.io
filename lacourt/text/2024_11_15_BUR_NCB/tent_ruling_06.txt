 [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
motions to compel discovery responses; requests for sanctions
 



 
On October 7,
2024, Plaintiff Chen Avneri (“Plaintiff”) filed 3 motions to compel initial responses
from Defendant Five Star Limousine of LA, LLC (“Defendant”) for: (1) Form
Interrogatories (“FROG”), set one; (2) Special Interrogatories (“SROG”), set
one; and (3) Request for Production of Documents (“RPD”), set one.  
On March 8, 2024,
Plaintiff served on Defendant the discovery requests.  Plaintiff granted several extensions such that
responses were due by May 22, 2024. 
Plaintiff states that Defendant did not provide responses, such that
Plaintiff’s counsel sent correspondence to request that Defendant provide
discovery responses.  Plaintiff states
that in September 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel spoke with defense counsel’s
paralegal, David Rosenblum, about the discovery responses, and provided more
extensions for the discovery.  Despite
providing time for Defendant to respond to the discovery, Plaintiff states that
as of the filing of the motions, Plaintiff has not received responses from Defendant.  
Plaintiff’s unopposed
motions to compel responses to the FROG, SROG, and RPD are granted pursuant to
CCP §§ 2030.290 and 2031.300.  Defendant
is ordered to provide verified responses to Plaintiff’s discovery
requests, without
objections, within 20 days of notice of this order.    
Plaintiff requests
sanctions against Defendant and its attorney in the amount of $1,260 for each
motion (= 1.5 hours to prepare the motion + 1.5 anticipated hours to review the
opposition, prepare the reply, and attend the hearing at $400/hour, plus $60 in
filing fees).  The requests are granted
but in the reasonable amount of $1,200 total for these relatively simple and
identical motions, plus $180 in filing fees. 
Defendant and
its counsel of record, jointly and severally, are
ordered to pay monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,280 to Plaintiff, by
and through counsel, within 20 days of notice of this order. 
Plaintiff shall provide
notice of this order.
