ANALYSIS:
 
I.                   
Background

 
On June 18, 2024, Plaintiff AC
Hospitality Consulting LLC (“Plaintiff”) initiated this action against Defendants
Town Hall Eatery LLC (“Town Hall Eatery”), Town Hall, and Shaya Stauber
(“Stauber”) (collectively, “Defendants”) and Does 1-20 alleging causes of
action for Breach of Contract and Common Counts. (Compl., ¶ 8.) This action arises out of a written
agreement between the parties – namely the “Consulting Agreement” – and
Plaintiff alleges that “Defendants failed to pay Plaintiff fees for services
under the agreement.” (Compl., ¶¶ BC-1, BC-2, Attach.) In the Complaint,
Plaintiff also stated that “Plaintiff waives damages in excess of $35,000.”
(Compl., ¶¶ 10(d), BC-4.)
 
On September 25, 2024, Town Hall
Eatery and Stauber filed an Answer, and Town Hall Eatery filed a Cross-Complaint
against Plaintiff, Alissa Conte (“Conte”), and Roes 1-20.
 
On November 6, 2024, Conte filed an
Answer to the Cross-Complaint, and Plaintiff filed an Answer to the
Cross-Complaint.
 
On November 12, 2024, Plaintiff filed
the instant Motion for Leave to File First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) (the
“Motion”). 
 
On January 7, 2025, Town Hall Eatery
and Stauber filed an Opposition.
 
On January 13, 2025, Plaintiff filed a
Reply.
 
II.                
Procedural
Issues
 
Plaintiff files proof of service of
the Motion and accompanying papers on Town Hall Eatery and Stauber; however,
Plaintiff fails to file proof of service on Town Hall.
 
            However,
given that Town Hall has not appeared in the action, the Court exercises its
discretion to address the Motion on the merits.
 
III.             
Legal
Standard
 
            Leave
to amend is permitted under Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision
(a), which states: “The court may, in furtherance of justice, and on any terms
as may be proper, allow a party to amend any pleading or proceeding by adding
or striking out the name of any party, or by correcting a mistake in the name
of a party, or a mistake in any other respect; and may, upon like terms,
enlarge the time for answer or demurrer. The court may likewise, in its
discretion, after notice to the adverse party, allow, upon any terms as may be
just, an amendment to any pleading or proceeding in other particulars; and may
upon like terms allow an answer to be made after the time limited by this
code.”
 
“Although courts are bound
to apply a policy of great liberality in permitting amendments to the complaint
at any stage of the proceedings, up to and including trial [citations], this
policy should be applied only ‘where no prejudice is shown to the adverse party
. . .. [citation].  A different result is
indicated ‘where inexcusable delay and probable prejudice to the opposing
party’ is shown. [Citation].” (Magpali v.
Farmers Group (1996) 48
Cal.App.4th 471, 487.) 
 
            A
motion for leave to amend a pleading must also comply with the procedural
requirements of California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1324, which requires that a motion to amend
must:  “[i]nclude a copy of the proposed…
amended pleading… [and] state what allegations in the previous pleading are
proposed to be [deleted and/or added], if any, and where, by page, paragraph,
and line number, the [deleted and/or additional] allegations are located.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1321(a).) 
 
A motion for leave to
amend a pleading must also include “[a] separate declaration must accompany the
motion and must specify: (1) The effect of the amendment; (2) Why the amendment
is necessary and proper; (3) When the facts giving rise to the amended allegations
were discovered; and (4) The reasons why the request for amendment was not made
earlier.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1321(b).)
 
IV.             
Discussion

 
Plaintiff seeks leave of court to file a FAC that would assert
additional causes of action – namely, promissory estoppel, negligent
misrepresentation, and specific performance – and increase the damages sought
from $35,000 to at least $72,000. (Jensen Decl., ¶ 13.)
 
In Opposition, Town Hall Eatery and Stauber contend the Motion should be
denied because “(1) [the] amendments are futile, as the newly asserted claims
fail to state valid causes of action under California law, (2) Plaintiff has
unreasonably delayed seeking leave to amend despite having knowledge of the
proposed claims and facts for nearly a year, and; (3) The proposed amendments
would cause substantial prejudice to Defendants by expanding the scope of
discovery and altering the trajectory of the litigation.” (Opp., p. 2.) Specifically,
Town Hall Eatery and Stauber challenge the sufficiency of each cause of action alleged
in the proposed FAC; argue the FAC brings a new set of allegations entirely
unrelated to the original claims, as evidenced by the new request for damages
that nearly doubles the damages originally claimed; and state the amendments
would significantly increase the burden of litigation. (Opp., pp. 3-9.)
Further, Town Hall Eatery and Stauber highlight the first round of discovery
has already been completed and argue Plaintiff inexcusably delayed in seeking
leave to amend because Plaintiff has known the facts underlying the proposed
amendments since at least December 2023. (Opp., p. 9.) 
 
In Reply, Plaintiff refutes Town Hall Eatery and Stauber’s arguments in
their entirety, stating their challenges to the cause of action are improperly
raised in an opposition to a motion for leave to amend (Reply, pp. 3-4); case
law promotes liberality in granting leave to amend and Town Hall Eatery and
Stauber fail to raise any legal authority stating otherwise (Reply, pp. 4-5);
and Town Hall Eatery and Stauber are not prejudiced by this proposed FAC and
fail to state a non-conclusory argument that shows otherwise. (Reply, pp. 5-6.)
As to any alleged delay in failing to bring the Motion, Plaintiff disputes this
allegation and states: “Defendants are the sole cause of any delay. Plaintiff
attempted to seek consent to filing its FAC months ago; those requests were
ignored by Defendants’ predecessor counsel and then by its current counsel.
(See Decl. of Michael Jensen ISO Mot. at ¶¶ 3-12.) Defendants’ claim that
Plaintiff delayed [is] dubious and undermined by their own conduct.” (Reply, p.
6.)
 
Here, the Court finds Plaintiff’s Motion substantially complies with
California Rules of Court, rule 3.1324(a). The Motion includes a copy of the
proposed FAC and sets forth the allegations to be added and/or deleted. (Jensen
Decl., pp. 1, 3, Exh. A.) While the allegations to be added/deleted do not
include page, paragraph, or line number demarcations, the Court finds this
reasonable given that Plaintiff is changing the form of the Complaint from a
Judicial Council form complaint to a complaint on pleading paper. (Compl.; Jensen
Decl., ¶ 13.) However, the Court notes Plaintiff fails to set forth in the
Motion that the FAC does not include a Common Counts claim, which was alleged in
the original Complaint.
 
Additionally, the Motion includes a separate declaration from attorney Michael
J. Jensen as is required California Rules of Court, rule 3.1321(b). Jensen’s
declaration states: (1) the effect of the amendment; (2) the reasons why the amendment
is necessary and proper – namely, the amendments do not fundamentally alter the
nature of the case or involve new areas of factual inquiry not implicated by
prior pleadings, trial does not take place until December 2025, there is no
prejudice to Defendants, and allowing Plaintiff to raise all claims against
Defendants furthers justice; (3) the facts giving rise to the amendments were
discovered while Plaintiff conducted further investigation of Plaintiff’s
claims and the recently filed Cross-Complaint in September 2024 (the Court
notes that the Motion was filed six days after Plaintiff filed an Answer to the
Cross-Complaint); and (4) “[t]his amendment is being sought at the
earliest stage of litigation. The reason this request for amendment was not
made earlier is because counsel for Defendants has not responded to any of
[Plaintiff’s counsel’s] attempts to resolve this via stipulation. Further, due
to the aggressive nature of the Cross-Complaint, Plaintiff must now respond
accordingly by asserting all available claims.” (Jensen Decl., pp. 3-4, ¶¶ 3-16.) 
 
Accordingly, the Court finds Plaintiff has fully complied with the
requirements set forth in California Rules of Court, rule 3.1324(b). 
 
The Court also addresses the contentions raised in the Opposition. As to
Town Hall Eatery and Stauber’s challenges to the sufficiency of each of
Plaintiff’s proposed new causes of action, the Court agrees with Plaintiff that
an opposition to a motion for leave to file a FAC is not the proper procedural
mechanism to address such claims. As to Town Hall Eatery and Stauber’s claims
of prejudice and that Plaintiff inexcusably delayed in filing the Motion, the
Court notes this Motion was filed less than two months after Town Hall Eatery
and Stauber appeared in the action, and Town Hall Eatery and Stauber did not
address or dispute that Plaintiff’s counsel attempted to professionally resolve
the FAC and issues raised therein by way of stipulation and/or mediation prior
to this Motion.
 
For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff’s Motion is GRANTED.

Plaintiff AC Hospitality Consulting LLC’s Motion for Leave to File First
Amended Complaint is GRANTED.

this Court’s order.
