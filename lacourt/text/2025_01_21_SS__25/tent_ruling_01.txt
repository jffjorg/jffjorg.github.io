(Compl., ¶  10.)    On June 28,  2024, Counsel for Plaintiff, Barry Carl Eisenberg (“Counsel”) of the Eisenberg  Law Group filed a Motion to be Relieved as Counsel.   On August 1,  2024, the Court found several deficiencies with Counsel’s Motion to be Relieved  as Counsel – namely, the Motion lacked a MC-052 Form (Declaration of Counsel),  MC-053 Form (Proposed Order), and Proof of Service of the Motion. (8/1/24  Order.) The Court denied the motion without prejudice. (8/1/24 Order.)   On August 8,  2024, Counsel filed the instant Motion to be Relieved as Counsel (the  “Motion”).     On September 24,  2024, the Court did not call a hearing and determined Counsel’s proposed Order  (MC-053 Form) granting the Motion to be deficient because the Order was blank.  The Court, on its own motion, continued the Hearing on the Motion to allow Counsel  to serve and submit a perfected proposed Order. (9/24/24 Order.)   On September 30,  2024, Counsel filed a new proposed Order (MC-053 Form).   On October 29,  2024, the hearing on the Motion was continued due to the Court’s  unavailability. (10/29/24 Order.)   On December 11,  2024, the Court continued the hearing on the Motion from December 11, 2024, to  January 21, 2025, due to various deficiencies in the Motion. (12/11/24 Order.) The  Court ordered that Counsel must filed and serve supplemental papers correcting  the errors noted therein at least 16 court days before the next scheduled  hearing. (12/11/24 Order.) Additionally, the Court scheduled an OSC Re: Status  as to Proof of Service for January 21, 2025, and advanced and continued the  Non-Jury Trial, on the Court’s own motion, from February 24, 2025, to April 10,  2025. (12/11/24 Order.)   On December 18,  2024, Counsel filed Notice of Ruling.   Also on December  18, 2024, Counsel filed a new Notice of Motion and Motion (MC-051 form) and  Declaration (MC-052 form).    To date, no  Opposition to the Motion has been filed.   II.                  Legal  Standard               Code  of Civil Procedure section 284 states that “the attorney in an action…may be  changed at any time before or after judgment or final determination, as follows:  (1) Upon the consent of both client and attorney…; (2) Upon the order of the  court, upon the application of either client or attorney, after notice from one  to the other.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 284;  Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362.) “The determination whether to grant or deny  a motion to withdraw as counsel lies within the sound discretion of the trial  court.” (Manfredi & Levine v. Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th  1128, 1133); see Lempert v. Superior Court (2003) 112 Cal.App.4th  1161, 1173.)    An application  to be relieved as counsel must be made on Judicial Counsel Forms MC-051 (Notice  of Motion and Motion), MC-052 (Declaration), and MC-053 (Proposed Order). (Cal.  Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, subds. (a), (c), (e).)    In addition,  California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362 subsection (d) requires that the notice  of motion and motion, declaration, and proposed order be served on the client  and all other parties who have appeared in the case by personal service,  electronic service, or mail. If the notice is served by electronic service, it  must be accompanied by a declaration stating that the electronic service  address is the client’s current electronic service address. (Cal. Rules of  Court, rule 3.1362, subd. (d)(2).) As used in this rule, “current” means:    “[T]he address  was confirmed within 30 days before the filing of the motion to be relieved.  Merely  demonstrating that the notice was sent to the client’s last known address and  was not returned or no electronic delivery failure message was received is not,  by itself, sufficient to demonstrate that the address is current.”    (Cal. Rules of Court, rule  3.1362, subd. (d).)    III.               Discussion   On August 8,  2024, Counsel moved the Court to  relieve him as attorney of record for Plaintiff. (MC-051.) Counsel filed MC-051, MC-052, and MC-053  Forms. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, subds. (a), (c), (e).) Counsel  seeks to be relieved due to a  breakdown of the attorney-client relationship (MC-052, ¶ 2.) The Court is  satisfied with Counsel’s reasons for seeking to be relieved.    While Counsel rectified most of the past  deficiencies, the Proposed Order (MC-053 Form) still fails to list the proper  next hearing date (MC-053, ¶ 7) and now also fails to include the newly updated  OSC Re: Failure to File Proof of Service and Non-Jury Trial dates. (MC-053, ¶¶  8-9.)   Although the Court is satisfied with  Counsel’s reasons for seeking to be relieved, the Court cannot grant the Motion  without adequate forms. The Court will GRANT the Motion conditional upon  receipt of proper MC-53 form before the hearing date by hearing on Tuesday  January 21, 2025 at 10:00 a.m. By next scheduled hearing, Counsel must file and  serve a new MC-053 form. Failure to do so will result in the Motion being  placed off calendar or denied.     IV.               Conclusion & Order   Although  the Court is satisfied with Counsel’s reasons for seeking to be relieved, the  Court cannot grant the Motion without adequate forms. The Court will GRANT the  Motion conditional upon receipt of proper MC-053 form before the hearing date on  Tuesday January 21, 2025 at 10:00 a.m. Failure to do so will result in the  Motion being placed off calendar or denied.      Proposed Order having been received;  the Motion is granted.   The Court's Ruling and Attorney's relief as Counsel of  record for client is not effective until Proof of Service of the Order signed  by the Court upon the client is filed in this action.  Until then, counsel continues to be counsel  of record.  Cal. Rules of Court  3.1362(e).    Moving party is ordered to give notice.
