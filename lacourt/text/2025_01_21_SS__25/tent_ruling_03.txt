ANALYSIS:
 
I.                   
Background

 
On November 13, 2024, Plaintiff Zian
Zheng (“Plaintiff”), proceeding pro se, initiated this action against Defendant
Nestor Payumo Simon (“Defendant”) and Does 1-50 alleging Motor Vehicle and
General Negligence causes of action. (Compl., pp. 1, 4, 5.) The action arises
from a motor vehicle accident that occurred on November 30, 2022. (Compl., pp. 4,
5.) Plaintiff alleges property damage as a result of the accident and
Defendant’s conduct. (Compl., ¶ 11.)
 
On December 18, 2024, Defendant filed
a Demurrer to the Complaint (the “Demurrer”) and a Request for Judicial Notice.
 
To date, no Opposition has been filed.

 
II.                
Procedural
Issues
 
Defendant filed and served the Demurrer by email and electronic service
only. Self-represented litigants cannot be served electronically unless they
consent to receive electronic service. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.251; Code
Civ. Proc., § 1010.6, subd. (c).) Here, Plaintiff is self-represented, and there
is nothing in the Court’s record indicating Plaintiff manifested consent to
receive electronic service. 
While Defendant states the parties stipulated/consented to electronic
service in the proofs of service for the Demurrer, Grover Declaration, and
Request for Judicial Notice (Demurrer, Proof of Service; Grover Decl. Proof of
Service, Judicial Notice Request, Proof of Service), this is not sufficient
proof of Plaintiff’s stipulation and/or consent.
            Thus,
Defendant’s proof of service of the Demurrer is defective. 

            Further, Defendant failed to
file proof of the Notice of Hearing on Plaintiff.
 
III.

scheduled hearing, Defendant must file and serve new proof of service of the
