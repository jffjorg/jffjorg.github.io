Defendants/Cross-Complainants Salvador Carrillo and
Veronica Cordova’s Motion to Amend Cross-Complaint is DENIED without prejudice.
BACKGROUND
On June 29, 2023, Plaintiffs
Samuel Mariz, Rosa Lopez, Nicolas Mariz, Samuel Mariz Jr., and Alma Lopez
(collectively, Mariz-Lopez Plaintiffs) filed a complaint against Defendants
Salvador Carrillo, Veronica Cordova, and Does 1-100, alleging the following
causes of action: (1) violation of Civil Code section 1942.4, (2) tortious
breach of the warranty of habitability, (3) private nuisance, (4) violation of
Business and Professions Code section 17200 et seq., (5) negligence, (6) breach
of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, (7) intentional infliction of emotional
distress, (8) negligence per se, (9) violation of the Civil Code section 1750
et seq., (10) violation of Civil Code section 1947.12, and (11) intentional
influence to vacate.
On February 21, 2024,
Carrillo and Cordova filed a cross-complaint against the Mariz-Lopez Plaintiffs
alleging the following causes of action: (1) indemnification, (2) apportionment
of fault, and (3) property damages.
On September 6, 2024, Carrillo
and Cordova filed the present motion. A hearing on their motion is set for
October 3, 2024, along with a case management conference/status conference re:
ADR on October 17, 2024.
ANALYSIS
Carrillo
and Cordova seek leave to file a First Amended Cross-Complaint (FACC). For the
following reasons, the court DENIES their motion.
Pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure section 1005, subdivisions (a)(10) and (b), a motion
and its supporting papers must be filed and served at least sixteen (16) court
days before the hearing date with an additional five days required if the
mailing address is within the State of California.
Here,
Carrillo and Cordova failed to provide a proof of service that establishes the
Mariz-Lopez Plaintiffs were timely served with copies of the present motion as
required by Code of Civil Procedure section 1005. Because “the court lacks
jurisdiction to rule on a motion that has not been properly noticed for hearing
on the date in question,” their motion is DENIED. (Diaz v.
Professional Community Management, Inc. (2017) 16 Cal.App.5th 1190,
1204-1205.)
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, Carrillo
and Cordova’s motion for leave to file a FACC is DENIED without
prejudice.
