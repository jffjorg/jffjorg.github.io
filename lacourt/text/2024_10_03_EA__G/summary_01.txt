```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendants, Salvador Carrillo and Veronica Cordova, have filed a motion to amend their cross-complaint. However, the court has denied this motion without prejudice. The reason for this denial is that the defendants failed to provide proof of service that shows the plaintiffs were timely served with a copy of the motion. According to California law, a motion and its supporting papers must be filed and served at least 16 court days before the hearing date, with an additional 5 days required if the mailing address is within the state. Because the defendants did not comply with this requirement, the court lacks jurisdiction to rule on their motion. The defendants' motion to amend their cross-complaint is therefore denied.
