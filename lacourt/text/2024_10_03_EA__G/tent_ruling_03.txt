 Case Number:  24PSCV02181    Hearing Date:   October 3, 2024    Dept:  G Defendant Claremont  Unified School District’s Motion for Stay of Proceedings Pending Resolution of  a District Court Writ Proceeding Concerning AB 218 Respondent:  Plaintiff Jane Doe TENTATIVE RULING Defendant Claremont  Unified School District’s Motion for Stay of Proceedings Pending Resolution of  a District Court Writ Proceeding Concerning AB 218 is  DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE. BACKGROUND This action arises from the alleged  sexual abuse of a high school student by school staff. Defendant David Jason  Williams was an English teacher and sports coach employed by Defendant  Claremont Unified School District (CUSD) at Claremont High School. Plaintiff  Jane Doe was a student at Claremont High School. During the 2002/2003 school  year, Doe alleges Williams sexually abused Doe on school premises. On July 9, 2024, Doe filed a  complaint against CUSD, Williams, and Does 1-60, alleging the following causes  of action: (1) sexual abuse/sexual battery of a minor, (2) intentional infliction  of emotional distress (IIED), (3) negligent hiring, supervision, and retention  of an unfit employee, (4) breach of mandatory duty to report suspected child  abuse, (5) negligent failure to warn, train, or educate, (6) negligent  supervision of a minor, and (7) negligence. On August 21, 2024, CUSD  filed the present motion. On September 24, 2024, the  court sustained CUSD’s demurrer to Doe’s Complaint in part with leave to amend. A hearing on the present  motion is set for October 3, 2024, along with a case management conference on  November 14, 2024. REQUESTS FOR JUDICIAL  NOTICE CUSD’s requests for judicial  notice of California court records is GRANTED pursuant to Evidence Code  section 452, subdivision (d). ANALYSIS CUSD  moves to stay the present action pending resolution of two writ proceedings in  separate actions. For the following reasons, the court DENIES  WITHOUT PREJUDICE CUSD’s motion. Legal Standard “Trial  courts generally have the inherent power to stay proceedings in the interests  of justice and to promote judicial efficiency.”  (Freiberg v. City of  Mission Viejo (1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 1484, 1489.)  They also have inherent  powers to manage and fashion procedures to control litigation and ensure the  orderly administration of justice.  (Cottle v. Superior Court (1992) 3  Cal.App.4th 1367, 1376-79; see also Code Civ. Proc., § 128, subd. (a)(3)  and (a)(5).) Discussion In  this case, CUSD argues the court should stay the present action until two  separate writ proceedings that address the constitutionality of AB 218 are  resolved. In the first proceeding, the First District Court of Appeal held AB  218 did not violate the California Constitution’s gift clause. (West Contra  Costa Unified School District v. Superior Court of Contra Costa County (2024)  103 Cal.App.5th 1243 [323 Cal.Rptr.3d 904, 908-909] (WCCUSD), petn. for  review pending, petn. filed September 9, 2024.) In the second proceeding, a petition  for a writ of mandate was filed with the Second District Court of Appeal that  challenged a superior court’s ruling on the same issue. (RJN No. 10.) CUSD  argues these proceedings create a risk of conflicting decisions regarding the  constitutionality of AB 218. But this argument fails as the decision in WCCUSD  currently remains good law. CUSD’s argument is based on the assumption that  the California Supreme Court will actually grant the petition for review in WCCUSD,  which it has not yet done, and that the Second District Court of Appeal will  actually issue a published opinion that finds AB 218 unconstitutional. Furthermore,  even if one of these instances occur, WCCUSD may well remain persuasive  authority for this court until the California Supreme Court renders its own  opinion. (See Auto Equity Sales, Inc. v. Superior Court of Santa Clara  County (1962) 57 Cal.2d 450, 456 (Auto Equity Sales) [holding when appellate  decisions are in conflict, “the court exercising inferior jurisdiction can and  must make a choice between the conflicting decisions”]; Cal. Rules of Court, Rule  8.1115(e)(3) and corresponding Comment, par. 2.) Accordingly,  the court DENIES WITHOUT PREJUDICE CUSD’s motion. CONCLUSION Based on the foregoing, CUSD’s  motion to stay the present proceeding is DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.
