And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Claremont Unified School District (CUSD) has moved to stay the proceedings in this sexual abuse case pending the resolution of two writ proceedings that address the constitutionality of AB 218. The court has denied this motion without prejudice. CUSD argues that the two writ proceedings create a risk of conflicting decisions regarding the constitutionality of AB 218, but the court finds that the decision in West Contra Costa Unified School District v. Superior Court of Contra Costa County (2024) currently remains good law. The court also notes that even if one of the writ proceedings results in a conflicting decision, the decision in West Contra Costa Unified School District v. Superior Court of Contra Costa County (2024) may still be persuasive authority for the court until the California Supreme Court renders its own opinion.
