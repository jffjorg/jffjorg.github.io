And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled on a motion to compel further responses to Form Interrogatories (FROG) filed by Plaintiffs Meredith Paz and Victor Paz against the City of Sierra Madre. The Plaintiffs are seeking additional information from the City regarding its responses to their FROGs.

The judge has granted the motion as to FROG Nos. 1.1 and 15.1. FROG No. 1.1 asks the City to identify the individuals involved in preparing its responses, and FROG No. 15.1 asks for additional information regarding denials and affirmative defenses.

The judge has denied the motion as to FROG No. 17.1, which asks for additional information regarding the City's responses to Request for Admissions (RFAs). The judge has continued the motion regarding FROG No. 17.1 to December 13, 2024, pending the outcome of a separate motion to compel further responses to RFAs.

The judge has also deferred the issue of sanctions to December 13, 2024, when the City will be required to provide further responses to the FROGs. The Plaintiffs had requested sanctions in the amount of $2,510 against the City and its counsel.
