The judge has denied the plaintiff's application for a writ of possession.

The defendant represented to the court that she had returned the vehicle to the dealership in October 2022. The plaintiff failed to respond to a court order to provide evidence that the vehicle was not returned to the dealership. As a result, the judge denied the plaintiff's request for a writ of possession.
