 Case Number:  23STCV26012    Hearing Date:   March 28, 2024    Dept:  85 
Sonia Feldman v. Mark
Anthony Sawyer et al. 23STCV26012
Tentative decision on application
for right to attach order: granted 




 
            
 
Plaintiff Sonia Feldman (“Feldman”) applies for a right to
attach order against Defendant Mark Anthony Sawyer (“Sawyer”) in the amount of
$2,837,335.38.
            The
court has read and considered the moving papers and ex parte opposition (no
subsequent opposition or reply was filed) and renders the following tentative
decision.
 
            A. Statement of the Case
            1.
Complaint
            Plaintiff
Feldman filed her Complaint on October 24, 2023 against Defendants Sawyer, dba
MAS Financing, Gaelen Patrick Whittemore, aka Ben Whittemore (“Gaelen”), Sonja
Domino Powell, aka Sonja Domino Whittemore, aka Domino Whittemore (“Domino”) (collectively,
Gaelen and Domino are referred to as the “Whittemores”), and the DND Family
Trust (“DND”).  The Complaint alleges causes
of action for breach of contract, open book account, fraud, conversion, unjust
enrichment, and unfair competition.   The Complaint alleges in pertinent part as
follows.
            Gaelen,
Feldman’s mentor and teacher in the music industry, introduced her to Sawyer.  Gaelen and his wife Domino explained to Feldman
that their friend Sawyer was a “financial genius” who could help Feldman
recover the financial losses she had incurred from prior, dishonest individuals
in the music business.  Feldman admits that
she was naïve in trusting these individuals.  She was only 23 years old when both of her
parents had passed away, leaving her with over two million dollars in
inheritance. 
            The
Whittemores told Feldman that Sawyer could help Feldman regain the millions of
dollars she had lost.  They asserted that
Sawyer was making a fortune with bridge loans earning interest of up to 19%
over a 90-day period.  Sawyer would use
Feldman’s money to make bridge loans that would earn high interest.  
            When
Feldman and Sawyer talked over the phone, he made the same promise as the Whittemores.  He asserted that he would take the money
people like Feldman invested with him, use it to make bridge loans to those in
dire need of money, and use the profits from those loans to repay the investors
with interest.  The interest rates ranged
from 11.6% to 16% over a 90-day period, or 76% annually.  Sawyer backed the promise to repay with
signed promissory notes.
            On
January 29, 2021, Feldman initiated a $10,000 loan to Sawyer for the purpose of
making an investment through Sawyer’s “bridge loan program.”  Sawyer signed and executed a promissory note,
drafted by Domino, whereby Sawyer promised to pay Feldman back within 95 days.  In exchange for value received, the promissory
note provided that “on or before 05/04/2021 and without further notice, demand,
or invoice from Feldman, Sawyer shall pay Feldman the fixed sum of $11,600.” 
            The
Whittemores had explained to Feldman that by “rolling the notes over and over,”
Feldman would be able to make back the millions she had lost.  After the January promissory note was
executed, Feldman did not exercise her option to have Sawyer pay her $11,600.  Instead, on May 21, 2021, Feldman chose to
“roll it over” into a new promissory note under which Feldman would be repaid
$12,992 by August 26, 2021.  Defendants
had emphasized to her that was how she would make more money.
            Feldman
was so enraptured by Defendants that she opted to sell her home so she could
invest the $1,166,337.13 proceeds in the program.  On April 30, 2021, Feldman invested these
proceeds with Sawyer, who signed a promissory note with the same terms and 95-day
turnaround as the January promissory note.  Feldman chose to roll over the $1,387,941.18
promised under this April promissory note into a new promissory note on August 20,
2021.  Under this promissory note, Sawyer
promised to pay Feldman $1,554,235.30 on November 20, 2021.
            All
the Defendants knew that Feldman would never see the $1,176,337.13 she had
transferred to Sawyer because they would keep convincing her to roll over the
proceeds.  Feldman continued to invest
for approximately two years.
            In
a promissory note dated February 17, 2023, Sawyer promised to repay Feldman
$24,740.24 on May 22, 2023. This was the last promissory note in the series of
rollovers from the $10,000 invested in January 2021.  On March 10, 2023, Feldman and Sawyer signed
one last promissory note in which Sawyer promised to repay $2,812,595 on June
10, 2023. 
            In
the summer of 2023, Feldman requested repayment of $200,000.  She was told that such a sum could not be withdrawn
from Sawyer’s bank account at any one time because Sawyer had mistakenly done a
deal with money-launderers.  
            After
more time lapsed, and Feldman had made more inquiries without avail, Feldman
demanded to pull all her money out of the program.  Defendants did not return Feldman’s investment.
 A demand letter was sent to Sawyer to no
effect.
            Defendants
have not used Feldman’s money to make bridge loans.  They used it for personal matters and planned
to indefinitely lie to Feldman about her investment funds.
            Feldman
seeks (1) $3,149,689.67 based on breach of contract or an open book account, plus
interest at an annual rate of 10%; (2) $2,837,335.24 based on breach of
contract, plus interest at an annual rate of 10%; (3) $1,176,337.13 plus treble
punitive damages, plus interest at an annual rate of 10%; (4) on order
prohibiting Defendants from holding themselves out to the public as financial
advisors or loan agents, and from engaging in or working for any financial
institution or loan agency; (5) actual, compensatory, and reliance damages,
estimated to be $3,149,689.67; (6) transfer of the title of 1341 N. Evergreen
Street, Burbank, CA 91505-2106 (“Property”) from DND to Feldman, along with any
other properties in the names of the Defendants or their trusts based on the
doctrine of unjust enrichment; (7) punitive damages; and (8) attorney’s fees
and costs.
 
            2.
Course of Proceedings
            On
December 5, 2023, the Whittemores filed separate Answers.
            On
December 8, 2023, Feldman served Sawyer with the Complaint and Summons by
substitute service, effective December 18, 2023.
            On
January 24, 2024, Department 40 (Hon. Anne Richardson) rejected Feldman’s
request for entry of default against Sawyer.
            On
February 6, 2024, Department 40 entered default against Sawyer.
            On
February 8, 2024, pursuant to Feldman’s request, Department 40 dismissed the
entire action against DND.  
            On
February 13, 2024, the parties stipulated to set aside Sawyer’s default.
            On
February 20, 2024, this court denied Feldman’s ex parte application for
a right to attach order against Sawyer but granted a temporary protective order
(“TPO”) and scheduled this hearing. 
There is no proof of service showing that the TPO has been served.
            On
February 23, 2024, Feldman filed an undertaking by posting a bond of $10,000.
 
            B.
Applicable Law
            Attachment
is a prejudgment remedy providing for the seizure of one or more of the
defendant’s assets to aid in the collection of a money demand pending the
outcome of the trial of the action.  See
Whitehouse v. Six Corporation, (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 527, 533.  In 1972, and in a 1977 comprehensive
revision, the Legislature enacted attachment legislation (CCP §481.010 et
seq.) that meets the due process requirements set forth in Randone v.
Appellate Department, (1971) 5 Cal.3d 536. 
See Western Steel & Ship Repair v. RMI, (12986) 176
Cal.App.3d 1108, 1115.  As the attachment
statutes are purely the creation of the Legislature, they are strictly
construed.  Vershbow v. Reiner,
(1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 879, 882.




            A
writ of attachment may be issued only in an action on a claim or claims for
money, each of which is based upon a contract, express or implied, where the
total amount of the claim or claims is a fixed or readily ascertainable amount
not less than five hundred dollars ($500). 
CCP §483.010(a).  A claim is
“readily ascertainable” where the amount due may be clearly ascertained from
the contract and calculated by evidence; the fact that damages are unliquidated
is not determinative.  CIT
Group/Equipment Financing, Inc. v. Super DVD, Inc., (2004) 115 Cal.App.4th
537, 540-41 (attachment appropriate for claim based on rent calculation for
lease of commercial equipment).
            All
property within California of a corporation, association, or partnership is
subject to attachment if there is a method of levy for the property.  CCP §487.010(a), (b).  While a trustee is a natural person, a trust
is not.  Therefore, a trust’s property is
subject to attachment on the same basis as a corporation or partnership.  Kadison, Pfaelzer, Woodard, Quinn &
Rossi v. Wilson, supra, 197 Cal.App.3d at 4.
            If
the action is against a defendant who is a natural person, an attachment may be
issued only on a commercial claim which arises out of the defendant’s conduct
of a trade, business, or profession.  CCP
§483.010(c).  Consumer transactions
cannot form a basis for attachment.   CCP
§483.010(c); Kadison, Pfaelzer, Woodard, Quinn & Rossi v. Wilson,
(1987) 197 Cal.App.3d 1, 4 (action involving trust property was a commercial,
not a consumer, transaction).
            The
plaintiff may apply for a right to attach order by noticing a hearing for the
order and serving the defendant with summons and complaint, notice of the
application, and supporting papers any time after filing the complaint.  CCP §484.010. 
Notice of the application must be given pursuant to CCP section 1005,
sixteen court days before the hearing.  See
ibid.
            The
notice of the application and the application may be made on Judicial Council
forms (Optional Forms AT-105, 115).  The
application must be supported by an affidavit showing that the plaintiff on the
facts presented would be entitled to a judgment on the claim upon which the
attachment is based.  CCP §484.030.  
            Where
the defendant is a corporation, a general reference to “all corporate property
which is subject to attachment pursuant to subdivision (a) of Code of Civil
Procedure Section 487.010” is sufficient. 
CCP §484.020(e).  Where the
defendant is a partnership or other unincorporated association, a reference to
“all property of the partnership or other unincorporated association which is
subject to attachment pursuant to subdivision (b) of Code of Civil Procedure
Section 487.010” is sufficient.  CCP
§484.020(e).  A specific description of
property is not required for corporations and partnerships as they generally
have no exempt property.  Bank of
America v. Salinas Nissan, Inc., (“Bank of America”) (1989) 207
Cal.App.3d 260, 268.
            Where
the defendant is a natural person, the description of the property must be
reasonably adequate to permit the defendant to identify the specific property
sought to be attached.  CCP §484.020(e).  Although the property must be specifically
described, the plaintiff may target for attachment everything the individual
defendant owns.  Bank of America v.
Salinas Nissan, Inc., (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 260, 268.
            A
defendant who opposes issuance of the order must file and serve a notice of
opposition and supporting affidavit as required by CCP section 484.060 not
later than five court days prior to the date set for hearing.  CCP §484.050(e).  The notice of opposition may be made on a
Judicial Council form (Optional Form AT-155). 

            The
plaintiff may file and serve a reply two court days prior to the date set for
the hearing.  CCP §484.060(c). 
            At
the hearing, the court determines whether the plaintiff should receive a right
to attach order and whether any property which the plaintiff seeks to attach is
exempt from attachment.  The defendant
may appear the hearing.  CCP
§484.050(h).  The court generally will
evaluate the attachment application based solely on the pleadings and
supporting affidavits without taking additional evidence.  Bank of America, supra, 207
Cal.App.3d at 273. A verified complaint may be used in lieu of or in addition
to an affidavit if it states evidentiary facts. 
CCP §482.040.  The plaintiff has the
burden of proof, and the court is not required to accept as true any affidavit
even if it is undisputed.  See Bank
of America, supra, at 271, 273.



            The
court may issue a right to attach order (Optional Form AT-120) if the plaintiff
shows all of the following: (1) the claim on which the attachment is based is
one on which an attachment may be issued (CCP §484.090(a)(1)); (2) the
plaintiff has established the probable validity of the claim (CCP
§484.090(a)(2)); (3) attachment is sought for no purpose other than the
recovery on the subject claim (CCP §484.090(a)(3); and (4) the amount to be
secured by the attachment is greater than zero (CCP §484.090(a)(4)). 
            A
claim has “probable validity” where it is more likely than not that the
plaintiff will recover on that claim. 
CCP §481.190.  In determining this
issue, the court must consider the relative merits of the positions of the
respective parties.  Kemp Bros.
Construction, Inc. v. Titan Electric Corp., (2007) 146 Cal.App.4th 1474,
1484.  The court does not determine
whether the claim is actually valid; that determination will be made at trial
and is not affected by the decision on the application for the order.  CCP §484.050(b).
            Except
in unlawful detainer actions, the amount to be secured by the attachment is the
sum of (1) the amount of the defendant’s indebtedness claimed by the plaintiff,
and (2) any additional amount included by the court for estimate of costs and
any allowable attorneys’ fees under CCP section 482.110.  CCP §483.015(a); Goldstein v. Barak
Construction, (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 845, 852.  This amount must be reduced by the sum of (1)
the amount of indebtedness that the defendant has in a money judgment against plaintiff,
(2) the amount claimed in a cross-complaint or affirmative defense and shown
would be subject to attachment against the plaintiff, and (3) the value of any
security interest held by the plaintiff in the defendant’s property, together
with the amount by which the acts of the plaintiff (or a prior holder of the
security interest) have decreased that security interest’s value.  CCP §483.015(b).  A defendant claiming that the amount to be
secured should be reduced because of a cross-claim or affirmative defense must
make a prima facie showing that the claim would result in an attachment
against the plaintiff.
            Before
the issuance of a writ of attachment, the plaintiff is required to file an
undertaking to pay the defendant any amount the defendant may recover for any
wrongful attachment by the plaintiff in the action.  CCP §489.210. 
The undertaking ordinarily is $10,000. CCP §489.220.  If the defendant objects, the court may
increase the amount of undertaking to the amount determined as the probable
recovery for wrongful attachment.  CCP
§489.220.  The court also has inherent
authority to increase the amount of the undertaking sua sponte.  North Hollywood Marble Co. v. Superior
Court, (1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 683, 691.
 
            C. Statement of Facts
            1.
Feldman’s Evidence 
Feldman is a singer-songwriter.  Feldman Decl., ¶1.  In November 2018, Feldman met Defendant Gaelen
Whittemore in a songwriting class that Gaelen was teaching.  Feldman Decl., ¶3.  Over time, Gaelen became Feldman’s teacher and
mentor.  After confiding in Gaelen that she
had spent over a million dollars on paying others to assist with her musical
career, Gaelen shared with Whittemore that she hoped to be able to make the
money back one day.  Feldman Decl., ¶3.  
Gaelen then introduced Feldman to his wife, Domino.  Feldman Decl., ¶4.  The Whittemores then introduced Feldman to
Sawyer, and the three Defendants explained to Feldman that she could
participate in Sawyer’s bridge loan program.  Feldman Decl., ¶4.  Defendants said Feldman could recover the
millions of dollars she previously lost through loaning money to Defendant
Sawyer.  Feldman Decl. ¶4. 
After hearing Defendants’ explanation how the bridge loan
program worked, Feldman first transferred Sawyer $10,000 on or about January
29, 2021.  Feldman Decl., Ex. C.  In exchange for the funds, Feldman and Sawyer
executed and signed a promissory note containing a provision promising Sawyer
would pay Feldman $11,600.00 in return for the loan.  Id.  Sawyer’s payment was due to Feldman on May 4,
2021.  Id.  During the pendency of the promissory notes,
Defendants encouraged Feldman to “roll the notes over” for additional promissory
notes and Feldman did so.  Feldman Decl., ¶9.  Feldman continued
to transfer funds for two years, the most recent promissory notes being signed
in February and March of 2023.  Feldman
Decl. ¶10.
On February 17,
2023, Defendant Sawyer executed a promissory note for the sum of $22,089.50.  Feldman Decl., F.  This promissory note had a 95-day
loan period, making Sawyer’s payment due to Feldman on May 22, 2023. Id.
 Feldman provides a copy of this promissory
note which appears to have been created with “DocuSign” and evidences Mark
Sawyer’s signature. Id.[MC1] 
On March 10, 2023,
Sawyer executed a promissory note for the sum of $2,812,595.14.  Feldman Decl. Ex. E.  This promissory note had 90-day loan period,
making its payment date June 10, 2023. Like the February promissory note, the
June promissory note also appears to have been drafted through “DocuSign” and evidences
Sawyer’s signature. Id.
All the promissory
notes had a provision calling for payment to be made to Feldman without further
notice, demand, or invoice from her.  Feldman
Decl., Exs. A-B, E-F.  By the summer of
2023 and after Feldman requested for the first time that she collect a payment to
which she was entitled, Defendants informed Feldman that she would have to wait
because the $200,000 she was requesting was not available.  Feldman Decl., ¶¶ 11-12.  
After Feldman
inquired further, Gaelen informed her that Sawyer’s funds were held up in the
bank because he did busines[MC2] s
with some people that were money laundering.  Feldman Decl. ¶12, Exs. N-O.  Feldman then demanded to be repaid.  When Defendants maintained they did not have
the funds, Feldman retained an attorney, Michael Machat, Esq. (“Machat”). Machat
Decl., ¶¶ 12-14. 
In a conversation with Machat following October 23, 2023,
Sawyer told Machat that his accounts were frozen due to his business transactions
with individuals who were arrested for money laundering but that they should be
unfrozen soon.  Machat Decl., ¶5, Ex.  Machat requested the names of the arrested
individuals, but, Sawyer claimed the names were confidential. Id. 
On January 8, 2024, Machat issued a subpoena duces tecum to
JPMorgan Chase Bank to trace the funds transferred from Feldman to Defendant’s
account.  Machat Decl., ¶8.  On Sawyer’s May 2021 bank statement shows
that on May 7, 2021 Feldman’s check was deposited into his bank account.  Machat Decl., Ex. L.  The next day, May 8, 2021, the funds tracing
back to Feldman were used to write a check to the Vegas Auto Gallery for
$925,000.  Machat Decl., ¶9; Ex. L, check
# 454.  On May 17, 2021, Sawyer wrote
check number 456 to the Vegas Auto Gallery for $100,000.  Machat Decl. Ex. L.  Sawyer made payroll payments of $10,763.04 and
$11,166.42 ,on May 14, 2021 and May 18, 2021, respectively.  Machat Decl., Ex. L. Sawyer also wrote checks
in the amounts of $1,000,000, $500,000, and $200,000 to the Vegas Auto Gallery.
 Machat Decl., Ex. M.  Two more checks in the sums of $1,000,000 and
$500,00, show that Sawyer acquired an equity position in the Vegas Auto
Gallery.  The back of the checks show
that Vegas Auto Gallery is the dba of Haute Auto Group LLC.  Machat Decl., ¶11. 
Sawyer’s website for his business, MAS Financing, is
Sawyer’s money lending business, demonstrating he lends money in the capacity
of a commercial lender.  Machat Decl., ¶7.
 
Attorney Chadwick Johnson contacted Machat on January 17,
2024, and shared the same pattern of bridge loan lending followed by
communications expressing that the funds are tied up with the banks but should
be released soon.  Machat Decl., ¶15-17,
Ex. N. Machat has been contacted by Chadwick Johnson, Lakisha R. Washington,
Bryant Hu, and Stephen S. Chang, each individuals and/or attorneys of
individuals reporting similar experiences to Feldman.  Machat Decl., ¶¶ 15-21. Exs. N-Q.
 
            D. Analysis
            Plaintiff
Feldman applies for a right to attach order against Defendant Mark Sawyer in the amount of $2,837,355.38.  Sawyer filed an opposition to the ex parte application
but no additional opposition has been filed.
 
            1.
A Claim Based on a Contract
and on Which Attachment May Be Based
            A
writ of attachment may be issued only in an action on a claim or claims for
money, each of which is based upon a contract, express or implied, where the
total amount of the claim or claims is a fixed or readily ascertainable amount
not less than five hundred dollars ($500). 
CCP §483.010(a).
            Feldman
claims $2,837,355.38 for breach of Sawyer’s obligations in the two promissory
notes made on March 10, 2023, and May 22, 2023 for $2,812,595.14 and
$24,740.24, respectively.  Feldman Decl.,
Ex. E-F. Thus, Feldman has two contract claims on which to base attachment. 
 
            2 . An Amount Due That is Fixed
and Readily Ascertainable 
            A
claim is “readily ascertainable” where the damages may be readily ascertained by
reference to the contract and the basis of the calculation appears to be
reasonable and definite.  CIT
Group/Equipment Financing, Inc. v. Super DVD, Inc., (2004) 115 Cal.App.4th 537,
540-41.  The fact that the damages are
unliquidated is not determinative.  Id.  But the contract must furnish a standard by
which the amount may be ascertained and there must be a basis by which the
damages can be determined by proof.  Id.
(citations omitted).
 
            a.
Breach of Contract
The promissory note dated February 17, 2023 provides for a payment
due date on May 22, 2023.  Feldman Decl.,
Ex. F. The promissory note identifies the Borrower as “Mark A. Sawyer” and the
Lender as “Sonia Feldman.”  Feldman.
Decl. Ex. F.  The “Total Amount Due on Payment
Due Date is $24,740. 24.  Feldman Decl.
Ex. F.  Any portion of the $24, 740.24
not paid in full shall accrue late charges at the rate of 10% per annum until
paid.  Feldman Decl., Ex. F. 
The promissory note dated March 10, 2023 provides for a payment
due date on  June 10, 2023.”  Feldman Decl., E.   The contract identifies the Borrower as
“Mark A. Sawyer” and the Lender as “Sonia Feldman.”  Feldman. Decl. Ex. E.  The “Total Amount Due on Payment Due Date is
$2, 812, 595.14.  Feldman Decl. Ex. E.  Any portion of the $2,812,595.14 not paid in
full shall accrue late charges at the rate of 10% per annum until paid.  Feldman Decl., Ex. E., Feldman Decl., E-F. 
            As
both dates have passed and Feldman has not yet received payment, both promissory
notes are in breach.  Feldman
demonstrates breach of contract in the readily and ascertainable amounts of
$24, 740.24 and $ $2,812,595.14, respectively.  Feldman Decl., Exs. E-F.  The total damages of $2,837,355.38 are readily
ascertainable.
 
            3. Probability of Success
            A
claim has “probable validity” where it is more likely than not that the
plaintiff will recover on that claim. 
CCP §481.190.  In determining this
issue, the court must consider the relative merits of the positions of the
respective parties.  Kemp Bros.
Construction, Inc. v. Titan Electric Corp., (2007) 146 Cal.App.4th 1474,
1484.  The court does not determine
whether the claim is actually valid; that determination will be made at trial
and is not affected by the decision on the application for the order.  CCP §484.050(b).
            On  February 17, 2023 and March 10, 2023, Feldman
and Sawyer entered into two contracts in the form of promissory notes.  Feldman, Decl., Exs. E-F.  Both contracts provide for payment, without an
affirmative need for demand, in the amounts of $24,740.24, and $2,812,595.14.  Id.  The respective due dates of May 22 and June
10, 2023 have both passed.  Feldman has
provided evidence of continued demands for payment.  Machat Decl. Ex. D, G, and J.  
Sawyer’s opposition argues on the merits that the nature of
his business activity with Feldman was bridge loans and the third party
borrowers have Feldman’s funds. 
Otherwise, Feldman’s evidence shows that an auto business has her
funds.  Ex Parte Opp. at 5.
This argument is spurious. 
What Sawyer did with Feldman’s money bears on her fraud claim[1]
but not her breach of contract claim. 
She loaned money to Sawyer who did not repay it.  
            Thus,
Feldman has demonstrated a probability of success on the merits.
 
            4.
Attachment Based on Commercial Claim
            If
the action is against a defendant who is a natural person, an attachment may be
issued only on a commercial claim which arises out of the defendant’s conduct
of a trade, business, or profession.  CCP
§483.010(c).  Consumer transactions
cannot form a basis for attachment.   CCP
§483.010(c); Kadison, Pfaelzer, Woodard, Quinn & Rossi v. Wilson, (“Kadison”)
(1987) 197 Cal.App.3d 1, 4 (action involving trust property was a commercial,
not a consumer, transaction).
            These terms “trade,”
“business,” and “profession” encompass almost any activity engaged in for
profit with “frequency and continuity.”  Advance
Transformer Co. v. Superior Court, (1974) 44 Cal.App.3d 127, 139. 
The purpose of the attachment statutes is to confine attachment to
commercial situations and prohibit their use in consumer transactions.  Kadison, supra, 197 Cal.App.3d
at 4.
            Sawyer is the borrower
on both promissory notes.  Feldman Decl., Exs E-F. All
Defendants, including Sawyer, represented to Feldman that Sawyer was receiving
and rolling over” Feldman’s loans through his Bridge Loan Program.  Feldman Decl., ¶¶ 4-5.  Sawyer’s website demonstrates that he is in
the money lending business.  Machat
Decl., Ex. J.  The claim against
Defendant Sawyer is a commercial claim.

Description of Property to be Attached
            Where
the defendant is a natural person, the description of the property must be
reasonably adequate to permit the defendant to identify the specific property
sought to be attached.  CCP §484.020(e).  Although the property must be specifically
described, the plaintiff may target for attachment everything the individual
defendant owns.  Bank of America v.
Salinas Nissan, Inc., (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 260, 268. The requirement of
specificity avoids unnecessary hearings where an individual defendant is
willing to concede that the described property is subject to attachment.  Ibid. 
A general list of categories - e.g., “real property, personal
property, equipment, motor vehicles, chattel paper, negotiable and other
instruments, securities, deposit accounts, safe-deposit boxes, accounts
receivable, general intangibles, property subject to pending actions, final
money judgments, and personal property in decedents’ estates” – is
sufficient.  Ibid. 
            Feldman
seeks to attach Sawyer’s interest in any real property, cash deposits in bank
accounts, and inventory.  The description
of these three categories is
adequate.
 
6. Attachment Sought for a Proper Purpose 
            Attachment
must not be sought for a purpose other than the recovery on the claim upon
which attachment is based.  CCP §484.090(a)(3). Feldman seeks attachment
for a proper purpose.   
 
            7.
Undertaking
            Before
issuance of a writ of attachment, the plaintiff shall file an undertaking to
pay the defendant any amount the defendant may recover for any wrongful
attachment by the plaintiff in the action. 
CCO §489.210.
            On
February 23, 2023, Feldman filed an undertaking that was executed and signed
February 20, 2024 with Colonial Surety Company for a bond in the amount of
10,000, as requested by the Court. 
Feldman Undertaking.  
 
            E. Conclusion
            The
application for a right to attach order is granted against Sawyer for
$2,837,355.38. Feldman has already posted an undertaking.  Feldman has not provided a proposed right to
attach order after hearing and is ordered to do so within two court days or it
will be waived.
