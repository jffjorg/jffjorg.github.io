And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case between Megeen and Caltrans. The judge finds that Caltrans failed to lodge a courtesy copy of its opposition, in violation of the Presiding Judge's First Amended General Order Re: Mandatory Electronic Filing. As a result, Caltrans is admonished to provide a courtesy copy of its opposition for the trial, or it will not be considered.

The judge also notes that Megeen misidentifies Exhibit 5 and fails to attach Exhibit 4, an email asking Caltrans about a discrepancy between the two parcel diaries. Additionally, Megeen's argument that there must be more parcel diary entries for the Property is deemed insufficient, as it does not meet the court's order to meet and confer in person.

The judge finds that Megeen contends that Caltrans has a duty under 49 C.F.R section 24.9 to maintain adequate records of its displacement activities up to three years after the displaced family has received all benefits. Megeen argues that there must be more diary records because a tenant occupied the Property at some point between 2014 and 2017, there was a break-in in 2000, and movies and television shows were filmed on the Property in 2002, 2013, and 2016. Caltrans, on the other hand, asserts that it has produced all readily discernible responsive documents and that parcel diaries are written by right of way agents assigned to tenant-occupied properties. The judge notes that the Property was vacant from 1999 to 2014 and from 2016 thereafter, and therefore, no right of way agent would have kept a parcel diary with entries about the incidents at issue.
