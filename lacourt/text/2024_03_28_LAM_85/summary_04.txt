  - "A document is deliberative to the extent that it is actually 'related to the process by which policies are formulated'."
  - "Publicly releasing information about potential discipline before the County makes any final disciplinary decisions could jeopardize the employee's due process rights and undermine the County's ability to implement a disciplinary action."
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has considered the parties' written objections and has ruled on them. The court finds that the County does not have a valid reason to withhold certain documents, including those related to Kwong's suspension. The County's argument that publicly releasing information about potential discipline could jeopardize Kwong's due process rights is not relevant, as the County had not taken any disciplinary action against Kwong at the time the requests were made. The court also finds that the County's failure to provide documents related to Kwong's suspension was not an undue burden, as the County had waived any such claim. The court's tentative ruling is that the County must disclose certain documents, including those related to Kwong's suspension and the reasons for it.
