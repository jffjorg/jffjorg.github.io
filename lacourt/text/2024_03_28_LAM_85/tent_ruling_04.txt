            [1] All further
statutory references are to the Government Code unless stated otherwise.


            [2] In 2023, the
California Legislature re-codified the CPRA.


            [3] The court
has ruled on the parties’ written objections. 
The clerk is directed to scan and electronically file the court’s
rulings.


            [4] Field’s
declaration asserts that Exhibit O is an ACGME report showing this
“Probationary Accreditation” status. 
Field Decl., ¶10.  The declaration
does not include this exhibit.


[5] As Ryan
notes, the County does not assert or mention, inter alia, the personnel
records exemption (§7927.700), the
records of investigation exemption (§7923.600),
or the right to privacy (Cal. Const.,
art. I, §1).  See Reply at 3.  


[6] Federal judicial interpretations of FOIA may be used
in construing the CPRA.  Id. at 79.
  


[7] The
court does not understand the County’s argument that it cannot expand on the
issues of burdens imposed by the Requests, but any undue burden issue has been
waived.


[8] ACGME
placed Harbor-UCLA on probationary accreditation status on June 21, 2023,
before three Harbor-UCLA employees filed lawsuits against the County.  Opp. at 9, n. 1.


[9] It is
worth noting that the County admits that Kwong was suspended in April 2022, and
Ryan’s October 4, 2022 Requests specifically sought all documents indicating Kwong’s
suspension and the reasons for it.  Ryan
Decl., ¶8, Ex. A.  Nonetheless, without
reasonable cause to believe the charges were well-founded when the Kwong
Requests were denied, the County was not required to provide these suspension
records.
 


[10] “A
document is predecisional” where “prepared in order to assist an agency
decisionmaker in arriving at his decision” rather than to support a decision
already made. The decision must be antecedent to the adoption of the agency
policy.  ACLU, supra, 202 Cal.App.4th at 76 (citations and
quotation marks omitted). 


[11] A
document is deliberative to the extent that it is actually “related to the
process by which policies are formulated.” 
Fox News Network, LLC v.
U.S. Department of the Treasury, (S.D.N.Y. 2010) 739 F.Supp.2d 515, 541
(citations and quotation marks omitted). 



[12] The County
adds that Kwong has due process rights as a County employee under Skelly v.
State Personnel Bd., (1975) 15 Cal. 3d 194, 206-08.  When Ryan
submitted the Kwong Requests in 2022, the County had not taken disciplinary
actions against Kwong.  Mathers Decl., ¶6.  Publicly
releasing information about potential discipline before the County makes any
final disciplinary decisions could jeopardize the employee’s due process rights
and undermine the County’s ability to implement a disciplinary action.  Id., ¶9.  Opp.
at 12.  The court finds that Kwong’s due
process rights have little or no bearing on the public interest in disclosure.


[13] For LASD,
Request No. 3 sought records of any complaints, arrests, charges against
individuals based on involvement in the diversion and or theft of controlled
substances at Harbor-UCLA between March 2015 and May 23, 2016, subject to
limitations in section 6254(f).  Ryan
Decl., ¶21, Ex. R.  LASD informed Ryan
that it was unable to locate records responsive to his request (Field Decl.
Ex. B, 37), and Ryan does not dispute that explanation.  This category is not at issue.  Opp. at 16.
