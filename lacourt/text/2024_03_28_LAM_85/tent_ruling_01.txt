  Case Number:  22STCP04207    Hearing Date:   March 28, 2024    Dept:  85 
Megeen McLaughlin and
Ryan McLaughlin v. California Department of Transportation, 22STCP04207


Tentative decision on motion
to compel further responses: denied



 
 
            Petitioner
Megeen McLaughlin moves to compel Respondent California Department of
Transportation (“Caltrans”) to provide further discovery responses to the Requests
for Production of Documents, Set Five (“RFPs”). 

            The court
has read and considered the moving papers, opposition, and reply,[1]
and renders the following tentative decision. 
 
            A. Statement of the Case
            1. The SAP
            Petitioners
Megeen McLaughlin (“Megeen”) and Ryan McLaughlin (“Ryan”) (collectively,
“McLaughlins”) filed the Petition against Respondent California Department of
Transportation (“Caltrans”) on November 29, 2022.  The operative pleading is the Second Amended
Petition (“SAP”) filed on February 27, 2024, alleging two causes of action,
both for writ of mandate or injunction.  The
verified SAP alleges in pertinent part as follows.
 
            a. Vacating
the Property
            The
McLaughlins were tenants in good standing at 1110 Glendon Way, South Pasadena,
CA 91030 (“Property”) from September 1991 to December 1999.  Megeen signed a lease for the Property on May
24, 1993.  Her son Ryan was a minor at the
beginning of this tenancy.  
            By 1998,
the Property was in negligent disrepair. 
In Spring 1999, the “Historic Properties Tenants Association” notified
Megeen by mail that Caltrans had developed a project to rehabilitate 80
historic homes along the 710 Freeway corridor route in Pasadena and South
Pasadena.  At the same time, Caltrans
Property Manager Marilyn J. Lavender (“Lavender”) informed Megeen that the
McLaughlins would be displaced from the Property so that Caltrans could
renovate it to comply with historical property standards.  
            To preserve
her right to purchase the Property under the Roberti Law, Megeen agreed to move
out only if Caltrans guaranteed to allow the McLaughlins to return after the
renovations.  Caltrans agreed, and Lavender
promised to provide a Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) to that effect soon
after the McLaughlins vacated.  Based on
Caltrans’s representations, Megeen believed that the renovations would begin as
soon as the McLaughlins vacated and would take only a year.  She also believed that the proposed
renovations were the only way to restore the Property to an adequate living
condition.  Thus, she agreed to
temporarily vacate the Property.  
            On December
2, 1999, shortly before the McLaughlins vacated the Property, Lavender
presented Megeen a document entitled “Residential Claim for Moving Expense by
Schedule or Actual Reasonable Cost” (“Moving Expense Sheet”).  The Moving Expense Sheet listed Megeen and
Ryan as claimants.  Lavender handwrote “RAP”
on top to demonstrate that the Moving Expense Sheet was for the Relocation
Assistance Program.  Megeen incorrectly signed
the document where a Caltrans representative should sign an acknowledgment that
the document and supporting evidence complies with applicable provisions of Title
49 Code of Federal Regulations (“C.F.R.”), Part 24.  
            The McLaughlins
vacated the Property in the second week of December 1999.  By that point, Ryan was 18 years old.  Because Caltrans only intended to temporarily
displace the McLaughlins, it did not pay the full amount of relocation benefits
required under 24 C.F.R. section 24.402(b)(1). 
It also failed to comply with notice requirements under the 1970 version
of 24 C.F.R. section 24.203(a), the duty to provide a comparable replacement
dwelling under then-24 C.F.R. section 24.204, and recordkeeping requirements under
then-49 C.F.R. section 24.9.
            In January
2001, Lavender asked Megeen via phone if she had received the promised MOU.  Megeen replied that she was still waiting for
it. 
            In September
2022, the McLaughlins made public records requests to Caltrans for documents
about their displacement from the Property. 
Caltrans only produced the Moving Expense Sheet.  To date, the only documents Caltrans has
produced are the documents the McLaughlins provided to Caltrans in August 2022.
            The
McLaughlins made a public records request for documents concerning Caltrans’
rehabilitation efforts for the Property under the Secretary of the Interior’s
Standards for Treatment of Historic Properties, 36 C.F.R., Part 68 (“Historic
Property Standards”).  The only document
provided was a Route 710 Historic Houses Condition Assessment Report from
October 15, 2002.  The 2002 report shows
the Property in the same state of disrepair as when the McLaughlins vacated
it.  A repair estimate from May 23, 2012
shows the same improvements as the renovation report and demonstrates that
Caltrans did not make any improvements in the ten years between the two
documents.  The rehabilitation project
either no longer existed or no longer applied to the Property.  
 
            b. Efforts
to Return
            Between
2000 and 2022, the McLaughlins’ replacement dwelling at 854 Bank Street. (“Bank
Property”) had a new property manager once every 1-2 years.  Each manager inspected the Bank Property at
least annually.  Each time there was a
new manager, Megeen told that manager about the McLaughlins’ displacement and
their intention to move back into the Property after its rehabilitation was
complete.  
             A repair report dated December 4, 2014 shows
that Property manager Angus Chan (“Chan”) called for move-in repairs to the Property.  
            In June
2015, Chan became manager of the Bank Property. 
Megeen told Chan about her intent to return to the Property.  Chan did not inform her that he was also manager
of the Property, that the Property had been renovated for move-in purposes, and
that it had not been renovated to comply with Historic Property Standards.  Had they known these facts, the McLaughlins
could have asserted their right to move back in at that time. 
            In November
2021, the City of South Pasadena (“City”) notified the McLaughlins that it
planned to purchase vacant Caltrans-owned properties within City limits.  Megeen contacted then-Property manager Michael
Means (“Means”) to assert the McLaughlins’ right to move back into the Property.  Later that month, Caltrans CFO Stephen Keck
(“Keck”) helped the McLaughlins contact Caltrans program manager Carolyn Dabney
(“Dabney”).  Dabney said that she would
speak to Edward Francis (“Francis”), Caltrans Deputy Director of District 7,
who had the final say on the issue.  
            From
November 2021 to August 2022, the McLaughlins attempted to contact Francis by
telephone and email as they had yet to hear from Dabney.  In August 2022, Ryan explained the situation
to Francis over the phone.  Although
Francis found Ryan’s assertions believable, he was not familiar with Caltrans’s
efforts to rehabilitate historic properties in that area.  Francis also informed Ryan that the Property
was fully renovated and vacant, although it had been rented to a tenant for a
short time.  This was the first time that
the McLaughlins learned that the Property was in “move in” condition.  
            On
September 14, 2022, Francis informed Ryan that he could not establish or
confirm Megeen’s right to the Property.  This
was the first formal denial of the McLaughlins’ right to move back into the Property.  
            On
September 20, 2022, the McLaughlins filed a claim against Caltrans with the
Department of General Services Office of Risk and Insurance Management.  In this claim, they sought to enforce Caltrans’s
promise to allow them to move back into the Property after its
restoration.  Caltrans did not respond to
this within 45 days or thereafter.    
 
            c. California
Relocation Assistance Act and Caltrans Guide
            The
McLaughlins’ displacement meets the Los Angeles County Department of Business
and Consumer Affairs, Division of Housing Protections’ definition of “temporarily
displaced tenants.”  They were displaced
to make repairs for conditions posing health and safety violations. The
California Relocation Assistance Act (“RAA”), Government Code (“Govt. Code”)
sections 7260-7277 establishes a uniform policy for persons displaced as a
direct result of programs or projects undertaken by a public entity.  
            Caltrans
failed to comply with the RAA.  If it
had, the McLaughlins would have known that per Govt. Code section 7261(c)(4),
they were not required to move from the Property until Caltrans provided a comparable
replacement dwelling.  Caltrans then
failed to provide Megeen with current and continued information on the rental
availability of such dwellings, or of the Property.  The failure to establish local advisory
assistance offices per Govt. Code section 7261(b) exacerbated this ignorance.
            Under Govt.
Code section 7265.3(d), Caltrans failed to give Megeen both actual notice that the
Property renovations were complete and the option of relocating back to the Property.  It then failed to provide the formal
administrative procedure for adjudicating her claim to relocate to the Property,
which Govt. Code section 7267.8 requires. 
It never allowed her to submit her claim before an impartial fact finder
with the opportunity to hear testimony and submit legal briefs.  Caltrans also failed to guide her through the
appeals process per the ministerial duty identified in its 1990 guide entitled
“Your Rights and Benefits as a Displacee Under the Uniform Relocation
Assistance Program (Residential)” (“Caltrans Guide”).  
 
            d. Prayer
for Relief
            Megeen
seeks (1) a writ of mandate compelling Caltrans to allow the McLaughlins to
return to the Property; (2) an order enjoining the sale of the Property during
this action; (3) an order binding Caltrans to its conduct and promises to the
extent the McLaughlins relied on them to their detriment, thereby allowing the McLaughlins
to return to the Property; and (4) costs of suit.
 
            2. Course
of Proceedings
            On November
30, 2022, the McLaughlins filed a lis pendens for the Property.  They served Caltrans with the Summons,
Petition, and lis pendens.
            On February
7, 2023, the McLaughlins filed the First Amended Petition (“FAP”).
            On March 1,
2023, the McLaughlins filed a second lis pendens for the Property.
            Also on
March 1, 2023, the court denied the McLaughlins’ ex parte application
for a temporary restraining order (“TRO”) and order to show cause re: preliminary
injunction (“OSC”), ruling that the McLaughlins had provided no evidence that they
qualify under the Roberti Law, they had delayed because they knew about the
City’s attempts to buy the Property since September 2021, and there was no
showing that a sale was eminent (and the McLaughlins would have to add the
buyer as a party if there was).
            On May 23,
2023, the court sustained Caltrans’ demurrer to the first cause of action as to
both Petitioners, and the second cause of action as to Ryan.
            On July 6,
2023, Petitioners dismissed Ryan as a Petitioner without prejudice.
            On August
2, 2023, Caltrans filed an Answer.
            On February
22, 2024, the court denied Megeen’s motion for judgment under CCP section
1094.  It granted leave to amend the FAP
only to allege a violation of the RAA.  The
court also extended the discovery cutoff to May 30, 2024, with orders to meet
and confer before any discovery motion was filed.
            On February
27, 2024, Megeen filed and served the SAP.
 
            B. Applicable Law
            If the
party demanding inspection receives a response to an inspection demand and
deems that (1) a statement of compliance with the demand is incomplete, (2) a
representation of inability to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive, or
(3) an objection in the response is without merit or too general, that party
may move for an order compelling further response to the demand.  CCP §2031.310.  The motion must set forth specific facts
showing good cause justifying the discovery sought by the demand.  CCP §2031.310(b)(1).  “Good cause” may be found to justify
discovery where specific facts show that the discovery is necessary for
effective trial preparation or to prevent surprise at trial.  Associated Brewers Dist. Co. v. Superior
Court, (1967) 65 Cal.3d 583, 588.  Where
there is no privilege issue or claim of attorney work product, the burden to
show “good cause” is met simply by a fact-specific showing of relevance.  Glenfed Development Corp. v. Superior
Court, (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 1113, 1117.
            Such a motion
must be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under CCP section 2016.040.  CCP §2031.310(b)(2).  Unless notice of the motion is given within
45 days of the service of the response, or any supplemental response, or on or
before any later date to which the propounding and responding parties have
agreed in writing, the propounding party waives any right to compel further
response to the requests for production. 
CCP §2031.310(c).
            Each motion
shall be accompanied by a separate document which sets forth each demand to
which a further response is requested, the response given, and the factual and
legal reasons for compelling it. CRC 3.1345(a)(2).  The separate statement must be full and
complete so that no person is required to review any other document to
determine the full request and the full response.  CRC 3.1345(c).  Material must not be incorporated by
reference.  CRC 3.1345(c). 
            In deciding
a motion under CCP section 2030.300 or 2031.310, the trial court must, of
necessity, consider not only the stated objections to the discovery requests,
but also the requests themselves, as well as the pleadings, and the contentions
of the propounding party of the purpose and validity of the
interrogatories.  See Columbia
Broadcast System, Inc. v. Superior Court, (1968) 263 Cal.App.2d 12,
18.  If interrogatories are reasonably
subject to objection as calling for the disclosure of matters so remote from
the subject matter of the action to make their disclosure of little or no
practical benefit to the party seeking disclosure, if to answer would place a
burden and expense upon the responding party which should be equitably borne by
the propounding party, or if the interrogatories as framed require the
disclosure of relevant as well as irrelevant matter, the trial court in the
exercise of its discretion may refuse to order such interrogatories
answered.  Id. at 19.
            The court
shall impose a monetary sanction under CCP section 2023.010 against any party,
person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a
further response to interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to
the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances
make the imposition of the sanction unjust. 
CCP §2031.310(d).
            
            D.
Statement of Facts
            1. Megeen’s Evidence
            a. Communications
History
            On
September 29, 2023, Megeen served Caltrans with her fifth set of RFPs.  Megeen Decl., ¶3, Ex. 1.  The RFPs included a request for the complete
parcel diary for the Property (“RFP No. 3”). 
Megeen Decl., ¶3, Ex. 1.  
            On October
30, 2023, Caltrans provided a response objecting to RFP No. 3 as overly broad,
unduly burdensome, oppressive, harassing, and irrelevant.  Megeen Decl., ¶4, Ex. 2.  Caltrans also argued that it infringed upon
the personal privacy rights of third parties and individuals as well as the
attorney-client privilege.  Megeen Decl.,
¶4, Ex. 2.  Without waiving this
objection, Caltrans asserted that it had already provided the unprivileged
requested documents in its possession, custody and control.  Megeen Decl., ¶4, Ex. 2.  
However, Caltrans had only provided the Property’s
parcel diary from November 7, 1990 to May 19, 1998, including one entry from
December 2, 1999.  Megeen Decl., ¶5, Ex. 3.  In contrast, Caltrans had previously produced
a parcel diary for 1113 Glendon Way, Los Angeles, CA 91030 (“1113 Glendon”) spanning
25 years.  Megeen Decl., ¶6, Ex. 4.[2]
            On
November 27, 2023, Megeen asked Caltrans about this discrepancy between the two
parcel diaries.  Megeen Decl., ¶6. 
Counsel for Caltrans, Paul Dipietro, Esq. (“Dipietro”), replied that he
would check for more documents.  Megeen
Decl., ¶7, Exs. 5-6.
            On
November 29, 2023, DiPietro sent Megeen additional documents.  Megeen Decl., ¶7, Exs. 5-6.  Those documents consisted only of excerpts
from 1113 Glendon’s parcel diary.  Megeen
Decl., ¶7.
            On
December 11, 2023, Megeen emailed DiPietro that she still needed the complete
parcel diary for the Property.  Megeen
Decl., ¶8, Ex. 7.  He replied the next
day that the Property’s diary already had been produced in response to earlier
RFPs.  Megeen Decl., ¶9, Ex. 8.  Megeen replied that the produced parcel diary
was only for 1991-1999 and read “Property Management Rental Account Diary.”  Megeen Decl., ¶10, Ex. 9.  She asked if DiPietro was suggesting that the
maintenance requests produced for the Property comprised the complete parcel
diary through 2023.  Megeen Decl., ¶10,
Ex. 9.
            Megeen
repeated this question on December 29, 2023, and January 2, 2024 because she
had received no response.  Megeen Decl.,
¶¶ 11-12, Exs. 10-11.  During a phone
call on January 5, DiPietro informed Megeen that Caltrans would look for additional
pages to the Property’s diary.  Megeen
Decl., ¶13.  To memorialize this, Megeen
emailed DiPietro to thank him for looking. 
Megeen Decl., ¶13, Ex. 12.  
            During a
phone call on January 26, 2024, DiPietro informed Megeen that he was still
looking for additional pages to the Property’s parcel diary but should finish
that search by the end of the week. 
Megeen Decl., ¶14, Ex. 13.  Megeen
emailed DiPietro to memorialize this conversation.  Megeen Decl., ¶14, Ex. 13.  DiPietro replied that he would not “keep
going back and forth” with further requests months after Caltrans’
responses.  Megeen Decl., ¶15, Ex. 14.  He accused Megeen of continually raising new
issues despite discovery being closed.  Megeen
Decl., ¶15, Ex. 14.  
            On
February 6, 2024, DiPietro sent Megeen one page of the Property’s parcel diary
dated March 17, 2016.  Megeen Decl., ¶16,
Exs. 15-16.  He asserted this was the
only page he had found.  Megeen Decl., ¶16,
Ex. 15.  Megeen thanked DiPietro for the
page but noted it was “miraculously” sent only after her trial brief was
due.  Megeen Decl., ¶17, Ex. 17.  It was even more miraculous given DiPietro’s
January 5, 2024 statement in a phone call that the State is not known for
keeping meticulous records.  Megeen
Decl., ¶17, Ex. 17.
            On
February 15, 2024, Megeen emailed DiPietro as an attempt to meet and confer
about the Property parcel diary.  Megeen
Decl., ¶18, Ex. 18.  She asked DiPietro
to explain why entries between January 2000 and March 2016 were still
missing.  Megeen Decl., ¶18, Ex. 18.
            On February
22, 2024, the court reopened discovery to allow for the motion to compel
scheduled for this hearing date, but it also ordered the parties to meet and
confer in person.  Megeen Decl., ¶19.  Megeen met DiPietro after the  hearing in the hallway, where he said his
team will look more thoroughly for missing pages of the Property parcel
diary.  Megeen Decl., ¶19.  He also said he would ask Caltrans if Megeen
could go in person to look for documents. 
Megeen Decl., ¶19.  DiPietro still
did not explain how Caltrans had found another page of the parcel diary after a
thorough search between June and October 2023.  Megeen Decl., ¶19.
 
            b. Merits
of the Search
            DiPietro
has asserted that parcel diaries are not kept when state-owned homes are
vacant.  Megeen Decl., ¶20.  This did not explain why, aside from one page
in March 2016, Caltrans has not produced any parcel diary pages for the Property
between 2015 and 2017.  Megeen Decl.,
¶20.  For comparison, Caltrans produced a
100-page parcel diary for 5512 Atlas, Los Angeles, CA 90032 (“Atlas Property”)
with entries from 1993.  Megeen Decl., ¶24,
Ex. 20.
            There have
been break-ins between Megeen’s displacement in 1999 and the completion of
renovations in 2014, and the parcel diary should reflect that.  Megeen Decl., ¶21.  At minimum, the parcel diary should reflect an
incident in Spring 2000, when the police contacted Megeen about break-ins at
the Property.  Megeen Decl., ¶22.  On the police’s advice, Megeen visited the Property
and inspected the interior with officers. 
Megeen Decl., ¶22.  No produced
diary pages correspond to this incident. 
Megeen Decl., ¶22.
            The parcel
diary should also reflect the Property’s use in June and July 2007 for
production of a remake of the movie “Halloween.”  Megeen Decl., ¶23, Ex. 19.  No produced diary pages correspond to this
fact.  Megeen Decl., ¶23.  
            Unlike
Caltrans, Megeen has cooperated with discovery efforts.  Megeen Decl., ¶24.  As a tenant in good standing, she only
refused to provide her financial records because they are irrelevant to the
case.  Megeen Decl., ¶24.  
            In
contrast, the parcel diary is relevant because it likely reflects Caltrans’
intent to return the Property to Megeen after renovations were complete.  Megeen Decl., ¶24.  It should also show that some renovations,
like those for the “Halloween” shoot, were not for move-in purposes.  Megeen Decl., ¶24.  That made it harder for Megeen to know when
the Property was renovated for move-in purposes unless Caltrans informed
her.  Megeen Decl., ¶24.  Other entries should show that Megeen entered
the Property interior with police officers because the neighborhood knew she
was to be relocated there after renovations. 
Megeen Decl., ¶24.  
 
            c. Sanctions
            Caltrans’
misuse of the discovery process has cost Megeen $60 in motion filing fees, $17 in
electronic filing fees, $104 to print 450 pages of courtesy copies for this
court, and $20 for parking.  Megeen
Decl., ¶25.  Her costs relevant to this
motion therefore total $201.  Megeen
Decl., ¶25.  
 
            2. Caltrans’ Evidence
            a. Parcel Diaries
            Parcel diaries are written by right-of-way agents assigned
to tenant-occupied properties.  Beckham
Decl., ¶7; Murdoch Decl., ¶5.  A diary
will not have entries when no tenant occupies the property.  Beckham Decl., ¶7; Murdoch Decl., ¶5.  Each diary will be different based on the
right-of-way agent assigned, and some are more meticulous than others.  Beckham Decl., ¶7; Murdoch Decl., ¶5.   
            The files for the Property date back to 1969.  DiPietro Decl., ¶14.  The Property was vacant from 1999 to 2014,
and from 2016 thereafter.  DiPietro
Decl., ¶13.  
 
            b. Course of Discovery 
            On July 3, 2023, Caltrans produced the Property parcel
diary and file to Megeen.  Megeen Decl.,
¶4.
            On September 7, 2023, the court set the original
discovery cutoff as November 22, 2023. 
DiPietro Decl., ¶3, Ex. A.  
            In October 2023, in order to comply with the RFPs,
Caltrans’ senior right-of-way agent reviewed the physical and electronic file
for the Property and all diaries found were produced.  Beckham Decl., ¶4; Murdoch Decl., ¶4.  This review was double-checked.  Beckham Decl., ¶6.
            On October 30, 2023, Caltrans responded to RFP No. 3.  DiPietro Decl., ¶5.  It objected that the request was overly
broad, unduly burdensome, oppressive, harassing, and irrelevant.  DiPietro Decl., ¶5.  Caltrans noted the request sought a
“complete” diary but did not define the word “complete.”  DiPietro Decl., ¶5.  It also argued it infringed upon the personal
privacy rights of third parties and individuals as well as the attorney-client
privilege.  DiPietro Decl., ¶5.  Without waiving this objection, Caltrans
asserted that it had already provided the unprivileged requested documents that
were in its possession, custody and control. 
DiPietro Decl., ¶5.  
            After the discovery deadline passed, Megeen repeatedly
contacted DiPietro demanding more documents or further discovery.  DiPietro Decl., ¶6.  She sometimes asserted that she never received
documents that had been produced.  DiPietro
Decl., ¶6.  As a sign of good faith, DiPietro
had Caltrans search for additional documents. 
DiPietro Decl., ¶7.  As a result,
Caltrans found and produced a single page with one entry for the Property’s
parcel diary.  DiPietro Decl., ¶7;
Beckham Decl., ¶5.  When Megeen commented
it was miraculous Caltrans only found this page after her trial brief was due, DiPietro
said Caltrans would not object if Megeen felt the need to supplement her brief
based on that page.  DiPietro Decl., ¶8, Ex. B. 
Megeen never supplemented the brief. 
DiPietro Decl., ¶8.
            On February 22, 2024, the court reopened discovery but
ordered that all discovery motions be preceded with face-to-face meet and
confer.   DiPietro Decl., ¶9, Ex. C.  After the hearing, DiPietro and Megeen met
outside the courtroom.  DiPietro Decl., ¶10.  DiPietro never promised to search for or
produce more documents.  DiPietro Decl.,
¶10.  Rather, he said Caltrans produced
the documents that had been found.  DiPietro
Decl., ¶10.  He added that it was
unlikely there would be any diaries for years when there were no Property tenants
because diaries only record interactions with leased properties and tenants.  DiPietro Decl., ¶10.  He had explained this to Megeen previously over
the phone.  DiPietro Decl., ¶10.  DiPietro said he would ask if the State would
allow her to physically inspect the documents, but he made no promises.  DiPietro Decl., ¶10.  During this meeting, Megeen did not discuss any
of Caltrans’ RFP objections.  DiPietro
Decl., ¶11.  This was the last
communication between the parties before Megeen filed the instant motion.  DiPietro Decl., ¶12.  
            
            c. Sanctions
            DiPietro received his J.D. in 2012.  DiPietro Decl., ¶16.  He spent the first five of those years as an
associate attorney at The Alvarez Firm, two more as an associate at another
firm, and joined Caltrans’ legal division in March 2020.  DiPietro Decl.,
¶16.  He has handled all facets of tort
and employment cases, from inception through trial, and either first-chaired or
second-chaired four jury/arbitration trials and three bench trials.  DiPietro Decl., ¶16.  
            DiPietro spent 7.5 hours drafting the opposition to this
motion and expects to spend one more hour at the hearing.  DiPietro Decl., ¶15.  Although he does not bill the State, he
estimates the reasonable value of his services given his experience is $600 per
hour.  DiPietro Decl., ¶¶ 16-17.  He reached this conclusion based on discussions
with attorneys who have more or a similar level of experience.  DiPietro Decl., ¶17.  This rate would make his fees for this motion
$600 x 8.5 = $5,100.  DiPietro Decl., ¶18.
 
            3. Reply Evidence
            a. Parked Cars
            Lawrence McGrail’s (“McGrail”) family occupies 1102
Glendon Way, South Pasadena, CA 91030 (“1102 Property”), which is next door to
the Property.  McGrail Decl., ¶¶ 2-3.  Since 2001, Caltrans right-of-way agents have
granted the McGrails permission to park their cars in the Property’s driveway
to make it look occupied.  McGrail Decl.,
¶7; Megeen Reply Decl., ¶3.  Megeen learned about this when the police
called her to the Property in mid-2000 to inspect the interior after
trespassing and vagrancy.  Megeen Reply
Decl., ¶3.
 
            b. Film Productions
            Film production crews have often used the Property’s
block.  Megeen Reply Decl., ¶6.  In the summer of 2007, neighbors told her the
Property had been involved in several productions since she vacated.  Megeen Reply Decl., ¶6.  This included the “Halloween” remake filmed
in 2007, for which the entire exterior was painted dark green and the upstairs
railing destroyed.  Megeen Reply Decl.,
¶6, Ex. 1.  Stills from the television
show “October Road,” filmed from 2007 to 2009, also show the house painted dark
green.  Megeen Reply Decl., ¶6, Ex. 2.  The house has not been repainted since.  McGrail Decl., ¶5.  
            As part of “October Road,” the production company also
installed a sprinkler system on the Property. 
McGrail Decl., ¶6.  Because
Caltrans turned off the water supply, this system was never functional.  McGrail Decl., ¶6.  
            The City has kept a complete list of productions on the Property’s
block.  Megeen Reply Decl., ¶5, Ex.
3.  Productions involving the Property
include several in 2002, three in 2007, one in 2009, two in 2009, and one in
September 2016.  Megeen Reply Decl., ¶5,
Ex. 3.  
 
            c. Parcel Diaries
            The Atlas Property’s parcel diary shows that the tenants
were moved to a temporary residence on July 28, 2020.  Megeen Reply Decl., ¶7, Ex. 4.  The diary continues to detail the renovations
through December 2020.  Megeen Reply
Decl., ¶7, Ex. 4.  This includes a
September 30 conversation where the displaced tenant asked the right of way
agent for help with an ARP application.   Megeen Reply Decl., ¶7, Ex. 4.  
 
            d. Meet and Confer
            After the hearing on February 22, 2024, Megeen and
DiPietro met and conferred in the hallway for 15 minutes.  Megeen Reply Decl., ¶7.  Megeen had already scheduled a motion to
compel hearing for March 28, 2024, and the focus was the Property’s parcel
diary.  Megeen Reply Decl., ¶7.  
            DiPietro said Caltrans had looked and was not able to
locate any more documents.  Megeen Reply
Decl., ¶8.  Looking for more documents would
be burdensome because they could be in several locations, albeit all in Los
Angeles and operated by Caltrans.  Megeen
Reply Decl., ¶8.  Megeen asked him to
look again because it made no sense to find one more page after a thorough
search in October 2023 did not yield it. 
Megeen Reply Decl., ¶8.  DiPietro said
he would ask his team to look again.  Megeen
Reply Decl., ¶8.  He also said he would ask
Caltrans if Megeen could go in person to conduct his own search.  Megeen Reply Decl., ¶8. 
            Megee never heard back from DiPietro, and it had taken 71
days to produce a single diary page.  Megeen
Reply Decl., ¶9.  With the deadline to
file a motion to compel looming, Megeen filed the instant motion to compel.  Megeen Reply Decl., ¶9.  On March 11, 2024, she asked DiPietro about
the search for missing pages in hopes of coming to an agreement that would
remove the motion from the calendar.  Megeen
Reply Decl., ¶10, Ex. 5.  DiPietro
replied that Megeen had filed the motion to compel, there was no reason to meet
and confer on any issue thereunder.  Megeen
Reply Decl., ¶10, Ex. 5.  
 
            D.
Analysis
            Petitioner
Megeen seeks to compel a further response to RFP No. 3, which sought the Property’s
parcel diary.  Megeen Decl., ¶3, Ex. 1. 

 
            1.
Meet and Confer
            A
motion to compel further responses must be accompanied by a meet and confer
declaration under CCP section 2016.040. 
CCP §2031.310(b)(2).  A meet and
confer declaration in support of a motion shall state facts showing a
reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal resolution of each issue
presented by the motion.  CCP §2016.040.
            When
the court reopened discovery, it ordered that any future motion to compel
further responses must follow in-person efforts to meet and confer.  DiPietro Decl., ¶9,
Ex. C.  Megeen asserts that when
she spoke to Caltrans’ counsel DiPietro after that hearing, he said his team will look more thoroughly for missing pages of the
Property parcel diary.  Megeen Decl.,
¶19.  DiPietro denies saying so.  He asserts that he said Caltrans had already
produced the documents that had been found, and that it was unlikely there were
any more.  DiPietro Decl., ¶10.  The parties agree that DiPietro said he would
ask Caltrans if Megeen could go in person to look for documents.  Megeen Decl., ¶19; DiPietro Decl., ¶10.  Megeen does not deny that she failed to raise
Caltrans’ objections to RFP No. 3 in this meet and confer.  DiPietro Decl., ¶12.  
Caltrans
argues that Megeen failed to meet and confer over the State’s objections to the
RFP as the court ordered.  Opp. at
4.  This is true.  Megeen appears to have assumed in the meet
and confer that Caltrans intended to comply, but procedurally it had preserved
its objections and Megeen was required to address them in the meet and confer.[3]  
             Despite this
failure, the court will not deny the motion on the ground that Megeen failed to
properly comply with meet and confer requirements.
 
2. Timeliness
            Unless
notice of a motion to compel further responses is given within 45 days of the
service of the response, or any supplemental response, or on or before any
later date to which the propounding and responding parties have agreed in
writing, the propounding party waives any right to compel further response to the
requests for production.  CCP §2031.310(c).  
            The 45-day
time limit within which to file and serve a motion to compel further responses
is mandatory and quasi-jurisdictional in the sense that the court has no
authority to rule on a late motion other than to deny it.  Sexton v. Superior Court, (1997) 58
Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410 (oral objection at hearing where opposition failed to
raise timeliness issue was sufficient because court has jurisdiction only to
deny untimely motion); New Albertsons, Inc. v. Superior Court, (2008)
168 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1427-28 (missing deadline waives the right to compel a
further response).
            Caltrans
provided its responses to RFP No. 3 on October 30,
2023.  Megeen Decl., ¶4, Ex. 2.  As a result, the 45-day period to file and
serve a motion to compel ended on December 18, 2023.  Caltrans asserts that Megeen filed
this motion long after the December 18, 2023 deadline.  Opp. at 3. 

Megeen argues that that the 45-day
deadline runs from when DiPietro produced one additional parcel diary page on
February 6, 2024.  Megeen Decl., ¶16,
Exs. 15-16.  Reply at 8.
            Megeen
is confusing Caltrans’ informal effort to provide additional documents with her
statutory duty to meet a deadline.  Caltrans’
October 30, 2023 complied with its duties to respond to the RFPs under CCP section
2031.250(c).   Megeen Decl., ¶4, Ex. 2. 
            A
supplemental verified response will extend the 45-day period.  CCP §2031.310(c).  Diepietro’s February 6, 2024 email providing one page of the Property’s parcel diary (Megeen
Decl., Ex. 15) may have complied with a continuing duty to act in good faith
but it was not a supplemental verified response.  If Megeen wanted to preserve her right to make
a motion to compel while urging Caltrans to keep searching, she was obligated
to obtain Caltrans’ agreement in writing extending the 45-day deadline.   CCP §2013.31(c).  She did not do so and the motion is denied as
untimely.[4]
 
            3. Sanctions
            The
court shall impose a monetary sanction under CCP section 2023.010 against any
party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to
compel a further response to interrogatories, unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.  CCP §2031.310(d).  Further, notwithstanding the outcome of the
particular discovery motion, the court shall impose a monetary sanction
ordering that any party or attorney who fails to confer as required pay the
reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees, incurred by anyone as a result
of that conduct.  CCP §2023.020.
            Caltrans
requests a $5,100 sanction based on the attorney’s fees incurred opposing this
motion.  DiPietro
Decl., ¶¶ 15-18.  Opp. at 7.  
Megeen argues that sanctions are inappropriate
when DiPietro dismissed her attempts to come to some sort of agreement that
would obviate this motion.  Reply at
9.  Megeen’s good faith in seeking diary
pages does not bear significantly on whether sanctions should be awarded when
she filed an untimely motion.  But see
post.
            Megeen argues that the court should not award DiPietro
attorney’s fees for opposing this motion as if the State did not already employ
him to do so.  Reply at 9.  This argument improperly shifts the focus of
a sanctions analysis.  The purpose of
sanctions is not to compensate the opposing party, it is to penalize the
sanctioned party for not acting with substantial justification.  She did not act with substantial
justification.  
Megeen also argues that DiPietro
cannot justify the claimed hourly rate of $600 for his services.  He provides no proof that he ever made this
much as an associate attorney.  Reply at
9.  The determining factor is not DiPietro’s
hourly rate when he was an associate attorney. 
It is whether $600 is a reasonable hourly rate for this motion based on
his legal experience.  DiPietro Decl.,
¶16.  DiPietro based
his estimate on discussions with attorneys who have more or a similar level of
experience.  DiPietro Decl., ¶17.  His rate is reasonable.
            Although
DiPietro requests a sanction of $5,100, the court declines to impose that
amount.   This is in part because Megeen’s
motion is obviously untimely and little effort was required to demonstrate that
fact.  Additionally, Megeen acted in good
faith and, as a pro per, was unfamiliar with procedural
requirements.  A sanction is mandatory
because she did not act with substantial justification, but only a $400
sanction is imposed.
 
            E.
Conclusion
            The
motion to compel further responses is denied. 
Sanctions of $400 are imposed against Megeen, payable within 30 days and
collectible as a judgment.
