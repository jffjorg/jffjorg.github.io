Case Number: 23STCP00841
Hearing Date: March 28, 2024
Dept: 85
Plaintiff: Timothy Ryan, M.D.
Defendant: County of Los Angeles

 Intentions:
  - Petitioner seeks a writ of traditional mandate directing Respondent to provide public records responsive to his requests under the California Public Records Act (CPRA).
  - Petitioner also seeks declaratory relief, holding that the County violated the CPRA when it failed to disclose documents responsive to his requests.
  - Petitioner asks the court to order the disclosure of documents responsive to all of his requests, or to conduct an in-camera review of the requested records to determine which should be disclosed.

 Facts:
  - Timothy Ryan, M.D. was employed at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center as a vascular surgeon from 2013 to 2018.
  - Ryan filed complaints with the County Intake Specialist Unit (CISU) in April and November 2015, alleging retaliation.
  - Ryan also filed a third-party complaint with CISU in 2018, alleging retaliation.
  - The County conducted an external investigation into Ryan's complaints and found that the allegations were unsubstantiated.
  - Ryan made several requests under the CPRA for documents related to his complaints, including requests for documents related to the County's investigation, the County's response to his requests, and documents related to the theft of controlled substances at Harbor-UCLA.

 Disputes:
  - The County denies Ryan's requests, citing various exemptions under the CPRA, including the attorney-client privilege, the attorney work-product doctrine, and the official information privilege.
  - Ryan disputes the County's rationale for denying his requests, arguing that the exemptions do not apply and that the public interest in disclosure outweighs the interests in non-disclosure.
