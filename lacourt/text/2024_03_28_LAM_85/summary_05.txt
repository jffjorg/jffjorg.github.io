And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion to substitute Kelly Mako, as trustee and representative of the Mako Family Trust, for Zoltan Mako, who died on December 21, 2022. Zoltan was a Petitioner in the case, along with other employees of the Los Angeles Police Department, against the City of Los Angeles and Matt Szabo. The case alleges breach of contract, declaratory relief, injunctive relief, and traditional mandamus, and seeks damages and attorney's fees.

The Judge has found that Kelly is authorized to act on behalf of the Trust and Zoltan's successor-in-interest, and that there is no superior right to do so. The motion is unopposed.

The case will continue with Kelly as the representative of the Trust, and the parties will proceed with discovery and other proceedings.
