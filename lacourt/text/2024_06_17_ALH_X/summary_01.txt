And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has tentatively granted the defendants' motion for attorney's fees in the amount of $83,594.00. The defendants seek attorney's fees for their work on the lawsuit, which was filed on August 1, 2022. The defendants' counsel claim to have spent 186.2 hours on the matter, at hourly rates ranging from $495.00 to $610.00 per hour. The court reduced the amount of attorney's fees sought by $1,138.50 due to block billing and unclear descriptions of work done. The court also struck an entry on the billing records for trial preparation and summary judgment. The court granted the defendants' motion for attorney's fees, finding that the defendants are the prevailing party in the lawsuit.
