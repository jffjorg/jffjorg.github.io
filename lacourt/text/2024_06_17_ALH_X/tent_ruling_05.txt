RELIEF
REQUESTED 
 
             Defendant MPRP, Tract 3, LLC (erroneously
sued and served as Property Owners of 4000 Market Place Dr., 1A Monterrey Park,
CA 91755) moves for an order compelling Plaintiff Gina Lizano to provide
responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One, for monetary sanctions in the
amount of $960.00, and/or for terminating sanctions.
 
BACKGROUND
 
             This case arises out of Plaintiff Gina
Lizano’s slip and fall at the location of 4000 Market Place Dr. 1A, Monterrey
Park, CA 91744. Plaintiff filed this complaint on March 21, 2023.
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
            The motion to compel Plaintiff’s responses to Special
Interrogatories, Set One, is GRANTED. Plaintiff is ordered to provide verified,
code-compliant responses without objections to Special Interrogatories, Set
One, within 20 days of the Court’s order. Plaintiff and her counsel of record
must pay additional monetary sanctions in the amount of $810.00 to Defendant
within 20 days of the Court’s order.
 
LEGAL STANDARD 
 
“Section 2023.030¿authorizes a trial court to impose monetary
sanctions, issue sanctions, evidence sanctions, or terminating sanctions
against ‘anyone engaging in conduct that is a misuse of the discovery process.’
” (Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th
967, 991.) “The
discovery statutes evince an incremental approach to discovery sanctions,
starting with monetary sanctions and ending with the ultimate sanction of
termination.” (Id. at p. 992.) 
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030, subdivision
(d) provides that a court may impose terminating sanctions by one of the
following orders: “(1) An order striking out the pleadings or parts of the
pleadings of any party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process. [¶] (2)
An order staying further proceedings by that party until an order for discovery
is obeyed. [¶] (3) An order dismissing the action, or any part of the action,
of that party. [¶] (4) An order rendering a judgment by default against that
party.” 
 
“A decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made
lightly. But where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and
the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance
with¿the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate
sanction.” (Mileikowsky v. Tenent Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th
262, 279-280 (“Mileikowsky”).)  
 
DISCUSSION
 
             Defendant MPRP, Tract 3, LLC
(erroneously sued and served as Property Owners of 4000 Market Place Dr., 1A
Monterrey Park, CA 91755) (“Defendant”) moves for an order compelling Plaintiff
Gina Lizano (“Plaintiff”) to provide responses to Special Interrogatories, Set
One, for monetary sanctions in the amount of $960.00, and/or for terminating
sanctions. Defendant indicates having served Special Interrogatories, Set One,
on Plaintiff on August 29, 2023. (Black Decl., ¶ 6, Ex. 2.) After receiving no
responses, Defendant moved for an order compelling responses, which the Court
granted on February 7, 2024, ordering Plaintiff to provide responses within 20
days and to pay Defendant monetary sanctions in the amount of $630.00. (Id.,
¶ 8, Ex. 3.) Defendant states that Plaintiff still has not provided any
responses, nor has Plaintiff paid the monetary sanctions she was ordered to
pay. (Id., ¶ 9.)
 
The Court finds
that Defendant’s request for an order compelling responses is well taken.
Defendant has made it clear that Plaintiff still has failed to provide
responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One, and to pay the $630.00 in
monetary sanctions per the Court’s order on February 7, 2024. (Black Decl., ¶
9.) Plaintiff also failed to oppose this motion, which the Court construes as a
tacit admission that Defendant’s motion is meritorious. (Sexton v. Superior
Court (1997)
58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410; C. Opposing the Motion—and Rebutting the Opposition,
Cal. Prac. Guide Civ. Pro. Before Trial Ch. 9(I)-C, ¶ 9:105.10.) The Court
therefore GRANTS Defendant’s motion, and again orders Plaintiff to provide
responses within 20 days of this order.
 
            The Court further GRANTS Defendant’s
request for monetary sanctions in the reduced amount of $810.00, comprised of
2.0 hours preparing the motion and supporting declaration and 0.5 hours for
appearing at the hearing the motion, for a total of 2.5 hours, multiplied by
the hourly rate of $300.00, plus $60.00 for the filing fee. These monetary
sanctions are in addition to the $630.00 the Court previously ordered on
February 7, 2024.
 
As for terminating sanctions, the Court recognizes that
thus far Plaintiff has been dilatory in providing responses to Defendant’s
discovery requests. However, Plaintiff has failed to comply with one court
order to provide discovery responses and pay sanctions. One failure to comply with
a court order, while sufficient to support the imposition of other types of
sanctions, is not a violation that is “preceded by a history of abuse”. (Mileikowsky,
supra, 128 Cal.App.4th at p. 279.) Further, Defendant has not shown that
Plaintiff’s failure to comply was done willfully as opposed to negligently.
Defendant provided no evidence of having attempted to meet and confer before
bringing this motion. (See Black Decl., ¶ 9.) Defendant also provided no
evidence to establish that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance.
Simply stated, terminating sanctions is too drastic a measure at this time.
Thus, Defendant’s motion for terminating sanctions is denied. 
 
Additionally, Defendant did not alternatively request issue or
evidentiary sanctions, or provide a separate statement in support of such. (See
Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345, subd. (a)(7).)
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion to compel Plaintiff’s responses to Special
Interrogatories, Set One, is GRANTED. Plaintiff is ordered to provide verified,
code-compliant responses without objections to Special Interrogatories, Set
One, within 20 days of the Court’s order. Plaintiff and her counsel of record
must pay additional monetary sanctions in the amount of $810.00 to Defendant
within 20 days of the Court’s order.
