Defendant objects to the first and

BACKGROUND
 
On October 30, 2023, Plaintiff Nidal
Oudeh (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Defendants Huang Chen (“Chen”), Yu
Jiayang (“Jiayang”), and DOES 1-20, (collectively “Defendants”) for: (1) motor
vehicle negligence, and (2) general negligence.
 
Plaintiff alleges that on September
1, 2021, Defendants Chen and Jiayang negligently operated their vehicles in the
scope of their employment, causing their vehicles to collide with Plaintiff’s
vehicle on S. Ramona Ave. 345ft North of Nemark Ave., Monterrey Park, CA 91754.
(Compl., ¶¶ MV-1, GN-1.) 
 
            On January
22, 2024, Defendant Chen filed a demurrer. 
 
To date, no opposition has been
filed.
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
Defendant’s demurrer to all causes of action is SUSTAINED.
 
 
LEGAL STANDARD
 
A
general demurrer may be taken to a complaint where “[t]he pleading does not
state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.” (Code of Civ.
Proc. § 430.10(e).) A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the
complaint states a cause of action.  (Hahn
v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal. App. 4th 740, 747.) In a demurrer proceeding, the
defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or by proper judicial
notice.  (Code Civ. Proc. section
430.30(a).)  A demurrer tests the
pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters.  (SKF Farms v. Superior Court (1984)
153 Cal. App. 3d 902, 905.)  The only
issue involved in a demurrer hearing is whether the complaint, as it stands,
unconnected with extraneous matters, states a cause of action.  (Hahn v. Mirda, supra, 147 Cal.App.4th
740, 747.)
 
Meet and Confer 
 
Before filing a demurrer, the moving
party must meet and confer in person or by telephone with the party who filed
the pleading to attempt to reach an agreement that would resolve the objections
to the pleading and obviate the need for filing the demurrer.  (C.C.P.
§430.41.)  
Defendant’s counsel, Michelle C.
Marder of Farmers Insurance Exchange, and Affiliates states that on January 18,
2024, she met and conferred telephonically with Plaintiff’s counsel regarding
the instant motion, and it was left that Marder’s office would file the instant
Demurrer. (Marder Decl., ¶ 3.) Defendant’s declaration demonstrates a good
faith effort to resolve the issues in the instant motion out of court. 
Therefore, Defendant’s demurrer is proper. 
 
DISCUSSION
 
Defendant claims that Plaintiff’s
complaint is untimely because it was not filed within the two-year statute of
limitation for personal injury claims. (Demurrer, p. 4, 5.) 
The proper statute of limitations,
per the California Code of Civil Procedure is within two years an action for
assault, battery, or injury to, or for the death of, an individual caused by
the wrongful act or neglect of another. (C.C.P., § 335.1)
 
            Defendant
argues that Plaintiff fails to state a claim to support the first and section
cause of action for Motor Vehicle and General Negligence injuries suffered on
September 1, 2021. (Demurrer, pp. 3-5.) Defendant argues that Plaintiff’s complaint
was untimely filed on October 30, 2023, and it should have been filed by September
1, 2023. (Demurrer, pp. 4, 5.) By initiating this action on October 30, 2023,
Defendant argues that Plaintiff is precluded from further litigation on the
issue of personal injury. (Demurrer, p. 5.)
 
Defendant’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s first cause of action for motor
vehicle negligence pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10,
subdivision (e) is sustained. (c)(1) 
 
Defendant also argues that
Plaintiff’s complaint for property damages remains viable. (Demurrer, p. 5.) 
The proper statute of limitations
for an action for taking, detaining, or injuring goods or chattels, including
an action for the specific recovery of personal property is three years.
(C.C.P. § 338). 
Plaintiff’s complaint also asserts
recovery for property damage arising from the September 1, 2023, motor vehicle
collision. Under the statute of limitations, Plaintiff’s October 30, 2023,
complaint including this claim remains timely filed.
 
 
CONCLUSION
 
Defendants’ demurrer to
Plaintiff’s first cause of action for motor vehicle negligence is SUSTAINED
WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND.
 
Defendants’ demurrer to
Plaintiff’s second cause of action for general negligence is SUSTAINED WITHOUT
LEAVE TO AMEND.
 
Moving Party to give notice
and prepare judgment.
