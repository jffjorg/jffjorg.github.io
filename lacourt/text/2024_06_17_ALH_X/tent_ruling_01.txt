            Defendants move for

BACKGROUND
 
             This case arises out of Plaintiff Asian Youth Center’s (“Plaintiff”)
unlawful detainer claim against Defendants Kristo Holdings, LLC and Hranush
Mkrtchyan (collectively, “Defendants”). Plaintiff alleged that Defendants
agreed to a 5-year lease term for property located at 232 W. Clary Ave., City
of San Gabriel, CA 91776. Plaintiff alleged that Defendants agreed to pay $7,364.00
per month. Plaintiff sued on August 1, 2022.
 
            On January
11, 2024, following a trial, a jury reached a verdict in favor of Defendants
and against Plaintiff. On January 25, 2024, judgment was entered.
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
Defendants’
motion for attorney’s fees is tentatively GRANTED in the reduced amount of
$93,494.00. The court further directs Defendants to submit a revised proposed
judgment for the court’s review and signature to address the clerical error
noted herein.
 
LEGAL STANDARD
 
            “In any action on a contract, where the contract specifically provides
that attorney's fees and costs, which are incurred to enforce that
contract, shall be awarded either to one of the parties or to the prevailing
party, then the party who is determined to be the party prevailing on the contract, whether he or she is the party specified
in the contract or not, shall be entitled to reasonable attorney's fees in
addition to other costs.” (Civ. Code, § 1717, subd. (a).)
 
EVIDENTIARY OBJECTIONS
 
            The court OVERRULES
Defendants’ evidentiary objections, as the court does not rely on the portions
objected to in reaching its decision herein. 
 
DISCUSSION
 
            On January 11, 2024, a jury reached
a verdict in favor of Defendants and against Plaintiff. On January 25, 2024,
judgment was entered in favor of Defendants and against Plaintiff on the
Complaint.
 
Paragraph 31 of the agreement at issue in this case
provides: “If any Party or Broker brings an action or proceeding involving the
Premises whether founded in tort, contract or equity, or to declare rights hereunder,
the Prevailing Party (as hereafter defined) in any such proceeding, action, or
appeal thereon, shall be entitled to reasonable attorneys’ fees. Such fees may
be awarded in the same suit or recovered in a separate suit, whether or not
such action or proceeding is pursued to decision or judgment. The term, ‘Prevailing
Party’ shall include, without limitation, a Party or Broker who substantially
obtains or defeats the relief sought, as the case may be, whether by
compromise, settlement, judgment, or the abandonment by the other Party or
Broker of its claim or defense.” (Compl., Ex. 1, ¶ 31.)
 
Defendants now move for attorney’s fees totaling $95,523.50. 
 
            “[T]he fee setting inquiry in
California ordinarily begins with the ‘lodestar,’ i.e., the number of hours
reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate.” (PLCM Group
v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095.) “The reasonable hourly rate is
that prevailing in the community for similar work.” (Ibid.) Once the
lodestar figure is calculated, a court may adjust the award based on factors
such as “(1) the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, (2) the
skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the extent to which the nature of the
litigation precluded other employment by the attorneys, (4) the contingent
nature of the fee award.” (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122,
1132.) “The purpose of such adjustment is to fix a fee at the fair market value
for the particular action.” (Ibid.) 
 
            Defendants
seek fees at the following rates: $495.00 per hour for Kevin T. Kay, $610.00
per hour for Lawrence C. Ecoff, and $550.00 per hour for Alberto J. Campain. (Kay
Decl., ¶ 13; Ecoff Decl., ¶ 3; Campain Decl., ¶ 4.)[1] Defendants claim to have spent 186.2 hours on this matter.
(Kay Decl., ¶ 9.) Defendants also indicate having spent five hours preparing
this motion, and estimated incurring three hours for reviewing the opposition
and preparing a reply. (Kay Decl., ¶ 13.) 
The court will reduce this number of hours to 166.2 hours.
 
            “The
courts repeatedly have stated that the trial court is in the best position to
value the services rendered by the attorneys in his or her courtroom
[citation], and this includes the determination of the hourly rate that will be
used in the lodestar calculus. [Citation.]” (569 E. Cnty. Boulevard LLC v.
Backcountry Against the Dump, Inc. (2016) 6 Cal.App.5th 426, 436-437.)
 
            The court finds the hourly rates of
Defendants’ counsel to be reasonable here, particularly since Kevin Kay, who
has the lowest rate of the three attorneys involved, did the majority of the
work. While the court understands Plaintiff’s argument that the rates in the
San Gabriel Valley might be lower on average than those in Beverly Hills where
Defendants’ counsel is located, the rates they have claimed here are not unusual
for this legal community either. Defendants were free to choose the counsel of
their choice, and the fact their counsel was located in Beverly Hills versus
the San Gabriel Valley is ultimately of no importance. The court also finds
Plaintiff’s contention that the rates for Kevin Kay inexplicably increased in
the middle of this action to be unavailing. It is not unusual for rates to
increase overtime while a lawsuit is pending, particularly in a lawsuit like
this that has been pending for almost two years at this point. Also, the amount
of the increase, $45.00, is not unreasonable.
 
“In
challenging attorney fees as excessive because too many hours of work are
claimed, it is the burden of the challenging party to point to the specific
items challenged, with a sufficient argument and citations to the evidence.
General arguments that fees claimed are excessive, duplicative, or unrelated do
not suffice. Failure to raise specific challenges in the trial court forfeits
the claim on appeal.” (Premier Medical Management Systems, Inc. v.
California Ins. Guarantee Assn. (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 550, 564.) 
 
            The court agrees
with Plaintiff that the entry on July 26, 2023, regarding “Attention to Motion
for Summary Judgment; trial preparation” is improperly lumped together, i.e.,
block billing. Trial preparation and summary judgment are two different
matters, and it is impossible for the court to determine how much effort was
devoted to each task with this entry. “Trial
courts retain discretion to penalize block billing when the practice prevents
them from discerning which tasks are compensable and which are not.
[Citation.]” (Heritage Pac. Fin., LLC v. Monroy (2013) 215 Cal.App.4th
972, 1010.) The court also finds the description “Attention to” to be unclear as
to what that even means, and the description “trial preparation” to be vague.
Accordingly, the court will strike this entry and reduce the amount of
attorney’s fees sought by $891.00, i.e., 1.80 hours multiplied by $495.00 per
hour. (See Kay Decl., Ex. B, p. 43.)
 
 
The court also agrees that it is not reasonable to recover
for discovery demands served after the expiration of the discovery cutoff.
(Sawkins Decl., ¶ 13, Ex. 3.) The court will reduce the fee request by
$1,138.50, i.e., 2.3 hours multiplied by $495.00 per hour, for the entries on
September 18, 2023 and October 5, 2023. (Kay Decl., Ex. B, p. 45.)
 
            The court finds Plaintiff’s other
arguments regarding unsuccessful motions or special jury instructions to be
unavailing. Plaintiff cites no authority to support the contention that any of
these fees should be stricken. (See Opp., pp. 4-5.) “Contentions are waived
when a party fails to support them with reasoned argument and citations to
authority. [Citation.]” (Moulton Niguel Water Dist. v.
Colombo (2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 1210, 1215.) Moreover, just because a
party does not prevail on a motion or an underlying matter does not mean it is
unrecoverable for purposes of attorney’s fees. (See Ketchum v. Moses, supra,
24 Cal.4th at p. 1133, italics in original [“an attorney fee award should
include compensation for all the hours reasonably spent…”].)
 
            The court
also finds Plaintiff’s argument regarding the sanctions previously awarded in
connection with the discovery motions unavailing. Plaintiff neither cites any
authority in support of this argument, (Moulton Niguel Water Dist. v.
Colombo, supra, 111 Cal.App.4th at
p. 1215), nor does Plaintiff point to the specific items in the billing to be
challenged, (Premier Medical
Management Systems, Inc. v. California Ins. Guarantee Assn. (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 550, 564.) The court declines
to guess which portions of the billing Plaintiff attempts to challenge here.
 
            As for the
language in the judgment indicating that “Plaintiffs are entitled to an award
of reasonable attorney’s fees…”, (Judgment (1/25/24), the court agrees with
Defendants that this was a clerical error. The judgment clearly states that it
was entered in favor of Defendants, which necessarily renders them the
prevailing party in this action. (See Id.; Civ. Code, §1717,
subd. (a).) The court will therefore amend the judgment to correctly reflect
that Defendants are in fact the parties entitled to attorney’s fees. (See Code
Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (d).) The court will direct Defendants to submit
a revised proposed judgment reflecting the correction.
 
            Based on
the foregoing, the court GRANTS Defendants’ motion for attorney’s fees in the
reduced amount of $83,594.00.
 
CONCLUSION
 
Defendants’
motion for attorney’s fees is tentatively GRANTED in the reduced amount of $83,594.00.
The court further directs Defendants to submit a revised proposed judgment for
the court’s review and signature to address the clerical error noted herein.
