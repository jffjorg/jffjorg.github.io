English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling denies the defendant's motion to compel arbitration. The defendant sought to compel arbitration of the plaintiff's lemon law claim, but the court finds that the arbitration provision in the Retail Installment Sale Contract is not enforceable. The court concludes that the plaintiff's claims are not intertwined with the Agreement, and therefore, the defendant's motion to compel arbitration is denied. The court also rejects the defendant's argument that it is a third-party beneficiary of the Agreement and that equitable estoppel should apply to allow it to enforce the Agreement.
