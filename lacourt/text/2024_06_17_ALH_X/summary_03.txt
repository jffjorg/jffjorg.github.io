And here is the English summary:

This tentative ruling is the result of a motion to relieve counsel filed by Kenneth D. Sisco, the attorney for defendant Jian Jun Liu, due to health issues that have significantly deteriorated over the past few years. Sisco's health problems, including heart attacks and neuropathy, render him unable to properly prepare for trial and competently represent his client. The court finds that this is proper grounds for withdrawal under California Rules of Professional Conduct Rule 1.16. However, the court notes several procedural errors in Sisco's motion, including failure to file a proposed order and provide a declaration stating that the defendant's electronic service address is his current address. The court tentatively denies the motion to relieve counsel without prejudice.
