[1] The court
notes that the declaration of Alberto J. Campaign indicates an hourly rate of
$525.00, (Campain Decl., ¶ 4), while the moving papers indicate a rate of
$550.00 per hour, (Motion, 10). The court infers that Mr. Campain’s hourly rate
was $550.00 based on some of the billing entries reflecting that rate. (Kay
Decl., Ex. B, p. 43.)
