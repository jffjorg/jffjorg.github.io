And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiffs' motion to compel further responses to requests for production. The defendants, American Honda Motor Co., had responded to the requests with objections, but the judge has found these objections to be without merit. The judge has ordered the defendants to provide verified, code-compliant responses to the requests without objections within 30 days of the order. The judge has also found that the plaintiffs have shown good cause for their requests for production, including documents relating to the subject vehicle, internal knowledge and investigation, summary documents and deposition testimony, policies and procedures, and communications with agencies and suppliers.
