CASE:                         Jessica Castillo v. County of Los
Angeles
 
CASE NO.:                 23STCV00176            
 
MOTION
TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES; REQUEST FOR SANCTIONS

 
MOVING PARTY:               Plaintiff Jessica Castillo
 
RESPONDING PARTY(S): Defendant County
of Los Angeles
 
STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is an employment discrimination action that was filed on January 4,
2023. Plaintiff alleges that she was denied benefits and promotions and
disproportionately assigned field work as a nurse throughout 2020 on the basis
of her race. 
 
Plaintiff moves to compel further
responses to requests for production, and for sanctions. 
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel
Further Responses to Requests for Production is DENIED as to requests Nos. 58,
59, and 61-63 and otherwise MOOT.
 
Both parties’ requests for
sanctions are DENIED. 
 
DISCUSSION:
 
Plaintiff moves to compel further
responses to requests for production, and for sanctions. 
 
Legal Standard
 
Under Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.310, subdivision (a), a court
may order a party to serve a further response to a demand for inspection when
the court finds that: “(1) A statement of compliance with the demand is
incomplete[;] (2) A representation of inability to comply is inadequate,
incomplete, or evasive[; or] (3) An objection in the response is without merit
or too general.”
 
The burden is on the moving party to “set forth specific facts showing
good cause justifying the discovery sought by the demand.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.310, subd. (b)(1).) These facts must also be set forth in a separate
statement filed by the moving party. (Cal. Rules of Court Rule 3.1345(c).) This
burden “is met simply by a fact-specific showing of relevance.” (TBG Ins.
Servs. Corp. v. Superior Court (2002) 96 Cal.App.4th 443, 448.)
 
Analysis
 
            Plaintiff initially
moved to compel further responses to requests for production Nos. 34, 35, 38,
39, 42, 43, 58, 59, and 61-63. However, since this motion was filed, Plaintiff
states that Defendant has provided satisfactory supplemental responses to all
requests save Nos. 58, 59, and 61-63. 
 
As to the remaining responses, a
motion to compel further response to a demand for production must be served
“within 45 days of the service of the verified response, or any supplemental
verified response, or on or before any specific later date to which the
propounding party and the responding party have agreed in writing.” (Code Civ.
Proc. § 2031.310(c).) The 45-day requirement is mandatory and
jurisdictional. (Sexton v. Superior Court¿(1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403,
1410.) The parties agree that Defendant served initial responses on November
27, 2023, and that the parties agreed in writing to extend the deadline to
compel further responses to January 30, 2024. (Declaration of Jessica M.
Neighbors ISO Opp. Exhs. C-D.) The parties also agree that Defendant provided
supplemental responses to other requests on January 25, 2024, but not to
requests Nos. 58, 59, 61, 62, and 63. (Neighbors Decl. Exh. E.) Since no
supplemental response was provided to any of the remaining requests at issue
and there was no subsequent agreement to further extend the date to compel
responses, the deadline to compel further responses to those requests remained
January 30, 2024. This motion was filed on March 12, 2024 and is therefore
untimely as to the remaining requests. 
 
Sanctions
 
            Both
parties request sanctions against their counterpart and opposing counsel for
bringing or necessitating this motion. Although the Court might entertain a
request for sanctions when the opposing party provides supplemental responses
after the motion is brought, the Court declines to impose sanctions where the
motion is untimely brought as to a subset of the requests to which it pertains.

 
//
 
CONCLUSION:

 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel
Further Responses to Requests for Production is DENIED as to requests Nos. 58,
59, and 61-63 and otherwise MOOT.
 
Both parties’ requests for
sanctions are DENIED. 
 
Moving Party to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
