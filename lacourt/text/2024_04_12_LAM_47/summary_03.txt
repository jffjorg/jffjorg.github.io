And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling denies Plaintiff Jessica Castillo's motion to compel further responses to certain requests for production. The motion was filed late and the court finds that the Plaintiff did not meet the burden of showing good cause for the discovery sought. The court also denies both parties' requests for sanctions. The court finds that the Plaintiff's motion was untimely brought as to certain requests, and therefore does not meet the requirements for compelling further responses.
