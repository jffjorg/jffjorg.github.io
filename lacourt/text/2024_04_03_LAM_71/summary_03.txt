```
And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants Plaintiff's unopposed motion for terminating sanctions against Defendant Dan Kloss. The judge finds that Defendant has willfully disobeyed multiple discovery orders, including failing to respond to discovery requests, failing to produce responsive documents, and failing to appear at deposition. As a result, the judge strikes Defendant's Answer and renders a default against Defendant.

The judge also grants Plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions against Defendant in the reduced amount of $1,650.00. The judge reduces the amount of the sanction because the judge finds that Plaintiff's counsel's hourly rate of $550.00 per hour is reasonable, but the preparation of the motion should not have taken longer than 2 hours.

The judge vacates the Final Status Conference set for September 20, 2024, and the Jury Trial set for September 30, 2024.
