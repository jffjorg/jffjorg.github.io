Plaintiff Wesley
Robbins (“Robbins”) (“Plaintiff”), in pro per, moves unopposed
for an order deeming admitted pro per Defendant David Cobb’s (“Cobb”)
(“Defendant”) responses to Plaintiff’s Request for Admissions (Set One)
(“RFA”).  (Notice of Motion, pgs. 1-2;
C.C.P. §§2023.010 et seq., 2033.280.)  Plaintiff also requests an award of sanctions against Cobb in the
amount of $1,975.00.  (Notice of Motion,

Motion to Deem RFAs Admitted
Having reviewed Plaintiff’s unopposed
Motion to Deem Requests for Admission Admitted, the Court rules as follows.
          On October 25, 2023, Plaintiff served RFA on Cobb by email
to dcobb0530@gmail.com.  (Decl. of Robbins
¶2, Exh. A.)  Responses were due on or
before November 27, 2023.  Cobb has
failed to provide timely responses.  Plaintiff
now moves the Court to deem the requests for admission admitted.  
          The Court grants the motion pursuant to C.C.P. §2033.280
and deems the requests to be admitted.
Plaintiff requests monetary
sanctions totaling $1,975.00.  
          The Court awards sanctions pursuant to C.C.P. §2033.280(c) in
the amount of $1,170.00, calculated as follows:
$1,000 for preparation and service of motion + $150.00 for
transportation cots to and from court + $20.00 for home utilities and equipment
= $1,170.00
The sanctions are payable by
Cobb within 20 days of this order.
 
          Conclusion
Plaintiff’s unopposed
motion to deem admitted Defendant Cobb’s responses to the RFAs is granted.
Plaintiff’s request for
monetary sanctions is granted in the reduced total amount of $1,170.00
against Defendant Cobb.  Sanctions are
payable within 20 days.
Moving Party is to
give notice of this ruling.
