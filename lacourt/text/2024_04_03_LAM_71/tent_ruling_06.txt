Defendant Caesarstone USA, Inc.’s demurrer
to Plaintiff Adan Gomez-Rivera’s first amended complaint
is overruled as moot.
Defendant
Caesarstone USA, Inc.’s motion to strike is denied as moot. 
 
Defendant Caesarstone USA, Inc. (“Caesarstone USA”) (“Defendant”)
demurs to Plaintiff Adan
Gomez-Rivera’s (“Gomez-Rivera”) (“Plaintiff”) first amended complaint (“FAC”).  (Notice of Demurrer Caesarstone
USA, pgs. 1-2; C.C.P. §§430.10(e), (f).)  Caesarstone also moves to strike portions of
the FAC.  (Notice of MTS Caesarstone USA,
pgs. 2-6; C.C.P. §436.)
 
Background
Plaintiff filed his initial Complaint on January 25, 2023.  On March 2, 2023, Plaintiff filed his
FAC.  On November 15, 2023, this Court
sustained demurrers to Plaintiff’s FAC with 20 days leave to amend.  (11/15/23 Minute Order.)   On December 5, 2023, Plaintiff filed his
operative SAC against Caesarstone USA, and numerous other Non-moving Defendants
(collectively, “Defendants”) alleging five causes of action: (1) negligence;
(2) strict liability- warning defect; (3) strict liability- design defect; (4) fraudulent
concealment; and (5) breach of implied warranties.
This action arises out of Plaintiff’s employment from about 2004
to 2022 in Los Angeles in which he cut, fabricated, and installed granite,
marble, and other natural and artificial stone countertops, mostly in homes. 
(SAC ¶81.)  Plaintiff alleges through the course of his work, he worked
with inherently hazardous products manufactured, distributed by Defendants and
Plaintiff was thereby exposed to and inhaled toxicologically significant
amounts of silica, metals, and other fibrogenic substances from said products,
and developed silicosis and other related consequential injuries, and for which
Plaintiff needs to receive a lung transplant to save his life.  (SAC ¶92.) 

On October 20, 2023, Caesarstone USA filed its demurrer to the FAC
and motion to strike.  On March 20, 2024,
Plaintiff filed his oppositions to Caesarstone USA’s demurrer and motion to
strike.  As of the date of this hearing
no replies have been filed by Caesarstone USA.
 
A.  
Caesarstone USA’s Demurrer to FAC and
Motion to Strike FAC
In light of the fact that Plaintiff filed the operative SAC more than
nine court days before the hearing on the instant motion, Caesarstone USA’s
demurrer to Plaintiff’s FAC is overruled as moot, and its Motion to Strike
Plaintiff’s FAC is denied as moot.
 
Conclusion
Caesarstone USA’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s FAC is overruled as moot.
Caesarstone USA’s motion to strike portions of Plaintiff’s FAC is denied
as moot.
Moving Party to give notice.
