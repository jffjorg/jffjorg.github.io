 Hearing Date:  April 3, 2024



 
Plaintiff
Ramiro De La Torre’s unopposed motion for terminating sanctions against pro
per Defendant Dan Kloss is granted.  Plaintiff
is entitled to an order striking Kloss’s Answer and rendering a default against
Kloss.  The Final Status Conference set
for September 20, 2024, and Jury Trial set for September 30, 2024, are vacated.
Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions against pro per Defendant
Dan Kloss is granted in the reduced amount of $1,650.00.  Sanctions are payable within 20 days.
 
          Plaintiff Ramiro De
La Torre (“De La Torre”) (“Plaintiff”) moves unopposed for terminating
sanctions and monetary sanctions against pro per Defendant Dan Kloss (“Kloss”)
(“Defendant”) on the grounds Kloss has violated this Court’s 10/4/23 Minute
Order compelling him to provide verified responses to Plaintiff’s Form
Interrogatories – General (Set One) and Request for Production of Documents
(Set One), produce responsive documents, appear for and produce documents at deposition,
and pay monetary sanctions.  (Notice of
Motion, pg. 2; §§2023.030(a), (d)(1), (4); 2023.010(g); 2030.290(c);
2025.450(h); 2031.300(c).)  Plaintiff
seeks an order striking Kloss’ Answer, entering a default against Kloss, and
ordering Kloss to pay Plaintiff monetary sanctions in the amount of $7,535.00.  (Notice of Motion, pg. 2.)  Finally, since this matter is stayed in
regard to Defendant Precision Forging Dies, Inc., Plaintiff requests this Court
vacate the Final Status Conference set for September 20, 2024 and the Jury
Trial set for September 30, 2024.  (Notice
of Motion, pg. 2.)
 
Background
On November 15, 2021, Plaintiff filed his initial Complaint
against Defendants Precision Forging Dies, Inc. (“PFD”)[1] and Kloss (collectively, “Defendants”).  Plaintiff filed his operative first amended
complaint (“FAC”) on July 14, 2022, alleging six causes of action: (1) hostile
work environment – harassment on the basis of race, ancestry, color, and
national origin; (2) discrimination on the basis of race, ancestry, color, and
national origin; (3) retaliation for opposing discrimination and harassment;
(4) failure to prevent discrimination, harassment, or retaliation; (5) wrongful
discharge in violation of public policy; and (6) intentional infliction of emotional
distress.  (See FAC.)  Defendants filed an answer to Plaintiff’s FAC
on November 21, 2022.  
On April 26, 2023, Plaintiff propounded Form Interrogatories –
Employment (Set One) (“FROG”) and Request for Production of Documents (Set One)
(“RFP”) to Kloss.  On August 3, 2023, Plaintiff
propounded Requests for Admission (Set One) (“RFA”) and Special Interrogatories
(Set One) (“SROG”).  As of the date of
filing this hearing, Kloss has not responded to any of Plaintiff’s discovery
requests.  (Decl. of Hutchins ¶7.)  
On July 26, 2023, Plaintiff served Kloss with an Amended
Deposition Notice, noticing the deposition for August 10, 2023, at 10:00 a.m.
at 1230 Rosecrans Avenue, Suite 200, Manhattan Beach, California 90266.  (Decl. of Hutchins ¶9.)  On August 10, 2023, Kloss did not appear at
the deposition or produce documents responsive to the deposition notice and
Plaintiff took a Certificate of Nonappearance. 
(Decl. of Hutchins ¶10.)
On October 4, 2023, this Court heard (1) Plaintiff’s Motion to
Compel Kloss’ Attendance and Production of Documents at Deposition and Request
for Monetary Sanctions in the Amount of $1,750.00 Against Kloss; (2)
Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Kloss to Provide Responses to Plaintiff’s FROG and
Request for Monetary Sanctions in the Amount of $1,600.00; and (3) Plaintiff’s
Motion to Compel Defendant Dan Kloss to Provide Responses to Plaintiff’s RFP
and Request for Monetary Sanctions in the Amount of $1,600.00.  This Court ordered Kloss (1) to appear for
deposition, produce responsive documents, and pay Plaintiff sanctions in the
amount of $1,250.00 within 20 days of the order; (2) to provide verified, objection-free
responses to Plaintiff’s FROG and pay Plaintiff sanctions in the amount of
$1,100.00 within 20 days of the order; and (3) to produce responsive documents
and provide verified, objection-free responses to Plaintiff’s RFP within 20
days of the order.  (10/4/23 Minute
Order.)
On October 4, 2023, Plaintiff served Kloss with a Second Amended Deposition
Notice, noticing the deposition for October 20, 2023, at 10:00 a.m. at 1230
Rosecrans Avenue, Suite 200, Manhattan Beach, California 90266.  (Decl. of Hutchins ¶12.)  Kloss did not serve objections to this
deposition notice.  (Decl. of Hutchins
¶12, Exh. C.)  On October 20, 2023,
Defendant Kloss did not appear at the deposition or produce documents
responsive to the Deposition Notice, and Plaintiff took a Certificate of
Nonappearance.  (Decl. of Hutchins ¶13,
Exh. D.) 
As of the date of this hearing Kloss has not provided responses to
Plaintiff’s FROG or RFP, produced responsive documents, appeared and produced
documents at his properly noticed deposition, or paid Plaintiff monetary
sanctions in the amounts of $1,250.00 and $1,100.00.  (Decl. of Hutchins ¶14.)
On March 6, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant motion. As of the
date of this hearing Kloss has not filed an opposition.
 
 Terminating Sanctions
The Court, “after notice to any affected party . . . and after
opportunity for hearing,” may impose terminating and/or monetary sanctions for
misuses of the discovery process. 
(C.C.P. §2023.030(a) and (d).) 
Misuses of the discovery process include failing to respond or to submit
to an authorized method of discovery and disobeying a court order to provide
discovery.  (C.C.P. §§2023.010(d),
(g).)  
“A decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made
lightly. But where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and
the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with
the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate
sanction.”  (Mileikowsky v. Tenet
Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 262, 279-280.)  When deciding whether to impose terminating sanctions,
courts generally weigh three factors: (1) whether the party subject to the sanction
acted willfully, (2) the detriment to the party seeking discovery, and (3) the
number of formal and informal unsuccessful attempts to obtain discovery.  (Creed-21 v. City of Wildomar (2017) 18
Cal.App.5th 690, 702; Lang v. Hochman (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246.)  Nonmonetary sanctions require evidence of
willful violations of discovery orders or a history of egregious abuses of
discovery.  (R.S. Creative, Inc. v.
Creative Cotton, Ltd. (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 486.)  A prerequisite to the imposition of
nonmonetary sanctions is willful disobedience of a court order.  (New Albertsons, Inc. v. Superior Court
(2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 1403.)  By
requiring a violation of a discovery order before imposing nonmonetary
sanctions, California courts can be sure that the offending party does not
intend to comply with the discovery request.  (Ruvalcaba v. Government Employees Insurance
Co. (1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 1579, 1581.) 
“[A] terminating sanction issued solely because of a failure to pay a
monetary discovery sanction is never justified.”  (Newland v. Superior Court (1995) 40
Cal.App.4th 608, 615.)
          Plaintiff moves for
terminating sanctions on the grounds Kloss has willfully disobeyed multiple
discovery orders.  (Motion, pg. 6.)  Kloss failed to comply with all parts of the
Court’s October 4, 2023, Ruling.  Here, terminating
sanctions are appropriate because Plaintiff is unable to obtain the essential
discovery in order to prove his claims at trial and prior monetary sanctions
have proven effective in compelling Kloss to comply with his discovery obligations.
 Therefore, Plaintiff is entitled to an
order striking Kloss’s Answer and rendering a default against Kloss.
Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s motion for terminating
sanctions is granted.       
 
Monetary Sanctions
In addition to or in lieu
of any other sanction, the court may order the disobedient party or counsel
responsible or both to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney fees,
incurred as a result of the failure to obey (including fees on the sanctions
motion).  (C.C.P. §2023.030(a).)
Plaintiff requests
monetary sanctions in the amount of $7,535.00 against Kloss for reasonable expenses, attorneys’ fees, and costs
in connection with the preparation, filing, and service of the instant
motion.  Plaintiff’s counsel declares her
hourly rate is $550.00/hour, and that counsel spent 12.7 hours in preparation
of this motion and anticipates an additional hour attending a hearing on the
motion.  (Decl. of Hutchins ¶16, Exh. E.)  The Court determines Plaintiff’s counsel’s
hourly rate is reasonable based on the experience of the Court, but that the
instant motion should not have taken longer than 2 hours to prepare.  Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions is
therefore granted in the reduced amount of $1,650.00. ($550.00/hour x 3 hours).
Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s motion for monetary sanctions
against Respondent is granted in the reduced amount of $1,650.00.  Sanctions are payable within 20 days.
 
Conclusion
Plaintiff’s unopposed motion for terminating sanctions
against Kloss is granted.  Plaintiff is
entitled to an order striking Kloss’s Answer and rendering a default against
Kloss.  The Final Status Conference set
for September 20, 2024, and Jury Trial set for September 30, 2024, are vacated.
Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions against Kloss is
granted in the reduced amount of $1,650.00. 
Sanctions are payable within 20 days.
Moving Party to give notice.
