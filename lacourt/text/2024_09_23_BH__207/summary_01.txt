The motion is unopposed. However, the application is incomplete because Counsel has not paid the required $50 fee to the State Bar of California. As a result, the Court has continued the hearing to October 14, 2024, to allow Counsel to provide proof of payment of the fee. Counsel must also provide notice of the continued hearing, including the State Bar of California, and file the notice with a proof of service forthwith.
