MOTION
 
Jonathan B. Loiterman, Esq. (“Counsel”) has filed a motion to appear
as counsel pro hac vice for Plaintiff and Cross-Defendant Deviget, LLC (“Plaintiff”).  The motion is unopposed.
 
ANALYSIS
 
            California Rules of Court rule 9.40
provides that an attorney in good standing in another jurisdiction may apply to
appear as counsel pro hac vice in the State of California by filing a verified
application together with proof of service by mail of a copy of the application
and notice of hearing on all parties who have appeared in the case and on the
State Bar of California at its San Francisco office, with payment of a $50.00
fee, so long as that attorney is not a resident of the State of California, and
is not regularly engaged in substantial business, professional, or other activities
in the State of California. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 9.40.)
 
The application must state: (1) the applicant’s residence and office
addresses; (2) the courts to which the applicant has been admitted to practice
and the dates of admission; (3) that the applicant is a member of good standing
in those courts; (4) that the applicant is not currently suspended or disbarred
in any court; (5) the title of each court and cause in which the applicant has
filed an application to appear as counsel pro hac vice in this state in the
preceding two years, the date of each application, and whether or not it was
granted; and (6) the name, address, and telephone number of the active member
of the State Bar of California who is attorney of record in the local action. (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 9.40(d).)
 
            Counsel’s verified application includes
all of the above information.  Moreover,
with regard to notice by mail on the State Bar, Counsel has provided a proof of
service indicating service of the application, memorandum in support, verified
application of Jonathan B. Loiterman, and Declaration of Eric S. Beane were
served by mail to the State Bar’s San Francisco office and to counsel for
Defendant and Cross-Complainant Stax Health. 

 
            However, Counsel has not provided
any indication that he has paid the requisite $50 fee to the State Bar of
California.  
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER 
 
Therefore, the Court continues
the hearing to October 14, 2024 to enable Counsel to demonstrate payment of the
$50 application fee.  
 
Counsel for Plaintiff shall provide
notice of the continue hearing, including the State Bar of California, and file
the notice with a proof of service forthwith.
