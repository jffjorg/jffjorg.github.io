**Case Number:** 23STLC01331

**Hearing Date:** September 25, 2023

**Dept:** 25

**Parties:** Felix Rodriguez (Plaintiff) v. YNG LLC, Vinisha Foods Corporation, and Binoy Kothari (Defendants)

**Background:**

* February 23, 2023: Plaintiff Felix Rodriguez filed a lawsuit against Defendants YNG, Vinisha Foods, and Binoy Kothari for an alleged violation of the Unruh Civil Rights Act.
* March 28, 2023: Defendants filed a joint Answer to the Complaint and Defendant Kothari filed an Application for Stay.
* April 14, 2023: The proceedings were stayed for 90 days, and an Early Evaluation Conference was scheduled for May 24, 2023.
* May 24, 2023: The Court lifted the stay.
* August 2, 2023: Plaintiff filed a Motion to Compel YNG LLC’s Further Answers to Interrogatories and the instant Motion to Compel Vinisha Foods Corporation’s Further Answers to Interrogatories.
* September 19, 2023: The Court placed the former Motion off calendar and denied Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions.

**Legal Standard:** Code of Civil Procedure § 2030.300 allows the propounding party to move for an order compelling a further response if the responses contain evasive or incomplete answers, unwarranted or insufficiently specific exercise of an option to produce documents, or unmerited or overly generalized objections.

**Discussion:**

* Plaintiff moves to compel Defendant Vinisha Foods to serve further full and complete answers to the interrogatories numbered one through five in Plaintiff’s first set of Special Interrogatories and requests monetary sanctions of $1000.
* Defendant Vinisha Foods opposes the Motion, stating it received the Special Interrogatories via email on July 4, 2023, and sent responses on July 14, 2023. Defendant requested a continuation of the meet and confer process via a telephone discussion, but Plaintiff’s counsel refused.
* The Court finds that Defendant has demonstrated that supplemental responses were served on Plaintiff, and Plaintiff’s counsel has acknowledged receipt of these supplemental responses.

**Order:**

* Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Further Answers to Interrogatories from Vinisha Foods is PLACED OFF CALENDAR AS MOOT.
* Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions is DENIED.

**Moving party is ordered to give notice.**
