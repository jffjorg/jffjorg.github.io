And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge in a court case between Home Depot U.S.A., Inc. (the plaintiff) and Laura Elizabeth Christine (the defendant). The plaintiff filed the case on February 7, 2022, alleging breach of contract, open book account, restitution, account stated, and quantum meruit. The defendant defaulted on October 11, 2022, and the court granted default judgment on November 16, 2022, for $18,495.84. On August 30, 2023, the plaintiff filed a motion to amend the judgment to correct a clerical error.

The court finds that the error is clerical, not judicial, and grants the motion. The error is the omission of the pre-judgment interest amount, which the court calculates to be $3,829.27. The court orders the judgment to be amended to include this amount, resulting in a total judgment of $22,325.11. The plaintiff's motion is granted, and the court orders notice to be given.
