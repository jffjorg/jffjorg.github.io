## English Summary:

The Judge in this case is tentatively ruling to approve Home Depot's request to amend the default judgment against Laura Elizabeth Christine. The original judgment, entered in November 2022, awarded Home Depot $18,495.84. However, it failed to include the calculated prejudgment interest of $3,829.27.

Home Depot argues this is a clerical error, as they provided the necessary information for calculating the interest in their initial request for default judgment. The Judge agrees, finding that the omission was unintentional and that Home Depot accurately calculated the interest.  

Therefore, the tentative ruling grants the motion, increasing the total judgment to $22,325.11.
