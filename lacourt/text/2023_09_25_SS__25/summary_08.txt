And here is the summary in English text:

The Court's tentative ruling is in response to the plaintiff's action for violations of the Rosenthal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and the Unfair Competition Law against the defendant, AllianceOne Receivables Management, Inc. The defendant filed a demurrer and the plaintiff filed an opposition and reply. The Court notes that the plaintiff is seeking injunctive relief, but limited jurisdiction courts like this one do not have the authority to issue permanent injunctive relief. Therefore, the Court has no jurisdiction over this action. The demurrer is placed off calendar and the action is reclassified as an unlimited jurisdiction case, which will be transferred to the transfer/reclassification desk for reassignment.
