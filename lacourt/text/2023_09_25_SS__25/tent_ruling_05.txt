 Case Number:  22STLC05275    Hearing Date:   September 25, 2023    Dept:  25  Kaylee  Dickerson v. Dollar Tree Stores, Inc. 22stlc05275ANALYSIS:   I.                 Background               On August  9, 2022, minor Plaintiff Kaylee Dickerson, through her parent Ahamad Dickerson  (“Ahamad”), filed an action against Dollar Tree Stores, Inc. (“Dollar Tree” or  “Defendant”) for premises liability.  Ahamad  was appointed guardian ad litem for minor Plaintiff Kaylee on August 10, 2022.  (8-10-22 Application and Order.)               On  September 27, 2022, Petitioner Ahamad filed an Expedited Petition to Approve Compromise of a Disputed  Claim on behalf of minor Claimant Kaylee Dickerson.             On October 25, 2022, Petitioner  filed another Expedited Petition on behalf of minor Claimant Kaylee Dickerson.  On December 2, 2022, the Court noted several  deficiencies in the Expedited Petition and set a hearing for January 5,  2023.  (12-2-22 Minute Order.)  On January 5, 2023, the Court found that  Petitioner had not filed any supplemental papers correcting the deficiencies  noted in the Court’s previous Order and denied the Expedited Petition.  (1-5-23 Minute Order.)   On May 10, 2023, Petitioner filed the instant Expedited  Petition to Approve Minor’s Compromise on behalf of minor Claimant Kaylee  Dickerson (“Petition”).  On June 2, 2023,  the Court noted that the Petition contained several deficiencies and set a  hearing for July 18, 2023, to allow Petitioner an opportunity to correct these  deficiencies.  (6-2-23 Minute Order.)   On July 10, 2023, Petitioner filed a Supplemental  Declaration and an amended MC-351, Proposed Order.   On July 18, 2023, the Court did not adopt its tentative  ruling and continued the hearing on the Expedited Petition.  (7-18-23 Minute Order.)  The Court ordered Petitioner to file a  supplemental declaration addressing the issues noted in the Court’s Order.  (Ibid.)   On August 22, 2023, Petitioner informed the Court that he  had attempted to file a supplemental declaration but it was rejected.  (8-22-23 Minute Order.)  Thus, the Court continued the hearing once  again to allow Petitioner another opportunity to file the supplemental papers.  (Ibid.)   Petitioner filed supplemental papers on August 21, 2023.   No opposition has been filed.   II.               Legal  Standard               Court approval is required  for all settlements of a minor’s claim.  (Prob.  Code §§ 3500, 3600, et seq.; Code of  Civ. Proc. § 372.)  “‘[W]ithout trial  court approval of the proposed compromise of the ward’s claim, the settlement  cannot be valid.  [Citation.] [¶] Nor is  the settlement binding [on the minor] until it is endorsed by the trial court.’”   (Pearson  v. Superior Court (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th 1333, 1338.)  A minor, like Claimant, “shall appear either  by a guardian or conservator of the estate or by a guardian ad litem appointed  by the court in which the action or proceeding is pending, or by a judge  thereof, in each case.”  (Code Civ. Proc.  § 372(a)(1).) Alternatively, the petitioner may file a declaration  demonstrating that he or she has a right to compromise the minor’s claim under  Cal. Probate Code § 3500.                Regarding the substance of the Petition, to obtain court  approval of the settlement of a minor’s claims, the petitioner must file a complete and “verified petition for  approval of the settlement and must disclose ‘all information that has any  bearing upon the reasonableness of the compromise.’ [Citations.]”  (Barnes  v. Western Heritage Ins. Co. (2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 249, 256; Cal. Rules of  Court, rule 7.950.)  (Italics added.)   Under Probate Code § 3505, if a petition is unopposed,  the Court must issue a decision on the petition at the conclusion of the  hearing.   III.             Discussion   Under California Rules of Court, rule 7.950.5, an expedited  petition for minor’s compromise without a scheduled hearing is permitted as  long as Petitioner uses the required Judicial Council forms and meets certain  conditions.  The conditions are:   (1) Petitioner is represented by an  attorney authorized to practice in the courts of this state; (2) The claim is not for wrongful  death; (3) Settlement proceeds will not be  placed in a trust; (4) There are no unresolved liens  to be satisfied from the proceeds of the compromise; (5) Petitioner's attorney did not  become involved at the request of Defendant or insurance carrier connected with  the Petition; (6) Petitioner's attorney is not  employed by nor associated with a Defendant or insurance carrier in connection  with the Petition; (7) If an action has been filed on  the claim, (A) all Defendants have appeared and are participating in the  compromise OR (B) the Court has determined the settlement to be in good faith. (8) The settlement, exclusive of interests and costs, is $50,000 or  less OR (A) the amount payable is the  insurance policy limits AND all proposed contributing parties would be substantially unable  to use assets other than the insurance policy limits. (9) The court does not otherwise  order.   Having reviewed the  Expedited Petition filed on May 10, 2023, the Court set a hearing on the  Petition to allow Petitioner an opportunity to correct the deficiencies noted in  the Court’s Order.  (6-2-23 Minute  Order.)  On July 10, 2023, six (6) court  dates before the scheduled hearing, Petitioner filed supplemental papers.  Although, Petitioner did not file the  supplemental papers in compliance with the June 2, 2023, Order, the Court, in  its discretion and for the purpose of judicial efficiency, accepted the late-filed  papers.  (7-18-23 Minute Order; Cal.  Rules of Court, 3.1300(d).)  The Court  found that Petitioner satisfactorily addressed the deficiencies previously  noted.  (7-18-23 Minute Order.)   However, the Court  continued the hearing and ordered Petitioner to address the following: 1. How will the settlement funds be distributed? 2. If the monies  will be deposited in a blocked account, then Counsel should provide the name  and address of the bank where the settlement funds will be deposited at, and  submit a proposed order to deposit (MC-355) and (proposed) Order Granting  Expedited Petition (MC-351).   (Ibid.)               On August 22, 2023, the Court once  again continued the hearing on the Petition, as Petitioner informed the Court  that his supplemental papers had been rejected.   (8-22-23 Minute Order.)               Having reviewed the supplemental  papers filed on August 21, 2023, the Court makes the following findings.               Petitioner’s counsel explains that the  settlement amount will be distributed as follows: $3,000 to the minor Claimant  through his father and guardian ad litem, $3,000 to Petitioner’s counsel, and  $3,000 to the medical provider Chiropractic Elevated.  (8-21-23 Udeochu Decl. ¶ 1.)  These funds  will be deposited in Petitioner’s personal bank account at a US Bank branch,  with the address and account number provided in counsel’s declaration.  (Ibid. at ¶ 2.)  Petitioner has also filed a Proposed Order,  MC-351, and Order to Deposit Funds in Blocked Account, MC-355.               The Court  finds that all of the requirements of the instant Petition have been satisfied.               Accordingly,  the Expedited Petition for Approval of Minor’s Compromise,  filed on behalf of minor Claimant Kaylee Dickerson, is GRANTED.               The Court  will correct the hearing date on Forms MC-351 and MC-355 prior to signing the orders.   IV.             Conclusion and Order   For the foregoing  reasons, The Expedited Petition for Approval of Minor’s Compromise,  filed on behalf of minor Claimant Kaylee Dickerson, is GRANTED.            The Court  will correct the hearing date on Forms MC-351 and MC-355 prior to signing the  orders.The Court sets the following dates:Order to Show Cause Re:  Proof of Deposit of Money in a Blocked Account and Order to Show Cause Re: Dismissal of the Entire Action are set for 12/27/2023 at 9:30 a.m. in Department 25 of the Spring Street Courthouse.   Moving party to give notice.
