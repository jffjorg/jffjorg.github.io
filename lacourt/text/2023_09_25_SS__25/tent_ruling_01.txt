  Case Number:  20STLC10399    Hearing Date:   September 25, 2023    Dept:  25  State
Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company v. Briana Paysinger 20stlc10399ANALYSIS:
 
I.               
Background
 
            On
December 15, 2020, Plaintiff
State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (“Plaintiff”)
filed an action against Defendant Briana Paysinger (“Defendant”) for subrogation,
stemming from an automobile collision between Defendant, on the one hand, and
an individual insured by Plaintiff’s automobile insurance policy, on the other
hand.  (Compl. ¶ 6)  Plaintiff compensated the insured for claimed
damages in the amount of $13,086.47 and filed the instant claim against
Defendant for allegedly causing the damages. 
(Ibid. pp. 2-3.)  On
February 16, 2021, Defendant filed an Answer to the Complaint.
 
            On October 6, 2022, Plaintiff filed
a Notice of Settlement.
 
On February 1, 2023, Plaintiff
filed a Stipulation for Dismissal with Reservation to Vacate and Enter Judgment
Upon Breach (“Stipulation”), signed by Plaintiff’s authorized representative,
Defendant, and Defendant’s attorney, to dismiss the action on the premise that
Defendant would compensate Plaintiff for the settlement amount of
$8,634.06.  (2-1-23 Stipulation.)  On February 3, 2023, the Court dismissed the
entire case without prejudice pursuant to the Stipulation and Code of Civil
Procedure § 664.6.  (2-3-23 Order.)
 
On June 15, 2023, Plaintiff filed
the instant Motion to Vacate Dismissal and Enter Judgment (“Motion”).
 
On July 24, 2023, the Court noted that
it could not ascertain the date by which Defendant had to make the one-time
payment of $4,500, thus, the Court could not determine whether Defendant had
defaulted on the agreement.  (7-24-23
Minute Order.)  The Court continued the
hearing on the Motion and ordered Plaintiff to file supplemental papers
clarifying the date by which Defendant had to make the payment.  (Ibid.)
 
On August 4, 2023, Plaintiff filed
a Supplemental Brief in support of the Motion. 
On August 23, 2023, the Court again continued the hearing on the Motion
as it found that the Supplemental Brief did not sufficiently address the
Court’s previous Order.  (8-23-23 Minute
Order.)
 
No opposition has been filed.  To date, no supplemental papers have been
filed.
 
II.             
Legal
Standard
 
CCP § 664.6, provides a summary
procedure that enables judges to enforce a settlement agreement by entering a judgment
pursuant to the terms of the parties’ settlement.  In particular, the statute provides:
 
(a) If parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a
writing signed by the parties outside of the presence of the court or orally
before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon
motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.  If requested by the parties, the court may
retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the settlement until
performance in full of the terms of the settlement.
 
(b) For purposes of this section, a writing is signed by a
party if it is signed by any of the following:
 
(1) The party.
(2) An attorney who represents the party.
(3) If the party is an insurer, an agent who is authorized
in writing by the insurer to sign on the insurer's behalf.
 
CCP §
664.6(a)-(b) (emphasis added).
 
III.           
Discussion
 
A. Retention of Jurisdiction
 
“‘[V]oluntary dismissal of an
action or special proceeding terminates the court’s jurisdiction over the
matter.’  (Conservatorship of Martha
P. (2004) 117 Cal.App.4th 857, 867) [12 Cal.Rptr.3d 142.) ‘If requested
by the parties,’ however, ‘the [trial] court may retain jurisdiction over
the parties to enforce [a] settlement until performance in full of the terms of
the settlement.’ (§ 664.6, italics added.)” 
(Mesa RHF Partners, L.P. v. City of Los Angeles (2019) 33
Cal.App.5th 913, 917.)  “‘Because of its
summary nature, strict compliance with the requirements of section 664.6 is
prerequisite to invoking the power of the court to impose a settlement
agreement.’”  (Ibid. (quoting Sully-Miller
Contracting Co. v. Gledson/Cashman Construction, Inc. (2002) 103
Cal.App.4th 30, 37).)
 
“A request for the trial court to
retain jurisdiction under section 664.6 ‘must conform to the same three
requirements which the Legislature and the courts have deemed necessary for
section 664.6 enforcement of the settlement itself: the request must be made
(1) during the pendency of the case, not after the case has been dismissed in
its entirety, (2) by the parties themselves, and (3) either in a writing signed
by the parties or orally before the court.’” 
(Ibid. (quoting Wackeen v. Malis (2002) 97 Cal.App.4th
429, 440).)  “The ‘request must be
express, not implied from other language, and it must be clear and
unambiguous.’” (Ibid. (quoting Wackeen, supra, 97 Cal.App.4th at
440).)
 
Here, the parties signed a
Stipulation for Dismissal with Reservation to Vacate and Enter Judgment Upon
Breach (“Stipulation”) containing the parties’ agreement for the Court to
retain jurisdiction pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure §664.6 to enforce the
terms of the stipulation and enter judgment in the event of default.  (2-1-23 Stipulation ¶ 3.)  Prior to the dismissal of this action, the
Stipulation was signed by the parties and submitted to the Court.  (Ibid. at p. 3.)  On February 3, 2023, the Court dismissed the
case without prejudice expressly stating that “it shall retain jurisdiction
pursuant to CCP § 664.6.”  (2-3-23
Order.)
 
On July 24, 2023, the Court found
that the Stipulation complies with § 664.6 requirements and the Court has
retained jurisdiction to enter judgment pursuant to the parties’ Stipulation in
this action.  (7-24-23 Minute Order.)
 
 
 
 
B. Entry of Judgment
 
The Stipulation Agreement filed on
February 1, 2023, provides that Plaintiff and Defendant agreed to dismiss the
action on the premise that Defendant would compensate Plaintiff for the
settlement amount of $8,634.06.  (2-1-23
Stipulation ¶ 2.)  Pursuant to the
Stipulation, Defendant’s insurance carrier, Farmers Insurance, would make a
payment of $4,134.06 by December 1, 2022. 
(Ibid.)  Subsequently,
“beginning MARCH 31, 2023, a one-time payment of $4,500.00 shall be made for
the settlement amount to be paid in full.” 
(Ibid.)
 
The Stipulation also provides that
in the event Defendant fails to make timely payments, Plaintiff will mail a
letter to Defendant regarding the default. 
(Ibid. at ¶ 3.)  If
Defendant does not remedy the default within fourteen (14) days of receiving
notice, “then plaintiff will be entitled to have any dismissal in this action
set aside and judgment entered for the settlement amount, minus credit for
payments received, plus any costs associated with entering the judgment not to
exceed $500.”  (Ibid.)  The declaration of Plaintiff’s counsel shall
be sufficient proof for judgment to be entered. 
(Ibid.)
 
On June 15, 2023, Plaintiff filed
the instant Motion alleging that Defendant has defaulted on payments and
Plaintiff is seeking to set aside the dismissal and enter judgment pursuant to
the Stipulation.  (Memorandum pp. 1-2.)  According to Plaintiff’s counsel, Defendant’s
insurance carrier made a one-time payment of $4,134.06.  (Reese Decl. ¶ 4.)  However, Defendant failed to make any
payments.  (Ibid. at ¶ 5.)  Around May 16, 2023, Plaintiff mailed
Defendant a default notice; however, Defendant did not make any payments after
the notice was sent.  (Ibid. at ¶¶
6-7, Ex. C.)
 
Plaintiff seeks to have the
dismissal set aside and judgment entered in the amount of $5,036.31 as follows:
$8,634.06 (settlement amount), minus $4,134.06 (payment made by Defendant’s
insurance carrier), plus $536.31 (court costs). 
(Ibid. at ¶ 8.)  The court
costs consist of a $396.31 filing fee, $80.00 service fee, and $60.00 motion filing
fee.  (Ibid.)
 
On July 24, 2023, the Court noted
that it could not ascertain whether Defendant failed to make a timely
payment.  (7-24-23 Minute Order.)  While the Stipulation states that the
one-time payment of $4,500.00 must be made “beginning March 31, 2023,” it does
not state how long Defendant has to make the payment.  (Ibid.)  For this reason, the Court continued the
hearing on the Motion and ordered Plaintiff to file supplemental papers clarifying
the date by which Defendant had to make the one-time payment toward the
settlement amount.  (Ibid.)
 
On August 4, 2023, Plaintiff filed
a Supplemental Brief in support of the Motion. 
Plaintiff explains that pursuant to Paragraph 3 of the Stipulation,
Defendant had fourteen (14) days from March 31, 2023, to make a payment.  (Supp. Brief.)  If Defendant did not make a payment within
this grace period, then Plaintiff would proceed to vacate dismissal and enter
judgment.  (Ibid.)  Plaintiff has not received any payments from
Defendant.  (Ibid.)
 
On August 23, 2023, the Court found
that Plaintiff’s explanation does not correspond to the language in the
Stipulation.  (8-23-23 Minute
Order.)  The Stipulation states that “beginning
MARCH 31, 2023, a one-time payment of $4,500.00 shall be made for the
settlement amount to be paid in full.” 
(2-1-23 Stip. ¶ 2.)  “If defendant
fails to make a timely payment, said failure is a material breach.”  (Ibid. at ¶ 3.)  If the event of a breach, Plaintiff will mail
a letter to Defendant informing Defendant that the payment has not been
received and Plaintiff will have a grace period of fourteen (14) days after
receiving the letter to cure the default. 
(Ibid.)  Thus, it appears
that the fourteen-day grace period starts after the letter is mailed.  The Court found that Plaintiff has still not
clarified the date by which the payment had to be made to avoid default and
once again continued the hearing for Plaintiff to provide further clarification.  (8-23-23 Minute Order.)
 
To date, no additional papers have
been filed.
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion is
denied without prejudice.
 
IV.

For the foregoing reasons,
 
Plaintiff State Farm’s Motion to Vacate
Dismissal and Enter Judgment is DENIED without prejudice.
 
Moving party is ordered to
give notice.
