 Case Number:  23STLC01331    Hearing Date:   September 25, 2023    Dept:  25  Felix Rodriguez v. YNG LLC, et al. 23stlc01331ANALYSIS:
 
I.               
Background
 
On February 23, 2023, Plaintiff Felix
Rodriguez (“Plaintiff”) filed an action against Defendants YNG, LLC (“YNG”), Vinisha
Foods Corporation (“Vinisha Foods”), and Binoy Kothari (“Kothari”) for an
alleged violation of the Unruh Civil Rights Act.
 
On March 28, 2023, Defendants YNG,
Vinisha Foods, and Kothari filed a joint Answer to the Complaint.  On the same day, Defendant Kothari filed an
Application for Stay.  On April 14, 2023,
the proceedings were stayed for 90 days and an Early Evaluation Conference was
scheduled for May 24, 2023.  (4-14-23
Notice of Stay.)  The Court lifted the
stay on May 24, 2023.  (5-24-23 Minute
Order.)
 
On August 2, 2023, Plaintiff filed a
Motion to Compel YNG LLC’s Further Answers to Interrogatories.  On September 19, 2023, the Court placed the
Motion off calendar and denied Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions.  (9-19-23 Minute Order.)
 
On August 2, 2023, Plaintiff also
filed the instant Motion to Compel Vinisha Foods Corporation’s Further Answers
to Interrogatories (“Motion”).  Defendant
Vinisha Foods filed an Opposition on September 12, 2023.  No reply has been filed.
 
II.             
Legal
Standard
 
Code of Civil Procedure § 2030.300 provides that “[o]n
receipt of a response to interrogatories, the propounding party may move for an
order compelling a further response if the propounding party deems that” the
responses contain: (1) answers that are evasive or incomplete; (2)¿an
unwarranted or insufficiently specific exercise of an option to produce
documents in lieu of a substantive response; or (3) unmerited or overly
generalized objections.  (Code of Civ.
Proc. §¿2030.300(a).)  Notice of the motions must be given within 45 days of
service of the verified response, otherwise, the propounding party waives any
right to compel a further response.  (Code Civ. Proc. §¿2030.300(c).)  The motion must also be accompanied by a meet
and confer declaration “showing a reasonable and good faith attempt at an
informal resolution of each issue presented by the motion.”  (Code of Civ. Proc. §§ 2016.040, 2030.300(b).)  California Rules of Court, rule 3.1345,
requires that all motions or responses involving further discovery contain a
separate statement with the text of each request, the response, and a statement
of factual and legal reasons for compelling further responses.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(a)(2)).
 
III.           
Discussion
 
A.     Motion to Compel Further Responses
 
Plaintiff moves to compel Defendant Vinisha Foods “to serve further full and complete
answers to the interrogatories numbered one through five in Plaintiff’s first
set of Special Interrogatories.”  (Mot.
p. 1.)  Plaintiff also requests monetary
sanctions in the amount of $1000.  (Mot.
p. 1.)
 
Plaintiff’s counsel asserts that he served Defendant Vinisha
Foods with Special
Interrogatories (Set One) on March 31, 2023. 
(Mehrban Decl. ¶ 3, Ex. A.) 
Defendant served responses to the Interrogatories.  (Ibid. at ¶ 4, Ex. B.)  Plaintiff’s counsel sent a follow-up email
regarding the responses.  (Ibid.
at ¶ 5, Ex. C.)  No further answers have
been submitted.  (Ibid. at ¶ 6.)
 
Defendant Vinisha Foods opposes the Motion. 
Defense counsel explains that he received the Special Interrogatories
via email on July 4, 2023 and did not receive any copies of the Special
Interrogatories prior to that date. 
(Chowdhary Decl. ¶ 2, Ex. 2.) 
Plaintiff’s counsel requested responses by July 14, 2023; defense
counsel sent the responses on July 14, 2023, via email.  (Ibid. at ¶¶ 2-3, Ex. 2.)  On July 17, 2023, defense counsel received a
meet and confer email from Plaintiff’s counsel regarding Defendant’s responses
and a threat of sanctions if Defendant did not provide supplemental responses
by July 31, 2023.  (Ibid. at ¶ 4,
Ex. 2.)  On July 28, 2023, defense
counsel informed Plaintiff’s counsel that he had not received the original
discovery requests sent on March 31, 2023. 
(Ibid. at ¶ 5, Ex. 2.)  He
also informed Plaintiff’s counsel that the meet and confer letter did not
address Defendant’s specific objections and he requested to continue the meet
and confer process via a telephone discussion, offering specific dates of
availability.  (Ibid. at ¶¶
6-8.)  Plaintiff’s counsel replied to the
email stating that he had already presented Plaintiff’s position through his
meet and confer letter.  (Ibid. at
¶ 9.)  On August 24, 2023, defense
counsel informed Plaintiff’s counsel that he had not received the notice of the
instant Motion and requested service of all documents via electronic
transmission.  (Ibid. at ¶ 10, Ex.
3.)  On August 28, 2023, Defendant served
further responses to the discovery requests. 
(Ibid. at ¶ 11, Ex. 1.) 
Defense counsel conveyed his availability to discuss the supplemental
responses and on August 30, 2023, forwarded verification of the responses.  (Ibid. at ¶¶ 12-13, Exs. 3-4.)  He requested that Plaintiff take the Motion
off calendar; Plaintiff’s counsel acknowledged receipt of the supplemental
responses but refused to take the Motion off calendar.  (Ibid. at ¶¶ 13-14, Ex. 4.)
 
The Court finds that Defendant has
demonstrated that supplemental responses were served on Plaintiff and
Plaintiff’s counsel has acknowledged receipt of these supplemental responses.
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Further
Answers to Interrogatories from Vinisha Foods is PLACED OFF CALENDAR AS MOOT.
 
B.    
Sanctions
 
Code of Civil Procedure §
2023.030(a) provides, in pertinent part, that the court may impose a monetary
sanction on a party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process to pay the
reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone because of
that conduct.  Misuse of discovery
includes “failing to respond or submit to an authorized method of
discovery.”  (Code Civ. Proc.
§ 2023.010(d)).
 
Furthermore,
§ 2030.300(d) authorizes the Court to impose monetary sanctions if a party “unsuccessfully
makes or opposes a motion to compel a further response to interrogatories,
unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust.”
 
Plaintiff requests $1000 in sanctions for Defendant’s failure
to serve further responses to the instant discovery request.  (Mehrban Decl. ¶ 7.)  Plaintiff’s counsel states that his hourly
rate is $500.00 per hour, and he has “spent and anticipate[s] spending a
cumulative total of no less than two hours” in preparing the Motion and
Separate Statement, reviewing Defendant’s Opposition, and appearing at the
hearing.  (Ibid.)
 
Here, the Motion is placed off calendar as moot.  The Court also finds that the imposition of sanctions
would be unjust due to Defendant’s attempts to meet and confer and provide
compliant responses to the discovery request and Plaintiff’s refusal to engage
in a reasonable and
good faith attempt at an informal resolution prior to the filing of the instant
Motion.
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions is
denied.
 
IV.

The Motion to Compel Defendant Vinisha Foods
Corporation’s Further Answers to Interrogatories, filed by Plaintiff Felix
Rodriguez, is PLACED OFF CALENDAR AS MOOT. 
Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions is DENIED.
 
Moving party is ordered to
give notice.
