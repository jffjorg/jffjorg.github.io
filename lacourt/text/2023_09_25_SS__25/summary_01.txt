Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge is considering a motion filed by State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (State Farm) to vacate the dismissal of the action and enter judgment against Briana Paysinger (Defendant) for breach of a settlement agreement. The settlement agreement, filed on February 1, 2023, provided for the dismissal of the action on the condition that the Defendant would compensate State Farm for the settlement amount of $8,634.06. The agreement also required the Defendant to make a one-time payment of $4,500.00 by a certain date, which is not specified in the agreement.

State Farm alleges that the Defendant has defaulted on the payments and seeks to set aside the dismissal and enter judgment against the Defendant. The Judge notes that the agreement does not specify the date by which the payment had to be made, and therefore, cannot determine whether the Defendant has defaulted on the payment.

The Judge finds that the agreement does not comply with the requirements of California Code of Civil Procedure § 664.6, which requires that the request for retention of jurisdiction be made during the pendency of the case, by the parties themselves, and either in a writing signed by the parties or orally before the court. The Judge also finds that the Plaintiff has not provided sufficient clarification on the date by which the payment had to be made to avoid default.

Therefore, the Judge denies State Farm's motion to vacate the dismissal and enter judgment without prejudice. The Judge orders the moving party to give notice.

## Case Summary: State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company v. Briana Paysinger (20STLC10399)

**Case Number:** 20STLC10399
**Hearing Date:** September 25, 2023
**Department:** 25

**Parties:**
* **Plaintiff:** State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company
* **Defendant:** Briana Paysinger

**Background:**

* On December 15, 2020, State Farm filed a lawsuit against Briana Paysinger for subrogation, claiming Paysinger caused a car accident that resulted in damages covered by State Farm's insured.
* State Farm paid $13,086.47 to its insured and sought reimbursement from Paysinger.
* On February 1, 2023, the parties entered into a Stipulation for Dismissal with Reservation to Vacate and Enter Judgment Upon Breach, agreeing to dismiss the case if Paysinger made payments totaling $8,634.06.
* The Stipulation included a provision for a one-time payment of $4,500.00 starting "beginning March 31, 2023." 
*  State Farm claims Paysinger failed to make the required payments and filed a Motion to Vacate Dismissal and Enter Judgment on June 15, 2023.

**Issues:**

* **Jurisdiction:** Does the court have jurisdiction to enforce the Stipulation and enter judgment?
* **Default:** Did Paysinger default on the payment agreement?

**Legal Analysis:**

* The court determined it retained jurisdiction to enforce the Stipulation under CCP § 664.6.
* The court previously questioned the date by which Paysinger was obligated to make the $4,500.00 payment to avoid default.
* Despite orders to clarify, Plaintiff failed to provide sufficient information about the payment deadline.

**Ruling:**

* The Plaintiff's Motion to Vacate Dismissal and Enter Judgment is denied without prejudice due to insufficient clarification regarding the payment deadline.


**Significant Statements:**

*  State Farm argues that Paysinger defaulted on the payment agreement because no payments were made after March 31, 2023.
* The court needs clarification from State Farm about the specific date by which the payment was due to determine if a default occurred.



Let me know if you would like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of the ruling.

**Case Number:** 20STLC10399

**Hearing Date:** September 25, 2023

**State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company** v. **Briana Paysinger**

### Analysis

I. Background

* On December 15, 2020, State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company filed a subrogation action against Briana Paysinger for damages caused by a car collision.
* On February 1, 2023, the parties signed a Stipulation for Dismissal with Reservation to Vacate and Enter Judgment Upon Breach, agreeing that Defendant would compensate Plaintiff $8,634.06.
* The Court dismissed the case on February 3, 2023, retaining jurisdiction under CCP § 664.6.
* On June 15, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Motion to Vacate Dismissal and Enter Judgment, alleging Defendant's failure to make timely payments.

II. Legal Standard

* CCP § 664.6 allows a court to enter judgment based on a settlement agreement if the parties request it.

III. Discussion

* The Court found that the Stipulation complies with § 664.6 and has retained jurisdiction.
* The Stipulation requires Defendant to pay $4,500 beginning March 31, 2023, and failure to make timely payments constitutes a breach.
* The Court cannot determine if Defendant defaulted due to unclear payment deadlines.
* Plaintiff's Supplemental Brief did not sufficiently address the issue, and no additional papers have been filed.

IV. Conclusion & Order

* Plaintiff's Motion to Vacate Dismissal and Enter Judgment is DENIED without prejudice.
* Moving party is ordered to give notice.
