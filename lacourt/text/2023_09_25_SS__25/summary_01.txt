* The Court denied Plaintiff's motion to vacate dismissal and enter judgment without prejudice.

**Summary:** The judge's tentative ruling denies Plaintiff's motion to vacate dismissal and enter judgment without prejudice. The Court found that the settlement agreement was signed by the parties, but the Court cannot determine whether Defendant has defaulted on payments due to unclear language in the agreement. The Court ordered Plaintiff to provide further clarification on the date by which Defendant had to make the one-time payment to avoid default.
