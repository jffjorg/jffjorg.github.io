Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge is considering a motion filed by State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (State Farm) to vacate the dismissal of the action and enter judgment against Briana Paysinger (Defendant) for breach of a settlement agreement. The settlement agreement, filed on February 1, 2023, provided for the dismissal of the action on the condition that the Defendant would compensate State Farm for the settlement amount of $8,634.06. The agreement also required the Defendant to make a one-time payment of $4,500.00 by a certain date, which is not specified in the agreement.

State Farm alleges that the Defendant has defaulted on the payments and seeks to set aside the dismissal and enter judgment against the Defendant. The Judge notes that the agreement does not specify the date by which the payment had to be made, and therefore, cannot determine whether the Defendant has defaulted on the payment.

The Judge finds that the agreement does not comply with the requirements of California Code of Civil Procedure § 664.6, which requires that the request for retention of jurisdiction be made during the pendency of the case, by the parties themselves, and either in a writing signed by the parties or orally before the court. The Judge also finds that the Plaintiff has not provided sufficient clarification on the date by which the payment had to be made to avoid default.

Therefore, the Judge denies State Farm's motion to vacate the dismissal and enter judgment without prejudice. The Judge orders the moving party to give notice.
