## English Summary:

This tentative ruling concerns a lawsuit filed by Kaylee Dickerson, a minor, against Dollar Tree Stores, Inc. for premises liability. Kaylee's father, Ahamad Dickerson, is her guardian ad litem and has filed several petitions seeking court approval to settle Kaylee's claim.

The court initially denied an earlier petition due to deficiencies.  After receiving revised petitions and addressing further concerns raised by the court, the judge now finds that all requirements for approval have been met. The settlement agreement involves a $9,000 payment, with $3,000 allocated to Kaylee, $3,000 to her father (as her attorney), and $3,000 to a medical provider. 

The court grants the petition and will finalize the order, including correcting the hearing date on the relevant forms.  A follow-up hearing is scheduled for December 27, 2023, to ensure the settlement funds are properly deposited and to address the potential dismissal of the case.
