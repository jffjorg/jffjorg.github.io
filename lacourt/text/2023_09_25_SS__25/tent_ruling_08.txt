 Case Number:  23STLC03090    Hearing Date:   September 25, 2023    Dept:  25  Jason Alan v. AllianceOne Receivables Management,
Inc. 23stlc03090ANALYSIS:
 
I.               
Background
& Discussion 
 
On May 9, 2023, Plaintiff Jason Alan (“Plaintiff”) filed
an action for violations of the Rosenthal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act,
Civil Code § 1788, et seq., and the Unfair Competition Law, Business and
Professions Code § 17200, et seq., against Defendant AllianceOne Receivables
Management, Inc. (“Defendant”).
 
Defendant filed the instant Demurrer ( “Demurrer”) on June
29, 2023.  Plaintiff filed an Opposition
on July 26, 2023, and Defendant filed a Reply on August 28, 2023.
 
As an initial matter, the Court notes that Plaintiff
seeks injunctive relief.  (Compl. p. 8 –
Prayer for Relief.)  However, limited
jurisdiction courts, such as this one, do not have the authority to issue
permanent injunctive relief.  (Code Civ.
Proc. § 86(a)(8).)  Thus, this Court has
no jurisdiction over this action.
 
Accordingly, the Demurrer is PLACED OFF CALENDAR.  The Court, on its own motion, also
RECLASSIFIES this action to unlimited jurisdiction court, as permitted by Code
of Civil Procedure § 403.040(a).
 
II.             
Conclusion
& Order
 
For the foregoing reasons,
 
Defendant AllianceOne Receivables Management, Inc.’s Demurrer is PLACED OFF
CALENDAR. 
 
The action is RECLASSIFIED as an
unlimited jurisdiction case and is transferred to the transfer/reclassification
desk for reassignment.
 
Moving party is ordered to
give notice.
