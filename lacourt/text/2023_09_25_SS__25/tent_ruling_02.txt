(“Cargomatic”), Cargomatic Transport, Inc. (“Cargomatic  Transport”), and Slieve Donard Logistics (“Slieve”) (collectively “Defendants”)  for breach of contract and common counts. On November 30, 2022, pursuant to  Plaintiff’s request, the Court entered default against Defendant Slieve.  (11-30-22 Request for Entry of Default.)   On December 16, 2022, the Court  determined that this case is not “collection hub” case and ordered it  transferred for re-assignment.  (12-16-22  Minute Order.)  The case was reassigned  to Department 25 at the Spring Street Courthouse.  (1-6-23 Minute Order.)   On March 2, 2023, Plaintiff  informed the Court that a settlement agreement had been reached with the  Cargomatic entities.  (3-2-23 Minute  Order.)  On March 28, 2023, pursuant to  Plaintiff’s request, the Court dismissed Defendants Cargomatic and Cargomatic  Transport with prejudice.  (3-28-23  Request for Dismissal.)  On May 30, 2023,  Plaintiff informed the Court that it intended to pursue entry of default  judgment against Defendant Slieve.   (5-30-23 Minute Order.)               On June 15, 2023, Counsel Brett  Thomas Abbott (“Abbott”) filed the instant Motion to Be Relieved as  Counsel as to Plaintiff Sunshine Logistics Enterprises (“Motion”).               On August  23, 2023, the Court noted that there were deficiencies in the Motion and  continued the hearing to allow Counsel an opportunity to correct these  deficiencies.  (8-23-23 Minute Order.)  On August 25, 2023, Counsel filed  supplemental papers.   No opposition has been filed.   On August 30, 2023, the Court  continued the OSC Re: Entry of Default Judgment as to Remaining Defendant  Slieve Donard Logistics, Inc. to November 8, 2023, in Department 25 at the  Spring Street Courthouse.  (8-30-23 Minute  Order.)   II.               Legal  Standard               Code of  Civil Procedure § 284 states that “the attorney in an action…may be changed at  any time before or after judgment or final determination, as follows: (1) upon  the consent of both client and attorney…; (2) upon the order of the court, upon  the application of either client or attorney, after notice from one to the  other.”  (Code Civ. Proc. § 284; CRC  3.1362.)  The withdrawal request may be  denied if it would cause an injustice or undue delay in proceeding; but the  court's discretion in this area is one to be exercised reasonably.  (See Mandell  v. Superior (1977) 67 Cal.App.3d 1, 4; Lempert v. Superior Court (2003)  112 Cal.App.4th 1161, 1173.)               In making a  motion to be relieved as counsel, the attorney must comply with procedures set  forth in Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1362.   The motion must be made using mandatory forms:   1.      Notice of Motion and Motion to be Relieved as Counsel  directed to the client – (MC-051); 2.      Declaration “stating in general terms and without  compromising the confidentiality of the attorney-client relationship” the  reasons that the motion was brought (MC-052); 3.      Proposed Order (MC-053).   (Ibid.)  The  forms must be timely filed and served on all parties who have appeared in the  case.  (Ibid.)  If these documents are served on the client  by mail, there must be a declaration stating either that the address where  client was served is “the current residence or business address of the client”  or “the last known residence or business address of the client and the attorney  has been unable to locate a more current address after making reasonable  efforts to do so within 30 days before the filing of the motion to be  relieved.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule  3.1362(d)(1).)   III.             Discussion   On June 15, 2023, Counsel Brett T.  Abbott (“Abbott”) filed the instant Motion to be Relieved as Counsel as to  Plaintiff Sunshine Logistics Enterprises.   On August 23, 2023, the Court noted that the moving papers contained the  wrong address for the Spring Street Courthouse, where the hearing was to take  place, and Counsel Abbott failed to file Form MC-053, Proposed Order.  (8-23-23 Minute Order.)  Accordingly, the Court continued the hearing  on the Motion and ordered Counsel to file supplemental papers correcting these  deficiencies.  (Ibid.)   On August 25, 2023, Counsel filed supplemental  papers.   Counsel has filed a Notice of Motion  and Motion (MC-051), correctly listing the address for the Spring Street  Courthouse.  (8-25-23 MC-051.)  Counsel also filed a Declaration in Support  of the Motion (MC-052) stating the following:   Significant  differences between client and counsel make it impossible for the attorney to  continue the representation. Client has not responded to emails or phone calls  and counsel has been unable to leave voicemails as it indicates the voicemail  is full. Client has failed to pay its bill for attorneys fees and costs.   (8-25-23 MC-052 ¶ 2.)               Counsel  has also filed a Proposed Order, MC-053.   (8-25-23 MC-053.)   All documents were served on  Plaintiff by mail on August 25, 2023, at 4806 West Concord Ave Visalia, CA  93277.  (8-25-23 MC-051 p. 3; 8-25-23 MC-052  p. 3; 8-25-23 MC-053 p. 3.)  Counsel  indicates that he has been unable to confirm Plaintiff’s address despite  mailing the moving papers to client’s last known address, return receipt  requested, calling client’s last known telephone number, and sending  emails.  (8-25-23 MC-052 ¶ 3b(2).)               The Court finds that Counsel has  satisfied all of the requirements for the instant Motion.               According, Counsel Abbott’s Motion  to Be Relieved as Counsel as to Plaintiff Sunshine Logistics Enterprises is  granted.   IV.             Conclusion & Order   For the foregoing reasons,   Counsel Brett T.  Abbott’s Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel as to Plaintiff Sunshine Logistics  Enterprises is GRANTED, and the Order will be signed at the hearing.  “After the order is signed, a copy of the  signed order must be served on the client and on all parties that have appeared  in the case.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule  3.1362(e).)  The Order on this Motion  will not be effective “until proof of service of a copy of the signed order on  the client has been filed with the court.” (Ibid.)The Court sets an Order to Show Cause Re:  Corporate Defendant Slieve Donard Logistics, Inc.'s Legal Representation for November 8, 2023 at  9:30 a.m. in Department 25 of the Spring Street Courthouse.     Moving party is ordered to give notice.
