II.             
Legal Standard & Discussion
 
Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant Everest
moves to dismiss the Cross-Complaint filed by Defendant/Cross-Complainant
Perkins on the ground that there are no triable issues of fact to be determined
at trial as the Court determined all issues in its May 4, 2023, ruling on Everest’s
Motion for Summary Adjudication.  (Mot.
pp. 1-2.)  The Court ruled that the claims
made in the Cross-Complaint were for the work performed by Perkins as an
unlicensed contractor in violation of Business & Professions Code § 7031.  (Ibid.)  Accordingly, no such claims can be made under
§ 7031.  (Ibid.)
 
Plaintiffs submitted a Proposed
Order for the Court to sign.  (Ibid.
at p. 4.)  The Court signed the Order but
removed the following statements:
 
1)    
Pursuant to B&P Section 7031(a), Defendant Perkins
may not bring or maintain any action or collect any compensation for work where
a license is required.
2)    
Defendant's Cross-complaint for $10,657.18 is denied
and hereby dismissed with prejudice.
 
(Ibid.) 
Everest argues that the removal of these statements “contradicts the
Court’s findings with regard to B&P section 7031 which found that Defendant
Perkins is an unlicensed contractor and operating in violation of B&P §
7031.”  (Ibid.)  Given that the claims in the Cross-Complaint
are for the same services as those found to violate § 7031, the Cross-Complaint
must be dismissed.  (Ibid. at pp.
4-5.)
 
Business and Professions Code § 7031(a)
states:
Except as provided in subdivision (e), no person
engaged in the business or acting in the capacity of a contractor, may bring or
maintain any action, or recover in law or equity in any action, in any court of
this state for the collection of compensation for the performance of any act or
contract where a license is required by this chapter without alleging that they
were a duly licensed contractor at all times during the performance of that act
or contract regardless of the merits of the cause of action brought by the
person, except that this prohibition shall not apply to contractors who are
each individually licensed under this chapter but who fail to comply with
Section 7029.
            Although § 7031(a) does not permit an unlicensed contractor to
bring or maintain an action in law or equity, nothing in this section gives the
Court authority to dismiss an action brought in violation of § 7031, pursuant to a motion to dismiss.  Moreover, Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant has not
presented any other legal basis that confers authority on the Court to dismiss
such an action.
            For this reason, the Court denies Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant’s
Motion for Order Dismissing the Pending Cross-Complaint.
III.           
Conclusion
 
For the foregoing reasons,
 
The Motion for Order Dismissing the
Pending Cross-Complaint, filed by Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant Alexander Everest,
is DENIED without prejudice.
 
Moving party is to give notice.
