## Tentative Ruling Summary:

**Case Number:** 23STCP01751
**Hearing Date:** September 25, 2023
**Dept:** 25

**Parties:**
* **Plaintiff:** Sandra Cohen ("Petitioner" or "Cohen")
* **Defendant:** Xsiavosh Asrabadi ("Asrabadi") and Bahreh Qmarsi ("Qmarsi") (collectively "Respondents")

**Key Facts:**

* On May 22, 2023, Petitioner filed a Petition to Compel Arbitration against Respondents.
* The petition stems from a California Residential Purchase Agreement ("Agreement") entered into around August 8, 2020.
* The Agreement includes an arbitration clause requiring mediation before arbitration.
* Petitioner sent mediation demands in September 2020, January 2023, and March 2023, but Respondents did not respond.

**Disputed Issues:**

* Whether Respondents are obligated to mediate the dispute as per the Agreement.
* Whether the Court should order arbitration if mediation fails.

**Judge's Decision:**

* The Judge finds that Petitioner has presented a valid arbitration agreement and has attempted to mediate.
* The Judge finds that Petitioner is entitled to a Court order compelling arbitration.
* **However**, the Judge finds the petition unclear regarding the desired relief (mediation first or direct arbitration).

**Further Action Required:**

* The hearing is continued to a later date.
* Petitioner must file supplemental papers clarifying the desired relief and include copies of the mediation demand letters.
* Failure to comply may result in the petition being dismissed.


## English Summary:

The judge is leaning towards ordering the parties to go to arbitration because the contract they signed calls for it, and the plaintiff has tried to resolve the dispute through mediation without success. However, the judge is confused about what the plaintiff actually wants – either mediation first followed by arbitration, or a direct order to arbitrate. The judge has continued the hearing and asked the plaintiff to clarify her request in writing and provide copies of the letters she sent demanding mediation.

**Case Number:** 23STCP01751
**Hearing Date:** September 25, 2023
**Dept:** 25
**Parties:** Sandra Cohen (Plaintiff) vs. Xsiavosh Asrabadi, Bahreh Qmarsi (Defendants)

**Background:**

* On May 22, 2023, Petitioner Cohen filed a Petition to Compel Arbitration against Respondents Asrabadi and Qmarsi based on a California Residential Purchase Agreement (Agreement).
* On August 16, 2023, the Court rejected Petitioner's Requests for Entry of Default/Judgment against Respondents.
* No opposition has been filed.

**Legal Standard:**

* Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure §1281.2, the court must grant the petition unless it finds no written agreement to arbitrate, waiver of the right to compel arbitration, grounds for revocation of the agreement, or litigation is pending that may render the arbitration unnecessary or create conflicting rulings on common issues.
* The burden of proof lies with the moving party to demonstrate the existence of a valid arbitration agreement by a preponderance of evidence.
* The opposing party must prove by a preponderance of evidence any defense to enforcement of the contract or the arbitration clause.
* The trial court weighs all the evidence and uses its discretion to make a final determination.

**Discussion:**

* In August 2020, Petitioner and Respondents entered into the Agreement, which included an arbitration provision for disputes arising out of the Agreement.
* Petitioner demanded mediation twice, but Respondents did not respond.
* Petitioner requests a Court order compelling mediation and, if unsuccessful, arbitration of the dispute.
* The Court finds that Petitioner presented a valid arbitration agreement and has attempted mediation. Respondents have not responded, so the Court orders a compelling arbitration of the dispute.
* However, the Petition is unclear regarding the form of relief requested. The Court continues the hearing, and Petitioner is ordered to file supplemental papers clarifying whether she is moving for an order compelling arbitration or wishes to proceed with mediation.

**Order:**

* The hearing on the Petition to Compel Arbitration is CONTINUED to a future date at a.m. in Department 25 at the SPRING STREET COURTHOUSE.
* Petitioner is ordered to file supplemental papers addressing the issues discussed herein at least 16 court days before the next scheduled hearing. Failure to do so may result in the Petition being placed off calendar or denied.
* The moving party is ordered to give notice.
