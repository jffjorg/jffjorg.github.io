And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is considering a petition to compel arbitration filed by Sandra Cohen, the petitioner, against Xsiavosh Asrabadi and Bahreh Qmarsi, the respondents. The petition seeks to compel the respondents to arbitrate a dispute arising out of a California Residential Purchase Agreement, which was entered into on August 8, 2020. The agreement contains a provision for arbitration of disputes arising out of the agreement. The petitioner has attempted to mediate the dispute, but the respondents have not responded to her demands. The judge finds that the petitioner is entitled to a court order compelling arbitration, but the petition is unclear regarding the form of relief requested. The judge continues the hearing and orders the petitioner to file supplemental papers clarifying her request.
