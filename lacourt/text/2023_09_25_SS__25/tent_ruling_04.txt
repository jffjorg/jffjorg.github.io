I.               
Background
 
On
February 7, 2022, Plaintiff Home Depot U.S.A., Inc. (“Plaintiff” or “Home
Depot”) filed an action against Defendant Laura Elizabeth Christine (“Defendant”
or “Christine”), for 1) breach of contract, 2) open book account, 3)
restitution, 4) account stated, and 5) quantum meruit.
 
On
October 11, 2022, pursuant to Plaintiff’s request, the Court entered default
against Defendant.  (10-11-22 Request for
Default.)  On November 16, 2022, the
Court granted Plaintiff’s Request for Default Judgment and Judgment was entered
for Plaintiff and against Defendant for $18,495.84.  (11-16-22 Default Judgment.)
 
            On August
30, 2023, Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to Amend Judgment by Default to
Correct Clerical Error (“Motion”).
 
            No
opposition has been filed.
 
II.             
Legal
Standard 
 
Code of Civil
Procedure § 473(d) provides that, “the court may, upon motion of the injured
party, or its own motion, correct clerical mistakes in its judgment or orders
as entered, so as to conform to the judgment or order directed.”  A court has the inherent power to correct
clerical errors in its records so as to make these records reflect the true
facts.  (In re Candelario (1970) 3 Cal. 3d 702,
705.)  “The test which distinguishes
clerical error from possible judicial error is simply whether the challenged
portion of the judgment was entered inadvertently (which is clerical error)
versus advertently (which might be judicial error, but is not clerical error).  Unless the challenged portion of the judgment
was entered inadvertently, it cannot be changed post judgment under the guise
of correction of clerical error.”  Tokio
Marine & Fire Ins. Corp. v. Western Pacific Roofing Corp. (1999) 75
Cal.App.4th 110, 117 (internal citation omitted).  “An amendment that substantially modifies the original
judgment or materially alters the rights of the parties, may not be made by the
court under its authority to correct clerical error, therefore, unless the
record clearly demonstrates that the error was not the result of the exercise
of judicial discretion.”  (In re
Candelario, 3 Cal. 3d. at 705.)
 
III.           
Discussion

 
Here, Plaintiff seeks to amend a portion of the judgment
which omitted the prejudgment interest amount. 
(Mot. p. 2.)
 
In her declaration in support of the Motion, Plaintiff’s
counsel states that, after default was entered against Defendant on October 11,
2022, Plaintiff submitted a Request for Entry of Default Judgment with
supporting evidence.  (Ferrentino Decl. ¶ 3, Exs. A-C.) 
Plaintiff’s Request for Entry of Default Judgment included “‘10%
pre-judgment interest starting 9/4/2020.’” 
(Ibid. at ¶ 4, Ex. B.) 
Given that Plaintiff could not predict when judgment would be entered, a
certain sum was not included in the proposed judgment; however, Plaintiff did
provide the pre-judgment interest percentage and start date to enable the Court
to calculate the final amount.  (Ibid.
at ¶ 5, Ex. B.)  On November 16, 2022,
Plaintiff received the Judgment, which included $17,405.87 in damages,
pre-judgment interest at the rate of 10% per annum, and $1,089.97 in
costs.  (Ibid. at ¶ 6, Ex.
D.)  However, there was no amount of
interest specified from September 4, 2020, to November 16, 2022, the date of
entry of Judgment.  (Ibid. at ¶
7.)  Counsel states that this may be a
mere “clerical oversight/error” and requests that the Court correct the error
by entering a sum of $3,829.27 in interest. 
(Ibid. at ¶ 8.)  Plaintiff
has submitted a Proposed Amended Judgment which includes $17,405.87 in damages,
$3,829.27 in prejudgment interest, and $1,089.97 in costs, for a total judgment
of $22,325.11.  (Ibid. at ¶¶ 9-10,
Ex. E.)
The Court finds that the omission of the pre-judgment
interest amount is a clerical error and does not reflect the total sum of
judgment.  Moreover, Plaintiff has
accurately calculated prejudgment interest between the dates noted in the
Court’s judgment.
 
Accordingly, the Court grants Motion to Amend
Judgment by Default to Correct Clerical Error.
 
IV.           
Conclusion
& Order
 
For the foregoing reasons,
 
Plaintiff Home Depot U.S.A., Inc.’s
Motion to Amend Judgment by Default to Correct Clerical Error is GRANTED.
 
Moving party is ordered to
give notice.
