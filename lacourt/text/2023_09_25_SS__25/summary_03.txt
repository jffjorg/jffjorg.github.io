And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion filed by Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant Alexander Everest to dismiss the Cross-Complaint filed by Defendant/Cross-Complainant David C. Perkins. The motion was based on the judge's previous ruling that the claims in the Cross-Complaint were for work performed by Perkins as an unlicensed contractor in violation of Business & Professions Code § 7031. The judge ruled that the Cross-Complaint must be dismissed because it is for the same services as those found to violate § 7031. However, the judge denied the motion because nothing in the code permits the court to dismiss an action brought in violation of § 7031 and the plaintiff/cross-defendant has not presented any other legal basis to support dismissal of the action.

```

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the Plaintiff's motion to dismiss the Defendant's Cross-Complaint. The Plaintiff, Alexander Everest, had filed a motion to dismiss the Cross-Complaint, arguing that the Defendant, David C. Perkins, is an unlicensed contractor and therefore cannot collect compensation for work performed. The Judge found that while the Defendant is indeed an unlicensed contractor, the law (Business & Professions Code § 7031) does not permit the Court to dismiss an action brought by an unlicensed contractor. The Judge therefore denied the Plaintiff's motion, allowing the Cross-Complaint to proceed. The case will proceed to a hearing on September 25, 2023.

## English Summary

This tentative ruling addresses a motion to dismiss a Cross-Complaint filed by David C. Perkins against Alexander Everest and Comforting Home Hospice Inc. 

The Court previously ruled that Perkins, who performed work as an unlicensed contractor, violated Business & Professions Code § 7031.  Everest argues that this violation prevents Perkins from maintaining his Cross-Complaint.  

However, the Court states that while § 7031(a) prohibits unlicensed contractors from recovering compensation, it does not give the Court the power to dismiss an action based solely on this violation through a motion to dismiss. 

Therefore, the Court denies Everest's motion to dismiss the Cross-Complaint without prejudice.
