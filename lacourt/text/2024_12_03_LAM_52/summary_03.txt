The judge has granted the plaintiffs' unopposed motion to amend the order granting final approval of the class action settlement. The motion seeks to increase the allocation of expenses to the settlement administrator, Epiq, from $300,000 to $442,062.41. The plaintiffs provided a declaration from Michelle LaCount, a project manager at Epiq, which explains the additional efforts and costs incurred by Epiq to administer the settlement, including a second distribution of payments. The judge has determined that the plaintiffs have shown good cause for the requested amendment and will sign the proposed order submitted by the plaintiffs.
