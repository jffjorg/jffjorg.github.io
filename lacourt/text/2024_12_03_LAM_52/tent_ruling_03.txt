 Case Number:  BC712959    Hearing Date:   December 3, 2024    Dept:  52 Plaintiffs Stephen McFadyen, Seth
Blackham, and Monica Garcia’s Renewed Unopposed Motion to Amend Order Granting
Final Settlement Approval
Plaintiffs Stephen McFadyen, Seth Blackham, and
Monica Garcia move to amend the court’s order granting final approval of class
action settlement.  They move to increase
the allocation of expenses to settlement administrator Epiq
Class Action & Claims Solutions, Inc. (Epiq) from $300,000 to $442,062.41.  
Plaintiffs show good cause for such an order.  Plaintiffs submitted a declaration from Michelle
LaCount, a project manager at Epiq. 
(LaCount Decl., ¶ 1.)  She
describes the additional efforts Epiq took to administer the settlement,
including a second distribution of payments. 
(Id., ¶¶ 6-12.)  LaCount
testifies, “Because the administration of this Settlement took longer than
anticipated and the necessity to conduct a secondary, residual distribution,
Epiq incurred an additional $142,062.41 in administration costs related to: (1)
efforts to promote cashing of initial payment round checks; (2) fees and
expenses related to the secondary, residual distribution; and (3) final closing
costs for the matter.”  (Id., ¶
12.)  
Plaintiffs’ renewed motion to amend order granting
final settlement approval is granted.  The court
will sign the proposed order plaintiffs submitted.
