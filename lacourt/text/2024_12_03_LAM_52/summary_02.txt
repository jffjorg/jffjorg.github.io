And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiff, Andrii Kozmyn, is seeking a default judgment against defendants Dmytro Kriupeniukov and Kateryna Gorbenko. However, the judge has determined that the plaintiff's request is defective. The plaintiff has not provided sufficient evidence to prove the full damages he is seeking, which includes $1,550 in damages under Labor Code section 226. Additionally, the plaintiff's request for PAGA penalties is also defective because it does not properly allocate the penalties. The judge has ordered the plaintiff to either dismiss his claims for PAGA penalties or submit a proposed judgment that allocates 75% of the penalties to the Labor and Workforce Development Agency and 25% to all aggrieved employees. The plaintiff's request for default judgment is denied without prejudice.
