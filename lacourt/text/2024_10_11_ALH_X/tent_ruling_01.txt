  Case Number:  22AHCV00776    Hearing Date:   October 11, 2024    Dept:  X Ex Parte Application to Advance the Hearing of
Defendant’s MSJ
 
Defendant Boys and Girls Club of Pasadena’s Ex
Parte Application is denied without prejudice. 
Although Defendant reserved a hearing date for the motion, the
underlying motion for summary judgment has not been filed.  In the absence of the moving papers being
filed, the Court is unable to specially set the hearing date to be heard prior
to trial.  Once the motion has been
filed, Defendant may then seek, either by way of ex parte application or
stipulation of the parties, to reset the hearing date to be heard on or within
30 days of trial.  
 
Moving Party is to give notice.
