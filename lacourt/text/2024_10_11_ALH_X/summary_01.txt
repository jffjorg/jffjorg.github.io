And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's ex parte application to advance the hearing date for their motion for summary judgment. The defendant had reserved a hearing date for the motion, but failed to file the underlying motion. As a result, the court is unable to set a hearing date prior to trial. The defendant may refile the motion and then seek to reset the hearing date to a date 30 days or less before trial, either by filing a new ex parte application or stipulating with the parties. The moving party is required to give notice.
