And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling denies the defendant's motion to quash service of process. The defendant, Van Nuys Plywood and Lumber (a de facto General Partnership), argues that the service was defective because the individual who accepted service, Gena Luthman, is not a known or existing person and was not authorized to accept service on behalf of the partnership. However, the court finds that the service was proper and that the defendant's motion is untimely. The court notes that the defendant's demurrer against the complaint was filed on February 8, 2024, and that the partnership is sufficiently apprised of the claims against it. The court also requires the defendant to clarify any apparent misspellings in the proof of service.
