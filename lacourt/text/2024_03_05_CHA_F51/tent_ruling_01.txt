  Case Number:  23CHCV03300    Hearing Date:   March 5, 2024    Dept:  F51  MARCH 4, 2024    MOTION TO QUASH  SERVICE OF PROCESS  Los Angeles Superior Court Case  # 23CHCV03300    Motion Filed: 2/13/24   MOVING PARTY: Defendant Van Nuys Plywood and Lumber,  a de facto General Partnership (“Moving Defendant”) RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiffs  DG Lumber Group, Inc. and Tzvika Diner (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) NOTICE: OK   RELIEF REQUESTED: An  order quashing Plaintiffs’ service of their Complaint and Summons on Moving Defendant.   TENTATIVE RULING: The motion is denied.   BACKGROUND    This is a contractual  fraud action. On 10/30/23, Plaintiffs filed their complaint, alleging 21 causes  of action against four named defendants. Moving Defendant is alleged as a “defacto  general Partnerships with its general partners consisting of [defendants] Luthman  and Holland.” (Compl. ¶ 6.)   On 11/14/23,  Plaintiffs filed a proof of service indicating that Moving Defendant was served  with process via personal service at 12:11 PM on 11/2/23. On 2/13/24, Moving Defendant  filed the instant motion to quash. On 2/21/24, Plaintiffs filed their  opposition. On 2/27/24, Moving Defendant filed its reply.    ANALYSIS   A defendant may move, “on or before the last day of his or  her time to plead,” to quash the service of summons by alleging a lack of  personal jurisdiction, or to dismiss the action on the ground of inconvenient  forum. (Code Civ. Proc. § 418.10, subd. (a).) A motion to quash must be granted  if the court finds that either (1) there is no basis for exercising personal  jurisdiction over the defendant or (2) service on the defendant was improper. (Ziller  Elecs. Lab GmbH v. Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 1222, 1229.)   “A summons may be served on an unincorporated association  (including a partnership) by delivering a copy of the summons and of the  complaint: (a) If the association is a general or limited partnership, to the  person designated as agent for service of process in a statement filed with the  Secretary of State or to a general partner or the general manager of the  partnership …” (Code Civ. Proc. § 416.40, subd. (a).)    “The return of a  [registered] process server … establishes a presumption, affecting the burden  of producing evidence, of the facts stated in the return.” (Evid. Code § 647.)  “The filing of a proof of service creates a rebuttable presumption that the  service was proper.” (Floveyor International, Ltd. v. Superior Court  (1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 789, 795.)   Here, the proof of service submitted by Plaintiffs  indicates that the summons and complaint were served by personal service on 11/2/23,  at 12:11 PM, on an individual identified as “Gena Luthman, Authorized to Accept  Service,” and described as “Female; Age Late 70s; White Skin Tone; Gray Hair;  5’4”; 120 lbs” at 6913 Wish Avenue, Van Nuys, California 91406. (11/14/23 POS,  ¶¶ 3b, 4, 5a.)   However, “once a defendant files a motion to quash the  burden is on the plaintiff to prove by a preponderance of the evidence the  validity of the service and the court's jurisdiction over the defendant.” (Bolkiah  v. Superior Court (1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 984, 991.) Here, Moving Defendant  argues that the service was defective because “a ‘Gena Luthman’ is not a known  or existing person and certainly is not and was not an authorized agent, nor an  employee, nor in charge, nor authorized to accept service for a ‘Van Nuys  Plywood and Plumber,’ a de facto general partnership.” (Def.’s Mot. 3:8–10.)   As a preliminary matter, Plaintiffs argue that Moving  Defendant’s motion should be denied outright as untimely. A defendant may move  to quash service anytime before a responsive pleading is due, usually 30 days  from the date of completed service of the complaint. (Code Civ. Proc. § 418.10,  subd. (a).) Here, as Plaintiffs served Moving Defendant on 11/2/23, the last  day for Moving Defendant to file the instant motion was on 12/4/23. (Code Civ.  Proc. §§ 412,20, subd. (a)(3); 12a, subd. (a).) However, Moving Defendant filed  the instant motion on 2/13/24. Accordingly, the Court denies the instant motion  as untimely. The Court notes that the denial of the instant motion would not unduly  prejudice Moving Defendant, where the partnership is sufficiently apprised of  the claims against it, as shown by the filing of its demurrer against  Plaintiffs’ complaint on 2/8/24.    The Court further notes that Moving Defendant points out  apparent misspellings in Plaintiffs’ proof of service, and thus places the  burden on Plaintiffs to clarify any such errors in the court record.   CONCLUSION    The motion is  denied.
