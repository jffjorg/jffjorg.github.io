And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a motion for attorney fees filed by Kinecta Federal Credit Union, the plaintiff in a collections action. The plaintiff is seeking to recover $9,727.00 in attorney fees as the prevailing party in the action. The court finds that the plaintiff is entitled to reasonable attorney fees as the prevailing party, as provided in the contract between the parties. The court uses the lodestar method to calculate the reasonable fee award, which is based on the number of hours reasonably expended by the plaintiff's attorneys multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate. The court notes that the defendant has failed to file any opposition to the motion, and therefore does not challenge the reasonableness of the plaintiff's attorney fees incurred. The court grants the plaintiff's motion and awards $9,727.00 in reasonable attorney fees.
