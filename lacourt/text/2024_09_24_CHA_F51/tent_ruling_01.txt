BACKGROUND
 
This is a
collections action in which Plaintiff alleges that on 6/24/21, Defendants
executed a loan agreement “in the principal sum of $20,000.00, which was
payable in monthly installment payments of $411.58, beginning on August 8,
2021, with one final payment of $411.18, due on July 7, 2026.” (FAC ¶ 5.)
Plaintiff alleges that Defendants defaulted on the loan agreement on 7/8/22. (Id.
at ¶ 6.)
 
On 10/28/22, Plaintiff filed its original complaint
against Defendants, alleging the following causes of action: (1) Breach of
Unsecured Written Agreement; and (2) Common Count. On 1/5/23, Plaintiff filed
its first amended complaint (“FAC”), alleging: (1) Breach of Unsecured Written
Agreement; (2) Common Count; (3) Breach of Agreement; (4) Open Book Account;
(5) Account Stated; (6) Breach of Agreement; (7) Open Book Account; and (8)
Account Stated.
 
On 2/10/23, Defendants filed their answer. On 7/20/23,
Plaintiff dismissed defendant The Estate of Gurdip Saran from the action
without prejudice. On 4/9/24, the Court granted Plaintiff’s unopposed motion
for summary judgment against defendant Rachael Hooker-Saran. On 4/22/24, the
Court entered a judgment for Plaintiff and against Hooker-Saran.
 
On 4/30/24, Plaintiff filed the instant motion. No
opposition has been filed to date.
 
ANALYSIS
 
“In any
action on a contract, where the contract specifically provides that attorney’s
fees and costs, which are incurred to enforce that contract, shall be awarded
either to one of the parties or to the prevailing party, then the party who is
determined to be the party prevailing on the contract, whether he or she is the
party specified in the contract or not, shall be entitled to reasonable
attorney’s fees in addition to other costs.” (Civ. Code § 1717, subd. (a).)
 
Here, Plaintiff
states that “the Contract, which serves as the basis for this action, provides
that Plaintiff is entitled to recover reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs
incurred in the collection of the payments owed pursuant to the contract.”
(Pl.’s Mot. 3:18–20.) Specifically, the contract entered into between the
parties provides that “You agree to pay all costs of collecting the amount you
owe under this Agreement, including court costs and reasonable attorney fees.”
(Ex. 1 to Decl. of Matthew Marquez, p. 2.) Therefore, here, Plaintiff is
entitled to reasonable attorney fees as the prevailing party.
 
1.     
Attorney Fees Incurred
 
In
determining a reasonable fee award, the Court begins with the lodestar method
of calculation, i.e., the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the
reasonable hourly rate.¿(Karton v. Ari Design & Construction, Inc.
(2021) 61 Cal.App.5th 734, 744; PLCM Group, Inc. v. Drexler (2000) 22
Cal.4th 1084, 1095–1096.) Here, Plaintiff seeks to recover $9,727.00 in
attorney fees, encompassing 47.90 hours of its attorneys’ time. (Ex. A to Decl.
of Karel Rocha.) 
 
The Court
notes that Defendant has failed to file any opposition to the instant motion,
and therefore does not challenge the reasonableness of Plaintiff’s attorney
fees incurred. Accordingly, the Court grants Plaintiff’s motion to recover $9,727.00
in reasonable attorney fees.
 
CONCLUSION
 
The unopposed motion is granted. Plaintiff is awarded $9,727.00
in attorney fees.
 
The Court is not requesting oral argument on
this matter.  Pursuant to California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1308(a)(1)
notice of intent to appear is required.  Unless the Court directs argument
in the Tentative Ruling, no argument will be permitted unless a “party notifies
all other parties and the court by 4:00 p.m. on the court day before the
hearing of the party’s intention to appear and argue.  “The tentative
ruling will become the ruling of the court if no notice of intent to appear is received.”
