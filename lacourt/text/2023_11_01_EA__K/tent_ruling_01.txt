  Case Number:  21PSCV00469    Hearing Date:   November 1, 2023    Dept:  K Plaintiff Gonzalo Tovar Hernandez’s unopposed
Motion for Leave to File Second Amended 
Complaint is GRANTED. 
Background   
Plaintiff Gonzalo
Tovar Hernandez (“Plaintiff”) alleges as follows: In 1999, Plaintiff, Manuel
Ramirez
(“Manuel”), Delores Ramirez (“Delores”) and Maria Tovar (“Maria”) purchased the

property
located at 790 Elliott Ct. #A, Pomona, CA 91766 (“subject property”). In 2002,
Plaintiff 
and Manuel
refinanced the subject property. In 2003, Delores died and an Affidavit of
Joint 
Death was
recorded. In 2004, Plaintiff and Manuel refinanced the subject property. In
2007, 
Plaintiff,
Manuel and Maria granted the subject property to Plaintiff as his sole and
separate 
property. In
2008, Plaintiff granted the subject property to himself and Manuel, as tenants
in 
common. In
2008, Manuel stated that upon his death he intended to give his interest in the

subject
property to his goddaughter, Defendant Myra Sanchez (“Sanchez”). In 2009,
Manuel 
recorded a deed
without Plaintiff’s knowledge, wherein he purported to grant the subject 
property to
himself and Sanchez, as tenants in common. Manuel died on April 15, 2009.
Sanchez 
moved onto the
subject property after Manuel’s death. In or about June 2018, Sanchez stopped 
paying her ½
share of the mortgage and her share of utilities costs for the subject
property. 
On September 8,
2021, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint, asserting causes of action
against
Sanchez, All persons unknown, claiming any legal or equitable right, title,
estate, lien, or 
interest in the
property described in the complaint adverse to Plaintiff’s title, or any cloud
upon 
Plaintiff’s
title thereto (“All Persons”) and Does 1-50 for:
1.     
Quiet Title2.     
Declaratory Relief
A Case
Management Conference is set for November 1, 2023.
Legal Standard
“The court may, in
furtherance of justice, and on any terms as may be proper, allow a party to
amend any pleading…” (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (a)(1); and see § 576 [“Any
judge, at any time before or after commencement of trial, in the furtherance of
justice, and upon such terms as may be proper, may allow the amendment of any
pleading or pretrial conference order”].)
“[T]he trial court
has wide discretion in allowing the amendment of any pleading.” (Bedolla v. Logan & Frazer (1975) 52
Cal.App.3d 118, 135.) “[I]t is irrelevant that new legal theories are
introduced as long as the proposed amendments relate to the same general set of
facts.” (Kittredge Sports Co. v. Superior
Court (1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 1045, 1048 [quotation marks and citation
omitted].) “[E]ven if the proposed legal theory is a novel one, the preferable
practice would be to permit the amendment and allow the parties to test its legal sufficiency by demurrer, motion for judgment on the
pleadings or other appropriate proceedings.” (Id. [quotation marks and citation omitted].) With that said, “the
failure of a proposed amendment to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause
of action or defense may support an order denying a motion to amend.” (California
Casualty Gen. Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1985) 173 Cal.App.3d 274, 280,
disapproved of on other grounds in Kransco v. American Empire Surplus Lines
Ins. Co. (2000) 23 Cal.4th 390)
Courts must apply a
policy of great liberality in permitting amendments to the complaint at any
stage of the proceedings, up to and including trial, when no prejudice is shown
to the adverse party. (Atkinson v. Elk
Corp. (2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 739, 761.) However, “even if a good
amendment is proposed in proper form, unwarranted delay in presenting it may—of
itself—be a valid reason for denial. . . denial may rest upon the element of
lack of diligence in offering the amendment after knowledge of the facts, or
the effect of the delay on the adverse party.” (Roemer v. Retail Credit Co. (1975) 44 Cal.App.3d 926, 940.)
Also, “[a] motion to
amend a pleading before trial must: (1) Include a copy of the proposed
amendment or amended pleading, which must be serially numbered to differentiate
it from previous pleadings or amendments; (2) State what allegations in the
previous pleading are proposed to be deleted, if any, and where, by page,
paragraph, and line number, the deleted allegations are located; and (3) State
what allegations are proposed to be added to the previous pleading, if any, and
where, by page, paragraph, and line number, the additional allegations are
located.” (Cal. Rules of Court (“CRC”), rule 3.1324, subd. (a).)
Additionally, “[a]
separate declaration must accompany the motion and must specify: (1) The effect
of the amendment; (2) Why the amendment is necessary and proper; (3) When the
facts giving rise to the amended allegations were discovered; and (4) The reasons
why the request for amendment was not made earlier.” (CRC Rule 3.1324, subd.
(b).)
Discussion
Plaintiff moves the
court for an order granting him leave to file a Second Amended Complaint
(“SAC”).
The motion reflects
non-compliance with CRC Rule 3.1324, subdivisions (a)(2) and (3) and
(b)(2)-94); however, the motion is unopposed. Plaintiff’s counsel Shazad Z.
Omar (“Omar”) represents that the proposed SAC seeks to add the Estate of
Manuel Ramirez in as a defendant, to change his quiet title cause of action to
one of partition and to add a cause of action for accounting. (Omar Decl., ¶
7).
The motion is
granted.
