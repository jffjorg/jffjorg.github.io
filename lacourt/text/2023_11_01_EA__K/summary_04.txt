Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Richard Norene's special motion to strike the complaint filed by Aimee Thurman, Daniel Thurman, Lorin Rowley, and Sandra Rowley. The complaint alleges that Norene, along with co-Defendants Fannan and Quigg, filed a false and frivolous complaint against the Plaintiffs, and that they are trying to take advantage of them. The judge finds that Norene has made a threshold showing that the challenged causes of action arise from protected activity, and that the Plaintiffs have failed to oppose the instant motion. Therefore, the motion is granted, and the complaint is struck and dismissed.
