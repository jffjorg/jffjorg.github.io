prejudice.

Corp Solutions, Inc. (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint,
asserting a cause of action against Defendant Teena Thomas (“Defendant”) and
Does 1-15 for:
1.                 
Breach of Contract
On August 8, 2023, Defendant’s default was entered.
An Order to Show Cause Re: Default is set for November 1,
2023.
Discussion
Plaintiff’s Application for Default Judgment is denied without
prejudice. The following defects are noted:
The Bill of Sale attached as Exhibit C to Teresa Fauga’s
declaration references an Exhibit I, which apparently identifies the Accounts
being transferred from Compass Bank to Plaintiff. Exhibit I is not attached.
Plaintiff must provide the court with same to confirm that the subject account
is part of the Bill of Sale.
