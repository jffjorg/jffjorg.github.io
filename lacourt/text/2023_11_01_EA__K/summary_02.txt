The judge has issued a tentative ruling on Credit Corp Solutions, Inc.'s application for default judgment. The application is denied without prejudice due to certain defects. The judge notes that Exhibit I, which identifies the accounts being transferred from Compass Bank to Plaintiff, is not attached to the Bill of Sale. The judge requires the Plaintiff to provide the court with Exhibit I to confirm that the subject account is part of the Bill of Sale. The hearing is still set for November 1, 2023, and the judge will reconsider the application at that time.
