[TENTATIVE] RULING
  RE:
Defendant Debra
  Gassman’s Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings.



 
Background
Pleadings
Plaintiff Alida L. Ross (Alida)—individually and derivatively on behalf of
Defendant Spec Tool Company (Spec Tool)—sues Defendants Spec Tool, David B. Fink, individually and as Trustee of
The Albert G. Fink, Jr. Revocable Living Trust of 2000 (David), Debra L.
Gassman, as Trustee of The Gassman Living Trust, dated 6-7-91 (Debra), and Does
1-100 pursuant to a June 13, 2023 Third Amended Complaint (TAC).
The TAC alleges claims of (1)
Involuntary Dissolution against Spec Tool and Does 1 through 100, (2)
Declaratory Relief against Spec Tool, David, Debra, and Does 1 through 100, (3)
Violation of Cal. Corp. Code Section 1600, et seq. against Spec Tool and Does 1
through 100, (4) Breach of Fiduciary Duty against David and Does 1 through 100, and (5) Civil Conspiracy against David and Does 1 through 100.
(The parties are referred to in
this ruling by their first names for ease of reference given that many of the
involved individuals have the same last name. No disrespect is intended.)
The claims arise from allegations
that, among other things, Spec Tool—a family business initially owned by Albert
G. Fink, Jr., deceased (Albert Jr.), and Alida’s parents—has been directed by
Defendants to the financial detriment of Alida Ross, who has been frozen out of
employment with or directorship over the corporation, and that Defendants have
failed since 2005 to pay Alida any dividends owed to her based on her
shareholder interest in Spec Tool—per the FAC, 31.02% according to Alida but 22.26%
according to Spec Tool. The claims also arise from allegations that in 2003,
Albert Jr. and David Fink (Albert Jr.’s son) conspired to obtain a controlling
interest in Spec Tool by taking advantage of their positions in the company and
the diminished mental state of Alida and Albert Jr.’s mother to acquire 1,412
shares in Spec Tool through payment of only $56,480—roughly $40 per share—where
Spec Tool’s financial statements for 2003 reflected that the shares’ book value
at the time was approximately $1,387 per share.
(All claims against Defendant Fink
failed on demurrer on September 1, 2023. No leave to amend was granted.)
Motion Before the Court
On November 17, 2023, Debra filed a
motion for judgment on the pleadings (MJOP) with respect to the TAC’s second
cause of action for declaratory relief.
On December 7, 2023, the Court
signed a stipulation by the parties to set a hearing date for Debra’s MJOP and
set a hearing for January 26, 2024.
On January 12, 2024, Alida opposed
the MJOP.
On January 19, 2023, Debra replied
to the opposition.
Debra’s MJOP is now before the
Court.
 
Request
for Judicial Notice
Per Debra’s request, the Court
takes judicial notice of various filings by the parties in this action: a
notice of ruling filed September 6, 2023; a declaration filed by Alida on May
19, 2021; and a declaration filed by Defendant Fink on January 20, 2021. (MJOP,
RJN, p. 2, Exs. 1-3, citing Evid. Code, § 452, subd. (d); Julian Volunteer
Fire Co. Assn. v. Julian-Cuyamaca Fire Protection Dist. (2021) 62
Cal.App.5th 583, 600 [judicial notice may be taken as to existence of document
and legal effects deriving therefrom]; Lockley v. Law Office of Cantrell,
Green, Pekich, Cruz & McCort (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 875, 885 [Documents
are only judicially noticeable to show their existence and what orders were
made such that the truth of the facts and findings within the documents are not
judicially noticeable]; Joslin v. H.A.S. Ins. Brokerage (1986) 184
Cal.App.3d 369, 375 [hearing on demurrer may not be turned into contested
evidentiary hearing through guise of having court take judicial notice of
documents whose truthfulness or proper interpretation are disputable].)
 
Motion
for Judgment on the Pleadings
Legal Standard
Either
prior to trial or at the trial—and barring statutory provisions otherwise—the
plaintiff or the Defendants may move for judgment on the pleadings where the appropriate
ground for such a motion is the same as that arguable by general demurrer,
namely, the failure to state a cause of action or defense. (Dobbins v.
Hardister (1966) 242 Cal.App.2d 787, 791 A motion for JOP is used to
challenge a pleading in the same manner as a general demurrer—that is, the
challenged pleading (1) establishes that the court does not have subject-matter
jurisdiction or (2) does not allege facts sufficient to support a cause of
action or defense. (Code Civ. Proc., § 438, subd. (c)(1); see Marzec v.
Public Empls. Ret. Sys. (2015) 236 Cal.App.4th 889, 900; International
Assn of Firefighters v. City of San Jose (2011) 195 Cal.App.4th 1179, 1196.)
To
sufficiently allege a cause of action, a complaint must allege all the ultimate
facts—that is, the facts needed to establish each element of the cause of
action pleaded. (Committee on Children’s Television, Inc. v. General Foods
Corp. (1983) 35 Cal.3d 197, 212, superseded by statute as stated in Branick
v. Downey Savings & Loan Assn. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 235, 242.) In testing
the sufficiency of the cause of action, the demurrer admits the truth of all
material facts properly pleaded. (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist.
(1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 966-967.) Courts read the allegations liberally and in
context. (Taylor v. City of Los Angeles Dept. of Water and Power (2006)
144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228, disapproved on other grounds, Jones v. Lodge at
Torrey Pines Partnership (2008) 42 Cal.4th 1158, 1162.) However, this
analysis “does not admit contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or
law.” (Daar v. Yellow Cab Co. (1967) 67 Cal.2d 695, 713.) The face of
the complaint includes exhibits attached to the complaint. (Frantz v.
Blackwell (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 91, 94.) If facts appearing in the exhibits
contradict those alleged, the facts in the exhibits take precedence. (Holland
v. Morse Diesel Intern., Inc. (2001) 86 Cal.App.4th 1443, 1447, superseded
by statute on other grounds as stated in White v. Cridlebaugh (2009) 178
Cal.App.4th 506, 521.)
As
with a demurrer, the grounds for a motion for judgment on the pleadings must
appear on the face of the pleading or be based on facts capable of judicial
notice. (Bufil v. Dollar Fin. Grp. (2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 1193, 1202,
disapproved on other grounds in Noel v. Thrifty Payless, Inc. (2019) 7
Cal.5th 955, 985-986, fn. 15.) The only significant difference between the two
motions is that a motion for judgment on the pleadings is brought after the
time to file a general demurrer has expired. (Code Civ. Proc., § 438, subd. (f);
Caldera Pharms. v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal. (2012) 205 Cal.App.4th
338, 350; International Assn of Firefighters v. City of San Jose, supra,
at p. 1196.)
Order
Granting Judgment on the Pleadings on TAC, Second Cause of Action, Declaratory
Relief, as Stated Against Defendant Debra Gassman: GRANTED, without
leave to amend.
I. Parties’ Arguments
Any
person interested under a written instrument, excluding a will or a trust, or
under a contract, or who desires a declaration of his or her rights or duties
with respect to another, or in respect to, in, over or upon property, or with
respect to the location of the natural channel of a watercourse, may, in cases
of actual controversy relating to the legal rights and duties of the respective
parties, bring an original action or cross-complaint in the superior court for
a declaration of his or her rights and duties in the premises, including a
determination of any question of construction or validity arising under the
instrument or contract. (Code Civ. Proc., §1060.) The fundamental basis of
declaratory relief is a present and actual controversy between the parties over
a proper subject. (City of Cotati v. Cashman (2002) 29 Cal.4th 69, 80.)
The
second cause of action seeks declaratory relief finding that “the purported
2003 acquisition of 1,412 shares of Spec Tool stock by David [Fink; Plaintiff’s
nephew] and Albert Jr. [Fink, Plaintiff’s deceased brother and David’s father]
was improperly made and therefore void or voidable.” (TAC, ¶¶ 4, 47.)
In
her MJOP, Debra challenges the second cause of action on statute of limitations
grounds, arguing that the discovery date of any injury to Alida must have
occurred in 2005. Debra also challenges the second cause of action on the
grounds that: “Here, Plaintiff’s long delay in pursuing this claim has
significantly prejudiced [Spec Tool]. Plaintiff’s claims all relate to a 2003
transaction involving Albert Jr. But Albert Jr. is now deceased. Thus, the
single most important witness to this action, Albert Jr., is unavailable as a
result of Plaintiff’s delay. Even if he were not, the 15[-]year delay has
resulted in important documents becoming lost or otherwise unavailable, and
other witnesses’ memories are likely to have significantly faded. Thus, …
Plaintiff’s … claims should be barred by the doctrine of laches.” Last, Debra
argues that equitable estoppel is not applicable based on judicial admissions
by Alida showing that Alida wrote letters to Albert Jr. that showed Alida was
not intimidated by Albert Jr. as early as September 2005 or May 2006. (MJOP,
pp. 5-9, citing MJOP, RJN, Exs. 2-3.)
In
opposition, Alida argues that the pleading’s equitable estoppel allegations
nullify any arguments based on statute of limitations or laches. Alida more
specifically argues that the TAC sufficiently alleges equitable estoppel, and
that equitable estoppel applies where victimization has occurred and can
undercut the invocation of any statute of limitations or laches arguments. Alida
also argues that Debra seeks to convert this into a contested evidentiary
hearing by relying on evidence for which Debra requested judicial notice. Last,
Alida argues that the continuing violations doctrine extends the accrual of the
statute of limitations. (Opp’n, pp. 8-14.)
In
reply, Debra reiterates the statute of limitations and laches positions and
argues that the TAC fails to allege equitable estoppel against Debra
specifically. Debra also argues that there is no “continuing violation”
applicable to Debra and her husband Kevin Gassman. Last, Debra argues that “now
that the Court has adjudicated Plaintiff’s claim for declaratory relief in
favor of Spec Tool and David Fink, the Court lacks the jurisdiction to void the
shares owned by David Fink, notwithstanding the fact that Plaintiff named Ms.
Gassman as a nominal defendant on the cause of action for declaratory relief[;]
[i]ndeed, Ms. Gassman does not have the ability or power to set aside the 2003
transaction.” (Reply, pp. 1-5.)
II. Statute of Limitations and Laches
Unless
a complaint affirmatively discloses on its face that the statute of limitations
has run, the general demurrer on these grounds must be overruled. (See Lockley
v. Law Office of Cantrell, Green, Pekich, Cruz & McCort (2001) 91
Cal.App.4th 875, 881 [“It must appear clearly and affirmatively that, upon the
face of the complaint, the right of action is necessarily barred”].) Instead,
“[t]he proper remedy ‘is to ascertain the factual basis of the contention
through discovery and, if necessary, file a motion for summary judgment ….’
[Citation.]” (Roman v. County of Los Angeles (2000) 85 Cal.App.4th 316,
325.) Generally, a “statute of limitations begins to run when the plaintiff
suspects or should suspect that her injury was caused by wrongdoing, that
someone has done something wrong to her” (the “discovery rule”). (Bernson v.
Browning–Ferris Industries (1994) 7 Cal.4th 926, 932.) “[A] cause of action
accrues at ‘the time when the cause of action is complete with all of its
elements.’” (Fox v. Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc. (2005) 35 Cal.4th 797,
806-807.) “… ‘When an obligation or liability arises on recurring basis, a
cause of action accrues each time a wrongful act occurs, triggering a new
limitations period.’” (Aryeh v. Canon Business Solutions, Inc. (2013) 55
Cal.4th 1185, 1198-1199.)
In
order to establish laches, the party must show: “(1) delay in asserting a right
or a claim; (2) the delay was not reasonable or excusable; and (3) prejudice to
the party against whom laches is asserted. [Citations.]” (Magic Kitchen LLC
v. Good Things Internat., Ltd. (2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 1144, 1157 (Magic
Kitchen).)
Here,
the complained-of transaction occurred in 2003. (TAC, ¶¶ 22-33(e), 45, 47.) The
discovery date has previously been determined to be in or around April 20-28, 2005. (9/1/23 Minutes, p.
6.) By that time, Alida was on sufficient notice that some kind of transaction
had occurred that gave David and Albert Jr. a majority 55.48% interest in Spec
Tool, an interest that Alida alleges to have challenged in an estate meeting
with her brother. (TAC, ¶ 50(c) [“‘How did that happen? Where did you find 20%
of the stock?’”].) These allegations imply that, as of late April 2005, Alida
knew or should have known that David and Albert Jr. had acquired a 20% interest
in Spec Tool beyond what they should have received following the death of Alida
and Albert Jr.’s mother. (See TAC, ¶¶ 50(b)-(d).) These allegations also amount
to circumstances where Alida “should [have] suspect[ed] that [David and Albert
Jr.] … [had] done something wrong to her” interest in Spec Tool, thus
triggering the statute of limitations. (Bernson v. Browning–Ferris
Industries (1994) 7 Cal.4th 926, 932.)
However,
the lawsuit was not brought until November 25, 2020, more than 15 years after
the reasonable discovery date in the face of the pleadings (in or around April 20-28, 2005). Such delay in filing
this suit amounts to a delay in asserting a right by Alida Ross, where the
delay was not excusable given the long-time knowledge of the injuries—equitable
estoppel arguments aside, to be discussed below.
Moreover,
based on the above discovery date, which is clear from the face of the TAC, any
statute of limitations would have run by May 1, 2009—equitable estoppel
arguments aside, to be discussed below. (Maguire v. Hiberia Savings &
Loan Soc. (1944) 23 Cal.2d 719, 734 [“[I]f declaratory relief is sought
with reference to an obligation [that] has been breached and the right to
commence an action for … relief upon the cause of action arising therefrom is
barred by the statute [of limitations], the right to declaratory relief is
likewise barred”; “[o]n the other hand, if declaratory relief is sought ‘before
there has been any breach of the obligation in respect to which said
declaration is sought,’ or within the statutory period after the breach, the
right to such relief is not barred by lapse of time”]; Code Civ. Proc., § 343
[four-year statute of limitations for all causes of action for which Code does
not provide a specific time frame]; cf. Stalberg v. Western Title Ins. Co.
(1991) 230 Cal.App.3d 1223, 1230 [“The statute of limitations for breach of fiduciary
duty is four years[] (§ 343[])”].)
III. Equitable Estoppel
Our
Supreme Court noted that “estoppel may certainly be invoked when there are acts
of violence or intimidation that are intended to prevent
the filing of a claim.” (John R. v. Oakland Unified School Dist. (1989)
48 Cal.3d 438, 445, italics in original (John R.).) 
After
review, the Court finds that equitable estoppel does not save the pleadings
from the statute of limitations or laches arguments.
While
the Court accepts Alida’s argument that abuse victims are often cowed or
traumatized by their abusers, the Court finds that Alida’s allegations in her
TAC that she did not file this lawsuit until 2020 based on Albert Jr. allegedly
threatening her and her husband’s safety are contradicted by other records in
this case. 
The
Court has taken judicial notice of affidavit admissions by Alida that admit
threatening Albert Jr. with criminal complaints over IRS filings, and another
letter written by Alida also shows that Alida threatened to file a civil
lawsuit against Albert Jr. in May 2006 if Albert Jr. sold their deceased
mother’s house. (See MJOP, RJN, Ex. 2, ¶ 50 [Alida Ross declaration made in
this lawsuit admitting to writing a September 29, 2005 letter directed at
Albert Jr.] & Ex. 3, Sub-Exs. H [copy of September 29, 2005 letter by Alida
Ross to Albert Jr. stating that Albert Jr. should not be mistaken as to Alida
Ross’s willingness to file criminal complaints against Albert Jr. related to
alleged misrepresentations made by Albert Jr. to the IRS and impacting Alida
Ross’s own tax liability]; see also MJOP, RJN, Ex. 3, Sub-Ex. K [May 6, 2006
letter from Alida Ross to Albert Jr. threatening to file civil lawsuit against
Albert Jr. if Albert Jr. put up a house that belonged to their deceased mother
up for sale].)
The
Court notes it does not consider these letters for the truth of the matters
asserted, but rather for the fact that Alida admits to making the statements in
the September 2005 letter (constituting a judicial admission), and the fact
that they were made within months of the alleged June 3, 2005 threat that
underlies the equitable estoppel argument by Alida, the legal effect of which
is to undercut an equitable estoppel defense by Alida on the ground that Alida
has admitted to writing a letter(s) showing she was not intimidated by Albert
Jr. (Mark Tanner Constr., Inc. v. HUB Int’l Ins. Servs. (2014) 224
Cal.App.4th 574, 586 [statements in an opponent’s pleadings are treated as
judicial admissions].)
The
TAC’s allegations that Alida did not file this lawsuit until after Albert Jr.
died based on mortal fear of Albert Jr. are meritless when juxtaposed against Alida’s
letters, which threatened to make a criminal complaint against Albert Jr. in
September 2005 based on IRS tax filings and threatened to initiate a civil
lawsuit against Albert Jr. in May 2006 if Albert Jr. sold their deceased
mother’s house. (MJOP, RJN, Ex. 2, ¶ 50 & Ex. 3, Sub-Ex. H.) California
courts have held that the statute of limitations begins to run when the
coercive effect of any relevant threats has ceased. (V.C. v. Los Angeles
Unified School Dist. (2006)
139 Cal.App.4th 499, 517, citing John R., supra, 48 Cal.3d at p.
446.) “If there is still ample time to institute the action within the
statutory period after the circumstances inducing delay have ceased to operate,
the plaintiff who failed to do so cannot claim an estoppel.” (Lobrovich v.
Georgison (1956) 144 Cal.App.2d 567, 573-574.)
Here,
a comparison of the TAC’s allegations and, at the very least, the September
2005 letter Alida Ross admitted to writing shows that there was ample time to file
this action between September 2005 and the applicable 2009 limitations period.
The
Court also notes that the continuing violations doctrine does not appear
applicable for two reasons. (See Opp’n, pp. 13-14.) First, the TAC does not allege
continuing intimidation of Alida past the June 3, 2005 threat by Albert Jr. The
opposition argues that continuing intimidation is shown by allegations of (1)
denied requests for employment with Spec Tool, (2) denied requests for board
membership in Spec Tool, (3) unpaid shareholder distributions, and (4) denied
requests to ascertain the value of Spec Tool. (Opp’n, p. 14, citing TAC, ¶ 38.)
That conduct differs from the June 3, 2005 threat, which Alida took to imply
great bodily harm, not the mere freezing out of Alida from Spec Tool. (TAC, ¶
50(h).) Second, the TAC does not allege any intimidation by Debra.
Defendant
Debra Gassman’s MJOP is thus GRANTED.
IV. Leave to Amend
“To
demonstrate an abuse of discretion [meriting the reversal of an order denying
leave to amend], the burden is on the plaintiff to show there is a reasonable
possibility that the proposed amendment will cure the defect … by showing in
what manner the amendment to the complaint can be amended and how that
amendment will change the legal effect of the pleadings.” (Brenner v. City
of El Cajon (2003) 113 Cal.App.4th 434, 444.)
In
her MJOP, Debra argues that no leave to amend should be granted as to the
second cause of action as stated against Debra because Plaintiff has been
unable to state a viable claim despite several opportunities to do so. (MJOP,
p. 9.)
The
opposition and reply do not make any specific arguments in favor or against
leave to amend other than conclusions for or against that relief.
The
Court finds that leave to amend is not warranted. It is not clear to the Court
how the defects in pleading relating to laches and statute of limitations will
be cured where the equitable estoppel defense has failed and various amendments
to the pleadings have taken place. 

Conclusion
Defendant Debra Gassman’s Motion
for Judgment on the Pleadings is GRANTED, without leave to amend.
The Court notes that only two
claims remain operative in this action: the Involuntary Dissolution and
Violation of Cal. Corp. Code Section 1600, et seq. claims against Spec Tool and
Does 1 through 100.
