And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the record and has made the following tentative ruling. The Order to Show Cause Re Default Judgment will be continued. The plaintiff has secured entry of default against UCLA Health Auxiliary, but has not filed a default judgment package. The judge reminds the plaintiff that they must obtain a default judgment against the defaulting party within 45 days after the default was entered.

The judge has also granted the unopposed motion for determination of good faith settlement filed by Defendant Doe 1, Sheraton License Operating Company, LLC. The motion was brought pursuant to Code Civ. Proc., ยง 877.6, subd. (a)(1), which requires notice to all joint tortfeasors and the opportunity to be heard. However, since UCLA Health Auxiliary is in default, it was not served and could not have opposed the motion.

The judge determines that at least five of the factors listed in Tech-Bilt, Inc. v. Woodward-Clyde & Assocs. favor the settlement, including a rough approximation of the parties' recovery and liability, the amount paid in settlement, the allocation of proceeds among a single plaintiff, recognition that Marriott is paying less in settlement than it would if it were found liable after a trial, and the lack of collusion, fraud, and tortious conduct aimed to injure the interests of the non-settling defendants.

Accordingly, the judge will grant the motion for determination of good faith settlement and sign the proposed order lodged with the Court.
