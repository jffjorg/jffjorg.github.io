Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge considered the motion for leave to file a second amended complaint, which seeks to add punitive damages claims to the original complaint. The Plaintiff, Kaila Gutierrez, seeks to amend the complaint to add new factual allegations and request punitive damages. The Defendants, UHS and Del Amo Hospital, Inc., and Juden Valdez, oppose the motion, arguing that it is untimely and that the Plaintiff has not shown a substantial probability of prevailing on the claims.

The judge denied the motion without prejudice, meaning that the parties can refile the motion and comply with the procedural requirements. The judge found that the delay in bringing the motion was not so prejudicial as to warrant denying the motion, but the motion was procedurally deficient due to the lack of identification of the allegations to be added. The judge ordered the prevailing party to give notice of the ruling.
