And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling finds that Defendants' counsel has not waived privilege as to the allegedly privileged documents. The Court notes its dismay that Defendants did not produce a privilege log until 3/12/2024, approximately six weeks after Plaintiffs brought this issue to its attention. The Court determines that Defendants' initial production did not result in waiver, nor did their subsequent conduct. The Court finds that Defendants' counsel employed a method that it could have reasonably believed would not produce privileged materials. The Court orders Defendants to produce a privilege log within 15 days of the entry of this order.
