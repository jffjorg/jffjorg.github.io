The tentative ruling grants Plaintiff's motions to compel responses from Defendant Income Tax Solutions and Defendant Guadalupe Avitia-Dominguez to their respective Requests for Proposals (RFPs) and Form Interrogatories. The court sanctions both defendants, jointly and severally with counsel, in the amount of $700. The court also grants Plaintiff's motion to have its Requests for Admission (RFAs) deemed admitted. The defendants failed to respond to the discovery requests, and the court finds that they have not set forth any substantial justification for their failure to respond.
