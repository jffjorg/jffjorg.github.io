And here is the English-text summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The Court grants the Plaintiff's motion to file a first amended complaint. The proposed amended complaint adds the Plaintiff's husband, Alfred Alvino, as a plaintiff, a cause of action for nuisance, and allegations regarding Sunrun's agency relationships with other defendants. Since Sunrun has consented to the proposed amendment and no other defendants have objected, the Court finds that the amendment does not prejudice Sunrun. The Court notes that California courts favor liberal allowance of amendments and that the decision on a motion for leave is directed to the sound discretion of the trial court. Therefore, the Court grants the motion and orders the Plaintiff to file the amended complaint within 10 days.
