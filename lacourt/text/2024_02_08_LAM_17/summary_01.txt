Significant Statements:
  - "To effectuate the purpose of the statute, a section 998 offer must be made in good faith: 'To effectuate the purpose of the statute, a section 998 offer must be made in good faith to be valid. Good faith requires that the pretrial offer of settlement be 'realistically reasonable under the circumstances of the particular case. Normally, therefore, a token or nominal offer will not satisfy this good faith requirement ....' The offer 'must carry with it some reasonable prospect of acceptance. One having no expectation that his or her offer will be accepted will not be allowed to benefit from a no-risk offer made for the sole purpose of later recovering large expert witness fees."
```

And here is the English-text summary:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on Plaintiff Alter Mermelstein's motion to strike costs. The court has struck Defendant Good Samaritan Hospital's costs by $12,979.54. The court found that Defendant's 998 Offer was not made in good faith, as it was made before discovery and did not carry with it a reasonable prospect of acceptance. The court also found that the offer was not made for the purpose of settling the case, but rather for the sole purpose of later recovering large expert witness fees. Therefore, the court has denied Defendant's request to recover expert fees. The court has also struck the cost of the transcript fees, finding that they were not recoverable.
