And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge, Hon. Jon R. Takasugi, has issued a tentative ruling granting the Plaintiffs' motion for leave to amend their complaint. The Plaintiffs, Sebastian Donovan and Arconex, are seeking to add new causes of action, including fraudulent transfer and allegations that Johannes Bhakdi and Quantgene, Inc. are alter-egos. The Judge finds that the policy favoring leave to amend is strong and that the allegations were not known to the Plaintiffs at the time the original complaint was filed. The Judge also finds that there is no evidence of meaningful prejudice to the Defendants if leave to amend is granted. The trial date is in August 2024, leaving time for the parties to take discovery on the new causes of action and for the Defendants to prepare their defenses for trial.
