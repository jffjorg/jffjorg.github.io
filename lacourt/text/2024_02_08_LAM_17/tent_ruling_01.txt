ALTER MERMELSTEIN 
  
        
  vs.
 
GOOD SAMARITAN HOSPITAL 
 


 Case
  No.:  21STCV00880  
 
 
 
 Hearing Date: February 8, 2023



 
 
Plaintiff’s
motion to strike costs is GRANTED IN PART. The Court strikes Defendant’s costs
by $12,979.54. 
 
On 1/8/2021,
Plaintiff Alter Mermelstein (Plaintiff) initiated this action. On 1/14/2021,
Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint (FAC) against Good Samaritan
Hospital, Jonathan R. Saluta, M.D., Terrence J. Fitzgibbons, M.D., and Jigar
Kadakia, M.D., alleging negligence and medical malpractice. 
 
            Now,
Plaintiff moves to tax costs. 
 
Discussion 
 
            Plaintiff
seeks to tax the following costs:
 
-        
Item 8b: Expert Fees: $12,747.34 
-        
Item 12: $1,222.20: Transcripts 
 
As to the
expert fee costs, fees of experts not ordered by the court are not ordinarily
recoverable as costs. (CCP § 1033.5, subd. (b)(1).) However, such costs can be
required pursuant to CCP section 998(c)(1). Plaintiff argues that Defendant
cannot recover these fees because it does so based on its 998 Offer, and its
998 Offer was not made in good faith. 
 
In Elrod
v. Oregon Cummins Diesel, Inc. (1987) 195 Cal. App. 3rd 692, the Court
there stated: 
 
An offeree
cannot be expected to accept an unreasonable offer. Hence, any subsequent
punishment of the offeree for non-acceptance does not further the purpose of
section 998, because the offeree would not have acted differently at the time
of the offer despite the threat of later punishment. In these circumstances,
later punishment of the offeree merely provides a windfall to the offeror and
does not encourage settlement. 
 
Whether a
Section 998 offer is reasonable must be determined by looking at circumstances
when the offer was made. [citations omitted] However, the reasonableness of an
offer depends upon the information used to evaluate it. In many cases,
plaintiff and a defendant will not have the same information when an offer is
made. For this reason, the reasonableness of an offer may lie in the eye of its
beholder.” 
 
(Id.
at 699.)
 
Here,
Defendant made a 998 Offer of a waiver of costs and zero dollars a week after
Defendant served its answer, and before there had been an opportunity for
discovery. Plaintiff notes that eight months later, Defendant objected to
Plaintiff’s 998 as being premature. 
 
After review,
the Court agrees that Defendant’s offer cannot meet the second prong of the Elrod
test. As noted in Elrod:
 
If the offer
is found reasonable by the first test, it must then satisfy a second test:
whether defendant’s information was known or reasonably should have been known
to plaintiff. This second test is necessary because the section 998 mechanism
works only where the offeree has reason to know the offer is a reasonable one.
If the offeree has no reason to know the offer is reasonable, then the offeree
cannot be expected to accept the offer.
 
(Id. at 699.)

 
Here, at the
time the 998 Offer was extended, Plaintiff had no reason to know whether the
offer was a reasonable one. Moreover, Defendant has not moved for sanctions on
the basis that Plaintiff’s claim was frivolous or without merit, and does not
contend that Plaintiff’s claim was baseless. Finally, the ruling granting
Defendant’s motion for summary judgment turned on Plaintiff’s withdrawal of his
original opposition, and his failure to submit admissible expert testimony. As
such, given this fact, alongside the fact that Plaintiff’s claim was not
meritless, and no discovery had been conducted at the time of the 998, the
Court agrees that Defendant’s offer of zero-dollars and a waiver of costs did
not carry with it a reasonable prospect of acceptance. Rather, it appears to be
a nominal or token offer which carried no risk while offering the reward of
being able to later recover expert witness fees. As the Court noted in the People
v. Lockyer (2001) 89 Cal.App.4th 1260, 1271:
 
The pertinent
case law limitation on the operation of section 998 is simply that the offer be
made in good faith: “To effectuate the purpose of the statute, a section 998
offer must be made in good faith to be valid. Good faith requires that the
pretrial offer of settlement be 'realistically reasonable under the
circumstances of the particular case. Normally, therefore, a token or nominal
offer will not satisfy this good faith requirement ....' The offer 'must
carry with it some reasonable prospect of acceptance. One having no expectation
that his or her offer will be accepted will not be allowed to benefit from a
no-risk offer made for the sole purpose of later recovering large expert
witness fees.
 
(emphasis
added.)
 
Accordingly,
the Court concludes that Defendant may not recover expert fees pursuant to 998.

 
As to Item 12
fees, it is not clear whether or not Plaintiff is challenging the entire
$1,222.20 being claimed or just the portion claimed for transcripts. Defendant
concedes that the costs of the transcript for the 10/19/2023 hearing is not
recoverable and will withdraw $232.20 of the requested $1,222.20. However,
Defendant contends that the remaining $990 for court reporter fees are
recoverable. (CCP § 1033.5(a)(11). Chaaban v. Wet Seal, Inc. (2012) 203
Cal.App.4th 49, 58-59.) The Court agrees and strikes the cost of the transcript
fees only. 
 
Based on the
foregoing, the Court strikes Defendant’s costs by $12,979.54. 
 
 
It is so ordered.
