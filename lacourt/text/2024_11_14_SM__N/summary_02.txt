And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies Defendant Ahava Amenra's motion to vacate and set aside the default entered against him on November 2, 2023. Defendant argues that he was surprised to learn of the default and never received copies of the First Amended Complaint. However, the judge finds that due process has been satisfied despite Defendant's lack of actual notice, as substituted service was properly performed by leaving the documents at his mailing address. The judge also relies on the presumption of proper service established by the return of the process server's declaration. Defendant's failure to overcome this presumption by providing sworn testimony about his receipt of the documents leads the judge to deny the motion.
