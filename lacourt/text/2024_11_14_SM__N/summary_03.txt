And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by the judge regarding a motion by Plaintiff Ghusoub Alkhalil for an order compelling responses to his first set of form interrogatories and requests for admissions from Defendant Guardian Angel Locksmith. The judge denies the motion as MOOT (moot) since the defendant has already served its responses. The judge also grants Plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions in the reduced amount of $1,320, payable by the defendants and defense counsel within 30 days of entry of the order. The judge finds that the defendant's failure to timely respond warrants a monetary sanction, but reduces the amount based on the time spent preparing the motions and communicating with counsel.
