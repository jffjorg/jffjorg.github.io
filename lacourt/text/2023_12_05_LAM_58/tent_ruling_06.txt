Discussion
 
Service on the Labor and Workforce Development Agency
 
            Plaintiff provided an e-mail
confirmation that the proposed settlement was electronically submitted to the Labor
and Work Force Development Agency on March 23, 2022, in compliance with Labor
Code section 2699, subdivision (l)(2). (Bokhour Decl., ¶ 55, Ex. C.)
 
Terms of the Settlement
 
            The parties settled this action
through the “Class Action and PAGA Settlement Agreement” (Settlement Agreement).
The Settlement Agreement requires Defendant to pay the total settlement amount
of $358,000.00 (Gross Settlement Amount). The settlement will be effective (and
Defendant’s obligation becomes due) ten days after the Effective Date as
defined by the Settlement Agreement – after the time for objections and appeals
are exhausted.  (Bokhour Decl., Ex. A
[Settlement Agreement], ¶ 74.) Settlement checks will be valid for 180 calendar
days from issuance. Upon expiration, the uncashed checks are cancelled, and the
claim will be deemed void. All unclaimed funds shall be sent to the California
Unclaimed Property Fund in the name of the class member. (Bokhour Decl., Ex. A,
¶ 75.) 
 
            The “Released Claims” are for “all
claims that were alleged in the Action and all claims that could have been
alleged in the Action based on the facts, Labor Codes, Wage Orders and Business
and Professions Codes alleged therein, including all claims that were alleged
in Plaintiff’s PAGA Notice dated September 20, 2021, claims for failure to pay
minimum wages, failure to pay overtime wages and/or failure to pay such wages
at the correct rate(s) of pay, failure to pay all sick time wages, meal and
rest break violations, failure to pay premium pay penalties, failure to provide
accurate itemized wage statements, failure to timely pay all wages upon
separation of employment, failure to reimburse for business expenses, and
unfair and unlawful business practices, including, but not limited to, claims
for injunctive relief, liquidated damages, penalties of any nature, interest,
fees, costs.”  (Bokhour Decl., Ex. A, ¶ 4.)  
 
            The Gross Settlement Amount will
include a $20,000.00 PAGA Payment. (Bokhour Decl., ¶ 50(d)(i).) The Labor and
Workforce Development Agency (LWDA) will receive 75%, or $15,000.00, as the
PAGA penalty, while 25%, or $5,000.00 will be allocated to the Class Members.
The amount will be ascertained from the number of weeks worked by each Class
Member during the Class Period, which is defined as from September 3, 2020, to
the date of preliminary court approval of the Settlement. The Settlement
Administrator will calculate the individual amount on a pro-rata basis. (Bokhour
Decl., ¶ 50(d)(ii).) 
 
            Plaintiff’s counsel also request
attorneys’ fees not to exceed 33% of the Gross Settlement Amount (approximately
$119,333.33) and costs not to exceed $15,000.00. (Bokhour Decl., ¶ 50(g).) In
addition, the Settlement Agreement contemplates an enhancement payment to the
named Plaintiff Evi Herrera Orantes of $10,000.00. (Bokhour Decl., ¶ 50(f).)
 
            The parties request that the Court
designate ILYM Group, Inc. as the Settlement Administrator to administer the
settlement. (Bokhour Decl., ¶ 53 Ex. A, ¶ 36.) Up to $6,000.00 in Settlement
Administrator Costs are allowed under the Settlement Agreement. (Bokhour Decl.,
¶ 50(h).)
 
Class Certification
 
            Plaintiffs seek conditional
certification of the proposed class: “all non-exempt employees who work or
worked for Defendant in California from September 3, 2020 until the date the
Court grants the preliminary approval of the settlement.” (Bokhour Decl., ¶ 2.)
 
            Class certification is appropriate
when “the question is one of a common or general interest, of many persons, or
when parties are numerous, and it is impracticable to bring them all before the
court.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 382.) “The party advocating class treatment must
demonstrate the existence of an ascertainable and sufficiently numerous class,
a well-defined community of interest, and substantial benefits from
certification that render proceeding as a class superior to the alternatives.”  (Brinker
Restaurant Corp. v. Superior Court (2012) 53 Cal. 4th 1004, 1021.) Trial
courts are afforded great discretion in granting or denying certification, and
“ ‘[a]ny valid pertinent reason stated will be sufficient to uphold the order.’
” (Linder v. Thrifty Oil Co. (2000)
23 Cal.4th 429, 435-36.)
 
Ascertainability 
 
            A class is ascertainable “when it is
defined ‘in terms of objective characteristics and common transactional facts’
that make ‘the ultimate identification of class members possible when that identification
becomes necessary.’  [Citation.]” (Noel
v. Thrifty Payless (2019) 7 Cal.5th 955, 980.) 
 
            Here, the evidence is sufficient to
establish that the proposed class is ascertainable.  Plaintiff asserts that Defendant produced information
about the class, including the total number of employees at issue, and the
total workweeks at issue. (Bokhour Decl., ¶ 16.) Thus, the class consists of
approximately 144 class members who can be readily identified through
Defendant’s records. (Bokhour Decl., ¶ 11; Cal. Code Regs., tit. 8 § 11050,
subd. (7)(A).) This proposed class is sufficiently defined “in terms of
objective characteristics and common transactional facts” to be identified, and
the Court finds that the class is ascertainable.  
 
Numerosity 
 
            California Courts have recognized
that “[n]o set number is required as a matter of law for the maintenance of a
class action.”  (Rose v. City of
Hayward (1981) 126 Cal.App.3d 926, 934 (Rose) [surveying cases and
recognizing that classes of ten to forty-two individuals were sufficiently
numerous for a class action], disapproved on unrelated grounds in Noel v.
Thrifty Payless, Inc. (2019) 7 Cal.5th 955.)  
 
            The proposed settlement class is
estimated to be 144 class members. (Bokhour Decl., ¶ 11.)  The class is sufficiently numerous. (See Rose,
supra, 126 Cal.App.3d at pp. 934-935.) 

 
Community of Interest 

 
            “ ‘The community of interest
requirement involves three factors: “(1) predominant common questions of law or
fact; (2) class representatives with claims or defenses typical of the class;
and (3) class representatives who can adequately represent the class.” ’  [Citation.] 
Regarding the first of these factors, [the Supreme Court has] recognized
‘ “[a]s a general rule” ’ that ‘ “if the defendant’s liability can be
determined by facts common to all members of the class, a class will be
certified even if the members must individually prove their damages.” ’  [Citations.] Relatedly, ‘In certifying a
class action, the court must also conclude that litigation of individual
issues, including those arising from affirmative defenses, can be managed
fairly and efficiently.’ [Citation.] Finally, other considerations relevant to
certification ‘include the probability that each class member will come forward
ultimately to prove his or her separate claim to a portion of the total recovery
and whether the class approach would actually serve to deter and redress
alleged wrongdoing.’  [Citation.]” (Noel,
supra, 7 Cal.5th at pp. 968-970.) 
 
            Here, the evidence demonstrates that
(1) the claims at issue pertain to the common provision of meal and rest
periods and payment of minimum and overtime wages (among other things) applicable
to all class members, (2) such Plaintiff’s claims and injuries arise from the
same facts and theories as all other class members, i.e., Defendant’s wage and
hour practices, and (3) such claims are adequately pursued by the Class
Representatives, who experienced the same wage and hour practices as the other
members, understood his duties as representative, was willing to undergo the
risk of litigation, and has no apparent conflict with other class members. (Bokhour
Decl., ¶¶ 18-41; Orantes Decl., ¶¶ 4-9.) 

 
            Defendant does not file an
opposition to Plaintiffs’ motion and does not challenge Plaintiff’s assertions
regarding community of interest. Thus, the Court accepts Plaintiff’s assertions
and finds that a community of interest exists among the Class members.  
 
Settlement Approval 
 
            California Rules of Court, rule 3.769 sets forth the
procedure to evaluate class actions that settle before class certification,
which generally requires court approval. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.769(a).)
Either party to the settlement agreement may move for preliminary approval and
must attach a proposed notice to class members and proposed order. (Cal. Rules
of Court, rule 3.769(c).) Prior to final approval of the settlement, “the court
must conduct an inquiry into the fairness of the proposed settlement.” (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.769(g).)  
 
            In reviewing the terms of a
settlement agreement, the court determines whether the settlement is fair,
reasonable, and adequate to all concerned, and not the product of fraud,
collusion, or overreaching. (Reed v.
United Teachers Los Angeles (2012) 208 Cal.App.4th 322, 337; Nordstrom
Commission Cases (2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 576, 581.) In the context of a
class action settlement, the court considers various factors including whether
(1) the settlement is the result of arm’s length bargaining, (2) investigation
and discovery are sufficient to allow counsel and the court to act
intelligently, (3) counsel is experienced in similar litigation, and (4) the
percentage of objectors is small. (Nordstrom,
at p. 581; Wershba v. Apple Computer, Inc. (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 224, 245;
see also Dunk v. Ford
Motor Co. (1996) 48
Cal.App.4th 1794, 1802 [finding a presumption of fairness to exist if those
four factors are met.].) In
considering the amount of settlement, the Court is mindful that compromise is
inherent and necessary in the settlement process. (Wershba, at p. 250.) The burden of establishing
the fairness and reasonableness of the settlement is on the proponent. (7-Eleven
Owners for Fair Franchising v. Southland Corp. (2000) 85 Cal.App.4th 1135,
1165-66.) 
 
Arm’s Length Bargaining 
 
            Plaintiff’s
counsel attests that the Settlement Agreement was achieved over a mediation
session that was conducted at arm’s-length with employment-law mediator Tripper
Ortman.  (Bokhour Decl., ¶¶ 13, 42.) Counsel states that the
negotiations were “cordial and professional,” but adversarial and
non-collusive. (Bokhour Decl., ¶ 42.)
 
            The
parties do not give the Court any reason to believe that the settlement was not
reached through arm’s length settlement negotiations.¿This factor thus weighs
in favor of a presumption of fairness. 
 
Investigation and Discovery Sufficient to Allow
Counsel and the Courts to Act intelligently 
 
            Mr. Bokhour
attests that the parties engaged in extensive discovery and investigation,
which allowed for proper calculation of the case prior to settlement. (Bokhour Decl., ¶¶ 13, 16, 26.) He stated that there was a
substantial exchange of documents, including Defendant’s production of its applicable policies and procedures, payroll and time keeping
records, size of the Class, compensation policies and practices. (Bokhour Decl., ¶ 16.) Mr.
Bokhour further attests that he used this information to conduct a detailed
risk analysis. (Bokhour Decl., ¶ 16.) This factor weighs in favor of
fairness.¿¿¿ 
 
The Experience of Counsel 
 
            Mehrdad
Bokhour and Jake Finkel attest to their experience in class actions and labor
and employment cases.  
 
            Mr. Bokhour
represents that he has been practicing law since 2012 and his firm has significant
experience in complex employment litigation. (Bokhour Decl., ¶¶ 3-8, 50.) Mr. Bokhour
has handled upwards of 100 class and
representative actions, has been appointed as class counsel and have
successfully litigated and resolved several class actions. (Bokhour Decl., ¶ 50.)
 
            Similarly,
Mr. Finkel attests that a substantial percentage of his practice consists of
wage-and-hour litigation. (Finkel Decl., ¶¶ 5-9.)  
 
            This
factor weighs in favor of a presumption of fairness.
 
Percentage of the Objectors 
 
            The
percentage of objectors cannot be determined¿at this time, and this factor¿does
not weigh in favor or against a presumption of fairness.¿¿¿ 
 
Best Interests of the Class
 
            Even if a presumption of fairness
exists, the court still must “ ‘independently and objectively analyze the
evidence and circumstances before it in order to determine whether the
settlement is in the best interest of those whose claims will be extinguished.’
”  (Kullar
v. Foot Locker Retail, Inc. (2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 116, 130.)  “The well-recognized factors that the trial
court should consider in evaluating the reasonableness of a class action
settlement agreement include ‘the strength of¿plaintiffs’ case, the risk,
expense, complexity and likely duration of further litigation, the risk of
maintaining class action status through trial, the amount offered in
settlement, the extent of discovery completed and the stage of the proceedings,
the experience and views of counsel, the presence of a governmental
participant, and the reaction of the class members to the proposed
settlement.”  [Citation.]  This list “ ‘is not exhaustive and should be
tailored to each case.’ ”  (Id. at
p. 129.)
 
            Plaintiffs’
counsel engaged in a detailed analysis of the investigation and risks
associated with this case. (Bokhour Decl., ¶¶ 26-41.)
 
            Mr. Bokhour
acknowledged Defendant’s defenses: (1) Defendant’s pay practices were neutral
and underpayment was de minimis; (2) Defendant’s meal
and rest period policies and practices were compliant with California law, and
that non-exempt employees were at all times allowed and permitted to take their
meal and rest periods; (3) the waiting time penalty and wage statement claims based on the
underlying meal and rest period violations were unfounded as these violations
did not entitle employees to pursue the derivative penalties under Labor Code
sections 203 and 226; and (4) Plaintiff’s
claims were not suitable for class certification because it involved individualized
inquiries. (Bokhour
Decl., ¶¶ 22-25.)
 
            In
light of those defenses, Plaintiff made corresponding reductions to the
expected exposure. (Bokhour Decl., ¶¶ 26-41.) 
 
With respect to waiting time penalties,
there were approximately 45 Class
Members that separated from their employment with Defendant during the relevant
statutory period. As such, the maximum potential penalty under Labor Code § 201
– 203 is $335,212 (79 employees x 8.0 hours per day x average rate of $17.68 x
30 days). (Bokhour Decl. ¶ 27.) Based on the asserted defenses, Plaintiff applied a 25% risk of defeat at the class
certification stage, and an additional 35% risk of defeat at the summary
judgment stage or on the merits, resulting in the risk adjusted value of
$163,414 for Plaintiff’s waiting time penalty claim. (Bokhour Decl. ¶ 30.)
 
With respect to
Plaintiff’s meal and rest period violation claims, the Class Members worked
55,571 shifts during the Class Period. Based on an alleged 45% violation rate
for the meal period claims and an alleged 33% violation rate for the rest
period claims, the estimated maximum potential damages totaled $442,122 for the
meal period claim and $324,223 for the rest period claim, respectively.
(Bokhour Decl. ¶ 31.) Plaintiff acknowledged the risks and incorporated a
further 60% reduction, which calculates the risk-adjusted value of the meal
period claims to be $114,951 and rest period claims to be $84,298. (Bokhour
Decl. ¶ 34.)
 
Plaintiff estimates that the maximum potential penalties for
the derivative wage statement claim as $143,000 (based on approximately 2,860
allegedly violative wage statements issued during the Class Period). In
calculating Defendant’s exposure, Plaintiff gave Defendant the benefit of
assuming Plaintiff could only obtain the “initial” wage statement penalty of
$50 per violation, for a total of $143,000 in potential wage statement
penalties. Based on Defendant’s defenses, Plaintiff discounted the calculated maximum
exposure by 30% for risk of noncertification, and by an additional 25% for risk
of being unsuccessful on the merits, to arrive at an estimated total of
$75,075. (Bokhour Decl. ¶ 41.)
 
Plaintiff also sought PAGA penalties for each violation for
which they are available and alleged that these penalties can be “stacked.”
Assuming that a PAGA penalty is available in the default amount of $100 per pay
period and is not reduced, Plaintiff determined the maximum potential PAGA
penalty would be $286,000 for the pay periods in the PAGA period. (Bokhour
Decl., ¶ 42.) Plaintiff then discounted the calculated maximum exposure by 80%
for risk of nonmanageability, and by an additional 65% for risk of being
unsuccessful on the merits, to arrive at an estimated total of $20,000.
(Bokhour Decl., ¶ 44.)
 
            The
expected exposure for the wage and hour causes of action and PAGA penalties is
$163,414 + $114,951 + $84,298
+ $75,075 + $20,000 = $457,738.
Therefore, Plaintiffs asserts that the gross settlement amount of $358,000 is
fair and reasonable. (Kullar v. Foot Locker Retail, Inc., supra, 168 Cal.App.4th
at p. 128.) The Court grants preliminary approval as to the class action
settlement, including the allocation of PAGA penalties.
 
Reasonableness of Additional Terms
 
Attorney Fees and Costs
 
            The
Settlement Agreement authorizes Plaintiff’s counsel to request an award of
attorney fees no more than 33% of the Gross Settlement Amount, or approximately
$119,333.33, and actual costs not to exceed $15,000.00. (Bokhour Decl., ¶ 50(g).)
 
            The
one-third fee award is reasonable and consistent with fee awards in class
action cases.¿ (See¿Chavez v. Netflix, Inc.¿(2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 43,
66, fn. 11.) Plaintiff’s counsel indicates that they will submit a request for
attorneys’ fees and costs with its final approval motion. (Mot., 21:25-28.)
 
Class Representatives and Enhancement Payments 
 
            Incentive payments are based on the
expense and risk undertaken by named plaintiffs for the benefit of other class
members.  (Munoz v. BCI Coca-Cola Bottling
Co. of Los Angeles (2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 399, 412.)   
 
            The Settlement Agreement allows for
an enhancement award to the named Plaintiff, not to exceed $10,000.00, that is
included in the Gross Settlement Amount.  (Bokhour Decl., Ex. A, ¶ 50(f).) The named Plaintiff indicates that he has provided “significant
assistance” to counsel on this case; such assistance included providing including
providing factual background for the class and PAGA Complaint; reviewing the
litigation documents; providing information and documentation about Defendant’
policies and practices; participating in phone calls to discuss litigation and
settlement strategy; and reviewing the settlement documents. (Bokhour Decl., ¶
49; Orantes Decl., ¶ 7.) Plaintiff incurred significant risk because he would
have been required to pay Defendant’s costs if he lost in the litigation. (Orantes
Decl., ¶ 8.)
 
            The Settlement Agreement also
provides that named Plaintiff is executing a separate general release of all
claims under Code of Civil Procedure section 1542. (Bokhour Decl., Ex. A, ¶¶
60-62.) The Court finds that the proposed enhancement payment is reasonable
based on the declaration from named Plaintiff. 

 
Notice Procedures 
 
            “The notice given should have a
reasonable chance of reaching a substantial percentage of the class members”
who do not search for such litigation.  (Cartt
v. Superior Court (1975) 50 Cal.App.3d 960, 974.)  If the court grants preliminary approval of
the settlement, it sets a final approval hearing and provides for notice to be
given to the class. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.769(e).) “The notice must
contain an explanation of the proposed settlement and procedures for class
members to follow in filing written objections to it and in arranging to appear
at the settlement hearing and state any objections to the proposed settlement.”
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.769(f).) 
The trial court “ ‘ “has virtually complete discretion as to the manner
of giving notice to class members.” 
[Citation.]’ ”  (Cellphone Fee
Termination Cases (2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 1380, 1390.)   
 
            Plaintiffs attached a copy of the
proposed “Notice of Settlement, of Class Action” as Exhibit B. (Bokhour Decl.,
¶¶ 64-78, Ex. B.) The Court has reviewed the proposed notice and finds that it
will provide sufficient notice to the class members under California Rule of
Court, rule 3.766. The notice provides a background of the case, exclusion
procedures including instructions on how to object (file written objection with
Settlement Administrator), estimated payment, a statement that the judgment
will bind all members who do not request exclusion, and a statement that a class
member may appear through counsel without requesting exclusion.  Otherwise, participation in the Settlement is
automatic and Class Members must affirmatively opt out if they choose not to
participate. 
 
            Within 7 days after preliminary
approval is granted by the Court, Defendant will provide data to the Settlement
Administrator, who will obtain all class members’ addresses (and other
information) and send the notice within 15 days after receipt of the data. If
any mail is non-delivered, the Settlement Administrator will conduct a
skip-trace and re-mail. (Bokhour Decl., Ex. A, ¶ 68.) The Notice will be sent
in both English and Spanish. (Bokhour Decl., Ex. A ¶ 67.)
 
Settlement Administrator Fees, Taxes, and Cy Pres
 
            The parties have agreed to engage ILYM
Group, Inc. (ILYM) as the Settlement Administrator
and requests preliminary court approval of $6,000.00 for administration
costs.  (Bokhour Decl., ¶ 55, Ex. B.) ILYM
will mail the Notice of Settlement Agreement to all class members, review and
calculate the amounts due to class members, issue and send out settlement
checks, and other administrative tasks. (Bokhour Decl., Ex. A, ¶¶ 64-78.)
 
            In documents accompanying a request
for final approval, the Court will require more information on the
qualifications and experience of ILYM, and a statement of the various tasks it
will undertake, particularly providing notice to class members.
 
            The Court preliminarily approves the
requested $6,000.00.
 
            As for taxes, the Settlement
Agreement provides that all awards will be reported as alleged “wages,”
penalties, and interests in which either the Defendant or the Settlement
Administrator will issue IRS forms W-2 or 1099. (Bokhour Decl., Ex. A, ¶ 49(e),
65.)
 
            Residue from uncashed Settlement
Award checks after the 180-day check cashing period expires will be sent to the
California Unclaimed Property Fund in the name of the class member.  (Bokhour Decl., Ex. A, ¶ 75.) 
 
Conclusion 
 
            The Court
preliminarily approves the remainder of the settlement and sets a Final
Approval Hearing date on _________, 2024 at _____a.m. in Department 58 of this
Court on Plaintiffs’ Motion for Order Granting Final Approval of Class Action
and PAGA Settlement and Judgment.
