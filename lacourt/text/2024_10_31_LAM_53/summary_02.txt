And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted an ex parte application by Mulgrew Aircraft Components, Inc. to file certain documents under seal. The documents, Exhibit O and Exhibit O-2, contain confidential and privileged information, including trade secrets and proprietary documents belonging to the defendant and its customers, vendors, and employees. The court has found that there exists an overriding interest to seal these documents, including the protection of trade secrets and the prevention of potential harm to the defendant and its stakeholders. The court has ordered that the unredacted version of the application be filed under seal and has directed the defendant to electronically file a redacted version of the application that identifies the redacted materials as "Public-Redacts materials from sealed record." The court has also ordered the defendant to give notice of this ruling.
