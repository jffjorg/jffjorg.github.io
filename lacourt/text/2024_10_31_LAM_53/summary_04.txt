And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the plaintiff's motion to continue trial and reschedule discovery and motion dates. The plaintiff, Rosa Marie Samples, as trustee of the Maria A. Gonzalez Living Trust and executrix of the Last Will and Testament of Maria A. Gonzalez, deceased, is seeking to continue trial from November 20, 2024 to at least May 14, 2025, or any date thereafter convenient to the court, and to reopen discovery to follow the new trial date. The judge finds that the plaintiff has not shown good cause for the continuance and that the remaining defendants would be prejudiced by a continuance. The judge also notes that the plaintiff's substitution of counsel on July 29, 2024, provides counsel with over three months to prepare for trial, and that the parties have not completed discovery. The judge further finds that the case has been pending for approximately three-and-a-half years and that trial is set for November 20, 2024, less than 30 days after the date of the hearing on this motion.
