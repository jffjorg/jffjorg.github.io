And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendants' motion to quash service of the summons and complaint. The plaintiff is ordered to properly serve the summons and complaint on the defendants, which may be done by posting and mailing pursuant to the June 6, 2023 order. The plaintiff is also ordered to give notice of the court's order and file proof of service within five calendar days of the court's order. The court finds that the plaintiff failed to comply with the posting and mailing requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 415.45 and that the proofs of service submitted by the plaintiff do not establish that the summons and complaint were properly served on the defendants.
