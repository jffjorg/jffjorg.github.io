 Case Number:  23PSCV00835    Hearing Date:   October 12, 2023    Dept:  6 CASE NAME:  Staccia  Lee v. Thomas Harrison, et al.Defendants Thomas  Harrison and Thomas William Harrison’s Motion to Quash Service of Summons TENTATIVE  RULINGThe Court Grants the motion to quash service of the Summons  and Complaint. Plaintiff  is ordered to properly serve the Summons and Complaint on Defendants and may do  so by posting and mailing pursuant to the June 6, 2023 Order. Plaintiff is ordered to give notice of the Court’s order and file  proof of service of same within five calendar days of the Court’s order. BACKGROUNDThis is an unlawful detainer  action. On March 16, 2023, Plaintiff Staccia Lee (Plaintiff) filed this action  against Defendants Thomas Harrison, Thomas William Harrison (collectively,  Defendants), and Does 1 through 10 for unlawful detainer. On April 11, 2023, Defendants filed a motion to quash  service of summons. On June 7, 2023, Plaintiff opposed the motion. On September  14, 2023, Defendants withdrew the motion. On September 15, 2023, Defendants filed  another motion to quash service of summons. On September 28, 2023, Plaintiff  opposed the motion. On October 6, 2023, Defendants replied. LEGAL STANDARDA  defendant may move to quash service on the ground that the court lacks  jurisdiction by filing a noticed motion to quash the service of summons at any  time before the expiration of its time to plead. (Code Civ. Proc., § 418.10,  subd. (a)(1).) When a defendant files a motion to quash, the burden is on the  plaintiff to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that service of the  summons and complaint was proper. (Summers v. McClanahan (2006) 140  Cal.App.4th 403, 413 (“When a defendant challenges the court's personal  jurisdiction on the ground of improper service of process ‘the burden is on the  plaintiff to prove the existence of jurisdiction by proving, inter alia, the  facts requisite to an effective service.’”)) PRELIMINARY ISSUES            Defendants’  reply papers contained an additional declaration. Generally, new evidence is not permitted on reply unless it fills  in gaps in the evidence created by the opposing party’s opposition and is not  raising new substantive issues for the first time; otherwise, a further hearing  would be required to permit the opposing party to respond. (Jay v. Mahaffey (2013)  218 Cal.App.4th 1522, 1537-1538.) Thus, to the extent the new evidence  submitted does not respond to issues raised in the opposition, the Court  declines to consider it.ANALYSIS             Plaintiff contends that  Defendants’ motion is untimely under Code of Civil Procedure section 418.10,  subdivision (a), which provides that a motion to quash service of summons must  be served and filed on or before the last day to plead, unless otherwise  extended by court order. (Code Civ. Proc., § 418.10, subd. (a).) The Court declines  to deny the motion on the grounds that it is untimely. “California is a jurisdiction where the original service of process, which  confers jurisdiction, must conform to statutory requirements or all that  follows is void.” Honda Motor Co. v. Superior Court (1992) 10 Cal.App.4th  1043, 1048. “Until statutory requirements are satisfied, the court lacks  jurisdiction over a defendant.” (Id.) Defendants did not voluntarily consent  to the Court’s jurisdiction by filing an Answer, instead they timely filed a  motion to quash the summons and complaint on April 11, 2023, which was originally  set to be heard on June 21, 2023. On May 11, 2023, the case was reassigned and  the hearing on the motion was continued to August 14, 2023. Plaintiff opposed  the motion on June 7, 2023 on grounds that the motion was premature because  service had not been effected. Plaintiff did not file the proofs of service  until July 20, 2023. On August 8, 2023, the Court continued the August 14, 2023  hearing date to September 25, 2023. Although Defendants waited until September  14, 2023 to withdraw the original motion, they immediately refiled the motion  to quash. The Court finds good cause to allow the motion to quash.Defendants  seek to quash service of the Summons on the grounds that Plaintiff failed to  comply with the posting and mailing requirements of Code of Civil Procedure  section 415.45. Since this is a motion to quash service of summons, the initial  burden of proof falls on Plaintiff to prove that service was proper. (Summers, supra, 140 Cal.App.4th at p. 413.) Plaintiff  contends that service was proper, as evidenced by the May 30, 2023 order  approving Plaintiff’s request to perform service by posting and mailing, as  well as the proofs of service filed with the Court on July 20, 2023. (Opp., Exs.  B, C.) Plaintiff contends these proofs of service establish that the summons  and complaint were served by posting and mailing on Defendants on June 14,  2023. The Court disagrees.             As Defendants contend, per Evidence  Code section 647, the proofs of service are not entitled to a presumption of  the truth stated therein due to the fact they were not effected by a registered  process server. (Evid. Code § 647.) Moreover, the Court’s order required that Defendants  “be served by posting a copy of the summons and complaint on the premises in a  manner most likely to give actual notice to the defendants, and by immediately  mailing, by certified mail, a copy of the summons and complaint to the  defendant(s) at his/her last known address.” (Opp., Exh. B.) Putting aside the  dispute as to whether posting on the gate was most likely to give actual notice  to the defendants, Plaintiff fails to produce evidence that the Summons and  Complaint were mailed to Defendants, by certified mail, at Defendants’ last known  address. The proofs of service only state that service was by posting and  mailing on June 14, 2023. (Opp., Exh. C.) There is nothing in the proofs of  service or the declaration of Cindy Tran indicating the address to which the  Summons and Complaint were mailed, or that the documents were mailed by  certified mail. Thus, Plaintiff fails to provide evidence that service was  proper.             Based on the foregoing, the Court Grants  the motion to quash service of the Summons and Complaint. CONCLUSIONThe Court Grants the motion to quash service of the Summons  and Complaint. Plaintiff  is ordered to properly serve the Summons and Complaint on Defendants and may do  so by posting and mailing pursuant to the June 6, 2023 Order.           Plaintiff is ordered to give notice of the Court’s order and file proof of service of same within five calendar days of the Court’s order.
