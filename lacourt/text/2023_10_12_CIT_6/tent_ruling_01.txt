On July 27, 2020, this action was filed. On December 23, 2022, the operative Second Amended Complaint was filed by Plaintiffs Deysi Valdez, Homero Gochez, Jonathan Campos, Miguel Angel Valdez, by and through his Guardian ad Litem, Deysi Valdez, Ana Ayard, Jose Ayard, Francisco Lucas, Maria Castrejon, Kerum Lucas, Francisco Lucas Castrejon, Myriam Rodriguez, Daniela Nicol Dominguez Rodriguez, by and through her Guardian ad Litem, Myriam Rodriguez, Patricia Guzman, Jose Luis Lopez, William Martinez, Christian Castrejon, Daniel F. Hudson, and Miriam Ayard, against Defendant KK Del Rosa LLC and Does 1 through 50, alleging causes of action for failure to provide habitable dwelling, breach of covenant and right to quiet enjoyment and possession of the property, nuisance, and negligence. On August 10, 2023, Miguel and Daniela each filed a petition for approval of compromise of claim or action or disposition of proceeds of judgment for minor or person with a disability. DISCUSSIONPetition for Approval of Compromise for Person With A Disability (Miguel Angel Valdez)Claimant Miguel Angel Valdez (Miguel), by and through his Guardian ad Litem, Deysi Valdez, i.e., the petitioner for Miguel, has agreed to settle his claims against Defendant KK Del Rosa LLC, in exchange for $10,666.66, $8,000.00 of which will go to Miguel. If approved, $2,666.66 will be used to pay attorney’s fees, leaving a balance of $8,000.00 for Miguel, to be directly deposited into a special needs trust account with CalABLE belonging to Miguel.Court approval is required for all settlements of claims of a minor, person who lacks legal capacity to make decisions, or person for whom a conservator has been appointed. (Probate Code, §§ 3500, 3600, et seq.; Code Civ. Proc., § 372.) The Court has reviewed the proposed settlement for Miguel and would find it to be fair and reasonable. Further, the Court finds the proposed attorney’s fees, equaling 25% of Miguel’s settlement proceeds, would be fair and reasonable in light of the case having progressed for three years before settling.However, the Court notes that Miguel’s petition has some discrepancies. First, paragraph 10, subdivision (c) of Miguel’s petition states that the settlement amount would be $10,066.66, but other parts indicate the settlement amount is $10,666.66. (Miguel’s Petition, ¶¶ 10, subd. (c), 16, subd. (a), Attachment 11b(3) & 11b(6).) Second, paragraph 13 of Miguel’s petition is incomplete, as no boxes are checked and no amounts are provided as required. (Id., ¶ 13.) Third, Attachment 4, the Settlement Agreement and Attachment 11b(3) & 11b(6) to the petition all state that there are nineteen tenants/plaintiffs, but Attachment 11b5 only lists 17 plaintiffs or claimants. Finally, the proposed order approving compromise of claim or action or disposition of proceeds of judgment for minor or person with disability submitted with Miguel’s petition is incomplete. Specifically, paragraph 3, subdivision of the proposed order fails to provide Miguel’s date of birth. Based on the foregoing, the Court DENIES Miguel’s petition without prejudice. Petition for Minor’s Compromise (Daniela Nicol Dominguez Rodriguez)Claimant Daniela Nicol Dominguez Rodriguez (Daniela), by and through her Guardian ad Litem, Myriam Rodriguez, i.e., the petitioner for Daniela, has agreed to settle her claims against Defendant KK Del Rosa LLC, in exchange for $10,066.66, $8,000.00 of which will go to Daniela. If approved, $2,666.66 will be used to pay attorney’s fees, leaving a balance of $8,000.00 for Daniela, to be deposited into a blocked account until Daniela reaches the age of majority. Daniela’s petition for compromise is largely identical to Miguel’s petition addressed above, and contains some of the same discrepancies, namely conflicting information regarding the total settlement amount. While paragraphs 10 and 16 of the petition provide that the settlement amount is $10,066.66, this does not compute to $8,000.00 after deducting $2,666.66 in attorney’s fees. Paragraph 13 of Daniela’s petition is also incomplete. Further, Attachment 11b5 to the petition only lists 17 plaintiffs or claimants, while Attachment 4, the Settlement Agreement and Attachment 11b(3) & 11b(6) to the petition all state that there are nineteen tenants/plaintiffs.Based on the foregoing, the Court DENIES Daniela’s petition without prejudice. CONCLUSIONThe Court DENIES Miguel’s petition without prejudice. The Court DENIES Daniela’s petition without prejudice. Miguel and Daniela are ordered to provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file proof of service of same within five days of the Court’s order.
