And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the petitions for approval of compromise for Miguel Angel Valdez and Daniela Nicol Dominguez Rodriguez, both minors or persons with disabilities, and has denied both petitions without prejudice. The court found that the proposed settlement agreements for each claimant were fair and reasonable, but noted several discrepancies and incomplete information in the petitions. Specifically, the court noted that the settlement amount for Miguel was listed as both $10,066.66 and $10,666.66, and that paragraph 13 of Miguel's petition was incomplete. Similarly, the court noted that the settlement amount for Daniela was listed as $10,066.66, but did not compute to the amount to be paid to her after deducting attorney's fees. The court also noted that both petitions contained incomplete information regarding the number of plaintiffs and claimants. As a result, the court denied the petitions without prejudice, ordering Miguel and Daniela to provide notice of the court's ruling and file proof of service within five days.
