Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in YAML format:

* Hearing Date: October 7, 2024
* Dept: B
* Court: Superior Court of the State of California, County of Los Angeles

**Parties**

* Plaintiff: Lisa Steinmetz
* Defendants: City of Los Angeles, City of Calabasas, and DOES 1 through 100
* Cross-Defendants: Shaban Sedaghati and Tamara Sedaghati Revocable Trust, M.D. Co. Tr. Mottahedeh Trust
* Cross-Complainant: Cleanstreet, Inc.

**Facts**

* On March 10, 2021, Plaintiff filed a complaint against the Defendants for premises liability.
* On June 4, 2021, Calabasas filed a cross-complaint against Los Angeles, the County of Los Angeles, and MOES 1 through 25 for indemnity and contribution.
* On August 26, 2021, Calabasas filed a first amended cross-complaint for indemnity and contribution, adding Cleanstreet as a cross-defendant.
* On July 26, 2023, Cleanstreet filed a motion for leave to file a cross-complaint against the Sedaghati Trust and the Mottahedeh Trust.
* On March 6, 2024, Cleanstreet filed a cross-complaint against the Sedaghati Trust and the Mottahedeh Trust for indemnity and contribution.
* On June 28, 2024, the Mottahedeh Trust filed a motion for summary judgment or, in the alternative, summary adjudication against Cleanstreet's cross-complaint.

**Legal Standards**

* The court applies a three-step analysis to review a motion for summary judgment: (1) identify the issues framed by the pleadings, (2) determine whether the moving party has met their initial burden, and (3) determine whether the opposition has demonstrated the existence of a triable, material factual issue.

**Discussion**

* The Mottahedeh Trust moves for summary judgment or, in the alternative, summary adjudication on all three causes of action alleged in Cleanstreet's cross-complaint.
* The Mottahedeh Trust meets their initial burden as to all three causes of action.
* Cleanstreet's claims for indemnity and contribution fail as a matter of law because the Mottahedeh Trust did not own, control, or maintain the dangerous condition that allegedly caused Plaintiff's injuries.
* The County of Los Angeles, as the easement holder, is liable for the pool of water resulting from negligently maintained storm drains on its easement.

**Conclusion**

* No triable issue of material fact exists as to Mottahedeh Trust's liability for the formation of water that caused Plaintiff's injuries.
* Mottahedeh Trust's motion for summary judgment is GRANTED.

**Significant Statements**

* "Unless the prospective indemnitor and indemnitee are jointly and severally liable to the plaintiff, there is no basis for indemnity."
* "In identifying the party vulnerable to a verdict, control dominates over title. 'The crucial element is control.'"
* "The right to obstruct a public street to construct necessary public improvements carries with it a corresponding duty to erect adequate barriers, lights, and warning devices to protect those who travel the street from injury."
