And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to dismiss on the ground of forum non conveniens. The defendant argued that the case should be heard in Egypt, where the parties entered into a forum selection clause, rather than in California. The judge found that the alternative forum is suitable and that the plaintiff has not shown that the remedies available in Egypt are insufficient.

The judge also found that the plaintiff's claims are not outside the scope of the arbitration proceedings in Egypt and that the Court of Appeal in Egypt has jurisdiction over the dispute. Finally, the judge concluded that the private and public interest factors favor a forum in Egypt.

The plaintiff alleged that the defendant breached the agreement and that the defendant had entered into the agreement without reading it or consulting with a lawyer. The arbitrators ruled in favor of the defendant, and the plaintiff appealed. The Court of Appeal in Egypt affirmed the arbitrators' decision.

The defendant argued that the plaintiff had entered into the agreement freely and voluntarily, and that the plaintiff had failed to identify the witnesses who would be necessary to prove their claims. The plaintiff argued that the remedies available in Egypt are insufficient and that the court should deny the motion to dismiss. However, the judge found that the plaintiff had not shown that the alternative forum is unsuitable.
