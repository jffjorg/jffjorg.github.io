The Court found that the forum selection clause was entered into freely and voluntarily, and that the remedies available in Egypt are sufficient. The Court also found that the claims in the complaint are not outside the scope of the arbitration proceedings in Egypt. As a result, the Court has determined that there was a suitable forum in Egypt and that the dispute can be resolved there. The Court has granted Defendant's motion to dismiss and has ordered the moving party to give notice.
