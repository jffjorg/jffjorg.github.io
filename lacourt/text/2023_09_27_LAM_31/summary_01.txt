The judge grants the defendant's motion to take a subsequent deposition of Mark A. Williams. The court finds that there is good cause to take a second deposition of Williams due to his recent accusations against the plaintiff and its counsel, which are directly relevant to the claims and defenses in the action. The deposition is limited to 4 hours and will allow the defendant to inquire about Williams' claims of embezzlement by the plaintiff's executive director, falsified evidence by the plaintiff's counsel, and Williams' identity as the plaintiff's executive director. The court rejects the plaintiff's argument that the discovery sought is not relevant to any issue at trial and is simply aberrant behavior by Williams. The judge finds that the defendant is entitled to discovery on the issue of Williams' claims to make its own determination of whether or not his claims are credible.

## Summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The judge has granted the defendant's request to take a second deposition of Mark A. Williams.  

The judge found "good cause" for this deposition based on several factors:

*  **Recent Allegations:** Williams has made recent accusations against the plaintiff's Executive Director (Noreen McClendon) and the plaintiff's counsel, alleging financial misconduct and document falsification. These allegations are directly relevant to the defendant's legal defense.
* **Key Witness:** Williams is a crucial witness for the plaintiff, having worked there for 29 years and being a board member. The defendant argues that understanding the truthfulness of Williams's claims is essential to their case.
* **Financial Claims:** The financial aspects of the case, including allegations of misused funds and inability to pay for field replacements, are central to the defendant's mitigation of costs argument.

The judge acknowledged that these allegations are new and that the defendant was aware of the conflict between Williams and the plaintiff at the time of the first deposition. However, the judge determined that the new information and the importance of Williams's testimony warrant a second deposition. 


The judge limited the second deposition to a maximum of 4 hours.

```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion for leave to take a subsequent deposition of Mark A. Williams. The defendant seeks to depose Williams again because Williams has made new accusations against the plaintiff and its counsel, which are relevant to the claims and defenses in the case. The judge finds that there is good cause for a second deposition because Williams' claims and accusations are directly relevant to the case and could impact the outcome of the trial. The judge also finds that the defendant needs additional time to fairly depose Williams, but limits the deposition to no more than 4 hours.

English text:
The tentative ruling concerns Defendants' motion for leave to take a subsequent deposition of Mark A. Williams, a former employee of the Plaintiff and a key fact witness for the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff opposes the motion, arguing that the discovery Defendants seek is not relevant to any issue at trial and simply reflects aberrant behavior by Williams, which is not admissible at trial under Evidence Code Section 352 and case law regarding alleged bad acts. The Court finds that there is good cause for a second deposition of Williams. First, as to Plaintiff's claim that Williams is engaging in aberrant behavior, the defense is entitled to discovery on the issue of Williams's claims to make its own determination of whether or not his claims are credible. Second, regardless of the truth of Williams's accusations, Williams and McClendon are the two key fact witnesses for Plaintiff, and Defendant contends one if them is being untruthful, and thus the character of a witness for the trait of honesty and truthfulness is relevant and is fodder for cross-examination. Moreover, as stated in previous rulings by this Court, the claims relating to Plaintiff's finances are relevant to Defendants' defense of mitigation of costs. Even if Plaintiff is not claiming they could not afford to pay for replacement of the field, as Defendants point out, Defendants are asserting that Plaintiff failed to mitigate costs by paying for it, even if they were not obligated to under the contract. The Court grants Defendants' motion and allows them to take a subsequent deposition of Williams for no more than 4 hours.
