And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendant's motion to take a subsequent deposition of Mark A. Williams. The court finds that there is good cause to take a second deposition of Williams due to his recent accusations against the plaintiff and its counsel, which are directly relevant to the claims and defenses in the action. The deposition is limited to 4 hours and will allow the defendant to inquire about Williams' claims of embezzlement by the plaintiff's executive director, falsified evidence by the plaintiff's counsel, and Williams' identity as the plaintiff's executive director. The court rejects the plaintiff's argument that the discovery sought is not relevant to any issue at trial and is simply aberrant behavior by Williams. The judge finds that the defendant is entitled to discovery on the issue of Williams' claims to make its own determination of whether or not his claims are credible.
