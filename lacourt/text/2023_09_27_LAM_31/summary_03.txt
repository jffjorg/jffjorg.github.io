The Judge issued a tentative ruling on September 27, 2023, regarding a motion by the Plaintiff to deem admitted certain matters in requests for admissions, as well as a request for sanctions. The Judge denied both motions. The Plaintiff propounded requests for admissions on May 17, 2023, and responses were due by June 18, 2023, but none were received. The Defendant argued that its prior counsel had passed away on May 28, 2023, and that the Plaintiff's motion failed to provide proof of service of the discovery. The Judge found that the motion could not be granted because there was no proof of service showing that the requests for admission were ever served on the Defendant. The Judge also denied the request for sanctions, finding that the Defendant's failure to respond to discovery was a misuse of the discovery process, but that the Defendant's current counsel had subsequently served responses to the requests for admission.

## English Summary

The Judge's tentative ruling denies both the Plaintiff's motion to have matters in requests for admissions deemed admitted and the request for sanctions against the Defendant. The Judge found that the Plaintiff failed to provide proof of service showing that the requests for admissions were ever properly served on the Defendant. While the Plaintiff argues that proof of service is attached to their reply, it is actually for the motion itself, not the discovery requests. 

Furthermore, the motion appears moot as the Defendant has now provided responses to the requests for admissions after learning about the pending motion.  Therefore, the Judge denied both requests.
