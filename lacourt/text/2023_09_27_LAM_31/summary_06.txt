## Tentative Ruling Summary 

**Case Number:** 23STCV11510
**Hearing Date:** September 27, 2023
**Dept:** 31 

**Plaintiff's Name:** Not specified in the document 
**Defendant's Name:** Alvand (likely a person)

**Intentions:**

* **Defendant:** To avoid paying Plaintiff for work on the Amtrak contract.

**Facts:**

* Plaintiff worked on and won the Amtrak contract for Defendant.
* Defendant allegedly promised to pay Plaintiff profits from the contract but did not intend to uphold the promise.

**Disputes:**

* Whether Defendant breached an implied-in-fact contract with Plaintiff.
* Whether Defendant's actions constitute negligent misrepresentation.
* Whether Defendant's actions constitute intentional misrepresentation.

**Acts:**

* Plaintiff performed work on the Amtrak contract.
* Defendant allegedly made promises to pay Plaintiff.

**Agreements:**

*  Potential implied-in-fact contract based on conduct.
*  Potential oral contract (mentioned but not the focus of the ruling).

**Laws:**

* **Economic Loss Rule:** This rule generally prevents recovery in tort for purely economic losses stemming from a breach of contract. However, exceptions exist for fraud.
* **Fraud:** Requires misrepresentation of a material fact with knowledge of falsity, intent to induce reliance, justifiable reliance, and resulting damage.
* **Negligent Misrepresentation:** Similar to fraud, but the misrepresentation is made without reasonable ground for believing it to be true.

**Case Citations:**

* Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740
* Taylor v. City of Los Angeles Dept. of Water and Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216

* Collins v. eMachines, Inc. (2011) 202 Cal.App.4th 249


**Significant Statements:**

*  The judge overruled the demurrer to the breach of implied-in-fact contract and negligent misrepresentation causes of action.
*  The judge sustained the demurrer to the intentional misrepresentation cause of action without leave to amend.
*  The judge found that Plaintiff's complaint sufficiently alleged facts to support a claim for breach of implied-in-fact contract.
* The judge found that the Plaintiff's negligent misrepresentation claim could proceed despite the economic loss rule. 



**English Summary:**

The judge partially denied the Defendant's request to dismiss the Plaintiff's lawsuit. The judge allowed the Plaintiff's claims for breach of an implied contract and negligent misrepresentation to proceed. However, the judge dismissed the Plaintiff's claim for intentional misrepresentation because it was considered duplicative of another claim. The judge explained their reasoning, stating that the Plaintiff had adequately alleged facts to support the implied contract claim and that the economic loss rule did not bar the negligent misrepresentation claim.
