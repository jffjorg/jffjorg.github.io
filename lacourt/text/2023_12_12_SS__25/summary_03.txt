And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling by the judge reschedules the hearing on the judgment creditor's motion to compel discovery, which was originally set for December 12, 2023, to January 24, 2024 at 10:00 AM in Department 25 at the Spring Street Courthouse. The reason for the continuance is due to the court's unavailability on December 12, 2023, and calendar congestion. The judicial assistant is directed to notify the counsel for the judgment creditor, who must then give notice to any party entitled to notice and file proof of service within 2-court days.
