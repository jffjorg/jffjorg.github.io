And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling addresses a dispute over a subpoena issued to T-mobile for phone records of Cross-claimant Anastasiia Arseneva. The subpoena seeks records from February 20, 2022, to March 5, 2022, including phone location data, call records, and text messages. The Cross-claimant objects to the subpoena, arguing it seeks to harass her and infringe on her privacy rights. The Judge finds that the records are relevant to establishing whether an employment agreement includes forged signatures from Cross-Defendants, and therefore grants the subpoena in part, limiting it to February 24 to March 1, 2022. The Judge also declines to award sanctions.
