And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Plaintiff Jehan Zeb Mir's motion for reconsideration of the motion for sanctions. The motion for sanctions was filed against Mir for filing frivolous motions for reconsideration. Mir argues that the different facts are that the Defendant did not inform the Court that the motion for reconsideration was denied without prejudice, allowing Mir to refile the application to vacate the prefiling order. However, Mir did not explain why he did not produce this evidence before. Mir also argues that the different law is that he is entitled to relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (d) because the September 2, 2022 order about the motion for reconsideration was not stamped. However, Mir did not explain how this law relates to the motion for sanctions. The judge concludes that the motion for reconsideration is denied because Mir did not present new facts, circumstances, or law to support his motion. The judge orders Defendant to give notice of the ruling.
