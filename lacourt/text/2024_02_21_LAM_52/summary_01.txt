The court has issued a tentative ruling on three motions filed by Plaintiff Raphael Cohen against Defendant BMW of North America, LLC. The first motion is to compel Defendant to respond to written discovery requests. The court grants this motion and orders Defendant to serve verified responses without objections to Plaintiff's form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for production within 60 days.

The second motion is for an order deeming admitted the truth of facts and genuineness of documents in requests for admission. The court grants this motion in part, but only as to sanctions, and orders Defendant and its counsel to pay Plaintiff $2,846.75 in sanctions within 60 days.

The third motion is to compel deposition attendance and production of documents of Defendant's person(s) most knowledgeable. The court grants this motion and orders Defendant to produce its person(s) most knowledgeable for deposition on all 26 matters of examination and to produce the documents requested in all 41 categories within 60 days.

The court also reduces the sanctions by 1 hour at $695 hourly, as Plaintiff did not reasonably incur all expenses claimed.
