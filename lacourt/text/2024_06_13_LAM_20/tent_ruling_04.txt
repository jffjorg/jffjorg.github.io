This is an action in which Plaintiffs David and Rosalie Alaniz allege they were sold a defective vehicle, which had structural damage from a prior accident.  Plaintiffs and Austra Motors, Inc. have settled this matter and have agreed that Plaintiffs may request fees and costs by motion.  (Civ. Code §§ 1780(e), 1794(d).)  Plaintiffs now move for $99,469 in attorneys’ fees.No opposition was filed.The lodestar figure was calculated as follows:   The Court, in the exercise of its discretion, will reduce the hourly rate of Barry to $600 and the rate of Babbitt to $550.  This is a total deduction of $6,364. Furthermore, an excessive amount of time was spent on the instant Motion.  Thus, a $3,600 (6 hours at $600 per hour) deduction will be made. Finally, the Court, in the exercise of its discretion, will make an additional 5% reduction of the remaining lodestar figure. In sum, the Motion for Attorneys’ Fees is granted in part.  The Court awards $85,029.75 in fees.Moving party to give notice.If counsel do not submit on the tentative, they are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
