Village Expansion Borrower, LLC v. Johnson, et al., Case
No. 24PSCV00992


 
Plaintiff
Claremont Village Expansion Borrower, LLC’s Application for Default Judgment is
DENIED without prejudice.
 
Background
Plaintiff Claremont Village Expansion Borrower, LLC (“Plaintiff”)
alleges as follows: 
On August 23, 2012, Plaintiff, as landlord, and
Duang Dao Johnson (“Johnson”) and Bundid Thammniyai (“Thammniyai”) (together,
“Defendants”), as tenants, entered into a written Shopping Center Lease
(“Lease”) regarding the commercial premises located at 201 N. Indian Hill
Blvd., Suite 100 in Claremont (“subject property”). The Lease was subsequently
amended by a written First Amendment of Lease dated October 2017, wherein the
base rent was adjusted and the lease term was extended through January 4, 2023.
On or about August 14, 2023, Defendants vacated the subject property. At the
time of vacating, Defendants were delinquent in the payment of rent and/or
other lease obligations.
On March 28, 2024, Plaintiff filed a complaint,
asserting a cause of action against Defendants and Does 1-100 for breach of
written lease.
On October 1, 2024, the Clerk entered default
against Johnson; that day, Plaintiff dismissed Thammniyai, without prejudice.
Pending before the Court is Plaintiff’s Application for
Default Judgment.
 
Discussion
Plaintiff’s Application for Default Judgment is denied without
prejudice. The following defects are noted:
The Lease reflects that there was a security deposit of
$4,838.91. (See Section 1, Page 1). The Court queries whether or not the
security deposit has been applied to the amount outstanding and requests that
Plaintiff address the disposition of that deposit.
Accordingly, the application is denied without prejudice
and Plaintiff should submit a revised default judgment packet that addresses
the aforementioned issue.
