Summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the Defendant's Motion to Compel Arbitration and Stay the Action. The Court initially granted the motion on August 2, 2024, but has now stricken that order due to the Defendant's failure to meet its initial burden of proof. The Defendant failed to present any facts to show how it is related to NACA, the contracting party in the arbitration agreement. As a result, the Court has denied the motion to compel arbitration and stay the action.
