  Case Number:  20STCV48116    Hearing Date:   October 30, 2023    Dept:  31 DEPT:   31 OSC DATE:  10/30/2023 CASE NAME/NUMBER:  20STCV48116 AMALIA AGUILAR vs IRVIN SANCHEZ, et al.  TENTATIVE  On 7/5/2023, the Court previously denied Plaintiff’s request for default judgment. Plaintiff was ordered to submit a new default package correcting those defects no later than 8/21/2023. (Min. Order, July 5, 2023.) Plaintiff was warned that failure to do so may result in the imposition of sanctions, including monetary sanctions and/or dismissal. (Ibid.)  Plaintiff has failed to submit a new default judgment package by the aforementioned date. Furthermore, there appears to be no efforts by Plaintiff since the rejection to cure the previously identified defects.    Plaintiff has failed to show cause why sanctions should not be imposed for failure to comply with the Court’s prior order and for failure to prosecute. Therefore, the Court imposes monetary sanctions of $250, payable within 30 days.   No later than 11/13/2023, Plaintiff is to submit a new default judgment package correcting the previously identified defects. Further, Plaintiff is placed on notice that failure to do so may result in dismissal of Plaintiff’s action at the next hearing date.   The OSC re entry of default judgment is continued to 11/30/2023.
