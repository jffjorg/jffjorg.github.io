STATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS: 
 
On June 23, 2022, Plaintiffs Win Point Investment, Inc.
(“Win”), Excelsior Pre-School, LLC (“EPS”), and Excelsior Online Tutoring
(“EOT”) (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) has brought suit against Defendant Scott
Balanda (“Defendant” or “Balanda”) for (1) breach of confidentiality agreement,
(2) breach of duty of loyalty, (3) interference with contractual relations, (4)
interference with prospective economic advantage, (5) misappropriation of trade
secrets, (6) unfair competition (Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200 et seq.), and
(7) common law unfair competition.
 
Plaintiffs allege that Defendant misappropriated trade
secrets and shared them with a roommate in an effort to create a competing
education business.
 
On February 13, 2024, Defendant Balanda filed a motion for
summary judgment, or alternatively, summary adjudication which the court
GRANTED.
 
On May 3, 2024, the court issued Notice of Entry of Judgment
in favor of Defendant.
 
On June 21, 2024, Defendant filed the instant motion for
attorneys’ fees.
 
On August 15, 2024, the parties notified the court that they
were scheduling mediation.
 
Oppositions to this motion were due on or before September
24, 2024. As of October 1, 2024, the court has not received any opposition.
 
LEGAL STANDARD: 
 
Request for
Judicial Notice
 
Defendant’s request for judicial notice is granted.
 
Attorneys’ Fees
 
Civil Code section 3426.4 provides, in relevant part: 
 
If a claim of misappropriation is made
in bad faith, . . . the court may award reasonable attorney's fees and costs to
the prevailing party. Recoverable costs hereunder shall include a reasonable
sum to cover the services of expert witnesses, who are not regular employees of
any party, actually incurred and reasonably necessary in either, or both,
preparation for trial or arbitration, or during trial or arbitration, of the
case by the prevailing party. 
 
(Civ. Code, § 3426.4.)  
 
“It is well established that the
determination of what constitutes reasonable attorney fees is committed to the
discretion of the trial court, whose decision cannot be reversed in the absence
of an abuse of discretion. [Citation.]”¿ (Melnyk
v. Robledo (1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 618, 623 624.) The fee setting inquiry in
California ordinarily “begins with the ‘lodestar’ [method], i.e., the number of
hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate.”¿ (Graciano v. Robinson Ford Sales, Inc.
(2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 140, 154.)¿ “[A] computation of time spent on a case and
the reasonable value of that time is fundamental to a determination of an
appropriate attorneys’ fee award.”¿ (Margolin
v. Reg’l Planning Comm’n (1982) 134 Cal.App.3d 999, 1004.)¿ The lodestar
figure may then be adjusted, based on consideration of factors specific to the
case, in order to fix the fee at the fair market value for the legal services
provided.¿ (See Serrano v. Priest (1977)
20 Cal.3d 25, 49 [discussing factors relevant to proper attorneys’ fees
award].)¿ Such an approach anchors the trial court’s analysis to an objective
determination of the value of the attorney’s services, ensuring that the amount
awarded is not arbitrary.¿ (Id. at
48, fn. 23.)¿ The factors considered in determining the modification of the
lodestar include “(1) the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, (2)
the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the extent to which the nature of
the litigation precluded other employment by the attorneys, (4) the contingent
nature of the fee award.”¿ (Mountjoy v.
Bank of Am. (2016) 245 Cal.App.4th 266, 271.)¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿ 
In challenging attorney fees as
excessive because too many hours of work are claimed, it is the burden of the
challenging party to point to the specific items challenged, with a sufficient
argument and citations to the evidence.¿ (Premier
Medical Management Systems, Inc. v. California Ins. Guaranty Assoc. (2008)
163 Cal.App.4th 550, 564.)¿ General arguments that fees claimed are excessive,
duplicative, or unrelated do not suffice.¿ (Ibid.) 
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
Defendant contends Plaintiffs brought this action in bad
faith and he is entitled to recover his attorneys’ fees as a prevailing party.[1]
Plaintiffs did not file an opposition.
 
Bad Faith
 
California courts have developed a two-prong standard for
“bad faith”: “(1) objective speciousness of the claim, and (2) subjective bad
faith in bringing or maintaining the action, i.e., for an improper purpose.” (FLIR Systems, Inc. v. Parrish (2009) 174
Cal.App.4th 1270, 1275.) “[U]nder the ‘objectively specious’ standard, it is
enough for defendants to point to the absence of evidence of misappropriation
in the record.” (SASCO v. Rosendin Elec.,
Inc. (2012) 207 Cal.App.4th 837, 848.) The test for the subjective element
of bad faith is not about the plaintiff’s subjective belief in the merits of
its claim, “but for what purpose it
pursued such a claim.” (Cypress
Semiconductor Corp. v. Maxim Integrated Products, Inc. (2015) 236
Cal.App.4th 243, 267.)  
 

Objective
     speciousness  

 
The court finds, and as Defendant points out, Plaintiffs
failed to present evidence to support their claim that Defendant
misappropriated any trade secrets. This is enough to meet the objective element
of bad faith. (SASCO, supra, 207
Cal.App.4th at 848.) 
 

Subjective
     bad faith  

 
The court also finds subjective bad faith on the part of
Plaintiffs for pursuing their misappropriation claim. A court may infer
subjective bad faith “by evidence that [plaintiffs] intended to cause
unnecessary delay, filed the action to harass [defendants], or harbored an
improper motive.” (FLIR, supra, 174 Cal.App.4th at 1278.)
“[B]elated and evasive response to [the defendant]’s demand for specification
of the trade secrets at issue” supports such inference. (Cypress, supra, 236
Cal.App.4th at 270.)  
 
As discussed above, Plaintiffs did not respond to discovery
at all, let alone identify which trade secrets Defendant misappropriated.
(Baranov Decl. ¶ 3.) Plaintiffs similarly failed to produce evidence to
defendant against Defendant’s motion for summary judgment.
 
Accordingly, the bad faith component is met.
 
Reasonableness of
Fee
 
A verified fee bill is “prima facie evidence the costs, expenses
and services listed were necessarily incurred, and when they are properly
challenged the burden of proof shifts to the party claiming them as costs.” (Hadley v. Krepel (1985) 167 Cal.App.3d
677, 682.) Still, the Court is the ultimate arbiter in deciding whether
expenses are reasonable.
 
Here,
upon review of the Michael M. Baranov Declaration (in support of the Motion for
Attorneys’ Fees), its description of the attorneys’ years of experience, the
accompanying exhibits, and the arguments and evidence brought forth by Defendant
leads to the conclusion that the attorneys’ fees as requested are reasonable
because they are supported by substantial evidence under the present
circumstances. 
 
The only
items the court disagrees with is counsel’s request for time to prepare an
opposition since Plaintiffs did not ultimately file an opposition. The court
therefore reduces request by three (3) hours representing no need to review an
opposition or prepare a reply for a total award of 55.9 hours at counsel’s rate
of $695 per hour.
 
Accordingly, the court GRANTS Defendant’s motion for
attorneys’ fees.
 
CONCLUSION:
 
            For
the foregoing reasons, the Court decides the pending motion as follows: 
 
1.      Motion
for Attorneys’ Fees is GRANTED;
2.      Plaintiffs
are ordered to pay $38,850.50 in attorneys’ fees to Defendant within 30 days of
notice of this ruling.
Moving party is to give notice. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
