[TENTATIVE] ORDER TAKING OFF
 HEARING ON DEMURRER TO THE COMPLAINT
 
      Defendants
filed their demurrer to the unlawful detainer complaint on April 5, 2024. Plaintiff
filed a first amended complaint on July 9, 2024. The amended pleading
supersedes the original complaint rendering the demurrer moot. (Foster
v. Sexton (2021) 61 Cal.App.5th 998, 1035 ["An amended
pleading supplants (i.e., entirely replaces) the prior pleading and it,
standing alone, contains all the plaintiff's allegations and requests for
relief.”].) Accordingly, the hearing on demurrer to the original complaint is
taken off calendar.
