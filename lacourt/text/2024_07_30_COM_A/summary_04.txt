And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling takes off the hearing on demurrer to the original complaint filed by Veronica Childs against Erica Ortiz and others. The defendants filed their demurrer on April 5, 2024, but the plaintiff subsequently filed an amended complaint on July 9, 2024, which supersedes the original complaint. According to California law and a relevant case (Foster v. Sexton), an amended pleading replaces the prior pleading and includes all the plaintiff's allegations and requests for relief. Therefore, the demurrer to the original complaint is rendered moot, and the hearing is taken off calendar.
