Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants Plaintiff's motion to compel a further response to Plaintiff's demand for a site inspection of Defendant's video surveillance room, cameras, and systems. The judge finds that the video surveillance cameras, equipment, and recordings are relevant to determine whether Plaintiff's incident could have been captured on the date of the incident. The judge also orders Defendant to permit inspection of the premises as described in Plaintiff's inspection demand.

The judge grants Plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to Plaintiff's first set of requests for production of documents. The judge finds that Defendant has not supported its objections to the requests, including its claim of privilege over blank forms. The judge orders Defendant to serve further, verified, responses without objection consistent with the court's ruling within 10 days.

The judge imposes monetary sanctions of $2,400 against Defendant, Target, and its counsel, Justin Bubion, jointly and severally, and payable to Plaintiff within 10 days. The judge declines to impose sanctions against Defendant for refusing to produce records to the extent Defendant asserted the attorney-client privilege, although the objection was not substantiated.
