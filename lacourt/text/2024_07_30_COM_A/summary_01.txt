And here is the English-text summary:

The Honorable Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the plaintiff's motion for an order to show cause re contempt against third-party witness Sedgwick for failure to comply with a deposition subpoena for production of worker's compensation records. The case involves the death of Pablo Garcia, who was fatally shot by defendants on May 21, 2019. The plaintiffs filed their complaint on January 9, 2020, and have been seeking discovery of records related to the defendants' personnel and administrative records. The court has previously ordered Sedgwick to produce the records, but Sedgwick has failed to do so despite multiple attempts by the plaintiffs to serve the subpoena. The court has determined that the subpoena is valid and that Sedgwick's failure to comply is improper. The court has set an order to show cause re contempt for August 23, 2024, and has ordered Sedgwick to submit briefing explaining why it will not comply with the lawfully served subpoenas 10 days before the contempt hearing.
