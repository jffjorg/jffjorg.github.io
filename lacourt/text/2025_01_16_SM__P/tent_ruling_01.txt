Klever Programmatic v. Residents
Medical Group, Case no. 23SMCV04900
Hearing date January 16, 2025
Plaintiff’s
Motion to Vacate Dismissal
Plaintiff
Klever Programmatic, Inc. sued defendant Residents Medical Group, Inc. for
breach of contract arising from defendant’s failure to pay for consulting
services. A notice of settlement was filed 4/18/24. Plaintiff moved to dismiss,
and the case was dismissed 6/20/24. Min. Order 6/20/24. Plaintiff now moves to
set aside the dismissal, arguing plaintiff’s specially appearing counsel at
hearing 6/20/24 erred by dismissed the case without requesting the court retain
jurisdiction per Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §664.6. Plaintiff requests the court set
aside the 6/20/24 dismissal and schedule an OSC re: settlement so plaintiff may
move for dismissal again with the court retaining jurisdiction this time. No
opposition was filed. 
The
court may relieve a party from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other
proceeding taken against him or her through his or her mistake, inadvertence,
surprise or excusable neglect... Notwithstanding any other requirements of this
section, the court shall, whenever an application for relief is made no more
than six (6) months after entry of judgment, is in proper form, and is
accompanied by an attorney's sworn affidavit of attestation to his or her
mistake, inadvertence. surprise or excusable neglect, vacate: (1) resulting
default entered by the clerk by his or her client, and which will result in
entry of a default judgment; or (2) resulting default judgment or dismissal
entered against his or her client, unless the court finds that the default or
dismissal was not in fact caused by the attorney's mistake, inadvertence,
surprise or excusable neglect. Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §473.
Dismissal
was entered 6/20/24. Min. Order 6/20/24. The instant motion was filed 12/11/24.
Plaintiff is within the statutory cutoff by 9 days. Plaintiff offers the
declaration of counsel Brian Tapper stating “On June 20, 2024, my office had a
special appearance attorney appear at the court hearing… due to my inadvertence
and mistake, I did not inform the appearing attorney to only dismiss the case
pursuant to Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §664.4. As a result, the court dismissed the
case without retaining jurisdiction pursuant to Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §664.6.”
Decl. Tapper para. 2.
For
the court to retain jurisdiction pursuant to Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §664.6, all
parties must sign, indicating their consent. Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §664.6.
Plaintiff does not provide a copy of the settlement agreement, so there is no
evidence the parties agreed that the court retain jurisdiction.
While
the appearance attorney may have failed to inform the court of the 664.6
provision, there is no evidence that the parties dismissed pursuant to 664.6. The
matter will be continued to allow plaintiff to file a copy of the settlement
agreement. If the parties agreed that the court will retain jurisdiction
pursuant to 664.6, the court will so order. If the parties did not so agree,
the court cannot read such a provision into the settlement. CONTINUED for
approximately one week.
