 Case Number:  23CHCV00861    Hearing Date:   October 24, 2023    Dept:  F51 MOTION FOR
PROTECTIVE ORDER

(Form
Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Requests for Production, Set One)
Los Angeles Superior Court
Case # 23CHCV00861

 
Motion filed: 7/26/23
 
MOVING PARTY: Plaintiff Ella Netes, in pro per (“Plaintiff”)
RESPONDING PARTY: Defendant Imad El Asmir, M.D. (“Defendant”)
NOTICE: ok  
 
RELIEF REQUESTED: A protective order finding that Defendant’s
first set of discovery requests are overly burdensome and oppressive insofar as
they are repetitive, duplicative, cumulative, and expensive, and that Plaintiff
is excused from responding to them.
 
TENTATIVE RULING: The motion is denied. Plaintiff is
ordered to serve her responses to all outstanding discovery requests propounded
by Defendant within 30 days. The Court imposes monetary sanctions against
Plaintiff in the amount of $100.00, payable within 60 days.
 
Defendant is reminded to review the 5/3/19 First Amended
General Order Re Mandatory Electronic Filing for Civil. When e-filing
documents, parties must comply with the “TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS” which are set
forth at page 4, line 4 through page 5, line 12 of the Court’s 5/3/19 First
Amended General Order Re Mandatory Electronic Filing for Civil (particularly
bookmarking declarations and exhibits). (CRC 3.1110(f)(4).) Failure to comply
with these requirements in the future may result in papers being rejected,
matters being placed off calendar, matters being continued so documents can be
resubmitted in compliance with these requirements, documents not being
considered and/or the imposition of sanctions.
 
BACKGROUND
 
This is a medical malpractice
action in which Plaintiff, who was a patient from 12/28/21 to 1/18/22 at
nonmoving defendant Hollywood Medical Center, L.P. dba Hollywood Presbyterian
Medical Center, alleges that she underwent an unnecessary blood transfusion at
the hospital and that some of her medical records from the hospital, including
her discharge summary, do not accurately reflect her medical condition. (FAC ¶¶
2, 20, 28.) Defendant is a primary internist who treated and discharged
Plaintiff. (Id. at ¶
3.)
 
On 3/27/23, Plaintiff filed the
instant action, alleging against Defendants the following causes of action: (1)
Negligence; (2) Future Health Risks Due to Negligence/Medical Record; and (3)
Misadministration. On 5/9/23, Plaintiff filed her first amended complaint (“FAC”),
alleging against defendants the following causes of action: (1) Negligence for
Heart Injury; (2) Health Risks Due to Negligence/Medical Records; and (3)
Misadministration.
 
On 6/27/23, Defendant served
Plaintiff with his first set of Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, Requests
for Production of Documents, and Deposition Notice. (Decl. of Aaron J. Weissman
¶¶ 3–6.) On
6/28/23, Defendant filed his answer to Plaintiff’s FAC.
 
On 7/26/23, Plaintiff filed the
instant motion for a protective order. On 10/10/23, Defendant filed his
opposition. No reply has been filed to date.
 
ANALYSIS
 
I.                  
Meet and Confer
 
A motion for protective order must
be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration stating “facts showing a
reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal resolution of each issue
presented by the motion.” (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2030.090, subd. (a); 2016.040.)
 
Here, Plaintiff declares that
beginning on 7/18/23, she met and conferred with Defendant’s counsel regarding
the issues raised in the instant motion, but the parties were unable to come to
a resolution. (Decl. of Ella Netes ¶¶
3–5.) Accordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiff has satisfied the meet and
confer requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.090.
 
II.               
Protective Order
 
When document requests, interrogatories,
or a deposition notice have been propounded, the responding party, may promptly
move for a protective order. (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2025.420, subd. (a), 2030.090, subd. (a), 2031.060, subd.
(a).) “The court, for good cause shown, may make any order that justice
requires to protect any party, deponent, or other natural person or
organization from unwarranted annoyance, embarrassment, or oppression, or undue
burden and expense.” (Code Civ. Proc. §§
2025.420, subd. (b), 2030.090, subd. (b), 2031.060, subd. (b).)
 
The statute requires the party
seeking a protective order to make a showing of good cause. A motion for a
protective order must include supporting evidence, which may include, at
minimum a supporting declaration stating, for example, “some showing either of
an intent to create an unreasonable burden or that the ultimate effect of the
burden is incommensurate with the result sought.” (West Pico Furniture Co.
of Los Angeles v. Superior Court (1961) 56 Cal.2d 407, 417.) A supporting
declaration containing mere conclusions is insufficient to establish good cause
for a protective order. (People v. Superior Court (1967) 248 Cal.App.2d
276, 281.)
 
Here, the discovery requests
propounded by Defendant include: (1) 51 form interrogatories; (2) 34 special
interrogatories; and (3) 23 requests for production of documents. (Exs. A–C to
Weissman Decl.) Plaintiff “requests that this court issues [sic] a protective
order to relieve plaintiff of undue burden of having to respond to overly
broad, unduly burdensome, costly and not reasonably calculated to lead to the
discovery of admissible evidences [sic].” (Pl.’s Mot. 7:12–14.)
 
As a preliminary matter, the Court
notes that Plaintiff has failed to provide a separate statement to accompany
the instant motion. “Any motion involving the content of a discovery request or
the responses to such a request must be accompanied by a separate statement.”
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(a).) Instead, Plaintiff appears to identify
within her motion the requests and interrogatories that she asserts are
duplicative, repetitive, overbroad, uncertain, seek information already
available to Defendant, irrelevant, seek private information, and oppressive.
(Pl.’s Mot. 9:26 – 14:11.) Plaintiff argues that here, “the order is necessary
to a party’s voluminous, unfocused discovery on the eve of the trial.” (Id. at
7:28–8:1, citing Day v. Rosenthal (1985) 170 Cal.App.3d 1125, 1171.)
However, the Court notes that no trial date has yet been set in this action.
Moreover, Plaintiff offers no evidentiary showing to establish good cause for a
protective order.
 
Based on the foregoing, the Court
agrees with Defendant and finds that Plaintiff has not adequately shown that
Defendant’s discovery requests are sufficiently oppressive to warrant a
protective order excusing her from responding thereto. (Def.’s Mot. 4:7–9.)
Accordingly, the motion is denied.
 
III.            
Sanctions
 
“The court shall impose a monetary
sanction … against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion for a protective order under this section, unless it finds
that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or
that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. (Code Civ.
Proc. §§ 2025.420,
subd. (h), 2030.090, subd. (d), 2031.060, subd. (h).) Additionally, “the court
may impose a monetary sanction ordering that one engaging in the misuse of the
discovery process, or any attorney advising that conduct, or both pay the
reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result
of that conduct.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.030, subd. (a).)
 
Here, Defendant requests monetary sanctions
in the total amount of $500.00 to be imposed on Plaintiff. This amount has been
reduced from $3,750.00 in attorney fees, which includes: (1) 5 hours spent
meeting and conferring with Plaintiff; (2) 7 hours spent working on the opposition;
and (3) 3 hours preparing for appearing at the hearing, at his hourly billing
rate of $250.00 per hour. (Daws Decl. ¶¶
20–22.)
 
In denying the instant motion, the
Court finds it reasonable to impose monetary sanctions against Plaintiff, in
pro per, in the amount of $100.00, payable within 60 days.
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion is denied. Plaintiff is
ordered to serve her responses to all outstanding discovery requests propounded
by Defendant within 30 days. The Court imposes monetary sanctions against
Plaintiff in the amount of $100.00, payable within 60 days.
