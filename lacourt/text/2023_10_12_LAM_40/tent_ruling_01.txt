 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
Plaintiff
  Guadalupe Maxey’s Motion to Compel Further Responses by Defendant Kindred
  Healthcare Operating, LLC to Plaintiff’s Requests for Production, Set Two,
  and Request for Sanctions.



 
Background
Pleadings
Plaintiff Guadalupe Maxey sues Defendants KND Real Estate 40, LLC (Kindred
Paramount), KND SNF Real Estate Holdings, LLC (since dismissed), KND Real
Estate Holdings, LLC (since dismissed), Kindred Healthcare Operating, LLC (KHO),
Agva, LLC, Aspen Skilled Healthcare, Inc., and Does 1 through 50 pursuant to a
September 24, 2021 Complaint alleging claims of (1) Dependent Adult Abuse &
Neglect, (2) Negligence, and (3) Violation of Residents Rights.
The claims arise from allegations
that Plaintiff Maxey failed to receive proper treatment while under Defendants’
care, resulting in, among other things, a long-standing contracture condition
of her left arm, which, to this day, has left her with no function in that arm.
The relationship between Defendants, as alleged in the Complaint, is that
KHO is the parent company of KND Real Estate Holdings, LLC, which is, in turn,
the parent company of KND SNF Real Estate Holdings, LLC, which is, in turn, the
parent company of Kindred Paramount. KHO is thus the ultimate parent company of
Kindred Paramount.
Motion Before the Court
On September 15, 2023, Plaintiff
Maxey moved to compel further responses and production from KHO related to
Plaintiff’s Requests for Production (RPDs), Set Two, Nos.115-119, 121-126,
129-132, and 137-153.
On September 27, 2023, KHO opposed
Plaintiff’s motion.
On October 5, 2023, Plaintiff Maxey
replied to the opposition.
Plaintiff Maxey’s motion is now
before the Court.
 
Motion to Compel Further Production

Legal Standard
A motion to compel a further
response is used when a party gives unsatisfactory answers or makes untenable
objections to interrogatories, demands to produce, or requests for admission.
(See Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a); Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting,
Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.)
To request further production, a
movant must establish: (1) good cause for the production (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.310, subd. (b)(1); Sinaiko, supra, at p. 403); and (2) that
a further response is needed because (a) the responding party’s statement of
compliance with the demand to produce is incomplete Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.310, subd. (a)(1)), (b) the responding party’s representation that it is unable
to comply is inadequate, complete, or evasive (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310,
subd. (a)(2)), (c) the responding party’s objection in the response is without
merit or is too general (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a)(3); Catalina
Island Yacht Club v. Superior Court (2015) 242 Cal.App.4th 1116, 1127), or
(d) if the responding party objected to the production of ESI on the ground
that it is not reasonably accessible the movant can show that the (i) ESI is
reasonably accessible or (ii) there is good cause for production of the ESI
regardless of its accessibility (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (e)).
Order Compelling Further
Production: GRANTED, in Part.
Plaintiff Maxey moves to compel
further responses and production from KHO related to Plaintiff’s RPDs, Set Two,
Nos.115-119, 121-126, 129-132, and 137-153. (See Mot., Notice., p. 2.)
Plaintiff argues that good cause exists for this production (alter ego
liability against KHO based on any liability against Kindred Paramount) and
that KHO’s objections to these RPDs lack merit. (Mot., pp. 6-14.) Plaintiff
attaches a separate statement providing grounds for further responses and
production to these RPDs. (Mot., Separate Statement.)
I. RPDs, Set Two,
Nos. 115-118, 126, 137-138, and 145-146
In opposition to further responses
and production to RPDs, Set Two, Nos. 115-118, 126, 137-138, and 145-146, KHO
argues that the requests are overbroad and properly subject to the stated
objections. (Opp’n, pp. 2-7.)
KHO’s objections were based on undue
burden and harassment, overbreadth, vagueness, and ambiguity, scope of
discovery (relevance; reasonably calculated to lead to discovery of admissible
evidence), peer-review protections (Evid. Code, § 1157), a right to privacy and/or
confidentiality, third-party HIPPA and CMIA protections, the attorney-client
privilege and/or the work product doctrine, and/or Civil Code section 3295
protections. Some of KHO’s responses provide that, subject to its objections,
“KHO produces all documents responsive to this demand within its possession,
custody or control, to which no objection has been made, via Hightail link.” (See
Mot., Separate Statement, Nos. 115-117; cf. id. at Nos. 126, 137-138,
145-146 [objection only responses]; Mot., Cassidy Decl., Exs. K-L [copy of RPDs,
Set Two, and responses].)
In reply, Plaintiff Maxey
reiterates good cause for production. (Reply, pp. 5-7.)
The Court finds that further
responses and production to RPDs Set, Two, Nos. 115-118, 126, 137-138, and
145-146.
The Court first notes that the
production sought is relevant to alter ego liability as based on factors
provided in Associated Vendors, Inc. v. Oakland Meat Co. (1962) 210
Cal.App.2d 825, 838-840 (Associated Vendors). Questions of alter ego
liability could arise from documents showing the services that KHO provided to
Kindred Paramount as a hospital and corporate entity, documents describing KHO
and Kindred Paramount’s business relationship, documents evidencing overlap
between meetings and conferences, etc., documents provided to Kindred
Paramount’s governing body, documents showing communications between Kindred
Paramount and KHO, minutes discussing the Kindred Paramount hospital, and
documents showing KHO’s members and employee roster for the relevant time
period. For example, domination and control could be shown through those
documents.
However, as on September 7, 2023,
the Court limits the production period to 18 months before the relevant time
period—starting on April 27, 2020—through July 27, 2020.
The Court also notes that while
documents showing any and all communications between the parties may be
burdensome to collect by KHO, the lack of such communications can support a
finding that no alter ego liability exists by supporting a position that KHO
does not dominate or control Kindred Paramount.
The Court next finds that this
modification will adequately resolve any objections as to undue burden,
harassment, overbreadth, vagueness, and ambiguity.
The Court finds that KHO presents
insufficient grounds for the Court to find that a peer review privilege exists
in the production at issue.
The Court finds that to the extent
KHO has a right to privacy in the requested production, there is a compelling
need for production: alter ego liability evidence. For this reason, even if
there was a fundamental right to privacy at issue, the production would be
merited. (Williams v. Superior Court (2017) 3 Cal.5th 531, 552 (Williams)
[If the case involves an obvious invasion of a privacy interest that is
fundamental to the holder’s personal autonomy, a compelling interest or need
must be present to overcome the privacy interest]; see also Ameri-Med Corp.
v. Worker’s Comp. Appeals Bd. (1996) 42 Cal.App.4th 1260, 1287-1288 (Ameri-Med
Corp.) [corporation’s do not have constitutional right to privacy but have
some right to privacy, the existence of which is dependent on the circumstances
of the case].)
The Court next recognizes that
Plaintiff has agreed to redaction of third-party information, mooting right to
privacy issues relating to third parties. (Response Nos. 115, 117.)
Where the attorney-client or work
product privilege is invoked in further responses, the Court imposes the
obligation to provide a privilege log pursuant to Hernandez v. Superior
Court (2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 285, 291, fn. 6. (See Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.240, subd. (b)(2).)
Last, the Court determines that
KHO’s Civil Code section 3295 objections are irrelevant insofar as the use of
this evidence is for the purposes of establishing alter ego liability, not
punitive damages. Moreover, it is not clear to the Court that seeking
production related to services, communications, and resources shared by KHO and
Kindred Paramount is evidence relating to the profits or financial condition of
KHO.
The Court thus GRANTS Plaintiff’s
motion as to RPDs, Set Two, Nos. 115-118, 126, 137-138, and 145-146.
II. RPDs, Set Two,
Nos. 121-124
In opposition to further responses
and production to RPDs, Set Two, Nos. 121-124, KHO argues that the production
requests are too burdensome and harassing based on excessive and unnecessary
burden of seeking “reports” exchanged between Kindred Paramount and KHO, that
that the requests are generally overbroad, vague, and ambiguous, and that the
requests do not relate to alter ego grounds. (Opp’n, pp. 7-8.) 
KHO’s objections were based on undue
burden and harassment, overbreadth, vagueness, and ambiguity, scope of
discovery (relevance; reasonably calculated to lead to discovery of admissible
evidence), a right to privacy, the attorney-client privilege and/or the work
product doctrine, and/or Civil Code section 3295 protections. (See Mot.,
Separate Statement, Nos. 121-124; Mot., Cassidy Decl., Exs. K-L [copy of RPDs,
Set Two, and responses].)
The reply does not appear to
address these production requests.
The Court finds that production is
merited as to these production requests.
The evidence is relevant to an
alter ego determination. If KHO received many reports of any kind from Kindred
Paramount on a regular basis, such evidence could help establish one of many
factors for alter ego liability listed in Plaintiff’s motion and drawn from Associated
Vendors, supra, 210 Cal.App.2d at pp. 838-840, e.g., failure to maintain
records and domination and control, to the extent they exist.
However, as on September 7, 2023,
the Court limits the production period to 18 months before the relevant time
period—starting on April 27, 2020—through July 27, 2020.
As to the contention that the use
of the word “reports” in the production requests is somewhat broad, vague, or
ambiguous, the Court notes that the extent to which KHO and Kindred Paramount
send reports to one another itself is relevant to a determination of, for
example, failure to maintain records or domination and control.
The Court otherwise finds the undue
burden and harassment objections without merit.
The Court finds that to the extent
KHO has a right to privacy in the requested production, there is a compelling
need for production: alter ego liability evidence. For this reason, even if
there was a fundamental right to privacy at issue, the production would be
merited. (Williams, supra, 3 Cal.5th at p. 552; see also Ameri-Med
Corp., supra, 42 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1287-1288.)
The Court next recognizes that
Plaintiff has agreed to redaction of third-party information, mooting right to
privacy issues relating to third parties. (Response Nos. 121.)
Where the attorney-client or work
product privilege is invoked in further responses, the Court imposes the
obligation to provide a privilege log pursuant to Hernandez v. Superior
Court (2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 285, 291, fn. 6. (See Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.240, subd. (b)(2).)
Last, the Court determines that
KHO’s Civil Code section 3295 objections are irrelevant insofar as the use of
this evidence is for the purposes of establishing alter ego liability, not
punitive damages. Moreover, it is not clear to the Court that seeking
production related to reports shared by KHO and Kindred Paramount is evidence
relating to the profits or financial condition of KHO.
The Court thus GRANTS Plaintiff’s
motion as to RPDs, Set Two, Nos. 121-124.
III. RPDs, Set Two,
Nos. 130-131, 141-144, and 147-152
In opposition to further responses
and production to RPDs, Set Two, Nos. 130-131, 141-144, and 147-152, KHO argues
this production is protected by Civil Code section 3295. (Opp’n, pp. 8-12.)
KHO’s objections were based on undue
burden and harassment, overbreadth, vagueness, and ambiguity, scope of
discovery (relevance; reasonably calculated to lead to discovery of admissible
evidence), peer-review protections (Evid. Code, § 1157), a right to privacy
and/or confidentiality, the attorney-client privilege and/or the work product
doctrine, and/or Civil Code section 3295 protections. The response to Request
No. 131 also provides that “KHO produces all documents responsive to this
demand within its possession, custody or control, to which no objection has
been made, via Hightail link.” (See Mot., Separate Statement, Nos. 130-131,
141-144, 147-152; Mot., Cassidy Decl., Exs. K-L [copy of RPDs, Set Two, and
responses].)
The Court finds that documents
relating to budget approval by KHO in favor of Kindred Paramount, support fees
by KHO to Kindred Paramount, financial assistance to Kindred Paramount and
debts to KHO, overlap in accounts receivable and payable, billing statements, financial
transactions, and overlapping withdrawals are reasonably calculated to lead to
admissible alter ego evidence. (RPDs, Nos. 130-131, 141-144, 147-149). These
issues touch upon comingling of assets, failure to segregate funds, treatment
by one entity of the other’s assets as its own, use of the other entity as a
mere shell, and lack of legal formalities. (Associated Vendors, supra,
210 Cal.App.2d at pp. 838-840.)
Similarly, the RehabCare production
requests (Nos. 151-152) are relevant because (1) RehabCare Group of California,
Inc. was first raised in KHO’s summary judgment or adjudication motion as an
entity that contracts with Kindred Paramount to provide rehabilitation care
services and (2) production could show that RehabCare is simply a passthrough
entity or alter ego through which KHO provides services to Kindred Paramount, thus
aiding an alter ego determination.
However, as on September 7, 2023,
the Court limits the production period to 18 months before the relevant time
period—starting on April 27, 2020—through July 27, 2020.
The Court next finds that with this
modification, the undue burden, harassment, overbreadth, vagueness, and
ambiguity objections are undercut.
The Court finds that KHO presents
insufficient grounds for the Court to find that a peer review privilege exists
in the production at issue.
The Court finds that to the extent
KHO has a right to privacy in the requested production, there is a compelling
need for production: alter ego liability evidence. For this reason, even if
there was a fundamental right to privacy at issue, the production would be
merited. (Williams, supra, 3 Cal.5th at p. 552 [If the case
involves an obvious invasion of a privacy interest that is fundamental to the
holder’s personal autonomy, a compelling interest or need must be present to
overcome the privacy interest]; see also Ameri-Med Corp., supra,
42 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1287-1288 [corporation’s do not have constitutional right
to privacy but have some right to privacy, the existence of which is dependent
on the circumstances of the case].)
Where the attorney-client or work
product privilege is invoked in further responses, the Court imposes the
obligation to provide a privilege log pursuant to Hernandez v. Superior
Court (2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 285, 291, fn. 6. (See Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.240, subd. (b)(2).)
Last, the Court determines that
KHO’s Civil Code section 3295 objections are irrelevant insofar as the use of
this evidence is for the purposes of establishing alter ego liability, not
punitive damages. Moreover, it is not clear to the Court that seeking
production related to financial overlap between KHO and Kindred Paramount is
evidence relating to the profits or financial condition of KHO.
The Court thus GRANTS Plaintiff’s
motion as to RPDs, Set Two, Nos. 130-131, 141-144, and 147-152.
IV. RPDs, Set Two,
Nos. 119, 125, 129, 132, 139, and 140 and/or 153.
KHO agrees in its opposition to
provide further responses and production in relation to RPDs, Set Two, Nos.
119, 125, 129, 130, and alternately, 140 and 153. (Opp’n, p. 12.) The Court
interprets this as agreement to responses and production in relation to all the
named production requests, which is reinforced by the notice naming Request No.
153 and no other opposition section touching upon Request No. 140. (See Opp’n,
pp. 2-12.)
The Court thus GRANTS Plaintiff’s
motion as to RPDs, Set Two, Nos. 119, 125, 129, 132, 139, 140, and 153.
Sanctions: DENIED.
Except in certain circumstances
involving electronic stored information, the court must impose a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party,
person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel
further response to a demand, unless it finds that the one subject to the
sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make
the imposition of the sanction unjust. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd.
(h).)
The court may award sanctions under the
Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even
though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was
withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after
the motion was filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1348, subd. (a).)
Based on the Court’s modifications to
the time period for the discovery requests, there was some overbreadth in scope
of time, showing justification in KHO opposing this motion. KHO also raised valid
arguments as to various privacy rights and privileges (for which a log is
needed), as well as the vague nature of some words in the production requests,
e.g., “reports.”
Sanctions are thus DENIED.
