Background
Initial Pleading
On May 26, 2022, Plaintiff
Creditors Adjustment Bureau, Inc. (CAB)—as assignee of interests held by State
Compensation Insurance Fund (Assignor or State Fund)—sued Defendant J and S
Painting, Inc. (J&S) and Does 1 through 10 pursuant to a Complaint alleging
claims of (1) Breach of Contract, (2) Open Book Account, (3) Account Stated,
and (4) Reasonable Value.
The claims arise from allegations
that Defendant J&S and Assignor entered into a written agreement wherein
the State Fund agreed to provide a policy of workers compensation insurance to J&S,
bearing Policy No. 9246526-19 and providing coverage for the period of February
28, 2019 through February 28, 2020, for which J&S agreed to pay premiums in
accordance with the terms and conditions of said policy, only for J&S to
default on payments in the amount of $132,150.74.
Default Judgment, Levy, and
Vacatur
On July 5, 2022, the summons and
complaint were served on Defendant J&S.
On July 20, 2022, proof of service
therefor was filed with the Court.
On August 26, 2022, CAB dismissed
Doe defendants from this action.
On August 31, 2022, CAB requested,
and the Clerk entered, an entry of default against Defendant J&S.
That same day, CAB filed a complete
default judgment packet against J&S, including a request for court
judgment, a proposed judgment, a declaration pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 585, and an interest and attorney’s fees declaration.
On September 27, 2022, the Court
granted default judgment in the amount of $159,101.63, comprised of (1) base
damages of $132,150.74, (2) prejudgment interest of $25,122.80, (3) attorney’s
fees of $1,200, and (4) costs of $628.09. Judgment thereon was entered the same
day, with notice of judgment on September 28, 2022.
On January 19, 2023, the clerk
issued one of various writs of execution for the judgment.
On or about March 8, 2023, CAB levied
the amount of $98,969.45 from a J&S bank account.
On March 21, 2023, J&S made a
motion to set aside default and any resulting default judgment against J&S.
The motion was calendared for hearing on May 5, 2023, a date not reflected in
the caption page for the motion.
On May 1, 2023, CAB requested a
continuance of the May 5th hearing on the ground that, because the motion did
not contain a hearing date in its caption page, CAB’s counsel miscalendared the
hearing date for May 26, 2023, only realizing the mistake recently, and
impeding CAB’s ability to draft an opposition to the motion to set aside.
On May 5, 2023, the Court granted a
continuance for CAB to oppose the motion and for J&S to file a reply.
On May 22, 2023, CAB opposed the
motion to set aside default and default judgment.
On May 30, 2023, J&S replied to
the May 22nd opposition.
On June 9, 2023, the Court granted
the motion to set aside, thus vacating the entry of default and default
judgment against J&S and quashing any writ of attachment resulting
therefrom.
Cross-Complaint and Motion
Before the Court
On June 22, 2023, J&S sued CAB
pursuant to a Cross-Complaint alleging claims of Conversion and Negligence.
The claims arise from allegations
that CAB has failed to release the $98,969.45 levied from a J&S bank
account, in violation of the Court’s June 9, 2023 order.
On July 26, 2023, CAB moved to
strike the Cross-Complaint pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16.
On September 25, 2023, J&S
opposed the motion.
On October 4, 2023, CAB replied to
the opposition.
CAB’s anti-SLAPP motion is now
before the Court.
 
Anti-SLAPP Motion
Legal
Standard
Anti-SLAPP
analysis under Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16 proceeds in two familiar
steps. In the first step, the defendant or moving party must make “a threshold
showing that the challenged cause of action is one ‘arising from’ protected
activity.” (Barry v. State Bar of California (2017) 2 Cal.5th 318, 321,
quotations omitted (Barry).) In this context, the term “protected
activity” refers to speech or petitioning activities. (Barry, 2 Cal.5th
at p. 321.) A claim arises from protected activity when that activity underlies
or forms the basis for the claim; otherwise stated, “the defendant’s act
underlying the plaintiff’s cause of action [must] itself [be] … an act in
furtherance of the right of petition or free speech.” (Park v. Board of
Trustees of California State University (2017) 2 Cal.5th 1057, 1063,
quotations omitted (Park).) “[T]he focus is on determining what ‘the
defendant’s activity [is] that gives rise to his or her asserted liability—and
whether that activity constitutes protected speech or petitioning.’” (Ibid.)
In teasing out whether protected conduct exists, courts should consider the
elements of the challenged claim and what actions by the defendant supply those
elements and consequently form the basis for liability. (Ibid.)
If
the court finds the defendant or moving party succeeds at the first step, then
the burden shifts to the plaintiff to “demonstrate[] a probability of
prevailing on the claim.” (Ibid. [quotations omitted].) At the second
step, courts “evaluate the defendants’ evidence only to determine if it defeats
that submitted by the plaintiff as a matter of law.’ [Citation.] ‘[I]n order to
establish the requisite probability of prevailing [citation], the plaintiff
need only have “‘stated and substantiated a legally sufficient claim.’”
[Citation.] “Put another way, the plaintiff ‘must demonstrate that the
complaint is both legally sufficient and supported by a sufficient prima facie
showing of facts to sustain a favorable judgment if the evidence submitted by
the plaintiff is credited.’”’ [Citation.] … That burden [is] not particularly
high.” (Area 51 Productions, Inc. v. City of Alameda (2018) 20
Cal.App.5th 581, 602 (Area 51 Productions, Inc.).) “Claims with the
requisite minimal merit may proceed.” (Navellier v. Sletten (2002) 29
Cal.4th 82, 94 (Navallier).) If the cause of action satisfies both
prongs of the anti-SLAPP statute, then it is subject to being struck. (Barry,
supra, 2 Cal.5th at p. 321.)
As
stated by our State’s highest Court: “This is a ‘summary-judgment-like
procedure at an early stage of the litigation.’” (Varian Medical Systems,
Inc. v. Delfino (2005) 35 Cal.4th 180, 192 (Varian Medical Systems, Inc.).)
Anti-SLAPP
Motion: DENIED.
I. First Prong, Protected Activity
A
defendant meets his burden of showing that a plaintiff’s claim arises from that
defendant’s exercise of free speech or petition rights by making a prima facie
showing that the act or conduct underlying the plaintiff’s claims falls within
one of the four categories found in Code of Civil Procedure Section 425.16,
subdivision (e). (Navellier, supra, 29 Cal.4th at p. 88.) “Courts
should analyze each claim for relief — each act or set of acts supplying a
basis for relief, of which there may be several in a single pleaded cause of
action — to determine whether the acts are protected [the first prong of the
analysis] and, if so, whether the claim they give rise to has the requisite
degree of merit to survive the motion [the second prong of the analysis].” (Bonni
v. St. Joseph Health System (2021) 11 Cal.5th 995, 1010.) “[W]hen the
allegations referring to an arguably protected activity are only incidental to
a cause of action based essentially on non-protective activity, collateral
allusions to protected activity should not subject the cause of action to the
anti-SLAPP statute.” (Martinez v. Metabolife Internat., Inc. (2003) 113
Cal.App.4th 181, 188 (Martinez).)
Code
of Civil Procedure Section 425.16, subdivision (e) states:
As
used in this section, “act in furtherance of a person’s right of petition or
free speech under the United States or California Constitution in connection
with a public issue” includes: 
(1)
any written or oral statement or writing made before a legislative, executive,
or judicial proceeding, or any other official proceeding authorized by
law, 
(2)
any written or oral statement or writing made in connection with an issue under
consideration or review by a legislative, executive, or judicial body, or any
other official proceeding authorized by law, 
(3)
any written or oral statement or writing made in a place open to the public or
a public forum in connection with an issue of public interest, or 
(4)
any other conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of
petition or the constitutional right of free speech in connection with a public
issue or an issue of public interest. 
(Code
Civ. Proc., § 425.16, subd. (e) (italics added.) 
In
its motion, CAB argues that it is being sued based on allegations that involve
the litigation privilege. In support, CAB compares the Cross-Complaint’s
allegations to cases finding that anti-SLAPP protections applied to pleadings
where the defendant was alleged to have, through a tort or otherwise, obtained
of a writ of execution or levied property pursuant to that writ of execution.
CAB also argues that nothing in this Court’s June 9, 2023 order directed return
of the levied monies to J&S, for which reason J&S can only be suing CAB
based on lawful activity undertaken pursuant to a valid judgment. (Mot., pp.
4-9.)
In
opposition, J&S distinguishes the case law cited by CAB in the anti-SLAPP
motion. J&S also argues that CAB is not being sued for having secured the
writ or levying funds thereafter but is instead being sued because CAB did not
release the monies to J&S after the writ of execution was quashed by the
Court, which, by operation of law, should have led CAB to revert the $98,969.45
in levied monies back to J&S. (Opp’n, pp. 3-7.)
In
reply, CAB reiterates its points on motion and cites case law not raised in the
anti-SLAPP motion. These latter points are not considered due to being raised
for the first time on reply. (Reply, pp. 2-6; Nordstrom Com. Cases (2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 576, 583 [Courts
generally need not accept arguments raised for the first time on reply without
good cause explanation as to why points were not raised earlier].)
The
Court finds in favor of J&S.
The
arguments and case law raised by CAB are distinguishable. The cases cited by
CAB appear to involve questions of whether protected activity arises from allegations
that a party, through tortious conduct or otherwise, secured a writ of
execution or levied monies. However, the claims in the Cross-Complaint are not
based on whether CAB unlawfully secured the writ of execution or levied monies
from J&S’s bank account. Instead, the claims are based on CAB’s failure to
return the levied funds to J&S after the writ of execution pursuant to
which those monies were levied was quashed by the Court on June 9, 2023. In
essence, J&S is suing CAB for failure to follow the spirit of the Court’s
June 9, 2023 order. The Court cannot find that such alleged conduct involves
protected activity.
The
Court also disagrees with CAB’s position that this Court needed to explicitly
command CAB to return the levied monies in the June 9, 2023 order. Such a
condition was implicit in the June 9, 2023 order because if the writ of
execution failed, then the levy that followed also failed, and any levied
monies needed to be returned. CAB does not provide authority to the contrary,
instead arguing that unless it was explicitly told to return the $98,969.45 in
levied monies, it did not need to do so. Such an interpretation of the Court’s
June 9th order is narrow and incorrect.
CAB’s
anti-SLAPP motion is therefore DENIED because the Cross-Complaint’s claims do
not arise from protected activities within the meaning of Code of Civil
Procedure section 425.16.  

Conclusion
Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant Creditors Adjustment Bureau, Inc.’s
Motion to Strike Cross-Complaint of J&S Painting, Inc. is DENIED.
