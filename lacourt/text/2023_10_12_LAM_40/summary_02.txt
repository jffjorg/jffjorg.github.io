And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiff, Creditors Adjustment Bureau, Inc. (CAB), has moved to strike the Cross-Complaint of J&S Painting, Inc. (J&S) as a strategic lawsuit against public participation (SLAPP). The Court has found that the Cross-Complaint's claims do not arise from protected activities within the meaning of Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16.

The Court has analyzed the claims in the Cross-Complaint and found that they are based on CAB's failure to return levied funds to J&S after a writ of execution was quashed by the Court. The Court has determined that CAB's alleged conduct is not protected by the anti-SLAPP statute.

The Court has also disagreed with CAB's argument that it did not need to return the levied funds to J&S because it was not explicitly told to do so. The Court has found that CAB's interpretation of the Court's June 9, 2023 order is narrow and incorrect.

Therefore, the Court has denied CAB's motion to strike the Cross-Complaint.
