p.m.  
CASE NO./NAME: 21STCV08885 ERNESTO RIVERA, AN INDIVIDUAL vs BIMBO
BAKERIES USA, INC.
Moving Party: Plaintiff’s Counsel Bradford G. Hughes
Responding Party: Unopposed  
Notice: Sufficient  
  
Ruling: The Court will hear from
the moving party 
  
Background 
 
Attorney Bradford G. Hughes of Clark Hill represents Cross-Defendant Logistics Academy. Hughes moves to be relieved as counsel, citing an irremediable
breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. No opposition has been filed. Clark Hill, through attorney Maryam Danishwar, previously filed
a substitution of attorney, but that substitution of attorney appeared to be
invalid as it provided for Logisitcs Academy to be self-represented by a
non-attorney.  However, corporations must
be represented by counsel.
 
Legal Standard¿ 
¿ 
The Court has discretion to allow
an attorney to withdraw, and such a motion should be granted provided that
there is no prejudice to the client and it does not disrupt the orderly process
of justice. (See Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915; People
v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 403-407.) 
¿ 
A motion to be relieved as counsel
must be made on Judicial Council Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion),
MC-052 (Declaration), and MC-053 (Proposed Order). (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362,
subds. (a), (c), (e).) The requisite forms must be served “on the client and on
all parties that have appeared in the case.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1362,
subd. (d).)

Analysis and Conclusion
Hughes
has filed Judicial Council Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion), MC-052
(Declaration), and MC-053 (Proposed Order). Hughes seeks to be relieved as counsel for Cross Defendant on the
grounds that there has been a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship.
The Court finds this to be proper grounds for withdrawal. (See Estate of
Falco (1987) 188 Cal.App.3d 1004, 1014 (a breakdown in the attorney-client
relationship is grounds for allowing the attorney to withdraw).) 
However, the Court
is concerned about how this withdrawal arose in light of the above-referenced substitution
of attorney.  Counsel failed to appear at
an October 28, 2024 OSC regarding that substitution, as a result of which the
Court set an OSC Re: Sanctions in the Amount of $1,001 as to Former Counsel for
12/16/24. Accordingly, the Court will hear from counsel.
