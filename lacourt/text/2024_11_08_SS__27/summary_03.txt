And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the motion to advance the hearing on Cross Defendant Carolina Casualty Insurance Company's Motion for Summary Judgment (MSJ). The MSJ was served electronically on October 8, 2024, and is timely. The court finds good cause to advance the hearing to January 3, 2025, at 1:30 p.m. The court notes that numerous appellate courts have held that a trial court cannot refuse to consider a timely-filed motion for summary judgment. The court also references several cases that support the requirement that a trial court hear a timely-filed MSJ.
