And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court will hear a motion by attorney Bradford G. Hughes to be relieved as counsel for Cross-Defendant Logistics Academy. Hughes cites an irreparable breakdown in the attorney-client relationship as the reason for his request. The motion is unopposed, and Hughes has filed the required forms, including a notice of motion and a declaration. The court finds that this is proper grounds for allowing Hughes to withdraw as counsel, citing a previous case that held a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship is a valid reason for an attorney to withdraw. However, the court is concerned about how this withdrawal arose, particularly in light of a previously filed substitution of attorney that appeared to be invalid. As a result, the court will hear from Hughes to discuss the matter further.
