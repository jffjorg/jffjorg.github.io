CASE NO./NAME: 22STCV16286 FRANK BLEDSOE vs
TCI TRANSPORTATION SERVICES
Moving Party: Cross Defendant Carolina Casualty Insurance Company
Responding Party: Unopposed
Notice: Sufficient¿ 
 
Ruling: GRANTED
 
On May 17, 2022, Plaintiff filed the present
case, with the trial date currently set for February 18, 2025. Cross Defendant Carolina Casualty Insurance Company moves
to advance the hearing for its Motion for Summary Judgment (MSJ) against Cross
Complainant Transportation Commodities, Inc.,
currently set for March 28, 2025, so it may be
heard before the trial date.
 
Numerous appellate courts have held that a
trial court cannot refuse to consider a timely-filed motion for summary
judgment. "A trial court may not refuse to hear a summary judgment motion
filed within the time limits of [Code of Civil Procedure] section 437c.
[Citation.] Local rules and practices may not be applied so as to prevent the
filing and hearing of such a motion." (Sentry Ins. Co. v. Superior
Court (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 526, 529); accord First State Inc. Co. v.
Superior Court (2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 324, 330 [invalidating case management
order to the extent it precluded filing motions pursuant to section 437c]; Wells
Fargo Bank v. Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 918, 923 [local court
rule that "requires a party filing a complex summary judgment motion to
file the motion six months before the date set for trial is void and
unenforceable because it is inconsistent with section 437c"].) The Sentry
court observed: "We are sympathetic to the problems the trial courts
experience in calendaring and hearing the many motions for summary judgment.
However, the solution to these problems cannot rest in a refusal to hear timely
motions." (Sentry, supra, at p. 530.) 
Motions for Summary Judgment (MSJs) must be
served at least 105 days before trial, or 107 days if served electronically. (Cole
v. Superior Court (2022) 87 Cal.App.5th 84, 88.) Defendant served its MSJ
electronically on October 8, 2024, 133 days before trial. Therefore, the MSJ is
timely, and Cross Defendant is entitled to a hearing on its motion prior to
trial. No opposition was filed
alleging prejudice. The Court finds good cause to advance Cross Defendant’s MSJ to January
3, 2025, at 1:30 p.m.
