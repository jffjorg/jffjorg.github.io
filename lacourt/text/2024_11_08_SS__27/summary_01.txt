And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel initial discovery responses from the defendant, Carminita Corporation, et al. The defendant failed to respond to the plaintiff's discovery requests, including form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for production of documents, despite being served with the requests on June 28, 2024, and having until July 30, 2024, to respond. The court has ordered the defendant to provide complete and verified responses to the discovery requests without objections within 20 days of the date of the ruling.

The plaintiff also requested $1,980 in sanctions, which the court has reduced to $1,000 against the defendant and its attorney of record, jointly and severally, payable to the plaintiff within 20 days. The court has found that the defendant did not act with substantial justification in failing to respond to the discovery requests.
