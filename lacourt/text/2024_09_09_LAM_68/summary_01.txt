**Summary of Action**

* Plaintiff, K.A., was a student at Value Schools and/or Downtown Value Schools, a charter school within the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD).
* Plaintiff alleges sexual molestation during an unspecified period of time from an unnamed employee perpetrator with the defendant San Marino Unified School District (SMUSD).

**Ruling**

* Denied the motion for summary judgment/special adjudication on the complaint.

**Timeliness**

* Plaintiff challenges the motion as untimely, but the court finds that the cutoffs for discovery and discovery-related motions do not apply to a motion for summary judgment.

**California Tort Claims Act**

* LAUSD contends that the California Tort Claims Act bars any claims of liability, but the court finds that the special relationship between the school and the student imposes a duty of care to protect students.

**Duty of Care**

* The court finds that LAUSD has a duty of care to protect students while on campus, and that the standard for determining this duty is the same as that for other duties.
* The court also finds that LAUSD has a duty to supervise students and enforce rules and regulations necessary for their protection.

**Vicarious Liability**

* The court finds that LAUSD is vicariously liable for the actions of its employees, including the alleged perpetrator of the sexual molestation.

* The court grants the motion for summary adjudication on the 4th cause of action, finding that LAUSD may be imputed with liability for the actions of the alleged perpetrator.

**Immunity**

**Intentions**

* The court intends to deny the motion for summary judgment.

**Facts**

* The court finds triable issues of material fact on the issue of negligent duty based on the admitted responsibility for audits of the charter school by LAUSD staff.
