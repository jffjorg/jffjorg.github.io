  ORDER RE:
 
DEFENDANTS EAN
  HOLDINGS, LLC AND ENTERPRISE RENT-A-CAR COMPANY OF LOS ANGELES, LLC’S
  DEMURRER TO COMPLAINT OF PLAINTIFF
 



 
Background
On March 22, 2024, Plaintiff John Anthony Galvan (“Plaintiff”) filed
this action against Defendants Ean Holdings, LLC, Enterprise Rent-A-Car Company
of Los Angeles, LLC, Enterprise Rentacar LLC, and Xujun Zheng. The Complaint
alleges one cause of action for “motor vehicle.” 
EAN Holdings, LLC (“EAN”) and Enterprise Rent-A-Car Company of Los
Angeles, LLC (“Enterprise Los Angeles”) now demur to the Complaint. Plaintiff
opposes.  
Discussion 
As an initial matter, the
Court notes that EAN and Enterprise Los Angeles’s counsel’s declaration in support of the demurrer provides, inter
alia, that “[d]ue to the possible filing of a demurrer, I have attempted to
meet and confer with Plaintiff’s counsel, Daniel DeSantis, Esq. Specifically,
on June 25, 2024, I sent Mr. DeSantis a letter explaining the legal and factual
grounds to dismiss my clients. The letter requested dismissal prior to June 28,
2024 and informed of the filing of the demurrer in the event of no dismissal by
said date.” (Miller Decl., ¶ 8.) 
The Court notes that Mr.
Miller’s declaration does not demonstrate that the parties met and conferred in
person, by telephone, or by video conference, or that Mr. Miller attempted to do so. Pursuant to
Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41, subdivision
(a), “[b]efore filing a demurrer pursuant to this
chapter, the demurring party shall meet and confer in person,
by telephone, or by video conference with the party who filed the pleading
that is subject to demurrer for the purpose of determining whether an agreement
can be reached that would resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer.” (Emphasis
added.) Such meeting and conferring must be done in good faith with an
effort to try to resolve the issues subject to the demurrer. 
In light of the foregoing,
the hearing on EAN and Enterprise Los Angeles’s demurrer is continued to _______________, 2024 at 2:00 p.m. in
Dept. 50.  
EAN and Enterprise Los Angeles are¿ordered to meet¿and confer¿with Plaintiff within 10 days
of the date of this order.¿If the parties are unable to resolve the pleading
issues¿or if the parties are otherwise unable to meet and confer in good faith,
EAN and Enterprise Los Angeles are to¿thereafter¿file and serve¿a
declaration setting forth the efforts to meet and confer in compliance
with¿Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41, subdivision
(a)(3) within 15 days of this order.¿
EAN and Enterprise Los Angeles are ordered to give notice of this order.
