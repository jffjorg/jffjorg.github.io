And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge, Gary Y. Tanaka, has issued a tentative ruling denying Linda Kishikawa's motion to consolidate her case with another case, TRTD, LLC v. Linda Kishikawa, an unlawful detainer action. The judge found that the cases do not involve common questions of law or fact, and that consolidation would not promote trial convenience and economy. The judge also noted that the plaintiff failed to follow the proper procedure for relating the two cases, as required by Los Angeles County Court Rule 3.3(f). Additionally, the judge declined to rule on a request for a stay of the unlawful detainer action, as any such request must be presented in that action.
