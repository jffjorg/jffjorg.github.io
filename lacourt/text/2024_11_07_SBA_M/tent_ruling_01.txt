Linda Kishikawa’s Motion for Consolidation of Cases

 
TENTATIVE RULING
      
            Linda Kishikawa’s Motion for
Consolidation of Cases is denied. 
 
            Background
 
            Plaintiff filed the Complaint on June
10, 2024. The First Amended Complaint was filed on October 25, 2024. Plaintiff
alleges the following facts. This action arises from the recordation of the notice
of default and notice of trustee’s sale and resulting trustee’s sale of
Plaintiff’s former real property located at 15111 Freeman Ave Unit 50,
Lawndale, CA 90260. Plaintiff alleges multiple violations of the Homeowner’s
Bill of Rights Act (“HBOR”) as well as other causes of action. Plaintiff
alleges causes of action for: 1. Violation of Civ. Code 2923.5; 2. Violation of
Civ. Code 2924.9; 3.  Wrongful
Foreclosure; 4. Promissory Estoppel; 5. Unfair Business Practices. Defendant
Selene Finance was dismissed on July 24, 2024. 
 
            Request for Judicial Notice
 
            Defendant’s request for judicial
notice is granted pursuant to Evidence Code 452(c)(d) and (h).
 
Motion to Consolidate
 
The trial court has discretion to consolidate actions
involving common questions of law or fact. 
Code Civ. Proc., §1048.  The
purpose of consolidation is “to promote trial convenience and economy by
avoiding duplication of procedure, particularly in the proof of issues common
to both actions.”  Estate of Baker (1982) 131 Cal.App.3d 471, 485.
 
The court generally considers the following: (1)
timeliness of the motion, i.e., whether granting consolidation would delay the
trial of any of the cases involved; (2) complexity, i.e., whether joining the
actions involved would make the trial too confusing or complex for a jury; and
(3) prejudice, i.e, whether consolidation would adversely affect the rights of
any party.  State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1956) 47 Cal.2d
428, 430–31; Todd-Stenberg v. Dalkon
Shield Claimants Trust (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 976, 978-79.
 
Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.300 states:
“A pending civil case is related to another pending
civil case, or to a civil case that was dismissed with or without prejudice, or
to a civil case that was disposed of by judgment, if the cases:
(1) Involve the same parties and are based on the same
or similar claims;
(2) Arise from the same or substantially identical
transactions, incidents, or events requiring the determination of the same or
substantially identical questions of law or fact;
(3) Involve claims against, title to, possession of,
or damages to the same property; or
(4) Are likely for other reasons to require
substantial duplication of judicial resources if heard by different judges.”
 
Plaintiff moves
for an order to consolidate the instant action with Case No. 24IWUD01332, titled
TRTD, LLC v. Linda Kishikawa, an unlawful detainer action. Plaintiff argues
that the actions involve fundamental common issues of law and fact,
contain common parties, and that consolidation will promote judicial resources.
Plaintiff contends that she will suffer irreparable harm if the actions are not
consolidated.
 
Plaintiff may assert affirmative defenses in an
unlawful detainer action if they go to the issue of title or possession of the
subject property.  See, Adler v. Elphick (1986) 184 Cal.App.3d 642, 645-46.  “California law does not prohibit an unlawful
detainer defendant from interposing a defense involving title issues, so long
as the defense, if established, would result in the tenant retaining possession
of the premises.” Coyne v. De Leo
(2018) 26 Cal.App.5th 801, 818.
 
Therefore, the
Court finds that convenience and economy will not be fostered by consolidation
of the cases. The Court finds
that the purpose of consolidation - to promote trial convenience and economy by
avoiding duplication of procedure, particularly in the proof of issues common
to all actions – is not present in the actions. Plaintiff may raise
issues of title in the unlawful detainer action that may support his contention
that she should retain the right to possess the property.  Consolidation is, therefore, not required for
Plaintiff to present these issues of title. 
Instead, consolidation would merely result in further delay and inefficiency
and would not foster the policy of promoting the speedy resolution of UD
actions.
 
In addition, the Court notes that Plaintiff failed to
follow the proper procedure set forth in Los Angeles County Court Rule 3.3(f) to
first obtain an order to relate the two cases which is required prior to filing
a motion for consolidation pursuant to Los Angeles County Court Rule 3.3(g). In
any event, the Court declines to order
the instant action as related to Case No. 24IWUD01332.
 
In addition, while not set
forth in the notice of motion, to the extent that the memorandum of points and
authorities included stray requests for a stay of the UD action, the Court
declines to rule upon any such request for a stay of the UD action as any
request for a stay of that action must be presented in that action.
 
Therefore, the Motion for
Consolidation of Cases is denied.
 
Defendant is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
