[1] The Court notes that Plaintiff’s opposition filed on
October 25, 2023 was titled “Amended Complaint to Defendant Demurrer to
Plaintiff’s Complaint.”  Thus, the Clerk
of the Court deemed the opposition as Plaintiff’s  First Amended Complaint and filed it as such which
was erroneous.  To correct the error, the
Court orders that the Clerk of the Court change the description of Plaintiff’s
filing to “Opposition to Demurrer” and delete any reference in the Court’s
docket that Plaintiff has filed a first amended complaint as of October 25,
2023.
