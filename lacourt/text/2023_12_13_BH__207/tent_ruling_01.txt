MOTION
 
On November 4, 2022, Plaintiff Felix Guo (“Plaintiff”), a minor,
through his guardian ad litem, Min Xie (“Petitioner”) filed this action against
Defendant Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation for negligence and premises
liability, stemming from injures Plaintiff suffered after he fell on a metal
staircase, causing the tip of his right middle finger to become severed
off.  
 
On October 10, 2023, a Notice of Settlement of the Entire Case was
filed.
 
On November 15, 2023, Petitioner filed a Petition for Approval of
Compromise of Claim for a Minor.  In
section 11.b.(3), Petitioner states that Petitioner “is not” a plaintiff in the
same action with the claimant.  (See
Petition, § 11.b.(3).)  The Court finds
that the representation is incorrect. 
However, the Court finds the error to be harmless as Petitioner
represents that the entire action will be dismissed with prejudice upon
approval of the compromise.  (See
Petition, § 10.c.)
 
ANALYSIS
 
            The parties have agreed to settle
the case for a total amount of $450,000. 
The Court finds that Petitioner is guardian ad litem of Plaintiff, as
the Court granted Petitioner’s application for appointment of guardian ad litem
on November 14, 2022.  The Court also
finds the gross settlement, the attorneys’ fees, medical expenses and other
expenses (costs) to be fair and reasonable. 

 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
Petitioner Min Xie’s Petition to Approve Compromise of Claim for a
Minor is granted and the Court has approved the order.
