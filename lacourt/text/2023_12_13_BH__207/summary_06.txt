And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendant's motion to strike references to punitive damages from the complaint is granted. The plaintiff's opposition to the motion was untimely, but the court considers it and the reply briefs filed by the defendant. The court finds that the plaintiff's allegations do not support a claim for punitive damages because they do not demonstrate that the defendant's failure to stop at the scene of the accident proximately caused any further injury to the plaintiff beyond those caused by the initial accident. The court notes that the plaintiff does not allege any facts suggesting that the defendant's failure to stop was a conscious disregard for the plaintiff's rights or safety. The court also finds that the plaintiff has not demonstrated that there are additional facts that could be added to the complaint to support a claim for punitive damages.
