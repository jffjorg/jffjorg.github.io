MOTION
 
Plaintiff Federal Insurance Company (“Plaintiff”) moves to consolidate
Teresija Sigmund v. Darlington Villas Homeowners Association, Inc., et al.
(Super. Ct. L.A. County, 2023, No. 23SMCV01467) with Federal Insurance
Company v. Loya Roofing Co., Inc. (Super. Ct. L.A. County, 2023, No. 23SMCV02768)
for all purposes.  The motion is
unopposed.    
 
ANALYSIS
 
Code of Civil Procedure,
section 1048, subdivision (a) provides:
 
When actions involving a
common question of law or fact are pending before the court, it may order a
joint hearing or trial of any or all the matters in issue in the actions; it
may order all the actions consolidated and it may make such orders concerning
proceedings therein as may tend to avoid unnecessary costs or delay.
 
            Per Local Rule 3.3, subdivision (g),
“Cases may not be consolidated unless they are in the same department.  A motion to consolidate two or more cases may
be noticed and heard after the cases, initially filed in different departments,
have been related into a single department, or if the cases were already
assigned to that department.”  (Super.
Ct. L.A. County, Local Rules, rule 3.3(g)(1).) 
Once the Court relates the cases, the Court may consolidate the actions
and order a joint trial on matters that “involve[e] a common question of law or
fact.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1048, subd.
(a).)
 
            Plaintiff
filed a notice of related case on July 21, 2023, which the Court rejected.  After discussion with counsel for Plaintiff
and Defendants at the status conference held on November 30, 2023, the Court vacated
the denial of the Notice of Related Case and deemed the cases related.  (December 1, 2023 Minute Order.)  
 
            Plaintiff
contends Defendant Loya Roofing, Co., Inc. dba Actual Roofing Co. in the
“Federal” case ending in -2768 is also defendant in the “Sigmund” case ending
-1467, that both cases assert a cause of action for negligence, and both
actions arise from the same flood of the same residential building involving
adjacent units 3 and 4.  Plaintiff
further contends that consolidation will avoid duplicative evidence procedures
and avoid potentially inconsistent adjudications.
 
            As
such, the Court finds that consolidation is warranted as the cases present
common issues of fact regarding the same underlying incident.  
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
The Court grants Plaintiff’s motion to consolidate Teresija Sigmund
v. Darlington Villas Homeowners Association, Inc., et al. (Super. Ct. L.A.
County, 2023, No. 23SMCV01467) with Federal Insurance Company v. Loya
Roofing Co., Inc. (Super. Ct. L.A. County, 2023, No. 23SMCV02768).  
 
The Court further orders that the cases are consolidated for all
purposes and Teresija Sigmund v. Darlington Villas Homeowners Association,
Inc., et al. (Super. Ct. L.A. County, 2023, No. 23SMCV01467) is designated
as the lead case per California Rules of Court, rule 3.350(b).  The Court further orders that all proceedings
and hearing dates in Federal Insurance Company v. Loya Roofing Co., Inc.
(Super. Ct. L.A. County, 2023, No. 23SMCV02768) are vacated.
 
            Plaintiff shall provide notice of
the Court’s ruling and file a proof of service of such.
