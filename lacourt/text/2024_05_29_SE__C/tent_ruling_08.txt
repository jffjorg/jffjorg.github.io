 Case Number:  24NWCV00981    Hearing Date:   May 29, 2024    Dept:  C Cerritos
Retail Centercal, LLC vs. Wokcano Cerritos, LLC, Case No. 24NWCV00981
This
is an unlawful detainer action. Plaintiff Cerritos Retal Centercal, LLC applies
ex parte for an order: 1) shortening time for hearing on Defendant Wokcano
Cerritos, LLC’s motion to set aside default; 2) denying Defendant’s demurrer
per the Court’s May 9, 2024 order that Defendant file an answer by May 30,
2024; and 3) setting a trial readiness conference and a trial date set on or
before June 19, 2024.
 
A
party may seek ex parte relief upon an affirmative factual showing
"irreparable harm, immediate danger, or any other statutory basis for
granting relief ex parte." (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1202(c).)
 
On
May 9, 2024, the Court denied Defendant’s motion to quash service of summons
and complaint and ordered Defendant to answer within five days. On May 16,
2024, Plaintiff filed a request for entry of default judgment. On May 20, 2024,
Defendant filed a demurrer without motion to strike which is currently
scheduled for January 14, 2025. On May 22, 2024, Defendant filed a motion to
set aside default which is currently set for January 22, 2025.  
 
Unlawful
detainer actions are summary proceedings.  Plaintiff asserts that
Defendant remains in possession of the premises without the landlord’s consent
while daily damages accrue at the rate of $1,239.77 per day. (Decl. Zarnighian,
¶ 3.) 
 
The
Court is inclined to advance Defendant’s motion to set aside default and will
hear from the parties regarding scheduling of dates.
