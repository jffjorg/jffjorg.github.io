TENTATIVE ORDER
 
Defendant

to Plaintiff Lucia Reyes is GRANTED.  Monetary
sanctions are DENIED. Plaintiff Lucia Reyes must serve responses
without objections within 30 days. 
 
Moving
Party to give NOTICE.
 
The
motion is unopposed as of May 24, 2024. 
 
 
Defendant
MED (DE), LLC (“Defendant”) owns and operates an apartment complex that
consists of two hundred and fifty-seven apartment units. Plaintiffs are tenants
in the building. Plaintiffs allege they have experienced various problems with
the building, rendering it uninhabitable and breaching the implied warranty of
quiet enjoyment and habitability. 
 
Defendant MED (DE), LLC moves to
compel responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One from Plaintiff Lucia Reyes. 
 
Legal Standard
 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2030.290, subdivision (b) allows the propounding
party to file a motion to compel responses to interrogatories if a response has
not been received.  If responses are
untimely, the responding party waives objections. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290,
subd. (a).)  
 
Discussion
 
Defendant served Plaintiff with form
interrogatories and requests for production of documents on June 15, 2023, by
electronic mail. (Decl. Lezon, ¶¶ 2, 3, Ex. A.) Responses were due on
or before July 20, 2023. (Id., ¶4.) Defendant
granted an extension to September 14, 2023. (Id., ¶ 5.) Despite
this extension, Defendant has not received responses. (Id., ¶ 6.)   
 
Accordingly, the motion is GRANTED.  Plaintiff is ordered to serve responses
without objections within 30 days.  
 
Sanctions:  Discovery sanctions may not be imposed
under Section 2023.030, even together with Section 2023.010, absent another
provision of the Discovery Act that authorizes the imposition of sanctions. (City
of L. A. v. PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLC (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 466,
500.) Sanctions with respect to interrogatories are only authorized against a
party who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel responses. (Code
of Civ. Proc. § 2030.290, subd. (c).) Here, sanctions are denied because the
motion is unopposed.
