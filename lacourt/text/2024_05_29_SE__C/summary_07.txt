And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The defendant, General Motors, LLC, has filed a demurrer to the plaintiff, Daniel Ortiz's, complaint, arguing that the sixth cause of action, fraudulent inducement, does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. However, the plaintiff filed a first amended complaint on May 15, 2024, which supersedes the original pleading. As a result, the defendant's demurrer and motion to strike punitive damages from the complaint are moot.
