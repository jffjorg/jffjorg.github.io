v. Viele, Case No. 23NWCV00382
This
is about a motor vehicle incident. Defendant Katherine Marie Viele seeks ex
parte relief to advance the hearing for her motion for terminating sanctions.
It is currently set for February 4, 2025.

"irreparable harm, immediate danger, or any other statutory basis for
granting relief ex parte." (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1202(c).)
 
Trial
is currently set for January 27, 2025, and Defendant asserts that it will be
prejudiced if the motion is not heard before then. (Decl. Kelly, ¶ 7.)

2024, and continues it to Tuesday, August 27, 2024, at 10:30 A.M. in Dept.
