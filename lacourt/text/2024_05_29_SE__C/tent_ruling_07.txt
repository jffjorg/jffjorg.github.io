TENTATIVE RULING
 
I.            
Defendant General Motors LLC’s demurrer to complaint is MOOT. 
 
II.           
Defendant General Motor LLC’s motion to strike punitive damages from
Plaintiff’s complaint is MOOT. 
 
Moving Party to give NOTICE.
 
This
is a Song-Beverly action. On December 7, 2023, Plaintiff Daniel Ortiz filed a
complaint against General Motors, LLC.
 
Defendant
demurs to the sixth cause of action of fraudulent inducement on the grounds
that it does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. 
 
On
May 15, 2024, Plaintiff filed a first amended complaint. An amended pleading
supersedes the original one, which ceases to perform any function as a
pleading. (State Compensation Ins. Fund v. Super. Ct. (2010) 184
Cal.App.4th 1124, 1130.) Because there is one complaint in a civil action, the
filing of an amended complaint moots a motion directed to a prior complaint. (Id.
at 1131.) 
 
Based
on the above, Defendant’s demurrer and motion to strike punitive damages from
Plaintiff’s complaint is MOOT.
