Defendant
Raymond Lieu’s Motion to Set Aside Default is GRANTED.  The Answer RECEIVED on March 21, 2024 is not

Defendant is ordered to separately file and serve the Answer within 5

Moving
Party to give NOTICE.
 
 
Plaintiff
is the owner of two commercial properties. Defendants were the previous tenants
of these two properties. Plaintiff prevailed in two unlawful detainer actions
against Defendants to regain possession of the properties after Defendants held
over the expiration of their leasehold. Plaintiff now seeks the rental balance
incurred while Defendants held over their lease and damages for costs to restore
the properties and clear the trash and debris left by Defendants upon the
transfer of possession.
 
On
February 13, 2024, default was entered against Defendant Raymond Lieu (“Defendant”).  
 
On
March 21, 2024, Defendant applied ex parte to set aside default based on
Code of Civil Procedure sections 473 and 473.5.  Defendant also submitted a Proposed Answer.  The motion was continued to today’s date for
hearing.  
 
Discussion
 
Code of Civil Procedure
section 473, subdivision (b) states: 
 
The court may, upon any
terms as may be just, relieve a party or his or her legal representative from a
judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against him or her
through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. Application for this relief shall be accompanied by a copy
of the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed therein, otherwise the
application shall not be granted, and shall be made within a reasonable
time, in no case exceeding six months, after the judgment, dismissal, order, or
proceeding was taken.  
 
The
purpose of mandatory relief is to alleviate the hardship on parties who lose
their day in court due to an inexcusable failure to act by their attorneys. (Rodriguez v. Brill
(2015) 234 Cal.App.4th 715, 723.) “Section 473 is often applied liberally where
the party in default moves promptly to seek relief, and the party opposing the
motion will not suffer prejudice if relief is granted. [Citations.] In such
situations ‘very slight evidence will be required to justify a court in setting
aside the default.’ [Citations.] [¶] Moreover, because the law strongly favors
trial and disposition on the merits, any doubts in applying section 473 must be
resolved in favor of the party seeking relief from default.” (Fasuyi v.
Permatex, Inc. (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 681, 695.)
 
Here, default was entered on February 13, 2024
and Defendant’s ex parte application to set aside default was filed on March
21, 2024, well within the six-month time period specified in CCP § 473.  Hence, the motion is timely.  
 
As to the merits, Defendant has submitted evidence
that the judgment was taken against him because of his mistake, inadvertence, surprise,
or excusable neglect. Defendant states, “I have never received summons or
complaint and the service of summons has not resulted in actual notice to me to
defend. Had I known of the lawsuit, I would have retained an attorney to
defend.” (Decl. Lieu, ¶ 14.)  Defendant
also states, “Only and first notice or service received by me is the Request
for Court Judgment and other related default judgment packets, in early March
2024, after the Court Judgment was entered against [him] on February 13, 2024.”
(Decl. Lieu, ¶ 16.) Defendant has shown surprise. 
 
Thus,
the Court GRANTS the motion based on Code of Civil Procedure section 473,
subdivision (b).  The
Answer RECEIVED on March 21, 2024 is not deemed filed as of today’s date.  Defendant is ordered to separately file and
serve the answer within 5 court days.
