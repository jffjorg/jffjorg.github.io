Here is a text summary of the tentative ruling:

The tentative ruling continues the Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment/Summary Adjudication to June 20, 2024. The Court orders the Defendant to file an unredacted copy of its motion under seal with the Court by May 31, 2024. Additionally, the Court will strike prefatory words from the Defendant's separate statement, as they do not provide the underlying facts. The Court is unable to adjudicate the issues without an unredacted version of the motion, and the Defendant's separate statement is defective.
