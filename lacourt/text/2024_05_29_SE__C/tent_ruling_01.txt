TENTATIVE RULING
 
     I.       
Defendant Los Angeles Unified School
District’s Motion for Summary Judgment/Summary Adjudication is CONTINUED to
June 20, 2024 at 10:30 a.m. in Dept. SE-C. 

   
II.       
On its own motion, the Court reconsiders
its January 12, 2024 order denying Defendant’s request to conditionally file
under seal its entire motion for summary judgment/summary adjudication.
Defendant is ordered to file an unredacted copy of its motion under seal with
the Court by June 3, 2024.  
 

Moving Party to give notice. 
 
 
Pursuant to the Court’s January 12, 2024 order, Defendant
filed a redacted version of its Motion for Summary Judgment/Summary
Adjudication on April 2, 2024.  Without
an unredacted version of the motion, however, the Court is unable to adjudicate
the issues.  Therefore, on its own motion
(Le Francois v. Goel (2005) 35 Cal.4th 1094) the Court
reconsiders its January 12, 2024 order denying Defendant’s request to
conditionally file under seal its entire motion for summary judgment/summary
adjudication. Defendant is ordered to file an unredacted copy of its motion
under seal with the Court by May 31, 2024. 

 
Additionally, when reviewing Plaintiff’s Response to
Defendant’s Separate Statement, it is apparent to the Court that Defendant’s
Separate Statement of Undisputed Material Facts is defective.  CCP 437c, subd. (b)(1) requires the moving
party to set forth “plainly and concisely all material facts that the moving
party contends are undisputed.”  In
Defendant’s separate statement, most of the “undisputed facts” begin with “G.Z.
alleges …” or “R.Z. testified …”  At
issue in a separate statement is not what a witness alleges or testified about,
but rather what the underlying facts are – the events or conditions witnesses
said they perceived. (Reeves v. Safeway Stores, Inc. (2004) 121
Cal.App.4th 95, 106.) 
Therefore, the Court will strike prefatory words such as “G.Z. alleges
…” or “R.Z. testified …” wherever they appear in Defendant’s separate
statement. (CCP § 436 (“The
court may … (a) Strike out any irrelevant, false or improper matter inserted in
any pleading”).)
