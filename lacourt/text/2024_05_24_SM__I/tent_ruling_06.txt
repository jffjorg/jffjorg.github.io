 Case Number:  23SMCV06028    Hearing Date:   May 24, 2024    Dept:  I The matter is here for an FSC.  This is a UD matter and plaintiff sought a
speedy trial pursuant to the UD statutes. 
The court gave its FSC order on May 13, 2024, and warned the parties
that they needed to get started right away on the FSC materials.  On May 22, 2024, the court received some FSC
materials, but they were filed only by plaintiff with no apparent input from
the defense and no explanation as to why the parties did not follow the court’s
order that they collaborate and file joint materials.  As it turns out, the court will be engaged in
trial on the currently-set trial date. 
This case will therefore TRAIL that case, and some other UD cases that
are also set.  If the parties want to
attempt to comply with the court’s FSC order, they may file the required joint
materials by Thursday, May 30, 2024.  If
defendant does not comply or attempt to comply, the court is likely to find
that the defense can call no witnesses and introduce no exhibits.
 
All of that said, if HMFC has vacated, then possession is
not at issue at all.
