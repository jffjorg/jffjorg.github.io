 Case Number:  23SMCV04284    Hearing Date:   May 24, 2024    Dept:  I The application to dismiss the case is DENIED.  The court’s docket notes that Miles timely
filed the second amended complaint on April 29, 2024, and the court has a file
stamped copy.  The court does not know
why it was not on the docket Mashion saw or why Miles elected not to respond to
counsel’s inquiry, thereby leading to the ex parte application and the
need for the court to investigate the matter. 
The court will not hear argument on this matter, but counsel for Miles
is ORDERED to provide Mashion’s counsel with a file stamped copy within 24 hours.  The court STRONGLY urges the parties to act
more professionally.
