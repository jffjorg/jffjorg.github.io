Here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court is considering a final status conference in a UD case, where the plaintiff has demanded a speedy trial. The defendant did not participate in the Fast Settlement Conference (FSC) process and did not post rent for the delay period. The court warned both parties of the consequences of non-compliance with the FSC order. The court will hold a further status conference on May 31, 2024, to advise on the trial schedule. If the defendant meets and confers with the plaintiff to provide joint FSC materials by May 31, the court may consider vacating the sanction. The court will rule today on the in limine motions.
