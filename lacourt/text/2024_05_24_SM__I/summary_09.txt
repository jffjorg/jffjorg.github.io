The court warned the parties of the consequences of not participating in the FSC process. The court will hold a further status conference on May 31, 2024, to discuss the trial schedule and potential conflicts with another trial. The plaintiff's materials will be binding on the parties, and the defendant will be precluded from calling witnesses or introducing exhibits if they do not meet and confer with the plaintiff and provide joint FSC materials.
