And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses the case of 23SMCV06028, a Unlawful Detainer (UD) matter. The plaintiff sought a speedy trial, and the court gave a Fast-Track Settlement Conference (FSC) order on May 13, 2024. However, the parties failed to follow the court's order and file joint materials. As a result, the court will proceed with the trial on the currently-set date, and the case will be trailed. The defendant is given an opportunity to file joint materials by May 30, 2024. If the defendant fails to comply, the court will likely find that the defense cannot call witnesses or introduce exhibits.
