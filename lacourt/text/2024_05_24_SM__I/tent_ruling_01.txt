  Case Number:  22SMCV01207    Hearing Date:   May 24, 2024    Dept:  I The matter is here for a final status conference and order
to show cause re: partial dismissal due to settlement.  Since that time, the court has received a
stipulation that appears to resolve much of the remainder of the case.  It appears that the entire case has now
settled except ADCO’s cross-complaint against a cross-defendant who is in
default.  Given that, there will be no
trial and the court understands why no FSC papers were filed.  The trial date is VACATED.  The court will continue the OSC re: Dismissal
(Settlement) for 60 days and will also set an OSC re: Entry of Default Judgment
for the same day.  No appearances are
necessary if the dismissal and judgment have been entered prior to that
date.  The court anticipates the judgment
will be made pursuant to section 585. 
The court advises ADCO to ensure that its ducks are in a row and that
service was proper on the defaulted defendant. 
ADCO is to give notice.  The court
will discuss the specific date with counsel.
