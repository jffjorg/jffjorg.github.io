 Case Number:  24SMCV01448    Hearing Date:   May 24, 2024    Dept:  I The matter is here for a final status conference.  The matter is a UD case and plaintiff
demanded a speedy trial pursuant to those statutes.  On May 17, 2024, the court received from
plaintiff its statement of the case, witness list, exhibit list, jury
instructions, and special verdict form. 
Plaintiff states that the defense has not cooperated in providing these
materials.  At the trial setting
conference held on May 15, 2024, the court warned the parties (including
defendant) of the consequences of not participating in the FSC process.  Pursuant to the local rules, the plaintiff’s
materials will be binding on the parties and defendant will be precluded from
calling witnesses or introducing exhibits.  

 
Jury fees have been posted. 
Normally, the trial would begin on the scheduled date—June 3, 2024.  However, the court may be engaged in
trial.  If so, this case will need to
trail that one.  Further, there is
another UD case also set to try on June 3, 2024, so the court would have to
decide which would take priority.  The
court orders a further status conference to be held on May 31, 2024, at 8:30 am
so the court can advise on those things. 
If, on or before May 31, 2024, defendant meets and confers with plaintiff
and joint FSC materials are provided, and if the trial is in fact continued due
to the court’s conflict, the court would consider vacating the sanction
discussed above.
