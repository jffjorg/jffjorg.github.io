And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling is in response to a motion filed by Claimant Louise Kelley to vacate a default and allow her claim to the surplus funds. The surplus funds, in the amount of $87,759.58, were deposited with the court clerk on April 27, 2023. The court finds that Kelley may have misunderstood the proceedings and did not fully articulate why service of the notice at the 402 W. Broadway address was insufficient. Despite this, the court will deem Kelley's motion as a claim to the surplus funds and grant her claim. The court orders that the surplus funds be released to Kelley.
