            v.
 
THE LAW OFFICE OF
  LEIBLE, MIRETSKY & MOSELY, LLC, et al.,
                        Defendants.

  22STCV29167
 
  Hearing Date:  April 22, 2024
 
[TENTATIVE] order RE:
PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION of the court’s august 7,
  2023 order



 
Background
            On
September 8, 2022, Plaintiff Gerald Montgomery (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant
malpractice action against Defendants Leible, Miretsky & Mosely, LLP
(erroneously sued as “The Law Office of Leible, Meretsky & Mosely, LLC”)
(“Firm”), Michael Miretsky (“Miretsky”), and Carlyn Blake (“Blake”). 
            The
action was listed as a personal injury action and initially assigned to
Department 30 of the Personal Injury Hub Court presided by the Honorable Jill
Feeney. (Notice of Assignment dated September 8, 2022.) 
            On
October 31, 2022, Defendants collectively filed a demurrer and motion to strike
portions of the complaint. 
On November 1,
2022, Plaintiff voluntarily dismissed Defendant Blake from the instant action
without prejudice. 
On December 20,
2022, the Court, with the Honorable Jill Feeney presiding, referred the instant
action to Department 1 for reassignment on the basis that the action was
erroneously filed as a personal injury action. (See December 20, 2022, Minute
Order.) Thereafter, on December 27, 2022, Department 1 assigned the instant
action to the current department (Department 26). (See December 27, 2022,
Minute Order.) 
Throughout the
action, Plaintiff has repeatedly filed requests for entry of default and for
default judgment against Defendants Firm and Miretsky, which were routinely
rejected because responsive pleadings had been filed. (See Rejections of
Defaults filed on November 2, 2022 and February 2, 2023.) 
On January 30,
2023, Plaintiff filed a Motion for Default and for Default Judgment. On
February 14, 2023, Plaintiff filed an ex parte application to advance his
Motion for Default and Default Judgment. The Court granted the ex parte
application advancing the motion to February 15, 2023, and denied the motion on
the merits. (See February 15, 2023 Minute Order.)
On February 27,
2023, Plaintiff filed a motion to set aside and vacate the February 15, 2023
Order. On April 5, 2023, Defendants Firm and Miretsky (collectively,
“Defendants”) refiled their demurrer and motion to strike with a new hearing
date of May 11, 2023. 
On April 19,
2023, Plaintiff filed an amended motion to vacate the February 15, 2023 Order.
On April 24, 2023, Plaintiff filed an ex parte application to advance the
motions to set aside and vacate the February 15, 2023 order, which the Court
took off calendar because Plaintiff failed to appear at the hearing. 
On May 8, 2023,
Plaintiff filed a renewed ex parte application to advance his motion to set
aside and vacate the February 15, 2023 Order. The Court granted this
application and advanced Plaintiff’s motion to be heard in conjunction with
Defendants’ demurrer and motion to strike. On May 11, 2023, the Court took
Plaintiff’s motion and Defendants’ demurrer and motion to strike under
submission. (See May 11, 2023 Minute Order.)
On May 15, 2023,
Plaintiff filed an ex parte application titled “PLAINTIFF NOTICE OF EX PARTE
MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION OF DEFAULT & DEFAULT JUDGMENT FILED 1/30/23
WHICH INCLUDED RECONSIDERATION (IF APPLICABLE)”. On May 17, 2023, Plaintiff
filed two identical ex parte applications titled “Court Signed Proposed Order,
File with Motion to Vacate Et. Al. on 4/19/2023.”
On May 19, 2023,
the Court denied Plaintiff’s ex parte applications, sustained Defendants’
demurrer without leave, granted Defendant’s motion to strike without leave to
amend, and ordered Defendants to file a proposed judgment of dismissal.
On May 23, 2023,
Defendants filed a proposed judgment of dismissal.
On May 23, 203,
Plaintiff filed a motion for reconsideration of the Courts’ May 19, 2023 Order.
On July 13, 2023, the Court advanced the hearing date for this motion from
October 24, 2023 to August 7, 2023.
On July 18,
2023, Plaintiff filed a notice of appeal of the Court’s May 19, 2023 Order. 
On August 7,
2023, the Court took Plaintiff’s motion for reconsideration off calendar
because the pending appeal divested the Court of jurisdiction to consider the
motion on the merits. 
On August 21,
2023, Plaintiff filed a subsequent motion titled “Application for
Reconsideration to Modify & Amend the Minute Order and Order Filed 8/7/2023.”
On April 8,
2024, Defendants filed their opposition to the instant motion.
            No reply
has been received. 
 
Legal
Standard
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure §
1008(a), a motion for reconsideration must be brought “within 10 days after service
upon the party of written notice of entry of the order and based upon new or
different facts, circumstances, or law, make application to the same judge or
court that made the order, to reconsider the matter and modify, amend, or
revoke the prior order.” (New York Times Co. v. Superior Court (2005)
135 Cal.App.4th 206, 212.)  
Discussion
            Plaintiff seeks to modify and amend
the August 7, 2023 Order on the basis that it misstates and/or omits relevant
facts. (Motion, Montgomery Decl. ¶¶ 9-14.)  
As previously determined, the Court
continues to lack jurisdiction to hear the instant motion because Plaintiff
filed an appeal of the Court’s May 19, 2023 Order, and that appeal is still
pending. (See Varian Medical Systems, Inc. v. Deflino (2005) 35 Cal.4th
180, 196-197 [“Under [Code of Civil Procedure] section 916, ‘the trial court is
divested of’ subject matter jurisdiction over any matter embraced in or
affected by the appeal during the pendency of that appeal.”)  While the instant motion seeks reconsideration
of the Court’s August 7, 2023 Order, any determination on this motion could
render the pending appeal futile because the order that Plaintiff seeks
reconsideration on is tied to the order that is on appeal.  Thus, reconsideration is improper at this
juncture. 
Accordingly, the Court lacks jurisdiction
to hear this motion due to Plaintiff’s pending appeal seeking review of matters
that embrace the matters at issue in the instant motion for reconsideration.
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s Motion
for Reconsideration of the Court’s August 7, 2023 Order is TAKEN OFF CALENDAR.
As previously instructed, Plaintiff may renew its motions for reconsideration
within ten days of issuance of remittitur after the appeal is decided. In such
an instance, Plaintiff must file and serve a properly noticed ex parte
application requesting that the Court re-calendar the Motion for
Reconsideration of the Court’s May 19, 2023 Order.  
All parties are
ordered to appear for a status conference on the status of the appeal on November
22, 2025, at 8:30 am.  
Defendant to give notice.
