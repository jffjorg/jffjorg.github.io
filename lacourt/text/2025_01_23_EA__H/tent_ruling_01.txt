I.        Background 
Plaintiff
Wasif Siddique (“Plaintiff”) alleges as follows:
On or about November 9, 2015, Plaintiff
entered into a written agreement with SKC Construction (“SKC”), wherein SKC
agreed to perform a new home construction project (“Project”) at Plaintiff’s
property located at 2502 Razzak Circle in Diamond Bar (“subject property”) for
the fixed price of $1,214,800.00 (“Contract”). Plaintiff has paid SKC
approximately $2,000,000.00 for the Project; however, the work remains
incomplete and the work that has been completed is subpar. SKC has abandoned
the Project. 
On
April 2, 2024, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint, asserting causes of
action against SKC, Sohail Khan (“Khan”), Business Alliance Insurance Company
(“Business Alliance”) and Does 1-20 for: (1) breach of contract, (2)
negligence, (3) fraud, and (4) recovery from contractor’s license board.

On
August 6, 2024, Business Alliance filed a cross-complaint, asserting causes of
action against SKC, Khan and Roes 1-25 for: (1) indemnity, (2) reimbursement (declaratory
relief), and (3) breach of contract 
On
November 7, 2024, the Clerk entered default against SKC and Khan on Business
Alliance’s cross-complaint.
Pending
before the Court are Business Alliance’s motions to compel various discovery responses.
 
II.      Legal Standard 
Responses
to requests for interrogatories and requests for production of documents are
due 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.250, subd. (a).) “If a party . . . fails to serve a timely response . . . [t]he
party [propounding the interrogatories or making the demand for production] may
move for an order compelling response[s].” (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (b), 2031.300, subd. (b).) “The court
shall impose a monetary sanction . . . against any party, person, or attorney
who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to
interrogatories [or a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling],
unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust . . .” (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (c), 2031.300,
subd. (c).)
