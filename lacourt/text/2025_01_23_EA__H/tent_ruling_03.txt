 Case Number:  24PSCV03694    Hearing Date:   January 23, 2025    Dept:  H Cao v. Wilshire
Commercial Capital LLC,
Case No. 24PSCV03694The Court declines to issue a tentative ruling on
Defendant’s motion to compel arbitration at this juncture, but will hear
further from the parties at the time of the hearing, particularly as to the
following issues: (1) whether Plaintiff was representing, in the U.S. Bank “ID
Theft Affidavit” attached as Exhibit A to Plaintiff’s declaration, that he
actually had a U.S. Bank account as a co-signatory with Linda Cao or that any
such account claimed to exist with the accompanying Monrovia address was fraudulent;
(2) how an “unknown third person” would have been in possession of the subject
vehicle at the time the notary public took the photograph; and (3) the bases
for Defendant’s claims that (a) the voided check could not have been “doctored”
because the transfer would not go through if Plaintiff’s name were not actually
on the account and that (b) the gas bill is not a photo, but was obtained from
logging into an account.
It is the Court’s understanding that Plaintiff
intends to be present at the time of the hearing “to verify that he is not the
person depicted in Exhibit B of the Sch[w]artz Declaration.” (Opp., 2:18-19;
3:19-22.) The Court reserves the right to take live testimony from Plaintiff at
the time of the hearing.
