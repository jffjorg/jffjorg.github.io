Summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has denied Enrique Jacobo's motion to quash service of summons and complaint. Jacobo argued that the service was improper or incomplete, but the Judge found that these arguments are not relevant to a motion to quash summons and complaint, which challenges the validity of service, not whether or not a defendant is a properly named party. The Judge also found that Jacobo's reliance on previous cases was misplaced, as those cases involved different facts and circumstances. The Judge's ruling is based on the relevant laws and court precedents, including Code Civ. Proc., ยง 418.10 and Summers v. McClanahan (2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 403.
