And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has decided to take off the calendar all of Ronald Williams' motions to compel further responses to requests for admissions and requests for production of documents. Instead, the judge has appointed a Discovery Referee to hear and determine all discovery motions and disputes in the case. The judge has ordered that the parties pay the referee's fees equally. The appointment of the Discovery Referee is necessary to resolve the extensive discovery disputes and to avoid further drain on judicial resources. The judge has also ordered that the parties engage in the process for obtaining an agreement on the selection of the referee. If no agreement is reached, the parties will engage in the process set forth in CCP § 640(b) to select the referee.
