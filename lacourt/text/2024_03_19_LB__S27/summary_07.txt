```

And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling denies the plaintiff's motion to strike each affirmative defense in the defendants' answer. The court finds that the plaintiff's attorney's meet and confer efforts were insufficient, as they only sent one email invitation instead of attempting to call the defense counsel. Additionally, the court notes that there is no authority for using a motion to strike to excise entire affirmative defenses from an answer, and instead a demurrer should be filed under CCP §430.20(a). As a result, the motion to strike is denied. The parties are reminded of a Case Management Conference scheduled for the same date as the hearing on the motion to strike, and are asked to make arrangements to appear remotely.
