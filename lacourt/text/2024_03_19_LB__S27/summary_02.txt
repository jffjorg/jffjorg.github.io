And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling denies the defendant's motion to compel the PMK of Ridge Surgical Center, LLC to appear for deposition and produce documents due to service issues with the deposition subpoena. The court finds that CCP ยง2020.220(b) and (c) require personal service of the deposition subpoena on a non-party in order to compel that party to appear and testify. The defendant's proof of personal service does not establish proper service of the deposition subpoena. The judge orders the defendant to give notice and asks the parties to continue attempting to work together to resolve any issues relating to the deposition.
