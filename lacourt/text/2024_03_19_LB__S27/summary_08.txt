And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding a demurrer filed by the Defendant on November 6, 2023. The demurrer was initially set for hearing on June 13, 2024, but was continued to March 19, 2024, at a Case Management Conference on January 2, 2024. However, to date, the Defendant has failed to provide notice as ordered by the Court. As a result, the hearing on the demurrer is being continued to its original date of June 13, 2024. The Defendant is ordered to provide notice, and parties who intend to submit on the tentative must email the Court by the instructions provided on the court website. If the Court does not receive an email indicating the parties' intention to submit on the tentative and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion may be taken off calendar.
