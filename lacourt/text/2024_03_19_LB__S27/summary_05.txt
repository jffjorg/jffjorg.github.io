And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case regarding a motion by the plaintiff. The hearing was originally scheduled for January 18, 2024, but was continued to March 19, 2024, to allow the parties to meet and confer with the court's prior similar orders as guidance. At the hearing, the defendant appeared, but the plaintiff did not. The court adopted its tentative ruling as its final ruling.

The court has ordered the parties to file a joint statement listing each discovery item in dispute, along with the most recent response to that item and each party's statement on why a further response should or should not be ordered. The parties must also file briefs and declarations detailing their efforts to meet and confer and making any arguments against the imposition of sanctions.

The plaintiff has filed a supplemental brief and declaration, establishing that the defendant failed to respond to multiple efforts to meet and confer and has not served supplemental responses or documents. The defendant has not filed anything supplemental concerning the motion. Therefore, the court has granted the motion in full, ordering the defendant to serve supplemental responses without objection within 10 days.

The court has also ordered the plaintiff to give notice and has warned the parties that if they do not submit on the tentative ruling, they should arrange to appear remotely at the hearing.
