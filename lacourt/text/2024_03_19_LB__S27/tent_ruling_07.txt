 Case Number:  23LBCV01255    Hearing Date:   March 19, 2024    Dept:  S27 1.    
Background Facts
Plaintiff, Eric Cleveland filed this action against Defendants, Cancun
Properties LLC, Anjai Savire LLC, and Sirenitas Restaurant, Inc. for violations
of the ADA and UNRUH, contending he has osteoarthritis and Defendants’ property
is in violation of the ADA and UNRUH because it needs to have an asphalt
overlap in the parking area and needs to have work done on the disabled parking
space for the property.  
 
Defendants filed an answer on 9/13/23. 
The answer includes a general denial and 33 affirmative defenses.    
 
2.     Motion to Strike
Plaintiff moves to strike each affirmative defense in the answer.  The motion is denied for two reasons.  First, the Court finds Plaintiff’s attorney’s
meet and confer efforts insufficient. 
CCP §435.5 requires the meet and confer to be over the phone or in
person.  Plaintiff’s attorney declares he
sent one email in an attempt to meet and confer.  The Court reviewed the email and finds it
does invite Defense Counsel to meet and confer over the phone, but this is not sufficient.  Plaintiff’s attorney needed to at least attempt
to call Defense Counsel in order to comply with the meet and confer requirement.  
 
Second, and more importantly, Plaintiff provides no authority for using
a motion to strike to excise entire affirmative defenses from an answer, and the
Court knows of no such authority.  CCP
§430.20(a) authorizes a demurrer to an answer when “the answer does not state
facts sufficient to constitute a defense.” 

 
Because Plaintiff improperly filed a motion to strike instead of a
demurrer, the motion to strike is denied. 

 
3.     Case
Management Conference
The parties are reminded that there
is a CMC on calendar concurrently with the hearing on the above motion to
strike.  The Court asks Counsel to make
arrangements to appear remotely at the CMC and hearing on the motion.
