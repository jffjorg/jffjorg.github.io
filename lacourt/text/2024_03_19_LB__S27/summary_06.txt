And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to compel arbitration filed by Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC. The motion seeks to enforce an arbitration agreement between the dealership from whom Cristina Alexandra Arnao leased an automobile and Arnao herself. The judge has denied the motion, citing the recent decision in Ochoa v. Ford Motor Company, which held that a manufacturer cannot enforce a dealership's arbitration agreement under a third party beneficiary and/or estoppel theory. The judge notes that the motion does not address the Ochoa holding, and therefore the motion must be denied. No future hearing dates are scheduled in this action, and a case management conference is set for a later date.
