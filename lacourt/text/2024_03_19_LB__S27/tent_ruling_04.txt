 Case Number:  23LBCV00076    Hearing Date:   March 19, 2024    Dept:  S27 
Background Facts

Plaintiff, Calvin D. Noe filed
23LBCV00076 against Defendants, U.S. Borax, Inc. and Christina Vink on
1/13/23.  Plaintiff seeks damages for
personal injuries sustained when he was instructed to cut into the wrong pipe
and suffered burn injuries.  
 
On 11/01/23, California Insurance
Company sued the same defendants for indemnification arising out of its payment
of workers’ compensation benefits.  
 
On 1/05/24, Calvin D. Noe filed
24LBCV00028 against Christina Vink.  The
complaint in 24LBCV00028 is substantially the same as the complaint in
23LBCV00076.
 
The three cases were deemed related
on 1/16/24, and on 1/31/24, the Court consolidated the three actions for all
purposes.    
 

Motion to Vacate Dismissal

On 2/21/23, Plaintiff filed a
request for dismissal of the action against Defendant, Vink.  The dismissal was without prejudice.  On 12/05/23, Plaintiff filed an ex parte
application to vacate the dismissal.  The
Court set the matter for hearing, and the hearing was continued multiple times,
ultimately being set for 3/19/24.  
 
On 3/06/24, Defendant filed
opposition to the motion.  The opposition
correctly notes that the motion is moot, as Plaintiff filed 24LBCV00028 on
1/05/24, and the consolidated lawsuit is exactly the same as the dismissed
lawsuit.  
 
Any reply to the opposition was due
on or before 3/12/24.  Plaintiff has not
filed any reply papers, which the Court presumes is a concession that the
motion is moot.  The Court takes the
motion off calendar as moot.  To conserve
party and attorney resources, the Court asks Plaintiff’s attorney to take
matters off calendar promptly in the future in this and other actions whenever
the matters become moot.
