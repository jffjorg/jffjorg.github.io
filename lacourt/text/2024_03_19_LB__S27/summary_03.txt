And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the City's motion for summary adjudication, which seeks to adjudicate two issues: whether the City is vicariously liable for a sexual assault committed by Officer Assef when he was off duty, and whether the City has direct liability for the plaintiff's claimed injuries.

The judge has denied the City's motion for summary adjudication on the issue of vicarious liability, finding that the motion is directed only to one of three acts that form the basis of the complaint, and that vicarious liability is not an issue of "duty" but instead is a theory of liability.

The judge has also denied the City's motion for summary adjudication on the issue of direct liability, finding that the First Amended Complaint does not mention direct liability and that the City's arguments are based on a misreading of the complaint.

The judge has scheduled a hearing on the motion for summary adjudication and has ordered the parties to meet and confer forthwith in an attempt to avoid a hearing. If the parties are unable to resolve their disputes, the judge will likely appoint a discovery referee to hear the motions.

The judge has also set an OSC re: appointment of a discovery referee for April 9, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. in Department S27.
