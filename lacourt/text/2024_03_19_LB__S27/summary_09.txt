And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has sustained the demurrer filed by Sunrise Operations, LLC, which means that Harvey Smith's lawsuit against the company has been dismissed without the option to amend the complaint. The judge has concluded that the doctrine of res judicata bars Harvey Smith's claims, as he previously filed a federal lawsuit seeking the same damages and the case resulted in a final jury verdict. The judge has also found that Harvey Smith's claims in state court are based on the same transactional nucleus of facts as the claims in the prior federal lawsuit. As a result, the judge has denied Harvey Smith's request to pursue his claims in state court.
