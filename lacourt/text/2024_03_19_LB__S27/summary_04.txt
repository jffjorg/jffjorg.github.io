```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has decided that the plaintiff's motion to vacate the dismissal of the action against defendant Christina Vink is moot. The plaintiff had previously dismissed the action without prejudice, but then filed a new complaint with the same allegations against the same defendants. As the new complaint is substantially the same as the original complaint, the motion to vacate the dismissal is unnecessary. The judge has taken the motion off calendar and asks the plaintiff's attorney to take similar matters off calendar promptly in the future when they become moot. The court also reminds the parties that there is a case management conference scheduled concurrently with the hearing on the motion, and asks counsel to make arrangements to appear remotely at the conference and hearing.
