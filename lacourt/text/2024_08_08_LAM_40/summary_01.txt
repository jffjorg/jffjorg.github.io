Significant Statements:

  - "California courts have applied the federal threshold standard to claims of sexual harassment and held that FEHA is violated when the harassment was ‘sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim’s employment.’"
  - "A single incident of harassment may be enough to constitute a hostile work environment if it ‘unreasonably interfered with the plaintiff’s work performance or created an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment.’"
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has tentatively denied the defendant's motion for summary judgment and/or summary adjudication on all seven causes of action brought by the plaintiff, Marcus Webster. The causes of action include discrimination, retaliation, and harassment based on race.

The judge found that there are triable issues of material fact as to elements (2) and (4) of the first cause of action, violation of FEHA - discrimination based on race. The judge also found that there are triable issues of material fact as to elements (2) and (3) of the second cause of action, violation of FEHA - retaliation based on race.

The judge denied the defendant's motion for summary adjudication on the third cause of action, violation of FEHA - harassment based on race, finding that the plaintiff has provided evidence that a trier of fact could reasonably find for harassment in violation of FEHA.

The judge's tentative ruling is subject to change after further consideration and argument by the parties.
