Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has denied Plaintiff Gabriel Rueda's motion for trial preference without prejudice. The motion was filed seeking to maintain the current trial date of November 18, 2024, and to deny any further continuances of trial. The judge ruled that it is premature to grant the motion, as the current trial date has been set by stipulation and order, and no party has actually sought a trial continuance beyond that date. The judge also noted that the case has already been ongoing for eight and a half years and has been subject to multiple continuances. The judge warned the parties that the trial date is firm and that they should not anticipate any additional continuances.
