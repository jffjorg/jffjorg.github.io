MOTIONS
            Plaintiff
Monserrath Arciniega Navarro (“Plaintiff”) moves to compel responses from Defendant
Samuel Sosa (“Defendant”) to Requests for Production, set one (“RPD”).  
ANALYSIS
Plaintiff served
the RPD on Defendant on August 14, 2024 by email.  Defendant’s responses were thus due by September
17, 2024.  Plaintiff filed the instant
motion on October 28, 2024.  To date,
Defendant has not responded to the discovery. 
Accordingly, the motion to compel responses to the RPD is granted pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.300. 
Defendant is ordered to serve verified responses to Plaintiff’s RPD, without
objections, within 30 days of service of this order.
The Court finds Defendant’s failure to
respond to the RPD an abuse of the discovery process and imposes sanctions
against Defendant and his counsel of record, Richard J. Rosiak, jointly and
severally, in the amount of $1,960, which represents four hours of attorney
time to prepare this motion and attend the hearing at $475 per hour and the $60
filing fee.  Defendant and his counsel of
record are to pay $1,960 in sanctions to Plaintiff, by and through counsel,
within 30 days of notice of this order.
Plaintiff is ordered to provide such notice and
to file proof of service of same.
