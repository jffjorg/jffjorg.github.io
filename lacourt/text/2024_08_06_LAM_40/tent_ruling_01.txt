 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
Defendant Chris
  Kato’s Motion to Compel Plaintiff White to Respond to Request for Production
  of Documents and Request for Monetary Sanctions
 



Plaintiff Jake White (“Plaintiff”) sues Defendants Brianna Lynn Massie, Chris Kato, and Prey Films, LLC,
on the grounds that he entered into Agreements with Defendants to produce a
film whereby he would be entitled to a percentage of the proceeds, and that
Defendant Massie intentionally made a false report to the police regarding a
sexual encounter between herself, a female third party, and Plaintiff, resulting
in Plaintiff being charged with a felony, which subsequently led to Defendants
terminating Plaintiff’s position on the basis that the allegations violated the
terms of their agreement. Plaintiff further alleges that at great personal
expense, Plaintiff was able to provide sufficient evidence to the police and
City Attorney’s Office that Defendant Massie’s allegations were false, and
therefore, the City Attorney’s Office declined to prosecute for any violation
originating from Defendant Massie’s allegations. Plaintiff claims that a
warrant was issued for the arrest of Defendant Massie, for a violation of
California Penal Code §148.5 – knowingly filing a false police report. 
The
first amended complaint (“FAC”) alleges causes of action for: (1) malicious
prosecution; (2) defamation; (3) intentional interference in a contractual
relationship; (4) intentional interference in a prospective economic advantage;
(5) intentional infliction of emotional distress; (6) breach of contract; and
(7) breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.
Defendant Kato now brings an unopposed motion to compel
Plaintiff’s responses to request for production of documents and request for
sanctions. The motion was not opposed despite a proof of service attached to
the motion.
 
After review, and for the following reasons, the Court (1) GRANTS
the motion, and (2) GRANTS the request for sanctions in a reduced amount.
 
                        
Motion
to Compel Responses to Request for Production (Set Two)
 
Legal Standard
 
A motion to compel an initial response can be made on the
ground that a party did not serve a timely response to a demand to
produce.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (d); see Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 404.)  To establish this ground, a movant must show: (1)
proper service, (see Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.040); and (2) expiration of the
deadline for the initial response 30 days after service, (see Code Civ. Proc.,
§, 2031.260). 
 
A motion to compel initial responses is not subject to a
45-day time limit, and the propounding party does not have to demonstrate
either good cause or that it satisfied a ‘meet and confer’ requirement. (See
Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.210-2031.320; see also Sinaiko, supra, 148
Cal.App.4th at p. 404.) Neither is a separate statement required when no
discovery response has been received.¿ (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345,
subd. (b).) However, a court must deny a motion to compel initial discovery
where the discovery sought is outside the scope of discovery. (See CBS, Inc.
v. Superior Ct. (1968) 263 Cal.App.2d 12, 19; see also Code. Civ. Proc., §
2017.010 [scope of discovery, “any matter, not privileged, that is relevant to
the subject matter involved in the pending action or to the determination of
any motion made in that action, if the matter either is itself admissible in
evidence or appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of
admissible evidence”].) 
 
Analysis:
 
Defendant Kato presents evidence that on May 12, 2023, he
served a demand for production and inspection of documents and other things
(set two) on Plaintiff. (Bartone Decl., ¶ 4; Exh. A.) The date for
production was June 20, 2023. (Id.) Plaintiff asked for an extension to
respond, which was granted. (Id., ¶ 5; Exh. B.) Defendant gave
Plaintiff’s counsel until June 30, 2023 to respond. (Id., ¶ 6;
Exh. C.) The responses were never sent. (Id., ¶ 8.)
Defense counsel sent Plaintiff’s counsel an email on April 30, 2024 asking for
the documents, but did not receive a response. (Id., ¶¶ 10-11.)
As Defendant properly served the
request for discovery, and Plaintiff has failed to provide responses, the
Court finds Defendant is entitled to a court order directing Plaintiff to
provide verified responses without objections to the discovery request served
on Plaintiff.  Therefore, the motion is granted. Plaintiff is ordered
to provide verified responses without objections within 30 days of this order.
Request for Sanctions: GRANTED
 
Legal Standard: 
 
The Court must impose monetary sanctions against
anyone—party, nonparty, or attorney—who unsuccessfully makes or opposes the
motion, unless it finds that the person to be sanctioned acted withs
substantial justification or other circumstances make the imposition of the
sanctions unjust.  (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (c); see Sinaiko,
supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at pp. 404.)  The court may award sanctions
under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel
discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to
the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving
party after the motion was filed.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1348,
subd. (a).) 
 
Analysis: 
 
Defendant requests $2,000 in sanctions (5.5 hours at $350
per hour, rounded up). 
 
The Court GRANTS the request for sanctions in a reduced
amount due to the simplicity of the motion, pursuant to California Rules of
Court, rule 3.1348 because Plaintiff has completely failed to respond to
Requests for Production (Set Two). As such, the
court imposes sanctions against Plaintiff in the amount of $1,050 ($350 per
hour for 3 hours), to be paid within 30 days of this order.
  
Conclusion 
 
Defendant Kato’s Motion to Compel Responses to Requests for
Production (Set Two) is GRANTED because Defendant has shown (1) proper service
of valid request for production requests, (2) nonresponse of the same, and (3)
proper scope of discovery within these requests. Plaintiff
is ordered to provide verified responses to request for production set two
without objections within 30 days of this order.
 
Defendant Kato’s Request for Sanctions is GRANTED in the
reduced amount of $1,050 pursuant to California Rules of Court, rule 3.1348 for
nonresponse to documents requests. Plaintiff is ordered to pay Defendant Kato’s
counsel $1,050 in sanctions within 30 days of this order.
