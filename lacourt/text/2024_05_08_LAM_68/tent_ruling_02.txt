RULING: Granted.
Defendant Mrs. Gooch’s Natural Foods
Market, Inc. brings a motion to strike the allegations in
support of, and claim for, punitive damages in the first amended complaint, as
pled in the and prayersfor relief. [First Amend. Comp., ¶¶ 38-39, 52-53, 66-67,
79-80, 92-93, 101-102, 114-115, Prayer, ¶ 8.] Defendant challenges the
claim for punitive damages based on a lack of any showing of malicious or
oppressive conduct, in particular, attributable conduct attributable to
corporate policy and ratification. Plaintiff in opposition contends the claim
for punitive damages is supported and sufficiently pled, and the court should
follow a less factual particularity standard when reviewing a motion to strike.
The court electronic filing system shows no reply on file at the time of the
tentative ruling publication cutoff. Defendant in reply reiterates the
arguments regarding the lack of facts supporting punitive damages.
 
Civil Code section 3294, subdivision (c) authorizes punitive
damages upon a showing of malice, oppression, or fraud, which are defined as follows:
 
(1) “Malice” means
conduct which is intended by the defendant to cause injury to the plaintiff or
despicable conduct which is carried on by the defendant with a willful and
conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.
(2) “Oppression”
means despicable conduct that subjects a person to cruel and unjust hardship in
conscious disregard of that person’s rights.
(3) “Fraud” means an
intentional misrepresentation, deceit, or concealment of a material fact known
to the defendant with the intention on the part of the defendant of thereby
depriving a person of property or legal rights or otherwise causing injury.
 
As to a corporate employer, Civil
Code section 3294, subdivision (b) states: 
An employer shall not be liable for damages
pursuant to subdivision (a), based upon acts of an employee of the employer,
unless the employer had advance knowledge of the unfitness of the employee and
employed him or her with a conscious disregard of the rights or safety of
others or authorized or ratified the wrongful conduct for which the damages are
awarded or was personally guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice. With respect
to a corporate employer, the advance knowledge and conscious disregard, authorization,
ratification or act of oppression, fraud, or malice must be on the part of an
officer, director, or managing agent of the corporation.
 
Plaintiff represents
seeking to plead the claim under the malice and oppression standard only. Contrary
to the argument of Plaintiff regarding a less particular factual standard for a
motion to strike punitive damages claims, specific facts must be pled in
support of punitive damages. (Smith v. Superior Court
(1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 1033, 1042; Mock v. Michigan Millers Mutual
Ins. Co. (1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 306, 332
[Clear and convincing evidence leading to a high probability finding of malice
or oppression governs punitive damages recovery]; Grieves v. Superior Court (1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 159, 166, fn. Omitted
[“Not only must there be circumstances of oppression, fraud or malice, but facts must be alleged in the pleading to
support such a claim”]; Hillard v.
A.H. Robins Co. (1983) 148 Cal.App.3d 374, 391.)
 
The operative complaint itself depends on an allegation of articulating
that the existence of the work performance issues, lack of accommodation and
subsequent termination as demonstrative of malicious or oppressive conduct from
the alleged circumstances. (Colucci v. T-Mobile USA, Inc. (2020) 48 Cal.App.5th 442, 455; Monge v. Superior Court
(1986) 176 Cal.App.3d 503, 511.) Plaintiff concludes with allegations of
ratification regarding the lack of accommodation.  (White
v. Ultramar, Inc. (1999) 21 Cal.4th
563, 576–577; Cruz v. HomeBase (2000) 83
Cal.App.4th 160, 168.)
 
While the circumstances can
support a finding of malicious and improper conduct, the court finds the
recitation of conclusions within the operative complaint insufficiently meets
the pleading standard for punitive damages against an employer. The description
of substandard supervision practices insufficiently establishes a direct nexus
to a company policy demonstrating a conscious and intentional disregard for necessary
accommodations and intentional violations of wage and hour standards. 
 
As this is the first review of the
action and only the second consideration of the punitive damages claim, court
policy favors leave to amend. Code Civ. Proc., § 435.5, subd. (e)(1).) The
motion to strike is therefore granted without prejudice/with 20 days leave to
amend. If Plaintiff elects to forego the filing of a second amended complaint,
remaining Defendant to answer the operative complaint within 10 days of the
lapse of the amendment date.
 
Mrs. Gooch’s Natural Foods
Market, Inc. to give notice.
