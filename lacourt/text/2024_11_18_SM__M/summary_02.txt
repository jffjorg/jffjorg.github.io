And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel depositions and production of documents by Creative Artists Agency LLC (CAA) against Range Media Partners LLC and Peter Micelli. CAA is seeking to compel Respondents to comply with discovery requests and attend depositions on ten topics related to the arbitration proceeding. The Judge has denied the motion, finding that CAA has failed to show good cause for the discovery requests and that the requested information is not reasonably calculated to lead to evidence relevant to the outcome of the petition. The Judge has also criticized CAA's argument that discovery is necessary to determine whether arbitration subpoenas are valid or improper, calling it "circular and nonsensical". The case will proceed to a hearing on November 18, 2024.
