And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the plaintiff's motion for leave to file a first amended complaint, as the motion does not comply with the requirements of California Rules of Court rule 3.1324. The plaintiff had previously been granted leave to amend the complaint, but the proposed amended complaint is incomplete and does not include any proposed factual amendments.

The judge grants the defendant's motion for entry of judgment, as the plaintiff failed to amend the complaint within the 30-day deadline after the court's ruling on the defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings. The court finds that the plaintiff's motion for leave to amend was an attempt to relitigate the court's prior ruling granting the defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings, and that the plaintiff's failure to file an amended complaint was excusable mistake.
