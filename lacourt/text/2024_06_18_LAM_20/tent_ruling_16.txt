There is a notice of related cases as to 21STCV41821 and 24TRCV00196.  The inquiry on a notice of related cases is whether the cases at issue (1) involve the same parties and are based on the same or similar claims; (2) arise from the same or substantially identical transactions, incidents, or events requiring the determination of the same or substantially identical questions of law or fact; (3) involve claims against, title to, possession of, or damages to the same property; or (4) are likely for other reasons to require substantial duplication of judicial resources if heard by different judges.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.300(a).)The pleading in 21STCV41821 is 133 pages long.  The pleading in 24TRCV00196 is 94 pages long.  Despite this, no explanation whatsoever has been provided as to why the cases should be related.  Checking off boxes that parrot the language of the CRC is not helpful.  Regardless, the parties for the suits are not identical, and the scope of 24TRCV00196 seems to be broader than that of 21STCV41821.  Thus, the cases won’t be related.
