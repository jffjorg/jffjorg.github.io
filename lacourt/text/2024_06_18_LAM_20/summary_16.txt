The Judge notes that despite the lengthy pleadings (133 pages and 94 pages respectively), no explanation has been provided for why the cases should be related. The Judge also finds that the parties are not identical and the scope of the cases are not similar. Therefore, the Judge concludes that the cases will not require substantial duplication of judicial resources if heard by different judges.
