And here is the summary in English:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to vacate a judgment in a case where the plaintiffs, Adam DeVone, Mario Frank Voce, and Julia Voce, as co-trustees of the Voce Family Trust, alleged abuse by a financial advisor. The Court granted a nonsuit in favor of the defendants, Morgan Stanley & Co., LLC and John R. Privitelli. The defendants filed a proposed judgment, and the plaintiffs filed objections. The Court overruled the objections, but the plaintiffs continued to insist that the judgment should be vacated because the Court prematurely entered judgment without considering the objections. The Court disagrees with the plaintiffs' objections and has denied the motion to vacate the judgment.
