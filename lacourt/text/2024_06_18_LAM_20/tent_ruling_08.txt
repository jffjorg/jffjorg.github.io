This is a lemon law matter.  The parties have settled this matter and have determined that Plaintiffs Francisco Perez and Jorge Perez can obtain fees and costs by motion.  Plaintiffs now seek “$134,798.37. This amount consists of (1) $89,412.50 in attorney fees for Strategic Legal Practices, APC (‘SLP’); (2) a 1.35 multiplier enhancement on the attorney fees (or $31,294.38); (3) $10,591.49 in costs and expenses for SLP; and (4) an additional $3,500.00 for Plaintiffs’ counsel to review Defendant’s Opposition, draft the Reply, and attend the hearing on this Motion . . . .”  The lodestar figure is based on the following: The Court reduces the rate of Baker to $550; Carvalho to $395; Doddy to $450; Sanchez to $450; and Tomas to $550.  This is a total deduction of $2,874.  Further, the Court will make a $17,250 deduction for time spent on a non-compensable fraud claim and for excessive time spent on discovery and a summary judgment hearing.  The Court will also not award $3,500 for any reply.  The Court, in the exercise of its discretion, will make another 5% reduction to the remaining lodestar figure.Furthermore, the Court declines to award any multiplier because, among other reasons, this was not a novel or complex matter.Lastly, the Court will award the requested costs and expenses in the amount of $10,591.49.In sum, the Motion is granted in part—the Court awards $65,824 in fees and $10,591.49 in costs.Moving parties to give notice.If counsel do not submit on the tentative, they are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
