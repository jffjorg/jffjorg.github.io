And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has tentatively ruled on two separate motions. In the first motion, the plaintiff, Zeki Group, LLC, sought a protective order to prevent the deposition of Jeremy Todd, citing a lack of notice and an unusual deposition time. The defendants argued that the plaintiff failed to meet and confer. The judge denied the motion, finding that the initial deposition was canceled and the defendants were willing to meet and confer. The judge also declined to award sanctions.

In the second motion, the defendants sought to compel the deposition of Stephen Brown, the principal of the plaintiff. The plaintiff did not file an opposition to the motion, and the judge granted the motion. The deposition is to take place within 30 days, and the judge awarded reduced sanctions in the amount of $1,000.
