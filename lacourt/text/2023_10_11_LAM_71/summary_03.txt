And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge denies the plaintiff's request for default judgment and instead sets a hearing to determine why the complaint should not be dismissed and/or the plaintiff's counsel should be sanctioned for failing to enter the default judgment. The hearing is scheduled for October 11, 2023, at 8:30 AM in Department 71 at the Stanley Mosk Courthouse. The reason for the denial is that the plaintiff's request for attorneys' fees is not calculated according to Local Rule 3.2. The court orders the plaintiff's counsel to pay a sanction of $250 for the failure to enter default judgment.
