 Case Number:  YC070538    Hearing Date:   May 2, 2024    Dept:  8 May 2,
2024 Tentative Ruling
Fred
Tucker v PNC Bank, Case No. YC070538
            Before
the Court on the May 2, 2024 calendar is Plaintiff’s ex parte application for a
Temporary Restraining Order, seeking a 90-day injunction to stop a looming non-judicial
foreclosure of the real property at 1232 Via Landata, Palos Verdes Estates, and
to seek to hold PNC Bank’s lawyer in civil contempt.    This
is at least the 3rd time Mr. Tucker has raised essentially the same
issue before this Court.  The Court will
explain in even more detail than it did in March of 2023 and in February of
2024 why this repeated mis-interpretation of prior rulings of the Court is
erroneous.
On December 9, 2022, the Court
stayed further judicial proceedings at the trial level of this case pending
Plaintiff’s appeal of the Court’s granting of a defense motion for summary
judgment.  The Court did NOT stay other
activities by PNC Bank such as a non-judicial foreclosure.  The Court did NOT order PNC Bank to be
precluded from including any amounts such as its litigation expenses in a
payoff quote or payoff demand statement that Mr. Tucker might request under
Civil Code section 2943(a)(5).  
The Court’s tentative ruling is to
DENY the requested TRO for the following reasons:
1.       As
indicated in its March 2, 2023 tentative ruling on one of Mr. Tucker’s earlier
attempts to preclude a non-judicial foreclosure of the subject property, the
Court’s December 9, 2022 Order applied only to further judicial
proceedings, not non-judicial proceedings;
2.       As
also indicated its March 2, 2023 tentative ruling, the exercise of a power of
sale in a deed of trust through non-judicial foreclosure is not a judicial
proceeding, and was neither discussed at the hearing on nor encompassed within
the Court’s December 9 Stay Order; 
3.       A
foreclosure lawsuit is distinct from a non-judicial foreclosure proceeding, and
it appears to the Court that in the latter a lender is entitled to “convert
amounts spent on attorneys’ fees into additional debt secured by the mortgage.”  (Hart v. Clear Recon Corp. (2018) 27
Cal.App.5th 322, 327, quoting Valencia v. Carrington Mortg. Servs., LLC
(D. Haw. June 25, 2013, No. 10-00558 LEK-RLP) 2013 WL 3223628, 2013 U.S. Dist.
LEXIS 88886.)  Hart indicated that
the provision in the mortgage document there specified “that attorney's fees,
like any other expenses the lender may incur to protect its interest, will be
added to the secured debt.”  (Hart,
supra, 27 Cal.App.5th at p. 327.)
4.       A
beneficiary statement, i.e., a written statement showing the amount of the
unpaid balance of the obligation secured by a deed of trust or mortgage, is
permitted to include the “amount of any additional charges, costs, or expenses
paid or incurred by the beneficiary which have become a lien on the real
property involved.”  (Civil Code § 2943(a)(2)(G).)  
5.       Mr.
Tucker has an adequate remedy at law here, which is to pay the full amount of
the payoff quote including the attorney’s fees, redeem the property from
non-judicial foreclosure, and sue for the claimed excess amount paid.  (5 Miller & Starr (4th
ed.2023) Cal. Real Estate, § 13:241.)  
6.       Plaintiff
has not carried his burden of proving a substantial likelihood of success on
the merits, a prerequisite for issuance of a TRO.  See Code of Civil Procedure §526(a)(1) and (2).  
7.       Defense
counsel Libby Wong has not violated the Court’s previous order because the Court
did not enter any order affecting PNC Bank’s ability to respond to a request
for a payoff quote.
