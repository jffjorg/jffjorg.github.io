And here is the summary in English text:

The Court's tentative ruling is to deny the plaintiff's ex parte application for a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) to stop a looming non-judicial foreclosure of the real property at 1232 Via Landata, Palos Verdes Estates. The Court's reasoning is based on the following points: (1) the Court's December 9, 2022 Order only stayed judicial proceedings, not non-judicial proceedings; (2) the exercise of a power of sale in a deed of trust through non-judicial foreclosure is not a judicial proceeding; (3) the lender is entitled to convert attorney's fees into additional debt; (4) a beneficiary statement is permitted to include additional charges, costs, or expenses; (5) the plaintiff has an adequate remedy at law; and (6) the plaintiff has not carried his burden of proving a substantial likelihood of success on the merits. The Court further notes that the defendant's lawyer has not violated the Court's previous order.
