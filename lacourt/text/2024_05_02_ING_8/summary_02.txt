And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court's tentative ruling is to ARGUE and/or CONTINUE the hearing on the Motion to Compel Arbitration. The Court finds that defendant has established a valid arbitration agreement between the parties, and that plaintiff's claims are bound by the arbitration agreement. However, the Court also finds that plaintiff has raised a valid defense to the motion, citing her inability to pay the arbitrator's fees. The Court is concerned that if the Roldon precedent were followed in all arbitration cases, every plaintiff opposing a motion to compel arbitration could be entitled to an ability to pay hearing and ability to pay discovery, consuming considerable time and expense on both sides. The Court invites comment by both counsel as to whether the Court should decide the issue of plaintiff's ability to pay arbitration fees and direct the parties to file supplemental briefing on the Roldon and Aronow issues.
