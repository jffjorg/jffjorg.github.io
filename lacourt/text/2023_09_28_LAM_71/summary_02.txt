Summary in English text:

The Court has reconsidered its prior order granting Defendant's motion to compel arbitration, and has denied the motion. The Court found that Defendant has not met its burden to establish a valid arbitration agreement, and that the RISC (Retail Installment Sales Contract) between Plaintiff and Hammer Toyota does not grant Defendant the power to compel arbitration. The Court also found that Defendant has not established that it can enforce the RISC as a third-party beneficiary. The Court's decision is based on various case law, including Felisilda v. FCA US LLC, Montemayor v. Ford Motor Company, Ford Motor Warranty Cases, and Keilar v. Superior Court of Placer County.

## Tentative Ruling Summary: 

**Case Number:** 22STCV05366
**Plaintiff:** Omar Hernandez Santiago 
**Defendant:** Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc.

**Summary:**

Judge, sua sponte, reconsiders and overturns a prior ruling that compelled arbitration in this case. Plaintiff, Omar Hernandez Santiago, sued Toyota for breach of warranty under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act. The Court finds that Toyota, as a manufacturer not a party to the sales contract, cannot compel arbitration based on the contract between Plaintiff and the dealership.

**Key Points:**

* **Procedural Background:**
    * Plaintiff filed a breach of warranty lawsuit against Toyota.
    * The court initially granted Toyota's motion to compel arbitration.
    * Plaintiff filed a motion for reconsideration.
    * The court reconsiders the motion based on new case law. 

* **Legal Arguments:**
    * **Plaintiff's Argument:** Toyota is not a party to the sales contract and can't compel arbitration.
    * **Defendant's Argument:**  Points to contract language allowing arbitration of claims with "third parties" to support their argument. 
* **Court's Reasoning:**
    * Recent case law (Kielar, Montemayor, Ford Motor Warranty Cases) rejects the argument that a manufacturer can compel arbitration based on contracts with the dealer.
    * The contract language cited by Toyota doesn't demonstrate intent to benefit Toyota as a third-party beneficiary. 
    * The contract's purpose was to finance the vehicle, not to benefit Toyota.

* **Ruling:**
    * The court denies Toyota's motion to compel arbitration.


**Significant Statements:**
*  "Defendant has not met its initial burden."
* "The Court, sua sponte, vacates its January 4, 2023, ruling that granted Defendant’s motion to compel arbitration and issues this order, denying Defendant’s motion to compel arbitration."
*  "Defendant’s reliance on the RISC provision that identifies the scope of arbitrable matters including claims arising from any resulting relationship with third parties is misplaced."

```

And here is a brief summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The Court, sua sponte, reconsidered its previous ruling granting Defendant Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc.'s motion to compel arbitration. The Court found that Defendant did not meet its initial burden to establish a valid arbitration agreement between the parties. The Court vacated its previous ruling and denied Defendant's motion to compel arbitration. The Court relied on recent case authority, including Keilar v. Superior Court of Placer County, Montemayor v. Ford Motor Company, and Ford Motor Warranty Cases, which held that a manufacturer's warranty obligations are not part of the retail sales contract and that a non-signatory manufacturer cannot compel arbitration of a breach of warranty claim.
