Summary in English text:

The Court has reconsidered its prior order granting Defendant's motion to compel arbitration, and has denied the motion. The Court found that Defendant has not met its burden to establish a valid arbitration agreement, and that the RISC (Retail Installment Sales Contract) between Plaintiff and Hammer Toyota does not grant Defendant the power to compel arbitration. The Court also found that Defendant has not established that it can enforce the RISC as a third-party beneficiary. The Court's decision is based on various case law, including Felisilda v. FCA US LLC, Montemayor v. Ford Motor Company, Ford Motor Warranty Cases, and Keilar v. Superior Court of Placer County.
