         vs.
 
TOYOTA MOTOR
  SALES U.S.A., INC. 


 Case No.: 
  22STCV05366
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  September 28, 2023



 
The
Court, sua sponte, reconsiders its January 4, 2023, Ruling granting
Defendant Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc.’s motion to compel arbitration:  Defendant Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A.’s motion
to compel arbitration is denied.
 
The Court, sua sponte, reconsiders its January 4,
2023, order (“1/4/23 Ruling”) granting Defendant Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A.,
Inc.’s (“Toyota”) (“Defendant”) motion to compel arbitration.  (Notice of Motion, pg. 2.)  
 
Procedural Background
On February 14, 202, Plaintiff Omar Hernandez Santiago
(“Santiago”) (“Plaintiff”) filed his operative complaint against Defendant
alleging three causes of action under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act,
Civil Code §§1790 et seq. (“Song-Beverly”): (1) violation of
Song-Beverly- breach of express warranty; (2) violation of Song-Beverly- breach
of implied warranty; and (3) violation of Song-Beverly §1793.2, arising from
Plaintiff’s purchase of a 2020 Toyota Corolla (“Subject Vehicle”).
          On January
4, 2023, this Court granted Defendant’s motion to compel arbitration of
Plaintiff’s claims.  (1/4/23 Ruling.)
Plaintiff filed his motion for reconsideration on April 14,
2023.  Defendant filed its opposition on
August 8, 2023.  Plaintiff filed his
reply on August 14, 2023.  
          On August
21, 2023, this Court, sua sponte, set a hearing to reconsider
Defendant’s motion to compel arbitration, continuing the August 21, 2023,
hearing on Plaintiff’s motion for reconsideration.  Parties submitted simultaneous briefs on
September 15, 2023, addressing the holdings in Kielar v. Superior Court of Placer County (Cal. Ct. App., Aug. 16, 2023, No. C096773)
2023 WL 5270559; Montemayor v. Ford Motor Company (2023) 92
Cal.App.5th 958, review filed (Aug. 1, 2023); and Ford
Motor Warranty Cases (2023) 89 Cal.App.5th 1324, review
granted (July 19, 2023).
 
Motion for Reconsideration      
A
statutory motion for reconsideration requires that the motion be made 10 days
from the date the order at issue is served.  (C.C.P. §1008.)  However, the Court has discretion to
reconsider an order on its own motion pursuant to its “constitutionally derived
authority.”  (Le Francois v. Goel (2005)
35 Cal.4th 1094, 1096.)  Section 1008
limits the parties’ ability to file repetitive motions to reconsider but does
not limit the court’s ability to reconsider its prior interim orders to correct
its own errors.  (Id. at pg.
1109.)
As the
Court is not constrained by the limitations or the requirements of C.C.P. §1008
and based on its inherent authority, the Court reconsiders its order compelling
this matter to arbitration. (Id. at pg. 1095.)
 
Motion to Compel Arbitration
The
distinguishing facts and procedural posture in Felisilda v. FCA US LLC (2020) 53
Cal.App.5th 486, coupled with recent
and persuasive case authority warrants revocation of the Court’s prior order.
At the
time Defendant made its motion to compel arbitration, Defendant relied on Felisilda
as it was the only case from a California appellate court to decide, based on
the principles of equitable estoppel and third-party beneficiary that a vehicle
manufacturer could force the plaintiff to arbitrate although the manufacturer
was not a party to the retail sales contract between Plaintiff and the dealer.  (Felisilda v. FCA US LLC (2020) 53 Cal.App.5th 486, 495.)  However, Division Eight of the Second District
Court of Appeal declined to follow Felisilda and disagreed with its
conclusion that the manufacturer had the power to elect arbitration although
not a signatory since the sales contract was not the source of the manufacturer
warranties at issue in the case, Plaintiff did not agree to arbitrate claims
with the manufacturer, and the sales contract “could not be construed to bind
the purchaser to arbitrate with the universe of unnamed third parties.”  (Ford Motor Warranty Cases
(2023) 89 Cal.App.5th 1324, 1335.)
Felisilda is distinguishable in that the dealer, who was a
party to the sales contract, moved to compel arbitration of all claims
including those against the manufacturer, who did not oppose the motion. The
trial court found it was the court’s prerogative to send the entire matter to
arbitration at the dealer’s request. (Felisilda, 53 Cal.App.5th at pg. 498.)  Here, Plaintiff did not sue the dealer, the
dealer is not a party to the action, and Toyota alone is moving to compel.  
More
recently in Montemayor v. Ford Motor Company (Cal. Ct. App., June
26, 2023, No. B320477) 2023 WL 4181909,
Division Seven of the Second Appellate District affirmed the trial court’s
order denying Defendant’s motion to compel arbitration as Ford was not a party
to the sales contract and could not enforce the arbitration provision under the
principles of equitable estoppel or as a third-party beneficiary of the
contract.  (Montemayor, 2023 WL 4181909, at *1-2.) 
Additionally,
on August 16, 2023, California’s Third Court of Appeal’s decision in Keilar
v. The Superior Court of Placer County (2023) 94 Cal.App.5th 614, issued a
holding further bolstering support for the prevailing authority finding that
contracts between a Plaintiff and non-signatory selling dealer cannot be relied
upon by a vehicle manufacturer to compel arbitration in a breach of warranty
case. The Keilar Court underscored that “[t]he doctrine of equitable
estoppel is the exception to “‘the general rule that a nonsignatory cannot be
compelled to arbitrate and cannot invoke an agreement to arbitrate, without
being a party to that arbitration agreement.”  (Keilar, 94
Cal.App.5th at pg. 430, quoting JSM Tuscany, LLC v. Superior Court (2011)
193 Cal.App.4th 1222, 1236-1237.)  The Keilar
Court further stated that even referencing an agreement within an
arbitration clause is not enough to grant a non-signatory Defendant standing to
compel arbitration, as the plaintiff’s actual dependance on the underlying
contract in making out the claim against the non-signatory is “always the sine
qua non of an appropriate situation for applying equitable estoppel.” (Id.,
citations omitted.)
Where
appellate decisions are in conflict, the Court exercising inferior jurisdiction
can and must make a choice between the conflicting decisions. (Auto Equity
Sales, Inc. v. Superior Court of Santa Clara County (1962) 57 Cal.2d 450,
456.)  The Court considers the analyses
in Ford Motor Warranty Cases, Montemayor, and Keilar
more persuasive as it addresses the issues more succinctly and within the same
context. 
The Retail
Installment Sales Contract (“RISC”) at issue is made between Plaintiff and Hammer
Toyota.  (Decl. of Yao ¶2, Exh. A.)  Defendant is not a party to the RISC.  (See Decl.
of Yao ¶2, Exh. A.)  The RISC defines
“we” or “us” as the “Seller-Creditor.” (Decl. of Yao ¶2, Exh. A at pg. 1.)  Here, Toyota alone moved to compel
arbitration; Plaintiff did not sue the dealership. This is a critical
difference as Ford Motor Warranty Cases recognized
the distinction between who had the power to elect arbitration (“You” and “Us”)
as opposed to the scope or subject matter of arbitrable issues (disputes
with third parties including non-signatories). (Ford Motor Warranty Cases,
89 Cal.App.5th at pg. 1339 [“Who may enforce an
arbitration agreement is a separate matter from the types of disputes the
agreement covers.”].)  Defendant improperly
conflates both issues.
The
contract in Felisilda states:
Any claim or
dispute, whether in contract, tort, statute or otherwise . . . between you and
us . . . which arises out of or relates to . . . [the] condition
of this vehicle, this contract or any resulting transaction or relationship
(including any such relation with third parties who do not sign this contract)
shall, at your or our election, be resolved by neutral, binding arbitration and
not by a court action. 
 
(Felisilda, 53 Cal.App.5th at pg. 490.) 
The
contract at issue here is substantially similar: 
Any claim or
dispute, whether in contract, tort, statute or otherwise, . . . between you and us or our
employees, agents, successors or assigns, which arises out of or relates to
your credit application, purchase or condition of this vehicle, this contract
or any resulting transaction or relationship (including any such relationship
with third parties who do not sign this contract) shall, at your or our
election, be resolved by neutral, binding arbitration and not by a court
action. 
 
(Decl. of Yao ¶2, Exh. A at pg. 7, ¶4.)
Based
on the contract’s express provisions, Toyota does not have the power alone to elect arbitration of issues covered by the manufacturer’s warranty based on
the provision’s scope that included “resulting relationships with third
parties.” (Decl. of Yao ¶2, Exh. A at pg. 7, ¶4.)
Therefore,
Plaintiff’s claims are founded on the manufacturer’s warranty contract, not the
RISC with Hamer Toyota, precluding application of equitable estoppel.  Under California law, the general rule is
that “only a party to an arbitration agreement is bound by or may enforce
the agreement.  (C.C.P. §1281.2.)  However, one exception is the principle of
equitable estoppel which applies “when the causes of action against the
nonsignatory are ‘intimately founded in and intertwined’ with the underlying
contract obligations . . ..” (Boucher v. Alliance Title Co.,
Inc. (2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 262, 272.)  Under those circumstances, where a plaintiff
“relies on contract terms in a claim against a non-signatory defendant, even if
not exclusively, a plaintiff may be equitably estopped from repudiating the
arbitration clause contained in that agreement.”  (Id.) 
          In applying equitable estoppel, the
Court examines Plaintiff’s claims to determine if they are “intertwined” with
the Plaintiff’s obligations imposed by the RISC.  (Goldman v. KPMG, LLP (2009) 173
Cal.App.4th 209, 218.)  Defendant
contends that Plaintiff’s claims are based on the purchase and condition of the
vehicle which is an arbitrable claim as described in the sales contract.  Defendant concludes that Plaintiff is
equitably estopped from repudiating the arbitration provision, which is part of
the same contract. 
          The RISC obligated Plaintiff to pay Hamer
Toyota for the purchase price of the vehicle according to the stated terms and
conditions.  The complaint does not
assert any claim founded upon Plaintiff’s payment obligations to Hamer Toyota.
Rather, Plaintiff’s claims are based on Defendant’s statutory obligations to
reimburse consumers or replace the vehicles when unable to repair in accordance
with its warranty.  (Complaint ¶¶22-27.)
          Ford Motor Warranty Cases
observed that warranties from a non-party manufacturer are not part of the
sales contract.  (Ford Motor Warranty
Cases, 89
Cal.App.5th at pg. 621, citing Corporation
of Presiding Bishop of Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints v. Cavanaugh (1963)
217 Cal.App.2d 492, 514, and Greenman v. Yuba Power Products, Inc. (1963)
59 Cal.2d 57.)  Here, Hamer Toyota
expressly disclaimed any warranties, express or implied on the vehicle
including for warranties of merchantability or of fitness. (Decl. of Yao ¶2,
Exh. A at pg. 5, ¶4.)  The Montemayor
court adopted the same reasoning as Ford Motor Warranty Cases.  (Montemayor, 2023 WL 4181909, at *5.)
          Defendant argues that Ford Motor
Warranty Cases relied on 60-year-old cases which involved transactions and
warranties that preceded enactment of the Uniform Commercial Code and the Song-Beverly
Act and are “out of context.” (Toyota Supp. Brief, pg. 4.)  Ford Motor Warranty Cases rejected the
same argument and observed that Ford, like Toyota, did not cite more recent
authority to establish that a manufacturer’s warranty obligations are implied
terms of the sales contract.  (Ford
Motor Warranty Cases, 89 Cal.App.5th at pg. 1336.)  While warranty claims are treated like
contract claims under the UCC, “it does not ‘naturally follow’ from any
contractual character of manufacturer warranty claims that they inhere in a
retail sale contract containing no warranty terms.”  (Id.) 
          Defendant’s reliance on Hauter v.
Zogarts (1975) 14 Cal.3d 104, is misplaced. The Hauter Court determined that a statement of fact or
opinion that a golf ball made by the manufacturer was safe and would not hit
the player can constitute a warranty.  However,
“the bone of contention is whether they can escape liability by impliedly
limiting the Scope of their promise” which is not at issue here.  (Hauter, 14
Cal.3d at pg. 115.)  Defendant’s case authority is out of context. 
Defendant
has also not established that it can enforce the contract as a third-party
beneficiary.  A contract made expressly
for the benefit of a third person, “may be enforced by him at any time before
the parties thereto rescind it.”  (Civ.
Code §1559).  Persons who are “only
incidentally or remotely benefited by it” are excluded.  (Lake Almanor Associates L.P. v.
Huffman-Broadway Group, Inc. (2009) 178 Cal.App.4th 1194, 1199.)  To establish that it is an intended,
third-party beneficiary of the contract, Defendant must show “(1) whether the
third party would in fact benefit from the contract, but also (2) whether a
motivating purpose of the contracting parties was to provide a benefit to the
third party, (“and not simply acknowledge that a benefit to the third party may
follow from the contract”), and (3) whether permitting a third party to bring
its own breach of contract action against a contracting party is consistent
with the objectives of the contract and the reasonable expectations of the
contracting parties. All three elements must be satisfied to permit the
third-party action to go forward.” (Goonewardene v. ADP, LLC (2019)
6 Cal.5th 817, 830.)
          Defendant’s motion relied on the RISC
provision that identifies the scope of arbitrable matters including
claims arising from any resulting relationship with third parties.  (Motion Compel Arb, pgs. 8-9.)  However, the mere mention of third parties in
the provision governing scope does not establish that the RISC’s motivating
purpose or intent was to benefit Defendant.  ­(Ford Motor Warranty Cases, 89 Cal.App.5th at pg. 621.)
 The “motivating purpose” of the RISC was
to finance the vehicle with the dealer; it was not made expressly for the
benefit of a third person.” (Montemayor, 2023 WL 4181909, at *10; Decl.
of Yao ¶2, Exh. A at pg. 1 [“By signing this contract, you choose to buy the
vehicle on credit under the agreements on all pages of this contract” in the
financed amount according to the schedule identified in the agreement.])  Therefore, Toyota has not established that it
can invoke the arbitration provision as a third-party beneficiary.
 
Conclusion
          A
moving party’s burden is to establish that a valid arbitration agreement exists
between the parties.  (Molecular
Analytical Systems v. Ciphergen Biosystems, Inc. (2010) 186
Cal.App.4th 696, 705.)  Defendant has not
met its initial burden. Accordingly, the Court, sua sponte,
vacates its January 4, 2023, ruling that granted Defendant’s motion to compel
arbitration and issues this order, denying Defendant’s motion to compel
arbitration.
Defendant to give
notice.
