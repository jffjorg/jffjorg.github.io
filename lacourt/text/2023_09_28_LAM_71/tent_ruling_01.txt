AARON MEZIERE,  
 
  
         vs.
 
MARCUS CLARK.


 Case No.: 
  20STCV41931
 
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  September 28, 2023



 
The Court sets a hearing on an order to show cause why the
complaint should not be dismissed and/or Plaintiff’s counsel sanctioned $250
for failing to enter default judgment (California Rule of Court, rule 3.110(h))
on October 31, 2023, at 8:30 AM in Department 71 at Stanley Mosk Courthouse for
the following reasons: 
1.     No request for Court Judgment on CIV-100
submitted to the Court. No declaration of nonmilitary status.
a.     
Plaintiff
attaches cost memorandum, but it is an incorrect form. The CIV-100 with the
request for court judgment includes a cost memorandum on the second page of the
document.
 
2.     Plaintiff
seeks punitive damages but does not demonstrate he personally served the
requisite statement of damages or notice of punitive damages. (C.C.P.
§425.11(c) and 425.115.) 
 
3.     Prayer
for relief does not specify amount demanded, and JUD-100 damages are in excess
of any amount.  (See, e.g., Falahati v. Kondo (2005) 127 Cal.App.4th
823, 830-831 [finding court acts in excess of its jurisdiction and the
resulting default judgment is void if the court awards default judgment in an
amount greater than that demanded in the complaint, including if the complaint
does not specify the amount demanded].)
