**English Summary:**

The judge has scheduled a hearing to determine whether the complaint should be dismissed and if Plaintiff's counsel should be sanctioned $250. The judge states this is due to several failures by the Plaintiff, including:

* Failing to submit the proper forms (CIV-100 with request for court judgment and declaration of non-military status).
* Incorrectly filing a cost memorandum.
* Seeking punitive damages without properly serving the required statements.
* Not specifying the amount demanded in the prayer for relief, while the JUD-100 damages exceed any specified amount.


The judge cites relevant case law and statutes to support the potential dismissal and sanction.

* The plaintiff's counsel failed to submit a request for Court Judgment on CIV-100 and did not provide a declaration of nonmilitary status.

* The prayer for relief does not specify the amount demanded, and the JUD-100 damages are in excess of any amount, which may be a jurisdictional issue.

The judge is requiring the plaintiff to demonstrate why the complaint should not be dismissed and why the plaintiff's counsel should not be sanctioned for failing to follow court rules.
