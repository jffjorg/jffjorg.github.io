And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Tranzito-Vector, LLC (Real Party) to the first and second causes of action in the second amended petition for writ of mandate filed by Coalition for a Scenic Los Angeles (Petitioner). The Real Party argues that the Petitioner's claims are barred by the statute of limitations under CEQA.

The judge has concluded that the City Council's approval of the Project and MND on September 20, 2022 was not a final approval, as it was subject to the approval of the Mayor. Therefore, the Petitioner's claims are not time-barred. The demurrer is overruled, and the Real Party is ordered to file an answer.

The judge has also noted that the City Council's decision to condition its approval on the mayor's approval is not a sham, and that the Petitioner has consistently alleged that the City's approval of the project on September 20, 2022 was not a final approval for purposes of CEQA.
