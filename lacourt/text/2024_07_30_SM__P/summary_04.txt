Summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Nitoiu et al. v. West Properties, Case No. 24SMCV00356. The case involves a habitability action brought by Gabriela Nitoiu and her minor son, Cameron Nitoiu, against West Properties, alleging that the defendant failed to maintain their unit, causing them to fall ill from exposure to toxic substances from mold and animal waste.

The judge has overruled West Properties' demurrer to the complaint, finding that the claims for breach of implied warranty of habitability, private nuisance, and intentional infliction of emotional distress are not barred by issue preclusion. The judge has also denied West Properties' motion to strike punitive damages allegations, finding that the plaintiffs have alleged sufficient facts to support a claim for punitive damages.

The judge has ordered West Properties to answer the complaint within 15 days.
