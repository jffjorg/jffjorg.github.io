And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge regarding a future court hearing in a case between plaintiff Steiger and several defendants, including the Nine Eighteen Twenty-First Street Homeowners Association. Steiger alleges that the defendants improperly restricted his ability to renovate his condominium unit by adding hardwood floors and a washer/dryer. Steiger seeks summary adjudication on three issues of duty, including the HOA's duty to provide a fair, reasonable, and expeditious procedure for the installation of hardwood floors and a washer/dryer, the HOA's duty to decide on Steiger's request in good faith and in a manner that is not unreasonable, arbitrary, or capricious, and the HOA's duty to exercise due care in processing Steiger's request.

The court granted summary adjudication on the first two issues of duty owed by the HOA under the Davis-Stirling Act, finding that the HOA owed a duty to provide a fair, reasonable, and expeditious procedure and to decide in good faith. However, the court denied summary adjudication on the issue of the HOA's duty to exercise due care in processing requests or applications, finding that this issue remains triable.
