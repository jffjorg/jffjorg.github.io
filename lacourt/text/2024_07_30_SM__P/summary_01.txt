And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion for reconsideration filed by Howarth, who is disputing the court's decision on a summary judgment/adjudication motion. Howarth claims that Mardirossian installed a fence on his property, built a tennis court without a Coastal Development Permit, and failed to construct a noise-mitigating masonry wall. The judge has previously granted Mardirossian's summary judgment/adjudication motion in part.

Howarth is seeking to have the court reconsider its decision, but the judge finds that Howarth has not presented new facts, circumstances, or law to support his motion. The judge also finds that Howarth has failed to provide a satisfactory explanation for not presenting this evidence earlier.

Accordingly, the judge denies Howarth's motion for reconsideration. The judge notes that the legislative intent behind the motion for reconsideration statute is to restrict such motions to circumstances where a party offers the court some fact or circumstance not previously considered and some valid reason for not offering it earlier.
