Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The City of Beverly Hills has moved for attorney's fees on the grounds that it is the prevailing party in this case. The City argues that the plaintiff, Askari, voluntarily dismissed his complaint without prejudice on May 9, 2024, after the court had issued a tentative ruling granting the City's anti-SLAPP motion and sustaining the demurrer. The City claims that this dismissal was intended to avoid an adverse ruling and therefore entitles it to attorney's fees.

The plaintiff argues that the dismissal was not intended to avoid liability and was unrelated to the City's anti-SLAPP motion. However, the court finds that the timing of the dismissal, just hours before the hearing on the anti-SLAPP motion, suggests that the plaintiff was attempting to avoid an adverse ruling.

The court concludes that the City is the prevailing party and is entitled to attorney's fees. The court awards the City $18,196.40 in attorney fees and costs, which is a reduced amount from the City's initial request of $21,125.90. The court reduces the award by 2 hours billed to preparing an ex parte and 5 hours for duplicative billing.
