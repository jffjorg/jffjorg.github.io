Nitoiu,
et al. v. West Properties, Case No. 24SMCV00356 
Hearing
Date: July 30, 2024
Defendant
West Property’s Demurrer to Complaint and Motion to Strike Punitive Damages
 
Plaintiff Gabriela
Nitoiu and minor plaintiff Cameron Nitoiu bring a habitability action alleging defendant
West Properties failed to maintain their unit, causing them to fall ill from
exposure to toxic substances from mold and animal waste in their unit. Defendant
West Properties demurs the third, fourth, and sixth causes of action, citing
res judicata, duplicative pleadings and failure to state a cause of action, and
moves to strike punitive damages allegations. 
 
Evidentiary
Rulings 
West Properties’
request for judicial notice of (1) the unlawful detainer complaint filed by CS Holdings
against Gabriela Nitoiu on August 25, 2023, Case No. 23STUD11240.; (2) Answer,
filed September 8, 2023; (3) Minute Order of February 22, 2024; and (4) judgment
entered February 22, 2024, exhs. A-D, GRANTED per Evid. Code § 452(d) as court
records. 
 
Demurrer 
Breach of Implied
Warranty of Habitability 
West Properties argues
the cause of action for breach of implied warranty of habitability is barred by
issue preclusion because Nitoiu asserted a habitability defense in the unlawful
detainer action, so she is precluded from raising it here. Exhs. A-D. 
 
Plaintiffs argue
the issue was not fully heard on its merits. “The doctrine of res judicata
gives certain conclusive effect to a former judgment in subsequent litigation
involving the same controversy.” Boeken
v. Philip Morris USA, Inc. (2010) 48 Cal.4th 788, 797, internal quotations
and citations omitted. There are two aspects of res judicata, claim preclusion
and issue preclusion. Alpha Mechanical,
Heating & Air Conditioning, Inc. v. Travelers Casualty & Surety Co. of
America (2005) 133 Cal.App.4th 1319, 1326.
 
Issue preclusion
bars relitigating issues argued and decided in the previous action. DKN Holdings, LLC v. Faerber (2015) 61
Cal.4th 813, 824. The elements of issue preclusion are “(1) after final
adjudication (2) of an identical issue (3) actually litigated and necessarily
decided in the first suit and (4) asserted against one who was a party in the
first suit or one in privity with that party.” Id. at p. 825. 
 
The court takes
judicial notice of the judgment and minute order in the unlawful detainer
action. Exh. C & D. “Because a demurrer challenges defects on the face of
the complaint, it can only refer to matters outside the pleading that are
subject to judicial notice.” Arce ex rel. Arce v. Kaiser Found. Health Plan,
Inc. (2010) 181 Cal.App.4th 471, 556. Based on these documents, it is not clear
there was an adjudication on the merits of the habitability affirmative defense.
Neither document mentions this issue. There are no factual findings in the
minute order or judgment. West Properties failed to provide evidence
demonstrating the defense was fully and fairly heard on its merits, so the
claim is not barred by issue preclusion. OVERRULED. 
Private Nuisance
West Properties
argues that the fourth cause of action for private nuisance is redundant as it
duplicates the first cause of action for negligence. 
 
A demurrer may be
sustained on the basis the causes of action are duplicative by way of alleged
facts and theories of recovery. See Palm Springs Villas II Homeowners Assn.,
Inc. v. Parth (2016) 248 Cal.App.4th 268, 290; Rodrigues v. Campbell
Industries (1978) 87 Cal.App.3d 494, 501; Award Metals, Inc. v. Superior
Court (1991) 228 Cal.App.3d 1128, 1135.
 
The complaint
alleges the apartment manager kept her dog in the unit for eight months, during
which time the dog urinated and defecated in the unit, and the waste was not properly
cleaned. Id. ¶¶ 16-18. As a result, the waste containing bacteria,
ammonia and parasites seeped into the carpets and beneath the wood flooring. Id.
¶ 19. Plaintiffs alleged defendants’ conduct was reckless and harmful to
plaintiffs’ health, indecent, offensive to the senses, and interfered with
property use and enjoyment. Id. ¶¶ 100-104. 
 
This cause of
action is distinguishable from the negligence cause of action because
plaintiffs alternatively allege the “action or failure to take action which
created these conditions was intentional and unreasonable.” Id. ¶ 101.
OVERRULED.
 
Intentional
Infliction of Emotional Distress (IIED)
 
Finally, West Properties argues the sixth cause of
action for IIED fails because it does not plead sufficient facts. “The elements
of a prima facie case for the tort of intentional infliction of emotional
distress are: (1) extreme and outrageous conduct by the defendant with the
intention of causing, or reckless disregard of the probability of causing,
emotional distress; (2) the plaintiff’s suffering severe or extreme emotional
distress; and (3) actual and proximate causation of the emotional distress by
the defendant’s outrageous conduct. Conduct to be outrageous must be so extreme
as to exceed all bounds of that usually tolerated in a civilized community.” Wilson v. Hynek (2012) 207 Cal.App.4th
999, 1009, citation and ellipses omitted.
Plaintiffs allege
exposure to dog waste, moisture, water intrusion and toxic mold. FAC ¶¶ 17-19,
21. Plaintiffs allege West Properties intentionally failed to inform them of
the waste and did not make the unit safe for human occupation prior to leasing
it. Id. ¶ 20. Plaintiffs became ill due to the exposure. Id. ¶
28. Despite presenting doctor's notes and a mold report to West Properties, and
substandard remediation efforts performed in October 2022, West Properties
refused to take further action. Id. ¶¶ 29-47. 
 
This would be
sufficient to support the claim on demurrer because it demonstrates outrageous
conduct. The complaint further pleads West Properties intentionally withheld
information about the apartment and did not adequately address the issue,
despite being provided with evidence of intolerable living conditions. Thus, at
the pleadings stage, this is sufficient. OVERRULED.
 
Motion to Stike Punitive
Damages
Per Code Civ.
Proc., §436(a)-(b), defendant seeks to strike paragraphs 56, 114-116, 148-150,
and p. 22 ln. 27, regarding punitive damages. Defendant argues plaintiffs
allege only legal conclusions, not facts.
 
A plaintiff can
recover punitive damages in tort cases where “the defendant has been guilty of
oppression, fraud, or malice.” Civ. Code §3294(a). “The mere allegation an
intentional tort was committed is not sufficient to warrant an award of
punitive damages.  [Citation.]  Not only must there be circumstances of
oppression, fraud or malice, but facts must be alleged in the pleading to
support such a claim.  [Citation.]” Grieves
v. Superior Court (1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 159, 166, fn. omitted.
 
The Nitoius allege
defendant knew of the dog waste but failed to inform them prior to their
tenancy. Plaintiffs allege West Properties intentionally failed to inform them
of the waste and did not make the unit safe for occupation prior to leasing it
to plaintiffs. Id. ¶ 20. Plaintiffs provided West Properties with
several medical notes regarding minor Cameron Nitoiu’s illness from exposure to
mold and animal waste. However, no remedial action was taken. FAC ¶¶ 29-31; Ex.
2, 3. The Nitoius further allege they provided the mold report to West
Properties and asked them to remediate the problem. Id. ¶ 33. West
Properties refused to do so. Id. ¶ 34. Furthermore, the Nitoius allege
West Properties' prior attempts to remediate the apartment in October 2022 were
inadequate to address the toxic mold and dog waste. Id. ¶ 47. These
facts, if proven, might support a finding of malice. DENIED.
