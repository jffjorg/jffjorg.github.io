Howarth, Case No. 20SMCV01557
Hearing Date: July

Cross-complainant
Howarth’s Motion for Reconsideration

Via cross-complainant
Howarth’s Third Amended Cross-Complaint, Howarth alleges his neighbor Mardirossian
installed a fence encroaching on his property, built a tennis court violating a
Coastal Development Permit and setback requirements, and failed to construct a
noise-mitigating masonry wall as required. The court granted, in part, Mardirossian’s
summary judgment/adjudication motion. Howarth moves for reconsideration. 
 
Evidentiary
Rulings
Howarth’s request
for the court to take judicial notice of (1) Howarth’s Opposition to Plaintiff
and Cross-Defendant Garo Mardirossian’s Motion for Summary Judgment, (2) Howarth’s
Response to Plaintiff and Cross-Defendant Garo Mardirossian’s Separate
Statement of Undisputed Material Facts in Support of Its Motion for Summary
Judgment, (3) the Declaration of John LoVerde, and (4) the court’s Ruling on
Submitted Matter issued on 04/29/24, hereinafter referred to as Exhibits 1-4
respectively, are GRANTED under Evidence Code § 452(d) as the documents are
records of the Los Angeles County Superior Court. 
 
To succeed on a motion for reconsideration, the moving
party must present new facts, circumstances or law. CCP §1008(a); see also Mink
v. Superior Court (1992) 2 Cal.App.4th 1338, 1342. The party seeking
reconsideration shall state by affidavit what application was made before, what
order or decisions were made, and what new or different facts or circumstances
are claimed to be shown. CCP §1008(a). Further, “. . . the party seeking
reconsideration must provide not only new evidence but also a satisfactory explanation
for the failure to produce that evidence at an earlier time.” Glade v. Glade
(1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 1441, 1457 [emphasis added]. The legislative intent was
to restrict motions for reconsideration to circumstances where a party offers
the court some fact or circumstance not previously considered and some valid
reason for not offering it earlier. Gilberd v. AC Transit (1995) 32
Cal.App.4th 1494, 1500.  
 
Howarth argues the court made a factual error, arguing that
no wall was actually constructed on the relevant property line, or the
evidence presented in the LoVerde declaration. Howarth’s counsel resubmits
evidence previously provided to the court in connection with the motion for
summary judgment. 
 
Neither the declaration
and the accompanying documents provides the court with new facts, circumstances
or law, as required under CCP §1008(a). Given this, the court cannot grant the
motion for reconsideration. Relitigating the court’s decision, arguing the court made an
erroneous decision, does not meet moving party’s burden. DENIED.
