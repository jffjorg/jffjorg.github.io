Askari v. City of
Beverly Hills, et al., Case No. 23SMCV04848
Hearing Date July 30,
2024
Defendant City of
Beverly Hills’ Motion for Attorney’s Fees 
 
Plaintiff Askari alleged his neighbors’ tennis court created
a noise nuisance. Plaintiff alleged various causes of action against defendant
City of Beverly Hills and its employees Yelton and Chavez for failing to pursue
a municipal code violation action against the neighbors. Plaintiff
dismissed his case without prejudice on 5/9/24 at 12:32 a.m., after the court
issued a tentative ruling on 5/8/24 in favor of defendant City on its anti-SLAPP
motion and demurrer, which would have been heard on 5/9/24. The motions were
taken off calendar due to plaintiff’s request for dismissal. Defendant City
moves for attorney’s fees under Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16(c)(1),
arguing it is entitled to fees as a prevailing party. 
 
“[A] prevailing
defendant on a special motion to strike shall be entitled to recover his or her
attorney's fees and costs.” Code Civ. Proc. §425.16(c)(1). A court may award
attorneys’ fees to a prevailing defendant whose anti-SLAPP motion was not heard
because the complaint was dismissed on other grounds before the hearing on the
motion. White v. Lieberman (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 210, 220; Moraga-Orinda
Fire Protection Dist. v. Weir (2004) 115 Cal.App.4th 477, 480; ARP
Pharmacy Services, Inc. v. Gallagher Bassett Services, Inc. (2006) 138
Cal.App.4th 1307, 1323, disapproved on other grounds by Beeman v. Anthem
Prescription Management, LLC (2013) 58 Cal.4th 329. The fee award is
mandatory. Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1131.
 
Defendant contends
the fact of plaintiff's last-minute dismissal makes it the prevailing party. On
May 8, 2024 the court issued a tentative ruling granting defendants’ anti-SLAPP
motion as to COAs 1, 3-5 and sustaining the demurrer to COA 2. The City argues
it is the prevailing party entitled to $21,125.90 in fees and costs.
 
Plaintiff argues a
voluntary dismissal does not entitle the City to fees unless it shows dismissal
was intended to avoid an adverse ruling. Plaintiff asserts his dismissal was
not an attempt to avoid liability and argues he dismissed the claim unrelated reasons,
which are not explained. Plaintiff argues the requested fees are unreasonable.
 
A plaintiff’s
voluntary dismissal does not necessarily confer prevailing party status on a defendant,
particularly when the merits of the claim were never reached. See Gilbert
v. National Enquirer, Inc. (1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 1273, 1277. “Absent a
determination of the merits, it may be difficult or impossible to decide which
party has prevailed as a practical matter, and the court may appropriately find
there is no prevailing party." ComputerXpress, Inc. v. Jackson (2001)
93 Cal.App.4th 993, 1017.
 
The court posted
its tentative granting the anti-SLAPP motion the afternoon on 5/8/24 in advance
of the hearing scheduled for 5/9/24. Plaintiff dismissed the complaint on
5/9/24 at 12:32a.m., which seems done with the purpose of avoiding an adverse
ruling on the anti-SLAPP motion. Defendant is the prevailing party, so a fee
award is mandatory.  
 
Defendant seeks a
total of $21,125.90 in fees and costs. Defendant’s attorneys spent
approximately 55 hours litigating the anti-SLAPP motion, including time
required to prepare for the hearing and preparing a reply. Nguy Decl. ¶¶3, 6,
7, Exh. 3. In addition, defendants incurred $14.60 in costs for having to
download plaintiff’s opposition to the motion because defendants were never
served. Id. at ¶10, Exh. 4. The court finds the hourly rates requested
to be reasonable. 
 
Regarding the
number of hours requested, defendants waive 2 hours billed to preparing an ex
parte, which reduces the total by $994.50. The court strikes 5 hours for work
from counsel Nguy for “strategy” and duplicative billing, at $387 per hour, which
reduces the total by $1,935.00. The court awards $18,196.40 in attorney fees
and costs. GRANTED.
