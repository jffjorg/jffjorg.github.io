And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the motion of T1 Payments, LLC's counsel to be relieved as counsel of record. The motion is granted due to the inability of the counsel to represent the plaintiff, as control of the entity has vested with the bankruptcy estate trustee, who has indicated that new counsel will represent the entity. The judge accepts the representation of the bankruptcy trustee and finds that the motion complies with all procedural requirements. The trial remains set for April 29, 2024, and the moving attorney is ordered to provide notice.
