And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in plain English:

The judge is considering a motion filed by the defendants to vacate the default judgment entered against them. The defendants claim that they did not receive notice of the lawsuit and therefore did not have an opportunity to defend themselves.

The judge has reviewed the evidence and has determined that the service of the summons and complaint was valid. The defendants deny receiving the papers, but the judge finds their denials to be unreliable.

The judge also notes that the defendants waited until the last day possible to file their motion, which suggests that they may have intentionally delayed seeking relief.

Despite these findings, the judge grants the motion because of the unique circumstances of the case. The defendants are the widow and daughter of a deceased person, and the judge finds that it would be unfair to allow the plaintiff to collect on the judgment without giving the defendants an opportunity to defend themselves.

The judge orders the defendants to answer the complaint within 20 days and schedules a motion for appointment of a designated successor to represent the estate.
