RELIEF REQUESTED
Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel
of Record
 
SUMMARY OF ACTION
On August 23, 2021, Plaintiff T1 Payments, LLC a Nevada
Limited Liability Company, filed a complaint for Misappropriation of Trade
Secret, Breach of Fiduciary Duty, Breach of Duty of Loyalty, Breach of Duty of
Confidentiality, and Conversion. On February 23, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Notice
Of Stay of Proceedings following its January 30, 2023, filing of a Chapter 7
Bankruptcy in Nevada District Court. On August 22, 2023, the court declined to
impose any stay of the action based on Plaintiff’s bankruptcy petition. 
 
RULING: Granted.
Counsel for plaintiff T1 Payments,
LLC moves to be relieved as counsel of record, due to the inability to
represent Plaintiff. Control of the entity vested with bankruptcy estate
trustee, who indicated that new counsel would represent the entity. No
substitution occurred, thereby necessitating the subject motion. 
 
“The determination whether to grant or deny a motion to
withdraw as counsel lies within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi
& Levine v. Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1133.) The court
accepts the representation of the bankruptcy trustee electing to appoint new
counsel for the entity, and therefore the necessity for relief approximately
six weeks before the new trial date. The motion complies with all procedural
requirements. The motion is therefore granted. 
 
Order not effective until service on the client, and
bankruptcy trustee. The corporate entity, in whatever form, cannot appear in
the action without representation from an admitted attorney, if applicable. (Merco Constr. Engineers, Inc. v. Municipal
Court (1978) 21 Cal.3d 724, 731.)
 
Trial remains set for April 29, 2024.
