And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the plaintiff's motion to quash the subpoena issued by St. Clair to Pirate Holdings for the production of the settlement agreement between the plaintiff and Pirate Holdings. However, the judge orders that the parties keep the settlement agreement strictly confidential and disclose it only to the parties, their attorneys, and experts in the case. The parties may use the settlement agreement only for purposes of the litigation and for no other purpose. The judge also directs that if the parties wish to file any portion of the settlement agreement or a quote from the settlement agreement in a filed document, they must do so under seal.
