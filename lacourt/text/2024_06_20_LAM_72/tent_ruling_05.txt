Defendant T.D. Trauth (“Defendant”) moves for summary
judgment as to the Complaint filed by Plaintiff Linda Greif, Trustee of the
Greif Family Trust (“Plaintiff”). 
 
The Court GRANTS Defendant’s motion for summary judgment.
 
Background
 
            This
is an unlawful detainer case. The following facts are taken from the Complaint
and supporting documents.
 
            Defendant
is a tenant at the residential property located at 725 N. Sweetzer Avenue, Unit
102, Los Angeles, California 90069 (the “Property”). Plaintiff is the landlord
and owner of the Property. Plaintiff agreed to rent the property month-to-month
and pay rent of $2,100.00 per month.
 
            On
March 12, 2024, Plaintiff served Defendant with a three-day notice to pay rent
or quit (the “Notice”) by posting it on the premises. The Notice stated that Defendant
owed $29,400.00 in unpaid rent for the period of February 15, 2022 through
April 14, 2023.
 
            Plaintiff
filed this action on March 22, 2022, seeking past-due rent of $29,400.00,
attorney’s fees, forfeiture of the agreement, and damages.
 
            Defendant
filed this motion on June 5, 2024, with an original calendar date of July 16,
2024.
 
            On
June 7, 2024, the Court granted, over Plaintiff’s opposition, Defendant’s ex
parte application for an order shortening the time for the hearing to be held
and set the hearing for June 20, 2024. In that order, the Court continued the
jury trial scheduled for June 17, 2024 to July 1, 2024.
 
            Plaintiff
has not filed an opposition to the motion for summary judgment.
 
Legal Standard
 
The purpose of a motion for
summary judgment or summary adjudication “is to provide courts with a mechanism
to cut through the parties’ pleadings in order to determine whether, despite
their allegations, trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute.” (Aguilar
v. Atlantic Richfield Co., supra, 25 Cal.4th at p. 843.) “Code of
Civil Procedure section 437c, subdivision (c), requires the trial judge to
grant summary judgment if all the evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences
reasonably deducible from the evidence’ and uncontradicted by other inferences
or evidence, show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and
that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” (Adler v.
Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.) 
 
“In ruling on the motion,
the court must consider all of the evidence and all of the inferences
reasonably drawn therefrom [citation] and must view such evidence [citations]
and such inferences [citations] in the light most favorable to the opposing
party.” (Aguilar, supra, at pp. 844-845 [quotation marks
omitted].) 
 
“On a motion for summary
judgment, the initial burden is always on the moving party to make a prima
facie
showing that there are no triable issues of material fact.” (Scalf v. D. B.
Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1519.) A defendant moving
for summary judgment or summary adjudication “has met his or her burden of
showing that a cause of action has no merit if the party has shown that one or
more elements of the cause of action . . . cannot be established, or that there
is a complete defense to the cause of action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd.
(p)(2).) 
 
“Once the defendant . . .
has met that burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff . . . to show that a triable
issue of one or more material facts exists as to the cause of action or a
defense thereto.” (Ibid.) To establish a triable issue of material fact,
the party opposing the motion must produce substantial responsive evidence. (Sangster
v. Paetkau (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 151,
166.) “If the plaintiff cannot do
so, summary judgment should be granted.” (Avivi v. Centro Medico Urgente
Medical Center (2008) 159 Cal.App.4th 463, 467.)
 
Discussion
 
            A
three-day notice to pay rent or quit “may be served at any time within one year
after the rent becomes due.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1161, subd. (2).) “If a
landlord waits over one year to sue for unpaid rent, the landlord is limited to
collecting such rent in an ordinary breach of contract action, with all the
delays that remedy normally involves and without restitution of the demised
property.” (Bevill v. Zoura (1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 694, 697 [citation and
quotation marks omitted].)
 
            On
March 12, 2024, Plaintiff served Defendant with a three-day notice to pay rent
or quit (the “Notice”) by posting it on the premises. Plaintiff’s Notice stated
that Defendant owed $29,400.00 in unpaid rent for the period of February 15,
2022 through April 14, 2023. (Complaint, Ex. 2.) The Notice was served on March
12, 2024. (Complaint, Ex. 2.) The Notice therefore facially seeks rent that was
more than a year overdue at the time that it was served. The Notice is
therefore defective.
 
            Defendant
preemptively responds to a number of arguments Plaintiff might make regarding
the Covid-19 eviction moratorium. Because Plaintiff does not raise these
arguments, the Court does not address them.
 
            The
Court grants Defendant’s motion for summary judgment.
