 Hearing Date:  June 20, 2024
 Calendar Number:  4



 
 
 
Defendants Giorgio Baldi, Inc. (“GBI”) and Elena Baldi
(collectively, “Defendants”) move for judgment on the pleadings as to the
Complaint filed by Plaintiff Emanuele Giacometti (“Plaintiff”).
 
The Court GRANTS the motion as to Plaintiff’s first five
claims and DENIES the motion as to Plaintiff’s sixth claim.
 
Background
 
This action arises out of Plaintiff’s employment with GBI.
 
GBI terminated Plaintiff from his job as a waiter on March
16, 2020. (Complaint ¶ 23.)
 
Plaintiff filed this action against Defendants on June 13,
2023, raising claims for (1) failure to provide rest periods; (2) failure to
provide meal periods; (3) failure to pay wages due upon termination; (4)
conversion; (5) retaliation; and (6) unfair competition.
 
Defendants filed an Answer on September 14, 2023.
 
Defendants moved for judgment on the pleadings on May 28,
2024. Plaintiff filed a response and Defendants filed a reply.
 
Legal Standard
 
Either prior to trial, but after the time to answer or demur
has passed, or at the trial, the plaintiff or the defendant may move for
judgment on the pleadings and that the appropriate ground for such a motion is
the same as that arguable by general demurrer, namely, the failure to state a
cause of action or defense. (Dobbins v. Hardister (1966) 242 Cal.App.2d
787, 791; See also Sofias v. Bank of America (1985) 172 Cal.App.3d 583,
586 [The non-statutory motion for judgment on the pleadings can be made at any
time, even during trial, since the grounds for a general demurrer are never
waived.], see also Code Civ. Proc., §438(f).)  
 
A motion for judgment on the pleadings performs the same
function as a general demurrer, and hence attacks only defects disclosed on the
face of the pleadings or by matters that can be judicially noticed. (See, e.g.,
Weil & Brown, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (TRG 1998)
§§ 7:275, 7:322; Lance Camper Manufacturing Corp. v. Republic Indemnity Co.
(1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 194, 198.) Presentation of extrinsic evidence is
therefore not proper on a motion for judgment on the pleadings. (Id.; Cloud
v. Northrop Grumman Corp. (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 995, 999.) Both a demurrer
and a motion for judgment on the pleadings accept as true all material factual
allegations of the challenged pleading, unless contrary to law or to facts of
which a court may take judicial notice. (Mechanical Contractors Assn. v.
Greater Bay Area Assn. (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 672, 677; Edwards v. Centex
Real Estate Corp, (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 15, 27.) 
 
The motion may be made only after one of the following
conditions has occurred: (1) If the moving party is a plaintiff, and the
defendant has already filed his or her answer to the complaint and the time for
the plaintiff to demur to the answer has expired; (2) If the moving party is a
defendant, and the defendant has already filed his or her answer to the
complaint and the time for the defendant to demur to the complaint has expired.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 438(f).) The motion provided for in Code of Civil Procedure
section 438 may be made even though either of the following conditions
exist:  (1) The moving party has already demurred to the complaint or
answer, as the case may be, on the same grounds as is the basis for the motion
provided for in this section and the demurrer has been overruled, provided that
there has been a material change in applicable case law or statute since the
ruling on the demurrer; (2) The moving party did not demur to the complaint or
answer, as the case may be, on the same grounds as is the basis for the motion
provided for in this section. (Code Civ. Proc., § 438(g).) No motion may be
made pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 438 if a pretrial conference
order has been entered pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 575, or
within 30 days of the date the action is initially set for trial, whichever is
later, unless the court otherwise permits. (Code Civ. Proc., § 438(e).)
 
Discussion
 
Defendants contend that Plaintiff’s first five claims must
be dismissed because Plaintiff brought them outside of their three-year
statutes of limitations. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 338 [3- year period for
liability created by statute]; Lab. Code, § 226.7 [statute creating claim for
failure to provide meal and rest periods]; Lab. Code § 203, subd. (b) [suit
penalties for failure to pay wages subject to same statute of limitations as an
action on the wages in question]; AmerUS Life Ins. Co. v. Bank of Am., N.A. (2006)
143 Cal. App. 4th 631, 639 [actions for taking goods governed by Code Civ.
Proc., § 338(c)’s three-year statute of limitations]; Lab. Code, § 1102.6
[statute creating claim for retaliation].)
 
Plaintiff does not dispute Defendants’ contention that his
first five claims are untimely. Plaintiff does argue that his sixth and final
claim, for unfair business practices, is timely.
 
To set forth a claim for a violation
of Business and Professions Code section 17200 (“UCL”), Plaintiff must
establish Defendant was engaged in an “unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business
act or practice and unfair, deceptive, untrue or misleading advertising” and
certain specific acts. (Bus. & Prof. Code, § 17200.) A cause of action for
unfair competition “is not an all-purpose substitute for a tort or contract
action.” (Cortez v. Purolator Air
Filtration Products Co. (2000) 23 Cal.4th 163, 173.)
 
The UCL has a four-year statute of limitations. (Bus. &
Prof. Code, § 17208.)
 
Defendants argue that Plaintiff’s UCL claim is time-barred
because it simply reasserts the facts of Plaintiff’s other claims, which are
themselves time-barred. The court disagrees. The UCL creates a separate cause
of action with a separate statute of limitations. Defendants have provided no
law to indicate that the UCL simply imports the statutes of limitations from
other causes of action pertaining to the violation of law that forms the basis
for the claim. This is especially salient because the UCL is not, as
discussed above, a mere substitute for other torts.
 
Defendants argue that Plaintiff’s UCL claim is impermissibly
vague. Defendants do not contend that Plaintiff has failed to allege that
Defendants engaged in unlawful acts. Defendants’ contention therefore appears
to assume that Plaintiff’s factual allegations regarding time-barred claims
must be stricken because his claims must be stricken. As discussed above, that
is not the law, because the UCL creates a standalone claim.
 
The Court therefore grants the motion as to Plaintiff’s
first five claims and denies the motion as to Plaintiff’s sixth claim.
