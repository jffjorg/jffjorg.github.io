And here is the summary in English:

The tentative ruling is regarding a lawsuit filed by the Hipilito-Diep Family Trust against J.D.C. Insurance Services, Inc. for breach of contract. The defendant filed a demurrer, which tests the legal sufficiency of the pleadings. The court found that the complaint fails to state a cause of action due to lack of specificity and failure to attach the alleged agreement. The demurrer is sustained without leave to amend, meaning the plaintiff cannot amend the complaint to fix the defects. The court also granted the defendant's request for judicial notice of the complaint. The ruling indicates that the plaintiff did not meet its burden of showing how the pleading could be amended successfully.
