MOTION
 
This case arises from a dispute over a commercial lease.  On August 18, 2022, the Court granted summary
judgment in favor of Defendants Pelle Cure LLC; Anna Margaryan; Dennis
Colonello; and Steven Yoon Shin (collectively, “Defendants”).  Judgment was entered on September 19,
2022.  Plaintiff Elite Financial Realty,
LLC (“Plaintiff”) timely appealed on October 3, 2022.  The appellate court affirmed the judgment and
issued the remittitur on October 10, 2024. 

 
On September 19, 2024, Defendants filed a memorandum of costs, seeking
$54.32 for preparing and issuing abstract of judgment on November 21, 2022;
$165 for recording and indexing the abstract of judgment on December 1, 2022;
$5 for filing notice of judgment lien on personal property on December 1, 2022,
for a total of $224.32 in costs, plus over $80,000 in attorneys’ fees pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure section 685.040. 

 
In addition, on October 2, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant motion to
tax costs.
 
On November 8, 2024, Defendants filed another memorandum of costs,
seeking the same $224.32 in costs and over $88,000 in attorneys’ fees.  
 
In this ruling, the Court only addresses the matter of the $224.32 in
costs sought.  The Court will separately
addresses Defendants’ request for attorneys’ fees in connection with
Defendants’ separately-filed motion for attorneys’ fees which is set to be
heard on December 9, 2024.
 
ANALYSIS
 
1.     Timeliness of Motion
 
Code of Civil Procedure
section 685.070 provides:
 
(c) Within 10 days after the
memorandum of costs is served on the judgment debtor, the judgment debtor may
apply to the court on noticed motion to have the costs taxed by the court. The
notice of motion shall be served on the judgment creditor. Service shall be
made personally or by mail. The court shall make an order allowing or
disallowing the costs to the extent justified under the circumstances of the
case.
 
(d) If no motion to tax costs
is made within the time provided in subdivision (c), the costs claimed in the
memorandum are allowed.
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 685.070, subds. (c)-(d).)
 
Here, Defendants filed and
electronically served the memorandum of costs on September 19, 2024.  Ten days after September 19 was Sunday,
September 29, which extends to Monday, September 30, by operation of California
Rules of Court, rule 1.10(a).  
 
Further, “Any period of
notice, or any right or duty to do any act or make any response within any
period or on a date certain after the service of the document, which time period
or date is prescribed by statute or rule of court, shall be extended after
service by electronic means by two court days[….]”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1010.6, subd. (a)(3)(B).)  Therefore, Plaintiff’s deadline to file a
motion to tax costs was October 2. 
Therefore, Plaintiff’s motion is timely.
 
2.     Substance of Motion
 
Plaintiff does not contest the
$224.32 sought in costs, and contests only the amount of attorneys’ fees
sought, which the Court addresses in connection with Defendants’ separately-filed
motion for attorneys’ fees.
 
Conclusion
 
Therefore, the Court denies Plaintiff’s
motion to tax costs and grants Defendants’ unopposed request for $224.32 in costs.  
 
Defendants shall provide notice of the
Court’s ruling and file the notice with a proof of service forthwith.
