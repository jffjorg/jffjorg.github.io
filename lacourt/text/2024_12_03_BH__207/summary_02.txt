And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling clarifies the role of pleadings in a summary judgment motion. The judge notes that the pleadings set the boundaries of the issues to be resolved at summary judgment, and that the materiality of a disputed fact is measured by the pleadings. The judge also explains that a defendant moving for summary judgment only needs to negate the plaintiff's theories of liability as alleged in the complaint, and that they do not need to refute liability on some theoretical possibility not included in the pleadings. The judge is relying on relevant case law, including Hutton v. Fidelity National Title Co. and Laabs v. City of Victorville, to support this ruling.
