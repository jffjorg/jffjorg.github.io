MOTIONS
 
On July 23, 2024, Plaintiff Sandra Aronberg (“Plaintiff”) filed an
unlawful detainer complaint against Defendants Yossie Kohanim (“Yossie”), Ronit
Kohanim (“Ronit”) and all unauthorized occupants.
 
On August 12, 2024, Yossie demurred to the complaint for failure to
state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, because the complaint
fails to allege specific facts that there exists a lease or that Plaintiff is a
landlord.   On August 14, 2024, Ronit filed
an identical demurrer on the same grounds.
 
On August 14, 2024, Claimant Ron Adams (“Claimant” or “Adams”) filed a
Prejudgment Claim of Right to Possession of the premises.  On August 22, Claimant filed an identical
demurrer on the same grounds as Yossie and Ronit.
 
On September 3, 2024, Plaintiff filed a combined opposition to the
demurrers.
 
On October 9, 2024, Yossie answered the complaint, and on October 10,
2024, Claimant Adams answered.  
 
On October 10, 2024, Ronit filed a Motion to Quash Service of Summons.
 The Motion to Quash is unopposed.
 
ANALYSIS
 
1.     DEMURRER
 
“It is black letter law that a demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of
the allegations in a complaint.”  (Lewis v. Safeway, Inc. (2015)
235 Cal.App.4th 385, 388.)  In testing the sufficiency of a cause of
action, a court accepts “[a]s true all material facts properly pled and matters
which may be judicially noticed but disregard contentions, deductions or
conclusions of fact or law.  [A court
also gives] the complaint a reasonable interpretation, reading it as a whole
and its parts in their context.”  (290
Division (EAT), LLC v. City & County of San Francisco (2022) 86
Cal.App.5th 439, 450 [cleaned up]; Hacker v. Homeward Residential, Inc.
(2018) 26 Cal.App.5th 270, 280 [“in considering the merits of a demurrer,
however, “the facts alleged in the pleading are deemed to be true, however
improbable they may be”].)
 
Further, in ruling on a demurrer, a court must “liberally construe”
the allegations of the complaint “with a view to substantial justice between
the parties.”  (See Code Civ. Proc., §
452.)  “This rule of liberal construction
means that the reviewing court draws inferences favorable to the plaintiff, not
the defendant.”  (Perez v. Golden Empire Transit Dist. (2012) 209
Cal.App.4th 1228, 1238.)   
 
In summary, “[d]etermining whether the complaint is sufficient as
against the demurrer on the ground that it does not state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action, the rule is that if on consideration of all the
facts stated it appears the plaintiff is entitled to any relief at the hands of
the court against the defendants the complaint will be held good although the
facts may not be clearly stated, or may be intermingled with a statement of
other facts irrelevant to the cause of action shown, or although the plaintiff
may demand relief to which he is not entitled under the facts alleged.”  (Gressley v. Williams (1961) 193
Cal.App.2d 636, 639.)
 
A.   
FAILURE TO STATE A CAUSE OF ACTION
 
Although a party may file a demurrer and answer at the same time (Code
Civ. Proc., § 430.30, subd. (c)), a subsequently-filed answer moots the pending
demurrer (See JKC3H8 v. Colton (2013) 221 Cal.App.4th 468, 477 [“[A]n
amendatory pleading supersedes the original one, which ceases to perform any
function as a pleading”].)
 
Thus, it appears that Yossie and Adams have mooted their own pending
demurrers by virtue of the answers they subsequently filed.
 
Regarding Ronit’s still-pending demurrer, paragraph four of the
complaint indicates Plaintiff is the owner of the premises, and paragraph six
of the complaint provides the terms of the lease at issue.  Therefore, Plaintiff’s unlawful detainer
claim does not fail for lack of facts that Plaintiff has standing to bring it
or for lack of facts regarding the underlying lease.
 
2.     MOTION
TO QUASH
 
“A defendant, on or before the last day of his or her time to plead or
within any further time that the court may for good cause allow, may serve and
file a notice of motion for one or more of the following purposes: (1) To quash
service of summons on the ground of lack of jurisdiction of the court over him
or her.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 418.10,
subd. (a)(1).)  
 
“In the absence of a voluntary
submission to the authority of the court, compliance with the statutes
governing service of process is essential to establish that court's personal
jurisdiction over a defendant. When a defendant challenges that jurisdiction by
bringing a motion to quash, the burden is on the plaintiff to prove the
existence of jurisdiction by proving, inter alia, the facts requisite to an
effective service.”  (Dill v. Berquist
Construction Co. (1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 1426, 1439–1440; accord Lebel v. Mai (2012) 210 Cal.App.4th
1154, 1160 [“It was incumbent upon plaintiff, after the filing of defendant's
motion to quash, to present evidence discharging her burden to establish the
requisites of valid service on defendant”]; Summers v. McClanahan (2006)
140 Cal.App.4th 403, 413 [“when a defendant challenges the court's personal
jurisdiction on the ground of improper service of process ‘the burden is on the
plaintiff to prove the existence of jurisdiction by proving, inter alia, the
facts requisite to an effective service’ ”].)  
A declaration of service by a registered process server establishes a
presumption that the facts stated in the declaration are true. (Evid. Code, §
647; Rodriguez v. Cho (2015) 236 Cal.App.4th 742, 750.)
 
            “In
order to obtain in personam jurisdiction through any form of constructive
service there must be strict compliance with the requisite statutory
procedures.  (Zirbes v. Stratton
(1986) 187 Cal.App.3d 1407, 1417, quoting Stamps v. Superior Court (1971)
14 Cal.App.3d 108, 110.)  
 
For service on persons within California, generally, service of
summons and complaint must be done by personal service.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 415.10.)  However, “[i]f a copy of the summons and
complaint cannot with reasonable diligence be personally delivered to the
person to be served,” a plaintiff may
serve an individual defendant “by leaving a copy of the summons and complaint
at the person's dwelling house, usual place of abode, usual place of business,
or usual mailing address . . . , in the presence of a competent member of the
household or a person apparently in charge of his or her office, place of
business, or usual mailing address . . . , at least 18 years of age, who shall
be informed of the contents thereof, and by thereafter mailing a copy of the
summons and of the complaint by first-class mail, postage prepaid to the person
to be served at the place where a copy of the summons and complaint were
left.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 415.20, subd.
(b).)   Further, “A summons in an action for unlawful
detainer of real property may be served by posting if upon affidavit it appears
to the satisfaction of the court in which the action is pending that the party
to be served cannot with reasonable diligence be served in any manner specified
in this article other than publication . . . .” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 415.45, subd. (a).)
 
A court may also exercise jurisdiction over an individual who consents
to such jurisdiction.  (Nobel Floral,
Inc. v. Pasero (2003) 106 Cal.App.4th 654, 658.)  “Express consent to a court's jurisdiction
will occur by generally appearing in an action or by a valid forum-selection
clause designating a particular forum for dispute resolution regardless of
residence.”  (Ibid. [cleaned
up].)  “A
defendant appears in an action when the defendant answers, demurs,
files a notice of motion to strike, files a notice of motion to transfer
pursuant to Section 396b, moves for reclassification pursuant to Section
403.040, gives the plaintiff written notice of appearance, or when an attorney
gives notice of appearance for the defendant.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1014, emphasis added; see also Global Financial
Distributors Inc. v. Superior Court (2019) 35 Cal.App.5th 179, 193 [“Filing
a demurrer, however, is a general appearance”].)  

 
Here, Ronit made a general appearance in this action by filing a
demurrer to the complaint on August 14, 2024, nearly two months before Ronit
filed the motion to quash on October 10, 2024. 

 
Consequently, the Court finds that Ronit, by making the general
appearance, consented to the jurisdiction of this Court and waived any
challenge to the proper service of the summons. 
Therefore, the Court denies Ronit’s motion to quash as procedurally
defective.
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
For the reasons stated, the Court overrules Yossie’s and Adams’ demurrers
as moot and substantively overrules Ronit’s demurrer, finding Plaintiff
adequately alleged ownership of the subject premises and the terms of the lease
at issue.  
 
The Court also denies Ronit’s motion to quash service, having found
that Ronit consented to jurisdiction by making a general appearance through the
demurrer filed on August 14, 2024.
 
Further, the Court orders Ronit to file an Answer to the Complaint on
or before December 9, 2024.
 
Plaintiff shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file the
notice with a proof of service.
