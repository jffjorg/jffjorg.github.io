And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of 24SMCV03532, regarding a motion to quash service of summons filed by Defendant Ronit Kohanim. The Judge has also addressed demurrers filed by Defendants Yossie Kohanim and Claimant Ron Adams.

The Judge found that Yossie and Adams' demurrers are moot, as they have filed answers to the complaint. The Judge also found that Ronit's demurrer is procedurally defective, as Ronit has made a general appearance in the action by filing a demurrer on August 14, 2024.

The Judge denied Ronit's motion to quash service, finding that Ronit has waived any challenge to the proper service of the summons by making a general appearance. The Judge ordered Ronit to file an answer to the complaint on or before December 9, 2024.

The Judge's ruling is based on the following facts: Plaintiff Sandra Aronberg filed an unlawful detainer complaint against Defendants Yossie Kohanim, Ronit Kohanim, and Claimant Ron Adams. Yossie and Ronit filed demurrers to the complaint, alleging that it fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. Claimant filed a Prejudgment Claim of Right to Possession of the premises. Plaintiff filed a combined opposition to the demurrers. Yossie and Claimant answered the complaint. Ronit filed a motion to quash service of summons.

The Judge cited various California codes and statutes in support of the ruling, including Code of Civil Procedure sections 415.10, 415.20, and 415.45, as well as California Evidence Code section 647 and Code of Civil Procedure section 1014.
