[1] “The pleadings play a key role in a summary judgment
motion.  The function of the pleadings in
a motion for summary judgment is to delimit the scope of the issues and to
frame the outer measure of materiality in a summary judgment proceeding.  As our Supreme Court has explained it:  The materiality of a disputed fact is
measured by the pleadings, which set the boundaries of the issues to be resolved
at summary judgment.  Accordingly, the
burden of a defendant moving for summary judgment only requires that he or she
negate plaintiff's theories of liability as alleged in the complaint; that is,
a moving party need not refute liability on some theoretical possibility not
included in the pleadings.”  (Hutton
v. Fidelity National Title Co. (2013) 213 Cal.App.4th 486, 493 [cleaned
up]; see also Laabs v. City of Victorville (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 1242,
1258 [“The complaint limits the issues to be addressed at the motion for
summary judgment. The rationale is clear: It is the allegations in the
complaint to which the summary judgment motion must respond”].)
