And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is regarding a motion to tax costs in a commercial lease dispute between Elite Financial Realty, LLC (Plaintiff) and Pelle Cure LLC, Anna Margaryan, Dennis Colonello, and Steven Yoon Shin (Defendants). The Plaintiff timely appealed the grant of summary judgment in favor of the Defendants, and the appellate court affirmed the judgment. The Defendants filed a memorandum of costs seeking $224.32 for preparing and issuing an abstract of judgment, recording and indexing the abstract, and filing a notice of judgment lien. The Plaintiff filed a motion to tax costs, contesting only the amount of attorneys' fees sought. The Court finds that the Plaintiff's motion is timely and denies the motion to tax costs, granting the Defendants' unopposed request for $224.32 in costs. The Court will separately address the Defendants' request for attorneys' fees in connection with their separately-filed motion for attorneys' fees.
