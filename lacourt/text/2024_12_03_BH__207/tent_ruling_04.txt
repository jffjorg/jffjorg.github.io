[2] Ultimate
facts are those “constituting the cause of action” or those upon which
liability depends, e.g., duty of care, breach of the duty and causation
(damages).  (See Doe v. City of Los
Angeles (2007) 42 Cal.4th 531, 550.) 
“[T]he term ultimate fact generally refers to a core fact, such as an
essential element of a claim. Ultimate facts are distinguished from evidentiary
facts and from legal conclusions.”  (Central
Valley General Hosp. v. Smith (2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 501, 513 [cleaned up];
see also Rodriguez v. Parivar, Inc. (2022) 83 Cal.App.5th 739, 750–751
[“The elements of a cause of action constitute the essential or ultimate facts
in a civil case”].)
