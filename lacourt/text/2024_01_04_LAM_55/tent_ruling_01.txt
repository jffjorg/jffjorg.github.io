  Case Number:  21STCV22686    Hearing Date:   January 4, 2024    Dept:  55  
NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS:
 Motion of Sarkis Jacob Babachanian to be
Relieved as Attorney of Record for Plaintiff.
 
The motion is granted. 
The Court will sign and file a proposed, form order
lodged with the subject motion.
 
 
 
On 6/17/21, Plaintiff AHANG ZARIN filed a Complaint
alleging legal malpractice. Defendant FELDMAN BERMAN SCHWARTZ, LLP filed a Cross-Complaint
against Plaintiff, alleging that she has not paid for the legal services she
received.
Counsel for Plaintiff has now filed a motion to be
relieved as counsel because of Plaintiff’s nonpayment, noncooperation, and noncommunication,
as well as counsel’s conflict of interest and health issues.
Procedurally, the form notice, declaration, proposed
order, and proof of service are sufficiently in compliance.  See  CRC Rule 3.1362.
Additionally, moving counsel’s declaration shows
cognizable grounds for withdrawal:

Client
     breaches an agreement or obligation to the member as to expenses or
     fees.  Rules Prof. Conduct, Rule 1.16(b)(5);  Lempert v. Sup. Ct.
     (2003) 112 Cal.
     App. 4th 1161, 1173.
Breakdown
     in the attorney-client relationship (or personality clash).  Estate of Falco v. Decker (1987)
     188 Cal.App.3d 1004, 1014.
Client
     by conduct renders it unreasonably difficult for the member to carry out
     the employment effectively (e.g., noncooperation or
     noncommunication).  Rules Prof. Conduct, Rule 1.16(b)(4).  Cf.  Estate of Falco (1987) 188 Cal.
     App. 3d 1004, 1020 (“We find no abuse of discretion in the trial court's
     implicit finding rejecting the contention that respondents' lack of
     cooperation justified appellants' withdrawal.”).
Continued
     employment is likely to result in a violation of these rules or of the
     State Bar Act.  Rules Prof. Conduct,
     Rule 1.16.
The
     member's mental or physical condition renders it unreasonably difficult to
     carry out the employment effectively.  Rules Prof. Conduct, Rule
     1.16.

 
Further, no opposing papers have been filed in order
to evidence any prejudice to the client. 
See  Rules Prof. Conduct, Rule 1.16(d).  
“The determination whether to grant or deny an
attorney 's motion to  withdraw as
counsel of record lies within the sound discretion  of the trial court, having in mind whether such
withdrawal might work an injustice in the handling of the case.”  Lempert v. Sup. Ct.
(2003) 112 Cal.
App. 4th 1161, 1173.  See also 
Jones v. Green (1946) 74 Cal.
App. 2d 223, 230.
