The tentative ruling denies the Plaintiff's motion for an order appointing a discovery referee. The motion was based on the Plaintiff's counsel's declaration detailing the severe and improper abuses and uncivil behavior of defendants' counsel, Erik Syverson, during a deposition. The Court is disappointed by Syverson's behavior and admonishes him to behave civilly, citing local rules regarding civility in litigation. The Court orders the Plaintiff to use only two hours of deposition time for Mr. Lackey and requires counsel to lodge transcripts of future depositions with the Court for review. The motion is denied without prejudice to renew the motion or file a request for sanctions if Syverson's behavior does not change at future depositions.
