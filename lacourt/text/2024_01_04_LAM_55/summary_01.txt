And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted a motion filed by Sarkis Jacob Babachanian, counsel for the plaintiff AHANG ZARIN, to be relieved as attorney of record. The motion was filed due to the plaintiff's nonpayment, noncooperation, and noncommunication, as well as counsel's conflict of interest and health issues. The judge found that the plaintiff's breaches of agreement and obligation to pay fees, as well as her noncooperation and noncommunication, provide cognizable grounds for withdrawal. The judge also noted that no opposing papers were filed to evidence any prejudice to the client. As a result, the court will sign and file a proposed form order granting the motion.
