SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
On 2/15/23, Plaintiff Rosalinda Kramer as Trustee for the
Rosalinda L. Kramer Family Trust (Plaintiff) filed this unlawful detainer
action against Defendant Pete Karaiskos (Defendant) regarding residential
property located at 21330 Kickapoo Trail, Chatsworth, California 91311 (the
Property).  
 
On 3/18/23, Defendant was personally served with the
summons and complaint, among other documents, at the Property.  (See Proof Service filed 3/30/23).  On 3/20/23, default was entered against
Defendant.  On 4/12/23, default judgment
for possession only was entered against Defendant.  On 4/13/23, the Court denied Defendant’s Ex Parte
Application for Order Staying the Judgment. 
(See 4/13/23 Minute Order). 
On 10/6/23 Default Judgment for past-due rent, holdover damages,
attorney fees and costs was entered against Defendant in the total amount of
$30,840.50.  
 
On 12/2/24, Defendant filed a Notice of Change of Address
(served on 11/28/24) and the instant motion seeking an order vacating and
setting aside the default judgment entered against Defendant on 10/6/23 and any
judgment prior to that date and subsequent to Defendant’s eviction (served on 11/26/24).  On 12/2/24, Plaintiff filed (served on
12/1/24) an opposition to the motion.  A
reply to the opposition has not been filed. 

 
ANALYSIS
 
Although titled as “Declaration In Support of Motion for
Relief From Default Judgment,” the notice of motion indicates that Defendant
seeks to have the default judgment set aside pursuant to CCP 473 because the
default judgment was purportedly taken against Defendant without any actual
contact with defendant.  (See
Motion, pdf 2:1-6).  Later, the points
and authorities in support of the motion request that the Court grant the
motion pursuant to CCP 473.5 because Defendant purportedly received no actual
notice of the action in time to defend, defendant timely filed a motion for
relief from default and the default and default judgment were not caused by
Defendant’s avoidance of service or inexcusable neglect.  (See Motion, pdf 7:22-8:21).
 
Defendant contends that the judgment was entered against
him due to his inability to attend court in these matters and his claim that he
was never notified of any hearings or judgment in this case because notice was
sent to the property address despite Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s attorney
purportedly having Defendant’s contact information.  (See Motion, pdf 3:26-4:4).  Defendant contends the first time he was
aware default judgment had been entered against him was when $8,814.29 had been
withdrawn from his bank account. 
(Motion, pdf 4:5-6).
 
Defendant has failed to establish that relief from the
defaults and/or default judgments are warranted in this case.
 
Defendant does not dispute being personally served with
the Summons and Complaint in this matter on 3/18/23.  The evidence shows that Defendant had actual
notice of the action in time to defend yet Defendant failed to do so.  As such, relief under CCP 473.5 is not
available.  See CCP 473.5(a).
 
Relief is not available under CCP 473(b) as the motion
was filed and served more than six months after the entry of default and
default judgment.  See CCP 473(b).  Even if the motion had been timely filed and
served, Defendant has failed to establish that the default and/or default
judgment was entered against him as a result of mistake, inadvertence, surprise
or excusable neglect.  As noted above,
the evidence shows that Defendant was personally served with the summons and
complaint in this matter and Defendant failed to respond resulting in the
entries of default and default judgment. 

 
Defendant seems to be claiming that he did not receive
notice of the requests for entry of default and default judgment because they
were mailed to the Property address from which he had moved by the time of
service.  However, Defendant listed the
address where service was made on his 4/13/23 ex parte application and did not
file a notice of change of address until 12/2/24 (which was served on
11/28/24).  As such, the notices were
properly served on Defendant’s address of record at the time.  Furthermore, there is no requirement that
defendant receive a copy of the request for entry of default as long as a
mailing declaration certifies that it has been sent.  See CCP 587; Standard Microsystems
Corp. (2009) 179 CA4th 868, 899-900. 
 
In addition to the foregoing, the motion also fails under
both CCP 473 and CCP 473.5 because it is not accompanied by a copy of the
answer or other pleading proposed to be filed. 
See CCP 473(b); CCP 473.5(b).
 
The Court notes that the motion includes a “notice of
motion” for a “Motion for Order Staying Execution.”  (See Motion, pdf 5-6).  To the extent that such a motion is being
made, it also fails due to lack of supporting authority or evidence.  
 
CONCLUSION
The motion is denied.
