RULING: The motion is granted as set forth
below.  
 
SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
Griselda Sierra-Arriaza’s (Arriaza) operative First
Amended Complaint alleges causes of action against Pauline Macareno (Macareno) and
others for: (1) Breach of Contract, (2) Common Counts and (3) Fraud.  Macareno has filed a cross-complaint against
Eliseo Sierra for: (1) Equitable Indemnity and (2) Common Counts – Money Had
and Received.
 
On 1/11/24, Arriaza served Macareno with the subject
discovery requests making responses due on or before 2/15/24.  (Miller Decls., Ex.1).  Since responses were not received, on 4/4/24,
Arriaza’s counsel sent a letter to Macareno requesting responses; however, no
response was received.  (Miller Decls.,
Ex.2).
 
As a result, on 4/30/24, Arriaza filed and served the
instant motions seeking:  
 
(1) An order compelling Defendant/Cross-Complainant
Pauline Macareno to serve responses without objection to
Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant Griselda Sierra-Arriaza’s Form
Interrogatories, Set 1, Re: General Denial, within 10 days.  Additionally, Arriaza requests an order
imposing sanctions against Macareno in the amount of $1,510.00.
 
(2) An order compelling Defendant/Cross-Complainant
Pauline Macareno to serve responses without objection to
Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant Griselda Sierra-Arriaza’s Requests
for Production of Documents, Set 1, Re: Cross-Complaint, within 10
days.  Additionally, Arriaza requests an
order imposing sanctions against Macareno in the amount of $1,510.00.
 
(3) An order compelling Defendant/Cross-Complainant
Pauline Macareno to serve responses without objection to
Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant Griselda Sierra-Arriaza’s Requests
for Production of Documents, Set 1, Re: General Denial, within 10
days.  Additionally, Arriaza requests an
order imposing sanctions against Macareno in the amount of $1,510.00.
 
(4) An order compelling Defendant/Cross-Complainant
Pauline Macareno to serve responses without objection to
Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant Griselda Sierra-Arriaza’s Special
Interrogatories, Set 1, Re: Cross-Complaint, within 10 days.  Additionally, Arriaza requests an order
imposing sanctions against Macareno in the amount of $1,510.00.
 
(5) An order compelling Defendant/Cross-Complainant
Pauline Macareno to serve responses without objection to
Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant Griselda Sierra-Arriaza’s Special
Interrogatories, Set 1, Re: General Denial, within 10 days.  Additionally, Arriaza requests an order
imposing sanctions against Macareno in the amount of $1,510.00.
 
Macareno has not opposed or otherwise responded to the
motions.
 
ANALYSIS
 
Due to Macareno’s failure to provide timely responses to
the subject discover requests, Arriaza is entitled to orders compelling
Macareno to provide responses without objection.  CCP 2030.290(a), (b); CCP 2031.300(a), (b).  
 
Additionally, Arriaza is entitled to awards of sanctions
against Macareno due to her failure to comply with her discovery
obligations.  CCP 2023.010(d); CCP
2023.030(a); CCP 2030.290(c); CCP 2031.300(c). 

The Court finds that sanctions in the total amount of amount
of $1,257.00 (.3 hours to meet and confer + 2 hours to prepare motions + 1 hour
to prepare for and appear at the hearing multiplied by $290/hour + $300 ($60 x
5) filing fees) for all five motions are reasonable under the circumstances.  (See Miller Decls. ¶¶6-11).  The reduced sanctions are based on: (1) counsel
prepared only one meet and confer letter regarding all five of the discovery
requests; (2) the motions are the same except for minor changes regarding the
discovery requests at issue in each motion; (3) no oppositions have been filed,
therefore, no time was expended reviewing same or preparing replies; and (4) there
will only be one hearing to prepare for and appear at.  
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motions are granted. 
Defendant/Cross-Complainant Pauline Macareno is ordered to provide
responses, without objection, to: (1) Form Interrogatories, Set 1, Re: General
Denial; (2) Requests for Production of Documents, Set 1, Re: Cross-Complaint;
(3) Requests for Production of Documents, Set 1, Re: General Denial; (4) Special
Interrogatories, Set 1, Re: Cross-Complaint; and (5) Special Interrogatories,
Set 1, Re: General Denial, served on her by Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant Griselda
Sierra-Arriaza within 30 days.  Macareno
is also ordered to pay sanctions in the amount of $1257.00, for all five
motions, within 30 days.
