SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY  
 
This action arises out of Plaintiff Ramiro Montoya, Jr.’s
(Plaintiff) tenancy in property owned by Defendant Saint Anthanasius Coptic
Orthodox Church (Defendant).  Plaintiff
contends that the unit Plaintiff resided in experienced plumbing problems,
water leaks and mold. 
 
On 12/14/23, Plaintiff filed this action against
Defendant for: (1) Breach of Implied Warranty of Habitability, (2) Tortious
Breach of Implied Warranty of Habitability, (3) Negligence, (4) Intentional
Infliction of Emotional Distress, (5) Private Nuisance and (6) Violation of
Business & Professions Code 17200, et seq. 

 
After meet and confer efforts failed to resolve the
issues Defendant had with the complaint, on 2/26/24, Defendant filed and served
the instant demurrer to the 4th and 6th causes of action
and motion to strike which seeks to strike the 4th cause of action
(¶¶49-53), the 6th cause of action (¶¶62-68) and the prayers for
relief related to the 4th and 6th causes of action
(Prayer ¶¶9-11, 15).  Plaintiff has
opposed the demurrer and motion to strike and Defendant has filed and served
replies to the oppositions.  
 
ANALYSIS
A demurrer may be based on the grounds that the complaint
fails to allege sufficient facts to state a specific cause of action and/or the
cause of action is uncertain.  CCP
430.10(e), (f).
 
4th cause of action – Intentional
Infliction of Emotional Distress
 
The elements of cause of action for intentional
infliction of mental distress are: (1) outrageous conduct by the defendant, (2)
intention to cause or reckless disregard of the probability of causing
emotional distress, (3) severe emotional suffering and (4) actual and proximate
causation of emotional distress.  Stoiber
(1980) 101 CA3d 903, 921.  In determining
whether a defendant’s conduct is outrageous, it is not enough that the
defendant acted with an intent which is tortious or even criminal, or that the
defendant intended to inflict emotional distress, or that the defendant’s
conduct has been characterized by malice, or a degree of aggravation which
would entitle the plaintiff to punitive damages for another tort.   McMahon
(2009) 176 CA4th 1502, 1517.  Liability
for intentional infliction of emotional distress lies only where the
defendant’s conduct is so outrageous and extreme so as to go beyond all
possible bounds of decency and which is intolerable in a civilized
community.  Id.; See also Hughes
(2009) 46 C4th 1035, 1050-1051; Christensen (1991) 54 C3d 868, 904-905.
 
The facts that Defendant’s management agent yelled at
Plaintiff; told Plaintiff that nothing would be done about the water-damaged
areas and black mold; and that someone allegedly entered Plaintiff’s unit
without permission when Plaintiff was not there and painted the walls are
insufficient to satisfy the type of outrageous conduct necessary to support a
claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress.  (Complaint ¶22).  Similarly, Plaintiff merely concludes that
Defendant was aware that the conduct would cause Plaintiff bodily injury and
severe emotional distress without any factual support.  (Complaint ¶50).
 
6th cause of action – Violation of Business
& Professions Code 17200, et seq.
 
California Business and Professions Code 17200 et seq.
targets "unfair competition," which is defined as "any unlawful,
unfair or fraudulent business act or practice. . . ." and "unfair,
deceptive, untrue, or misleading advertising. . . ." including any act
prohibited by Business and Professions Code Section 17500 et. seq.  The unfair competition law is intended to
include anything that can properly be called a business practice and that at
the same time is forbidden by law.  See
Cel-Tech Communications, Inc. (1999) 20 C4th 163, 180.  Any business practice that is unlawful in the
sense that it violates a specific statute may be enjoined under Business and
Professions Code 17203.  See Barquis
(1972) 7 C3d 94.
 
The Court finds that Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged
what the he claims constitutes a business practice, the rental of an
apartment.  (Complaint ¶63).  However, in the complaint and opposition to
the demurrer, Plaintiff seems to conflate unfair and unlawful conduct.  (Complaint ¶¶63-64).  While Plaintiff claims that Defendant’s
conduct was illegal, it is not clear which statutes Plaintiff claims Defendant
violated as the basis of this cause of action. 
In the general allegations of the complaint, Plaintiff references
“violations of the Civil Code, Health & Safety Code, California Code of
Regulations, the Los Angeles County Code and other statutes and regulations and
ordinances designed and intended to regulate the habitability, health and
safety of rental property.”  (Complaint
¶23).  In the 2nd and 3rd causes
of action, Plaintiff refers to Civil Code 1941, Civil Code 1941.1 and Health
& Safety Code 17920.3.  (Complaint
¶¶34, 44).  However, in the 6th
cause of action, Plaintiff does not cite any specific statute.  (See Complaint ¶¶63-68).  As such, it is not clear what unfair and/or
unlawful conduct forms the basis of this cause of action.  
 
CONCLUSION
 
The demurrer is sustained.  Due to the liberal policy of allowing leave
to amend and because this is only the original complaint, Plaintiff is given
the opportunity to try to cure the defects in the 4th and 6th
causes of action.  
 
Since the motion to strike seeks to strike the 4th
and 6th causes of action and the prayers for relief in relation to
those causes of action, it is placed off calendar as moot due to the ruling on
the demurrer.  
 
A First Amended Complaint is due to be filed and served
within 30 days.
