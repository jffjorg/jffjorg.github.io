And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The plaintiff, Ramiro Montoya, Jr., filed an action against the Saint Anthanasius Coptic Orthodox Church for various causes of action, including breach of implied warranty of habitability, tortious breach of implied warranty of habitability, negligence, intentional infliction of emotional distress, private nuisance, and violation of Business & Professions Code 17200, et seq.

The defendant filed a demurrer to the 4th and 6th causes of action, seeking to strike the 4th cause of action (intentional infliction of emotional distress) and the 6th cause of action (violation of Business & Professions Code 17200, et seq.).

The court found that the demurrer was sustained, with leave to amend the complaint within 30 days. The court also found that the motion to strike was moot due to its ruling on the demurrer.

The court ruled that the 4th cause of action (intentional infliction of emotional distress) failed to allege sufficient facts to state a claim, and that the 6th cause of action (violation of Business & Professions Code 17200, et seq.) lacked specificity regarding the alleged unfair business practices.
