Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge rules that Guidoni USA Inc.'s motion to quash service of summons is granted. Guidoni argues that the court lacks personal jurisdiction over it because there are insufficient contacts between Guidoni and the State of California to support any constitutional basis for jurisdiction. The court finds that Guidoni has not demonstrated sufficient contacts with California to establish personal jurisdiction over it. Specifically, Guidoni's one-time shipment of artificial stone products to the Port of Long Beach is not sufficient to establish continuous and systematic contacts with California, and Guidoni has not purposefully availed itself of California's benefits. The court also rejects Guidoni's argument that it has submitted to the jurisdiction of the court by filing answers in other cases. As a result, the court grants Guidoni's motion to quash service of summons.
