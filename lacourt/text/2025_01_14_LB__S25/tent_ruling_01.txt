  Case Number:  24LBCV01865    Hearing Date:   January 14, 2025    Dept:  S25 BackgroundOn September 3, 2024, Plaintiff filed a complaint against Defendants San Pedro Convalescent Home, Inc., Primex Consulting LLC, Celia Valdomar, Jose D. Valdomar Jr and Does 1 to 250, alleging causes of action for elder abuse, negligence, violations of Health & Safety Code, § 1430, subd. (b) and violations of the Consumer Legal Remedies Act. Plaintiff alleges severe injuries, such as a fractured right hip, among other injuries, due to Defendants’ neglect and failure to provide long-term custodial care as a skilled nursing facility. (Compl., ¶¶ 1-3, 25.)On December 11, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant motion to be relieved as counsel.Legal StandardAn attorney in an action may be changed at any time before or after judgment or final determination upon the order of the court, upon the application of either client or attorney, after notice from one to the other. (Code Civ. Proc., § 284, subd. (2)). California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362 requires:1. Notice of motion and motion to be directed to the client (made on the Notice of Motion and Motion to be Relieved as Counsel Civil form (MC-051));2. A declaration stating in general terms, and without compromising the confidentiality of the attorney client relationship, why a motion under CCP §284(2), is brought instead of filing a consent under CCP §284(1) (made on the Declaration in Support of Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel Civil form (MC-052));3. Service of the notice of motion and motion and declaration on all other parties who have appeared in the case; and4. The proposed order relieving counsel (prepared on the Order Granting Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel Civil form (MC-053)).The motion should be denied if withdrawal would prejudice the client. (Rules Prof. Conduct, Rule 3-700(A)(2); Weil & Brown, Cal. Prac. Guide: Civ. Pro. Before Trial, 9:385.2(2008); 1 Witkin Cal. Pro., Attorneys §72 (2008).) The motion should be denied if it will cause undue delay in the proceeding or cause injustice. (Mandell v. Superior Court, (1977) 67 Cal.App.3d 1, 4.) The determination whether to grant or deny an attorney’s motion to withdraw as counsel of record lies within the sound discretion of the trial court, having in mind whether such withdrawal might work an injustice in the handling of the case. (Lempert v. Superior Court (2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 1161, 1173.) A breakdown in the attorney-client relationship (or personality clash) is grounds for withdrawal. (Estate of Falco (1987) 188 Cal.App.3d 1004, 1014.) An attorney is not limited to withdrawing from a case for cause and may withdraw when withdrawal can be accomplished without undue prejudice to the client. (Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915.)Tentative RulingPlaintiff counsel’s notice of motion and motion to be relieved as counsel is made on the proper Judicial Council of California form MC-051. The notice of motion and motion complies with Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(a).

(Baladejo Decl., ¶ 2.) Further, the declaration is on the proper Judicial Council of California form MC-052. The declaration complies with Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(c).
