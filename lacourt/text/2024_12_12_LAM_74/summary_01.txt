And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for summary judgment filed by UNIVAR Solutions USA Inc. (Defendant) in the products liability claim brought by Habib et al. (Plaintiffs). The court grants Defendant's motion for summary adjudication of the fourth cause of action (fraudulent concealment) and punitive damages.

In support of its motion, Defendant argued that Plaintiffs do not have, and cannot reasonably obtain, evidence that Defendant knowingly concealed from Decedent (Habib) that one of Defendant's products poses a risk of kidney cancer. The court found that Plaintiffs' discovery responses do not demonstrate Defendant's intent to conceal a material fact, and that Plaintiffs' contention that Defendant knew about the cancer risk is speculative.

The court also granted Defendant's motion for summary adjudication of punitive damages, finding that Plaintiffs have not created a triable issue of material fact whether Defendant knew about and intentionally concealed a material fact from Decedent. The court concluded that Defendant has met its prima facie burden, and Plaintiffs have not provided additional evidence proving that Defendant had knowledge of the cancer risk in the relevant timeframe.

The court's tentative ruling will be reconsidered after a hearing on December 12, 2024.
