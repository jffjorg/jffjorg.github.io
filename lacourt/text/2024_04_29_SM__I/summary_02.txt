And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to vacate the default. The judge is inclined to grant the motion, citing the strong public policy favoring a trial on the merits. However, the court has some doubts about the delay in filing the motion, which has not been explained by the plaintiff. The court also notes that there is no answer included in the motion, as required by statute. The judge has decided to deny the application due to technical issues, but expresses a preference to grant the application and deem the complaint served today with an answer to be filed and served by Wednesday at 3:00 pm. The court will inquire about the technical issues and the notice of non-receipt of opposition filed by Hicks.
