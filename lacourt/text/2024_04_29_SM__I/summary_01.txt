The parties have submitted joint documents, including the Joint Statement of the Case, Joint Witness List, and Joint Exhibit List. The court has not received a jury questionnaire, deposition chart, or joint good faith estimate of trial length. Despite this, the court finds that the case is "READY FOR TRIAL" except for the deposition chart and good faith estimate. The trial is scheduled to begin on May 6, 2024, at 10:30 a.m. The parties are instructed to bring binders containing various documents to court on the first day of trial. The court plans to issue its motions in limine (MIL) rulings at the end of the hearing.
