 Case Number:  22SMCV02025    Hearing Date:   April 29, 2024    Dept:  I This is a motion to vacate the default.  On its regular merits, the court would be
inclined to grant the motion.  
 
There is an issue as to service.  The claim is that the service address is not
the correct address—it is not where defendant was or worked at the time
(according to the defense).  Accordingly,
the argument goes, there was no service and the default needs to be
vacated.  The opposition suggests that
the proof of service is enough to establish proper service and that the address
was in fact correct.  Given the court’s
strong public policy favoring a trial on the merits, the court would be
inclined to grant and allow a trial.  But
there are some problems.  First, there is
no answer included in the motion, as is required by the statute.  Second, defendant does not suggest a
potentially meritorious defense.  Third,
the default was entered in August 2023. 
The motion was filed in March 2024, about eight months after the default
was entered.  The court has some doubt as
to the delay, which plaintiff has not explained.  The court will inquire as to these
subjects.  The bottom line is that for
technical reasons, the court must DENY the application, but the court would
prefer to GRANT the application and deem the complaint served today with an
answer to be filed and served by Wednesday at 3:00 pm.
 
The court notes that Hicks has filed a notice of non-receipt
of opposition.  The court will inquire
about that, given that the court has received an opposition.
