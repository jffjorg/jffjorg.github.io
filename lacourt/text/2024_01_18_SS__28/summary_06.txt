The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of 22STCV16233, which involves a claim by D.M. (Claimant) against Michele Mendoza (Defendant) for injuries sustained during a physical education class. The Claimant was attempting to jump over hurdles and told the Defendant that she did not believe she could clear the hurdles, but the Defendant dismissed the statement. The Claimant fell and sustained injuries, including a sprained right ankle and a fractured left wrist. The Defendant allegedly mocked the Claimant's injuries.

The case is being handled as an expedited petition without a hearing, which is permitted under California Rules of Court, rule 7.950.5. The Petitioner, Aurora Figueroa Alvizo, has filed a petition requesting settlement of the case for $25,000.00. The judge has denied the petition without prejudice due to several errors in the petition and attachments. The errors include checking the wrong boxes, requesting access to funds without restriction, and stating the total amount to be paid or reimbursed incorrectly. The judge has ordered the Petitioner to revise the petition and attachments to correct these errors before the case can proceed.
