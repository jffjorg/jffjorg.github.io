BACKGROUND 
On

against Defendants Trevor Wilkerson, Brenden William Hester, Air Control Systems, Inc. (“Air Control”), North
Shore SVCS, Jaquelyn Bedoya, and Does 1-50 for negligence. 
On
December 14, 2023, Air Control filed an answer. 
On
December 21, 2023, the Court granted Air Control’s ex parte application to
continue the trial from March 1, 2024 to September 4, 2024.  The Court denied without prejudice Air

On

expert discovery cutoff dates, to be heard on January 18, 2024.  No party has filed an opposition. 
Trial
is currently scheduled for September 4, 2024. 
PARTY’S REQUEST 
Air
Control requests that the Court extend the discovery and expert discovery cutoff
dates to match the current trial date. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2024.020 provides: 
“(a) Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, any
party shall be entitled as a matter of right to complete discovery proceedings
on or before the 30th day, and to have motions concerning discovery heard on or
before the 15th day, before the date initially set for the trial of the action. 
“(b) Except as provided in Section 2024.050, a
continuance or postponement of the trial date does not operate to reopen
discovery proceedings.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., §
2024.020.) 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2024.050 provides: 
“(a) On motion of any party, the court may grant leave
to complete discovery proceedings, or to have a motion concerning discovery
heard, closer to the initial trial date, or to reopen discovery after a new
trial date has been set. This motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer
declaration under Section 2016.040. 
“(b) In exercising its discretion to grant or deny
this motion, the court shall take into consideration any matter relevant to the
leave requested, including, but not limited to, the following: 
“(1) The necessity and the reasons for the discovery. 
“(2) The diligence or lack of diligence of the party
seeking the discovery or the hearing of a discovery motion, and the reasons
that the discovery was not completed or that the discovery motion was not heard
earlier. 
“(3) Any likelihood that permitting the discovery or
hearing the discovery motion will prevent the case from going to trial on the
date set, or otherwise interfere with the trial calendar, or result in
prejudice to any other party. 
“(4) The length of time that has elapsed between any
date previously set, and the date presently set, for the trial of the action. 
 “(c) The court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to extend or to reopen
discovery, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., §
2024.050.) 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2016.040 provides: “A meet and confer declaration in
support of a motion shall state facts showing a reasonable and good faith
attempt at an informal resolution of each issue presented by the motion.”
