 Case Number:  20STCV11720    Hearing Date:   January 18, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
considered the documents submitted in support of a default judgment, the Court
rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On
March 24, 2020, Plaintiff Arthur Brunston (“Plaintiff”) filed this action
against Defendants Silver Lake Medical Center (“SLMC”), LA Downtown Medical
Center, LLC (“LADMC”), and Does 1-50 for premises liability. 
On
January 20, 2021, Plaintiff filed a proof of service showing substituted
service of the summons, complaint, and other documents on SLMC on January 6,
2021. 
On
July 27, 2021, Plaintiff filed a proof of service showing substituted service
of the summons, complaint, statement of damages, and other documents on SLMC on
July 21, 2021. 
On
November 15, 2021, the clerk entered SLMC’s default. 
On
March 11, 2022, the Court dismissed LADMC without prejudice at Plaintiff’s
request. 
On
June 2, 2022, the Court dismissed the Doe defendants with prejudice at
Plaintiff’s request. 
On
October 25, 2022, the Court dismissed the action without prejudice. On June 27,
2023, the Court granted Plaintiff’s motion to vacate the dismissal. 
On December 11, 2023, Plaintiff filed a request for Court
judgment, to be heard on January 18, 2024. 
PARTY’S REQUEST 
Plaintiff
requests that the Court enter a default judgment against SLMC and award
Plaintiff $222,125.67, consisting of $200,000.00 in general damages, $20,378.89
in special damages, and $1,746.78 in attorney’s fees (or costs). 
LEGAL STANDARD 
“[With exceptions that do not apply here,] [a] party
seeking a default judgment on declarations must use mandatory Request for Entry
of Default (Application to Enter Default) (form CIV-100) . . . The following
must be included in the documents filed with the clerk: 
“(1)  Except in
unlawful detainer cases, a brief summary of the case identifying the parties and
the nature of plaintiff's claim; 
“(2) 
Declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment
requested; 
“(3)  Interest
computations as necessary; 
“(4)  A
memorandum of costs and disbursements; 
“(5)  A
declaration of nonmilitary status for each defendant against whom judgment is
sought; 
“(6)  A proposed
form of judgment; 
“(7)  A
dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application
for separate judgment against specified parties under Code of Civil Procedure
section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; 
“(8)  Exhibits
as necessary; and 
“(9)  A request
for attorney fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.” 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1800(a).) 
          “Where a cause of action is stated in the complaint,
plaintiff merely needs to introduce evidence establishing a prima facie case
for damages.”  (L. Edmon & C. Karnow,
Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶ 5:213.1, p. 5-56 (Cal. Practice Guide), citing Johnson
v. Stanhiser (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 357, 361 [trial court erred in applying
preponderance of the evidence standard].) 
          The relief granted to a plaintiff upon entry of a
defendant's default cannot exceed the amount demanded in the complaint or, for
personal injury cases where damages may not be stated in the complaint, the
amount listed in the statement of damages. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 580, subd. (a),
585, subd. (b).) “The notice requirement of section 580 was designed to insure
fundamental fairness.” (Becker v. S.P.V. Construction Co. (1980) 27
Cal.3d 489, 494 (Becker).) The statute insures that “defendants in cases
which involve a default judgment have adequate notice of the judgments that may
be taken against them. [Citation.] ‘If a judgment other than that which is
demanded is taken against him, [the defendant] has been deprived of his day in
court—a right to a hearing on the matter adjudicated.’ ’’ (Id. at p.
493.) A trial court exceeds its jurisdiction if it awards damages in excess of
the amount specified in the complaint or statement of damages. (Id. at
p. 494; see Cal. Practice Guide, supra, ¶ 5:258,
p. 5-70.) 
DISCUSSION 
Plaintiff’s
CIV-100 form does not request an award of costs but requests $1,746.78 in
attorney’s fees.  Plaintiff’s JUD-100
form requests $1,746.78 in costs but does not request attorney’s fees.  One or both of the forms should be revised to
make them consistent. 
The
Court denies the motion without prejudice. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES Plaintiff Arthur Brunston’s application for default judgment filed
on December 11, 2023 without prejudice. 
Plaintiff
is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
