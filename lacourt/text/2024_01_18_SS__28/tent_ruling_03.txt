PETITIONER’S REQUEST 
Petitioner
Jose Tomas Aviles asks the Court to approve the compromise of the pending
action of Katherine Aviles. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
The
parties to a lawsuit may settle a minor’s claim or the claim of a person who
lacks the capacity to make decisions only with court approval.  (Prob. Code., §§ 2504, 3500, 3600 et seq.;
Code Civ. Proc., § 372; see Pearson v. Superior Court (2012) 202
Cal.App.4th 1333, 1337.) 
A
petition for court approval of a compromise or covenant not to sue under Code
of Civil Procedure section 372 must comply with California Rules of Court,
rules 7.950, 7.951 and 7.952. The petition must be verified by the petitioner
and contain a full disclosure of all information that has “any bearing upon the
reasonableness” of the compromise or the covenant. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
7.950.) 
The
person compromising the claim on behalf of the minor or person who lacks
capacity, and the represented person, must attend the hearing on compromise of
the claim unless the court for good cause dispenses with their personal
appearance. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.952.) 
DISCUSSION 
Petitioner
has submitted a completed petition with all applicable attachments. 
Counsel requests an attorney’s fee award of $3,333.00, which is 33 percent of the
$10,000.00 gross settlement amount. 
Counsel reduced the fee from 45 percent in the best
interests of the minor. 
California
Rules of Court, rule 7.955, “requires a trial court, in determining reasonable
attorney fees, to balance an attorney's interest in fair compensation with the
protection of the interests of a minor client. Thus, a trial court ‘must give
consideration to the terms of any representation agreement made between the
attorney and the representative of the minor or person with a disability and
must evaluate the agreement based on the facts and circumstances existing at
the time the agreement was made.’ ” (Schulz v. Jeppesen Sanderson, Inc.
(2018) 27 Cal.App.5th 1167, 1176-1177 (Schultz), quoting Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 7.955(a)(2).) 
The
Court has considered the factors listed in rule 7.955 and concludes that an
attorney’s fee award of 30 percent is reasonable in this case.  (See Schultz, supra, 27
Cal.App.5th at p. 1175 [“Even if there is no benchmark starting point for
attorney fees in cases under California Rules of Court, rule 7.955, a court may
of course reasonably determine that 25 percent is an appropriate percentage in
a given case”].) 
Therefore,
the attorney’s fee award will be $3,000.00, which is 30 percent of the gross
settlement amount.  The net settlement
amount for Claimant is $3,375.14. 
The
Court approves the petition as modified. 
Petitioner
requests that the net balance be paid to Jose Tomas Aviles at 3926 Ingraham
Street, Unit #6, Los Angeles, CA 90005. The Court orders the net balance so
distributed. 
CONCLUSION 
          The Court GRANTS the petition to approve the compromise of
Plaintiff Katherine Aviles’s action filed by Petitioner Jose Tomas Aviles.  The Court orders the net balance of $3,375.14
be paid to Petitioner Jose Tomas Aviles. 
          The Court sets an OSC Re: Distribution of Net Settlement on
March 18, 2024, at 8:30 a.m., in Department 28 of the Spring Street Courthouse. 
The
Court sets an OSC Re: Dismissal of Case (Settlement) on March 18, 2024, at 8:30
a.m., in Department 28 of the Spring Street Courthouse. 
Petitioner
is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Petitioner
is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court within
five days.
