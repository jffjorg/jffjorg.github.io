 Case Number:  22STCV16233    Hearing Date:   January 18, 2024    Dept:  28 Claimant
D.M. (“Claimant”) was injured while attempting to jump over hurdles in physical
education class under the supervision of Defendant Michele Mendoza
(“Defendant”). Claimant had told Defendant that she did not believe she could
clear the hurdles but Defendant dismissed Claimant’s statement.  Plaintiff fell, sprained her right ankle, and
fractured her left wrist.  Defendant allegedly
mocked Plaintiff’s injuries. 
This
is an expedited petition without a hearing, which is permitted under California
Rules of Court, rule 7.950.5, if Petitioner Aurora Figueroa Alvizo
(“Petitioner”) uses the required Judicial Council forms and meets certain
conditions. The conditions are: 
1.
Petitioner is represented by an attorney. 
2.
The claim is not for wrongful death. 
3.
Settlement proceeds will not be placed in a trust. 
4.
There are no unresolved liens. 
5.
Petitioner’s attorney did not become involved at the request of Defendant or
the insurance carrier. 
6.
Petitioner’s attorney is not employed by or associated with a Defendant or
insurance carrier in connection with the petition. 
7.
If an action is filed, all Defendants have appeared and are participating in
the compromise OR the court has determined that the settlement is in good
faith. 
8.
The settlement, exclusive of interests and costs, is $50,000 or less OR if
greater than $50,000, the amount payable is the insurance policy limits AND all
proposed contributing parties would be substantially unable to use assets other
than the insurance policy limits AND the court does not otherwise order. 
SETTLEMENT:
$25,000.00 
INJURIES:
Right ankle sprain, left wrist fracture, emotional distress 
MEDICAL
EXPENSES: $13,482.39 
COSTS:
$1,078.52 
ATTORNEY’S
FEES: $5,000.00 
BALANCE
OF PROCEEDS: $5,439.09 
DISCUSSION: 
Petitioner
has checked the boxes for both Section 13c(1) and 13c(2).  It appears that only the box for Section 13c(2)
should be checked. 
In
Section 20, Petitioner requests that “Petitioner to have full access to funds
without restriction upon reaching the age of majority, on May 9, 2025.”  The petition should be revised if Claimant is
the person who should have access to the finds on reaching the age of majority. 
In Section
13a(4) of the petition, Petitioner states that medical expenses to be paid or
reimbursed total $13,482.39.  However, the
petition and attachments also state that $13,482.39 is the amount to be paid to
Plaintiff’s medical providers and $507.39 is the amount to be paid to Medi-Cal.
The total amount to be paid or reimbursed stated in Section 13a(4) does not
account for both amounts. 
Petitioner
should revise the response to Section 13a(5), which asks for the
“total amount of statutory or contractual liens.”  The application identifies liens from medical providers and Medi-Cal. 
The
Court denies the petition without prejudice.
