And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the Plaintiff's request for default judgment against Silver Lake Medical Center (SLMC) is denied without prejudice. The Plaintiff had filed a complaint against SLMC, LA Downtown Medical Center, LLC, and Does 1-50 for premises liability, and had obtained substituted service of the summons and complaint on SLMC. SLMC failed to respond, and the clerk entered a default against them. The Plaintiff then filed a request for default judgment, seeking damages of $222,125.67, including $200,000.00 in general damages, $20,378.89 in special damages, and $1,746.78 in attorney's fees.

The Judge notes that the Plaintiff's CIV-100 and JUD-100 forms do not request an award of costs, and that one or both of the forms should be revised to make them consistent. The Judge also cites California law and case law, including Johnson v. Stanhiser and Becker v. S.P.V. Construction Co., which provide that a trial court cannot award damages in excess of the amount specified in the complaint or statement of damages, and that the notice requirement of Section 580 of the California Code of Civil Procedure is designed to insure fundamental fairness.
