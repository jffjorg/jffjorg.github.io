The court also finds that plaintiff's motion for reconsideration is timely and that the court has the discretion to reconsider its prior order. The court sets aside its prior order compelling arbitration and denies defendant's motion to compel arbitration.

## Tentative Ruling Summary: 

**Case:** 22AHCV00459,  Catherine Amores Castillo v. Nissan North America, Inc. et al.

**Hearing Date:** September 21, 2023

**Court:** Superior Court of the State of California, County of Los Angeles - Northeast District

**Plaintiff:** Catherine Amores Castillo

**Defendant:** Nissan North America, Inc. and Wish Automotive III, Inc. dba Nissan of Alhambra

**Issue:**  Whether the Court should reconsider its prior order compelling arbitration.

**Background:**

* Plaintiff filed a lawsuit against Defendant Nissan North America, Inc. for violation of the Song-Beverly Act and fraudulent inducement related to a defective emergency braking system in her 2020 Nissan Pathfinder. 
* Defendant Nissan moved to compel arbitration based on a provision in the sales contract between Plaintiff and the dealership (Nissan of Alhambra) which stated that any disputes would be subject to arbitration.
* The Court initially granted the motion to compel arbitration, relying on the case of Felisilda v. FCA US LLC (2020). 
* Plaintiff filed a motion for reconsideration after the case of Ochoa v. Ford Motor Warranty Cases (2023) was decided, which disagreed with Felisilda. 

**Key Arguments:**

* **Plaintiff:** 
    * Ochoa established a new legal precedent that undermines the Court's prior ruling.
    * Equitable estoppel doesn't apply because the sales contract doesn't expressly benefit Defendant.
    * Defendant hasn't shown it's a third-party beneficiary of the contract.
* **Defendant:**
    * Motion is untimely.
    * Court lost jurisdiction after ordering arbitration.
    * Ochoa doesn't change the law significantly.

**Court's Ruling:**

* **Motion for Reconsideration GRANTED.**
* Prior order compelling arbitration VACATED.
* Defendant's motion to compel arbitration DENIED.
* Trial setting conference scheduled for a future date.

**Reasoning:**

* The Court finds Ochoa, Montemayor, and Kielar more persuasive than Felisilda. These recent cases reject the application of equitable estoppel and third-party beneficiary status in similar situations.
* The sales contract doesn't demonstrate Defendant's intention to benefit from the arbitration provision.


**Key Law:**

* Code of Civil Procedure section 1008 (motion for reconsideration)
* Civil Code section 1559 (third-party beneficiary contracts)
* Felisilda v. FCA US LLC (2020) 53 Cal.App.5th 486 
* Ochoa v. Ford Motor Warranty Cases (2023) 89 Cal.App.5th 1324
* Montemayor v. Ford Motor Company (2023) 92 Cal.App.5th 958
* Kielar v. Superior Court (2023) 94 Cal.App.5th 614

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting plaintiff Catherine Amores Castillo's motion for reconsideration of the court's prior order compelling arbitration. The court found that it has jurisdiction to reconsider its order and that recent changes in case law warrant revocation of the prior order.

The court held that defendant Nissan North America, Inc. may not compel arbitration under the theory of equitable estoppel or as a third-party beneficiary. The court found that the sales contract between plaintiff and Nissan of Alhambra did not intend to benefit defendant and that permitting defendant to bring its own breach of contract action against the contracting parties is not consistent with the objectives of the contract.

The court also found that the plaintiff's claims are not arbitrable because they are not related to the sales contract and that the defendant has not established that it can enforce the contract as a third-party beneficiary. The court vacates its prior order compelling arbitration and denies defendant's motion to compel arbitration.

English text:
The tentative ruling is for a case in the Superior Court of the State of California, Northeast District, Department 3. The case number is 22AHCV00459 and the hearing date is September 21, 2023. The plaintiff, Catherine Amores Castillo, filed a complaint against the defendants, Nissan North America, Inc. and Wish Automotive III, Inc. dba Nissan of Alhambra. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant, Nissan North America, Inc., violated the Song-Beverly Act and committed fraudulent inducement related to a defective emergency braking system in a 2020 Nissan Pathfinder purchased on March 24, 2021. The plaintiff also alleges that the defendant, Wish Automotive III, Inc. dba Nissan of Alhambra, was negligent in repairing the vehicle.
On March 6, 2023, the court granted the defendant, Nissan North America, Inc.'s, motion to compel arbitration. On June 6, 2023, the plaintiff filed a motion for reconsideration of the prior court order. The plaintiff argues that she is not limited to the statutory time limitations of Civil Procedure section 1008 because her motion is based on a change in law and the court can reconsider its rulings on its own motion.
The defendant argues that the motion is untimely because it was made more than 10 days after the court ordered this matter to arbitration. The defendant also argues that once the court ordered the matter to arbitration, it lost jurisdiction. The defendant additionally argues that the new case law cited by the plaintiff, Ford Motor Warranty Cases (2023) 89 Cal.App.5th 1324, is not a material or controlling change in law because it merely disagreed with the previous case law, Felisilda v. FCA US LLC (2020) 53 Cal.App.5th 486, which the defendant argues is the better-reasoned decision.
The court has determined that it has jurisdiction to rule on this motion and that there is new law that warrants revocation of the court's prior order. The court has vacated its prior order granting the defendant's motion to compel arbitration and has issued an order denying the defendant's motion. The court has also scheduled a trial setting conference.

## Tentative Ruling Summary: 

**Case Number:** 22AHCV00459
**Plaintiff:** Catherine Amores Castillo
**Defendant:** Nissan North America, Inc., and Wish Automotive III, Inc. dba Nissan of Alhambra
**Date:** September 21, 2023

**Subject:** Plaintiff's Motion for Reconsideration of Prior Court Order Granting Defendant's Motion to Compel Arbitration

**Summary:**

The judge is granting the Plaintiff's motion to reconsider the prior order compelling arbitration. 

**Reasons for Reconsideration:**

* **New Law:** The judge cites three recent appellate court decisions (Ochoa, Montemayor, and Kielar) that have rejected the legal precedent set by Felisilda, which the court previously relied on to compel arbitration. These decisions hold that equitable estoppel and third-party beneficiary arguments are not valid reasons to compel arbitration in cases involving consumer disputes and manufacturer warranties when the arbitration clause is in a sales contract with a dealership. 

* **Lack of Prejudice:** The judge found no evidence that the Defendant would be significantly prejudiced by vacating the prior order compelling arbitration.

* **Limited Arbitration Proceedings:** The judge noted that the arbitration proceedings, though initiated, are in their early stages.


**Actions:**

* The court vacates its prior order compelling arbitration.
* The court denies Defendant's motion to compel arbitration.
* The court schedules a trial setting conference.

**Key Points:**

* The judge emphasizes the importance of recent case law developments in shaping their decision.
* The judge highlights the distinction between the subject matter of arbitrable claims and the parties authorized to elect arbitration.
* The judge considers the potential prejudice to the Defendant when deciding to vacate the prior order.

The Court has also found that the recent changes in case law warrant revocation of the order compelling arbitration.

**Summary:**

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the Plaintiff's motion for reconsideration of the Court's order compelling arbitration. The Court has reconsidered its decision based on new case law in Ochoa v. Ford Motor Co. and Montemayor v. Ford Motor Co., which reject the theory of equitable estoppel and third-party beneficiary in the context of arbitration agreements. The Court finds that the Defendant may not compel arbitration under the theory of equitable estoppel or as a third-party beneficiary and grants the Plaintiff's motion to deny the Defendant's motion to compel arbitration.
