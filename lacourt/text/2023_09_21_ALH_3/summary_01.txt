And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motion for reconsideration of the court's order compelling arbitration. The court finds that the recent changes in case law, including decisions in Ochoa, Montemayor, and Kielar, warrant reconsideration of the order. The court concludes that defendant may not compel arbitration under the theory of equitable estoppel or as a third-party beneficiary. The court also finds that plaintiff's motion for reconsideration is timely and that the court has the discretion to reconsider its prior order. The court sets aside its prior order compelling arbitration and denies defendant's motion to compel arbitration.
