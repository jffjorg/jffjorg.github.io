And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by the defendant, Kee Zhang, seeking leave to conduct a second physical examination and a mental examination of the plaintiff, Catherine Garcia. The plaintiff has already undergone a previous medical examination with a hand surgeon, Dr. Nicholas Rose, but the defendant argues that another examination with a neurosurgeon, Dr. Paul Kaloostian, is necessary because Dr. Rose only assessed the plaintiff's claims regarding her right wrist and hand, whereas Dr. Kaloostian would examine her lower back.

The judge grants the motion for the physical examination but strikes the reference to a "mental status exam" in the demand for defense medical examination because it appears to exceed Dr. Kaloostian's specialty. The judge denies the motion for the mental examination because the plaintiff has waived her claims for psychological distress beyond customary pain and suffering.

The judge also denies the plaintiff's request for sanctions. The parties who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the court indicating their intention to submit as directed by the instructions provided on the court website.
