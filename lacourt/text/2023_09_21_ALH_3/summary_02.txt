And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by the defendant, Kee Zhang, seeking leave to conduct a second physical examination and a mental examination of the plaintiff, Catherine Garcia. The plaintiff has already undergone a previous medical examination with a hand surgeon, Dr. Nicholas Rose, but the defendant argues that another examination with a neurosurgeon, Dr. Paul Kaloostian, is necessary because Dr. Rose only assessed the plaintiff's claims regarding her right wrist and hand, whereas Dr. Kaloostian would examine her lower back.

The judge grants the motion for the physical examination but strikes the reference to a "mental status exam" in the demand for defense medical examination because it appears to exceed Dr. Kaloostian's specialty. The judge denies the motion for the mental examination because the plaintiff has waived her claims for psychological distress beyond customary pain and suffering.

The judge also denies the plaintiff's request for sanctions. The parties who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the court indicating their intention to submit as directed by the instructions provided on the court website.

**English Summary:**

In this case, the judge is considering a motion by the defendant (Mr. Zhang) to conduct a second physical examination of the plaintiff (Ms. Garcia).  

The defendant argues that a second examination by a neurosurgeon is necessary because Ms. Garcia has reported experiencing lower back pain and is a candidate for surgery. The defendant points out that the plaintiff's previous physical examination was by a hand surgeon.

While Ms. Garcia acknowledges lower back pain, she argues that the previous examination was sufficient and that a second one is unnecessary. 

The judge ultimately grants the motion for a second physical examination, but limits the scope to exclude a mental examination. This is because the plaintiff has agreed to waive her claims for psychological distress beyond pain and suffering, making a mental examination unnecessary.

And here is the summary in plain English:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by the defendant, Kee Zhang, to conduct a second physical examination and a mental examination of the plaintiff, Catherine Garcia. The motion was filed on August 25, 2023, and the plaintiff opposed it on September 8, 2023. The defendant argues that the examination is necessary because the plaintiff has undergone an epidural injection in her lower back and has been recommended for low back surgery. The plaintiff argues that the examination is not necessary because she has already been examined by a hand surgeon, Dr. Nicholas Rose, and that the defendant's requested examination is too broad.

The judge grants the defendant's motion for a second physical examination with Dr. Paul Kaloostian, a neurosurgeon, but limits the scope of the examination to Dr. Kaloostian's specialty. The judge denies the defendant's motion for a mental examination because the plaintiff has waived her claims for psychological distress beyond customary pain and suffering.

The judge also denies the plaintiff's request for sanctions. The hearing is scheduled for September 21, 2023, and parties who intend to submit on the tentative must send an email to the court indicating their intention to do so.
