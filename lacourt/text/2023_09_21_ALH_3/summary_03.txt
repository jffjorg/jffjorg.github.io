And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a petition to confirm an arbitration award made on July 12, 2023, in which Forward Financing LLC is seeking to enter judgment against Mass Exclusive LLC and Felix Parker for a total of $167,223.95. The respondents are jointly and severally liable for this amount, which includes damages, costs, and administrative fees. However, the judge notes that the only proof of service on file is a document showing that Felix Parker was personally served as an individual defendant, and it does not appear that the petition has been served on Mass Exclusive. Therefore, the judge is continuing the hearing to allow for proper service of the petition to be effectuated.
