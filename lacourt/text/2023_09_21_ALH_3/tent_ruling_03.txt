[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE: PETITION TO CONFIRM ARBITRATION AWARD 
 
Dept.

  a.m.

          Petitioner
Forward Financing LLC requests the Court confirm an arbitration award made on
July 12, 2023 and enter judgment against respondents Mass Exclusive LLC dba
Mass Exclusive (“Mass Exclusive”) and Felix Parker (“Parker”) (collectively,
“Respondents”).  Respondents are jointly
and severally liable to pay a total of $167,223.95, consisting of $164,640 in
damages, $183.95 in costs, and $5,300 in administrative fees. 
If a petition or response requesting
confirmation is duly filed and served, the court must confirm the award as
made, unless it corrects or vacates the award or dismisses the proceeding.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1286; see Horn v.
Gurewitz (1968) 261 Cal.App.2d 255, 258; Pacific Law Group: U.S.A. v.
Gibson (1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 577, 580.) 
A party seeking confirmation of an arbitration award must provide at
least 10 days’ notice to all parties of the hearing date on the petition
seeking to confirm the arbitration award. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1290.2 [“[a] petition under this title shall be
heard in a summary way in the manner and upon the notice provided by law for
the making and hearing of motions, except that not less than 10 days’ notice of
the date set for the hearing on the petition shall be given”].)  Further, a party seeking confirmation of an
arbitration award must serve and file the petition seeking confirmation at
least 10 days, but not later than 4 years, after the date of service of the
arbitration award upon him or her.  (Id.,
§§ 1288, 1288.4.) Upon service and filing of a petition to confirm arbitration
award, the court shall confirm the award as made, unless it corrects or vacates
the award, or dismisses the proceeding. (Id., § 1286.) The contents of a
petition to confirm an arbitration award shall set forth the substance of or
have attached a copy of the agreement to arbitrate, the names of the
arbitrators, and shall set forth or have attached a copy of the award and the
written opinion of the arbitrators. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1285.4.) 
It
does not appear that Petitioner has served Mass Exclusive with the petition or
notice of hearing.  The only proof of
service on file is one which shows that Parker was personally served as an
individual defendant.  
Accordingly,
the hearing on this petition is CONTINUED to _________ at 8:30 a.m. in
Department 3 so that proper service of the petition may be effectuated. 
 
 
Dated
this 21st
day of September, 2023
