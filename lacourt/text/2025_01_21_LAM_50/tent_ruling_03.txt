[TENTATIVE] ORDER
  RE:  
 
PLAINTIFF’S REQUEST FOR DEFAULT JUDGMENT
 




            
Plaintiff
Suny Khurana (“Plaintiff”) requests entry of default judgment against Defendants
E.A. Guzman Plastering, Inc. and Elias Alejandro Guzman Garcia. Plaintiff seeks
judgment in the total amount of $426,717.34, comprising $380,315.00 in damages,
$45,669.34 in interest, and $733.00 in costs. 
The
Court notes a few defects with the submitted default judgment package.
First,
Plaintiff seeks damages in the amount of $380,315.00. However, the Declaration
of Suny Khurana in support of the request only appears to substantiate damages
in the total amount of $355,315.00. (See Khurana Decl., ¶¶ 3-4, 7.) It
is unclear how Plaintiff arrived at the requested amount of $380,315.00 in
damages. 
Second,
Plaintiff appears to seek interest on the principal amount of $165,315.00.
(Khurana Decl., ¶ 8, Ex. E.) It is unclear why Plaintiff seeks interest on this
amount, or how Plaintiff arrived at such figure. 
 
Based
on the foregoing, the Court denies Plaintiff’s request for default judgment
without prejudice. The Court will discuss further proceedings with Plaintiff at
the hearing.
