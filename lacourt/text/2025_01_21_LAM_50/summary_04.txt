Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has denied Plaintiff Matthew Sorensen's motion for a preliminary injunction against Defendant Pacific Sunwear of California, LLC. The Plaintiff alleges that the Defendant uses a "trap and trace device" called TikTok Software on its website to collect data on visitors without their consent, in violation of California Penal Code section 638.51. The Court has sustained several of the Defendant's evidentiary objections to the Plaintiff's declarations and expert reports, and has found that the Plaintiff has not demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of his claim.

The Court has also found that the Plaintiff has not demonstrated that he will suffer irreparable harm or interim harm if an injunction is not issued pending an adjudication of the merits. The Court notes that the Plaintiff's declaration in support of the motion does not provide any evidence to support his assertions of interim harm, and that the Plaintiff's claim is based on a non-binding federal district court case.

The Court has ordered the Defendant to provide notice of this ruling.
