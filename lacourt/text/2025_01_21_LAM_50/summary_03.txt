And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a request for default judgment filed by plaintiff Suny Khurana against defendants E.A. Guzman Plastering, Inc. and Elias Alejandro Guzman Garcia. The plaintiff seeks a judgment in the amount of $426,717.34, comprising $380,315.00 in damages, $45,669.34 in interest, and $733.00 in costs. However, the court notes that the submitted default judgment package has several defects. Specifically, the plaintiff's Declaration only substantiates damages in the amount of $355,315.00, and it is unclear how the plaintiff arrived at the requested amount of $380,315.00 in damages. Additionally, the plaintiff appears to seek interest on a principal amount of $165,315.00, but it is unclear why or how the plaintiff calculated this figure. As a result, the court denies the plaintiff's request for default judgment without prejudice and will discuss further proceedings with the plaintiff at the hearing.
