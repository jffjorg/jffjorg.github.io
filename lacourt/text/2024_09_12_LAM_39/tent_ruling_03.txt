Motion to Quash Subpoena

Defendant Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.



 
MOTION
              Plaintiff
Jane Doe (“Plaintiff”) moves for a protective order to quash the subpoena Defendant
Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (“Defendant”) served on Deponent Angela Aiello
(“Deponent”).  Defendant opposes the
motion.
ANALYSIS
If a subpoena requires deposition testimony
or the production of documents, the Court may quash the subpoena entirely or
modify it.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1987.1,
subd. (a).)  In ruling on a motion to
quash, “the court may in its discretion award the amount of the reasonable
expenses incurred in making or opposing the motion, including reasonable
attorney's fees, if the court finds the motion was made or opposed in bad faith
or without substantial justification or that one or more of the requirements of
the subpoena was oppressive.”  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1987.2, subd. (a).) 
Plaintiff contends, while she worked for
Defendant, her co-worker Eric Pagel (“Pagel”) sexually harassed and assaulted her.
 Defendant served a subpoena on Deponent,
in which Defendant seeks to depose Deponent and asks Deponent to produce documents.  Plaintiff has a right to privacy in “various
private or sensitive information regarding [her] personal life . . . .”  (Hooser v. Superior Court (2000) 84
Cal.App.4th 997, 1003-1004.)  This
includes Plaintiff’s friendship with Deponent. 
Accordingly, the Court cannot order disclosure of information regarding Plaintiff’s
friendship with Deponent unless it is directly relevant to this litigation.  (See Britt v. Superior Court (1978) 20
Cal.3d 844, 855-856.)  
However, Deponent is a percipient witness in
this action, as Plaintiff has indicated she had dinner with Deponent on the
night after the alleged assault.  Plaintiff
also testified she texted Pagel photographs of Plaintiff and Deponent.  Defendant is entitled to undertake discovery
of such matters as Deponent’s observations of Plaintiff during the period
immediately after the alleged assault, as Plaintiff testified she was
distraught.  Plaintiff also testified she
told Deponent about having been assaulted by Pagel.  Defendant is, therefore, entitled to discovery
concerning what Plaintiff told Deponent. 
Finally, Plaintiff testified she told her husband about Pagel’s alleged
assault at a dinner party at Deponent’s home. 
(See Opposition, pp. 4-5.)  Accordingly,
Defendant is entitled to depose Deponent in that regard.  
The motion to quash is denied.  However, the Court concludes Defendant’s
subpoena to Deponent is overbroad.  The
entirety of Plaintiff’s communication history between Plaintiff and Deponent
and Deponent and Plaintiff’s husband is not pertinent to this action.  Accordingly, the Court limits the subpoena
for production of documents to communications between Deponent and Plaintiff
and Deponent and Plaintiff’s husband from: (1) January 14 to April 30, 2020;
(2) May 22 to June 30, 2020; (3) August 6, 2020 to December 31, 2021; (4)
January 1 to July 5, 2023; (5) October 1 to November 1, 2023; and (6) January
1, 2024 to the present.  Defendant
indicates it is amenable to these limitations. 
(Opposition, pp. 8-9.)
Plaintiff is to give notice of this
order and to file proof of service of same.
