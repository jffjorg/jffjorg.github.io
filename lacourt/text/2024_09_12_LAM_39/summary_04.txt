And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to strike portions of the first amended complaint filed by Plaintiffs Donna Bolden, Loretta Hartfield, Jane Burton, and others against Defendants New Pershing Apartments, L.P. and SRHT Property Management Company. The Plaintiffs alleged various habitability violations in their rental units, including inadequate weather protection, internal water leaks, and vermin infestation, and sought punitive damages for the Defendants' alleged oppressive, fraudulent, and malicious conduct.

The judge granted the Defendants' motion to strike the prayer for punitive damages, finding that the Plaintiffs failed to allege specific facts to support their claims. However, the judge denied the motion to strike the allegations related to events that happened after the property entered court-ordered receivership, as the Court cannot determine whether the Defendants had control over the property at a given point without considering extrinsic evidence.

The judge gave the Plaintiffs an opportunity to amend their complaint to cure the defects in their punitive damages allegations and ordered them to file an amended complaint within 10 days of receiving the order.
