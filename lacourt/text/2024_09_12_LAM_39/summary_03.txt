And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge rules that the motion to quash the subpoena is denied, but limits the scope of the subpoena. The plaintiff, Jane Doe, had requested to quash the subpoena on the grounds that it was overly broad and sought information that was not relevant to the case. The defendant, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., sought to depose a witness, Angela Aiello, and obtain documents related to the plaintiff's friendship with her. The judge concludes that the defendant is entitled to discover information about the plaintiff's interactions with Aiello, including what the plaintiff told Aiello about the alleged assault and what Aiello observed about the plaintiff's behavior after the alleged assault. However, the judge limits the scope of the subpoena to specific time periods and communications between the plaintiff and Aiello, as well as between the plaintiff and the plaintiff's husband. The defendant has agreed to these limitations.
