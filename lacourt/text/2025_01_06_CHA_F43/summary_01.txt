And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion to compel further responsive documents filed by the defendants, Hernan Preciado Corona and Maria Corona. The defendants had requested that the plaintiff, Evelio Cardona Marroquin, provide proof of insurance for the date of the alleged vehicle collision. Marroquin had only provided a copy of his auto insurance policy, which was effective from March 21, 2021 to June 3, 2021, but did not cover the date of the accident. The judge finds that Marroquin has not fully complied with the request and orders him to serve a further verified response and produce further documents showing whether Marroquin's vehicle was or was not insured during the alleged incident.

In addition, the judge has awarded sanctions in the amount of $1,585.00 to the defendants, which includes $585.00 for the defendants' attorney fees and $1,000.00 for the defendants' failure to confer in good faith with Marroquin's counsel. The judge has also ordered Marroquin to pay the sanctions within 20 days of the date of the order.

The judge has also ordered Marroquin to serve responsive documents within 45 days of the date of the order. The defendants are ordered to give notice of the order.
