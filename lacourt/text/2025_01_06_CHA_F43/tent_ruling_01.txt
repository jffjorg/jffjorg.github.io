MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TO DEFENDANT’S
DEMAND FOR PRODUCTION AND INSPECTION OF DOCUMENTS, SET ONE
 
MOVING
PARTIES: Defendants Hernan Preciado Corona and Maria Corona
RESPONDING
PARTY: No response has been filed.
 
RELIEF
REQUESTED
Order
compelling Plaintiff Evelio Cardona Marroquin to provide responsive documents to
request number 12 and awarding $1,585.00 in sanctions.
 
RULING: Motion is granted.
 
SUMMARY
OF ACTION
This
case arises out of vehicle collision that occurred on March 20, 2021 between Plaintiffs
Evelio Cardona Marroquin (Marroquin) and Carolina Paz and Defendants Hernan
Preciado Corona and Maria Corona (Defendants). 
On March 9, 2023, Plaintiffs filed this action alleging causes of action
for Motor Vehicle and General Negligence.
 
On
May 10, 2024, Defendants propounded Demand for Inspection and Production of
Documents, Set One on Marroquin.  On
October 2, 2024, Marroquin served his court-ordered verified responses.  Marroquin’s response to request number 12
indicated that Marroquin would produce a copy of proof of auto insurance.  Marroquin only produced a copy of his auto
insurance which was in effect from March 21, 2021 to June 3, 2021.  The alleged accident occurred on March 20,
2021, and the proof of insurance did not cover that date.
 
On
November 15, 2024, Plaintiffs filed this motion to compel further responsive
documents to request number 12.
 
No
opposition has been filed.
 
MEET
AND CONFER
Before
filing a motion to compel further responses or responsive documents to requests
for production, the parties must meet and confer to resolve the issues with the
discovery responses.  The moving party
must file a meet and confer declaration stating facts showing a reasonable and
good faith attempt at an informal resolution of each issue in the motion.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2031.310, subd. (b)(2), 2016.040.)
 
Defendants’
counsel, David M. Hillier, Esq., states he attempted to meet and confer with
Plaintiff’s counsel about this motion. 
(Declaration of David M. Hillier, Esq.) 
On November 7, 2024, Mr. Hillier emailed a meet and confer letter to Marroquin’s
counsel.  (Hillier Dec., ¶ 5, Exh.
D.)  The letter requested a further
verified response and responsive document to request number 12.  (Hillier Dec., ¶ 5, Exh. D.)  Mr. Hillier attempted to follow up by calling
Marroquin’s counsel on November 13, 2024. 
(Hillier Dec., ¶ 6.)  Mr. Hillier
spoke with an individual named “Alvaro” and explained the issues with request
number 12.  (Ibid.)  Mr. Hillier also left a message with
Marroquin’s counsel.  (Ibid.)  As of November 15, 2024, Mr. Hillier has not
heard from Marroquin’s counsel.
 
SUMMARY
OF ARGUMENTS
Defendants
move for further responsive documents to request for production number 12 with
documents showing Marroquin’s proof of insurance on the date of the accident.  The information sought is relevant to this
action and Defendants will be prejudiced if Marroquin is not ordered to provide
further production without objection. 
Whether Marroquin’s vehicle was insured at the time of the accident is
also relevant to determining whether Proposition 213 (Personal Responsibility
Act of 1996) applies in this case.
 
No
opposition has been filed.
 
ANALYSIS
 
Legal Standard  
Where
responses to requests for production of documents have been served, but the
demanding party believes they are deficient because the statement of compliance
is incomplete, the representation of an inability to comply is inadequate,
evasive, or incomplete, or, because an objection is without merit, that party
may move for an order compelling a further response. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.310, subd. (a).)  The demanding
party must serve the motion within 45 days after service of verified responses
in question, or any verified supplemental responses.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (c).)
            
Request No. 12 - “Any and all documents reflecting and/or
confirming that a policy of automobile liability insurance was in effect for
the vehicle you were occupying at the time of the incident set forth in
plaintiff’s complaint, including but not limited to the declaration sheet.”
 
Marroquin’s Response - “Following a diligent search and a reasonable
inquiry in a good faith effort to comply with this demand, Responding Party
will produce all documents in Responding Party’s control, custody, or
possession responsive to this request.  Please
see Exhibit 2 – Photographs attached via FileVine link concurrently produced in
Plaintiff’s response to Request for Production of Documents, Set One.  Responding Party reserves the right to amend
or supplement this response as discovery and investigation are ongoing and
continuing.”
 
Defendants present the documents Marroquin produced
in response to request number 12.  Marroquin
produced a copy of his auto insurance card for an Alliance United Insurance
Company policy.  (Hillier Dec., Exh. C,
at p. 1.)  The policy’s effective dates were
March 21, 2021 through June 30, 2021.  (Ibid.)  The policy names Marroquin and Julio Antonio
Cardon Marroquin as covered drivers.  (Ibid.)  Marroquin also produced a payment form from
Fiesta Auto Insurance Center dated March 20, 2021.  (Hillier Dec., Exh. C, at p. 2.)  On the payment form, the memo field states,
“ADDED 2021 TOYOTA FULL COVERAGE & 1 DRIVER.”  (Ibid.)  The payment form also lists Kemper Auto
Alliance United Gold as the “Company.”  (Ibid.)  It is unclear whether this payment form
refers to the Alliance auto insurance policy or an older policy.
 
Defendants argue that Marroquin has not fully
complied with request number 12 because Marroquin has not produced documents
showing proof of insurance for his vehicle prior to March 21, 2021.
 
The documents produced do not clearly state or show
whether an insurance policy was or was not in effect on the date of the alleged
incident.  Although Marroquin has
provided verified response and produced the documents he promised to produce, Marroquin
fails to provide a response regarding whether a policy was or was not in effect
during the alleged incident.  This
information is relevant to determining whether Proposition 213 applies.[1]
 
Accordingly, the Court grants Defendants’ motion and
orders Marroquin to serve a further verified response and to produce further documents
showing whether Marroquin’s vehicle was or was not insured during the alleged
incident.
 
            Sanctions
The court must impose monetary sanctions against a
party or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or oppose a motion to compel further
responses to an inspection demand unless the court finds that the one subject
to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subds. (h),
(i).)
 
Defendants request $1,585.00 in monetary sanctions against
Plaintiff Marroquin.  Defendants’
counsel, David M. Hillier, Esq., charges an hourly rate of $175.00.  (Hillier Dec., ¶ 10.)  The request includes the following: (1) 2
hours preparing the motion - $350.00; (2) estimated 1 hour for appearing at the
hearing - $175.00; (3) filing costs - $60.00; and (4) filing costs - $1,000.00.  (Hillier Dec., ¶ 10(A)-(D).)  
 
The
Court finds the hourly rate and time spent on this motion is reasonable.  The Court believes the $1,000.00 “filing
costs” was listed as such in error and will address this below.
 
Accordingly,
the Court grants Defendant’s request in the reduced amount of $585.00: (1) 2
hours preparing this motion; (2) 1 hour attending the motion hearing; and (3) a
$60.00 filing fee.
 
            Section
2023.050
The court must impose a $1,000.00 sanction if the
court finds that “[t]he party, person, or attorney did not respond in good
faith to a request . . . to an inspection demand made pursuant to Section
2031.010” or “[t]he party, person, or attorney failed to confer in person, by
telephone, letter, or other means of communication in writing, as defined
in Section 250 of the Evidence Code, with the party or attorney requesting
the documents in a reasonable and good faith attempt to resolve informally any
dispute concerning the request.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., §2023.050, subd. (a)(1),(3).)
 
Defendants also seek $1,000.00 in sanctions under
section 2023.050.  Defendants erroneously
list this amount as filing costs in their declaration.  Defendants state their counsel has met and
conferred with Marroquin’s counsel to obtain proof of insurance.  (Motion, p. 4:25-26.)  This is not the case as Marroquin’s counsel
never responded to Defendants’ meet and confer efforts.  However, Defendants do present proof that
they attempted to meet and confer and that Marroquin failed to meet and confer
in good faith.
 
Accordingly, the Court also awards sanctions in
$1,000.00.
 
In total, the Court awards Defendants $1,585.00 in
monetary sanctions.
