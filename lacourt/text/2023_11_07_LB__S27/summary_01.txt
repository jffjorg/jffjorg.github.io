And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling addresses a demurrer filed by the defendants, John Canas, Bank of America, Recon Trust Company, and Evelyn Marie Canas, against the plaintiff, Marlene Canas. The plaintiff seeks quiet title, cancellation of instrument, declaratory relief, and injunctive relief. The demurrer argues that the complaint is barred by the statute of limitations, the doctrine of laches, and the failure to allege tender.

The court finds that the doctrine of laches is not applicable at this stage, and that the complaint is barred by the statute of limitations and the failure to allege tender. The court sustains the demurrer on these grounds and dismisses the complaint against Bank of America in its entirety. The court also notes that the plaintiff has not pled sufficient facts to establish that Bank of America knew of her marriage and lack of knowledge or consent, which would have been a bar to her claims. The court orders the parties to appear remotely at the case management conference and hearing on the demurrer.
