 Case Number:  23LBCV01617    Hearing Date:   November 7, 2023    Dept:  S27 Plaintiff, Harvey Smith seeks an
order permitting Brian Beckcom and Brendan Fradkin to appear pro hac vice in
this action.  Beckcom and Fradkin are both
representing Plaintiff in connection with a companion action in federal court
in Northern California, but they each reside and work in Texas.  Neither has appeared in any other action in
CA in the past two years except Plaintiff’s companion federal action.  
 
The application was properly served
on all parties to the action and the State Bar, and all State Bar fees have been
paid.  Local counsel is associated in the
action.  The application therefore meets
all requirements of CRC 9.40, and is granted. 

 
Plaintiff is ordered to give notice.  
 
Parties who intend to submit
on this tentative must send an email to the court at gdcdepts27@lacourt.org indicating intention to submit on the tentative as
directed by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department
does not receive an email indicating the parties are submitting on the tentative
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion may be placed off calendar.  If a party submits on the tentative, the
party’s email must include the case number and must identify the party submitting
on the tentative. If any party does not submit on the tentative, the party should
make arrangements to appear remotely at the hearing on this matter.
