And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Kelly Omargobon v. Cate Romich, granting defendant Romich's motion to compel Exodus Recovery, a healthcare provider, to comply with a deposition subpoena for production of Plaintiff's medical records. The subpoena was issued on June 1, 2023, and Exodus Recovery objected to it, citing that it could not release the records without signed authorization from Plaintiff. The judge found that the subpoena was proper and that the Court has authority to compel a non-party's compliance with a deposition subpoena for records. The judge also noted that the Court cannot compel Plaintiff to sign an authorization for release of medical records because it is not a permitted method of discovery. The judge's ruling is subject to change after hearing from the parties on February 7, 2024.
