[1] Evidence
Code section 604 states: “The effect of a presumption affecting the burden of
producing evidence is to require the trier of fact to assume the existence of
the presumed fact unless and until evidence is introduced which would support a
finding of its nonexistence, in which case the trier of fact shall determine
the existence or nonexistence of the presumed fact from the evidence and
without regard to the presumption. Nothing in this section shall be construed
to prevent the drawing of any inference that may be appropriate.”
