And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling issued by a judge in a case involving a dispute between Plaintiff Carmeletta Mobley and Defendant Ross Dress for Less. The case arises from an alleged incident in which Plaintiff was injured at one of Defendant's stores. Defendant has sought sanctions against Plaintiff for failing to verify responses to discovery requests, and Plaintiff has now filed a motion to terminate those sanctions.

The judge has reviewed the parties' arguments and has determined that Plaintiff's motion is not supported by a clear legal basis and that Plaintiff has not set forth enough evidence to show that she did not receive actual notice of the motions. The judge has also found that Plaintiff's failure to verify responses was not excusable and that Plaintiff has not shown a reasonable excuse for the default.

As a result, the judge has denied Plaintiff's motion to terminate sanctions. The judge has ordered Plaintiff to provide notice and file a proof of service of such.

The parties are encouraged to meet and confer to determine if a resolution may be reached. If the parties are unable to reach a resolution, they must submit on this tentative ruling.
