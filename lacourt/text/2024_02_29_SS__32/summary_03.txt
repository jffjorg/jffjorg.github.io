And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion to relieve counsel, Barry MacNaughton and Catherine Veeneman of Ervin Cohen & Jessup LLP, from representing Defendant 1242 Sunset Plaza, LLC, without prejudice. The judge found that counsel failed to attach proof of service of the notice of motion on Defendant and did not include the dates, times, and locations of future proceedings. The judge also expressed concern about the potential prejudice to Defendant in the withdrawal of counsel without another attorney available to represent Defendant. Counsel is required to provide notice of the court's ruling and file proofs of service of such notice.
