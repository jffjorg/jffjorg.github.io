CASE NUMBER:


22STCV28898




MOTIONS:  


Motion
  to be Relieved as Counsel




MOVING PARTY:


Defendant 1242 Sunset Plaza, LLC’s Counsel




OPPOSING PARTY:


None



 
BACKGROUND
 
            Defendant
1242 Sunset Plaza, LLC’s (Defendant)
counsel of record, Barry MacNaughton and Catherine Veeneman at Ervin Cohen
& Jessup LLP (Counsel), moves to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff.
Counsel contends relief is necessary due to a conflict and breakdown in the
attorney-client relationship.
 
            No
opposition has been filed for this motion. 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
To be granted relief as counsel, counsel must comply with California
Rules of Court (CRC) 3.1362. Even where grounds for termination exist,
attorneys seeking to withdraw must comply with the procedures set forth in
California Rule of Professional Conduct (CRPC) 3.700 and are subject to
discipline for failure to do so. CRPC 3.700(B) lists various grounds for
mandatory withdrawal. 
 
An attorney's right to terminate the attorney-client relationship and
withdraw from a case is not absolute. (See Vann v. Shilleh (1975) 54
Cal.App.3d 192, 197; People v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398.) The
decision whether to grant or deny an application for withdrawal is within the
court's discretion, and it does not abuse that discretion by denying the
application on the ground that the attorney's withdrawal would work injustice
upon a third party. (Hodcarriers, Bldg. and Common Laborers Local Union No.
89 v. Miller (1966) 243 Cal.App.2d 391.)
 
The rules have been liberally construed to protect clients. (Vann
v. Shilleh, supra, 54 Cal.App.3d 192.) An attorney, either with client's
consent or court's approval, may withdraw from a case when withdrawal can be
accomplished without undue prejudice to client's interests; however, an
attorney “shall not withdraw from employment until the member has taken
reasonable steps to avoid reasonably foreseeable prejudice to the rights of the
client, including giving due notice to the client, allowing time for employment
of other counsel, complying with rule 3-700(D), and complying with applicable
laws and rules.” (CRPC 3.700(A)(2).) A lawyer violates his or her ethical
mandate by abandoning a client (Pineda v. State Bar (1989) 49 Cal.3d
753, 758 759), or by withdrawing at a critical point and thereby prejudicing
the client’s case. (CRPC 3.700(A)(2); Vann v. Shilleh, supra.)
 
 
DISCUSSION
 
            Counsel has filed forms MC-051 and
MC-052 and has lodged with the Court a copy of the proposed order on form
MC-053 as required.  (Cal Rules of Court,
rule 3.1362.)  Counsel states the instant
motion is filed for the following reason: “Without breaching the
attorney-client privilege, the declaring attorney can advise that there has
been an irreparable breakdown in the attorney-client relationship which
prevents Ervin Cohen and Jessup LLP from representing the client. Substitution
by mutual consent is not an option here as the client has not responded to the
film's requests to discuss the issue.” (MC-052.)
¿¿¿ 
 
However, Counsel has not attached a proof of service of the notice of
motion on Defendant and all parties who have appeared in this matter under California Rules of Court
(CRC) 3.1362(d). Counsel only attached a proof of service for the declaration
and order. Further, the papers were not served on an officer or agent of
Defendant. Finally, as Defendant cannot represent itself as a limited liability
company, the Court finds a likelihood of prejudice to Defendant in the
withdrawal of counsel without another attorney available to represent
Defendant.
 
Additionally, Counsel has not included the dates, times, locations,
and subject matter of all future proceedings in this case. 
 
Accordingly, the Court DENIES the motion to relieve counsel
without prejudice.  
 
Counsel shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file
proofs of service of such.
