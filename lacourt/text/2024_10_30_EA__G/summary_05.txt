And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has tentatively ruled that Harley-Davidson's demurrer to Martinez's complaint is sustained with 20 days' leave to amend. Martinez alleged that Harley-Davidson sold him a 2016 Harley Davidson FXDLS that had serious defects, and he filed a complaint against Harley-Davidson, Laidlaw's Harley-Davidson, and Does 1-100. Harley-Davidson argued that the vehicle was a used vehicle and not covered by the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act, and Martinez failed to allege facts demonstrating that the vehicle was a new vehicle covered by the Act. The Judge concluded that the court sustains Harley-Davidson's demurrer with leave to amend, as Martinez has failed to state a cause of action.
