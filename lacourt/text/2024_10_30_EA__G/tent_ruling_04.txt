 Case Number:  24PSCV00981    Hearing Date:   October 30, 2024    Dept:  G Plaintiff Lafayette Federal Credit Union’s Application
for Default Judgment
Respondent: NO OPPOSITION
TENTATIVE RULING
Plaintiff Lafayette Federal Credit Union’s Application
for Default Judgment is GRANTED.
BACKGROUND
This
is a collections action. In August 2021, Plaintiff Lafayette Federal Credit
Union (LFCU) entered into a written loan agreement with Defendants Marcy
Nateras-Duenas and Fermin Duenas. In May 2023, LFCU alleges Nateras-Duenas and
Duenas breached the loan agreement by failing to make required payments and now
owe an outstanding balance of $86,936.69.
On March
28, 2024, LFCU filed a complaint against Nateras-Duenas and Duenas alleging a
single cause of action for breach of contract. On March 29, 2024, LFCU’s
process server personally served Nateras-Duenas and Duenas in West Covina.
On May
23, 2024, the court entered default against Nateras-Duenas and Duenas after they
failed to file a timely answer. On August 28, 2024, LFCU submitted the present
application for default judgment.
An
OSC Re: Default Judgment is set for October 30, 2024.
LEGAL STANDARD
Code
of Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a
party has filed to timely respond or appear.  A party seeking judgment on
the default by the court must file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a
brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in
support of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4)
a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a proposed form of judgment; (6) a
dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application
for separate judgment under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of grounds for
each judgment; (7) exhibits as necessary; and (8) a request for attorneys’ fees
if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.  (Cal. Rules of
Court 3.1800.)
ANALYSIS
LFCU
seeks default judgment against Nateras-Duenas and Duenas in the total amount of
$96,280.40, including $86,936.69 in damages, $6,171.98 in interest, $2,628.73
in attorney fees, and $543.00 in costs. Because the court finds LFCU has
submitted sufficient evidence, the court GRANTS their application for
default judgment.
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, LFCU’s
application for default judgment is GRANTED.
