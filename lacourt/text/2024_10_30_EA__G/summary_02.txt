And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's application for default judgment against the defendant, Darryl Ursery. The plaintiff, Interinsurance Exchange of the Automobile Club (IEAC), paid Pedro Munostandazo $103,500.00 for personal injury and property damages resulting from an automobile collision in May 2021. IEAC then filed a complaint against Ursery, alleging a single cause of action for subrogation. Ursery failed to timely respond to the complaint, and default was entered against him. IEAC subsequently submitted an application for default judgment, which was initially denied on May 24, 2024. IEAC then filed a First Amended Complaint and served Ursery with substitute service. Ursery again failed to timely respond, and default was entered against him again. IEAC has now submitted a second application for default judgment, which the judge has granted. The judgment is in the amount of $116,778.11, including $103,500.00 in damages, $12,763.11 in interest, and $515.00 in costs.
