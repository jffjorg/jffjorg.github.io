And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Tanera Transport LLC's motion for entry of a stipulated judgment against Atama Premier Foods LLC. The case arises from a breach of contract action related to shipment agreements between the two parties. Tanera alleges that Atama failed to pay the full price for services in the amount of $128,987.04. The parties executed a stipulation for entry of judgment on February 22, 2024, in which Atama agreed to pay $80,000 to Tanera in monthly increments of $4,000. Atama failed to make a payment on September 11, 2024, and Tanera's counsel emailed a notice of breach to Atama's counsel. Atama has failed to cure the default and the court finds that Atama's default was a result of their counsel's mistake or advertence. The court determines that relief from judgment pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b) is improper. The court grants Tanera's motion and orders the plaintiff to prepare a judgment consistent with the court's ruling.
