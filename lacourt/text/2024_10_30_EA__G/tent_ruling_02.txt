Respondent: NO OPPOSITION
TENTATIVE RULING
Plaintiff Interinsurance Exchange of the Automobile
Club’s Application for Default Judgment
is GRANTED.
BACKGROUND
This
is a personal injury action arising from an automobile collision. In May 2021, Defendant
Darryl Ursery was operating a motor vehicle on San Bernardino Avenue near
Indian Hill Boulevard in Pomona when Ursery collided with Pedro Munostandazo’s
vehicle. As a result, Munostandazo’s insurer, Plaintiff Interinsurance Exchange
of the Automobile Club (IEAC), paid Munostandazo $103,500.00 for personal
injury and property damages.
On May
16, 2023, IEAC filed a complaint against Ursery, Anthony Santanagiles, and Does
1-10, alleging a single cause of action for subrogation. On July 15, 2023,
IEAC’s process server served Ursery with substitute service in Montclair. On
October 25, 2023, the court entered default against Ursery after Ursery failed
to timely file an answer.
On November
18, 2023, IEAC’s process server personally served Santanagiles in Victorville. On
February 2, 2024, IEAC dismissed Santanagiles from the present action.
On
May 16, 2024, IEAC submitted an application for default judgment. On May 24,
2024, the court denied IEAC’s application.
On
June 5, 2024, IEAC filed a First Amended Complaint (FAC) against Ursery and
Does 1-10, alleging a single cause of action for subrogation. On July 6, 2024, IEAC’s
process server served Ursery with substitute service in Montclair.
On
August 19, 2024, the court entered default against Ursery after Ursery failed
to timely file an answer.
On
August 28, 2024, IEAC submitted the present application for default judgment.
An OSC Re: Default Judgment is set for October 30, 2024.
LEGAL STANDARD
Code
of Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a
party has filed to timely respond or appear.  A party seeking judgment on
the default by the court must file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a
brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in
support of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4)
a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a proposed form of judgment; (6) a
dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application
for separate judgment under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of grounds for
each judgment; (7) exhibits as necessary; and (8) a request for attorneys’ fees
if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.  (Cal. Rules of
Court 3.1800.)
ANALYSIS
IEAC
seeks default judgment against Ursery in the total amount of $116,778.11,
including $103,500.00 in damages, $12,763.11 in interest, and $515.00 in costs.¿Because
IEAC has submitted sufficient evidence, the court GRANTS IEAC’s application.
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, IEAC’s
application for default judgment is GRANTED.
