The court has also denied Defendants' motion to strike portions of Plaintiff's Complaint, including Plaintiff's prayer for punitive damages.

The court has granted Plaintiff 20 days leave to file a First Amended Complaint that cures the deficiencies as to the 11th cause of action for harassment and hostile work environment. The court has also ordered Plaintiff to give notice of this ruling.
