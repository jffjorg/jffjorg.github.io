DISCUSSION
Plaintiffs Luciano Gauna and Sylvia Castillo Gauna (“Plaintiffs”) filed
this lemon law action against defendants Ford Motor Company and Sunrise Ford
North Hollywood (“Defendants”) on July 15, 2021.  On April 6, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a Notice
of Settlement of Entire Case with the court. 
Plaintiffs accepted Defendants’ Code of Civil Procedure Section 998
Offer to Compromise on April 5, 2023, pursuant to which Defendants agreed to
“pay the attorneys’ fees and costs amounts determined by the Court within 60
days’ notice of the Court’s ruling on same.” 
(Wirtz Decl., Ex. H, § 998 Offer to Compromise, ¶ 2.)  The offer further specified that, in ruling
on Plaintiffs’ motion, “the fees, expenses, and costs amount shall be
calculated as if Plaintiff were found to have prevailed in this action under
section 1794(d) of the California [Civil Code] as of the date of this offer of
judgment.”  (Ibid.) 
Plaintiffs now move the court for an order awarding their attorney’s
fees and costs, to be paid by Defendants in the total amount of $106,527.53,
consisting of (1) attorney’s fees in the amount of $98,062.50 ($65,375 lodestar
+ multiplier in the amount of $32,687.50),[2]
and (2) costs in the amount of $8,465.03.
Civil
Code section 1794, subdivision (d), provides:¿ “If the buyer prevails in an
action under this section, the buyer shall be allowed by the court to recover
as part of the judgment a sum equal to the aggregate amount of costs and
expenses, including attorney’s fees based on actual time expended, determined
by the court to have been reasonably incurred by the buyer in connection with
the commencement and prosecution of such action.” 
“[T]he
fee setting inquiry in California ordinarily begins with the ‘lodestar,’ i.e.,
the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly
rate. . . . .¿ The
reasonable hourly rate is that prevailing in the community for similar work.¿
The lodestar figure may then be adjusted, based on consideration of factors
specific to the case, in order to fix the fee at the fair market value for the
legal services provided.”¿ (PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th
1084, 1095 (internal citations omitted).)¿ “[T]he verified time statements of
the attorneys, as officers of the court, are entitled to credence in the
absence of a clear indication the records are erroneous.”¿ (Horsford v.
Board of Trustees of California State Univ. (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 359,
396.) 
Plaintiffs
have submitted the declaration of Richard M. Wirtz, who has attested to the
qualifications, experience, and hourly rates of the attorneys who worked on
this case.  (Wirtz Decl., ¶¶ 4-9, 13 [as
to attorney Wirtz], 15 [as to attorney Rotman], 16 [as to attorney Underwood],
17 [as to attorney Inscore], 18 [as to attorney Henry], 19 [as to attorney
Chavez].)  The court finds that the
hourly rates charged and requested by Plaintiffs’ attorneys are reasonable.  The court disagrees with Defendants’ argument
that the hourly rates were excessive. The court also finds that the hourly
rates for the paralegals – less than the amounts charged by the attorneys and
ranging from $250 to $300 an hour – are reasonable.  (Wirtz Decl., ¶¶ 20 [paralegal Evans],
21 [paralegal Viviani], 22 [paralegal Goldson], 23 [paralegal Vitanatchi], 24
[paralegal Beatty], 25 [paralegal Bollenbacher], 26 [paralegal Hildebrand].) 
In
opposition, Defendants have challenged various billing entries as improper.  First, Defendants contend that the time
incurred in connection with drafting the motion to withdraw from arbitration
was unnecessary.  Second, Defendants
contend that various entries were inflated and reflect improper value billing,
including the entries billing for time drafting opposition papers to
Defendants’ motion to compel arbitration, drafting a meet and confer letter,
and preparing the pending fee motion. 
Third, Defendants argue that 18.80 hours billed are supported by vague
entries described as client communication. 
Fourth, Defendants contend that the 54.7 hours billed for administrative
or secretarial tasks should be excluded. 
Finally, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs’ counsel’s anticipated time to
prepare a reply brief and attend the hearing on this motion should be
excluded.  
In reply,
Plaintiffs have modified their request for attorney’s fees, and have (1)
removed all entries for calendaring deadlines, reviewing case status, and
saving documents to file, and have therefore addressed Defendants’ objection
that Plaintiffs improperly billed for administrative tasks; (2) updated the
actual time spent on preparing the reply papers, addressing, in part, the
objection to anticipatory fees; and (3) provided an updated, “further audited” summary
of the amounts billed by counsel.  (Dizon
Decl., Ex. A, pp. 5:7-9:22 [challenging various administrative tasks], p.
10:1-6 [challenging anticipatory fees in connection with motion for attorney’s
fees]; Wirtz Reply Decl., ¶ 3.) 
The court
has reviewed Plaintiffs’ revised invoice and Defendants’ Summary of
Objectionable Specific Charges.  The
court finds that (1) Plaintiffs’ attorney’s fees incurred in connection with
bringing their motion to withdraw arbitration was not unnecessary; (2) the Defendants
have not shown that the challenged entries reflect improper value billing; (3)
the time incurred for “Client Communication” is not impermissibly vague or
unreasonable; and (4) the attorney’s fees requested in connection with
preparing the pending motion for attorney’s fees are reasonable and permissibly
requested.  Thus, the court finds that
Plaintiffs have established a lodestar of $65,375.  (Wirtz Reply Decl., Ex. 1, p. 25 [(4.9 hours
x Chavez’s $400 hourly rate) + (4.2 hours x Henry’s $450 hourly rate) + (29
hours x Inscore’s $550 hourly rate) + (47 hours x Rotman’s $550 hourly rate) +
(4.2 hours x Underwood’s $550 hourly rate) + (0.5 hours x Wirtz’s $750 hourly
rate) + (5 hours x Beatty’s $250 hourly rate) + (0.8 hours x Bollenbacher’s
$200 hourly rate) + (24.7 hours x Evans’s $300 hourly rate) + (1..4 hours x
Goldson’s $300 hourly rate) + (6.8 hours x Hildebrand’s $250 hourly rate) +
(11.2 hours x Vitanatchi’s $250 hourly rate) + (11 hours x Viviani’s $300
hourly rate)].) 
Plaintiffs further seek a multiplier in the amount of $32,687.50.
“[T]he
lodestar is the basic fee for comparable legal services in the community; it
may be adjusted by the court based on factors including, as relevant herein,
(1) the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, (2) the skill
displayed in presenting them, (3) the extent to which the nature of the
litigation precluded other employment by the attorneys, (4) the contingent
nature of the fee award.  [Citation omitted.]  The purpose of such
adjustment is to fix a fee at the fair market value for the particular
action.  In effect, the court determines, retrospectively, whether the
litigation involved a contingent risk or required extraordinary legal skill
justifying augmentation of the unadorned lodestar in order to approximate the
fair market rate for such services.  The ‘“experienced trial judge is the
best judge of the value of professional services rendered in his court, and
while his judgment is of course subject to review, it will not be disturbed
unless the appellate court is convinced that it is clearly wrong.”’”  (Ketchum
v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1132.)   
The court
finds that Plaintiffs are not entitled to a lodestar enhancement.  Although the court recognizes that this
matter was taken on a contingency basis, and the attorneys displayed skill in
litigating this action, there is no evidence that this lemon law matter
involved novel or complex questions. 
(Wirtz Decl., ¶¶ 34, 37.) 
Plaintiffs
also request $8,465.03 in costs, consisting of (1) $120 in filing fees, (2)
$150 in jury fees, (3) $691.36 in service of process fees, (4) $5,350 in court
reporter fees, (5) $616.12 in electronic filing fees, and (6) $1,537.55 for
legal research, copies, printing, arbitration, and download fees.  (Memorandum of Costs, MC-010, MC-011.)  
Plaintiffs
filed their Memorandum of Costs on August 24, 2023.  “Any notice of motion to strike or to tax
costs must be served and filed 15 days after service of the cost memorandum[,]”
which may be extended pursuant to Code of Civil Procedures sections 1013 or
1010.6 depending on the method of service. 
(Cal. Rules of Ct., rule 3.1700 subd. (b)(1).)  Here, Plaintiffs served Defendants with the
Memorandum of Costs on August 24, 2023, by electronic service.  (Proof of Service filed Aug. 24, 2023, p.
2:10-15.)  Thus, Defendants were required
to serve their notice of motion to strike or tax costs by no later than
September 13, 2023 (15 days + 2 court days for electronic service).  (Cal. Rules of Ct., rule 3.1700, subd.
(b)(1); Code Civ. Proc., § 1010.6, subd. (a)(3)(B).)  Defendants did not file a notice of motion to
strike or tax costs with the court.  
Since
Plaintiffs have filed their Memorandum of Costs, and Defendants did not file a
motion to strike or tax costs, the court finds that Plaintiffs are entitled to
an award of costs in the amount of $8,465.03. 
However, even if Defendants had not waived the right to strike or tax
the Memorandum of Costs, the court would award the costs as requested by
Plaintiffs as reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd.
(c)(2).) 
 
   
ORDER
            The court grants plaintiffs Luciano
Gauna and Sylvia Castillo Gauna’s motion for attorney’s fees and costs as
follows. 
The court orders that plaintiffs Luciano Gauna and Sylvia Castillo
Gauna shall recover a total of $73,840.03, consisting of $65,375 in attorney’s fees and $8,465.03
in costs, from defendants Ford Motor Company and NGP Motors, Inc., d/b/a
Sunrise Ford North Hollywood, pursuant to Civil Code section 1794, subdivision
(d).
The court
orders plaintiffs Luciano Gauna and Sylvia Castillo Gauna to give
notice of this ruling.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
