MOVING PARTY:                 Paul Sigelman             
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Unopposed
Motion to be Relieved as Counsel for Defendant S.A.S. Movies Corp.
The court
considered the amended moving papers filed in connection with this motion.  No opposition papers were filed.
DISCUSSION
Paul Sigelman (“Defendant’s Counsel”) moves to be relieved as counsel
for defendant S.A.S. Movies Corp (“Defendant”). 
“The
question of granting or denying an application of an attorney to withdraw as
counsel (Code Civ. Proc., § 284, subd. 2) is one which lies within the sound
discretion of the trial court ‘having in mind whether such withdrawal might
work an injustice in the handling of the case.’”¿ (People v. Prince
(1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406 [internal quotations omitted].)¿ The court
should also consider whether the attorney’s “withdrawal can be accomplished
without undue prejudice to the client’s interests.”¿ (Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994)
21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915.)¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
For
a motion to be relieved as counsel under Code of Civil Procedure section 284,
subdivision (2), California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362 requires (1) a notice
of motion and motion directed to the client (made on the Notice of Motion and
Motion to be Relieved as Counsel -- Civil form (MC-051)); (2) a declaration
stating in general terms and without compromising the confidentiality of the
attorney-client relationship why a motion under Code of Civil Procedure section
284, subdivision (2) is brought instead of filing a consent under Code of Civil
Procedure section 284, subdivision (1) (made on the Declaration in Support of
Attorney’s Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel -- Civil form (MC-052)); (3)
service of the notice of motion and motion, declaration, and proposed order on
the client and on all other parties who have appeared in the case; and (4) the
proposed order relieving counsel (prepared on the Order Granting Attorney’s
Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel -- Civil form (MC-053)).¿¿  
The court finds that Defendant’s Counsel has served Defendant with the
moving papers by mail at Defendant’s last known address, which Defendant’s
Counsel has confirmed within the past 30 days is current.  (MC-052, ¶ 3, subds. (a)(1), (b)(1)(b).)  The court also finds that Defendant’s Counsel
has shown
sufficient reasons why the motion should be granted, and why counsel has
brought the motion under Code of Civil Procedure section 284, subdivision (2)
instead of filing a consent under section 284, subdivision (1). 
The court
therefore grants Defendant’s Counsel’s motion to be relieved as counsel for
defendant S.A.S. Movies Corp. 
Paul
Sigelman will be relieved as counsel of record for defendant S.A.S. Movies
Corp. effective upon the filing of the proof of service of the signed “Order
Granting Attorney’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel – Civil” on the client. 
 
 
 
 
The court
orders Paul Sigelman to give notice of this ruling and the “Order Granting
Attorney’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel – Civil” to defendant S.A.S. Movies
Corp. and to all other parties who have appeared in this action.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  October 13, 2023
