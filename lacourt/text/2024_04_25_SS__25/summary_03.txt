And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has ruled that the Plaintiff's claims are barred by the statute of limitations. The Plaintiff, Nautilus Insurance Company, filed a complaint against the Defendant, Ley Drew, Inc., alleging causes of action for breach of contract, open book account, account stated, and quantum meruit. The Defendant filed a demurrer, which was sustained by the court. The Plaintiff then filed a first amended complaint, which added new allegations and clarified the claims.

The judge has ruled that the first cause of action for breach of contract is barred by the four-year statute of limitations. The judge also found that the second and third causes of action, alleging open book account and account stated, are barred by the applicable statute of limitations.

The judge ruled that the fourth cause of action for quantum meruit is also barred by the two-year statute of limitations. The judge found that the Plaintiff did not state sufficient facts to invoke the discovery rule.

The judge has granted the Defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings with 30 days leave to amend as to the first, second, and third causes of action. However, the judge declined to allow leave to amend the fourth cause of action.
