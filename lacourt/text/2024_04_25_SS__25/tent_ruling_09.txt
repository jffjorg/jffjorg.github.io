 
BACKGROUND
 
This
action arises from an automobile accident which occurred on September 5, 2019. On
October 24, 2023, Plaintiff Khilyn Willaims, a minor by and through her
guardian ad litem, Erika Wright filed a Complaint against Defendants Jose
Rudy Amaya, Plumbing and Industrial Supply Company (collectively “Defendants”),
and DOES 1 to 100, alleging causes of action for: (1) motor vehicle; and (2)
general negligence. 
 
On
November 2, 2023, the Court appointed Erika Wright as guardian ad litem for
Plaintiff Khilyn Williams. 
 
On March
6, 2024, Petitioner Erika Wright (“Petitioner”) filed an Expedited Petition for
Approval of Compromise of a Disputed Claim of Minor Claimant, Khilyn Williams
(the “Petition”). 
 
On March
15, 2024, the Court entered an order setting a hearing on the Petition for
April 25, 2024. (03/15/24 Minute Order at p. 3.) The Court noted that “CRC
7.950.5(a)(8) provides that for a petition to be eligible for expedited
approval, the total amount payable to the minor ‘and all other parties under
the proposed compromise or settlement’ must be $50,000 or less.” (03/15/24 Minute
Order at p.3.) The Court noted that “the Petition indicates that the defendant
has offered payment of $250,000 to Petitioner to settle claims arising out of
the same incident or accident that resulted in minor’s injury.” (03/15/24
Minute Order at pp. 3-4.) As such, the Court set a hearing and ordered counsel
for Minor Plaintiff and the Petitioner/Guardian Ad Litem, Erika Wright,
to be present so that the Court could “obtain further details regarding the
apportionment of the total settlement amount between Petitioner and the minor.”
(03/15/24 Minute Order at p. 4.) The Court ordered Petitioner to file
supplemental papers addressing the deficiencies articulated in the Court’s
March 15, 2024 order at least 16 court days before the scheduled hearing.
(03/15/24 Minute Order.) 
 
The Court
ordered counsel for Minor Plaintiff to give notice and to file proof of service
of said notice. (03/15/24 Minute Order.) Counsel for Minor Plaintiff has not
filed proof of service showing that notice of the Court’s March 15, 2024 minute
order was served on all interested parties. 
 
On April
3, 2024, counsel for Minor Plaintiff filed a declaration stating the following:
counsel overlooked that an expedited petition could only be used if all
settlements including those to the claimant and all other parties needed to be
$50,000 or less and instead understood that only the settlement of the claimant
needed to be $50,000 or less. (Perlstein Decl., ¶ 3.) Counsel states that he
apologizes for the oversight. (Perlstein Decl., ¶ 3.) After an initial
investigation including obtaining relevant records from medical providers, and
negotiations with Defendants, Defendants agreed to a settlement in the amount
of $250,000.00 being paid to Erika Wright who is Plaintiff’s mother and the
Petitioner in this action. (Perlstein Decl., ¶ 4.) Ms. Wright’s case was
settled and funds were fully disbursed, including attorney fees to claimant’s
counsel, in June 2023 prior to the lawsuit being filed for Plaintiff and Minor,
Khilyn Williams. (Perlstein Decl., ¶ 5.) There was no apportionment of
settlement between Ms. Wright and her daughter, Khilyn Willaims. (Perlstein
Decl., ¶ 6.) The settlements were calculated based on each parties’ injuries
and medical specials. (Perlstein Decl., ¶ 6.)

ANALYSIS
 
I.          Petition
for Expedited Approval of Minor’s Compromise  
A.               
Legal Standard 
            An
expedited petition without a hearing, is permitted under Cal. Rules of Court,
Rule 7.950.5, so long as Petitioner uses the required Judicial Council forms
and meets certain conditions. (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 7.950.5.) A settlement
must not exceed $50,000.00. (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 7.950.5.) In order for
an expedited petition to be approved, the following conditions must exist:
1.      The
petitioner is represented by an attorney; 
2.      The
claim is not for wrongful death;
3.      Settlement
proceeds will not be placed in a trust;
4.      There
are no unresolved liens to be satisfied from the proceeds of the settlement;
5.      Petitioner’s
attorney did not become involved at the request of defendant or the insurance
carrier;
6.      Petitioner’s
attorney is not employed by nor associated with a defendant or insurance
carrier in connection with the petition;
7.      If
an action is filed, all defendants have appeared and are participating in the
compromise or the court has determined the settlement to be in good faith;
8.      the
settlement, exclusive of interest and costs, is $50,000.00 or less or if
greater than $50,000.00, the amount payable is the insurance policy limits and
all proposed contributing parties would be substantially unable to use assets
other than the insurance policy limits; and 
9.      The
court does not otherwise order. 
(Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 7.950.5(a)(1)-(9).) 
B.        Discussion  
Here, the Petition is set forth on the
required Form MC-350EX in compliance with Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 7.950.5. According
to the Petition, Defendants agreed to pay Claimant the amount of $10,000.00.
(Petition at ¶ 11(b).) Settlement payments in the amount of $250,000.00 are to
be apportioned and distributed to Petitioner. (Petition at ¶ 12(b)(3).) Attorneys’
fees in the amount of $2,500.00 are to be paid, litigation costs total $384.79,
and medical bills total $348.74. (Petition at ¶¶ 17(a)-(d).) Thus, after
payment of all fees and expenses, Claimant will receive $6,766.47. (Petition at
¶ 17(f).) 
Petitioner has presented medical
records which document injuries, treatment, and expenses (Petition at
Attachment 9), a negotiated reduction in medical expenses occurred (Petition at
¶ 13(a)(3), Attachment 13(a)), and there are letters which evidence a reduction
in medical liens (Petition, ¶ 13(c)(2), Attachment 13(c)(2).) Minor Plaintiff’s
injuries have completely healed. (Petition at ¶ 9(a), Attachment 9 at p. 25.) 
The Petition indicates that the funds
are to be deposited in insured accounts in one or more financial institutions
in this state. (Petition at ¶ 19(b)(2), Attachment 19(b)(2).) A declaration is
provided from counsel as to attorneys’ fees. (Petition at Attachment 14(a)),
and the Petition sets forth the costs requested in the amount of $384.79
(Petition at ¶ 14(b)).  
The Court references its recitation of
counsel’s declaration from above and incorporates it herein. While counsel has
provided a declaration stating that there was no apportionment of settlement
between Claimant and Petitioner, defects still exist concerning the Petition.
Counsel has not clarified why the Petition states that Petitioner paid counsel $100,000.00
in connection with the claims giving rise to the Petition. (03/15/24 Minute
Order at p.4; see Petition at ¶ 18(b).) Also, counsel has conceded to mistakenly
filing a petition for expedited approval. (Perlstein Decl., ¶ 3.) Here, the
Petition clearly sets forth that payments to all parties exceeds $50,000.00, as
a payment of $250,000.00 has been offered by Defendants to Petitioner.
(Petition, ¶ 12(b)(3).) 
As such, the expedited petition is
defective under Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 7.950.5(a)(8). Petitioner should not
have filed an expedited petition given the amount of settlement as to all
parties. 
 
II.        Conclusion 
            
            Based on the foregoing, the Petition is DENIED WITHOUT
PREJUDICE. 
 
 
            Moving party is ordered to give
notice.
