Here is a brief summary of the tentative ruling:

The court denies Defendant's motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication on the remaining causes of action. Defendant, State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company, seeks to terminate Plaintiff Ricky Montes' employment due to alleged poor performance and lack of accommodations. However, the court finds that Defendant failed to meet its burden of showing it did not discriminate against Plaintiff based on his disability and failed to provide reasonable accommodations. The court also finds that Defendant failed to propose accommodations for Plaintiff's disability prior to terminating his employment. As a result, the court denies Defendant's motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication and orders Defendant to give notice of the court's order.
