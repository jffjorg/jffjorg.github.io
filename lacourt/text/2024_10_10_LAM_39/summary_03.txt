Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The Defendant, Lithia Motors Support Services, Inc., has moved for a protective order to prevent it from responding to inspection demands served by the Plaintiff, Kenneth Oleesky. The Plaintiff seeks to inspect electronic devices used by Defendant's employees, including Gina Morse, Diana Rusnick, Tiani Langston, Angela Taber, and Mike Murray, in connection with this litigation. The Defendant argues that the inspection demands are unduly burdensome, cumulative, and overbroad.

The Court finds that the Defendant has not presented sufficient evidence to show that responding to the inspection demands would be oppressive. The Court also notes that the Plaintiff has offered to stipulate to an alternative location for the inspection to minimize travel expenses, which the Defendant has not suggested.

The Court further finds that the inspection demands are reasonably related to this litigation and are not overbroad or harassing. The Court also notes that the Defendant's argument that the Plaintiff is seeking this discovery to find spoliation of evidence is unfounded, as the Court cannot rule on potential future issues in this litigation.

Accordingly, the Court denies the Defendant's motion for a protective order. The Defendant is to give notice of this order and to file proof of service of same.
