TENTATIVE RULING
 
Plaintiff
Lori Burroughs’s motion to
compel further responses to requests for production of documents, set one is
DENIED as to Requests For Production Nos. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12,
14, 15, 16, 17, 20, 22, 24, 25, 26, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43,
44, 45, 46, 52, 53, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81,
82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 102, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109 and GRANTED as to Requests

document production, with privilege log as appropriate, are due within 30 days
without further objection.
 
            Because
Plaintiff’s motion was only partially successful, both Plaintiff’s and
Defendant’s requests for sanctions are DENIED. 
 
 
ANALYSIS
 
Discussion
 
Motion To Compel Further Responses To Requests For
Production of Documents
 
Plaintiff
moves to compel further responses to requests for production of documents, set
one, and requests sanctions.
 
(a) On receipt of a response to a
demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling, the demanding party may
move for an order compelling further response to the demand if the demanding
party deems that any of the following apply:
 
 
(1) A statement of compliance with
the demand is incomplete.
 
(2) A representation of inability
to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive.
 
(3) An objection in the response is
without merit or too general.
 
(b) A motion under subdivision (a)
shall comply with each of the following:
 
(1) The motion shall set forth
specific facts showing good cause justifying the discovery sought by the
demand.
 
(2) The motion shall be accompanied
by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040.
 
(3) In lieu of a separate statement
required under the California Rules of Court, the court may allow the moving
party to submit a concise outline of the discovery request and each response in
dispute.
 
(c) Unless notice of this motion is
given within 45 days of the service of the verified response, or any
supplemental verified response, or on or before any specific later date to
which the demanding party and the responding party have agreed in writing, the
demanding party waives any right to compel a further response to the demand.
 
.  . .
 
(i) Except as provided in
subdivision (j), if a party fails to obey an order compelling further response,
the court may make those orders that are just, including the imposition of an
issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of, or in addition to, that
sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010).
 
.  .  .

     (Civ.
Proc. Code § 2031.310 [bold emphasis added].)
 
Defendant
served further responses on January 19, 2024 by electronic service. (Declaration
of Kelcey Hoffman, ¶ 12; Exh. E.) As such, the deadline to bring the instant
motion to compel was March 6, 2024, which is the date this motion was served
and filed.
 
Plaintiff’s
counsel has submitted a declaration which reflects that Plaintiff’s counsel
engaged in sufficient meet and confer efforts prior to bringing the instant
motion. Hoffman Decl., ¶ 14; Exh. F.)
 
            The
Court addresses the request for production set forth in the separate statement:
 
 ¿       Requests For
Production Nos. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 20, 22, 24,
25, 26, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 52, 53, 67, 68,
69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 102,
104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109: DENIED.
 
As to these requests for production, Plaintiff has failed to make a
fact-specific showing of good cause for production, explaining how the
discovery sought will tend in reason to disprove a disputed fact of
consequence:
 
            Civ.
Proc. Code § 2031.310(b)(1) requires that a motion to compel further responses
to requests for production “shall set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the discovery sought
by the demand.”  (Bold emphasis
added.)  
 
“Although the scope of civil discovery is broad, it is not limitless.”
(Calcor Space Facility, Inc. v. Superior Court (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 216, 223
[61 Cal. Rptr. 2d 567].) Discovery devices must “be used as tools to facilitate
litigation rather than as weapons to wage litigation.” (Id. at p. 221.) A party
seeking to compel discovery must therefore “set forth specific facts showing
good cause justifying the discovery sought.” (§ 2031.310, subd. (b)(1); see
Calcor Space Facility, Inc. v. Superior Court, supra, 53 Cal.App.4th at p.
223.)  To establish good cause, a discovery proponent must identify a disputed fact that is of
consequence in the action and explain how the discovery sought will tend in
reason to prove or disprove that fact or lead to other evidence that will
tend to prove or disprove the fact.
 
(Digital Music News LLC v. Superior Court
(2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 216, 224 (bold emphasis and underlining added),
overruled on other grounds in Williams
v. Superior Court (2017) 3 Cal.5th 531, 557, n. 8.)
 
Although the
scope of civil discovery is broad, it is not limitless. . . .  [Former] Section 2031, subdivision (l), which
applies to document production requests served on a party, requires a
 [*224]  party seeking to compel such production to "set forth
specific facts showing good cause
justifying the discovery sought by the inspection demand . . . ." (Italics
in original.) . . .

In law and motion practice, factual evidence is supplied to the court by way of
declarations. Thiem provided argument but no evidence at all to permit the
court to conclude the material sought was "admissible in evidence or
appear[ed] reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible
evidence."  The only justification for the request is contained in
Thiem's "Statement Pursuant to Rule 335(a)" and in a document
entitled "Combined Opposition to Calcor Space Facility, Inc.'s 
Motion for Protective Order and Reply Brief in Support of Motion to Compel
Calcor Space Facility, Inc.  to Comply with Deposition Subpoena for
Production of Business Documents." Neither document is verified, and thus
they do not constitute evidence. 

Even were we to ignore that the statements purporting to justify an order
compelling Calcor to produce its documents and other materials are unverified,
they still fail. There is an absence
of specific facts relating to each category of materials sought to be produced;
the justifications offered for the production are mere generalities.
The very vice of the subpoena's promiscuity is well illustrated by Thiem's inability to provide focused,
fact-specific justifications for its demands. The noted generality of the subpoena's definitions, instructions and
categories which merely add up to a
demand Calcor produce everything in its possession having anything to do with
gun mounts, precludes Thiem from
demonstrating any particular item or category in fact constitutes or
contains matter which "is itself admissible in evidence or appears
reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence." (§
2017, subd. (a).) The purported justification for imposing this great burden on
Calcor necessarily suffers from the same generality as the subpoena itself. 

Although appellate courts have frequently stated "fishing
expeditions" are permissible in discovery, there is a limit. As noted in
Gonzalez v. Superior Court (1995) 33 Cal. App. 4th 1539 [39 Cal. Rptr. 2d 896],
"These rules are applied liberally in favor of discovery ( Colonial Life
& Accident Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1982) 31 Cal. 3d 785, 790), and
(contrary to popular belief), fishing expeditions are permissible in some
cases." (Id. at p. 1546.) However, early in the development of our
discovery law our Supreme Court recognized the limits on such "fishing
expeditions." In  [*225] Greyhound Corp. v. Superior Court
(1961) 56 Cal. 2d 355 [15 Cal. Rptr. 90, 364 P.2d 266], the seminal case in
California civil discovery, the court gave examples of improper
"fishing" WHICH CLEARLY APPLY HERE: "The method of 'fishing' may be, in a particular case,
entirely improper (i.e., insufficient identification of the requested
information to acquaint the other party with the nature of information desired,
attempt to place the burden and cost of supplying information equally available
to both solely upon the adversary, placing more burden upon the adversary than
the value of the information warrants, etc.). Such improper methods of
'fishing' may be (and should be) controlled by the trial court under the powers
granted to it by the statute." ( Id. at pp. 384-385.) . . .
 
(Calcor Space Facility v. Superior Court
(1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 216, 223-25 [bold emphasis and underlining added].)
 
¿        Requests
For Production Nos. 18, 21, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 55, 57,
58, 59, 60, 61, 99, 100, 101: GRANTED. Further responses and related document
production, with privilege log as appropriate, are due within 30 days without
further objection.
 
            In the separate
statement, Plaintiff arguably (and this is with the Court being liberal) made a
sufficient showing of good cause for production of these documents.  
 
“[I]if a timely motion to compel
has been filed, the burden is on responding party to justify any objection.” (Fairmont
Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (2000) 22 Cal. 4th 245, 255.)
 
Defendant did not offer substantive
responses to these requests.
 
            Defendant’s
objections are OVERRULED, except as indicated below. 
 
            Defendant’s
objections to the scope of the request are without merit, as there is an
inherent limitation in each request, and Defendant has not demonstrated that
finding these documents would be unduly burdensome.
 
As to
Request No. 18, by virtue of the category being limited to documents signed by
Plaintiff, this makes all of Defendant’s objections meritless. Plaintiff would
necessarily have seen these documents so the privileges would not prevent
disclosure to Plaintiff, and the use of any sensitive information contained
therein can be controlled via a protective order. 
 
As to
Requests Nos. 21, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 55, 57, 58, 59,
60, 61, 99, 100, 101 the attorney-client privilege and work product privilege
may apply to such documents, so the objection is SUSTAINED to the extent
applicable. Documents being withheld are to be identified in a privilege log,
with the applicable privilege specified.
 
            As
for the privacy objection, where asserted, Defendant did not address the
factors articulated in Hill v. National Collegiate Athletic Assn.
(1994)  7 Cal.4th 1 to
determine the seriousness of the privacy invasion and the strength of the
countervailing interest required to overcome that invasion. (Williams v.
Superior Court (2017) 3 Cal.5th 531.)
In ruling upon a privacy
objection in the contact of discovery, the party asserting a privacy right must
establish a legally protected privacy interest. (Williams, supra, 3 Cal.5th at 552.) The party asserting a privacy
right must also establish an objectively reasonable expectation of privacy in
the given circumstances. (Id.)
Further, the party asserting a privacy right must establish a threatened
intrusion that is serious. (Id.)  The Court need not proceed to the fourth step
of balancing competing interests if all three of the above are not satisfied. (Id. at 555.) If the Court reaches the
fourth step, the Court must balance these competing considerations: The party
seeking information may raise whatever legitimate and important countervailing
interests disclosure serves.  (Id. at 552.) The party seeking
protection may identify feasible alternatives that serve the same interests or
protective measures that would diminish the loss of privacy.  (Id.)
Courts may not require the party seeking discovery to demonstrate a “compelling
state interest” or “compelling need[1]”
simply because discovery of any facially private information is sought.  (Id.
at 556-57.)
As for the
confidentiality, trade secret and/or propriety information objection, this is
OVERRULED, as Defendant has not demonstrated that the request implicates such
information. However, to the extent such information is contained in responsive
documents, Defendant may redact such information unless Plaintiff objects, at
which point, a motion to compel compliance may be necessary.
Defendants cannot simply refuse to
identify any responsive documents whatsoever in a category based on the
possibility that a generalized claim that some
documents might be privileged.  
 
As specified in Civ. Proc. Code §
2031.240(b), documents to which a particular privilege is asserted must be
identified:

(b) If the responding party objects to the demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling of an item or category of item, the response shall do both
of the following:

 (1) Identify with
particularity any document, tangible thing, land, or electronically stored
information falling within any category
of item in the demand to which an objection is being made.

 (2) Set forth clearly the
extent of, and the s0pecific ground for, the objection. If an objection is based on a claim of privilege,
the particular privilege invoked shall be stated. If an objection is based on a
claim that the information sought is protected work product under Chapter 4
(commencing with Section 2018.010), that claim shall be expressly asserted.
 
     (Civ. Proc. Code, § 2031.240(b) [bold
emphasis added].)
 
            Because
Plaintiff’s motion was only partially successful, both Plaintiff’s and
Defendant’s requests for sanctions are DENIED.
