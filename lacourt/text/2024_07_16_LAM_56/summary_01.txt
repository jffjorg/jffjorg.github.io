Here is the summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling grants the motion for leave to file a third amended complaint (TAC) in a personal injury action brought by Leobardo Segura-Meza and Mirian Sanchez against Agoura Hills Marble and Granite, Inc., et al. The plaintiffs filed the original complaint on December 13, 2022, and filed a first amended complaint (FAC) on March 2, 2023. The court sustained the defendants' demurrer to the FAC with leave to amend, and the plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint (SAC) on November 21, 2023. The plaintiffs now seek to file a TAC, which adds 35 newly-identified defendants and alleges additional claims and theories of liability.

The court finds that the motion is meritorious and grants it, subject to the condition that the plaintiffs file and serve the proposed TAC within five court days of the date of the order. The court also notes that the plaintiffs have complied with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1324, and that the motion was unopposed.
