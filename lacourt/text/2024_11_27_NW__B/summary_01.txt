And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to set aside the dismissal of Fresh Concepts's cross-complaint. The motion was filed by Fresh Concepts, which claimed that the dismissal was the result of an excusable mistake by its attorney, Counsel Linwood Warren Jr. The judge found that the mistake was indeed excusable, as it was caused by a calendaring error due to the Court advancing the hearing date. The judge noted that courts have previously found excusable neglect where attorneys relied on staff members to perform tasks, including calendaring deadlines, and the staff member erred. Therefore, the judge granted the motion and ordered that the dismissal of Fresh Concepts's cross-complaint be set aside.
