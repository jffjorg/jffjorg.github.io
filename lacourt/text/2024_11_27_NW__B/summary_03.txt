And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case 22STCV05553. The case involves a dispute over whether the defendant, Hertz Corporation, must allow the plaintiff, Glendis Beker, to depose one of its employees, Darren Bibbins. The plaintiff initially noticed the deposition on March 28, 2024, but Hertz objected on April 8, 2024, which was deemed timely. However, Bibbins did not appear for the deposition on April 11, 2024, and the plaintiff's counsel sent meet and confer correspondence regarding Bibbins's non-appearance.

The judge rules that Hertz's objection was timely and that the plaintiff improperly noticed the deposition pursuant to CCP § 2025.450. The judge also notes that Bibbins is not a party to the action nor an officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a party, and therefore cannot be compelled to testify as a witness.

The judge denies the plaintiff's motion to compel Bibbins's deposition. The judge orders the moving party to give notice of the ruling.
