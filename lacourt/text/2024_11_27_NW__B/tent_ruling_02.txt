On November 1, 2021, Plaintiffs Romero Brigarde (“Brigarde”) and Benjamin Wilson (“Wilson”)(collectively “Plaintiffs”), filed a complaint against Defendants Felix Trinidad (“Trinidad”), Mike’s Performance Exhaust (“MPE”), Miguel A. Vaca (“Vaca”), and Does 1 to 50 alleging three causes of action: (1) negligence (as to all defendants); (2) battery (as to Trinidad only); and (3) assault (as to Trinidad only).On June 7, 2024, this action was reassigned to the Honorable Karen Moskowitz in Department B at Van Nuys Courthouse East, effective June 24, 2024.On October 29, 2024, Rabin Saidian, Esq. (“Counsel”) filed and served the instant unopposed Motion to be Relieved as Counsel for Plaintiff Benjamin Wilson.[TENTATIVE] RULINGThe Court DENIES the Motion to be Relieved as Counsel filed by Rabin Saidian, Esq.LEGAL STANDARDThe court may order that an attorney be changed or substituted at any time before or after judgment or final determination upon request by either client or attorney and after notice from one to the other. (Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. § 284(2).) “The determination whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel lies within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi & Levine v. Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1133.)An application to be relieved as counsel must be made on Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion) (Cal. Rules of Court Rule 3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration) (CRC Rule 3.1362(c)), and MC-053 (Proposed Order) (CRC Rule 3.1362(e)). The proposed order must specify all hearing dates scheduled in the action or proceeding, including the date of trial, if known. (CRC Rule 3.1362(e).)Further, the requisite forms must be served on the client and all other parties who have appeared in the case. (CRC Rule 3.1362(d).) The court may delay the effective date of the order relieving counsel until proof of service of a copy of the signed order on the client has been filed with the court. (CRC Rule 3.1362(e).) The Court has discretion on whether to allow an attorney to withdraw, and a motion to withdraw will not be granted where withdrawal would prejudice the client. (Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915.)DISCUSSIONCounsel declares that irreconcilable conflicts have arisen between lawyer and client. (MC-052 Item 2.) Counsel has filed and served Plaintiffs with the required documents under CRC Rule 3.1362. However, the final status conference and trial are set for December 6 and December 16, 2024, respectively. Plaintiffs would be severely prejudiced by Counsel’s relief as trial is just a few weeks away. Therefore, Counsel’s motion to be relieved is denied.CONCLUSIONThe Court DENIES the Motion to be Relieved as Counsel filed by Rabin Saidan, Esq.Moving party is ordered to give notice.
