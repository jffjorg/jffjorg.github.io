And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion of Rabin Saidian, Esq. to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff Benjamin Wilson. The judge has discretion to grant or deny such motions, and in this case, the judge has denied the motion due to the fact that trial is just a few weeks away. The judge notes that the client would be severely prejudiced by Counsel's relief at this time. The judge has also pointed out that the required documents were not properly served on all parties, including the client.
