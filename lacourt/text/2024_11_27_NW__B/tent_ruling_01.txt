  Case Number:  19STCV27671    Hearing Date:   November 27, 2024    Dept:  B MOTION FOR RELIEF FROM DISMISSALDate of Hearing: November 27, 2024 Trial Date: NoneDepartment: B Case No.: 19STCV27671Moving Party: Advanced Fresh Concepts Franchise Corp.Responding Party: NoneBACKGROUNDOn August 7, 2019, Plaintiff Victor Naing (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendants Ralph’s Grocery Company (“Ralph’s”), Kroger Company (“Kroger”), and Does 1 to 50 (collectively “Defendants”) alleging one cause of action for premises liability. The complaint alleges that, on or about August 12, 2017, Plaintiff slipped and fell on an icy patch caused by Defendants’ negligence, resulting in injuries.On August 8, 2022, Ralph’s filed a cross-complaint against Advanced Fresh Concepts Franchise Corp. (“Fresh Concepts”) and Roes 1 to 10 for indemnity, contribution and apportionment, express indemnity, and declaratory relief.On February 6, 2024, Fresh Concepts filed a cross-complaint against Michelle Chen Naing (“Michelle”) and Roes 1 to 20 for express and equitable indemnity.On May 9, 2024, Michelle entered default.On June 7, 2024, the case was reassigned to the Honorable Karen Moskowitz in Department B at Van Nuys Courthouse East, effective June 24, 2024.On July 18, 2024, Fresh Concepts reached a settlement with Plaintiff.On August 30, 2024, the Court set a case management conference (“CMC”) and order to show cause (“OSC”) re: dismissal for November 6, 2024. On October 9, 2024, the Court issued a notice of continuance moving the OSC up one week to October 29, 2024.Counsel for Fresh Concepts did not appear at the October 29, 2024, hearing. As a result, the Court dismissed Fresh Concept’s cross-complaint without prejudice.On October 31, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant motion to set aside the dismissal.LEGAL STANDARD“Section 473(b) provides for both discretionary and mandatory relief. [Citation.]” (Pagnini v. Union Bank, N.A. (2018) 28 Cal.App.5th 298, 302.) An application for relief under this section must be made no more than six months after entry of the judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding from which relief is sought and must be accompanied by an affidavit of fault attesting to the mistake, inadvertence, surprise or neglect of the moving party or its attorney. (Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. § 473(b); English v. IKON Business Solutions (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 130, 143.) Additionally, an application for relief under this section “shall be accompanied by a copy of the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed herein, otherwise the application shall not be granted.” (CCP § 473(b).) Relief under this section is mandatory when based on an attorney affidavit of fault; otherwise, it is discretionary. (Ibid.) When dismissal is the attorney’s fault, the six-month period starts to run from the date of the entry of dismissal. (CCP § 473(b); Sugasawara v. Newland (1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 294, 295.)DISCUSSIONHere, based on the declaration of Fresh Concepts’s counsel, Fresh Concepts failed to appear at the October 29, 2024, hearing due to a calendaring error by Counsel Linwood Warren Jr. (Warren Decl. ¶ 8.) Counsel declares this was an excusable mistake based on the Court advancing the OSC hearing date. (Ibid. at ¶¶ 7 and 8.) Thus, Fresh Concepts argues that mandatory relief is warranted under CCP§ 473(b). (Motion at p. 2:2-5.)Under the circumstances, the Court finds that Fresh Concepts’s argument has merit. Courts have found excusable neglect where the attorneys relied on a member of their staff “to perform certain tasks, including calendaring deadlines, and the staff member errs.” (Renteria v. Juvenile Justice, Dept. of Corrections and Rehabilitation (2006) 135 Cal.App.4th 903, 911; Bergloff v. Reynolds (1960) 181 Cal.App.2d 349, 358-359.) Therefore, the Court finds that Fresh Concepts is entitled to relief under the mandatory provision of Code of Civil Procedure § 473(b).Accordingly, the Court grants the instant motion pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 473(b).CONCLUSIONBased on the foregoing, Fresh Concepts’s Motion to Set Aside Dismissal is GRANTED. Court to sign proposed order.
