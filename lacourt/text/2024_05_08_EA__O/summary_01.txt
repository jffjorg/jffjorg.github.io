And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The court grants Defendant's motion to stay proceedings and appoint appraisers to buy out Plaintiff's membership interest in Vampyre Cosmetics, LLC. The court finds that Section 17707.03(c)(6) of the California Corporations Code provides that the buy-out procedure is not affected by the dismissal of the dissolution cause of action. The court also finds that staying the dissolution proceedings will not cause undue prejudice to Plaintiff, as the company will remain in force and effect, and that the court must stay the winding up and dissolution proceeding to ascertain and fix the fair market value of the membership interests owned by the moving parties.
