[1] A
proposed order has been filed. 


[2] The sole owner of
Phoenix Rising Cosmetics LLC is Keens and Defendant is named as the company’s
CEO. 


[3] All subsequent
statutory references are to the Corporations Code.  
 


[4] Defendant estimates
the reasonable expenses to be $10,000 per party or $20,000, and Boese is
prepared to post a bond in said amount. (Motion p. 4.) The opposition does not
address bond. 
 


[5] In anticipation of
this dismissal, Defendant addresses the issue in its motion. (See Motion pp.
4-7.) 


[6] A section 2000 shareholder
buyout is a special proceeding that provides that when a shareholder sues
for involuntary dissolution, the corporation, or the holders of 50 percent or
more of the voting power of the corporation, may avoid the dissolution by purchasing
for cash the shares owned by plaintiffs at their “fair value.” (Ontiveros,
supra, 27 Cal.App.5th at p. 267, citing § 2000, subd.
(a); see also Go v. Pacific Health Services, Inc. (2009)
179 Cal.App.4th 522, 532 [“The statutory buy-out procedure set out in section 2000 has
been aptly described as a ‘special proceeding’ rather than a civil “action.”].)

 


[7] In Kennedy, which both parties address, the
court held that a plaintiff can dismiss an involuntary dissolution cause of
action before a hearing on a motion for appraisal and
buyout under section 2000,
and the court can properly deny that motion because the prerequisite
triggering section 2000 no
longer exists.
 


[8] See Reply p. 3
[“[T]he Legislature’s use of the word “shall” in (c)(6) makes its application
mandatory. See Judith P. v. Super. Ct., 102 Cal.App.4th 535, 551 (2002)
(“word ‘shall,’ when used in a statute, is ordinarily construed as mandatory or
directory, as opposed to permissive”). The mandatory nature of (c)(6) is
“particularly [clear] when, as here, the Legislature has used both the terms
‘shall’ and ‘may’ in the same statute.” Id.; compare Section 17707.03(c)(6)
(using “shall”) with Section 17707.03(a)-(c) (using “may”)


[9] And none of the
cases the court reviewed (e.g., Ontiveros, Kennedy, and others)
mentioned that the other claims (admittedly even if there were other COAs) to
proceed despite the stay.
