And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling in this case, considering the parties' motions and oppositions. The defendant, Phoenix Rising Cosmetics LLC, has moved for appraisal and buyout under Section 2000 of the Corporations Code, which provides for a special proceeding to avoid involuntary dissolution. The court has considered the relevant case law and statutes, including Ontiveros and Kennedy. The court has determined that the plaintiff may dismiss the involuntary dissolution cause of action and that the defendant may seek to avoid dissolution through shareholder buyout. The court has also considered the defendant's estimate of reasonable expenses, which is estimated to be $10,000 per party. The court has ruled that the defendant may post a bond in the amount of $20,000 to ensure payment of these expenses. The court has also considered the mandatory nature of Section 17707.03(c)(6) and has determined that the stay of proceedings will continue until the court's final ruling.
