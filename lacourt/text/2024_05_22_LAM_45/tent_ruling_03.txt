Background
            This
is an action arising from alleged habitability issues at a multi-unit
residential building commonly described as 4515 South Hooper Avenue, Los
Angeles, CA 9001 (the “Premises”). On June 16, 2023, Plaintiffs Thalia
Rodriguez, an individual, John Charlie Ruiz, an individual, Jayleen Jackie
Valencia, a minor by Thalia Rodriguez her guardian ad litem, Pablo
Ashton-Hunter Alvizo Rodriguez a minor by Thalia Rodriguez his guardian ad
litem; and Joanna Charlotte Ruiz Rodriguez, by Thalia Rodriguez her guardian ad
litem (collectively, the “Plaintiffs”) filed a Complaint against Defendant MOGA
1967, LP, a California Limited Partnership (“Defendant”), as well as DOES 1 to
50, inclusive, alleging causes of action for: (1)  breach of warranty of habitability; (2)
breach of covenant of quiet enjoyment; and (3) negligent maintenance of the
premises. 
            On
July 6 and 7, 2023, the Court entered an order granting Thalia Rodriguez’s
application for appointment of guardian ad litem for all three minors. 
            On
February 2, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a Notice of Settlement.            
            On
February 2 and 5, 2024, Parent and Guardian Ad Litem Thalia Rodriguez
(“Petitioner”) filed the instant Petitions to Approve Compromise of Claim
(“Petitions”) on behalf of Claimants John Charlie Ruiz, Jayleen Jackie
Valencia, and Pablo Ashton-Hunter Alvizo Rodriguez (“Claimants”).
            On
March 1, 2024, the Court granted the stipulation and order advancing the
hearings on Petitions from December 10,11 and 17, 2024 to May 22, 2024.  
 
Legal
Standard
            “When
a minor, a person who lacks legal capacity to make decisions, or a person for
whom a conservator has been appointed is a party, that person shall appear
either by a guardian or conservator of the estate or by a guardian ad litem
appointed by the court in which the action or proceeding is pending, or by a
judge thereof, in each case.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 372, subd. (a)(1).)  
            Under CRC Rule 7.950, the petition must be
verified, and must include: “(1) The name, birthdate, age, and sex of the
minor or person with a disability; (2) An account of the facts or events
and the circumstances out of which the claim or injury arose, including the
time, the place, and the identity of the persons involved; (3) A
description of the nature and extent of the injury giving rise to the claim,
with sufficient particularity to inform the court whether the injury is
permanent or temporary; (4) An original or a photocopy of all doctors’
reports containing a diagnosis of and prognosis for the injury, and a report of
the claimant’s present condition; (5) In all cases in which payment for
medical or hospital care or treatment for the claimant is sought, the names of
the hospitals, doctors, and other providers furnishing the care, the amounts of
the respective charges for the care (whether paid or owing), the amounts paid
(whether covered by insurance or not), the amounts of any negotiated reductions
of the charges, and the net amount owed to each provider; (6) The amount
of attorney’s fees requested and the basis for the fees, with an itemization of
the costs sought to be allowed and charged against the settlement; (7) The
gross and net amounts of the settlement; (8) A description of the manner
in which the settlement proceeds will be distributed; (9) A full
disclosure of all amounts, if any, paid or to be paid to other claimants;
(10) A statement of whether the petitioner is a plaintiff in the same
action with the minor or claimant with a disability and, if so, whether the
pendency or disposition of the petitioner’s claim on his or her own behalf has
in any way affected the proposed compromise of the claim; (11) A statement
of whether the petitioner is a claimant against the recovery of the minor or
claimant with a disability and, if so, whether the pendency or disposition of
petitioner’s claim on his or her own behalf has in any way affected the
proposed compromise of the claim; (12) If settlement money is to be
deposited in an account or accounts subject to withdrawal only upon order of
the court, the name and address of the proposed depository; (13) A
statement whether notice of the action or claim has been given under Welfare
and Institutions Code section 14124.73; and (14) If the petition requests
an order for payment of money to a special needs trust, a statement of the
method by which all statutory liens will be satisfied under Probate Code
Section 3604.”
 
Discussion 
            Petitioner’s
Petitions for Minor’s Compromise do not fully comply with CRC Rule 7.950. Defendants have
offered to settle this matter in the amount of $45,000.00. After approval of
all the minor’s compromises, each minor will receive $9,000.00 to be deposited
in a court blocked account. (Petitions, ¶¶ 8(b)(1).) The gross amount of
settlement pertaining to Claimants is $5,767.44 and attorney’s fees in the sum
of $127.03 are requested to be paid from the gross amount of the settlement to
Claimants. (Petitions, ¶¶ 14, 16(a), and 16(e).) Thus, Claimants will receive
the net balance of proceeds in the amount of $5,767.44. (Petitions, ¶ 16(f).) 
            Of
the total settlement payment of $45,000.00, such payment is proposed to be
apportioned as follows: Plaintiff Thalia Rodriguez will receive $9,000.00; and each
Minor Plaintiffs John Charlie Ruiz, Jayleen Jackie
Valencia, and Pablo Ashton-Hunter Alvizo Rodriguez will each receive
$9,000.00. (Petitions, ¶ 11(b)(5).) 
The Court finds
that the requested attorney’s fees, which amount to 35% of the total settlement
offered to Claimants, is fair and reasonable. (Attachment 13(a).)
It is unclear
where the funds are proposed to be deposited because in Petitions, ¶ 18(b)(2),
it states see “Petition at Attachment 18(b)(2)” however, there is no Attachment
18(b)(2) in the Petitions. 
            The
Court CONTINUES the Petitions as to John Charlie
Ruiz, Jayleen Jackie Valencia, and Pablo Ashton-Hunter Alvizo Rodriguez to
allow Petitioner to submit Attachment 18(b)(2) for each Claimant. 
 
It is so
ordered.
