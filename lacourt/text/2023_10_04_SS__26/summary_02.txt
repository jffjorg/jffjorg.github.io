And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment, finding that the defendant breached the contract and caused the plaintiff to incur damages. The contract required the defendant to reconvey the deed of trust after the obligation was satisfied, but the defendant failed to do so. The judge has also found that the payment made by the plaintiff was timely and that the late charge was improperly assessed. As a result, the judge has ordered the plaintiff to file a proposed judgment within 20 days.
