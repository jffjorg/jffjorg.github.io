v. Diamond Bar City Hall, et al.DEMURRER
(CCP § 430.10, et seq.)
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Respondent Diamond Bar City
Hall’s Demurrer to the Notice of Appeal is SUSTAINED WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND. 
 
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
Petitioner Shaolin Liu (“Petitioner) filed the instant
Notice of Appeal – Administrative Hearing against Respondent Diamond Bar City
Hall (“Respondent”) on July 24, 2023. The
Notice of Appeal concerns fines and penalties issued for illegal cannabis
cultivation pursuant to Government Code section 53069.4. 
 
On August 25, 2023, Respondent filed the instant Demurrer
to the Notice of Appeal. No opposition has been filed to date. 
 
Discussion

 
The Demurrer
is accompanied by a meet and confer declaration as required by Code of Civil
Procedure section 430.41. (Demurrer, Sanchez Decl., ¶¶3-4.) Respondent demurs
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10, subdivision (e) on the
grounds that Petitioner has not sufficiently stated their appeal. Specifically,
that Petitioner filed the instant Notice of Appeal past the time allowed by Government
Code section 53069.4. 
 
Government Code section 53069.4 states in relevant part: 
 
[W]ithin 20 days after service of the
final administrative order or decision of the local agency is made pursuant to
an ordinance enacted in accordance with this section regarding the imposition,
enforcement, or collection of the administrative fines or penalties, a person
contesting that final administrative order or decision may seek review by
filing an appeal to be heard by the superior court . . . .
 
(Govt. Code, § 53069.4, subd. (b)(1).) Furthermore, “[i]f no
notice of appeal of the local agency's final administrative order or decision
is filed within the [20-day] period set forth in this section, the order or
decision shall be deemed confirmed.” (Govt. Code, § 53069.4, subd. (c).) Petitioner’s
Notice of Appeal states that the final administrative decision was served by
mail on June 28, 2023. (Notice of Appeal, filed 07/24/23.) 20 days after June
28, 2023 was July 18, 2023 but the Notice of Appeal was not filed by that date.
Instead, Petitioner filed the Notice of Appeal six days later, on July 24,
2023. 
 
This demonstrates that the Notice of Appeal was filed after
the time the challenged order or decision was deemed confirmed. Therefore, the
Demurrer to the Notice of Appeal is sustained without leave to amend.
 
Conclusion
 
Respondent Diamond Bar City Hall’s Demurrer to the Notice of
Appeal is SUSTAINED WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND. 
 
 
Moving party to give notice.
