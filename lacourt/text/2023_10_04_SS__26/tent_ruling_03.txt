ANALYSIS:
 
On November 23, 2022, Plaintiff
Interinsurance Exchange of the Automobile Club (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant action for automobile subrogation against
Defendant Gionni Robinson (“Defendant”) and Bryson Brown (“Brown”). Plaintiff dismissed Brown from the action
on April 3, 2023.  
 
Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to
Reclassify Action on July 12, 2023. No response to the action, nor opposition,
has been filed to date.
 
Discussion
 
Code of Civil
Procedure section 403.040 allows a plaintiff to file a motion for
reclassification of an action within the time allowed for that party to amend
the initial pleading. (CCP § 403.040(a).) If the motion is made after the time
for the plaintiff to amend the pleading, the motion may only be granted if (1)
the case is incorrectly classified; and (2) the plaintiff shows good cause for
not seeking reclassification earlier. (Code Civ. Proc., § 403.040, subd. (b).)
In Walker v. Superior Court (1991) 53 Cal.3d 257, 262, the California
Supreme Court held that a matter may be reclassified from unlimited to
limited only if it appears to a legal certainty that the plaintiff's
damages will necessarily be less than $25,000. (Walker v. Superior Court
(1991) 53 Cal.3d 257.) 
 
In Ytuarte v.
Superior Court (2005) 129 Cal.App.4th 266, 278, the Court of Appeals
examined the principles it set forth in Walker and held that “the court should reject the plaintiff's effort to
reclassify the action as unlimited only when the lack of jurisdiction as an
“unlimited” case is certain and clear.” (Id. at 279.) Plaintiff’s burden is to present evidence to demonstrate
a possibility that the damages will exceed $25,000.00 and the trial court must
review the record to determine “whether a judgment in excess of $25,000.00 is
obtainable.” (Ibid.) 
 
As the instant motion was filed before the time to amend the
complaint, Plaintiff must only show that the case is incorrectly classified.
The complaint seeks subrogation of insurance payments made to Plaintiff’s
insured. (Compl., ¶¶11-14.) At the time
the action was filed only, the property insurance claim had been settled in the
amount of $12,886.06. (Motion,
Tapper Decl., ¶2.) Shortly thereafter, an additional settlement was reached
under the uninsured motorist policy, for a total of $38,886.06. (Id. at ¶3.) Therefore,
Plaintiff has shown that the action is now incorrectly classified and should be
reassigned to an unlimited jurisdiction court. 
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff
Interinsurance Exchange of the Automobile Club’s Motion to Reclassify is
GRANTED. THIS CASE IS RECLASSIFIED AS
AN UNLIMITED CIVIL CASE AND TRANSFERRED TO THE RECLASSIFICATION/TRANSFER DESK
FOR COLLECTION OF FEES AND REASSIGNMENT TO AN INDEPENDENT CALENDAR COURT.
PLAINTIFF IS TO PAY THE RECLASSIFICATION FEE WITHIN TEN (10) DAYS OF THIS ORDER.
