Arroyo v. Vasquez, et al.VACATE
DISMISSAL AND ENTER JUDGMENT PURSUANT TO STIPULATION(CCP § 664.6)
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Plaintiff Rafael Arroyo’s Motion to Vacate Dismissal and Enter
Judgment is DENIED.
 
 
ANALYSIS:
 
Plaintiff Rafael Arroyo (“Plaintiff”)
filed the instant action for violation of the Unruh Civil Rights Act (“the
Unruh Act”) against Defendants Cesar Arturo Vasquez and Nectalina Vasquez
(“Defendants”) on August 23, 2019. On February 1, 2021, the Court denied
Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Adjudication. (Minute Order, 02/01/21.) On the
April 26, 2021 trial date, the parties appeared and represented that the action
had settled. (Minute Order, 04/26/21.) 
 
On June 29,
2021, Plaintiff filed a Notice of
Settlement, and the Order to Show Cause Re: Status of Settlement and Dismissal
held on the same day was continued to August 10, 2021. (Minute Order,
06/29/21.) On August 10, 2021, Defendant did not appear and Plaintiff requested
another continuance. (Minute Order, 08/10/21.) The Order to Show Cause was
continued to September 29, 2021, but on August 31, 2021, Plaintiff dismissed
the entire action with prejudice. (Request for Dismissal, 08/31/21.)  
 
On August 25, 2023, Plaintiff filed the
instant Motion to Vacate Dismissal and Enter Judgment. To date, no opposition
has been filed. 
 
Discussion
 
The instant motion is brought under Code of Civil Procedure, section
664.6, which states in relevant part:
 
If parties to pending litigation
stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties outside the presence of the court
or orally before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the
court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.
If requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties
to enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of the
settlement.
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6, subd.
(a).) Prior to January 1, 2021, “parties” under section 664.6 meant the
litigants themselves, not their attorneys. 
(Levy v. Superior Court (1995) 10 Cal.4th 578, 586.) The current
statute provides that “parties” includes “an attorney who represents the party”
and an insurer’s agent. (Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6, subd. (b).) The settlement
must include the signatures of the parties seeking to enforce the agreement,
and against whom enforcement is sought. (J.B.B. Investment Partners, Ltd. v.
Fair (2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 974, 985.) Plaintiff has demonstrated the settlement agreement complies with
the statutory requirements set forth above as it was signed by both parties and
their attorneys. (Motion, Johnson Decl., Exh. 1, p. 7.)
 
Furthermore, the request for
retention of jurisdiction must be made in writing, by the parties, before the
action is dismissed for the Court’s retention of jurisdiction to conform to the
statutory language. (Wackeen v. Malis (2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 429, 433.) “If,
after a suit has been dismissed, a party brings a section 664.6 motion for a
judgment on a settlement agreement but cannot present to the court a request
for retention of jurisdiction that meets all of these requirements, then
enforcement of the agreement must be left to a separate lawsuit.” (Ibid.)
Plaintiff offers no evidence that the parties asked the Court to retain
jurisdiction over this action to enforce the settlement prior to the dismissal
filed on August 31, 2021. (Motion, pp. 1:28-2:3.) Nor is there any evidence of
such a retention of jurisdiction in the Court’s records. It is not enough that
the parties’ settlement includes their agreement for the Court to retain
jurisdiction under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6, if that request was
presented to, and accepted by, the Court. (See Motion, Johnson Decl., Exh. 1,
¶5.) Therefore, the Court has no jurisdiction over this action at this time,
nor jurisdiction to enforce the parties’ settlement agreement. 
 
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff Rafael Arroyo’s Motion to Vacate Dismissal and Enter
Judgment is DENIED.
 
 
Court clerk to give notice.
