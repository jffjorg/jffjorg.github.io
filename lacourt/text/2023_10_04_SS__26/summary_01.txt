Because the court did not have a formal request for retention of jurisdiction, it lacks the authority to enforce the settlement agreement.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to vacate the dismissal and enter judgment. The plaintiff filed the instant action for violation of the Unruh Civil Rights Act against the defendants in 2019. After several continuances, the parties appeared and represented that the action had settled in 2021. The plaintiff then filed a notice of settlement and a request for dismissal, which was granted on August 31, 2021. The plaintiff has now filed a motion to vacate the dismissal and enter judgment, but the judge has denied the motion because the parties did not request the court to retain jurisdiction over the action prior to the dismissal, as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6. The judge notes that the parties' settlement agreement complies with the statutory requirements, but the request for retention of jurisdiction must be made in writing by the parties before the action is dismissed.
