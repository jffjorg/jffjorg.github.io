And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling denies Plaintiff Rafael Arroyo's motion to vacate dismissal and enter judgment. The Plaintiff filed the lawsuit on August 23, 2019, and the Court denied his motion for summary adjudication on February 1, 2021. The parties appeared on April 26, 2021, and represented that the action had settled. However, the Plaintiff dismissed the lawsuit with prejudice on August 31, 2021, and now seeks to vacate the dismissal and enter judgment. The Court finds that the settlement agreement complies with the statutory requirements, but the Plaintiff failed to request retention of jurisdiction prior to the dismissal. Therefore, the Court has no jurisdiction to enforce the settlement agreement and denies the Plaintiff's motion.
