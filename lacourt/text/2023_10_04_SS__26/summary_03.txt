And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the motion to reclassify the case filed by the plaintiff, Interinsurance Exchange of the Automobile Club. The case was initially classified as a limited jurisdiction case, but the plaintiff has shown that the damages may exceed $25,000.00. The plaintiff had previously settled insurance claims for $12,886.06 and $38,886.06, which exceeds the $25,000.00 threshold. Therefore, the case will be reclassified as an unlimited jurisdiction case and transferred to an independent calendar court. The plaintiff must pay the recategorization fee within 10 days of the order.
