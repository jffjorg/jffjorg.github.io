## English Summary:

Judge's tentative ruling in the case of Liu v. Diamond Bar City Hall sustains the city's demurrer to Liu's Notice of Appeal. This means the Judge believes Liu's appeal is invalid because it was filed six days after the 20-day deadline outlined in Government Code Section 53069.4. The Judge notes that Liu received the final administrative decision on June 28th, 2023, and the deadline to file an appeal was July 18th, 2023, but the Notice of Appeal was not filed until July 24th, 2023.  As a result, the Judge rules that the Notice of Appeal is untimely and dismisses it.
