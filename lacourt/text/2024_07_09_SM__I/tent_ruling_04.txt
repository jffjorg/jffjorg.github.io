 Case Number:  24SMCV00828    Hearing Date:   July 9, 2024    Dept:  I The court will discuss with the parties a date for the
hearing, but would inquire whether plaintiff has reached out to the defense to
try and get a date certain by which responses will be served.  If so, the court is likely to GRANT the
OSC.  If not, that ought to be done.
