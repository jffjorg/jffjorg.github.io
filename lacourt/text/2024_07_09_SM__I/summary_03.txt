And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in a fraud case, denying the motion to set aside the default judgment. The defendant, Coti Williams, was properly served with the complaint and demurred, but failed to file an answer within the 30-day timeframe specified by the court. The court entered a default against the individual defendants, but not the entity defendant, which was not properly served. The defendant filed an answer on January 31, 2024, but it was ineffective against the individual defendants. The court finds that the delay in filing the answer was deliberate and tactical, and that the defendant did not demonstrate any mistake or excusable neglect. The Judge has given the plaintiff a choice: they can accept the default judgment in the amount sought, except for punitive damages, or they can vacate the default and file a statement of damages to litigate.
