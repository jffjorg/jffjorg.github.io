 Case Number:  23SMCV00120    Hearing Date:   July 9, 2024    Dept:  I Code of Civil Procedure requires that a party suing a
licensed architect for malpractice must obtain a certificate of merit (with
certain exceptions not relevant here) before bringing suit.  The moving party, Fenske, contends that
cross-complainant does not have such a certificate and brought a motion to
dismiss on that basis.  Cross-complainant
has filed no opposition, presumably because there is no such certificate.  Accordingly, the motion is GRANTED.  The cross-complaint against Fenske is
DISMISSED.  Fenske to recover his
costs.  Because Fenske is no longer a
party, any motion involving him is MOOT and the stay, having served its
purpose, is lifted.  Fenske is to prepare
the written order of dismissal and lodge it with the court within 20 days.
