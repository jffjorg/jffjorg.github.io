And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling is regarding a motion to dismiss a cross-complaint filed by Fenske against an unknown defendant. The dispute centers around the requirement that a party suing a licensed architect for malpractice must obtain a certificate of merit before bringing suit. Since the cross-complainant has failed to file a certificate of merit and has not opposed the motion to dismiss, the motion is granted. As a result, the cross-complaint is dismissed, and Fenske is entitled to recover his costs. Since the cross-complainant is no longer a party, any future motions involving them are moot. The stay is lifted, and Fenske is required to prepare a written order of dismissal and file it with the court within 20 days.
