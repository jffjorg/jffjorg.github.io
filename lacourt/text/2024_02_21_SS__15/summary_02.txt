And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to quash service of summons filed by PTI Union LLC, a non-resident defendant. The motion was filed in response to a lawsuit alleging that the defendant's talc-containing products caused mesothelioma in the plaintiffs. The judge has granted the motion and dismissed the complaint without prejudice. The judge's decision is based on the fact that the defendant did not have a role in determining the content of the label, final release, commercial distribution, sale, or marketing of the product, and that the plaintiffs did not provide sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the defendant purposefully availed itself of the California market. The judge also noted that the defendant's indirect sales through its California distributors did not constitute sufficient economic activity in California to establish personal jurisdiction.
