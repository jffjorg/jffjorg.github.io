And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling grants the motion for leave to amend the complaint filed by Plaintiffs Kari Marie Lee, Gregory Lee, Christopher Lee, and Ryan James Lee. The Plaintiffs had previously filed initial, first amended, and second amended complaints, and are now seeking to add a cause of action under Section 905(b) of the Longshore and Harbor Worker's Compensation Act against Defendant City of Long Beach as vessel owner of the RMS Queen Mary. The Plaintiffs' counsel discovered the potential cause of action during deposition preparation of Defendant's witness, Johnny Vallejo, on December 19, 2023. The Defendant argues that the delay in seeking amendment is inexcusable and unwarranted, and that the amendment will prejudice them because the parties have completed fact discovery, the Defendant has filed its motion for summary judgment, and the Defendant will not be able to conduct necessary discovery. However, the Court finds that there is sufficient time for the parties to conduct necessary discovery and file motions, and therefore grants the motion. The Plaintiffs are ordered to file and serve the third amended complaint within five days of the date of this order.
