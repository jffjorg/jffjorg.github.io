The judge has denied the plaintiffs' motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories, as FCA has already provided supplemental responses to the interrogatories at issue. The judge finds that the parties have been engaged in informal resolution efforts and that further efforts would have been expected before seeking an order compelling further responses. The judge also denies the plaintiffs' request for monetary sanctions, as there is no evidence that FCA acted in bad faith or that the parties did not make a good faith effort to resolve the issue informally. The ruling is without prejudice to any future motion to compel further responses that may be appropriate following further meet and confer efforts.

## English Text Summary

The Judge denied the Plaintiffs' motion to compel further responses from the Defendants regarding certain interrogatories.  Although the Plaintiffs initially brought a motion to compel, the Defendants provided supplemental responses to all the contested interrogatories before the hearing. The Judge found these responses substantive and sufficient, effectively rendering the motion moot. No monetary sanctions were imposed as the parties engaged in meet and confer efforts and the Defendants were willing to provide supplemental information. The case can now proceed.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on the motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories by the plaintiffs. The motion is denied without prejudice, meaning that the plaintiffs can still file a future motion to compel further responses if necessary. The judge found that the defendants, Geovel, Inc. and FCA US LLC, had provided supplemental responses to the interrogatories during the pendency of the motion, and that these responses were substantive in nature. The judge also denied the plaintiffs' request for monetary sanctions, finding that the parties had been in the process of informal resolution and that further efforts on that front would have been expected.

The tentative ruling by the Judge denies Plaintiffs’ motion to compel FCA to provide further responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One, numbers 25, 31, and 45-48. The Judge finds that FCA has served supplemental responses to each of the Special Interrogatories at issue in this motion, and Plaintiffs are required to meet and confer further with FCA if they believe the responses are still defective. Monetary sanctions are not warranted under these circumstances. The order is without prejudice to any future motion to compel further responses that may be appropriate, following further meet and confer efforts. Plaintiffs’ request for monetary sanctions is also denied at this time.
