```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiffs' motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories, as FCA has already provided supplemental responses to the interrogatories at issue. The judge finds that the parties have been engaged in informal resolution efforts and that further efforts would have been expected before seeking an order compelling further responses. The judge also denies the plaintiffs' request for monetary sanctions, as there is no evidence that FCA acted in bad faith or that the parties did not make a good faith effort to resolve the issue informally. The ruling is without prejudice to any future motion to compel further responses that may be appropriate following further meet and confer efforts.
