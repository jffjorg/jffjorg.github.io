The judge has denied the plaintiffs' motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories, as FCA has already provided supplemental responses to the interrogatories at issue. The judge finds that the parties have been engaged in informal resolution efforts and that further efforts would have been expected before seeking an order compelling further responses. The judge also denies the plaintiffs' request for monetary sanctions, as there is no evidence that FCA acted in bad faith or that the parties did not make a good faith effort to resolve the issue informally. The ruling is without prejudice to any future motion to compel further responses that may be appropriate following further meet and confer efforts.

## English Text Summary

The Judge denied the Plaintiffs' motion to compel further responses from the Defendants regarding certain interrogatories.  Although the Plaintiffs initially brought a motion to compel, the Defendants provided supplemental responses to all the contested interrogatories before the hearing. The Judge found these responses substantive and sufficient, effectively rendering the motion moot. No monetary sanctions were imposed as the parties engaged in meet and confer efforts and the Defendants were willing to provide supplemental information. The case can now proceed.

The judge has ruled on the motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories by the plaintiffs. The motion is denied without prejudice, meaning that the plaintiffs can still file a future motion to compel further responses if necessary. The judge found that the defendants, Geovel, Inc. and FCA US LLC, had provided supplemental responses to the interrogatories during the pendency of the motion, and that these responses were substantive in nature. The judge also denied the plaintiffs' request for monetary sanctions, finding that the parties had been in the process of informal resolution and that further efforts on that front would have been expected.

## Case Summary: Booth v. Geovel, Inc. et al.

**Case Number:** 22AHCV00979
**Hearing Date:** September 26, 2023
**Department:** P

**Plaintiffs:** Justin Booth and Cynthia Booth
**Defendants:** Geovel, Inc. (d/b/a I-10 Chrysler Jeep Dodge Ram), FCA US LLC

**Summary:**

This case involves a dispute over warranty claims for a 2021 Ram 1500 truck. Plaintiffs allege that the vehicle had numerous defects and nonconformities during the warranty period, and that defendants were unable to repair them after a reasonable number of attempts. This violates California's Song-Beverly Act, which guarantees a certain level of consumer protection for defective products.   

Plaintiffs filed a motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories from defendant FCA.  These interrogatories sought specific information about warranty claims data and failure rates for similar vehicles. 

**Judge's Ruling:**

The Judge denied the motion to compel as moot.  While FCA initially resisted providing some of the requested information, they ultimately provided supplemental responses to all of the interrogatories in question. The Judge found these responses to be substantive and found no justification for imposing monetary sanctions on either party.  

**Key Points:**

*  The case centers around alleged warranty violations under the Song-Beverly Act.
*  Plaintiffs sought specific data from defendant FCA through special interrogatories.
*  Initially, the defendant resisted providing some of the requested information.
*  Ultimately, the defendant provided supplemental responses, rendering the motion moot.
*  The Judge denied monetary sanctions due to the parties' ongoing good-faith efforts to resolve the matter informally.
