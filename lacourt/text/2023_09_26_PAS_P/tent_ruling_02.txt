Case No.: 23AHCV00657
 
 
[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER GRANTING DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO QUASH SERVICE OF SUMMONS AND COMPLAINT
 
Date:   September
  26, 2023
Time:  8:30 a.m.
Dept.:  P



 
          
          I.        INTRODUCTION
          This personal injury action stems from
an automobile accident that occurred April 26, 2021, in the City of Monrovia.
Plaintiff Nancy Urrea alleges that at or near the intersection of Myrtle and
Evergreen, the vehicle she was operating was struck by a vehicle being driven
by Defendant John Resing Schoeni, causing mental, physical, and emotional pain
to her and to Plaintiff Cecilia Velasquez.
          According to the proof of service
filed in this action, Schoeni was served by substitute service on May 26, 2023.
Presented with this motion to quash is evidence demonstrating that Schoeni died
in November 2021. The motion to quash is granted.         
 
II.       LEGAL
STANDARD
          Code Civ. Proc. §418.10(a)(1) provides that a defendant, on
or before the last day to plead, may file a motion to quash service of the
summons on the ground of lack of jurisdiction.
           
III.     ANALYSIS
          This motion to quash is not opposed and is granted. Based
on the evidence presented, Schoeni died on November 28, 2021. A copy of his
death certificate is offered as evidence of this. Also offered as evidence is
the declaration of his son, John Jefferey Schoeni, who states that no one
resides at the address where his father was purported to have been served by
substituted service, because his mother was moved to a care facility in March
2023, two months prior. John Jefferey Schoeni avers that the summons and
complaint were found in the mailbox. Based on this undisputed evidence, Schoeni
was not served with the summons and complaint.
 
IV.     ORDER
          The motion to quash service of summons and complaint on
Defendant Schoeni is granted.  Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
