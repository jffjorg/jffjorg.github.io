## English Text Summary:

This tentative ruling grants Defendant John Resing Schoeni's motion to quash service of the summons and complaint.  The judge finds that Schoeni died in November 2021, and the evidence presented shows that he was not properly served with the lawsuit. 

The plaintiffs, Nancy Urrea and Cecilia Velasquez, filed a personal injury lawsuit stemming from a car accident in Monrovia in 2021.  Schoeni's son, John Jefferey Schoeni, provided a declaration stating that his father had passed away in November 2021 and that no one resided at the address where he was allegedly served by substitute service at the time. 

Since Schoeni is deceased, the court concludes that the lawsuit must be dismissed.

The plaintiffs, Nancy Urrea and Cecilia Velasquez, brought a personal injury action against John Resing Schoeni and John Does 1 through 10, inclusive, based on an automobile accident that occurred on April 26, 2021, in Monrovia. However, evidence presented demonstrates that Schoeni died in November 2021, and no one resides at his address where he was purported to have been served by substitute service. Therefore, Schoeni was not served with the summons and complaint, and the court grants the motion to quash service.
