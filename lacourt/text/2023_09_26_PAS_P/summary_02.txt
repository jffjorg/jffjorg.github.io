The motion is based on the fact that the defendant, John Resing Schoeni, died on November 28, 2021, and was not served with the summons and complaint. The evidence presented shows that Schoeni was not served with the summons and complaint, as he died before the substitute service was attempted on May 26, 2023. The judge has ordered that the moving party give notice of this ruling.
