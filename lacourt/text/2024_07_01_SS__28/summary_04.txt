And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the moving and opposition papers and has ruled as follows. The case involves a negligence and negligence per se action filed by Norberto Eduardo Sosa Garcia and Manuel Enrique Del Rio against Gabriel Antonio Torrone and Does 1-25. Defendant Torrone has filed a motion to continue the trial to February 17, 2025, and related dates. Plaintiffs do not oppose a continuance, but argue that Defendant did not meet and confer about the date of a continued trial. The Court finds good cause and continues the trial to the first available date in March 2025. The final status conference, discovery, and related dates will be based on the new trial date.
