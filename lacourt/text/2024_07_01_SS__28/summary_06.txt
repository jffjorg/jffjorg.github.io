This is a tentative ruling by a judge regarding a motion to substitute Betty Darlen Martinez into the case as the successor in interest to the original plaintiff, William David Martinez, who passed away on November 13, 2023. The plaintiff filed the action on September 25, 2023, and several defendants have filed answers. The state and city were previously dismissed without prejudice. The plaintiff's mother, Betty Darlen Martinez, has filed a declaration that satisfies the requirements of California Code of Civil Procedure section 377.32, which allows a successor in interest to continue the action. The court grants the motion and substitutes Betty Darlen Martinez into the case as the successor in interest to the original plaintiff.
