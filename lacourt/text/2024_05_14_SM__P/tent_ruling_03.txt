Attorneys’ Fees and Costs
Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16(c)(1) states “a prevailing
defendant on a special motion to strike shall be entitled to recover that
defendant’s attorney’s fees and costs.” The award of attorneys’ fees and costs
to a prevailing anti-SLAPP defendant is mandatory. Ketchum v. Moses
(2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1131 [“[u]nder Code of Civil Procedure §425.16,
subdivision (c), any SLAPP defendant who brings a successful motion to strike
is entitled to mandatory attorney’s fees.”] 
 
The
Court granted Robles’ anti-SLAPP. Minute Order 2/15/24. As the prevailing party, Robles’ motion is proper, and he is entitled to attorneys’
fees. 
 
Reasonable Fees
The
California Supreme Court has determined the lodestar method is the proper
mechanism to calculate attorneys’ fees under Code of Civil Procedure section
425.16(c). Ketchum, 24 Cal.4th at 1136. To calculate a lodestar amount,
the court must determine the reasonableness of the hourly rates sought. The
“reasonable hourly rate” applicable under the lodestar method is the rate
“prevailing in the community for similar work.” PLCM Group v. Drexler
(2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095. “The trial court makes its determination after
consideration of a number of factors, including the nature of the litigation,
its difficulty, the amount involved, the skill required in its handling, the
skill employed, the attention given, the success or failure, and other
circumstances in the case.” Id. at 1096.
 
Robles seeks fees for counsel Kovalsky at an hourly rate ranging from $550
to $850 with enhancement/multipliers, at an end rate of $1,100 an hour.[1] Kovalsky
Decl., ¶ 3. Robles argues Kovalsky’s rate is reasonable because he has been a
civil litigator for 31 years and has successfully brought several anti-SLAPP
motions. Id. at ¶ 1. Kovalsky been awarded a multiplier in addition to
his hourly rate when on a solely contingent fee basis. Id. at ¶¶
1, 3. Kovalsky cites Truong v. Tran September 19, 2017 Orange
County Superior Case No. 30-2016- 00879877-CU-NP-CJC to support the hourly rate
request. Id. at ¶ 15. To support the enhancement request, Robles raises the
difficulty and novelty of the issues raised in the anti-SLAPP motion,
particularly “the analysis and distinguishing the private arbitration non
judicial limited case law and the cross-over of judicial proceedings.” Motion,
p. 6. Robles also raises the skill displayed and results obtained as well as
the contingent basis to support the request. Id. at pp. 6-7. 
 
Yazdi,
in opposition, does not contest the hourly rate of $550 but argues no
multiplier is appropriate. 
 
The
Court finds an hourly rate of $550 with no enhancement is reasonable. The Court is not tied to determinations of sister courts on
the reasonableness in fees. Second, based on the Court’s experience overseeing
attorney fees motions relating to a successful anti-SLAPP motion, $550
per hour is reasonable. Third, while the Court considered the factors set forth
for awarding an enhancement, the Court finds the¿contingent risks, skill, and
difficulty¿Robles asserts are absorbed by Kovalsky’s hourly rates. Robertson
v. Fleetwood Travel Trailers of California. Inc.¿(2006) 144 Cal.App.4th
785, 822. In addition, there are no indications Kovalsky engaged in any
different actions from his usual strategy to achieve the result here besides stating
difficulty in “the analysis and distinguishing the private arbitration non
judicial limited case law and the cross-over of judicial proceedings”; however,
Kovalsky is an experienced civil litigator with success bringing several anti-SLAPP
motions as per his declaration. 
 
Billed
Hours
The
verified time entries of the attorneys are entitled to a presumption of
credibility, which extends to an attorney’s professional judgment as to whether
time spent was reasonably necessary to the litigation. Horsford v. Board of Trustees
of California State University (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 359, 396 [“We think
the verified time statements of the attorney as officers of the court are
entitled to credence in the absence of a clear indication the records are
erroneous.”].  “California courts do not
require detailed time records, and trial courts have discretion to award fees
based on declarations of counsel describing the work they have done and the
court’s own view of the number of hours reasonably spent.” Syers Properties
III, Inc. v. Rankin (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 691, 698-699.
 
Robles
requests 38.2 hours related to the anti-SLAPP motion, plus 7 hours bringing the
instant motion and 6 hours anticipated in dealing with any opposition. Kovalsky
describes the work performed in his declaration. Kovalsky
Decl., ¶ 13.
 
Yazdi argues the hours spent are excessive. However, Kovalsky’s
time entries are stated in the declaration, and Yazdi does not identify any
particular entry that the Court should strike.
 
The Court finds that 38.2 hours related to the anti-SLAPP motion, but
13 hours related to the instant motion is excessive. The court awards 8 hours
for the fees motion. Robles’
motion for attorney fees is GRANTED in the amount of 46.2 hours at $550/hour, a
total of $25,410.
