Chun
v. Smith, Case No. 22SMCV01932
Hearing
date May 14, 2024
Cross-Defendant
Chun’s Demurrer to Cross-Complainant’s Addendum to Cross-Complaint
On October
19, 2022 plaintiff Chun sued defendant Smith, alleging motor vehicle negligence
and assault and battery. Chun alleges Smith and unnamed Doe defendants
approached him outside a friend’s residence and Smith “swung his hand at
[Chun’s] face.” Complaint pg. 5. The form complaint is vague as to whether
Smith actually struck Chun. 
Smith cross-complained for indemnification,
apportionment of fault, declaratory relief, and “intentional tort.” On January
19, 2024, the Court sustained Chun’s demurrer with leave to amend on the ground
that the cross-complaint was devoid of factual allegations. On February 23,
2024, Smith filed an “Addendum to Cross-Complaint.” Chun demurs to Smith’s
Addendum to Cross-Complaint. No opposition has been received. 
Chun argues
that the Addendum to Cross-Complaint fails to provide a factual basis for Smith’s
original claims. Smith claims he has video evidence to show Chun fabricated
events and filed false charges against him with the Culver City Police
Department. Addendum to Cross-complaint pg. 1. Smith states Chun has harassed
him and trespassed onto his property. Id. at pg. 2. Ultimately, these
statements, even if asserted within an amended cross-complaint, do not provide
a factual basis for Smith’s original claims of indemnification,
apportionment of fault, declaratory relief, and “intentional tort.” In terms of
the “intentional tort” claim, the statements made in the addendum still render
the claim uncertain. 
Smith again failed to allege sufficient facts to
support his initial claims despite being given a second opportunity to do so.
SUSTAINED without leave to amend.
