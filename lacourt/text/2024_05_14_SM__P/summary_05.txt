And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the motions to compel responses to post-judgment interrogatories and requests for production and for monetary sanctions. The judgment creditor, Blue Rider Media Finance, LLC, served the post-judgment interrogatories and requests for production on the judgment debtors, War Paint Movie, LLC, et al., but they failed to respond. The judge finds that the judgment debtors' failure to serve timely responses is a misuse of the discovery process and grants the judgment creditor's motions. The judge reduces the amount of sanctions sought by the judgment creditor, awarding $2,000 in sanctions. The judgment debtors are ordered to serve verified responses without objections and to pay sanctions within 20 days.
