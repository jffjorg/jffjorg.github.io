And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Chun v. Smith, Case No. 22SMCV01932. The case involves a dispute over allegations of motor vehicle negligence, assault and battery, and indemnification, apportionment of fault, declaratory relief, and "intentional tort". The Court has sustained Chun's demurrer to Smith's addendum to cross-complaint, finding that the addendum fails to provide a factual basis for Smith's original claims. The Court has also determined that Smith's claims are unsustainable and have failed to provide sufficient facts to support his initial claims. The Court has denied leave to amend, meaning that Smith's claims will not be allowed to continue.
