(1)  
Motion to Compel Responses to Post-Judgement

(2)  
Motion to Compel Responses to Post-Judgement Requests

On
December 21, 2023 the Court entered the amended judgment in favor of Blue Rider
Media Finance, LLC (“judgment creditor”) in the amount of $3,984,500 against
War Paint Movie, LLC, 13 Films, LLC and Schenz (“judgment debtors”) upon
stipulation. Coate Decls. ¶ 2, Ex. A. No portion of the stipulated judgment has
been paid to date. Id. ¶ 2.
 
On
February 14, 2024 judgment creditor served judgment debtors with post-judgement
interrogatories and requests for production. Id. ¶¶ 3-5; Exs. B-D. Despite
granting an extension request, judgment creditor has not received any
responses. Id. ¶¶ 7-8; Ex. E. Judgment creditor brings the instant
motions to compel responses to post-judgment interrogatories and requests for
production and for monetary sanctions. No opposition was filed.
 
The discovery methods available to a
judgment creditor to seek post-judgment discovery include written
interrogatories and a demand for production of documents to judgment debtor.
Code Civ. Proc., §§ 708.020, 708.030.
 
Here, the post judgment interrogatories
and requests for production were properly served on judgment debtors, who
failed to respond. Judgment creditor is entitled to an order compelling
judgment debtors to provide responses, without objections. Judgment debtors’ failure to serve timely
responses is a misuse of the discovery process. Sanctions are appropriate under
Code of Civil Procedure sections 708.020, 708.030, 2030.290 and 2031.300. Sanctions may be awarded even though no opposition to the
motion was filed. CRC Rule 3.1348(a). However, the amounts sought are excessive. 
 
As to the
interrogatories, judgment creditor seeks $4,000, representing 4 hours incurred
at Coate’s hourly rate of $550 and 4 hours at Brisbois’s hourly rate of $450. Coate
Decl. ¶ 9. Coate spent in excess of two hours, including meeting and conferring
with Schenz to grant an extension of time to respond to the requests, and in
drafting the motion. Id. Coate anticipates spending another hour
reviewing opposition papers, preparing for hearing and one hour participating
in the hearing. Id. Brisbois spent in excess of two hours researching
and drafting the motion and anticipates spending another two drafting reply
papers. Id.
 
As to the requests
for production, judgment creditor seeks $4,900, representing 4 hours at
Coate’s hourly rate of $550 and 6 hours at Brisbois’s hourly rate of $450. Coate
Decl. RPD ¶ 9.  The breakdown of
Coate’s hours is the same as above; Brisbois spent three hours researching and
drafting the motion and supporting documents and anticipates spending another
three drafting reply papers. Id.
 
The
sanctions are reduced due to the simplicity of the motions and because there is
no requirement for a meet and confer, no basis to grant sanctions for that
time, no opposition was filed (so no reply), and the motions will be heard
jointly. Additionally,
some of the work seems duplicative. As to each motion, sanctions are
granted in the amount of $1,000, based on 2 hours of work at the hourly rate of
$500 (the average of the two rates requested), a total of $2,000. 
 
The
motions are GRANTED. Judgment debtors to serve verified responses without
objections and to pay sanctions of $2,000 within 20 days.
