```

And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has reviewed the motion for terminating sanctions filed by the defendant, State Bank of India, against the plaintiffs, Tatiana Vershinina and Sunoil Retail Group. The motion seeks to dismiss the lawsuit due to the plaintiffs' failure to prosecute their case and their failure to appear at a court hearing. The court has considered the parties' arguments and the relevant laws and statutes. The court has determined that the plaintiffs' failures to prosecute their case and to appear at a court hearing were not deliberate and egregious, and therefore, the court will not dismiss the lawsuit. The court also denied the defendant's alternative request for terminating sanctions. The court's ruling is based on the laws and statutes of the State of California.
