Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has ruled on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the defendant. The demurrer was filed in response to the plaintiff's second amended complaint (SAC), which alleges causes of action for breach of written contract, breach of oral contract, and common count causes of action for work, labor, and services rendered.

The court has overruled the demurrer, finding that the SAC states a valid cause of action for breach of written contract and breach of oral contract. The court has also overruled the demurrer as to the common count causes of action for work, labor, and services rendered.

The court has denied the motion to strike, finding that the SAC is not subject to a motion to strike. The court has also denied the motion to strike as to the individual causes of action.

The court has also addressed the issue of the statute of limitations, finding that the causes of action accrued when the defendant failed to pay the plaintiff. The court has also addressed the issue of the meet and confer requirement, finding that the parties did meet and confer in good faith.

Overall, the court has ruled in favor of the plaintiff, finding that the SAC states valid causes of action and that the defendant's demurrer and motion to strike are without merit.
