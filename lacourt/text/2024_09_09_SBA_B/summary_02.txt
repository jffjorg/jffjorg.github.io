And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge is considering the Plaintiff's motion for a new trial due to alleged irregularities in the proceedings. The motion argues that the Court's dismissal of joint venture liability and corporate defendants deprived the Plaintiff of a fair trial. The Court is seeking clarification on the basis for imposing liability on defendants other than Driftwood.

The motion raises several questions, including whether the Court should have granted the Defendant's non-suit motion and whether the jury's verdict of $118,000 would have been different if the joint venture liability had been considered. The motion also questions the evidence supporting the claim that the other entities and individuals had direct liability to the Plaintiff.

The Judge is also considering questions regarding the validity of a 998 offer and the Motion for Attorneys' Fees. The Motion argues that the Plaintiff is entitled to an award of attorneys' fees under § 1430, and that proof of a violation of this statute would establish an element of the other claims.

The Judge is seeking answers to these questions and will issue a final ruling after considering the parties' arguments.
