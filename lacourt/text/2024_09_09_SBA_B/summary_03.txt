And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the motion to compel arbitration and stay the proceedings is GRANTED. The judge finds that the defendant, Unify Financial Federal Credit Union, has met its burden of proving the existence of an arbitration agreement between the parties. The agreement, which was signed by the plaintiff, Willow List, in 2003, requires disputes to be resolved through binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association. The judge also finds that the agreement is enforceable and that it covers the plaintiff's causes of action, which arise out of her account, loan, and relationship with the defendant. The judge has stayed the proceedings and ordered the defendant to give notice of this ruling.
