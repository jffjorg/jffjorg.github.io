Plaintiff 5th St Loft,
LLC’s Motion to Deem Request for Admissions, Set One, Admitted is GRANTED. The court
GRANTS Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions in the reduced amount of
$610.00, payable within 20 days from this Order. 
 
Background
 
On November 17, 2023, Plaintiff 5th St Loft, LCC
(“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Defendants Henry Morris, Fairbanks
Curtis, and Does 1-25 alleging a cause of action for breach of a written lease of
a property located at 312 W. 5th St., R105, Los Angeles, CA 90013. 
 
On May 9, 2024, Defendant Henry Morris (“Morris”)
filed an answer to Plaintiff’s complaint. 
 
On October 2, 2024, Plaintiff moved to deem the
truth of all matters specified in Plaintiff’s Request for Admission Set One,
admitted against Morris. As of October 21, 2024, no opposition has been filed. 
 
Legal Standard
 
When a party fails to serve a
timely response to a request for admission, the party propounding the request
for admission may move for an order to deem the genuineness of any documents
and the truth of any matters specified in the requests admitted. (Code Civ.
Proc., §¿2033.280, subd. (b).) A party who fails to provide a timely response
waives any objection, including one based on privilege or work product. (Id.,
§ 2033.280, subd. (a).) “The court shall make this order, unless it finds that
the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has served,
before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests for
admission that is in substantial compliance with Section  2033.220. It is
mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction… on the party or attorney,
or both, whose failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission
necessitated this motion.” (Id., § 2033.280, subd. (c).) 
 
Discussion
 
Plaintiff
contends to have served Request for Admissions, Set One, on Morris on May 28,
2024. (McConnell Decl., ¶ 2.) Plaintiff contends that Morris responses were due
on July 1, 2024. (Id., ¶ 4.) After not receiving any responses on July
11, 2024, Plaintiff sent Morris a meet and confer letter requesting his
responses by July 22, 2024. (Id., ¶ 5.)  Plaintiff contends that Morris has not provided
any responses. (Id., ¶ 7.) Thus, Plaintiff argues that the court should deem
Plaintiff’s Request for Admissions admitted and award monetary sanctions in the
minimum amount of $1,297.50 against Morris. (Motion, p. 3; McConnell Decl., ¶ 8.)

 
There
is no evidence before the court that would indicate Morris responded to Plaintiff’s
Request for Admissions. 
 
The court
grants Plaintiff’s motion. Plaintiff’s Request for Admissions are deemed
admitted.
 
With
respect to monetary sanctions, the court notes that they are mandatory in
connection with a motion to deem requests for admissions admitted. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).) 
 
That
being said, the court finds that since Plaintiff’s motion is unopposed Plaintiff’s
counsel does not require the additional 1.50 hours to analyze or draft any
opposition and reply papers. The court will therefore award Plaintiff monetary
sanctions in the reduced amount of $610.00, comprised of two total hours of
work preparing this motion and to attend the hearing on this motion, multiplied
by the hourly rate of $275.00, plus the $60.00 filing fee. Said monetary
sanctions must be paid by Morris within 20 days of the court’s order. 
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff
5th St Loft, LLC’s Motion to Deem Request for Admissions, Set One, Admitted GRANTED.
The court GRANTS Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions in the reduced
amount of $610.00.
