And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion of the defendants, Ivan Alberto Rodriguez, Rodjach Investment Properties LLC, and Filipe Rodriguez, to set aside the court order deeming the plaintiff's requests for admissions admitted against them. The defendants had failed to respond to the requests, but argued that their failure was due to the mistake, inadvertence, surprise, and excusable neglect of their prior attorney. The judge found that the defendants had met the requirements for discretionary relief under California Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b), and that their failure to respond was excusable due to their prior attorney's conduct. The motion to set aside the court order is granted, and the defendants' default will be vacated.
