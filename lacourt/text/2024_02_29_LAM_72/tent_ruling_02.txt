Defendant Linda J. Maultsby (“Defendant”) demurs to the
complaint filed by Plaintiff Mural Media, LLC 401K Plan (“Plaintiff”).
 
The Court SUSTAINS Defendant’s demurrer and STAYS this case
pending the resolution of Los Angeles Superior Court Case No. 23STCV21442.
 
The Court sets a status conference for October 16, 2024 at
8:30 a.m. to discuss the status of Case No. 23STCV21442.
 
Background
 
This is an unlawful detainer case. The following facts are
taken from the allegations and attached exhibits in Plaintiff’s Complaint,
except where otherwise noted.
 
Plaintiff is the owner of real property that is legally
described as “Lot 446 of Tract No. 1446, in the City of Los Angeles, County of
Los Angeles, State of California, as per Map recorded in Book 20, Page 34 of
Maps, in the office of the County recorder of said County” (the “Property”).
The Property contains a multi-unit building which is comprised of four units
with the following addresses: (1) 2757 South Mansfield Avenue, Los Angeles, CA
90016; (2) 2759 South Mansfield Avenue, Los Angeles, CA 90016; (3) 5107
Westhaven St., Los Angeles, CA 90016; and (4) 5109 Westhaven St., Los Angeles,
CA 90016.
 
Defendant is a tenant at the Property pursuant to a lease
agreement that pre-dates Plaintiff’s ownership of the Property. Defendant
occupies 2759 South Mansfield Avenue, Los Angeles, CA 90016 (the “Unit”).
 
Plaintiff entered an agreement to sell the Property to a
third party. The third party wished to inspect the Property, including the
Unit. On August 9, 2023, Plaintiff served on Defendant a notice requiring
Defendant to permit an inspection of the Property and Unit. Plaintiff
subsequently delivered a second letter requesting the same, on an unspecified
date. Defendant did not allow Plaintiff to inspect the Property and the Unit.
 
Plaintiff alleges that on August 11, 2023 and August 24,
2023, Plaintiff served a written notice on Defendant to allow the inspections
of the Property and Unit or quit and deliver possession of the Property and
Unit to Plaintiff within three days. (Complaint, Ex. 2 (the “August 24 Notice”.)
Plaintiff only attaches a copy of the August 24, 2023 notice, and not the
August 11, 2023 notice. Exhibit 2 does not contain a request that Defendant
permit inspection of the Property and Unit. Rather, Exhibit 2 states that
Defendant’s right to occupy the Unit will be terminated because the Property
was sold at a non-judicial foreclosure sale on May 9, 2023.
 
On September 1, 2023, Plaintiff filed a complaint against
Defendant in the Superior Court for the County of Los Angeles Stanley Mosk
Courthouse, Department 78, Case No. 23STCV21442 (the “Department 78 Action”),
raising a claim for unlawful detainer. (Request for Judicial Notice, Ex. A.)
The complaint in the Department 78 Action seeks restitution and possession of
the Property and Unit, damages, and costs of suit. The complaint in the
Department 78 action attaches as Exhibit 2 a three-day notice to quit that was
served on August 24, 2023 and is identical to the August 24 Notice attached as
Exhibit 2 in this action.
 
On October 20, 2023, Plaintiff filed this action (the
“Department 72 Action”), raising a claim against Plaintiff for unlawful
detainer. The Complaint seeks restitution of the Unit, damages, and costs of
suit.
 
Defendant demurred to the Complaint in this action on
January 31, 2024. Defendant filed an opposition and Plaintiff filed a reply.
 
Request for Judicial Notice
 
The Court grants Defendant’s request for judicial notice.
 
Legal Standard
 
As a general matter, in a demurrer proceeding, the defects
must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial
notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins.
Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) “A demurrer tests the pleading
alone, and not the evidence or facts alleged.” (E-Fab, Inc. v. Accountants,
Inc. Servs. (2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 1308, 1315.) The court assumes the truth
of the complaint’s properly pleaded or implied factual allegations. (Ibid.) The only issue a demurrer is
concerned with is whether the complaint, as it stands, states a cause of
action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)
 
Where a demurrer is sustained, leave to amend must be
allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335,
348.) The burden is on the plaintiff to show the court that a pleading can be
amended successfully. (Ibid.;
Lewis v. YouTube, LLC (2015) 244 Cal.App.4th 118, 226.) However, “[i]f
there is any reasonable possibility that the plaintiff can state a good cause
of action, it is error to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend.” (Youngman v. Nevada Irrigation Dist.
(1969) 70 Cal.2d 240, 245).
 
Discussion
 
“Under the rule of exclusive concurrent jurisdiction, when
two [California] superior courts have concurrent jurisdiction over the subject
matter and all parties involved in litigation, the first to assume jurisdiction
has exclusive and continuing jurisdiction over the subject matter and all
parties involved until such time as all necessarily related matters have been
resolved.” (People ex rel. Garamendi v. American Autoplan, Inc. (1993)
20 Cal.App.4th 760, 769-770 [internal quotations and citations omitted].)
“[T]he pendency of another earlier action growing out of the same transaction
and between the same parties is a ground for abatement of the second action.” (Id.
at 770 [internal quotations and citations omitted].) “The rule is based upon
the public policies of avoiding conflicts that might arise between courts if
they were free to make contradictory decisions or awards relating to the same
controversy and preventing vexatious litigation and multiplicity of suits.” (Shaw
v. Superior Court of Contra Costa County (2022) 78 Cal.App.5th 245, 255
[internal citations omitted].) 
 
The rule of exclusive concurrent jurisdiction and the
statutory plea in abatement should be raised by demurrer where the issue
appears on the face of the complaint and by answer where factual issues must be
resolved. (Garamendi, supra, 20 Cal.App.4th at p. 771.) “Where
abatement is required [under the plea in abatement or the rule of exclusive
concurrent jurisdiction], the second action should be stayed, not dismissed.” (Ibid.)
 
Furthermore, "[a] party against whom a complaint has
been filed may object to the pleading on the grounds that “[t] is another
action pending between the same parties on the same cause of action.” (Code
Civ. Proc. § 430.10, subd. (c).)
 
          Here,
the Department 78 Action concerns the same Property and Unit, the same
Plaintiff and Defendant, and the same three-day notice to quit. Thus, this
action arises out of the same transaction and subject matter as the Department
78 Action. Plaintiff does not contest this in its opposition, but instead
argues that the existence of the Department 78 action has no bearing on
Plaintiff’s ability to state a claim for unlawful detainer. Plaintiff’s
argument misses the point – abatement is a separate basis for demurrer from
failure to state a claim, with a separate remedy (abatement – rather than
dismissal).
 
Because the Department 78 Action was filed first in time,
and Department 78 is therefore the first court to assume jurisdiction over this
subject matter, this case must be stayed pending the resolution of the
Department 78 action to avoid conflicting rulings.
