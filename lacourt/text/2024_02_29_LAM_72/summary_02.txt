Summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the Defendant's demurrer is sustained, and the case is stayed pending the resolution of the Department 78 Action. The Judge finds that the Department 78 Action was filed first in time and has exclusive and continuing jurisdiction over the subject matter and parties involved. The Judge orders a status conference for October 16, 2024 to discuss the status of the Department 78 Action. The Judge concludes that the rule of exclusive concurrent jurisdiction and the statutory plea in abatement require the case to be stayed to avoid conflicting rulings.
