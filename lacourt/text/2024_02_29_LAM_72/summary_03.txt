And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is granting New Era Escrow's motion to strike the demand for attorney's fees in the complaint filed by Plaintiff Rosalie Genus. However, the judge is granting Plaintiff leave to amend the complaint to assert an attorney's fee claim against defendants other than New Era. The judge is ruling that New Era is not a party to the Escrow Instructions and therefore is not subject to the attorney's fees clause. The judge is also taking judicial notice of the facts in the case.
