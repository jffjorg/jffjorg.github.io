And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's motion to vacate the default and default judgment entered against them. The plaintiff, Azuka Egun, had sought to set aside the default judgment and restart the case. The judge found that the plaintiff's motion was insufficient and that there was no basis to set aside the prior rulings and restart the case. The judge noted that the plaintiff had failed to comply with a court order to arbitrate and had failed to prosecute their case, and that they had not appeared at a trial on a cross-claim. The judge also found that the plaintiff's claims were barred by California Code of Civil Procedure section 473, which sets a six-month time limit for seeking to set aside a judgment. The judge concluded that the plaintiff's motion was untimely and that there was no sufficient basis to set aside the prior rulings and restart the case.
