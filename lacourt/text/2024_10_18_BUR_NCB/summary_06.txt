And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the City of Los Angeles' motion for reconsideration of the court's order granting the Pitchess motion, which compelled the production of Officer Lopez's personnel records. The City argued that the court should only require the production of "potentially relevant" documents, citing the case of People v. Mooc. The court found that the Mooc case does not constitute "new or different" law that warrants reconsideration, and that the City's arguments merely rehash the same arguments it made in opposing the Pitchess motion. The court intends to review the entire personnel file of Officer Lopez with the aid of the custodian of records to determine what information is potentially relevant and discoverable. If the City intends to withhold production of documents at the in camera review, it must provide a specific description of such documents. If the City asserts any privileges, it must provide a privilege log, which describes the documents under oath and the privilege claimed, so that the court may determine whether the document should be withheld based on privilege and should be reviewed or not.
