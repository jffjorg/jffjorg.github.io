**Summary**

This Tentative Ruling is regarding a motion for an award of post-judgment attorney's fees filed by Plaintiff Christo J. Halekakis against Defendants Nico Halekakis aka Nick J. Halekakis and Megan T. Lorick Halekakis. The Plaintiff is seeking attorney's fees in the amount of $256,725, which was incurred by his counsel Eric A. Schreiber and Edwin C. Schreiber. The Defendants argue that the requested attorney's fees are unreasonable.

The Court finds that the Plaintiff is the prevailing party in the action and is entitled to attorney's fees. However, the Court reduces the hourly rates of Plaintiff's counsel from $350 to $400 per hour and reduces the hours billed by Plaintiff's counsel. The Court also reduces the hours billed by Edwin Schreiber, as most of the work performed by him was in connection with trial preparation, attending the trial, and reviewing and editing the closing trial brief.

The Court awards attorney's fees in the amount of $155,155.00 to the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff shall provide notice of this order.
