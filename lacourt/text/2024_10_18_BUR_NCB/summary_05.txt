```

And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has tentatively ruled that Defendant 7-Eleven, Inc.'s motion for summary judgment will be continued to January 31, 2025, due to the need for further discovery and deposition scheduling. The Judge finds that the parties have not yet identified the cashier who allegedly assaulted and battered Plaintiff Marco Morales, and that additional discovery is necessary to determine who trained and supervised the employee, as well as to obtain information regarding Defendant's exercise of discretion to control the store under the franchise agreement. The Judge orders that the parties conduct written discovery, identify the employee of the store at the time of the incident, and schedule depositions before the motion can be heard.
