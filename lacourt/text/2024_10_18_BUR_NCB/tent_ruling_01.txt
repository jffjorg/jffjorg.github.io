  No.: 21BBCV00565
 
  Hearing Date:  October 18, 2024
 
 [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
motion for an award of post-judgment attorney’s fees 
 



 
BACKGROUND
A.    Relevant
Background
The trial
occurred on May 6 and 7, 2024.  
On August 5,
2024, the Court issued its Final Statement of Decision and entered Judgment in
this matter.  Judgment was entered in
favor of Plaintiff Christo J. Halekakis and against Defendants Nico Halekakis
aka Nick J. Halekakis and Megan T. Lorick Halekakis fka Megan T. Lorick for the
amount of $834,718.50.  The Court found Plaintiff to be
the prevailing party and stated that Plaintiff may recover attorneys’ fees by
motion and costs by Bill of Costs.   
B.     Motion
on Calendar 
On August 20,
2024, Plaintiff filed a motion for an award of post-judgment attorney’s fees
pursuant to Penal Code, § 496 in the amount of $256,725 against Defendant Nico
Halekakis and Megan Halekakis (“Defendants”). 

On October 4,
2024, Defendants filed an opposition brief.
On October 11,
2024, Plaintiff filed a reply brief. 
DISCUSSION
A.   
      Entitlement to
Attorney’s Fees
Plaintiff moves
for attorney’s fees pursuant to Penal Code, § 496.  
Penal Code, § 496 states in relevant
part: 
(a)
Every person who buys or receives any property that has been stolen or that has
been obtained in any manner constituting theft or extortion, knowing the
property to be so stolen or obtained, or who conceals, sells, withholds, or
aids in concealing, selling, or withholding any property from the owner,
knowing the property to be so stolen or obtained, shall be punished by
imprisonment in a county jail for not more than one year, or imprisonment
pursuant to subdivision (h) of Section 1170. …
…
(c)
Any person who has been injured by a violation of subdivision (a) or (b) may
bring an action for three times the amount of actual damages, if any, sustained
by the plaintiff, costs of suit, and reasonable attorney's fees.
 
(Pen.
Code, § 496(a), (c).)  
Here,
there is a statutory basis for attorney’s fees in this action.  Plaintiff is the prevailing party on the 1st
cause of action for cancellation of instrument and damages.  The Court awarded treble damages pursuant to
Penal Code, § 496 in connection with the 1st cause of action.  Plaintiff was also deemed the prevailing
party in the Judgment. 
Defendants
do not dispute that Plaintiff is the prevailing party in this action or that he
is entitled to attorney’s fees pursuant to Penal Code, § 496.  Instead, Defendants argue that Plaintiff is
only entitled to “reasonable” fees.  
B.    
Reasonableness of Attorney’s Fees 
In support of the
request for attorney’s fees in the amount of $256,725, Plaintiff provides the
declaration of counsel Eric A. Schreiber. 

Eric Schreiber
states that Plaintiff retained him for this action in May 2021 and that the
billing only reflects the work he has done for Plaintiff in connection with
this case (and not other litigation or probate matters).  (Eric Schreiber Decl., ¶2.)  He states that there were some delays in the
action when Defendants were in pro per, retained various counsel who withdrew,
and that they ultimately retained Brian Ramsey for trial.  (Id., ¶¶3-4.)  Eric Schreiber states that most of the time
spent in the litigation was from August 2023 to the present for law and motion
practice and trial preparation.  (Id.,
¶4.)  He states that there were no
depositions taken or experts designated and that the trial lasted one and a
half days.  (Id.)  Eric Schreiber states that he (28 years of
experience) attended trial with Edwin C. Schreiber (58 years of experience) on
behalf of Plaintiff.  (Id., ¶5,
Ex. B [Billing Records].)  He states his
hourly rate was $350/hour from May 2021 to December 31, 2022; $575/hour from
January 1, 2023; and $750/hour from January 1, 2024.  (Id., ¶6.)  He states that Edwin C. Schreiber’s hourly
rate was $795/hour from January 1, 2024. 
(Id.)  He states that the
rates are reasonable in the Los Angeles area given their experience and qualifications.  (Id., Ex. A [Eric Schreiber and Edwin
Schreiber’s C.V.s].)  
According to the
billing records, Plaintiff’s counsel is seeking to recover fees for 463.2 hours
billed from hourly rates ranging from $350/hour to $795/hour.  The billing records state that Plaintiff’s
counsel has incurred $286,809.50 in attorney’s fees for work performed from May
18, 2021 to August 14, 2024, but Plaintiff is seeking $256,725 by way of this
motion.  
In opposition,
Defendants argue that the requested attorney’s fees are unreasonable on their
face and in the time actually billed.  Defendants
argue that certain entries should be reduced with reduced billing rates for a
total reduction of $127,330 (Opp. at pp. 4-15), or that all hours should be
accepted but hourly rates reduced for a total reduction of $93,532 (Opp. at
p.16).  
The Court finds
the hourly rates of Plaintiff’s counsel Eric Schreiber to be higher than
reasonable for this case.  While the
Court will allow Eric Schreiber’s billing rate of $350/hour from May 2021 to
December 31, 2022, the Court will reduce the billing rates from January 2023 to
the present to $400/hour.  The Court will
allow the $795 hourly rate of Edwin Schreiber from January 1, 2024 to the
present, but will reduce his hours as most of the work performed by Edwin
Schreiber was in connection with trial preparation, attending the trial with
Eric Schreiber, and reviewing and editing the closing trial brief—tasks all of
which Eric Schreiber handled as well.  
The
Court has reviewed the billing records and Defendants’ suggested
reduction.  The Court reduces the hours
billed as follows:
·        
$350/hour billing
rate from May 2021 to December 31, 2022 for Eric Schreiber: 
o   May to June 2021: 4-hour reduction for preparation of
the complaint and service documents.  
o   January 12, 2022: 3-hour reduction for client meeting
regarding discovery. 
o   June 21, 2022: 1-hour reduction for contacting counsel
and preparing a stipulation to continue trial. 
o   The total amount of hours spent by Eric Schreiber from
May 2021 to December 2022 is 111.3 hours. 
The Court will reduce 8 hours, for a total of 103.3 recoverable hours at
$350/hour.  This totals $36,155.  
·        
$400/hour billing
rate from January 1, 2023 to the present for Eric Schreiber:  
o   January 26 and 28, 2023: 1-hour reduction for
contacting counsel and preparing a stipulation to continue trial. 
o   September 13, 2023: 3-hour reduction for preparing
discovery responses and meeting with client.
o   October 23, 2023: 1.6-hour reduction to research new
defense counsel.
o   November to December 2023: 3-hour reduction for
reviewing motion for leave to file cross-complaint, prepare opposition, review
reply, review tentative order, and prepare/attend hearing.
o   January 30, 2024: 1.5-hour reduction to research new
defense counsel. 
o   April to May 2024: 8-hour reduction for trial
preparation matters. 
o   May 6 and7, 2024: 16-hour reduction for Eric
Schreiber’s attendance at trial, as Edwin Schreiber was the lead trial counsel
on this matter. 
o   May to June 2024: 15-hour reduction for closing
argument brief preparation.  
o   July 2024: 2-hour reduction for research on new trial
and post judgment remedies. 
o   August 2024: 8-hour reduction to prepare motion for
attorney’s fees. 
o   The total amount of hours spent by Eric Schreiber from
January 1, 2023 to the present is 324.8 hours. 
The Court will reduce 59.1 hours, for a total of 265.7 recoverable hours
at $400/hour.  This totals $106,280.  
·        
$795/hour billing
rate from January 1, 2024 to the present for Edwin Schreiber:
o   May 20, 2024 and June 10, 2024: 3.6-hour reduction for
closing argument brief, which Eric Schreiber also worked on. 
o   May 3 and 5, 2024: 7.5-hour reduction for trial
preparation. 
o   The total amount of hours spent by Edwin Schreiber
from January 1, 2024 to the present is 27.1 hours.  The Court will only allow the recovery of the
hours incurred by Edwin Scheiber at trial. 
The Court will reduce 11.1 hours, for a total of 16 recoverable hours at
$795/hour.  This totals $12,720.  
Applying these
adjustments, the total amount of attorney’s fees that will be awarded is $155,155.00.
CONCLUSION AND ORDER 
Plaintiff Christo
J. Halekakis’ motion for attorney’s fees against Defendants Nick J. Halekakis
and Megan T. Lorick Halekakis is granted in the amount of $155,155.00. 
Plaintiff
shall provide notice of this order.
