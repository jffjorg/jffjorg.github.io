And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court cannot grant default judgment and must vacate the default of defendant Frank Laaly, D.D.S. The plaintiff, Jose Flores, has not shown proper service of his statement of damages on the defendant. Two reasons support this conclusion. Firstly, the plaintiff filed only one statement of damages, which was dated January 30, 2024, and served by mail, not in the manner as a summons. Secondly, the plaintiff did not prove adequate substituted service on the defendant. The process server made one prior attempt to serve the defendant at 616 N. Sweetzer Ave., #309, Los Angeles, CA 90048, but did not testify that this is the defendant's residence or any other "proper place." The court therefore denies the plaintiff's request for court judgment by default and vacates the default of the defendant.
