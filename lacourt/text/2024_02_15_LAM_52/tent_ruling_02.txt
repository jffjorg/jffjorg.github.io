Judgment
Plaintiff Jaber Original Holdings III, LLC requests clerk’s judgment by
default against defendant Reynosa Espadero. 
Plaintiff’s application meets all requirements for clerk’s judgment by

damages only.”  (CCP § 585(a); see Holloway
v. Quetel (2015) 242 Cal.App.4th 1425, 1432.)
The court
hereby grants plaintiff’s request for default
judgment.  The clerk shall sign the proposed judgment plaintiff
submitted on form JUD-100.
