And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion for security, which required the plaintiff to post an undertaking as an out-of-state resident. The defendants had argued that they had a reasonable possibility of prevailing on the merits of the case, but the judge found that they had failed to provide sufficient evidence to support this claim. The judge noted that the defendants had previously filed a similar motion, which was denied, and that they had not provided any new or different facts or circumstances to support their current motion. The judge also cited California Code of Civil Procedure section 1008, which prohibits the refiling of a substantively identical motion without new or different facts or circumstances. The judge reminded counsel that a violation of this section can be punished as a contempt and with sanctions as allowed by California Code of Civil Procedure section 128.7.
