COMPLAINT
  FILED: JUNE 11, 2021
TRIAL
  DATE: FEBRUARY 5, 2025



 
I.      
BACKGROUND  
This case is a personal
injury action.  Plaintiff Brenton Lamar Griffin (“Plaintiff”) alleges
that, on September 24, 2020, Defendants City of Gardena (“Gardena”), Eugene
Winthrop Warren, Jr., (“Warren”), and Does 1 to 50 (collectively “Defendants”)
negligently operated a city bus and caused it to collide with Plaintiff, who
was operating a motor scooter. Plaintiff alleges severe injuries as a result. 
On June 11, 2021, Plaintiff
filed his original complaint. On March 24, 2022, Plaintiff filed his first
amended complaint (“FAC”) alleging two causes of action: (1) negligence; and
(2) negligent entrustment. 
On October 11, 2022,
Defendant Warren filed a demurrer to Plaintiff’s FAC. The demurrer was
sustained with leave to amend on November 14, 2022. 
On November 28, 2022,
Plaintiff filed his second amended complaint (“SAC”) alleging negligence and
negligent entrustment, with additional facts to support his claims against
Defendant Warren. 
On June 5, 2024, the case
was reassigned to the Honorable Karen Moskowitz in Department B at Van Nuys
Courthouse East, effective June 24, 2024. 
On September 4, 2024,
Defendants filed the instant motion for security pursuant to Cal. Code of Civ.
Proc. § 1030. 
On October 15, 2024,
Plaintiff filed his opposition. 
On October 21, 2024,
Defendants filed their reply. 
 
II.         
LEGAL
STANDARDS 
Where a plaintiff in an
action resides out of the state, the defendant may, at any time, apply to the
court for an order requiring the plaintiff to file an undertaking to secure an
award of costs and attorney’s fees which may be awarded in the action. (CCP
§ 1030(a).) The motion shall be made on grounds that the plaintiff resides
out-of-state and there is a reasonable possibility that the moving defendant
will obtain judgment in their favor. (CCP § 1030 (b).) The motion shall be
accompanied by an affidavit in support of the grounds for the motion and
setting forth the nature and amount of costs and attorney’s fees the defendant
has incurred and expects to incur. (Ibid.) 
“The purpose of [§1030] is
to enable a California resident sued by an out-of-state resident to secure
costs in light of the difficulty of enforcing a judgment for costs against a
person who is not within the court’s jurisdiction.” (Alshafie v. Lallande
(2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 421, 428.) The moving party is not required to show the
impossibility that an out-of-state plaintiff will prevail at trial, but
rather the reasonable possibility of moving party’s prevailance. (Baltayan
v. Estate of Getemyan (2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 1427, 1432.) This reasonable
possibility must be demonstrated through “substantial evidence.” (Ibid. at
1433.) 
If the motion is granted,
the plaintiff shall file the undertaking no later than 30 days after service of
the court’s order, and if plaintiff fails to timely file the undertaking, the
plaintiff’s action shall be dismissed as to the moving defendant. (CCP §
1030(d).) 
 
III.      
DISCUSSION 
Defendants move for an order
requiring Plaintiff to post an undertaking as an out-of-state resident
under CCP §1030 in the total amount of $82,278.82. (Memorandum of Points and
Authorities, p. 7.) 
Judicial Notice 
Plaintiff’s October 15,
2024, request for judicial notice of the Court’s ruling on Defendants’ November
2023 motion for security is denied. Judicial notice of the Court’s own case
file is redundant as the Court can always review the case at hand. 
Plaintiff’s Residency 
It is undisputed that
Plaintiff is and was a resident of Indiana both at the time of the underlying
incident and at present. (Dumont Decl. ¶ 4; Exh. B [Plaintiff’s Responses to
Form Interrogatories] No. 2.5.) Defendants are therefore allowed to proceed with
their motion under § 1030. (See CCP § 1030(a).) 
Defendants’ Probability of Prevailing on the Merits 
For Defendants to prevail on
their motion to compel Plaintiff’s posting of an undertaking, they must show
the reasonable possibility of their meritorious defense to Plaintiff’s causes
of action. (See Baltayan, supra, 90 Cal.App.4th at 1432.) This
reasonable possibility must be shown through “substantial evidence.” (Ibid.
at 1433.) As a defense to each cause of action pleaded in the SAC, Defendants
assert that Plaintiff’s own negligence caused the underlying incident and, due
to Plaintiff’s unlicensed operation of a motor scooter, Plaintiff is barred
from recovering any non-economic losses. 
To establish negligence, "[plaintiff] must allege facts sufficient to show a
legal duty on the part of the defendant to use due care, a breach of such legal
duty, and the breach as the proximate or legal cause of the resulting
injury." (Bellah v. Greenson (1978) 81 Cal.App.3d 614, 619.)
Contributory negligence may serve as a partial or full defense to negligence. (Mason
v. Case (1963) 220 Cal.App.2d 170, 178.) 
Here, Plaintiff’s claim
arises from a September 24, 2020, incident, in which Plaintiff alleges he was
operating a motor scooter eastbound in the number two lane of Redondo Beach
Boulevard and attempted to maneuver into the right lane when a Gardena city bus,
operated by Defendant Warren, suddenly and without warning veered in front of
Plaintiff, colliding with Plaintiff’s motor scooter. (SAC ¶ 21.) The incident
caused Plaintiff to suffer severe injuries. (Ibid. at ¶ 22.) Defendants
argue a reasonable possibility of prevailing on the merits because (1)
Plaintiff was contributorily negligent by recklessly operating the motor
scooter and (2) Plaintiff’s status as an unlicensed motorist bars him from
recovery for non-economic injuries under Cal. Veh. Code § 16028(a). As
evidence, Defendants rely on Plaintiff’s response to Defendants’ request for
production of documents, including the traffic collision report and information
regarding the subject motor scooter. (Dumont Decl. ¶ 5.)  
This evidence is the same
which Defendants relied upon in their November 20, 2023, motion for security.
The Court denied that motion on the grounds that Defendants failed to set forth
sufficient evidence. (See December 19, 2023, Minute Order.) CCP § 1008
governs the ability to refile substantively identical motions after one was denied,
providing in part: 
 
“(b) A
party who originally made an application for an order which was refused in
whole  or part, or granted conditionally
or on terms, may make a subsequent application for the        same order upon new or different facts, circumstances, or
law, in which case it shall be         shown by affidavit what application was made before, when
and to what judge, what  order
or decisions were made, and what new or different facts, circumstances, or law
are       claimed to be shown. For a
failure to comply with this subdivision, any order made on a        subsequent application may be revoked or set aside on ex
parte motion.” 
(CCP
§ 1008(b).) 
Here,
Defendants provide no affidavit detailing what new or different facts give rise
to the instant motion. In fact, the previous motion and the instant motion are
largely identical. Accordingly, Defendants’ motion must be denied.
IV.   
CONCLUSION
            Defendants’ motion is DENIED
pursuant to CCP § 1008 with prejudice. The court reminds counsel that a  violation of CCP § 1008 may be punished as a
contempt and with sanctions as allowed by CCP § 128.7. (CCP § 1008(d).) 
            Moving party to give notice.
