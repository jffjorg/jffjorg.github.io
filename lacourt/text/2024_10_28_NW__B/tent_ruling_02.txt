Plaintiff Tavit Hallajian’s Request for Default
Judgment
 
Defendants: Beatriz Stephani Delgado and
Maria del Rosario Chavez Aguilar
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
Plaintiff Tavit Hallajian’s request for
default judgment is GRANTED.
            
BACKGROUND
 
This action arises from a December 28, 2019,
motor vehicle accident in which Plaintiff Tavit Hallajian (“Plaintiff”) alleges
Defendants Beatriz Stephani Delgado (“Delgado”), Maria del Rosario Chavez
Aguilar (“Aguilar”), and Does 1 to 20 (collectively “Defendants”), negligently
operating their motor vehicle, collided with Plaintiff’s motor vehicle and
caused Plaintiff to sustain injuries and property damage.
 
On December 23, 2021, Plaintiff filed a
complaint against Defendants alleging two causes of action for: (1) motor
vehicle negligence; and (2) general negligence.
 
Defendant Delgado entered default on
April 11, 2024, and Defendant Aguilar entered default on April 16, 2024.
 
On June 6, 2024, the case was reassigned
to the Honorable Karen Moskowitz in Department B at Van Nuys Courthouse East,
effective June 24, 2024.
 
On October 8, 2024, Plaintiff filed the
instant request for default judgment against both Defendants.
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 585
permits entry of a default judgment after a party has failed to timely respond
or appear. (Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. § 585.) A party seeking judgment on the
default by the court must file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a brief
summary of the case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in support
of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4) a
memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) declaration of nonmilitary status;
(6) a proposed form of judgment; (7) a dismissal of all parties against whom
judgment is not sought or an application for separate judgment under CCP § 579,
supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; (8) exhibits as necessary;
and (9) a request for attorney’s fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement
of the parties. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1800.) 
 
ANALYSIS
 
Plaintiff seeks damages in the amount of
$50,414.00 in general and special damages.
 
Defendants have failed to timely respond
or appear. Plaintiff’s default packet meets all statutory requirements under
CCP § 585. Therefore, Plaintiff’s request for default judgment against
Defendants Beatriz Stephani Delgado and Maria del Rosario Chavez Aguilar is
GRANTED.
 
Moving party is ordered to give notice.
