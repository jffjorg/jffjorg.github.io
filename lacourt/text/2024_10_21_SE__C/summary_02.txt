And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by the judge in a personal injury action case between C Lara and Parsec, Inc. The case was filed on February 27, 2023, and the trial is scheduled for February 10, 2025. The defendant, Parsec, Inc., filed a motion for summary judgment on October 16, 2024, but the earliest available hearing date was January 15, 2025, which is less than 30 days before the trial. The defendant applied ex parte to advance the hearing date to no later than 30 days before the trial or to continue the trial date. The judge denied the defendant's request to advance the hearing date, citing the court's congested calendar. The judge also denied the defendant's alternative request to continue the trial date without prejudice, meaning the defendant can refile the request if an agreement or stipulation is reached with the plaintiff.
