 Case Number:  23NWCV00614    Hearing Date:   October 21, 2024    Dept:  C Lara v. Parsec, Inc.
23NWCV00614
 
This personal injury action
was filed on February 27, 2023.  Trial is scheduled for February 10,
2025.  Defendant PARSEC, INC. timely filed and served a Motion for Summary
Judgment on October 16, 2024, but the earliest hearing date available was
January 15, 2025.  This date is less than 30 days before trial and thus
does not comply with CCP§437c(a)(3).  Defendant applies ex parte to
advance the hearing date on the Motion for Summary Judgment to be heard no
later than 30 days before trial, or alternatively, to continue the trial
date.  Defendant PARSEC, INC.'s Ex Parte Application to Advance the Motion
for Summary Judgment is DENIED. The Court's congested calendar cannot
accommodate Defendant's request.  Absent agreement/stipulation of all
parties, Defendant's alternative request to continue trial is DENIED without
prejudice. This request is properly filed in Dept. SE-F. Moving party
to give notice.
