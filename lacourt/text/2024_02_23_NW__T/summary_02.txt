Significant Statements:
  - The Court must determine whether the third party would in fact benefit from the contract, but also whether a motivating purpose of the contracting parties was to provide a benefit to the third party, and whether permitting a third party to bring its own breach of contract action against a contracting party is consistent with the objectives of the contract and the reasonable expectations of the contracting parties.
  - The APA is seen to potentially provide Plaintiff with a benefit in that Plaintiff could continue to receive rental payments if Defendants performed the APA's contingency to assume the existing lease.
  - The Court does not find that Plaintiff's breach of contract claim is consistent with the objectives of the APA or the expectations of Stankov Corp. and Defendants because Section 2.4 of the APA does not require Defendants to assume the Lease or enter a new Lease with Plaintiff.

Summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (MSJ) and Alternative Motion for Summary Adjudication (MSA) in part. The Court finds that Defendant's MSA Issue 2, 4, 5, and 7-9 are granted, while MSA Issue 10 and 11 are denied. The Court also denies Plaintiff's request for a continuance to complete discovery regarding a subpoena served upon third party, Dental Strategies.

The Judge's ruling is based on the facts presented in the motion and the separate statement, as well as the applicable laws and statutes. The Court finds that there are triable issues of fact as to whether a promise was made to pay rent, and whether Defendants are in rightful possession of the Premise. The Court also finds that Defendant's lack of diligence in complying with the requirements of the statute and failing to show due diligence in opposing the motion justifies the denial of the request for continuance.
