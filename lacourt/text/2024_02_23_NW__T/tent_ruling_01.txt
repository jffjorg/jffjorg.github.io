  Case Number:  22VECV01048    Hearing Date:   February 23, 2024    Dept:  T 22VECV01048
Brown v Liberty
 
Ex parte
application:  If the only reason for the continuance
is scheduling, there is no basis to continue the discovery cutoff. The court
may grant a limited extension of discovery solely for demand and designation of
experts.  However, there is no basis for
continuing the depositions and written discovery cutoff given that there are 3
more months before the discovery cutoff. 
The court is not inclined to grant a 7 month continuance of a trial solely
for scheduling problems.
