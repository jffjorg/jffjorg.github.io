* "The burden then shifts to Plaintiff to show a defense to enforcement."
* "The Court determines whether an arbitration agreement exists and State law applicable to contracts governs."
* "The provision in the arbitration agreement's 'Covered Claims' clause expressly provided a clear and unmistakable agreed to have the arbitrator decide the issue of arbitrability."
* "Because Plaintiff failed to meet her burden to defend against enforcement of the arbitration agreement, the motion is persuasive."
