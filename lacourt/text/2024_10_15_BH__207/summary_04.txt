And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the City of Santa Monica's demurrer to the Second Amended Complaint filed by Arezou Mary Alipourfereshteh (Plaintiff). The City demurred to the complaint on the grounds that Plaintiff failed to submit a government claim and did not allege a statutory basis for relief.

The judge found that Plaintiff had adequately alleged a cause of action for general negligence against the City for the negligent maintenance of the sidewalk by its Doe defendant employee(s), as authorized by Government Code section 815.2, and for premises liability against the City, as authorized by Government Code section 835.

The judge denied the City's request for judicial notice of the fact that the City's records do not show Plaintiff submitting a government claim. The judge also found that Plaintiff had complied with the claims presentation requirements and that the City's failure to maintain the public sidewalk in a safe condition was a proximate cause of Plaintiff's injuries.

The judge overruled the City's demurrer and ordered the City to file and serve an answer to the Second Amended Complaint on or before October 29, 2024.
