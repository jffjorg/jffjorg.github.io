MOTIONS
 
            This case arises from a dispute
concerning an unlawful detainer.  The
Court entered judgment in favor of Plaintiff SM 10000 Property LLC
(“Plaintiff”) on March 2, 2022.  
 
            Plaintiff now moves to compel further
responses from Defendant Paul Roberts (“Defendant”) to Requests for Production,
Set 1 (“RPD”) and Special Interrogatories, Set 1 (“SROG”) regarding
post-judgment discovery.  Plaintiff also
requests monetary sanctions in connection with the motions.  The motions are unopposed. 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
2030.290, “[i]f a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a
timely response . . . [t]he party to whom the interrogatories are directed
waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under Section
2030.230, as well as any objection to the interrogatories, including one based
on privilege or the protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing
with Section 2018.010.  . . .   [and] The party propounding the
interrogatories may move for an order compelling response to the
interrogatories.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subds.
(a)-(b).)  
 
           
Similarly, under Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.300, “[i]f a party to
whom a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed fails
to serve a timely response to it . . . [t]he party to whom the demand for
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed waives any objection to
the demand, including one based on privilege or on the protection for work product
under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010.  . . .  
[and] The party making the demand may move for an order compelling response to
the demand.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subds. (a)-(b).)  
 
ANALYSIS
 
1.    
Motions to Compel
 
Plaintiff electronically served the RPD and SROG on counsel for Defendant
on April 12, 2023.  (Ishu Decl. ¶ 4 and
Ex. 1.)  Plaintiff’s responses were thus
due by May 15, 2023.  As of the filing
date of the motions, Plaintiff has not received any responses from Plaintiff to
the RPD or SROG.  (Ishu Decl. ¶ 5.)  Accordingly, the Court finds that Defendant
has failed to serve timely responses to the RPD and SROG.
 
2.    
Monetary Sanctions
Plaintiff
requests monetary sanctions in connection with the two motions.  The Court finds Defendant’s failure to timely
respond to the RPD and SROG to be abuses of the discovery process, warranting
monetary sanctions.  (See Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 2030.290,
subd. (c); 2031.300, subd. (c).)  Accordingly, the
Court will impose monetary sanctions against Defendant, in the amount of $1,100,
which represents three hours of attorney time to prepare the moving papers, and
one hour to attend the hearing, at $275 per hour.
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
Therefore, the Court grants Plaintiff’s
motions to compel Defendant’s responses to the RPD and SROG per Code of
Civil Procedure sections 2030.290 and 2031.300. 
As such, the Court orders Defendant to serve verified responses to the
RPD and SROG, without objections, within 30 days of notice of the Court’s
order.
 
Further,
the Court orders Defendant to pay monetary sanctions in the amount $1,100 to Plaintiff,
by and through counsel for Plaintiff, within 30 days of notice of the Court’s
orders. 
 
Plaintiff shall provide notice
of the Court’s orders and file the notice with a proof of service forthwith.
