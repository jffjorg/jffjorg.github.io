Significant Statements:

  - "the defendant there had reason to believe that the plaintiff's failure to opt-out meant he assented to arbitration"
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the arguments presented by both parties and has found that the plaintiff's argument that the defendant cannot cite a single California case upholding opt-out agreements in arbitration is unfounded. The defendant has, in fact, cited several cases, including Securitas Sec. Serv. USA, Inc. v. Superior Court, Craig v. Brown & Root, and Mitchell v. Am. Fair Credit Ass'n. The judge also notes that the plaintiff's own reliance on Gentry is misplaced, as the court in that case found that the opt-out provision was enforceable because it was not inconspicuous or difficult to understand.

The judge further notes that the defendant sent email reminders to the plaintiff to opt-out of the arbitration agreement, and that the plaintiff's argument that he could not know that "the Company" referred to Pacific Bell is disingenuous. The judge rejects this argument, pointing out that the plaintiff identifies Pacific Bell & Telephone Co as his employer from 2011-2023, and that he received the Mandatory Arbitration Agreement (MAA) on January 25, 2021.

Based on these findings, the judge intends to rule in favor of the defendant and uphold the enforceability of the opt-out provision in the arbitration agreement.
