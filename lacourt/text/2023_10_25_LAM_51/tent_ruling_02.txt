Plaintiff argues that Moving Defendant “cannot cite one single case
from California upholding opt-out agreement in arbitration” but Moving
Defendant has, in fact, cited several. (Securitas
Sec. Serv. USA, Inc. v. Superior Court, (2015) 234 Cal.App.4th 1109; Craig v. Brown & Root, (2000) 84
Cal.App.4th 416; Mitchell v. Am. Fair
Credit Ass’n (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 1345.) Indeed, Plaintiff’s own reliance
on Gentry is misplaced because the
Court there found that the opt-out provision was enforceable because it was
neither inconspicuous or difficult to understand and that the plaintiff
“manifested his intent to use . . . his failure to opt-out, as a means of
accepting the arbitration agreement.” (Gentry,
supra, at p. 468.) Put differently, the defendant there had reason to
believe that the plaintiff’s failure to opt-out meant he assented to
arbitration. (Ibid.)

Indeed, Moving Defendant apparently sent email reminders three more times:
February 8, 2021, February 22, 2021, and March 8, 2021. (Giordano Decl. Exhibit
4.)

The court reads Plaintiff’s argument that he could not know “the Company” referred
to Pacific Bell as disingenuous and rejects it for several reasons. First, he
identifies Pacific Bell & Telephone Co as his employer from 2011 through
March 2023. (See, generally, Complaint.) Since he received the MAA on January
25, 2021, by his own allegations, he was working for Moving Defendant. (Giordano
Decl., Exhibit 1.) Second, Plaintiff groups Pacific Bell & Telephone Co.
and AT&T Services, Inc. in the same paragraph for identification purposes
in his Complaint. (Compl. ¶ 2.) Third, the MAA clearly states that “you and the
AT&T company that employs you . . . agree” which is not the parade of
parties Plaintiff proposes. Indeed, the clause Plaintiff refers to indicating
the numerous parties is part of the MAA that discusses the claims covered – not
the contracting parties. (Giordano Decl., Exhibit 2.)
