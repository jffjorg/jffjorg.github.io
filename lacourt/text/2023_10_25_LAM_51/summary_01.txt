And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge granted the motion to compel arbitration filed by Pacific Bell Telephone Company, staying the action pending arbitration. The court found that the Management Arbitration Agreement (MAA) between the parties is enforceable and applies to the subject dispute. The judge rejected the plaintiff's arguments that the MAA is an "opt-out" agreement and that it is ambiguous as to which parties it applies. The court concluded that the plaintiff did not opt-out of the MAA and that the contract terms are clear and unambiguous.
