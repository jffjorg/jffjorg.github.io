English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses a motion filed by Plaintiffs' counsel, Boris Sargsyan, to be relieved as counsel due to an irreconcilable breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. The motion was filed without opposition. The judge finds that the breakdown of the relationship is a valid reason for withdrawal. However, the judge orders Counsel to file an amended proposed order within 5 calendar days of the hearing, including information about all future hearings and proceedings noticed by any party. Counsel must also serve the signed orders within 10 days of the date of the order and file a proof of service. The motion is conditionally granted pending Counsel's compliance with these requirements.
