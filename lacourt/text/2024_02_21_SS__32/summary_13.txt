And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for judgment on the pleadings filed by the defendant. The defendant argues that the plaintiff, Erika Dominguez, passed away on September 14, 2020, and therefore lacks standing to sue. However, the judge finds that the motion for judgment on the pleadings is denied because the plaintiff, James Roman Arevalo, has standing to sue. The judge also notes that the defendant did not address the fact that a cause of action still exists as to Plaintiff James Roman Arevalo.

The judge grants the defendant's request for judicial notice of Dominguez's Certificate of Death and finds that the defendant's counsel has met the meet and confer requirement. The judge also finds that the defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings is denied and orders the defendant to give notice of the court's order and file a proof of service of such.
