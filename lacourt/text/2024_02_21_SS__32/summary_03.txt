And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendant's motion to compel the plaintiff's responses to special interrogatories, set two. The defendant argues that the plaintiff failed to serve timely responses, and the plaintiff claims that she was unable to respond due to a stroke. The judge finds that the plaintiff's responses are not verified and are therefore subject to a motion to compel. The judge also grants the defendant's request for monetary sanctions against the plaintiff and her counsel in the reduced amount of $435. The plaintiff is ordered to serve properly verified responses to the special interrogatories within 20 days, and the defendant is ordered to provide notice and file a proof of service of the sanctions within 30 days.
