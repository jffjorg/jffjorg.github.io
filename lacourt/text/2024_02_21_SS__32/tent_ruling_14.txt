[1] Although
Plaintiff argues that there is a pending motion to appoint a successor in
interest, Plaintiff does not address the propriety of such a motion when
Plaintiff passed away before the case was filed, rather than a different
procedure pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 377.30. However, this
issue is not currently before the Court.
