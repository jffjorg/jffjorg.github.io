And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling addresses the Plaintiff's request for sanctions against the Defendant's counsel and a motion to compel responses to Form Interrogatories. The Court declines to award sanctions against the current Defense counsel, as they were associated with the case on December 6, 2023, after the subject discovery was served. The Court will only rule on the motion to compel regarding Form Interrogatories, Set Two, as the Defendant did not respond to that portion of the discovery.
