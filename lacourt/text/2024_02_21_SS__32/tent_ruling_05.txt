RULING
 



DEPT:


32




HEARING DATE:


February
  21, 2024




CASE NUMBER:


21STCV21713




MOTIONS:  


Deem
  Admitted Request for Admissions




MOVING PARTY:


Defendant
  David de Poto




OPPOSING PARTY:


Unopposed



 
 
BACKGROUND
 
            Defendant David de Poto (Defendant)
moves to deem admitted Requests for Admissions propounded on Plaintiff Netsanet
Loffe (“Plaintiff”). Defendant seeks monetary sanctions. No opposition has been
filed. 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
Where there has
been no timely response to a request for admission under Code of Civil
Procedure section 2033.010, the propounding party may move for an order that
the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the
requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction.¿ (Code of Civ.
Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).)¿ The party who failed to respond waives any
objections to the demand, unless the court grants that party relief from the
waiver, upon a showing that the party (1) has subsequently served a
substantially compliant response, and (2) that the party’s failure to respond
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.¿ (Code of Civ.
Proc., § 2033.280, subds. (a)(1)-(2).)¿ The court “shall” grant a motion to
deem admitted requests for admissions, “unless it finds that the party to whom
the requests for admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on
the motion, a proposed response to the requests for admission that is in
substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.”¿ (Code of Civ. Proc., §
2033.280, subd. (c).)¿¿ 
¿ 
The Discovery
Act does not define “substantial compliance” in the context of service of a
proposed response that complies with Code Civ. Proc., section 2033.220. The
courts have ruled that “substantial compliance” means actual compliance with
all matters of substance and that technical deviations are not to be given the
stature of noncompliance. (St. Mary v. Superior Court (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th
762, 779.) For example, unverified responses are not in substantial compliance.
(Appleton v. Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 632, 636.) Additionally, RFA
responses must be examined in their entirety. (St. Mary v. Superior Court
(2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 762, 780.)¿¿ 
¿ ¿ 
Where a party
fails to provide a timely response to requests for admission, “[i]t is
mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to
serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion.”¿
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)¿ 
 
DISCUSSION
 
Plaintiff was initially represented by counsel when this case began.
On June 2, 2023, all Plaintiffs in this case substituted into this matter as
their own counsel. Defendant served Requests for Admissions, Set Two on
Plaintiff on November 20, 2023 via mail. (Mayers Decl. ¶ 11, Exh. B.) The
responses were due January 8, 2024. Plaintiff did not respond. 
 
The proof of service shows that notice of this motion was served on
Plaintiff by mail to the address provided in the substitution of attorney form.
Therefore, because Plaintiff has failed to respond to discovery, or oppose, the
motion to deem admitted is granted. 
 
Defendant
also requests $1,100.00 in monetary sanctions representing an hourly rate of
$260.00 and the $60.00 filing fee. (Id. ¶ 15.) The Court finds sanctions are
warranted because Plaintiff has failed to respond. However, the amount is
excessive due to the type of motion at issue and the fact no opposition was
filed. Therefore, the Court awards sanctions in the amount of $450 against
Plaintiff (1.5 hours of attorney plus the $60 filing fee).
 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
 
Accordingly, Defendant’s Motion to deem admitted Request for
Admissions, Set Two against Plaintiff Netsanet Loffe is GRANTED. 
 
The Court further GRANTS Defendant’s request for monetary sanctions
against Plaintiff Netsanet Loffe in the reduced amount of $450.00. Said monetary
sanctions are to be paid to counsel for Defendant within 30 days of the date of
this order. 
 
Defendant
shall provide notice of the Court’s order and file a proof of service of such.
