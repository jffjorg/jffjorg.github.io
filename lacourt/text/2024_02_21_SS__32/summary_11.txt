And here is the summary text:

This tentative ruling denies without prejudice a Petition to Approve Compromise of Pending Action of a Minor, Michael Tucker, age 9. The Court's denial is based on several errors and omissions in the petition, including incomplete attachments and incorrect box selections. Specifically, the petition failed to complete boxes 12b(5)(a)(ii) and 17b(3), and listed lienholders in 12b(5)(b) instead of 12b(5)(a)(ii). Additionally, the petition did not clearly state the amount of medical expenses and Medi-Cal lien amounts. The Court finds the requested attorney fees of $35,375 to be reasonable. The Court requires the petitioner to complete the necessary attachments and corrections before the hearing on February 21, 2024.
