  Lycette Martinez’s Counsel

None



 
BACKGROUND
 
            Plaintiffs
Tevon Cullors-Tillman and Lycette Martinez’s Counsel (Plaintiffs) counsel of record, Boris Sargsyan (Counsel), moves to be
relieved as counsel for Plaintiffs. Counsel contends relief is necessary
because there has been a breakdown of the attorney-client relationship.
 
            No
opposition has been filed for these motions. 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
To be granted relief as counsel, counsel must comply with California
Rules of Court (CRC) 3.1362. Even where grounds for termination exist,
attorneys seeking to withdraw must comply with the procedures set forth in
California Rule of Professional Conduct (CRPC) 3.700 and are subject to
discipline for failure to do so. CRPC 3.700(B) lists various grounds for
mandatory withdrawal. 
 
An attorney's right to terminate the attorney-client relationship and
withdraw from a case is not absolute. (See Vann v. Shilleh (1975) 54
Cal.App.3d 192, 197; People v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398.) The
decision whether to grant or deny an application for withdrawal is within the
court's discretion, and it does not abuse that discretion by denying the
application on the ground that the attorney's withdrawal would work injustice
upon a third party. (Hodcarriers, Bldg. and Common Laborers Local Union No.
89 v. Miller (1966) 243 Cal.App.2d 391.)
 
The rules have been liberally construed to protect clients. (Vann
v. Shilleh, supra, 54 Cal.App.3d 192.) An attorney, either with client's
consent or court's approval, may withdraw from a case when withdrawal can be
accomplished without undue prejudice to client's interests; however, an
attorney “shall not withdraw from employment until the member has taken
reasonable steps to avoid reasonably foreseeable prejudice to the rights of the
client, including giving due notice to the client, allowing time for employment
of other counsel, complying with rule 3-700(D), and complying with applicable
laws and rules.” (CRPC 3.700(A)(2).) A lawyer violates his or her ethical
mandate by abandoning a client (Pineda v. State Bar (1989) 49 Cal.3d
753, 758 759), or by withdrawing at a critical point and thereby prejudicing
the client’s case. (CRPC 3.700(A)(2); Vann v. Shilleh, supra.)
 
 
DISCUSSION
 
            Counsel has
filed forms MC-051 and MC-052 and has lodged with the Court a copy of the
proposed order on form MC-053 as required. 
(Cal Rules of Court, rule 3.1362.) 
Counsel states the instant motion is filed for the following reason: “A
conflict that has unexpectedly arisen in which Boris Sargsyan, Esq., and
M&Y Personal Injury Lawyers can no longer effectively represent Plaintiff
because there has been an irreconcilable breakdown in the attorney-client
relationship.” (MC-052.) The
Court finds that this is a valid reason for withdrawal. (See Rules Prof.
Conduct, rule 1.16.)¿¿¿
 
When the motions were originally heard
on February 15, 2024, the Court noted that the proof of service only indicated that
the Notice of Motion and Motion to be Relieved were served, but not the
declaration (MC-052) and the Order (MC-053). The Court continued the hearing to
allow Counsel to file the appropriate proof of service. (Min. Order, 2/15/24.) 
 
On February 15, 2024, Counsel filed
a declaration of Misty Perez. In it, Ms. Perez declares under penalty of
perjury that on November 28, 2023, she “caused the Motion to be Relieved as
Counsel, Declaration in Support and Proposed Order to be served via Fedex
Tracking Nos. 774268330666 and 774269524000 and email to the last known address
and email of Plaintiffs Tevon Cullors-Tillman and Lycette Martinez. (Perez
Decl. ¶ 2.) She declares she “made a typographical error pertaining to the name
of the document that was served on the proof of service for the Declarations.
This was an inadvertent mistake on my part but can attest that all documents
were served appropriately.” (Id.) Based on this declaration, the Court
finds that all papers were served on Plaintiffs. 
 
However,
Counsel has not listed all future hearing dates in this case in form MC-052 and
MC-053. The Court orders Counsel to file within 5
calendar days of the hearing an amended form MC-053 for each Plaintiff which
should include information about all future hearings and proceedings noticed by
any party.¿ 
¿ 
Further, Counsel must serve the signed orders (MC-053)
within 10 days of the date of the order, and file a proof of service of such.¿
Counsel will remain the attorney of record for Plaintiffs until Counsel files
and serves the updated proposed order.¿ (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362(e).)¿¿ 
¿ 
Accordingly, the Court conditionally grants the motion
pending Counsel’s filing and service of the updated form.¿ Counsel shall
provide notice of the Court’s ruling.¿
