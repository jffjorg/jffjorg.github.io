[1] Plaintiff
requested sanctions against Defendant’s counsel jointly and severally. However,
it appears current Defense counsel was associated into this case on December 6,
2023, after the subject discovery was served. Therefore, the Court declines to
award sanctions against Defendant’s current counsel.


[2] At
various points throughout the memorandum, Plaintiff asks the Court to compel
responses to Form Interrogatories, Set Two, but also to Form Interrogatory
17.1. A motion to compel is only appropriate where a party fails to respond at
all (instead of merely serving insufficient responses). Since the record shows
that Defendant did not respond, the Court will only rule regarding Form
Interrogatories, Set Two. 


[3]
Plaintiff requested sanctions against Defendant’s counsel jointly and
severally, on the basis that they made baseless discovery responses knowing
Defendant was missing. (Reply, 2–3.) However, it appears current Defense
counsel was associated into this case on December 6, 2023, after the subject
discovery was served. Therefore, the Court declines to award sanctions against
Defendant’s current counsel.
