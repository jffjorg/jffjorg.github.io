Here is the English summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has reviewed the Plaintiff's failure to comply with discovery orders and is granting the Defendant's motion for terminating sanctions. The Plaintiff failed to respond to discovery requests served in October 2022 and has not maintained contact with counsel since May 2023. The court has granted the Defendant's motions to compel discovery and has ordered the Plaintiff to serve verified responses without objections. Despite these efforts, the Plaintiff has failed to respond and has not participated in the case. The judge finds that the Plaintiff has misused the discovery process and is justified in imposing a terminating sanction, which is dismissal of the case with prejudice.
