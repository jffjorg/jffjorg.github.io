TENTATIVE
RULING
 



DEPT:


32




HEARING DATE:


February
  21, 2024




CASE NUMBER:


21STCV05544




MOTIONS:  


Compel
  Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One




MOVING PARTY:


Defendant City of West Covina




OPPOSING PARTY:


None



 
 
BACKGROUND
 
            Defendant City of West Covina (“City”)
moves to compel Defendant County of Los Angeles’ (“County”) responses to Form
Interrogatories, Set One. City also seeks monetary sanctions. No opposition has
been filed.  
 
LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to
serve a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order compelling
responses. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.290 (b).) Failure to timely respond waives
all objections, including privilege and work product, unless “[t]he party has
subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance” and “[t]he
party’s failure to serve a timely response was the result of mistake,
inadvertence, or excusable neglect.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290 (a)(1),
(a)(2).) The statute contains no time limit for a motion to compel where no
responses have been served and no meet and confer is required when a party does
not respond to discovery requests. All that need be shown in the moving papers
is that a set of interrogatories was properly served on the opposing party,
that the time to respond has expired, and that no response of any kind has been
served. (Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902, 905-906.)  
 
If a motion to compel responses is filed, the Court shall
impose a monetary sanction against the losing party “unless it finds that the
one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., §§
2030.290 (c).) Further, “[t]he court may award sanctions under the Discovery
Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even though no
opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was withdrawn,
or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after the motion
was filed.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1348(a).) 
 
DISCUSSION
 
City asserts that on September 5, 2023, it served Form
Interrogatories, Set One on County. (Kranker Decl. ¶ 2, Exh. A.) Extensions to
respond, without objections, were granted until October 17, 2023. (Id. ¶
3.) As of the date of filing this motion, no responses had been served. Therefore,
because County does not oppose and verified responses have not been served, the
motion to compel is granted. 
 
            City requests sanctions against County
and its counsel of record for $510. This amount represents an hourly rate of
$255. Given the type of motion at issue, and the fact no opposition was filed, the
Court finds this amount is excessive and reduces it to $382.50 (1.5 hours of
attorney time).
 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
 
Accordingly, City’s Motion to compel is GRANTED. County shall
serve properly verified responses, without objections, to Form
Interrogatories, Set One, within 10 days.
 
The Court further GRANTS City’s request for monetary sanctions against
County and its counsel of record, jointly and severally, in the reduced amount
of $382.50. Said monetary sanctions are to be paid to counsel for City within
30 days of the date of this order.
 
City to
provide notice and file a proof of service of such.
