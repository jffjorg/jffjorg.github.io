And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling grants Defendant Pro-A Motors, Inc.'s motion for summary judgment. The court finds that a special employment relationship exists between Pro-A and Plaintiff Benjamin Pastrano, making worker's compensation the exclusive remedy for Plaintiff's injuries. The court concludes that Pro-A had the right to control and direct Plaintiff's work, including the authority to discharge him, which is a key factor in determining a special employment relationship. Since Plaintiff does not oppose the motion, the court grants the motion and orders Defendant to file a proposed judgment within 10 days.
