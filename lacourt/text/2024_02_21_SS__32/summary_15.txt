The court grants the motion to substitute Oscar Manuel Ramirez as the successor in interest to the deceased plaintiff, Orlando Garcia Ramos. The court finds that Ramirez has filed a declaration stating he is the successor in interest to Ramos' interest in the action. The motion is granted pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure section 377.31, which allows the decedent's personal representative or successor in interest to continue a decedent's pending action. The court notes that a certified copy of Ramos' death certificate has been attached, and therefore, Ramirez is appointed as the successor in interest.
