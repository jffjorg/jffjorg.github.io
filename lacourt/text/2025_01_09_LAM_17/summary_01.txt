The judge has tentatively ruled that the plaintiff's motion for preliminary approval of the class action and PAGA settlement is granted. The settlement agreement provides for a gross settlement amount of $625,000 and a net settlement fund of $280,188. The proposed settlement class consists of individuals who performed work for Yeezy Apparel, LLC and/or Ye (Kanye West) in California during the class period.

The judge found that the proposed settlement class is ascertainable and sufficiently numerous. The parties engaged in arms-length bargaining and meaningful settlement negotiations, and class counsel is experienced in handling wage and hour class actions.

The judge also found that the settlement meets the standards for preliminary approval, including that it is a reasonable range, and that the percentage of objectors is small. The judge ordered that the parties who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the court by 4 p.m. the day prior to the hearing, and that if all parties submit, the court will adopt this tentative as the final order.
