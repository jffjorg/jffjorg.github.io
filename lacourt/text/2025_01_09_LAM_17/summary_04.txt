And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiffs' motion to set aside the order sustaining the defendants' demurrer. The plaintiffs had sought to set aside the order due to their counsel admitting fault in failing to oppose the demurrer. However, the judge found that the plaintiffs' motion was deficient in several regards, including the lack of a copy of the proposed pleading (i.e., the draft opposition to the demurrer) and the failure to address the specific grounds on which they would oppose the demurrer. Despite the defendants identifying these deficiencies, the plaintiffs did not prepare any reply or supplemental materials. The judge cited Civil Code ยง 473(b) as the basis for the denial of the motion.
