I.                  
Provisional Certification
of the Class
 
Class certification
is appropriate when there exists (1) an ascertainable and sufficiently numerous
class, (2) a well-defined community of interest among class members, and (3)
when certification would be a fair and efficient means of adjudicating the
action, rendering class litigation superior to alternative means. (See
Brinker Restaurant Corp. v. Superior Court (2012) 53 Cal. 4th 1004, 1021.) 
 
Here, the
Class consists of “any and all individuals who performed any work as Assistant
Patternmakers, Patternmakers, Designers, Assistant Designers, Sewers, Interns,
and/or other similar job titles for Yeezy Apparel LLC and/or Ye (formally known
as Kanye West) in California, at any time during the Class Period, who have not
already entered into general releases with the Released Parties.”. (Settlement
Class Members or Class Members). (F. Kim Decl. ¶ 38; Settlement Agreement, Ex.
1 at § I, ¶ 5.) Based on documents and other information produced by
Defendants, there are approximately 49 Settlement Class Members. (F. Kim Decl.
¶ 39; Ex. 1 at § 9.)
 
Here, the
proposed Settlement Class is ascertainable because Defendants have produced in
discovery a class list containing the Settlement Class Member’s full name, last
known address and telephone number that will allow the Settlement Administrator
to reasonably determine all putative class members after issuance of the
preliminary approval order. (F. Kim Decl. ¶ 20; Ex. 1 at § I, ¶8.) Moreover,
Settlement Class Members consist of Defendants’ hourly employees, and
Defendants are required to keep records of its hourly employees’ names, home
addresses, and social security numbers. (See Wage Order 7-2001, subsection
7(c); F. Kim Decl. ¶ 21.)
 
As such,
Plaintiff can show that the proposed Settlement Class is ascertainable and
sufficiently numerous. 
 
Plaintiff
also alleges common questions of law and fact: 
 
1)    
Whether Defendants misclassified
workers as independent contractors;
2)    
Whether Defendants misclassified
employees as exempt from overtime;
3)    
Whether Defendants failed to pay all
wages and/or overtime compensation;
4)    
Whether Defendants failed to provide
lawfully required meal periods and/or failed to compensate employees one (1)
hour’s wages in lieu thereof;
5)    
Whether Defendants failed to provide
accurate itemized wage statements; 
6)    
Whether Defendants failed to pay all
wages owed upon termination of employment; and
7)    
Whether Defendants engaged in unfair
competition.
 
Finally,
Plaintiff has set forth evidence to show that she will fairly represent the
interests of the Settlement Class members, and that class treatment is the
superior method of managing this case, rather than to have all 49 employees
join this action and litigate individual claims. (F. Kim Decl. ¶¶ 36-37.) 
 
            Based
on the foregoing, the Court finds that the conditions for class certification
are met.
 
II.               
Standards for Preliminary
Approval 
 
Preliminary
approval is warranted if the settlement falls within a “reasonable range.” (See
North County Contractor’s Ass’n., Inc. v. Touchstone Ins. Servs. (1994) 27
Cal. App. 4th 1085, 1089-90.) 
 
Reasonableness
and fairness are presumed where (1) the settlement is reached through
“arms-length bargaining”; (2) investigation and discovery are “sufficient to
allow counsel and the court to act intelligently”; (3) counsel is “experienced
in similar litigation”; and (4) the percentage of objectors “is small.” (Dunk
v. Ford Motor Co. (1996). 48 Cal. App. 4th 1794, 1802.) 
 
To show that
the Settlement Agreement satisfies these factors, Plaintiff submitted evidence
that class counsel conducted extensive discovery before entering into
meaningful settlement negotiations in this matter. (F. Kim Decl. ¶¶ 8-16, 43.)
This discovery permitted Class Counsel to fairly evaluate the strength of the
case and the risks associated with ongoing litigation. (Id. at Decl. ¶
44.) The Parties also engaged in meaningful confirmatory discovery after the
mediation in which Defendants provided Plaintiffs’ counsel with an exemplar
wage statement confirming that Defendants cured the alleged paystub and wage
blending claims. (Id. at Decl. ¶ 45.) Class Counsel is experienced in
handling wage and hour class actions. (Id. at Decl. ¶ 88; Declaration of
Helen U. Kim (H. Kim Decl.) ¶ 2-4.)
 
Based on the
foregoing, the Court agrees that the Settlement is entitled to a presumption of
fairness, and meets the standards for preliminary approval. 
 
It is so ordered.
