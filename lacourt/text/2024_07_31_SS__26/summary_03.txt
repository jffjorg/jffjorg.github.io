And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has tentatively ruled that Respondent Eugenia Souza's Motion for Leave to Amend Pleadings is placed off calendar. The motion was filed on February 27, 2024, but the action was previously dismissed without prejudice on January 22, 2024. As a result, the motion is no longer necessary or relevant. The Judge notes that the Petition to Declare Mobilehome Abandoned was filed on June 12, 2023, and the action has been ongoing since then, with various hearings and motions being filed and heard. However, the action has now been terminated, and the motion for leave to amend pleadings is accordingly placed off calendar.
