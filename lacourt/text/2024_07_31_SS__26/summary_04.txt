```

And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to reclassify the action from limited to unlimited jurisdiction. The plaintiff originally filed the action in the limited jurisdiction court, but only after discovery did they reveal a loss of earnings claim that could potentially exceed the jurisdictional limit of $35,000.00. However, the plaintiff's declaration and supporting documentation are insufficient to demonstrate a possibility that the damages will exceed the limit. Additionally, the judge finds that the plaintiff has not shown good cause for seeking reclassification six months after the defendant's answer was filed.
