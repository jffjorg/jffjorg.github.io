ANALYSIS:
 
On March 17, 2024, Petitioner Fabian Carrillo (“Petitioner”)
filed the instant Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award (the “Petition”)
against Laura Becerra (“Respondent”). No proof of service of, nor opposition
to, the Petition has been filed to date.
 
 
Legal Standard
 
“Any party to an arbitration in which an award has been made
may petition the court to confirm, correct or vacate the award.  The petition shall name as respondent all
parties to the arbitration and may name as respondents any other persons bound
by the arbitration award.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1285.) “If a petition or response under this chapter is duly
served and filed, the court shall confirm the award as made, whether rendered
in this state or another state, unless in accordance with this chapter it corrects
the award and confirms it as corrected, vacates the award or dismisses the
proceeding.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
1286.)
 
A response to a
Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award that seeks to vacate or correct the award
must be served and filed no later than 100 days after the date of the service
of a signed copy of the award on the respondent. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1288.2.)
 
Discussion
 
Code of Civil
Procedure, section 1290.4 requires that the Petition and Notice of Hearing be
served on Respondents “in the manner provided in the arbitration agreement for
the service of such petition and notice” or “[i]f the arbitration agreement
does not provide the manner in which such service shall be made . . . [s]ervice
within this State shall be made in the manner provided by law for the service
of summons in an action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1290.4, subds. (a), (b).) 
 
No proof of service of the Petition and Notice of Hearing
has been filed as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 1290.4. The
arbitration agreement is not attached to the Petition, therefore, the Court
cannot determine in what manner the Petition and Notice of Hearing must be
served. Without a proof of service, the
Court cannot find that the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section
1290.4 are satisfied. 
 
Service of the Arbitration Award and Timing of Service
of Petition (CCP §§ 1283.6, 1288, 1288.4)
 
Code of Civil
Procedure section 1283.6 requires that “[t]he neutral arbitrator shall serve a
signed copy of the award on each party to the arbitration personally or by
registered or certified mail or as provided in the agreement.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1283.6.) This requirement may be satisfied by service by the
arbitrator, or upon proper service of the Award with the Petition. (See Murry v. Civil Service Employees Ins. Co. (1967) 254 Cal.App.2d 796, 799-800.) As no
copy of the arbitration award is attached to the Petition, the Court cannot
find that service of the arbitration award meets the statutory requirements. 
 
Also, a party seeking a court judgment confirming an
arbitration award must file and serve the petition no more than four years, but
not less than 10 days, after the award is served.
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1288, 1288.4.) Petitioner also has not demonstrated
compliance with Code of Civil Procedure
sections 1288 and 1288.4.
 
 
 
Confirmation of the Arbitration Award
 
An arbitration award
is not directly enforceable until it is confirmed by a court and judgment is
entered.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 1287.6; Jones
v. Kvistad (1971) 19 Cal.App.3d 836, 840.) The court must confirm the award
as made, unless it corrects or vacates the award, or dismisses the
proceeding.  (CCP § 1286; Valsan
Partners Limited Partnership v. Calcor Space Facility, Inc. (1994) 25
Cal.App.4th 809, 818.) Code of Civil Procedure, section 1285.4 states a
petition under this chapter shall:
 
a)     
Set forth the substance of or have attached a copy of
the agreement to arbitrate unless the petitioner denies the existence of such
an agreement.
 
b)     
Set forth the names of the arbitrators.
 
c)     
Set forth or have attached a copy of the award and the
written opinion of the arbitrators, if any.
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1285.4.) The Petition does not comply
with the above requirements. It does not set forth the nature of the
arbitration agreement nor attach a copy of the agreement, and it does not name
the arbitrator. (Pet., ¶¶4-4.) Substantively, the Court cannot determine to
what award Petitioner is entitled.
