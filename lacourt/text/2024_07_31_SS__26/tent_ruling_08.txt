v. Green, et al.
DEMURRER(CCP § 430.10, et seq.)
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Defendant David Green’s Demurrer
to the Complaint is SUSTAINED WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND.
 
 
ANALYSIS: 
 

On May 17, 2024, Plaintiff Fred
Martin Wimberley (“Plaintiff”), in propria persona, filed the Complaint in this
action against Defendant David Green (“Defendant”). On June 28, 2024, Defendant
filed the instant Demurrer to the Complaint. No opposition to the Demurrer has
been filed to date. Defendant filed a reply/notice of non-opposition on July
24, 2024. 
 
Discussion
 
The Demurrer is accompanied by a
meet and confer declaration as required by Code of Civil Procedure section
430.41. (Demurrer, Engst Decl., ¶2.) Defendant
demurs on the grounds that the Complaint fails to allege facts sufficient to
state a cause of action. (Citing Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e).) The
Complaint alleges causes of action for (1) conflict of interest; (2) double
dipping; and (3) fraud. These claims are based on the allegation that
Defendant, as president of SEIU Local 721, is union president for both county
workers and city workers. (Compl., pp. 1-3.) Plaintiff alleges that by acting
as union president for both county workers and city employees, Defendant is
paid twice, and this amounts to fraud. (Ibid.) 
 
As the Demurrer points out, the
Complaint does not identify any cause of action called “conflict of interest”
or “double dipping.” Nor is there any such known cause of action in California.
A fraud cause of action must allege (1) a misrepresentation, (2) with knowledge
of its falsity, (3) with the intent to induce another's reliance on the
misrepresentation, (4) justifiable reliance, and (5) resulting damage. (Conroy
v. Regents of Univ. of Cal. (2009) 45 Cal. 4th 1244, 1255.) The Complaint
does not allege any statement made by Defendant, let alone a statement made
with knowledge of its falsity. (Compl., pp. 1-4.) 
 
The Complaint also appears to
indicate fraud by concealment, which must allege Defendant concealed or
suppressed a material fact they were under a duty to disclose. (Blickman
Turkus, LP v. MF Downtown Sunnyvale, LLC (2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 858, 868.)
Even if the Complaint could be read to allege that Defendant concealed that
they were union president for county employees and city workers at the same
time, there are no allegations of a duty to disclose this fact, that Plaintiff
was unaware of this fact, or that Plaintiff would have acted differently if
they were aware of this fact. (See ibid.) The Complaint, therefore, does
not allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action for fraud and the
Demurrer is sustained.
 
Leave to amend must be allowed
where there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment and the burden
is on the complainant to show the Court that a pleading can be amended
successfully. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.) As
Plaintiff has not filed any opposition to the Demurrer, leave to amend is
denied.
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant David Green’s Demurrer to the Complaint is
SUSTAINED WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND.
 
 
Moving party to give notice.
