And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on the defendant's demurrer to the complaint. The demurrer was filed by the defendant, David Green, and argues that the complaint does not allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action. The complaint alleges causes of action for conflict of interest, double dipping, and fraud against the defendant, who is the president of SEIU Local 721 and union president for both county workers and city workers. The judge has sustained the demurrer without leave to amend, meaning that the plaintiff has failed to state a valid cause of action and cannot amend the complaint to fix the deficiencies. The judge has also denied the plaintiff's request for leave to amend, as the plaintiff has not filed an opposition to the demurrer.
