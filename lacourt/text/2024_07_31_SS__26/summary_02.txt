And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has decided to place off calendar the motion filed by defendants Marina Silver and Gary Silver to vacate the default judgment entered in favor of plaintiff Sheldon I. Lodmer. The defendants had argued that the default judgment should be vacated, but the judge has ruled that since the defendants had previously answered the complaint and appeared for trial on March 13, 2024, it is not possible to grant the relief sought in the motion. The judge has concluded that the motion is not necessary and has placed it off calendar.
