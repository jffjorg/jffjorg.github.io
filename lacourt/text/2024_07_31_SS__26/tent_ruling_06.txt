ANALYSIS: 
 
Petitioner Michael Tenenbaum, as Trustee of the Elevator
Trust Dated November 22, 2021 (“Petitioner”), filed the instant Petition for
Release of Mechanic’s Lien against Respondent Pacific Coast Design Group
Construction Management and Development (“Respondent”) on June 21, 2024. An
Amended Verified Petition was filed on July 11, 2024. No response to the
Petitions has been filed to date. 
 
Discussion
 
Petitioner moves to have the mechanic’s lien recorded
against their property by Respondent released. Under Civil Code section 8484
the petition for release order must be verified by the petitioner and allege
the following:
 
(a) The date of recordation of the
claim of lien. A certified copy of the claim of lien shall be attached to the
petition.
(b) The county in which the claim of
lien is recorded.
(c) The book and page or series number
of the place in the official records where the claim of lien is recorded.
(d) The legal description of the
property subject to the claim of lien.
(e) Whether an extension of credit has
been granted under Section 8460, if so to what date, and that the time for
commencement of an action to enforce the lien has expired.
(f) That the owner has given the
claimant notice under Section 8482 demanding that the claimant execute and
record a release of the lien and that the claimant is unable or unwilling to do
so or cannot with reasonable diligence be found.
(g) Whether an action to enforce the
lien is pending.
(h) Whether the owner of the property
or interest in the property has filed for relief in bankruptcy or there is
another restraint that prevents the claimant from commencing an action to
enforce the lien.
 
(Civil Code, § 8484.) The Amended Petition contains all the
information required by the statute. Civil Code section 8486, subdivision (b)
also requires service of the Petition and Notice of Hearing to “be made in the
same manner as service of summons, or by certified or registered mail, postage
prepaid, return receipt requested . . . .” (Civ. Code, § 8486, subd. (b).)
Petitioner has filed a compliant proof of service of the Amended Petition and
the Notice of the Hearing Date. The proof of service filed on July 11, 2024
shows service of the papers on Respondent by certified mail, postage prepaid,
with return receipt requested. (Proof of Service, 07/11/24, pp. 2-3.) This
complies with the statute for service of process.
 
The Petition also seeks attorney’s fees and costs in
connection with the instant proceeding under Civil Code section 8488,
subdivision (c) in the amount of $4,687.50 based on 7.5 hours or attorney time
billed at $625.00 and $339.37 in costs. (Pet., Leitman Decl., ¶¶5-8.) The Court
finds the hourly rate and time billed reasonable and awards Petitioner the fees
and costs requested.

Elevator Trust Dated November 22, 2021, to Release Property from Mechanic’s
Lien is GRANTED. PETITIONER IS AWARDED ATTORNEY’S FEES OF $4,687.50 AND COSTS
