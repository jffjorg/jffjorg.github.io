SUMMARY
OF ACTION
Plaintiff
John Doe was a student Huntington Middle School and San Marino High School with
defendant San Marino Unified School District (SMUSD). Defendant Howard Cheung
was a teacher in SMUSD. Cheung was also an employee for defendant River Way
Ranch Camp, an overnight camping facility in Sanger, California. 
 
Beginning
in sixth grade in 2000-2001, a friendly relationship between Plaintiff and
Cheung began, which placed the two alone together in various location. The
continued contact provided Cheung opportunities to sexually molest Plaintiff,
including at River Way Ranch Camp. Plaintiff alleges SUMSD faculty and staff
saw the inappropriate time together and failed to investigate or report.
 
On
April 7, 2022, Plaintiff filed a complaint for Sexual Abuse of a Minor,
Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress, Sexual Harassment, Negligent
Hiring, Supervision, and Retention of Unfit Employee, Breach of Mandatory Duty:
Failure to Report Suspected Child Abuse, Negligent Supervision of a Minor,
Negligent Failure to Warn, Train or Educate, and Negligence. On June 18, 2021,
the court overruled the demurrer of SMUSD. SMUSD answered and filed a
cross-complaint.
 
On
June 28, 2022, the action was transferred from Department 32 (Personal Injury
hub) to Department 68. On June 28, 2022, Plaintiff dismissed River Way Ranch
Camp with Prejudice. On October 26, 2022, Plaintiff dismissed Howard Cheung
without Prejudice. On May 17, 2023, the court granted the motion of Western
Camps, Inc. dba River Way Ranch Camp for determination of a good faith
settlement with Plaintiff. 
 
On March 27, 2024, the court granted the motion for summary
adjudication on the fourth and sixth causes of action for Negligent Hiring,
Supervision, and Retention of Unfit Employee Negligent Supervision of a Minor.
The court denied the motion for summary judgment on the basis of its denial of
the motion for summary adjudication on the fifth and seventh causes of action
for Breach of Mandatory Duty, Failure to Report Suspected Child Abuse, and
Negligent Failure to Warn, Train or Educate.
 
On April 16, 2024, the court entered the parties’
stipulation to continue the trial date. 
 
RULING: Stay Lifted.
On May 30, 2024, the court granted the motion to stay the
case pending two appeals on the issue of the constitutionality of the statutory
revival of claims. The court set an OSC re: Status of Stay an invited
supplemental briefing.
 
In a joint brief, the parties represent the first of two
opinions from the First Appellate District was issued. (West Contra Costa
Unified School District v. Superior Court of Contra Costa County (2024)
103 Cal.App.5th 1243.) The court upheld the constitutionality of the revival
and rejected the constitutional challenge brought by the school district and
amici curiae. The Second Appellate District cases remains pending on Roe #2
v. Superior Court (Second Appellate District Case No. B334707 (Second Appellate
District Case No. B334707).
 
Plaintiff requests a lift of the stay pending given the
First District opinion, and trial date setting. As stated in the May 30, 2024,
order:
 
“Decisions
of every division of the District Courts of Appeal are binding upon all the
justice and municipal courts and upon all the superior courts of this state,
and this is so whether or not the superior court is acting as a trial or
appellate court. Courts exercising inferior jurisdiction must accept the law
declared by courts of superior jurisdiction. It is not their function to
attempt to overrule decisions of a higher court.” (Auto Equity Sales, Inc. v. Superior Court of Santa Clara County (1962) 57 Cal.2d 450, 455.) “Where California intermediate
appellate court cases conflict, any trial court may choose the decision it
finds most persuasive.” (Sears v. Morrison (1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 577, 587.) “As a practical matter, a superior court ordinarily will follow an
appellate opinion emanating from its own district even though it is not bound
to do so. Superior courts in other appellate districts may pick and choose
between conflicting lines of authority.” (McCallum v. McCallum (1987)
190 Cal.App.3d 308, 315 (footnote 4).)”
[¶][¶]
“As soon as one of the Court of Appeal’s issues its
decision, the Court intends to lift this partial stay and set the case for
trial.”
 
While a potential conflicting opinion may arrive from the
Second Appellate District, the court elects to allow the case to proceed rather
than continue with an indefinite period of a stay.
 
The stay is therefore lifted. The court will set a new trial
date.


San
Marino School District to give notice.
