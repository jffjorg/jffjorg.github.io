And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge denied the motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories from the defendant, Phillip 66 Company. The plaintiff, Flavio Nino, had moved to compel the defendant to provide further responses to interrogatories numbered 63, 65, 68, 69, 72, 73, 75-86, 89, and 93. The defendant had objected to the motion, citing privacy concerns related to former employees.

The Judge noted that the instant motion and the motion involving a request for production of documents both improperly labeled the motion as one to compel supplemental production, when in fact the plaintiff sought further responses. The Judge also noted that the motion was not properly reserved with the court.

The Judge ruled that the motion was moot as to numbers 63, 68, 72, 73, 80-86, 89, and 92, as the defendant had agreed to provide the information upon the entry of a protective order. The Judge also denied the motion as to numbers 65, 69, and 75-79, as the defendant's privacy objections were proper and the plaintiff had failed to address the standard for obtaining the information.

The Judge declined to impose sanctions on the plaintiff, as the plaintiff had not provided a valid request for sanctions in the motion. The Judge also noted that the motion to compel further responses was denied, as both production and agreed-upon production would render the current dispute moot.
