Here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling addresses the motion to compel further responses to request for production of documents, specifically requests 16-21, which seek information related to a "drivability defect" in vehicles of the same year, make, and model as the subject vehicle. The court notes that the term "drivability defect" is exceptionally broad and invites dispute beyond the scope of the alleged vehicle defects.

The court generally adheres to a policy limiting discovery to the make, model, and year, but finds that the requests are too broad and seek to discover information beyond the scope of the pending claims. The court invites the parties to further meet and confer to refine the terms of the discovery requests and notes that any agreed-upon terms shall remain limited to the make, model, and year.

The court declines to grant the motion as presented but will not outright deny it if outstanding discovery remains to be generated. The court will continue the hearing to a new date to preserve the timeliness of the motion. The parties are invited to submit an updated brief updating the court on the status of the dispute nine court days before the new hearing date.
