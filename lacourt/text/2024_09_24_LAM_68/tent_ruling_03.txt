SUMMARY
OF ACTION
Plaintiff
alleges she was employed with Phillips 66 from 2011 to the present. On April
23, 2021, Plaintiff suffered an injury at work. That same day Phillips 66 sent
Plaintiff to be seen at CareOnSite, Phillip 66’s worker’s compensation
provider. Upon arriving at CareOnSite, Plaintiff alleges that CareOnSite
immediately administered a drug test. Plaintiff alleges she submitted to the
drug test based on the understanding that she was required to do so as a
condition of her continued employment and that if she refused to submit to the
drug test, it would result in her immediate termination. Plaintiff alleges
CareOnSite did not undertake any efforts to determine whether the drug test was
necessary. Plaintiff alleges that CareOnSite and Phillips 66 did not possess
any information implicating that Plaintiff was intoxicated or under the
influence of any substance at the time of the April 23, 2021, injury. Plaintiff
alleges CareOnSite aided and abetted Phillips 66 in discrimination and
retaliation against Plaintiff by facilitating and directly performing the drug
test on Plaintiff. Plaintiff stated she passed the drug test following the
demand of the employer. Plaintiff maintains upon returning to work employer
refused to accommodate the required work restrictions.

RULING: Denied.
Plaintiff Faviola Nino moves to compel supplemental
responses to Special Interrogatories (set two), numbers 63, 65, 68, 69, 72, 73,
75-86, 89 & 93 from Defendants Phillip 66 Company. Plaintiff maintains the
responses are not code compliant. Defendant in opposition maintains
supplemental responses have been or will be served on numbers 63, 68, 72, 73,
80-86, 89, and 92, but stands by the objections for numbers 65, 69, and 75-79.
[Declaration of Jamil Mensah.] Plaintiff in reply denies receipt of any
supplemental responses at the time of the filing of the reply, and maintains
the objections on numbers 65, 69, and 75-79 remain invalid. Plaintiff concludes
with a request for sanctions.
 
The instant motion and the motion involving Request for
Production of Documents (set two) both improperly label the motion as one to
compel supplemental production, when Plaintiff in fact seeks further responses.
The motion was not properly reserved with the court. The court will consider
the two motions given the apparent supplemental discovery, but any and all new
or additional motions improperly identified and reserved can and will lead to a
continuance of the hearing date within an allotted spot or taken off-calendar
if beyond the trial date. The court will not enable parties to shortcut the
setting limits with misidentified motions and reserved items.
 
"Whether a
particular response does resolve satisfactorily the issues raised by
a motion is a matter best determined by the trial court in the exercise of its
discretion, based on the circumstances of the case. In many cases involving
untimely responses, the propounding party will take the motion off
calendar or narrow its scope to the issue of sanctions. If the propounding
party proceeds with the motion, however, the trial court has the discretion to
rule on the motion. The trial court might compel responses without
objection if it finds no legally valid responses have been provided to one or
more interrogatories; it might deny the motion to compel responses as essentially
unnecessary, in whole or in part, and just impose sanctions; it might
treat the motion as one under section 2030.300 and either determine that
further answers are required, or order the propounding party to “meet and
confer” (§ 2030.300, subd. (b)) and file a separate statement (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1020(a)(2), (c)); or it might take the motion off calendar,
thereby requiring the propounding party to file a motion under section
2030.300.”
 
(Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007)
148 Cal.App.4th 390, 408–409.) 
 
Any copies of purportedly identified supplemental responses
were not apparently incorporated with the opposition. [See Mensah Decl.] The
court accepts the lack of service of any responses at the time of the reply,
but the court assumes responses will be served at the time of hearing. If
Plaintiff’s counsel represents as an officer of the court that no responses
were served at the time of the hearing, and Defendant lacks proof of any
service of such responses, the court will provide a ruling as if the motion was
effectively unopposed on the subject items. The court otherwise declines to rule
on the propriety of the expected but as yet unseen responses, and therefore
denies the motion to compel “supplemental” responses as moot as to numbers 63,
68, 72, 73, 80-86, 89, and 92.
 
On numbers 65, 69, and 75-79, Defendant restates the
objections on grounds of privacy of former employees. Defendant, however,
agrees to provide said information upon the entry of a protective order. The
privacy objections as to former employees are proper. The motion and reply lack
sufficient address of the standard, or any response to the assumed offer to
enter into a protective order. Plaintiff only “regrets” not seeking sanctions.
Again, barring a justified reason for refusing to enter into a protective
order, the court determines the motion moot and denies the motion as to numbers
65, 69, and 75-79, as well.
 
The motion is therefore DENIED in that both production and
agreed upon production will render the current dispute as moot. Plaintiff admits
to providing no valid request for sanctions in the motion, and the court
declines to impose sanctions via notice in the reply, even if Plaintiff
presented a basis justifying relief.

of Documents set for September 25, 2024.
