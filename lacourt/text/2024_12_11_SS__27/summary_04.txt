Here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Court has granted the motions filed by the Defendants, including the motion to deem requests for admissions admitted, the motion to compel initial responses to form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for production, and the motion for sanctions. The Plaintiff has failed to respond to the discovery requests, and the Court has ordered the Plaintiff to submit verified responses to the discovery requests without objections within 20 days. The Court has also deemed the contents of the Defendant's Requests for Admissions, Set One, admitted.

Additionally, the Court has granted the motion to continue the trial and all trial-related dates. The trial was previously set for February 28, 2025, but the Court has continued it to August 22, 2025, due to the Plaintiff's lack of cooperation in conducting discovery, the relatively recent appearance of the Defendants in the case, and the lack of prior continuances. The Court has also set a final status conference for August 8, 2025.

The Court has awarded sanctions to the Plaintiff in the amount of $1,200, which must be paid by the Plaintiff and his counsel within 20 days.
