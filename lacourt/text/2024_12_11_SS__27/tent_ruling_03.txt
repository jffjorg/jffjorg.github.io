Background
 
This motion concerns Defendant MTA’s late
expert designation. The expert exchange was originally set for September 18,
2024. (Thomas Decl. ¶ 8-9.) On September 16, 2024, Plaintiff Claudia Yareli
Carrasco (“Plaintiff”) requested the exchange be continued to October 2, 2024,
due to an upcoming mediation. MTA agreed. (Id. ¶ 10-11.) However, after
this agreement, MTA’s counsel asserts he did not calendar the new designation
date. Plaintiff filed her designation of experts on October 2, 2024, but MTA
did not.
 
On October 18, 2024, MTA realized that it
failed to designate experts and served the designation on Plaintiff. (Thomas
Decl. ¶ 18.) MTA designated one expert, Dr. Grogan, an orthopedic doctor who
physically examined Plaintiff. Plaintiff did not respond to the email. MTA
asserts that had Plaintiff responded to the email or objected, it would have
made an ex parte application for leave to file the tardy designation. (Id.)
MTA did not realize Plaintiff was objecting to the tardy designation until
apparently November 6, 2024, when Plaintiff served a motion in limine to
exclude undesignated experts. (Id. ¶ 19.)  
MTA now moves the Court to allow the tardy
designation of its expert witness. Plaintiff opposes and MTA replies.
 
Discussion
 
CCP § 2034.720
permits a party to submit a tardy designation of experts, provided the court
considers (1) any prejudice to the opposing party, (2) whether the late
designation resulted from excusable neglect, and (3) the party's diligence in
addressing the late designation once discovered.
 
Excusable Neglect
 
Numerous courts have found clerical or calendaring errors to
constitute excusable neglect warranting relief under Code of Civil Procedure
section 473. For example, relief was granted when an associate attorney
misinterpreted the lead attorney's instructions and provided incorrect
information at a hearing (Bergloff v. Reynolds (1960) 181 Cal.App.2d
349, 358–359, 5 Cal.Rptr. 461) and when an attorney's secretary lost an answer
that was to be filed (Alderman v. Jacobs (1954) 128 Cal.App.2d 273,
275–276, 274 P.2d 930). Additionally, as Witkin notes, “[a] number of cases
deal with the realities of office practice, including the inevitable misfiling
of papers or erroneous clerical entries, and usually this neglect is considered
excusable.” (8 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (4th ed. 1997) Attack on Judgment in
Trial Court, § 167, pp. 671–673).
 
On September 18, 2024, defense counsel agreed to continue the
designation date to October 2, 2024. (Exhibit 8.) However, following this
agreement, defense counsel failed to update a calendar slip with the new
designation date. Notably, defense counsel had not previously failed to
calendar a designation date in this case. Additionally, during this time,
counsel's associate was sick, leading to a temporary understaffing issue.
 
Plaintiff argues that Defendant agreed to exchange expert
information on October 2, 2024, and received Plaintiffs’ designations via email
that day. Plaintiff contends any reasonable person would have recognized
October 2 as the deadline and provided their designation promptly. Plaintiff
further asserts that Defendant acted unreasonably by delaying 16 days to
designate experts, especially after receiving Plaintiffs’ meet-and-confer
letter.
 
The Court first notes that this is not an instance of gamesmanship
or a strategic decision by Defendant regarding the late designation. Plaintiff
has had the expert's report and has been aware of the expert's identity since
January 2024. This is not disputed by the parties.
 
Second, Plaintiff’s assertion that Defendant should have acted more
promptly upon receiving Plaintiff’s designation or the meet-and-confer email
pertains to the issue of diligence in addressing the missed designation
deadline, rather than whether the initial failure to meet the deadline resulted
from mistake or excusable neglect. Plaintiff’s central argument as to excusable
neglect—that any misunderstanding of the October 2, 2024, deadline is
inexcusable—fails to account for the realities of legal practice. It is
standard practice for attorneys to rely on calendaring systems for deadlines
rather than committing them to memory. The Court finds Defendant’s explanation
of a calendaring error to be credible, particularly given the absence of any
prior failures to meet similar deadlines in this litigation. Plaintiff has not
provided evidence to contradict the existence of such an error or to suggest
that Defendant’s actions were willful or calculated. 
 
Diligence
 
As to Defendant’s diligence in pursuing the late designation, there
is some merit to Plaintiff’s argument that Defendant could have acted more
quickly in designating its expert. However, trial is currently set for January
8, 2024, and expert discovery closes on December 24, 2024, leaving sufficient
time for Plaintiff to conduct expert discovery following the late designation
even now. Furthermore, Defendant has offered to waive any notice period for the
expert’s deposition and make the expert available for deposition, an offer
Plaintiff refused. On its face, this suggests that Plaintiff may be attempting
to take advantage of the situation rather than addressing the issue
substantively.
 
Prejudice
 
The Court does not find that Plaintiff has been unduly prejudiced.
As stated earlier, Plaintiff does not dispute knowing the existence of
Defendant’s expert, Dr. Grogan, since January 2024. Dr. Grogan conducted
Plaintiff’s defense medical examination in April 2024, and Plaintiff received
the expert report months before the designation deadline. There is no evidence
of gamesmanship or surprise in this case. Furthermore, Defendant has repeatedly
offered Plaintiff opportunities to take Dr. Grogan’s deposition, which
Plaintiff has refused. The refusal to depose the expert despite repeated
opportunities suggests a strategic decision by Plaintiff rather than an
inability to prepare. Even now, there remains ample time for Plaintiff to
conduct Defendant’s expert deposition before the expert discovery cutoff.
Therefore, Plaintiff has not been unduly prejudiced.
 
Because the law strongly favors trial and disposition on the
merits, any doubts regarding the granting of relief for excusable neglect must
be resolved in favor of the party seeking relief. Accordingly, the Court grants
the motion.
