And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied two motions filed by the Plaintiff, Kathleen Johnson, in a personal injury case against the Defendant, Solomon Laktineh. The first motion was to re-open discovery, which was denied because the Plaintiff failed to demonstrate diligence in completing discovery and did not show that the discovery was necessary to prepare for trial. The second motion was to continue trial, which was also denied because the discovery cut-off date had expired and there was no sufficient good cause to continue trial.

The Judge noted that the Plaintiff had not shown that she acted diligently to complete discovery and that the discovery cut-off date had expired. The Judge also noted that the Plaintiff's motion to continue trial was not supported by a good faith effort at informal resolution, as required by law.

The Judge's tentative ruling is subject to submission by email by the parties or to oral argument at the hearing scheduled for December 11, 2024.
