Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the motion for tardy designation of expert witnesses filed by Defendant Los Angeles County and Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA). The motion is made pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2034.720, which permits a party to submit a tardy designation of experts if certain conditions are satisfied.

The facts of the case are as follows: Defendant MTA failed to designate its expert witnesses on October 2, 2024, despite agreeing to continue the expert exchange to that date. MTA realized the mistake on October 18, 2024, and served the designation on Plaintiff Claudia Yareli Carrasco. Plaintiff did not respond to the email, and MTA asserts that it would have made an ex parte application for leave to file the tardy designation if Plaintiff had objected.

The judge finds that Defendant MTA's failure to designate its expert witnesses was due to excusable neglect, citing the court's own decision in Bergloff v. Reynolds (1960) 181 Cal.App.2d 349, 358-359, 5 Cal.Rptr. 461, which held that clerical or calendaring errors constitute excusable neglect warranting relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 473.

The judge also finds that Plaintiff has not been unduly prejudiced by the late designation, as Plaintiff has had the expert's report and has been aware of the expert's identity since January 2024. The judge notes that Defendant MTA has offered to waive any notice period for the expert's deposition and make the expert available for deposition, an offer that Plaintiff refused.

In granting the motion, the judge relies on the strong public policy favoring trial and disposition on the merits, and resolves any doubts regarding the granting of relief for excusable neglect in favor of the party seeking relief.
