[1] Though the Notices of Motion for
each of the four discovery motions state they are brought by both Defendants
Tak Yeung Lam and Kam Wai Lam, the attached discovery only shows that it was
propounded by Defendant Tak Yeung Lam. Therefore, this order will only pertain
to Defendant Tak Yeung Lamâ€™s discovery responses.
