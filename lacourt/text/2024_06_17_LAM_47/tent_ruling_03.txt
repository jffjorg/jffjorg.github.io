CASE:                         Claudia Yareli Paredon Nieto v. The Haas
Building, et al. 
 
CASE NO.:                 23STCV21020            
 
DEMURRER
TO COMPLAINT

 
MOVING PARTY:               Defendant Broadway Exchange Building, LLC and The Haas
Building
 
RESPONDING PARTY(S): Plaintiff Claudia
Nieto
 
 
STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is an employment discrimination action that was filed on August 31,
2023. Plaintiff alleges that she was subjected to extensive sexual harassment,
assault, and battery, and was wrongfully terminated. 
 
Defendants Broadway Exchange
Building, LLC and The Haas Building demur to the Complaint in its entirety. 
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Defendants Broadway Exchange
Building, LLC and The Haas Building demur to the Complaint in its entirety. 
 
Defendants demur to each cause of
action for (1) misjoinder of parties; (2) failure to state facts sufficient to
constitute a claim for breach of contract, and (3) uncertainty. With
respect to misjoinder of parties, although Defendants contend that they are
both defunct corporations, their papers do not demonstrate the absence of a
common question of law or fact and/or a lack of interest in the controversy. (See
Code Civ. Proc. §§ 378-379.) Mere statements that the corporations are defunct
do not suffice to meet their burden.  This is particularly true because dissolved
corporations are subject to suit under Corporations Code § 2010.  (Penasquitos, Inc. v. Superior Court
(1991) 53 Cal. 3d 1180, 1188.)  As to the
remaining theories, no cause of action for breach of contract is asserted in
the Complaint, and, further, Defendants’ arguments in the memorandum of points
and authorities challenging Plaintiff’s claims on other grounds are wholly
improper because they are not asserted in the demurrer itself. (Cal. Rules of
Court Rule 3.1320(a).) Moreover, the moving Defendants do not specify which of
them is raising each argument with respect to any given cause of action. (Cal.
Rules of Court Rule 3.1320(e).) Further still, although Defendants assert that
the Complaint is uncertain, they do nothing to support that contention beyond
vaguely gesturing to the Complaint as a “garbled mess.” That is not remotely
sufficient to demonstrate any deficiency in the Complaint. 
 
Accordingly, Defendants’ Demurrer
to the Complaint is OVERRULED in its entirety.
 
            Moving
Parties to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.

            Any party may submit on the
tentative ruling by contacting the courtroom via email at Smcdept47@lacourt.org by no later than 4:00 p.m. the day
before the hearing. All interested parties must be copied on the email. It
should be noted that if you submit on a tentative ruling the court will still
conduct a hearing if any party appears. By submitting on the tentative you
have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you
should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an
order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
