The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the plaintiff, Claudia Yareli Paredon Nieto, and has overruled the defendants' demurrer in its entirety. The defendants, Broadway Exchange Building, LLC and The Haas Building, had sought to dismiss the complaint alleging employment discrimination, including sexual harassment, assault, and battery, and wrongful termination. The judge found that the defendants had failed to demonstrate the absence of a common question of law or fact and/or a lack of interest in the controversy, and that their demurrer was untimely and unsupported by legal authority.
