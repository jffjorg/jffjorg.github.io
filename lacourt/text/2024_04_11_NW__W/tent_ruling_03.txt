[TENTATIVE]
RULING:
 
Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel
Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One Against Defendant Access Services
Under C.C.P. Sections 2030.290 et. seq. and Request for Costs, Sanctions, and
Attorney Fees under C.C.P. §§2030.010 et seq. and 2030.290 et. seq. is GRANTED 
 
DISCUSSION
 
Plaintiff Leon Hall moves to compel Defendant Access
Services to serve discovery responses, without objections, to Plaintiff’s Form
Interrogatories, Set One. Plaintiff also seeks sanctions against Defendant
and/or its attorney of record.  
 
Where a party fails to serve timely responses to
discovery requests, the court may make an order compelling responses. (CCP §§
2030.290, 2031.300, 2033.280; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific
Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.) A party that fails
to serve a timely response to the discovery request waives any objection to the
request, including one based on privilege or the protection of attorney work
product. (CCP §§ 2030.290(a), 2031.300(a), 2033.280(a); Sinaiko Healthcare
Consulting, Inc., supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at 404.) Pursuant to Code
of Civil Procedure section 2033.010, the propounding party may also move for an
order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified
in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction. (CCP §
2033.280(b).)
 
On January 16, 2024, Plaintiff propounded their discovery requests
including Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatories, Set One. (Elechyan Decl. ¶5, Exhs. 1,
2.) Responses were due by February 16, 2024. (Elechyan Decl. ¶5.) After no
response, Plaintiff’s counsel sent a meet and confer regarding the overdue
discovery responses. (Elechyan Decl. ¶6, Exh. 3.) As of the filing of the
instant motion, Plaintiff has still not received any responses to their
discovery requests. (Elechyan Decl. ¶7.) 
 
The
court finds Defendant Access Service has failed to timely respond to Plaintiff’s
properly propounded discovery. Plaintiff’s unopposed motion to compel
Defendant Service Access’ responses to form interrogatories, set one is
GRANTED. Defendant is ordered to provide responses without objection within 20
days. 
 
Sanctions
 
The court may impose a monetary sanction ordering that one engaging in
the misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney advising that conduct, or
both pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees, incurred by anyone
as a result of that conduct. (CCP §2023.030.) 
 
Plaintiff requests $1,636.65 for 1.5 hours preparing the motion, 2.0
hours reviewing any opposition and preparing a reply, and 1 hour for court
appearance at counsel’s hourly rate of $350. (Elechyan Decl. ¶¶12-13.) The
court GRANTS Plaintiff’s request for sanctions in the reduced amount of $875.00
per motion.
