English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in this case, which concludes that the City's immunity arguments are without merit. The court finds that Section 815.2 of the Government Code provides liability for public entities, including the City, for injuries caused by their acts or omissions. The court also rules that Section 820.2 of the Government Code confers immunity to public employees, but only to the extent that their acts or omissions are the result of the exercise of discretion vested in them. The court rejects the City's argument that it is immune from liability for failure to address the homeless encampment, finding that the City's failure to address the encampment despite receiving multiple reports of the nuisance and dangerous condition it created is not protected by Section 845 of the Government Code. The court's tentative ruling is subject to change based on any further arguments or evidence presented at the court hearing.
