[1] The court recognizes that
governmental immunity is somewhat intertwined with the separation of powers
doctrine.  “The immunity principle is
rooted in the separation of powers doctrine, that the judicial branch should
not interfere in the discretionary decisions of the Legislature or the
executive branch.”  (Fuller v.
Department of Transportation (2001) 89 Cal.App.4th 1109, 1117 (Fuller).)
 However, the court need not veer into this
intersection because the City’s immunity argument is distinct and independent.    
 


[2] Section 815.2 provides: “(a) A
public entity is liable for injury proximately caused by an act or omission of
an employee of the public entity within the scope of his employment if the act
or omission would, apart from this section, have given rise to a cause of
action against that employee or his personal representative.  (b) Except as otherwise provided
by statute, a public entity is not liable for an injury resulting from
an act or omission of an employee of the public entity where the employee is
immune from liability.”  (Emphasis added.)  Contrary to the City’s position, Section
815.2 does not bar Plaintiff’s claims.  By
the plain language of Section 815.2, the City may be liable if so provided by
statute.  The nuisance claim (Civ. Code §
3479) and claim for dangerous condition of public property (Gov. Code § 835)
are such statutes.  “[T]he California
Supreme Court has held Civil Code section 3479 is a statute that provides
liability against public entities which maintain nuisances.”  (Paterno v. State of California (1999)
74 Cal.App.4th 68, 103 (Paterno), citing Nestle v. City of Santa
Monica (1972) 6 Cal.3d 920, 937.)  Further,
“the act provides liability for a dangerous condition of public property.”  (Paterno, at p. 103, citing Gov.
Code, § 835.) 
 


[3] Section 820.2 provides: “Except
as otherwise provided by statute, a public employee is
not liable for an injury resulting from his act or omission where the act or
omission was the result of the exercise of the discretion vested in him,
whether or not such discretion be abused.” 
(Emphasis added.)  Section 820.2
does not bar Plaintiff’s claims for the same reason as Section 815.2  Plaintiff’s claims are provided by
statute.  Section 820.2 is unavailing to
the City for the further reason that it specifically confers immunity to a
public employee.  The Act “generally
affords a public employee personal immunity from suit when the act or omission
for which recovery is sought resulted from ‘the exercise of the discretion
vested in him.’  (§ 820.2.)  This ‘discretionary act’ immunity extends to
‘basic’ governmental policy decisions entrusted to broad official judgment.”  (Caldwell v. Montoya (1995) 10 Cal.4th
972, 976.)  Here, Plaintiff brings this
action against the City only.
 


[4] Section 845 provides, in relevant
part: “Neither a public entity nor a public employee is liable for failure to
establish a police department or otherwise to provide police protection service
or, if police protection service is provided, for failure to provide sufficient
police protection service.”  This
immunity does not bar because Plaintiff’s allegations, fairly construed, are
that the City did nothing to address the homeless encampment despite receiving
multiple reports of the nuisance and dangerous condition the encampment
created.  (FAC, ¶ 12.)  Plaintiff does not allege a failure to provide
police protection service, sufficient or otherwise.  (See Lopez v. Southern Cal. Rapid Transit
Dist. (1985) 40 Cal.3d 780, 800 [“In the case at bar, plaintiffs are not
alleging expressly that defendant failed to provide “police protection
services.” Plaintiffs' allegations, fairly construed, are that defendant failed
in its duty to “provide everything necessary” for plaintiffs' “safe carriage.”
(Civ. Code, § 2100.) This duty is not the functional equivalent of a duty to
provide guards riding shotgun on defendant's buses. Something more, something
less or something altogether different may be necessary depending on the
circumstances. There are a number of steps defendant might take to help keep
passengers safe from crime on board its buses.”].)
 


[5] And unlike the governmental
immunities provided at Sections 815.2 and 820.2, Section 818.2 does not contain
the “except as provided by statute” clause. 
(See Esparza v. County of Los Angeles (2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 452,
462 [“…the immunity conferred under section 818.2 has no limiting language. It
is an absolute immunity rather than a conditional one.”].)
