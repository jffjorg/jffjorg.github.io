And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant has raised three procedural challenges to the plaintiff's motion to quash subpoenas. The judge finds that these challenges lack merit. The plaintiff is not required to file a separate statement or meet and confer with the defendant before filing a motion to quash a subpoena. Additionally, the plaintiff is not required to file separate motions to quash for each subpoena when multiple subpoenas seek the same categories of information. The judge will consider the merits of the motion as to all five subpoenas. The judge also notes that the Supreme Court has stated that courts must place the burden on the party asserting a privacy interest to establish the extent and seriousness of the invasion, and weigh the countervailing interests of the opposing party.
