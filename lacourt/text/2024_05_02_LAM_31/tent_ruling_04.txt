[1] Defendants asserted three
procedural challenges in opposition to this motion: (1) failure to file a
separate statement, (2) failure to meet and confer, and (3) failure to file
separate motions to quash.  The
challenges lack merit.  First, there is
no requirement that a separate statement must accompany a motion to quash a
subpoena for records.  (See Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1345.)  Likewise, there is
no requirement that a party seeking to quash a subpoena for personal records
must meet and confer prior to filing the motion to quash.  (See Code Civ. Proc., § 1987.1.)  As to
the failure to file separate motions to quash, it is undisputed that the five
subpoenas each seek information for the same categories.  The court therefore agrees with Plaintiff
that filing five separate motions to quash is unnecessary.  The court considers the merits of the motion
as to all five subpoenas.


[2] As the Supreme Court stated
in Williams, “Courts must [] place the burden on the party
asserting a privacy interest to establish its extent and the seriousness of the
prospective invasion, and against that showing must weigh the countervailing
interests the opposing party identifies, as Hill requires.
What suffices to justify an invasion will, …, vary according to the context.
Only obvious invasions of interests fundamental to personal autonomy must be
supported by a compelling interest.”  (Williams,
supra, 3 Cal.5th at p. 557.)
