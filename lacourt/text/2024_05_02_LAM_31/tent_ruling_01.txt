MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION



 
MOVING PARTY:               Plaintiff Jeff Baoliang Zhang,
Ph.D. 
 
RESPONDING
PARTY:     Defendants
City of Los Angeles, et al.
 
 
I.          BACKGROUND
 
            ¿On July
28, 2021, Plaintiff, Jeff Baoliang Zhang, Ph.D., who is self-represented, filed
this action against the City of Los Angeles (sued as the “Los Angeles Police
Department”) (hereafter, the “City”).¿ On March 25, 2022, the court sustained
the City’s demurrer, in part, without leave to amend as to Plaintiff’s First
Cause of Action for Willful Perjuries, the Serious Violation of the Federal
Laws. 
 
On January 5, 2023, Plaintiff filed the operative First
Amended Complaint (“FAC”).¿ The FAC alleges causes of action for (1) Willful
Perjuries, the Serious Violation of the Federal Laws; (2) Violation of the
United States Constitution; and (3) Theft and Robbery of Plaintiff’s Property,
Willful Perjuries, the Serious Violation of the Federal Laws.¿ The FAC also
adds Kenneth Bryant (“Bryant”), Jesse Hinchman (“Hinchman”), Albert Delarocha
(“Delarocha”), Charlie Beck (“Beck”), and Michel Moore (“Moore”) as defendants.1¿¿ 
 
On February 9, 2023, the City, Hinchman, Moore, and Bryant
(hereafter, “Defendants”) filed a demurrer.  On August 11, 2023, the court
sustained the demurrer to the FAC, without leave to amend.   
 
On October 26, 2023, the court denied Plaintiff’s motion for
reconsideration but, on its own motion, reconsidered the August 11, 2023
ruling, as to the Second Cause of Action only. 
=
 
On January 19, 2024, Defendants filed a motion for judgment
on the pleadings as to the Second Cause of Action.  The court heard oral
argument on February 14, 2024 and took the matter under submission.  On February 15, 2024, the court issued its
order granting Defendants’ motion.  On
the same day, the court entered judgment in favor of Defendants and against
Plaintiff.
 
            On February
29, 2024, Plaintiff filed this motion for reconsideration of the court’s
February 15, 2024, order.  
 
Defendants filed an opposition.  Plaintiff replied. 
 
II.        LEGAL
STANDARD
 
            “When an
application for an order has been made to a judge, or to a court, and refused
in whole or in part, or granted, or granted conditionally, or on terms, any
party affected by the order may, within 10 days after service upon the party of
written notice of entry of the order and based upon new or different facts,
circumstances, or law, make application to the same judge or court that made
the order, to reconsider the matter and modify, amend, or revoke the prior
order.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 1008, subd. (a).)  “A party seeking
reconsideration also must provide a satisfactory explanation for the failure to
produce the evidence at an earlier time. [Citation.]”¿ (New York Times Co.
v. Superior Court (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 206, 212.)¿¿A motion for
reconsideration is properly denied where it is based on evidence that could
have been presented in connection with the original motion.  (Morris v.
AGFA Corp. (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1452, 1460.)   
 
            “The
statutory provisions relating to motions for renewal (i.e., subsequent
applications for the same order) are found in section 1008, subdivision
(b).”  (Graham v. Hansen (1982) 128 Cal.App.3d 965, 970.)  “A
party who originally made an application for an order which was refused in
whole or part, or granted conditionally or on terms, may make a subsequent
application for the same order upon new or different facts, circumstances, or
law, in which case it shall be shown by affidavit what application was made
before, when and to what judge, what order or decisions were made, and what new
or different facts, circumstances, or law are claimed to be shown.”  (Code
Civ. Proc. § 1008, subd. (b).)  “These provisions contain no requirement
that a motion for renewal be made within the 10-day time period as is required
for motions for reconsideration.”  (Graham, supra, 128
Cal.App.3d at p. 970.) 
 
III.       DISCUSSION
 
            Plaintiff
moves for reconsideration of the court’s February 15, 2024 order granting
Defendants’ motion for judgment on the pleadings without leave to
amend.   
¿ 
The court does not have jurisdiction to rule on this
motion.  “A court may reconsider its order granting or denying a motion
and may even reconsider or alter its judgment so long as judgment has not yet
been entered. Once judgment has been entered, however, the court may not
reconsider it and loses its unrestricted power to change the judgment.”¿ (Passavanti
v. Williams (1990) 225 Cal.App.3d 1602, 1606.)  Entry of an order for
dismissal satisfies the entry of judgment requirement.  (APRI Ins. Co.
v. Superior Court (1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 176, 181.) 
 
 
Here, Judgment was entered in favor of Defendants and
against Plaintiff on February 15, 2024.¿ Given the entry of judgment, the court
lacks jurisdiction to reconsider the order.  
¿ 
            Even if Judgment had not been entered, the court finds that
Plaintiff’s motion is procedurally and substantively defective.  
 
First, the motion is untimely.  “When an application for an order has been
made to a judge, or to a court, and refused in whole or in part, or granted, or
granted conditionally, or on terms, any party affected by the order may, within
10 days after service upon the party of written notice of entry of the order
and based upon new or different facts, circumstances, or law, make application
to the same judge or court that made the order, to reconsider the matter and
modify, amend, or revoke the prior order.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 1008, subd.
(a).)     
            
            Here, Plaintiff
brings this motion pursuant to Section 1008, subdivision (a).  On February 16, 2024, pursuant to the court’s
order, the clerk of the court served Plaintiff the court’s February 15, 2024
ruling.  As such, Plaintiff had until February
26, 2024 to file this motion.  Plaintiff
filed the motion on February 29, 2024.  The
motion is untimely. 
 
            Second,
Plaintiff does not identify any new or different facts, circumstances, or law
that direct a different result.  “When an
application for an order has been made to a judge, or to a court, and refused
in whole or in part, or granted, or granted conditionally, or on terms, any
party affected by the order may, within 10 days after service upon the party of
written notice of entry of the order and based upon new or different facts,
circumstances, or law, make application to the same judge or court that made
the order, to reconsider the matter and modify, amend, or revoke the prior
order.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 1008, subd. (a).)  “A party seeking
reconsideration also must provide a satisfactory explanation for the failure to
produce the evidence at an earlier time. [Citation.]”¿ (New York Times Co.
v. Superior Court (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 206, 212.) 
 
Here, Plaintiff repeats the same arguments and factual
background as appeared in his opposition to Defendants’ motion for judgment on
the pleadings.  Plaintiff does not meet
his burden to show a different order is warranted.       
            
IV.       CONCLUSION 
 
            Accordingly, the motion for reconsideration is DENIED.
 
            Moving
party to give notice, unless waived.
