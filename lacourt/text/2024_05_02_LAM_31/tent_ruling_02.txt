CLAIM
OF EXEMPTION



 
MOVING PARTY:               Defendant/Judgment
Debtor Jeff Bankston
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     Plaintiff/Judgment
Creditor Richard Mucha
 
 
            On January 9,
2021, Plaintiff Richard Mucha filed this action against, Defendant Jeff
Bankston for defamation, malicious prosecution, abuse of process, and
infliction of emotional distress.  Defendant
defaulted.  On September 8, 2022, the
court entered default judgment against Defendant and in favor of Plaintiff in
the total sum of $255,000.
 
            On November
or December of 2023, Defendant served a Claim of Exemption Packet.  The packet, which contains a Financial
Statement, was not filed with the court. 
Thereafter, the court received the Claim of Exemption Packet by mail
from the Sheriff’s Department.  
 
On January 12, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Notice of Opposition
to Claim of Exemption.  The Notice
indicates Defendant has made a claim of exemption.  
 
On January 16, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Notice of Hearing on
Claim of Exemption. 
 
“Within 10 days after service of the notice of claim of
exemption, a judgment creditor who opposes the claim of exemption shall file
with the court a notice of opposition to the claim of exemption and a notice of
motion for an order determining the claim of exemption and shall file with the
levying officer a copy of the notice of opposition and a copy of the notice of
motion.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 703.550.) “The claim of exemption and notice of
opposition to the claim of exemption constitute the pleadings, subject to the
power of the court to permit amendments in the interest of justice.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 703.580, subd. (a).)
 
“At a hearing under this section, the exemption claimant has
the burden of proof.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 703.580, subd. (b).) “The claim of
exemption is deemed controverted by the notice of opposition to the claim of
exemption and both shall be received in evidence.  If no other evidence is offered, the court, if
satisfied that sufficient facts are shown by the claim of exemption (including
the financial statement if one is required) and the notice of opposition, may
make its determination thereon.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 703.580, subd. (c).)  “At
the conclusion of the hearing, the court shall determine by order whether or
not the property is exempt in whole or in part.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 703.580, subd. (d).)
 
Defendant seeks to exempt certain property from
collections.  Defendant’s Claim for
Exemption, at line 4, however, fails to identify the property Defendant seeks
to exempt.  The Defendant points to two
statutory sections in support of his claim of exemption (CCP section 704.180
and 42 USC section 407) but these references are of little help when the Defendant
did not identify the property at issue.  The
court will hear from Defendant to see if he can supplement his filing.
