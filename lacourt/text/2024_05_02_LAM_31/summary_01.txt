And here is the English summary of the tentative ruling:

The court denies Plaintiff's motion for reconsideration of the court's February 15, 2024 order granting Defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings without leave to amend. The court finds that the motion is procedurally and substantively defective. The court lacks jurisdiction to reconsider the order because judgment was entered in favor of Defendants and against Plaintiff on February 15, 2024. Even if judgment had not been entered, the court finds that the motion is untimely and does not identify any new or different facts, circumstances, or law that would direct a different result. The court grants the motion for judgment on the pleadings because Plaintiff does not meet his burden to show a different order is warranted.
