**English Text Summary of the Tentative Ruling:**

Judge William A. Crowfoot issued a tentative ruling on Steven Gowan and HumanGood's demurrer (challenge) to Herbert Schwarz's First Amended Complaint. Schwarz, a former IT Help Desk Analyst at HumanGood, alleges he was forced to resign due to age discrimination and harassment by his supervisor, Gowan.  The judge *sustained* the demurrer for the causes of action related to harassment, failure to prevent harassment, and unfair competition. This means the judge *agreed* with the defendants that Schwarz's complaint, *as currently written*, does not provide enough specific facts to legally support those claims. The judge found that the alleged actions by Gowan, such as assigning more work and keeping a personnel file, fall under the category of necessary personnel management, rather than legally defined harassment.  The judge also found that Schwarz lacked standing to bring a claim under the Unfair Competition Law.  However, the judge granted Schwarz 20 days to amend his complaint, meaning he has the opportunity to revise and refile it with more specific details that might address the judge's concerns. The Court also addressed HumanGood's late filing, by treating it as a "motion for judgement on the pleadings."

## Case Summary: Herbert Schwarz v. HumanGood et al.

**Case Number:** 22AHCV00957
**Hearing Date:** September 18, 2023
**Court:** Superior Court of the State of California, County of Los Angeles, Northeast District
**Parties:** 
* **Plaintiff:** Herbert Schwarz
* **Defendants:** HumanGood and Steven Gowan

**Summary:**

This case involves a lawsuit filed by Herbert Schwarz against HumanGood and Steven Gowan (his former supervisor). Schwarz alleges he was forced to resign from his position at HumanGood due to age discrimination and harassment by Gowan. 

Schwarz filed an initial complaint and then an amended complaint.  Defendants challenged the amended complaint with a demurrer, arguing that certain causes of action (Second - Harassment, Fourth - Failure to Prevent Harassment, and Sixth - Unfair Competition) were insufficient.

**Judge's Ruling:**

The judge sustained the demurrer for the following reasons:

* **Second Cause of Action (Harassment):** The judge found that the allegations of harassment were not severe enough to create a hostile work environment. While assigning more work and denying assistance might be unpleasant, the judge concluded these actions were not necessarily harassment under the law. 
* **Fourth Cause of Action (Failure to Prevent Harassment):** This cause of action was dismissed because the judge sustained the demurrer to the harassment claim. 
* **Sixth Cause of Action (Unfair Competition):** The judge found that Schwarz lacked standing to bring a claim under the Unfair Competition Law (UCL) because he hadn't suffered a concrete economic injury.

**Next Steps:**

The judge granted Schwarz 20 days to amend his complaint to address the deficiencies identified.

**Key Legal Points:**

* **Harassment:**  Must be severe and pervasive enough to create a hostile work environment.
* **Failure to Prevent Harassment:** A claim hinges on a valid harassment claim.
* **Unfair Competition Law (UCL):** Requires a plaintiff to demonstrate an "injury in fact" or economic loss.

## Case Summary: Herbert Schwarz v. HumanGood

**Case Number:** 22AHCV00957
**Hearing Date:** September 18, 2023
**Court:** Superior Court of the State of California, County of Los Angeles - Northeast District

**Parties:**

* **Plaintiff:** Herbert Schwarz
* **Defendants:** HumanGood and Steven Gowan

**Summary:**

This case involves a potential employment discrimination lawsuit. Herbert Schwarz, the Plaintiff, alleges he was discriminated against and harassed by his supervisor, Steven Gowan, while employed by HumanGood as an IT Help Desk Analyst.

Schwarz filed an amended complaint alleging six causes of action: age discrimination, harassment based on age, retaliation, failure to prevent discrimination, harassment, and retaliation, wrongful termination in violation of public policy, and unfair competition. 

HumanGood and Gowan (Defendants) filed a demurrer challenging the Second, Fourth, and Sixth causes of action.  

**Judge's Ruling:**

The Judge sustained the demurrer for the following reasons:

* **Second Cause of Action (Harassment):**  The Judge found that Schwarz's allegations of harassment, while potentially upsetting, did not rise to the level of creating a hostile work environment. The Judge determined that the alleged actions, such as assigning more work and denying assistance, fell within the scope of necessary personnel management.
* **Fourth Cause of Action (Failure to Prevent Harassment):** This cause of action was dismissed because the Judge sustained the demurrer to the Second Cause of Action.
* **Sixth Cause of Action (Unfair Competition):** This cause of action was dismissed because the Judge found that Schwarz lacked standing to bring a claim under the Unfair Competition Law.

**Next Steps:**

The Judge granted Schwarz 20 days to amend his complaint to address the deficiencies identified in the ruling.


## English Summary

This tentative ruling from the judge in the case of Herbert Schwarz vs. HumanGood and Steven Gowan deals with three specific claims made by Schwarz against his former employer and supervisor.

Schwarz accused HumanGood and Gowan of various forms of discrimination and harassment. The judge, however, found that the actions described by Schwarz did not constitute a hostile work environment, which is required to prove a claim of harassment.  

Additionally, the judge ruled that Schwarz did not have legal standing to pursue a claim under California's Unfair Competition Law. 

Schwarz has 20 days to revise his complaint and potentially strengthen his arguments. If he fails to do so, the claims in question will be dismissed.

**Summary:**

The tentative ruling by the Judge concerns the demurrer filed by defendants HumanGood and Steven Gowan to the first amended complaint (FAC) filed by plaintiff Herbert Schwarz. The demurrer challenges the second, fourth, and sixth causes of action in the FAC, which are for harassment, failure to prevent discrimination, harassment, and retaliation, and unfair competition.

The Judge sustains the demurrer to the second cause of action for harassment, finding that plaintiff has not sufficiently alleged that the alleged harassment created a hostile work environment. The Judge also sustains the demurrer to the fourth cause of action for failure to prevent harassment, as it is dependent on the second cause of action.

With respect to the sixth cause of action for unfair competition, the Judge finds that plaintiff lacks standing under the UCL as he has not suffered an "injury in fact" or "lost money or property as a result of Defendants." The Judge sustains the demurrer to the sixth cause of action.

The demurrer is sustained as to plaintiff's second, fourth, and sixth causes of action with 20 days' leave to amend.
