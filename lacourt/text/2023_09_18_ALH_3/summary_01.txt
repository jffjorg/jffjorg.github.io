The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by defendants HumanGood and Steven Gowan to a lawsuit brought by plaintiff Herbert Schwarz. The demurrer challenges the sufficiency of the plaintiff's claims for age discrimination, harassment, retaliation, and unfair competition.

The judge has sustained the demurrer as to the plaintiff's Second, Fourth, and Sixth Causes of Action, which means that the plaintiff will have 20 days to amend these claims. The judge has also agreed with the defendants that the allegations of harassment are insufficient to state a claim.
