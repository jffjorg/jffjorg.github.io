**English Text Summary of the Tentative Ruling:**

Judge William A. Crowfoot issued a tentative ruling on Steven Gowan and HumanGood's demurrer (challenge) to Herbert Schwarz's First Amended Complaint. Schwarz, a former IT Help Desk Analyst at HumanGood, alleges he was forced to resign due to age discrimination and harassment by his supervisor, Gowan.  The judge *sustained* the demurrer for the causes of action related to harassment, failure to prevent harassment, and unfair competition. This means the judge *agreed* with the defendants that Schwarz's complaint, *as currently written*, does not provide enough specific facts to legally support those claims. The judge found that the alleged actions by Gowan, such as assigning more work and keeping a personnel file, fall under the category of necessary personnel management, rather than legally defined harassment.  The judge also found that Schwarz lacked standing to bring a claim under the Unfair Competition Law.  However, the judge granted Schwarz 20 days to amend his complaint, meaning he has the opportunity to revise and refile it with more specific details that might address the judge's concerns. The Court also addressed HumanGood's late filing, by treating it as a "motion for judgement on the pleadings."
