Legal
Standard
 
Court approval is required
for all settlements of a minor’s claim.  (Prob. Code §§ 3500, 3600, et
seq.; Code Civ. Proc., § 372.) 
California Rules of Court Rule 7.950 provides that a petition “must be
verified by the petitioner and must contain a full disclosure of all
information that has any bearing upon the reasonableness of the
compromise.”  (See Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 7.950.)  Rule 7.950 states that the
Petition must be filed on a completed Petition for Approval of Compromise of
Claim or Action or Disposition of Proceeds of Judgment for Minor or Person with
a Disability (form MC-350).
 
Discussion
 
Petitioner
Amparo Mendoza ("Petitioner") seeks court approval of a
settlement between minor claimant Eduardo Angel Barajas (“Eduardo”) (DOB: 10/14/15)
and Defendants 2525 E 10th, LLC and Sean Plotkin (“Defendants”)
in the total amount of $10,000.00. (Petition, ¶ 10.) Petitioner is Eduardo’s
parent. 
 
The petition is executed by Petitioner.
The petition explains that from March 20, 2023, to present, Eduardo lived
in unhabitable conditions including living with cockroach infestation, bed bug
infestation, and rodent infestation. (Id., ¶¶ 4-7.) Eduardo suffered
from bed bug bites, lack of sleep, and allergies. (Ibid.) For treatment,
over-the-counter ointments, creams, and rubbing alcohol were applied to Eduardo's
skin to relieve itchiness due to the insect bites. (Ibid.)
Non-prescription allergy and cough relief medications were administered to Eduardo
by Petitioner as needed for allergy symptoms. (Ibid.) Eduardo was not
treated by a medical doctor for these symptoms or injuries. (Ibid.) Eduardo
has recovered completely from the effects of the injuries and did not sustain
any permanent injuries. (Ibid.)
 
The total amount of attorney’s fees for
which court approval is requested is $2,454.42. (Petition, ¶ 13; Attachment 11.)
This equates to 25% of Eduardo’s total recovery after deducting costs. (Petition,
Attachment 13a; Chapman Decl., ¶ 9.) The total amount of litigation costs and
expenses is $182.33. (Petition, ¶ 13; Attachment 11.) Petitioner has
attached a declaration from Counsel Christofer R. Chapman, as well as a copy of
the retainer agreement. (Petition, Attachment 13a, 17a.) The court has
reviewed the declaration of Chapman and believes that 25% is an
appropriate percentage for attorney’s fees here.
 
The net balance of proceeds for Eduardo
after payment of all requested fees and expenses is $7,363.25 which will be
deposited into a blocked account with Pacific Premier Bank. (Petition, ¶¶ 10,
15-16.) 

 
The court
finds the settlement is fair and reasonable. The petition is GRANTED.
