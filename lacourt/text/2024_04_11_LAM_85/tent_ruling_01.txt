  Case Number:  23STCP00618    Hearing Date:   April 11, 2024    Dept:  85 
Christopher Joy v. Civil Service
Commission of the County of Los Angeles, et al., 23STCP00618  

Tentative decision on petition for
writ of mandate: denied




 



Petitioner Christopher Joy (“Joy”)
seeks a writ of mandate compelling Civil Service Commission (“Commission”) of
the County of Los Angeles  (“County”) to set
aside its decision upholding his termination as Deputy Probation Officer II and
restore all back pay and benefits from the date of his discharge until he is
reinstated.  
The court has read and
considered the moving papers, opposition, and reply, and renders the following
tentative decision. 
 
A. Statement of
the Case 
1. Petition
 Petitioner Joy commenced this
proceeding on
February 28, 2023 against Respondent Commission, naming the County’s Probation
Department (“Department”) as Real Party-in-Interest.  The Petition alleges in pertinent part as
follows.  
The Commission is authorized and required by the County Charter,
Article IX, and Los Angeles County Code (“LACC”) Title 5, Appendix 1, to
conduct evidentiary hearings and to render final decisions in appeals brought
by County employees contesting disciplinary action imposed on them by their
employer.  Pet., ¶2. 
Joy was an employee of the Department. Pet., ¶1.  On or about December 4, 2018, the Department
mailed Joy a Notice of Discharge, alleging that he had violated Department
policies which warranted his discharge from County service.  Pet., ¶4. 
Joy appealed his discharge to the Commission. Pet., ¶¶ 1-2.  A five-day hearing was held on September 13,
2019, June 28-29, 2021, August 9, 2021, and February 14, 2022, after which the
Hearing Officer rendered a proposed decision recommending that the Commission uphold
Joy’s discharge.  Pet., ¶4.  
On July 13, 2022, the Commission announced its proposed
decision to accept the findings and recommendation of the Hearing Officer.  Pet., ¶4.  Joy filed written objections to the proposed
decision.  Pet., ¶4.  On November 30, 2022, the Commission overruled
Joy’s objections and adopted as its final decision the findings and
recommendation of the Hearing Officer to sustain Joy’s discharge. Pet., ¶ 4.  On January 30, 2023, the Commission emailed
its final decision to Joy. Pet., ¶4.
Joy seeks administrative
mandamus to compel the Commission to (1) set aside its decision upholding his
termination from the position of Deputy Probation Officer, (2) restore all back
pay and benefits from the date of the discharge until the date he is reinstated,
(3) pay interest on the back pay at the full legal rate, and (4) remove from
his personnel file all documentation relating to the incident adjudicated in
this Petition.  Joy also seeks his costs
in this action, including attorney’s fees under Government Code section 800(a).
 
2. Course of
Proceedings 
On March 16, 2023, the Commission filed a Notice of No
Beneficial Interest in the Outcome.
On May 25, 2023, Joy filed a proof of service of the Petition
on the Commission.  On July 10, 2023, Joy
filed a proof of service of the Petition on the Department. 
On July 12, 2023, the Department filed its Answer. 
 
B. Standard of Review 
CCP section 1094.5 is the administrative mandamus provision
which structures the procedure for judicial review of adjudicatory decisions
rendered by administrative agencies. Topanga Ass’n for a Scenic Community v.
County of Los Angeles, (“Topanga”) (1974) 11 Cal.3d 506, 514-15.
CCP section 1094.5 does not on its face specify which cases
are subject to independent review, leaving that issue to the courts. Fukuda
v. City of Angels, (“Fukuda”) (1999) 20 Cal.4th 805, 811. In cases
reviewing decisions which affect a vested, fundamental right the trial court
exercises independent judgment on the evidence.  Bixby v. Pierno, (“Bixby”)
(1971) 4 Cal.3d 130, 143; see CCP §1094.5(c). The independent judgment standard
of review applies to administrative findings in cases involving a law enforcement
officer’s vested property interest in his employment. Barber v. Long Beach
Civil Service Comm’n, (1996) 45 Cal.App.4th 652, 658.
Under the independent judgment test, “the trial court not
only examines the administrative record for errors of law but also exercises
its independent judgment upon the evidence disclosed in a limited trial de
novo.” Bixby, supra, 4 Cal.3d at 143. The court must draw its own
reasonable inferences from the evidence and make its own credibility
determinations. Morrison v. Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles
Board of Commissioners, (2003) 107 Cal.App.4th 860, 868. In short, the
court substitutes its judgment for the agency’s regarding the basic facts of
what happened, when, why, and the credibility of witnesses.  Guymon v. Board of Accountancy, (1976)
55 Cal.App.3d 1010, 1013-16.
“In exercising its independent judgment, the trial court
must afford a strong presumption of correctness concerning the administrative
findings, and the party challenging the administrative decision bears the
burden of convincing the court that the administrative findings are contrary to
the weight of the evidence.” Fukuda, supra, 20 Cal.4th at 817.
Unless it can be demonstrated by petitioner that the agency’s actions are not
grounded upon any reasonable basis in law or any substantial basis in fact, the
courts should not interfere with the agency’s discretion or substitute their
wisdom for that of the agency. Bixby, supra, 4 Cal.3d 130,
150-51; Bank of America v. State Water Resources Control Board, (1974)
42 Cal.App.3d 198, 208.
The agency’s decision must be based on a preponderance of
the evidence presented at the hearing.  Board
of Medical Quality Assurance v. Superior Court, (1977) 73 Cal.App.3d 860,
862. The hearing officer is only required to issue findings that give enough
explanation so that parties may determine whether, and upon what basis, to
review the decision.  Topanga, supra,
11 Cal.3d 506, 514-15. Implicit in CCP section 1094.5 is a requirement that the
agency set forth findings to bridge the analytic gap between the raw evidence
and ultimate decision or order.  Id.
at 115.
An agency is presumed to have regularly performed its
official duties (Evid. Code §664), and the petitioner therefore has the burden
of proof.  Steele v. Los Angeles
County Civil Service Commission, (1958) 166 Cal.App.2d 129, 137. “[T]he
burden of proof falls upon the party attacking the administrative decision to
demonstrate wherein the proceedings were unfair, in excess of jurisdiction or
showed prejudicial abuse of discretion.” Afford v. Pierno, (1972) 27
Cal.App.3d 682, 691. 
The propriety of a penalty imposed by an administrative
agency is a matter in the discretion of the agency, and its decision may not be
disturbed unless there has been a manifest abuse of discretion.  Lake v. Civil Service Commission,
(1975) 47 Cal.App.3d 224, 228.  In
determining whether there has been an abuse of discretion, the court must
examine the extent of the harm to the public service, the circumstances
surrounding the misconduct, and the likelihood that such conduct will
recur.  Skelly v. State Personnel
Board, (“Skelly”) (1975) 15 Cal.3d 194, 217-218.  Neither an appellate court nor a trial court
is free to substitute its discretion for that of the administrative agency
concerning the degree of punishment imposed. 
Nightingale v. State Personnel Board, (“Nightingale”)
(1972) 7 Cal.3d 507, 515.  The policy
consideration underlying such allocation of authority is the expertise of the
administrative agency in determining penalty questions.  Cadilla v. Board of Medical Examiners,
(1972) 26 Cal.App.3d 961. 
 
C. Civil Service Rules
 “Hearsay evidence may
be admitted for any purpose, but shall not be sufficient in itself to support a
finding unless it would be admissible over objection in civil actions. The
rules of privilege and of official or judicial notice shall be effective to the
same extent as in civil actions. Irrelevant and repetitious evidence shall be
excluded. Oral evidence shall be taken only under oath or affirmation.”  County Civil Service Rule (“CSR”) 4.10(B).
Failure of an employee to perform his or her assigned duties
so as to meet fully explicitly stated or implied standards of performance may
constitute adequate grounds for discharge, reduction or suspension. Where
appropriate, such grounds may include, but are not limited to, qualitative as
well as quantitative elements of performance, such as failure to exercise sound
judgment, failure to report information accurately and completely, failure to
deal effectively with the public, and failure to make productive use of human,
financial and other assigned resources. Grounds for discharge, reduction or
suspension may also include any behavior or pattern of behavior which
negatively affects an employee’s productivity or which is unbecoming a county
employee; Or any behavior or condition which impairs an employee's
qualifications for his or her position or for continued county employment.  CSR 18.031 (AR 128). 
 
D. Statement of Facts[1]

1. Background 
            Joy was hired on
February 31, 1994 and was a Deputy Probation Officer II (“DPO”) at all relevant
times.  AR 11.  He had a history of positive performance
reviews and a disciplinary history consisting only of a February 12, 2010 written
reprimand. AR 11-12, 248-313.  
On May 30, 2014, Joy
was working as a DPO at the Department’s Antelope Valley Juvenile Supervision
Office.  During this time, Anna Flores (“Flores”)
held a clerical position with Apple One, an outside company supplying clerical
workers to the County, and worked at the same office.  AR 14. 
 
a. Flores’
Complaint
On May 30, 2014, an
incident occurred between Flores, Joy, and a co-worker, DPO Cedric White
(“White”).  AR 1203.  Flores apparently filed a CPOE complaint.[2]
 
b. December 5,
2014 Joy Interview
Joy was interviewed
by a County Department of Human Resources Deputy Compliance Officer Patrick
Koressel (“Koressel”) on December 5, 2014. 
AR 381.  Joy stated that Flores
was a friend, but their relationship was strictly professional.   AR 381. 
They occasionally do things outside of work.  AR 381. 
They did not have a dating relationship “at the time” (meaning on May
30, 2014 when they were at a restaurant and White showed up).  AR 383. 
Joy stated that he did not know White. 
AR 383.
 
2. Flores’s Lawsuit
On July 1, 2016,
Flores filed a civil sexual harassment and discrimination lawsuit against the
Department and DPO White, alleging that the Department abuse culminated on May
30, 2014 when White confronted Flores and Joy, accusing them of an
inappropriate relationship and making violent threats against them.  AR 425-35. 

 
a. Joy’s August 7,
2017 Deposition

December of 2014.  AR 577.  He knew it was around Thanksgiving, and that
is when they started seeing each other. 
AR 577.  Joy testified that he and
Flores were friends with a professional working relationship a couple years
ago.  AR 588-89.  At no time were they dating or having a
sexual relationship while Flores was at the office.  AR 595.
 
b. The Gailey
Associates Investigation Report
The Department’s
counsel retained Gailey Associates to investigate the Flores claim.  AR 1227. 
On August 21, 2017, Gailey Associates provided a report of interviews of
Michele Parsons (“Parsons”) and Arnulfo Arana (“Arana”).  AR 1227. 
 
(i). Michele
Parsons  
Parsons was
interviewed on July 31, 2017.  AR
1228.  In June 2014, she and her
then-spouse, Joy, went to see her father in Arizona.  AR 1228. 
Joy was acting weird, and she confronted him about having an affair,
which he denied.  AR 1228.  A week after they returned home, she went
downstairs at 4:00 a.m. and found Joy sleeping next to a phone that she had
never seen before.  AR 1228.  She was about to unlock it and read several
text messages from Flores which clearly indicated they were romantically
involved.  AR 1228.  There were many loving comments using the
words “honey” and “baby”.  AR 1229.  There also were text messages “I can’t talk”
because she (Parsons) had entered the room. 
AR 1229.  She confronted Joy with
the evidence, and he initially denied the affair.  AR 1228. 
Later that morning, he admitted the affair.  She made him pack his bags and leave that
day.  AR 1228.  She did not know when the affair began.  AR 1228.
In June or July 2014,
Joy moved into the Provenance Apartments. 
AR 1229.  Joy wanted to see his
children and therefore Parsons went to the apartment to inspect it.  AR 1229. 
She observed Flores’ clothes and a room set up for Flores’
children.  AR 1229.  Joy claimed that Flores and her children only
stayed at the apartment sometimes.  AR
1229.  Parsons filed for divorce in July
2014.  AR 1229.  
 
(ii). Arnulfo
Arana
Arana was married to
Flores.  They divorced mainly because of
Joy.  AR 1231.  He had suspicions that Flores was cheating on
him for many months.  AR 1231.  He “probably” found text messages but would
not provide details.  AR 1231.
He confronted Joy
about the affair in May 2013, and Joy denied it, saying that Arana was
delusional.  AR 1231.  Flores also initially denied the affair but
admitted it in June or July 2013.  AR
1231.  Approximately a month later,
Flores moved into an apartment in Santa Clarita.  AR 1231.  
When questioned about his timeline because he appeared to be a year off,
Arana stated he was sure that Flores moved out in 2013 and they divorced in
2014.  AR 1231.
 
c. Joy’s August
29, 2017 Deposition
On August 29, 2017, at
1:30 p.m., Joy’s second deposition was taken in the Flores lawsuit.  AR 626. 
At the outset, Joy was asked to explain why he was unable to be present
for the deposition’s scheduled 10:00 a.m. start time.  AR 630. 
Joy testified that he had to do a probation violation report for a
case.  AR 631.  He did not find out until that morning from
his supervisor, Connie Moro (“Moro”), that the probation violation report was
due that day.  AR 631.  Moro required him to complete the report that
morning.  AR 631.  He had a miscommunication with Moro; he thought
Moro believed the deposition was the next day (August 30).  AR 631.
Joy refused to
identify the Department officers whom he claimed had badmouthed him about his
relationship with Flores.  AR 714.  He also refused to identify the employees who
told him about the rumors of White badmouthing him and Flores.  AR 714. 
He testified that he was uncomfortable dragging these co-workers into
the matter.  AR 715.  He then stated that he was told by some
officers out of courtesy that White was badmouthing himself and Flores.  AR 718-19. 
He claimed that he feared retaliation from the Department based on what
was going on with the Flores lawsuit.  
AR 719.  He did not feel
comfortable or safe name-dropping these people. 
AR 720.  He added that these other
individuals work with White and he was afraid of what the other officers would
do to him.  AR 721.  He just saw White leaving court in Lancaster
and he feared for his safety.  AR 727-28.  He was afraid of White and what he was
capable of doing.  AR 729-30.
 
d. Joy’s Trial
Testimony
On October 3, 2017,
Joy testified for Flores in the Flores lawsuit. 
AR 950.  He testified that “at
that point in time” -- meaning on May 30, 2014 -- he was not having an affair,
sex, or sexual contact with Flores either in or outside the workplace.  AR 954.
 
e. Heather Urkel’s
Trial Testimony
Heather Urkel (“Urkel”)
testified that “very soon after [Joy] started in the office they were dating or
flirting or texting. I don’t know what you would call it. But she [Flores] was
sharing that with me.” AR 1075.   Flores
did not use the term “dating”, but she would usually come into Urkel’s office
because it was private and shut the door. 
AR 1975.  She would share with Urkel
text messages and pictures that she (Flores and Joy had sent to each other.  She was very excited about seeing him.  AR 1075-76. 
She would make a lot of hand gestures and had body language about their
being with him. AR 1076. Flores showed her “racy pictures that she had sent him
of herself in lingerie, a picture that he had sent to her of his genitalia,
looking down at himself.”  AR 1076.  
All the texts Flores
showed her between Joy and herself were non-business related but rather of a
sexual nature.  AR 1077-78.  She called him “Daddy” and texted “I can’t
wait to F. you.”  AR 1078.  These events probably would have been in May
2014.  AR 1077.  When asked if it was before May 30, 2014,
Urkel responded “I believe so.” AR 1077.  
 
f. White’s Trial
Testimony
White testified that
on May 30, 2014, he slowly drove around. 
AR 1203.  He parked his car, got
out of his vehicle, and walked up to the other car.   AR 1203. 
As he walked up, he realized it was Joy and Flores.  AR 1203. 
He sat there and watched for a little while.  AR 1203. 
They were kissing and grinding, and he watched out of curiosity.  AR 1203.
 
g. The Jury Verdict
On or around October 6, 2017, the jury found against the
County (but not White) on one of Flores’ claims, awarding her approximately
$62,000 in damages.  The trial court
granted a post-trial motion for attorney fees in the amount of approximately
$687,000.  
On January 26, 2018, Donna Koch, Esq., an attorney
representing the Department in the Flores lawsuit, emailed the Department and alleged
that Joy testified falsely.  AR 228.  She stated in her email that it had been
nearly four months since the trial and that POBRA applied.  AR 228.
 
h. The Appellate Reversal
On December 13, 2019, the appellate court reversed the
judgment against the County, concluding that Flores did not prevail on any of
her causes of action.  AR 230.
 
3. The Internal
Affairs Investigation
On August 30, 2017, Risk Manager Vicky Santana contacted the
Department’s Internal Affairs Bureau (“IA”) and alleged that Joy made false and
misleading statements during the administrative investigation, his depositions
under oath, and the Flores lawsuit regarding his relationship with Flores.  AR 334. 
IA Investigator Daniel
Rivera (“Rivera”) was assigned to conduct an investigation.  See AR 1267. On July 26, 2018, Investigator
Rivera issued a report of investigative findings which substantiated Joy’s violations
of policy concerning employee conduct, employee honesty, and employee
cooperation, and policy against rumors and slanderous remarks in the workplace.
 See AR 114.  
 
a. Joy’s IA
Interview
Investigator Rivera interviewed
Joy, who denied that he and Flores had anything beyond a professional work
relationship until the end of December 2014. 
AR 1267.
 
b. Moro’s IA
Interview
Investigator Rivera interviewed Moro.  AR 1333. 
She stated that she was first made aware that Joy was required to appear
for deposition on August 29, 2017.  AR
1333.  She received a text from Joy on
August 29 at 7:06 a.m. stating that he had bad news; he thought his deposition
was set for August 30 but instead it was set for August 29 at 10:00 a.m.  AR 1333, 1335.  
Joy was required to notify Moro before the day he missed
work that he would be out and the reason why. 
AR 1335.  He never provided her
with a copy of the deposition subpoena or order before August 29.  AR 1335. 
If he had told her at 7:06 a.m. on August 29 that he had a probation violation
report due, she would have had someone else do it or else contact the court to
see if they could get it in the next day. 
AR 1341.  The normal procedure
would not be for him to come to the office and prepare the report.  AR 1341. 
She never ordered him to come in and thought that he was at the “court” on
August 29 waiting for them to call him in [for the deposition].  AR 1342.
 
4. The Notice of
Intent to Discharge
On August 23, 2018, Joy was personally served with a Notice
of Intent to Discharge within the one-year requirement as required under POBRA.  AR 317; see AR 114.  The proof of service acknowledging receipt
was signed by Joy on the same day.  AR
114.  
On October 4, 2018, Joy and his representative had a Skelly
meeting with Senior Director Patrick Lemaire. 
AR 8.
 
5. The Notice of Discharge
On November 30, 2018, Joy received a Notice of Discharge from
his position of DPO based on violations of multiple department policies. AR
8-14.
The Notice of Discharge
was based on Joy’s failure to cooperate in an administrative investigation, providing
false information in an investigation, violation of a Departmental or
externally recognized code of ethics, unbecoming conduct, discourtesy, failure
to exercise sound judgment, and failure to follow established rules or
regulations.  AR 8-9.  The discharge was also based on violations of
Probation Department Policy Manual Nos. 601, 701, and 706, and Probation
Department Directives 1182, 1316, and 1335. 
AR 9.  The discharge further was
consistent with CSR 18.031.  AR 9.
The facts supporting
discharge included Joy’s false statements and testimony from December 4, 2014
through August 29, 2017 in the Flores lawsuit. 
AR 9.  Joy lied under oath during
his administrative interviews about his intimate relationship with Flores as of
May 30, 2014, made unfounded accusations against Supervising DPO (“SDPO”) Johnny
Randall (“Randall”) and SDPO Urkel, made false statements against SPDO Moro,
failed to provide honest and accurate responses in his testimony at the Flores
lawsuit trial, and made evasive and misleading statements in his IA interview
regarding his attendance at two depositions in the Flores lawsuit.  AR 9-11. 
His dishonesty discredited and embarrassed the Department and fell far
below the expectation for a peace officer. 
AR 12.  Therefore, he was
discharged.  AR 13. 
 
6. The Appeal
Hearing
Joy appealed.  A five-day hearing was held on
September 13, 2019, June 28-29, 2021, August 9, 2021, and February 14,
2022.  AR 108.  The witnesses testifying at the appeal
hearing were Rivera, Moro, Urkel, Joy, and Flores.  AR 110. 
The portions of their testimony cited in the parties’ briefs are as
follows.
 
a. Rivera
Rivera testified that, as part of his investigation, he
interviews possible witnesses and subjects of the investigation.  AR 1420. 
He made findings that Joy violated various policies supported by
substantiated evidence.  AR 1448.
As an investigator, he can compel someone working for the
Department to submit to an interview but cannot compel someone who does not
work for the County to do so.  AR 1439.  Flores was never a Department employee.  AR 1439. 

He interviewed Joy and
did not find him to be forthright in his answers.  AR 1466. 
He was evasive, which was concerning.  
AR 1466.  He read Joy’s
depositions and found his answers to be long-winded and evasive.  AR 1467. 
Joy refused to give direct answers to direct questions.  AR 1467. 

At his August 29
deposition, Joy testified that he was late because he received a work
instruction from Moro that he had to complete a court report prior to attending
his court-ordered testimony.  AR
1471.  Rivera provided Moro with Joy’s
testimony and she was shocked.  AR
1471-72.  She said that she never told
him not to appear for “a court report” because a report that he was responsible
to prepare had not been done.  AR
1472.  She explained what protocol she
would have followed if he had to be somewhere other than work.  AR 1472.
 
b. Moro
Moro testified as
follows.  When she was asked whether
Joy’s text message explained why his deposition was not going forward at 10:00
a.m., Moro testified that Joy’s text stated that the attorneys were having a
discussion about possibly continuing the matter and he was waiting to hear.  AR 1639. 
Joy did not tell her that the reason the deposition did not go forward
at 10:00 a.m. was because he had to write a report.  AR 1639.  Either you are in court because you have been
given something that says you are going to be in court, or you are at
work.  AR 1639.  You can’t just be at home.  AR 1639. 
She reviewed court reports authored by Joy.  AR 1645. 

 
c. Urkel
Urkel testified in
Joy’s appeal that Flores came to her office and told her that she and Joy were
having a sexual relationship, gave her details of that, and showed her texts in
April or beginning of May 2014.  AR 1662-63.  Flores showed her the texts on her
phone.  AR 1664.  Urkel could not remember the texts
verbatim.  AR 1664.  They were very sexual and flirtatious
texts.  AR 1663.  She called him “Daddy”.  AR 1664. 
She showed Urkel a picture of herself in lingerie and a picture of Joy’s
penis that he had sent to her.  AR
1664.  They had a full blown sexual  relationship and were in love.  AR 1664.
Urkel and DPO
Randall were friends.  AR 1677.  They became friends outside of work, but at
the pertinent time they were not.  AR
1677.  She has left her position with the
County.  AR 1682.
 
d. LaCarla
Williams
LaCarla Williams (“Williams”)
testified that she reviewed transcripts from Urkel where she talked about the
relationship of Flores and Joy.  AR
1731.  For the Skelly package, she
reviewed transcripts, statements, the equity panel’s recommendation, the IA
investigation, and the packet of information. 
AR 1732.  
Williams was unaware
if White received a three-day suspension for inappropriate conduct in the
incident.  AR 1735-36.  
 
e. Flores
Flores testified
that, on the pertinent date of May 30, 2014, she wanted to sell property.  AR 1784. 
Everybody in the office knew that Joy did real estate on the side, and
she wanted to ask him about zoning.  AR
1784.  At the time they were at the Mi
Ranchito restaurant, she and Joy were not romantically involved.  AR 1784. 
They discussed zoning issues in the parking lot of the restaurant.  AR 1784. 
They did not engage in sexual activity, her legs were not sticking out
the window, and they were not grinding each other.  AR 1784. 

She talked to Urkel
at the office but never discussed her sex life with Urkel.  AR 1786. 
She never showed Urkel any racy photos of herself or Joy and never
showed her any text messages from men. 
AR 186.
 
f. Joy
Joy testified that
he never worked with DPO White.  AR
1836.  He was not in an intimate
relationship with Flores on May 30, 2014, did not grind on her, hug or kiss
her, and there were no legs sticking out a window of a vehicle.  AR 1836-37. 
He began dating Flores in December 2014. 
AR 1837.  Prior to then, he did
not send text messages of a sexual manner and no photos were exchanged.  AR 1837-38.
 
7. The Hearing
Officer’s Proposed Decision
The Hearing Officer
issued a proposed decision on May 17, 2022. AR 108-38.   At the
outset of the proposed decision, the Hearing Officer addressed a concerning the
reopening of evidence to receive the Department’s 32 exhibits.  AR 111-13. 
The Hearing Officer also addressed a POBRA issue not relevant
herein.   AR 114, 123-24, 124-25.
 
a. The Department’s Position 
The Department
alleged that Joy was a DPO in a position of trust and integrity.  AR 120. 
Joy falsely denied ever being in an intimate relationship with Flores,
made discrediting and unfounded allegations against his co-workers, testified
falsely that he was required to file a court report before attending a
deposition, and failed to cooperate and gave misleading and evasive responses
in an investigation.  AR 121-22.
On May 30, 2014,
White found Joy and Flores in the parking lot of the restaurant “Mi
Ranchito”.  AR 121.  According to White, Joy and Flores were
kissing and grinding on each other in Joy’s car, with their feet dangling out
of the car.  AR 121.  White approached Flores, asked to talk to
her, and then left after a brief conversation. 
AR 122.  The next day Flores filed
a CPOE complaint in which she claimed to have been harassed by White.  AR 122. 
She filed the Flores lawsuit on July 1, 2016.  AR 122. 
The relationship between Flores and Joy was a critical issue in the Flores
lawsuit because Joy was the only witness to the May 30 incident.  AR 122.
During the
investigation, Joy provided deceitful and misleading statements about his
relationship with Flores, his co-workers, and supervisors.  AR 122. 
He provided slanderous statements that White was badmouthing him.  AR 122. 
Not only were his statements untruthful, he misled the investigation in
answering questions.  AR 122.  He refused to identify the person who heard
White spread lies about him, then vaguely identified Leonice Brown as one of
the people informing him that White was talking about him.  AR 122. 
He refused to provide other names out of a professed fear of
retaliation.  AR 122.  When he was ordered to answer the question,
he testified that he could not recall anyone else.  AR 122. 
It became evidence that no person said anything about White badmouthing
Joy.  AR 122.
On August 29, 2017,
Joy was deposed.  He was supposed to
appear at 10:00 a.m. but the deposition did not start until l:30 p.m.  AR 123. 
Joy testified that he was late because Moro made him prepare a probation
violation report.   AR 123.  He gave multiple inconsistent statements
about his relationship with Flores, as well as about his inability to show up
on time for his deposition that day.  AR
121.  He also gave dishonest testimony
about his co-workers.  AR 121.
On June 29, 2021,
during his appeal hearing, Joy testified that he knew the probation violation report
was due on the day of his deposition without Moro reminding him.  AR 123. 
This testimony was contrary to his deposition testimony on August 29.
2017.  AR 123.
On October 3, 2017,
the second day of the Flores lawsuit trial, he made false and conflicting
statements about his relationship with Flores. 
This was extremely important for Flores’ civil case, which was built on
lies against White.  AR 121.  Joy gave repeatedly false testimony about
whether he had a sexual relationship with Flores prior to the May 30, 2014
incident.  AR 121.  One of the main issues litigated in the
Flores lawsuit was the harassment claim by Flores against White.  Joy’s testimony supported Flores’ claims and
impugned White, who was a colleague.  AR
121.
Given that the jury
verdict was overturned, the County has no motive to retaliate against Joy for
testifying in the Flores lawsuit.  AR
123.[3]
 
b. Analysis and
Findings of Fact
The Hearing Officer
found the allegations in the Notice of Discharge to be true.  AR 126-27. 
The investigation, deposition, and Flores trial transcripts show that
Joy gave untrue and conflicting statements and testimony during the period of
December 4, 2014 through April 29, 2017. 
AR 127.  He repeatedly stated that
he could not recall dates for the beginning of his relationship with, and
subsequent marriage to, Flores but he could recall the commendations he
received over his career.  AR 127.  Flores also could not recall information,
including her address in Valencia.  AR
127.   The Hearing Officer found neither of
Joy and Flores to be credible.   AR 127.
On May 30, 2014, Joy
and Flores were involved in an off-duty incident that resulted in Flores’ CEOP
complaint against White and the Flores lawsuit. 
AR 131.  On December 5, 2014, Joy
told Deputy Compliance Officer Koressel that his relationship with Flores was
“strictly professional”.  AR 131.  However, Joy testified during the Flores
trial that their relationship began in December 2014.  AR 131. 
On October 3, 2017, he testified during the Flores trial that the
relationship began around November/December 2014.  AR 131-32. 
Joy and Flores both divorced their spouses and married on December 17,
2016.  AR 131.
The testimony of
Erkel, the investigative findings of Galley Associates, the sworn statements of
Randall[4]
and White, and the evasive testimony by Joy and Flores at Joy’s administrative
appeal hearing established that the two had an intimate relationship prior to
May 30, 2014.  AR 132.
Flores recalled that
she worked in the AB 109 program [where Joy worked] in 2013-14 but could not
remember when she met Joy, provided conflicting testimony regarding the
beginning of their relationship, and could not recall the date of her divorce,
her address in 2014, of if she was divorced when she began dating Joy.  AR 132. 
She was evasive about when she moved in with Joy.  AR 132.
Joy lied when he denied
telling SDPO Randall that he was involved with Flores.  AR 132. 
Joy lied at trial and made unfounded accusations against White.  AR 133. 
He lied under oath that SDPO Moro required him to report to the office
and complete a probation violation report before attending his deposition set
for 10:00 a.m. on August 29, 201.  AR
133. He was aware of the due date per the Department’s PEDUMS System, which
notifies DPOs three days before reports are due.  AR 133. 
Joy’s statement to Moro on August 29 that the attorneys were talking
about rescheduling his deposition that morning is unsupported by his deposition
testimony that Moro required him to come to the office and complete the
report.  AR 133.  
Joy failed to provide
credible testimony during the CEOP investigation regarding the May 30, 2014
incident, during the IA investigation, and throughout the Flores lawsuit
trial.  AR 133-34.  Joy engaged in a pattern of evasiveness and
dishonesty.  AR 134.  The Department met its burden proving that
the allegations contained in the Notice of Discharge dated March 16, 2018 were
true.  AR 134.  
 
c. Penalty
Decision-maker
Williams testified that DPOs must be honest and accurate.  AR 127. 
Joy lied under oath, accused co-workers, and lied to supervisors.  AR 127.  
There is no tolerance for dishonesty. 
AR 127.  Williams did not
recommend a lesser discipline because, when an officer has a track record of
lying, it creates a credibility issue for their reports and testimony in
court.  AR 127.  Joy had no prior history of lying, but Williams
made the decision to discharge based on the totality of the case.  AR 127.
Joy was a DPO with
at least 25 years of experience and violated Department policies.  AR 129-30. 
The Department’s investigation was fair and substantial evidence
demonstrates his dishonesty.  Joy failed
to present mitigating factors that would warrant reversal of the discharge
decision.  AR 130.  The Hearing Officer recommended that the
imposed discharge be sustained. AR 135. 
 
8. The Commission’s
Final Decision
Joy objected to the Hearing
Officer’s proposed decision.  AR
141.   On January 30, 2023, the Commission,
on a 3-2 vote, approved the Hearing Officer’s findings, overruled Joy’s
objections, and adopted the Hearing Officer’s recommendation sustaining
discharge.  AR 185-86. 
 
E. Analysis
Petitioner Joy challenges the Hearing Officer’s decision[5] on
the grounds that (1) IA’s investigation was inadequate, (2) there is insufficient
evidence that Joy and Flores were in an intimate relationship on May 30, 2014, (3)
the decision failed to show the analytic route required by Topanga for
the discipline, and (4) the penalty of discharge is excessive.
 
1. Adequacy of
the Investigation
Joy notes that IA
Officer Rivera was assigned the investigation into the allegations against Joy.  Rivera testified that an investigation into
peace officer misconduct requires that the investigator engage in fact finding
and conduct interviews with relevant witnesses.  AR 1420. 
When asked if he conducts interviews, Rivera responded: “Yes. With all
persons involved.” AR 1420.  However,
Rivera only interviewed a single witness, SDPO Moro, in his investigation.  AR 353. 
Rivera neglected to interview Flores, White, Randall, Parsons, and Urkel.
 All these witnesses were available to
the Department as they were either employed by the County or named witnesses in
the Flores lawsuit.  Pet. Op. Br. at 9-10.
Additionally, the
Department’s evidence consisted of selected trial and deposition transcripts
from the Flores lawsuit.  The testimony in
each of these transcripts was made in contemplation of civil litigation.  They were not investigative interviews
conducted to determine if allegations of Joy’s misconduct were true. The
Department simply pulled selected information from these transcripts and used
them to summarily conclude that Joy had committed misconduct.  Pet. Op. Br. at 10.
Real
Party explains that Rivera testified that he cannot compel someone who does not
work for the County to be interviewed. 
AR 1439.  Flores was not an
employee of the County at the time of the IA investigation and Parsons was
never an employee of the County. The testimony transcripts of Randall, Flores,
and White made during the Flores lawsuit trial was available for Rivera to
review and incorporate into his investigation. The core of the investigation
was the false statements Joy made under oath, and the evidence to prove those
false statements occurred in the depositions and at the Flores trial.   There was no need for interviews of these
witnesses.  Rivera interviewed Moro
because her statement was needed to prove Joy’s lies at the August 29, 2017,
deposition when he testified that Moro instructed him to finish the report that
morning.  Opp. at 14.
It is not clear
what point Joy is making.  The Hearing
Officer specifically found Rivera’s investigation to be fair.  AR 130. 
Joy points to no law that an agency’s investigation must thorough and
complete.  If it is not, that is an issue
of unreliability that the accused may raise at the administrative hearing or in
court.  To the extent that Rivera’s
investigation was incomplete because he did not interview pertinent witnesses,
Joy points to no unreliability and therefore no prejudice.  Presumably, he had the ability to subpoena witnesses
to testify at his appeal hearing, and he makes no showing that any witnesses
only were available to the Department.  Joy
also knew what these prospective witnesses would say because he had prior
testimony or witness statements from all of them.  
As for the allegedly
misleading nature of the deposition and trial transcripts from the Flores
lawsuit, that is something Joy could have argued at his administrative appeal.  Yet, he provides no citation in the
administrative record that he did so.  Joy
cannot make a blanket objection that the Department used the Flores lawsuit deposition
and trial transcripts to pull out selective, but incomplete, information.  He is required to make specific rule of
completeness objections and has not done so.[6]
 
2. The Sufficiency
of the Evidence Concerning the Relationship of Joy and Flores on May 30, 2014
Joy is correct (Pet.
Op. Br. at 12) that the Hearing Officer’s decision – indeed, almost the
Department’s entire case -- relies on the finding that he was involved in an
intimate relationship with Flores as of May 30, 2014.  This intimate relationship was a key fact in
the Flores lawsuit in which Flores claimed that the culmination of harassment
by the Department and White occurred on that date.  If there was a sexual relationship on May 30,
2014, then Joy lied repeatedly in his interviews, deposition, and testimony at
the Flores lawsuit trial, and also at his administrative hearing.  If he did not, it seems likely that his remaining
lies and evasiveness probably would not have led to his discharge.  
Joy contends that
the Department failed to establish that intimate relationship as of May 30,
2014.  Both he and Flores testified that
they were not in a romantic relationship on that date.  AR1784-85, 1836-37.  No other witnesses could provide testimony to
credibly refute this fact.  The Hearing
Officer’s decision relied on circumstantial hearsay evidence to conclude that Joy’s
denial of an intimate relationship with Flores was dishonest.  Her decision also unfairly placed the burden
on Joy to establish by preponderance of evidence that he was not in an
intimate relationship with Flores as of May 30, 2014.  See AR 119 (finding that Joy’s
testimony was unsupported by any type of definitive evidence).  Pet. Op. Br. at 10.
Joy correctly notes
that CSR 4.10(B) permits hearsay evidence, but it is not sufficient alone to
support a finding unless it would be admissible over objection in civil
actions. In other words, the Department could rely on hearsay evidence, but
only when it is corroborated by other evidence. Pet. Op. Br. at 11.  Joy essentially argues that all the
Department’s evidence of his intimate relationship with Flores was
uncorroborated hearsay.  He is incorrect.
 
a. Urkel
Urkel testified at
the Flores trial that “very soon after [Joy] started in the office they were
dating or flirting or texting. I don’t know what you would call it. But she
[Flores] was sharing that with me.” AR 1075.  
Flores did not use the term “dating”, but she would usually come into Urkel’s
office because it was private and shut the door.  AR 1075. 
She would share with Urkel text messages and pictures that she (Flores
and Joy had sent to each other.  She was
very excited about seeing him.  AR
1075-76.  She would make a lot of hand
gestures and had body language about their being with him. AR 1076. Flores
showed her “racy pictures that she had sent him of herself in lingerie, a
picture that he had sent to her of his genitalia, looking down at himself.”  AR 1076. 

All the texts Flores
showed her between Joy and herself were non-business related but rather of a
sexual nature. AR 1077-78.  She called
him “Daddy” and texted “I can’t wait to F. you.”  AR 1078. 
These events probably would have been in May 2014.  AR 1077. 
When asked if it was before May 30, 2014, Urkel responded “I believe
so.” AR 1077.  
Urkel testified at
Joy’s appeal hearing that Flores came to her office and told her that she and
Joy were having a sexual relationship, gave her details of that, and showed her
texts in April or beginning of May 2014. 
AR 1662-63.  Flores showed her the
texts on her phone.  AR 1664.  Urkel could not remember the texts
verbatim.  AR 1664.  They were very sexual and flirtatious
texts.  AR 1663.  She called him “Daddy”.  AR 1664. 
She showed Urkel a picture of herself in lingerie and a picture of Joy’s
penis that he had sent to her.  AR 1664.  They had a full-blown sexual relationship and
were in love.  AR 1664.
Joy argues that no
witness corroborated Urkel’s hearsay testimony that Flores disclosed her sexual
relationship with Joy, including showing Urkel a picture of Joy’s unclothed
genitals on her cell phone.  Flores also
testified that she never disclosed intimate details about Officer Joy to Urkel.
AR 1786.  Pet. Op. Br. at 11.
Joy is incorrect.  Urkel’s testimony about what Flores told her arguably
is a declaration against interest and separately admissible in a civil action.  Evid. Code §1230.  Even if it is inadmissible hearsay, it may be
used to corroborate other evidence.  More
important, the texts from Joy that Flores showed to Urkel are Joy’s party
admissions and admissible in a civil action. 
Evid. Code §1220. The racy pictures between Flores and Joy are not
hearsay at all and also are admissible. 
Thus, Urkel’s testimony provided significant evidence of a sexual
relationship between Joy and Flores in April or early May 2014.
 
b. Randall
Joy notes that Urkel
testified at the administrative hearing that she spoke to SDPO Johnny Randall
about Joy’s sexual relationship with Flores. 
Joy contends that this statement is hearsay as Randall did not testify
to corroborate the statements Urkel attributed to him.  In fact, it was discovered during the hearing
that Urkel had an outside relationship with Randall.  AR 1677. 
Joy told IA investigators that he believed Urkel and Randall had a
relationship that transcended a work relationship and Urkel admitted in her
testimony that she had a friendship with Randall, including Randall visiting her
at her home.  Urkel further testified that
she considers Randall a friend, has maintained a relationship with him even after
she left County employment, they have “got together” a few times, and Randall
lives close to her home.  AR 1682.  Pet. Op. Br. at 11-12.
Joy argues that the
Department failed to call Randall as a witness.  As a result, Randall could not authenticate
his IA transcript, nor corroborate any of the statements in it.  The Hearing Officer abused her discretion by
relying on Randall’s transcript for Finding of Fact #15, which relied solely on
the hearsay statements of Randall.  AR 132.  Pet. Op. Br. at 12.
Joy is correct that, since Randall did not testify, his IA
interview transcript is hearsay that could be used only to corroborate other
evidence.  Unfortunately, neither party’s
brief cites the transcript, and the court does not know precisely what Randall
said in his interview.  Apparently, Randall
provided a sworn statement that Joy
admitted he had an intimate relationship with Flores.  AR 132 (Finding 15).  If so, Joy’s statement to Randall would be a
party admission but Randall’s statement to Rivera would be hearsay that can be
used only corroborate others.  Randall
need not authenticate his interview because Rivera testified and presumably did
so.
 
c. White
White testified at
the Flores trial that on May 30, 2014, he slowly drove around.  AR 1203. 
The car was parked, and he got out of his vehicle and walked up to the
other car.   AR 1203.  As he walked up, he realized it was Joy and
Flores.  AR 1203.  He sat there and watched for a little
while.  AR 1203.  They were kissing and grinding, and he
watched out of curiosity.  AR 1203.  
Joy argues that the Department failed to call White as a
witness at the administrative hearing.  As
a result, White could not authenticate his IA transcript, nor corroborate any
of the statements in it.  The Hearing
Officer abused her discretion by relying on hearsay statements in White’s transcript.
 See AR 132.  Pet. Op. Br. at 12.
White’s trial
testimony in the Flores lawsuit was not an IA interview.  (There may have been an IA interview but the
parties do not cite to one.)  White was
not required to authenticate his trial testimony if someone else did so.  (It is not clear who did so or whether it was
received without objection.)  Once
received into evidence, White’s trial testimony was not hearsay.
Joy argues that White’s credibility was impeached at the administrative
hearing when evidence was presented that White was dishonest about his
involvement in the Mi Ranchito incident.  White’s statements should be wholly
disregarded as lacking all credibility as he was disciplined for misconduct
stemming from the very same incident at the heart of the instant matter.  AR 232. 
Yet, decisionmaker Williams testified that she was unaware that White
was disciplined for his role in the Mi Ranchito incident when she made her
decision to discharge. AR 1735–36. Pet. Op. Br. at 12-13.
There is no admissible evidence that White was disciplined
as a result of the May 30, 2014 incident. 
Facts set forth in an appellate decision are not admissible as
evidence.  See Sosinsky v.
Grant, (1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 1548, 1551. 
Even if the facts from the appellate decision were admissible, the
decision states only that White was assigned to another office during the
investigation and instructed not to discuss Flores’ complaint with other
employees.  RJN Ex. A, p. 21.  That is not discipline.  Moreover, the jury verdict in White’s favor,
the appellate reversal of the judgment against the County, and the facts of
this case indicate that any discipline for White was wrongly imposed.
 
d. Exhibit 18
The Department’s Exhibit 18 was Gailey Associates’ report of
interviews of Parsons and Arana.  Parsons was interviewed on July 31,
2017.  AR 1228.  She stated that Joy was acting weird in June
2014 when they went to see her father in Arizona.  AR 1228. 
She confronted him about having an affair, which he denied.  AR 1228. 
A week after they returned home, she went downstairs at 4:00 a.m. and
found Joy sleeping next to a phone that she had never seen before.  AR 1228. 
She was about to unlock it and read several text messages from Flores
which clearly indicated they were romantically involved.  AR 1228. 
There were many loving comments using the words “honey” and “baby”.  AR 1229. 
There were also messages “I can’t talk” because she (Parsons) had
entered the room.  AR 1229.  She confronted Joy and he initially denied
the affair.  AR 1228.  Later that morning, he admitted the affair
and she made him pack his bags and leave that day.  AR 1228. 
She did not know when the affair began. 
AR 1228.
In June or July
2014, Joy moved into the Provenance Apartments. 
AR 1229.  Joy wanted to see his
children and Parsons went to the apartment to inspect it.  AR 1229. 
She observed Flores clothes and a room set up for Flores’ children.  AR 1229. 
Joy claimed that Flores and her children only stayed at the apartment
sometimes.  AR 1229.  Parsons filed for divorce in July 2014.  AR 1229. 

Arana was
interviewed and stated that he was married to Flores, and they divorced mainly
because of Joy.  AR 1231.  He had suspicions that Flores was cheating on
him for many months.  AR 1231.  He “probably” found text messages but would
not provide details.  AR 1231.  He confronted Joy about the affair in May
2013, and Joy denied it, saying that Arana was delusional.  AR 1231. 
Flores also initially denied the affair but admitted it in June or July
2013.  AR 1231.  Approximately a month later, Flores moved
into an apartment in Santa Clarita.  AR
1231.[7]
Joy argues that the Hearing Officer erred in relying on
Exhibit 18.  AR 132, 1227.  The Parsons interview, conducted with Joy’s ex-wife
after they divorced, was conducted in contemplation of the Flores lawsuit, not
Joy’s disciplinary case.  It was not a
regularly kept business record of the Department.  The author, Nicole Tahmasian, did not testify
at the hearing.  Thus, the document lacked
authentication and constituted inadmissible hearsay. The report also contained
double hearsay as to the statements attributed to Parsons or Arana (Flores’
ex-husband).  Joy objected to the Hearing
Officer’s use of the document as inadmissible hearsay.  AR 161. 
Yet, the Hearing Officer relied
upon it to conclude that Joy
and Flores were in a relationship prior
to May 30, 2014.  AR 132.  She abused her discretion in doing so.  Pet. Op. Br. at 13-14.
Joy fails to show
that he objected to the authenticity of Exhibit 18.  The court agrees, however, that Exhibit 18
contains Gailey Associates’ hearsay interviews of Parsons and Arana.  AR 1227. 
These interviews are admissible to corroborate other evidence that Joy
and Flores were romantically involved no later than June or July 2014.
 
e. Conclusion
The testimony of
Erkel and White, corroborated by the hearsay evidence in the Galley Associates
interviews of Parsons and Arana, and the apparent sworn statement of Johnny
Randall, established that Joy and Flores had an intimate relationship prior to
May 30, 2014.  AR 132.   Therefore, Joy repeatedly lied to the
contrary in interviews and while under oath.
 
3. Compliance with Topanga
Topanga requires the
hearing officer to issue findings that give enough explanation so that parties
may determine whether, and upon what basis, to review the decision.  11 Cal.3d at 514-15. Implicit in CCP section
1094.5 is a requirement that the agency set forth findings to bridge the
analytic gap between the raw evidence and ultimate decision or order.  Id. at 115.
Joy argues that the Hearing Officer’s findings fail to
provide the parties with sufficient grounds to conclude that the discharge was
appropriate.  They Hearing Officer provided
nothing more than a cursory analysis that essentially copied and pasted the language
found in the Notice of Discharge and the parties’ briefs.  
Joy contends that the Hearing Officer wrote a mere three
sentences of analysis as to the appropriateness of the discipline.  AR 129-30. 
The Hearing Officer failed to meet the Topanga standard,
depriving the court and Joy of the ability to determine how she decided the appropriateness
of the discipline.  Commissioner Segal
stated: “I'm also, [voting] no, I'm really troubled by this case and I don't
know what the right outcome is, but I do know that I agree with counsel when he
talks about the lack of analysis applied here with regard to the discipline.
And I'm just troubled with some of the other points that have been raised.”  AR 2052. 
Pet. Op. Br. at 14, 18.
While Topanga requires adequate findings for an
administrative decision, they need not be stated with formality.  It is sufficient that the findings enable the
court to determine that the agency found the necessary facts to support its
determination.  Kateen v. Department
of Real Estate, (1985) 169 Cal.App.3d 481, 485.  In state agency disciplinary matters, Topanga
does not require penalty findings.  Williamson
v. Board of Medical Quality Assurance, (1990) 217 Cal.App.3d 1343,
1346.  Under Govt. Code section 11518, the
agency is only required to justify the penalty actually imposed, including a
statement of the factual and legal basis for the decision, and there is no
legal obligation to outline the reasons for rejecting a less form of
discipline.  Oduyale v. California
State Board of Pharmacy, (2019) 41 Cal.App.5th 101, 113.  Joy points to nothing in the CSR 18 or County
ordinances that requires penalty findings.
In any event, the Hearing Officer expressly found that Joy failed to provide credible testimony
during the CEOP investigation regarding the May 30, 2014 incident, during the
IA investigation, and in the depositions and trial of the Flores lawsuit.  AR 133-34. 
Joy lied when he denied telling SDPO Randall that he was involved with
Flores.  AR 132.  Joy lied at trial and made unfounded
accusations against White.  AR 133.  He lied under oath that SDPO Moro required
him to report to the office and complete a probation violation report before
attending his deposition set for 10:00 a.m. on August 29, 201.  AR 133.  Joy engaged in a pattern of evasiveness and
dishonesty.  AR 134.  
Decision-maker
Williams testified that DPOs must be honest and accurate.  AR 127. 
Joy lied under oath, accused co-workers, and lied to supervisors.  AR 127.  
There is no tolerance for dishonesty. 
AR 127.  Williams did not
recommend a lesser discipline for Joy because, when an officer has a track
record of lying, it creates a credibility issue for their reports and testimony
in court.  AR 127.  Joy had no prior history of lying, but Williams
made the decision to discharge him based on the totality of the case.  AR 127.
The Hearing Officer
found that Joy was a DPO with at least 25 years of experience and violated
Department policies.  AR 129-30.  Joy failed to present mitigating factors that
would warrant reversal of the discharge decision.  AR 130. 
The Hearing Officer recommended that the discharge be sustained.  AR 135. These findings are sufficient
to meet any Topanga requirement for public employee discharge from a
local agency.
 
4. The Appropriate Penalty
Joy disputes his
discharge as an appropriate penalty.  He
argues that the Department developed an animus towards Joy when he testified as
Flores’ witness in her lawsuit.  Joy’s
testimony was crucial as he was the sole witness to the encounter between White
and Flores at the Mi Ranchito restaurant in Lancaster.  Joy’s testimony assisted the jury in
understanding the level of mistreatment White directed at Flores.  Pet. Op. Br. at 14.
Ultimately, the
jury found in Flores’ favor leading to a large monetary verdict against the
County.  Flores and her attorneys were
awarded over $700,000 in damages and attorney fees. After the trial, an
attorney representing the Department, Donna Koch, Esq., emailed the Department
and summarily alleged that Joy was untruthful in his testimony without any
supporting facts.  She reminded the
Department to be mindful of the POBRA statute of limitations within Govt. Code section
3300.  AR 227-28.  As a result of the email, the Department
conducted a cursory investigation and unjustly discharged Joy from his
permanent position in bad faith and without just cause.  Pet. Op. Br. at 15.
Joy had never been
suspended during his lengthy career.  He
had no previous discipline other than a letter of reprimand in 2010.  AR 12. 
He also had no history of dishonesty despite nearly 25 years of service
to the Department.  Pet. Op. Br. at 18.
 No evidence established that he had any
propensity to lie while employed by the Department.  His credibility was never impeached at the
Flores trial.  The Department simply
found his testimony to be unfavorable and imposed the highest level of
discipline as a result.  As often occurs,
the Department stacked multiple bases for discipline to substantiate an
unreasonably high level of discipline.  Many
of these bases rely on the same underlying allegations.  Once the overlapping bases are removed, the Hearing
Officer should have concluded that, even if some allegations were true, discharge
was not warranted under the disciplinary guidelines.  Pet. Op. Br. at 15-17.
Joy demonstrated
no willful disregard for his duties or the safety of those around him and
merely made good faith statements about what he had witnessed.  None of his testimony had a direct nexus to
the services he provided to probationers as a public employee.  The Hearing Officer heard lengthy testimony
from both Joy and Moro regarding his application to duties and his impressive
service history with the Department.  Moro
testified about her interactions with Joy and that she reviewed his reports and
found them to be honest and accurate as well as always timely submitted.  AR 1645. 
Despite this evidence, the Hearing Officer provided no discussion about
the impact of his positive service history. 
Pet. Op. Br. at 17.
Joy received more
than 37 written letters of appreciation and commendation from a variety of
individuals over his nearly 25-year career with the Department.  AR 248-313. 
These letters of appreciation and commendation are objective proof that
he spent nearly 25 years serving both the Department and the clients entrusted to
its care.  The Hearing Officer failed to give
weight to this evidence in determining whether discharge was the appropriate
level of discipline.  Pet. Op. Br. at 16.
The purpose of
public employee discipline is to correct behavior, and when necessary, remove
those employees who hinder the Department’s successful operation.  Joy did not hinder the operation of the
Department and his contributions in his nearly 25-year career were immensely
valuable to the Department.  The Hearing
Officer had insufficient evidence to sustain a discharge.  Pet. Op. Br. at 17-18.
The court’s powers are limited and exercised with great
deference to the Commission’s decision on the question of penalty.  See Deegan
v. City of Mountain View, (“Deegan”) (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th
37, 45.  Neither an appellate court nor a
trial court is free to substitute its discretion for that of the administrative
agency concerning the degree of punishment imposed.  Nightingale, supra, 7 Cal.3d at
515.  It is only in an exceptional case
that an abuse of discretion is shown because reasonable minds cannot differ on
the propriety of penalty.  Deegan,
supra, 72 Cal.App.4th at
45.  The agency’s discretion is not
unfettered, however, and the court may find an abuse where the decision exceeds
the bounds of reason.  Kolender v. San
Diego Civil Service Commission, (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 464,
471.  
In determining whether there has been an abuse of
discretion, the court must examine the extent of the harm to the public
service, the circumstances surrounding the misconduct, and the likelihood that
such conduct will recur.  Skelly, supra,
15 Cal.3d at 217-18.  In weighing
these factors, the court considers the nature of the employee's profession,
“since some occupations such as law enforcement, carry responsibilities and
limitations on personal freedom not imposed on those in other fields.”  Cate v. State Personnel Board, (“Cate”)
(2012) 204 Cal.App.4th 270, 284 
 
a. The
Circumstances of Misconduct and Harm to Public Service
The harm to public service is by far the most important
consideration.  Joy is correct that his testimony
in the Flores lawsuit was crucial because he was the sole witness to the
encounter between White and Flores at the Mi Ranchito restaurant in Lancaster.  He is incorrect, however, that the jury
rendered a large monetary verdict.  It
found against Flores with respect to White and against the County for only approximately
$62,000 in damages.  The trial judge then
awarded approximately $687,000 in attorney fees.  
Joy also probably is correct that the Department developed
an animus towards him because of his testimony in Flores’ lawsuit.  Joy is wrong, however, that the investigation
was triggered by the January 26, 2018 email from attorney Donna Koch, Esq. AR 227-28.  The IA investigation was triggered months
earlier, on August 30, 2017, when Risk Manager Vicky Santana contacted the IA and
alleged that Joy made false and misleading statements during his
deposition.  AR 334. 
In any event, there is no question that Joy’s misconduct
caused harm to the public service.  His
repeated lies cost the County the expense of defending the Flores lawsuit
through trial and on appeal, as well as the expense of Rivera’s IA investigation.  Joy’s lies violated the Department tenants of
honor, dignity, and wisdom, and put the Department’s reputation at risk,
exposing it to ridicule by other Department employees and members of the
public.  
Joy’s false statements have a significant impact on his
ability to perform the duties of a probation officer because he is expected to
be able to function as law enforcement investigators and testify in criminal
cases.  Should Joy have to testify in a
criminal prosecution, his credibility would be impacted.  He could be examined on his false statements,
both in his interviews, depositions, and under oath.  This information would be discoverable by a
defense attorney through a Brady or Pitchess motion.  The public is not required to pay the salary
of a peace officer who cannot perform one of his/her essential duties.  
Honesty, credibility, and temperament are crucial to the
proper performance of an officer's duties, and dishonesty is incompatible with
public trust.  Kolender v. San Diego
Civil Service Commission, (“Kolender”) (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 716, 721.  It is true that not every Department employee
must be discharged when guilty of dishonesty. 
But it is also true that peace officers are held to higher standards,
honesty is crucial to the proper performance of an officer’s duties, and
dishonesty by law enforcement is treated harshly.  Cate, supra, 204 Cal.App.4th at 285. 
“[W]e know of no rule of law holding every deputy sheriff is entitled to
[tell one lie] before he or she can be discharged.”  Kolender, supra, 132 Cal.App.4th
at 723.  
 
b. Likelihood the Misconduct
Will Recur  
Joy continued to provide false statements for several
years.  It may be unlikely that he would
have to support Flores again with false testimony.  Nonetheless, he clearly would do so if the
occasion arose.  In any event, repeated
acts of intentional dishonesty are grounds to dismiss a peace officer.  See Kolender, supra, 132 Cal.App.4th at 721 (discharge appropriate
when peace officer made false statements during investigation into inmate abuse
despite later telling the truth); Paulino v. Civil Serv. Com., (1985)
175 Cal.App.3d 962, 972 (upholding discharge of peace officer who repeatedly
made false statements about being sick); Cate,
supra, 204 Cal.App.4th at
285 (discharge appropriate when peace officer made false statements during
investigation into inmate’s suicide attempt). 

 
c. Conclusion
This is not the exceptional case that an abuse of discretion
is shown because reasonable minds cannot differ on the propriety of
penalty.  Joy’s repeated acts of
dishonesty caused serious harm to the County and justify his discharge.  
 
F. Conclusion
The petition for writ of mandate
is denied.  Real Party Department’s
counsel is ordered to prepare a proposed judgment, serve it on Joy’s counsel
for approval as to form, wait ten days after service for any objections, meet
and confer if there are objections, and then submit the proposed judgment along
with a declaration stating the existence/non-existence of any unresolved
objections.  An OSC re: judgment is set for May 16, 2024 at 9:30 a.m.
