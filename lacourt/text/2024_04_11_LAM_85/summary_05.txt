Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the petition for leave to file a late claim filed by Paul Dawson against the Housing Authority for the City of Los Angeles. Dawson's counsel failed to act diligently in presenting a claim to Housing Authority, and Dawson's failure to file a timely claim was due to mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. The court found that Dawson's counsel failed to present a claim to Housing Authority, and Dawson's reliance on communications with a third-party insurer and its claims adjuster did not constitute presentation of a claim to Housing Authority. The court also found that Dawson's counsel failed to act diligently in presenting a claim to Housing Authority, and Dawson's failure to file a timely claim was due to mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.
