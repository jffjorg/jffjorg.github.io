Id.
 
B. Applicable Law
Under the Government Claims Act ( the “Claims Act”), a
plaintiff bringing suit for monetary damages against a public entity or
employees thereof must first present a claim to the public entity (“government
claim”) which must be acted upon or deemed rejected by the public entity.  Government Code[1]
§§945.4, 950.2, 950.6(a).  To be timely,
a government claim for damages must be presented to the public entity within six
months of the date the cause of action accrued. 
§911.2. 
If a plaintiff fails to file a government claim within the six-month
period, he or she may apply to the public entity for permission to file a late
claim. §911.4.  Such an application must
be presented within a reasonable time, and not later than one year after the
cause of action’s accrual. 
§911.4(b).  
If the public entity denies the application for permission
to file a late claim, the plaintiff may file a civil petition for relief from
section 945.4's requirement of timely claim presentation prior to suit.  §946.6. 
The petition must be filed within six months after the application to
the public entity is denied or deemed to be denied.  §946.6(b). The petition must show: (1) that
an application was made to the public entity under section 911.4 and was denied
or deemed denied; (2) the reason for failure to timely present the claim to the
public entity within the time limit specified in section 911.2; and (3) the
information required by section 910. 
§946.6(b).



The court shall grant relief only if it finds that (1) the
application to the public entity for leave to file a late claim was made within
a reasonable time not to exceed one year after accrual of the claim as
specified in section 911.4(b), (2) was denied or deemed denied by the public
agency pursuant to section 911.6,  and
(3) one or more of the following is applicable: (a) the failure to timely
present the claim was through mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable
neglect, unless the public entity establishes that it would be prejudiced in
the defense of the claim if the court relieves the petitioner from the
requirements of section 945.4; (b) the person who sustained the alleged injury,
damage or loss was a minor during all of the time specified in section 911.2
for the presentation of the claim; (c) the person who sustained the alleged
injury, damage or loss was physically or mentally incapacitated during all of
the time specified in section 911.2 for the presentation of the claim and by
reason of that disability failed to present a claim during that time; or (d)
the person who sustained the alleged injury, damage or loss died before the
expiration of the time specified in section 911.2 for the presentation of the
claim.  §946.6(c).
 
C. Statement of
Facts
Dawson was injured on April 5, 2023.  On the same day, Dawson retained the law
office of Sweet James Accident Attorneys, LLP (“Former Counsel”) to represent
him on his bodily injury claim. Kocaj Decl., ¶2.  In April 2023, Former Counsel paid for and
requested a copy of the Los Angeles Police Department (“LAPD”) traffic collision
report.  Kocaj Decl., ¶4.  The report was not provided to Dawson’s
former counsel until October 16, 2023. Id.  
On July 5, 2023, Dawson retained trial counsel Law Offices
of Samer Habbas & Associates, P.C. (“Current Counsel”) for the purposes of
filing a lawsuit on his claim.  Kocaj
Decl., ¶3.  At the time of substitution,
Current Counsel was under the impression, based on correspondence in the file, that
Former Counsel had presented a claim via government tort claim form to Housing
Authority.  Kocaj Decl., ¶6. 
On November 1, 2023, Current Counsel became aware of the
possibility that a claim form had not been presented to the City in a manner
that complied with the Claims Act.  Kocaj
Decl., ¶8.  
Current Counsel understands that the following occurred with
Former Counsel from April 12 through June 14, 2023.  Kocaj Decl., ¶¶ 10-20.  
On our around April 12, 2023, Former Counsel representative
Darwin Flores contacted the “Risk Retention Group for Housing Authority” to
open the claim.  Kocaj Decl., ¶11.  On April 17, 2023, Former Counsel filed a
claim letter with “the City’s Risk Retention Group”.  Kocaj Decl., ¶12.  
On or around April 21, 2023, Koning & Associates, the claims
adjuster for Housing Authority Risk Retention Group, sent an email to Former
Counsel confirming receipt of Former Counsel’s representation letter for Dawson.  Kocaj Decl., ¶¶ 15-16, Ex. B. 
On June 14, 2023, Koning & Associates informed Former
Counsel that it had been retained to assist in gathering facts about the
incident and that Housing Authority Risk Retention Group, the liability insurer
for Housing Authority, would make all decisions on liability and damages.  Kocaj Decl. ¶20, Ex. C.
On July 7, 2023, Current Counsel contacted Former Counsel
and received information that the traffic collision report had been paid for
and not received from LAPD.  Kocaj Decl.,
¶23.  On July 12, 2023, Current Counsel
sent a letter of representation to the Housing Authority Risk Retention Group that
Current Counsel was substituting in for Former Counsel.  Kocaj Decal., ¶¶ 24-25, Ex. D.  Current Counsel sent an email the same day
asking about the status of liability. 
Kocaj Decl., ¶26, Ex. E.  Risk Retention
Group responded, confirming receipt and stating that it has been retained by
Housing Authority to assist in its investigation of Dawson’s incident.  Kocaj Decl., ¶28.
Various communications occurred between Current Counsel and Koning
& Associates from July 21 to October 2023. 
Kocaj Decl., ¶¶ 31-55, Exs. E-G. 
Koning & Associates always identified itself as the claims adjuster
working for the Housing Authority’s liability insurer, Housing Authority Risk
Retention Group.  See Ex. F.
            On
November 1, 2023, Konig & Associates emailed Current Counsel, informing it
that “the City ‘never received a tort claim for this incident.’”  Kocaj Decl., ¶56.  Current Counsel emailed Konig &
Associates a response that it understood that a claim was presented by Former
Counsel, hence the claim number and notice regarding the claim.  Kocaj Decl., ¶57.
            Current
Counsel served the Housing Authority with an application to present a late claim
on November 6, 2023 and then served an amended version on November 21, 2023. Kocaj
Decl., ¶¶ 62-63, Ex. H.
Dawson’s failure to file a timely government claim was due
to mistake, inadvertence, disability, and/or excusable neglect. Kocaj Decl. ¶
60. The adjusters retained by the City led Current Counsel to believe that a
claim had been presented and that liability was being reviewed. Kocaj Decl. ¶

D. Analysis
1. Accrual of the claim
A cause of action accrues at the time a claim is complete
with all of its elements.  Norgart v.
Upjohn, (1999) 21 Cal.4th 383, 397. 
An exception to this usual rule exists where accrual is delayed until
the plaintiff discovers, or has reason to discover, the cause of action.  Id. 
A plaintiff has reason to discover a cause of action when he or she “has
reason to at least suspect factual basis for its elements.”  Id.
On April 5, 2023, Dawson was in the parking lot of the
Pueblo Del Rio Apartments lying underneath his vehicle while he worked to
remove a lift-jack he used while working on his vehicle that day. Mem. at 1.  As he lay on the ground with his legs
protruding from underneath the car, a Housing Authority employee operating a
yellow Ford Ecoline van ran over Dawson’s right leg.  Mem. at 1.
Dawson’s claim accrued on April 5, 2023, when he was injured
when he was run over by the Housing Authority’s vehicle as he was working
underneath his vehicle.  
 
2. Presentation of the claim
Section 911.2 mandates that claims based on causes of action
for death and personal injury must be presented “not later than six months
after the accrual of the cause of action.” 
To be timely, Dawson was required to present his claim to the
Respondents within six months of April 5, 2023, or by October 5, 2023.  §911.2. 

Dawson presented his claim to the Housing Authority on
November 6, 2023 and presented his amended claim on November 21, 2023.  On either date, the claim presentation was
untimely.
 
3. The application to the public entity for leave to
file a late claim was made within a reasonable time not to exceed one year
after accrual of the claim 
Dawson’s claim accrued on April 5, 2023.  He was required to present his application
for leave to file a late claim within a reasonable time and no later than October
5, 2023.  The application to present a
late claim was presented to the Housing Authority on either November 6 or 21,
2023.  The late claim application was
made within a year, and Housing Authority does not contend that the date was unreasonable.
 
4. The application was denied or deemed denied by the
public agency pursuant to section 911.6 
Housing Authority states that the request was deemed denied
by the operation of the law as of December 21, 2023.  Opp. at 2. 

 
5. The petition is timely
The petition for leave to file a late claim must be filed
with the court within six months after the application to the public entity is
denied or deemed to be denied. 
§946.6(b).  The Petition was filed
on January 10, 2024, within six months of Housing Authority’s denial of the leave
to present a late claim. Petition, p. 13.
 
6. The failure to timely present the claim was made through
mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect 
Dawson argues that his failure to comply with the claim
presentation requirement was due to mistake, inadvertence, surprise or
excusable neglect because Current Counsel was “under the impression” that Former
Counsel had presented a claim to the Housing Authority. Kocaj Decl. ¶22.  Dawson further argues that Housing Authority
would not be prejudiced by granting of this Petition. 
The purpose of the Claims Act is to provide the public
entity sufficient information to enable it to adequately investigate claims and
settle them, if appropriate, without the expense of litigation.  City of San Jose v. Superior Court, (“City
of San Jose”) (1974) 12 Cal.3d 447, 455. 
Timely compliance with claim presentation requirements is a mandatory
prerequisite to maintaining a cause of action against a public entity and
failure to file a claim is fatal to the claimant’s cause of action.  Pacific Telegraph & Telephone Co. v.
County of Riverside, (1980) 106 Cal.App.3d 83, 188; San Leandro Police
Officers Assoc. v. City of San Leandro, (1976) 55 Cal.App.3d 553.  Ignorance of the claims filing deadline is no
excuse.  Harrison v. Count of Del
Norte, (1985) 168 Cal.App.3d 1, 7; Drummond v. County of Fresno,
(1987) 193 Cal.App.3d 1406, 1412.  
Mistake, inadvertence, surprise or excusable neglect applies
to the six-month period after the accident and not to the late claim
presentation requirement of a reasonable time not to exceed one year
period.  El Dorado Irrig. Dist. v.
Superior Court, (1979) 98 Cal.App.3d 57, 62.  Excusable neglect is neglect which might have
been the act of a reasonably prudent person under the same or similar
circumstances.  Ebersol v. Cowan,
(1983) 35 Cal.3d 427, 435.  Mere failure
to discover a fact does not constitute excusable neglect for failing to present
a timely claim; the party seeking relief must establish the failure to discover
the fact in the exercise of reasonable diligence.  Munoz v. State of California, (1995)
33 Cal.App.4th 1767, 1783.  Excusable
neglect is defined as an act or omission that might be expected of a prudent
person under similar circumstances.  Department
of Water & Power v. Superior Court, (2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 1288, 1294.  
Once a party retains counsel, that attorney must diligently
investigate facts, identify possible defendants, and timely file the
claim.  Ebersol v. Cowan, supra,
35 Cal.3d at 439.  A mere mistake of
counsel does not provide a basis for granting relief.  Tackett v. City of Huntington Beach,
(1994) 22 Cal. App. 4th 60, 64-65.  A
mere failure to discover a fact does not constitute excusable neglect for
failing to present a timely claim; the party seeking relief must establish the
failure to discover the fact in the exercise of reasonable diligence.  Munoz v. State of California, (1995)
33 Cal.App.4th 1767, 1783.  A mistake or
neglect by an attorney is imputed to the client and may not be offered by the
latter as a basis for relief.  Mitchell
v. Department of Transportation, (1985) 163 Cal.App.3d 1016, 1021.
The period at issue for excusable neglect is the six-month
period from Dawson’s accident on April 5 to October 5, 2023.  
Dawson provides evidence about Former Counsel’s
communications from April 5 until Current Counsel was retained on July 5,
2023.  Most important, on June 14, 2023,
Koning & Associates informed Former Counsel that it had been retained to
assist in gathering facts about the incident and that Housing Authority Risk
Retention Group, the liability insurer for Housing Authority, would make all
decisions on liability and damages. 
Kocaj Decl. ¶20, Ex. C.  Thus,
Former Counsel – and Current Counsel when it retained the file – knew that it
was communicating with Risk Retention Group, the liability insurer for Housing
Authority, and with Risk Retention Group’s claims adjuster, Koning &
Associates.  Neither of these entities is
Housing Authority.[2]  Former Counsel never contacted or communicated
with Housing Authority.  Former Counsel
failed to make a claim with Housing Authority and did not act diligently in the
three months it represented Dawson.
Current Counsel merely states that it was “under the
impression” that Former Counsel had submitted a claim. Kocaj Decl., ¶22.  This also is not reasonable diligence.  A reasonable attorney would have inquired of
both Former Counsel and Housing Authority whether a claim had been made.  Current Counsel obviously knew that a claim
against Housing Authority was required.  It
cannot rely on communications with a third-party insurer, including the claim
number it created, or that third party’s claims adjuster.  This is not excusable neglect.
Although Dawson sought counsel immediately after his
accident, his counsel did not act diligently to file a claim.  This failure is imputed to Dawson and is not
excusable neglect. 
 
7. Substantial compliance with the claim presentation
requirement 
            In
the alternative, Dawson argues that he substantially complied with the Claims Act’s
claim requirements because Former Counsel contacted the agents for the Housing
Authority’s insurer on April 12, 2023, within a week of the cause of action.  Mem. at 13.  He repeatedly argues that Housing Authority
had actual knowledge of the circumstances surrounding the claim, Dawson’s name
and address, the address of Former and Current Counsel, a detailed description
of the injury and damages, the name of the Housing Authority employee causing
the injuries, and that Dawson’s damages exceeded $10,000.  Reply at 3.  This knowledge occurred through Konig &
Associates, which clearly held itself out as Housing Authority’s agent.  Reply at 8.
Dawson relies on Ebersol v. Cowan, (1983) 35 Cal.3d
427, but that reliance is misguided because Ebersol found mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect, which is not true in this case.  See id. at 439-40.  Dawson’s contact with a third-party insurer (Housing
Authority Risk Retention Group) and that insurer’s claims adjuster (Konig &
Associates)[3] does not
qualify as presentation of a claim to Housing Authority or even show Housing
Authority’s actual knowledge of the claim. 
The mere fact that Former Counsel was notified that Housing Authority
Risk Retention Group would make all decisions regarding liability, coverage,
and damages does not satisfy the Claims Act. 
Reply at 8, Ex. A.   “It is well-settled that claims statutes
must be satisfied even in face of the public entity's actual knowledge of the
circumstances surrounding the claim.  Such
knowledge — standing alone — constitutes neither substantial compliance nor
basis for estoppel.”  City of San Jose, supra, 12 Cal.3d at
465.
The petition for leave to file a late claim is denied.
