 Case Number:  23STCP01055    Hearing Date:   April 11, 2024    Dept:  85 
 
Mick Mars v. Motley Crüe Touring Inc. et al., 23STCP01055

Tentative decision on motion for attorney’s fees: granted
in part 



 
 
Petitioner Mick Mars (“Mars”) moves for an award of
attorney’s fees against Respondents Red, White & Crue, Inc. (“RWC”), Cruefest
limited liability company (“LLC”) (“Cruefest”), Mötley Records, LLC
(“Records”), and Masters 2008, LLC (“Masters 2008”). 
The court has read and considered the moving papers, opposition,
and reply, and renders the following tentative decision. 
 
A. Statement of
the Case
            1.
Petition
            On
April 4, 2023, Petitioner Mars filed the Petition against Cruefest, Records, Masters
2008 (collectively “Respondent LLCs”), RWC, Mötley Crüe Touring, Inc. (“MCT”), Mötley
Crüe, Inc. (“MCI”), and Masters 2000, Inc. (“Masters 2000”).  Mars alleged a cause of action for
traditional mandamus under Corporations Code[1]
sections 1603(a) and 17704.10(f).  The
verified Petition alleges in pertinent part as follows.
            Mars
was a founding member, lead guitar player, and backing vocalist for the band
Mötley Crüe.  Pet. at ¶¶ 1, 23-26.  He is a 25% member of each of the Respondent entities,
through which the Mötley Crüe does business. 
Pet. at ¶¶ 5, 9, 14-16.
Nikki Sixx (“Sixx”) is the only Mötley Crüe member besides
Mars who has been a member throughout the band’s existence.  Pet. at ¶25. 
Sixx often made band decisions without consent or knowledge of the other
members.  Pet. at ¶33.  He would send documents with instructions to
“sign immediately” and the false assertion that the other band members had
already signed their copies.  Pet. at
¶34.  
 
            a.
Mars’ Final Tour
             Throughout his professional career, Mars has suffered
from Ankylosing Spondylitis (“AS”), which debilitated his body over time.  Pet. at ¶¶ 35-37.  Sixx “gaslighted” Mars by saying that he had
some cognitive dysfunction, his guitar playing was subpar, and he was
forgetting chords and playing the wrong songs. 
Pet. at ¶38.
            In
2022, Mötley Crüe signed an agreement to do a U.S. stadium tour (“Stadium
Tour”), followed by a world tour with other artists (“World Tour”).  Pet. at ¶39. 
Mars advised management that, because of complications from his AS and
the rigors of the road, the Stadium Tour would be his last tour.  Pet. at ¶40. 
He would not retire from the Mötley Crüe and would remain available for
recording and other band activities. 
Pet. at ¶40.  Management replied
that it understood and that fans would be informed with dignity.  Pet. at ¶41.
            The
Stadium Tour lasted through September 9, 2022, and included triple the planned
number of stadiums.  Pet. at ¶¶ 42,
48.  During this tour, Sixx gaslighted
Mars more than ever.  Pet. at ¶43.  He repeatedly told Mars that he was playing
the wrong chords and that fans were complaining about his playing.  Pet. at ¶43. 
Mars did play the wrong chords, but only because his in-ear monitors
malfunctioned and kept him from hearing his chords.  Pet. at ¶46. 
Sixx’s comments suggest that he plotted to force Mars out of Mötley Crüe
and take his shares in the relevant Respondent entities.  Pet. at ¶43.
            Sixx
did not play a single note on his bass during the tour.  Pet. at ¶44. 
He fist-pumped with his strumming hand the entire time, with recordings replacing
his live playing.  Pet. at ¶44.  Significant portions of the other two band
members’ parts also were pre-recorded, and some fans noticed that Tommy Lee’s
(“Lee”) drum part began while he was still walking to the drum set.  Pet. at ¶45. 
Mars received the least online criticism of all the band members for their
performances.  Pet. at ¶47.
 
            b.
Post-Stadium Tour MCI Meeting
            On
October 14, 2022, between the Stadium Tour and the World Tour, Mars’ attorney
received a draft Separation and Release Agreement from an attorney who
purported to represent RWC and MCI.  Pet.
at ¶49.  The proposal acknowledged that
Mars is an officer, director, and shareholder of the Respondent entities.  Pet. at ¶49. 
It erroneously stated that Mars no longer desires to perform in Mötley
Crüe and that he was resigning as an officer and director of all Respondent entities.  Pet. at ¶49. 

            The
separation proposal stated that Mars’ share of touring profits would decrease
from 25% to 5% for the rest of the current tour and to 0% for any future
tours.  Pet. at ¶50.  His share of merchandise profits would
decrease from 25% to 5% for any merchandise with the Mötley Crüe’s name or
related logos and to 0% for any merchandise that featured the guitar player the
Mötley Crüe hired to replace Mars on tour, John 5.  Pet. at ¶51. 
In exchange, Mars would transfer to MCI all right, title, and interest
in Mötley Crüe assets.  Pet. at ¶52.  Mötley Crüe could continue to use his name
and likeness.  Pet. at ¶53.  Mars would also release Mötley Crüe from any
liability.  Pet. at ¶54.  
            Mars
did not sign this one-sided separation proposal.  On October 25, 2022, he received notice that
Sixx had scheduled a Zoom meeting of MCI shareholders for November 4,
2022.  Pet. at ¶55.  The stated purpose of the meeting was to
accept Mars’ resignation and terminate him as officer and director of MCI.  Pet. at ¶56.
            On
October 26, 2022, Mars issued a press release announcing that he was no longer
touring with the band because of his AS but was otherwise still a band member.  Pet. at ¶57. 
Within 24 hours, the rest of Mötley Crüe released a statement that Mars
was retiring from the band and that he was being replaced by John 5.  Pet. at ¶58. 

            On
November 2, 2022, Mars wrote to MCI that he was not quitting Mötley Crüe or
resigning as an officer or director of the Respondent entities.  Pet. at ¶59. 
He could not join Mötley Crüe on tours but otherwise remained a
member.  Pet. at ¶60.  He also asked for permission to have his
manager and counsel attend.  Pet. at
¶61.  
            The
next day, MCI’s counsel responded that the separation proposal’s 5% offer was
generous, given that the last band member who retired received nothing.  Pet. at ¶62. 
MCI’s counsel added that, if Mars refused this offer, the other MCI
members would force him to sell them his MCI shares at book value with no value
assigned to the Mötley Crüe name.  Pet.
at ¶62.  This effectively meant that Mars
would receive nothing.  Pet. at ¶63.  MCI’s counsel also declared that the November
4, 2022 meeting would not be recorded, Mars’ manager could not attend, and
Mars’ counsel could only attend as an observer. 
Pet. at ¶69.  
            At
the November 4, 2022 meeting, Sixx made clear that he believed the separation proposal
was generous and that Mötley Crüe would never agree to give Mars a share of the
World Tour profits.  Pet. at ¶¶
74-75.  Sixx further severely criticized Mars’
performances during the Stadium Tour. 
Pet. at ¶76.  The other Mötley
Crüe members voted to rescind the separation proposal, oust Mars, and buy his
shares for book value, which they asserted was worth close to nothing.  Pet. at ¶78. 
They agreed to postpone the decision for two weeks pending further discussion
between the parties.  Pet. at ¶78.
 
            c.
Revised Settlement Offers
            MCI
provided a redlined draft agreement that raised Mars’ share of profits from 5%
to 7.5% for the World Tour.  Pet. at
¶80.  Changes to other provisions in the
draft agreement made it difficult to ascertain if this change would increase
Mars’ revenue.  Pet. at ¶80.  The revised proposal also required Mars to
divest his interest in MCI, RWC, and five other entities, some of which Mars
did not recognize.  Pet. at ¶81.  Mars felt that he needed to have a corporate
attorney review all the corporate documents associated with those companies and
requested time to do so on January 13, 2023. 
Pet. at ¶¶ 82, 84.  Mötley Crüe’s
counsel responded that, if Mars did not finalize the revised proposal by
January 20, 2023, Mötley Crüe would proceed with Mars’ termination.  Pet. at ¶85. 

            On
January 20, 2023, Mars offered to resolve the matter if Mötley Crüe agreed to
his original proposal under which he would receive 15% of the Mötley Crüe’s
profits and a percentage of touring profits beyond the World Tour.  Pet. at ¶88.
 
            d.
Request for Documents
            As
of February 7, 2023, MCI had not responded to Mars’ offer.  Pet. at ¶¶ 88-89.  The next day, Mars sent separate requests to
each Respondent for specific Respondent corporate and LLC documents (“Requests”).  Pet. at ¶¶ 89, 100.
            Seven
days later, Mötley Crüe’s attorney sent a Demand for Arbitration.  Pet. at ¶90. 
Mötley Crüe essentially is suing Mars to establish that he is no longer
an MCI officer, director, or shareholder. 
Pet. at ¶90.  To date, Respondents
have not responded to Mars’ demand for documents.  Pet. at ¶101.
 
            e.
Prayer for Relief
            Mars
seeks a writ of mandate directing Respondents to allow him to inspect and make
copies of all their business records from inception to present day, or for an order
to show cause as to why a writ of mandate to that effect should not issue.  Pet. Prayer for Relief at ¶1.  Mars also seeks attorney’s fees and costs.  Pet. Prayer for Relief at ¶¶ 2-3.
 
            2. Course of Proceedings
            On April 20, 2023, Mars
served Respondents MCI, RWC, Masters 2000, Masters 2008, Records, and Cruefest
with the Petition.
            On April 24, 2023, Mars
served MCT with the Petition.
            On September 7, 2023,
the court granted in part Respondents’ motion to strike.  The court also granted a motion to compel
arbitration as to MCT, MCI, and Masters 2000, but denied the motion as to RWC,
Cruefest, Records, and Masters 2008.
            On September 19, 2023,
RWC, Cruefest, Masters 2008, and Records filed an Answer.
            On November 17, 2023,
pursuant to Mars’ request, the court dismissed the action as to MCT, MCI, and
Masters 2000.
On January 16, 2024, the court denied
the Petition as mooted, but ruled that Mars is entitled to attorney’s fees
through a noticed motion.
On March 14, 2024, Mars filed the instant
motion for attorney’s fees. 
On March 28, 2024, Respondents filed their opposition.

 
B. Applicable Law
A court may award reasonable expenses including attorneys’
fees against a corporation where a shareholder must resort to court action as a
result of a corporation’s unjustified failure to comply with a proper
demand.  §1604.
In any action under this section or under section 17713.07, if
the court finds that the company failed to comply with section 17704.10 without
justification, it “may award an amount sufficient to reimburse the person
bringing the action for the reasonable expenses incurred by that person,
including attorney’s fees, in connection with the action or proceeding.”  §17704.10(g).
The use of “may” (as opposed
to “shall”) signifies that reimbursement is permissive in nature.  See
People v. McGee, (1977) 19 Cal.3d 948, 959
(discussing mandatory-permissive dichotomy); cf. Valtz v. Penta
Invest. Corp.,
(1983) 139 Cal.App.3d 803, 807, 810 (trial court abused its discretion in
denying mandamus relief and attorney fee request under section 1604 based on
constitutional grounds).  Accordingly, a
party’s right to and extent of reimbursement under section 17704.10(g) remains
discretionary with the court.
 
C. Statement of
Facts
1. Petitioner’s
Evidence
Petitioner Mars is entitled to attorney fees following the
court’s January 16, 2024 judgment.   McPherson Decl., ¶1, Ex. 1.
This matter began in March 2023.  McPherson Decl., ¶19.  Mars’ counsel generally staffed this matter
with one managing partner, Edwin F. McPherson Esq. (“McPherson”), two other partners,
Pierre B. Pine, Esq. (“Pine”) and Stuart N. Chelin, Esq. (“Chelin”), two
contract lawyers, Maureen Lee Baker, Esq. (“Baker”) and Aleksandra Hilvert,
Esq. (“Hilvert”) and a paralegal, Raffaella Cesana (“Cesana”).  McPherson Decl. ¶¶ 3,6,16-18.
McPherson’s billing rate in this matter through January 2024
was $750 per hour. McPherson’s billing rate commencing February, 2024 was
$795.00 per hour. McPherson Decl., ¶13.  McPherson
billed a total of 218.2 hours on this matter through February 2024, for total
fees of $164,163.00.  McPherson Decl.,
¶13.
Pine’s hourly rate through January 2024 was $575 per hour.  McPherson Decl., ¶14.  Commencing in February 2024, Pine’s hourly
rate was $650 per hour.  McPherson Decl.,
¶14.   Pine billed a total of 70.5 hours on this
matter through February, 2024, for total fees of $40,612.50. McPherson Decl.,
¶14.  
Chelin’s hourly rate throughout this matter was $550 per
hour. McPherson Decl., ¶15. Chelin billed a total of 91.90 hours on this
matter, for total fees of $50,545.00. Id. 
Baker’s hourly rate throughout this matter was $525 per
hour. McPherson Decl., ¶16. Baker billed a total of 34.1 hours on this matter,
for total fees of $17,902.50. Id. 
Hilvert’s hourly rate throughout this matter was $475 per
hour. McPherson Decl., ¶17. Hilvert billed a total of 17.6 hours on this
matter, for total fees of $8,360.00. Id. 
Cesana’s hourly rate throughout this matter was $200.00 per
hour. McPherson Decl., ¶18. Cesana billed a total of 13.20 hours on this
matter, for total fees of $2,640.00. Id. 
Mars has incurred approximately $2,178.80 in costs.  McPherson Decl., ¶20.
Mars provided a declaration with a monthly summary of the
tasks and the attorney hours incurred by each attorney who worked on the case
that month. McPherson Decl., ¶19 (1)-(19).
Mars seeks $282,158.00 in attorney’s fees plus $2,178,80 in
costs. Mars’ counsel asserts that “based on my experience and personal
knowledge, the hourly rates that were charged by each of us . . . are
reasonable and equivalent to, or less than, those charged by other Los Angeles
attorneys and law firms of comparable reputation and experience to handle
similar cases.” McPherson Decl., ¶5. 
 
b. Respondents’ Evidence
On January 18, 2024, Respondents’ counsel received an email
from McPherson stating that Mars incurred $294,555 in attorney fees on this
case through December 2023.  Frid Decl.,
¶8. Respondents’ counsel asked for the invoices supporting this large
request.  Id.  McPherson refused to submit invoices
supporting the attorney’s fee request, claiming they were privileged.  Id.  
Respondents’ counsel stressed that they could not evaluate the fee
request unless they knew the details of the work performed.  Id. 
On January 24, 2024, McPherson sent an email with a “high-level summary”
of the hours worked; no actual details were provided.  Id.
 
c. Reply Evidence
McPherson LLP has separate files (and bills) for the
arbitration and for this case.  McPherson
Reply Decl., ¶3.  Any work that could be
considered to overlap both cases was excluded from the instant motion,
including $25,200 in fees that the firm billed in this case.  Id. 
Mars also is not seeking $37,875 that a corporate law firm, Fiszer Law,
APC, billed to analyze Mars’ rights in connection with this case and the
arbitration.  Id.
Mars prepared a Request for Production of Documents in May
2023, which was reasonable in the face of Respondents’ refusal to produce
statutorily-mandated documents.  McPherson
Reply Decl., ¶4.  However, Respondents
served their motion to compel arbitration and to stay this proceeding, which
was not decided until September 7, 2023. 
Id.  Once Respondents began
rolling out production in the thousands of pages, discovery became
unnecessary.  Id.
McPherson LLP’s billing system has a macro, RA, which
automatically populates with the words “review and analyze”.  McPherson Reply Decl., ¶5.  The term is used without any distinction
between “review” and “analyze”, both on the invoices and in the McPherson
declaration.  Id.
 
D. Analysis
Mars seeks an award of attorney’s fees against Respondents
in the amount of $282,158.00 as well as costs in the amount of $2,178.80.  
 
1. Entitlement to
Fees
Petitioner Mars asserts that he is entitled to an award of
attorney’s fees under Corp. Code section 1604 because Respondents acted without
substantial justification in their failure to produce documents without
justification.
On January 16, 2024, the court
determined that, although the Writ of Mandate Petition was moot because all of
the originally requested documents had been produced, Mars is still entitled to
recover attorneys’ fees and costs because Respondents “acted without
substantial justification.” McPherson Decl. ¶ 1, Exhibit 1. 
Mars is entitled to reasonable attorneys’ fees against Respondents
under Corporations Code sections 1604 and 17704.10(g).
 
2. Reasonable Fees
Section 17704.10(g) does not provide for a statutory award
of all actual attorney’s fees incurred by a prevailing petitioner in a member
inspection action.  Rather, the court may award reasonable attorney’s
fees that are sufficient to
reimburse the petitioner for the fees incurred in connection with the action or proceeding,
and only if the court finds that the company failed to comply with section
17704.10 without justification.  Similarly, section 1604 permits a court to
award reasonable expenses including attorneys’ fees against a
corporation where a shareholder must resort to court action as a result of a
corporation’s unjustified failure to comply with a proper demand.  
The moving party bears the burden
of proof as to the reasonableness of any fee claim.  CCP §1033.5(c)(5).  This burden requires competent evidence as to
the nature and value of the services rendered. 
Martino v. Denevi, (1986) 182 Cal.App.3d 553, 559.  
“‘The reasonable market value of
the attorney’s services is the measure of a reasonable hourly rate.  This standard applies regardless of whether
the attorneys claiming fees charge nothing for their services, charge at
below-market or discounted rates, represent the client on a straight contingent
fee basis, or are in-house counsel.’”  Center
For Biological Diversity v. County of San Bernardino, (2010) 188
Cal.App.4th 603, 619 (citations omitted).
A plaintiff’s verified billing
invoices are prima facie evidence that the costs, expenses, and services
listed were necessarily incurred.  See
Hadley v. Krepel, (1985) 167 Cal.App.3d 677, 682.  “Testimony of an attorney as to the number of
hours worked on a particular case is sufficient evidence to support an award of
attorney fees, even in the absence of detailed time records.” Id.  
“In challenging attorney fees as
excessive because too many hours of work are claimed, it is the burden of the
challenging party to point to the specific items challenged, with a sufficient
argument and citations to the evidence. 
General arguments that fees claimed are excessive, duplicative, or
unrelated do not suffice.”  Lunada
Biomedical v. Nunez, (2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 459, 488.
In determining whether the
requested attorney’s fees are reasonable, the court’s “first step involves the
lodestar figure—a calculation based on the number of hours reasonably expended
multiplied by the lawyer’s hourly rate. 
The lodestar figure may then be adjusted, based on consideration of
facts specific to the case, in order to fix the fee at the fair market value
for the legal services provided.”  Gorman
v. Tassajara Development Corp., (2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 770, 774.  In adjusting the lodestar figure, the court
may consider the nature and difficulty of the litigation, the amount of money
involved, the skill required and employed to handle the case, the attention
given, the success or failure, and other circumstances in the case. EnPalm
LLC v. Teitler, (2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 770, 774; see also PLCM
Group, Inc. v. Drexler, (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095.
 
a. Rates
McPherson’s billing rate through January 2024 was $750 per
hour. McPherson’s billing rate commencing February, 2024 was $795 per hour.
McPherson Decl., ¶13.  
Pine’s hourly rate through January 2024 was $575 per
hour.  McPherson Decl., ¶14.  Commencing in February 2024, Pine’s hourly
rate was $650 per hour.  McPherson Decl.,
¶14.   
Chelin’s hourly rate was $550 per hour. McPherson Decl.,
¶15. 
Baker’s hourly rate throughout this matter was $525 per
hour. McPherson Decl., ¶16. 
Hilvert’s hourly rate throughout this matter was $475 per
hour. McPherson Decl., ¶17. 
Cesana’s hourly rate throughout this matter was $200.00 per
hour. McPherson Decl., ¶18. 
Respondents do not directly challenge the hourly rates of
Mars’ counsel, only arguing that the court could apply a lower rate for a
simple documents case.  Opp. at 11, n.
6.  This case involved more than the simple
production of documents and the court finds the rates to be reasonable.
 
b. Hours
Mars seeks to recover fees for 445.5 hours expended on this
case.  Mot. at 15.  
McPherson billed a total of 218.2 hours, for total fees of
$164,163.00.  McPherson Decl., ¶13. 
Pine billed a total of 70.5 hours, for total fees of
$40,612.50. McPherson Decl., ¶14.  
Chelin billed a total of 91.90 hours, for total fees of
$50,545.00. Id.  
Baker billed a total of 34.1 hours, for total fees of
$17,902.50. Id. 
Hilvert billed a total of 17.6 hours, for total fees of
$8,360.00. Id. 
Cesana billed a total of 13.20 hours, for total fees of
$2,640.00. Id. 
 
The lodestar is $282,158. 
Mars contends this work was reasonable based on the following facts.  On February 8, 2023, Mars’ counsel sent a
letter requesting basic financial, organizational, and internal governance
information about all of the Respondents corporate and LLC entities.  Respondents produced approximately 237 pages in
response to the request, but failed to respond to the vast majority of requests
and did not produce any accounting records or statements. Mot. at 8.  
Mars filed the Petition on April 6, 2023.  After this date, and almost three months after
the original requests, Respondents produced an additional 2,223 pages of
documents that clearly existed at the time that the requests were made.  The production included a superseded Live
Nation touring agreement from 2019, an MCI shareholder agreement from January
25, 2023 terminating Mars as an officer and director, and some accounting
records such as Statements of Assets and Liabilities, Ledger Reports,
Statements of Income and Expense, and tax returns for each of the Respondent
entities from 2020 and 2021, and a draft of each such document for 2022.  Almost every accounting record produced
indicated that it had been accessed on February 23, 2023 by a sophisticated
wealth management company.  Mot. at 9.
The accounting company offered no explanation why it did not produce these
records until after Mars filed his Petition.  Mot. at 8-9. 

On June 9, 2023, Respondents made a further production
of 673 pages of documents dated from July 2019 to June 2020, as well as
transactional documents related to the purchase of the Band’s master recordings
by BMG Rights Management (U.S.) LLC pursuant to a 2021 agreement. Mot. at
9.  Respondents did not explain why these
documents were withheld until more than two months after the Petition was
filed.  Id. 
On November 2, 2023, Respondents produced another
5,565 pages of documents. Id. Only 476 of these pages were responsive,
and most were readily available when Mars served his Requests. Id.  
On November 6, 2023, Respondents asserted that their
productions consisted of all documents in their possession, custody, and
control that were responsive to Mars’s Requests. Id. 
Mars’ opening trial brief included a chart of basic
documents that Respondents had yet to produce. 
Respondents produced on December 8, 2023 their 2022 federal and state
returns, articles of incorporation or organization for each entity, a list of
Records’ members, and Statements of Information listing Cruefest’s and Masters
2008’s members. Id. 
Respondents challenge the reasonableness of the fees charged
by Mars’ counsel. Respondents argue that the court should deny the fee motion
because Mars refused to submit his billing invoices.  Inadequate documentation can result in denial
of a fee award altogether.  Serrano v.
Unruh, (1982) 32 Cal.3d 621, 635, n. 21. 
While McPherson states that he would be happy to provide the court with
the invoices in camera, this would be improper.  See Cocepcion v. Amscan Holdings,
Inc., (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 1309, 1325. 
While courts have permitted counsel to describe their time in a
declaration, this is generally done in contingency cases in which the
plaintiff’s attorney has not kept time records. 
Even there, the court has wide discretion to reduce based on its
estimate of the amount of time spent on non-compensable activities.  See Chavez v. Netlfix, Inc.,
(2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 43, 64.  Mot. at 9-11.
 
The court disagrees that billing invoices are required. A plaintiff’s verified billing invoices are prima facie
evidence that the costs, expenses, and services listed were necessarily
incurred.  See Hadley v. Krepel,
supra, 167 Cal.App.3d at 682.  But
invoices are not required.  See Reply
at 7.  A detailed attorney declaration
stating the hours incurred on specific facts by various attorneys will
suffice.  It is Respondents job to
challenge the attorney fees as excessive by pointing to the specific items
challenged, with a sufficient argument and citations to the evidence.  Lunada Biomedical v. Nunez, supra,
230 Cal.App.4th at 488.
Alternatively, Respondents argue that the lodestar should be
reduced by 90% because Mars seeks unreasonable fees.  Opp. at 13. 
They note that there was no trial, and only two motions and a single
round of substantive briefing.  Opp. at
5.  Instead of providing the monthly
invoices, Mars’ counsel went to the expense of preparing time-consuming
high-level monthly summaries.  These
summaries prevent the court from evaluating reasonableness because they do not
describe which attorney performed a task, how long that attorney worked on it,
or whether the task was for the arbitration. 
Opp. at 11-13.
Respondents also argue that Mars pads the request with time
spent on the arbitration.  Mars also seeks
recovery of an unspecified time in May 2023 for preparation of Requests for
Production when discovery is not permitted in mandamus and none was ever
served.   Mars further seeks time for the
“review and analysis of documents but this proceeding is only about production
of records, not their analysis.  There
should be no award of fees for time spent on tasks before the proceeding began,
and no award for collateral tasks such as correspondence, analyzing documents,
coordinating with former attorneys, and conferences.  Finally, Mars made no effort to reduce fees
for time related to the parties ordered to arbitration: MCI, MCT, and
Masters.  Opp. at 5-6, 8-9.
Mars replies that the McPherson declaration presents the
work done on a month-by-month basis, with a detailed list of relevant tasks and
a list of who performed the work.  Reply
at 5.  Mars’ reason for not providing the
invoices relates to the ongoing nature of the arbitration proceeding and is not
an effort to hide details.  Reply at 8-9.
As for the individual criticisms, Mars points out that he
eliminated work on the arbitration from the amount sought.  Reply at 9. 
There is no authority for Respondents’ argument that attorney fees in a
shareholder or member inspection case do not include time spent in preparing
the lawsuit.  Reply at 7.  As for Respondents’ absurd objection to the
use of “review and analyze”, McPherson LLP’s billing system automatically
populates its billing with “review and analyze” when the macro “RA” is used by
a timekeeper and McPherson used this language in his declaration as well.  Moreover, it was appropriate for an attorney
to read the items produced to determine if they were what was requested and
what documents were missing.  Reply at 10-11.  The partial grant of the motion to compel
arbitration should not result in a reduction because Mars was permitted to
proceed against four of the seven Respondents. 
Similarly, the partial granting of the motion to strike, Mars maintained
much of the subject paragraphs except for a few derogatory paragraphs
containing public information.  Reply at

declaration contains block billing and argues that, while not preferred, block
billing does not preclude an award of attorney’s fees.  See Lunada Biomedical v.Nunez,
(2014) 240 Cal.App.4th 459, 487.  Reply

The 445.5 hours expended on this case are unreasonable for a
combination of reasons.  First, while the
court has approved the attorney rates, the use of five attorneys -- a managing
partner, two other partners, and two contract lawyers -- and a paralegal is
excessive.  McPherson Decl. ¶¶ 3,6,16-18.  This shareholder/member inspection case could
easily have been staffed by a partner and an associate.  This is true even though there was a motion
to compel arbitration and a motion to strike.
Second, while Mars was entitled to present the hours worked
in an attorney declaration, the McPherson declaration is inadequate.  His summaries prevent Respondents from
challenging reasonableness because they do not describe which attorney
performed a task or how long that attorney worked on it.  For example, it would make a difference
whether McPherson or a contract attorney performed research or wrote a
brief.  It also would make a difference
if an attorney spent three hours writing a letter to “corporate counsel”, and
at what rate.  McPherson Decl., ¶19, 4i. This
failure is aggravated by the McPherson declaration’s block billing.  Mars is correct that block billing is not
necessarily preclusive, but block entries – e.g., McPherson Decl., ¶19,
5i -- prevented Respondents from challenging the individual components.  
Third, Mars is incorrect that he properly could prepare the discovery
that was never served.  It appears that
his Request for Production of Documents was intended to obtain discovery of the
very documents at issue in the proceeding. 
This is improper bootstrapping.  Discovery
requests seeking the very documents at issue in the mandamus case are not
reasonably likely to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence on why the
respondent should be ordered to produce those documents at trial.
Fourth, Respondents are correct that the McPherson
declaration contains numerous entries for correspondence with corporate
counsel, correspondence and meetings with Mars, correspondence with, and review
documents from, business managers, and coordination with former Mars attorneys.  While some of these entries may be
compensable, they are excessive, and it is impossible to know how much attorney
time was expended and at what rate.[2]
While shareholder/member inspection cases generally are
straightforward, the arbitration motion was reasonably complex.  Therefore, Mars’ counsel can reasonably have
been expected to expend significant time on that issue.  Still, the 445.5 hours actually expended are
not reasonable.  For the reasons stated,
the hours are reduced to 200 hours. 
Using a blended partner rate of $658.33, the lodestar is reduced to $131,666.
 
3. Costs
A prevailing party who claims costs must serve and file a
memorandum of costs within 15 days after the date of service of the notice of
entry of judgment or dismissal by the clerk under Code of Civil Procedure
section 664.5 or the date of service of written notice of entry of judgment or
dismissal, or within 180 days after entry of judgment, whichever is first.  CRC 3.1700(a).  In a special proceeding, the 15-day deadline
to file a memorandum of costs begins with the notice of entry of order as that
is appealable.  See Los Angeles
Corridor Transportation Authority, (2001) 88 Cal.App.4th 1381,
1388 (timing for appeal may be from date of “notice of entry” of denial of CPRA
attorney’s fees). 
Mars must file a memorandum of costs and may not seek them
by motion. 
 
E. Conclusion
Mars’ motion for attorney’s fees is granted in part in the
amount of $131,666.  Mars’ request for $2,178,80
in costs is denied in favor of a memorandum of costs.
