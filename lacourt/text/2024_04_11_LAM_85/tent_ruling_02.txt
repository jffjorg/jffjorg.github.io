[1] Real Party Department
requests the court to judicially notice the unpublished appellate decision in Flores
v. County of Los Angeles, Case No. B287382, December 13, 2019.  The request is granted.  Evid. Code §452(d).


[2]
Flores contends that White was disciplined as a result of the May 30, 2014
incident, but he cites to the appellate decision in Flores v. County of Los
Angeles.  The facts set forth in an
appellate decision are not admissible as evidence.  See Sosinsky
v. Grant, (1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 1548, 1551.


[3]
The Hearing Officer also set forth Joy’s position.  AR 124-26. 
The court has not included it because the Hearing Officer did not adopt
it.


[4] Apparently, SDPO
Randall provided a sworn statement that Joy admitted having a sexual
relationship with Flores.  This statement
was not cited by either party and is not in the Joint Appendix.  
 


[5] For
convenience, the court will refer to the Hearing Officer’s proposed decision that
was adopted by the Commission as the “decision”.


[6] Joy
makes no argument that the transcripts from the Flores lawsuit depositions and
trial were inadmissible at his administrative hearing.


[7] When questioned about his timeline because he appeared to be a year off,
Arana stated he was sure Flores moved out in 2013 and they divorced in
2014.  AR 1231.  Based on the other evidence, Arana clearly
was wrong.  The year of described events
was 2014.
