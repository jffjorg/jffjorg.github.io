And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the application for a writ of attachment in the case of Eighteentwentysix, LLC v. MHL Touring, Inc. The plaintiff, Eighteentwentysix, LLC, is seeking a writ of attachment to secure payment of $59,175.89 in unpaid invoices for production and stage management services provided to the defendant, MHL Touring, Inc. The defendant has failed to make the agreed-upon payments despite receiving the services.

The judge finds that the claim is one upon which an attachment may be issued, as it is for a fixed amount greater than $500. The judge also finds that the plaintiff has established the probable validity of the claim, as the evidence submitted shows that the defendant contracted for the services and failed to make the payments.

The judge grants the application for a right to attach order and issues a writ of attachment in the sum of $59,175.89. The writ will not include attorney's fees or costs, as the master agreement does not appear to include an attorney's fees provision. The writ will issue upon the posting of a bond in the amount of $10,000.

The judge notes that the issue of attorney's fees and costs will be discussed at the hearing, and that the court is not inclined to find that the plaintiff has established the probable validity of its claim for such fees and costs.
