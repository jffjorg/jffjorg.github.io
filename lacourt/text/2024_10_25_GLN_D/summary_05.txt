And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Dai, et al. v. Vasquez, et al., in which the defendants have filed a demurrer to the complaint alleging unlawful detainer. The demurrer argues that the three-day notice alleged in the complaint overstates the amount of rent due, and therefore is fatally defective and will not support an unlawful detainer action. The judge has ruled that the demurrer is overruled, as the complaint includes all the required information for an unlawful detainer action and specifically alleges the amount of rent due. The judge has also denied the opposition's request for fees and costs incurred in opposing the demurrer, as there is no legal authority cited under which such relief may be granted. The parties have five days to answer, and the court is continuing to conduct and encourage audio or video appearances.
