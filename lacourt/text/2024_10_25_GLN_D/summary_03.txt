And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's unopposed motion to compel responses from the plaintiff to form interrogatories and requests for production of documents. The plaintiff failed to serve timely responses to these discovery requests. The court has ordered the plaintiff to serve verified responses to the interrogatories and requests for production of documents without objection, within 10 days.

The court has also awarded sanctions against the plaintiff in the amount of $637.50 for each motion, totaling $1,275. This amount is reasonable and is to be awarded in favor of the defendant and against the plaintiff, payable within 30 days.

The court has continued the hearing and will consider the motions on their merits. The parties are required to prepare an order for sanctions and submit it to the court by noon today.
