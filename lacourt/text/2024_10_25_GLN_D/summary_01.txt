  - The complaint alleges that on August 5, 2021, defendant served a 60-Day Notice to Quit on plaintiffs, which did not specify any cause for termination, including the statutorily required just cause pursuant to Civil Code section 1946.2 or Glendale Municipal Ordinance section 9.30.031.
  - The complaint alleges that on January 14, 2022, plaintiffs notified defendant that plaintiffs were exercising their option to purchase the subject property, but defendant has refused to enter escrow and honor the agreement between the parties, and is attempting to sell the subject property to another for a higher price.

  - The SACC alleges that the parties never reached an agreement regarding the purchase of the house.
  - In August of 2021, cross-complainant filed an unlawful detainer lawsuit against cross-defendants.

  - The demurrer was sustained with ten days leave to amend.
