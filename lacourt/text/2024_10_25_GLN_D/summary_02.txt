Here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Wright v. Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC, regarding four motions to compel responses to discovery. The motions were filed by the plaintiffs, David K. Wright and Kimberly Wright, against the defendant, Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC.

The court notes that the parties are unaware that this matter is subject to the Addendum to Case Management Conference Order (Song-Beverly Litigation) (Order), which was signed and entered by the court on January 24, 2023, as revised, signed, and entered on January 11, 2024.

The Order provides that any formal discovery propounded and currently pending or outstanding by a party in this matter prior to the date of this CMC Order is stayed pending further order of the Court. The Order also sets forth provisions concerning discovery in Song-Beverly matters, including the propounding of one set of Judicial Council Form Interrogatories and one set of maximum of 35 special interrogatories.

The court will deny the motions to compel responses without prejudice until the parties have had the opportunity to comply with the Order. The parties are ordered to engage in good faith meet and confer concerning outstanding discovery.

The court also notes that the Order does not provide for the propounding of Requests for Admissions, and that the moving papers do not submit a written stipulation or court order permitting such discovery.

If a party believes any of the information requested in discovery should be subject to a protective order, that party shall serve and file a proposed protective order within 5 days of this Order and the parties shall meet and confer as to agreeable language for the same.

The court will continue to conduct and encourage audio or video appearances, and parties are encouraged to make arrangements in advance if they wish to appear via LACourtConnect.
