TENTATIVE RULING
 
Plaintiffs Savannah Haynie and Porfirio Hernandez’s motion to compel
further responses to Request for Production of Documents, Set One, is CONTINUED
to October 2, 2024 at 9:30 a.m. in Dept. SE-C.
 
Moving Party to give NOTICE. 
 
 
This is a Song-Beverly action. Plaintiffs
move to compel further responses to Requests for Production of Documents, Set
One, numbers 18-20, 22, 23, 26-30, 45-46, and 48-49.  This matter was continued from May 22, 2024,
when the Court ordered the parties to further meet and confer and submit a
joint statement in 20 days.  The parties
submitted a joint statement on July 2, 2024, and there appear to be unresolved
issues.  
 
The
Court has reviewed the joint statement and finds that the parties still did not
adequately meet and confer.  The motion
is CONTINUED to Wednesday, October 2, 2024 at 9:30 A.M. in Dept. SE-C.  The parties are ordered to meet and confer again.
 If there are discovery issues they
cannot resolve, they are to submit an AMENDED JOINT SEPARATE STATEMENT of the remaining
issues by September 18, 2024.  The
parties are not foreclosed from seeking a trial continuance in Dept. SE-F.
