And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendants, Jumpstart Bodyfuel, LLC and Linda Ikeda, filed a motion for summary judgment with less than 75 days' notice. The court cannot shorten this notice period without the parties' stipulation, which did not occur in this case. Additionally, the defendants did not file a memorandum of points and authorities until one week before the hearing date, which may be construed as an admission of an absence of merit. Based on these facts, the judge denies the motion for summary judgment and orders the moving party to provide notice.
