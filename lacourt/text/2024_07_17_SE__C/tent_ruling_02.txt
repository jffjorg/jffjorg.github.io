Moving
Party to give NOTICE.
 
 
Plaintiff
Elite Home Remodeling, Inc. is a general contractor, and it entered a contract
with Defendant for construction services to be performed. Defendant has not
paid Plaintiff. 
 
Plaintiff moves to compel responses to Special
Interrogatories, Set One from Defendant, Requests for Production of Documents,
Set One from Defendant, and Requests for Admissions, Set One from Defendant. 
 
Special Interrogatories, Set One 
 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2030.290, subdivision (b) allows the propounding
party to file a motion to compel responses to interrogatories if a response has
not been received.  If responses are
untimely, the responding party waives objections. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290,
subd. (a).)  
 
Plaintiff served Defendant with Special Interrogatories,
Set One on March 22, 2023 by electronic service. (Decl. Baradarian, ¶ 2, Ex. A.)
Adding the two days because of electronic service, responses were due on
or before April 25, 2024. (Decl. Baradarian, ¶ 2, Ex.
A.) Defendant served responses without objections on July 3, 2024. (Decl.
Diefenbach, ¶ 3.) 
 
Thus, the motion is MOOT.   
 
Sanctions:  Discovery sanctions may not be imposed
under Section 2023.030, even together with Section 2023.010, absent another
provision of the Discovery Act that authorizes the imposition of sanctions. (City
of L. A. v. PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLC (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 466,
500.) Sanctions with respect to interrogatories are only authorized against a
party who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel responses. (Code
of Civ. Proc. § 2030.290, subd. (c).) 
 
Here, sanctions
are denied because the motion is moot. 
 
Requests for Production of Documents, Set One 
 
Code of Civil
Procedure section 2031.300, subdivision (b) allows the propounding party to
file a motion to compel responses to document demands if a response has not
been received.  If responses are untimely, the responding party waives
objections. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).)
 
Plaintiff served Defendant with Requests for
Production of Documents, Set One on March 22, 2023 by electronic service. (Decl.
Baradarian, ¶ 2, Ex. A.) Adding the two days because of electronic service, responses were due on
or before April 25, 2024. (Decl. Baradarian, ¶ 2, Ex.
A.) Defendant served responses without objections on July 3, 2024. (Decl.
Diefenbach, ¶ 3.) 
 
Thus, the motion is MOOT. 
 
Sanctions:  Discovery sanctions may not be imposed
under Section 2023.030, even together with Section 2023.010, absent another
provision of the Discovery Act that authorizes the imposition of sanctions. (City
of L. A. v. PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLC (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 466,
500.) Sanctions with respect to requests for production of documents are only
authorized against a party who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to
compel responses. (Code of Civ. Proc. § 2031.300, subd. (c).) 
 
Here, sanctions
are denied because the motion is moot. 
 
Requests for Admissions, Set One 
 
Where
a party fails to respond to requests for admissions, the propounding party may move for an order that
the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the
requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).)  The
court “shall” grant a motion to deem admitted the matters specified in the
requests for admissions, “unless it finds that the party to whom the requests
for admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion,
a proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial
compliance with Section 2033.220.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).) 
 
The
motion is moot because Defendant served responses that are in substantial
compliance with Section 2033.220. (Decl. Diefenbach, ¶
3.)
 
Sanctions:
“It is mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction under [Code of Civil
Procedure section 2023.010, et seq.] on the party or attorney, or both,
whose failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated
this motion.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)  
 
Plaintiff’s
attorney requests $3,561.65. Because of the straightforward nature of this
motion, the Court awards $1,100.00 total.
