TENTATIVE RULING
 
Defendants Jumpstart Bodyfuel, LLC and Linda
Ikeda’s Motion for Summary Judgment is DENIED. 
Moving Party to give NOTICE.
 
On
June 4, 2024, Defendants Jumpstart Bodyfuel, LLC and Linda Ikeda filed a motion
for summary judgment and scheduled it to be heard on July 17, 2024. Parties
moving for summary judgment must provide at least 75 days’ notice.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 437, subd. (a)(2); UAS
Management, Inc. v. Mater Misericordiae Hosp. (2008) 169 Cal.App.4th 357,
368.)  Defendants provided fewer than 75
days’ notice. Further, courts cannot shorten the 75-day notice required for
summary judgment motions, without the parties' stipulation to do so. (Robinson
v. Woods (2008) 168 Cal. App. 4th 1258, 1262-67.) Here, according to the
opposing papers, the parties did not stipulate to do so. 
 
Further, Defendants did not file any
memorandum of points and authorities until July 10, 2024, one week before the
hearing date. Also, Defendants called it a supplemental memorandum of points
and authorities. The failure to file a memorandum supporting a motion may be
construed as an admission of an absence of merit.  (California Rule
of Court, rule 3.1113(a).) Further, a judge in a civil case is not
"'obligated to seek out theories [a party] might have advanced, or to
articulate … that which … [a party] has left unspoken.'"  (Mesecher v. County of San Diego (1992)
9 Cal.App.4th 1677, 1686.)
 
Based on the above, the motion
is DENIED. 
 
Moving party to give notice.
