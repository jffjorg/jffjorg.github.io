CASE

HEARING:

#4
TENTATIVE ORDER
 
Plaintiff’s
Motion to Compel Further Response to Defendant’s First Set of Requests for
Production is CONTINUED. 
 
Moving
Party to give NOTICE. 
 
 
Background
 
This
is a Song-Beverly action. 
 
Plaintiff
Maria E. Salmeron moves to compel further responses to her Request for
Production of Documents, Set One from defendant Jaguar Land Rover North
America, LLC. 
 
Timeliness 
 
Notice of the motion to compel further must be
provided within 45 days of service of the verified response or on or before any
specific later date to which the parties have agreed. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310,
subd. (c).) This 45-day deadline runs from the date the verified response is
served and is extended for service by mail in accordance with Code of Civil
Procedure sections 1010.6, subdivision (a)(4) and 1013, subdivision (a). Failure
to timely move to compel within the specified period constitutes a waiver of
any right to compel a further response. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (c).)

 
On
October 25, 2023, Defendant served unverified responses to Plaintiff’s first set
of requests for production of documents. (Decl. Kohanoff, ¶ 22, Ex. 5.)
Responses consisted of objections and responses. (Decl. Kohanoff, ¶ 22, Ex. 5.)
Defendant served verifications on November 21, 2023. (Decl. Kohanoff, ¶ 22. Ex,
6.) The 45-day clock runs only upon service of verified responses. (Code. Civ.
Proc., § 2031.250, subd. (a).) Plaintiff filed the instant motion on December
8, 2023. 
 
Taking
into account of November 21, 2023 as the response date, Plaintiff is timely.  
 
Meet
and Confer
 
The
motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.310, subd. (b)(2).) A meet and confer declaration in support of a motion
shall state facts showing a reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal
resolution of each issue presented by the motion. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2016.040.) 
 
For purposes of
determining whether a motion to compel discovery was preceded by a reasonable
and good faith effort to meet and confer, such an attempt at informal
resolution requires something more than bickering with opposing counsel;
rather, the law requires that counsel attempt to talk the matter over, compare
their views, consult, and deliberate. (Clement v. Alegre (2009) 177
Cal.App.4th 1277, 1294.) 
 
Based
on the meet-and-confer letters, it appears that the parties did not meet and
confer in good faith. For example, Plaintiff proposed that the parties stipulate
a protective order, and Defendant said that it will produce responsive
documents pursuant to a protective order. (Decl. Kohanoff, ¶¶ 27, 29, Ex. 7, 8.)
Defendants also suggested that the parties speak by telephone to further
deliberate. (Decl. Kohanoff, ¶ 29, Ex. 8.)
 
The
parties are ordered to meet and confer telephonically, in person, or by video
conference. If there are outstanding issues remaining, they are to submit a
joint amended separate statement by August 16, 2024. The Court will hear any outstanding
issues on Wednesday, August 28, 2024 at 10:30 A.M. in Dept. SE-C.
