TENTATIVE RULING
 
Defendants’ demurrer and motion to strike to portions
of Plaintiff’s Complaint are CONTINUED to October 9, 2024 at 10:30 a.m. in
Dept. SE-C.  
Moving Party to give NOTICE.
 
Defendants’ demurrer and motion to strike were
filed on November 27, 2023 and set for hearing on July 17, 2024.  On July 15, 2024, Defendants filed replies to
Plaintiff’s oppositions, but the oppositions had not been filed.  Plaintiff filed oppositions on July 16,
2024.  Plaintiff’s counsel states she
thought the oppositions had been filed on July 4, 2024, only to realize later,
after she returned from vacation, that they had not been filed with the court
because the client’s credit card was declined for payment. (Henderson Decl., ¶¶
2-6.) In the exercise of its discretion, the Defendants’ demurrer and motion to
strike are continued to October 9, 2024 at 10:30 a.m. in Dept. SE-C for the
Court to consider the opposition and reply briefs.  
Based upon a preliminary review of the briefs,
the Court invites supplemental briefing on the following issue: to what extent,
if any, are Defendants Crechena Wise, Melissa Christensen, and Melinda Ortiz
immune from liability for their alleged conduct in this lawsuit, as individuals
and in the official capacities, pursuant to Cal. Govt. Code § 820.2.  
Section 820.2 provides, “Except as otherwise
provided by statute, a public employee is not liable for an injury resulting
from his act or omission where the act or omission was the result of the
exercise of the discretion vested in him, whether or not such discretion be
abused.”
Defendants may file and serve their briefs no
later than September 16, 2024.  Plaintiff
may file and serve a brief no later than September 25, 2024.  No other briefing is permitted absent further
order of the Court.
