And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the petition for writ of mandate without prejudice, as the petitioner has not provided sufficient evidence to prove that he was a victim of identity theft. The petitioner claims that he was a victim of identity theft and never purchased two vehicles (Toyota Camry and Toyota Prius) that were registered in his name. However, the petitioner has not submitted evidence to support his claim, and the court cannot assume the task of initiating and prosecuting a search of the record for any purpose of discovering errors not pointed out in the briefs.

The court also notes that the petition for writ of mandate is not verified under penalty of perjury, and the petitioner did not attach a sworn declaration or other competent evidence to his opening brief. Furthermore, the petitioner has not cited any statute or regulation suggesting that the DMV has a ministerial duty to change its records under the circumstances of this case.

The court orders the petitioner to meet-and-confer with the DMV's counsel before filing any new petition to determine whether there might be a resolution without litigation.
