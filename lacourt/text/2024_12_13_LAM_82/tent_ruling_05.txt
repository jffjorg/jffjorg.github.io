[Tentative] Order Continuing Hearing on Petition
for Late Claim
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
             Petitioner Daniel Williams (“Petitioner”) petitions
for an order relieving him from the claim presentation requirement of
Government Code section 945.4 with respect to his claim for damages against
Respondent City of Los Angeles (“Respondent” or the “City”).  Respondent opposes the petition.  The court continues the hearing to January 13,
2025, at 9:30 a.m.     
 
BACKGROUND
 
            On
December 4, 2023, Petitioner allegedly tripped and fell on “uneven broken
asphalt” at 1119 Hoover Street in Los Angeles, California.  (Hayes Decl. ¶ 2, Exh. A.)  Petitioner allegedly sustained injuries to
his left leg, back, neck, and shoulders and claims damages of $1,000,000.  (Ibid.)  On or about May 26, 2024—which was a Sunday—Petitioner’s
attorney, Ernest J. Lingenfelter, directed an employee of the Law Offices of
Gene J. Goldsman to file a government claim against the City of Los
Angeles.  (Lingenfelter Decl. ¶ 3.)  According to Lingenfelter, the claim “was
completed and submitted on that date” through the City’s “claims presentation
portal.”  (Id. ¶¶ 3-4.)  Petitioner does not submit a declaration of
the employee, who is not identified by Lingenfelter.  Nor does Petitioner provide a copy of the
claim purportedly submitted on May 26, 2024. 

 
The deadline to submit a claim was
June 4, 2024, per Government Code section 911.2.    On
June 17, 2024, Petitioner submitted an untimely claim for damages.  Lingenfelter explains that this
“supplemental” claim was submitted after he had not received “confirmation of
the submission and filing” that was allegedly made on May 26, 2024.  (Id. ¶ 4 and Exh. 1, 2.)  On June 26, 2024, the City returned
Petitioner’s claim without taking any action “[b]ecause the claim was not
presented within the time allowed by law.”  (Hayes Decl. ¶ 2, Exh. B.)  
 
            On July 5, 2024,
the City received documentation from Petitioner, which the City treated as an
application for leave to present a late claim. (Hayes Decl. ¶ 2, Exh. C.)  Then, on or
about July 10, 2024, Petitioner’s counsel sent a letter to the City of Los
Angeles, City Clerk titled “Late Government Claim Supplemental Letter,” which
stated in part:
 
Our office filed a claim through your online portal on May
26, 2024 which fell within the allotted 6 month period to file such claims for
damages. After receiving no response, we filed a subsequent claim again through
your online portal on June 17, 2024. Our office filed the claimed timely
through your portal initially, and has done subsequent late filings along with
emails sent to: attclaimsubmit@lacity.org as well as multiple calls and
voicemails left at (213)978-1133 / (213)978-7081 / (213)978-7050 all to which
we have received no response. 
 
This letter is to advise that the claim was initially filed
within the allotted timeframe of 6 months. It was filed electronically through
your online portal on Sunday, May 26, 2024.
 
(Lingenfelter Decl. ¶ 4, Exh.
2.)  On July 11, 2024, the City denied
Petitioner’s application for leave to present a late claim.  (See Hayes Decl., ¶ 2, Exh. D.)  Petitioner filed the instant petition on
September 9, 2024.    
 
LEGAL STANDARD 
 
Government Code
section 911.2(a) states that “a claim relating to a cause of action for death
or for injury to person or to personal property . . . shall be presented . . .
not later than six months after the accrual of the cause of action.”  If a claimant fails to make a claim within
six months pursuant to Government Code section 911.2, the claimant may make a
written application to the board of the public entity for permission to present
a late claim within a reasonable time but not to exceed one year from the
accrual of the cause of action.  (Gov.
Code § 911.4(a)-(b).)  If, pursuant to
the provisions of Government Code section 911.6, the board denies the
application to present a late claim, the claimant may petition the Court for
relief from the requirements of Government Code section 945.4.  (Gov. Code § 946.6(a).)
 
Government Code
section 946.6(b) requires that the petition to the court must show each of the
following: (1) that the late claim application made to the board was denied or
deemed denied; (2) the reason for failure to present the claim within six
months of the accrual of the cause of action; and (3) the contents of the claim
as required by Government Code section 910. 
The petition must be filed within six months after the application to
present a late claim to the board was denied or deemed to be denied.  (Ibid.) 

 
The petitioner
bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the
late-claim application was made within a reasonable time and that one of the
statutory requirements under Government Code section 946.6(c) was met.  (Drummond
v. County of Fresno (1987) 193 Cal.App.3d 1406, 1410.)  Under section 946.4(e), the trial court must
make its determination upon the petition, “relying upon any affidavits in
support of, or in opposition to, the petition and any additional evidence
received at hearing on the petition.”  (Ebersol v. Cowan (1983) 35 Cal.3d 427,
431.)  
 
“Section 946.6 is
a remedial statue intended to provide relief from technical rules which
otherwise provide a trap for the unwary claimant.”  (Id. at 435.)  “[D]oubts will be resolved in favor of the
party attempting to get to trial to the end that wherever possible, cases may
be heard on their merits.”  (Kaslavage
v. West Kern County Water Dist. (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 529, 537.)  
 


 
DISCUSSION 
 
Petitioner’s claim for damages arose on December 4, 2023, when he
alleged fell.  The deadline to file a
claim was June 4, 2024.  Petitioner’s
attorney asserts that a government claim was “submitted” on May 26, 2024,
within the six-month filing period. 
(Lingenfelter Decl. ¶ 3 and Exh. 2.) 
If so, Petitioner does not need relief from the claims filing
requirement of section 945.4.  Therefore,
the court assumes without deciding that Petitioner first submitted a claim on
June 17, 2024, after the deadline.  Petitioner
made a written application to the City for leave to present a late claim on July
5, 2024, within one year of accrual of Petitioner’s claim.   (Hayes Decl. ¶ 2,
Exh. C.)  The
court also finds that the late-claim application was made within a “reasonable
time.”  (See Gov. Code § 911.4(a)-(b).)  
 
Pursuant to Government Code section 946.6(c)(1), the court may grant
relief from section 945.4 if “the failure to present the claim was through
mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect unless the public entity
establishes that it would be prejudiced in the defense of the claim if the
court relieves the petitioner from the requirements of Section
945.4.”  The showing
required of a petitioner seeking relief because of mistake, inadvertence,
surprise, or excusable neglect is the same as required by Code of Civil
Procedure section 473(b).  (See Viles v. State (1967) 66 Cal.2d 24, 29.)
 “[I]t is uniformly held that for relief
on any or all of the stated grounds it must be shown that one’s misconception
was reasonable, or that it might have been the conduct of a reasonably prudent
person under similar circumstances.”  (Kaslavage v. West Kern County Water Dist.
(1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 529, 539 fn.1.)
 
Petitioner’s
counsel argues that his employee submitted a claim on or about May 26, 2024,
but he or she never received “confirmation of the submission and filing, which
is typical when these types of claims are submitted via the City’s claims
presentation portal . . . .”  (Lingenfelter
Decl. ¶ 4.)  As a result of this
confusion, Petitioner’s counsel then submitted a claim after the deadline.  As Respondent’s counsel points out, there is
no foundation for these statements, since Petitioner’s counsel’s declaration is
based upon hearsay (from the employee).

ORDER
 
            Based upon the foregoing, the court

provide a copy of the claim purportedly submitted on May 26, 2024, or to
