Motion for Attorney Fees 
The Court has
considered the moving papers. 
The Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion for attorney fees in the reduced amount
of $10,575.00. 
 
Background
            This
case was an unlawful detainer action, where Defendants s T-Five USA, A
California corporation dba Benest Flooring and Yong Cheoll Kim (Defendants)
possessed the property at issue (the Property). Defendants possessed the
Property pursuant to a written lease agreement, which states in pertinent part:
“if any Party or Broker brings an action or proceeding involving the Premises
whether founded in tort, contract or equity, or to declare rights hereunder,
the Prevailing Party […] in any such proceeding, action, or appeal thereon,
shall be entitled to reasonable attorney’s fees. Such fees may be awarded in
the same suit or recovered in a separate suit, whether or not such action or
proceeding is pursued to decision or judgment.” (Motion, Exhibit A.) 
            On
August 30, 2024, this Court entered a final judgement in favor of Plaintiff
Esperanza Holdings LLC (Plaintiff) against Defendants. 
            On
September 25, 2024, Plaintiff filed the present motion for an order to collect
its attorney fees. No opposition was filed. 
 
Legal
Standard
“[A]s a general rule, attorney fees are
not recoverable as costs unless they are authorized by statute or agreement.” (People
ex rel. Dept. of Corporations v. Speedee Oil Change Systems, Inc. (2007)
147 Cal.App.4th 424, 429.)  
For contracts actions, “where the contract
specifically provides that attorney's fees and costs, which are incurred to
enforce the contract, shall be awarded either to one of the parties or to the
prevailing party, then the party who is determined to be the party prevailing
on the contract, whether he or she is the party specified in the contract or
not, shall be entitled to reasonable attorney’s fees in addition to other
costs.” (Civ. Code § 1717(a).) “[T]he party prevailing on the contract shall be
the party who recovered a greater relief in the action on the contract.” (Id.
§ 1717(b)(1).) A successful party means a prevailing party, and [a party]
may be considered prevailing parties for attorney’s fees purposes if they
succeed on any significant issue in litigation which achieves some of the
benefit the parties sought in bringing suit.” (Bowman v. City of Berkeley
(2005) 131 Cal.App.4th 173, 178.)
The attorney bears the burden of proof as
to “reasonableness” of any fee claim. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5(c)(5).) This
burden requires competent evidence as to the nature and value of the services
rendered. (Martino v. Denevi (1986) 182 Cal.App.3d 553, 559.) A
plaintiff’s verified billing invoices are prima facie evidence that the costs,
expenses, and services listed were necessarily incurred. (See Hadley v.
Krepel (1985) 167 Cal.App.3d 677, 682.) “In challenging attorney fees as
excessive because too many hours of work are claimed, it is the burden of the
challenging party to point to the specific items challenged, with a sufficient
argument and citations to the evidence. General arguments that fees claimed are
excessive, duplicative, or unrelated do not suffice.” (Lunada Biomedical v.
Nunez (2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 459, 488, quoting Premier Med. Mgmt. Sys.,
Inc. v. California Ins. Guarantee Assn. (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 550,
564.)¿¿ 
In determining whether the requested
attorney’s fees are “reasonable,” the Court’s “first step involves the lodestar
figure—a calculation based on the number of hours reasonably expended
multiplied by the lawyer’s hourly rate. The lodestar figure may then be
adjusted, based on consideration of facts specific to the case, in order to fix
the fee at the fair market value for the legal services provided.” (Gorman
v. Tassajara Development Corp. (2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 770, 774 [internal
citations omitted].) In determining whether to adjust the lodestar figure, the
Court may consider the nature and difficulty of the litigation, the amount of
money involved, the skill required and employed to handle the case, the
attention given, the success or failure, and other circumstances in the case. (EnPalm
LLC v. Teitler (2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 770, 774; PLCM Group, Inc. v.
Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095.) “‘The reasonable market value
of the attorney's services is the measure of a reasonable hourly rate.
[Citations.] This standard applies regardless of whether the attorneys claiming
fees charge nothing for their services, charge at below-market or discounted
rates, represent the client on a straight contingent fee basis, or are in-house
counsel. [Citations.]’” (Center For Biological Diversity v. County of
San Bernardino (2010) 188 Cal.App.4th 603, 619.) 
 
 


Discussion
            Plaintiff moves for an award of
attorney fees of $12,000.00 against Defendants. Because the Court on August
30, 2024 entered final judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendants,
the Court finds that Plaintiff is the prevailing party. The fees of Plaintiff’s
attorneys are broken down as follows:

Reasonableness of Rates
Requested rates are reasonable if they are
“within the range of reasonable rates charged by and judicially awarded
comparable attorneys for comparable work.” (Children’s Hospital &
Medical Center v. Bonta (2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 740, 783.) The Court may
consider the sworn declarations of Plaintiff’s attorneys regarding their
customary fees, hourly rate determinations in other cases, and the prevailing
fees in the community as evidence of the reasonable market rate. (Heritage
Pacific Financial, LLC v. Monroy (2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 972, 1009.)¿ 
Plaintiff is seeking an award of attorney
fees at a rate of $475.00 and $375.00 per hour, depending on the attorney and
the experience of that attorney. (Nussbaum Decl., ¶ 4; Stillman Decl., ¶ 3;
DeBolt Decl., ¶ 3; Ruttenberg Decl., ¶ 3; Uss Decl., ¶ 3; Zaki Decl., ¶ 3.) The
Court finds that these rates are within the reasonable rates by attorneys with
similar qualifications and experience for comparable work. 
Reasonableness
of Hours 
            In calculating the lodestar rate,
“the court may rely on its own knowledge and familiarity with the legal market,
as well as the experience, skill, and reputation of the attorney requesting
fees [Citation], the difficulty or complexity of the litigation to which that
skill was applied [Citations], and affidavits from other attorneys regarding
prevailing fees in the community and rate determinations in other cases.
[Citation.]” (569 East County Boulevard LLC v. Backcountry Against the Dump,
Inc. (2016) 6 Cal.App.5th 426, 437.) 
            Firstly, included in Plaintiff’s
calculation of $12,000.00 in attorney fees are fees associated with the filing
of the present motion. Specifically, Plaintiff requests one (1) hour in
drafting the motion, an anticipated one (1) hour in reviewing and replying to the
opposition, and an anticipated three (3) hours traveling to, from, and
appearing at, the hearing at $475.00 an hour. (Nussbaum Decl., ¶ 4.) This
becomes $2,375.00. The Court declines to award one (1) hour requested for reviewing
and replying to the opposition since no opposition was filed. The time
travelling to, from, and appearing at, the hearing will be reduced to one (1)
hour, given the option of remote appearances. Thus, the total amount of fees
requested in association with the filing of this motion will be reduced from
$2,375.00 to $950.00. The total amount requested altogether will therefore
decrease from $12,000.00 to $10,575.00. 
            Lastly, the Court find that the rest
of the 23.4 hours requested to be reasonable. The Court finds that the time to
review documents, draft the complaint, assess trial documents, prepare for
trial, and handle bankruptcy related issues, to be reasonable. The Court also
notes that Defendants do not contest the amount Plaintiff requested in attorney
fees as no opposition has been filed. 
 
The Court therefore GRANTS Plaintiff’s
motion for attorney fees in the reduced amount of $10,575.00.
