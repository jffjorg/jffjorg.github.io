Background
            This
is a Song Beverly Action. On March 20, 2024, Plaintiffs Derrick Ervinand
Phyllis Ervin (Plaintiffs) filed suit against defendant Kia America, Inc.
(Defendant). Plaintiffs alleged on March 7, 2022, they purchased a 2023 Kia
Sportage, manufactured by Defendant. Plaintiffs further allege that when they
received the subject vehicle, it had serious defects and nonconformities to the
warranty including, but not limited to, defects to the body system, the
powertrain system, the safety system, the electrical system, and the braking
system. Plaintiffs assert claims under the Song Beverly Act as well as for
breaches of the warranty.
             On March 19, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a
complaint against Defendant Kia America, Inc. (Defendant) alleging five causes
of action for violation of the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act.
Specifically, Plaintiffs alleged causes of action for violation of (1) subdivision
(d) of Civil Code Section 1793.2; (2) subdivision (b) of Civil Code Section
1793.2; (3) subdivision (a)(3) of Civil Code Section 1793.2; (4) Breach of
Express Written Warranty and (5) Breach of Implied Warranty of Merchantability.

            On
May 17, 2024, Defendant filed a motion to compel responses to Special
Interrogatories, set one from Plaintiff Derrick Ervin and a motion to compel
responses to Special Interrogatories, set one from Plaintiff Phyllis Ervin. No
opposition was filed. 
 
Legal
Standard
Within 30 days after service of
interrogatories, the party to whom the interrogatories are propounded shall
serve the original of the response to them on the propounding party, unless on
motion of the propounding party the court has shortened the time for response,
or unless on motion of the responding party the court has extended the time for
response. (Code Civ. Proc. section 2030.260, subd. (a).)
If a party to whom interrogatories are
directed fails to serve a timely response, the propounding party may move for
an order compelling responses and for a monetary sanction. (Code Civ. Proc
section 2030.290, subd. (b).) The statute contains no time limit for a motion
to compel where no responses have been served. All that needs be shown in the
moving papers is that a set of interrogatories was properly served on the
opposing party, that the time to respond has expired, and that no response of
any kind has been served. (Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d
902, 905-906.) 
            A party waives its objections to a
discovery request when it does not serve a timely response to the request.
(Code Civ. Proc. 2030.290(a)) Even if objections do not need to be verified,
objections will be waived if the responding party “fails to file any
response within the statutory time period.” (Food 4 Less Supermarkets, Inc.
v. Superior Court (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 651, 658.) 
 
Discussion
            On April 12, 2024, Defendant served
requests for responses to Special Interrogatories, set one upon both Plaintiff
Derrick Ervin and Plaintiff Phyllis Ervin. (Sniderman Decls., ¶ 3; Exhibit A.)
Because the first set of Special Interrogatories was served on Plaintiffs on
April 12, 2024, Plaintiffs’ responses were technically due within 30 days,
which would have been May 12, 2024. However, because May 12, 2024 fell on a
Sunday and with the addition of two court days for electronic service,
Plaintiffs’ responses were due no later than May 15, 2024. However, both
Plaintiff Derrick Ervin and Plaintiff Phyllis Ervin have failed to provide
their responses to Special Interrogatories, set one by the required deadline.
(Sniderman Decls., ¶ 4.) Plaintiffs have also not filed an opposition outlining
substantial justification as to why neither of them provided their responses to
Defendant’s requests. 
Thus, Plaintiffs are compelled to provide Code-compliant responses,
without objections, to Defendant’s requests for responses to Special
Interrogatories, set one. 
 
Sanctions
“It is mandatory that the court impose a
monetary sanction under [Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010, et seq.]
on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely response to
requests for admission necessitated this motion.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280,
subd. (c).)   
Sanctions are mandatory in connection with
motions to compel responses to interrogatories against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel unless the
court “finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290(c), 2031.300(c), 2033.280(c).)
Sanctions are mandatory against Plaintiffs
because they both failed to timely serve response to Defendant’s Special
Interrogatories, set one. Here, Defendant is seeking $500.00 in reasonably incurred
costs and fees in bringing the motion against Plaintiff Derrick Ervin and
$500.00 in reasonably incurred costs and fees in bringing the motion against
Plaintiff Phyllis Ervin. (Sniderman Decls., ¶ 5.) The Court finds the request
for a set amount of $500.00 for each motion to be appropriate. Defendant’s
counsel declares he anticipates incurring fees more than $500.00 for each
motion, but ultimately requests this reduced lump sum. (Sniderman Decls., ¶ 5.)
The Court finds the amount requested exceedingly reasonable and imposes
sanctions in the amount of $500.00 for each motion.
The Court therefore GRANTS Defendant’s motions
to compel Plaintiff Derrick Ervin and Plaintiff Phyllis Ervin’s responses to
Special Interrogatories, set one. Plaintiffs shall provide Code-compliant responses, without objections, within
15 days of this order. 
The Court GRANTS Defendant’s request for
monetary sanctions against both Plaintiff Derrick Ervin and Plaintiff Phyllis
Ervin in the amount of $500.00 for each motion totaling $1,000,00. Sanctions
are payable within 30 days of this order.
