Here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The court's tentative ruling grants the defendant's motion to compel the plaintiffs' responses to special interrogatories, set one. The plaintiffs, Derrick Ervin and Phyllis Ervin, failed to provide timely responses despite being served with the requests on April 12, 2024. The court finds that the plaintiffs' failure to respond is without substantial justification and therefore imposes monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,000.00. The court also grants the defendant's request for sanctions in the amount of $500.00 for each motion, totaling $1,000.00. The plaintiffs are ordered to provide code-compliant responses, without objections, within 15 days of the order.
