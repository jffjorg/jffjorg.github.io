And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in plain English:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to deem the requests for admission admitted and to award sanctions against the defendant. The defendant, Ronnie M. Perez, was served with requests for admission on July 23, 2024, but failed to respond to them. The plaintiff filed the motion on September 4, 2024, and the defendant did not oppose it. The judge ordered the defendant to pay sanctions of $573.75 to the plaintiff's counsel within 20 days of the order. The judge's decision is based on California law, which requires the court to award sanctions when a party fails to provide responses to requests for admission.
