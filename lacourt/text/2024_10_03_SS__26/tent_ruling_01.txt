Casualty Indemnity Exchange v. Young, et al.MOTION
TO VACATE JUDGMENTTENTATIVE RULING:
 
Defendant Jawaun De Anthony Young’s Second Motion to
Vacate Judgment is DENIED.
 
 
ANALYSIS:
 
Plaintiff California Casualty Indemnity Exchange
(“Plaintiff”) filed this action for insurance subrogation against Defendant
Jawaun De Anthony Young (“Defendant”) on September 22, 2022. Default judgment
was entered against Defendant on February 8, 2023. 
 
Defendant filed a Motion to Vacate Judgment (“the first
Motion to Vacate”) on June 20, 2024. The Court denied that Motion on July 15,
2024. (Minute Order, 07/15/24.) On the same date, Defendant filed another
Motion to Vacate the Judgment for which no hearing was reserved. Defendant then
filed a renewed Motion to Vacate Judgment (“the renewed Motion”) on July 31,
2024. The renewed Motion was denied without prejudice on September 10, 2024.
(Minute Order, 09/10/24.) 
 
Defendant filed the instant Motion to Vacate Judgment (“the second
Motion”) on September 10, 2024. No opposition has been filed to date. 
 
Discussion
 
As with the first and Renewed Motions to Vacate, Defendant’s
second Motion is not accompanied by a timely proof of service demonstrating
service of the motion papers or notice of hearing on Plaintiff. Instead,
Defendant filed proof of service indicating that Plaintiff was served with the
motion papers on September 30, 2024. (Proof of Personal Service, filed
09/30/24, ¶4.) This was only three court days prior to the hearing. The service
requires a minimum of 16 court days’ notice with respect to noticed motions.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1005.) Failure to give notice of a motion is not only a
violation of the statutory requirements but of due process. (Code Civ. Proc., §
1005; Jones v. Otero (1984) 156 Cal.App.3d 754, 757.)
 
Second, the Motion is not
accompanied by a memorandum of points and authorities, as required. “The
memorandum must contain a statement of facts, a concise statement of the law,
evidence and arguments relied on, and a discussion of the statutes, cases, and
textbooks cited in support of the position advanced.” (Cal. Rules of Court,
Rule 3.1113(b).) The Motion, however, cites no legal authority in support of
the request for relief. (Motion, pp. 3:1-5:4.) Indeed, Defendant’s failure to
provide a memorandum as required by the Rule is an “admission that the
[request] is without merit and cause for its denial.” (Cal. Rules of Court,
Rule 3.1113(a), (b); In re Marriage of Falcone & Fyke (2012) 203
Cal.App.4th 964, 976.)
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, Defendant Jawaun De Anthony Young’s Second
Motion to Vacate Judgment is DENIED.
 
 
Court clerk to give notice.
