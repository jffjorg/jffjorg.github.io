ANALYSIS:
 
On November 2,
2023, Plaintiff Huntington2507, LLC (“Plaintiff”) filed this action for breach
of contract and fraud against Defendants Hui Ying Chen (“Defendant Chen”) and
Peggy Ly Chienh (“Defendant Chienh”). Defendant Chen
filed an answer on December 5, 2023. On April 9, 2024, the Court granted
Plaintiff’s Motion to Deem Requests for Admission Admitted and Request for
Monetary Sanctions against Defendant Chen. (Minute Order, 04/09/24.) 
 
Defendant
filed the instant Motion for Leave to Amend Admissions; Request for Relief from
Waiver of Objections; and Request for Relief from Monetary Sanctions on August
8, 2024. Plaintiff filed an opposition on September 19, 2024 and Defendant
replied on September 30, 2024. Also on September 30, 2024, Defendant filed
supplemental documents.
 
 
 
Discussion
 
The exhibits that were intended to be attached to
Defendant’s moving declaration, and that were then purportedly filed with
Defendant’s supplemental documents on September 30, 2024, are not attached to
either the declaration or supplemental documents. (See Chen Decl., filed
08/08/24; Supp. Filings, filed 09/30/24.) The Court, therefore, cannot rule on
the instant Motion at this time. The hearing on the Motion is continued to
December 4, 2024 at 10:00 am in Department 26 in the Spring Street Courthouse.
Defendant Chen is to file the missing exhibits by November 13, 2024 to ensure
the Court has sufficient time to review all the papers before the hearing.
Failure to file the exhibits by November 13, 2024 will result in the Motion
being denied. No other papers are to be filed by the parties in connection with
the instant Motion. 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant Hui Ying Chen’s Motion for Leave to Amend
Admissions; Request for Relief from Waiver of Objections; and Request for
Relief from Monetary Sanctions is CONTINUED TO DECEMBER 4, 2024 AT 10:00 IN
DEPARTMENT 26 IN THE SPRING STREET COURTHOUSE, PURSUANT TO THE ORDER DETAILED HEREIN.
