```

Summary:

The Judge has issued a Tentative Ruling sustaining the Defendant's Demurrer to the First Amended Complaint without leave to amend. The Court finds that the Plaintiff lacks standing to assert a claim under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (RFDCPA) because the alleged emotional harm caused by the Defendant's actions is not sufficient to confer standing. The Court also notes that the Plaintiff's allegations do not demonstrate actual harm or an invasion of privacy, but rather only intended to invade the Defendant's privacy. The Court relies on various federal and California court cases to support its ruling, including Limon v. Circle K Stores Inc., Pennell v. Global Trust Management, LLC, and Medicredit v. Lupia.
