Creditors
Adjustment Bureau, Inc. v. Perez, et al.MOTION
TO DEEM REQUESTS FOR ADMISSION ADMITTED; 
REQUEST
FOR SANCTIONS
(CCP
§ 2033.280)
TENTATIVE RULING: 
 
Plaintiff Creditors Adjustment
Bureau, Inc.’s Motion to Deem Requests for Admission Admitted and Request for
Sanctions is GRANTED. DEFENDANT RONNIE M. PEREZ IS ORDERED TO PAY SANCTIONS OF
$573.75 TO PLAINTIFF’S COUNSEL WITHIN 20 DAYS’ SERVICE OF THIS ORDER.
 
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
Plaintiff Creditors Adjustment Bureau, Inc. (“Plaintiff”)
served Requests for Admissions, Set Two, on Defendant Ronnie M. Perez on July
23, 2024. (Motion, Brown Decl., Exh. 1.)
To date, despite a meet and confer effort, Defendant has not served verified
responses to the Requests for Admission. (Id. at ¶¶6-7 and Exh. 2.) Plaintiff
filed the instant Motion to Deem Requests for Admission Admitted and Request
for Sanctions on September 4, 2024. No opposition has been filed to date.
 
Discussion
 
There is no requirement for a prior meet and confer effort
before a motion to deem requests for admission can be filed. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2033.280.) Further, the motion can be brought at any time after the
responding party fails to provide the responses. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280.)
Due to Defendant’s failure to timely serve verified responses and resultant
waiver of objections, Plaintiff is entitled to an order deeming the Requests
for Admission admitted. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280.) 
 
The Court is required to award sanctions under the moving
statute. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).) While properly noticed, the
sanctions sought are excessive for a straightforward and unopposed motion
regarding initial discovery responses. Under a lodestar calculation, sanctions
are granted against Defendant in the amount of $573.75 based on one hour of
attorney time billed at $500.00 per hour, plus the $73.75 in costs. (Motion, Brown
Decl., ¶9.)
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff Creditors Adjustment
Bureau, Inc.’s Motion to Deem Requests for Admission Admitted and Request for
Sanctions is GRANTED. DEFENDANT RONNIE M. PEREZ IS ORDERED TO PAY SANCTIONS OF
$573.75 TO PLAINTIFF’S COUNSEL WITHIN 20 DAYS’ SERVICE OF THIS ORDER.
