[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE: APPLICATION FOR DEFAULT JUDGMENT 
 
Dept.

November

          Plaintiffs
Xiaoping Wu and Evergreen Property Service Inc. (collectively, “Plaintiffs”)
seek a default judgment against defendant Fuguo Brothers Group, Inc. (“Defendant”).

The request for court judgment on Form
CIV-100 indicates that the Complaint only demands $30,000 in damages. However,
the Court notes that the Complaint also demands other items according to proof,
including holdover damages at a specified rate of $166.66 per day, reasonable attorney
fees, costs, as well as utilities and late fees in the amount of $2,548.98. This
is consistent with the amounts listed in the supporting declaration of Rodney
Swanson, who avers that Plaintiffs seek 30,000 in past-due rent, $3,999.84 in
holdover damages, $2,500 in attorney fees, $466.33 in costs, and $2,548.98 for
utilities and late fees, as well as the proposed judgment on Form JUD-100. 
Accordingly, the application for a
default judgment is GRANTED. 
Dated
this 16th day of November, 2023
