ANALYSIS:
 
On March 29, 2023, Plaintiff Boren, Osher & Luftman, LLP
(“Plaintiff”) served Special Interrogatories, Set One, on Defendant Camila Rose
(“Defendant”) (Motion, Osher Decl., Exh. 1.)
Following Defendant’s failure to serve timely responses, Plaintiff sought to
meet and confer about the outstanding responses. (Id. at Exh. 2.) Due to
Defendant’s continued non-response, Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to Compel
Responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for Sanctions, on November
13, 2023. No opposition has been filed to date.
 
Discussion
 
There is no requirement for a prior meet and confer effort
before a motion to compel initial responses can be filed. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290.) Further, the motion can be brought at any time after the responding
party fails to provide the responses. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290.) Based on Plaintiff’s failure to timely
respond to the propounded discovery, Defendant is entitled to an order
compelling service of verified responses to the discovery requests without
objections. 
 
Defendant’s failure to timely respond constitutes a misuse
of the discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d).) Sanctions
are appropriate under Code of Civil Procedure sections 2023.010 and 2023.030
and have been properly noticed. However, the sanctions sought are excessive for
a simple and unopposed discovery motion. Under a lodestar calculation,
sanctions are awarded in the amount of $386.70 based on half-an-hour of
attorney time billed at $645.00 per hour and a filing fee of $64.20. (Motion, Osher Decl., ¶13.) 
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff Boren, Osher & Luftman, LLP’s Motion to Compel
Responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for Sanctions, is GRANTED. DEFENDANT CAMILA ROSE IS TO SERVE VERIFIED RESPONSES TO THE
DISCOVERY REQUESTS WITHOUT OBJECTIONS WITHIN 20 DAYS’ SERVICE OF THIS ORDER. DEFENDANT
IS ALSO ORDERED TO PAY SANCTIONS OF $386.70 TO PLAINTIFF’S COUNSEL WITHIN 20 DAYS’ SERVICE OF THIS ORDER.
