ANALYSIS:
 
Plaintiff State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (“Plaintiff”)
propounded Form Interrogatories, Set One and Request for Production of
Documents, Set One, on Defendant Feixiong Wang (“Defendant Lam”) on August 30,
2023. (Motion, Shapiro Decl., Exh. A.) Despite a meet and confer effort, as of
the filing of this Motion to Compel Responses to Written Discovery and Request
for Monetary Sanctions, no responses have been served. (Id. at ¶¶6-8 and
Exh. B.) 
 
Discussion
 
There is no requirement for a prior meet and confer effort
before a motion to compel initial responses or deem admissions admitted can be
filed. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290; 2031.300.) Furthermore, the motions can
be brought any time after the responding party fails to provide the responses.
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290; 2031.300.) Therefore, Plaintiff is entitled to
an order compelling Defendant to serve verified responses to the
interrogatories and requests for production without objections. 
 
Defendant’s failure to timely respond to the requests
constitutes a misuse of the discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010,
subd. (d).) Sanctions are appropriate under Code of Civil Procedure sections
2033.280, 2023.010 and 2023.030 and have been properly noticed. Therefore, the
requests for sanctions are granted against Defendant in the amount of $560.00
based on two hours of attorney time billed at $250.00 an hour. (Id. at ¶9.)
The sanctions are to be paid within 20 days’ service of this order.
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company’s Motion Compelling Responses to Written Discovery, and for Monetary
Sanctions is GRANTED. DEFENDANT FEIXIONG WANG IS TO SERVE VERIFIED
RESPONSES WITHOUT OBJECTION TO THE INTERROGATORIES AND REQUESTS FOR PRODUCTION WITHIN
20 DAYS’ SERVICE OF THIS ORDER. DEFENDANT IS ALSO ORDERED TO PAY SANCTIONS OF $560.00
TO PLAINTIFF’S COUNSEL WITHIN 20 DAYS’ SERVICE OF THIS ORDER.
