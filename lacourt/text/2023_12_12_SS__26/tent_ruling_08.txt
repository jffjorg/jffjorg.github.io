ANALYSIS:
 
On September 24, 2001, Plaintiff Thomas Beck, Esq.
(“Plaintiff”) filed the instant action for breach of retainer agreement against
Defendants Warren Summer and Karin Winkler (“Defendants”). Judgment was entered
on January 8, 2003. Acknowledgment of Satisfaction of Judgment (Partial) was
filed on January 5, 2006. Other documents, including Applications and Orders
for Appearance and Examination were subsequently filed. The judgment was
renewed on January 8, 2013. Defendants’ Motion to Vacate Renewal of Judgment
was denied on February 22, 2023. (Minute Order, 02/22/23.) 
 
Defendants filed a Notice of Appeal of the February 22, 2023
order on June 5, 2023. Defendants
filed the instant Motion to Stay Case and Take Appropriate Corrective Action
Regarding Lawyer Misconduct on August 11, 2023. The Motion was
originally set for hearing on November 8, 2023 and continued with notice to
November 27, 2023. (Minute Order, 11/08/23.) Plaintiff filed an opposition on October 24, 2023 and
Defendants replied on November 3, 2023. 
 
Discussion
 
The motion is brought pursuant to Cal. Rules of Court rule
3.515 and Code of Civil Procedure section 404.5. Neither authority is grounds
to stay this action pending Defendants’ appeal of the Court’s order on February
22, 2023 denying their Motion to Vacate Renewal of Judgment. Rule 3.515 states
that “[a]ny party may file a motion for an order under Code of Civil Procedure
section 404.5 staying the proceedings in any action being considered for, or
affecting an action being considered for, coordination, or the court may stay
the proceedings on its own motion.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.515(a).) The
rule, therefore, expressly applies to actions being considered for
coordination. This action is neither being considered for coordination nor
affects an action being considered for coordination. Code of Civil Procedure
section 404.5 is likewise directed only at actions being considered for
coordination: “Pending any determination of whether coordination is
appropriate, the judge making that determination may stay any action being
considered for, or affecting an action being considered for, coordination.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 404.5.) 
 
Defendants’ request for “corrective action” against
Plaintiff is brought pursuant to the Code of Judicial Ethics, Canon 3D, which
states that a judge shall take corrective action whenever they have “personal
knowledge, * or concludes in a judicial decision, that a lawyer has committed
misconduct or has violated any provision of the Rules of Professional Conduct .
. . .” (Cal. Rules of Prof. Conduct, Canon 3, § D(2).) The memorandum, however,
does not set forth the particular misconduct or rule violations that trigger
this obligation by the court. Instead, it refers to a 12-page declaration that
mostly reiterates Defendants’ contention that the renewal of judgment should be
vacated. (Motion, Summer/Winkler Decl., ¶¶3-4, 8-10.) The declaration also
refers to Plaintiff’s service of papers despite declaring under penalty of
perjury that he is not a party to this action. In opposition, Plaintiff does
not address this misconduct. Accordingly, the Court takes the following
corrective action: if Plaintiff signs any other proof of service despite
stating under penalty of perjury that he is not a party to this legal action,
the Court intends to report Plaintiff to the State Bar of California. 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendants Warren Summer and Karin
Winkler’s Motion to Stay Case and Take Corrective Action Regarding Lawyer Misconduct is DENIED IN PART
AND GRANTED IN PART. THE REQUEST TO STAY THE ACTION IS DENIED. THE REQUEST TO
TAKE CORRECTIVE ACTION IS GRANTED AND PLAINTIFF IS WARNED THAT FURTHER
MISCONDUCT WITH RESPECT TO PROOFS OF SERVICE WILL BE REPORTED TO THE STATE BAR
OF CALIFORNIA.
