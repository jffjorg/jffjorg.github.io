ANALYSIS:
 
Plaintiff Amica
Mutual Insurance Company (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant action for automobile
subrogation against Defendant Raelin Saree Walker (“Defendant”) on January 11,
2021. Defendant filed an answer on February 25, 2021. On August 29, 2022, Plaintiff filed a Stipulation and Order for
Entry of Judgment. The Court signed the order and dismissed the action with a
retention of jurisdiction under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6 on the
same date. (Stip and Order, filed 08/29/22.) 
 
Plaintiff filed
the instant motion to enforce
settlement and enter judgment on September 26, 2023. No opposition has been
filed to date.
 
Discussion
 
The instant motion is brought under Code of Civil Procedure, section
664.6, which states in relevant part:
 
If parties to pending litigation
stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties outside the presence of the court
or orally before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the
court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.
If requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties
to enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of the
settlement.
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6, subd.
(a).) Prior to January 1, 2021, “parties” under section 664.6 meant the
litigants themselves, not their attorneys. 
(Levy v. Superior Court (1995) 10 Cal.4th 578, 586.) The current
statute provides that “parties” includes “an attorney who represents the party”
and an insurer’s agent. (Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6, subd. (b).) The settlement
must include the signatures of the parties seeking to enforce the agreement,
and against whom enforcement is sought. (J.B.B. Investment Partners, Ltd. v.
Fair (2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 974, 985.) The settlement agreement here complies with the statutory
requirements set forth above because it was signed by the parties and their
counsel. (Motion, Tapper Decl., Exh. A, p. 5.) Therefore, the Court finds that
the parties’ settlement agreement is enforceable under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6.
 
Furthermore, the request for
retention of jurisdiction must be made in writing, by the parties, before the
action is dismissed for the Court’s retention of jurisdiction to conform to the
statutory language. (Wackeen v. Malis (2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 429, 433 [“If,
after a suit has been dismissed, a party brings a section 664.6 motion for a
judgment on a settlement agreement but cannot present to the court a request
for retention of jurisdiction that meets all of these requirements, then
enforcement of the agreement must be left to a separate lawsuit.”].) The
parties’ request for retention of jurisdiction complies with these requirements
because it was made in writing to the Court before the action was dismissed.
(Motion, Tapper Decl., Exh. A, ¶9.) 
 
The settlement agreement provides
that Defendant would pay Plaintiff $8,800 by an initial payment from
Defendant’s insurer in the amount of $3,000.00 followed by Defendant’s monthly
payments starting on October 15, 2022. (Id. at Exh. A, ¶¶1-3.) The
settlement agreement also provides that if Defendant defaults, judgment in the demand
of the Complaint ($10,704.07), plus interest from January 11, 2021, and court
costs, less monies paid, may be entered in Plaintiff’s favor. (Id. at
Exh. A, ¶5.) Defendant only made payments in the amount of $5,400.00 and,
thereafter defaulted. (Id. at ¶4.) Plaintiff seeks an order entering
judgment against Defendants based on the settlement amount of $5,304.07 principal
($10,704.07 - $5,400.00), $1,434.28 interest at ten percent per annum from January
11, 2021, and $225.00 costs. (Id. at ¶5.) 
 
Conclusion
 
Therefore, Plaintiff Amica Mutual
Insurance Company’s Motion to Enforce Settlement Agreement and Enter Judgment
is GRANTED IN THE AMOUNT OF $5,304.07 PRINCIPAL, $1,434.28 INTEREST, AND
$225.00 COSTS.
