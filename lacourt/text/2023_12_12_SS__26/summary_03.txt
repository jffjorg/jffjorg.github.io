And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge regarding a future court hearing. The case is Weiner v. Century Property Management Investments, Inc., et al. (Case Number: 22STLC04924). The defendants, Century Property Management & Investment, Inc. and Deion Gerhard, have filed a motion to continue the trial date. The judge has granted this motion, continuing the trial date to April 24, 2024.

The defendants argue that they need more time to complete discovery due to the plaintiff's lack of substantive responses to discovery requests and failure to make herself available for deposition. The plaintiff disputes these claims, but the judge finds that the circumstances demonstrated by the defendants are reasonable grounds to continue the trial date.

The judge considers the factors set out in California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1332, including proximity of the trial date, previous continuances, length of the continuance requested, availability of alternative means to address the problem, prejudice to parties or witnesses, and whether trial counsel is engaged in another trial. Based on these factors, the judge finds that the factors weigh in favor of the requested continuance.

The judge orders that the trial date be continued to April 24, 2024, and that discovery and motion cutoff dates will follow the new trial date.
