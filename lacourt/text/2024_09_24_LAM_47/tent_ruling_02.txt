STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is a lemon law action filed on February 21, 2023, against the
vehicle dealer and its assignee. Plaintiff purchased a 2016 Mercedes-Benz
S-Class on October 28, 2022. Plaintiff subsequently discovered the vehicle had
severe structural damage and engine leaks from a previous accident which was
not disclosed to him before purchasing the vehicle.
 
Plaintiff moves for an award of
attorney’s fees and costs following acceptance of a statutory offer to
compromise. 
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Plaintiff’s Motion for Attorney’s
Fees is GRANTED in the amount of $19,762.50 plus $1,027.40 in costs. 
 
DISCUSSION:
 
Plaintiff moves for an award of
attorney’s fees in the amount of $23,098.50 and costs in the amount of
$1,027.40 following acceptance of a statutory offer to compromise. 
Plaintiff’s Evidentiary Objections
 
            Plaintiff
objects to portions of the Declaration of Tod Beebe submitted in support of the
opposition to this motion. The Court rules on these objections as follows:
 
Objection No. 1:
 SUSTAINED as hearsay. This exhibit is an
out-of-court statement offered for the truth of its contents. 
 
Objection Nos. 2-5:
SUSTAINED as irrelevant. The conclusions of opposing counsel are arguments, not
evidence, and have no probative value. 
 
Entitlement
to Fees
 
Plaintiff seeks an award of
attorney’s fees pursuant to a settlement agreement reached by the parties.
Plaintiff brought claims for violation of the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty
Act. (Civ. Code § 1790 et seq.). Civil Code section 1794(d) states:
 
If the buyer prevails in an action
under this section, the buyer shall be allowed by the court to recover as part
of the judgment a sum equal to the aggregate amount of costs and expenses,
including attorney's fees based on actual time expended, determined by the
court to have been reasonably incurred by the buyer in connection with the
commencement and prosecution of such action.
 
            On May 22,
2024, Defendant JPMorgan Chase Bank accepted Plaintiff’s offer to compromise
under Code of Civil Procedure section 998 to pay Plaintiff $20,865.76 in
exchange for a return of the vehicle. (Plaintiff’s Exh. 4.) The offer provided
for an award of reasonable attorney’s fees to Plaintiff by noticed motion
pursuant to Civil Code section 1794(d), with the award to be paid by Defendant.
(Id. ¶ 4.) The parties agree that Plaintiff is the prevailing party for
the purposes of this motion. (Id.) 
 
Reasonableness of
Fees
 
            Plaintiff requests a total fee award
of $23,098.50, based on a total
of $19,762.50 in fees accrued by Plaintiff’s counsel before the instant motion,
plus $3,336.00 in anticipated fees to review the opposition, draft a reply
brief, and attend the hearing, plus $1,027.40 in costs. (See Notice of Motion.)

 
            Reasonable attorney’s fees are allowable costs when
authorized by contract, statute, or law. (Code Civ. Proc § 1033.5(a)(10),
(c)(5)(B).) In actions that are based on a contract, “where the contract
specifically provides that attorney’s fees and costs, which are incurred to
enforce that contract, shall be awarded either to one of the parties or to the
prevailing party, then the party who is determined to be the party prevailing
on the contract… shall be entitled to reasonable attorney’s fees in addition to
other costs.” (Civil Code § 1717(a) [emphasis added].) A recovery of attorney’s
fees is authorized even in noncontractual or tort actions if the contractual
provision for fee recovery is worded broadly enough. (See Code Civ. Proc §
10211; Maynard v. BTI Group, Inc. (2013) 216 Cal.App.4th 984, 993
[agreement to award fees based on outcome of “any dispute” encompasses all
claims, “whether in contract, tort or otherwise]; Lockton v. O'Rourke (2010)
184 Cal.App.4th 1051, 1076; Lerner v. Ward (1993) 13 Cal.App.4th 155,
160.) 
Reasonable attorney’s fees shall be fixed by the Court and
shall be an element of the costs of suit. (Code Civ. Proc. § 1033.5(c)(5)(B).)
Reasonable attorney’s fees are ordinarily determined by the Court pursuant to
the “lodestar” method, i.e., the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied
by the reasonable hourly rate. (See PLCM Group, Inc. v. Drexler (2000)
22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095-1096; Margolin v. Regional Planning Com. (1982)
134 Cal.App.3d 999, 1004 [“California courts have consistently held that a computation
of time spent on a case and the reasonable value of that time is fundamental to
a determination of an appropriate attorneys' fee award.”].) “[T]he lodestar is the basic fee for
comparable legal services in the community; it may be adjusted by the court
based on factors including, as relevant herein, (1) the novelty and difficulty
of the questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the
extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded other employment by the
attorneys, (4) the contingent nature of the fee award….”  (Ibid.)
In setting the hourly rate for a fee award, courts are entitled to consider the
“fees customarily charged by that attorney and others in the community for
similar work.” (Bihun v. AT&T Info. Sys., Inc. (1993) 13 Cal.App.4th
976, 997 [affirming rate of $450 per hour], overruled on other grounds by Lakin
v. Watkins Associated Indus. (1993) 6 Cal.4th 644, 664.)  The burden
is on the party seeking attorney’s fees to prove the reasonableness of the
fees. (Center for Biological Diversity v. County of San Bernardino
(2010) 188 Cal.App.4th 603, 615.) 
The Court has
broad discretion in determining the amount of a reasonable attorney’s fee
award, which will not be overturned absent a “manifest abuse of discretion, a
prejudicial error of law, or necessary findings not supported by substantial
evidence.” (Bernardi v. County of Monterey (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th
1379, 1393-1394.)  The Court need not explain its calculation of the
amount of attorney’s fees awarded in detail; identifying the factors considered
in arriving at the amount will suffice. (Ventura v. ABM Indus. Inc.
(2012) 212 Cal.App.4th 258, 274-275.)
Plaintiff has
provided an itemized list of the attorney time billed in connection with this
case. (Plaintiff’s Exh. 6.) Plaintiffs’ counsel billed a total of 54.3 hours of
attorney and paralegal time in connection with this case at hourly rates
ranging from $155 to $695 per hour, plus 4.5 anticipated hours at $695 per hour.
(Id.) Attorneys Gregory Babbit, Stacia Ratliff, and Joseph Green attest
to their own skills, training, and hourly rates. (Declaration of Gregory Babbit
ISO Mot; Declaration of Stacia Ratliff ISO Mot.; Declaration of Joseph Green
ISO Mot.) Attorney Christopher Barry attests to the skills, training, and
hourly rates of the remaining attorneys and paralegals involved in this matter as
their supervisor and Managing Partner of the firm, as well as his own. (Declaration
of Christopher Barry ISO Mot. ¶¶ 9-20.) 
The Court observes that these hours and fees were incurred by seven
attorneys and two paralegals across eighteen months of litigation. (Plaintiff’s
Exh. 6; see also Barry Decl. ¶ 9.) Close examination of the records
shows, however, that the bulk of the hours were incurred by Attorney Laura
Gaudet, who billed $280 per hour for 29.4 hours of work. (Id.) Further,
the records show that the remaining attorneys incurred few hours performing
generally non-duplicative tasks. Moreover, the records show that research and
drafting tasks were generally assigned to more junior attorneys charging lower
rates, while reserving strategic and editing pursuits and client communication
to more senior attorneys. (Id.) The sole major example of a senior
attorney performing drafting work is Attorney Barry’s preparation of this fee
motion, which, including the 4.8 anticipated hours, accounts for 8.3 of his
claimed 9.9 hours incurred. (Id.)  These records demonstrate that Plaintiff’s
counsel exercised billing judgment, notwithstanding the number of attorneys
involved in the case. That said, the Court is not inclined to award Plaintiff
fees which were not actually incurred, and therefore will not award the $3,336
in anticipated fees. 
            Defendant,
in opposition, argues that the hourly rates of Plaintiff’s counsel are unreasonable
and should instead be capped at $495 per hour for partners and $371 for
associates, based on the “2023 Real Rate Report.” The Court declines to
consider this material, as it is not only hearsay, but does not analyze the
state of the legal profession with respect to Song-Beverly cases, and thus is
of limited value to this matter. Findings by other trial courts are similarly
unpersuasive. Nor is the Court
persuaded by Defendant’s argument that the case was overstaffed; despite the
number of attorneys involved in the case, the billing records do not
demonstrate runaway costs caused by high staffing and duplicative work.
 
Defendant also identifies instances of
what it contends are excessive billing records for preparation of template
filings, including the instant motion and duplicative billing by various
attorneys. However, Defendant offers no evidence that this is so: the arguments
of Defendant’s counsel in opposition briefing are not evidence that these entries
are improper. Nor is the Court persuaded by the unsupported assertion that it
was improper for Plaintiff’s counsel to bill time in increments of one-tenth of
an hour for various tasks which Defendant claims, without evidence, took “a few
seconds.” 
 
The Court is therefore not persuaded that
any reduction of the fee award is required beyond the elimination of
anticipated hours. The Court will therefore award attorney’s fees in the amount
of $19,762.50.
 
Costs
 
            Plaintiffs also seek an award of
costs in the amount of $1,027.40. 
 
            A prevailing party on a Song-Beverly
claim may also seek to recover costs reasonably incurred, as well as attorney’s
fees. (Civ. Code § 1794(d).) Once a request for costs is properly challenged,
the burden shifts to the propounding party to demonstrate why such costs are
recoverable and proper. (Whatley-Miller v. Cooper (2013) 212 Cal.App.4th
1103, 1113.) Costs are normally sought by way of a memorandum of costs pursuant
to California Rule of Court 3.1700(a). However, as Defendant consents to the
determination of costs via this motion, the Court will exercise its discretion
to do so. 
 
Plaintiff included a memorandum of costs as part of the filings on this
motion. (Plaintiff’s Exh. 8.)
Defendant does not object to the costs claimed. The Court will therefore award
the full amount of costs.  
 
CONCLUSION: 
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion
for Attorney’s Fees is GRANTED in the amount of $19,762.50 plus $1,027.40 in costs. 
 
            Moving
Party to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
