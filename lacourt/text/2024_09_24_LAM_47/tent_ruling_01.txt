CASE:                         Ken Houang, et al. v. Rochelle H.
Sterling, et al. 
 
CASE NO.:                 22STCV32478            
 
MOTION
TO COMPEL COMPLIANCE WITH THIRD-PARTY DEPOSITION SUBPOENA

 
MOVING PARTY:               Plaintiff Ken Houang. 
 
RESPONDING PARTY(S): No response on
eCourt as of 09/19/24.  
 
STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is a habitability action that was filed on October 4, 2022.
Plaintiffs, who are and were tenants at a residential apartment complex, allege
that Defendants permitted the premises to develop extensive uninhabitable
conditions and allowed those conditions to persist in violation of statutes and
municipal ordinances. Plaintiffs seek monetary and injunctive relief.
 
Plaintiff moves to compel non-parties
LA Testing and EMSL Analytical, Inc.  to
appear for deposition and produce documents. 
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Plaintiffs’ Motion to Compel
Deposition is GRANTED. LA Testing and EMSL Analytical, Inc. are ordered to
appear for deposition and produce responsive documents on or before October 1,
2024. 
 
This ruling is conditioned on the
payment of $60 in filing fees within 5 days of this order. 
 
DISCUSSION:
 
Plaintiff moves to compel
non-parties LA Testing and EMSL Analytical, Inc.  to appear for deposition and produce
documents. 
 
Multiple Motions
 
            Multiple
motions should not be combined into a single filing.¿(See¿Govt. Code,¿§
70617(a)(4) [setting forth the required filing fee for each motion,
application, or any other paper or request requiring a hearing];¿see¿also¿Weil
& Brown, Civil Procedure Before Trial, [8:1140.1] at 8F-60 (The Rutter
Group 2011)¿[“Motions to compel compliance with separate discovery requests
ordinarily should be filed separately.”].) 
 
Here, Plaintiff seeks to compel
compliance with two deposition subpoenas in a single motion. Combining multiple
motions under the guise of one motion with one hearing reservation manipulates
the Court Reservation System and unfairly jumps ahead of other litigants.
Moreover, combining motions to avoid payment of separate filing fees deprives
the Court of filing fees it is otherwise entitled to collect.
 
            The Court
therefore conditions its ruling on this motion on the payment of an additional $60
in filing fees within 5 days of this order.
 
Legal Standard
 
            Code
of Civil Procedure section 1987.1(a) states, in relevant part:


If a subpoena requires the attendance of a
witness or the production of books, documents, or other things before a court,
or at the trial of an issue therein, or at the taking of a deposition, the
court, upon motion . . . may make an order . . .  directing compliance with it upon those terms
or conditions as the court shall declare, including protective orders. In
addition, the court may make any other order as may be appropriate to protect
the person from unreasonable or oppressive demands, including unreasonable
violations of the right of privacy of the person.
 
(Code Civ. Proc. § 1987.1(a).) There is no
meet and confer requirement in section 1987.1. There is also no requirement for
a separate statement when no response has been provided to the request for
discovery. (Cal. Rules of Court Rule 3.1345(b)(1).) Furthermore, there is no
requirement for a showing of good cause for production of documents in
connection with a deposition subpoena. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2020.510(b); Terry
v. SLICO (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 352, 358.)
 
Failure to Appear
 
            Plaintiff
personally served both LA Testing and EMSL Analytical, Inc. with deposition
subpoenas on August 1, 2024 for deposition on August 26, 2024. (Declaration of
Gerald S. Ohn ¶ 3.) Neither entity appeared for deposition. (Id. ¶ 3;
Exhs. B-C.) Plaintiff is therefore entitled to compel these entities to appear
and produce responsive documents. 
 
//
CONCLUSION:

 
Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ Motion
to Compel Deposition is GRANTED. LA Testing and EMSL Analytical, Inc. are
ordered to appear for deposition and produce responsive documents on or before
October 1, 2024. 
 
This ruling is conditioned on the
payment of $60 in filing fees within 5 days of this order. 
 
            Moving
Party to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.

should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an
order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
