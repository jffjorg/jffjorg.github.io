Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has sustained Airbnb's demurrer to the complaint, but has granted leave to amend. The court finds that the plaintiff's complaint does not plead sufficient facts to establish a cause of action for negligence or premises liability against Airbnb. The court concludes that Airbnb did not own, manage, control, or operate the vacation rental property, and therefore did not have a duty to maintain the property in a safe condition. The court also finds that Airbnb did not have notice of the property's dangerous condition and could not reasonably foresee the plaintiff's injuries. The court orders the plaintiff to file and serve an amended complaint, if any, within 20 days of the date of notice of this order.
