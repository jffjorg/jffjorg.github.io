And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for leave to file a Third Amended Complaint. The plaintiff had sought to add a new cause of action to the complaint, but the judge found that the motion was untimely and would cause prejudice to the defendants. The judge noted that the plaintiff had not shown that it did not delay in filing the motion and that the plaintiff's counsel did not state when the facts giving rise to the amended allegations were discovered. The judge also found that the defendants would be prejudiced by allowing the plaintiff to amend the complaint, as it would require the defendants to file new motions for summary judgement in response to the new cause of action.
