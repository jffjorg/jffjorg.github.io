  Case Number:  20STCV03325    Hearing Date:   October 21, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
considered the petitioning papers submitted August 8, 2024, August 14, 2024, and
September 25, 2024, the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On
January 27, 2020, Plaintiff N.A. (“Plaintiff”), a minor, by and through his
guardian ad litem Noushin Anvarzadeh, filed this action against Defendants Los
Angeles Unified School District (“District”) and Amara Kamara (“Kamara”) for
violations of the Unruh Civil Rights Act, violations of Government Code section
11135, negligent hiring, retention, and supervision, intentional infliction of
emotional distress, negligent infliction of emotional distress, assault, and
battery. 
On
August 10, 2020, the Court appointed Noushin Anvarzadeh to serve as Plaintiff’s
guardian ad litem. 
On
October 22, 2020, Plaintiff filed a first amended complaint against the same
defendants for negligence, negligent hiring, training, supervision, and
retention, battery, assault, violations of the Ralph Act, violations of the
Unruh Act, violations of the Bane Act, and intentional infliction of emotional
distress. 
On
November 23, 2020, the District filed an answer. On January 22, 2021, Kamara
filed an answer. 
On
May 26, 2023, Plaintiff filed a notice of settlement. 
On
April 30, 2024, Petitioner Noushin Anvarzadeh (“Petitioner”) filed a petition
to approve minor’s compromise to be heard on May 29, 2024. The Court continued
the hearing to June 24, 2024 to allow the Court’s Probate Legal Unit to review
the proposed special needs trust instrument. 
On
June 24, 2024, the Court issued a ruling and continued the hearing to July 29,
2024. The Court directed Petitioner to submit a revised petition and proposed
order addressing the issues raised in the Court’s ruling, including proper
service on the three State agencies. 
On
July 25, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel filed a declaration asking the Court to
continue the hearing on the petition from July 29, 2024 to August 23, 2024 or
the next available date because Petitioner needed time to consider how to
proceed in light of the Court’s June 24, 2024 order requiring the proposed
trustee of the special needs trust to post a bond. 
On
July 29, 2024, the Court posted a tentative ruling and continued the hearing to
August 23, 2024. The Court directed Petitioner to submit a revised petition and
proposed order addressing the issues raised in the Court’s June 24, 2024
ruling, including proper service on the three State agencies. 
On
August 8, 2024, Petitioner filed a revised petition to approve minor’s
compromise. On August 14, 2024, Petitioner filed a revised proposed order. The
petition was set for hearing on August 23, 2024. 
On
August 23, 1013, the Court issued a ruling (1) directing Petitioner to complete
sections 14 and 15 of the petition, (2) setting the trustee's bond at $75,000.00, and (3) directing Petitioner to submit a new proposed order including specified revisions.  The Court continued the hearing to October 2,
2024 and ordered Petitioner to submit a revised petition and proposed order at
least 10 days before the continued hearing. 
On
September 25, 2024, Petitioner filed a petition to approve the compromise of
Plaintiff’s claim and a proposed order. 
The Court continued the October 2, 2024 hearing to October 21, 2024. 
PETITIONER’S REQUEST 
Petitioner
Noushin Anvarzadeh asks the Court to approve the compromise of the pending
action of Plaintiff N.A., including placement of the net settlement proceeds in
a special needs trust. 
DISCUSSION 
A.   Petition to approve minor’s compromise 
Petitioner
has addressed the minor’s compromise issues raised in the Court’s June 24, 2024
and August 23, 2024 orders. 
B.   Special needs trust 
1.    Notice to State agencies 
When
seeking approval of a special needs trust (SNT), notice of the hearing and
service of the petition must be made on three State agencies: the Department of
Mental Health, the Department of Developmental Services, and the Department of
Health Care Services.  (See Prob. Code, §§
3602, subd. (f), 3611, subd. (c).) 
The
proof of service of the petition and proposed order submitted on September 25, 2024
does not show service on the three State agencies.  Although Petitioner provided proof of
service on the State agencies of the petition and order filed on August 8,
2024, the State agencies are entitled to notice of the current petition which
the Court is considering.  The Court will
therefore continue the hearing for the required notice to the three State agencies.  
2.    Proposed order 
The
proposed order states that the first
accounting should take place in one year and is due in 14 months.  Petitioner should also include a specific 14-month
calendar due date in the proposed order.    
The
proposed order should include a specific date and time for the OSC to be set in
this Department in approximately 60 days to ensure the funding of the
settlement, submission of bond, and the filing of LASC Form PRO 044 to open a trust supervision action in the Probate Court. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court CONTINUES the hearing on the petition to approve the compromise of minor
Plaintiff N.A.’s action filed by Petitioner Noushin Anvarzadeh on September 25, 2024 to a date to be
provided at the October 21, 2024 hearing.  At least 10 days before the continued hearing,
Petitioner is to submit (1) a proof of service of the September 25, 2024
petition and proposed order on the three State agencies and (2) a revised
proposed order. 
Petitioner
is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Petitioner
is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court within
five days.
