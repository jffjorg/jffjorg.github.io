And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the plaintiff, Jessica Balint, waived her right to a jury trial in this case. The plaintiff filed her complaint on August 17, 2020, but did not post the required jury fee until June 24, 2022, more than 365 days after the complaint was filed. The judge found that this failure to post the fee within the statutory deadline constitutes a waiver of the right to a jury trial under Code of Civil Procedure section 631, subdivision (f). The plaintiff requested relief from this waiver, but the judge denied the request because the plaintiff failed to provide sufficient evidence to support her claim and because the plaintiff did not act promptly to seek relief. The judge also found that the defendant would be prejudiced if the case were to proceed with a jury trial, as the defendant's counsel had agreed to represent the defendant with the understanding that the trial would proceed without a jury.
