 Case Number:  24STCV00101    Hearing Date:   October 21, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
reviewed the moving and supplemental papers, the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On
January 3, 2024, Plaintiff Daveon Marnell St. Julian (“Plaintiff”) filed this
action against Defendants 7-Eleven, Inc. (“7-Eleven”), Megdal Century, LLC
(“Megdal Century”), Veronica Miranda Perez (“Perez”), Javier Martinez
(“Martinez”), and Does 1-100 for motor vehicle tort, general negligence,
premises liability, and negligent entrustment of a motor vehicle. 
On
January 26, 2024, 7-Eleven filed an answer. On April 18, 2024, Megdal Century
filed an answer. On May 2, 2024, Perez and Martinez filed an answer. 
On
April 3, 2024, Plaintiff filed a substitution of attorney form substituting
himself as a self-represented litigant in place of his former attorney. 
On
May 14, 2024, 7-Eleven filed a motion to compel Plaintiff’s further responses
to form interrogatories 2.8 and 2.13. The motion was set for hearing on July 2, 2024.
Plaintiff did not file an opposition. The Court continued the hearing to
September 17, 2024. 
On
September 17, 2024, the Court continued the hearing to October 21, 2024.  The Court ordered 7-Eleven to provide a
complete copy of Plaintiff’s responses to the form interrogatories and to
advise the Court whether the responses were verified. 
On
September 18, 2024, 7-Eleven filed a supplemental declaration. 
Trial
is currently scheduled for July 2, 2025. 
PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS 
A.      Informal Discovery Conference 
The
Eighth Amended Standing Order for Procedures in the Personal Injury Hub Courts
Effective October 10, 2022 (filed September 20, 2022), ¶ 9E, provides: “PI Hub
Courts will not hear Motions to Compel Further Discovery Responses to Discovery
until the parties have engaged in an Informal Discovery Conference (IDC).  PI Hub Courts may deny or continue a Motion
to Compel Further Responses to Discovery if parties fail to schedule and
complete an IDC before the scheduled hearing on a Motion to Compel Further Responses
to Discovery.” 
7-Eleven
scheduled and appeared for an IDC on August 9, 2024.  Plaintiff did not appear.  The Court found that 7-Eleven had satisfied
the IDC requirement. 
B.       Timeliness of motion 
A
notice of motion to compel further responses to interrogatories must be given
within 45 days of the service of the responses, or any supplemental responses,
or on or before any specific later date to which the parties have agreed in
writing. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (c) [interrogatories].)  When, as here, the responses are electronically served, the moving party has an additional 2 court days to file the motion.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1010.6, subd. (a)(3); see L. Edmon & C.
Karnow, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2024) ¶ 8:1146,
p. 8F-60 (Cal. Practice Guide).)  Failure to
file a motion within this time period constitutes a waiver of any right to
compel further responses to interrogatories. 
7-Eleven’s
motion is timely. 
C.   Meet and confer 
A
motion to compel further responses to interrogatories must be accompanied by a
meet and confer declaration under Code of Civil Procedure section
2016.040.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300,
subd. (b)(1) [interrogatories].)  “A meet
and confer declaration in support of a motion shall state facts showing a
reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal resolution of each issue
presented by the motion.”  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2016.040.)  
7-Eleven
has provided a meet and confer declaration. 
D.      Separate statement 
With
exceptions that do not apply here, California Rules of Court, rule 3.1345,
requires that any motion involving the content of discovery contain a separate
statement with the text of each request, the response, and a statement of
factual and legal reasons for why an order compelling further responses is
warranted.  
7-Eleven
has filed a separate statement. 
APPLICABLE LAW 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2030.300 provides: 
“(a) On receipt of a response to interrogatories, the
propounding party may move for an order compelling a further response if the
propounding party deems that any of the following apply: 
“(1) An answer to a particular interrogatory is
evasive or incomplete. 
 “(2) An
exercise of the option to produce documents under Section 2030.230 is
unwarranted or the required specification of those documents is inadequate. 
“(3) An objection to an interrogatory is without merit
or too general. 
“(b) (1) A motion under subdivision (a) shall be
accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040. 
“(2) In lieu of a separate statement required under
the California Rules of Court, the court may allow the moving party to submit a
concise outline of the discovery request and each response in dispute. 
“(c) Unless notice of this motion is given within 45
days of the service of the verified response, or any supplemental verified
response, or on or before any specific later date to which the propounding
party and the responding party have agreed in writing, the propounding party
waives any right to compel a further response to the interrogatories. 
“(d) The court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a further
response to interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the
sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make
the imposition of the sanction unjust. 
“(e) If a party then fails to obey an order compelling
further response to interrogatories, the court may make those orders that are
just, including the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a
terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In
lieu of, or in addition to, that sanction, the court may impose a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010).” 
(Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.300.) 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2030.220 provides: 
“(a) Each answer in a response to interrogatories
shall be as complete and straightforward as the information reasonably
available to the responding party permits. 
“(b) If an interrogatory cannot be answered
completely, it shall be answered to the extent possible. 
“(c) If the responding party does not have personal
knowledge sufficient to respond fully to an interrogatory, that party shall so
state, but shall make a reasonable and good faith effort to obtain the
information by inquiry to other natural persons or organizations, except where
the information is equally available to the propounding party.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.220.)

                                                        May 15, 2024

        Plaintiff has not carried his burden of establishing the
preliminary facts that are essential to his claims of attorney-client privilege
and work product protection.  (See Cal. Practice Guide, supra, ¶ 8:192, p. 8C-61.) 
          In addition, Plaintiff has not carried his burden of
establishing the extent and seriousness of the prospective invasion of the
privacy rights he asserts.  (See Cal.
Practice Guide, supra, ¶ 8:294, p. 8C-98.) 
          The Court also overrules Plaintiff’s objections based on discoverability,
vagueness, ambiguity, overbreadth, calling for a legal conclusion, and calling
for expert testimony. 
          The Court grants 7-Eleven’s motion to compel Plaintiff’s further responses to form interrogatories 2.8 and 2.13.  The Court orders Plaintiff to serve further verified
code-compliant responses to form interrogatories 2.8 and 2.13 on 7-Eleven by
November 21, 2024.
