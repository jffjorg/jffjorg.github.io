 Case Number:  20STCV31121    Hearing Date:   October 21, 2024    Dept:  28 Having  considered Defendant's trial brief and supporting declaration and Plaintiff's response, the Court rules as  follows.  BACKGROUND  On August  17, 2020, Plaintiff Jessica Balint (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendants Livio E. Gomez (“Defendant”) and Does 1-10  for intentional tort, negligent infliction of emotional distress, and intentional  infliction of emotional distress.  On  September 14, 2020, Plaintiff filed a first amended complaint against the same  defendants for general negligence, intentional tort, negligent infliction of emotional  distress, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.  On  January 15, 2021, Plaintiff filed a second amended complaint.  On  March 18, 2021, Defendant filed an answer.  On  June 24, 2022, Plaintiff filed a notice of posting jury fees.  On  December 23, 2022, Defendant filed a notice of stay of proceedings based on his  Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing.  On  June 23, 2023, Defendant filed a status report stating that “Plaintiff obtained  relief from the automatic stay to liquidate the claim for Defendant's Chapter 7  Bankruptcy.”  On  September 25, 2024, Defendant filed a trial brief asserting that Plaintiff  waived her right to a jury trial.  On  September 30, 2024, Plaintiff filed a response.   On October 1, 2024, Defendant’s counsel filed a declaration supporting  Defendant’s trial brief.  Trial  is currently scheduled for October 21, 2024.  PARTIES’ REQUESTS  Defendant  asks the Court to find that Plaintiff waived her right to a jury trial.  Plaintiff  asks the Court to find that (1) she did not waive her right to a jury trial or (2) the case should nonetheless proceed as a jury trial.  LEGAL STANDARD  Code  of Civil Procedure section 631 provides in part:  “(a) The right to a trial by jury as declared by  Section 16 of Article I of the California Constitution shall be preserved to  the parties inviolate. In civil cases, a jury may only be waived pursuant to  subdivision (f).  “(b) At least one party demanding a jury on each side  of a civil case shall pay a nonrefundable fee of one hundred fifty dollars  ($150), unless the fee has been paid by another party on the same side of the  case. The fee shall offset the costs to the state of providing juries in civil  cases. If there are more than two parties to the case, for purposes of this  section only, all plaintiffs shall be considered one side of the case, and all  other parties shall be considered the other side of the case. Payment of the  fee by a party on one side of the case shall not relieve parties on the other  side of the case from waiver pursuant to subdivision (f).  “(c) The fee described in subdivision (b) shall be due  on or before the date scheduled for the initial case management conference in  the action, except as follows:  * * *  “(2) If no case management conference is scheduled in  a civil action, or the initial case management conference occurred before June  28, 2012, and the initial complaint was filed on or after July 1, 2011, the fee  shall be due no later than 365 calendar days after the filing of the initial  complaint.  * * *  “(f) A party waives trial by jury in any of the  following ways:  * * *  “(5) By failing to timely pay the fee described in  subdivision (b), unless another party on the same side of the case has paid  that fee.  * * * “(g) The court may, in its discretion upon just terms,  allow a trial by jury although there may have been a waiver of a trial by jury.  . . .”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 631,  subds. (a), (b), (c)(2), (f)(5), (g).)  “  ‘The right to a jury trial is a basic and fundamental part of our system of  jurisprudence . . . In case of doubt, therefore, the issue should be resolved  in favor of preserving a litigant’s right to trial by jury.’ ”  (R. Fairbank et al., Cal. Practice Guide:  Civil Trials and Evidence (Rutter 2022) ¶ 2:311, p. 2-68 (Cal. Practice Guide),  quoting Byram v. Superior Court (1977) 73 Cal.App.3d 648, 652; see Grafton  Partners v. Superior Court (2005) 36 Cal.4th 944, 958 [“any ambiguity or  doubt concerning the waiver provisions of section 631 must be ‘resolved in  favor of according to a litigant a jury trial’ ”].)  “While  the matter is discretionary, ‘it is well settled that, in light of the public  policy favoring trial by jury, a motion to be relieved of a jury waiver should  be granted unless, and except, where granting such a motion would work serious  hardship to the objecting party.’ ”   (Cal. Practice Guide, supra, ¶ 2:317, pp. 2-69 to 2-70, quoting Boal  v. Price Waterhouse & Co. (1985) 165 Cal.App.3d 806, 809.)  “Stated differently, ‘The Court abuses its  discretion in denying relief where there has been no prejudice to the other  party or to the court from an inadvertent waiver.’”  (Id. at p. 2-70, quoting Gann v.  William Bros. Realty, Inc. (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 1698, 1704.)  “The  prejudice which must be shown to justify [denial of relief from jury trial  waiver] is prejudice from granting relief from the waiver, as opposed to  prejudice from a jury trial.” (Cal. Practice Guide, supra, ¶ 2:320, p.  2-70.)  DISCUSSION  Defendant  argues that Plaintiff waived her right to a jury trial under Code of Civil  Procedure section 631, subdivision (f), because she did not post jury fees  within 365 days after filing her complaint.   (See Code Civ. Proc., § 631, subd. (c)(2).)  Plaintiff filed her complaint on August 17, 2020.   However, by Plaintiff’s own admission, Plaintiff did not post jury fees  until June 24, 2022, more than 365 days after Plaintiff filed her complaint.  Plaintiff  does not dispute these facts.  Instead,  Plaintiff asks the Court to exercise its discretion to allow a jury trial under  Code of Civil Procedure section 631, subdivision (g), because Plaintiff posted  jury fees on June 24, 2022, Defendant did not object to Plaintiff’s late fee  deposit until September 25, 2024, and (according to Plaintiff) Defendant will not be prejudiced.  “The  grounds for relief [from jury trial waiver] must be clearly stated and  supported by a sufficient evidentiary showing.”  (Cal. Practice  Guide, supra, ¶ 2:313, p. 2-69.)  In  addition, “[a] party seeking relief jury waiver must do so promptly.  Delay is a factor the court may take into  consideration in deciding whether to grant relief.”  (Ibid., ¶ 2:314, p. 2-69.)  Here,  Plaintiff has provided no evidentiary support for her request to proceed with a  jury trial under Code of Civil Procedure section 631, subdivision (g).  Plaintiff’s response does not include a  declaration and does not explain why Plaintiff violated the statutory deadline  for posting jury fees.  Similarly,  Plaintiff has not shown that she acted promptly to seek relief from her jury  trial waiver.  Rather than filing a  motion for relief from jury trial waiver, Plaintiff waited for Defendant to  raise the issue in a trial brief.  Then, on September 30,  2024 (two weeks before the trial then scheduled for October 14, 2024),  Plaintiff filed a response asking the Court to relieve Plaintiff from the waiver.  Defendant  argues that, if the Court relieves Plaintiff from her jury trial waiver, Defendant  will suffer prejudice because his counsel agreed to represent Defendant with the  understanding that the trial would proceed without a jury.  Defendant’s counsel has filed a declaration  stating that, if the case is tried to a jury, counsel will “be forced to substitute  out of this case and/or request a continuance to associate in trial counsel  with jury trial experience.”  (Kazaryan  dec. ¶ 15.)  This  is not a “ ‘case of doubt’ ” in which the Court should exercise its discretion  to grant relief from a jury trial waiver.   (See Cal. Practice Guide, supra, ¶ 2:311, p. 2-68.)  Instead, Plaintiff has failed to carry her  burden of showing that the Court should exercise its discretion to grant relief  from Plaintiff’s waiver of jury trial.  The Court finds that Plaintiff waived her right to a jury trial.  The Court exercises its discretion to deny Plaintiff's request for relief from the waiver.CONCLUSION The  Court GRANTS Defendant Livio E. Gomez’s request to find that Plaintiff Jessica Balint waived her right to a jury  trial.  The Court finds that Plaintiff  Jessica Balint waived her right to a jury trial under Code of Civil Procedure  section 631, subdivision (f).  The  Court DENIES Plaintiff Jessica Balint’s  request for relief from jury trial waiver under Code of Civil Procedure section  631, subdivision (g).    Defendant  is ordered to give notice of this ruling.  Defendant  is ordered to file proof of service of this ruling within five days.
