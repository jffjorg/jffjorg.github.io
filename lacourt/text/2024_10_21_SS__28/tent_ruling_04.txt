The Court granted Defendant’s ex parte application to advance the hearing  on the motion and rescheduled the hearing for October 21, 2024.  On October 14, 2024, Plaintiffs filed an  opposition.  Trial  is currently scheduled for November 6, 2024.  PARTIES’S REQUESTS  Defendant  asks the Court for leave to submit tardy expert witness information.  Plaintiffs  ask the Court to deny the motion.  LEGAL STANDARD Code of Civil Procedure section 2034.300 provides:  “Except as  provided in Section 2034.310 and in Articles 4 (commencing with Section  2034.610) and 5 (commencing with Section 2034.710), on objection of any party  who has made a complete and timely compliance with Section 2034.260, the trial  court shall exclude from evidence the expert opinion of any witness that is  offered by any party who has unreasonably failed to do any of the following:  “(a) List  that witness as an expert under Section 2034.260.  “(b) Submit  an expert witness declaration.  “(c) Produce  reports and writings of expert witnesses under Section 2034.270.  “(d) Make  that expert available for a deposition under Article 3 (commencing with Section  2034.410).”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2034.300.)  Code of Civil Procedure section 2034.710  provides:   “(a) On  motion of any party who has failed to submit expert witness information on the  date specified in a demand for that exchange, the court may grant leave to  submit that information on a later date.  “(b) A motion  under subdivision (a) shall be made a sufficient time in advance of the time  limit for the completion of discovery under Chapter 8 (commencing with Section  2024.010) to permit the deposition of any expert to whom the motion relates to  be taken within that time limit. Under exceptional circumstances, the court may  permit the motion to be made at a later time.  “(c) The  motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section  2016.040.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2034.710.)            Code of  Civil Procedure section 2034.720 provides:  “The court  shall grant leave to submit tardy expert witness information only if all of the  following conditions are satisfied:  “(a) The  court has taken into account the extent to which the opposing party has relied  on the absence of a list of expert witnesses.  “(b) The  court has determined that any party opposing the motion will not be prejudiced  in maintaining that party’s action or defense on the merits.  “(c) The  court has determined that the moving party did all of the following:  “(1) Failed  to submit the information as the result of mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or  excusable neglect.  “(2) Sought  leave to submit the information promptly after learning of the mistake,  inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.  “(3) Promptly  thereafter served a copy of the proposed expert witness information described  in Section 2034.260 on all other parties who have appeared in the action.  “(d) The  order is conditioned on the moving party making the expert available  immediately for a deposition under Article 3 (commencing with Section  2034.410), and on any other terms as may be just, including, but not limited  to, leave to any party opposing the motion to designate additional expert  witnesses or to elicit additional opinions from those previously designated, a  continuance of the trial for a reasonable period of time, and the awarding of  costs and litigation expenses to any party opposing the motion.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2034.720.)  DISCUSSION  On  August 28, 2024, Plaintiffs served a demand for exchange of expert information  on Defendant.  Plaintiffs set September  17, 2024 as the exchange date.  On  September 17, 2024, Defendant served a designation of expert witness information listing retained expert Kenneth Ishizue, M.D., and non-retained experts.  The designation, however, did not include  counsel’s declaration under Code of Civil Procedure section 2034.260.  Defendant asserts that the failure to include  counsel’s declaration was the result of his counsel’s mistake and excusable  neglect.  On  September 18 or 20, 2024, Plaintiffs objected to Defendant’s September 17, 2024  designation as invalid and non-compliant.   (See Opposition p. 5.)  On  September 26, 2024, Defendant served an amended expert witness designation  which included counsel’s declaration.  The  amended designation listed retained expert Kenneth Ishizue, M.D., and one non-retained expert.  On September 30, 2024, Defendant filed this  motion, which includes a meet and confer declaration.  Plaintiffs  oppose the motion, arguing that Defendant has not satisfied the requirements of  Code of Civil Procedure section 2034.720.  The  Court finds that Defendant has satisfied the statutory requirements.  Defendant’s counsel failed to include a  declaration in the September 17, 2024 expert witness designation as the result of counsel’s  mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.  Defendant sought leave to submit the  information promptly after learning of the mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or  excusable neglect.  On September 26,  2024, Defendant promptly served a copy of the proposed expert witness information  on Plaintiffs.  The proposed expert  witness list designated the same retained expert (Dr. Ishizue) listed in Defendant’s  September 17, 2024 designation and narrowed the list of non-retained experts to  one witness.  Defendant has agreed to  make his expert immediately available for deposition.  The Court  has taken into account the extent to which Plaintiffs have relied on the  absence of a list of expert witnesses.  The  Court finds that Plaintiffs will not be prejudiced in maintaining their action  on the merits by an order granting Defendant’s motion.  The Court grants the motion.  CONCLUSION  The Court GRANTS Defendant  Noel Espinoza Torres’s motion for leave to submit tardy expert witness  information.  The order is conditioned on Defendant Noel  Espinoza Torres making his expert available immediately for deposition.  Defendant  Noel Espinoza Torres is ordered to serve a corrected expert designation within 5  days of the Court’s ruling.  Moving  party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.  Moving  party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court  within five days.
