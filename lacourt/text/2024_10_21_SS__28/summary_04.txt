And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the motions and oppositions presented in this case and has ruled as follows. The case involves a negligence and motor vehicle action filed by Plaintiffs Blanca Valle Dominguez and Nathaniel Tavares against Defendant Noel Espinoza Torres. The Defendant has filed a motion for leave to submit tardy expert witness information, which the Plaintiffs oppose. The judge finds that the Defendant's failure to include counsel's declaration in the expert witness designation was due to counsel's mistake and excusable neglect. The Defendant has since served a corrected expert witness designation and has agreed to make the expert available for deposition. The judge concludes that the Plaintiffs will not be prejudiced in maintaining their action on the merits and grants the Defendant's motion for leave to submit tardy expert witness information. The order is conditioned on the Defendant making the expert available for deposition and serving a corrected expert designation within five days of the ruling.
