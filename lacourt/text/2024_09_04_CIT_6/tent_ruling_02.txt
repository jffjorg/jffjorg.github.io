 Case Number:  22PSCV01124    Hearing Date:   September 4, 2024    Dept:  6 CASE  NAME:  Great  New World Equity LLC v. Zhou’s Investment & Management, Inc., dba The  Noodle  Plaintiff  Great New World Equity LLC’s Motion for Attorney’s Fees in the Amount of  $57,790.54 Against Defendant Zhou’s Investment & Management, Inc.  TENTATIVE  RULING  The Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion for attorney’s fees in the  reduced amount of $47,620.64.               Plaintiff is ordered to give notice  of the Court’s ruling within five calendar days of this order.  BACKGROUND  This is an unlawful detainer action. On September 29, 2022, plaintiff  Great New World Equity LLC (Plaintiff) filed this action against defendant Zhou’s  Investment & Management, Inc., dba The Noodle (Defendant), alleging the  sole cause of action for unlawful detainer. On April 29, 2024, following  Plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment, the Court entered judgment against  Defendant and in favor of Plaintiff.  On July 1, 2024, Plaintiff moved for attorney’s fees. On August  21, 2024, Defendant opposed the motion. On August 27, 2024, Plaintiff replied.  LEGAL  STANDARD “In any action on a contract, where the contract specifically  provides that attorney's fees and costs, which are incurred to enforce that  contract, shall be awarded either to one of the parties or to the prevailing  party, then the party who is determined to be the party prevailing on the  contract, whether he or she is the party specified in the contract or not,  shall be entitled to reasonable attorney's fees in addition to other costs.”  (Civ. Code, § 1717, subd. (a).) “A trial court assessing attorney fees begins with a touchstone or  lodestar figure, based on the ‘careful compilation of the time spent and  reasonable hourly compensation of each attorney… involved in the presentation  of the case.” (Christian Research Institute v. Alnor (2008) 165  Cal.App.4th 1315, 1321.) “The reasonableness of attorney fees is within the  discretion of the trial court, to be determined from a consideration of such  factors as the nature of the litigation, the complexity of the issues, the  experience and expertise of counsel and the amount of time involved.  [Citation.] The court may also consider whether the amount requested is based  upon unnecessary or duplicative work. [Citation.]” (Wilkerson v. Sullivan  (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 443, 448.) “The courts repeatedly have stated that the trial court is in the  best position to value the services rendered by the attorneys in his or her  courtroom [citation], and this includes the determination of the hourly rate  that will be used in the lodestar calculus.[Citation.]” (569 E. Cnty.  Boulevard LLC v. Backcountry Against the Dump, Inc. (2016) 6 Cal.App.5th  426, 436-437.) DISCUSSION Summary of Arguments  Plaintiff contends it is the prevailing party in this action and  therefore entitled to attorney fees because it obtained summary judgment and  the subject lease agreement provides for recovery of attorney fees to the  prevailing party. Plaintiff contends its requested attorney fees are reasonable  for this community based on Plaintiff’s counsel having between 20 and over 25  years of litigation experience, plus the application of a 15% discount to the  total bill, which reduced Plaintiff’s counsel’s respective hourly rates in this  matter to $446.25 for Mr. Robert A. Bailey and $429.25 for Mr. Gene Wu.  Plaintiff further addresses work performed for items that ultimately did not  materialize, such as the Mandatory Settlement Conference and the two motions to  compel discovery responses, mentioned certain entries that were written off, and  otherwise summarized the bulk of the work performed.  In opposition, Defendant contends Plaintiff’s request for attorney  fees is unreasonable, and contends various entries on the declaration of John  J. Ma, i.e. Plaintiff’s prior counsel are improper because they were block  billed, improperly lumped together work performed over multiple days, and that  one entry is impermissibly vague. Defendant also contends there were some  duplicative entries and some entries improperly charged to this case instead of  the other related civil case.  Analysis  The subject lease  agreement provides for the recovery of attorney fees here. (Wu Decl. (3/11/24),  Ex. 2, ¶ 32.4, italics added [“If either Landlord or Tenant should bring suit  against the other with respect to this Lease, including for unlawful  detainer… then all costs and expenses incurred by the prevailing party  therein (including… attorneys’ and other professional fees…), shall be  paid by the other party.”].) If a plaintiff obtains the relief requested on the  contract claims, the plaintiff is the prevailing party on the contract as a  matter of law. (Texas Commerce Bank v. Garamendi (1994) 28 Cal.App.4th  1234, 1247; Smith v. Krueger (1983) 150 Cal.App.3d 752, 757.) Here, Plaintiff  prevailed on its claim for unlawful detainer. Judgment was entered against  Defendant and in favor of Plaintiff. (Judgment (4/29/24).) Defendant does not  dispute that the subject lease agreement provides for the recovery of attorney  fees here, nor does Defendant dispute that Plaintiff is the prevailing party. (Sexton  v. Superior Court (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410; C. Opposing the  Motion—and Rebutting the Opposition, Cal. Prac. Guide Civ. Pro. Before Trial  Ch. 9(I)-C, ¶ 9:105.10; see also Moulton Niguel Water Dist. v.  Colombo (2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 1210, 1215 [“Contentions are waived  when a party fails to support them with reasoned argument and citations to  authority. [Citation.]”]) Thus, Plaintiff is the prevailing party on the subject lease agreement, and is  therefore entitled to attorney fees. (Civ. Code, § 1717, subd. (a); see Code  Civ. Proc.,  § 1033.5,  subd. (a)(10)(A).)  The Court also finds the rates of Plaintiff’s current  and former counsel to be reasonable. Typically, the reasonable hourly rate  used, “is that prevailing in the community for similar work.” (Center for  Biological Diversity v. County of San Bernardino (2010) 188 Cal.App.4th  603, 616.) The burden is on the party seeking attorney fees to prove their reasonableness.  (Id., at p. 615.) Plaintiff has met its burden by providing evidence of  its counsel’s experience. (Wu Decl., ¶¶ 3, 10, Ex. A to Ex. 1.) Mr. Ma, i.e.,  Plaintiff’s original counsel, indicates he has practiced law for almost 30  years in civil litigation, and that his hourly rate in this matter is $400.00  per hour. (Wu Decl., Ex. A to Ex. 1, ¶¶ 2-3.) Mr. Wu has practiced law for 20  years, while Mr. Bailey has practiced for over 25 years. (Wu Decl., ¶ 10,  subds. (a), (b).) Mr. Wu’s and Mr. Bailey’s effective rates in this action are  $429.25 and $446.25, respectively. (Id.) The Court finds Plaintiff’s  counsel’s rates are reasonable for comparable work in this community. (569  E. Cnty. Boulevard LLC v. Backcountry Against the Dump, Inc., supra, 6  Cal.App.5th at pp. 436-437.)  As for the billing entries that Defendant  disputes, the Court agrees with Defendant that the Mr. Ma’s fee bill contains some  issues. While a verified fee bill is prima facie evidence that the costs,  expenses, and services listed were reasonable, (Hadley v. Krepel (1985)  167 Cal.App.3d 677, 682), “[t]rial courts retain discretion to penalize block  billing when the practice prevents them from discerning which tasks are  compensable and which are not. [Citation.]”, (Heritage Pac. Fin., LLC v.  Monroy (2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 972, 1010). Almost every entry on Mr. Ma’s  fee bill is spread out over multiple days, even months in some cases. (Wu  Decl., Ex. A to Ex. 1.) Each entry describes multiple tasks lumped together.  (See Id.) Also, all of the time entries are exactly one hour or a  multiple of one hour, and contain no fractions of an hour, which the Court does  not find credible. (See Id.) Moreover, Mr. Ma appears to bill $1,600.00  for services related to the unlimited civil action. (Wu Decl., Ex. A to Ex. 1,  9/26/22 -10/5/22 entries of $1,200.00 and $400.00). Thus, the Court reduces Mr.  Ma’s bill by $1,600.00. Further, as a result of the block billing, the Court  exercises its discretion to further reduce Mr. Ma’s fee bill of $10,400.00 by  50% to $5,200.00.              As for the other  entries from Plaintiff’s current counsel, the Court agrees there appears to be  some overlap between the November 4, 2022 entry and the November 10, 2022 entry  regarding Mr. Wu’s review of the prior motion for summary judgment. (Wu Decl.,  Ex. 2, p. 13 of pdf.) But, this does not necessarily mean the tasks were  duplicative. The Court also finds Plaintiff’s counsel has shown where certain  matters involved both this unlawful detainer action and the related civil  action, Plaintiff’s counsel split the billing 50/50, so there is no improper  billing between the two cases. (Wu Decl., ¶ 6.) The Court therefore declines to  strike or reduce the other entries from Plaintiff’s current counsel and finds  the attorney’s fees of $40,461.39 to be reasonable.              In addition, the  Court will award 2 hours for the attorney’s preparation of this motion and 1  hour for the paralegal, and another 2 hours for the attorney’s review of the  opposition and preparation of the reply. With the 15% discount that comes to $1,959.25.  Plaintiff can include the motion filing fees in its memorandum of costs as  recoverable costs under Code of Civil Procedure Section 1033.5.              Based on the  foregoing, the Court GRANTS the motion for attorney’s fees in the reduced  amount of $47,620.64, awarding $5,200.00 to John J. Ma, Esq. and $42,420.64 to  Lagerlof, LLP.  CONCLUSION  The Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion for attorney’s fees in the  reduced amount of $47,620.64.               Plaintiff is ordered to give notice  of the Court’s ruling within five calendar days of this order.
