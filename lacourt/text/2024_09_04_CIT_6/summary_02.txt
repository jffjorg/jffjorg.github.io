And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge grants Plaintiff's motion for attorney's fees in the reduced amount of $47,620.64. The Plaintiff, Great New World Equity LLC, prevailed in the unlawful detainer action against Defendant, Zhou's Investment & Management, Inc., dba The Noodle, and is entitled to recover attorney's fees as provided in the subject lease agreement. The Judge finds that Plaintiff's counsel's rates are reasonable for comparable work in this community. However, the Judge reduces the fees of Plaintiff's former counsel, John J. Ma, by 50% due to block billing and impermissible vagueness. The Judge also awards additional fees for preparation and review of motions.
