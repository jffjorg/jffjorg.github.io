Background
 
This
action arises out of the purchase of several pieces of jewelry (the “Jewelry”)
through an online action. Plaintiff, Wolfgang Ziegler (“Plaintiff”), a German
national, purchased the  Jewelry sold by Defendants, Federal Government
Liquidation, Multi-Auction Services, and Hill Street Jewelers USA, Inc., as
well as its chief executive, George Molayem (collectively “Defendants”).
Between February 6 through 10, 2017, Plaintiff bid, and subsequently purchased,
the Jewelry from Defendants through an internet auction site operated by a
third party. On March 7, 2017, Plaintiff received the Jewelry and allegedly
suspected they were not of the advertised quality. Plaintiff alleges he had the
Jewelry appraised in Germany, and further alleges the appraiser found the
Jewelry to be of lower quality than represented. On March 20, 2017, Plaintiff
alleges he telephonically communicated with Defendants regarding the allegedly
deficient Jewelry, and return several items of the Jewelry for a refund.
However, Plaintiff alleges the Defendants refused to refund Plaintiff for the
two largest items of the Jewelry, and Plaintiff suffered damages as a
result.  
 
On
February 20, 2020, Plaintiff filed a Complaint alleging the following causes of
action: (1) violation of Business
& Professions Code § 17200, et seq.; (2) violation of
Consumer Legal Remedies Act, Civil Code, § 1750, et seq.; (3) breach of express
warranty; and (4) fraud. 
 
On
July 13, 2022, Plaintiff filed an amendment to complaint, naming George Molayem
(“Molayem”) as Doe 1. Proof of personal service on Defendant Molayem was filed
on August 15, 2022. Defendant Molayem filed an Answer on February 8, 2023. 
 
Defendant Molayem now
moves to quash his deposition notice and has filed a motion for judgment on the
pleadings. Plaintiff opposes both Motions. The matter was continued to allow
for supplemental briefing. 
 
motion to
quash deposition notice[1]
 
I.         Evidentiary Objections
 
Plaintiff’s Objections Nos. 1,
2, and 3 as to the Declaration of Stanley H. Kimmel are sustained due lack of
personal knowledge. Defendant Molayem must file a declaration attesting to his
medical condition and health impairments. 
 
III.      Discussion
Defendant Molayem moves to
quash service of the deposition notice under CCP § 425.410 on the basis that it
was emailed rather than served by mail. 
 
Defendant Molayem does not
dispute that CCP
§§ 1010.6(a), 1011(c), and 1013(g) permit service of deposition notice by email.
(See also CRC, rules 2.250 et seq.) While Defendant Molayem asserts that
no rule of court or local rule mandates acceptance by email, Defendant Molayem
fails to show that he can reject service on the basis that the deposition
notice was served by email. CCP § 1010.6(2) prohibits electronic service only
“[i]f a document is required to be served by certified or registered mail.” 
 
Section 1010.6(b)(2) further states: “A person represented by
counsel, who has appeared in an action or proceeding, shall accept electronic
service of a notice or document that may be served by mail, express mail,
overnight delivery, or facsimile transmission.” Pursuant to section
1010.6(b)(2), the deposition notice sent by email was valid because Defendant
Molayem is represented by counsel. 
 
While Defendant Molayem asserts that he never consented to
electronic service, he expressed affirmative consent “through electronic means
with the court or the court's electronic filing service provider, and
concurrently providing the party’s electronic address with that consent for the
purpose of receiving electronic service.” (CCP § 1010.16(c)(3)(ii).) The record
before the court reflects that Defendant Molayem has accepted electronic
service on five prior occasions. (See Proof of Service of Notice filed
07/14/2023; Proof of Service of Notice filed 10/13/2023; Proof of Service of
Notice filed 04/22/2024; Proof of Service of Notice filed 04/24/2024; Proof of
Service of Notice filed 07/18/2024.) 
 
Accordingly, Defendant Molayem fails to show that service by
mail of his deposition notice was required. 
 
Moreover, Defendant Molayem does not dispute that he served
his objections to the deposition notice by email. (Kimmel Decl., ¶ 15, Ex. 3;
Diecke Decl., ¶ 4, Ex. 3.) CCP § 2025.410 states: “If an objection is made
three calendar days before the deposition date, the objecting party shall make
personal service of that objection pursuant to Section 1011 on the party who
gave notice of the deposition.” As Defendant Molayem was required to serve his
objections to the deposition notice on Plaintiff by personal service rather
than by email, he waived any objections based on any error or irregularity in
the deposition notice. (CCP § 2025.410(a).) 
 
Finally, Defendant Molayem asserts that the deposition notice
should be quashed because discovery is closed, and Plaintiff has not moved to reopen
discovery. The court disagrees. 
 
On April 22, 2024, Plaintiff filed an ex parte
application seeking “a six-month continuance of the trial date currently set
for May 21, 2024, all related deadlines, and the Final Status Conference
currently set for May 14, 2024.” Despite receiving notice of the ex parte hearing
by email, Defendant Molayem did not oppose the ex parte and appeared at
the April 23, 2024 hearing wherein this court granted the ex parte: 
 
Pursuant
to the request of plaintiff, the Jury Trial (5 days) scheduled for 05/21/2024
is advanced to this date and continued to 01/07/2025 at 10:00 AM in Department
37 at Stanley Mosk Courthouse. 
 
All
deadlines are based on the new trial date. 
 
(Minute Order, dated 4/23/2024.) 
 
Defendant Molayem now asserts that because prior requests for
trial continuance orders expressly stated “Discovery is reopened to correspond
with the new trial date” the fact that the court extended all deadlines did not
mean that discovery was reopened. (Supp. Opp. Exs. 1-2.) 
 
CCP § 2024.020 states: 
 
(a)
Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, any party shall be entitled as a
matter of right to complete discovery proceedings on or before the 30th day,
and to have motions concerning discovery heard on or before the 15th day,
before the date initially set for the trial of the action.
 
(b)
Except as provided in Section 2024.050, a continuance or
postponement of the trial date does not operate to reopen discovery
proceedings.


(Ibid.) 
 
Defendant Molayem asserts that
discovery is closed and the deposition notice should be quashed 
because the court did not expressly state the discovery was
reopened and Plaintiff did not cite Section 2024.050 in his ex parte application,

 
In Pelton-Shepherd Industries, Inc. v. Delta Packaging Products,
Inc.
(2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 1568, the appellate court found that the trial court
erred in hearing Pelton-Shepard’s motion to compel because “the motion was not
heard before the discovery motion cutoff date and Pelton–Shepherd never moved
to reopen discovery.” (Id. at p. 1571.) Here, the discovery cutoff date
was Monday, April 22, 2024, since April 21, 2024 was a Sunday. (CCP § 12a, 12b;
see also SCT, (U.S.A.), Inc. v. Mitsui Manufacturers Bank (1984) 155
Cal.App.3d 1059, 1062, fn. 4.) Moreover, 15 days had not yet passed when the
court heard the ex parte on April, 23, 2024. Accordingly, discovery had
not yet closed when the court extended all deadlines. 
 
Even if Plaintiff was required to file a motion pursuant to
Section 2024.050, Defendant Molayem fails to show that the court did not
consider the relevant factors outlined in Section 2024.050. “Because the trial
court here did not require Pelton–Shepherd to file a motion to reopen discovery
under section 2024.050 before, or simultaneously with, filing its motion to
compel, there is no indication in the record that the court considered any of
the relevant factors.” 
 
Plaintiff’s ex parte application explained that
continuing the trial date and related deadlines was required because Defendant
delayed in responding to discovery requests and Plaintiff was unable to
participate in the set trial date due to injuries. (Ex Parte dated
04/22/2024 at p. 3.) In February 2024, Plaintiff learned that Defendant
Molayem’s counsel was suspended from practicing law and efforts to ascertain
who was representing Molayem went unanswered. (Id. at p. 4) On April 18,
2024, Plaintiff learned that Defendant’s counsel was again eligible to practice
law, but Defendant’s counsel remained unresponsive to Plaintiff’s request for
discovery. (Ibid.) These facts were sufficient for the court to determine
that Plaintiff was diligent in seeking discovery, moving for a new trial date,
and extending the related deadlines. The court also found that continuing the
trial date and related deadlines, including discovery, would not interfere with
the trial calendar or prejudice any party. (Id. at p. 6) Moreover, a six-month
extension would be sufficient for Plaintiff to recover and attend trial. (Ibid.)
 
Thus, although Plaintiff’s ex parte application did
not specifically cite Section 2024.050, the findings before the court support
the finding that discovery should be extended to coincide with the new trial
date. (See Luri v. Greenwald (2003) 107 Cal.App.4th 1119, 1125 [“An
omission in the notice may be overlooked if the supporting papers make clear
the grounds for the relief sought.”]; Sole Energy Co. v. Petrominerals Corp.
(2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 187, 193 [“‘The nature of a motion is determined by the
nature of the relief sought, not by the label attached to it. The law is not a
mere game of words.’”]; O&C Creditors Group, LLC v. Stephens &
Stephens XII, LLC (2019) 42 Cal.App.5th 546, 560 [“we do not find labels to
be dispositive and instead look at the substance of the motion . . .”].) 
 
Plaintiff also cites various cases wherein the discovery
cutoff date was extended due to a request for a new trial date: Diaz v.
Professional Community Management, Inc. (2017) 16 Cal.App.5th 1190, 1197
[ex parte application to continue trial granted; discovery cutoff and
trial-related deadlines extended based on new trial date]; Polibrid
Coatings, Inc. v. Superior Court (2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 920, 922 [same];
and Freedman v. Superior Court (2008) 166 Cal.App.4th 198, 206 [court
continued trial date and ex parte cutoff on its own motion].) 
 
Despite being present at the ex parte hearing,
Defendant Molayem did not oppose the ex parte application. Consequently,
the court granted the ex parte and extended the discovery cutoff date. Defendant
Molayem fails to show that the court erred in extending the discovery cutoff
date. (CCP § 128.) 
 
Defendant Molayem’s
motion to quash the deposition notice and stay the deposition is denied. 

 
motion for
judgment on the pleadings[2]
 
I.         Legal
Standard
“A motion for judgment on the pleadings performs the same
function as a general demurrer, and hence attacks only defects disclosed on the
face of the pleadings or by matters that can be judicially noticed.” (Burnett
v. Chimney Sweep (2004) 123 Cal.App.4th 1057, 1064.) “In deciding or
reviewing a judgment on the pleadings, all properly pleaded material facts are
deemed to be true, as well as all facts that may be implied or inferred from
those expressly alleged.” (Fire Ins. Exchange v. Superior Court (2004)
116 Cal.App.4th 446, 452.) When considering demurrers and judgment on the
pleadings, courts read the allegations liberally and in context. (Wilson v.
Transit Authority of City of Sacramento (1962) 199 Cal.App.2d 716, 720-21.)
A motion for judgment on the pleadings does not lie as to a portion of a cause
of action. (Id.) “In the case of either a demurrer or a motion for
judgment on the pleadings, leave to amend should be granted if there is any
reasonable possibility that the plaintiff can state a good cause of action.” (Gami
v. Mullikin Medical Ctr. (1993) 18 Cal.App.4th 870, 876.) A non-statutory
motion for judgment on the pleadings may be made any time before or during
trial. (Stoops v. Abbassi (2002) 100 Cal.App.4th 644, 650.)¿¿ 
II.        Discussion
Defendant Molayem has filed
this Motion for judgment on the pleadings on the basis that Plaintiff’s action
is time barred as the Complaint was filed on February 20, 2020, the Doe 1
amendment was not made until July 13, 2022 but Plaintiff had knowledge about
Defendant Molayem’s identity since February 2018 when the arbitrator noted that
documents filed in arbitration showed that payment was made c/o George Molayem.
(Motion at p. 2:6-7.) 
 
“Section 474 allows a plaintiff
who is ignorant of a defendant's identity to designate the defendant in a
complaint by a fictitious name (typically, as a “Doe”), and to amend the
pleading to state the defendant's true name when the plaintiff subsequently
discovers it.” (McClatchy v. Coblentz, Patch, Duffy & Bass, LLP (2016)
247 Cal.App.4th 368, 371.)  If a
plaintiff unreasonably delays in filing a doe amendment, they are barred from
making the amendment. (See A.N. v. County of Los Angeles (2009) 171
Cal.App.4th 1058, 1066.) If the Doe amendment is improper, the amendment cannot
relate back to the filing of the original complaint. (Fireman's Fund Ins.
Co. v. Sparks Construction, Inc. (2004) 114 Cal.App.4th 1135, 1143.) 
 
Defendant Molayem provides no
evidence to support the assertion that Plaintiff was made aware of Molayem’s
identity at the arbitration hearing in 2017. (Kimmel, ¶ 4.) However, the court
agrees that Paragraph 18 of the Complaint states that Plaintiff conducted an
“independent investigation” that revealed that Defendants “Federal Government
Liquidation, Multi-Auction Services, and Hill Street Jewelers” were “operated
by George Molayem from the same address(es) at 2057 and 2067 S. Atlantic
Boulevard, Commerce, California 90040-1348.” (Compl., ¶ 18.) Knowledge of these
facts lends credence to the fact Plaintiff was aware of Doe 1’s identity and
his connection to the other three Defendant entities at the time the Complaint
was filed. 
 
Plaintiff asserts that his
reference to Molayem was based only on “information and belief” as alleged in
Paragraph 18 and that the Doe 1 amendment was proper pursuant to CCP § 474.
(Compl., ¶ 18; Dieke Decl., ¶ 3.) Plaintiff fails to cite legal authority
showing that naming facts on information and belief negates any knowledge about
the defendant’s true identity and the facts giving rise to liability. While
affidavits cannot be based on “information and belief”, pleadings can be. (Star
Motor Imports, Inc. v. Superior Court (1979) 88 Cal.App.3d 201, 203 [“An
affidavit based on ‘information and belief’ is hearsay and must be
disregarded”].) A “ ‘[p]laintiff may allege on information and belief any
matters that are not within his personal knowledge if he has information
leading him to believe that the allegations are true.’” (Doe v. City of
Los Angeles (2007) 42 Cal.4th 531, 550 citing Pridonoff v.
Balokovich (1951) 36 Cal.2d 788, 792.) 
 
“The phrase ‘ignorant of the
name of a defendant’ is broadly interpreted to mean not only ignorant of the
defendant's identity, but also ignorant of the facts giving rise to a cause of
action against that defendant.” (San Diego Navy Broadway Complex Coalition
v. California Coastal Com. (2019) 40 Cal.App.5th 563, 579 citing Fuller
v. Tucker (2000) 84 Cal.App.4th 1163, 1170.) “[T]he correct test
[is]whether ‘the plaintiff is actually ignorant of the facts establishing a
cause of action.’”  (Hahn v. New York
Air Brake LLC (2022) 77 Cal.App.5th 895, 900 citing McClatchy, supra,
247 Cal.App.4th at p. 372.) 
 
Paragraph 18 of the Complaint
asserts that “further independent investigation reveals that these three
entities are all, upon information and belief, operated by George Molayem from
the same address(es) at 2057 and 2067 S. Atlantic Boulevard, Commerce, California
90040-1348 (adjacent properties).” (Compl., ¶ 18.) Accordingly, by pleading on
“information and belief” Plaintiff had information leading him to believe that
Molayem was the operator of the Defendant entities and was not ignorant of
these facts. 
 
The next question is whether
the fact Plaintiff Molayem was the operator of the three Defendant entities is
sufficient to have alleged a cause of action against Molayem at the time the
Complaint was filed. As Defendant Molayem is moving for judgment on the
pleadings, Molayem bears the burden of showing of that these two facts are
sufficient to assert a cause of action against him at the time the original
Complaint was filed such that the Section 474 amendment was improper. Defendant
Molayem fails to show how the fact that Plaintiff knew of Molayem’s existence
and the fact he operated the three Defendant entities was sufficient to state a
cause of action and name him as a Defendant at the time the Complaint was
filed. 
 
Defendant Molayem fails to meet
this burden. Therefore, the motion for judgment on the pleadings is denied. 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant
Molayem’s motion to quash the deposition notice and stay the deposition is
denied. The motion for judgment on the pleadings is denied.
