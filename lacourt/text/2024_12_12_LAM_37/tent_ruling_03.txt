Background
 
This action stems from a
contract dispute. On March 14, 2024, Adwizar, Inc. (“Plaintiff”) filed a
Complaint against Amina Sadiq (“Defendant”), alleging three causes of action:
1) breach of Contract; 2) Intentional Misrepresentation; and 3) Negligent
Misrepresentation. 
 
After the court vacated
the default entered against Defendant, Defendant filed a demurrer with a motion
to strike. Plaintiff opposes both Motions. The matter is now before the court. 
 
LEGAL STANDARDS
 
A.        Demurrer 
 
A demurrer is an
objection to a pleading, the grounds for which are apparent from either the
face of the complaint or a matter of which the court may take judicial notice.
(CCP § 430.30(a); see also Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.)¿“To
survive a demurrer, the complaint need only allege facts sufficient to state a
cause of action; each evidentiary fact that might eventually form part of the
plaintiff’s proof need not be alleged.”¿(C.A. v. William S. Hart Union High
School Dist. (2012) 53 Cal.4th 861, 872.)¿For the purpose of
testing the sufficiency of the cause of action, the demurrer admits the truth
of all material facts properly pleaded.¿ (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist. (1992)
2 Cal.4th 962, 966-967.)¿A demurrer “does not admit contentions, deductions or
conclusions of fact or law.”¿(Daar v. Yellow Cab Co. (1967) 67
Cal.2d 695, 713.)¿¿ 
 
B.        Motion to Strike 
 
¿Any party, within the time allowed to respond to a pleading
may serve and file a notice of motion to strike the whole or any part thereof.
(CCP § 435(b)(1); CRC, rule 3.1322(b).) The court may, upon a motion or at any
time in its discretion and upon terms it deems proper: (1) strike out any
irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading; or (2) strike
out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the
laws of California, a court rule, or an order of the court. (CCP, § 436(a)-(b);
Stafford v. Shultz (1954) 42 Cal.2d 767, 782 [“Matter in a pleading
which is not essential to the claim is surplusage; probative facts are
surplusage and may be stricken out or disregarded”].)¿¿¿¿ 
 
C.        Leave to Amend 
 
“Where the defect raised by a motion to strike or by demurrer
is reasonably capable of cure, leave to amend is routinely and liberally
granted to give the plaintiff a chance to cure the defect in question.” (CLD
Construction, Inc. v. City of San Ramon (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 1141, 1146.)
The burden is on the complainant to show the Court that a pleading can be
amended successfully. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.)¿¿¿ 
 
Demurrer[1]
 
The Complaint alleges that on
or about December 18, 2022, Plaintiff and Defendant entered into an Enrollment
Agreement for digital goods, services, and mentorship for the “Spectacular
Academy: SS7” package. (Compl., ¶ 5, Ex. A.) The Complaint alleges that
Defendant agreed to pay an initial deposit of $30,000, and pay the remaining
$70,000 by making payments of $10,000 a month. (Id., ¶ 10.) Defendant
paid with a credit card but later disputed all credit charges. (Id., ¶
18, Ex. B.) As a result, Plaintiff’s credit card processor, Quickbooks,
temporarily suspended Plaintiff’s ability to accept credit cards, thereby
harming Plaintiff’s business and the credit card dispute was resolved in
Defendant’s favor. (Ibid.) 
 
A.        First Cause of Action – Breach of
Contract
 
The elements of a
claim for breach of contract are: “(1) the existence of the contract, (2)
plaintiff’s performance or excuse for nonperformance, (3) defendant's breach,
and (4) the resulting damages to the plaintiff.” (Oasis West Realty, LLC v.
Goldman (2011) 51 Cal. 4th 811, 821.) In addition, the complaint must
demonstrate damages proximately caused by the breach. (St. Paul Ins. v.
American Dynasty (2002) 101 Cal.App.4th 1038, 1060.) Furthermore, “the
complaint must [also] indicate on its face whether the contract is written,
oral, or implied by conduct.” (Otworth v. Southern Pac. Transportation Co.
(1985) 166 Cal.App.3d 452, 458-59 citing CCP, § 430.10(g).)
 
“If the action is based on
alleged breach of written contract, the terms must be set out verbatim in the
body of the complaint or a copy of the written agreement must be attached and
incorporated by reference.” (Harris v. Rudin, Richman & Appel (1999)
74 Cal.App.4th 299, 308.) Alternatively, “a plaintiff may plead the legal
effect of the contract rather than its precise language.”¿ (Construction
Protective Services, Inc. v. TIG Specialty Ins. Co. (2002) 29 Cal.4th 189,
198-199.)¿¿“[A]ll essential elements of a breach of contract cause of action []
must be pleaded with specificity.”¿(Levy v. State Farm Mutual Automobile
Ins. Co. (2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 1, 5.)
 
Defendant asserts that
Plaintiff’s breach of contract fails because the Enrollment Agreement is
between Spectacular Academy and Defendant and not Plaintiff Adwizar Inc.
(Compl., Ex. A.) Plaintiff Adwizar states that the name “Adwizar” is referenced
in the Enrollment Agreement on page 3: 
 
The Liability by Adwizar Technologies, its employees,
agents, associates, successors, assigns, and legal representatives under this
Agreement is limited in direct proportion to the compensation paid to Company
under this Agreement, and shall not, under any condition, exceed the amount
already paid to Company at the time of any such claim, demand or cause of
action whatsoever . . .
 
(Compl., Ex. A.) 
 
While the Enrollment Agreement does reference Plaintiff
Adwizar, the referenced provision only limits Adwizar’s liability and does not
explain what its relationship is to Spectacular Academy or how Adwizar has
standing to enforce the contract on behalf of Spectacular Academy. 
 
Therefore, the demurrer to the first cause of action is
sustained with leave to amend. 
 
            B.        Second
Cause of Action – Intentional Misrepresentation
 
“The essential elements of a
count for intentional misrepresentation are (1) a misrepresentation, (2)
knowledge of falsity, (3) intent to induce reliance, (4) actual and
justifiable reliance, and (5) resulting damage.” (Chapman v. Skype Inc. (2013)
220 Cal.App.4th 217, 231.) “Each element of a fraud count must be pleaded with
particularity so as to apprise the defendant of the specific grounds for the
charge and enable the court to determine whether there is any basis for the
cause of action, although less specificity is required if the defendant would
likely have greater knowledge of the facts than the plaintiff.” ( Id. at
p. 231.) 


Defendant asserts that the
second cause of action is not pled with particularity. The Complaint alleges
that Defendant initially “agreed to pay an initial deposit of $30,000, and pay
the remaining $70,000 by making payments of $10,000 a month.” (Compl., ¶ 10.) 
 
Defendant represented that she
was facing financial hardship in February and October 2023, so Plaintiff paused
payments and allowed Defendant to continue participating in the program. (Id.,
¶¶ 11, 12.) However, Defendant “insisted that she could not afford to continue
paying for the program” and on October 30th, 2023, Defendant “disputed all of
the transactions with her credit card company, which total an amount of
$78,000[.]” (Id., ¶¶ 16, 18.) 
 
The court agrees that the
Complaint is unclear if Plaintiff’s agreement to pay the remaining balance in
$10,000 increments was part of the Enrollment Agreement or a subsequent
representation made after the Enrollment Agreement was signed. If the former, Plaintiff’s
tort claim is barred by the economic loss rule. Tort “claims are barred when
they arise from — or are not independent of — the parties’ underlying
contracts.” (Sheen v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2022) 12 Cal.5th 905,
923.) “A plaintiff may assert a tort claim for fraudulent concealment based on
conduct occurring in the course of a contractual relationship, if the elements
of the cause of action can be established independently of the parties'
contractual rights and obligations and the tortious  conduct exposes the plaintiff to a risk of
harm beyond the reasonable contemplation of the parties when they entered into
the agreement.” (Rattagan v. Uber Technologies, Inc. (2024) 17 Cal.5th
1, 38.) 
 
The Complaint further asserts
that Plaintiff falsely misrepresented that she had not received the
goods/services promised under the Enrollment Agreement and disputed the credit
card charges. (Compl., ¶¶ 20- 30.) The allegations in the Complaint lead to the
inference that Plaintiff’s reliance that Defendant would make the payments and
not dispute the credit card charges stems from the Enrollment Agreement, and
not from any additional misrepresentations made by Defendant. Accordingly,
Plaintiff fails “establish all elements of the tort independent of the rights
and duties assumed by the parties under the contract.” (Rattagan, supra,
17 Cal.5th at p. 38.) That Plaintiff promised to perform all her duties under
the Enrollment Agreement does not mean that her failure to perform gives rise
to a tort action for misrepresentation when the misrepresentation is
Plaintiff’s promise to pay per the Enrollment Agreement. 


Therefore, the demurrer to the
second cause of action is sustained with leave to amend. 
 
            C.        Third
Cause of Action – Negligent Misrepresentation 

 
“The elements of negligent
misrepresentation, a form of deceit, are misrepresentation of a past or
existing material fact, without reasonable ground for believing it to be true,
and with intent to induce another's reliance on the fact misrepresented;
ignorance of the truth and justifiable reliance on the misrepresentation by the
party to whom it was directed; and resulting damage.” (Home Budget Loans,
Inc. v. Jacoby & Meyers Law Offices (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 1277, 1285.)
Negligent misrepresentation must also be pled with particularity. (Chapman,
supra, 220 Cal.App.4th at p. 231.) Negligent
misrepresentation requires that the party owe a duty to disclose. (See Goonewardene
v. ADP, LLC (2019) 6 Cal.5th 817, 841; Levine v. Blue Shield of
California (2010) 189 Cal.App.4th 1117, 1136.)
 
Defendant again
asserts that the negligent misrepresentation cause of action is insufficiently
pled. The court finds that the negligent misrepresentation cause of action
suffers from the same deficiencies as the intentional misrepresentation cause
of action. Furthermore, Plaintiff fails to plead facts to show that Defendant
owed a duty to disclose. 
 
The demurrer is to
the third cause of action is sustained with leave to amend. 
 
Motion to Strike
 
Defendant moves to strike
Plaintiff’s request for punitive damages. As the demurrer is sustained, the
motion to strike is also granted with leave to amend. 
 
Conclusion
 
defendant’s
demurrer is sustained with leave to amend. The motion to strike is granted with

leave to amend. Plaintiff is granted 30
days leave to amend. The court sets the OSC RE: 
Amended Complaint for, and continues the
Case Management Conference to, January 21, 2025, 
at 8:30 a.m. Defendant to give notice.
