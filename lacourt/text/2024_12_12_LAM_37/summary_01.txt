Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied Defendant George Molayem's motion to quash the deposition notice and stay the deposition. The Judge also denied Defendant Molayem's motion for judgment on the pleadings, which argued that the complaint was time-barred.

The Judge found that Defendant Molayem failed to show that service by email of the deposition notice was invalid, and therefore, the deposition notice was valid. The Judge also extended the discovery cutoff date to coincide with the new trial date, which was granted to the Plaintiff.

Defendant Molayem argued that the Plaintiff was made aware of his identity at the arbitration hearing in 2017, but the Judge found no evidence to support this claim. The Judge also found that the Plaintiff's reference to Defendant Molayem's identity in the complaint was based on "information and belief" and was therefore proper.

The Judge concluded that Defendant Molayem failed to meet his burden of showing that the Plaintiff was ignorant of the facts giving rise to the cause of action against him at the time the complaint was filed, and therefore, the motion for judgment on the pleadings was denied.
