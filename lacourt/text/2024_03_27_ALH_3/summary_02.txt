And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case between Employee Retention Benefits, Inc. (Plaintiff) and Atlas Voluntary Benefits Financial & Insurance Solutions, Inc., et al. (Defendants). The issue is whether Plaintiff's motions to compel further discovery responses should be granted, and whether Defendants should be sanctioned for allegedly failing to meet and confer in good faith.

The judge concludes that Plaintiff's motions are denied as moot because Defendant's supplemental responses have been served. However, the judge considers the issue of monetary sanctions, finding that Plaintiff's failure to confer in a reasonable and good faith attempt at informal resolution warrants sanctions against Plaintiff and Plaintiff's counsel. The judge imposes sanctions in the amount of $8,000, payable within 20 days.

The judge also notes that Plaintiff's claim that Defendant's discovery responses were purposefully deficient is ineffective and irrelevant, and that Plaintiff's failure to follow up on its meet and confer letter undermines its claim that it made a good faith attempt to meet and confer.
