```

And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motions to quash subpoena and for sanctions. The motion to quash subpoena is denied, and the Revised Subpoena is allowed to proceed. The Judge concludes that the subpoena is not overbroad and that the parties have entered into a stipulated protective order that will limit the dissemination of any records produced. The Judge also notes that the range of documents sought by Gosdom has been substantially narrowed, and that the invasion to K. Deng's right to privacy is minimal relative to Gosdom's need for information to defend against this action and prosecute its cross-complaint.

The motion for sanctions is also denied. The Judge concludes that the cross-complaint is not frivolous and that Gosdom has a good faith argument for the claims it has asserted. The Judge notes that the sanctions motion relies on an obtuse interpretation of the cross-complaint, but that the Court does not have sufficient evidence to conclude at this time that it was brought primarily for an improper purpose.
