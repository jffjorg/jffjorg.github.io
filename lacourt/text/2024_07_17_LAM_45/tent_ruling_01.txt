Motion
to Set Aside Entry of Default and Default Judgment      
The Court
considered the moving papers.
            The
motion is DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE. 
 
Background
            On
December 13, 2020, Plaintiffs Carolyn W. Deal and Karen Jayne Deal filed their
Complaint. On January 21, 2024, Plaintiffs filed their First Amended Complaint
against Defendants alleging nine causes of action. 
            On
December 26, 2023, Defendant McHenry filed a Motion to Set Aside/Vacate Default
and or Default Judgment. 
            As
of July 16, 2023, no oppositions have been filed. 
 
Legal
Standard
            Under
Code of Civil Procedure section 473 (d), the default judgment must be vacated
for lack of personal jurisdiction.  Subdivision (d), provides that “[t]he
court ... may on¿motion¿of either party after notice to the other
party,¿set¿aside¿any void judgment or order.”  “A judgment void on its
face ... is subject to collateral attack at any time.” (Rochin v. Pat
Johnson Mfg. Co. (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 1228, 1239.)  This does not
hinge on evidence: A void judgment's invalidity appears on the¿face of the
record, including the proof of service.  (Morgan v. Clapp¿(1929)
207 Cal. 221, 224-225;¿Cruz v. Fagor America, Inc. (2007) 146
Cal.App.4th 488, 496.)  “[A] default¿judgment¿entered against a defendant
who has not been served with a summons in the manner prescribed by statute is
void.”  (Dill v. Berquist Construction Co.¿(1994) 24 Cal.App.4th
1426, 1444.)¿  
 
Discussion
            Procedural Deficiencies 
            As a preliminary manner, the Court
notes that Defendant McHenry has not provided Proof of Service and lists the
incorrect time on the Notice of Motion. Additionally, the case name does not
match the case number. Therefore, it is unclear whether Plaintiffs were
properly noticed.
 
            Therefore,
the Court denies the motion without prejudice. 
 
            It
is so ordered.
