And here is the summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling denies the motion of Defendant Richard Stanley McHenry Jr. to set aside the entry of default and default judgment without prejudice. The motion was filed on December 26, 2023, and no oppositions were filed. The judge notes that Defendant McHenry has not provided proof of service and lists the incorrect time on the notice of motion, making it unclear whether Plaintiffs were properly noticed. The judge also points out that the case name does not match the case number. The ruling is based on Code of Civil Procedure section 473(d), which provides that a default judgment must be vacated for lack of personal jurisdiction. The judge cites several court cases to support this ruling, including Rochin v. Pat Johnson Mfg. Co. (1998), Morgan v. Clapp (1929), Cruz v. Fagor America, Inc. (2007), and Dill v. Berquist Construction Co. (1994).
