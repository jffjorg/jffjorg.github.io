  vs.
 
MARIO A. FELIX
  dba EUROSPORT
 


 Case
  No.:  23STCV06780
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  May 29, 2024



 
 
 
            After
review, the Court has identified the following deficiencies with Plaintiff’s
default judgment packet:
 
-        
Plaintiff explains that the $66,000
figure is based on an auction of a similar year, model, mileage of the car on
the same day she purchased the vehicle. However, she does not attach any
evidence of this. Plaintiff must do so. Notably, the estimated values she did
attach ranged from $30,000-64,450. 
 
-        
Plaintiff still must submit title to
establish ownership over the vehicle.  None
of the documentation submitted establishes that Plaintiff owned the vehicle in
question.
