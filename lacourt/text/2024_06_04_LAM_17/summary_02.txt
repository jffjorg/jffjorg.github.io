And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the plaintiff's default judgment packet and has identified several deficiencies. The plaintiff must provide evidence to support her claim of $66,000, which is based on an auction of a similar vehicle. The estimated values attached to the packet ranged from $30,000 to $64,450. Additionally, the plaintiff must submit title to establish ownership of the vehicle. Currently, there is no documentation submitted to establish the plaintiff's ownership of the vehicle. The hearing is scheduled for June 4, 2024.
