And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to tax costs in part, striking $1,997.70 from the defendant's bill for a total costs award of $1,686.68. The defendant had claimed $3,684.38 in costs, but the judge has disallowed certain costs as not being reasonably necessary or reasonable in amount. The costs that were disallowed include photocopying costs, research costs, and mileage for court appearances. The judge has allowed some costs, including attorney service charges and electronic filing and service fees. The plaintiff, Christopher Y. Chong, had sued the defendant, Mardirossian Akaragian LLP, and others, alleging that the defendant had represented him in a personal injury suit and had recovered a settlement of approximately $6 million, but that the parties had disagreed about how the proceeds should be allocated. The judge's tentative ruling is based on the parties' arguments and the applicable laws and regulations.
