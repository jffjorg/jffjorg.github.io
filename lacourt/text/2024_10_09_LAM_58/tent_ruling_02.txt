Background
 
Plaintiff Christopher Y. Chong, by
power of attorney and through his attorney-in-fact, step-father Harry Sloan
(“Plaintiff”) sued defendants Mardirossian Akaragian LLP, Kroll Law
Corporation, Blue Shield of America, and American International Group, Inc. on
April 4, 2023, asserting a single claim for declaratory relief. Plaintiff
alleged Mardirossian Akaragian represented him on a contingency basis in a
personal injury suit where they recovered an approximate $6 million settlement.
A dispute arose about how the proceeds should be allocated, so Plaintiff sought
a declaration settling the dispute.
 
On July 31, 2024, the Court entered
judgment for Mardirossian Akaragian (“Defendant”) in the amount of approximately
$3.3 million, with Plaintiff to recover nothing.
 
Defendant filed a timely memorandum
of costs on August 15, 2024, its bill amounting to $3,684.38.
 
Plaintiff filed a timely motion to
tax Defendant’s costs bill on August 28, 2024. Defendant filed its opposition
on September 25, 2024. Plaintiff replied on September 30, 2024.
 
Legal Standard
 
“Except as
otherwise expressly provided by statute, a prevailing party is entitled as a
matter of right to recover costs in any action or proceeding.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1032(b).) 
 
A party claiming
costs must serve and file a memorandum of costs. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1700(a).) The opposing party may then contest the costs by filing a motion to
tax costs. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1034; Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1700(b).) “If
the items appearing in a cost bill appear to be proper charges, the burden is
on the party seeking to tax costs to show that they were not reasonable or
necessary. On the other hand, if the items are properly objected to, they are
put in issue and the burden of proof is on the party claiming them as costs.” (Ladas
v. California State Auto. Assn. (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761, 774.)

Costs and Objections
 
Defendant claims $1,255.00 in
filing and motion fees, $194.23 in electronic filing and service fees, and
$2,235.15 in “other” fees, which Defendant characterizes as costs for (1)
photocopies, (2) attorney service, (3) hearing transcripts, (4) research, and (5)
mileage.
 
Plaintiff moves to strike all costs
in Defendant’s $2,235.15 “Other” category.
 
                        1.
Photocopies
 
As to Defendant’s first
subcategory, “photocopies”: the Code expressly enumerates “photocopying
charges” as not allowable, “except for exhibits.” (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 1033.5(b)(3).) Because the charges appear improper on their face, it is
Defendant’s burden to justify them upon Plaintiff’s objection.
 
Defendant argues that because it
specifies the photocopies were of “court documents” and “subpoenaed records”,
they were necessary and should be allowed. The Court has no discretion to make
such an award; the discretion to award necessary costs only extends to costs
“not mentioned [elsewhere] in [section 1033.5] ... .” (Id., subd. (c)(4);
see also id., subd. (b) [enumerated costs not allowable “except when
expressly authorized by law”.)
 
The Court may not award
photocopying costs. The Court strikes $170.70 in photocopying costs from
Defendant’s memorandum.
 
            2.
Attorney Service
 
            Attorney
service charges are not expressly enumerated in section 1033.5. The Court may
award them at its discretion if they are reasonably necessary and reasonable in
amount. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5(c)(3).) Here, the Court finds they are.
The Court’s Department Guidelines instruct parties to submit courtesy copies. That
is sufficient for the costs to be reasonably necessary. And $237.45 in attorney
service costs is not unreasonable over the course of an entire litigation.
 
            Plaintiff’s
motion to tax is denied as to attorney service charges. These costs are
allowed.
 
                        3.
Hearing Transcripts
 
            As with photocopies,
section 1033.5(b) expressly disallows costs for “[t]ranscripts of court
proceedings not ordered by the court.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5(b)(5).) A
claim for hearing transcripts is not proper on its face, so it is Defendant’s
burden to justify it. In order to do so, they must show the transcripts were
ordered by the Court. They did not.
 
            The Court
strikes $158.75 from Defendant’s memorandum.

                        4.
Research
 
“Research” costs, which Defendant
identifies as “charges for legal research on Westlaw” (Feit Decl., ¶ 16), are
not expressly enumerated in section 1033.5. Because the costs do not appear
proper on their face, Defendant bears the burden to justify them. Counsel’s
testimony that legal research “[was] necessary to address the substantive legal
issues raised in this action” does not establish why these particular research
charges were necessary – or even related – to this action.
 
The Court strikes $1,498.25 from
Defendant’s memorandum.
 
            5.
Mileage for Court Appearances
 
            Mileage for
court appearances is not expressly awardable under section 1033.5(b). Because
they are not proper on their face, Defendant bears the burden to justify them
as reasonably necessary and reasonable in amount. (See Code Civ. Proc., §
1033.5(c)(2)-(3).) Defendant does not show the costs are necessary; it accuses Plaintiff
of failing to cite authority – which he does elsewhere in his moving papers –
and of bringing the litigation wrongfully in the first place. The justice or
injustice of the litigation itself does not bear on the reasonability of costs.
 
            The Court
strikes $170.00 from Defendant’s memorandum.
 
Conclusion
 
            The Court
grants Plaintiff’s motion in part, striking $1,997.70 from Defendant’s bill for
a total costs award of $1,686.68.
