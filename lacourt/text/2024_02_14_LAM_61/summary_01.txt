**Summary:**

The judge's tentative ruling denies KCS West, Inc.'s demurrer to Whisky Hotel, LLC's cross-complaint alleging induced breach of contract. The ruling holds that the cross-complaint adequately pleads the legal effect of the contract and that KCS West, Inc.'s conduct induced a breach of contract. The judge also denies KCS West, Inc.'s motion to strike portions of the cross-complaint, finding that allegations of KCS West, Inc.'s prior conduct on other projects are relevant to the case.
