 Case Number:  23STCP03188    Hearing Date:   February 1, 2024    Dept:  85 
7520 S. Broadway, LLC
v. County of Los Angeles 23STCP03188

Tentative decision on demurrer:
 overruled  



            
            Respondent County of Los Angeles
(“County”) demurs to the Petition filed by Petitioner 7520 S. Broadway, LLC
(“Broadway”). 
            The
court has read and considered the moving papers, opposition, and reply,[1] and
renders the following tentative decision. 
 
            A. Statement of the
Case
            1. Petition
            Petitioner
Broadway filed a Petition for administrative mandamus against Respondent County
on September 5, 2023.  The Petition
alleges in pertinent part as follows.
Broadway holds title to the real property and improvements
located at 7520 S. Broadway, Los Angeles, CA 90003 (the “Property”).  Pet., ¶1. 
Respondent County operates the Department of Public Health (“DPH”).  Pet., ¶2.
            On
August 3, 2022, DPH Inspector Maria Diaz Padilla (“Padilla”) inspected Units F
and G of the Property, as well as the exterior of the Property as part of a
“Routine Inspection.”  Pet, ¶3.  Padilla identified 30 “Non-Critical
Violations” in her “Official Inspection Report.”  Pet., ¶3. 
Reinspection was set for August 25, 2022.  Pet., ¶3.
            On
August 25, 2022, Inspector Padilla inspected the Property and issued a
“Official Inspection Report” confirming resolution of the 30 “Non-Critical
Violations” in the August 3, 2022 report. 
Pet., ¶4.  Padilla added three new
violations and set an inspection date of September 15, 2022.  Pet., ¶4.
            On
September 23, 2022, Inspector Padilla inspected the Property and closed the violations
from the August 25, 2022 inspection. 
Pet., ¶5.  Padilla added three
more violations and set a telephonic “Compliance Review” with Chief Inspector
Bria Nash on September 28, 2022 to discuss outstanding violations in Units F
and G.  Pet., ¶5.
            The
telephonic “Compliance Review” was held on September 28, 2022, and Chief
Inspector Nash indicated that the units at the Property had to be fumigated
monthly rather than four units per month. 
Pet., ¶6.  An inspection was
scheduled for October 14, 2022.  Pet.,
¶6.
            On
October 14, 2022, Inspector Padilla inspected the property and closed several
violations, leaving 12 non-critical violations pending and adding new
violations.  Pet., ¶8.  Padilla set an inspection date for October
18, 2022.  Pet., ¶8.
            On
October 18, 2022, Inspector Padilla inspected the Property and closed several
violations, leaving five violations pending, including new violations.  Pet., ¶9. 
Padilla set an inspection date for November 9, 2022.  Pet., ¶9. 

            On
October 24, 2022, Broadway spoke with DPH’s Chief Inspector Nash to address
concerns regarding Inspector Padilla’s approach to the inspection process.  Pet., ¶10. 
Broadway claimed that Padilla predetermined what new violations would be
included in the inspection report before the inspection began.  Pet., ¶10. 
Broadway asked that Padilla be replaced as the inspector for the
November 9, 2022 inspection.  Pet., ¶10.  DPH refused to replace Padilla but agreed to
assign another inspector to jointly inspect the property with Padilla on
October 27, 2022.  (Pet. 10.)
            On
October 27, 2022, Inspectors Padilla and Martinez arrived at the Property for an
inspection.  Pet., ¶11.  The Inspectors declined to inspect the units
because the tenants were absent.  Pet.,
¶11.  Broadway emailed Chief Inspector
Nash to complain that the inspection could have proceeded without the tenants
present and the inspectors’ refusal to proceed in the tenants’ absence
indicated a pattern of unfair conduct towards it and favoring tenants. Pet.,
¶11, Ex. 8.  Broadway voiced these same
concerns in an email sent on October 31, 2022. 
Pet., ¶12, Ex. 9.  
            In
response, Chief Inspector Nash set a new inspection date of November 10,
2022.  Pet., ¶12.  Nash indicated during a phone conversation
that DPH would accept photographs of completed work and close the inspection if
the tenants were not present on November 10, 2022.  Pet., ¶12, Ex. 9.  
            On
November 9, 2022, Nash advised Broadway that it would have to fumigate for
rodents, explaining that prior services were for roaches.  Pet., ¶13. 
Broadway responded by email to Nash and complained that the process
seemed pointless because DPH refused to accept and trust the reports of third-party
vendors.  Pet., ¶13.
            On
November 10, 2022, Inspectors Padilla and Martinez inspected the Property.  Pet., ¶15. 
Afterwards, DPH issued a report adding a new violation for rodents only,
clearing all other violations and providing a new inspection date of November
24, 2022.  Pet., ¶15, Ex. 11.  
            On
November 14, 2022, Broadway and DPH’s agents had a conference call.  Pet., ¶16. 
Broadway voiced concern over the method by which DPH’s inspectors were
conducting the inspections.  Pet.,
¶16.  Broadway also indicated that the
tenants had been planting evidence for the violations to keep the case file on
the Property open.  Pet., ¶16.  DPH’s agents indicated Broadway would have to
walk the property with the pest control company to determine potential paths of
rodent entry, have the pest company revisit the property to verify the work and
provide a clean report indicating there were no outstanding issues with rodent
entry.  Pet., ¶16, Ex. 12.  
            Broadway
complied with DPH’s orders regarding the rodent entry issues and all repairs
and pest control company inspections were completed on December 8, 2022.  Pet., ¶17. 
Broadway forwarded a completed report from Pest Innovations to DPH
Branch Director Contreras on December 13, 2022. 
Pet., ¶17, Ex. 13.  On December
21, 2022, Chief Inspector Nash requested more pictures of the work completed to
which Broadway complained on December 23, 2022. 
Pet., ¶18, Ex. 14.
            On
January 12, 2023, Inspectors Castillo and Nareh Derhartounyan inspected the Property.  Pet., ¶19. 
Although there were no rodents found, new violations were issued for rat
droppings not cleaned up by the tenants. 
Pet., ¶20.  A February 8, 2023 email
to Broadway scheduled an inspection for the next day, February 9, 2023.  Pet., ¶21. 

            On
February 9, 2023, Inspectors Castillo and Dehrartounyan inspected the premises.  Pet., ¶22. 
The violations for rodent droppings from the January 12, 2023 inspection
were closed.  Pet., ¶22.  A new violation for rodent droppings in a new
location in the unit was added and an inspection date was set for February 23,
2023.  Pet., ¶22, Ex. 9.  
            The
inspection was rescheduled for March 9, 2023 at Broadway’s request.  Pet., ¶¶23-27.  On March 9, 2023, Inspectors Carillo and
Jordan Teramae inspected the Property and all violations were closed except for
one based on a tenant complaint that there were roaches inside an electrical
outlet.  Pet., ¶27.  Another inspection was set for March 29, 2023
and later rescheduled for April 6, 2023. 
Pet., ¶27.
            On
April 6, 2023, Inspector Castillo and Vasquez inspected the Property and added
seven new violations.  Pet., ¶30.  An inspection was set for April 20,
2023.  Pet., ¶30.  The inspection was rescheduled for May 9,
2023. Pet., ¶31.
            On
May 9, 2023, Inspectors Castillo and Vasquez inspected the Property and added
more violations, including a damaged and removed screen door on the
balcony.  Pet., ¶31.  An inspection was scheduled for May 23, 2023
and rescheduled for June 6, 2023.  Pet.,
¶¶32-33.  Broadway asked that the
inspection be rescheduled, and DPH unilaterally set the inspection date for
July 25, 2023.  Pet., ¶34.  The inspection date was rescheduled for
August 15, 2023 by Inspector Castillo. 
Pet., ¶34.  
Broadway thereafter emailed DPH on August 3, 2023, objecting
to the fact that the inspection had been open for one year and yet DPH refused to
close the inspection.  Pet., ¶34.  Broadway also asked that the inspection date
be rescheduled.  Pet., ¶34.  
            Broadway
did not receive a response rescheduling the inspection date.  Pet., ¶37. Broadway’s agent awaited the DPH
inspectors at the Property on August 15, 2023. 
Pet., ¶37.  No agent appeared.  Pet., ¶38.
            On
August 23, 2023, Broadway emailed DPH, objecting to the failure of its inspectors
to maintain neutrality in inspecting the Property.  Pet., ¶38. 
Broadway also alleged that the tenants were sabotaging the inspections
to keep the DPH file open on the Property. 
Broadway requested a meeting regarding the DPH file on the
Property.  In response, DPH’s Manager,
Tsiebos, threatened an enforcement action against Broadway if the violations
set forth in the May 9, 2023 inspection report remained unresolved.  Pet., ¶38, Ex. 32.  
After this threatened enforcement action, Broadway filed the
Petition on September 5, 2023.        
 
            b.
Prayer for Relief
            Petitioner
Broadway asks that a writ of mandate issue pursuant to CCP §1094.5 compelling
Respondent County to vacate the Notice and Order to Comply of August 3,
2022.  Broadway also asks the court to stay
any further action by County regarding the Property pending adjudication of
this matter.  Broadway seeks an award of fees
and costs pursuant to CCP section 1021.5. 

 
            2.
Course of Proceedings
            On
September 14, 2023, Petitioner served Respondent County with the Petition.  
            
            B. Governing Law
1.  Revenue and
Taxation Code §§17274 and 24436.5 
“[N]o deduction shall be allowed for interest, taxes,
depreciation, or amortization paid or incurred in the taxable year with respect
to substandard housing located in this state,” with the exception of “deductions
from income derived from property rendered substandard solely by reason of a
change in applicable state or local housing standards, unless the violations
cause substantial danger to the occupants of the property.”  Revenue & Taxation (“R&T”) Code §§17274(a),
24436.5(a).  
“Substandard housing” is defined as “occupied dwellings from
which the taxpayer derives rental income or unoccupied or abandoned dwellings
for which both of the following apply: 
(1) Either of the following occurs: 
(A) For occupied dwellings from which the taxpayer derives rental
income, a state or local government regulatory agency has determined that the
housing violates state law or local codes dealing with health, safety, or
building…(2) Either of the following occurs: 
(A) After written notice of violation by the regulatory agency,
specifying the applicability of this section, the housing has not been brought
to a condition of compliance within six months after the date of the notice or
the time prescribed in the notice, whichever period is later.”  R&T Code  §§17274(b), 24436.5(b).  
When the six-month period to comply under R&T Code
§§17274(b) and 24436.5(b) expires without compliance, “the government the
government regulatory agency shall mail to the taxpayer a notice of
noncompliance. The notice of noncompliance shall be in a form and shall include
information prescribed by the Franchise Tax Board, shall be mailed by certified
mail to the taxpayer at his or her last known address, and shall advise the
taxpayer of (A) an intent to notify the Franchise Tax Board of the
noncompliance within 10 days unless an appeal is filed, (B) where an appeal may
be filed, and (C) a general description of the tax consequences of that filing
with the Franchise Tax Board.  Appeals
shall be made to the same body and in the same manner as appeals from other
actions of the regulatory agency. If no appeal is made within ten days or if
after disposition of the appeal the regulatory agency is sustained, the
regulatory agency shall notify, in writing, the Franchise Tax Board of the
noncompliance.”  R&T Code. §§17274(c)(1)
and 24436.5(c)(1).  
 
C. Demurrers
Demurrers are permitted in
administrative mandate proceedings.  CCP §§1108, 1109.  A demurrer
tests the legal sufficiency of the pleading alone and will be sustained where
the pleading is defective on its face. 
            Where
pleadings are defective, a party may raise the defect by way of a demurrer or
motion to strike or by motion for judgment on the pleadings.  CCP
§430.30(a); Coyne v. Krempels, (1950) 36 Cal.2d 257.  The party
against whom a complaint or cross-complaint has been filed may object by
demurrer or answer to the pleading.  CCP §430.10.  A demurrer is
timely filed within the 30-day period after service of the complaint.  CCP
§430.40; Skrbina v. Fleming Companies, (1996) 45 Cal.App.4th 1353,
1364. 
            A demurrer
may be asserted on any one or more of the following grounds: (a) The court has
no jurisdiction of the subject of the cause of action alleged in the pleading;
(b) The person who filed the pleading does not have legal capacity to sue; (c)
There is another action pending between the same parties on the same cause of
action; (d) There is a defect or misjoinder of parties; (e) The pleading does
not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action; (f) The pleading is
uncertain; (g) In an action founded on a contract, it cannot be ascertained
from the pleading whether the contract is written, is oral, or is implied by
conduct; (h) No certificate was filed as required by CCP sections 411.35 or
411.36.  CCP §430.10.  
A demurrer tests the
sufficiency of a pleading, and the grounds for a demurrer must appear on the
face of the pleading or from judicially noticeable matters.  CCP
§430.30(a); Blank v. Kirwan, (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.  The face
of the pleading includes attachments and incorporations by reference (Frantz
v. Blackwell, (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 91, 94), but it does not include
inadmissible hearsay.  Day v. Sharp, (1975) 50 Cal.App.3d 904,
914.   
            The sole
issue on demurrer for failure to state a cause of action is whether the facts
pleaded, if true, would entitle the plaintiff to relief.  Garcetti v.
Superior Court, (1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 1533, 1547; Limandri v. Judkins,
(1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 326, 339.  The question of plaintiff’s ability to
prove the allegations of the complaint or the possible difficulty in making
such proof does not concern the reviewing court.  Quelimane Co. v.
Stewart Title Guaranty Co., (1998) 19 Cal.4th 26, 47.  
The ultimate facts alleged
in the complaint must be deemed true, as well as all facts that may be implied
or inferred from those expressly alleged.  Marshall v. Gibson, Dunn
& Crutcher, (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1397, 1403.  This rule does not
apply to allegations expressing mere conclusions of law, or allegations
contradicted by the exhibits to the complaint or by matters of which judicial
notice may be taken.  Vance v. Villa Park Mobilehome
Estates, (“Vance”) (1995) 36 Cal.App.4th 698, 709. 
            For all
demurrers filed after January 1, 2016, the demurring party must meet and confer
in person or by telephone with the party who filed the pleading for the purpose
of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the
objections to be raised in the demurrer.  CCP §430.31(a).  As part of
the meet and confer process, the demurring party must identify all of the
specific causes of action that it believes are subject to demurrer and provide
legal support for the claimed deficiencies.  CCP §430.31(a)(1).  The
party who filed the pleading must in turn provide legal support for its
position that the pleading is legally sufficient or, in the alternative, how
the complaint, cross-complaint, or answer could be amended to cure any legal insufficiency. 
Id.  The demurring party is responsible for filing and serving a
declaration that the meet and confer requirement has been met.  CCP
§430.31(a)(3).
            “[A]
demurrer based on a statute of limitations will not lie where the action may
be, but is not necessarily, barred. [Citation.] In order for the bar of the
statute of limitations to be raised by demurrer, the defect must clearly and
affirmatively appear on the face of the complaint; it is not enough that the
complaint shows that the action may be barred.” State ex rel. Metz v. CCC
Information Services, Inc., (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 402, 413.
            If a demurrer is
sustained, the court may grant leave to amend the pleading upon any terms as
may be just and shall fix the time within which the amendment or amended
pleading shall be filed.  CCP §472a(c). 
However, in response to a demurrer and prior to the case being at issue,
a complaint or cross-complaint shall not be amended more than three times,
absent an offer to the trial court as to such additional facts to be pleaded
that there is a reasonable possibility the defect can be cured to state a cause
of action.  CCP §430.41(e)(1).
 
            D. Analysis
            Respondent
County demurs to the Petition on the basis that (1) the court lacks subject
matter jurisdiction because Petitioner Broadway failed to exhaust its administrative
remedies, and (2) the Petition requests inappropriate relief by asking that
Respondent’s DPH refrain from enforcing the Los Angeles County Health Code.
 
            1.
Meet and Confer   
            Respondent
County met and conferred with Broadway’s counsel via email after Petitioner
failed to respond to a voicemail.  Jensen
Dec., ¶2.  Broadway’s counsel indicated that
it would seek a decision from the court on the County’s demurrer.  Jensen, Dec., ¶2.  
 
            2. Exhaustion
of Administrative Remedies
            A writ of
mandate will only issue when the petitioner has no plain, speedy, or adequate
remedy at law.  CCP §1086.  As a general rule, a court will not issue a
writ of mandate unless a petitioner has first exhausted its available
administrative remedies.  See, e.g.,
Alta Loma School Dist. v. San Bernardino County Com. On School Dist.
Reorganization, (1981) 124 Cal.App.3d 542, 554.  Under this rule, an administrative remedy is
exhausted only upon termination of all available, non-duplicative
administrative review procedures.  Coachella
Valley Mosquito & Vector Control Dist. v. California Public Employment
Relations Bd., (2005) 35 Cal.4th 1072, 1080.  The exhaustion doctrine contemplates that the
real issues in controversy be presented to the administrative body, which must
be given the opportunity to apply its special expertise to correct any errors
and reach a final decision, thereby saving the already overworked courts from
intervening into an administrative dispute unless absolutely necessary.  Farmers Ins. Exchange v. Superior Court,
(1992) 2 Cal.4th 377, 391.
            The exhaustion doctrine has been
described as “a jurisdictional prerequisite to resort to the courts.”  Abelleira v. District Court of Appeal,
(1941) 17 Cal.2d 280, 293.  The
exhaustion doctrine contemplates that the real issues in controversy be
presented to the administrative body, which must be given the opportunity to
apply its special expertise to correct any errors and reach a final decision,
thereby saving the already overworked courts from intervening into an
administrative dispute unless absolutely necessary.  Farmers Ins. Exchange v. Superior Court,
(1992) 2 Cal.4th 377, 391.  
The failure to
allege exhaustion of administrative remedies or facts excusing the failure to
exhaust renders the petition subject to demurrer for failure to state a cause
of action.  See, e.g., Stenocord
Corp. v. City & County of San Francisco, (1970) 2 Cal.3d 984, 990.  A mere allegation that petitioners have
exhausted their administrative remedies has been held to be conclusory and
insufficient to survive demurrer.  Pan
Pacific Property v. County of Santa Cruz, (1978) 81 Cal.App.3d 244, 251; Lund
v. Ca. State Employees Assn., (1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 174, 182-83.  On the other hand, such an allegation has
also been held sufficient to survive demurrer. 
Wong v. Regents of University of California, (1971) 15 Cal.App.3d
823, 829.  Therefore, the court has
discretion in determining whether the allegation is adequate.  
            County demurs on the
grounds that Broadway failed to exhaust administrative remedies.  County argues that the Petition does not
allege that it has complied with the appeals process set forth in R&T Code
sections 17274 and 24436.5.  Dem. at 7-8.  County’s demurrer is not well taken for
several reasons.
First, the Petition
alleges exhaustion of administrative remedies as follows: “Petitioner has
exhausted its administrative remedies required to be pursued by requesting a
hearing on the Notice(s) and Order(s); which was cancelled by Respondent.”  Pet., ¶43. 
This allegation is not a bare allegation of exhaustion; it alleges that Broadway
requested a hearing on the multiple Notices of Violation, which County cancelled.  Although the Petition does not allege a
specific County code or regulation authorizing a hearing, it is sufficient to
allege that a hearing was demanded and refused.
            Second, R&T Code sections
27374 and 24436.5 pertain to the denial of tax deductions for substandard
housing.  R&T Code section 24436.5(c)(1)
provides that a regulatory agency shall notify the taxpayer of non-compliance, the
agency’s intent to notify the Franchise Tax Board (“FTB”) of the same unless
there is an appeal, and where an appeal will be filled.  The subject matter of this appeal process is
tax deductions, not a local agency’s finding of substandard housing, and it is not
at all clear that an appeal must be exhausted to dispute DPH’s Notice and Order
to Comply of August 3, 2022.  
Third, County points to no appeal procedure established by
ordinance or rule that it makes available for either a substandard housing
determination or a Notice and Order to Comply. 
Nor did County give notice to Broadway of an appeal procedure as
required by R&T Code section 24436.5(c)(1). 
The notices to Broadway in DPH’s inspection reports merely stated that
the six-month clock in R&T Code sections 1274 and 23336.5 had started and
that FTB would be notified: 
 
“Section
17274 and 24436.5 of the State Revenue and Taxation code provide, in part, that
a taxpayer, who derives rental income from housing determined by the local
regulatory agency to be substandard by reason of violation of State or local
codes dealing with health, safety, or building, cannot deduct from State
personal income tax and bank and corporation income tax, deductions for
interest, depreciation or taxes attributable to such substandard structure
where the substandard conditions are not corrected within six (6) months after
notice of violation by the regulatory agency. 
THE DATE OF THIS NOTICE MARKS THE BEGINNING OF THAT SIX-MONTH
PERIOD.  The Department is required by law
to notify the Franchise Tax Board of failure to comply with these code
sections.”  Pet., Ex. 1, p. 2; Ex. 2, p.
2; Ex. 3, p. 3; Ex. 6, p. 2; Ex. 11, p. 2; Ex. 16, p. 2; Ex. 19, p. 2; Ex. 22,
p. 2; Ex. 25, p. 2 and Ex. 26, p. 3.  
 
Fourth, County relies on inadmissible evidence.  County argues that it sent Broadway a Notice of
Intent to Notify Franchise Tax Board of non-compliance pursuant to R&T Code
sections 17274 and 24436.5 on October 24, 2023. 
Dem. at 8-9.  The October 24, 2023
notice informed Broadway that DPH would notify the FTB of noncompliance unless
a Notice of Appeal was received within 15 days. 
Dem. at 9; Jensen Decl., ¶3.  An
extension was purportedly granted on November 14, 2023.  Jensen Decl., ¶3.  These facts do not appear on the face of the
Petition or its exhibits.  Jensen’s
declaration is extrinsic evidence that may not be considered on demurrer. Blank v. Kirwan, supra, 39 Cal.3d at 318. 

County fails to show that Broadway has not exhausted its administrative
remedies.
 
            b.  Propriety of Relief Requested
County also argues the Petition fails to state a claim for
administrative mandate because the requested relief would require it to refrain
from enforcing the law.  County argues it
is entitled under Article XI, Section 7 of the California Constitution to
promulgate and enforce its ordinances and regulations, including sanitation
ordinances.  Cal. Const., Art. XI, § 7, (“A
county or city may make and enforce within its limits all local, police,
sanitary, and other ordinances and regulations not in conflict with general
laws.”)  Broadway admits there are still violations
that have not yet been cured (Pet., Ex. 26) and the request for a writ of mandamus
requiring closure of the DPH file on the Property would require County to refrain
from enforcing the law.
Broadway does not respond to County’s argument that the
requested relief is improper.  In any
event, County’s argument is not both procedurally improper and not well
taken.  When there is a defect in a
pleading’s prayer, the opposing party’s proper remedy is a motion to strike,
not a demurrer.  This is particularly
true because the Petition seeks both a writ of mandate compelling County to
vacate the Notice and Order to Comply of August 3, 2022 and a stay of any
further action by County.  
County also misstates the grounds for the second relief.  The Petition contends that DPH created and is
maintaining an open file on the Property in violation of the law.  Since there are no actual violations at the
Property, Broadway seeks a stay of further DPH action.  This relief would not prevent County from
enforcing the law against legitimate violations unless future violations arose.
 
            D. Conclusion
            The
demurrer to the Petition is overruled.  County
is ordered to file an answer only in 20 days.
