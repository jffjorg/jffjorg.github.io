And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the matter and is inclined to dismiss the plaintiff's (NCD) claims for declaratory relief and administrative mandamus. The judge finds that the City Council was the final decision-maker and had authority to make Housing Accountability Act (HAA) findings. The judge also notes that the Department Director was not vested with authority to adopt findings necessary for rejecting a project under the HAA.

The judge finds that NCD failed to abide by the requirement to summarize both favorable and unfavorable evidence on the point of sufficiency of evidence. The judge also rejects NCD's arguments that the City rejected the application in bad faith and that the HAA authorizes the court to order the City to approve the Project.

The judge concludes that the City's rejection of the application was not arbitrary and capricious and that the City had authority to make the findings it did. The judge also finds that the Housing Element Law requires rezoning deadline penalty for late adoption and that the City's coastal areas exemption is legally supported.
