Significant Statements: 
- "A writ of mandate will only issue when the petitioner has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy at law."

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has ruled that the County's demurrer to the Petition is overruled. The County had argued that the Petition failed to exhaust administrative remedies and that the requested relief was improper. The judge found that the Petition adequately alleged exhaustion of administrative remedies and that the requested relief was not improper. The judge ordered the County to file an answer to the Petition within 20 days.
