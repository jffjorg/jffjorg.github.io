**Significant Statements**
```
The Housing Accountability Act is designed to promote the approval of housing projects and to prevent local governments from denying projects based on subjective development policies.
A local agency shall not disapprove a housing development project if it is in compliance with applicable objective general plan, zoning, and subdivision standards.
The builder's remedy provision of the HAA allows for the approval of housing projects even if they are inconsistent with the general plan and zoning.
The City's rejection of the project was arbitrary and capricious and did not comply with the HAA.
