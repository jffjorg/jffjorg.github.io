```

The judge's tentative ruling is based on the information presented before the court, including the breach of contract case, the filing of the initial complaint and the FAC, the withdrawal of the FAC, and the request for entry of default judgment. The ruling denies the plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment due to several issues, including the lack of proof of service of the FAC on the defendant, the attempted withdrawal of the FAC without authority, and the unclear status of the defendant's receipt of the FAC. The ruling requires the plaintiff to serve the defendant with the FAC and give the defendant 30 days to respond before a default can be entered.
