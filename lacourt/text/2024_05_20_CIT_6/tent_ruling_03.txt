 Case Number:  23PSCV03308    Hearing Date:   May 20, 2024    Dept:  6 Plaintiff
SGV, LLC’s Request for Entry of Default Judgment 
Defendant: Raul Castro 
COURT RULING           
Plaintiff’s request for entry of
default judgment is DENIED.           
BACKGROUND           
            This
is a breach of contract case. On October 25, 2023, plaintiff SGV, LLC
(Plaintiff) filed this action against defendant Raul Castro (Defendant) and
Does 1 through 10, alleging causes of action for common counts, breach of
contract, and unjust enrichment. On January 18, 2024, Plaintiff filed a First
Amended Complaint (FAC) against the Defendant and Does 1 through 10 for the
same causes of action. On March 4, 2024, Plaintiff filed a notice of withdrawal
of the FAC. On March 19, 2024, Plaintiff filed a request for entry of default
judgment package. Default was entered on the same day.           
LEGAL
STANDARD 
Code of
Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a party
has failed to timely respond or appear. (Code Civ. Proc., § 585.) A party
seeking judgment on the default by the court must file a Request for Court
Judgment, and: (1) a brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other
admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested; (3) interest
computations as necessary; (4) a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a
proposed form of judgment; (6) a dismissal of all parties against whom judgment
is not sought or an application for separate judgment under Code of Civil
Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; (7)
exhibits as necessary; and (8) a request for attorneys’ fees if allowed by
statute or by the agreement of the parties. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1800.) 
ANALYSIS 
Plaintiff
seeks default judgment against Defendants in the total amount of $36,296.14, including
$28,473.00 in damages, $5,834.40 in interest, $1,244.19 in attorney fees, and $744.55
in costs. The Court finds some problems with Plaintiff’s request for entry of
default judgment. First, the operative pleading here is the FAC, despite
Plaintiff’s efforts to withdraw it. (Notice of Withdrawal of First Amended
complaint (3/4/24).) When a plaintiff amends a complaint, the "amended
complaint supersedes the original complaint and thereafter the original
complaint performs no function as a pleading." (Darsie v. Darsie
(1942) 49 Cal.App.2d 491, 493-494.) Indeed, an amended pleading supersedes the
prior pleading. (Foreman & Clark Corp. v. Fallon (1971) 3 Cal.3d
875, 884.) Thus, the original complaint is now void, and cannot form the basis
for Plaintiff’s default judgment request. (See Id.) 
Second, Plaintiff
has not filed a proof of service of the FAC on Defendant. It is therefore
unclear if Plaintiff served the FAC on Defendant. It is also unclear how
default was even entered without such proof of service. (See Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 1.21, subd. (b); Id., rule 3.110, subd. (b).) Although Plaintiff
attempted to withdraw the FAC, it is not clear under what authority Plaintiff
can do so on its own. Further, Plaintiff served the notice of withdrawal on
Defendant, but it is unclear whether Plaintiff had ever served Defendant with
the FAC. Plaintiff’s actions likely have left the Defendant confused. Since the
FAC is still the operative pleading in the Court’s records, Plaintiff must serve
Defendant with the FAC and give him 30 days to respond before a default can be
entered on the operative FAC. 
CONCLUSION           
            Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s request
for entry of default judgment is DENIED.
