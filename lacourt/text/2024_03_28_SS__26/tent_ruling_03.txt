ANALYSIS:
 
On August 14, 2023, Plaintiff
California Unique Security Services, Inc. (“Plaintiff”)
filed this action for conversion and common count for money against Defendant
Carlos Rezabala (“Defendant”). On November 27, 2023, Defendant filed the
instant Demurrer to the Complaint (styled as a “Motion to Dismiss”). The
Demurrer came for hearing on January 11, 2024, at which time the Court noted
that it was not accompanied by a proof of service demonstrating service of the
moving papers and notice of hearing on Plaintiff. (Minute Order, 01/11/24.) Nor
was the Demurrer accompanied by a meet and confer declaration as required by
Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41. (Ibid.) The Court continued the
hearing date to allow Defendant to file proof of service of the moving papers
and notice of hearing date, and the file and serve a meet and confer
declaration. (Ibid.) To date, no papers have been filed by Defendant as
ordered. Accordingly, the Court strikes the Demurrer pursuant to its inherent
authority under Code of Civil Procedure section 436, subdivision (b).
