TENTATIVE RULING:
 
            
Plaintiff Richard Heng Taing dba
USA Donuts’ Motion to Compel Responses to Special Interrogatories and Request
for Sanctions is GRANTED. DEFENDANT
WORLDWIDE ATM, INC. IS TO SERVE VERIFIED RESPONSES TO THE DISCOVERY REQUESTS,

TO PLAINTIFF’S COUNSEL WITHIN 20 DAYS’

ANALYSIS:
 
On November 3, 2023, Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant Richard Heng
Taing DBA USA Donuts (“Plaintiff”) served Special Interrogatories, Set One, on
Defendant/Cross-Complainant Worldwide ATM, Inc. (“Defendant”). (Motion, Gentino Decl., Exh. 1.) As of the
filing of this Motion, Defendant has not served responses. (Id. at ¶1.)
Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to Compel Responses to Special
Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for Sanctions, on March 4, 2024. No
opposition has been filed to date.
 
There is no requirement for a prior meet and confer effort
before a motion to compel initial responses can be filed. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290.) Further, the motion can be brought any time after the responding
party fails to provide the responses. 
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290.) Based on Defendant’s failure to respond
to the propounded discovery, Plaintiff is entitled to an order compelling it to
serve verified responses to the discovery requests without objections. 
 
Defendant’s failure to timely respond constitutes a misuse
of the discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d).) Sanctions
are appropriate under Code of Civil Procedure sections 2023.010 and 2023.030
and have been properly noticed. Plaintiff’s request for
monetary sanctions, however, is excessive given this straightforward and
unopposed motion. Under a lodestar calculation, sanctions are granted in the
amount of $718.91 based on one hour of attorney time billed at $650.00 per hour
and $68.91 in costs. (Motion, Gentino Decl., ¶2.)
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff Richard Heng Taing dba USA Donuts’ Motion to
Compel Responses to Special Interrogatories and Request for Sanctions is
GRANTED. DEFENDANT WORLDWIDE ATM, INC.
IS TO SERVE VERIFIED RESPONSES TO THE DISCOVERY REQUESTS, WITHOUT OBJECTIONS,
WITHIN 20 DAYS’ NOTICE OF THIS ORDER. DEFENDANT IS ALSO ORDERED TO PAY SANCTIONS OF $718.91 TO PLAINTIFF’S COUNSEL WITHIN 20 DAYS’
SERVICE OF THIS ORDER.
 
 
Moving party to give notice.
