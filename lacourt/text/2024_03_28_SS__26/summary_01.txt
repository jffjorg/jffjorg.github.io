And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the Plaintiff's Motion to Sever Trial, severing the fifth cause of action for breach of personal guaranty from the remaining causes of action. The Plaintiff filed the instant action against Defendants FTS, Tirado, and Hudson Insurance Company. Defendant Tirado filed for bankruptcy, and the action is stayed as to them. Defendant FTS is in default, and the Plaintiff wishes to obtain default judgment against them and later seek judgment against Defendant Tirado. The Judge finds that a severed judgment is proper, as it would allow the Plaintiff to move forward with obtaining default judgment against Defendant FTS and then seek judgment against Defendant Tirado once the bankruptcy proceeding is resolved.
