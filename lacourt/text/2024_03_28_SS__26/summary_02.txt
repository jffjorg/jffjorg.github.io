The defendant is also ordered to pay sanctions of $718.91 to the plaintiff's counsel within 20 days of service of this order. The judge found that the defendant's failure to respond to the discovery requests constitutes a misuse of the discovery process and is entitled to an order compelling a response. The sanctions are granted based on a lodestar calculation of one hour of attorney time billed at $650.00 per hour and $68.91 in costs.
