Adeosun
v. Queen, et al.DEMURRER
(CCP § 430.10, et seq.)
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Defendant Queen Anieze-Smith’s
Demurrer to the Complaint is OVERRULED. DEFENDANT IS TO FILE AND SERVE AN
ANSWER TO THE COMPLAINT WITHIN 20 DAYS OF THIS ORDER.
 
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
On January 4, 2024, Plaintiff Oluwakemi Adeosun (“Plaintiff”), in propria persona, filed the Complaint in
this action against Defendant Queen Anieze-Smith (“Defendant”) (erroneously
sued as Anieze Smith Queen). Defendant, in propria persona, filed the
instant Demurrer to the Complaint on February 20,
2024. No opposition has been filed to date.
 
Discussion

 
Plaintiff alleges she met Defendant through church and
Defendant introduced herself as a car dealer. (Compl., p. 2.) Plaintiff stated
she needed a reliable car and Defendant promised to get Plaintiff a good
vehicle. (Ibid.) Plaintiff paid Defendant $9,750.00 for a 2015 Honda
CR-V only to discover that it needed repairs in the thousands of dollars, which
Plaintiff also paid. (Ibid.) Defendant also promised to do the
registration for $500.00 but then refused to communicate and threatened to call
the police and report the vehicle as stolen. (Ibid.) Plaintiff returned
the vehicle so she would not get in trouble and asked for her money back. (Ibid.)

 
Defendant demurs to the Complaint
for failure to allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action. (Citing Code
Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (d).) However, the Demurrer is not accompanied by a
meet and confer declaration as required by Code of Civil Procedure section
430.41. (Motion, Jensen Decl., ¶¶2-3.) The Demurrer is brought on the grounds
that Defendant was not a party to the vehicle purchase agreement, which was
between Plaintiff and Bewise Auto Sales. As this argument relies on facts
outside of the Complaint or of judicially noticeable matters, it is not a
proper basis to demur. A demurrer can be used only to
challenge defects that appear on the face of the pleading under attack; or from
matters outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 430.30; Blank v. Kirwan (1985)
39 Cal.3d 311, 318.)
 
Therefore, the Demurrer to the
Complaint is overruled.
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant Queen Anieze-Smith’s Demurrer to the Complaint is OVERRULED.
DEFENDANT IS TO FILE AND SERVE AN ANSWER TO THE COMPLAINT WITHIN 20 DAYS OF
THIS ORDER.
