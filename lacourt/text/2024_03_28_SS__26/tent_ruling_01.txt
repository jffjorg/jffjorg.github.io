Hirsch Pipe & Supply Co., Inc. v. FTS Plumbing,
et al.MOTION TO SEVER
TRIAL
(CCP
§ 579)
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Plaintiff Hirsch Pipe & Supply Co., Inc.’s Motion to
Sever is GRANTED. THE FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION FOR BREACH OF PERSONAL GUARANTY IS
SEVERED FROM THE REMAINING CAUSES OF ACTION.
 
 
 
 
ANALYSIS:  
 
On March 9, 2023,
Plaintiff Hirsch Pipe & Supply Co., Inc. (“Plaintiff”) filed the
instant action against Defendants FTS Plumbing Inc., (“Defendant FTS”), Felipe
Tirado (“Defendant Tirado”), and Hudson Insurance Company (“Defendant Hudson”).
Notice of Stay of Proceedings due to a bankruptcy filing was filed with respect
to Defendant Tirado on April 14, 2023. Default was then entered against
Defendant FTS, which had not filed a responsive pleading, on April 28, 2023. On
November 13, 2023, Plaintiff dismissed Defendant Hudson from the action. 
 
Plaintiff filed the instant
Motion to Sever Trial on March 1, 2024. No opposition has been filed to date.
 
Discussion
 
The Motion
is brought pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 579, which states in
relevant part: “In an action
against several defendants, the Court may, in its discretion, render judgment
against one or more of them, leaving the action to proceed against the others,
whenever a several judgment is proper.”
(Code Civ.
Proc., § 579.) 
 
As Plaintiff
explains, the action is currently stayed as to Defendant Tirado due to their
bankruptcy proceeding. Only the fifth cause of action, for breach of personal
guaranty, is alleged against Defendant Tirado. The remaining causes of action
for breach of contract, common counts, and enforcement of contractor’s bond,
are brought against Defendant FTS, which is in default. Plaintiff wishes to
move forward with obtaining default judgment against Defendant FTS, and
thereafter, depending on the resolution of the bankruptcy proceeding, will
later seek judgment against Defendant Tirado. However, if the causes of action
are not severed, Plaintiff must wait for resolution of the bankruptcy
proceeding to pursue a judgment against both Defendants. This supports a
finding that a severed judgment is proper. 
 
Conclusion
 
Therefore, Plaintiff
Hirsch Pipe & Supply Co., Inc.’s Motion to Sever is GRANTED. THE FIFTH
CAUSE OF ACTION FOR BREACH OF PERSONAL GUARANTY IS SEVERED FROM THE REMAINING
CAUSES OF ACTION.
