ANALYSIS:
 
On December 29, 2023, Plaintiff Keenan McNair (“Plaintiff”)
served Special Interrogatories, Set One, on Defendant LA Live Theater, LLC
(“Defendant”). (Motion, Mehrban Decl.,
Exh. A.) Despite a meet-and-confer effort extending the deadline to serve
verified responses without objections, Defendant has not served responses. (Id.
at ¶¶4-5 and Exh. B.) Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to Compel Responses to
Special Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for Sanctions, on March 1, 2024. Defendant
filed an untimely opposition on March 19, 2024 . 
 
Defendant contends that it did not receive the discovery
requests served on December 29, 2023 and only became aware of them on February
15, 2024 when Plaintiff’s counsel sent defense counsel another copy. (Opp.,
Hase Decl., ¶¶4-5.) The meet and confer letter from Plaintiff’s counsel,
however, indicated that responses should be provided by February 22, 2024 to
avoid a motion to compel responses. (Motion, Merhban Decl., Exh. B.) Defendant
does not explain why the responses were not served by the extended deadline of
February 22, 2024, or why another extension was not sought. Nor does Defendant
explain why the opposition was not filed and served until March 19, 2024, when
it was due by March 15, 2024 at the latest. Finally, no copy of the responses
is attached to the opposition for the Court to evaluate their compliance with the
statutory requirements. 
 
There is no requirement for a prior meet and confer effort
before a motion to compel initial responses can be filed. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290.) Further, the motion can be brought any time after the responding
party fails to provide the responses. 
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290.) Based on Defendant’s failure to timely respond
to the propounded discovery, Plaintiff is entitled to an order compelling it to
serve verified responses to the discovery requests without objections. 
 
Defendant’s failure to timely respond constitutes a misuse
of the discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d).) Sanctions
are appropriate under Code of Civil Procedure sections 2023.010 and 2023.030
and have been properly noticed. Sanctions are awarded against Defendant and
counsel of record in the amount of $500.00 based on one hour of attorney time
billed at $500.00 per hour. (Motion, Mehrban Decl., ¶6.) 
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff Keenan McNair’s Motion to Compel Responses to Special
Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for Sanctions, is GRANTED. DEFENDANT LA LIVE THEATER, LLC IS TO SERVE VERIFIED RESPONSES TO SPECIAL INTERROGATORIES, SET ONE, WITHOUT
OBJECTIONS, WITHIN 20 DAYS’ SERVICE OF THIS ORDER. DEFENDANT LA LIVE
THEATER, LLC AND COUNSEL OF RECORD ARE
JOINTLY AND SEVERALLY ORDERED TO PAY
SANCTIONS OF $500.00 TO PLAINTIFF’S COUNSEL WITHIN 20 DAYS’ SERVICE OF THIS
ORDER.
