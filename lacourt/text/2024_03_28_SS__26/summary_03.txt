And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the Defendant's demurrer to the Complaint is stricken and the Defendant must file and serve an answer to the Complaint within 20 days. The Defendant filed the demurrer on November 27, 2023, but it was not accompanied by proof of service and a meet and confer declaration as required by law. The Court continued the hearing date to allow the Defendant to file the missing papers, but to date, no papers have been filed. Therefore, the Court strikes the demurrer pursuant to its inherent authority.
