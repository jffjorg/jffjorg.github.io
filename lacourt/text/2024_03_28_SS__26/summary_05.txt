And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Adeosun v. Queen, et al. The Defendant, Queen Anieze-Smith, filed a demurrer to the Complaint, arguing that it does not state a cause of action. However, the Judge has ruled that the demurrer is not valid because it is not accompanied by a meet and confer declaration as required by California Civil Procedure Code Section 430.41. The Judge has also found that the demurrer relies on facts outside of the Complaint or judicially noticeable matters, which is not a proper basis for demurrer. Therefore, the demurrer is overruled and the Defendant is ordered to file and serve an answer to the Complaint within 20 days of the order.
