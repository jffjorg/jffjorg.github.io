 Case Number:  23SMCV03173    Hearing Date:   May 8, 2024    Dept:  I The court had thought that the parties had a disagreement on
fees and the court believed that such a disagreement ought to be resolved by
motion, not by argument or ex parte application.  That understanding is based specifically on
defendant’s objection to the prior form of judgment in which the fee award was
objected to expressly.  The court agrees
that there is at least a question whether the fee award for default can include
fees incurred unrelated to enforcing the judgment.  The court does not intend to resolve that
today; the point was that the judgment was flexible enough to allow the court
to rule on motion without the need for a whole new judgment.
This was not a scrivener’s error.  The application is DENIED.  The court will not entertain argument.
