  Case Number:  21STCV17582    Hearing Date:   May 8, 2024    Dept:  I The motion to set aside is DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.  Defendant filed a motion to set aside the
default.  Plaintiff opposed.  Defendant filed a “Supplemental” statement on
May 1, 2024, and a second “Supplemental” statement on May 6, 2024.  Apparently, defense counsel does not
understand how briefs work.  Counsel may
refile a motion to set aside if it is done no later than Monday, May 13, 2024.  It will conform to the rules regarding
briefs.  The matter will be set for
hearing in the usual way—through the court’s reservation system.  Opposition will be by code.  An optional reply may be presented as allowed
by code.  However, the reply will conform
to the requirements for a reply brief and will have no new evidence or
argument.
 
At present, matter is proceeding by way of default.  Defendant’s decision not even to try and do
this the right way is not a good way to achieve the result he seeks.
