The judge's tentative ruling discusses the disagreement on fees between the parties. The court believes that this disagreement should be resolved through a motion, not through argument or an ex parte application. The court agrees that there is a question whether the fee award for default can include fees incurred unrelated to enforcing the judgment. However, the judge does not intend to resolve this issue today. The court's intention is to allow for a flexible judgment that allows for ruling on a motion without needing a new judgment. The application to enforce the judgment is denied, and the court will not entertain further argument.
