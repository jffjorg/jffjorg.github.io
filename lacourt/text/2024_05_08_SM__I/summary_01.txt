The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to set aside the default. The defendant filed the motion, which was opposed by the plaintiff. The defendant filed two "Supplemental" statements, but the judge notes that counsel did not understand how briefs work. The judge denied the motion to set aside without prejudice, allowing the defendant to refile the motion by May 13, 2024. The judge also set out the rules for filing briefs and opposing the motion. The matter will proceed by way of default, and the judge encourages the defendant to follow the proper procedures in the future.
