Roles:
  - Judge
  - Plaintiff
  - Defendant
  - Attorney for Defendant

Significant Statements:
  - "A general demurrer may be interposed when the complaint shows on its face that the agreement sued on is within the statute of frauds and does not comply with its requirements."
  - "Partial performance allows a contract to be enforced."
  - "Estoppel can be applied to overcome the Uniform Commercial Code's statute of frauds provision as long as a court is not enforcing a mere oral promise."
  - "A party is estopped to assert the statute of frauds as a defense where the party, by words or conduct, represents that he will stand by his oral agreement."
```

The judge's tentative ruling is that the demurrer is sustained in part as to the Second Cause of Action (Common Counts) and overruled in part as to the First Cause of Action (Breach of Contract). The motion to strike is granted. The court finds that the oral agreement between the parties is sufficient to enforce the contract and that the statute of frauds does not apply. The court also finds that the plaintiff is entitled to recover damages, but not attorney's fees.
