  Case Number:  23AVCV01097    Hearing Date:   March 5, 2024    Dept:  A14 Background
 
This is a breach of contract action.
Plaintiff Antonio D. Cazares Barajas[1]
(“Plaintiff”) alleges that on or about June 04, 2022, he made an oral agreement
with Defendant Humberto Ramirez (“Ramirez”) such that Plaintiff would purchase
four wheelchair vans from Ramirez for a total price of $120,000.00 and Ramirez
would (1) pay off the vehicles to the finance companies that the vehicles were
being financed with, and (2) provide the titles of each of the vehicles to
Plaintiff once he received them. Plaintiff states he paid $98,000.00 out of the
$120,000.00. Plaintiff further alleges that on or about January 12, 2023, Ford
Finance came to Plaintiff’s place of business and repossessed the first van; on
February 04, 2023, For Finance came again to Plaintiff’s place of business and
repossessed the second van; and subsequently the other two vans were also
repossessed by the finance company. 
 
On September 29, 2023, Plaintiff
filed his Complaint alleging two causes of action for Breach of Contract and
Common Counts. 
 
On January 10, 2024, Ramirez and Desert
Sky Transit (“Moving Defendants”) filed a Declaration of Demurring Party in
Support of Automatic Extension.
 
On February 07, 2024, Moving
Defendants filed this Demurrer with Motion to Strike.
 
No Opposition has been filed. “All
papers opposing a motion so noticed shall be filed with the court and a copy
served on each party at least nine court days. . .before the hearing.” (Cal.
Code Civ. Proc. §1005(b).) “Section 1013, which extends the time within which a
right may be exercised or an act may be done, does not apply to a notice of
motion, papers opposing a motion, or reply papers governed by this section.” (Ibid.)
The hearing is set for March 05, 2024. Accordingly, an Opposition was due by February
21, 2024. Should an Opposition be filed, it is now untimely.

Legal Standard
 
Standard for Demurrer – A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of
action.¿ (Hahn v.¿Mirda¿(2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) ¿When
considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in context.¿ (Taylor
v. City of Los Angeles Dept. of Water and Power¿(2006) 144 Cal.App.4th
1216, 1228.)¿ In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the
face of the pleading or by proper judicial notice.¿ (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §
430.30(a).)¿A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other
extrinsic matters.¿ (SKF Farms v. Superior Court¿(1984) 153 Cal.App.3d
902, 905.)¿ Therefore, it lies only where the defects appear on the face of the
pleading or are judicially noticed.¿¿(Ibid.)¿¿The only issue involved in
a demurrer hearing is¿whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with
extraneous matters, states a cause of action.¿ (Hahn,¿supra,¿147
Cal.App.4th at 747.)¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
A general demurrer admits the truth of all
factual, material allegations properly pled in the challenged pleading,
regardless of possible difficulties of proof.¿¿(Blank v. Kirwan (1985)
39 Cal.3d 311, 318.)¿ Thus, no matter how unlikely or improbable, plaintiff’s
allegations must be accepted as true for the purpose of ruling on the
demurrer.¿¿(Del E. Webb Corp. v. Structural Materials Co.¿(1981) 123
Cal.App.3d 593, 604.)¿ Nevertheless, this rule does not apply to allegations
expressing mere conclusions of law, or allegations contradicted by the exhibits
to the complaint or by matters of which judicial notice may be taken.¿¿(Vance
v. Villa Park¿Mobilehome¿Estates¿(1995) 36 Cal.App.4th 698, 709.)¿A general
demurrer does not admit contentions, deductions, or conclusions of fact or law
alleged in the complaint; facts impossible in law; or allegations contrary to
facts of which a court may take judicial notice.¿¿(Blank,¿supra,
39 Cal.3d at p. 318.)¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
Pursuant to¿Code Civ. Proc.¿§430.10(e), the
party against whom a complaint has been filed may object by demurrer to the
pleading on the grounds that the pleading does not state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action.¿ It is an abuse of discretion to sustain a
demurrer without leave to amend if there is a reasonable probability that the
defect can be cured by amendment.¿¿(Schifando¿v. City of Los Angeles¿(2003)
31 Cal.4th 1074, 1082,¿as modified Dec. 23, 2003.)¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿¿ 
-----¿¿ 
¿¿ 
Standard for a Motion to Strike – The court may, upon a motion, or at any time
in its discretion, and upon terms it deems proper, strike any irrelevant,
false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading. (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §
436(a).) The court may also strike all or any part of any pleading not drawn or
filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of
the court. (Id., § 436(b).) The grounds for a motion to strike are that
the pleading has irrelevant, false, or improper matter, or has not been drawn
or filed in conformity with laws. (Id. § 436.) The grounds for moving to
strike must appear on the face of the pleading or by way of judicial notice. (Id.
§ 437.)¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿¿ 
-----¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿¿ 
Meet and Confer Requirement – Before filing a demurrer or a motion to strike, the demurring or moving
party is required to meet and confer with the party who filed the pleading
demurred to or the pleading that is subject to the motion to strike for the
purposes of determining whether an agreement can be reached through a filing of
an amended pleading that would resolve the objections to be raised in the
demurrer. (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §§ 430.41 and 435.5.) The Court notes that a
meet and confer has not occurred as counsel for Moving Defendants, Stephen F.
Yurcich (“Yurcich”), declares that he attempted to contact Plaintiff and one
Mr. Swinson who substituted into this cause on January 31, 2024. (See Decl.
Yurcich [attached to both the Demurrer and Motion to Strike] ¶¶ 2-7.) The Court
notes that there is no filed substitution of attorney. Currently, Plaintiff is
proceeding in pro per. “A determination by the court that the meet and
confer process was insufficient shall not be grounds to overrule or sustain a
demurrer.” (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 430.41(a)(4).) Accordingly, the Court
addresses the Demurrer on its merits.

Discussion
 
Application – 
 
i.       Demurer
 
Defendant asserts that the First
Cause of Action (Breach of Contract) is barred by the Statute of Frauds, citing
Cal. Com. Code § 2201, as the alleged price Plaintiff was to pay under the
contract for the four wheelchair vehicles is $120,000.00. Defendant presents
that since enforcement of the underlying alleged oral contract is barred, the
statute of frauds impacts the Second Cause of Action (Common Counts) as well. 
 
As presented by Defendant:
 
The interpretation
of a contract is a judicial function (See Brown v. Goldstein [(2019) 34
Cal.App.5th 418, 432-33.)] In interpreting a contract, the trial court gives
effect to the mutual intention of the parties as it existed at the time the
contract was executed. [(Id.)] The objective intent of the contracting
parties is a legal question determined solely by reference to the contract's
terms. [(Id.)] Under California law, it is within the province of this
court to interpret the purchase agreement at issue.
 
(Demurrer 4:24-5:1.)
“A general demurrer may be
interposed when the complaint shows on its face that the agreement sued on is
within the statute of frauds and does not comply with its requirements.” (Parker
v. Solomon (1959) 171 Cal.App.2d 125, 136).
 
There are two statutes governing
the statute of frauds – (1) a general statute of frauds codified in Cal. Civ.
Code § 1624, and (2) a statute of frauds applicable to the sale of goods
codified in Cal. Com. Code § 2201. (See Cal. Civ. Code§ 1624; Cal. Com. Code §
2201; Seaman's Direct Buying Service, Inc. v. Standard Oil Co. (1984) 36
Cal.3d 752, 762-64 [discussing interplay of the statute of frauds in Cal. Civ.
Code § 1624 and Cal. Com. Code § 2201; overruled as to availability of tort
action in contract].) Defendant’s argument is premised on the statute of frauds
applicable to the sale of goods. 
 
The statute of frauds in Cal.
Com. Code provides: “Except as otherwise provided in this section a contract
for the sale of goods for the price of five hundred dollars ($500) or more is
not enforceable by way of action or defense unless there is a record sufficient
to indicate that a contract for sale has been made between the parties and
signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought or by the party’s
authorized agent or broker. A record is not insufficient because it omits or
incorrectly states a term agreed upon but the contract is not enforceable under
this subdivision beyond the quantity of goods shown in the record.” (Cal. Com.
Code § 2201(1).) Here, the contract is alleged to be oral. (See Complaint,
Breach of Contract Cause of Action Attachment at BC-1.) Based on the
allegations, taken as truth for the purposes of this Demurrer, there is no
written contract signed between the parties. 
 
The requirement in Cal. Com. Code
§ 2201 is relaxed in transactions between merchants. (See Cal. Com. Code § 2201(2.)
Here, neither party is alleged to be a merchant, nor does the Court believe
that a liberal reading of the Complaint allows for such an inference. The Court
notes that the Complaint concedes Plaintiff runs a business; however, Plaintiff
has not held himself out as “having knowledge or skill peculiar to the
practices or goods involved in the transaction or to whom such knowledge or
skill may be attributed by his employment of an agent or broker or other
intermediary who by his occupation holds himself out as having such knowledge
or skill. (Cal. Com. Code § 2104(1).) “Further, the allegation in the Complaint
is such that there is no memorialization of the contract, making Cal. Com Code
§ 2201’s relaxed standard inapplicable. 
 
Cal. Com. Code § 2201(3)
provides:
 
A contract which
does not satisfy the requirements of subdivision (1) but which is valid in
other respects is enforceable:
 
(a) If the goods are
to be specially manufactured for the buyer and are not suitable for sale to
others in the ordinary course of the seller’s business and the seller, before
notice of repudiation is received and under circumstances which reasonably indicate
that the goods are for the buyer, has made either a substantial beginning of
their manufacture or commitments for their procurement;
 
(b) If the party
against whom enforcement is sought admits in its pleading, testimony, or
otherwise in court that a contract for sale was made, but the contract is not
enforceable under this provision beyond the quantity of goods admitted; or
 
(c) With respect to
goods for which payment has been made and accepted or which have been received
and accepted (Section 2606).
 
Here, the goods are not
specifically manufactured for Plaintiff and are suitable for sale to others. It
is unclear as to whether Defendant sells these wheelchair vans. Defendant has
not admitted in its pleading, testimony, or otherwise that a contract for sale
was made – only that Plaintiff asserts that an oral contract was made. (See
Demurrer [generally].) As to Cal. Com. Code § 2201(3)(c), the official comments
provide:
 
“Partial
performance” as a substitute for the required memorandum can validate the
contract only for the goods which have been accepted or for which payment has
been made and accepted.
 
Receipt and
acceptance either of goods or of the price constitutes an unambiguous overt
admission by both parties that a contract actually exists. If the court can
make a just apportionment, therefore, the agreed price of any goods actually
delivered can be recovered without a writing or, if the price has been paid,
the seller can be forced to deliver an apportionable part of the goods. The
overt actions of the parties make admissible evidence of the other terms of the
contract necessary to a just apportionment. This is true even though the
actions of the parties are not in themselves inconsistent with a different
transaction such as a consignment for resale or a mere loan of money.
 
Part performance by
the buyer requires the delivery of something by him that is accepted by the
seller as such performance. Thus, part payment may be made by money or check,
accepted by the seller. If the agreed price consists of goods or services, then
they must also have been delivered and accepted.
 
 
(Cal. Com. Code § 2201 [Deering,
Lexis Advance through the 2023 Extra Session Ch 1, 2023 Regular Session Ch.
890].)
 
Plaintiff has alleged that (1) he
paid $98,000.00 of the $120,000.00 price for four wheelchair vans (Complaint,
Breach of Contract Cause of Action at BC-1), and (2) Plaintiff had received the
four wheelchair vans as Ford Finance came to his place of business and
repossessed them (Complaint, Breach of Contract Cause of Action at BC-2). Thus,
a reasonable inference can be made that Defendant delivered the goods, the
goods were accepted by Plaintiff, and the partial payment was accepted by
Defendant. 
 
“[A] party is estopped to assert
the statute of frauds as a defense where the party, by words or conduct,
represents that he will stand by his oral agreement, and the other party, in
reliance upon that representation, changes his position, to his detriment.” (Garcia
v. World Sav., FSB (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 1031, 1041, fn. 10; see also Allied
Grape Growers v. Bronco Wine Co. (1988) 203 Cal.App.3d 432 [“California
Uniform Commercial Code section 1103 states that principles of law and equity
not otherwise covered by the code shall supplement the code's provisions. In
their Commercial Code treatise, James White and Robert Summers propose that the
equitable principle of promissory estoppel survives in the California Uniform
Commercial Code through section 1103. Estoppel can act as one further exception
to imposition of the statute of frauds. They argue that section 1203, which
imposes an obligation on every contract to act in good faith, further supports
their contention that equitable estoppel survives enactment under the Uniform
Commercial Code. Where a party to an oral agreement misleads another, even
innocently, sections 1103 and 1203 can be used to impose equitable estoppel
against the transgressing party. (White & Summers, Uniform Com. Code (2d
ed. 1980) § 2-6, pp. 68-70.)”].). Allied Grape Growers v. Bronco Wine Co.
held that “estoppel can be applied to overcome the Uniform Commercial Code's
statute of frauds provision as long as a court is not enforcing a mere oral
promise” and, in order for this to be applied, “[t]here must be some form of
detrimental reliance.” (Allied Grape Growers, supra, 203
Cal.App.3d at 443-44.) The facts, as pled and taken as truth for the purpose of
this Demurrer, appear sufficient to demonstrate detrimental reliance as
Plaintiff has paid $98,000.00 out of the 120,000. (Complaint, Breach of
Contract Cause of Action at BC-1)
 
Accordingly, it appears that the
Statute of Frauds argument brought by Defendant fails due to the applicability
of estoppel. 
 
The Court turns next to the
individual arguments for each claim. 
 
Defendant argues that Plaintiff
has conceded that he paid only a partial amount of the vehicle, therefore
Plaintiff did not allege full performance of the oral agreement and cannot
state a claim for breach of contract as the element of performance is lacking
under the facts as pled.
 
“To prevail on a cause of action
for breach of contract, the plaintiff must prove (1) the contract, (2) the
plaintiff’s performance of the contract or excuse for nonperformance, (3) the
defendant’s breach, and (4) the resulting damage to the plaintiff.” (Richman
v. Hartley (2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 1182, 1186
 
Defendant provides no legal
standard in the form of case precedent or statute as to how partial performance
please into the element of performance. Rather, Defendant’s arguments are based
on assertion alone that this is how California contract law works. 
 
As discussed, ante,
partial performance allows a contract to be enforced. This is also reiterated
in California case precedent. (See Secrest v. Security National Mortgage
Loan Trust 2002-2 (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 544, 555; In re Marriage of
Benson (2005) 36 Cal.4th 1096, 1108-09; Shive v. Barrow (1948) 88
Cal.App.2d 838.) Further, based on the allegations which the Court must accept
as true, the partial performance was accepted as full performance/or the
remaining $22,000.00 was excused as the goods were delivered to Plaintiff and
accepted. Thus, for the purposes of the Demurrer, the Complaint has pled
sufficient facts demonstrating that Plaintiff's partial performance under the
parties’ agreement is sufficient for him to enforce the contract.
 
Regarding the Second Cause of
Action (Common Counts), Defendant argues that Plaintiff has only alleged an
unsigned oral agreement between the parties. Defendant further argues that under
Cal. Civ. Code § 1624, an agreement by its terms is not to be performed within
a year from making it is invalid unless in writing and subscribed by the party
making and the Complaint concedes that the agreement was not performed within a
year so the agreement is invalid under the statute of frauds codified in Cal.
Civ. Code § 1624. 
 
To the extent that this argument
applies to the First Cause of Action (Breach of Contract), the Court has
discussed the statute of frauds application, ante. The Court reiterates
the alleged partial performance and its effect on the oral contract at this
stage of the pleadings. That is, based on the allegations which the Court must
accept as true, the partial performance was accepted as full performance/or the
remaining $22,000.00 was excused as the goods were delivered to Plaintiff and
accepted. Further, case law regarding the general statute of frauds codified in
Cal. Civ. Code § 1624 provide that partial performance of or fully executed
oral contracts are taken out of the operation of the statute of frauds. (See American
Casualty Co. v. Curran Productions, Inc. (1963) 212 Cal.App.2d 386, 392-33;
Grant v. Long (1939) 33 Cal. App. 2d 725, 742; Schaefer v. United
Bank & Trust Co. (1930) 104 Cal.App. 635, 646.) The Court emphasizes
that, as alleged, there is more than a bare promise and payment of money. The
allegations are such that an oral agreement was made, Plaintiff paid
$98,000.00, the goods (four wheelchair vans) were received by Plaintiff (i.e.,
inference of delivery by Defendant), and the goods were repossessed due to
failure of payment on Defendant’s end to the financial companies that financed
the goods. 
 
“In California, it has long been
settled the allegation of claims using common counts is good against special or
general demurrers. [citation omitted] The only essential allegations of a
common count are ‘(1) the statement of indebtedness in a certain sum. (2) the
consideration, i.e., goods sold, work done, etc., and (3) nonpayment.’ ” (Farmers
Ins. Exchange v. Zerin (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 445, 460.) California cases
describe common counts as “a general pleading which seeks recovery of money
without specifying the nature of the claim.” (Title Insur. Co. v. State
Board of Equalization (1992) 4 Cal.4th 715, 731.)
 
Here, there is no statement of
indebtedness. 
 
Accordingly, the Demurrer is
SUSTAINED in part as the Second Cause of Action (Common Counts) and OVERRULED
in part as to the First Cause of Action (Breach of Contract). 
Leave to amend must be allowed where there
is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman v. Kennedy¿(1976),
18 Cal.3d 335, 348.) While under California law leave to amend is liberally
granted, “leave to amend should not be granted where, in all
probability, amendment would be futile.” (Vaillette v. Fireman's Fund Ins.
Co. (1993), 18 Cal.App.4th 680, 685 [emphasis original]).¿¿ 
 
Here,
because of the lax standard for a claim of common counts, the Second Cause of
Action (Comon Counts) has a reasonably possibility of successful amendment.
 
The Court allows leave to amend.
 
ii.    
Motion to
Strike
 
Defendant
seeks to strike references to attorney’s fees within the Complaint:
 
·      
Page 2, ¶ 10:
“For attorney’s fees according to proof;”
·      
Page 3, ¶ BC-5:
“Plaintiff is entitled to attorney’s fees by an agreement or a statute
according to proof;” and
·      
Page 4, ¶ CC-3:
“Plaintiff is entitled to attorney’s fees by an agreement or a statute
according to proof.”
 
Defendant
presents that the alleged oral agreement does not provide for attorney’s fees
and no attorney’s fees are authorized by statute, thus, Plaintiff’s request for
attorney’s fees is not drawn or filed in conformity with applicable rules
and/or laws of this state.
 
The “American Rule” is that absent a
contract or statute providing otherwise, each party to litigation should bear
his or her own attorney's fees. (See Alyeska Pipeline Serv. Co. v.
Wilderness Soc'y (1975) 421 U.S. 240, 246-255; Griggs v. Board of
Trustees (1964) 61 Cal.2d 93.) 
 
California has codified the “American Rule.”
Pursuant to Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 1021: “Except as attorney's fees are
specifically provided for by statute, the measure and mode of compensation of
attorneys and counselors at law is left to the agreement, express or implied,
of the parties; but parties to actions or proceedings are entitled to their
costs, as hereinafter provided.” 
 
Plaintiff has not indicated what statute or
agreement gives him the ability to request attorney's fees in this case. As
such, Plaintiff cannot maintain a claim for attorney's fee. 
 
Accordingly, the Motion to Strike is
GRANTED. 
 
-----
 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant Humberto Ramirez and
Desert Sky Transit’s Demurrer is SUSTAINED in part as to the Second Cause of
Action (Common Counts), and OVERRULED in part as to the First Cause of Action
(Breach of Contract).
 
Defendant Humberto Ramirez and Desert Sky Transit’s Motion
to Strike is GRANTED.
