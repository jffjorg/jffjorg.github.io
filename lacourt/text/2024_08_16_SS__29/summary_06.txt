And here is a summary in English text:

The judge has ruled that the motion to dismiss filed by Woodman Apartments, LLC (Doe 3) is denied. The judge found that the delay in naming Woodman as a defendant was unreasonable, but that it would not be fair to dismiss the case due to the delay. The judge noted that there is a strong public policy in favor of resolving disputes on the merits rather than based on procedural defaults or missteps. The judge also noted that the delay was not intentional, but rather the result of an error by the plaintiff's counsel. The judge concluded that the motion to dismiss was denied, but that Woodman may still seek to continue the trial and reset the discovery deadlines based on the new trial date to remedy any unfair prejudice.
