21STCV04291
Motion to Compel Deposition
Tentative
The Court GRANTS the
motion to compel the deposition of Plaintiff Fatima Adauta.
The Court GRANTS in part
Defendants’ motion for sanctions.
Background
On February 3, 2021, Fatima
Adauta and Maria Serafin filed a complaint against David Redlus, Deanna
Redlus (collectively "Defendants”), and Does 1 through 50 for
negligence arising out of an automobile accident occurring on February 22, 2019. 
On January 11, 2023, a default
was entered against Defendants. Defendants filed their answer on March 17,
2023. On April 24, 2023, a stipulation was filed setting aside the entry default
against Defendants.
As it relates to the matter currently before the
Court and set for hearing on August 16,
Defendants initially noticed the deposition of Plaintiff Fatima Adauta
(“Plaintiff”) for October 5, 2023.  (Messina Decl., ¶
4.)  The deposition was taken off calendar at Plaintiff’s
request.  (Id., ¶ 5.)  Plaintiff indicated that she
was available for deposition on March 27, 2024, and so Defendants noticed her
deposition on that date.  (Id., ¶¶ 7-10 & Exh. E.)
Plaintiff did not serve objections or appear for
the deposition.  (Id., ¶¶ 11-16 & Exh.
H.)  Defendants inquired about the nonappearance and rescheduling the
deposition but received no response.  (Id., ¶¶ 17-18 &
Exh. I.)
On
June 14, 2024, Defendants filed this motion to compel the deposition of
Plaintiff. Defendants also seek monetary sanctions.  No opposition has been filed.
The
hearing was initially set for July 24 and was continued by the Court to August
16. 
Legal Standard
“Any party may obtain
discovery … by taking in California the oral deposition of any person,
including any party to the action.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2025.010.)  Code of Civil Procedure sections 2025.210 through
2025.280 provide the requirements for (among other things) what must be
included in a deposition notice, when and where depositions may be taken, and
how and when the notice must be served. 
“The service of a
deposition notice … is effective to require any deponent who is a party to the
action or an officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a party to
attend and to testify, as well as to produce any document, electronically
stored information, or tangible thing for inspection and copying.”  (Id.,
§ 2025.280, subd. (a).)
Section 2025.410, subdivision
(a), requires any party to serve a written objection at least three days before
the deposition if the party contends that a deposition notice does not comply
with the provisions of sections 2025.210 through 2025.280.
“If, after service of a
deposition notice, a party to the action or an officer, director, managing
agent, or employee of a party, or a person designated by an organization
that is a party under Section 2025.230, without having served a valid
objection under Section 2025.410, fails to appear for examination, or to
proceed with it, or to produce for¿inspection any document, electronically
stored information, or tangible thing described in the deposition notice, the
party giving the notice may move for an order compelling the deponent’s
attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (a).)  Any
such motion to compel must show good cause for the production of documents and,
when a deponent has failed to appear, the motion must be accompanied “by a
declaration stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire
about the nonappearance.”  (Id., subd. (b).) 
When a motion to compel is
granted, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) in favor of the party who noticed the
deposition and against the deponent or the party with whom the deponent is
affiliated, unless the court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust.”  (Id., § 2025.450, subd. (g)(1).) 
In Chapter 7 of the Civil
Discovery Act, section 2023.010, subdivision (d), defines “[m]isuses of the
discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to respond to or to submit to an
authorized method of discovery.”  Where a party or attorney has engaged
in misuse of the discovery process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in
the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by
anyone as a result of that conduct.”  (Id., § 2023.030,
subd. (a).)
Discussion
After a prior unsuccessful
attempt, Defendants noticed Plaintiff’s deposition for March 27, 2024, a date
on which Plaintiff had previously indicated she was available.  (Messina
Decl., ¶¶ 7-10 & Exh. E.)  Plaintiff did not object and did not
appear.  (Id., ¶¶ 11-16 & Exh.
H.)  Defendants reached out to Plaintiff to inquire about the
nonappearance and received no response.  (Id., ¶¶ 17-18 &
Exh. I.)
Defendants need not show
anything more.  All substantive and
procedural requirements have been satisfied. 
The motion to compel is granted.
Defendants’ request for
sanctions is also granted in part.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (g)(1).)  Given
the relatively straightforward nature of this motion, the Court sets sanctions
in the amount of $600, calculated based on two hours of attorney time
multiplied by a reasonable billing rate of $300 per hour for work of this
nature.  (See Messina Decl., ¶ 19.)

motion to compel the deposition of Plaintiff Fatima Adauta.

__, 2014, at 10:00 am, via remote video conference.  Defendants are to provide a video link at

Defendants’ motion for sanctions.
