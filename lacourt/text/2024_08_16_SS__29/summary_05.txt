And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses a motion for summary judgment or, in the alternative, for summary adjudication of issues filed by Glendale Dodge, LLC. The motion is directed to both the First Amended Complaint (FAC) filed by Plaintiffs and the cross-complaint filed against Glendale Dodge by the Daniyelyans.

The judge notes that the motion will be heard and that counsel will be given the opportunity to present argument on the following issues: (1) whether Glendale Dodge is liable for the accident under the theory of respondeat superior, (2) whether Glendale Dodge was negligent in hiring, supervising, and/or retaining Mr. Garcia, and (3) whether Glendale Dodge negligently entrusted the vehicle to Mr. Garcia.

The judge also addresses several preliminary issues, including objections to evidence and the scope of the issues to be considered.

The judge's tentative ruling is that Glendale Dodge is entitled to summary adjudication on the Fourth Cause of Action (negligent entrustment) because it is undisputed that Glendale Dodge did not own or control the vehicle at the time of the accident. The judge also notes that the motion will be heard and that counsel will be given the opportunity to present argument on the remaining issues.

The judge's ruling is based on the evidence presented in support of and in opposition to the motion, and the judge will liberally construe the evidence in support of the party opposing summary judgment and resolve doubts concerning the evidence in favor of that party.
