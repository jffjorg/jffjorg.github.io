And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to bifurcate without prejudice. In personal injury hub cases, motions to bifurcate are typically heard by the trial court, not the personal injury hub court. The judge has ordered that the bifurcation be included in Tab B of the trial binder, along with any motion in limine filed in the case, for consideration by the trial court. The judge has also stated that the trial judge should make a discretionary determination on the motion, based on their power and control over management of the trial proceedings. This ruling does not contradict Los Angeles County Superior Court Local Rule 3.57(c) and does not bind the trial court in any way.
