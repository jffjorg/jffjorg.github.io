  Case Number:  19STCV03327    Hearing Date:   August 16, 2024    Dept:  29 Lee v. Coleman
19STCV03327
Defendant’s Motion to Bifurcate
Tentative
The motion is denied without prejudice.
In personal
injury hub cases, motions to bifurcate are generally heard by the trial court,
not the personal injury hub court. 
Although a motion to bifurcate is not a motion in limine, the Court orders
that the bifurcation be included in Tab B of the trial binder along with any
motion in limine filed in the case, for consideration by the trial court.  The request for bifurcation here is one for
which the trial judge should make a discretionary determination based on its power
and control over management of the trial proceedings.  
 
This order should
not be construed in any way to contradict Los Angeles County Superior Court
Local Rule 3.57(c) or to bind the trial court in any way with regarding the
motion (or making a bifurcation decision on its own motion). 
 
Moving party to
give notice.
