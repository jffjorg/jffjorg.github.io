And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to consolidate two related cases, Case Nos. 21STCV47187 and 21STCV47478. The two cases arose from the same motor vehicle accident on January 3, 2020, on the 10 Freeway in Santa Monica. The cases have common questions of law and fact, and consolidation would promote efficiency and reduce unnecessary costs and duplicative proceedings. The judge notes that no opposition has been filed and that no party contends that consolidation would cause any unfair prejudice. Therefore, the motion is granted, and Case No. 21STCV47187 is the lead case, with all future filings to be made under that case number.
