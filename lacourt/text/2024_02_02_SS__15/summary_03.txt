And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses the defendants' motions to quash service of summons for lack of personal jurisdiction. The plaintiff, Maria Lozano, alleges that she developed mesothelioma from exposure to asbestos in products from Mary Kay, Revlon, Max Factor, and Johnson & Johnson. The defendants, IMI Fabi (USA), Inc., IMI Fabi, LLC, and IMI Fabi (Diana), LLC, argue that there is no jurisdiction over them as they have no connections to California.

The plaintiff argues that the defendants have minimum contacts with California, but fails to provide specific evidence to support this claim. The judge concludes that the plaintiff has not met its burden of demonstrating jurisdiction over the defendants and grants the motions to quash. The hearing is continued to April 25, 2024, and the plaintiff is given an opportunity to file a motion to compel jurisdictional discovery.
