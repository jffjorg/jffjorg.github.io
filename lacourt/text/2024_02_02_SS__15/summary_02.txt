And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendant's motion for summary judgment. The defendant, Plastic Sales Southern, Inc., argued that the plaintiffs, Roberto E. Sotomayor and Patricia Bilgin, do not have evidence to support their claim that Sotomayor was exposed to asbestos-containing products from the defendant. The judge found that the plaintiffs' interrogatory responses were vague and lacked specific evidence, and that the defendant shifted the burden of production to the plaintiffs. The judge also found that the plaintiffs had many months to depose the defendant, but waited until six weeks after being served with the defendant's motion to serve the deposition notice. As a result, the judge granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment and ordered the defendant to file a proposed judgment within five days.
