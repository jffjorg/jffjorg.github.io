And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the Defendant's motion for summary judgment. The Plaintiffs, Randy Bronson, Ricky Bronson, Robby Bronson, and Joy Bronson, filed this action alleging that decedent Ronald Bronson developed mesothelioma from exposure to the Defendant's products. The Defendant argued that the Plaintiffs cannot establish that Ronald Bronson was exposed to asbestos in the Defendant's paint. The Judge found that the Defendant established that the paint did not contain asbestos by 1980 and that even if the paint did contain asbestos before that, the sanding of the paint did not expose Ronald Bronson to asbestos. The Plaintiffs failed to file an opposition to the motion, and therefore, the Judge found that there were no disputed issues of material fact. As a result, the motion for summary judgment is granted, and the Defendant is ordered to file a proposed judgment within five days.
