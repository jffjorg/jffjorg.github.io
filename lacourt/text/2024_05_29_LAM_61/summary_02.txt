And here is the summary in English text:

This tentative ruling grants the motion of Safora Nowrouzi, counsel for the plaintiffs Talun Hsu and Fawina Hsu, to be relieved as counsel. The court finds that there is a compelling reason to allow the withdrawal, and that the plaintiffs will not be unduly prejudiced since the trial date is scheduled sufficiently in advance. The court orders that the relief is granted effective upon the moving attorney filing with the court proof of service of a copy of the signed order on the client.
