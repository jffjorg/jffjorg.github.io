```

And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is in response to a motion filed by Defendant Kohl's, Inc. to deem requests for admission as admitted and to request sanctions against Plaintiff Vinetta Waller-Ngangu. The motion was made because Plaintiff's counsel failed to serve verified responses to Defendant's requests for admission, despite multiple extensions granted by the court. The court finds that the failure to respond to requests for admission is a misuse of the discovery process and grants the motion to deem the requests as admitted. However, the court denies the request for sanctions of $935, citing that the granting of the motion is devastating to Plaintiff's claim. The court will allow oral argument as to whether Plaintiff has obtained new counsel.
