English-text summary:

The judge has made a tentative ruling in a case involving a motion to compel the deposition of Defendant's Person Most Knowledgeable (PMK) and production of documents. The motion was filed by the Plaintiff, Dora D. Holden, against Jaguar Land Rover North America, LLC. The judge is inclined to grant the motion, but only after a delay of more than 10 days. The judge also wants to hear oral argument as to why the Opposition did not respond to the motion to compel production of 18 categories of documents to be produced at the PMK deposition. The judge has set forth specific parameters for what typically orders with respect to certain discovery requests, including production of documents related to the subject vehicle, repair orders and invoices, and communications between the parties. The judge has also sustained some of the objections to the categories of documents sought by the Plaintiff, including those related to attorney-client privilege and overbreadth. The judge will entertain oral argument as to a reasonable time period for the Defendant to gather responsive documents, especially if the PMK deposition will not take place until June of 2024.
