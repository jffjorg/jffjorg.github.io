And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on the motion filed by Apex Mechanical Services, Inc to compel further responses to requests for production of documents from Pinnacle Construction Corporation. The motion was filed due to Pinnacle's failure to respond to Apex's requests for documents related to the subject property from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2019. The judge notes that Apex has included evidence that it gave notice of the deposition subpoena for the production of business records, and that Pinnacle failed to respond to a meet and confer letter.

The judge is discussing the legal standard for obtaining discovery from non-parties, including the requirement for a deposition subpoena and the consequences of failing to comply with the subpoena. The judge is also considering the sanctions that may be imposed on Pinnacle for its failure to comply with the subpoena.

The judge's tentative ruling is that while Pinnacle did produce some responsive documents, it failed to respond to Apex's requests for earlier dates. The judge notes that the face of the subpoena does not state on its face that an affidavit of the custodian or records is required, and that Pinnacle may have reasonably believed it complied in full with the records-only subpoena.

The judge intends to entertain oral argument as to next steps to take, given the limited jurisdiction over a non-party witness for a records-only SDT. The judge also defers ruling on monetary sanctions pending the conclusion of the substantive portion of the motion.
