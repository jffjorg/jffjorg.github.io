CASE NAME:                        Casino, LLC, et al
v. Apex Mechanical Services, Inc, et al. 
¿¿ ¿¿¿ 
MOVING PARTY:                Defendant/Cross-Complainant, Apex
Mechanical Services, Inc.
¿¿¿ 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Non-Party
Deponent, Pinnacle Construction Corporation (No Opposition)  
 
TRIAL DATE:                        November 12, 2024 
¿¿¿ 
MOTION:¿                              (1) Motion to Compel Document
Production from Non-Party Deponent, Pinnacle Construction Corporation  
                                                (2) Request for
Sanctions
                                                
Tentative Rulings:                  (1) DISCUSS.  A records-only SDT of a non-party gives the Court
only limited jurisdiction over the non-party, and the face of the SDT itself
does not bring home to a self-represented non-party that a certification by a
custodian of records is required.  Exhibit
2 to the moving papers, the Compex follow-up letter, is NOT a subpoena but that
is the first mention to the responding non-party of a Custodian’s Affidavit
                                                (2) Deferred
                                                
 
 
 
I. BACKGROUND¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿ 
A. Factual¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿ 
On July 14, 2022, Plaintiffs, Casino, LLC dba Larry
Flynt’s Lucky Lady Casino and Affiliated FM Insurance Company (collectively
“Plaintiffs”) filed this action against Apex Mechanical Services, Inc, Roessler
Design Group, and DOES 1 through 10 (collectively “Defendants”) alleging a
cause of action for negligence. 
 
Per the moving papers, on July 14, 2023, Apex served
a subpoena on Pinnacle. Apex contends its process server followed up on that
subpoena three times, on July 27, 2023, August 2, 2023, and August 9, 2023.
Apex’s counsel of record contends that some responsive documents were received
via mailed flash drive on October 12, 2023.   On October 24, 2023, Apex notes it sent a
meet and confer letter to Pinnacle, requesting that Pinnacle supplement its
production. Despite this, Apex notes that Pinnacle never responded to that meet
and confer letter. 
 
As such, Apex has brought this Motion to Compel
Further Responses to Requests for production of Documents. 
 
 
 
 
B. Procedural¿¿¿ 
¿¿ 
            On
December 13, 2023, Apex filed its Motion to Compel Further Document Production
against Non-Party Deponent, Pinnacle Construction Corporation. To date, no
opposition has been filed. On February 15, 2024, Apex filed a notice of
non-opposition.
 
II. MEET AND CONFER 
 
The Court notes that Apex’s
counsel of record reached out on October 24, 2023, through certified mail, and
sent a meet and confer letter to Pinnacle to try and informally resolve the
deficiencies. (Declaration of Matthew J. Yarling (“Yarling Decl.”), ¶ 19.)
Nonetheless, Apex contends that Pinnacle never responded to the letter. 
 
III. ANALYSIS¿¿ 
 
A.    Legal Standard 
 
 [T]he process by which a nonparty is required to
provide discovery is a deposition subpoena.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2020.010,
subd. (b).)¿ 
¿ 
“A deposition subpoena may command any of the
following:¿ 
¿ 

“Only
     the attendance and the testimony of the deponent, under Article 3
     (commencing with Section 2020.310).¿ 

¿ 

“Only
     the production of business records for copying, under Article 4
     (commencing with Section 2020.410).¿ 

¿ 

“The
     attendance and the testimony of the deponent, as well as the production of
     business records, other documents, electronically stored information, and
     tangible things, under Article 5 (commencing with Section
     2020.510).”¿ 

¿ 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2020.020, subds. (a)–(c).)¿ 
¿ 
“If a deponent fails to answer any question or to produce
any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing under the
deponent’s control that is specified in the deposition notice or a deposition
subpoena, the party seeking discovery may move the court for an order
compelling that answer or production.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.480, subd.
(a).)¿ 
¿ 
“If the court determines that the answer or production
sought is subject to discovery, it shall order that the answer be given or the
production be made on the resumption of the deposition.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2025.480, subd. (i).)¿ 
 
 
B.    
Discussion 
 
In California, limited discovery is
allowed to be obtained from nonparties, including oral depositions. (Code Civ.
Proc. § 2020.010.) A party who seeks to take the oral deposition of any person
must give notice in writing. (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2025.220; 2020.010.) Here, Apex
has included that it gave notice of the Deposition subpoena for the Production
of Business Records in writing, and also attached the corresponding proof of
service, to Pinnacle. (Yarling Decl., ¶ 13.) A deposition subpoena for a
nonparty may require testimony, as well as the production of documents,
electronic information, and tangible things. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2020.020(c).)  Here, Apex sought records only, not the appearance
of a witness.
 
By this motion Apex is seeking further
responses to Request for Production of Documents, Nos. 1 and 2. RFP 1 requests
responses and documents reflecting any communication that Pinnacle had with any
person regarding the subject property from January 1, 2016 through December 31,
2019. Apex notes that Pinnacle provided virtually no responsive documents
during that time period, and the documents that were produced only ranged from
July 15, 2019 through present. As such, Apex argues Pinnacle must provide a
response, and the requested documents. 
 
Next, RFP No. 2 requested Pinnacle to
produce business records pertaining to Pinnacle’s entire job file pertaining to
the subject property from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2019. Again, Apex
asserts that Pinnacle failed to respond to this request at all, and instead,
only produced documents dating from July 15, 2019 through present. 
 
Failure to Comply with Subpoena 
 
A nonparty deponent who disobeys a
deposition subpoena under California Code of Civil Procedure § 2020.220,
subdivision (c), may be punished for contempt under the sanctions chapter
without the necessity of a prior order of court directing compliance by the
witness. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2020.240.) The nonparty deponent is also subject
to forfeiture of a sum and payment of damages provided in Code of Civil
procedure § 1992, which may be recovered in a civil action. (Code Civ. Proc. §§
1992; 2020.240.) Further, if any deponent fails to obey an order to compel
entered under section 2025.480, that failure may be considered a contempt of
court. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.480(k).) 
 
The Court’s Tentative Ruling
 
            The
moving papers indicate that SOME responsive documents were produced, but dating
back only to July 15, 2029 rather than any earlier date.  The state of the record is that the Court
does not know whether Pinnacle disobeyed the scope of the subpoena or only
produced the records it could locate for a more limited time period than the period
requested.  Because the Subpoena did not
seek the attendance of a witness, Apex had no one to question as to whether
there were other responsive documents, or whether a diligent search and reasonable
inquiry were undertaken to locate earlier records.  The face of the Subpoena indicates that
Pinnacle is ordered to produce the responsive documents; if Pinnacle had no other
responsive documents sin its possession, custody or control, then it may have
reasonably believed it complied in full with the records-only subpoena.  The form SDT does not state on its face that
an affidavit of the custodian or records is required; rather, the custodian
certification requirement is not mentioned until the bottom of page 4 of the Notice
of Deposition,  If Pinnacle had not
consulted with a lawyer and attempted to comply with lay staff and employees, the
subpoenaed party might well have no way of knowing what it needed to do beyond
sending in the records it could locate.  
 
            The
Court will entertain oral argument as to next steps to take, given that the
Court’s jurisdiction over a non-party witness for a records-only SDT is
somewhat limited.  
 
C.   
Sanctions
 
Code of Civil Procedure § 2023.030(a) provides, in
pertinent part, that the court may impose a monetary sanction on a party
engaging in the misuse of the discovery process to pay the reasonable expenses,
including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone because of that conduct. 
Misuse of discovery includes “failing to respond or submit to an authorized
method of discovery.”  (Code Civ. Proc. §¿2023.010(d)).  
 
Apex has requested monetary sanctions as against Pinnacle
in the amount of $2,200. The Court defers ruling on monetary sanctions pending the
conclusion of the substantive portion of this motion.
