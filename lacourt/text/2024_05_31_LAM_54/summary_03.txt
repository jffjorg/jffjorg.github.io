And here is the English-text summary:

The Tentative Ruling is a summary of the Judge's decision regarding the defendant Brent L. Davis' motion to quash service of summons. The motion was granted, as the defendant claimed he was not personally served with the summons, and the summons and complaint were left on the doorstep. The plaintiff, Leslee Deanes, contended that the proof of service creates a presumption of proper service. However, the defendant rebutted this presumption by claiming he was not personally served. The court found that the defendant's claim was credible, and the motion to quash was granted.
