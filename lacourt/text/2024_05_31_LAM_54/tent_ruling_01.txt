COUNSEL TO NOTICE.
 
The Court considers the moving papers
and opposition.
 
The Court may issue an order allowing
an attorney to withdraw from representation, after notice to the client.  (CCP § 284.) 
The attorney may withdraw from representation where the withdrawal would
not result in undue prejudice to the client’s interest—that is, counsel cannot
withdraw at a critical point in the litigation. 
(Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal. App. 4th 904, 915; see
California Rule of Professional Conduct 3-700.) 
 
Sherry R. Fredrick, Esq., counsel of
record for Defendants Perez Construction & Development
Corporation and Leovardo Perez
seeks to withdraw from representation of Defendants. Counsel states that
coverage counsel under Defendants’ insurance has stated there is no coverage
under the policy for this action. In opposition, Plaintiff requests that the
Court continue the August 12, 2024 trial to allow Defendants to find new
counsel. The Court will do so. As trial is continued, no prejudice will result
from counsel’s withdrawal. Counsel has complied with CRC 3.1362. 
 
The motions are GRANTED.
