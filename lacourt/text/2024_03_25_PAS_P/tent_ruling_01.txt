[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER SUSTAINING DEFENDANT’S DEMURRER TO THE COMPLAINT WITH LEAVE TO AMEND
 
Date:   March 25, 2024
Time:  8:30 a.m.
Dept.:  P



 
          I.        INTRODUCTION
          This is a purported breach of contract case. Plaintiff Tao
Lao (Lao), appearing in pro per, filed a 4-page unverified Judicial Council
complaint. Plaintiff is a resident at Naomi Gardens retirement home and
Defendant Anina Siddiqui (Siddiqui) is the manager at Naomi Gardens. 
The
complaint contains two causes of action: (1) breach of contract; and (2) common
counts.  Lao alleges in the First Cause
of Action that Defendant breached a  contract starting in 2015 by “threatening to
send plaintiff to convalescent home if plaintiff did not obey instructions.”
(Complaint Item BC-2.) As to the Second Cause of Action, Lao alleges that Defendant
stole Lao’s identity and withdrew money from her account; and that staff at
Naomi Gardens stole items from her room and intimidated her. (Complaint Item
CC-4, CC-1(b)(6).) 
Lao filed
this action on September 19, 2023. Defendant Siddiqui demurred to the Complaint
on October 17, 2023. The demurrer is currently unopposed.  Siddiqui alleges in her demurrer that both causes
of action of the Complaint fail to state a valid cause of action, and/or are
uncertain. 
          For the reasons set forth below, the demurrer is sustained
with leave to amend.
 
II.       LEGAL
STANDARD
Law
Governing Demurrers 
A
general demurrer lies where a complaint fails to state a cause of action. (CCP
§ 430.10(e).) A demurrer challenges defects appearing on the face of the
complaint or in material of which judicial notice may be taken. (CCP §
430.30.) A demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of a complaint. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004)
116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)  A demurrer
admits, provisionally for purposes of testing the pleading, all material facts
properly pleaded. (Tindell v. Murphy
(2018) 22 Cal.App.5th 1239, 1247.) Allegations need not be accepted as true if
they are contradicted by judicially noticeable facts. (Cansino v. Bank of America (2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 1462, 1474.) Unambiguous
facts appearing in exhibits attached to the complaint are judicially noticed
and given precedence over inconsistent allegations in the complaint. (See,
e.g., Dodd v. Citizens Bank of Costa Mesa (1990) 222 Cal.App.3d
1624, 1626-1627; Richtek USA, Inc. v. uPI Semiconductor Corp. (2015)
242 Cal.App.4th 651, 659-660.)
Code
Civ. Proc. Section 430.10(f) provides for a demurrer where a pleading is
uncertain. (CCP § 430.10(f).) Demurrers for uncertainty are disfavored and are
only sustained where a pleading is so incomprehensible a defendant cannot
reasonably respond. (A.J. Fistes v. GDL Best Contractors, Inc. (2019) 38
Cal.App.5th 677, 695; Khoury v.
Maly’s of California (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.)
III.     DEMURRER 
A.
 Meet and Confer 
Siddiqui
offers the meet and confer letter of her attorney in support of meet and confer
efforts prior to filing the demurrer. Siddiqui’s counsel, Robert de Spelder, spoke
to Plaintiff on October 13, 2023, in person at her residence. (De Spelder Decl.
¶ 5.) He declares that with the help of a Mandarin interpreter, he told
Plaintiff, among other things, that “the court could decide to dismiss this
suit based on the information alleged in the complaint, but that Plaintiff
wished to proceed with the action.” (Id.) 
Counsel’s
declaration is sufficient for meet and confer purposes. 
 
B.
1st Cause of Action for Breach of Contract
To
state a cause of action for breach of contract, plaintiff must allege “(1) the
existence of the contract, (2) plaintiff’s performance or excuse for
nonperformance, (3) defendant’s breach, and (4) the resulting damages to the
plaintiff.”  (Oasis West Realty, LLC v. Goldman (2011) 51 Cal.4th
811, 821.) A plaintiff suing for breach of contract must prove that she has
performed all of her obligations under the contract or was otherwise
excused. (Consolidated World Investments, Inc. v. Lido Preferred, Ltd.
(1992) 9 Cal.App.4th 373, 380 [Reichert v. General Ins. Co. (1968)
68 Cal.2d 822, 830.]) A suit for breach of contract must be filed within four
years of the date of the alleged breach. (CCP § 337.)
The
complaint states that, on or about 2015-2016, an “observation agreement” was
made between Anina Siddiqui and Naomi Gardens, and that Siddiqui was hired as
the manager of Naomi Gardens. (Complaint Item BC-1.) Plaintiff does not definitively
allege that she is a signatory to this alleged observation agreement, nor that
she is an intended beneficiary. It is unclear whether this contract is oral or
written, as Plaintiff has checked the box marked “Other” and typed “Observation.”
Indeed, nowhere does Plaintiff plead the basic terms of the agreement, or her
performance under it. Additionally, Plaintiff has not alleged that “threats” to
send her to a nursing home are a breach of this agreement. 
Additionally,
according to Plaintiff’s allegations, the alleged threats to send her to a
convalescent home occurred in 2015. (Complaint Item BC-2.) Plaintiff filed her
complaint in September of 2023, which significantly exceeds the four-year
statute of limitations for breach of contract. Plaintiff has not alleged that
the statute of limitations has been tolled for any reason. 
Defendant
Siddiqui also urges that this cause of action is uncertain. (Demurrer p. 5:
2-4.)  The standard for sustaining a
demurrer due to uncertainty is high. The Court concludes that this claim is
also uncertain.  The terms of the
purported agreement are very unclear.  
Consequently,
the demurrer to the first cause of action is sustained.  
 
C.
2nd Cause of Action for Common Counts
“A
cause of action for money had and received is stated if it is alleged [that]
the defendant is indebted to the plaintiff in a certain sum for money had and
received by the defendant for the use of the plaintiff. . . .  The claim
is viable wherever one person has received money which belongs to another, and
which in equity and good conscience should be paid over to the latter.”  (Farmers
Insurance Exchange v. Zerin (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 445, 460.) 
The
complaint purportedly alleges that Anina Siddiqui became “indebted” to Plaintiff
in the last four years for “identity theft, theft of personal effects and
intimidation.” (Complaint Item CC-1(b)(6).) The complaint alleges that
Defendant should be ordered to “To give information directly to plaintiff
about the documents she signs regarding the management of her life instead
of only speaking to plaintiff's daughter. To stop permitting staff to steal
items from plaintiff's room or using unknown substances in
plaintiff's room without first telling plaintiff what they are. To stop
using plaintiff’s identity to take money from her account without notifying
plaintiff.” (Complaint Item CC-4, emphasis added.) 
Defendant
Siddiqui urges that this cause of action is uncertain, as it is unclear when in
the last four years that these actions occurred. (Demurrer p. 5: 23-26.) This
argument is well-taken. Though the standard for a demurrer due to uncertainty
is high, the Court concludes that it is met here. (Khoury v. Maly’s of California (1993) 14
Cal.App.4th 612, 616.) It is not clear what Plaintiff is referring to in her
cause of action for common counts, whether any indebtedness was ever created, or
when any the alleged thefts occurred, by whom and what was allegedly stolen, or
indeed how such actions support a cause of action for common counts.  
Accordingly,
the demurrer to the Second Cause of Action for common counts is also sustained.

 
IV. ORDER
          The demurrer is sustained as to both causes of action of
the Complaint.  Plaintiff Tao Lao is
given 20 days to file an amended complaint. 
 
          Notice of this ruling is to be given by Defendant Siddiqui.
