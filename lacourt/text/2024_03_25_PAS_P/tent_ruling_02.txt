[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER DENYING DEFENDANT ROBERT TOROSIAN’S MOTION TO REOPEN DISCOVERY 
 
Date:   March
  25, 2024
Time:  8:30 a.m.
Dept.:  P



 
          
 
 
 
          I.        INTRODUCTION
          These related cases concern events
that transpired on April 16, 2014. For ease of reference, case no. BC616980 is
referred to as the Fitilchyan Action and case no. BC617479 as the Torosian
Action.  
In the Fitilchyan Action, Plaintiffs allege that
Arutyun Fitilchyan (Fitilchyan) was contacted by Akop Torosian (Akop) to
perform some locksmith services. Fitilchyan alleges that a disagreement occurred,
and he and Akop subsequently got into a fight at the body shop owned by Fitilchyan’s
friend, Hrachya Gasparyan (Gasparyan). Akop’s brother, Robert Torosian
(Robert), was also present.  Shots were
fired, and several people were seriously injured.  
In Case No. BC617479, which was filed two days after
the Fitilchyan Action, the Torosian brothers allege that the meeting at the
body shop was a “set up” and that Akop and Robert were ambushed. The Torosians further
allege that following the shooting, defendant Armen Tashjian and others attempted
to extort money from Akop and Robert. The Torosian Action has since resolved,
due to the issuance of various pretrial motions and dismissals.  
          Before the Court
is a motion to reopen discovery in the Fitilchyan action. Defendant Robert
Torosian filed the motion March 1, 2024. Plaintiffs filed an opposition on
March 12, 2024. Akop Torosian filed a joinder to the motion on March 18, 2024. Defendant
filed a reply on March 18, 2024. 
For
the reasons that follow, the motion is DENIED.
 
II.       LEGAL
STANDARD
          CCP § 2024.020(a) states “[e]xcept as otherwise provided in
this chapter, any party shall be entitled as a matter of right to complete
discovery proceedings on or before the 30th day, and to have motions concerning
discovery heard on or before the 15th day, before the date initially set for
the trial of the action.” Additionally, “a continuance or postponement of the
trial date does not operate to reopen discovery proceedings,” unless a motion
to reopen discovery is filed and granted pursuant to CCP § 2024.050. (CCP
§ 2024.020(b); see also Pelton-Shepherd Industries, Inc. v. Delta Packaging
Products, Inc. (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 1568.)   
The
reopening of discovery is a matter that is committed to the trial court’s  discretion. (See CCP § 2024.050(a)-(b).)¿ In
exercising that discretion, the trial court considers “any matter relevant to
the leave requested,” including but not limited to:¿ 
 
“(1) The necessity and the
reasons for the discovery.¿ 
(2) The diligence or lack of
diligence of the party seeking the discovery or the hearing of a discovery
motion, and the reasons that the discovery was not completed or that the
discovery motion was not heard earlier.¿ 
(3) Any likelihood that
permitting the discovery or hearing the discovery motion will prevent the case
from going to trial on the date set, or otherwise interfere with the trial
calendar, or result in prejudice to any other party.¿ 
(4) The length of time that
has elapsed between any date previously set, and the date presently set, for
the trial of the action.” (CCP § 2024.050(b).)¿ 
 
          III. MEET AND CONFER 
          A motion filed under CCP Section 2024.050 requires a meet
and confer declaration pursuant to CCP Section 2016.040. (CCP § 2024.050(a).) 
          In this connection, Robert offers the declaration of his
counsel, Edye Hill. (Hill Declaration.) Ms. Hill declares that she sent a meet
and confer letter to opposing counsel by email on February 29, 2024. (Hill
Decl. ¶ 27, see Exh. GG.)  The motion was
filed the following day.
          However, upon careful examination of the February 29, 2024
letter, despite citation to the meet and confer requirement, the letter states
only “Defendant Robert Torosian intends to file a motion to reopen discovery so
that the depositions and defense medical examinations of the plaintiffs can be
completed before trial.” (Exh. GG to Hill Decl. p. 247.)  It does not discuss the merits/grounds of the
motion or otherwise demonstrate a good faith attempt to resolve the issues presented
by the motion. (See CCP § 2016.040.)  
          This sole communication, sent the day before the motion was
filed, does not satisfy the meet and confer requirement.  Nevertheless, the Court declines to deny the
motion on this basis.   
 
          IV. BELATED JOINDER BY AKOP TOROSIAN
          Defendant Akop
Torosian filed a notice of joinder and joinder to this motion on March 18, 2024,
the same day Robert’s reply was due.  The
Court has read and considered the belated joinder.  
          
V.     RELEVANT PROCEDURAL HISTORY
          This case has had
an incredibly lengthy, difficult history. 
Fitilchyan and Gasparyan and their spouses filed the Fitilchyan
Action on April 14, 2016 against Robert and Akop Torosian. On September 27,
2016, the case was deemed to be a “complicated” PI case, and it was transferred
from the Stanley Mosk Courthouse to Glendale. On November 8, 2016, the first Judge
assigned to the case, the Honorable Laura A. Matz, set the initial trial date
for April 10, 2017.  
On January
27, 2017, the case was stayed on a limited basis, and the April 10, 2017 trial
date was vacated.  On April 17, 2017, both
cases were stayed in their entirety due to pending criminal matters related to
the civil cases.  
On
September 6, 2018, the cases were transferred to the Honorable Ralph C.
Hofer.  For over two and a half years Judge
Hofer conducted a number of status conferences, at one point temporarily lifting
the stay, but later reimposing it.  On
March 17, 2021, the Torosians (who had until now been proceeding in pro
per in both cases) had the law firm of Stratman, Schwartz &
Williams-Abrego substitute in to represent them in the Fitilchyan Action. 
On
April 7, 2021, the stay in the case was finally lifted. On April 21, 2021, Judge
Hofer re-set the trial date for March 7, 2022 -- approximately eleven months later.

On
July 22, 2021, Robert Torosian had new counsel, Thomas M. Phillips from The
Phillips Firm, substitute in to represent him. 
On August 5, 2021, the law firm of Lewis, Brisbois, Bisgaard &
Smith, LLP associated as co-counsel for Akop Torosian.  
On
December 16, 2021, Judge Hofer conducted a hearing concerning several scheduling
matters.[1]  After conferring with counsel, on his own
motion, Judge Hofer continued the trial date from March 7, 2022 to October 17,
2022.  
On
May 17, 2022, Judge Hofer conducted a “Status Conference Re Mediation and
Discovery” with the parties in the Fitilchyan Action.  Mark Ringsmuth from The Phillips Firm
appeared for Robert Torosian; and Robert was also present on Court
Connect.  Judge Hofer’s Clerk noted the
following in the minute order:  “Counsel
inform [sic] the Court that written discovery has been completed.”  
From
July 2021 to May of 2022, counsel from The Phillips Firm filed three Case
Management Statements on behalf of Robert Torosian.  In Section 16 of the Statements relating to
discovery, Robert’s counsel indicated that he would be conducting various forms
of discovery, including taking depositions of the Plaintiffs and conducting
medical examinations, “Per Code.”
On
August 17, 2022, as the result of an oral stipulation of the parties, Judge
Hofer continued the trial again, from October 17, 2022 to March 27, 2023. 
On
October 10, 2022, both cases were reassigned to the Pasadena Courthouse, to the
Honorable Margaret L. Oldendorf.   
The
parties apparently engaged in a number of communications back and forth
regarding the scheduling of depositions. 
Ultimately, Fitilchyan and Gasparyan filed motions to compel the
depositions of the Torosians; and Robert filed a motion to compel the
depositions of Fitilchyan and Gasparyan. 
This Court denied the motions seeking orders compelling Robert’s deposition,
as well as the depositions of Fitilchyan and Gasparyan, because there was no
showing that they in fact failed to appear on specific dates pursuant to notice
or agreement.  The Court did grant the Plaintiff’s
motion to compel as to Akop Torosian, because he did fail to appear for his
remote deposition on June 22, 2021.  The
Court ordered Akop to appear for his deposition within twenty days of January
1, 2023.[2]    
On
January 9, 2023, Robert Torosian’s counsel apparently served further deposition
notices for the depositions of Fitilchyan and Gasparyan.  On January 31, 2023, he obtained certificates
of non-appearance for these depositions.[3]  However, Robert never filed a motion to
compel the depositions based on this non-appearance.
On
February 28, 2023, again pursuant to stipulation, this Court granted a further
continuance of the trial, from March 27, 2023, to October 31, 2023.  Counsel represented that the reason for the
continuance was the complexity of the case, and the need to take numerous
physician depositions.  The Court noted
in the minute order that the “[d]iscovery and motion dates and deadlines are to
follow the new trial date.”[4]   
The
Court conducted a Status Conference on June 23, 2023.  The Court emphasized that the final status conference
and trial dates were to remain as set.  
On
August 25, 2023, Robert filed an ex parte application to continue the trial, in
part due to the need to take numerous depositions.  This Court denied the application, and noted:  “There is no good cause showing why so much
discovery is occurring so late in this case.” (Minute Order 8/28/23.)
On
August 29, 2023 -- one day after his continuance request was denied, Robert apparently
served another set of deposition notices for  Fitilchyan and Gasparyan.  His counsel also served requests for medical
examinations on both Plaintiffs.  Robert’s
counsel also served deposition notices as to Plaintiffs Arzumanova and
Hovhanissyan on September 6, 2023. 
On
September 11, 2023, Robert served amended notices for the medical examinations of
Fitilchyan and Gasparyan, to take place on September 20, 2023 and September 21,
2023, respectively. Neither Plaintiff appeared for their examinations.[5]  Robert filed motions to compel the
depositions on September 26, 2023.  The
hearing was set for October 27, 2023 -- four days before trial was scheduled to
commence.   
On
October 9, 2023, this Court denied another ex parte application by the Torosians
to continue the trial and the discovery cutoff and related dates.  
At
the Final Status Conference on October 19, 2023, the Court noted that a number
of pretrial documents (especially those filed by the Torosians) were filed only
a day or two before the FSC. 
Accordingly, the Court continued the FSC to the trial date of October
31, 2023, to be heard immediately prior to the start of trial.    
On
October 25, 2023, Defendant Akop Torosian filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition
in his home state of Florida.  As a
consequence, the Court stayed the Fitilchyan Action and vacated the trial and all
other dates.  
On November
16, 2023, Robert’s counsel filed a Substitution of Attorney.  The law firm of MacDonald and Cody
substituted in as his counsel in place of The Phillips Firm.  On March 1, 2023, Robert’s new counsel filed
the instant motion to reopen discovery, and scheduled it for hearing on April
30, 2024.
On
March 8, 2024, this Court lifted the stay in its entirety, because the
Bankruptcy Court dismissed Akop’s bankruptcy petition.  The court set a Status Conference for March
25, 2024, and advanced Robert’s motion to reopen discovery to the same
date.  
 
 
VI.
ANALYSIS
Robert
Torosian urges that discovery should be reopened, as he sought the Plaintiffs’ depositions
before the case was stayed, and was unable to obtain discovery during the bankruptcy
stay. (Motion p. 11: 4-6; see also Hill Decl., Exhs. G-AA.)  He urges that these depositions and medical
examinations seek relevant information as to Plaintiffs’ personal injuries and
damages.  
Secondly,
Robert argues that permitting this discovery will not affect the current trial
date, as one has not yet been set after the most recent stay. (3/8/24 Minute
Order.)
Thirdly,
Robert urges he has been diligent in seeking discovery, as he sought the
discovery before the latest stay; and he served many notices of deposition
prior to the bankruptcy stay. (See Motion p. 13: 6-22.) 
Robert
also urges that permitting discovery will not prejudice Plaintiffs as there is
no currently scheduled trial date, and he is entitled to conduct discovery concerning
Plaintiffs’ claims and damages. (Motion p. 13: 23.) Robert urges that he will
suffer severe prejudice if discovery is not reopened. (Motion p. 14: 14-24.) 
Robert
then urges that the fourth factor of CCP Section 2024.050 weighs in favor of
reopening discovery as there have been five trial dates set in the case, with various
continuances and stays occurring throughout the history of the litigation.  (Motion p. 15: 4-9.)
Lastly,
Robert urges that public policy favors trying the case on its merits.  He cites  Hernandez v. Superior Court (2004) 115
Cal.App.4th 1242, 1246-1247 in support of this argument.   
In
opposition, Plaintiffs argue strenuously that this motion should be
denied.  Plaintiffs argue that the motion
to reopen is in effect an improper motion for reconsideration, as the Court has
previously denied the same relief twice. (Opposition p. 8: 23-26.)  Plaintiffs also urge that the motion untimely,
because it is being presented well past the previous discovery cutoff, and more
than fifteen days after the deadline for discovery motions based on the last
trial date. (See CCP § 2024.020(a); see also Opposition p. 9: 11-21.)
Plaintiffs also argue the fact that the Torosians sought to conduct discovery shortly
prior to the bankruptcy stay is not a sufficient justification for reopening
discovery now. (See Opposition p. 10: 3-4.) 
Plaintiffs
argue in particular that the Torosians have failed to proceed with diligence in
pursuing discovery.  They argue that the
factors set forth in CCP Section 2024.050(b) do not support the request to
reopen.  (Opposition p. 12: 11- p. 16:
2.)  Plaintiffs argue that  “the prejudice to Plaintiffs will be real and
will be severe, and restarting discovery from scratch will lead to extensive
further litigation, extensive discovery motions, great expense, further
imposition on this Court, and a lengthy delay of trial.” (Opposition p. 14:
24-26.) 
In
reply, Robert’s counsel urges that “[t]he Opposition focuses on the failures of
prior defense counsel and the age of this case.” (See Reply p. 2: 8.) He
further argues “Defendant is represented by new counsel who substituted in
after discovery was closed and Defendant should not be punished for the sins of
his prior legal representation.” (Reply p. 2: 13-14.) 
The
Court agrees with Plaintiffs that Torosian has not shown good cause to reopen
discovery.  Even taking into account the
lengthy stay due to the criminal proceedings, the parties have had over three
years during the life of this action to conduct discovery and to bring
necessary motions to compel, etc. 
Frankly, none of the parties involved in the Fitilchyan Action have proceeded
with the diligence and effort that a case of this type warrants.  As set forth in the procedural history set
forth in Section V above, the Torosians have had more than ample opportunity to
conduct discovery and prepare for trial. 
Torosian’s lack of diligence is significant; and he has failed to
provide the Court with any real justification as to why he has been unable to
complete discovery within the required time.[6]  
Given
the chronology of events in this case; the length of time that has elapsed
between the start of the case and the present; the amount of time that was
available for discovery to have been conducted; the fact that the latest stay
due to Akop’s bankruptcy occurred on the eve of the previously-scheduled trial
date; the significant lack of diligence on the part of Defendants in pursuing
discovery; and the potential prejudice to Plaintiffs if the motion is granted; the
Court declines to find good cause to reopen discovery. 
 
VII.    CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
          For the foregoing reasons, Defendant Robert Torosian’s
motion to reopen discovery is denied.  The Court schedules a Trial Setting Conference
for __________, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. in this Department.
          Counsel for Plaintiffs are ordered
to give notice of this ruling.
