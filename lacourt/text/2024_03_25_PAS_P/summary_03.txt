And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge, Judge Hofer, has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving multiple plaintiffs and the Torosians. The parties had previously disagreed on the priority of taking depositions, with the plaintiffs' counsel believing that he should take the depositions of the Torosians first. The Torosians had previously opposed consolidation of the actions, but later changed their position and requested consolidation, which was denied. Akop, a party to the case, failed to appear for his deposition, and no subsequent motion to compel was filed. The judge is not persuaded that the motion should be granted based on the presumed "sins" of the Torosians' prior counsel, and instead declines to grant relief under CCP Section 473(b).
