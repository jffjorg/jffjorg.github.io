Among other things, Judge Hofer discussed with the parties the possible
consolidation of the actions.  No
consensus was ever reached on this issue, so the cases remained related but not
consolidated.  It was not until extremely
late in the history of both cases that the Torosians formally sought to
consolidate them.  This request (which
was a reversal from prior positions taken by the Torosians in the Fitilchyan
Action) was denied by this Court.

Akop apparently never appeared for his deposition.  The record does not reflect that Plaintiffs
filed any subsequent motion to compel.               


[3]
The parties disagreed about the priority for the taking of the
depositions.  Plaintiffs’ counsel took
the position that, because he had apparently noticed the depositions of the
Torosians first, he should be entitled to complete those depositions before the
Torosians took the depositions of Plaintiffs.


[4]
Up until this point, the previous continuance orders did not specifically
indicate whether the discovery cutoff and other deadlines tracked the new trial
date; although the Court presumes that this was the case.


[5]
It appears the parties were never able to resolve their disagreement regarding
the order of taking depositions.  


[6]
The Court is not persuaded that it should grant the motion based upon the presumed
“sins” of Torosian’s prior counsel. 
Robert has been represented by three reputable firms in this case since
March of 2021.  To the extent his current
counsel is making an indirect request for relief under CCP Section 473(b), the
Court declines to find, based on the evidence set forth in this motion, that
such relief would be warranted.
