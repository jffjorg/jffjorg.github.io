And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Defendant Robert Torosian's motion to reopen discovery in the case of Fitilchyan et al. v. Torosian et al. The judge finds that the motion is untimely and that the parties have had ample opportunity to conduct discovery and prepare for trial over the past three years. The judge also notes that the defendants have failed to proceed with diligence in pursuing discovery and that the motion does not demonstrate good cause for reopening discovery. The judge orders a trial setting conference for a future date and schedules a hearing to determine the next steps in the case.
