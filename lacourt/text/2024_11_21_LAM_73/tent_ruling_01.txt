I. BACKGROUND
 
On June 9, 2023, Plaintiff American Express National Bank brought
this action against Defendant Jonathan Castillo aka Jonathan M. Castillo. 
 
The Complaint alleges a cause of action for Common Counts.

Plaintiff on an open book account. Plaintiff issued credit to Defendant for
purchases and/or cash advances on a credit account ending in 1007. Defendant
was billed periodically. Plaintiff alleges it has performed all terms and

On August 21, 2024, Plaintiff filed its Motion for Summary
Judgment or alternatively Summary Adjudication.  
 
No opposition
has been filed.
 
II. ANALYSIS
 
A.      Legal
Standard 
 
 “A party may move for summary adjudication of issues, either
by itself or as an alternative to summary judgment. If it appears that the
proof supports the granting of the motion for summary adjudication as to some
but not all the issues involved in the action, or that one or more of the
issues raised by a claim is admitted, or that one or more of the issues raised
by a defense is conceded, the court shall, by order, specify that those issues
are without substantial controversy. Moreover, upon a motion for summary
adjudication, the court shall, by written order or oral order recorded
verbatim, specify those issues raised by the motion for summary adjudication as
to which there exists a material, triable controversy, and shall specifically
refer to the evidence which establishes a triable issue of fact regarding each
of those issues ....”  (Cal.
Code. Civ. Proc. § 437c(f)).   
 
A plaintiff moving for summary
judgment/summary adjudication bears the initial burden of showing that “there
is no defense to a cause of action if that party has proved each element of the
cause of action entitling the party to judgment on the cause of action.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(1).) “Plaintiff's¿initial¿burden¿of proof in
moving for summary judgment, however, d[oes] not include disproving any
affirmative defenses asserted by defendants.”  (Oldcastle Precast, Inc. v.
Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Co.¿(2009) 170 Cal.App.4th 554, 564, citing Aguilar
v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 853 (“Aguilar”) [“summary judgment
law in this state no longer requires a¿plaintiff¿moving for summary judgment to
disprove any defense asserted by the defendant as well as prove each element of
his own cause of action.... All that the¿plaintiff¿need do is to ‘prove[ ] each element of the cause of action’ ”])  Once Plaintiff meets its
initial burden of proving each element of the cause of action, “the burden shifts
to the defendant “to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts
exists as to that cause of action¿or a defense thereto.” (Ibid.) 
 
As noted in Aguilar, “the party
moving for summary judgment bears an initial burden of production to make a
prima facie showing of the nonexistence of any triable issue of material fact;
if he carries his burden of production, he causes a shift, and the opposing
party is then subjected to a burden of production of his own to make a prima
facie showing of the existence of a triable issue of material fact.”  (Aguilar,
supra, 25 Cal.4th at 850.)  Thus, courts usually follow a three-step
analysis: “First, we identify the issues framed by the pleadings .
. . . [¶]
Secondly, we determine whether the moving party’s showing has established facts
which negate the opponent’s claim and justify a judgment in movant’s favor.
. . . [¶] When a
. . . motion prima facie justifies a judgment, the third and final step is to
determine whether the opposition demonstrates the existence of a triable,
material factual issue.”  (Ojavan Investors, Inc. v. Cal. Coastal Comm.
(1997) 54 Cal.App.4th
373, 385 [citation and footnote omitted].) 
 
The California Supreme Court has
recently confirmed that the purpose of the 1992 and 1993 amendments to the
summary judgment statute was “‘to liberalize the granting of [summary judgment]
motions.’” (Perry v. Bakewell Hawthorne, LLC (2017) 2 Cal.5th 536,
542.)  It is no longer called a “disfavored” remedy.  “Summary
judgment is now seen as a ‘particularly suitable means to test the sufficiency’
of the plaintiff’s or defendant’s case.”  (Ibid.) 
 
Opposing parties must present
substantial evidence in order to avoid summary judgment.  (Sangster v. Paetkau (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 151,
163.)  “In some instances…, ‘evidence may be so lacking in
probative value that it fails to raise any triable issue.’”  (Whitmire
v. Ingersoll-Rand Co. (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 1078, 1083-1084.)  “A
complete failure of proof concerning an essential element of the nonmoving
party's case necessarily renders all other facts immaterial.”  (Hunter
v. Pacific Mechanical Corp (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1282, 1286, disapproved on
other grounds by Aguilar, supra, at 865; accord Saelzler v. Advanced Group 400 (2001) 25 Cal.4th 763, 780 [“‘If the
plaintiff is unable to meet her burden of proof regarding an essential element
of her case, all other facts are rendered immaterial.’”].) 
 
Courts “construe the moving party's affidavits strictly,
construe the opponent's affidavits liberally, and resolve doubts about the¿propriety¿of granting the motion in favor of the party opposing
it.’” (Unilab Corp.v.
Angeles-IPA (2016) 244 Cal.App.4th 622, 636; internal citation omitted.)  “The court focuses
on issue finding; it does not resolve issues of fact. The court seeks to find
contradictions in the evidence, or inferences reasonably deducible from the
evidence, which raise a triable issue of material fact.”  (Johnson v.
United Cerebral Palsy, etc. (2009) 173 Cal.App.4th 740, 754; internal
citation omitted.)    "[S]ummary judgment cannot be
granted when the facts are susceptible [of] more than one reasonable
inference...” (Rosas v. BASF Corp.¿(2015) 236 Cal.App.4th 1378, 1392.) 
 
B.      Discussion
 
Plaintiff
moves for summary judgment of the Complaint’s cause of action for common
counts.
 
“A book account may furnish the basis for an
action on a common count . . . when it contains a statement of the debits and
credits of the transactions involved completely enough to supply evidence from
which it can be reasonably determined what amount is due to the claimant.  A book account is described as ‘open’ when
the debtor has made some payment on the account, leaving a balance due.”  (Interstate Group Administrators, Inc. v.
Cravens, Dargan & Co. (1985) 174 Cal.App.3d 700, 708, cleaned up.)
 
“The essential elements of an account stated
are: (1) previous transactions between the parties establishing the
relationship of debtor and creditor; (2) an agreement between the parties,
express or implied, on the amount due from the debtor to the creditor; (3) a
promise by the debtor, express or implied, to pay the amount due.”  (Zinn v. Fred R. Bright Co. (1969) 271
Cal.App.2d 597, 600; Leighton v. Forster (2017) 8 Cal.App.5th 467, 491.)
 
Plaintiff contends that Defendant has incurred
a balance on the credit account issued by Plaintiff and that Defendant has
failed to make the required monthly payments. Plaintiff has filed this suit to
recover the unpaid balance. Plaintiff asserts there exists no disputed issues
of material fact. In support, Plaintiff relies on the declaration of Gabriel J.
Montano. However, it appears Plaintiff inadvertently failed to file the
complete declaration. Plaintiff only filed the cover page of Gabriel J.
Montano’s declaration. Therefore, Plaintiff has failed to provide evidence
establishing each element of its case and thus, Plaintiff has not carried its
initial burden. 
 
Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment is DENIED without prejudice.
 
III. DISPOSITION

 
Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment is DENIED without
prejudice.
