TENTATIVE RULING
 
Defendants’ special
motion to strike is GRANTED. Paragraphs
72 and 78 of the Plaintiff’s Complaint are stricken.
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
On
July 25, 2024, Plaintiff Antonio Varillas Ramirez filed this action against Defendants Joe’s
Pizza on Sunset, LLC (“Joe’s Pizza”) and Giuseppe Vitale (“Vitale”).
 
The
Complaint alleges the following causes of action:
1.     
Discrimination in Violation of Government Code §§12940 et seq.; 
2.     
Harassment in Violation of Government Code §§12940 et seq.; 
3.     
Retaliation in Violation of Government Code §§12940 et seq.; 
4.     
Failure to Prevent Discrimination, Harassment and Retaliation in
Violation of Government Code §§12940(k); 
5.     
Failure to Provide Reasonable Accommodations in Violation of
Government Code §§12940 et seq.; 
6.     
Failure to Engage in a Good Faith Interactive Process in Violation
of Government Code §§12940 et seq.; 
7.     
Declaratory Judgment;
8.     
Wrongful Constructive Termination in Violation of Public Policy;
9.     
Retaliation for Disclosing Violations of Law;
10. 
Failure to Pay Wages;
11. 
Failure to Pay Overtime Compensation;
12. 
Failure to Provide Meal and Rest Periods;
13. 
Failure to Provide Itemized Wage Statements;
14. 
Waiting Time Penalties;
15. 
Unfair Competition; and
16. 
Denial of Discrimination Based Upon the Use of Sick Leave.
 
The Complaint alleges the following. From on or about 2002 to 2009, the Plaintiff worked for Defendants
as a full-time, nonexempt General Laborer. On or about July 13, 2022, the
Plaintiff was rehired by Defendants as a full-time nonexempt General Laborer.
The Plaintiff performed the duties of a Dishwasher, Prep Cook, Pizza Maker, and
Customer Service Representative. Plaintiff alleges Defendants violated various
labor codes during Plaintiff’s employment, including not providing Plaintiff
uninterrupted meal periods and rest breaks and refusing to pay Plaintiff the
legal minimum wage. Further, on or about February 9, 2023, the Plaintiff
injured his back and subsequently began to experience pain which made it
difficult to perform his job duties. Plaintiff informed his supervisors,
including Vitale, and Plaintiff requested accommodations. Defendants did not
attempt to accommodate the Plaintiff's disability. On approximately February 13, 2023, the Plaintiff filed a Workers’
Compensation claim against Joe’s Pizza for his February 9, 2023, injury.
Plaintiff’s healthcare provider gave Plaintiff work restrictions and
thereafter, Defendants reduced Plaintiff’s hours due to Plaintiff’s
accommodations. On or about May 3, 2023, Plaintiff alleges he was effectively
compelled to resign from his job due to an unacceptable level of wage
deprivation.
 
On October 28, 2024, Defendants filed the instant special motion
to strike, arguing:
·      
Defendants
seek an order striking paragraphs 72 and 78 of the Complaint
·      
First
Prong – Protected Activity
o  
The
actions described in Paragraphs 72 and 78 are settlement communications.
Paragraphs 72 and 78 of Plaintiff’s Complaint provide: 
§ 
72. From approximately February 14, 2023, until the Plaintiff’s
constructive termination VITALE contacted the Plaintiff approximately three to
four times and requested that the Plaintiff drop his workers’ compensation
claim in exchange for the previous work schedule. The Plaintiff rejected this
proposal each time. In response, VITALE would ask the Plaintiff how much it
would cost to drop the workers’ compensation case. The Plaintiff would not
respond as he did not intend to drop the workers' compensation claim. 
§ 
78. After the Plaintiff’s constructive termination, VITALE offered
the Plaintiff $20,000 to drop his workers’ compensation case. [Complaint ¶72,
78]
o  
These
settlement communications are protected activity under Civil Code § 47(b) and
cannot form the basis for recovery of any kind.
o  
It
is well settled that settlement communications are protected activity. Optional
Capital, Inc. v. Akin Gump Strauss, Hauer & Feld LLP (2017) 18 Cal.App.5th
95, 111 (“because settlement negotiations are regarded as an exercise of the
right to petition, communications during such negotiations are regarded as
having been made in connection with the underlying lawsuit for purposes of
section 425.16, subdivision (e)(2) “); Bonni v. St. Joseph Health System (2021)
11 Cal.5th 995, 1024 (“Settlement negotiations while a suit is pending are
likewise protected; they involve communications in connection with a matter
pending before or under consideration by an official body, and so fall within
the scope of section 425.16, subdivision (e)(2).”); Alfaro v. Waterhouse
Management Corp. (2022) 82 Cal.App.5th 26, 36-37 (same); Crossroads Investors,
L.P. v. Federal National Mortgage Assn., (2017) 13 Cal. App. 5th 757, 782
(“Settlement discussions made in connection with litigation are protected
activity under the anti-SLAPP statute”); Knoell v. Petrovich (1999) 76
Cal.App.4th 164 (demand letter is absolutely privileged)
o  
Paragraphs
72 and 78 of Plaintiff’s Complaint must be stricken as they are based upon
Defendants settlement offers and efforts to settle the worker’s compensation
claim.
·      
Second
Prong – Plaintiff Can Not Demonstrate A Probability of Prevailing Based Upon
Paragraphs 72 and 78
o  
First,
an employer offering an employee money to settle a case is not harassing.
Plaintiff cannot demonstrate a probability of prevailing on his claim that his
employer harassed him by offering him $20,000.
o  
Second,
because the complained of activity is the making of settlement offers, any
claim is barred by the litigation privilege of Civil Code 47(b). The privilege
of Civil Code §47(b) provides there is no tort liability for any communication
1) made in judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings; 2) by litigants or other
participants authorized by law; 3) to achieve the objects of the litigation; 4)
that have some connection or logical relation to the action. Silberg v.
Anderson, (1990), 50 Cal.3d 205, 212.
 
Plaintiffs filed an opposition, arguing: 
·       Step One: Plaintiff’s Claim Does Not Arise From Protected
Conduct
o  
Paragraph 72 and 78 should not be
stricken, as requested by Defendant’s Motion, as they are based on resignation
and general waiver demands in a separate litigation within a different forum
(i.e. Defendant requested that Plaintiff dismiss his worker’s compensation
claim which is litigated in a forum separate from the current forum). 
o  
A separate litigation in a different
forum, such as a separate personal injury or worker’s compensation action, is
not within the scope of Anti-SLAPP. See Truestone, Inc. v. Simi West Industrial Park
(1984) 163 Cal. App. 3d 715, 725 (Cal. 1984). Under California law, while more
narrow of an application than federal law, where a resignation/general waiver
demand is not offered as part of, or for purposes of resolving a future or
pending civil matter, but only in connection to resolving a separate litigation
in a different forum (e.g., a separate personal injury or worker's compensation
action), the resignation demand is admissible under California law. Id.
·       Step Two: Even if the Anti-SLAPP Statute Applies, Defendant’s
Conduct is Highly Relevant to the Litigation and is Therefore Discoverable
o  
Paragraphs 72 and 78 demonstrate two
admissions on Defendant’s part, and therefore establish their overwhelming
relevancy to this case: 
§ 
(1) that Plaintiff’s work hours were
available and should have always been given to him but were being withheld for
a non-legitimate business reason (i.e. his protected status/activities); and 
§ 
(2) that Defendant’s state of
mind/intent was malicious and oppressive; instead of doing the right thing by
meeting its legal obligation to remedy discrimination/retaliation, Defendant
tried to leverage an unrelated/separate legal right (that to medical treatment/compensation
for a workplace injury) as a condition of meeting said legal obligations and/or
ceasing its conduct in discriminating/retaliating against Plaintiff.
o  
Where an allegation(s) or evidence is
highly relevant to the case, it becomes discoverable and could potentially be
used as evidence in a case.
·       The Court must deny Defendant’s motion and issue an order
awarding Plaintiff $2,486.76 for opposing this motion.
 
Defendants filed a reply, arguing:
·      
The law is clear that settlement communications are protected
activity, meaning they may not form the basis of a lawsuit.
o   The cases
that Plaintiff relies on are irrelevant. The cases hold that in certain
circumstances, settlement communications may be discoverable or even
admissible. However, the cases are not Anti-SLAPP cases. 
·      
As set forth in Code of Civil Procedure §
425.16 (e)(2), Anti-SLAPP Motions, apply to any "act in furtherance of a
person's right of petition or free speech under the United States or California
Constitution in connection with a public issue" includes . . . (2) any
written or oral statement or writing made in connection with an issue under
consideration or review by a legislative, executive, or judicial body, or any
other official proceeding authorized by law.” There is nothing in the statute that
states that it does not apply to settlement of different issues or different
forums.
·      
A claim for liability based upon settlement
communications or the making of settlement offers is barred by the litigation
privilege of Civil Code 47(b). Because Defendants’ conduct was privileged under Civil Code §47, Plaintiff cannot
meet his burden to demonstrate a probability of prevailing on this claim.
 
II. ANALYSIS
 
A.      Legal
Standard 
 
Code of Civil Procedure
section 425.16 permits the court to strike causes of action arising from an act
in furtherance of the defendant’s right of free speech or petition unless the
plaintiff establishes that there is a probability that the plaintiff will
prevail on the claim.  
 
An
anti-SLAPP motion may be used to strike allegations of protected activity, even
if the motion does not defeat the entire cause of action. (Baral v. Schnitt
(2016) 1 Cal.5th 375, 385-390, disapproving Mann v. Quality Old Time
Service, Inc. (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 90 and its progeny).
 
In assessing a defendant’s
section 425.16 special motion to strike, the court must engage in a two-step
process.¿ (Shekhter v. Financial Indem. Co. (2001) 89 Cal.App.4th 141,
150.)¿ First, the court must decide whether the defendant has met the threshold
burden of showing that the plaintiff’s cause of action arises from the
defendant’s constitutional rights of free speech or petition for redress of
grievances.  (Id.)  This burden may be met by showing the act
which forms the basis for the plaintiff's cause of action was an act that falls
within one of the four categories of conduct set forth in 425.16, subdivision
(e).¿  
 
If the defendant meets his
initial burden and establishes that the anti-SLAPP statute applies, the burden
then shifts to the plaintiff to demonstrate a probability that the plaintiff
will prevail on the claim.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 425.16, subd. (b); Equilon
Enters. LLC v. Consumer Cause, Inc. (2002) 29 Cal.4th 53, 67 (Equilon.) 
“[T]he plaintiff must demonstrate that the complaint is both legally sufficient
and supported by a sufficient prima facie showing of facts to sustain a
favorable judgment if the evidence submitted by the plaintiff is
credited.”  (Matson v. Dvorak (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 539, 548 (Matson)
(internal quotations omitted).)   
¿ 
In making its
determination of the anti-SLAPP motion, the court shall consider the pleadings,
and supporting and opposing affidavits stating the facts upon which the
liability or defense is based.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 425.16, subd.
(b)(2).)¿
Conversely, if the evidence relied upon cannot be admitted at trial,
because it is categorically barred or undisputed factual circumstances show
inadmissibility, the court may not consider it in the face of an
objection.  If an evidentiary objection is made, the plaintiff may attempt
to cure the asserted defect or demonstrate the defect is curable.”  (Sweetwater
Union High School Dist. v. Gilbane Building Co. (2019) 6 Cal.5th 931, 949.) 
 
The court properly
considers the evidentiary submissions of both the plaintiff and the defendant,
but it may not weigh the credibility or comparative strength of the evidence
and must instead simply determine whether the plaintiff's evidence would, if believed
by the trier of fact, be sufficient to result in a judgment for
plaintiff.  (McGarry v. Univ. of San Diego (2007) 154 Cal.App.4th
97, 10809.)  The court “accepts as true the evidence favorable to the
plaintiff and evaluates the defendant’s evidence only to determine if it has
defeated that submitted by the plaintiff as a matter of law.”¿ (Flatley v.
Mauro (2006) 39 Cal.4th 299, 326.)¿ Further, whether or not the evidence is
in conflict in the context of a motion to strike under the antiSLAPP statute,
if the plaintiff has presented a sufficient pleading and has presented evidence
showing that a prima facie case will be established at trial, the plaintiff is
entitled to proceed.  (Moore v. Shaw (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 182,
193.)  Only a minimal showing of merit is required.  (Robinzine v.
Vicory (2006) 143 Cal.App.4th 1416, 1421.) 
 
B.      First Prong
–Arising from Protected Activity 
Defendants
argue that Paragraphs 72 and 78 of the Complaint constitute protected activity
because they are based on Defendants’ settlement negotiations.
Paragraphs 72
and 78 of the Complaint allege the following: 
“72. From
approximately February 14, 2023, until the Plaintiff’s constructive termination
VITALE contacted the Plaintiff approximately three to four times and requested
that the Plaintiff drop his workers’ compensation claim in exchange for the
previous work schedule. The Plaintiff rejected this proposal each time. In
response, VITALE would ask the Plaintiff how much it would cost to drop the
workers’ compensation case. The Plaintiff would not respond as he did not
intend to drop the workers' compensation claim.” (Complaint ¶ 72.)
“78. After
the Plaintiff’s constructive termination, VITALE offered the Plaintiff $20,000
to drop his workers’ compensation case.” (Complaint ¶ 78.)
An “act in
furtherance of a person’s right of petition or free speech under the United
States or California Constitution in connection with a public issue includes:
(1) any written or oral statement or writing made before a
legislative, executive, or judicial proceeding, or any other official
proceeding authorized by law, (2) any written or oral statement
or writing made in connection with an issue under consideration or
review by a legislative, executive, or judicial body, or any other
official proceeding authorized by law…”¿ (CCP § 425.16(e).)
 “The anti-SLAPP's statute’s definitional
focuses is not the form of the plaintiff’s cause of action but, rather, the
defendant’s activity that gives rise to his or her asserted liability --
and whether that activity constitutes protected speech or petitioning.” (Navellier
v. Sletten (2002) 29 Cal.4th 82, 92.)
Here,
Paragraphs 72
and 78 of the Complaint contain allegations concerning Defendants’ settlement
offers and efforts to settle Plaintiff’s worker’s compensation claim. Courts
have found that settlement negotiations are protected activity. “Settlement
negotiations while a suit is pending are likewise protected; they involve
communications in connection with a matter pending before or under
consideration by an official body, and so fall within the scope of section
425.16, subdivision (e)(2).” (Bonni v. St. Joseph Health Sys. (2021) 11
Cal. 5th 995, 1024; see also Optional Capital, Inc. v. Akin Gump Strauss,
Hauer & Feld LLP (2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 95, 111 (“because settlement
negotiations are regarded as an exercise of the right to petition,
communications during such negotiations are regarded as having been made in
connection with the underlying lawsuit for purposes of section 425.16,
subdivision (e)(2)”); Crossroads Investors, L.P. v. Federal National
Mortgage Assn., (2017) 13 Cal. App. 5th 757, 782 (“Settlement discussions
made in connection with litigation are protected activity under the anti-SLAPP
statute”); Knoell v. Petrovich (1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 164 (demand letter
is absolutely privileged).)
In
opposition, Plaintiff argues that a separate litigation in a different forum,
such as a separate worker’s compensation action, is not within the scope of
Anti-SLAPP. Plaintiff asserts that the allegations are not protected because
they do not address a settlement that was offered for the purpose of resolving
the civil matter in this case. In support, Plaintiff cites to Truestone,
Inc. v. Simi West Industrial Park (1984) 163 Cal. App. 3d 715, 725, Moving
Pictures Etc. Union v. Glasgow Theaters, Inc. (1970) 6 Cal.App.3d 395, 402,
and Covell v. Superior Court (1984) 159 Cal. App. 3d 39, 42-43. However,
these cases are inapposite. The cases cited by Plaintiff discuss certain circumstances
in which settlement negotiations could be discoverable or admissible. For
example, Truestone, Inc. discusses whether an offer to compromise could
be admitted as evidence as an admission against interest. (Truestone, supra,
163 Cal. App. 3d at 725.) However, these cases are not Anti-SLAPP cases and do
not discuss whether settlement negotiations are protected within the scope of
Anti-SLAPP. Plaintiff fails to cite to any authority in support of his
contention that settlement negotiations made in a different forum would not be
protected in the context of Anti-SLAPP. Here, Defendants’ offer to change
Plaintiff’s work schedule or offer of money in exchange for Plaintiff to drop
his pending worker’s compensation claim constitutes settlement negotiations. Therefore,
the alleged conduct is an act in furtherance of the Defendants right
of petition or free speech. (Bonni, supra, 11 Cal. 5th
at 1024.)
Accordingly, the Court finds that the Defendants have
met their burden to establish that the allegations in Paragraphs 72 and 78 of
the Complaint are protected activity. The burden shifts to Plaintiff.
 
C.      Second Prong
– Probability of Prevailing on Causes of Action
 
Once a defendant demonstrates that protected conduct is at
issue, the plaintiff must show that the complaint is both legally sufficient
and supported by a sufficient prima facie showing of facts to sustain a favorable
judgment if the evidence submitted by the plaintiff is credited.  (Navellier
v. Sletten (2002) 29 Cal.4th 82, 88-89.) “The court
does not weigh evidence or resolve conflicting factual claims. Its inquiry is
limited to whether the plaintiff has stated a legally sufficient claim and made
a prima facie factual showing sufficient to sustain a favorable judgment.” (Baral v. Schnitt (2016) 1 Cal.5th 376, 384.)
Accordingly, as explained in Baral, the second step of the analysis
under section 425.16 requires a
plaintiff to separately establish a probability of prevailing on each distinct
claim for relief: “[T]he plaintiff must make the requisite showing as to each
challenged claim that is based on allegations of protected activity.” (Id.
at p. 392.)
 
a.      Litigation
Privilege
 
Defendants contend that Plaintiff cannot
demonstrate a probability of prevailing because Defendants’ alleged conduct is
barred by the litigation privilege. The Court agrees. 
 
Civil Code section 47(b) provides an absolute privilege for
communications made in any legislative proceeding, in any judicial proceeding,
in any other official proceeding authorized by law, or in the initiation or
course of any other proceeding authorized by law. (See Civ. Code, § 47(b); Hagberg
v. California Federal Bank FSB (2004) 32 Cal.4th 350, 360.) “‘The usual
formulation is that the privilege applies to any communication (1) made in
judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings; (2) by litigants or other participants
authorized by law; (3) to achieve the objects of the litigation; and (4) that
[has] some connection or logical relation to the action.’” (Kenne v. Stennis
(2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 953, 964 (quoting Silberg v. Anderson (1990) 50
Cal.3d 205, 212).) The privilege “protects any statements or writings that have
‘some relation’ to a lawsuit,” meaning that “communications made both during
and in anticipation of litigation are covered by the statute.” (Id. at
965 (quoting Rubin v. Green (1993) 4 Cal.4th 1187, 1193-94).) “‘The
privilege is broadly applied to protect most publications within lawsuits
provided there is some connection between the lawsuit and the publication.’” (Obos
v. Scripps Psychological Associates, Inc. (1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 103, 108
(quoting Adams v. Superior Court (1992) 2 Cal.App.4th 521, 529).) “‘Any
doubt as to whether the privilege applies is resolved in favor of applying it.’”
(Id. (emphasis in original).) Section 47(b) bars all tort causes of
action except malicious prosecution. (See Hagberg, supra, 32 Cal.4th at
360.)
 
Paragraphs 72 and 78 of the Complaint contain allegations of
Defendants’ settlement communications. Specifically, Plaintiff alleges that
Defendants offered to change Plaintiff’s work schedule or offered Plaintiff
money in exchange for Plaintiff to drop his pending worker’s compensation
claim. Therefore, Defendants communicative conduct is related to a judicial
proceeding, the worker’s compensation claim, and is therefore privileged under
the litigation privilege. As Defendants assert, the litigation privilege
extends to settlement communications. (GeneThera, Inc. v. Troy & Gould
Professional Corp. (2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 901.) Plaintiff does not address
this argument in his opposition. Therefore, the Court finds the alleged conduct
is barred by the litigation privilege.
 
Accordingly,
Plaintiff cannot show a
likelihood of prevailing on his claims because the allegations in Paragraphs 72 and 78 of the Complaint are shielded
by the litigation privilege. Thus, Defendants’ special
motion to strike is GRANTED and Paragraphs
72 and 78 of the Plaintiff’s Complaint are stricken.
 
III. DISPOSITION
 

Defendants’ special motion to strike is GRANTED. Paragraphs 72 and 78 of the
Plaintiff’s Complaint are stricken.
