DEMURRER
1
RELIEF REQUESTED
“Defendants, HHKC Development, Inc.; Kit Chan;
and William Chan demur to Plaintiffs’ FAC on the following grounds:
Defendants individually and collectively demur
to the entire First Amended Complaint the ground that it fails to state facts
sufficient to constitute a cause of action against the Demurring Defendants
named therein, and as to each of them, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 430.10(e).
Defendants individually and collectively demur
to the Third Cause of Action for Implied Warranty on the ground that this cause
of action fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action
against the Demurring Defendants named therein, and as to each of them,
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10(e).
Defendants individually and collectively demur
to the Fifth Cause of Action for Negligence on the ground that this cause of
action fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against
the Demurring Defendants named therein, and as to each of them, pursuant to
Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10(e).
Defendants individually and collectively demur
to the Eighth Cause of Action for Disgorgement Under Business and Professions
Code section 7031(b) on the ground that this cause of action fails to state
facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against Demurring Defendants
named therein, and as to each of them, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 430.10(e).
This Demurrer is based on this Notice and
Demurrer, Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10, the attached Memorandum of
Points and Authorities and Declaration of Joseph M. Rossini, the pleadings on
file with this Court, and any other matters properly before the Court at the
time of the hearing on the Demurrer.”

However, Plaintiffs opposed this demurrer, so it appears that Plaintiffs

Meet and Confer
A party filing a demurrer “shall meet and confer
in person or by telephone with the party who filed the pleading that is subject
to demurrer for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached
that would resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer.”  (Code Civ. Proc. § 430.41, subd. (a).)  “The parties shall meet and confer at least
five days before the date the responsive pleading is due. If the parties are
not able to meet and confer at least five days prior to the date the responsive
pleading is due, the demurring party shall be granted an automatic 30-day
extension of time within which to file a responsive pleading, by filing and
serving, on or before the date on which a demurrer would be due, a declaration
stating under penalty of perjury that a good faith attempt to meet and confer
was made and explaining the reasons why the parties could not meet and
confer.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §430.41,
subd. (a)(2).) 
Failure to sufficiently meet and confer is not
grounds to overrule or sustain a demurrer. (Code Civ. Proc. § 430.41(a)(4).)
Defendants’ counsel alleged that a meet and
confer occurred but an agreement was unable to be reached. (Decl. Rossini ¶¶4-6.)

LEGAL STANDARDS FOR DEMURRERS
Demurrer – Sufficiency
A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the
complaint states a cause of action.  (Hahn
v. Mirda, (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) 
When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in
context.  (Taylor v. City of Los
Angeles Dept. of Water and Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228.)  The court “treat[s] the demurrer as admitting
all material facts properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or
conclusions of fact or law ….”  (Berkley
v. Dowds (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 518, 525.) 
In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of
the pleading or via proper judicial notice. 
(Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968,
994.)  A demurrer tests the pleadings
alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters; therefore, it lies only
where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 430.30, 430.70.)  The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing
is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters,
states a cause of action. (Hahn, supra, 147 Cal.App.4th at
747.)  
The general rule is that the plaintiff need only
allege ultimate facts, not evidentiary facts. 
(Doe v. City of Los Angeles (2007) 42 Cal.4th 531, 550.)  “All that is required of a plaintiff, as a
matter of pleading … is that his complaint set forth the essential facts of the
case with reasonable precision and with sufficient particularity to acquaint
the defendant with the nature, source and extent of his cause of action.”  (Rannard v. Lockheed Aircraft Corp.
(1945) 26 Cal.2d 149, 156-157.)  
On demurrer, a trial court has an independent
duty to “determine whether or not the … complaint alleges facts sufficient to
state a cause of action under any legal theory.”  (Das v. Bank of America, N.A. (2010)
186 Cal.App.4th 727, 734.)  Demurrers do
not lie as to only parts of causes of action, where some valid claim is alleged
but “must dispose of an entire cause of action to be sustained.”  (Poizner v. Fremont General Corp. (2007)
148 Cal.App.4th 97, 119.)  “Generally it is an abuse of discretion to sustain a
demurrer without leave to amend if there is any reasonable possibility that the
defect can be cured by amendment.”  (Goodman
v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349.)

Demurrer – Uncertainty
A special demurrer for uncertainty, CCP section 430.10(f), is disfavored
and will only be sustained where the pleading is so bad that defendant cannot
reasonably respond—i.e., cannot reasonably determine what issues must be
admitted or denied, or what counts or claims are directed against
him/her.  (Khoury v. Maly’s of Calif., Inc. (1993) 14
Cal.App.4th 612, 616.)  Moreover, even if the pleading is somewhat vague,
“ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery procedures.” (Ibid.)
TENTATIVE RULING DEMURRER 1
Issue 1
Defendants argue that
the entire FAC fails to state a cause of action against HHKC Defendants because
none of them aided or abetted unlicensed contracting.
Defendants
cite several cases to support their argument, and Defendants’ arguments are difficult
to decipher. It appears as if Defendants are attempting to establish matters
that are outside the scope of demurrer. For example, Defendants argue: 
In this matter, the foundation upon which the Plaintiffs base
their case against the HHKC Defendants is that they aided and abetted
unlicensed contracting by Dream House when HHKC obtained the permit for the
Project. However, the FAC’s allegations show the HHKC Defendants did not aid or
abet unlicensed contracting. The FAC alleges that Dream House and Plaintiffs
entered into the first contract on March 28, 2021, and it was “during this
time” that HHKC obtained the building permit. (FAC, ¶103.) However, Dream
House’s license did not expire until over 18 months later, on November 30,
2022. (FAC, 106.) These allegations demonstrate that HHKC did not aid and abet
unlicensed contracting, because at the “significant moment,” when HHKC obtained
the building permits, and when Dream House and Plaintiffs entered into the
agreement, Dream House was licensed. Therefore, in accordance with Silverberg
Plumbing and Latipac, supra, these allegations demonstrate that the FAC fails
to state a cause of action because at the “significant moment,” namely, when
Plaintiffs entered into a contract with Dream House and HHKC obtained the
building permit, Dream House was properly licensed.
Def. Dem. p. 12.)
The court
“treat[s] the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded, but
not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law ….”  (Berkley v. Dowds (2007) 152
Cal.App.4th 518, 525.)  In a demurrer
proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via
proper judicial notice.  (Donabedian
v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) A demurrer tests the
pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters; therefore, it
lies only where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are
judicially noticed. (See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 430.30, 430.70.)
Defendants’
demurrer based on their first issue that the entire FAC fails to state a cause
of action against the HHKC Defendants because none of them aided or abetted
unlicensed contracting is OVERRULED.
Issue
2
Defendants argue that
the eighth cause of action for disgorgement under Business and Professions Code
§ 7031(b) fails to state a cause of action.
Defendants
cite to Bus. & Prof. Code § 7031(b) which states, “Except as provided in
subdivision (e), a person who utilizes the services of an unlicensed contractor
may bring an action in any court of competent jurisdiction in this state to
recover all compensation paid to the unlicensed contractor for performance of
any act or contract.” (Bus. & Prof. Code § 7031(b).)
Defendants
argue that the plain language of § 7031 permits Plaintiffs to bring an action
only against the unlicensed contractor they paid – not anyone else. Defendants
argue that since Plaintiffs did not allege they paid HHKC, Plaintiffs cannot
state a cause of action.
Defendants’
argument is unavailing. 
Defendants
ignore the agency allegations in ¶¶11-14 of the FAC.
The
general rule of respondeat superior is as follows, “an employer is
vicariously liable for the torts of its employees committed within the scope of
the employment.” (Lisa M. v. Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital (1995)
12 Cal.4th 291, 298.) 
Further,
to this Court, it appears that respondeat superior is codified by
statute. Under Civil Code § 2338, “Unless required by or under the authority of
law to employ that particular agent, a principal is responsible to third
persons for the negligence of his agent in the transaction of the business of
the agency, including wrongful acts committed by such agent in and as a part of
the transaction of such business, and for his willful omission to fulfill the
obligations of the principal.” (Civil Code § 2338.) Under Civil Code § 2330,
“An agent represents his principal for all purposes within the scope of his
actual or ostensible authority, and all the rights and liabilities which would
accrue to the agent from transactions within such limit, if they had been
entered into on his own account, accrue to the principal.” (Civil Code § 2330.)
Further,
the case of Michelson v. Hamada helps explain the principal of agency:
Civil Code section 2295 states: “An agent is one who
represents another, called the principal, in dealings with third persons. Such
representation is called agency.” (3)
Any person may be authorized to act as an agent, including an adverse party to
a transaction. (See Naify v. Pacific Indemnity Co. (1938) 11
Cal.2d 5, 7 [76 P.2d 663, 115 A.L.R. 476]; Orfanos v. California
Insurance Co. (1938) 29 Cal.App.2d 75, 78-81 [84 P.2d
233]; 2 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (9th ed. 1987) Agency and Employment,
§ 33, p. 47.) “Whether a person performing work for another is an agent ...
depends primarily upon whether the one for whom the work is done has the legal
right to control the activities of the alleged agent. [Citations.]” (Malloy
v. Fong (1951) 37 Cal.2d 356, 370 [232 P.2d 241].) An
agent is a fiduciary. (Kennard v. Glick (1960) 183
Cal.App.2d 246, 250-251 [agent entrusted with duty of receiving and
disbursing moneys and keep- ing accurate records of the transactions]; Estate
of Arbuckle (1950) 98 Cal.App.2d 562, 569-570 [220 P.2d 950, 23
A.L.R.2d 372] [business manager unable to produce will entrusted to him];
2 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law, supra, Agency and Employment, §§ 41,
43 et seq., pp. 53, 55.) Agency may be implied from the circumstances and
conduct of the parties (see Bergtholdt v. Porter Bros. Co. (1896)
114 Cal. 681, 685-688 [46 P. 738]; Brand v. Mantor (1935)
6 Cal.App.2d 126, 130; Pollack v.
Lytle (1981) 120 Cal.App.3d 931, 940; Brea v. McGlashan (1934)
3 Cal.App.2d 454, 464 [39 P.2d 877].) (4) When the principal in
reliance on the agent does not have the service performed by others, the agent
is liable for failure to perform. (See Lab. Code, § 2851; Poile v.
Stockton Merchants Assn. (1959) 176 Cal.App.2d 100,
104 [collection agency liable for amount of check it failed to collect and
was under duty to inform principal of failure]; Rest.2d Agency, § 378; 2
Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law, supra, Agency and Employment, § 62, p.
68.) (5)
A contract between parties that includes the rendering of services does not
preclude recovery for breach of a confidential relationship where property is
misappropriated. (Agair Inc. v. Shaeffer (1965) 232 Cal.App.2d
513, 517 [42 Cal.Rptr. 883].)
 
(Michelson v. Hamada (1994) 29 Cal.App.4th 1556, 1579-80.)
 
As to
alleging agency at the pleading stage, “An allegation of agency is an
allegation of ultimate fact that must be accepted as true for purposes of
ruling on a demurrer.” (City of Industry v. City of Filmore (2011) 198
Cal.App.4th 191, 212-13.) “We have already noted, however, that an allegation
of agency as such is a statement of ultimate fact. Consequently further
allegations explaining how this fact of agency originated become unnecessary.”
(Skopp v. Weaver (1976) 16 Cal.3d 432, 439.)

Here, Plaintiffs alleged that each Defendant acted as an agent of the other
Defendants.
Further,
the Court is not clear what Defendants’ citation to Swickheimer v. King (1971)
22 Cal.App.3d 220 has to do with the eighth cause of action under 7031(b). Swickheimer
doesn’t mention 7031(b) in the entire case. Further, that case was not at
the pleading stage.
Defendants
also argue that HHKC Defendants did not act as a contractor as defined by the
contractor’s state license law; therefore, HHKC cannot be liable for violation
7031. Defendants again cite to a case (The Fifth Day, LLC v. Bolotin (2009)
172 Cal.App.4th 939, 948) which wasn’t at the pleading stage.
Defendants’
demurrer that the eighth cause of action for disgorgement under B&P 7031(b)
fails to state a cause of action is OVERRULED.
Third
Cause of Action  - Breach of Implied
Warranty
Defendants cite case law
that support the argument that an implied warranty in a contract generally
cannot arise without a contract between the plaintiff and the defendant. Defendants
argue how Plaintiffs don’t allege that the HHKC Defendants were parties to the
alleged agreements; thus, Defendants argue that lack of privity is shown on the
face of the FAC.
While
Defendants are correct to argue that the FAC does not allege a breach of
contract cause of action against Defendants, the Defendants fail to consider
the agency allegations the Court previously mentioned. 
“An agent
represents his principal for all purposes within the scope of his actual or
ostensible authority, and all the rights and liabilities which would accrue to
the agent from transactions within such limit, if they had been entered into on
his own account, accrue to the principal.” (Civil Code §2330.)
As to
alleging agency at the pleading stage, “An allegation of agency is an
allegation of ultimate fact that must be accepted as true for purposes of
ruling on a demurrer.” (City of Industry v. City of Filmore (2011) 198
Cal.App.4th 191, 212-13.) “We have already noted, however, that an allegation
of agency as such is a statement of ultimate fact. Consequently further
allegations explaining how this fact of agency originated become unnecessary.”
(Skopp v. Weaver (1976) 16 Cal.3d 432, 439.)
Defendants’
demurrer to the third cause of action is OVERRULED.
Fifth
Cause of Action – Negligence
Defendants cite to Aas
v. Superior Court (2000) 24 Cal.4th 627. They argue that in
California, the only kinds of damages caused by negligence which may be
recovered from are from property damage or personal injury. Defendants refer to
this as the economic loss rule. Defendants then argue that Plaintiffs do not
allege any form or personal injury or property damage and thus the demurrer as
to the negligence action should be sustained.
Defendants
then argue that Plaintiffs make no allegations from which one could conclude
that Plaintiffs were in contractual privity with the HHKC defendants or that
Plaintiffs sustained injuries from property damage or personal injuries.
In
Opposition, Plaintiffs argue that Defendants overlook that Plaintiffs alleged
privity based on alter ego allegations.
The Court
will hear argument, as it has issues with both sides as to this cause of
action.
As a
preliminary matter, the Court is unclear why contractual privity is relevant. Defendants
argue that Plaintiffs do not allege contractual privity. If Defendants are
arguing that contractual privity needs to be alleged, the Court previously
addressed how a breach of contract was alleged against some of the non-moving
Defendants and that the FAC alleges agency as to all Defendants. Therefore, to
the extent privity is applicable, privity has been alleged. Defendants briefly
discuss the Economic Loss Rule, but it isn’t quite clear if Defendants
accurately state it. Further, the Opposition is of no help, because the
Opposition does not address any of the law that the Defendants’ moving papers
address.
At the
hearing both parties should be prepared to discuss McMillin Albany LLC v.
Superior Court (2018) 4 Cal.5th 241, because under the Court’s reading of McMillin,
it appears that Plaintiffs’ negligence claim may be supplanted by the Right To
Repair Act. Confusingly, Defendants argue that the Right To Repair Act applies only
to newly constructed housing that was originally sold on or after January 1,
2003. Therefore, overall, parties should be prepared to discuss all aspects of McMillin,
including if Plaintiffs’ claim cannot be brought under a negligence theory
since Plaintiffs don’t appear to allege personal injury or property damage, and
if Plaintiffs appear to only be alleging economic loss. They should also be
prepared to address the Right To Repair Act, and if it only applies to newly
constructed housing that were originally sold on or after January 1, 2003.
Tan
and Chan
Defendants argue that
all cause of action fail against Defendants Tan and Chan. Defendants successfully
argue that alter ego allegations are not sufficiently alleged.
 
Alter
Ego Doctrine
The case of
Sonora Diamond Corp. v. Superior Court helps explain the alter ego
doctrine:
 
Ordinarily, a corporation is
regarded as a legal entity, separate and distinct from its stockholders,
officers and directors, with separate and distinct liabilities and
obligations. (Wenban Estate, Inc. v. Hewlett (1924) 193
Cal. 675, 696, 227 P. 723; Communist Party v. 522 Valencia, Inc. (1995)
35 Cal.App.4th 980, 993, 41 Cal.Rptr.2d 618; Robbins v.
Blecher (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 886, 892, 60 Cal.Rptr.2d
815.) A corporate identity may be disregarded—the “corporate veil”
pierced—where an abuse of the corporate privilege justifies holding the
equitable ownership of a corporation liable for the actions of the
corporation. (Roman Catholic
Archbishop v. Superior Court (1971) 15 Cal.App.3d
405, 411, 93 Cal.Rptr. 338.) Under the alter ego doctrine, then, when the
corporate form is used to perpetrate a fraud, circumvent a statute, or
accomplish some other wrongful or inequitable purpose, the courts will ignore
the corporate entity and deem the corporation's acts to be those of the persons
or organizations actually controlling the corporation, in most instances the
equitable owners. (Robbins v. Blecher, supra, 52 Cal.App.4th
at p. 892, 60 Cal.Rptr.2d 815; Communist Party v. 522 Valencia,
Inc., supra, 35 Cal.App.4th at pp. 993–994, 41 Cal.Rptr.2d
618.) The alter ego doctrine prevents individuals or other corporations
from misusing the corporate laws by the device of a sham corporate entity
formed for the purpose of committing fraud or other misdeeds. (Associated
Vendors, Inc. v. Oakland Meat Co. (1962) 210 Cal.App.2d 825,
842, 26 Cal.Rptr. 806.) In California, two conditions must be met before the
alter ego doctrine will be invoked. First, there must be such a unity of
interest and ownership between the corporation and its equitable owner that the
separate personalities of the corporation and the shareholder do not in reality
exist. Second, there must be an inequitable result if the acts in question are
treated as those of the corporation alone. (Automotriz etc. De
California v. Resnick (1957) 47 Cal.2d 792, 796.)
 
(Sonora Diamond Corp. v.
Superior Court (2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 523, 538.)
 
Further, A.J. Fistes Corp
explains the pleading standard for alleging liability under the alter ego
doctrine:
 
“To recover on an alter ego
theory, a plaintiff need not use the words ‘alter ego,’ but must allege
sufficient facts to show a unity of interest and ownership, and an unjust
result if the corporation is treated as the sole actor.” (Leek v. Cooper (2011)
194 Cal.App.4th 399, 415, 125 Cal.Rptr.3d 56 [complaint alleging
individual defendant was owner of all stock of defendant corporation and
personally made all its business decisions was not sufficient for alter ego
liability]; cf. Rutherford Holdings, LLC v. Plaza Del Rey (2014)
223 Cal.App.4th 221, 235, 166 Cal.Rptr.3d 864 [plaintiff sufficiently
alleged unity of interest by alleging corporate entity was inadequately
capitalized, failed to “abide by the formalities of corporate existence,” and
was dominated, controlled, and used by defendant as a “mere shell and
conduit”].)
 
(A.J. Fistes Corp. v. GDL
Best Contractors, Inc. (2019) 38 Cal.App.5th 677, 696.)
 
Here, Plaintiffs do not
appear to sufficiently allege alter ego liability.
 
However, Defendants fail to
recognize that Defendants successfully alleged agency as the Court previously
discussed. On demurrer, a trial court has an independent duty to “determine
whether or not the … complaint alleges facts sufficient to state a cause of
action under any legal theory.”  (Das
v. Bank of America, N.A. (2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 727, 734.) Here, Plaintiffs
successfully alleged agency.
 
Therefore, Defendants’
arguments with respect to Tan and Chan are unavailing. 
 
Leave
to Amend
As stated in Dalton
v. East Bay Mun. Utility Dist. (1993) 18 Cal.App.4th 1566, 1570-71:
If the complaint, liberally construed, can state a cause of
action, or if it is reasonably possible that the plaintiffs can cure the complaint
by amendment, the trial court should not sustain a demurrer without leave to
amend. (Heckendorn v. City of San Marino (1986) 42 Cal.3d 481,
486 [229 Cal.Rptr. 324, 723 P.2d 64].) The burden is on the
plaintiffs to establish the reasonable possibility that the defect is curable.
(Blank v. Kirwan, supra, 39 Cal.3d at p. 318.) A demurrer is
properly sustained without leave to amend if it appears that under applicable
substantive law there is no reasonable possibility that *1571 an
amendment could remedy the defects. (Heckendorn v. City of San Marino, supra,
42 Cal.3d at p. 486.)
 
 
 
DEMURRER

The Motion
to Strike is made on the grounds that the below-identified portions of the FAC
are not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of this state and/or are
irrelevant, false or improper matters and therefore should be stricken pursuant
to CCP §§ 435 and 436. The Motion is based on this Notice, and attached
Memorandum of Points and Authorities, the pleadings and papers on file in this
action, the Declaration of Joseph M. Rossini (“Rossini Decl.”), the arguments
of counsel and any such further matters that may properly come before the Court
at or prior to the hearing on the Motion. Before filing this Motion to Strike,
the parties met and conferred in compliance with CCP §§430.41 and 435.5.

Proof of Service
Timely Filed (CRC Rule 3.1300): Ok
16/21 Court Days Lapsed (CCP 1005(b)): Ok
Proper Address (CCP §1013, §1013a, §1013b): No/Yes – The email addresses
on Defendants’ POS that Defendants served Plaintiffs’ counsel at don’t match
the email address on the Court’s file for Plaintiffs’ counsel. On eCourt,
Plaintiffs’ counsel’s email address is listed as filing@lawyer4property.com.
However, Plainitffs opposed this demurrer, so it appears that Plaintiffs
received it.
Meet
and Confer
Before filing a motion to strike pursuant to
this chapter, the moving party shall meet and confer in person or by telephone
with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to the motion to strike
for the purpose of determining if an agreement can be reached that resolves the
objections to be raised in the motion to strike. If an amended pleading is
filed, the responding party shall meet and confer again with the party who
filed the amended pleading before filing a motion to strike the amended
pleading. (CCP §435.5(a).)
Moving Defendants’ counsel
alleges that a meet and confer occurred but an agreement could not be reached.
(Decl. Rossini ¶4-6.)
Legal
Standard – Motion to Strike
Any party, within the
time allowed to respond to a pleading may serve and file a notice of motion to
strike the whole or any part thereof. (CCP § 435(b)(1); Cal. Rules of Court,
Rule 3.1322(b).) The court may, upon a motion or at any time in its discretion
and upon terms it deems proper: (1) strike out any irrelevant, false, or
improper matter inserted in any pleading; or (2) strike out all or any part of
any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of California, a
court rule, or an order of the court. (CCP §§ 436(a)-(b); Stafford v. Shultz
(1954) 42 Cal.2d 767, 782 [“Matter in a pleading which is not essential to the
claim is surplusage; probative facts are surplusage and may be stricken out or
disregarded”].)
The
grounds for moving to strike must appear on the face of the pleading or by way
of judicial notice.  (Code. Civ. Proc. § 437; Turman v. Turning
Point of Central California, Inc. (2010) 191 Cal.App.4th 53, 63 [“judges
read allegations of a pleading subject to a motion to strike as a whole, all
parts in their context, and assume their truth”].)
