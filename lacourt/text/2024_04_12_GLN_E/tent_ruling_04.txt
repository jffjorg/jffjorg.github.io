Proper Address (CCP §1013, §1013a, §1013b): Yes/No – Defendant served this
demurrer to Plaintiff at email addresses that are not listed as Plaintiff’s
email address in the Court’s file. On eCourt, Plaintiff’s email address is
listed as office@margarianlaw.com; however, that email address was not served.
However, Plaintiff filed an Opposition, so it is clear that Plaintiff received
this demurrer.
Meet
and Confer
A party filing a
demurrer “shall meet and confer in person or by telephone with the party who
filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the purpose of determining
whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the objections to be
raised in the demurrer.”  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a).)  “The
parties shall meet and confer at least five days before the date the responsive
pleading is due. If the parties are not able to meet and confer at least five
days prior to the date the responsive pleading is due, the demurring party
shall be granted an automatic 30-day extension of time within which to file a
responsive pleading, by filing and serving, on or before the date on which a
demurrer would be due, a declaration stating under penalty of perjury that a
good faith attempt to meet and confer was made and explaining the reasons why
the parties could not meet and confer.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a)(2).) 
Failure to
sufficiently meet and confer is not grounds to overrule or sustain a demurrer.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41(a)(4).)
Here,
moving party alleged it met and conferred. (Decl. Yang ¶12.)
BACKGROUND
Plaintiff filed a
Complaint on 10/06/2023. On 02/05/2024, Plaintiff filed a First Amended
Complaint (FAC). On 2/16/2024, the Court denied Defendant’s demurrer and motion
to strike to the original complaint as moot based on the filing of the FAC.
The
operative FAC alleges five causes of action for: (1) Fraud and Deceit; (2)
Breach of Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing; (3) Selling
Automobile Above Advertised Price; (4) Violation of Business & Professions
Code §17200, et seq.; (5) Violation of Business & Professions code §17500,
et seq.; and (6) Violation of California Consumer Legal Remedies Act.
The
instant action revolves around Plaintiff’s allegations that Defendant defrauded
Plaintiff by leasing a new 2022 Mercedes-Benz GLE63C4S above the advertised
price without proper disclosure nor the Plaintiff’s consent.
LEGAL
STANDARDS FOR DEMURRERS
Demurrer –
Sufficiency
A demurrer for
sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action.  (Hahn v. Mirda, (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th
740, 747.)  When considering demurrers,
courts read the allegations liberally and in context.  (Taylor v. City of Los Angeles Dept. of
Water and Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228.)  The court “treat[s]
the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded, but not
contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law ….”  (Berkley v. Dowds (2007) 152
Cal.App.4th 518, 525.)  In a demurrer
proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via
proper judicial notice.  (Donabedian
v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)  A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and
not the evidence or other extrinsic matters; therefore, it lies only where the
defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 430.30, 430.70.)  The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing
is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters,
states a cause of action. (Hahn, supra, 147 Cal.App.4th at
747.)  
The
general rule is that the plaintiff need only allege ultimate facts, not
evidentiary facts.  (Doe v. City of
Los Angeles (2007) 42 Cal.4th 531, 550.) 
“All that is required of a plaintiff, as a matter of pleading … is that
his complaint set forth the essential facts of the case with reasonable
precision and with sufficient particularity to acquaint the defendant with the
nature, source and extent of his cause of action.”  (Rannard v. Lockheed Aircraft Corp.
(1945) 26 Cal.2d 149, 156-157.)  
On
demurrer, a trial court has an independent duty to “determine whether or not
the … complaint alleges facts sufficient to state a cause of action under any
legal theory.”  (Das v. Bank of
America, N.A. (2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 727, 734.)  Demurrers do not lie as to only parts of
causes of action, where some valid claim is alleged but “must dispose of an
entire cause of action to be sustained.” 
(Poizner v. Fremont General Corp. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97,
119.)  “Generally
it is an abuse of discretion to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend if
there is any reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by
amendment.”  (Goodman v. Kennedy
(1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349.)

Demurrer – Uncertainty
A special demurrer for uncertainty, CCP § 430.10(f), is disfavored and will
only be sustained where the pleading is so bad that defendant cannot reasonably
respond—i.e., cannot reasonably determine what issues must be admitted or
denied, or what counts or claims are directed against him/her. 
(Khoury v. Maly’s of Calif., Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612,
616.)  Moreover, even if the pleading is somewhat vague, “ambiguities can
be clarified under modern discovery procedures.” (Ibid.)
TENATIVE RULING


First Cause of Action –
Fraud and Deceit
Plaintiff
alleges he leased a new 2022 Mercedes-Benz GLE63C4S from Defendant and that he
was defrauded by leasing the vehicle above the advertised price without proper
disclosure to Plaintiff nor Plaintiff’s consent.
 
The subject vehicle was
allegedly advertised on Defendant’s website for $134,335.00; however, the
subject vehicle was leased to Plaintiff for $146,435.00 as listed on the lease
agreement that Plaintiff signed. Plaintiff alleges that the price on the lease
agreement was supposed to match the advertised price.
 
Here, the Court fails to see
what the alleged fraud is. 
 
Plaintiff signed a lease
that indicated that the lease for the subject vehicle was for $146,435.00. Plaintiff
admits in the FAC that representatives at the dealership informed him that the
vehicle was not available for the advertised price, and that there was a market
adjustment of $12,100.00 in addition to the advertised price of $134,335.00.
 
Defendant explains how under
the sham pleading doctrine that when a party files an amended complaint and
seeks to avoid the defects of a prior complaint by omitting or pleading facts
inconsistent to the allegations in prior pleadings, the amended complaint
should be treated as a sham pleading.
 
Defendant states that
Plaintiff previously contended in his original Complaint that he did not know
the vehicle was being leased at an agreed upon value of $146,435.00 rather than
$134,335.00. Defendant states that in the amended pleadings, Plaintiff omitted
these allegations without making any effort to explain the inconsistency
between the Complaint and the FAC.
 
The Court is unclear what
Defendant is trying to argue about with respect to the sham pleading doctrine.

The Court’s
tentative is to SUSTAIN Defendant’s demurrer to the first cause of action for
fraud WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND.
 
Second Cause of Action – Breach of the Implied
Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing
“Every contract imposes upon each party a duty of
good faith and fair dealing in its performance and its enforcement.” (Hicks
v. E.T. Legg & Associates (2001) 89 Cal.App.4th 496, 508.) “It is
universally recognized the scope of conduct prohibited by the covenant of good
faith is circumscribed by the purposes and express terms of the contract.” (Id.
at 509.)
 
“The covenant of good faith and fair dealing,
implied by law in every contract, exists merely to prevent one contracting
party from unfairly frustrating the other party’s right to receive the benefits
of the agreement actually made.” (Guz v. Bechtel (2000) 24 Cal.4th 317,
349.)
 
Under Merced Irr. Dist. v. County of Mariposa
:
 
Under California law, to
allege a claim for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, a
plaintiff must allege the following elements: (1) the plaintiff and the
defendant entered into a contract; (2) the plaintiff did all or substantively
all of the things that the contract required him to do or that he was excused
from having to do so; (3) all conditions required for the defendant's
performance had occurred; (4) the defendant unfairly interfered with the
plaintiff's right to receive the benefits of the contract; and (5) the
defendant's conduct harmed the plaintiff. See Judicial Counsel
of California Civil Jury Instructions § 325 (2013); see
also Reinhardt v. Gemini Motor Transport, 879 F.Supp.2d 1138,
1145 (E.D.Cal.2012).
 
(Merced Irr. Dist. v.
County of Mariposa (E.D. Cal. 2013) 941 F.Supp.2d 1237, 1280, discussing
California law.)
 
“‘[T]he implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing is
limited to assuring compliance with the express terms of the contract,
and cannot be extended to create obligations not contemplated by the
contract.’” (Ragland v. U.S. Bank Nat. Assn. (2012) 209 Cal.App.4th 182,
206 (quoting Pasadena Live v. City of Pasadena (2004) 114 Cal.App.4th
1089, 1094).) 
A breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing
involves something beyond breach of the contractual duty itself and it has been
held that bad faith implies unfair dealing rather than mistaken judgment. (Careau
& Co. v. Security Pacific Business Credit, Inc. (1990) 222 Cal.App.3d
1371, 1394.)
Here, as a preliminary matter, Plaintiff’s FAC does not indicate
that Plaintiff is bringing an individual cause of action for breach of
contract. Instead, in ¶87(1), Plaintiff alleges that “Plaintiff and Defendant entered
into a contract when Plaintiff accepted the offer to lease the Subject Vehicle
at the advertised price. Donovan v. RRL Corp., 26 Cal.4th 261, 262 (Cal. 2001)
[According to the California Vehicle Code, an advertisement by a licensed
automobile dealer that specifies a particular vehicle at a certain price is
considered an offer. Therefore, it is illegal for the dealer to refuse to sell
the vehicle at the advertised price to any potential buyer as long as the
vehicle remains unsold.]” (FAC ¶87(1).)
To state a cause of action for breach of contract,
Plaintiff must allege “(1) the existence of the contract, (2) plaintiff’s
performance or excuse for nonperformance, (3) defendant’s breach, and (4)
resulting damages to the plaintiff.”  (Oasis
West Realty, LLC v. Goldman (2011) 51 Cal.4th 811, 821.)  
 
A cause of action for breach of contract is subject
to demurrer if “it cannot be ascertained from the pleading whether the contract
is written, is oral, or is implied by conduct.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., §430.10(g).) 
 
A written contract must be pled verbatim in the body
of the complaint, be attached to the complaint and incorporated by reference,
or be pled according to its legal effect. 
(Bowden v. Robinson (1977) 67 Cal.App.3d 705, 718.)  
 
An allegation of an oral agreement must “set[] forth
the substance of its relative terms.”  (Gautier
v. General Tel. Co. (1965) 234 Cal.App.2d 302, 305.)
 
Here, it cannot be ascertained from the pleadings if
the contract entered into that Plaintiff forms the basis of for its second
cause of action is written, oral, or implied by conduct. 
 
Further, the Opposition states, “Nevertheless, in
order to facilitate the litigation, Plaintiff is agreeable to withdraw the
second cause of action from the FAC.” (Oppo. p. 12.)
 
Defendant’s demurrer to the second cause of action
is SUSTAINED WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND.
 
Third Cause of Action – Selling Automobile Above
Advertised Price
As
to the basis for the third cause of action, Plaintiff cites in his FAC: Cal.
Code Regs. Tit. 13, 260.04(b), Cal. Veh. Code §11713.1(b)(e), and 16 C.F.R.
§§238.0-238.4.
Defendant points out how each of these concerns the sale of a
product, whereas here, Plaintiff leased the vehicle.
In Opposition, Defendant argues that Cal Civil Code §2981
(Automobile Sales Finance Act) provides that Plaintiff is a purchaser under 2981.
The Court will hear argument. As a preliminary matter, neither party
cites any case law to support their arguments. Both parties seem to rely on the
plain language of statutes. 
The Court is inclined to sustain the demurrer without leave to
amend. Defendant points out how the codes/regulations cited by Plaintiff
pertain to the sale of vehicles, not for the lease of vehicles. In Opposition,
Plaintiff simply cited a statute (Civil Code § 2981) that it is entirely
unclear why Plaintiff believes it is applicable to the code sections that
Plaintiff cited in its FAC.
Fourth – Sixth Causes of Action
As
a preliminary matter, even though Defendant demurs to these causes of action on
the grounds of failure to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of
action, Defendant cites no case law as to what must be alleged to sufficiently
state a cause of action. Defendant seems to interpret the allegations in the
FAC as it sees fit, while ignoring other allegations in the FAC. Defendant
cites to B&P Code § 17204, but it is unclear how this is applicable, as it pertains
to “Actions for Injunctions by Attorney General, District Attorney, County
Counsel, and City Attorneys.” Overall, Defendant’s arguments appear to be
conclusory without providing legal support.
Defendant’s demurrer to the fourth, fifth, and sixth causes of
action are OVERRULED.
 
Leave
to Amend
As stated
in Dalton v. East Bay Mun. Utility Dist. (1993) 18 Cal.App.4th 1566,
1570-71:
If the complaint, liberally construed, can state a cause of
action, or if it is reasonably possible that the plaintiffs can cure the
complaint by amendment, the trial court should not sustain a demurrer without
leave to amend. (Heckendorn v. City of San Marino (1986) 42 Cal.3d
481, 486 [229 Cal.Rptr. 324, 723 P.2d 64].) The burden is on the
plaintiffs to establish the reasonable possibility that the defect is curable.
(Blank v. Kirwan, supra, 39 Cal.3d at p. 318.) A demurrer is
properly sustained without leave to amend if it appears that under applicable
substantive law there is no reasonable possibility that *1571 an
amendment could remedy the defects. (Heckendorn v. City of San Marino, supra,
42 Cal.3d at p. 486.)
 
(Dalton v. East Bay Mun. Utility Dist. (1993) 18
Cal.App.4th 1566, 1570-71.)
 
The Court will hear argument as to leave to amend.
