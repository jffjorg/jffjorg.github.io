And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge does not have a tentative ruling at this time. The judge will hear argument on the motion to set aside/vacate summary judgment and consider the issue of sanctions. The judge will also hear argument on the credibility of the parties' claims and assess whether the attorney's mistake was excusable. The judge will consider whether the motion was made within a reasonable time and whether the plaintiff's counsel's mistake was clerical in nature. The judge will also consider whether the plaintiff's counsel's mistake was excusable and whether the plaintiff's failure to oppose the summary judgment was due to a clerical error rather than a lack of diligence.
