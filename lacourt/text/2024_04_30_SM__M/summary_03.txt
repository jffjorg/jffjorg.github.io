And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Smith v. Koay, in which Counsel Kourosh Pishnamaz of LAW & PISH has moved to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff Jayla Smith. Counsel states that an irreparable breakdown of the attorney-client relationship has occurred. However, the court finds that immediate withdrawal would be prejudicial to the client, given the upcoming and potentially dispositive hearings on May 23, 2024, and May 29-30, 2024. Therefore, the court will continue the instant hearing to May 23, 2024, at 8:30 a.m., and will rule on the motion to be relieved after the OSC hearings.
