```

And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

"In this tentative ruling, the court considers a motion for leave to amend the complaint to substitute the plaintiff's personal representative or successor in interest. The motion is taken off calendar because it was improperly filed by Alejandro Alers, Jr., who failed to provide a declaration showing the proposed amendments or any other facts required by the California Rules of Court. Additionally, the court finds that the motion substantively fails because it seeks to substitute the plaintiff on an improper basis, namely the death of a party. The proper procedure for substituting a plaintiff is found in CCP § 377.31, which requires a declaration with specific information about the decedent's name, date and place of death, and the decedent's estate. Since the declaration was not provided, the court denies the motion for leave to amend."
