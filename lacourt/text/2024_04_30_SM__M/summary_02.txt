And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the demurrer and motions to strike filed by the defendants, Sotheby's International Realty and Joshua Spiegal. The judge has determined that the complaint fails to state a cause of action under Civil Code section 2079, which requires real estate brokers to conduct a reasonably competent and diligent visual inspection of the property and disclose all material facts to the buyer. The judge has sustained the demurrer to the third cause of action without leave to amend.

The judge has also determined that the complaint fails to plead fraud with specificity, particularly with regard to the real estate agents' representations about the property's environmental sensitivity habitat area (ESHA) protections. The judge has sustained the demurrer to the fifth through tenth causes of action with leave to amend.

The judge has granted the motion to strike the attorneys' fees request, as the defendants are not direct parties to the Real Estate Purchase Agreement and there is no statute to authorize attorneys' fees. The judge has also granted the motion to strike punitive damages, as the demurrer was sustained with leave to amend.

The judge's ruling is tentative and may be subject to change based on further briefing and argument.
