MOTION:                  Motion
for Leave to Amend
HEARING DATE:   4/30/2024
 
Legal
Standard
 
If a party
wishes to amend a pleading after an answer has been filed, or after a demurrer
has been filed and after the hearing on the demurrer, or if he or she has
already amended the pleading as a matter of course, the party must obtain permission
from the court before amendment. (CCP §§ 473(a)(1), 576.) 
 
Motions
for leave to amend the pleadings are directed to the sound discretion of the
court. “The court may, in furtherance of justice, and on any terms as may be
proper, allow a party to amend any pleading . . ..” (CCP § 473(a)(1); see CCP §
576.) Policy favors liberally granting leave to amend so that all disputed
matters between the parties may be resolved. (See Howard v. County of San Diego (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 1422,
1428.) Absent prejudice to the adverse party, the court may permit amendments
to the complaint “at any stage of the proceedings, up to and including trial.”
(Atkinson v. Elk Corp.
(2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 739, 761 [internal quotes omitted].) Where leave is
sought to add entirely new claims, the court may grant leave to amend if the
new claims are based on the same general set of facts, and the amendment will
not prejudice the opposing party. (Austin
v. Massachusetts Bonding & Ins. Co. (1961) 56 Cal.2d 596, 600-602; Glaser v. Meyers (1982) 137 Cal.App.3d 770, 777 [holding
trial court did not abuse its discretion in permitting amendment of complaint,
which originally alleged constructive eviction, to allege retaliatory eviction
where the new claim was based on the same general set of facts].)
 
Although
denial is rarely justified, a judge has discretion to deny leave to amend if
the party seeking the amendment has been dilatory, and the delay has prejudiced
the opposing party. (Morgan v. Superior
Court (1959) 172 Cal.App.2d 527, 530; Hirsa v. Superior Court
(1981) 118 Cal.App.3d 486, 490). An opposing party is prejudiced where the
amendment would necessitate a trial delay along with a loss of critical
evidence, added preparation expense, increased burden of discovery, etc. (Magpali
v. Farmers Group, Inc. (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 471, 486-488 [leave properly
denied where plaintiff sought leave on the eve of trial, nearly two years after
the complaint was originally filed and gave no explanation for the delay which
prejudiced defendant who did not discover or depose many of the witnesses who
would support the new allegations and had not marshaled evidence in opposition
of the new allegations].)
 
Procedurally,
a motion for leave to amend must state with particularity what allegations are
to be amended. Namely, it must state what allegations in the previous pleading
are proposed to be deleted and/or added, if any, and where, by page, paragraph,
and line number. (CRC, Rule 3.1324(a)(2)-(3).) The motion must be accompanied
by a declaration specifying: (1) the effect of the amendment; (2) why the
amendment is necessary and proper; (3) when the facts giving rise to the
amended allegations were discovered; and (4) the reasons why the request for
amendment was not made earlier. (CRC, Rule 3.1324(b).) The motion must also be
accompanied by the proposed amended pleading, numbered to differentiate it from
the prior pleadings or amendments. (CRC, Rule 3.1324(a)(1).) It is within the
court’s discretion to require compliance with Rule 3.1324 before granting leave
to amend. (Hataishi v. First American Home Buyers Protection Corp. (2014)
223 Cal.App.4th 1454, 1469.)
 
Analysis
 
Third-party Alejandro Alers, Jr.,
moves for leave to amend the stricken first amended complaint (FAC) and file a
proposed Second Amended Complaint (SAC). (CCP § 473(a).) Mr. Alers states that
his mother, Plaintiff Hazel Alers, died January 18, 2024. In effect, he seeks
to substitute himself as Plaintiff for the wrongful death of his mother. 
 
The motion is taken off calendar,
as it was improperly filed by Mr. Alers. Moreover, Alers did not provide a
declaration showing the proposed amendments or any other facts required by the California
Rules of Court. (Cal. R. Ct., rule. 31324.) The motion also substantively fails
because it seeks leave to amend the complaint on an improper basis, the death
of a party. 
 
The proper procedure for such a
substitution is found at Code of Civil Procedure § 377.31. If a plaintiff dies
after he or she has commenced an action or proceeding, the court, on motion,
must allow the pending action or proceeding to be continued by the decedent's
personal representative or successor in interest. (CCP, § 377.31.) On such a motion, the
substituting person shall execute and file an affidavit or a declaration under
penalty of perjury stating:
        (1)
The decedent's name.
       (2) The date and place of the decedent's
death.
       (3) “No proceeding is now pending in
California for administration of the decedent's estate.”
        (4)
If the decedent's estate was administered, a copy of the final order showing
the distribution of the decedent's cause of action to the successor in
interest.
       (5) Either of the following, as
appropriate, with facts in support thereof:
            (A) “The affiant or declarant is the
decedent's successor in interest (as defined in Section 377.11 of the
California Code of Civil Procedure) and succeeds to the decedent's interest in
the action or proceeding.”
            (B) “The affiant or declarant is
authorized to act on behalf of the decedent's successor in interest (as defined
in Section 377.11 of the California Code of Civil Procedure) with respect to
the decedent's interest in the action or proceeding.”
        (6)
“No other person has a superior right to commence the action or proceeding or
to be substituted for the decedent in the pending action or proceeding.”
       (7) “The affiant or declarant affirms or
declares under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of California
that the foregoing is true and correct.”
 
(CCP
§ 377.32(a).) A certified copy of the decedent's death certificate shall be
attached to the affidavit or declaration. (CCP § 377.32(c).)
 
Mr. Alers failed to provide such a
declaration. Thus, he has not shown that he is Plaintiff’s personal
representative or successor in interest.
