And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiff, Rosa Hernandez, has filed motions to compel further responses from the defendants, Henry Shahery, Niloufar Shahery, Shason Inc., and HSH Management Group, Inc., to special interrogatories. The defendants have opposed these motions. The court has reviewed the record and finds that the plaintiff has not satisfied the requirement under Civil Code section 3295, subdivision (c) that there is a substantial probability that the plaintiff will prevail on her punitive damages claim. Therefore, the plaintiff's request for pretrial discovery compelling the defendants to further respond to the subject special interrogatories is denied. The court also declines to impose sanctions because such an award would be unjust.
