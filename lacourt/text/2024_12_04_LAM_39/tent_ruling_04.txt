MOTION
              Defendant
PNPLXPRESS, Inc. (“Defendant”) moves to compel arbitration of the claims
Plaintiffs Anna Vocino and Alfred Loren Tarquino (“Plaintiffs”) assert against
Defendant.  
  Defendant’s notice of motion indicates Defendant
filed a memorandum of points and authorities and submitted declarations from
Jaime Ortega and Mainak D’Attaray in support of its motion.  However, Defendant did not file these
documents with the Court.  The Court
cannot grant a motion without a memorandum of points and authorities, as such a
motion is incomplete.  (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1112, subd. (a), (b).)  In
its September 30, 2024 order, the Court continued the motion to this date for
Defendant to file its memorandum of points and authorities and to submit the declarations
of Jaime Ortega and Mainak D’Attaray.  Defendant
did not do so.  
Further, Defendant is a suspended
corporation.  “The suspension of the
corporate powers, rights, and privileges means a suspended corporation cannot
sue or defend a lawsuit while its taxes remain unpaid.”  (Kaufman &
Broad Communities, Inc. v. Performance Plastering, Inc. (2006) 136
Cal.App.4th 212, 217–218.)  Accordingly,
the Court strikes Defendant’s motion to compel arbitration.  The Court sets an order to show cause
regarding the default of Defendant for January 9, 2025.
Plaintiffs are ordered to provide notice of
this order and to file proof of service of same, (b).
