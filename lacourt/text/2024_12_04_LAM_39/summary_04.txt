And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the motion to compel arbitration filed by PNPLXPRESS, Inc. (Defendant) and has determined that the motion is incomplete. The court ordered Defendant to file a memorandum of points and authorities and submit declarations in support of its motion, but Defendant failed to do so. Furthermore, the court has learned that Defendant is a suspended corporation and therefore lacks the authority to sue or defend a lawsuit while its taxes remain unpaid. As a result, the court strikes Defendant's motion to compel arbitration and sets an order to show cause regarding Defendant's default for January 9, 2025. The court also orders Plaintiffs to provide notice of this order and to file proof of service of same.
