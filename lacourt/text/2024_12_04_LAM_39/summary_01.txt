As for the summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the special motion to strike filed by the defendants. The plaintiff, Daniel A. Burgoyne, sued the defendants for terminating his employment as pastor at Rolling Hills Covenant Church. The defendants argue that the plaintiff's claims are barred by the anti-SLAPP statute, which allows for the dismissal of lawsuits that are based on statements made in connection with a public issue. However, the judge finds that the defendants have failed to show that their online statements were in connection with a public issue. The judge also notes that the plaintiff's termination was not a matter of public concern, and that the defendant's argument that the First Amendment bars the plaintiff's claims is not supported by the evidence. As a result, the special motion to strike is denied.
