 Case Number:  23SMCV04945    Hearing Date:   December 19, 2024    Dept:  I The unopposed motion to consolidate is GRANTED.  The court will discuss with the parties
whether this ought to apply to the trial as well as pretrial purposes; the
court’s indication is that it should.  It
is better to decide this sooner rather than later so that trial strategies and
dates can be more intelligently decided. 
If the parties are ready, the court can advance the CMC to today and
hold it so that the parties do not have to return.
