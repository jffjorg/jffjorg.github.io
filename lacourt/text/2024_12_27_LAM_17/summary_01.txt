And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendants' motion to quash the plaintiff's complaint. The plaintiff, Legacy Enterprises Construction LLC, has filed a suit against the defendants, Nicole Reyes and De Shaun Myers, alleging unlawful detainer. The defendants argue that the plaintiff lacks standing to bring the action because it was not the legal owner of the property during the relevant time period. However, the judge finds that the plaintiff has set forth sufficient facts to allege standing and that the defendants have waived any challenge to jurisdiction by making a general appearance in the action. The judge denies the defendants' motion to quash and orders that the case proceed.
