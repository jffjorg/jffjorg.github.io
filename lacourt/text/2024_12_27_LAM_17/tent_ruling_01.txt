 Hearing
  Date:  December 27, 2024



 
 
Defendants’
motion to quash is DENIED.
 
            On
7/9/2024, Plaintiff Legacy Enterprises Construction LLC (Plaintiff) filed suit
against Nicole Reyes and De Shaun Myers (collectively, Defendants), alleging
unlawful detainer. 
 
            On
12/23/2024, Defendants moved to quash the Complaint.
 
Discussion  
 
            Defendants argue that the Complaint
should be quashed on the grounds that the Plaintiff lacks standing to bring
this action, as Plaintiff was not the legal owner of the property at issue
during the relevant time period of the lease agreements referenced in the
Complaint.
 
            In opposition, Plaintiff notes that
Defendants have made a general appearance in this action by filing answers, and
thus have effectively waived any challenge to jurisdiction. (See Roy v. Superior Court (2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 337, 341, noting
“[i]t has long been the rule in California
that “a party waives any objection to the court's exercise of personal
jurisdiction when the party makes a general appearance in the action.”)
 
            However,
setting this aside, the Court finds that Plaintiff has set forth sufficient
facts to allege standing. Plaintiff alleges that it is the “Landlord-Owner.”
Whether or not Plaintiff is, in fact, the Landlord-Owner is a factual
determination not properly determined via this motion. (See Delta Imports,
Inc. v. Mun. Ct. (1983) 146 Cal.App.3d 1033, 1036, holding that a motion to
quash is, in effect, virtually identical to general demurrer, i.e., the only
issue is whether, on the face of the pleading, the 5-day summons is supported
by the allegation of cause of action for unlawful detainer.) 
 
            Based
on the foregoing, Defendants’ motion to quash is denied. 
 
 
It is so ordered.
