And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion for attorney's fees in the amount of $336,748.60. The defendant, Hugo Sanchez, claimed that the plaintiff, TruConnect Communications, Inc., brought and maintained the action in bad faith. The defendant alleged that the plaintiff continually obstructed discovery, refused to provide an accurate trade secret disclosure, and dismissed the action shortly before trial to avoid the work of trial. The plaintiff, however, claimed that it brought and maintained the action on the good faith belief that the defendant breached their confidentiality agreement and provided the defendant's new employer with the plaintiff's trade secret. The court found that the plaintiff's action was not brought or maintained in bad faith and was not "objectively specious" or brought for an improper purpose.
