      This
action arises from Defendants’ alleged failure to pay Plaintiff for services
rendered pursuant to a written contract. Plaintiff served written discovery on
each Defendant on January 19, 2024. Each Defendant failed to respond.
      Plaintiff
served the motions on each Defendant by electronic mail to Defendants’ counsel.
The proofs of service for each motion do not identify the electronic service
address of the person making the electronic service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1013b, subd.,(b)(1).)
      Accordingly,
all six motions are TAKEN OFF CALENDAR for defective service.
