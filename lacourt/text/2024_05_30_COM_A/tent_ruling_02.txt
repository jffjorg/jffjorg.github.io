[TENTATIVE] ORDER
GRANTING DEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR AN ORDER ADMITTING CHAD J. STEPAN AS COUNSEL
PRO HAC VICE
 
      The first
amended complaint (“FAC”) alleges that Plaintiffs’ insured, Agility Fuel
Solutions, LLC, manufactured pressure relief valves for compressed natural gas
systems. Agility sold its systems to REV Group, a bus manufacturer, who in turn
sold its buses to Los Angeles Metropolitan Transportation Authority (“LA Metro”).
Defendant, Ugly Brothers, LLC (“Defendant”) while performing recall work on the
pressure relief valves installed on Metro buses, allegedly ignited a fire that
destroyed three buses. Plaintiffs were required to pay Agility’s claim for
indemnity. Plaintiffs now sue Ugly Brothers for negligence, breach of contract,
breach of warranty, and indemnity related claims.
      Defendant

Defendant. Moving parties have complied with all requirements of Cal. Rules of
