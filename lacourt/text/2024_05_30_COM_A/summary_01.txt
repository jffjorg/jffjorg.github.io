And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment, which means that the case will likely be dismissed. The plaintiff, Kimberly Hightower, attended a roller-skating event at the defendant's gymnasium and fell, sustaining an injury. The defendant, Lynwood Unified School District, has argued that the plaintiff did not identify a specific employee who allegedly caused the injury and that the plaintiff assumed the risk of injury by participating in the roller-skating event. The judge has ruled that the plaintiff has not presented sufficient evidence to establish a triable issue of fact and that the defendant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The judge has also ruled that the defendant is immune from liability for the plaintiff's injuries because the roller-skating event was a hazardous recreational activity.
