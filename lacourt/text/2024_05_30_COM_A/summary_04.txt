Here is the English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the demurrer filed by the City of Compton is overruled. The City argued that it did not own, operate, lease, or control the public property where the incident occurred, and therefore should be dismissed from the action. However, the Judge found that the complaint alleges that the location was owned, maintained, and/or controlled by the City of Compton, and therefore the City is a proper party to the action. The Judge also denied the City's request for judicial notice of the contents of the Los Angeles County Assessor's website, finding that while the website may be a public record, the truth of the matters stated in the website is not subject to judicial notice.
