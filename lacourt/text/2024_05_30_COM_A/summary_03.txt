And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

Based on the information presented, the court has taken off calendar all six motions to compel Defendant's responses to discovery due to defective service. The plaintiff, Baja Business Solutions, LLC, served written discovery on each defendant on January 19, 2024, but failed to provide proof of service that identifies the electronic service address of the person making the electronic service. As a result, the court is unable to consider the motions at this time. The parties will need to correct the defect in service before the motions can be reconsidered.
