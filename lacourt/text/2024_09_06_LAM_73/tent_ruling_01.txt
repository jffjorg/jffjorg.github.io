I. BACKGROUND
 
On
August 11, 2021, Plaintiff The Machine Group (“TMG”) filed this action against
Defendant NC Dynamics.
 
TMG’s
Complaint alleges causes of action for breach of contract and recission. 
 
On
June 3, 2024, NC Dynamics filed a Second Amended Cross Complaint (“SACC”)
against TMG and Nidec OKK USA Corporation, fka OKK USA Corporation.
 
NC
Dynamics alleges the following causes of action in its SACC: (1) breach of
contract; (2) fraud in the inducement; (3) negligence; (4) intentional
interference with contractual relations; (5) intentional interference with
prospective economic relations; (6) negligent interference with prospective
economic relations; and (7) breach of warranty of fitness for particular
purpose.
 
This
case concerns a contract dispute for the sale and underperformance of
specialized machinery.  NC Dynamics alleges the following in its SACC. NC
Dynamics, the Defendant/Cross-Complainant, is a full-service manufacturing
facility that manufactures products for aerospace companies.  According to
NC Dynamics, NC Dynamics took steps to upgrade the manufacturing process in
regard to an existing contract it had with Bombardier Aerostructures
(“Bombardier”).  As part of that process, NC Dynamics requested bids from
three companies to sell manufacturing equipment to NC Dynamics.  NC
Dynamics also requested the companies to conduct time studies to establish the
running time for the construction of specific titanium parts for the Bombardier
contract.  
 
TMG,
the Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant in this case, was one of the three companies to
submit a bid, but the only company that offered to sell an upcoming machine
from another company called OKK.  OKK conducted the time study. NC
Dynamics contend that TMG ultimately won the bid based on a guarantee made by
TMG President Richard Wackeen (“Wackeen”) that the parts would be manufactured
in ten hours with the OKK machine and also upon the misrepresentation that OKK
was aware that Wackeen was guaranteeing a ten hour running time.
 
NC
Dynamics and TMG entered into two contracts for the purchase of two OKK
machines.  The machines failed to construct the parts in the contracted
ten-hour running time, and multiple attempts were made to reduce the running
time. Because of the slow running time, NC Dynamics contend that they were
forced to purchase a third machine from TMG to meet its production needs for
the Bombardier contract.  NC Dynamics further allege that TMG continued to
guarantee that the OKK machines would achieve the ten-hour running time despite
knowing the OKK machine could do so.  NC Dynamics later learned that six
weeks before the parties entered into the third contract, a TMG manager named
Jim McCulloch (“McCulloch”) admitted in an email that the OKK machines would never
achieve a running time.  McCulloch was present to witness the final run of
the OKK machines, which at the lowest point exceeded 24 hours. As a result
of the running time, NC Dynamics contend that they lost Bombardier, and others,
as a current and future customer.   
 
In
TMG’s Complaint, TMG alleges that NC Dynamics has an unpaid balance in the
amount of $1,895,150.13 on the Second Machine and Third Machine, and has
refused to make any further payments on these machines despite TMG’s demands.
 
On May 31, 2024, NC Dynamics filed three motions to compel against TMG: 
·       NC Dynamics’
Motion to Compel TMG to respond to the Third Demand for Production of Documents
o   TMG failed to
serve responses 
·       NC Dynamics’
Motion to Compel TMG to provide further responses to the Second Set of Requests
for Admissions
o   On August 31, 2023, NC Dynamics served its Second Set of Requests for
Admissions which seek discovery that is directly relevant to this dispute.
However, on October 23, 2023, TMG provided responses that contained boilerplate
objections and evasive responses.
·       NC Dynamics’
Motion to Compel TMG to provide further responses to the Third Set of Form
Interrogatories
o   TMG’s responses to NC Dynamics’ Third Set of Form Interrogatories are
evasive and incomplete, and the stated objections are without merit.
·       NC Dynamics
requests sanctions.
 
In opposition, TMG argues that:
·       NC Dynamics’
Motion to Compel TMG to respond to the Third Demand for Production of Documents

o   The motion is
moot because TMG has since served responses
·       NC Dynamics’
Motion to Compel TMG to provide further responses to the Second Set of Requests
for Admissions
o   The requests
at issue are defective 
o   First, many of the RFAs seek admission of multiple conflicting fact
patterns. Code. Civ. Proc., 2033.060(f) (“No request for admission shall
contain subparts, or a compound, conjunctive, or disjunctive
request…”)
o   A second general category of defect in the RFAs is that many seek
admission of facts known only to other parties, often in matters where TMG
would have no knowledge at all.
o   A third, smaller category of defective RFA’s relates to intentionally
vague terms. TMG answered as best it could.
·       NC Dynamics’
Motion to Compel TMG to provide further responses to the Third Set of Form
Interrogatories
o   TMG provided further responses to interrogatory 15.1 and three other
questions in order to avoid a motion
o   The motion seeks further responses to Form Interrogatory 17.1, and TMG
challenges the propriety of further responses given the clearly defective
nature of the respective Requests for Admission
 
In reply, NC Dynamics argues that:
·      
NC Dynamics maintains that the Court
should compel TMG to provide responses/further responses 
II.
ANALYSIS
 
A.     
Meet and Confer 
 
Before bringing a motion to compel further responses
to any discovery request, the moving party is required to make efforts to meet
and confer in good faith and must submit a declaration attesting to those
efforts. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2031.310(b)(2), 2030.300(b), 2033.290(b).) “A
meet and confer declaration in support of a motion shall state facts showing a
reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal resolution of each issue
presented by the motion.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2016.040.)
 
Here, counsel for NC Dynamics submitted a declaration
attesting that the parties met and conferred. (Chow Decl. ¶¶ 9-12.) The Court finds the
moving party has satisfied the preliminary meet and confer requirement.
 
B.     
NC Dynamics’ Motion to Compel TMG to respond to the Third Demand
for Production of Documents
 
On May 31,
2024, NC Dynamics filed the instant motion to compel TMG’s responses to Requests for
Production of Documents, Set Three, and request for sanctions.
 
On
March 12, 2024, NC Dynamics served its Requests for Production of Documents, Set Three upon
TMG. (Chow Decl., ¶ 3, Ex. A.)
 
TMG’s counsel
states he was traveling at the time of service, and an administrative error led
to the discovery being incorrectly calendared. (Semos Decl., ¶ 3.) On July 3,
2024, TMG served responses without objections to the Requests for
Production of Documents, Set Three. (Semos Decl., ¶ 2, Ex. A.)
 
Since
TMG has served responses, the Court finds the instant motion to compel
responses is moot. When respondents serve untimely discovery responses after parties
have filed motions to compel initial responses, courts have broad discretion as
to the ruling and may hold that the motion is moot. (Sinaiko Healthcare
Consulting, Inc., v. Klugman (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 409.) Since
the motion is moot, the Court does not award sanctions. 
 
Thus,
the Court finds NC Dynamics’ motion to compel TMG’s responses to Requests for Production
of Documents, Set Three is MOOT. 
 
C.     
NC Dynamics’ Motion to Compel TMG to provide further responses to
the Second Set of Requests for Admissions
 
                                                              
i.     
Legal Standard
 
The notice of motion must be served within 45 days after service
of the responses in question (extended if served by mail, overnight delivery,
or fax (see Code Civ. Proc., § 1013)); otherwise, the demanding party waives
the right to compel any further response. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300(c),
2031.310(c), 2033.290(c), 2016.050; see Sperber v. Robinson (1994) 26
Cal.App.4th 736, 745.) The 45day time limit is mandatory and jurisdictional. (Sexton
v. Superior Court (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.) However, the parties
can also agree in writing on a specific later date by which to file the motion
to compel. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300(c), 2033.290(c).) 
 
A motion to compel further responses may be brought based on
responses to requests for admission (“RFA”) that: (1) provide evasive or
incomplete answers; or (2) make unmeritorious or overly-generalized
objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.290(a).)  However, a motion to
compel further responses cannot compel the admission of matters already
denied.  (Holguin v. Superior Court (1972) 22 Cal.App.3d 812,
821.) 
 
If a timely motion to compel has been filed, the¿burden is on the
responding party¿to justify any objection or failure fully to answer.¿(Coy
v. Superior Court¿(1962) 58 Cal.2d 210, 220–221 [addressing a motion to
compel further responses to interrogatories]; see also¿Fairmont Ins. Co. v.
Superior Court¿(2000) 22 Cal.4th 245, 255.) 
 
                                                            
ii.     
Discussion 
 
NC Dynamics seeks further responses to its Second Set of Requests
for Admissions, RFA Nos. 32, 34, 36, 37, 38, 40, 52, 53, 55, 56, 57, 60, 61,
62, 63 and Document Request No. 53.
 
1.      Request Nos.
32, 34, 36, 52, 53, 62
 
The Court does not find these requests are code compliant. 
 
For example, RFA No. 32 states “Admit that after the MACHINES were
sold to NC DYNAMICS, TMG and/or 5TH AXIS had exclusive responsibilities for
setting up the MACHINES to machine the BOMBARDIER PARTS.”
 
The Court agrees with TMG that Request Nos. 32, 34, 36, 52, 53 and
62 are compound and cannot be answered as phrased because it inquires about
exclusive responsibility held by two entities. Therefore, the Court DENIES the motion
to compel further responses to RFA Nos.  32,
34, 36, 52, 53 and 62.
 
2.      Request Nos.
37
 
RFA No. 37 states “Admit that prior to the commencement of this litigation,
TMG never instructed NC DYNAMICS to affix the BOMBARDIER PARTS horizontally in
the MACHINES.”
 
TMG responded “Objection: The request is vague and ambiguous as to
“instructed.” Without waiving said objection, Plaintiff responds as follows: NC
Dynamics received the time study with horizontal images attached.”
 
The Court does not find the request is vague and ambiguous as to
the term “instructed.” Thus, the Court GRANTS the motion to compel further
response to RFA No. 37.
 
3.      Request Nos.
38, 40, 55, 56, 57, 60, 61, 63
 
The Court does not find these requests are code compliant. 
 
For example, RFA No. 38 states “Admit that prior to the
commencement of this litigation, 5TH AXIS never instructed NC DYNAMICS to affix
the BOMBARDIER PARTS horizontally in the MACHINES.” Additionally, RFA No. 40
states “Admit that NC DYNAMICS never prohibited 5TH AXIS from affixing the
BOMBARDIER PARTS horizontally in the MACHINES.”
 
Here, the requests ask TMG to speculate as to facts known to other
parties. TMG responded that it lacked information sufficient to admit or deny
this request. The Court agrees with TMG that Request Nos. 38, 40, 55, 56, 57,
60, 61 and 63 were properly objected to.
 
Therefore, the Court DENIES the motion to compel further responses
to RFA Nos. 38, 40, 55, 56, 57, 60, 61 and 63.
 
4.      Document
Request No. 53
 
If NC
Dynamics wishes to compel further response to Request for Production No. 53, it
needs to file a motion for that response. CRC Rule 3.1345(a). Thus, motion to
compel response to Request for Production of Document No. 53 is DENIED.
 
In sum, the Court DENIES the motion to compel further responses to
RFA Nos. 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 52, 53, 55, 56, 57, 60, 61, 62, 63, Document
Request No. 53 and the Court GRANTS the motion to compel further responses to
RFA No. 37.
 
                                                          
iii.     
Sanctions
 
Under Code of Civil Procedure § 2031.310(h), monetary sanctions
shall be imposed where a party unsuccessfully opposes a motion to compel
further responses unless the Court finds the party acted with substantial
justification or other circumstances make the imposition of sanctions unjust.
 
NC Dynamics seeks sanctions against TMG. However, since the Court
grants and denies in part NC Dynamics’ motion, the Court does not find
sanctions are warranted. Thus, NC Dynamics’ request for sanctions is DENIED. 
 
D.    
NC Dynamics’ Motion to Compel TMG to provide further responses to
the Third Set of Form Interrogatories 
 
                                                              
i.     
Legal Standard
 
“Any
party may obtain discovery . . . by propounding to any other party to the
action written interrogatories to be answered under oath.”¿ CCP § 2030.010(a).¿
“Within 30 days after service of interrogatories, the party to whom the
interrogatories are propounded shall serve the original of the response to them
on the propounding party, unless on motion of the propounding party the court
has shortened the time for response, or unless on motion of the responding
party the court has extended the time for response.”¿ CCP § 2030.260(a).¿ 
¿ 
“The
party to whom interrogatories have been propounded shall respond in writing
under oath separately to each interrogatory by any of the following: (1) An
answer containing the information sought to be discovered. (2) An exercise of
the party's option to produce writings. (3) An objection to the particular
interrogatory.”¿ CCP § 2030.210(a).¿ “If the responding party does not have
personal knowledge sufficient to respond fully to an interrogatory, that party
shall so state, but shall make a reasonable and good faith effort to obtain the
information by inquiry to other natural persons or organizations, except where
the information is equally available to the propounding party.”¿ CCP §
2030.220(c).¿ 
¿ 
“On
receipt of a response to interrogatories, the propounding party may move for an
order compelling a further response if the propounding party deems that any of
the following apply: (1) An answer to a particular interrogatory is evasive or
incomplete. (2) An exercise of the option to produce documents under Section
2030.230 is unwarranted or the required specification of those documents is
inadequate. (3) An objection to an interrogatory is without merit or too
general.”¿ CCP § 2030.300(a).¿ “A motion under subdivision (a) [of CCP §
2030.300] shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section
2016.040.”¿ CCP § 2030.300(b).¿ In addition, a separate statement is required.¿

Discussion
 
NC Dynamics seeks further responses to its Third Set of Form
Interrogatories, Rog Nos. 12.7, 15.1, 17.1, 50.1, 50.3, 50.4, 50.5, 50.6
and Document Request No. 51.
 
1.      Interrogatory
Nos. 15.1 and 50.3
 
TMG asserts requests for further responses to interrogatory nos.
15.1 and 50.3 is moot as TMG provided further responses on August 1, 2024. NC
Dynamics does not request further responses to these two interrogatories in
their reply. Thus, the Court finds further responses to interrogatory nos. 15.1
and 50.3 are MOOT.
 
2.      Interrogatory
Nos. 12.7
 
Interrogatory 12.7 states Have YOU OR ANYONE ACTING ON YOUR BEHALF
inspected the scene of the INCIDENT? If so, for each inspection state: 
(a) the name,
ADDRESS, and telephone number of the individual making the inspection (except
for expert witnesses covered by Code of Civil Procedure sections
2034.210-2034.310); and 
(b) the date
of the inspection.
 
TMG responded “Objection: This is vague and ambiguous and the
scope is unclear. Without waiving said objection, Plaintiff responds as
follows: Since the instigation of litigation, no.”
 
The Court agrees that the term “incident” is vague and is
ambiguous as to the scope. Thus, the Court DENIES the motion to compel further
responses to interrogatory No. 12.7.
 
3.      Interrogatory
No. 17.1
 
Interrogatory 17.1 states Is your response to each request for admission served with these
interrogatories an unqualified admission? If not, for each response that is not
an unqualified admission: 
(a) state the
number of the request; 
(b) state all
facts upon which you base your response; 
(c) state the
names, ADDRESSES, and telephone numbers of all PERSONS who have knowledge of
those facts; and 
(d) identify
all DOCUMENTS and other tangible things that support your response and state
the name, ADDRESS, and telephone number of the PERSON who has each DOCUMENT or
thing.
 
TMG asserts that no response is required to this question because
the respective RFA was properly objected to. As discussed above, the Court
found that RFA Nos. 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 52, 53, 55, 56, 57, 60, 61, 62, 63 were
not code compliant. Thus, the motion to compel further responses to interrogatory
No. 17.1 is DENIED.
 
4.      Interrogatory
Nos. 50.1, 50.4-50.6
 
NC Dynamics argues that TMG’s responses contain meritless
objections, they are incomplete, and they fail to provide responses to each
sub-part of these form interrogatories. TMG should be ordered to withdraw the
meritless objections and provide and full and complete responses to all
sub-parts of each of these form interrogatories.
 
The Court agrees and GRANTS the motion to compel further responses
to interrogatory Nos. 50.1, 50.4-50.6.
 
5.      Document
Request No. 51
 
If NC
Dynamics wishes to compel further responses to Request for Production No. 51,
it needs to file a motion for that response. CRC Rule 3.1345(a). Thus, motion
to compel response to Request for Production of Document No. 51 is DENIED.
 
In sum, the Court finds further responses to interrogatory Nos.
15.1 and 50.3 are MOOT. The Court DENIES the motion to compel further responses
to Interrogatory Nos. 12.7 and 17.1, and the Court GRANTS the motion to compel
further responses to Interrogatory Nos. 50.1, 50.4-50.6.
 
                                                          
iii.     
Sanctions
 
Under Code of Civil Procedure § 2031.310(h), monetary sanctions
shall be imposed where a party unsuccessfully opposes a motion to compel
further responses unless the Court finds the party acted with substantial
justification or other circumstances make the imposition of sanctions unjust.
 
NC Dynamics seeks sanctions against TMG. However, since the Court
grants and denies in part NC Dynamics’ motion, the Court does not find
sanctions are warranted. Thus, NC Dynamics’ request for sanctions is DENIED. 
 
III. DISPOSITION
 
NC Dynamics’ Motion to Compel TMG to respond to the Third Demand
for Production of Documents and Request for Sanctions is MOOT.
 
NC Dynamics’ Motion to Compel TMG to provide further responses to
the Second Set of Requests for Admissions is GRANTED and DENIED in part. The
Court DENIES the motion to compel further responses to RFA Nos. 32, 34, 36, 38,
40, 52, 53, 55, 56, 57, 60, 61, 62, 63, Document Request No. 53 and the Court
GRANTS the motion to compel further responses to RFA No. 37. The request for
sanctions is denied.
 
NC Dynamics’ Motion to Compel TMG to provide further responses to
the Third Set of Form Interrogatories is GRANTED and DENIED in part. The Court
finds further responses to Interrogatory Nos. 15.1 and 50.3 are MOOT. The Court
DENIES the motion to compel further responses to Interrogatory Nos. 12.7 and
17.1, and the Court GRANTS the motion to compel further responses to
Interrogatory Nos. 50.1, 50.4-50.6. The request for sanctions is denied.
 
TMG shall provide code-compliant responses
within 20 days.
