And here is a brief summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Rolf Treu in the case of Fenix Entrepreneur, Inc. v. Sun Do Hong (Case No. 24STCV17180). The defendant, Sun Do Hong, has filed a demurrer to the plaintiff's complaint, arguing that the complaint fails to state a cause of action and is uncertain. The judge has ruled that the demurrer is sustained without leave to amend, meaning that the plaintiff cannot fix the defects in the complaint and must instead refile a new complaint. The judge found that the plaintiff is not a neutral party and is not the proper party to bring an interpleader claim. The case involves a dispute over a property located at 6836 Crenshaw Blvd, Los Angeles, CA, and the parties have a complex history of claims and counterclaims.
