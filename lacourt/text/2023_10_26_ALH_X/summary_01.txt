```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to compel arbitration in this case. The defendant argued that the warranty for the 2019 Acura MDX was part of the purchase agreement and therefore subject to arbitration. The judge rejected this argument, citing California law which does not treat manufacturer warranties as part of the sales contract. The judge also rejected the defendant's argument that equitable estoppel applied, finding that the warranty claims were not intimately founded in and intertwined with the sales contract. Finally, the judge rejected the defendant's argument that it was a third-party beneficiary and therefore entitled to enforce the arbitration provision.
