And here is the English text summary of the tentative ruling:

The respondent, Los Angeles County Office of Education and Los Angeles County Office of Education's Personnel Commission, has filed an unopposed demurrer to the amended verified petition for peremptory writ of mandate. The judge has granted the demurrer and sustained it. The petition is time-barred because it was filed almost three years after the deadline to file the writ petition. The judge notes that the petition does not contain a request for an administrative record, which would have extended the deadline to file the petition. The judge will hear from the petitioner on how to amend the petition to address the defect.
