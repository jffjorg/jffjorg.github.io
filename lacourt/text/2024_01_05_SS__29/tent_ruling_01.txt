Background
This arises from
a fall that allegedly occurred at the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center on April 12,
2017.  Plaintiff Samuel Aurebach
(“Plaintiff”) filed this action on April 5, 2019, asserting a cause of action
under premise liability against Defendant Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and Does
1 through 50.  Defendant Cedars-Sinai Medical
Center filed its Answer to the Complaint on May 10, 2019.
 
Plaintiff
amended his complaint on June 23, 2021, to name Defendant ABM Building
Solutions LLC as Doe 1 and Defendant ABM Global Facility Service as Doe 2.  At the request of Plaintiff, those two
entities were dismissed on April 27, 2022. 

 
Also on April
27, 2022, Plaintiff amended his complaint to name Defendant ABM Industries
Groups, LLC as Doe 3.  On June 10, 2022,
Defendant ABM Industry Groups, LLC (“ABM”) filed its Answer to the Complaint.
 
On May
12, 2023, ABM served Plaintiff with a series of discovery requests, including Requests
for Production (Set Two) and Requests for Admission (Set Two).  (Radochonski Decls., ¶ 3 & Exhs. A.)  Plaintiff did not respond to this
discovery.  (Id., ¶ 5.)
 
On
October 12, 2023, ABM filed the two discovery motions that are set for hearing
on January 5: a motion to compel Plaintiff to respond to the requests for production
and a motion to deem admitted the matters specified in the requests for
admission. ABM requests sanctions in each motion.
 
Plaintiff
has not filed any opposition to either motion.
 
The Court
is aware that additional discovery motions were on calendar in this matter for
January 4 and further additional discovery motions are on calendar for January 19,
2024.
 
Trial is
scheduled for July 23, 2024.
 
Legal Standard
A party
must respond to requests for production of documents within 30 days after
service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests
for production of documents are directed does not provide timely responses, the
requesting party may move for an order compelling response to the demand. (Id.,
§ 2031.300, subd. (b).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial
responses, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id., §
2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement
be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who fails to provide a
timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).) 
When a
party moves to compel initial responses to requests for production, “the court
shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes [the motion], unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (c).)
A party must
respond to requests for admission within 30 days after service. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.250, subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for admission are directed
does not provide a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order
that the truth of the matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted. (Id.,
§ 2033.280, subd. (b).) There is no time limit for such a motion, and no meet
and confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2033.280; Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition,
a party who fails to provide a timely response generally waives all
objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280,
subd. (a).) 
The court “shall”
make the order that the truth of the matters specified in the request be deemed
admitted unless the court “finds that the party to whom the requests for
admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a
proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial
compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (Id.,
§ 2033.280, subd. (c); see St. Mary v. Super. Ct. (2014) 223
Cal.App.4th 762, 778-780.)
“It is mandatory
that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a
timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion [to deem
admitted the matters contained in the requests for admission].”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd.
(c).)
In Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery
Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision (d), defines
“[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to respond to or to
submit to an authorized method of discovery.” 
Where a party or attorney has engaged in misuse of the discovery
process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in the amount of “the
reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result
of that conduct.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2023.020, subd. (a).)
“[P]roviding
untimely responses does not divest the trial court of its authority [to hear a
motion to compel responses].”  (Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc., supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at p. 407.)  Even if the untimely response “does not
contain objections [and] substantially resolve[s] the issues raised by a motion
to compel responses … the trial court retains the authority to hear the
motion.”  (Id. at pp. 408-409.)  This rule gives “an important
incentive for parties to respond to discovery in a timely fashion.”  (Id.
at p. 408.)  If “the propounding party [does not] take the motion off
calendar or narrow its scope to the issue of sanctions,” the trial court may
“deny the motion to compel responses as essentially unnecessary, in whole or in
part, and just impose sanctions.”  (Id. at p. 409.) “The court may
award sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion
to compel discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was filed, or
opposition to the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided
to the moving party after the motion was filed.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1348(a).)  
Discussion
On May
12, 2023, ABM served Plaintiff with Requests for Production (Set Two) and Requests
for Admission (Set Two).  (Radochonski
Decls., ¶ 3 & Exhs. A.)  Plaintiff
did not respond.  (Id., ¶ 5.)
 
ABM need
not show anything more.  
 
The
Court GRANTS ABM’s motion to compel Plaintiff to provide initial responses to
the requests for production.
 
The
Court GRANTS ABM’s motion for an order deeming admitted as true the matters
specified in the requests for admission.
 
The
Court also GRANTS in part ABM’s request for monetary sanctions.  Given the relatively straightforward nature
of a motion to compel initial responses and a motion for a deemed admitted
order, and the economies of scale associated with filing multiple discovery
motions, the Court sets sanctions on each motion in the amount of $510,
calculated based on 2 hours of attorney work, multiplied by counsel’s reasonable
billing rate of $225.00 per hour, plus the $60.00 filing fee.  (See id., ¶ 6.)
 
Conclusion
 
The Court GRANTS ABM’s motion to compel.
 
The Court ORDERS Plaintiff to provide code-compliant,
verified, written responses, without objection, to ABM’s Requests for Production
(Set Two) within 21 days of notice of this
ruling.
 
The Court GRANTS ABM’s motion for a deemed-admitted
order.
 
The Court ORDERS that all matters specified in ABM’s Requests
for Admission (Set Two) are deemed admitted as true by Plaintiff.
 
The Court GRANTS in part ABM’s request for sanctions.
 
The Court ORDERS
Plaintiff and counsel of record the Law Offices of Jacob Emrani, jointly and
severally, to pay monetary sanctions under the Civil Discovery Act to ABM in
the amount of $1,020 ($510 per motion, multiplied by two motions) within 21 days of notice of this ruling. 
The Court ORDERS
moving party to give notice.
