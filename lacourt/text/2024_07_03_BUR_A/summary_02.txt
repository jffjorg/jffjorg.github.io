```

Summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the demurrer to the first cause of action for strict liability, sustaining it without leave to amend. The demurrer to the second cause of action for negligence is sustained with 20 days' leave to amend. The demurrer to the third cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress is sustained without leave to amend. The motion to strike punitive damages is moot. The court finds that the plaintiff has pled insufficient facts as to the HOA's prior knowledge and conduct in each of the three causes of action. The court cautions that any subsequent amendment to the negligence claim would require specific allegations as to the conduct of individual HOA leaders.
