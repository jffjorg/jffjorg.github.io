And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling is on a motion to set aside default and stay writ brought by Summit Medical Supply Corp. (Defendant) in an unlawful detainer action against Borden Business Properties, LLC (Plaintiff). The motion was brought on the basis of California Code of Civil Procedure (C.C.P.) ยง 473.5, which allows a party to set aside a default judgment if they did not receive actual notice of the litigation. The Defendant, Summit Medical Supply Corp., claims it did not receive actual notice of the litigation and that the default should be set aside. The Plaintiff, Borden Business Properties, LLC, has not responded to the motion.

The Judge notes that this is the second time the Plaintiff has pursued an unlawful detainer action against the Defendant for the same property, and that the previous case was set aside by stipulation of the parties. The Judge finds that Summit's submissions are insufficient to demonstrate the lack of actual notice and that the motion to vacate default and stay writ is denied.
