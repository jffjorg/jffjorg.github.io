And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to compel further responses to discovery demands brought by the defendants. The motion seeks to compel the plaintiff to produce text message records and cell phone bills related to a motor vehicle incident on April 29, 2022.

The judge finds that the defendants have shown good cause to compel further discovery, as the information sought is relevant to the potential defense of comparative negligence and there is no viable alternative for the defendants to obtain this information outside of the phone records.

However, the judge also finds that the plaintiff has a legally protected privacy interest in his cell phone records, and that the requested discovery is a serious intrusion into his right to privacy. As such, the judge orders the plaintiff to produce text message records and cell phone bills documenting 15 minutes prior and 30 minutes after the incident.

The judge also awards sanctions against the plaintiff and his counsel in the amount of $585, finding that the plaintiff opposed the motion without substantial justification.

Finally, the judge grants the motion to compel further responses in part, ordering the plaintiff to produce the requested information within 30 days.
