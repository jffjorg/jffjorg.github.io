Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting Jivan Melikian, M.D.'s motion for summary judgment in this case. The case involves a wrongful death claim brought by the family of Joseph Shafrazian, who died after undergoing a cardiac angioplasty procedure. The Plaintiffs alleged that Melikian and other defendants were negligent in their care of Shafrazian, including failing to administer the blood thinner Plavix after the procedure.

The Judge found that Melikian had presented unrefuted evidence that his actions were within the standard of care, including his discussion with Shafrazian about the importance of taking Plavix and his ordering of subsequent doses on an inpatient basis. The Judge also found that Burbank Tower Pharmacy's placement of Plavix prescriptions on hold was not the result of Melikian's actions.

The Judge noted that the Plaintiffs and Cross-Complainants had not produced any expert testimony to contradict Melikian's declarations, and therefore, the motion for summary judgment was granted. The Judge also ruled that the survival action brought by the Plaintiffs must also fail, as they were unable to establish any triable issues of material fact regarding the breach element of the wrongful death cause of action.
