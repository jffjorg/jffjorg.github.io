And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion to strike the portions of the complaint related to punitive damages with 20 days leave to amend. The complaint alleges eight causes of action, including retaliation, wrongful termination, and unfair competition. The defendants argue that the plaintiff has failed to sufficiently allege malice, fraud, or oppression to support his request for punitive damages. The judge agrees, finding that the plaintiff's allegations are conclusory and lack specific factual assertions to support his claims. The judge orders the plaintiff to amend his complaint to sufficiently allege malice or risk having the request for punitive damages struck.
