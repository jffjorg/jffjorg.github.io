DAVID LEACHE,
  
         vs.
 
PRECISE AIR
  SYSTEMS, INC., et al. 


 Case No.: 
  24STCV14426
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  December 9, 2024



 
Defendants Precise
Air Systems, Inc.’s and Greg Khachekian’s motion to strike portions of
Plaintiff David Leache’s complaint is granted with 20 days leave to
amend. 
 
Defendants Precise Air Systems, Inc. (“PAS”) and Greg
Khachekian (“Khachekian”) (collectively, “Defendants”) move to strike portions
of Plaintiff’s Complaint pertaining to punitive damages, specifically: (1) ¶41,
Lines 20-24; (2) ¶76, Lines 11-16; and (3) Prayer ¶6, Lines 18-19.  (Notice of MTS, pgs. 1-2; C.C.P. §§425.10, 435,
436, 437.)
 
Meet and Confer
Before filing a motion to strike, the moving party must
meet and confer in person, by telephone, or by video conference with the
party who filed the pleading to attempt to reach an agreement that would
resolve the objections to the pleading and obviate the need for filing the motion.
 (C.C.P. §435.5(a).)
The moving party shall file and serve with the motion to
strike a declaration stating either of the following: (A) The means by which
the moving party met and conferred with the party who filed the pleading
subject to motion, and that the parties did not reach an agreement resolving
the objections raised in the motion to strike. (B) That the party who filed the
pleading subject to motion failed to respond to the meet and confer request of
the demurring party or otherwise failed to meet and confer in good faith.  (C.C.P. §435.41(a)(3).)
Defendants’ counsel declares that on August 6, 2024, he
attempted to meet and confer with Plaintiff’s counsel telephonically and was
unable to reach him.  (Decl. of Hagopian
¶4.)  Defendants’ counsel declares that
he attempted to reach Plaintiff’s counsel numerous times.  (See Decl. of Hagopian ¶¶5-6, 8.)  Defendants’ counsel declares that on August 7,
2024, he received an email reply from Plaintiff’s counsel, to which he
responded on August 20, 2024, laying out Defendants’ grounds for a motion to
strike and seeking a time to meet and confer telephonically, to which he did
not receive a response.  (See
Decl. of Hagopian ¶¶8-9.)  Defendants’
counsel’s declaration is sufficient under C.C.P. §435.41(a).  Therefore, the Court will consider
Defendants’ motion to strike.
 
Procedural
Background
          Plaintiff
filed his operative Complaint on June 10, 2024 against Defendants alleging
eight causes of action: (1) retaliation in violation of Labor Code §1102.5; (2)
wrongful termination in violation of public policy; (3) recovery for civil penalties
under PAGA; (4) failure to furnish wage and hour statements under Labor Code
§§226 and 226.3; (5) failure to pay wages in a timely manner in violation of
Labor Code §204; (6) waiting time penalties Labor Code §§201, 202, and 203; (7)
failure to indemnify/reimburse necessary expenditures incurred during discharge
of work duties Labor Code §2802; and (8) unfair competition.
Defendants filed the instant motion to strike on September 6,
2024.  Plaintiff filed his opposition on
November 22, 2024.  As of the date of
this hearing no reply has been filed.
 
Legal Standard
C.C.P. §436 provides that the Court may, upon a motion made
pursuant to C.C.P. §435, or at any time within its discretion and upon terms it
deems proper, “strike out any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in
any pleading” or any pleading or part thereof “not drawn or filed in conformity
with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of the court.”  (C.C.P. §436.)
 
Summary of Motion
Defendants move to strike portions of the Complaint pertaining to
recovery of punitive damages (Complaint ¶¶41,
¶76, Prayer ¶6). 
(Notice MTS, pg. 2; C.C.P. §§425.10, 435, 436, 437.)
 
Punitive Damages
Punitive damages may be
recovered upon a proper showing of malice, fraud, or oppression.  (Civ. Code §3294(a).)  “Malice” is defined as conduct intended to cause
injury to a person or despicable conduct carried on with a willful and
conscious disregard for the rights or safety of others.  (Turman v. Turning Point of Cent. Cal.,
Inc. (2010) 191 Cal.App.4th 53, 63.) 
“Oppression” means despicable conduct subjecting a person to cruel and
unjust hardship, in conscious disregard of the person’s rights.  (Id.) 
“Fraud” is an intentional misrepresentation, deceit, or concealment of a
material fact known by defendant, with intent to deprive a person of property,
rights or otherwise cause injury.  (Id.)  Conclusory allegations, devoid of any factual
assertions, are insufficient to support a conclusion that parties acted with
oppression, fraud, or malice.  (Smith
v. Superior Court (1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 1033, 1042.)
“Conduct which warrants punitive damages must be of ‘such severity
or shocking character [as] warrants the same treatment as accorded to willful
misconduct – conduct in which defendant intends to cause harm.’”  (Woolstrum v. Mailloux (1983) 141
Cal.App.3d Supp. 1, 10, quoting Nolin v. National Convenience Stores, Inc.
(1979) 95 Cal.App.3d 279, 286.)  “Despicable
Conduct” is conduct that is so vile, base, contemptible, miserable, wretched or
loathsome that it would be looked down upon and despised by ordinary decent
people.”  (Scott v. Phoenix
Schools, Inc. (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 702, 715.)
          Plaintiff fails to
sufficiently allege malice in his causes of action to support his request for
punitive damages.  Plaintiff’s cause of
action for Whistleblower Retaliation fails to allege specific facts
demonstrating an intent to cause injury to Plaintiff or despicable conduct with
the willful and conscious disregard of the rights safety of others.  (See Complaint ¶¶30-36, 60-68.)  Further, the cause of action fails to allege
any specific facts demonstrating despicable conduct that subjected Plaintiff to
cruel and unjust hardship in conscious disregard of Plaintiff’s rights.  (See Complaint ¶¶30-36, 60-68.)
Accordingly, Moving Defendants’ motion to strike Plaintiff’s
request for punitive damages from the Complaint is granted with 20 days
leave to amend.  
 
Conclusion
Defendants’ motion to strike is granted with 20 days leave
to amend.
Moving Party to give notice.
