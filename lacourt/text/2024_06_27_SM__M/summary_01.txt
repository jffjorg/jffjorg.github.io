And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendants, Wilfrid Lemann, Fullerton, Lemann, Schaefer & Dominick LLP, Gaudy Law Inc, Jason Guady, and Lobb & Plewe LLP, et al., move for a stay of proceedings pending conclusion of a separate arbitration in Robert Howard Jr. v. Joseph Duerr, et al. The defendants argue that Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.4 requires a stay of this action because both actions concern Joseph Duerr and his company, Realty Advisors & Asset Managers Inc. However, the court finds that the defendants do not meet the requirements of section 1281.4, as they are not parties to the arbitration agreement or involved with the Duerr action. Therefore, the motion is denied.
