Significant Statements:
  - The tentative ruling is subject to change after the hearing on November 15, 2023.
  - The court finds that Mt. SAC's argument confuses and muddles the two doctrines of issue preclusion and claim preclusion.
  - The court finds that claim preclusion is inapplicable in this case because Oliver's grievance was based on Oliver's primary right to be considered fairly and evaluated for tenure while Oliver's FEHA action is based on Oliver's right to be free from gender discrimination and retaliation.
  - The court finds that issue preclusion is inapplicable in this case because the prior arbitration proceeding merely established that Mt. SAC had reasonable grounds for denying Oliver tenure and these findings do not prevent Oliver from demonstrating that decision had a retaliatory or discriminatory motive.
