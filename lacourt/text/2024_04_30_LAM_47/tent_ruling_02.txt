MOTION
FOR ENTRY OF DEFAULT JUDGMENT AND PERMANENT INJUNCTION

 
MOVING PARTY:               Plaintiff Tristar Claims Management Services, Inc. 
 
RESPONDING PARTY(S): N/A
 
STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is an action for conversion that was filed on August 22, 2023.
Plaintiff alleges that Defendant’s principal misappropriated confidential and
sensitive personal information belonging to Plaintiff’s claimants. 
 
Plaintiff moves for entry of
default judgment and for a permanent injunction.
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Plaintiff’s Motion for Entry of
Default Judgment and Permanent Injunction is CONTINUED for hearing on June 3,
2024 at 9:00 a.m.  Plaintiff is directed
to submit at least five (5) court days before the hearing additional evidence
to support its request for monetary relief of $408,030.20 or, in the
alternative, to submit a proposed default judgment reflecting the monetary
relief found to be substantiated by the Court. 

 
DISCUSSION:
 
Plaintiff moves for entry of
default judgment and (1) compensatory damages; (2) treble damages under Penal
Code section 496; (3) attorney’s fees and costs; and (4) an order (a) enjoining
Defendant from using, disclosing, or disseminating Plaintiff’s confidential
claimant information or any copies of that information; (b) requiring Defendant
to return all of Plaintiff’s property in its possession; (c) requiring
Defendant to preserve all of Plaintiff’s confidential claimant information in
its possession, custody, or control pending Plaintiff’s retrieval of that
information; and (d) enjoining Defendant from doing business in California
while suspended by either the California Secretary of State or Franchise Tax
Board. 
 
Legal Standard for Default Judgment
 
            Code of
Civil Procedure section 585(b) governs default judgments in actions other than
an action arising upon contract or judgment for recovery of money or money
damages only. Under this provision:
 
[I]f the defendant
has been served, other than by publication, and no answer, demurrer, notice of
motion to strike of the character specified in subdivision (f), notice of
motion to transfer pursuant to Section 396b, notice of motion to dismiss
pursuant to Article 2 (commencing with Section 583.210) of Chapter 1.5 of Title
8, notice of motion to quash service of summons or to stay or dismiss the
action pursuant to Section 418.10 or notice of the filing of a petition for
writ of mandate as provided in Section 418.10 has been filed with the clerk of
the court within the time specified in the summons, or within further time as
may be allowed, the clerk, upon written application of the plaintiff, shall
enter the default of the defendant. The plaintiff thereafter may apply to the
court for the relief demanded in the complaint. The court shall hear the
evidence offered by the plaintiff, and shall render judgment in the plaintiff's
favor for that relief, not exceeding the amount stated in the complaint, in the
statement required by Section 425.11, or in the statement provided for by
Section 425.115, as appears by the evidence to be just. If the taking of an
account, or the proof of any fact, is necessary to enable the court to give
judgment or to carry the judgment into effect, the court may take the account
or hear the proof, or may, in its discretion, order a reference for that
purpose. If the action is for the recovery of damages, in whole or in part, the
court may order the damages to be assessed by a jury; or if, to determine the
amount of damages, the examination of a long account is involved, by a
reference as above provided.
 
(Code Civ. Proc. § 585(b).)

            Plaintiff’s
Requests are GRANTED as public records which may be judicially noticed as
official acts pursuant to Evidence Code section 452(c). (See SC Manufactured
Homes, Inc. v. Liebert (2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 68, 82, fn.8.) 
 
Service of Process
 
            A default
or default judgment may only issue under Code of Civil Procedure section 585(b)
“if a defendant has been served, other than by publication.” (Code Civ. Proc. §
585(b). Service of process may be accomplished via personal service (Code Civ.
Proc. § 415.10), substituted service (Id. § 415.20), or by mail (Id.
§ 415.30.) Service on a corporation may be accomplished by delivering a copy of
the summons and complaint to the person designated as agent for service of
process or to a head, senior officer, or other person authorized by the
corporation to accept service of process. (Code Civ. Proc. § 416.10 (a)-(b).) 
 
            The Amended
Proof of Service filed with the Court on February 8, 2024, states that personal
service of the Summons and Complaint was made on September 5, 2023 at 4:00 PM
on Jamie Padilla, a person authorized to accept service, at 628 S. Aviation
Boulevard, Manhattan Beach, CA 90266. According to the California Secretary of
State’s public records, this address is the address of MMTS, Inc. (RJN Exh. 3.)
MMTS Inc. is listed as the designated agent for Defendant. (RJN Exh. 1.)
Plaintiff has thus demonstrated proper service of process. 
 
Entry of Default
 
            A default
may not be entered until the time for the party to respond to the complaint has
expired. (Code Civ. Proc. § 585 (b).) When a default is sought, the default
must include an affidavit stating that it was mailed to the defendant’s
attorney of record or the last known address of the Defendant. (Code Civ. Proc.
§ 587.) 
 
            The
operative request for entry of default and default judgment was filed on
February 15, 2024, more than five months after service of the summons and
complaint. (Request for Entry of Default/Judgment.) The request was served by
mail on the same address that service of process was effected on February 15,
2024. (Id. POS.) Default was entered the date the request was filed. (Id.
p. 1.) 
 
Circumstances Voiding Default
 
            Plaintiff
has not amended the Complaint since the request was filed, and Defendant has
never appeared in the action. Moreover, although no notice of punitive damages
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 425.115(f) has been served,
Plaintiff is not seeking to recover punitive damages, notwithstanding the
prayer for such relief in the Complaint. The Court therefore finds that there
are no circumstances which warrant setting aside the default as void under Code
of Civil Procedure section 473(d) at this time. 
 
Mandatory Filings
 
            California
Rule of Court 3.1800 sets forth specific requirements for the contents of an
application for entry of default judgment:
 
A party seeking a
default judgment on declarations must use mandatory Request for Entry
of Default (Application to Enter Default) (form CIV-100), unless the
action is subject to the Fair Debt Buying Practices Act, Civil Code section
1788.50 et seq., in which case the party must use mandatory Request for
Entry of Default (Fair Debt Buying Practices Act) (form CIV-105). In
an unlawful detainer case, a party may, in addition, use optional Declaration
for Default Judgment by Court (form UD-116) when seeking a court
judgment based on declarations. The following must be included in the documents
filed with the clerk:
 
(1)  Except in
unlawful detainer cases, a brief summary of the case identifying the parties
and the nature of plaintiff's claim;
 
(2)
 Declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment
requested;
 
(3)  Interest
computations as necessary;
 
(4)  A
memorandum of costs and disbursements;
 
(5)  A
declaration of nonmilitary status for each defendant against whom judgment is
sought;
 
(6)  A
proposed form of judgment;
 
(7)  A
dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application
for separate judgment against specified parties under Code of Civil Procedure
section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment;
 
(8)  Exhibits
as necessary; and
 
(9)  A request
for attorney fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.
 
(Cal. Rules of Court Rule 3.1800(A).) Plaintiff’s request
for entry of default was submitted on form CIV-100 and includes a declaration
of nonmilitary status, a cost memorandum, and a request for attorney’s fees.
(February 15, 2024 Request for Entry of Default/Judgment.) Plaintiff also
separately filed a proposed judgment, a request for dismissal of all Doe
Defendants, and several declarations in support of the motion. Plaintiff’s
memorandum of points and authorities includes a summary of the case. (Memorandum
of Points & Authorities p.1:19-4:28.)
 
Well-Pled Allegations
 
            Plaintiff
asserted six causes of action against Defendant: (1) Conversion; (2) Aiding and
Abetting Breach of Duty of Loyalty; (3) Breach of Privacy Rights; (4) Civil
Conspiracy to Violate Penal Code section 502; (5) Violation of Penal Code
section 496; and (6) Unfair Competition.
 
            In a
default case, no evidence is required to establish liability. (Kim v.
Westmoore Partners, Inc. (2011) 201 Cal.App.4th 267, 281-82.) However, a defendant’s
failure to answer the complaint admits only well-pleaded allegations in
the complaint. (See Molen v. Friedman
(1998) 64 Cal.App.4th 1149, 1153-1154.) To obtain any form of relief, Plaintiff
must therefore have pled sufficient facts to state a cause of action.
 
//
 
1.      Conversion
 
            To
establish a claim for conversion, a plaintiff must plead and prove (1) the
plaintiff’s ownership or right to possession of property; (2) the defendant’s
conversion by wrongful act or disposition of property rights; and (3) damages.
 
            Here, the
Complaint alleges that Defendant, through its principal, knowingly interfered
with Plaintiff’s possession of its confidential claimant information by
misappropriating it and using that information for itself, causing Plaintiff to
incur monetary losses, including the costs of efforts to retrieve that
information without litigation. (Complaint ¶¶ 27-32, 35-37.) Plaintiff has
therefore pled sufficient facts to support a claim of conversion.
 
2.      Aiding
and Abetting Breach of Duty of Loyalty
 
            To allege a
breach of the duty of loyalty, a party must plead (1) the existence of a
relationship giving rise to a duty of loyalty; (2) a breach of that duty, and
(3) resulting damage proximately caused by that breach. (See, e.g., Huong
Que Inc. v. Luu (2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 400, 510.) A defendant is liable for
aiding and abetting the commission of an intentional tort if the defendant
knows the others’ conduct constitutes a breach of duty and gives substantial assistance
or encouragement to the other. (See Nasrawi v. Buck Consultants, LLC
(2014) 231 Cal.App.4th 328, 343.) 
 
            The
Complaint alleges that Keyan Aghili owed Plaintiff a duty of loyalty as a
Claimants Manager and, later, a Claims Supervisor. (Complaint ¶ 41.) The
Complaint alleges that Aghili breached that duty by stealing confidential
claimant information; and that Defendant abetted this breach by receiving that
information and hiring Aghili to do work for Defendant that created a conflict
of interest between Aghili and Plaintiff. (Complaint ¶¶ 42-46.) Plaintiff has
therefore pled a claim for aiding and abetting a breach of a duty of loyalty. 
 
3.     
Breach of Privacy Rights
 
            To allege a
breach of privacy rights, a plaintiff must plead (1) a legally protected
privacy interest; (2) a reasonable expectation of privacy; (3) the
offensiveness or seriousness of the intrusion; (4) resultant harm; and (5) that
the Defendant’s conduct was a substantial factor in causing that harm. (See Hill
v. Nat. Collegiate Athletic Assn. (1994) 7 Cal.4th 1, 24; Hernandez v.
Hillsides, Inc. (2009) 47 Cal.4th 272, 287-88.) Privacy must be evaluated
in reference to the identity of the alleged intruder and the nature of the
intrusion. (Sanders v. Am. Broadcasting Co. (1999) 20 Cal.4th 907,
914-915.)
 
            The
Complaint alleges that Plaintiff and its clients and claimants have a privacy
interest with respect to their personal information, including medical
conditions and history, employment, social security numbers, dates of birth,
and financial information, in which they had a reasonable expectation of
privacy. (Complaint ¶¶ 14, 52; Cal. Const. art. I § 1.) The Complaint alleges
that Aghili’s theft of that information and Defendant’s facilitation of that
theft is both serious and offensive, that it has harmed the clients and
claimants, and that Defendant’s conduct was a substantial factor in causing
that harm. (Id. ¶¶ 52-53.) Plaintiff, as custodian of that information,
has standing to assert the privacy interests of its customers. (See Overstock.com,
Inc. v. Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (2014) 231 Cal.App.4th 471, 503.)
Plaintiff has therefore pled facts sufficient to support this cause of action.
 
4.      Conspiracy
to Violate Penal Code Section 502
 
            To allege a
civil conspiracy, a plaintiff must plead (1) the formation and operation of the
conspiracy; (2) wrongful conduct in furtherance of that conspiracy; and (3)
resulting damages. (Wittenberg v. Bornstein (2020) 50 Cal.App.5th 303,
312 fn. 7.) To establish a claim under Penal Code section 502, Plaintiff must
prove: (1) Plaintiff is the owner of the computer system, computer network,
computer program and/or data; (2) Defendant knowingly accessed and without
permission (i) used any data, computer, computer system, or computer network in
order to wrongful control or obtain money, property, or data and/or (ii) took,
copied, or made use of any data from a computer, computer system, or computer
network, or took or copied any supporting documentation, whether existing or
residing internal or external to a computer, computer system, or computer
network; (3) Defendant’s use of the computer systems was without Plaintiff’s
permissions; (4) Plaintiff was harmed; and (5) Defendant’s conduct was a
substantial factor in causing Plaintiff’s harm. (Penal Code, § 502(c)(1)-(2).)
 
            The
Complaint plainly alleges that Aghili planned with Defendant to access
Plaintiff’s computer systems and steal customer and claimant information stored
therein for the benefit of Defendant. (Complaint ¶¶ 14-15, 18, 23-32; 58-60.)
The Complaint alleges that Defendant’s conduct harmed Plaintiff by obligating
Plaintiff to act to preserve its clients’ privacy. (Complaint ¶ 61.) Plaintiff
has therefore pled facts sufficient to support this claim.
 
5.      Violation
of Penal Code Section 496
 
            To plead a
violation of Penal Code section 496(a), a plaintiff must allege (1) that
property was stolen or obtained in a manner constituting theft; (2) the
Defendant knew the property was stolen; and (3) the Defendant received
possession of that property. (Switzer v. Wood (2019) 35 Cal.App.5th 116,
126.) 
 
            The
Complaint squarely alleges that Defendant received confidential information
which was the property of Plaintiff that was stolen by Aghili with knowledge
that the property was stolen. (Complaint ¶¶ 64-65.) Plaintiff has therefore
pled facts sufficient to support this cause of action.
 
6.      Unfair
Competition
 
            Section
17200 of the Business and Professions Code prohibits “any unlawful, unfair, or
fraudulent business practice.” (Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200.) Any person who
has been injured by a violation of section 17200 is entitled to restitution and
injunctive relief. (Bus. & Prof. Code §§ 17203, 17204.) Violation of
“[v]irtually any law—federal, state, or local—can serve as a predicate for an
action” under this section. (Ticconi v. Blue Shield of Cal. Life &
Health Ins. Co. (2008) 160 Cal.App.4th 528, 539.) This cause of action is
therefore derivative of the previous five causes of action. (See Complaint ¶
69.) Thus, as Plaintiff has pled sufficient facts to state those causes of
action, it has likewise sufficiently pled the sixth cause of action. 
 
Compensatory Damages
 
            Plaintiff
first requests an award of compensatory damages in the amount of $408,030.20. A
party who prevails on a claim for breach of a duty of loyalty is entitled to damages
which will compensate for all the detriment proximately caused by the breach.
(Civ. Code § 3333.) In the case of a breach of the duty of loyalty to an
employer by an employee, disgorgement of salary and benefits by the employee is
a proper remedy. (Service Employees Inter’l Union, Local 250 v. Colcord
(2008) 160 Cal.4th 362, 371.) However, Plaintiff cites no authority
standing for the position that disgorgement of these benefits can be sought from
Defendant, rather than from Aghili himself. Similarly, Plaintiff cites no
authority standing for the position that Business & Professions Code
section 17203 contemplates such relief. Moreover, even assuming that Plaintiff
had demonstrated its entitlement to disgorgement of Aghili’s salary from
Defendant, Plaintiff states that Kenyan Aghili’s gross salary from January 1, 2021,
through the date of his resignation was $408,030.20. This assertion is not
supported by the evidence. Although Plaintiff cites to the declaration of Victoria
Gonzales as evidence for this amount, Ms. Gonzales only states that Aghili was
paid $33,635.28 in gross salary since January 22, 2023. (Declaration of
Victoria Gonzales ISO Request for Default Judgment ¶ 16.) None of the other
papers filed by Plaintiff support the claimed amount. 
 
            Indeed, the
only monetary damages which are accounted for in the papers are the costs of
the investigation to determine what Aghili and Defendant had done to
Plaintiff’s computer systems, totaling $2,863.65. (Declaration of Michael
Kunkel ISO Request for Entry of Default ¶¶ 5-11.) Expenditures that are
“reasonable and necessarily incurred by the owner or lessee to verify that a
computer system, computer network, computer program or data was or was not
altered, damaged, or deleted by the access.” (Pen. Code § 502 (e)(1).) These
costs alone are recoverable. Further, as Plaintiff has justified these costs,
Plaintiff has likewise justified in claiming an additional $5,727.30,
accounting for treble damages under Penal Code section 496(c). 
 
            As the
request for entry of default judgment seeks compensatory damages which have not
been justified by the supporting papers, however, the Court cannot grant the
relief requested. Plaintiff must submit a new request which either eliminates
the request for Aghili’s salary or provides authority and evidence to support
that award as against Jackson Risk Management. 
 
            Because
Plaintiff has not demonstrated its entitlement to the compensatory damages
claimed, the Court does not address the request for injunctive relief or for
fees and costs at this time. 
 
CONCLUSION:
 
Plaintiff’s Motion for Entry of
Default Judgment and Permanent Injunction is CONTINUED for hearing on June 3,
2024 at 9:00 a.m.  Plaintiff is directed
to submit at least five (5) court days before the hearing additional evidence
to support its request for monetary relief of $408,030.20 or, in the
alternative, to submit a proposed default judgment reflecting the monetary
relief found to be substantiated by the Court.
