Here is the summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Travelers Commercial Insurance Co. v. Luckenbacher. The plaintiff, Travelers, moves to compel the defendant, Luckenbacher, to respond to form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and demand for production of documents, and requests sanctions. The defendant failed to respond, and no opposition was filed. The judge finds that the defendant's failure to respond waives all objections to the requests and grants the motion to compel responses. The judge also awards sanctions in the amount of $1,365, plus $184.95 in filing fees, payable within 30 days. The court orders the defendant to serve complete, verified responses, without objection, within 20 days of this order.
