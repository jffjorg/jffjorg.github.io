Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by S&S Waterproofing Inc. and Satey, defendants in a construction defect case brought by homeowner L. Kay. The defendants demurred to the second cause of action (fraud) and moved to strike punitive damages.

The judge sustained the demurrer with leave to amend, finding that the fraud cause of action has not been pleaded with the requisite specificity. Specifically, the complaint fails to allege the necessary details of the alleged misrepresentations, such as who made the representations, when and where they were made, and to whom they were made.

The judge also overruled the motion to strike punitive damages, finding that the claim is not duplicative of other causes of action and that the plaintiff has a right to plead in the alternative.

The judge's ruling is tentative and may be subject to change based on further briefing and argument.
