Travelers
Commercial Insurance Co. v. Luckenbacher, Case No. 23SMCV05929
Hearing
date July 11, 2024
Travelers’
Motions for Orders Compelling Responses to Form Interrogatories, Special
Interrogatives, and Demand for Production of Documents and Request for Monetary
Sanctions 
In this
uninsured motorist case, plaintiff moves to compel defendant’s responses to
form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and demand for production of
documents and requests sanctions. No opposition, which would have been due nine court days prior to the hearing (Code Civ. Proc. §1005(b))
was filed.
If a party to whom interrogatories or an
inspection demand were directed fails to serve a timely response, the
propounding party may move for an order compelling responses without objections.
Code Civ. Proc. §§2030.290(b), 2031.300(b). Moreover, failure to timely serve
responses waives objections to the requests. Code Civ. Proc. §§2030.290(a),
2031.300(a). Failure to verify a response is equivalent to no response at all. Appleton
v. Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 632, 636.
If a party unsuccessfully made or opposed such a
motion, the court “shall impose a monetary sanction . . . unless it finds that
the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that
other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” Code Civ.
Proc. §§2030.290(c), 2031.300(c). Sanctions may be awarded even though no
opposition was filed or the requested discovery was provided after the motion
was filed. CRC Rule 3.1348(a).
Defendant failed to respond. See generally
Volk decls. All objections to the requests are waived. 
Monetary sanctions are warranted. Plaintiff’s
counsel requests $841.65 for each motion, representing 4 hours of work (2 hours
to draft and 2 hours to prepare for and attend the hearing) at counsel’s hourly
rate of $195, plus filing fee of $61.65. 
The request for sanctions is granted in a
reduced amount because the three motions are virtually identical and are unopposed.
The court awards a total of 6 hours (5 hours to draft, 1 hour for hearing) at
$195/hour, plus filing fees of $184.95 for three motions.  
GRANTED.
Defendant to serve complete, verified responses, without objection, within 20
days of this order. The request for sanctions is GRANTED in the total amount of
$1,365, plus $184.95 in filing fees, payable within 30 days.
