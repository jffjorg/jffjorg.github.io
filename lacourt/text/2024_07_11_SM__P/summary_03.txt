And here is the English-text summary:

The Tentative Ruling grants Beattie's motion to withdraw her improperly filed answer in the lawsuit. Beattie was not served in the lawsuit and her lawyer mistakenly thought she was an insured defendant. Beattie's lawyer sought to resolve the issue with Gibbs' counsel, but a stipulation was not reached. Since the motion is unopposed, the court is exercising its discretion to allow Beattie to withdraw the answer. Gibbs will now be allowed to serve Beattie. The court notes that CCP §473(b) does not apply in this case, as it only applies to judgments and defaults, not improperly filed answers.
