And here is the English-text summary:

In the case of Rahbar v. DW Investments, LLC, et al., the judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendant's demurrer to the complaint and the defendant's motion to strike the complaint.

The plaintiff, Rahbar, sued the property owner, DW Investments, and the property manager, Wong, for premises liability, alleging that they failed to provide a safe environment and that Wong knew about a leak coming from the ceiling but did not take any action to repair it. The defendants argued that the lawsuit fails to establish a legal duty or proximate cause and that the complaint was filed too late.

The judge denied the defendant's demurrer, finding that the complaint alleges sufficient facts to establish a duty and breach, and that the plaintiff's allegations of notice and failure to act are sufficient at the pleading stage.

The judge also denied the defendant's motion to strike the complaint, finding that while the complaint was filed outside the time allotted by the Court, there is no allegation of prejudice and the parties may still amend their complaint up to and including the time of trial.

The judge ordered the defendants to file a responsive pleading within 15 days and advised the parties to adhere to court-imposed deadlines.
