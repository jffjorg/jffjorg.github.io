And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

Judge [name] has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's ex parte application for an order, motion for reconsideration, and motion for joinders and transfer of courts. The judge has determined that the relief sought must be requested by a noticed motion, not an ex parte application. Since the motion was filed as an ex parte application and lacks proof of service, the judge has taken the motion off the calendar. The plaintiff is allowed to refile the motion, obtain a new hearing date, serve the motion in compliance with Code of Civil Procedure section 1005, subdivision (a)(13), and file proof of service.
