```

And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the Cross-Complaint filed by Defendant Michael and has sustained the demurrer by Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant. The court finds that Defendant Michael has not and cannot properly allege a claim for constructive fraud. The court also finds that the wrongs Defendant Michael seeks to remedy arise out of the alleged maladministration of his mother's trust by the trustee, and that these issues should be pursued, if at all, before a probate court. The court concludes that there is no probability that Defendant Michael will be able to state a claim against Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant that is cognizable in this court, and therefore the demurrer is sustained, without leave to amend.
