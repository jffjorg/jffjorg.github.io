Legal Standard
“If, after service of a deposition
notice, a party to the action or an officer, director, managing agent, or
employee of a party, or a person designated by an organization that is a party
under Section 2025.230, without having served a valid objection under Section
2025.410, fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce
for inspection any document, electronically stored information, or tangible
thing described in the deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move
for an order compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the
production for inspection of any document, electronically stored information,
or tangible thing described in the deposition notice.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2025.450, subd. (a).)
 
“A motion under subdivision (a) shall comply with both of the
following: (1) The motion shall set forth specific facts showing good cause
justifying the production for inspection of any document, electronically stored
information, or tangible thing described in the deposition notice. (2)
The motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section
2016.040, or, when the deponent fails to attend the deposition and produce the
documents,
electronically stored information, or things described in the deposition
notice, by a declaration stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent
to inquire about the nonappearance…”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (b).)
 
“If a motion under subdivision (a)
is granted, the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) in favor of the party who noticed the
deposition and against the deponent or the party with whom the deponent is affiliated,
unless the court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (g).)
Discussion
Plaintiff moves the court to compel the following witnesses to appear for
depositions: (1) Defendant’s person most knowledgeable regarding termination
(“PMK”); (2) Dr. Kenneth Rodgers (“Rodgers”); (3) Nicoli Stamps (“Stamps”); and
(4) Janie Hannon (“Hannon”). (Motion, p. 9:2–4.)
Plaintiff’s Counsel has been attempting to schedule these depositions
since December 6, 2023 and served a deposition notice regarding Defendant’s PMK
on January 8, 2024. (Decl. Huerta, Exhs. 1, 4.) Further notices were sent to Stamps
and Hannon. (Decl. Huerta, Exhs. 17-18.) Rodgers’ deposition was scheduled for
March 28, 2024. (Decl. Huerta, ¶20.) Despite months of efforts, it appears that
none of these depositions have yet occurred. (Decl. Huerta, ¶ 31.).
Defendant does not oppose or otherwise respond to the Motion.
            Plaintiff has the right to depose Defendant’s
PMK and other witnesses in a timely manner. That has not occurred here. As more
than thirty days have passed since Plaintiff noticed these depositions without
the depositions occurring or Defendant making a meritorious objection, Plaintiff
has shown good cause for the motion.
As to monetary sanctions, the court does not have any evidence before it that would
indicate there is substantial justification or other circumstances that would
make the imposition of a sanction unjust. Thus, the court must impose a
monetary sanction. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (g).) 
Plaintiff
seeks sanctions against Defendant and/or Defense
Counsel in the amount of $6,593.91. (Motion, p. 9:4–7.) According to
Plaintiff’s Counsel, this accounts for: (1) eight hours of work at $450.00 per
hour by Counsel Guardado; (2) 4.5 hours of work at $650.00 per hour by Counsel
Huerta; and (3) $68.91 in costs. (Id. at p. 8:19–22.)
Utilizing a Lodestar approach, and
in view of the totality of the circumstances, the court finds that the total
and reasonable amount of attorney’s fees and costs incurred for the work
performed in connection with the pending motion is $1,718.91 (i.e., 3 hours at
$350.00/hour for Counsel Guardado, 1 hour at $600.00 for Counsel Huerta, plus
$68.91 filing fee).[1]
The hourly rates and numbers of hours by both
attorneys are not reasonable. Moreover, there is no opposition to the Motion,
thus two hours each counsel anticipated have not materialized. Further, this is
boilerplate motion that should not have required as much work as is claimed.
The court awards three hours of work at a reduced hourly rate for Counsel
Guardado, 1 hour of work at a reduced hourly rate for Counsel Huerta, and all
the requested costs. 
Sanctions are payable within 20
days from the date of service of the notice of ruling.Conclusion
The Motion is GRANTED in part.
Defendant shall make its witnesses (including its person most knowledgeable
regarding termination, Dr. Kenneth
Rodgers, Nicoli Stamps, and Janie Hannon) available for deposition
within thirty (30) days of the issuance of this Order. 
            Monetary sanctions are AWARDED in
favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant in the total amount of $1,718.91.
