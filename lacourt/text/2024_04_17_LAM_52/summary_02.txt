And here is the English summary of the Tentative Ruling:

The Judge rules on the motions filed by the parties in the case. Cross-complainant Peter Presnell moves for leave to file a second amended cross-complaint, which is granted. The Judge also rules on the demurrer filed by the defendants to the second amended complaint, which is overruled. The demurrer was filed with respect to two causes of action: involuntary dissolution of the corporation and declaratory relief. The Judge finds that the allegations of suspect conduct by the defendants are sufficient to show that liquidation is reasonably necessary to protect the plaintiff's rights and interests. The defendants' argument that the court's ruling on their claim for relief under Corporations Code section 709 serves as res judicata for the plaintiff's cause of action for declaratory relief is rejected. The Judge finds that there was no prior action or proceeding as required for res judicata.
