MATTER


Request for Default Judgment



 
Plaintiff Francisco Becerra (“Plaintiff”) requests for default
judgment against Defendant Lee Capital Builders, Inc. (“Defendant”)
in the amount of $65,700.77, which is composed of special damages in the amount
of $54,160; prejudgment interest in the amount of $5,416; costs in the amount
of $574.77; and attorneys’ fees in the amount of $5,550.00.
 
            a.         Damages 
 
            Plaintiff’s
Complaint alleges six causes of action for (1) Failure to Pay Overtime
Compensation; (2) Failure to Pay Minimum Wage; (3) Failure to Pay Wages Due
Upon Termination; Waiting Time Penalties; (4) Failure to Issue Accurate and
Itemized Wage Statements; (5) Failure to Indemnify; and (6) Unlawful Business
Practices. Defendant was served with a copy of the summons and complaint via substitute
service on June 30, 2023. Default was entered against Defendant on November 6,
2023, and the Doe defendants were dismissed on February 6, 2024. 
 
            Plaintiff’s
Complaint seeks only $4,000 in connection with the fourth cause of action, but
otherwise does not specify a specific amount of damages sought.  However, the Court cannot award damages that
are in excess of what is pled in the Complaint. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 580,
subd. (a) [“The relief granted to the plaintiff, if there is no answer, cannot
exceed that demanded in the complaint”]; Levine v. Smith (2006)
145 Cal.App.4th 1131, 1136-1137 [“when recovering damages in a default
judgment, the plaintiff is limited to the damages specified in the complaint”].)  
 
            Moreover, although Plaintiff has
provided an explanation of the requested damages in the memorandum of points
and authorities, Plaintiff has not provided any evidentiary support for the requested
damages.
 
            Therefore, the Court cannot award
the requested damages. 
 
c.         Prejudgment
Interest 
 
            Plaintiff
also seeks prejudgment interest in the amount of $5,416, which represents 10%
of the requested principal damages of $54,160. 
As discussed above, because Plaintiff has not demonstrated an
entitlement to the requested principal damages, the Court similarly cannot
award prejudgment interest based on this amount.  Moreover, Plaintiff has not demonstrated that
the contractual 10% rate applies, as opposed to the default 7% rate. Furthermore,
the interest is calculated per annum, and there is no evidence in the record
demonstrating when the principal amount came due.  
 
            Therefore,
the Court cannot award the requested prejudgment interest.  

 
            d.         Attorney Fees and Costs 
 
Code of Civil Procedure
section 1033.5, which outlines recoverable costs to a prevailing party under
Code of Civil Procedure section 1032, permits the recovery of attorneys’ fees
when authorized by contract, statute, or law. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (a)(10).)  Code of Civil Procedure section 1021 provides
“[e]xcept as attorney’s fees are specifically provided for by statute, the
measure and mode of compensation of attorneys and counselors at law is left to
the agreement, express or implied, of the parties [….]”  Similarly, Civil Code section 1717 provides
“[i]n any action on a contract, where the contract specifically provides that
attorney’s fees and costs, which are incurred to enforce that contract, shall
be awarded either to one of the parties or to the prevailing party, then the
party who is determined to be the party prevailing on the contract, whether he
or she is the party specified in the contract or not, shall be entitled to
reasonable attorney’s fees in addition to other costs.”  (Civ. Code, § 1717, subd. (a).)
 
The Code of Civil Procedure defines the “prevailing party” as follows:

 
[T]he party with a net monetary recovery, a defendant in whose favor a
dismissal is entered, a defendant where neither plaintiff nor defendant obtains
any relief, and a defendant as against those plaintiffs who do not recover any
relief against that defendant. If any party recovers other than monetary relief
and in situations other than as specified, the “prevailing party” shall be as
determined by the court, and under those circumstances, the court, in its
discretion, may allow costs or not and, if allowed, may apportion costs between
the parties on the same or adverse sides pursuant to rules adopted under
Section 1034.
 
(Code
Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd. (a)(4).)
            
            Labor Code
section 1194 provides for the recovery of reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs
in a suit to recover the legal minimum wage and overtime.  
 
            Here, Plaintiff
has provided the attorney declaration of Baruch Kreiman substantiating the
requested $5,550 in attorneys’ fees.
 
            Plaintiff also requests $574.77 in costs composed of $526.77 in filing fees and $48.00 in process server fees.
(CIV-100.) Plaintiff’s request for costs is granted as Plaintiff is the
prevailing party in this action.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd. (a)(4).)
 
CONCLUSION
 
            Plaintiff’s
request is denied without prejudice.  Plaintiff’s
requested damages exceed the damages demanded in the operative complaint, and
Plaintiff has not provided evidentiary support for the requested damages or
prejudgment interest. Therefore, the Court cannot award Plaintiff’s requested
damages or prejudgment interest.  
            
            Further, the
Order to Show Cause re Entry of Default Judgment is continued to July 29,
2024 at 8:30 A.M. in Department 207. 
Plaintiff’s renewed Request for Default Judgment in conformance with the
Court’s ruling shall be filed on or before July 8, 2024.  
 
            The Clerk of the
Court shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling.
