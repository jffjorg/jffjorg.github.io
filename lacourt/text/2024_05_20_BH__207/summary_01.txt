Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court denies the plaintiff's request for a default judgment in the amount of $65,700.77, which includes damages, prejudgment interest, attorneys' fees, and costs. The court finds that the plaintiff has not provided sufficient evidence to support the damages and prejudgment interest requested. The court also finds that the plaintiff has not demonstrated an entitlement to the requested damages and prejudgment interest. The court grants the plaintiff's request for attorneys' fees and costs, which are calculated at $5,550 and $574.77, respectively. The court continues the Order to Show Cause re Entry of Default Judgment to July 29, 2024, and requires the plaintiff to file a renewed request for default judgment in conformance with the court's ruling by July 8, 2024.
