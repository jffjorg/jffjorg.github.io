And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted a continuance of the motion for summary judgment filed by defendants Ashken Pogosyan and Douglas F. Jewett, pending further discovery. The opposition to the motion was filed four days late, and the court notes that this is the second time the opposition has been filed late. The court has cautioned the plaintiffs that in the future, it may refuse to consider papers not filed in conformity with the statutes, rules, and procedures governing the litigation.

The continuance will allow plaintiffs to conduct depositions of two police officers and the defendants, and to complete discovery by February 13, 2025. The court will expect the parties to be prepared to schedule the discovery at the hearing and to add those dates to the order.

The court has also granted a continuance of the hearing to March 28, 2025, and has set a deadline for plaintiffs to file and serve any supplemental opposition by February 13, 2025.
