And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Harooni v. Severo, granting a demurrer to the complaint with leave to amend. The court finds that the complaint fails to adequately allege the existence of a written contract, as well as the nature of the contract and each of its essential terms. The court also finds that the complaint fails to adequately allege the elements of a cause of action for breach of contract, including plaintiff's performance, defendant's breach, and damages. Additionally, the court finds that the complaint fails to adequately allege the elements of a cause of action for misrepresentation, including a false representation, actual or implied, or concealment of a matter of fact material to the transaction.

The court orders the parties to engage in the required meet and confer process before the matter will be called for hearing. The court also orders the parties to file the required declarations and to correct any typographical errors in the pleading.

In its discretion, the court has considered the untimely opposition to the motion, filed four court days late. The court will hear argument from defendant concerning whether defendant would like an opportunity to file further reply, given the tentative ruling.

The court grants the demurrer with leave to amend, and orders the parties to file an amended pleading within 30 days. The court also orders the parties to meet and confer in full compliance with CCP § 430.41 before any further demurrer may be filed.
