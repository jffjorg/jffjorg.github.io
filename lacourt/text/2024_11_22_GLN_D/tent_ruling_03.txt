 Case Number:  23GDCV01397    Hearing Date:   November 22, 2024    Dept:  D TENTATIVE RULINGSCalendar: 1Date: 11/22/2024Case No.:  23 GDCV01397Case Name: Hwang v. Hyundai Motor America MOTION FOR ATTORNEY FEES Moving Party: Plaintiff Jimmy Hwang  Responding Party: Defendants Hyundai Motor America RELIEF REQUESTED:Attorney fees in the amount of $38,705.00, an additional $5,000 to review opposition and costs and expenses in the amount of $911.26.FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND;Plaintiff Jimmy Hwang alleges that in January of 2017, plaintiff purchased a 2017 Hyundai Sonata Hybrid vehicle which was manufactured or distributed by defendant Hyundai Motor America.  Plaintiff alleges that in connection with the purchase, plaintiff received an express written warranty in which defendant undertook to preserve of maintain the utility or performance of the vehicle or to provide compensation if there is a failure in utility or performance.   After plaintiff took possession of the vehicle, and during the warranty period, the vehicle contained or developed defects which substantially impair the use, safety and/or value of the vehicle, including defects in the engine system, hybrid warning system, as well as noise, vibration and harshness relating to a rattle like noise during cold-starts.  Plaintiff alleges that plaintiff provided defendant and its representatives sufficient opportunity to service or repair the vehicle, but defendant and its representatives were unable or failed to service or repair the vehicle within a reasonable number of repair attempts.  Plaintiff alleges that despite this fact, defendant has failed to promptly replace the vehicle or make restitution to plaintiff.    The file shows that on April 25, 2024, plaintiff filed a Notice of Settlement of Entire Case.     ANALYSIS:Under CCP §1032 (b), “Except as otherwise expressly provided by statute, a prevailing party is entitled as a matter of right to recover costs in any action or proceeding.”  CCP § 1033.5 (a) provides that an allowable cost under §1032 includes attorney’s fees, when authorized by contract, statute or law.  CCP § 1033.5 (a)(10).    The fees here are sought under statute, specifically Civil Code § 1794 (d), which provides with respect to consumer warranty protection:“(d) If the buyer prevails in an action under this section, the buyer shall be allowed by the court to recover as part of the judgment a sum equal to the aggregate amount of costs and expenses, including attorney's fees based on actual time expended, determined by the court to have been reasonably incurred by the buyer in connection with the commencement and prosecution of such action.”Plaintiff indicates in the motion that defendant Hyundai also has agreed to resolve attorneys’ fees and costs and expenses by a single combined motion to be decided by this court.  It appears from the opposition that there is no dispute here that plaintiff is the prevailing party under section 1784 (d), entitled to attorney's fees actually and reasonably incurred in the commencement and prosecution of this action.   This posture leaves the issue of the reasonableness of the attorney’s fees sought by plaintiff.    The California Supreme Court in PLCM Group, Inc. v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084 established the standard for evaluating the appropriate amount of attorney’s fees to be awarded:   “[T]he fee setting inquiry in California ordinarily begins with the "lodestar," i.e., the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate. "California courts have consistently held that a computation of time spent on a case and the reasonable value of that time is fundamental to a determination of an appropriate attorneys' fee award."   Margolin v. Regional Planning Com.  (1982) 134 Cal. App. 3d 999, 1004 1005 [185 Cal. Rptr. 145].) The reasonable hourly rate is that prevailing in the community for similar work.  Id. at p. 1004;   Shaffer v. Superior Court (1995) 33 Cal. App. 4th 993, 1002  [39 Cal. Rptr. 2d 506].) The lodestar figure may then be adjusted, based on consideration of factors specific to the case, in order to fix the fee at the fair market value for the legal services provided. (Serrano v. Priest, supra, 20 Cal. 3d at p. 49 .) Such an approach anchors the trial court's analysis to an objective determination of the value of the attorney's services, ensuring that the amount awarded is not arbitrary. ( Id. at p. 48, fn. 23.)...After the trial court has performed the calculations of the lodestar, it shall consider whether the total award so calculated under all of the circumstances of the case is more than a reasonable amount and, if so, shall reduce the section 1717 award so that it is a reasonable figure"It is well established that the determination of what constitutesreasonable attorney fees is committed to the discretion of the trial court . . .  [Citations.]   The value of legal services performed in a case is a matter in which the trial court has its own expertise. [Citation.] The trial court may make its own determination of the value of the services contrary to, or without the necessity for, expert testimony. [Citations.] The trial courtmakes its determination after consideration of a number of factors, including the nature of the litigation, its difficulty,  the amount involved, the skill required in its handling, the skill employed, the attention given, the success or failure, and other circumstances in the case." ( Melnyk v.Robledo (1976) 64 Cal. App. 3d 618, 623 624 [134 Cal. Rptr. 602].)PLCM, at 1095. (emphasis added).The court also held that the standard of review with respect to this determination is abuse of discretion: “The ‘experienced trial judge is the best judge of the value of professional services rendered in his court, and while his judgment is of course subject to review, it will not be disturbed unless the appellate court is convinced that it is clearly wrong’-- meaning that it abused its discretion.”PLCM at 1094, quoting Serrano v. Priest (1977) 20 Cal.3d 25, 49. It has been held that in that in connection with attorneys’ fees award under the Song-Beverly Act, as sought here:“The statute “requires the trial court to make an initial determination of the actual time expended; and then to ascertain whether under all the circumstances of the case the amount of actual time expended and the monetary charge being made for the time expended are reasonable. These circumstances may include, but are not limited to, factors such as the complexity of the case and procedural demands, the skill exhibited and the results achieved. If the time expended or the monetary charge being made for the time expended are not reasonable under all the circumstances, then the court must take this into account and award attorney fees in a lesser amount. A prevailing buyer has the burden of ‘showing that the fees incurred were “allowable,” were “reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation,” and were “reasonable in amount.” ’ ”Goglin v. BMW of North America, LLC (2016) 4 Cal.App.5th 462, 470, quoting Nightingale v. Hundai Motor America (1994) 31 Cal.App.4th 99, 104.   An award of attorney fees under the Song-Beverly Act is reviewed for abuse of discretion, and the determination of the value of professional services rendered in the trial court “will not be disturbed unless the appellate court is convinced that it is clearly wrong.”   Goglin, at  470-471, quoting Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 967, 998.  The total sought here is 73.8 hours to date (53.20 hours by attorney Benjeman Beck, and 20.6 hours by attorney Misoo Choi) at billing rates of $525 for the 2023 calendar year and $550 for the 2024 calendar year, for a total of $38,705.00, plus an additional $5,000 to review opposition.  Plaintiff seeks costs and expenses in the amount of $911.26.  The grand total sought is $44,616.26.  [Beck Decl., para. 61].  The opposition indicates that defendant does not object to $911.26 in costs as set forth in the memorandum of costs, and these will be awarded in full as requested.  The opposition argues that the billing rates charged of $525 and $550 are excessive.  Defendant argues that it is not explained how these rates are justified for attorney Choi, and plaintiff has provided no evidence that any client has actually paid the rates.    Defendant argues that defense firms typically charge approximately $200 to $250 per hour, including for seasoned practitioners, and that this low rate reflects the highly competitive nature of the legal market and the saturation of attorneys in the area of lemon law litigation.  Plaintiff suggests a rate of $400 per hour for attorney Beck, and a rate of $200 per hour for attorney Choi, as her primary role was speaking with the client, and involved no legal work. Plaintiff has submitted evidence concerning the attorneys’ experience and specialty within the field.  [See Choi Decl., paras. 1-4; Beck Decl., paras. 47-60, Exs. 7- 14].  The billings attached show that the rates were being charged at the stated rates.  [See Choi Decl., Ex. 1; Beck Decl., Ex. 14].  Each side has pointed to cases in which both higher and lower rates have been awarded, which supports a finding that the rates fall within the expected range of rates in such a case.  Plaintiff’s counsel has also represented that the firm accepted the case on a contingency basis. [Beck Decl., para. 62].  Plaintiff is not seeking a multiplier.  The court applies the billing rates as requested.   However, the court in examining the hours spent will keep in mind that at such a rate there should be efficiencies in conducting the litigation which flow from the level of experience.  With respect to the hours claimed, the opposition argues that the hours spent are inflated and were unnecessary beyond any activity which occurred after July 11, 2023, when defendant emailed plaintiff’s counsel a letter offering to repurchase the vehicle, or, in the alternative, plaintiff could keep the vehicle and Hyundai would pay plaintiff $7,000 in cash.  Defendant requested financial documents to calculate the amount of the repurchase.  [Hooper Decl., para. 7, Exs. E1, E2].  Defendant argues that absent from the billing records is an entry for relaying the repurchase offer to the client.   The argument seems to be that any fees incurred after the repurchase offer were incurred not to resolve the matter but to generate fees, and the court should deny any further fees to discourage the refusal to accept a reasonable repurchase offer or the failure to pass on an offer to the client.   The court does find it concerning that there was an early repurchase offer, and that there was no response to the July 11, 2023 letter, which in turn led to defendant having to request through formal discovery documentation to determine the repurchase value, and to respond to the complaint and otherwise defend this action.  However, the offer did not include a solid repurchase figure at that point, and so it is not clear that the offer would have been considered reasonable.          Defendant also challenges specific charges from the billing records.  Defendant seeks to reduce the charges made by attorney Choi, arguing that this case was litigated by two separate law firms, and Choi’s time was not necessary, overstated, or duplicative when Beck is experienced lemon law counsel.  The court has reviewed the billings and agrees that the entry to check the case status at .8 hours on November 11, 2023 when the case was not filed until six months later should not be awarded.  The court also finds that a meeting with the client on August 11, 2023 regarding the case status and new repair orders, when there was only one repair order at issue, should have only taken .5 hours, for a reduction of .7 hours.   The court also finds that the several entries regarding case status discussions with the client which exceeded half an hour should be subject to reduction, and will apply a 1 hour reduction at the $525 billing rate to those communications between September 28, 2023 and February 19, 2024. The court will also reduce by 2 hours the time spent to explain the 998 offer to the client in March of 2024, and by 1 hour the time to explain the repurchase process from March to July of 2024. The court will also reduce from the fees the time claimed for this second attorney to review the case status, a total reduction of 4.3 hours, or $2,365.00 as requested by defendant, and the time to discuss a motion to compel with co-counsel on October 20, 2023, for a reduction of 1.4 hours, or $770.  The total fees sought for work performed by Choi is $11,330.00, according to the billing records.  [Choi Decl., Ex. 1].  This total time will be reduced as discussed above by .8 hours at $525 ($420), .7 hours at $525 (367.50), 1 hour at $525 ($525),  2 hours at $550 ($1,100), 1 hour at $550 ($550), 4.3 hours at the proper rates ($2,365) and 1.4 hours at $525 ($735)  This totals a reduction of $6,062.50. Reducing this from the $11,330.00 claimed leaves a total for Choi’s work of $5,267.50.       With respect to the Beck billings, the court has reviewed the billings, and plaintiff’s arguments, as well as the chart attached to the Hooper Declaration as Exhibit A, and finds that the following reductions are warranted.  The court finds that the opposition to defendant’s motion to strike, which appears to be a standard response filed in these types of matters, and not difficult to adapt to this matter, should have taken no more than six hours, not the total claimed of 11.9 hours.  A reduction of 5.9 hours at $525 will be taken.  The court also finds that the time spent on a motion to compel further responses to document demands of 12.5 hours is excessive, particularly in light of the 2.9 hours spent preparing a meet and confer letter, which should have served as a template for the motion, and the fact that this matter was governed by a case management order regarding discovery, which should have streamlined the process.  The billings reflect multiple instances when counsel reviewed that order.  The court will allow 6 hours for this motion. A reduction of 6.5 hours at $525 per hour will be taken.   The total fees sought for work performed by Beck is $27,405.00, according to the billing records.  [Beck Decl., Ex. 14].  This total time will be reduced as discussed above by 5.9 hours at $525 ($3,097.50) and 6.5 hours at $525 ($3,412.50).  This totals a reduction of $6,510.00 Reducing this from the $27,405.00 claimed leaves a total for Beck’s work of $20,895.00.        The court will also award $5,000 in fees for attorney Beck to review the opposition to this motion, prepare the reply, appear at the hearing on this motion, and prepare a notice of ruling, which sum is not challenged in the opposition, and appears warranted given the detailed opposition. [Beck Decl., para. 61].The total fees awarded will be $5,267.50 for Choi’s work, $20,895 plus $5,000 ($25,895) for Beck’s work for a total of $26,421.50 in fees. RULING:Plaintiff’s Amended Motion for Attorney Fees, Costs and Expenses is  GRANTED.The Court finds that the parties agree that plaintiff Jimmy Hwang was a  prevailing party in the action, and so is under Civil Code § 1794 (d) allowed by the court to recover as part of the judgment a sum to cover attorney's fees based on actual time expended, and determined by the court to have been reasonably incurred by the buyer in connection with the commencement and prosecution of this action.The Court finds that reasonable attorney’s fees and expenses are:Lodestar Adjusted= $26,421.50 Expenses= $911.26. Total Award= $27,332.76.  The total award of $27,332.76  [$44,616.26 sought] is to be awarded to plaintiff Jimmy Hwang against defendant Hyundai Motor America and added to the judgment.    Plaintiff’s UNOPPOSED Request for Judicial Notice in Support of Plaintiff’s Amended Motion for Attorney Fees is GRANTED. DEPARTMENT D IS CONTINUING TO CONDUCT AND ENCOURAGE AUDIO OR VIDEO APPEARANCESPlease make arrangement in advance if you wish to appear via LACourtConnect by visiting www.lacourt.org to schedule a remote appearance.  Please note that LACourtConnect offers free audio and video appearances.  However, ADVANCE REGISTRATION IS REQUIRED. If no appearance is set up through LACourtConnect, or no appearance is otherwise made, then the Court will assume the parties are submitting on the tentative.
