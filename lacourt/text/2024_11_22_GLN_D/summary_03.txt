And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's amended motion for attorney fees, costs, and expenses. The plaintiff, Jimmy Hwang, purchased a 2017 Hyundai Sonata Hybrid vehicle with a warranty, but the vehicle developed defects and the defendant, Hyundai Motor America, failed to service or repair it. The plaintiff filed a lawsuit and the defendant opposed the motion for attorney fees.

The judge found that the plaintiff was a prevailing party in the action and is entitled to recover attorney's fees based on actual time expended and reasonably incurred by the buyer in connection with the commencement and prosecution of the action. The judge determined that reasonable attorney's fees and expenses were $26,421.50, plus expenses of $911.26, for a total award of $27,332.76. The award will be added to the judgment in favor of the plaintiff.

The judge also granted the plaintiff's unopposed request for judicial notice in support of the amended motion for attorney fees.
