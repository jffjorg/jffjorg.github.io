And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer to the Second Amended Complaint filed by plaintiff Cary Atwood against defendants Allyn Emery and Loma Law Group, APC. The court has sustained the demurrer to the breach of contract cause of action and the quantum meruit cause of action. The court has also denied leave to amend. The ruling is based on the court's finding that Lyran Consulting, Inc., which is a foreign corporation, is not qualified to do business in California and therefore its assignee, Atwood, is also barred from maintaining an action in California courts. The court has granted judicial notice of various documents from the Secretary of State's website concerning Lyran Consulting, Inc. The parties are ordered to give notice of their intention to submit on the tentative ruling.
