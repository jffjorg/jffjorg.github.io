```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the defendant's motion to deem the requests for admission (RFAs) admitted. The plaintiff's responses to the RFAs were untimely and not code-compliant, but the judge finds that deeming them admitted would be unduly harsh. Instead, the judge orders the plaintiff to serve supplemental responses in full compliance with the Code within ten days. The judge also notes that the motion must be denied if the requests are in "substantial compliance with the Code," and finds that this means the motion must be denied even if the responses are less than perfect. The judge does not impose sanctions and orders the defendant to give notice.
