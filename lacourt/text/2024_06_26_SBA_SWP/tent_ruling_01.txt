  Case Number:  21TRCV00527    Hearing Date:   June 26, 2024    Dept:  SWP ELLA SIMS, Plaintiff, vs. PURNELL WILLIAMS, et al., Defendants.  CASE NO: 21TRCV00527 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE: PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO COMPEL DISCOVERY (DOCUMENT PRODUCTION) RESPONSES AND REQUEST FOR MONETARY SANCTIONS Dept. P 8:30 a.m. June 26, 2024Having considered plaintiff’s motion and the associated exhibits thereto, the court rules as follows: the motion to compel discovery (document production) responses and request for monetary sanctions is GRANTED IN PART.I. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUNDOn July 21, 2021, Plaintiff Ella Sims (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint against Defendants Purnell Williams (“Williams”), All Claiming Any Equitable Right, Title, Estate, Lien or Interest in the Property Commonly Known as 10203 Dixon Avenue, Inglewood, CA 90303, and Does 1 to 20, inclusive, alleging causes of action for: (1) Declaratory Relief; (2) Quiet Title; (3) Breach of Contract—Specific Performance; (4) Breach of Fiduciary Duty; (5) Constructive Trust; (6) Accounting; (7) Fraud; and (8) Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress.On August 30, 2021, Defendant Williams filed an Answer to the Complaint.After multiple reassignments, this action was ultimately assigned to the Honorable David K. Reinert sitting in Department P at Torrance Courthouse effective January 29, 2024.On May 28, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to Compel Discovery (Document Production) Responses and Request for Monetary Sanctions. Plaintiff seeks an order compelling Defendant Williams to respond, without objection, to Plaintiff’s: (1) Request for Production ofDocuments (Set Three); and (2) Request for Production of Documents (Set Four) (collectively, the “RFPs”). Plaintiff also requests monetary sanctions in the amount of $3,970.00 against Defendant Williams and his counsel of record. Plaintiff’s request for sanctions includes the instant motion as well as another discovery motion which is scheduled for hearing on June 25, 2024.As of June 21, 2024, Plaintiff’s motion to compel is unopposed. Any opposition to the motion was required to have been filed and served at least nine court days prior to the hearing. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005, subd. (b).) Given that the motion is unopposed, there is an inference that the motion is meritorious. (Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.)II. FACTUAL BACKGROUNDPlaintiffs alleges that Defendant Williams has failed to honor his promise and reconvey to her interest in a parcel of real property. (Complaint, ¶¶ 6-15.)III. LEGAL STANDARD“Any party may obtain discovery . . . by inspecting, copying, testing, or sampling documents, tangible things, land or other property, and electronically stored information in the possession, custody, or control of any other party to the action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.010, subd. (a).) Where a party fails to timely respond to demand for inspection, copying, testing or sampling “[t]he party to whom the demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed waives any objection to the demand, including one based on privilege or on the protection for work product.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).) Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.300(b) provides that “[t]he party making the demand may move for an order compelling response to the demand.”Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.010(d) provides that a misuse of the discovery process is failing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery. Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.010(h) states that a misuse of the discovery process includes making or opposing, unsuccessfully and without substantial justification, a motion to compel or limit discovery. A court may impose a monetary sanction against a party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process or any attorney advising such conduct under Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.030(a). A court has discretion to fix the amount of reasonable monetary sanctions. (Cornerstone Realty Advisors, LLC v. Summit Healthcare Reit, Inc. (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th 771, 791.)IV. DISCUSSIONMoving Party’s ArgumentsPlaintiff argues that Defendant Williams has failed to provide responses to the discovery at issue and that monetary sanctions should be imposed against Defendant Williams and his counsel.Responding Party’s OppositionAs of June 21, 2024, the motion is unopposed.Moving Party’s ReplyAs of June 21, 2024, no reply brief has been filed.Merits of the MotionPlaintiff propounded the RFPs on Defendant Williams on March 7 and March 11, 2024. (Sarni Decl., ¶¶ 5, 8; Exhs. 3, 5.) To date, no responses to the RFPs have been received. (Sarni Decl., ¶ 9.) Counsel states that his hourly rate is $350.00 per hour, and he has spent in excess of 11 hours on the instant motion and the motion to compel responses to interrogatories, which includes time anticipated reviewing the oppositions, preparing the reply briefs, and appearing at the hearing on the motions. (Sarni Decl., ¶ 11.) Counsel states that $120.00 in costs were incurred as to the instant motion and separate motion to compel responses to interrogatories. (Sarni Decl., ¶ 11.) Plaintiff requests sanctions of $3,970.00 as to both motions. (Sarni Decl., ¶ 11.)The instant motion is unopposed, is straightforward in nature, and is not complex. The Court GRANTS IN PART Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions as to the instant motion and AWARDS Plaintiff reasonable monetary sanctions in the amount of $760.00 (representing two hours of work at the rate of $350.00 per hour plus the $60.00 filing fee). The Court reduces the total hours given the lack of opposition and lack of complexity of the instant motion.The Court notes that there appears to be an error on the proof of service concerning Plaintiff’s Request for Production of Documents, Set Three. (Sarni Decl., ¶ 5; Exh. 3.) The proof of service concerning such discovery reflects service of Plaintiff’s Request for Production of Documents, Set One on Defendant Williams on March 7, 2024. (Sarni Decl., ¶ 5; Exh. 3.) Without a proof of service showing that Defendant Williams was actually served with Plaintiff’s Request for Production of Documents, Set Three, the Court will not compel the responses of Defendant Williams thereto.The Court therefore DENIES Plaintiff’s request to compel Defendant Williams’ Responses to Plaintiff’s Request for Production of Documents, Set Three due to the lack of a proof of service showing service of such discovery on Defendant Williams.However, the Court ORDERS Defendant Williams to provide verified, complete, and code-compliant responses to Plaintiff’s Request for Production of Documents, Set Four, without objections, within 30 days of the date of notice of this order.V. CONCLUSIONBased on the foregoing, the Motion to Compel Discovery (Document Production) Responses is GRANTED IN PART. Defendant Williams is ORDERED to provide verified, complete, and code-compliant responses, without objections, to Set Four of Plaintiff’s Request for Production of Documents within 30 days of the date of notice of this order.The Court DENIES Plaintiff’s request to compel Defendant Williams’ Responses to Plaintiff’s Request for Production of Documents, Set Three.The Court also ORDERS that Defendant Williams and his counsel of record pay monetary sanctions, jointly and severally, to Plaintiff in the amount of $760.00 within 30 days of the date of notice of this order. Such monetary sanctions concern only the instant motion.Plaintiff Ella Sims to give notice.The Motion to Compel Discovery (Document Production) Responses and Request for Monetary Sanctions filed by Plaintiff Ella Sims on 05/28/2024 is granted in part.
