P 8:30 a.m. June 26, 2024Having considered plaintiffs’ motion, defendants’ opposition, and the associated declarations and exhibits thereto, the court rules as follows: the motion to strike costs or, alternatively, tax costs is DENIED.I. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUNDOn February 1, 2023, Plaintiffs Theodore Halkias and Jill Halkias (collectively, the “Plaintiffs”) filed an Unlawful Detainer Complaint (the “Complaint”) against Defendants Rory Kuhn, Je’Nai Kuhn (collectively, the “Defendants”), and Does 1 to 10.On February 27, 2023, Defendants filed an Answer to the Complaint.On June 8, 2023, after hearing oral argument and taking the matter under submission, the Honorable Deirdre Hill sitting in Department M of this Court granted Defendants’ motion for judgment on the pleadings. (06/08/23 Minute Order.)On October 5, 2023, the Court entered judgment in favor of Defendants and against Plaintiffs. Defendants were deemed the prevailing parties and were awarded possession of the property. (10/05/23 Judgment.)On October 16, 2023, Defendants filed a Memorandum of Costs (Summary) in which Defendants sought $948.58 in costs.On October 16, 2023, Defendants filed a Motion for Attorneys’ Fees, which Plaintiffs opposed. Defendants sought attorneys’ fees in the sum of $5,000.00 pursuant to the clause in the rental lease which indicated that the prevailing party shall be entitled to reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs not to exceed $5,000.00. (Motion for Attorneys’ Fees at p. 1:21-28.)On January 12, 2024, this action was reassigned to the Honorable Douglas W. Stern sitting in Department B at Torrance Courthouse effective January 16, 2024.On January 22, 2024, after hearing oral argument, the Court granted Defendants’ Motion for Attorneys’ Fees and awarded Defendants attorneys’ fees in the amount of $4,051.42. (01/22/24 Minute Order.)On January 24, 2024, this action was reassigned to the Honorable David K. Reinert sitting in Department P at Torrance Courthouse effective January 24, 2024.On February 27, 2024, the Court entered an order indicating that, pursuant to the Motion for Attorneys’ Fees, “the Court concluded that the maximum award for attorneys fees and costs to the prevailing party for the matter at present would not exceed $5,000.00 collectively. Given Defendants’ memorandum of costs totaling $948.58, the Court grants Defendants motion for attorneys fees and awards $4,051.42 in attorney fees. Defendants Rory Kuhn and Je’Nai Kuhn are awarded $4,051.42 in attorneys’ fees, payable by Plaintiffs to Defense Counsel ‘Casey M. Law, PC’ and mailed or delivered to 1250 W. Glenoaks Blvd STEE [sic] #419, Glendale, CA 91201.” (02/27/24 Order at p. 1:22-28.)On April 23, 2024, Defendants filed an Abstract of Judgment, which identified Defendants as judgment creditors and Plaintiffs as judgment debtors.Also, on April 23, 2024, Defendants filed a Notice of Association of Counsel, which indicated that their counsel associated in Kevin Hermansen/Law Offices of Kevin P. Hermansen, P.C. as counsel for Defendants.On May 8, 2024, Plaintiffs filed an Application and Order for Appearance and Examination for Enforcement of Judgment as to Plaintiff Theodore Halkias.On May 9, 2024, Defendants filed and served a Memorandum of Costs After Judgment, Acknowledgment of Credit, and Declaration of Accrued Interest (the “Costs Memorandum”). Defendants indicate that post-judgment costs total $6,275.71, of which $5,850.00 is for attorneys’ fees. (Costs Memorandum at ¶ 1(a)(7).)On May 16, 2024, Plaintiffs filed and served the instant Motion to Strike Costs, or in the alternative, Tax Costs (the “Motion”). Plaintiffs seek to strike or, alternatively, tax the Costs Memorandum. Plaintiffs take issue with Defendants’ attempted recovery of attorneys’ fees in the Costs Memorandum.On May 30, 2024, Defendants filed an opposition to the Motion.On June 18, 2024, Plaintiff’s filed a reply.II. FACTUAL BACKGROUNDPlaintiffs initiated this unlawful detainer action based on a three-day notice to pay rent or quit for a property located at 1605 Magnolia Avenue, Manhattan Beach, CA 90266 (the “Property”). Plaintiffs allege that Defendants failed to pay rent for the Property pursuant to a written agreement between the parties.III. LEGAL STANDARD“The judgment creditor is entitled to the reasonable and necessary costs of enforcing a judgment.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 685.040.) “Attorney’s fees incurred in enforcing a judgment are not included in costs collectible under this title unless otherwise provided by law.” (Ibid.) “Attorney’s fees incurred in enforcing a judgment are included as costs . . . if the underlying judgment includes an award of attorney’s fees to the judgment creditor pursuant to subparagraph (A) of paragraph (10) of Section 1033.5.” (Ibid.) Attorney’s fees are allowable as costs when authorized by contract, statute, or law. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (a)(10).)A “judgment creditor may claim costs as authorized by Section 685.040 by noticed motion” and such motion must be made before the judgment is fully satisfied “but not later than two years after the costs have been incurred.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 685.080, subd. (a).) “The notice of motion shall describe the costs claimed, shall state their amount, and shall be supported by an affidavit of a person who has knowledge of the facts stating that to the person’s best knowledge and belief the costs are correct, are reasonable and necessary, and have not been satisfied.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 685.080, subd. (b).) “The notice of motion shall be served on the judgment debtor. Service shall be made personally or by mail.” (Ibid.)A judgment creditor may also claim attorneys’ fees through a memorandum of costs. (Code Civ. Proc., § 685.070, subd. (a)(6).) “Before the judgment is fully satisfied but not later than two years after the costs have been incurred, the judgment creditor claiming costs under this section shall file a memorandum of costs with the court clerk and serve a copy on the judgment debtor.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 685.070, subd. (b).)“The judgment creditor may seek to recover attorney’s fees incurred in enforcing a judgment by filing either a memorandum of costs under section 685.070, subdivision (b), or a noticed motion under section 685.080, subdivision (a).” (David S. Karton, A Law Corp. v. Dougherty (2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 133, 145.)“[T]he items on a verified cost bill are prima facie evidence the costs, expenses and services listed were necessarily incurred.” (Hadley v. Krepel (1985) 167 Cal.App.3d 677, 682.) “There is no requirement that copies of bills, invoices, statements, or any other such documents be attached to the memorandum.” (Jones v. Dumrichob (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 1258, 1267.) “Only if the costs have been put at issue must supporting documentation be submitted.” (Ibid.) “If the items appearing on a cost bill appear to be proper charges, the burden is on the party seeking totax costs to show that they were not reasonable or necessary.” (Ladas v. California State Auto Assn. (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761, 774.)IV. DISCUSSIONMoving Party’s ArgumentsPlaintiffs argue that the Costs Memorandum seeks attorneys’ fees even though the Court’s February 27, 2024 order states that the maximum amount of attorneys’ fees and costs would not exceed $5,000.00. Plaintiffs contend that Defendants are attempting to double dip in recovering their attorneys’ fees. Plaintiffs further argue that a motion for attorneys’ fees is required and the costs of enforcing the judgment were not reasonable or necessary.Responding Party’s OppositionOn opposition, Defendants assert that the post-judgment attorneys’ fees are not limited by the underlying contract’s cap on fees. Defendants contend that post-judgment attorneys’ fees may be claimed by a cost memorandum after judgment and a noticed motion is not required. Lastly, Defendants argue that the time spent collecting the judgment was reasonable.Moving Party’s ReplyPlaintiff restates its arguments from the motion.Merits of the MotionIn support of the Motion, Plaintiffs’ counsel, Jason M. Stone (“Stone”), provides a declaration stating the following: on February 27, 2024, the Court filed and signed an order concluding the maximum award for attorneys’ fees and costs to the prevailing party would not exceed $5,000.00. (Stone Decl., ¶ 3.) On or about April 23, 2024, Defendants served Plaintiffs with a Notice of Association of Counsel. (Stone Decl., ¶ 4.) On or about May 9, 2024, Defendants filed the Costs Memorandum. (Stone Decl., ¶ 5.) As of May 9, 2024, Defendants did not contact Plaintiffs or Plaintiffs’ counsel for payment of the order and Plaintiffs never received a signed copy of the order or a notice of entry of judgment from Defendants. (Stone Decl., ¶ 6.) On May 10, 2024, Plaintiffs mailed overnight a $5,000.00 check to Defendants’ counsel to fully satisfy the order. (Stone Decl., ¶ 7.)In opposition to the Motion, Defendants’ counsel, Casey Movsessian (“Movsessian”) provides a declaration. Counsel declares that on February 1, 2024, he e-mailed Plaintiffs’ counsel a notice of the Court’s ruling on the motion for attorneys’ fees, a copy of the proposed order, and a request that his client pay the fees. (Movsessian Decl., ¶ 4; Exh. A.) Mr. Movsessian declares that at no time did Mr. Stone ever respond to his e-mail, call him, or otherwise send payment for the fee award. (Movsessian Decl., ¶ 4) Counsel waited until April 23, 2024 before retaining the Law Office of Kevin P. Hermansen, P.C. to collect the fee award. (Movsessian Decl., ¶ 5.)Kevin Hermansen (“Hermansen”) provides a declaration in opposition to the Motion, which sets forth his efforts collecting on the judgment in this action. (Hermansen Decl., ¶ 2-3.) It was not until after Mr. Hermansen filed the Costs Memorandum did he receive a check for the original$5,000.00 fee award in the mail, which he returned to Mr. Stone with an explanation as to why it was being returned. (Hermansen Decl., ¶ 4; Exh. B.)Plaintiff argues that, because the underlying lease agreement caps attorneys’ fees at $5,000.00, Defendants cannot obtain post-judgment attorneys’ fees. “[U]nder the merger doctrine the specific limitations of the contract . . . no longer apply once the judgment is entered, and instead, the operative question in considering whether fees are available as enforcement costs under section 685.040 is simply whether the judgment included attorneys’ fees awarded pursuant to contract because the ‘judgment extinguishes all further contractual rights, including the contractual attorney fees clause.’” (Nash v. Aprea (2023) 96 Cal.App.5th 21, 32.) Here, neither the judgment nor the Court’s February 27, 2024 order set forth a limitation on Defendants’ ability to obtain post-judgment attorneys’ fees. Therefore, the contractual cap of $5,000 is inapplicable to attorneys’ fees expended in collecting a judgment.The Court also rejects Plaintiffs’ argument Defendants must file a motion for attorneys’ fees to recover attorneys’ fees incurred to enforce the judgment. Pursuant to David S. Karton, A Law Corp. v. Dougherty, supra, 171 Cal.App.4th at p. 145, Defendants may recover post-judgment attorneys’ fees through a memorandum of costs.Lastly, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have not met their burden in showing that the costs incurred in enforcing the judgment were unreasonable or unnecessary. The declaration of Plaintiffs’ counsel in support of the motion does not state that the costs claimed were unreasonable or unnecessary, and Defendant’s counsel supported the costs being sought.Accordingly, the Motion is therefore DENIED.V. CONCLUSIONBased on the foregoing, the Motion to Strike Costs, or in the alternative, Tax Costs is DENIED.
