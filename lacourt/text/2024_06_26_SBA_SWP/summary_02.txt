Summary:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the Plaintiffs' Motion to Strike Costs or Tax Costs. The Motion was filed in response to the Defendants' Memorandum of Costs, which seeks to recover attorneys' fees incurred in enforcing the judgment. The Court has denied the Motion, finding that the costs incurred in enforcing the judgment were reasonable and necessary. The Court also held that the contractual cap on attorneys' fees does not apply to post-judgment attorneys' fees. The Court rejected the Plaintiffs' argument that the Defendants must file a motion for attorneys' fees to recover attorneys' fees incurred in enforcing the judgment, finding that the Defendants may recover such fees through a memorandum of costs.
