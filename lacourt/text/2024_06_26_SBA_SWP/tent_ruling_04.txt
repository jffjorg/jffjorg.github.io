 Case Number:  24TRCV00644    Hearing Date:   June 26, 2024    Dept:  SWP DONALD PAYNE, Plaintiff, vs. REGINA BEACH, et al., Defendants.  CASE NO: 24TRCV00644 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE: DEMURRER TO PLAINTIFF’S COMPLAINT Dept. P8:30 a.m. June 26, 2024Having considered defendant’s demurrer, the court rules as follows: the demurrer to the complaint is SUSTAINED without leave to amend.I. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUNDOn February 21, 2024, Plaintiff Donald Payne (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint for Negligence (the “Complaint”) against Defendants Regina Beach (“Beach”), EAN Holdings, LLC (“EAN”), and Does 1 through 10.On May 13, 2024, Defendant Beach filed an Answer and an Amended Answer to the Complaint.On May 14, 2024, Defendant EAN filed and served the instant unopposed demurrer to the Complaint.On May 29, 2024, Plaintiff filed an Amended Complaint; however, the Amended Complaint was rejected by the Court on the grounds that a court order was required in order to file the Amended Complaint. (See 05/30/24 Notice of Rejection—Pleadings.)The demurrer is unopposed. Any opposition to the demurrer was required to have been filed and served at least nine court days prior to the hearing. (CCP § 1005(b).)II. FACTUAL BACKGROUNDPlaintiff alleges that on January 24, 2023, he suffered severe physical and psychological injuries due to an automobile collision caused by Defendant Beach. (Complaint, ¶ 6.) The collision occurred on a public roadway in Los Angeles County. (Complaint, ¶ 8.) Plaintiff alleges that Defendant Beach drove her vehicle in a negligent, careless, reckless, and wanton manner which caused her vehicle to strike Plaintiff at a high speed. (Complaint, ¶ 7.)III. LEGAL STANDARDA party may demur to a complaint on the grounds that it “does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e).) A party may also demur to a complaint on the grounds that the complaint is uncertain. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (f).) A demurrer tests whether the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) A special demurrer for uncertainty under Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10, subdivision (f) is disfavored and will only be sustained where the pleading is so bad that defendant or plaintiff cannot reasonably respond—i.e., cannot reasonably determine what issues must be admitted or denied, or what counts or claims are directed against him or her. (Khoury v. Maly’s of Calif., Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.)When considering demurrers, courts accept all well pleaded facts as true. (Fox v. JAMDAT Mobile, Inc. (2010) 185 Cal.App.4th 1068, 1078.) “A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters. Therefore, it lies only where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed.” (SKF Farms v. Superior Court (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 902, 905.) “The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters, states a cause of action.” (Hahn, supra, 147 Cal.App.4th at p. 747.) On demurrer, a court does “not accept contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law.” (Simonyan v. Nationwide Insurance Company of America (2022) 78 Cal.App.5th 889, 895.)Although courts construe pleadings liberally, sufficient facts must be alleged to support the allegations pled to survive a demurrer. (Rakestraw v. California Physicians' Serv. (2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 39, 43.) Where a demurrer is sustained, leave to amend must be allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349.) The burden is on the party who filed the pleading subject to demurrer to show the court that a pleading can be amended successfully. (Ibid.)IV. DISCUSSIONMoving Party’s ArgumentsDefendant EAN contends that the Complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action as it is nothing more than conclusory allegations. Additionally, Defendant EAN argues that, under federal law, a rental car company and its affiliates cannot be held vicariously liable for the negligent acts of its customers.Responding Party’s OppositionNo opposition filed as of June 21, 2024.Moving Party’s ReplyNo reply filed as of June 21, 2024.Merits of the DemurrerA. Meet and ConferBefore filing a demurrer, the demurring party is required to meet and confer “in person, by telephone, or by video conference with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to the demurrer for the purposes of determining whether an agreement can be reached through a filing of an amended pleading that would resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a).)The Court finds that the meet and confer requirement has not been met. Defendant EAN’s counsel, Adam I. Miller (“Miller”), attests to attempting to meet and confer with Plaintiff’s counsel by sending a meet and confer letter. (Miller Decl., ¶ 8; Exh. D.) Plaintiff’s counsel has not responded to the meet and confer correspondence and has not dismissed Defendant EAN. (Miller Decl., ¶¶ 8-9.)Defendant did not meet and confer in person, by telephone, or by videoconference regarding the issues raised in the demurrer. As such, the Court finds that the meet and confer requirement has not been satisfied. The Court, however, will still consider the merits of the demurrer. The Court reminds the parties of the need to comply with the requirements of the Code of Civil Procedure.B. Judicial NoticeThe Court GRANTS Defendant EAN’s request for judicial notice. (Evid. Code §§ 452, 453.)C. NegligenceIn order to state a claim for negligence, Plaintiff must allege the elements of (1) “the existence of a legal duty of care,” (2) “breach of that duty,” and (3) “proximate cause resulting in an injury.” (McIntyre v. Colonies-Pacific, LLC (2014) 228 Cal.App.4th 664, 671.) A complaint must contain “[a] statement of the facts constituting the cause of action, in ordinary and concise language.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 425.10, subd. (a)(1).)The Court finds that the Complaint does not state a sufficient cause of action for negligence. (Complaint, ¶¶ 5-12.) Plaintiff does not allege the elements of duty, breach, or proximate cause as to Defendant EAN. The Complaint is merely a recitation of conclusions of fact. The Court does not accept conclusions of fact or law on demurrer pursuant to Simonyan, supra, 78 Cal.App.5th 889, 895. The Complaint is simply conclusory. There are no specific facts alleged as to Defendant EAN.The demurrer of Defendant EAN to the Complaint is SUSTAINED.Due to the lack of sufficient factual allegations in the Complaint, the Court need not address the argument of Defendant EAN that it is not liable under federal law for the actions of the renters of its vehicles. However, the court also takes judicial notice that EAN is a rental car company and is not liable for the negligence of those who rent its vehicles. This provides the second basis for which to sustain the demurrer.Moreover, given that the demurrer is unopposed, Plaintiff has conceded to the arguments raised therein as “[c]ontentions are waived when a party fails to support them with reasoned argument and citations to authority.” (Moulton Niguel Water Dist. v. Colombo (2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 1210, 1215.)D. Leave to AmendThe burden is on the complainant to show the Court that a pleading can be amended successfully. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) Plaintiff has not filed an opposition and has failed to show how the pleading can be successfully amended. Therefore, the court will not allow leave to amend.V. CONCLUSIONBased on the foregoing, the Court SUSTAINS the demurrer of Defendant EAN to the Complaint without leave to amend.Defendant EAN Holdings, LLC to give notice.
