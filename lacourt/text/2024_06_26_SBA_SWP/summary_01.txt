Summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the Plaintiff's motion to compel discovery (document production) responses and request for monetary sanctions in part. The Defendant, Purnell Williams, has failed to respond to the Plaintiff's discovery requests, and the Court orders him to provide verified, complete, and code-compliant responses to Set Four of the Plaintiff's Request for Production of Documents within 30 days. The Court also awards the Plaintiff monetary sanctions in the amount of $760.00 for the Defendant's failure to respond. However, the Court denies the Plaintiff's request to compel responses to Set Three due to a lack of proof of service showing service of the discovery request on the Defendant.
