     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
defendants’ motion for summary judgment 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On January 17, 2023, Plaintiff Mario
Rosales filed this action for medical negligence against Defendants Richard
Roe, M.D. (Dr. Roe) and Retina-Vitreous Associates Medical Group (RVAMG).
Plaintiff alleges that Dr. Roe, who works at RVAMG, negligently diagnosed him
and failed to render proper treatment. 
            On February 16, 2024, Defendants
filed the instant motion for summary judgment. Plaintiff has not filed an
opposition. 
LEGAL STANDARD
The function of a motion for summary
judgment or adjudication is to allow a determination as to whether an opposing
party cannot show evidentiary support for a pleading or claim and to enable an
order of summary dismissal without the need for trial. (Aguilar v. Atlantic
Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) Code of Civil Procedure section
437c, subdivision (c) “requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment if
all the evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from the
evidence’ and uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that there
is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is
entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” (Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp.
(1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.) “The function of the pleadings in a motion
for summary judgment is to delimit the scope of the issues; the function of the
affidavits or declarations is to disclose whether there is any triable issue of
fact within the issues delimited by the pleadings.” (Juge v. County of
Sacramento (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 59, 67, citing FPI Development, Inc. v.
Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal. App. 3d 367, 381-382.)
As to each claim as framed by the
complaint, the defendant moving for summary judgment must satisfy the initial
burden of proof by presenting facts to negate an essential element, or to
establish a defense. (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2); Scalf v. D. B.
Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1520.) Once the defendant has
met that burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that a triable
issue of one or more material facts exists as to that cause of action or a
defense thereto. To establish a triable issue of material fact, the party
opposing the motion must produce substantial responsive evidence. (Sangster
v. Paetkau (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 151, 166.) Courts “liberally construe the
evidence in support of the party opposing summary judgment and resolve doubts
concerning the evidence in favor of that party.” (Dore v. Arnold Worldwide,
Inc. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 384, 389.)
DISCUSSION
            “The elements of a cause of action
for medical malpractice are: (1) a duty to use such skill, prudence, and
diligence as other members of the profession commonly possess and exercise; (2)
a breach of the duty; (3) a proximate causal connection between the negligent
conduct and the injury; and (4) resulting loss or damage.” (Lattimore v.
Dickey (2015) 239 Cal.App.4th 959, 968.) “The first element, standard of
care, is the key issue in a malpractice action and can only be proved by expert
testimony, unless the circumstances are such that the required conduct is
within the layperson's common knowledge.” (Ibid.) 
            Here, Defendants’ uncontested expert
testimony establishes that Dr. Roe’s actions complied with the applicable
standard of care. (See Smith Decl.) This satisfies Defendants’ initial burden.
Plaintiff does not oppose the motion and presents no contrary evidence.
Therefore, Plaintiff fails to raise a triable issue. RVAMG cannot be
vicariously liable without any underlying liability. (See Lathrop v.
HealthCare Partners Medical Group (2004) 114 Cal.App.4th 1412, 1423 [“The
employer cannot be held vicariously liable unless the employee is found
responsible”].) 
CONCLUSION
            Defendants’ motion for summary
judgment is GRANTED.
