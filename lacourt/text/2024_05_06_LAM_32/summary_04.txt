And here is the English text summarizing the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Court has tentatively ruled in favor of Defendant Pichi Lin's motion to sever the claims against her from the claims against the other defendants. The Court finds that the claims against the creditors (Tsasu LLC, Hestter Investment LLC, and Leonard Hsu) should be tried before the claims against Lin. This is because the claims against the creditors are based on the premise that the subject property was not community property, whereas the claims against Lin are based on the premise that the subject property was community property. The Court concludes that trying the claims against the creditors first would be more convenient, efficient, and economical.
