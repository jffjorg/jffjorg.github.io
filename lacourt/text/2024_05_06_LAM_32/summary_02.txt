And here is the English-text summary:

This is the Judge's tentative ruling on the Plaintiff's motions to compel further responses from Defendant Aquino. The Plaintiff alleges that Defendant Aquino sexually assaulted her while he was a therapist at Casa de la Familia. The Defendant has refused to answer questions based on his privilege against self-incrimination. The Court finds that the Defendant's refusal is justified, but the Defendant's responses to Requests for Production are defective and require amendment. As a result, the Court grants the Plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to Requests for Production, but denies the Plaintiff's motions to compel further responses to Requests for Admission and Special Interrogatories.
