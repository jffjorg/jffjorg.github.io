  Order RE:
 
plaintiff’s motion to compel further
  responses to requests for production of documents, set one, and for sanctions
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Plaintiff Immigrant Rights
Defense Council, LLC    
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Counsel for defendants Laura E. Vaca and Agencia Privada de
Inmigracion, Inc. 
Motion to Compel Further Responses to Requests for Production of
Documents, Set One, and for Sanctions
Plaintiff Immigrant Rights
Defense Council, LLC (“Plaintiff”) filed the pending motion on December 28,
2023, moving the court for an order (1) compelling defendant Laura E. Vaca
(“Defendant”) to serve further responses to Plaintiff’s Requests for Production
of Documents, Set One, numbers 1-4, 6, and 7, and (2) awarding monetary
sanctions in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant in the amount of $6,060.
On August 13, 2024, counsel
for Defendant, Leticia Moreno (“Counsel”), filed a document entitled “Notice of
Need for Temporary Abatement or Continuance of Proceedings,” in which Counsel
advised the court that Counsel was placed on involuntary inactive status with
the State Bar of California on July 2, 2024. 
(Aug. 13, 2024 Notice, p. 2:8-9.)  Counsel further represented that she has since
paid her dues and provided proof of MCLE compliance.  (Id., p. 2:10-12.)  Thereafter, on August 30, 2024, Counsel submitted
a filing to the court asserting that her status with the State Bar of
California “has not changed[,]” i.e., Counsel’s status remains inactive.  (Aug. 30, 2024 Decl. of Notice, p. 1:18.)  
The court acknowledges that
Plaintiff has objected to a continuance of its pending motion to compel further
responses.  However, the court finds that
it is appropriate, and therefore exercises its discretion, to continue the
hearing on this motion for a short period of time in order to give Counsel a
reasonable amount of time to return to an active status with the State Bar of
California and to file an opposition to this motion on behalf of Defendant. 
ORDER
            The court orders that the hearing on
plaintiff Immigrant Rights Defense
Council, LLC’s motion to compel further responses to requests for production of
documents, set one, and for sanctions is continued to October 29, 2024, at
10:00 a.m., in Department 53.
            The court orders plaintiff Immigrant Rights Defense Council, LLC
to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  September 16, 2024
