 Hearing Date:  October 25, 2023



 
The Court
determines all of the items in the Special Assessment which were levied and
charged on a variable basis fall under the heading of “paint” and the eight
percent cap on charges for Unit 103 was improperly applied.
Procedural Background
          On September 1, 2023, Plaintiff and
Cross-Defendant 108 W. 2nd Street, LLC (the “LLC”) and Defendants Higgins Loft
and John Agnew (collectively, “Defendants”) stipulated that the Court should
bifurcate the trial of this matter and 
that the scope of the First phase of the bifurcated trial be as follows:
"The issue to be determined in the first phase of this bifurcated
proceeding is whether the challenged Special Assessment was issued and levied
in accordance with the terms of the CC&Rs."  The Court now rules on that issue.

Factual Background
On
August 3, 2017, the Association membership authorized the Board to obtain a
construction loan and levy a $3,790,000 special assessment to fund the repayment
of a fifteen-year loan to pay for the façade restoration.  (Decl. of Agnew ¶15; Decl. of Mitchell ¶15;
D-COE Exh. 5.)  The voting materials
reflected that this assessment was being levied to repay a “loan for repair and
reconstruction costs described in Exhibit A,” a $4,852,138 construction
estimate.  (Decl. of Agnew ¶15; Decl. of Mitchell
¶15; D-COE Exh. 4.)  This cost estimate
included the following scope of work:
1.     Paint
Removal and Lead-Based Paint Abatement - $1,230,163;
2.     Decorative
Concrete Repairs - $1,336,068;
3.     South
Fiber-Reinforced Coating - $71,416;
4.     Concrete
Cornice Repairs - $469,326;
5.     Reinforced
Fluid -Applied Coating at Horizontal Projections - $78,929;
6.     Cement
Stucco Repairs - $182,427;
7.     Metal
Window Repairs - $324,487;
8.     Courtyard
Duct Removal - $26,977;
9.     Abandoned
Pipe Removal - $11,634;
10. Miscellaneous
Repairs (e.g., penetration sealant, vent cover replacement, and cut back ends
of existing fence away from wall surface, re-secure, and touch up paint) -
$33,937;
11. Painting
and Coating - $262,981;
12. Sheet
Metal Cornice - $134,882;
13. Sheet
Metal Coping Replacement - $31,871;
14. Scaffold -
$368,155; and
15. Project
Direct Costs (e.g., dumpsters, container, parking lot rental for staging, and
scaffold staging, and site toilets) - $288,884.
(D-COE Exh.
4.)   
Based
on advice of counsel, the Board determined that some, but not all, of the
proposed façade should be allocated on a variable basis.  (Decl. of Agnew ¶¶10-13; Decl. of Mitchell
¶¶10-13; D-COE Exhs. 1-2.)  The special
assessment allocated the proportionate costs for items 1 through 6 and 11
through 15 on the variable square footage basis.  Conversely, items 7 through 10 were allocated
on an equal uniform basis.  (Decl. of
Agnew ¶12; Decl. of Mitchell ¶12; P-COE Exh. G.)
 
Discussion
CC&Rs
are interpreted as contracts.  (Fourth
La Costa Condominium Owners Assn. v. Seith (2008) 159 Cal.App.4th 563,
575.)  “[T]he whole of a contract is to
be taken together, so as to give effect to every part, if reasonably
practicable, each clause helping to interpret the other [citations omitted].”  (Bear Creek Planning Committee v. Ferwenda
(2011) 193 Cal.App.4th 1178, 1183.). “The primary object in construing
restrictive covenants, as in construing all contracts, should be to effectuate
the legitimate desire of the covenanting parties.”  (Hannula v. Hacienda Homes, Inc.
(1949) 34 Cal.2d 442, 444-445.) 
CC&Rs “shall be liberally construed to facilitate the operation of
the common interest development . . ..” 
(Civ. Code §4215.)
Upon
obtaining title to a commercial unit within the Higgins Loft common interest
development, Plaintiff agreed to and became bound by the provisions in the
recorded CC&Rs.  (See Civ.
Code §5975(a); Nahrstedt v. Lakeside Village Condominium Assn. (1994) 8
Cal.4th 361, 375, 379.)
 
1.    
Interpretation of “Paint” as used in the
CC&Rs
Pursuant
to the CC&Rs (Article I and VI), the Association is charged with
maintaining and repairing Higgins Loft’s common areas. Section 2.05(a) of the
CC&Rs states:
Except as otherwise
specifically states, the Association . . . is responsible for maintaining,
repairing, modifying and altering Common Areas (not including Exclusive Use
Common Areas), including bearing walls (except for the finished surfaces
thereof), plumbing and pipes in Common Area walls, window frames, balcony door
frames, patio door frames, finished surfaces and structural components of
balconies, balcony railings, patios, roof and exterior paint (stucco) of
the building.
 
(P-RJN, Exh. A at
pg. II-3 §2.05(a), emphasis added.)
“Assessments
may be levied by the Association for improvement and maintenance of the Common
Area(s), administration of the Property, and to promote the recreation, safety,
and welfare for the common good of all the Owners.”  (P-RJN, Exh. A at pg. VII-1 §7.01(a).)  “[T]he Association shall levy regular and
special assessments sufficient to perform its obligations under the governing
documents and this act.”  (Civ. Code
§5600(a).)
Section
7.03(a) of the CC&Rs provides that “[a]ll Assessments, both Regular and Special
shall be variable and charged and divided among the Condominiums as set
forth in attached Exhibit ‘B’ except where stated herein.” (P-RJN, Exh.
A at pg. VII-1 §7.03(a).)  Exhibit “B”
states:
All Assessments shall
be charged to each Condominium as follows, except where stated herein:
 
A.     Variable
Costs items shall be the following budget items only; insurance, domestic water
and gas (if common), hot water heater (if common), paint, and roof.
 
. . .
 
C.      Monthly Base Assessment shall equal the Total Monthly
Equal Costs divided by the one-hundred forty-two (142) number of Units in the
project.
 
(P-RJN, Exh. A at
pg. 056 ¶A, emphasis added.). Variable assessments are allocated based on a
formula set forth in Exhibit B of the CC&Rs pursuant to each unit’s
proportionate square footage of the total square footage of the building.
The
Board, after consultation with its experts, concluded that the term “paint” as
used in Exhibit B to the CC&Rs means “all exterior surface work.” (Decl. of
Agnew ¶11; Decl. of Mitchell ¶11; D-COE Exhs. 1-2.)  This interpretation is consistent with the plain
language of the CC&Rs.
          Here, the term “paint” as used in
Exhibit B to the CC&Rs must be interpreted in the context of how the term
is used throughout the document, i.e., stucco is encompassed within the term
“paint.”  (P-RJN, Exh. A at pg. II-3
§2.05(a).)  Assessments for “exterior
paint (stucco),” therefore, must be assessed on a variable (i.e., unit square
footage) basis.  (P-RJN, Exh. A at pg.
VII-1 §7.03(a); P-RJN, Exh. A pg. 056 ¶A; Decl. of Nordberg ¶¶15, 19.2, 21.1.)  The Court finds that the Board properly
assessed the costs for items 1 through 6 and 11 through 15 on the variable
square footage basis.  All the items
included in these costs concerned maintenance/reapplication of the building’s paint/stucco
exterior.  
          
2.    
Application of the 8% Cap
According
to §7.03(c) of the CC&Rs, Unit 103 “which has no gas, water, or sewer,
shall be assessed only eight (8) percent of the total budget for commercial
units.”  (P-RJN, Exh. A at pg. VII-1
§7.03(a).) 
By
its own terms, the eight percent cap in §7.03(c) of the CC&Rs applies only
to items that are part of the “budget” for commercial units.  However, the only budget the Association
prepares is an annual operating budget. 
(Civ. Code §5300(b)(l).)  As the
name suggests, the Association’s “annual operating budget” consists of expenses
the Association must cover as part of its normal operations. Additionally,
Article I of the CC&Rs defines “Regular Assessments” as those assessments
“used to meet the Association’s normal operating expenses and to establish
necessary reserves.”  Conversely, Article
I defines “Special Assessments” as “Assessments levied on an as-needed basis to
meet expenses of an extraordinary or capital nature.”
Taken
together, the “budget for commercial units” mentioned in §7.03(c) of the
CC&Rs simply refers to the portion of the Association’s operating expenses
allocable to the commercial units (which are to be paid for by regular
assessments). The budget is “used to meet the Association’s normal operating
expenses and to establish necessary reserves.”  This interpretation is entirely consistent
with the language of §7.03(c), as it explicitly ties the existence of the 8%
cap to the fact that unit 103 does not use gas, water, or sewer (all of which
are by definition normal operating expenses).
Conversely,
attempting to construe a Special Assessment as a commercial budget expense is
not consistent with industry custom and practice.  (Decl. of Nordberg ¶21.4.)  The expense of maintenance and repair of the
exterior surfaces of the building are not the same as the maintenance expenses
for the Commercial Units.  Exterior
building maintenance expenses are completely different from Commercial Unit
expenses.  Therefore, the eight percent
cap described in §7.03(c) does not apply to the Special Assessment.
“[I]n
interpreting a contract, courts may properly consider the acts and conduct of
the parties following the contract’s execution. [Citation.] As Witkin explains,
‘[t]he conduct of the parties may be, in effect, a practical construction
thereof, for they are probably least likely to be mistaken as to the
intent.’”  (Jones v. P.S. Development
Co. (2008) 166 Cal.App.4th 707, 720, disapproved of on other grounds by
Reid v. Google, Inc. (2010) 50 Cal. 4th 512; see also Cedars-Sinai
Medical Center v. Shewry (2006) 137 Cal.App.4th 964, 983.)
Here,
Plaintiff’s past conduct corroborates the interpretation that the eight percent
cap does not apply to the Special Assessment. Plaintiff challenged the
assessment allocation prior to its approval by the members on December 9, 2016,
and shortly after it was levied on February 22, 2019.  (Decl. of Agnew ¶¶14, 18; Decl. of Mitchell
¶¶14, 18; D-COE Exhs. 3, 7.)  While Plaintiff
challenged the fixed/variable assessment allocation used, in implied
recognition that §7.03(c) did not apply to the Special Assessment, Plaintiff
did not raise Unit 103’s eight percent cap in either challenge.
Accordingly,
the eight percent cap on charges for Unit 103 was improperly applied.
 
Conclusion
All
of the items in the Special Assessment which were levied and charged on a
variable basis fall under the heading of “paint” and the eight percent cap on
charges for Unit 103 was improperly applied.
