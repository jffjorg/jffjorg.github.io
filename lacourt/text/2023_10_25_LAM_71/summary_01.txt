And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has determined that all of the items in the Special Assessment which were levied and charged on a variable basis fall under the heading of "paint" and the eight percent cap on charges for Unit 103 was improperly applied. The Court has also ruled that the Board properly allocated the costs for items 1 through 6 and 11 through 15 on the variable square footage basis, as these costs concerned maintenance/reapplication of the building's paint/stucco exterior. The Court has further held that the eight percent cap in §7.03(c) of the CC&Rs applies only to items that are part of the "budget" for commercial units, and that the expense of maintenance and repair of the exterior surfaces of the building are not the same as the maintenance expenses for the Commercial Units.
