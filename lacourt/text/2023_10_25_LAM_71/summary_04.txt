And here is the summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge denies Defendant Miguel Angel Roque II's request for sanctions against Plaintiff Xchange Logistics Corporation and its counsel, stating that the motion is moot since the Plaintiff has filed an operative first amended complaint that includes HK Trans LLC as a defendant. The Judge notes that the motion for sanctions was filed in response to the initial complaint, but the operative pleading is now the first amended complaint. The Judge further notes that the Plaintiff's claims are not frivolous and that the motion was not presented primarily for an improper purpose. Therefore, the Judge denies the motion for sanctions.
