 Hearing Date:  October 25, 2023



 
Cross-Defendants W.E. O’Neil
Construction Co. of California’s, Continental Casualty Company’s, and Western
Surety Company’s motion for an order determining liability for contribution
against Cross-Defendant R & J Sheet Metal, Inc. and in favor of W.E. O’Neil
Construction Co. of California, Continental Casualty Company, and Western
Surety Company on the joint Judgment is granted in the total amount of $276,146.44.
 
Moving
Cross-Defendants W.E. O’Neil Construction Co. of California (“WEO”),
Continental Casualty Company (“Continental”), and Western Surety Company (“Western”)
(“Moving Parties”) move for an order determining liability for contribution
against Cross-Defendant R & J Sheet Metal, Inc. (“R&J”) (“Cross-Defendant”)
on the grounds that R&J’s due proportion of the Judgment and fees and costs
in the sum of $196,280.76, and that Moving Parties have paid the sum of
$422,322.15, which includes all sums jointly owed by R&J to Cross-Complainant
Joseph Karscig DBA Architectural Systems, Inc. (“ASI”) (“Cross-Complainant”) in
satisfaction of the judgment, an amount that exceeds Moving Defendants’ pro
rata share.  (Notice of Motion, pgs. 2-3;
C.C.P. §§881, 883(a).)  Moving Parties
also seek post-judgment interest of $196,280.76.  (Notice of Motion, pgs. 2-3; C.C.P. §§881,
883(a).)  In the alternative, Moving
Parties argue that if their contribution is limited at this point in time to
those amounts set forth in the Court’s August 20, 2019, Judgment and the August
26, 2019, Order updating the Judgment, that R&J’s currently due proportion
of the joint Judgment is the sum of $180,122.73.  (Notice of Motion, pg. 3.)
 
Legal
Standard
A
judgment debtor that is entitled to compel contribution or repayment under C.C.P.
§882 may apply, on noticed motion, to the court that entered the judgment for
an order determining liability for contribution or repayment.  (C.C.P. §883(a).)  The application must be made at any time
before the judgment is satisfied in full or within 30 days thereafter.  (C.C.P. §883(a); see Comerica Bank v.
Runyon (2017) 16 Cal.App.5th 473, 476, 479-483 [judgment debtor’s
application for order of contribution was timely filed because when it was
heard, judgment creditor had not yet filed satisfaction of judgment].)
An
applicant is not required to plead or prove timeliness.  (Comerica Bank, 16 Cal.App.4th at pgs. 479-481.)
 If the opposing party raises the issue,
then the judge must determine timeliness based on the evidence the parties have
submitted as well as the status and content of the court’s file.  (Id. at pg. 481.)  
The
phrase “the judgment is satisfied in full,” as used in C.C.P. §883(a) means
only at such time as the creditor has filed a full acknowledgment of
satisfaction of the judgment.  (Id. at
pg. 482.)  A judgment cannot be satisfied
within the meaning of C.C.P. §883(a) until the judgment creditor is paid in
full and has no other outstanding claim, and the judgment debtor’s obligation
has been fully extinguished.  (Id.)
 
Discussion
R&J’s
argument that Moving Parties’ motion is untimely is unavailing. WEO first filed
its original motion for contribution on October 29, 2019. ASI’s Satisfaction of
Judgment as to WEO and its related parties and sureties was filed on October
17, 2019.  Since the original motion was
filed before expiration of the 30-day statutory period, the motion was timely
filed.  
In
the intervening period of filing the motion for contribution, R&J filed a
Notice of Appeal of the ASI Summary Judgment.  R&J’s primary argument in its opposition
to the original Motion for Contribution was that its filing of the Notice of
Appeal stayed any consideration of the Motion for Contribution.  On March 4, 2020, this Court agreed that the
filing of the Notice of Appeal precluded it from considering the motion on the
merits and that the matter had been stayed on appeal, and the matter was taken
off calendar.  (Decl. of Chamberlain ¶12,
Exh. K.)  As a result, the matter was
taken off calendar.  Since the original
motion was timely filed within the statutory period and was subsequently stayed
by R&J’s appeal, the Court will consider the matter on its merits.
R&J’s
argument that WEO does not have standing to seek contribution as the judgment
debtor because the money used to pay the judgment came from WEO’s insurer is
unavailing.  A judgment debtor who has
paid more than its proportion of a judgment can enforce its right to
contribution under C.C.P. §882. It is undisputed that WEO is a judgment debtor,
and R&J cites no law in support of its proposition that WEO cannot seek
contribution under the statute.
Here,
there is no apportionment of joint liability made by the Judgment itself, or
dictated by the terms of any underlying instrument, the due proportion of the
liability of the joint judgment debtors must be calculated on a pro rata basis.
(Civ. Code §1432; Wooley v. Seijo (1964) 224 Cal.App.2d 615,
621-622.)  The Judgment is effectively
against only two parties: R&J and WEO (and its sureties). (JMR
Construction Corp. v. Environmental Assessment & Remediation Management,
Inc. (2015) 243 Cal.App.4th 571, 594-595.)  Therefore, the proper pro rata allocation
between R&J and Moving Parties is 50/50. 
Since Moving Parties paid the whole of the $392,561.53 owed jointly by
R&J, Moving Parties are entitled to contribution from R&J of half of
this sum, $196,280.76, for the principal, prejudgment interest, attorneys’
fees, and costs.
Accordingly,
Moving Parties are entitled to contribution from R&J for $196,280.76.
 
Post-Judgment
Interest
C.C.P.
§685.020(a), states: “Except as provided in subdivision (b), interest commences
to accrue on a money judgment on the date of entry of the judgment.”
WEO
is entitled to post-judgment interest from R&J at the legal rate of 10% on the
amount of $196,280.76 due from R&J from the date it paid the judgment on
October 1, 2019, to the date of this hearing in the amount of $79,865.68. 
Post
judgment interest here is calculated at 10% of $196,280.76 or $19,628.00 per
year for four (4) years ($78,512.30) and 25 days at $1,344.38 ($19,628.00
divided by 365 days = $53.78 per day x 25 days (Oct.1st to Oct. 25, 2023) or
$1,344.38: $78,512.30 + $1,344.38 = $79,856.68 in interest.
Accordingly,
Moving Parties are entitled to post-judgment interest in the amount of
$79,856.68.
 
Conclusion
Moving
Parties’ motion for  an order determining
liability for contribution against R&J and in favor of Moving Parties on
the joint Judgment is granted in the total amount of $276,146.44.
Moving
