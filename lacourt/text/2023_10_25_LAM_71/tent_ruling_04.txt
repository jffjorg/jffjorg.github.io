 Case No.: 
  23STCV02892
 
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  October 25, 2023



 
Defendant Miguel Angel Roque II’s
request for sanctions against Plaintiff Xchange Logistics Corporation and its
counsel of record is denied as moot.
 
Defendant
Miguel Angel Roque II (“Roque”) (“Defendant”) moves for sanctions against Plaintiff
Xchange Logistics Corporation (“Xchange”) (“Plaintiff”) and its counsel, Weinberg
Gonser Frost, Ashley Morris, and David T. Ching on the basis Plaintiff filed a
frivolous pleading.  (Motion Sanctions,
pgs. 1-3; C.C.P. §128.7.)
 
Procedural Background
On February
9, 2023, Plaintiff filed its initial complaint against Roque and Non-moving
Defendant HK Logistics Corp (“HK Logistics”). 
On May 16, 2023, Roque filed the instant motion, indicating the safe
harbor period required by C.C.P. §128.7 had elapsed.  On September 7, 2023, Plaintiff filed its
operative first amended complaint (“FAC”), adding HK Trans LLC (“HK Trans”) as
a Defendant.  On October 18, 2023, Plaintiff
filed its opposition.  As of the date of
this hearing Roque has not filed a reply.
 
Legal
Standard
By
filing a pleading, motion, or similar paper in court, an attorney makes an
implied “certification” that the filing has legal and factual merit.  (C.C.P. §128.7(b).)  The purpose of §128.7 is “to check abuses in
the filing of pleadings, petitions, written notices of motions or similar
papers.”  (Musaelian v. Adams
(2009) 45 Cal.4th 512, 514.)  C.C.P.
§128.7 requires that a pleading filed with the Court, among other things: 
(1)  It
is not being presented primarily for an improper purpose, such as to harass or
to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation.
 
(2)  The
claims, defenses, and other legal contentions therein are warranted by existing
law or by a nonfrivolous argument for the extension, modification, or reversal
of existing law or the establishment of new law.
 
(3)  The
allegations and other factual contentions have evidentiary support or, if
specifically so identified, are likely to have evidentiary support after a
reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery.
 
(4)  The
denials of factual contentions are warranted on the evidence or, if
specifically so identified, are reasonably based on a lack of information or
belief.
 
(C.C.P.
§128.7(b).)
If,
after notice and a reasonable opportunity to respond, the court determines that
a pleading fails to meet the conditions set forth under §128.7, it may impose
an appropriate monetary and non-monetary sanction on the attorney or party
responsible for the violation.  (C.C.P.
§128.7(c); see also Bucur v. Ahmad (2016) 244 Cal.App.4th 175, 189-190
[“Under section 128.7, a court may impose sanctions if it concludes a pleading
was filed for an improper purpose or was indisputably without merit, either
legally or factually.”].)  “If
warranted,” the court may award the prevailing party its reasonable expenses
and attorney fees “incurred in presenting or opposing the motion.”  (C.C.P. §128.7(c)(1).)
Whether
a party or attorney violated C.C.P. §128.7 is measured objectively. (Bockrath
v. Aldrich Chemical Co. (1999) 21 Cal.4th 71, 82 [“We measure the
truth-finding inquiry’s reasonableness under an objective standard, and apply
this standard both to attorneys and to their clients.”]; Optimal Markets,
Inc. v. Salant (2013) 221 Cal.App.4th 912, 921 [“A trial court is to apply
an objective standard in making its inquiry concerning the attorney’s or
party’s allegedly sanctionable behavior in connection with a motion for
sanctions brought under section 128.7.”].) 
“A claim is objectively unreasonable if ‘any reasonable attorney would
agree that [it] is totally and completely without merit.’”  (Peake v. Underwood (2014) 227
Cal.App.4th 428, 440, quoting In re Marriage of Flaherty (1982) 31
Cal.3d 637, 650.)
Courts
also may sanction counsel for presenting a motion “primarily for an improper
purpose, such as to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase
in the cost of litigation.” (C.C.P. §128.7(b)(1).  However, where a motion is not legally or
factually frivolous, courts are reluctant to find that it was presented for an
improper purpose unless the motion “is filed in the context of a persistent
pattern of clearly abusive litigation activity.”  (Aetna Life Insurance Co. v. Alla Medical
Services, Inc. (9th Cir. 1988) 855 F.2d 1470, 1476 [interpreting Fed. R.
Civ. Proc. 11); see also Ponce v. Wells Fargo Bank (2018) 21 Cal.App.5th
253, 264-265 [“[W]e have held that the [improper purpose and frivolous filings]
clauses are not totally independent.”].)
 
Discussion
Roque’s
motion for sanctions is moot in light of the fact the instant motion is
directed to the initial complaint and the operative pleading is the FAC.  The operative FAC has been amended to include
HK Trans LLC as a defendant.  Therefore,
Roque’s motion is denied.
 
Conclusion
Roque’s
motion for sanctions against Plaintiff is denied as moot.
Moving
party to give notice.
