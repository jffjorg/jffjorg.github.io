Summary of the tentative ruling:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Dev Air Solutions, Inc. to the first amended complaint filed by Krysta Jaime and Kaleb Gonzalez. The court has sustained the demurrer as to the third cause of action for negligence, with 20 days leave to amend. The court has also denied the motion to strike as moot. The court's ruling is based on the grounds that the complaint fails to allege a duty owed by Dev Air Solutions, Inc. to Plaintiffs, and that the allegations of negligence are uncertain and ambiguous. The court has also noted that the parties engaged in a meet and confer process, and that the defendant's counsel's declaration regarding the results of the meet and confer process is sufficient under California Code of Civil Procedure §430.41(a)(3).
