1.    
Background
This is a petition for
transfer of structured settlement payment rights (the “Petition”). The real
party in interest, Kaiwann King (“King”), wishes to transfer some portion of his
settlement rights to Asset Security Consulting, LLC (“Petitioner”).
King is in
possession of guaranteed monthly payments of $1,038.96, beginning on December
20, 2021 and continuing through November 20, 2051, as well as life-contingent
monthly payments of $1,038.96, beginning on December 20, 2051 and continuing
through King’s life. These payments arise from a personal injury case that was
settled in 2016. (King Decl. ¶ 6.) King wishes to transfer future payments
totaling $248,311.44, comprised of 239 monthly payments from January 20, 2032
through November 20, 2051. The discounted present value of the transfer amount
has been calculated as $114,965.44, and King will receive $38,195.42 in
exchange for the transfer.
2.    
Discussion
Insurance Code
section 10139.5 requires the direct or indirect transfer of structured
settlement payment rights to be approved in advance in a final court order.
(Ins. Code, §10139.6, subd. (a).) In its order, the Court must make the
following express, written findings:
“(1) The
transfer is in the best interest of the payee, taking into account the welfare
and support of the payee's dependents.
(2) The payee
has been advised in writing by the transferee to seek independent professional
advice regarding the transfer and has either received that advice or knowingly
waived, in writing, the opportunity to receive the advice.
(3) The
transferee has complied with the notification requirements pursuant to
paragraph (2) of subdivision (f), the transferee has provided the payee with a
disclosure form that complies with Section 10136, and the transfer agreement
complies with Sections 10136 and 10138.
(4) The
transfer does not contravene any applicable statute or the order of any court
or other government authority.
(5) The payee
understands the terms of the transfer agreement, including the terms set forth
in the disclosure statement required by Section 10136.
(6) The payee
understands and does not wish to exercise the payee's right to cancel the
transfer agreement.”
(Ibid.)
When
determining whether the proposed transfer is in the payee’s best interest,
taking into account the welfare and support of the payee’s dependents, the
Court must consider the totality of the circumstances, including, but not
limited to, all of the following factors:
“… (4) The
terms of the transaction, including whether the payee is transferring monthly
or lump sum payments or all or a portion of his or her future payments.
… (8) Whether
the payee has other means of income or support, aside from the structured
settlement payments that are the subject of the proposed transfer, sufficient
to meet the payee's future financial obligations for maintenance and support of
the payee's dependents, specifically including, but not limited to, the payee's
child support obligations, if any. The payee shall disclose to the transferee
and the court his or her court-ordered child support or maintenance obligations
for the court's consideration.
(9) Whether
the financial terms of the transaction, including the discount rate applied to
determine the amount to be paid to the payee, the expenses and costs of the
transaction for both the payee and the transferee, the size of the transaction,
the available financial alternatives to the payee to achieve the payee's stated
objectives, are fair and reasonable.
(10) Whether
the payee completed previous transactions involving the payee's structured
settlement payments and the timing and size of the previous transactions and
whether the payee was satisfied with any previous transaction.
…”
(Ins. Code, §
10139.5, subd. (b).)
First, the
court finds that the transfer is in the best interest of King.  (Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (a)(1).) (See
King “Best Interest Affidavit”.)  
He  is an adult resident of Los Angeles County. (King
Decl. ¶ 3.) King wishes to transfer a settlement amount with a discounted
present value of $114,965.44 in exchange for $38,195.42. Were the court to
approve the transfer, King’s remaining settlement would constitute 84
guaranteed monthly payments of $1038.96, totaling $56,103.84, plus
life-contingent monthly payments of $1038.96 beginning from December 20, 2051
through the end of King’s life.
King is
single, has no dependents, and has no child support obligations. (King Decl. ¶ 4-5.)
He is twenty years old, is an unemployed student, and has income of $1038.96
per month arising from the settlement. (King Decl. ¶ 3.) He attests that, if
the transfer is approved, he intends to use the funds to pay for tuition to
become a clinical nutritionist and invest a portion of the transfer price with
his specialized fiduciary financial advisory team in order to, after the
investments have grown, purchase a home. (King Decl. ¶ 10.) King has disclosed a
previous attempt to transfer that was voluntarily dismissed without prejudice
on October 9, 2023. (King Decl. ¶ 9.)
King attests
that the proposed transferred payments were not intended to be used for future
medical expenses. (King Decl., p. 7.) 
Second, the
court finds that Kim has been advised in writing by Petitioner to seek independent
professional advice regarding the transfer and has knowingly waived, in
writing, the opportunity to receive that advice.  (Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subdiv. (a)(2).)  (See, “Statement of Independent Professional
Advice” executed by King.) 
Third, the
court finds that Petitioner has complied with the notification requirements
pursuant to section 10139.5, subdivision (f)(2), Petitioner has provided King
with a disclosure form that complies with section 10136, and the transfer agreement
complies with sections 10136 and 10138.
Insurance Code
section 10139.5, subdivision (f)(2) requires Petitioner to file and serve, not
less than 20 days before the hearing on a petition for approval of a transfer
of payment rights, a notice of the proposed transfer and the petition for its
authorization, a copy of the proposed transfer agreement, a listing of each of
the payee’s dependents, disclosures as required by section 10136, and, if
available, copies of the annuity contract, any qualified assignment agreement,
and the underlying structured settlement agreement.¿¿
Petitioner
served King, the payment obligor, and the payment issuer with the Motion for
Order Approving Petition for Approval for Transfer of Structured Settlement Payment
Rights on December 23, 2024, i.e., 20 days before the January 14, 2025 hearing
on the petition. (Pet., p. 83 [Proof of Service].) The First Amended Petition
includes a copy of the proposed transfer agreement (Pet., Ex. B), a verified
chart showing that King has no dependents (Pet., Ex. D), the disclosure
statements for both California and New York (Pet., Ex. A), and the underlying
qualified assignment agreement and annuity contract (Pet., Ex. H). The court
therefore finds that Petitioner has complied with the notice requirements.
Section 10136
requires that the transfer agreement include certain information and meet
certain requirements, including that it be written in 12-point type, state it
will not be effective until a court enters a final order approving it and that
payment can be delayed, and set forth certain information, including the net
amount to be paid to the payee.¿ (Ins. Code, § 10136, subd. (c).)¿ Section
10138 includes additional requirements, including that a transfer agreement
cannot waive the seller/payee’s right to sue, require the seller/payee to
indemnify the buyer in claims brought by the seller or on the seller’s behalf
contesting the sale, or require the seller/payee to pay the buyer’s attorneys’
fees and costs.¿¿ (Ins. Code, § 10138, subd. (a).)¿ Petitioner has submitted a
copy of the “California Disclosure Statement,” which was signed by King. (Pet.,
Ex. A.) The court finds that this disclosure statement complies with section
10136. The court further finds that the proposed transfer agreement (the
“California Structured Settlement Payment Rights Purchase and Sale Agreement”)
substantially complies with Sections 10136 and 10138.  (Pet., Ex. B.)
Fourth, the
court finds that the transfer does not contravene any applicable statute or the
order of any court or other government authority. (Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd.
(a)(4).)
Fifth, the
court finds that King understands the terms of the transfer agreement,
including the terms set forth in the disclosure statement required by Section
10136. (Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (a)(5); Confirmation of Structured
Settlement Payment Transfer Agreement, Pet. Ex. B, C.)
Sixth, the
court finds that King understands that he has the right to cancel the transfer
agreement and does not wish to exercise that right. (Ins. Code, § 10139.5,
subd. (a)(6); King Best Interest Affidavit, Ex. C.)
Based on the
findings set forth above, and after considering the circumstances set forth in
Insurance Code section 10139.5, subdivision (b)(1)-(b)(15) and King’s
declaration, the court determines that the proposed transfer of the structured
settlement payment rights should be approved and that the transfer is fair,
reasonable, and in the payee’s best interest. The court therefore grants
Petitioner’s Motion for Order Approving Petition for Approval for Transfer of
Structured Settlement Payment Rights.
ORDER
The court
grants petitioner Asset Security Consulting, LLC’s Motion for Order Approving Petition
for Approval for Transfer of Structured Settlement Payment Rights.
The court
orders that the transfer of the structured settlement payment rights set forth
in the “California Transfer Agreement,” as attached as Exhibit B to petitioner
Asset Security Consulting, LLC’s Motion for Order Approving Petition for
Approval for Transfer of Structured Settlement Payment Rights, is approved.
This order
shall constitute a final “Qualified Order” pursuant to 26 U.S.C. section 5891.
The court
orders petitioner Asset Security Consulting, LLC to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO
ORDERED.
