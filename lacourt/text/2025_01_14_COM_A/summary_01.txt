The judge denies Mark Ridley-Thomas's motion to quash the deposition subpoena served by Plenitude Holdings, LLC. The judge finds that Ridley-Thomas has information relevant to the lawsuit and that his deposition may lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. The judge notes that Ridley-Thomas's criminal history is not relevant to the lawsuit, but that he may object and challenge any line of questioning that becomes irrelevant or harassing. The judge concludes that the deposition subpoena is proper and that Ridley-Thomas must give notice of the court's decision.
