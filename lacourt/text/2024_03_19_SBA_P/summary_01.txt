And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English:

Judge David K. Reinert issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer brought by Mechoshade System LLC, one of the defendants, to Plaintiff Lindsey Menco's five causes of action for strict products liability, products liability negligence, and general negligence. The Court found that Plaintiff adequately pled her causes of action and therefore overruled the demurrer. The Court held that Plaintiff's allegations of a manufacturing defect, design defect, and failure to warn were sufficient to state causes of action, and that Plaintiff's allegations of negligence were also sufficient. The Court also held that the demurrer was overruled because Plaintiff's complaint provided sufficient facts to apprise the defendant of the basis of the plaintiff's claims and to enable preparation of a defense.
