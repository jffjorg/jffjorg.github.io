JUDICIAL
NOTICE
The Court
also GRANTS the request for judicial notice of the City’s notices. (Julian
Volunteer Fire Co. Assn. v. Julian-Cuyamaca Fire Protection Dist. (2021) 62
Cal.App.5th 583, 599 (“Julian”) [“A court may take judicial notice of
documents in its own records and those reflecting the official acts of local
and state agencies, including resolutions, minutes, and agendas. (Evid. Code, §
452, subds. (c), (d), (h); [citations])”].) 
 
In so
ruling, the Court does not take judicial notice of the truth of facts asserted
within those documents. (Julian, supra, 62 Cal.App.5th at p. 600.)  However, the Court “may take notice not only
of the fact of the document but also facts that can be deduced, and/or clearly
derived from, its legal effect, such as the names and dates contained in the
document, and the legal consequences of the document.”  (Julian, supra, 62 Cal.App.5th at
p. 600.)
 
BACKGROUND
On
October 10, 202, Plaintiff was injured when she tripped over a tree well in
front of 6220 W. 87th Street, Westchester, CA. (Complaint p.4.)  Plaintiff alleges that she complied with “a
claims statute.” (Id. at ¶ 9.)  In
her complaint, Plaintiff alleges two causes of action; for Premises Liability
and General Negligence respectively. 
Under the premises liability claim, plaintiff asserts that the City is
liable for 1) negligence, 2) willful failure to warn, and 3) dangerous
condition of public property. (Id. at p. 4.)
Plaintiff’s counsel sent a Claim
for Damages to Defendant which was received on April 12, 2023. (Decl. Hayes,
Exh. B.)  That claim stated a date of
loss as October 3, 2022. (Id.) 
The claim was returned with no action having been taken because it was
not filed within six months of the purported date of loss. (Id. at Exh.
C.)  Plaintiff’s counsel then sent a
request for relief to file a late claim to the Defendant, dated June 14, 2023.
(Id. at Exh. D.)  Thereafter, on
July 12, 2023, Defendant sent a letter to Plaintiff alerting Plaintiff that the
claim had been denied. (Id. at Exhibit F.)  On the same date, Plaintiff sent a second
letter alerting Plaintiff that her “Application for Leave to Present a Late
Claim” had been denied. (Id. at Exhibit E.)
Defendant asserts that the demur
must be sustained without leave to amend because Plaintiff failed to comply
with the requisite claims statutes.  In
the alternative, Defendant argues that Plaintiff’s “general negligence” and
“willful failure to warn” causes of action are not available under the
Government Code.  Plaintiff argues in
opposition that
 
LEGAL AUTHORITY
When considering demurrers, courts
read the allegations liberally and in context. 
Taylor v. City of Los Angeles
Dept. of Water and Power (2006) 144 Cal. App. 4th 1216, 1228.  “A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not
the evidence or other extrinsic matters. 
Therefore, it lies only where the defects appear on the face of the
pleading or are judicially noticed.”  SKF Farms v. Superior Court (1984) 153
Cal. App. 3d 902, 905.  “The only issue
involved in a demurrer hearing is whether the complaint, as it stands,
unconnected with extraneous matters, states a cause of action.”  Hahn v.
Mirda (2007) 147 Cal. App. 4th 740, 747.
Before a suit for damages may be
filed against a public entity, a claimant must present a timely written claim
to the public entity and the claim must have been acted upon by the board or
deemed rejected.  Gov. Code §945.4; Munoz
v. State of Cal. (1995) 33 Cal. App. 4th 1767, 1777.  A claim relating to a cause of action for
injury to person or personal property must be presented to the public entity
not later than six months after the accrual of the cause of action.  Gov. Code §911.2.  Munoz, supra, 33 Cal. App. 4th at
1777.  If the claim is denied, any suit
predicated on that claim must be brought against the public entity within six
months of the notice of notice of the denial. (Gov. Code §945.6(a)(1).)
If a claimant fails to present a
claim within the statutory period, he may apply “within a reasonable time not
to exceed one year after the accrual of the cause of action” to the public
entity for leave to present a late claim. 
(Gov. Code §911.4.)  If the public
entity denies leave to present a late claim, a claimant may petition the Court
under Government Code §946.6 for relief from the requirements of Government
Code §945.4.  (Munoz, supra, 33
Cal. App. 4th at 1777.)  That petition,
made pursuant to Government Code §946.6, must be “filed within six months after
the application to the board is denied or deemed to be denied pursuant to
Section 911.6.”  (Gov. Code §946.6(b);
see also City of Los Angeles v. Superior Court (1993) 14 Cal. App. 4th
621, 627.)  This requirement is
mandatory.  (Lineaweaver v. S. Cal.
Rapid Transit Dist. (1983) 139 Cal. App. 3d 738, 741.)
“[A] public entity may be estopped
from asserting the limitations of claims statute where its agents or employees
have prevented or deterred the filing of a timely claim by some affirmative
act.” (John R. v. Oakland Unified School Dist. (1989) 48 Cal.3d 438,
445.)  “[A]ctual fraud or the intent to
mislead is not essential.” (Id.)
             A public entity may be sued. (Gov. Code
§945.)  However, under the Government
Claims Act, “there is no such thing as common law tort liability for public
entities; a public entity is not liable for an injury except as otherwise
provided by statute.” Quigley v. Garden Valley Fire Protection Dist.
(2019) 7 Cal.5th 798, 803.
 
DISCUSSION
            The question presented in this
motion is whether, by sending two letters, one denying Plaintiff’s claim
outright, one denying Plaintiff’s request to file a late claim, Plaintiff can
rely on Section 945.6(a)(1) and file her suit in court or whether she must
first have filed for relief from an untimely claim under Section 946.6.  In this case, the court finds that, by both
denying the underlying claim (which it asserts it had no duty to consider) and
denying the request to grant relief to file a late claim, the City created a
situation in which Plaintiff could not know how to respond.  Only the City knew whether it would assert
reliance upon the denial of the underlying claim or denial of the request to
submit a late claim to defend the action. (See Sofranek v. County of Merced
(2007) 146 Cal.App.4th 1238, 1251.) 
Therefore, by filing her suit within six months of being given notice of
the City’s denial of her claim, the Plaintiff has complied with the Government
Claims Act.
            The next question presented is
whether the Plaintiff can bring suit against the City for claims based in the
common law.  The court finds that she
cannot. (See Quigley, supra, 7 Cal.5th at 803.)
 
CONCLUSION
Therefore, defendant’s demur to Plaintiff’s
cause of action for Premises Liability due to a dangerous condition of public
property is OVERRRULED.  Defendant’s
demur to all other counts and causes of action is SUSTAINED WITHOUT LEAVE TO
AMEND.
