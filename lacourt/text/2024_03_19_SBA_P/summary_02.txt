Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendant's demurrer motion, which challenges the plaintiff's complaint. The plaintiff, Yvonne Higgins, was injured when she tripped over a tree well in front of a building in Los Angeles. She alleges that the City of Los Angeles is liable for her injuries due to a dangerous condition of public property.

The judge has ruled that the demurrer to the plaintiff's cause of action for premises liability due to a dangerous condition of public property is overruled, meaning that the City cannot challenge the plaintiff's claims on this ground. However, the judge has sustained the demurrer to all other counts and causes of action, meaning that the plaintiff cannot bring these claims against the City.

The judge has also ruled that the City's denials of the plaintiff's claim and request to file a late claim created a situation in which the plaintiff could not know how to respond, and therefore, the City's actions estopped it from asserting the limitations of the claims statute. This means that the plaintiff's lawsuit is not time-barred, and she can proceed with her claims.

The judge has also noted that the City is not liable for the plaintiff's injuries under the common law, and that the plaintiff's claims must be brought under the Government Claims Act.
