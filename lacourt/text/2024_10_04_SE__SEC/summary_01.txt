And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a Song-Beverly action case. The plaintiff, Barlow, has moved ex parte to enforce compliance with a previous court order dated April 25, 2024, and to shorten the time to file a motion to enforce a settlement agreement. However, the plaintiff has not provided a sufficient factual basis for granting ex parte relief, as required by California Rules of Court, rule 3.1202(c). As a result, the judge denies the ex parte motion in part and grants it in part. The judge sets a special hearing on October 10, 2024, at 9:30 a.m. to consider the motion to enforce the settlement agreement. The plaintiff is required to give notice of this hearing.
