  CASE NO.: 21STCV20153
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTIONS TO BE
  RELIEVED AS COUNSEL
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
July 1, 2024



 
Brandon
M. Tesser and Robert Paredes, counsel of record for Plaintiffs The Lair Ventures
LLC and Rosana Catalina Lambertini, seek to be relieved as counsel.  Counsel’s declaration states that the relationship
of trust and confidence has ceased to exist, and irreconcilable differences have
risen that make it unreasonably difficult to carry out effective representation.  No party opposed the motion.
Absent
a showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney’s request for withdrawal should be
granted.  (People v. Prince (1968)
268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406.)  Counsel’s motions
comply with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362.  A default judgment has already been entered, and
there is no prejudice to Plaintiffs.
The
proposed orders include a now-past hearing date.  The Court will correct this information before
signing the orders.
The
unopposed motions to be relieved are GRANTED and effective upon filing a proof of
service showing service of the signed Form MC-053 orders and this order on The Lair
Ventures LLC, Rosana Catalina Lambertini, and all parties who have appeared.
“[A]
corporation cannot represent itself in a court of record either in propria persona
or through an officer or agent who is not an attorney.”  (Caressa Camille, Inc. v. Alcoholic Beverage
Control Appeals Bd. (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 1094, 1101.)  Accordingly, if The Lair Ventures LLC intends
to take any future steps in this action, it must retain counsel.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
