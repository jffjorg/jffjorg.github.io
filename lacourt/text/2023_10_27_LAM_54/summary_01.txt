Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge sets an evidentiary hearing on November 17, 2023, to determine whether Defendants Walzer Melcher LLP, Peter Walzer, and Christopher Melcher failed to make timely arbitration payments in violation of CCP ยง 1281.98(a). The judge will also continue Defendants' motion to appoint a neutral arbitrator pending the outcome of the evidentiary hearing. The judge has considered the moving papers, oppositions, and replies and will strictly construe the statute. If Defendants failed to make timely payments, they are in material breach of the arbitration agreement. However, the judge notes that Plaintiff failed to attach the invoices to the declaration filed with the Court, and the Court will need to hear evidence to determine whether the invoices were paid timely.
