BACKGROUND
 
On March 2,
2020, Plaintiff Edward Lyman III filed the operative first amended
complaint against Defendants Walzer Melcher LLP,
Peter Walzer, and Christopher Melcher, asserting thirteen causes of action
including wrongful termination, retaliation, breach of contract, and PAGA
claims. Plaintiff was employed as an attorney by Defendant law firm Walzer Melcher
LLP. On March 12, 2020, the Court granted Defendants’ motion to compel
arbitration. The Court exempted the PAGA claims from arbitration under
applicable law and stayed the action pending arbitration.
 
 
ANALYSIS
 
A. Plaintiff’s Motion to Vacate Arbitration
CCP § 1281.98(a) provides, “In an employment
or consumer arbitration that requires, either expressly or through application
of state or federal law or the rules of the arbitration provider, that the
drafting party pay certain fees and costs during the pendency of an arbitration
proceeding, if the fees or costs required to continue the arbitration
proceeding are not paid within 30 days after the due date, the drafting party
is in material breach of the arbitration agreement, is in default of the
arbitration, and waives its right to compel the employee or consumer to proceed
with that arbitration as a result of the material breach.” Subsection (b)(1)
allows the non-drafting party the option of withdrawing the dispute from
arbitration and proceeding in Court in the event the drafting party violates
subsection (a). 
Plaintiff moves to vacate the Court’s order
compelling arbitration on the ground that Defendants failed to pay certain
arbitrator’s invoices within 30 days of their due dates. Defendants assert that
Plaintiff has failed to provide competent evidence showing Defendants failed to
timely pay the invoices and argue Plaintiff has waived the right to vacate
arbitration.
The statute at issue in this motion has been
in force for only a couple of years. The Court of Appeal has addressed the
statute in: Gallo v. Wood Ranch USA, Inc. (2022) 81 Cal.App.5th 621; Williams
v. West Coast Hospital (2022) 86 Cal.App.5th 1054; Espinoza v. Superior
Court (2022) 83 Cal.App.5th 761, 775, 778; De Leon v. Juanita’s Foods
(2022) 85 Cal.App.5th 740; and Doe
v. Superior Court of City and County of San Francisco (2023) 95 Cal.App.5th 346. In each case, the Court strictly
construed the statute. The Court in Espinoza held that there are no
exceptions for substantial compliance, inadvertent nonpayment, or absence of
prejudice. (Espinoza, supra at 775-78.) Espinoza and Gallo also
held that the FAA does not preempt these statutes. (Espinoza at 778-85; Gallo
at 641-646.)
Following the strict construction of statute,
if Defendants failed to make timely payments, Defendants are in material
breach. However, Defendants challenge the competency of Plaintiff’s evidence
and Plaintiff has failed to attach the invoices to the declaration filed with
the Court. The Court will set an evidentiary hearing to determine whether
Defendants failed to make timely arbitration payments in violation of CCP § 1281.98.

The Court will continue Defendants’ motion to
appoint a neutral arbitrator pending the outcome of the evidentiary hearing.
