And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer to the First Amended Complaint and the motion to strike. Defendant Scottsdale Insurance Company has demurred to the First and Second Causes of Action for breach of contract and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and has moved to strike portions of the First Amended Complaint. The court has sustained Defendant's demurrer to the First and Second Causes of Action without leave to amend, meaning that Plaintiffs 5110 Washington, LLC and Harma Hartouni will not be able to maintain these claims.

The court has also sustained Defendant's demurrer to the Fifth Cause of Action for violation of Business and Professions Code section 17200, but this cause of action is now moot because Plaintiffs have filed a notice of dismissal.

Finally, the court has struck Defendant's motion to strike as moot, since Defendant's demurrer to the First Amended Complaint has been sustained in its entirety and Defendant is not named in any remaining causes of action.
