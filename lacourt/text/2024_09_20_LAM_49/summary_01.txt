Significant Statements:
  - "Continuing misuses of the discovery process warrant incrementally harsher sanctions until the sanction is reached that will curb the abuse."
  - "A decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly. But where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction."
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

Plaintiff Chloe Schneider moves for terminating sanctions against Defendant KidFocus LLC and Cameron Larian for misuse of the discovery process. The court finds that Defendant Larian has willfully ignored court orders and failed to comply with discovery requests, despite previous monetary sanctions. The court grants Plaintiff's motion and strikes Defendant's Answer to the First Amended Complaint, entering default. The court will address any default judgment through a default prove-up hearing.
