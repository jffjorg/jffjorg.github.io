And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to compel arbitration. The plaintiff, Zayda Cosby, commenced an action against the defendant, Inter-Con Security Systems, Inc. on May 10, 2024, alleging wrongful termination and whistleblower retaliation. The defendant filed a motion to compel arbitration based on an arbitration agreement signed by the plaintiff on April 11, 2013.

The judge found that the arbitration agreement is valid and enforceable, despite the plaintiff's claims of procedural and substantive unconscionability. The plaintiff argued that the agreement was presented on a take-it-or-leave-it basis and that there was unequal bargaining power, which created a high degree of procedural unconscionability. However, the judge found that this only established a modest degree of procedural unconscionability.

The plaintiff also argued that the agreement's discovery limitations were unconscionable, as they did not align with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. However, the judge found that while the discovery limitations were more restrictive than the Federal Rules, they were not sufficient on their own to render the entire arbitration agreement substantively unconscionable.

The judge ultimately severed the specific discovery limitations, finding that they were unconscionable, but that the remainder of the arbitration agreement remained enforceable. The action is stayed pending the results of the arbitration.
