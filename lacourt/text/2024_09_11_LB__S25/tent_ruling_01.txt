Hsini v. Mohsen Ghariani, et al. 
LASC Case No. 24LBCV00194
Hearing
Date: September 11, 2024
Request for Default Judgment by Court
 
 
In
preparation for the September 11, 2024 default judgment hearing, the court has identified
several concerns with Plaintiff’s request: 

 

Request for Entry of Default was
     entered on May 9, 2024 which is less than 30 days after service of the
     summons and complaint to Defendant Danielle Canissa and CDW Logistics, LLC.
     (C.C.P. §587);

 

Plaintiff checked the wrong box and
     should have checked “Court Judgment” in the “Request For” section on the
     1st page. (See 7/29/2024 Request for Entry of Default/Judgment);

 

No DOEs dismissal filed; 

 

No attached/adequate and/or
     authenticated exhibits provided with Plaintiff’s Declaration. Exhibits
     should demonstrate, e.g. costs for title and insurance for two vehicles,
     power of attorney, agreement entered into with Defendants to purchase
     trucks and provide logistic and shipping services to clients; 

 

No contractual or statutory basis
     provided by Plaintiff as to recovery of attorney fees. Also, attorney fees
     requested is more than what is allowed in a contract for recovery of
     reasonable attorney fees under Local Rule of the Court, rule 3.214(a);   

 

Prayer for complaint does not
     specify damages claimed; 

 

No notice of punitive damages as
     required under Code Civ. Proc., § 425.11, subd. (c).  Appears Plaintiff may be waiving
     punitive damages based upon proposed judgment;

 

Proposed Judgment (UD-100)
     incorrect calculations as to attorney fees and prejudgment interest
     calculations.
