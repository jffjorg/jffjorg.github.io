The court has identified several concerns with the plaintiff's request for default judgment. The plaintiff's request for entry of default was entered less than 30 days after service, which is less than the required 30 days. Additionally, the plaintiff checked the wrong box on the request for entry of default/judgment form. The court also notes that no DOEs dismissal was filed, no exhibits were provided with the plaintiff's declaration, and no contractual or statutory basis was provided for recovery of attorney fees. Furthermore, the prayer for complaint does not specify damages claimed, and no notice of punitive damages was provided as required. Finally, the proposed judgment has incorrect calculations for attorney fees and prejudgment interest. The court will consider these issues at the default judgment hearing on September 11, 2024.
