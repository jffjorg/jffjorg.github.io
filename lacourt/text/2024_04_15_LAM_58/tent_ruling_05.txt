Procedural Requirements 
 
            If all the
related cases have been filed in one superior court, as it is here, “[w]here
the cases listed in the notice are unlimited civil cases, the judge who has the
earliest filed case must determine whether the cases should be ordered related
and assigned to his or her department.” 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.300(h)(1)(A).) 
 
As 22STCV39168 is the earlier case,
Department 58 shall determine whether the cases are related.
 
            The notice
of related case must be filed in all pending cases listed in the notice and
must be served on all parties in those cases. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.300(d).) Plaintiffs Morad Ben Neman and Lancaster Eagle LLC filed a notice of
related case in both cases. 
 
            A party may
respond to a notice of related cases within five days of service on the
party.  (Cal. Rule of Court 3.300(g).) No party responded to the
notice of related cases. 
 
            The notice of related cases is
procedurally proper. 
 
Substantive Requirements 
 
            The inquiry
on a notice of related cases is whether the cases at issue (1) involve the same
parties and are based on the same or similar claims; (2) arise from the same or
substantially identical transactions, incidents, or events requiring the
determination of the same or substantially identical questions of law or fact;
(3) involve claims against, title to, possession of, or damages to the same
property; or (4) are likely for other reasons to require substantial
duplication of judicial resources if heard by different judges. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.300(a)(1)-(4).) 
 
            The
cases do not arise from the same nucleus of facts or law. 
            
The 22STCV39168 case arises out of
an alleged breach of an oral joint venture agreement to jointly purchase real
estate. Plaintiffs Morad Ben Neman and Lancaster Eagle,
LLC (Plaintiffs) filed suit against Defendants Payam Bahari, Freydoon
“Fred” Bahari Moghadam, Haim Bahari, Tal Bahari, and three entities: (1) 114
Grand Cypress, LLC, (2) Cavalini, Inc., and (3) Caster Modelo, LLC
(collectively, Defendants). The pleadings allege that Plaintiffs Morad Ben
Neman and Lancaster Eagle, LLC entered into a joint
venture agreement with Defendant to purchase real property located at 114 Grand
Cypress A venue, in Palmdale California (114 Grand Cypress). However, “Defendants
went behind Plaintiffs' back and purchased the 114 Grand Cypress Property
without Plaintiffs, in breach of their oral agreement to venture in the
purchase of the 114 Grand Cypress Property with Plaintiff.” 
 
In
the 23STCV18073 action, Plaintiff Lancaster Eagle, LLC alleges that it is a tenant
in common with non-party Caster Modelo, LLC for real property located at 42933
Business Center Parkway, Lancaster, CA 93535 (Lancaster Property). The
Complaint arises from allegations that Plaintiffs entered into a Purchase and
Sales Agreement wherein Plaintiff agreed to sell the Lancaster Property to Defendant
Bartz-Altadonna Community Health Center. The Complaint alleges that Defendant
Bartz-Altadonna Community Health Center breached the Purchase and Sales
Agreement and now seeks damages and specific performance on this contract. 
 
The
cases involve the different parties, different underlying contractual obligations,
different transactions, and different real property. The only overlap of issues
appears to be the allegation in 22STCV39168 action wherein Plaintiff mentions
the purchase of the Lancaster Property with Bahari Defendants and alleges its Tenants
in Common (TIC) Agreement with the Bahari Defendants “was consistent with the
parties' joint venture agreement, as set forth above.” (SAC ¶ 23.) However, the
fact that this TIC Agreement may “serve[] to evidence the parties' joint
venture agreement and also evidence[] part performance of the parties' oral
agreement” does not make the cases related. Therefore, the Court finds the
cases are not related under California Rule of Court 3.300(a).  
 
            Plaintiffs Morad Ben Neman and Lancaster Eagle LLC to give notice of this order in both 22STCV39168 and
23STCV18073.
