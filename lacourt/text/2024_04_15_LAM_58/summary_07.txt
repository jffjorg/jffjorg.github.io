```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion to quash service of process as premature. The defendants, Mathew Ludlow and Richard Abrams, argue that there was no service on them, as the complaint and summons were never personally served or posted and mailed. However, the plaintiff, GFD Wilcox LLC, has not filed a proof of service, and it was only on April 2, 2024, that the court ordered service by posting and mailing the summons and complaint. As a result, the judge finds that the defendants' motion challenging service of the summons and complaint is premature and denies the motion.
