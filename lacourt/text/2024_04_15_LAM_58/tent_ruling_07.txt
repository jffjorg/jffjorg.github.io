Case Name:                GFD Wilcox LLC v. Ludlow
Case No.:                    24STCV06155
Matter:                        Motion
to Quash Service of Process
Moving Parties:          Specially Appearing Defendants Mathew Ludlow and Richard Abrams
Responding Party:      Unopposed

Tentative Ruling:      Defendants’
motion to quash service of process is denied as premature.  

 
            This is an
unlawful detainer action. 
 
            On March

quashing service of the summons and complaint. No opposition was filed. 
 
            Defendants’
motion for order to quash service of summons is denied. 
 
Legal
Standard
            
            “In the
absence of a voluntary submission to the authority of the court, compliance
with the statutes governing service of process is essential to establish that
court’s personal jurisdiction over a defendant. When a defendant challenges
that jurisdiction by bringing a motion to quash, the burden is on the plaintiff
to prove the existence of jurisdiction by proving, inter alia, the facts
requisite to an effective service.” (Dill v. Berquist Construction Co.
(1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 1426, 1439–1440; accord Lebel v. Mai (2012) 210
Cal.App.4th 1154, 1160 [“It was incumbent upon plaintiff, after the filing of
defendant’s motion to quash, to present evidence discharging her burden to
establish the requisites of valid service on defendant”].) “[T]he filing of a
proof of service creates a rebuttable presumption that the service was proper,”
but only if it “complies with the statutory requirements regarding such
proofs.” (Id. at pp. 1441-1442.) 
 
            A plaintiff may substitute serve an
individual, but there must be strict requirements with the statutory
requirements. (Evartt v. Superior Court (1979) 89 Cal.App.3d 795, 799.) Thus,
if a copy of the summons and complaint “cannot with reasonable diligence be
personally delivered to the person to be served,” then substitute service under
Code of Civil Procedure section 415.20 may be allowed. 
 
The plaintiff
carries the burden of proving valid service. (See Coulston v. Cooper
(1966) 245 Cal.App.2d 866, 868; BBA Aviation PLC v. Superior Court
(2010) 190 Cal.App.4th 421, 428-429.)
 
Discussion
 
            Defendants
Ludlow and Abrams now move the Court to quash service of summons and Complaint on
the grounds that service was improper. 
 
            Specifically,
Defendants argue there was no service on Defendants; the complaint and summons
were never personally served, nor was it ever posted and mailed.
 
            Here, no
proof of service on the summons or Complaint has been filed. Thus, there is no
assertion by Plaintiff that service has been properly effectuated. In fact, it
was on only April 2, 2024 that Plaintiff received a Court order pursuant to
Code of Civil Procedures section 415.45 to allow service by posting the summons
and Complaint. 
 
Thus, Defendants’ motion
challenging service of the summons and complaint on March 25, 2024 is
premature. 
 
Conclusion
 
            The motion
to quash service of the summons is denied as premature.
