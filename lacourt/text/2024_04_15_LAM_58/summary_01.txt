And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The motion to expunge the lis pendens is granted. The request for attorney's fees is also granted in the amount of $3,500. The defendant, Roberto Coca Limon, moved to expunge the lis pendens filed on March 10, 2020, as the underlying family law judgment is now final. The court finds that the lis pendens is no longer necessary as the action is now final and there is no pending litigation. The court also awards the defendant's attorney fees in the amount of $3,500.
