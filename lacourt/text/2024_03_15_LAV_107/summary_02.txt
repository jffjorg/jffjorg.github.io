And here is the English text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling denies the defendant's motion to quash service of summons. The plaintiff, Ira Mandel, purchased a used vehicle from the defendant, Vegas Auto Gallery Lotus Cars Las Vegas, and later discovered that the odometer had been rolled back. The plaintiff notified the defendant and demanded that the sale be rescinded, but the defendant refused. The plaintiff filed a complaint alleging causes of action for intentional misrepresentation, negligent misrepresentation, violation of Business and Professions Code § 17200, et seq., and violation of the Consumer Legal Remedies Act.

The defendant argued that the court lacks personal jurisdiction over him, as he is a resident of Nevada who does business in Nevada, and that the plaintiff has not met his burden of showing that the court has personal jurisdiction over him. The plaintiff argued that the defendant purposefully availed himself of the benefits of doing business in California, as he directed the vehicle to be shipped to California and delivered to the plaintiff. The plaintiff also argued that the controversy at issue arises out of the defendant's contacts with the state and that it is in the interest of economy to have the case heard in California.

The judge found that the sale of the vehicle was completed in California, as the defendant did not surrender possession of the vehicle until it was delivered to the plaintiff in California. The judge also found that the defendant purposefully availed himself of the benefits of doing business in California and that the controversy at issue arises out of the defendant's contacts with the state. Finally, the judge concluded that it is in the interest of economy to have the case heard in California.
