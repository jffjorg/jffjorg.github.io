And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Melanie Almonte and Gloria Gonzales Almonte (Plaintiffs) against April Moore and Gregory Mizen (Defendants) regarding a motion to compel discovery and sanctions.

The Judge granted the motion to compel discovery, requiring Plaintiffs' attendance at depositions, but denied the request for document production. The judge also granted the Defendants' request for sanctions against Plaintiffs in the amount of $575.00.

The judge found that the Defendants had made a good faith effort to meet and confer with Plaintiffs' counsel regarding the depositions, but Plaintiffs' counsel failed to provide dates for the depositions and did not act with substantial justification in failing to produce the deponents for their noticed depositions.

The judge noted that Plaintiffs' counsel was engaged in a jury trial, but this was not an adequate excuse for failing to respond to the deposition notices and failing to produce the deponents for their noticed depositions. The judge also found that the Defendants had incurred reasonable expenses in bringing the motion, including attorney's fees, and awarded sanctions in the amount of $575.00.

The judge's tentative ruling is subject to change based on any objections or further argument that may be presented at the hearing.
