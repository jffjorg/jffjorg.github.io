Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the demurrers filed by the defendants, Maggie Ly Sien and Real Estate Elite Corporation, to the plaintiff's complaint and cross-complaint are sustained in their entirety without leave to amend. This means that the plaintiff's claims for breach of fiduciary duty, slander of title, conversion, and civil theft are not viable and cannot be cured by amendment.

The plaintiff, Zhenya He, had alleged that the defendants had wrongfully transferred her property and had failed to repay a large sum of money that she had loaned to one of the defendants. However, the judge found that the plaintiff had not pleaded facts sufficient to state a claim for breach of fiduciary duty, and that her claims for slander of title and civil theft were fatally uncertain and failed to allege that the defendants had received any stolen property.

The judge also noted that the plaintiff had not made any effort to demonstrate that she could cure her pleading by amendment, and that she had already amended her complaint twice without bringing forth viable claims.

As a result, the motions to strike are denied as moot, and the case will proceed no further.
