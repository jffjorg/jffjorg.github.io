And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the motion to strike the Third Amended Complaint filed by the Plaintiff, Christina Development Corporation, against the Defendants, Steven Raymond Short et al. The Court finds that the Plaintiff's Third Amended Complaint is untimely and should be stricken. The demurrer is moot since the motion to strike was granted. The Plaintiff filed the original complaint on September 1, 2022, and subsequently filed three amended complaints, with the Third Amended Complaint being filed seven days late. The Defendants filed a motion to strike the Third Amended Complaint on March 8, 2024, arguing that the amendments were untimely and that the complaint is insufficiently pled. The Court finds that the Plaintiff failed to meet and confer with the Defendants before filing the motion to strike, as required by California Code of Civil Procedure section 435.5. Therefore, the Court grants the motion to strike and finds that the demurrer is moot.
