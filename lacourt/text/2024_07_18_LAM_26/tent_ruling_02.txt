Background
 
On February
14, 2023, Plaintiff/Defendant/Cross-Defendant Zhenya He (“He” or “Plaintiff”)
filed her complaint in case number 23AHCV00325, He v. Chen. She filed
her operative second amended complaint (“SAC”) on January 10, 2024.
 
On November
28, 2023, He filed a cross-complaint in a related suit, Ku v. He, case
number 21STCV09634. The cross-complaint in Ku v. He is functionally
identical to the complaint in He v. Chen.
 
Defendants/cross-defendants
Maggie Ly Sien (“Ly”) and Real Estate Elite Corporation (“REEC”) (together,
“Defendants”) now challenge the functionally identical SAC and cross-complaint,
each on the same grounds.
 
Plaintiff alleges as follows in her 2024 SAC and her 2023 cross-complaint,
accepted as true for purposes of demurrer and motion to strike (paragraph
citations to the SAC unless otherwise noted):
 
Plaintiff purchased the property located at 1400 Circle Drive, San
Marino 91108 (“the Property”) around May 19, 2015. (¶ 17.) In June 2019,
Plaintiff registered an LLC, “Le Sky Group LLC”, and transferred ownership of
the Property to the newly-formed LLC. (¶¶ 19, 21.)
 
Plaintiff had loaned defendant Ying Chen a large sum of money in
2017. (¶ 24.) Chen failed to promptly pay her back, and Plaintiff and Chen
reached an agreement that Chen would pay the mortgage on the Property until
Chen could repay the whole loan to Plaintiff. (¶¶ 24-26.) In December 2020,
“Chen informed Plaintiff she had repaid the mortgage and suggested to Plaintiff
she could help Plaintiff sell the Property if she wanted.” (¶ 27, edits to
capitalization.) 
 
In late 2021, Plaintiff was in China. (¶ 29.) Her real estate
agent informed her that the Property “had been transferred unbeknownst to
[Plaintiff]” and Chen was “somehow involved with the alleged transfer”. (Ibid.)
Plaintiff contacted Chen, who informed her the Property had been transferred to
“ ‘a friend’ ” and Plaintiff would be paid full market value for it.
(Ibid.) The structure on the Property was subsequently torn down, and
Plaintiff was never paid. (¶ 30.)
 
As to defendants Maggie Ly Sien (“Ly”) and Real Estate Elite
Corporation (“REEC”), the moving parties here: according to the SAC, around
September and October 2020 defendant Ly, among others, inquired with a
representative of Chicago Title Company regarding “what documents would be
needed in order for Chen to be able to authorize the sale and transfer of
Plaintiff’s [P]roperty.” (¶ 34.) Ly and several of her co-defendants then
“instigated the creation and filing of a fraudulent Statement of Information as
to Le Sky Group LLC”, which added Chen as a “Manager” of the LLC, changed the
agent for service of process, and changed the service address. (¶¶ 35-36.) They
then “created an Operating Agreement for Le Sky Group LLC and forged
Plaintiff’s signature”. (¶ 38.)
 
With their fraudulently-obtained authority over Le Sky Group LLC,
the owner of the Property, Ly and her co-defendants then transferred title to
the Property without Plaintiff’s consent. (¶¶ 39-40.)
 
On February 14, 2024, Ly and REEC demurred to and moved to strike
portions of He’s cross-complaint in Ku v. He. Plaintiff has filed no
opposition, and Ly and REEC no reply.
 
On April 2, 2024, Ly and REEC demurred to and moved to strike
portions from Plaintiff’s SAC in He v. Chen. Plaintiff has filed no
opposition, and Ly and REEC no reply.
 
The demurrers and motions now come before the Court concurrently
in the two related cases. The pleadings and motions are substantially
identical, and the Court discusses them all together.
 
Discussion 
 
In support of their demurrer, Ly and REEC argue:
·                
The third cause of action for breach of
fiduciary duty, only
challenged in the demurrer to the SAC, not to the cross-complaint (one assumes
erroneously), fails because Plaintiff has not pled Ly or REEC was her
agent, and therefore owed her any fiduciary duty.
·                
The fourth cause of action for slander
of title fails because 
o   (1) Plaintiff does not allege Ly or REEC recorded a deed, nor did they,
nor can anyone infer they did based on Plaintiff’s allegations, because a real
estate agent/company does not have a duty to record a deed related to a
transaction; and 
o   (2) Plaintiff does not allege any false deed was recorded, even if she
alleges the underlying transaction was fraudulent;
·                
The fifth cause of action for conversion
fails because it only applies to personal property; and
·                
The seventh cause of action fails
because Plaintiff has not alleged Defendants received any stolen property.
The demurrer is sustained, so the motion
to strike is moot.
ANALYSIS
 
A.     
Timeliness; Meeting and Conference
 
A demurrer or
motion to strike must be filed within 30 days of being served with a complaint.
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 430.40, 435 (b)(1).) Each must be accompanied by the
moving party’s declaration attesting to a good-faith effort to meet and confer
prior to filing. (Id., §§ 430.41, 435.5.)
 
Counsel
confirms via declaration that the parties conferred about a timeline for
challenging the related pleadings in each case. The demurrer and motion to
strike are timely based on the parties’ agreement, and the parties met and
conferred regarding their dispute. (See Loangkote Decl., ¶¶ 3-6.)
 
B.      Legal
Standard for Demurrer
 
Where
pleadings are defective, a party may raise the defect by way of a demurrer. (Coyne
v. Krempels (1950) 36 Cal.2d 257, 262.) A demurrer for sufficiency tests
whether the complaint alleges facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.
(Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 430.10; Young v. Gannon (2002) 97 Cal.App.4th
209, 220.) 
 
When
considering a demurrer, a court reads the allegations stated in the challenged
pleading liberally and in context, and “treat[s] the demurrer as admitting all
material facts properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions
of fact or law.” (Serrano v. Priest (1971) 5 Cal.3d 584, 591.) Put
differently: for purposes of demurrer, the court treats all facts alleged – but
only the facts alleged – in the complaint as true. (Picton v.
Anderson Union High School District (1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 726, 732.) “The only issue
involved in a demurrer hearing is whether the complaint, as it stands,
unconnected with extraneous matters, states a cause of action.” (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) 
 
C.      Analysis
 
Third Cause
of Action for Breach of Fiduciary Duty
 
Defendants
challenge Plaintiff’s third cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty in
their demurrer to her SAC in He v. Chen, but not their demurrer to her
cross-complaint in Ku v. He. The Court assumes this was administrative
error; the ruling applies equally to both pleadings.
 
To state a
claim for breach of fiduciary duty a plaintiff must plead “the existence of a
fiduciary relationship, its breach, and damage proximately caused by that
breach.” (Thomson v. Canyon (2011)
198 Cal.App.4th 594, 604.) 
 
Plaintiff
does not plead that Ly or REEC owed her a fiduciary duty. “A fiduciary relationship is ‘ “any relation existing
between parties to a transaction wherein one of the parties is in duty bound to
act with the utmost good faith for the benefit of the other party.’ ” (Wolf v. Superior Court (2003)
107 Cal.App.4th 25, 29.) Plaintiff alleges Defendants owed a duty to “
‘all foreseeable plaintiffs’ ” based on their profession. The Court is not
aware of authority stating that real estate professionals owe a fiduciary duty
to the public writ large. Plaintiff has not filed an opposition citing any. 
 
Plaintiff
has not pled facts showing Defendants owed a duty specifically to her,
so she has not stated a claim against them for breach of fiduciary duty.
 

Fourth Cause of Action for Slander of Title
 
The elements of a cause of action for slander of title are “(1) a
publication, (2) which is without privilege or justification, (3) which is
false, and (4) which causes direct and immediate pecuniary loss.” (Manhattan
Loft, LLC v. Mercury Liquors, Inc. (2009) 173 Cal.App.4th 1040, 1051.)
 
Defendants argue “it is not the responsibility of a real estate
agent to record or cause to be recorded title relating to real property ... .”
(MPA, 9:3-4.) The relevance of this argument is unclear. Whether or not it was
Defendants’ responsibility to record a deed has no bearing on whether they
actually did so, or whether the deed was true or false.
 
Defendants also argue Plaintiff did not allege Defendants
published anything false. On this point, the Court agrees. The general
background facts in the SAC and cross-complaint do not contain a specific
allegation that Ly or REEC made any publication. The allegations beneath the
cause of action itself state generally that “Defendants” published a false
statement. When the joint liability of multiple defendants is unclear, but a
complaint fails to distinguish between them, the complaint may fail for
uncertainty. (See Landau v. Salam (1971) 4 Cal.3d 901, 909.) Plaintiff’s
complaint fails for this reason. Without differentiating the nine (9)
defendants and their purported involvement with the alleged false deed, none of
the defendants can ascertain what she accuses them of, specifically.
 
Plaintiff’s claim for slander of title is fatally uncertain as to
Ly and REEC.
 
              Fifth Cause
of Action for Conversion
 
“ ‘Conversion is generally described as the
wrongful exercise of dominion over the personal property of another.
[Citation.] The basic elements of the tort are (1) the plaintiff's ownership or
right to possession of personal property; (2) the defendant's disposition of
the property in a manner that is inconsistent with the plaintiff's property
rights; and (3) resulting damages.
[Citation.]’ (Fremont Indemnity Co. v.
Fremont General Corp. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97, 119 (Fremont).)
 
Plaintiff does not allege Defendants disposed of any of her personal
property. Her conversion claim fails.
 
              Seventh
Cause of Action for Civil Theft
 
To plead a cause of action
for “civil theft” under Penal Code section 496, a plaintiff must allege three
elements: (1) property stolen or obtained by theft or fraud; (2) defendant’s
knowledge that it was so obtained; and (3) defendant’s receipt or possession of
the property. (Switzer v. Wood (2019) 35 Cal.App.5th 116, 126.)
 
Plaintiff accuses Ly and REEC, collectively with their
co-defendants, of engaging in a scheme to take her property. The SAC implies
that Defendants somehow profited from the scheme. But it does not allege Defendants
actually received any stolen property. As a result, Plaintiff has not stated a
claim. Defendants’ demurrer is sustained.
 
D.     Leave to
Amend 
 
“Where the complaint is defective, [i]n the furtherance of justice
great liberality should be exercised in permitting a plaintiff to amend his [or
her] complaint…However, if the plaintiff's causes of action is [sic] not
viable, leave to amend should not be granted if there is no basis for the court
to conclude further amendment would cure the defects.” (Favila v. Katten
Muchin Rosenman LLP (2010) 188 Cal.App.4th 189, 211, internal quotations
omitted.) If the demurrer is sustained, plaintiff “has the burden of proving
the possibility of cure by amendment.” (Czajkowski v. Haskell & White,
LLP (2012) 208 Cal.App.4th 166, 173, citing Grinzi v. San Diego Hospice
Corp. (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 72, 78-79).
 
Plaintiff filed no opposition to either demurrer. As a result, she
made no effort to demonstrate she can cure her pleading by amendment. She has
also amended her complaint twice already, but still fails to state claims
against Ly or REEC.
 
It is Plaintiff’s burden to show she can amend her complaint to
state a claim, and she has not done so. The Court must sustain both demurrers
without leave to amend.
 
E.      Conclusion
 
Cross-Defendants’ demurrer to the cross-complaint in Hin Ku
v. Zhenya He, et al., 21STCV09634, filed February 14, 2024, is SUSTAINED in its
entirety WITHOUT LEAVE to amend.
 
Defendants’ demurrer to the complaint in Zhenya He v. Ying
Chen, et al., 23AHCV00325, filed April
2, 2024, is SUSTAINED in its entirety WITHOUT LEAVE to amend.
 
The
motions to strike are denied as moot.
