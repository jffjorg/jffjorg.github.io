II. ANALYSIS
 
A.      Legal
Standard for Motion to be Relieved as Counsel 
 The
court may order that an attorney be changed or substituted at any time before
or after judgment or final determination upon request by either client or attorney
and after notice from one to the other. (Code Civ. Proc. § 284, subd. (2).)
“The determination whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel
lies within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi & Levine
v. Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1133.) An application to be
relieved as counsel must be made on Judicial Counsel Forms MC-051 (Notice of
Motion and Motion), MC-052 (Declaration), and MC-053 (Proposed Order). (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, subds. (a), (c), (e).) 
 
In
addition, California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362 subsection (d) requires that
the notice of motion and motion, declaration, and proposed order be served on
the client and all other parties who have appeared in the case by personal
service, electronic service, or mail. If the notice is served by mail, it must
be accompanied by a declaration stating facts showing that either: 
(A)   
The
service address is the current residence or business address of the client; or 
 
(B)   
The
service address is the last known residence or business address of the client,
and the attorney has been unable to locate a more current address after making
reasonable efforts to do so within 30 days before the filing of the motion to
be relieved. 
 
(Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, subd. (1)(A) & (2).)  
 
B.      Discussion
 
As a
preliminary matter, the Court notes that Counsel has filed four motions to be
relieved as counsel for Defendants
Toranji Inc., Farbod Pirshirazi, Farinaz Pirshirazi, and Farshad Pirshirazi.
The Court has reviewed the moving papers, which all list the same reason for
the motion. For the sake of efficiency the Court addresses all four motions
below. 
 
On April 09, 2024, Counsel moved for the Court to relieve
him as counsel of record for Defendants Toranji Inc., Farbod Pirshirazi, Farinaz Pirshirazi, and
Farshad Pirshirazi.. (Mot. (MC-051).) Counsel properly filed a Notice of
Motion and Motion (MC-051). Counsel also filed a Declaration in Support of the
Motion (MC-052), citing irreconcilable breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. (MC-052, ¶ 2.) On Form MC-052, Counsel additionally
indicates that he has served Defendant by mailing copies of the motion papers
to
Plaintiff’s last known address. (MC-052 ¶ 3a(2).)
 
Counsel also provided the Court with a Proposed
Order, Form MC-053, which further includes Proof of Service indicating that
both Plaintiff and Defendants have been served with the Notice, Motion,
Declaration, and Order. (MC-053.)
 
The Court
finds that all procedural requirements have been satisfied and there is no
showing that withdrawal would cause injustice or
undue delay in the proceedings. 

III. DISPOSITION
 
Accordingly,
Counselor Wiseman’s Motions to be relieved as Counsel for Defendants Toranji Inc., Farbod Pirshirazi,
Farinaz Pirshirazi, and Farshad Pirshirazi are GRANTED. 
 
Counsel to give notice.
