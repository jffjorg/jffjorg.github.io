And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Mirshahi v. Pelloni, et al. (BC682267). The ruling denies the Defendant's motion to tax costs, which was filed on December 4, 2023. The Defendant, Mary Pelloni, argued that the Plaintiff, Saeedeh Mirshahi, is not entitled to recover costs because the claimed costs were not reasonably necessary to the litigation and were not properly explained.

The Judge found that all of the claimed costs are allowable costs under Code of Civil Procedure Section 1033.5, subdivision (a), and that the Plaintiff properly verified its Memorandum of Costs. The Judge noted that the Defendant did not provide any evidence or argument to support its contention that the claimed costs were not reasonable or necessary.

The Judge therefore denied the Defendant's motion to tax costs, finding that the Plaintiff is entitled to recover the claimed costs as a matter of right.
