motion TO TAX COSTS (filed 12/4/2023)
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
Defendant Mary Pelloni’s motion to tax costs is
DENIED. 
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
On November 3, 2024, Plaintiff Saeedeh Mirshahi (“Plaintiff”)
brought this contractual fraud action against Defendants Mary Pelloni and Mary
Pelloni Productions, Inc. (collectively “Pelloni Defendants”). The Complaint
alleged nine causes of action for: (1) Breach of Oral Partnership Agreement;
(2) Breach of Fiduciary Duty; (3) Fraud; (4) Conversion of Money; (5)
Conversion of Property; (6) Accounting; (7) Constructive Trust; (8) Claim and
Delivery; and (9) Injunctive Relief.
 
On September
27, 2021, the Court held the trial of equitable issues and entered a Final
State of Decision on May 27, 2022.
 
On July 5,
2023, the Court held the trial of legal issues 
and the jury rendered its verdict on liability and compensatory damages.
Default judgment was entered against Defendant Mary Pelloni Productions, Inc.
in the amount of $40,000.
 
On November
6, 2023, the Court denied Defendant Pelloni’s Motion for Judgment
Notwithstanding the Verdict and for New Trial upon Plaintiff’s acceptance to
reduce damages for lost money from $40,000 to $16,522.24 and for loss profits
from $60,000 to $0.00. As such, judgment was entered in favor of Plaintiff against
defaulting Defendant Mary Productions, Inc., in the amount of $50,293.58 and
against Defendant Pelloni in the amount of $426,815.82. 
 
On November
21, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Memorandum of Costs. 
 
On December 4, 2023, Defendant Pelloni filed a Motion to Tax Costs,
arguing:
·                
Plaintiff seeks recovery of costs to
which she is not entitled to by statute;
·                
Absent further explanation and/or
evidentiary substantiation, Plaintiff’s filing and motion fees, deposition
costs, service of process fees, attorney fees, court reporter fees, electronic
filing or service fees, and other costs should be taxed
·                
The statutory penalty under Penal Code
Section 638.51 is Plaintiff’s exclusive remedy; and
·                
Plaintiff does not allege any facts supporting
or showing entitlement to attorneys’ fees.
As of July 17, 2024, no opposition or
reply brief has been filed.
 
II. ANALYSIS
 
A.      Legal
Standard for Motion to Tax Costs
 
“A prevailing party is entitled ‘as a matter of right’ to recover
costs in any action or proceeding unless a statute expressly provides
otherwise.”¿(Segal v. ASICS America Corp. (2022) 12 Cal.5th 651, 658.)¿
“Section 1033.5 sets forth the types of expenses that are and are not allowable
as costs under section 1032. Specifically, subdivision (a) of section 1033.5
describes items that are ‘allowable as costs,’ subdivision (b) describes items
‘not allowable as costs, except when expressly authorized by law,’ and section
1033.5(c)(4) provides that ‘[i]tems not mentioned in this section and items
assessed upon application may be allowed or denied in the court's
discretion.’”¿(Ibid.)¿
 
B.      Analysis
 
Defendant
Pelloni moves to tax the costs claimed in Plaintiff’s Memorandum of Costs
(“MOC”) filed on November 21, 2023. More specifically, Defendant Pelloni
contends the following claimed costs should be taxed: (1) filing and motion
fees in the amount of $1,305; (2) deposition costs in the amount of $2,413.55;
(3) service of process fees in the amount of $615.76; (4) attorney fees in the
amount of $577,513.79; (5) court reporter fees as established by statute in the
amount of $34,283.06; (6) fees for electronic filing or service in the amount
of $3,147.88; and (7) other costs in the amount of $3,129.35.
 
“A prevailing party who claims costs must serve and file a memorandum of
costs within 15 days after the date of service of the notice of entry of
judgment or dismissal by the clerk under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.5
or the date of service of written notice of entry of judgment or dismissal, or
within 180 days after entry of judgment, whichever is first. The memorandum of
costs must be verified by a statement of the party, attorney, or agent that to
the best of his or her knowledge the items of cost are correct and were
necessarily incurred in the case.”(Cal. Rules of Ct., rule 3.1700(a)(1).)
 
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure Section 1033.5, subdivision (a), the
following are allowable costs: “[¶](1) Filing, motion, and jury fees. [¶](3)(A)
Taking, video recording, and transcribing necessary depositions, including an
original and one copy of those taken by the claimant and one copy of
depositions taken by the party against whom costs are allowed. [¶](4) Service
of process by a public officer, registered process server, or other means. [¶](10)
Attorney’s Fees, when authorized by…(A) Contract…(B) Statute…(C) Law. [¶](11)
Court reporter fees as established by statute. [¶](14) Fees for the electronic filing or service of documents through an
electronic filing service provider if a court requires or orders electronic
filing or service of documents. [¶](16) Any other item that is required to be awarded to the prevailing party
pursuant to statute as an incident to prevailing in the action at trial or on
appeal.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5(a).)
 
To recover a cost, it must be reasonably necessary to the litigation and
reasonable in amount. (Perko’s Enterprises, Inc. v. RRNS Enterprises (1992)
4 Cal.App.4th 238, 244.) If the items appearing in a cost bill appear to be
proper charges, the burden is on the party seeking to tax costs to show that
they were not reasonable or necessary. (Ladas v. California State Automotive
Assoc. (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761, 773-74.)¿ On the other hand, if the items
are properly objected to, they are put in issue and the burden of proof is on
the party claiming them as costs. (Id.)¿¿¿
 
Here, all of Plaintiff’s claimed costs are
allowable costs under Code of Civil Procedure Section 1033.5, subdivision (a).
Nonetheless, Defendant Pelloni appears to argue that the $1,305 in filing and
motion fees requested by Plaintiff is unwarranted and/or unexplained. As such,
Defendant Pelloni contends without further explanation or information from
Plaintiff, it is impossible to ascertain the validity of the claimed costs.
Thus, Defendant Pelloni argues these claimed costs should be taxed. However,
Defendant Pelloni cites no legal authority that requires Plaintiff to provide or
attach information such as invoices, bills, or other documentation to support
the claimed costs when initially filing an MOC. Moreover, Defendant Pelloni
makes no argument that Plaintiff’s MOC is unverified. In Bach v. County of
Butte (1989) 215 Cal.App.3d 294, the court held “a properly verified
memorandum of costs is considered prima facie evidence that the costs listed in
the memorandum were necessarily incurred.” (Bach v. County of Butte
(1989) 215 Cal.App.3d 294, 308.) “Documentation must be submitted only when a
party dissatisfied with the costs claimed in the memorandum challenges them by
filing a motion to tax costs.” (Id.) Finally, the burden is on Defendant
Pelloni to show the claimed costs are not reasonable or necessary and she makes
no such argument or showing in the instant motion. 
 
Therefore, the motion is DENIED.
