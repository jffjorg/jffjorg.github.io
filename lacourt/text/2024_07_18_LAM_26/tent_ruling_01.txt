and (5) breach of contract.

II.           
ANALYSIS
 
A.      Legal
Standard for Demurrer with Motion to Strike
 
Motions to
strike are used to reach defects or objections to pleadings that are not
challengeable by demurrer (i.e., words, phrases, prayer for damages,
etc.).  (See CCP §§ 435-437.)  A party may file a motion to
strike in whole or in part within the time allowed to respond to a pleading,
however, if a party serves and files a motion to strike without demurring to
the complaint, the time to answer is extended.  (CCP §§ 435(b)(1),
435(c).) 
 
A motion to
strike lies only where the pleading has irrelevant, false, or improper matter,
or has not been drawn or filed in conformity with laws.  (CCP §
436.)  The grounds for moving to strike must appear on the face of the
pleadings or by way of judicial notice.  (CCP § 437.) 
 
Demurrer 
“[A] demurrer
tests the legal sufficiency of the allegations in a complaint.” (Lewis v.
Safeway, Inc. (2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 385, 388.) A demurrer can be used only
to challenge defects that appear on the face of the pleading under attack or
from matters outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable. (See Donabedian
v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994 [in ruling on a
demurrer, a court may not consider declarations, matters not subject to
judicial notice, or documents not accepted for the truth of their contents].)
For purposes of ruling on a demurrer, all facts pleaded in a complaint are
assumed to be true, but the reviewing court does not assume the truth of
conclusions of law. (Aubry v. Tri-City Hosp. Dist. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962,
967.) 
 
The question
of plaintiff's ability to prove these allegations is of no concern at the
pleadings stage. (See Committee on Children’s Television, Inc. v. General
Foods Corp., (1983) 35 Cal.3d 197, 213-214. [“It is not the ordinary
function of a demurrer to test the truth of the plaintiff's allegations or the
accuracy with which he describes the defendant's conduct.”])
 
Meet and
Confer
 
“Before
filing a demurrer…the demurring party shall meet and confer in person or by
telephone with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for
the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would
resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer.” (CCP § 430.41(a); see
also CCP § 435.5 (imposing similar requirements for a motion to strike).) 
 
Code of Civil
Procedure section 435.5, subdivision (a) requires that “[b]efore filing
a¿motion to strike pursuant to this chapter, the moving party shall meet and
confer¿in person or by telephone¿with the party who filed the pleading that is
subject to the motion to strike for the purpose of determining whether an
agreement can be reached that would resolve the objections to be raised in the
motion to strike.” The parties are to meet and confer at least five days before
the date the responsive pleading is due and if they are unable to meet the
demurring party shall be granted an automatic 30-day extension.¿ (Code Civ.
Proc., § 435.5(a)(2).)¿ The moving party must also file and serve a declaration
detailing the meet and confer efforts.¿ (Id.¿at (a)(3).)¿ If an amended
pleading is filed, the parties must meet and confer again before a motion to
strike may be filed to the amended pleading.¿ (Id.¿at (a).)¿  
 
Here, Moving Defendants sufficiently met and conferred.  (Princi
Decl. ¶ 8, Exh. B.) 
 
1.      Evidence in
Support of the Motion  
 
Motion to
Strike
 
On December
14, 2023, the Court sustained Defendant’s demurrer to the six causes of action
which are the subject of the instant demurrer, with leave to amend (the
“Demurrer Order”). (Gill Decl. ¶ 5, Exhibit B.) The Court ordered Plaintiff to
file and serve his Third Amended Complaint (“TAC”) by January 15, 2024, but
Plaintiff filed his TAC seven days late on January 22, 2024. (Gill Decl. ¶ 5,
Exhibits C & D.) Therefore, Plaintiff’s TAC is untimely and should be
stricken under Rule 3.1320(i) of the California Rules of Court.  Thus, the Motion to Strike is granted.  
 
Demurrer
 
The demurrer
is moot since the Motion to Strike was granted. 
 
2.      Evidence in
Opposition to the Motion
None. 
 
III.           
DISPOSITION

 
Based on the foregoing, the Court GRANTS the Motion To Strike Third
Amended Complaint. Demurrer is moot.
