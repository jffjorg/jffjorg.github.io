Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by Defendant Michael Broukhim. The Court has denied the motion to strike and has overruled the demurrer.

The case involves a dispute between neighbors, where the Broukhim Property installed an underground drainage pipe without permits, causing water and mud to flow onto the Ofshe Property. The Ofshe's brought the issue to the attention of Moving Defendant, but he refused to remedy the damage. The Ofshe's have alleged claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress, trespass, and nuisance, and are seeking punitive damages.

The Court has concluded that the Ofshe's have sufficiently alleged an intent to injure, and therefore, malice. The Court has also determined that the Ofshe's have sufficiently alleged extreme and outrageous conduct, and therefore, their claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress is valid.

The Court has denied the motion to strike the prayer for punitive damages and the related allegations that Moving Defendant's conduct was willful, intentional, malicious, fraudulent, or oppressive.
