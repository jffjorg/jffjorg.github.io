And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on Cell-Crete Corporation's motion for a determination of good faith settlement. The case involves a construction defect dispute between Q3 Engineers Inc. and Q3 Builders Inc. (the Plaintiffs) and Cell-Crete Corporation. The Plaintiffs hired Cell-Crete to install lightweight concrete over roof decks, but Stanford Culver, the owner of the property, filed a demand for arbitration against the Plaintiffs alleging damage in excess of $2,500,000. The Plaintiffs deny wrongdoing and blame the subcontractors, including Cell-Crete, for the damage.

The parties have entered into a settlement contingent on the court finding that the settlement was made in good faith. The settlement requires Cell-Crete to pay $5,000 in exchange for a dismissal of the complaint against it and a full and complete release of any claims related to its work on the property.

The judge has evaluated the settlement using the factors outlined in Tech-Bilt Inc. V. Woodward-Clyde & Assocs. (1985) 38 Cal.3d 488, including a rough approximation of the Plaintiffs' total recovery and Cell-Crete's proportionate liability, the amount paid in settlement, the allocation of settlement proceeds, the discount for settlement before trial, the financial condition and insurance policy limits of settling defendants, and the existence of collusion, fraud, or tortious conduct.

Based on these factors, the judge has concluded that the settlement was made in good faith. The judge has granted Cell-Crete's motion for a determination of good faith settlement.
