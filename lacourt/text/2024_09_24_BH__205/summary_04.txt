And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling sustaining the demurrer filed by Defendant Donald Marks without leave to amend. The case is a legal malpractice action brought by Plaintiff Hossain Sahlolbei, alleging that Defendant failed to perform his services adequately in representing Plaintiff in an appeal from a criminal conviction for grand theft. The Court of Appeals affirmed Plaintiff's conviction and sentence, and the California Supreme Court denied Plaintiff's petition for review.

The judge finds that Plaintiff cannot allege actual innocence, which is an essential element of a malpractice cause of action in a criminal representation. The Court further finds that Plaintiff has failed to allege that he obtained post-conviction relief, which is a necessary prerequisite to proving actual innocence in a malpractice action against former criminal defense counsel.

The judge grants Defendant's request for judicial notice of various orders and pleadings in the underlying criminal matter, but finds that Plaintiff has not alleged actual innocence or obtained the necessary post-conviction relief. Therefore, the Court sustains the demurrer without leave to amend, dismissing the complaint.
