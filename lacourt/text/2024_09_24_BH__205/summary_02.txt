```

And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has denied the Defendant's motion to compel further responses to Requests for Production of Documents (Set Two) due to the lack of good cause for the discovery sought. The Defendant had argued that the Plaintiff's responses were evasive and not code-compliant, but the Court found that the Defendant did not provide sufficient evidence to support this claim. The Court also noted that the Plaintiff did not fully comply with the purported agreement reached at the Informal Discovery Conference regarding the production of cell phone records. The Court denied the Defendant's request for sanctions and the Plaintiff's request for fees related to the prior motion to compel, as there was no basis for the sanctions and the Court did not deny the prior motion on its merits.
