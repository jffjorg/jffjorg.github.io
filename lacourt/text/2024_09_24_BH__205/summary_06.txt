And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the landlord's application for a writ of attachment against the tenant. The landlord, 3435 Ocean Park, LLC, is seeking to attach the tenant's property to secure recovery on its claim for breach of the commercial lease and guaranty. However, the judge found that the landlord's application was not verified by its representative and was supported by a declaration that referenced exhibits that were not attached. As a result, the judge was unable to determine whether the landlord has a probable validity of prevailing on its claims. The judge also noted that the landlord has not demonstrated that the amount at issue is fixed and readily ascertainable, as required by law. Therefore, the judge denied the landlord's application for a writ of attachment.
