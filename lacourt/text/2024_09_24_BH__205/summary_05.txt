And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge issues a tentative ruling granting the petition for pre-commencement discovery filed by Wismann Group, LLC and William Wismann. The petitioners seek to depose Jimmy Smith, Egypt McKee, and Susan Adelman, principals of Genesis, to perpetuate their testimony and preserve evidence before filing a malicious prosecution claim. The judge finds that the petition meets all the requirements for pre-commencement discovery under California Code of Civil Procedure Section 2035.030. The judge also grants the petitioners' request for judicial notice of certain court records related to the underlying action. The judge concludes that the petitioners have demonstrated a good reason for seeking pre-commencement discovery, including the risk that memories will fade as two of the deponents are elderly.
