CASE:                         LILIANA D TREVINO vs GENERAL MOTORS LLC
 
CASE NO.:                 23STCV27056            
 
MOTION
TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TO REQUESTS FOR PRODUCTION (SET ONE); 

 
MOVING PARTY:               Plaintiff LILIANA D TREVINO 
 
RESPONDING PARTY(S): Defendant GENERAL
MOTORS LLC (“GM”)
 
STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is a lemon law action filed on November 3, 2023. Plaintiff purchased
a 2018 Chevrolet Equinox which
subsequently manifested defects in the body, powertrain, safety and electrical
systems, braking system and the noise system. 
 
Plaintiff moves to compel further
responses to specific requests for production propounded to Defendant. 
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
            Plaintiff’s
Motion to Compel Further Responses is GRANTED.
 
            Defendant
is ordered to provide verified, code-compliant responses without objections to
Requests for Production Nos. 16 through 21 within 30 days of this order. 
 
DISCUSSION:
 
Plaintiff moves to compel further
responses to specific requests for production propounded to Defendant. 
 
Legal Standard
 
Under Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.310, subdivision (a), a court
may order a party to serve a further response to a demand for inspection when
the court finds that: “(1) A statement of compliance with the demand is
incomplete[;] (2) A representation of inability to comply is inadequate,
incomplete, or evasive[; or] (3) An objection in the response is without merit
or too general.”
 
The burden is on the moving party to “set forth specific facts showing
good cause justifying the discovery sought by the demand.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.310, subd. (b)(1).) These facts must also be set forth in a separate
statement filed by the moving party. (Cal. Rules of Court Rule 3.1345(c).) This
burden “is met simply by a fact-specific showing of relevance.” (TBG Ins.
Servs. Corp. v. Superior Court (2002) 96 Cal.App.4th 443, 448.)
 
Timeliness
 
A motion to compel further
responses to requests for production must be served “within 45 days of the
service of the verified response, or any supplemental verified response, or on
or before any specific later date to which the propounding party and the responding
party have agreed in writing.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.310(c).) The 45-day
requirement is mandatory and jurisdictional. (Sexton v. Superior 23STCVCourt¿(1997)
58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.)
 
            Plaintiff propounded the discovery
at issue on January 25, 2024. (Declaration of Nicolas Lee ISO Mot. ¶ 14; Exh. 4.)
Defendant’s original responses were served electronically on February 26, 2024,
without document production on December 5, 2023, and with verifications and
initial document production on March 26, 2024. (Id. ¶¶ 15-16; Exhs. 5-6.)
On May 6, 2024, Plaintiff sent GM a signed protective order. The
following day, on May 7, 2024, GM supplemented its document production pursuant
to the stipulation and entry of a protective order. (Kay Decl. ¶ 8; Exh. A.) Forty-five days from March 26, 2024, is May
28, 2024. The motion was filed on May 14, 2024. Therefore, this motion is
timely. 
 
Meet and Confer
 
A party making a motion to compel further responses must include a
declaration stating facts showing a “reasonable and good faith attempt” to
resolve informally the issues presented by the motion before filing the motion.
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2016.040, 2031.310, subd. (b)(2).)
 
            The Declaration of Nicolas Lee in
support of the motion describes Plaintiff’s extensive efforts to informally
resolve this dispute, including multiple meet-and-confer
letters. (Lee Decl. ¶¶ 17-25.) Plaintiff has therefore satisfied his
statutory meet-and-confer obligations. 
 
Good Cause
 
            Plaintiff moves to compel further
responses to Requests for Production Nos. 16-21. These requests seek all
documents relating to internal analysis or investigation into the “engine
defect” (Lee Decl. Exh. 4. No. 16), communications regarding the “engine
defect” (No. 17); decisions to issue notices, letters, campaigns, warranty
extensions, technical service bulletins, and recalls concerning the “engine
defect” (No. 18); customer complaints, reported failures, and warranty claims;
(No. 19); failure rates as a result of the “engine defect” (No. 20); and fixes
for the “engine defect.” (No. 21.) All requests pertain not only to the subject
vehicle but to vehicles of the same year, make, and model. The requests define
“engine defect to mean:
 
such defects which result in
symptoms including, but not limited to: premature failure of engine; reduced
engine power; engine malfunction; illumination of check engine light; excessive
oil consumption; persistent oil low level; TSB 00-06-01-026Q; TSB 22-NA-224;
TSB 20- NA-138; and any other concern identified in the repair history for the
subject 2018 Chevrolet Equinox; Vehicle Identification Number 3GNAXJEV3JS571624
(Lee Decl. Exh. 4. p.3:14:20.)
 
            Evidence of similar defects
in other vehicles are both relevant and admissible. (Donlen v. Ford Motor
Co. (2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 138, 153.) Admissible evidence is discoverable.
(Glenfed Development Corp. v. Superior Court (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 1113,
1117-18.) Documents regarding warranty complaints, service histories, and
employee records concerning a defect in all affected vehicles, as well as
documents regarding the manufacturer’s responses and instructions to cure that
defect are discoverable. (See Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174
Cal.App.4th 967, 971 [holding that the trial court’s approval of a discovery
referee’s report and recommendation of sanctions for failure to produce
documents of this nature relating to the subject defect in all affected
vehicles was not an abuse of discretion].) Applying this well-settled precedent, the Court therefore finds that
Plaintiff has shown good cause for these requests. 
 
Defendant’s
Responses
 
            In response to each request, Defendant
asserted substantially identical boilerplate objections that the requests were
not reasonably particularized, were overbroad and argumentative, that the
definition of “engine defect” was not sufficiently specific, that the requests
seek confidential or privileged information, that the request for
electronically stored information is overbroad and unduly burdensome, and that
the vehicle was purchased used and therefore not subject to the remedies of the
Song-Beverly Act. (See, e.g., Lee Decl. Exh. 6. No. 16.) Defendant also
specifically objected to Request No. 18 as seeking information regarding other
customers which is irrelevant and violates their privacy rights. (Id.
No. 18.) 
 
            In opposition, Defendant first
argues that Plaintiff failed to sufficiently meet and confer in good faith
because Plaintiff’s letters lacked substantive reasoning or analysis.  (Opp’n at p.4.) The Court disagrees. (See
Lee Decl. Exhs. 7-10.) Moreover, Defendant
entirely fails to justify any of its objections beyond baldly asserting that the
responses are overbroad and irrelevant, or, alternatively, that Plaintiff has
not demonstrated that the objections are invalid. However, the burden is
on Defendant to justify any failure to fully respond to these requests. (See Coy
v. Superior Court (1962) 58 Cal.2d 210, 220–221.) Defendant has failed to
do so. To the extent that any documents disclose trade secrets or other
confidential material, Defendant may produce it subject to a protective order
based on the format in the Superior Court’s sample protective order.  With that caveate, Plaintiff is entitled to
an order compelling further responses. 
 
CONCLUSION:

 
            Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Further Responses is GRANTED.
 
            Defendant
is ordered to provide verified, code-compliant responses without objections to
Requests for Production Nos. 16 through 21 within 30 days of this order. 
 
            Moving
Party to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.

conduct a hearing if any party appears. By submitting on the tentative you
have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you
should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an
order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
