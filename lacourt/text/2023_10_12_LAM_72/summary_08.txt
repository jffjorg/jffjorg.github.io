(Cheng v. Coastal L.B. Assocs., LLC (2021) 69 Cal. App. 5th 112, 123)
  - "The 'fair market value' determination should consider appropriate discounts for Rice's minority, non-controlling interest, the contractual limitations on further disposition of the interest, and other factors that might affect overall marketability of the interest; The 'fair market value' determination should not consider the value of HPD as a single going concern; The 'fair market value' determination should consider the state of HPD as it was on May 5, 2016, and avoid considering speculative and hypothetical outcomes unless substantiated by other prevailing facts, including the mindset and position(s) of HPD's management at that time." (Kaufmann's motion)

Summary:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge in a case involving the dissolution of a limited liability company, Highland Property Development, LLC. The plaintiff, William E. Rice, filed a complaint alleging legal malpractice, breach of fiduciary duty, and other claims against the defendants. The defendant, Kristoffer J. Kaufmann, moves for an order instructing the appraisers on the proper methodology for appraisal to determine the fair market value of Rice's interest in the company. The judge denies the motion, finding that the appraisers are already familiar with the relevant laws and regulations and that there is no confusion on their part. The judge also notes that the appraisers will consider the relevant factors, including discounts for Rice's minority interest and the limitations on further disposition of the interest.
