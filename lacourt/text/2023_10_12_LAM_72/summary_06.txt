And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion to consolidate Case No. 23STCV07520 with Case No. 23IWSC00322, captioned Phillip Cotton, et al. v. Emmanuel Ojo, and stay the small claims lawsuit in Dept. 1, Inglewood Courthouse. The motion is unopposed. The judge finds that both cases involve a common question of law or fact, and that the parties are identical and the claims could have been joined. The judge also finds that the plaintiff has substantially complied with the requirements for filing a notice of motion, despite not filing a notice of the instant motion in the Small Claims lawsuit. The judge exercises discretion to overlook this technical problem and grants the motion to consolidate.
