And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is a summary of the Judge's decision regarding a motion to enforce a settlement agreement between the Plaintiffs, Lorenza and Fernando Salvatierra, and the Defendant, Teresa Alvarez. The Plaintiffs are seeking to enforce the settlement agreement, which was entered into on July 26, 2021, and requires the Defendant to pay $31,000 in full settlement of the litigation. The Defendant has paid $18,750 of the settlement amount, leaving a balance of $12,250 outstanding.

The Judge grants the Plaintiffs' motion to enforce the settlement agreement and orders that judgment be entered in favor of the Plaintiffs and against the Defendant in the amount of $12,250. The Judge also notes that the Defendant's inability to make payments due to an injury is not an excuse for breaching the settlement agreement.

The Judge encourages the parties to agree to a payment schedule even after the Court issues a judgment for the full amount. The Judge's decision is based on California Code of Civil Procedure §664.6, which allows a court to enter judgment on a settlement agreement and retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of the settlement.
