And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has ruled that the defendants' motion to seal certain documents in connection with their motion for summary adjudication will be continued to November 16, 2023. The defendants had filed the documents in an unredacted form, which they now want to withdraw from the public record.

The judge has decided that the privacy interests of third-party employees override the public's right of access to certain information, such as compensation information and customer lists. However, the judge has also decided that the defendants' request to seal certain documents is not narrowly tailored and that a less restrictive means to protect the privacy interests of third-party employees is available.

The judge has also ruled that the defendants may redact the names of their employees to protect their privacy interests, but that they may not redact other information unless it is also covered by the requested redactions.

The judge has ordered the defendants to file redacted versions of the documents that they seek to seal by October 26, 2023, and has given the plaintiff until November 2, 2023, to file a brief of no more than five pages if they believe that the defendants have redacted too much material in violation of the current order.

The judge has also ordered the defendants to file a proposed sealing order by October 26, 2023, which makes practical sense for the court and its staff. The judge has concluded that the parties' agreement that certain documents be filed under seal is improper and insufficient, and that a prior court order must be obtained.
