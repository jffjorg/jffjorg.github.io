Legal Standard 
A
demurrer may be made on the grounds that there is a defect or misjoinder of
parties and/or that the pleading not state facts sufficient to constitute a
cause of action. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subds. (d)&(e).) 
When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in
context. In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of
the pleading or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) “A
demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic
matters. Therefore, it lies only where the defects appear on the face of the
pleading or are judicially noticed.” (SKF Farms v. Superior Court (1984)
153 Cal.App.3d 902, 905 [citations omitted].) At the pleading stage, a
plaintiff need only allege ultimate facts sufficient to apprise the defendant
of the factual basis for the claim against him. (Semole v. Sansoucie (1972) 28 Cal. App. 3d 714, 721.) “[A] demurrer
does not, however, admit contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law
alleged in the pleading, or the construction placed on an instrument pleaded
therein, or facts impossible in law, or allegations contrary to facts of which
a court may take judicial knowledge.” (S.
Shore Land Co. v. Petersen (1964) 226 Cal.App.2d 725, 732 [citations
omitted].) 
Discussion
Estate demurs, per Code of Civil Procedure §
430.10, subdivisions (d)&(e), to the first through third causes of action
in Lester and NTSI’s cross-complaint, on the basis that there is a defect or
misjoinder of the parties to the cross-complaint and that the causes of action
therein fail to state facts sufficient to constitute causes of action.
Meet and ConferCross-Complainants’ assertion that counsel
for Estate failed to comply with meet and confer requirements before filing the
instant demurrer (Opp., 3:19-28) is belied by the Declaration of Natalie
Avedisian, specifically the representations found in ¶¶ 3-6 of her declaration.
The court, then, will proceed to address the merits of the demurrer.
Merits
Estate first demurs on the basis of
misjoinder. “An ‘estate’ is not a legal entity and is neither a natural
nor artificial person. It is merely a name to indicate the sum total of the
assets and liabilities of a decedent, or of an incompetent, or of a bankrupt. .
. An ‘estate’ can neither sue nor be sued.” (Bright’s Estate v. Western Air
Lines (1951) 104 Cal.App.2d 827, 828-829; see also Galdjie v. Darwish
(2003) 113 Cal.App.4th 1331, 1344 [“A probate or trust estate is not
a legal entity; it is simply a collection of assets and liabilities. As such,
it has no capacity to sue or be sued, or to defend an action. Any litigation
must be maintained by, or against, the executor or administrator of the estate.”].)
Estate next demurs on the basis that the
indemnification, apportionment of fault and declaratory relief causes of action
fail to state facts sufficient to constitute causes of action. The court
agrees.
“Equitable indemnity is an equitable doctrine
that apportions responsibility among tortfeasors responsible for the same
indivisible injury on a comparative fault basis. . . A right of
equitable indemnity can arise only if the prospective indemnitor and indemnitee
are mutually liable to another person for the same injury.” (Fremont
Reorganizing Corp. v. Faigin (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 1153,
1176-1177 [emphasis added].) “The right of
contribution, although necessarily related to some former transaction or
obligation, exists as an entirely separate contract implied by law. In
situations where two or more parties are jointly liable on an obligation
and one of them makes payment of more than his share, the one paying possesses
a new obligation against the others for their proportion of what he has paid
for them.” (Borba Farms, Inc. v. Acheson (1988) 197 Cal.App.3d 597, 602
[emphasis added].) And, “[t]he object of [the declaratory relief statute] is to
afford a new form of relief where needed and not to furnish a litigant with a
second cause of action for the determination of identical issues.” (California
Ins. Guarantee Assn. v. Superior Court (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 1617, 1624.)
Estate’s demurrer is
sustained on the foregoing grounds.
