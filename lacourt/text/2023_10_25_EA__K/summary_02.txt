And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling sustaining the demurrer to the cross-complaint filed by Christopher David Lester and National Tractor Service, Inc. against The Estate of Mathew Romo. The demurrer was filed on the grounds that the cross-complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute causes of action and that there is a defect or misjoinder of parties to the cross-complaint. The judge has determined that the cross-complaint's causes of action for indemnification, apportionment of fault, and declaratory relief fail to state facts sufficient to constitute causes of action, as they do not meet the legal requirements for these types of claims. The judge has also determined that the cross-complaint's attempts to assert claims against The Estate of Mathew Romo are defective, as an "estate" is not a legal entity and cannot be sued. The case will proceed with the court hearing from counsel for Cross-Complainants as to whether leave to amend the cross-complaint is requested and which causes of action should be pursued.
