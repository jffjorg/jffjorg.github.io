Background   
Plaintiff Kawo
Int’l Inc. (“Plaintiff”) alleges as follows:
On December 30, 2021, Plaintiff,
through Central Dispatch, entered into a written agreement (“Contract”) with
Kings Auto Transportation LLC (“Kings”), whereby Kings agreed to pick up three
vehicles on December 30, 2021 from Little Falls, NJ (i.e., a Lexus LX SUV with
VIN ending in 4010, a Lexus LX SUV with VIN ending in 4373, and a Lexus LX SUV
with VIN ending in 5378; collectively, “Vehicles”), and deliver said Vehicles
to Plaintiff in City of Industry, CA by January 5, 2022, in exchange for
payment of $4,500.00. On January 5, 2022, Kings delivered the Vehicles but they
were all damaged. Progressive County Mutual Insurance Co., Inc. dba Progressive
Insurance (“Progressive”) provided Certificates of Insurance to Kings.
On January 19,
2023, Kings’ default was entered.

A Case
Management Conference and Order to Show Cause Re: Default Judgment are set for
October 25, 2023.
Legal Standard
A demurrer may be made on the grounds that
the pleading, inter alia, does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause
of action. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e).)
When considering
demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in context. In a demurrer
proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via
proper judicial notice. (Donabedian v.
Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) “A demurrer tests the
pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters. Therefore, it
lies only where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are
judicially noticed.” (SKF Farms v. Superior Court (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d
902, 905 [citations omitted].) At the pleading stage, a plaintiff need only
allege ultimate facts sufficient to apprise the defendant of the factual basis
for the claim against him. (Semole v.
Sansoucie (1972) 28 Cal. App. 3d 714, 721.) “[A] demurrer does not,
however, admit contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law alleged in
the pleading, or the construction placed on an instrument pleaded therein, or
facts impossible in law, or allegations contrary to facts of which a court may
take judicial knowledge.” (S. Shore Land
Co. v. Petersen (1964) 226 Cal.App.2d 725, 732 [citations omitted].)
Discussion
Progressive demurs
to the fifth cause of action in Plaintiff’s FAC, on the basis that it fails to
state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.
Progressive contends
that Plaintiff’s fifth cause of action has not been pled with particularity.
The court agrees. “This particularity requirement [applicable to fraud causes
of action] necessitates pleading facts which show how, when, where, to
whom, and by what the representations were tendered.” (Stansfield v. Starkey
(1990) 220 Cal.App.3d 59, 73 [internal quotations and citation omitted;
emphasis theirs].)
Here, Plaintiff has
alleged that Progressive provided a Certificate of Insurance (“COI”) to Kings
(FAC, ¶¶ 3 and 4), that Kings used the COI “to solicit and offer transportation
services to customers like Plaintiff through the dispatch network” (Id.,
¶ 7) and that King and Progressive, “working in concert” with one
another, “wrongfully, fraudulently and illegally denied Plaintiff’s claim for
insurance coverage” after Kings damaged Plaintiff’s vehicles (Id., ¶
31).  
Plaintiff has not
identified any false representation, how it was made, when it was made, who
made it and to whom it was made.
Progressive’s
demurrer to the fifth cause of action is sustained.
