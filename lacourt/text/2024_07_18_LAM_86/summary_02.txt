And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is based on information presented before today. The case concerns a CEQA action and the standing of petitioner Preciado. The Judge finds that Preciado has standing based on a beneficial interest, as they have members who live and work in or near Inglewood where the Project is located. The Judge also notes that Public Resources Code ยง 21177(a) requires that alleged grounds for noncompliance with CEQA be presented to the public agency during the public comment period or before the close of the public hearing on the project. The Judge cites Burrtec Waste Industries, Inc. v. City of Colton (2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 1133, which holds that a property owner, taxpayer, or elector with a geographical nexus (even if attenuated) has standing in a CEQA action.
