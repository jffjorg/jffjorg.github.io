MOTION FOR ORDER NUNC PRO TUNC
 
Date:               7/18/24
(1:30 PM)
Case:                           Estate of Limmie
Jones, Jr. et al. v. Southern California Regional Rail Authority (24STCP00926)
  
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
I.                  
RESPONDENT’S MOTION TO QUASH SERVICE OF PETITION
AND MOTION
 
Respondent Southern California Regional Rail Authority’s
Motion to Quash Service of Petition and Motion is GRANTED IN PART. 
 
As a preliminary matter, respondent Southern California
Regional Rail Authority’s UNOPPOSED requests for judicial notice are GRANTED,
pursuant to Evidence Code § 452(d). (See also Proof of Service attached
to Motion for an Order, Nunc Pro Tunc filed 4/12/24 and
Corrected Proofs of Service re: Motion for an Order, Nunc
Pro Tunc filed 5/2/24.)
 
Respondent Southern California Regional Rail Authority moves
to quash service of the (1) Petition for Order Relieving Petitioners from
Provisions of Government Code Section 945.4 or Otherwise Accepting Petitioners’
Government Claims as Timely (“Petition for Relief”); and (2) Motion for an
Order, Nunc Pro Tunc, That the Petition in This Action Was Filed on March 15,
2024 (“Motion for an Order”).
 
A motion to quash may be granted on the ground that the
court lacks jurisdiction over the respondent. (CCP § 418.10(a)(1).)
“[C]ompliance with the statutory procedures for service of process is essential
to establish personal jurisdiction. [Citation.]” (Dill v. Berquist
Construction Co. (1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 1426, 1444.) “When a [respondent]
challenges [personal] jurisdiction by bringing a motion to quash, the burden is
on the [petitioner] to prove the existence of jurisdiction by proving, inter
alia, the facts requisite to an effective service.” (Id. at 1439-40.)
 
With respect to a petition seeking relief from Government
Code Section 945.4’s provisions, Government Code § 946.6(d) states: “A copy of
the petition and a written notice of the time and place of hearing shall be
served before the hearing as prescribed by subdivision (b) of Section 1005 of
the Code of Civil Procedure on…the clerk or secretary or board of the local
public entity, if the respondent is a local public entity….”
 
Here, with respect to the Petition for Relief, petitioners
have not filed any proof of service of the Petition for Relief. In petitioners’
opposition to the motion to quash, petitioners only address service of the
Motion for Relief. (See 5/24/24 Chaskin Decl. ¶ 10 [“[O]n April 15, 2024
at approximately 10:00 a.m., I arrived at 900 Wilshire Boulevard to serve
METROLINK with Petitioners’ Motions for an Order Nunc Pro Tune that the
Petition in this Action was filed on March 15, 20224 [sic].”]; see also
Chaskin Decl. ¶¶ 11-13; Opp. at 2:26-27 [“In addition, Petitions submit that Defendant
was properly served with Petitioners Motion (See Declaration of Richard
M. Chaskin and supporting exhibits.)”]; RJN Exs. A, B [proofs of service for
Motion for an Order].)
 
Petitioners thus fail to meet their burden to demonstrate
service of the Petition for Relief on “the clerk or secretary or board” of
respondent, as is required by Government Code § 946.6(d). Accordingly, with
respect to service of the Petition for Relief on respondent, the motion is
GRANTED. Service of the Petition for Order Relieving Petitioners from
Provisions of Government Code Section 945.4 or Otherwise Accepting Petitioners’
Government Claims as Timely is hereby QUASHED.
 
With respect to the Motion for an Order, Government Code §
946.6(d), on which respondent relies, only addresses service of a petition for
relief from claim requirement under Government Code § 945.4. Government Code §
946.6(d) is not applicable to the Motion for an Order. Even though the Court
grants the motion to quash with respect to the Petition for Relief, as set
forth above, this does not deprive the Court of jurisdiction to consider the
merits of the Motion for an Order. “Where a [respondent] has not appeared,
service of notice or papers need not be made upon the [respondent].” (CCP §
1014; see Gov. Code § 945.2 [“Except as otherwise provided by law, the rules
of practice in civil actions apply to actions brought against public
entities”].) Because respondent has not appeared, notice of the Motion for an
Order need not have been given to respondent. The motion to quash with respect
to the Motion for an Order, Nunc Pro Tunc, That the Petition in This Action Was
Filed on March 15, 2024 is accordingly DENIED.
 
II.               
PETITIONERS’ MOTION FOR AN ORDER NUNC PRO TUNC
 
On June 7, 2024, the Court jointly heard petitioners’ Motion
for an Order, Nunc Pro Tunc, That the Petition in this Action was Filed on
March 15, 2024 (“Motion for an Order”) and respondent Southern California
Regional Rail Authority aka Metrolink’s Motion to Quash Service of Petition and
Motion. After hearing argument from the parties, the Court continued the motions
and allowed respondent to file and serve a brief addressing the Motion for an Order
by no later than June 27, 2024. The Court also allowed petitioners to file and
serve a reply by no later than July 11, 2024. 
(6/7/24 Minute Order.) 
 
Respondent timely served and filed an opposition on June 27,
2024. The Court notes that, because respondent filed a Motion to Quash Service
of Petition which the Court grants, respondent has not made a general
appearance by filing its opposition to the Motion for an Order while the Motion
to Quash was still pending. (CCP § 418.10(e)(1).) 
 
By contrast, petitioners untimely filed and served their
Reply.  The Court, in its discretion,
declines to consider it.  (See
Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1300(d) [“If the court, in its discretion, refuses
to consider a late filed paper, the minutes or order must so indicate”].)  At bottom, this matter arises because
petitioners admittedly did not timely present a claim to Metrolink, which led
to their filing the underlying Petition for Relief.  (Petition ¶¶ 15-17.)  Petitioners also did not timely file their
Petition for Relief, which in turn led to the instant Motion for an Order deeming
the filing date of the Petition for Relief to fall within the jurisdictional
limitations period.  Notwithstanding the
significance of missing two deadlines and the acute importance of timeliness in
this matter in particular, petitioners nonetheless filed and served their Reply
after the Court-ordered July 11, 2024 deadline. 
The Court’s June 7, 2024 Minute Order, which was served on counsel of
record that same day, was abundantly clear that “[i]f respondent elects to file
such a brief, petitioner may file and serve a Reply by no later than 7/11/24.”
(6/7/24 Minute Order at 1; 6/7/24 Certificate of Mailing.)  Petitioners nonetheless untimely served the
Reply on July 14, 2024 (according to the Proof of Service) and untimely filed
it on July 15, 2024.  While one of
petitioners’ counsel of record submitted with the untimely Reply a declaration
stating that he has been in trial since July 1, 2024 (see 7/14/24
Schtofman Decl. ¶ 1), there is no further explanation for the untimely
filing, including from petitioners’ other counsel of record, Richard M.
Chaskin, who is listed first as counsel on the Reply (and other filings in this
matter).  Even more noticeably absent,
petitioners never sought leave to make the untimely filing. Under such
circumstances, this Court cannot condone or enable petitioners’ repeated—if not
chronic—failures to meet clear deadlines by considering the Reply.
 
Turning to the merits of the Motion for an Order, as a
preliminary matter, the Court GRANTS respondent’s request for judicial notice. (People
v. Snyder (2000) 22 Cal.4th 304, 309 [taking judicial notice of legislative
history material].)  For the reasons that
follow, the Motion for an Order is DENIED.
 
On Friday, March 15, 2024, petitioners electronically submitted
the following documents for filing: (1) Petition for Order Relieving
Petitioners from Provisions of Government Code Section 945.4 or Otherwise
Accepting Petitioners’ Government Claims as Timely and (2) Declaration of
Attorney Richard M. Chaskin in Support of Petition for Order Relieving
Petitioners from Provisions of Government Code Section 945.4 or Otherwise
Accepting Petitioners’ Government Claims as Timely. (4/11/23 Chaskin Decl. ¶ 6;
4/11/23 Shtofman Decl. ¶ 3; Exs. 1, 2.) Petitioners obtained a “New Case
Receipt” indicating that the two documents were “Filed to Court Successfully”
on March 15, 2024 at 12:22 a.m. (4/11/23 Chaskin Decl. ¶¶ 7, 8; 4/11/23 Shtofman
Decl. ¶¶ 4-6; Ex. 3.) 
 
The clerk’s office later rejected the filing of the two
documents. (4/11/23 Chaskin Decl. ¶¶ 10, 11; 4/11/23 Shtofman Decl. ¶¶ 8, 9;
Exs. 4-7.) The reason given on the Notice of Court Rejection of Electronic
Filing was “Unable to file the Petition without the required mandatory form
‘Civil Case Coversheet Addendum and Statement of Location’.” (4/11/23 Chaskin
Decl. ¶ 10; 4/11/23 Shtofman Decl. ¶ 8; Ex. 4.) Although the notice of
rejection indicated that it was generated at 7:53 a.m. on March 15, 2024 (Ex. 4),
the notice was not sent to petitioners until 4:30 p.m. (4/11/23 Chaskin Decl. ¶
12; 4/11/23 Shtofman Decl. ¶ 10.) On March 18, 2024, the next court day,
petitioners attempted to have the documents filed as of March 15, 2024. (4/11/23
Shtofman Decl. ¶ 12.) The clerk refused, explaining that once the documents are
filed, petitioners could seek an order nunc pro tunc to deem the documents
filed as of March 15, 2024. (4/11/23 Shtofman Decl. ¶ 12.) Petitioners re-filed
the documents on March 21, 2024 with the civil case cover sheet addendum. (4/11/23
Chaskin Decl. ¶ 17; 4/11/23 Shtofman Decl. ¶ 13; Exs. 8-10.)
 
On April 12, 2024, petitioners filed the instant Motion for
an Order seeking to deem the filing date of the Petition for Relief to be March
15, 2024. 
 
Petitioners rely on Carlson v. State of California
Department of Fish & Game (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 1268 for the assertion
that the clerk’s office could not reject the petition for lack of a civil case
cover sheet. In Carlson, the clerk refused to file a complaint because
the complaint was not accompanied by a Certificate of Assignment required by
local rule. (Carlson, 68 Cal.App.4th at 1271.) The Court of
Appeal found that the clerk was not authorized under state law to reject the
filing: “[T]he local Superior Court may not condition the filing of a complaint
on local rule requirements. Instead, so long as a complaint complies with state
requirements, the clerk has a ministerial duty to file. In legal effect, a
complaint is ‘filed’ when it is presented to the clerk for filing in the form
required by state law.” (Carlson, 68 Cal.App.4th at 1270.) 
 
After Carlson, however, the Legislature enacted CCP §
1010.6, which allows for electronic filing of documents. CCP § 1010.6(e) permits
trial courts to adopt local rules permitting electronic filing so long as they do
not conflict with conditions imposed under state law. (See CCP § 1010.6(e)
[“A trial court may adopt local rules permitting electronic filing of
documents, subject to rules adopted by the Judicial Council pursuant to
subdivision (h) and the following conditions….”].) As pertinent here, CCP §
1010.6(e)(4)(E) states:
 
“If the clerk of the court does not
file a complaint or cross complaint because the complaint or cross complaint
does not comply with applicable filing requirements or the required filing fee
has not been paid, any statute of limitations applicable to the causes of
action alleged in the complaint or cross complaint shall be tolled for the
period beginning on the date on which the court received the document and as
shown on the confirmation of receipt described in subparagraph (A), through the
later of either the date on which the clerk of the court sent the notice of
rejection described in subparagraph (C) or the date on which the electronic
filing service provider or electronic filing manager sent the notice of
rejection as described in subparagraph (D), plus one additional day if the
complaint or cross complaint is subsequently submitted in a form that corrects
the errors which caused the document to be rejected.”
 
The language of CCP § 1010.6(e)(4)(E) clearly contemplates that
the clerk’s office is empowered to “not file a complaint” when the complaint “does
not comply with applicable filing requirements.” 
 
With respect to applicable filing requirements, Rule of
Court 2.556 requires electronic filers to “[f]urnish information the court
requires for case processing.” (CRC 2.556(a)(2).) In Los Angeles County, under
Local Rule 2.3(a)(1)(E), all new filings in civil proceedings must be
accompanied by a LACIV 109 Civil Case Cover Sheet Addendum and Statement of
Location. 
 
Because CCP § 1010.6(e) allows trial courts to adopt local
rules such as Local Rule 2.3(a)(1)(E), and because CCP § 1010.6(e)(4)(E) allows
trial courts to not file new filings in civil proceedings, the clerk in this
matter was entitled to reject the filing of petitioners’ Petition for Relief. 
 
In addition, where the clerk’s office has not filed a few
civil filing, neither CCP § 1010.6(e) nor § 1010.6(e)(4)(E) allow for the
backdating of such filings after they are filed in accordance with applicable
filing requirements. Instead, under CCP § 1010.6(e)(4)(E), if the clerk’s
office rejects a filing for lack of compliance with filing requirements, any
statute of limitations is tolled for one additional day to allow the petitioner
to correct the error that caused the filing to be rejected. Here, because the
clerk’s office sent the notice of rejection on March 15, 2024 (4/11/23 Chaskin
Decl. ¶ 10; 4/11/23 Shtofman Decl. ¶ 10 & Ex. 4), petitioners had
until March 18, 2024 (i.e., the next court day) to file a new petition
with the required LACIV 109 form and comply with any statute of limitations.
Petitioners did not file a new petition with the required document until March
21, 2024. (4/11/23 Chaskin Decl. ¶ 17; 4/11/23 Shtofman Decl. ¶ 13; Exs.
8-10.)
 
Petitioners also rely on Rule of Court 3.220 for the
assertion that a clerk cannot refuse to file a party’s first paper for failure
to file a civil case cover sheet. (CRC 3.220(c) [“If a party that is required
to provide a cover sheet under this rule or a similar local rule fails to do so
or provides a defective or incomplete cover sheet at the time the party’s first
paper is submitted for filing, the clerk of the court must file the paper”].) “The
Judicial Council added subdivision (c) to former rule 982.2 (subsequently
renumbered as 3.220) effective January 2002 to address . . . ‘the refusal of
some clerks to file an initial pleading because it is not accompanied by a
cover sheet or the sheet is somehow defective.’” (Mito v. Temple Recycling
Center Corp. (2010) 187 Cal.App.4th 276, 280.)
 
To begin with, insofar as Rule of Court 3.220 may even be
read as contrary to CCP § 1010.6(e)(4)(E)’s provisions, it must give way
to the provision of the CCP.  (Trans-Action
Commercial Investors, Ltd. v. Jelinek (1997) 60 Cal.App.4th 352, 364-65 [“The
Legislature’s primary constitutional authority to provide the rules governing
judicial procedure necessarily controls over the Judicial Council’s secondary
rulemaking authority”].)  In any event,
here, 
The filing requirement at issue did not concern the civil
case cover sheet prescribed by the Judicial Council (Form CM-010), but a LACIV
109 Civil Case Cover Sheet Addendum and Statement of Location.  As discussed above, CCP § 1010.6(e) allows
for the Los Angeles County Superior Court to require the filing of an LACIV 109,
and CCP § 1010.6(e)(4)(E) allows for the court to not file a new matter when the
required form is missing.  Rule of Court
3.220 is therefore inapposite, and  petitioners’
remedy under the circumstances was to file their petition with the LACIV 109
form on the next court day in accordance with CCP § 1010.6(e)(4)(E).  They did not do so.
 
For the foregoing reasons, petitioners Estate of Limmie
Jones, Jr., Latanuza Jones, Willie Richey, and Brian Hagen’s Motion for an
Order Nunc Pro Tunc that the Petition in this Action was Filed on March 15,
2024 is DENIED.
