[1]           The CEQA Guidelines appear at Cal.
Code Regs., tit. 14, §§ 15000, et seq.


[2]           Although petitioner need not
demonstrate a beneficial interest, petitioner has members who live and/or work
in or near Inglewood where the Project is located. (Preciado Decl. ¶ 3.)
Petitioner and its members would be adversely affected if no EIR were ordered.
(Preciado Decl. ¶¶ 5, 6.) This would appear sufficient for standing based on a
beneficial interest. (See Burrtec Waste Industries, Inc. v. City of Colton
(2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 1133, 1137 [in CEQA action, property owner, taxpayer, or
elector who establishes a geographical nexus, even if such nexus is attenuated,
has standing].)
 


[3]           Public Resources Code § 21177(a) states:
“An action or proceeding shall not be brought pursuant to Section 21167 unless
the alleged grounds for noncompliance with this division were presented to the
public agency orally or in writing by any person during the public comment
period provided by this division or before the close of the public hearing on
the project before the issuance of the notice of determination.”
