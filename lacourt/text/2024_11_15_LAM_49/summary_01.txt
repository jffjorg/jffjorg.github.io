And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion for summary judgment and alternative motion for summary adjudication. The defendants argued that the plaintiff's claims should be dismissed because she concealed her criminal history and that MTM, the employer, was not an "employer" under the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA) because it had fewer than five employees. The judge found that these arguments were not persuasive and that the plaintiff's claims had merit.

The judge also denied the defendants' motion for summary adjudication of the plaintiff's harassment claims, finding that the evidence presented was sufficient to raise a triable issue of material fact. The judge noted that the plaintiff had established a prima facie case of retaliation under Labor Code section 1102.5 and that the defendants had provided a legitimate, nonretaliatory explanation for the plaintiff's demotion and termination.

The judge's tentative ruling is subject to change and will be finalized after the parties have an opportunity to respond and the judge has reviewed the responses.
