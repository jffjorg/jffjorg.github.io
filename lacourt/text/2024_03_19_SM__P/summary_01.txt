And here is the English-text summary:

In a tentative ruling, the court has granted Yadegar's motion for the defendants to pay arbitration costs or to lift the stay and set trial. The plaintiff sued her prior attorney and the court granted arbitration in March 2022. Yadegar's income is below the state and federal poverty levels, and she would be unable to pay the $25,000 cost of arbitration. The court has offered the defendants the choice given in Roldan v. Callahan & Blaine (2013): either they can pay Yadegar's share of the arbitration cost and remain in arbitration, or waive the right to arbitrate and allow the matter to be litigated in court. The court will give the defendants 10 court days to make their election.
