COURT’S
  [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: 
Motion to Compel Arbitration 
 
                        



 
[THE FOLLOWING IS A TENTATIVE RULING IN THE ABOVE CASE]: 
Defendant Hyundai Motor America moves to compel
arbitration of all claims brought by plaintiffs Ingrid Guzman and Edwin
Hernandez. This court grants the motion to compel arbitration and stays all
proceedings pending the outcome of arbitration. This court grants plaintiffs’
request for judicial notice.
 
I.
BACKGROUND
On
January 2, 2022, plaintiffs Ingrid Guzman (“Guzman”) and Edwin Hernandez
(“Hernandez” and, together with Guzman, “Plaintiffs”) purchased a certain 2022
Hyunda Tucson (the “Vehicle”) manufactured by defendant Hyundai Motor America
(“Defendant”). (Complaint ¶ 8.) To do so, Plaintiffs and the non-party
seller executed a Retail Installment Sales Contract (the “Sales Contract”),
which includes an arbitration provision (the “Sales Contract Arbitration
Provision”). (Id. at p. 1.) The Sales Contract Arbitration Provision provides,
in relevant part,
 
Any
claim or dispute, whether in contract, tort, statute or otherwise (including
the interpretation and scope of this Arbitration Provision, and the
arbitrability of the claim or dispute), between you and us or our employees,
agents, successors or assigns, which arises out of or relates to your credit
application, purchase or condition of this vehicle, this contract or any
resulting transaction or relationship (including any such relationship with
third parties who do not sign this contract) shall, at your or our election, be
resolved by neutral, binding arbitration and not by a court action…. Any
arbitration under this Arbitration Provision shall be governed by the Federal
Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. § 1 et. seq.) and not by any state law concerning
arbitration.
 
(Id.
at p. 5.)
 
The
Vehicle came with Defendant’s New Vehicle Limited Warranty (the “Warranty”),
which includes an arbitration provision (the “Warranty Arbitration Provision”
and, together the with Sales Contract Arbitration Provision, the “Arbitration
Provisions”). (Complaint p. 2.) The Warranty Arbitration Provision provides, in
relevant part,
 
If
you purchased or leased your Hyundai vehicle in the State of California, you
and we, Hyundai Motor America, each agree that any claim or disputes between us
(including between you and any of our affiliated companies) related to or
arising out of your vehicle purchase, advertising for the vehicle, use of your
vehicle, the performance of the vehicle, and service relating to the vehicle,
the vehicle warranty, representations in the warranty, or duties contemplated
under the warranty, including without limitation claims relate to false or
misleading advertising, unfair competition, breach of contract or warranty, the
failure to conform a vehicle to warranty, failure to repurchase or replace your
vehicle, or claims for a refund or partial refund of your vehicle’s purchase
price (excluding personal injury claims), but excluding claims brought under
the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act, shall be resolved by binding arbitration at
either your or our election, even if the claim is initially filed in a court of
law…. This agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce and
shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16.
 
(Id.
at p. 3.)
 
On
February 28, 2024, Plaintiffs initiated this action by filing a complaint (the
“Complaint”) alleging causes of action for (1) violation of the Song-Beverly
Consumer Warranty Act—breach of express warranty, (2) violation of the
Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act—breach of implied warranty, and (3)
violation of the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act Section 1793.2.
 
On
May 30, 2024, Defendant filed the instant motion to compel arbitration (the
“Motion”). On July 1, 2024, Plaintiffs filed an opposition (the “Opposition”)
to the Motion, to which Defendant replied on July 8, 2024.
 
II.
PROCEDURAL MATTERS 
 
A.  
Timeliness of Filings 
 
Per
California Code of Civil Procedure §¿1005, subdivision (b), moving papers
should be filed at least 16 court days before they are set for hearing,
oppositions thereto should be filed at least nine court days before the set
hearing, and replies to any oppositions should be filed at least five court
days before the set hearing. 
 
We
are satisfied that all filings made in connection with the Motion are timely.
 
B.  
Page Limits
 
Per
California Rules of Court rule 3.1113(d), “no opening or responding memorandum
may exceed 15 pages,” which limit “does not include the caption page, the
notice of motion and motion, exhibits, declarations, attachments, the table of
contents, the table of authorities, or the proof of service” and “[n]o reply or
closing memorandum may exceed 10 pages.”
 
Defendant’s
reply to the Opposition is 12 pages in length and therefore exceeds the page
limit imposed by California Rules of Court rule 3.1113(d) for reply or closing
memorandum. Although we do not decline to consider any part of the reply on
this ground, we remind Defendant of the existence of this rule and the
importance of abiding by the California Rules of Court.
 
C.  
Plaintiffs’ Requests for Judicial Notice 
 
“Judicial¿notice¿is
the recognition and acceptance by the court, for use by the trier of fact or by
the court, of the existence of a matter of law or fact that is relevant to an
issue in the action without requiring formal proof of the matter.” (Unruh-Haxton
v. Regents of University of California¿(2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 343, 364.)
“Judicial¿notice¿may not be taken of any matter unless authorized or required
by law.” (Cal. Evid. C. §¿450.) Matters subject to¿judicial¿notice¿are listed
in California Evidence Code §§¿451–452. (Fremont Indemnity Co. v. Fremont
General Corp.¿(2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97, 113.) “The underlying theory
of¿judicial¿notice¿is that the matter being¿judicially¿noticed¿is a law or fact
that is¿not reasonably subject to dispute.”¿(Lockley v. Law
Office of Cantrell, Green, Pekich, Cruz & McCort¿(2001) 91 Cal.App.4th
875, 882 (emphasis original).) “Although the¿existence¿of a document may
be¿judicially¿noticeable, the truth of statements contained in the document and
its proper interpretation are not subject to¿judicial¿notice¿if those matters
are reasonably disputable.” (Fremont Indemnity Co. v. Fremont General Corp.,¿supra,
113 (emphasis original);¿Tenet Healthsystem Desert, Inc. v. Blue Cross of
California¿(2016) 245 Cal.App.4th 821, 836.) 
 
Plaintiffs’
request that this court take judicial notice of two opinions by the Court of
Appeals and one opinion by the Ninth Circuit Court. Plaintiffs attach to their
request copies of the opinions of which they seek judicial notice. Under
California Evidence Code section 452, subdivision (d), it is permissible for
this court to take judicial notice of such opinions.
 
Accordingly,
this court GRANTS Plaintiffs’ requests for judicial notice.
 
III.
DISCUSSION 
 
Under
both the Federal Arbitration Act and California law, arbitration agreements are
valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, except on such grounds that exist at law
or equity for voiding a contract. (Winter v. Window Fashions Professions,
Inc. (2008) 166 Cal.App.4th 943, 947.) The right to arbitration depends
upon contract; a petition to compel arbitration is simply a suit in equity
seeking specific performance of that contract. (Marcus & Millichap Real
Estate Inv. Brokerage Co. v. Hock Inv. Co. (1998) 68 Cal. App.4th 83, 88.)
The petitioner bears the burden of proving the existence of a valid arbitration
agreement by the preponderance of the evidence, the party opposing the petition
then bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence any fact
necessary to demonstrate that there should be no enforcement of the agreement,
and the trial court sits as a trier of fact to reach a final determination on
the issue. (Rosenthal v. Great Western Financial Securities Corp. (1996)
14 Cal.4th 394, 413; Provencio v. WMA Securities, Inc., 125 Cal.App.4th
1028, 1031.) “In determining whether an¿arbitration¿agreement applies to a
specific dispute, the court may examine only the agreement itself and the
complaint filed by the party refusing¿arbitration.” (Weeks v. Crow¿(1980)
113 Cal.App.3d 350, 353.)¿¿ 
¿ 
This
court is empowered by California Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.2 to
compel parties to arbitrate disputes pursuant to an agreement to do so. “The
court shall order the petitioner and the respondent to arbitrate the
controversy if it determines that an agreement to arbitrate the controversy
exists….” (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §¿1281.2.) Thus, “Section 1281.2 requires a
court to order arbitration if it determines that an agreement to arbitrate
exists.” (Ruiz v. Moss Bros. Auto Group, Inc. (2014) 232 Cal.App.4th
836, 841.)¿¿ 
¿¿ 
California
law incorporates many of the basic policy objectives contained in the Federal
Arbitration Act, including a presumption in favor of arbitrability. (Engalla
v. Permanente Medical Group, Inc. (1997) 15 Cal.4th 951, 971–72.) “This
strong policy has resulted in the general rule that arbitration should be
upheld unless it can be said with assurance that an arbitration clause is not
susceptible to an interpretation covering the asserted dispute.” (Coast
Plaza Doctors Hospital v. Blue Cross of California (2000) 83 Cal.App.4th
677, 686.) Notwithstanding that strong policy, the United States Supreme Court
has held, “[A]rbitration is a matter of contract and a party cannot be required
to submit to arbitration any dispute which he has not agreed so to submit.” (AT
& T Technologies, Inc. v. Communications Workers of America (1986)
475 U.S. 643, 648.)
 
The
hearing and determination of a petition to compel arbitration “in the manner
and upon the notice provided by law for the hearing of motions” generally means
that “the facts are to be proven by affidavit or declaration and documentary
evidence with oral testimony taken only in the court's discretion.” (Sonic-Calabasas
A, Inc. v. Moreno (2013) 57 Cal.4th 1109, 1157.)
 
A.  
Defendant’s Standing to Enforce the Arbitration
Provisions
 
1.   
The Warranty Arbitration Provision
 
Arbitration
provisions in warranty booklets do not constitute the consumer’s assent to the
arbitration provisions and are thus unenforceable. (See Norcia v. Samsung
Telecommunications Am., LLC (2017) 845 F.3d 1279, 1285, 1288 [stating that
“language in a written warranty agreement is ‘contractual’ in the sense that it
creates binding, legal obligations on the seller… but a warranty does not
impose binding obligations on the buyer], internal citations
omitted.)   
 
“A
party may be estopped from asserting that the lack of his signature on a
written contract precludes enforcement of the contract's arbitration clause
when he has consistently maintained that other provisions of the same contract
should be enforced to benefit him. A nonsignatory is estopped from refusing to
comply with an arbitration clause when it receives a ‘direct benefit’ from a
contract containing an arbitration clause.” (Boucher v. Alliance Title Co.,
Inc. (2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 262, 269.) “[A] plaintiff who relies on the
contractual terms in a claim against a nonsignatory may be precluded from
repudiating the arbitration clause in the contract.” (JSM Tuscany, LLC v.
Superior Court (2011) 193 Cal.App.4th 1222, 1237.)
 
Per
the terms of the Warranty Arbitration Provision, because Plaintiffs purchased
the Vehicle in California, they agreed to the terms of the Warranty Arbitration
Provision and it may be enforced against them by Defendant. But, like in Norcia
v. Samsung Telecommunications Am., LLC, supra, 845 F.3d 1279 at
1285, 1288, the Warranty Arbitration Provision, being contained in a warranty
booklet, cannot impose binging obligations on the consumers, Plaintiffs.
 
However,
Plaintiffs’ cause of action for breach of an express warranty relies on the
Warranty to derive a direct benefit and impose liability on Defendant. Thus,
following Boucher v. Alliance Title Co., Inc., supra, 127
Cal.App.4th 262 at 269, Plaintiffs are estopped from repudiating the Warranty
Arbitration Provision while relying on other provisions of the Warranty to
bring their claims.
 
Thus,
we find that Defendant has standing to compel arbitration under the Warranty
Arbitration Provision.
 
2.   
The Sales Contract Arbitration Provision
 
Defendant
argues that it may enforce the Sales Contract Arbitration Provision under the
doctrine of equitable estoppel. (Motion p. 13.)
 
“The
doctrine of¿equitable¿estoppel¿is an exception to the general rule that a
nonsignatory to an agreement cannot be¿compelled¿to¿arbitrate¿and cannot invoke
an agreement to¿arbitrate, without being a party to the¿arbitration¿agreement.
Under that doctrine, as applied in both federal and California decisional
authority, a nonsignatory defendant may invoke an¿arbitration¿clause
to¿compel¿a signatory plaintiff to¿arbitrate¿its claims when the causes of
action against the nonsignatory are ‘intimately founded in and intertwined’
with the underlying contract obligations. By relying on contract terms in a
claim against a nonsignatory defendant, even if not exclusively, a plaintiff
may be¿equitably¿estopped¿from repudiating the arbitration clause contained in
that agreement.” (Kielar v. Superior Court (2023) 94 Cal.App.5th 614,
619, internal quotation marks omitted.) “Merely ‘making reference to’ an
agreement with an arbitration clause is not enough. The plaintiff's actual
dependence on the underlying contract in making out the claim against the
nonsignatory is always the sine qua non of an appropriate situation for
applying equitable estoppel. Even if a plaintiff's claims ‘touch matters’
relating to the arbitration¿agreement, the claims are not arbitrable unless the
plaintiff relies on the agreement to establish its cause of action. ‘But-for
causation” alone is insufficient.” (Ibid.) 
 
In
Kielar v. Superior Court (2023) 94 Cal.App.5th 614, 620–21 (hereafter, Kielar),
the plaintiff brought a cause of action for breach of express and implied
warranties under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act, but the express
warranty “was not part of his sales contract with the dealership. Indeed, the
sales contract acknowledges this separate warranty and disclaims any implied
warranties by the dealership.” On the basis that “manufacturer vehicle
warranties that accompany the sale of motor vehicles without regard to the
terms of the sale contract between the¿purchaser and the dealer are independent
of the sale contract,” the court in Kielar found that “a manufacturers’
express or implied¿warranties¿that accompany a vehicle at the time of sale” do
not “constitute obligations arising from the sale contract, permitting
manufacturers to enforce an¿arbitration¿agreement in the contract pursuant
to¿equitable¿estoppel.” (Ibid.) 
 
Defendant
may not invoke the doctrine of equitable estoppel to enforce the Sales Contract
Arbitration Agreement. The causes of action brought by Plaintiffs all allege
violations of the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act and relate to Defendant’s
statutorily imposed warranty and repair obligations; they are not brought to
enforce the Sales Contract or relate to any terms of or the financing provided
by the Sales Contract. Thus, we find that Plaintiffs’ claims are not intimately
founded in and intertwined the Sales Contract. Additionally, Plaintiffs do not
rely on any contract term of the Sales Contract to bring their claims and their
claims do not depend on the Sales Contract. And, as the court in Kielar
found, Defendant’s express and implied warranties that accompanied the Vehicle
at the time it was purchased do not constitute obligations arising from the
Sales Contract, which would permit Defendant to enforce the Sales Contract
Arbitration Clause pursuant to equitable estoppel.  
 
Thus,
we find that Defendant does not have standing to compel arbitration under the
Sales Contract Arbitration Provision.
 
B.  
Unconscionability
 
The
doctrine of unconscionability applies to arbitration agreements. (Peng v.
First Republic Bank (2013) 219 Cal.App.4th 1462, 1469.) Civil Code section
1670.5, subdivision (a)¿provides, “If the court as a matter of law finds the
contract or any clause of the contract to have been unconscionable at the time
it was made the court may refuse to enforce the contract.”  
 
“The
general principles of unconscionability are well established. A
contract is unconscionable if one of the parties lacked a meaningful
choice in deciding whether to agree and the contract contains terms that are
unreasonably favorable to the other party.” (OTO, L.L.C. v. Kho (2019) 8
Cal.5th 111, 125.) “Unconscionability has both a ‘procedural’ and a
‘substantive’ element, the former focusing on ‘oppression’ or ‘surprise’ due to
unequal bargaining power, the latter on ‘overly harsh’ or ‘one-sided’ results.
The prevailing view is that procedural and substantive unconscionability must¿both¿be
present in order for a court to exercise its discretion to refuse to enforce a
contract or clause under the doctrine of unconscionability. But they need not
be present in the same degree. The more substantively oppressive the contract
term, the less evidence of procedural unconscionability is required to come to
the conclusion that the term is unenforceable, and vice versa.” (Peng v.
First Republic Bank, supra, at 1469, internal citations omitted,
emphasis original.) “The ultimate issue in every case is whether the terms of
the contract are sufficiently unfair, in view of all relevant circumstances,
that a court should withhold enforcement.” (Sanchez v. Valencia Holding Co.,
LLC (2015) 61 Cal.4th 899, 912.)
 
1.   
Procedural Unconscionability
 
“Procedural unconscionability focuses
on ‘oppression’ or ‘surprise’ due to unequal bargaining power. Oppression
arises from an inequality of bargaining power that results in no real
negotiation and an absence of meaningful choice. Surprise involves
the extent to which the supposedly agreed-upon terms are hidden in a prolix
printed form drafted by the party seeking to enforce them.” (Davis v. Kozak
(2020) 53 Cal.App.5th 897, 906.) “Ordinary¿contracts¿of¿adhesion, although they
are indispensable facts of modern life that are generally enforced, contain a
degree of procedural¿unconscionability even without any notable surprises,
and bear within them the clear danger of oppression and overreaching.” (Baltazar
v. Forever 21, Inc. (2016) 62 Cal.4th 1237, 1244.)
 
Plaintiffs
submit with the Opposition a sworn declaration by Hernandez (the “Hernandez
Declaration”) that describes the Sales Contract being quickly presented to him
for signature as a non-negotiable requirement before Plaintiffs’ purchase of
the Vehicle. (Hernandez Decl. ¶ 4.) The Hernandez Declaration states that
Hernandez was inadequately informed by the seller of the Vehicle about the
Sales Contract Arbitration Agreement, and states, “[b]elieving that I had no
other options, nor additional time to fully understand the [Sales Contract’s]
terms in their entirety, or at least to seek counsel, I signed each portion of
the [Sales Contract].” (Id. at ¶ 5.) He states that he only became aware
of the Warranty Arbitration Agreement when the Motion was filed. (Id. at
¶ 6.) Plaintiffs also submit with the Opposition a sworn declaration by
Guzman (the “Guzman Declaration”) that contains the same statements as the
Hernandez Declaration. Plaintiffs attach to each of the Hernandez Declaration
and the Guzman Declaration a copy of the Sales Contract. (Id. at Exh. A.)
 
Defendant
does not dispute that the Sales Contract is an adhesion contract.
 
We
agree with Plaintiffs that the Sales Contract is an adhesion contract, and,
based on the sworn statements in the Hernandez Declaration and the Guzman
Declaration, believe that Plaintiffs were not afforded an opportunity to fully
understand or consult counsel about the contents of the Sales Contract before
signing it. We therefore find some amount of procedural unconscionability in
the Sales Contract Arbitration Agreement.
 
The
Hernandez Declaration and the Guzman Declaration each states that the warranty
booklet containing the Warranty Arbitration Agreement is 50 pages long and that
neither Plaintiff “was never given notice by either [the seller of the Vehicle]
or [Defendant] that a subsequent enforceable Arbitration Provision existed
inside a Warranty Booklet that was sent to me around the time the [Vehicle] was
delivered to me,” and that he was consequently “completely oblivious” to the
Warranty Arbitration Provision “buried” in the warranty booklet’s 50 pages.
(Hernandez Decl. ¶ 6; Guzman Decl. ¶ 6.)
 
Also
based on the sworn statements of the Hernandez Declaration and the Guzman
Declaration, we also find some procedural unconscionability in the Warranty
Arbitration Agreement. We find that putting the Warranty Arbitration Agreement
within the lengthy warranty booklet without calling attention to the Warranty
Arbitration Agreement results in some surprise to Plaintiffs that it exists and
as to its terms.
 
Thus,
we find some procedural unconscionability in both the Sales Contract
Arbitration Agreement and in the Warranty Arbitration Agreement. Consequently,
we proceed with our analysis by looking for substantive unconscionability in
the Arbitration Agreements.
 
2.   
Substantive Unconscionability
 
“Substantive unconscionability examines
the fairness of a contract's terms. This analysis ensures that contracts,
particularly contracts of adhesion, do not impose terms that have been
variously described as  ‘overly harsh,’
‘unduly oppressive,’ ‘so one-sided as to “shock the conscience,”’ or
‘unfairly one-sided.’ All of these formulations point to the central idea that
the unconscionability doctrine is concerned not with ‘a simple old-fashioned
bad bargain,’ but with terms that are ‘unreasonably favorable to the more
powerful party.’ Unconscionable terms ‘impair the integrity of the
bargaining process or otherwise contravene the public interest or public
policy’ or attempt to impermissibly alter fundamental legal duties. They
may include fine-print terms, unreasonably or unexpectedly harsh terms
regarding price or other central aspects of the transaction, and terms that
undermine the nondrafting party's reasonable expectations. These examples are
illustrative, not exhaustive.” (OTO, L.L.C. v. Kho, supra, 8 Cal.5th
111 at 129–30.)
 
 “The principle that an arbitration agreement
may not limit statutorily imposed remedies… appears to be undisputed.” (Armendariz v. Foundation Health Psychcare
Services, Inc. (2000) 24
Cal.4th 83, 103.) An agreement cannot waive non-waivable statutory rights
because statutes enacted for the public benefit and to enforce public policy
are unwaivable as a matter of law. (Id. at p. 100.) “Where… arbitration
provisions undermine statutory protections, courts have readily found
unconscionability.” (Samaniego v. Empire
Today LLC (2012) 205 Cal.App.4th 1138, 1147, citing Nyulassy v. Lockheed Martin Corp. (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 1267, 1283; Martinez v. Master Protection Corp. (2004) 118 Cal.App.4th 107,
117; Wherry v. Award, Inc. (2011) 192
Cal.App.4th 1242, 1249.) Thus, for example, it “is indisputable that an
employment contract that required employees to waive their rights under the
FEHA to redress… harassment and discrimination would be contrary to public
policy and unlawful.” (Armendariz v.
Foundation Health Psychcare Services, Inc., supra, at pp. 100–01.) The court in Armendariz v. Foundation Health Psychcare
Services, Inc., supra, at p. 90 concluded that employee antidiscrimination claims
brought under FEHA “are in fact arbitrable if the
arbitration permits an employee to vindicate his or her statutory rights.”
(Emphasis original.) The court determined that “in order for such
vindication to occur, the arbitration must meet certain minimum requirements,
including neutrality of the arbitrator, the provision of adequate discovery, a
written decision that will permit a limited form of judicial review, and
limitations on the costs of arbitration.” (Id. at pp. 90–91.)
 
Plaintiffs
do not argue in the Opposition for the existence of any substantive
unconscionability in either of the Arbitration Agreements. Rather, Plaintiffs
merely repeat their arguments for procedural unconscionability. (Opposition p.
12.) This, without more, is insufficient. (See Peng v. First Republic Bank,
supra, 219 Cal.App.4th 1462 at 1469 [some degree of both
procedural and substantive unconscionability is required for an arbitration
agreement to be unenforceable due to unconscionability].)
 
This
court independently reviews the Arbitration Agreements for substantive
unconscionability and considers whether the Arbitration Agreements limit
Plaintiffs’ statutory rights. 
 
The
Sales Contract provides for mutually enforceable mandatory neutral binding
arbitration of disputes, payment of certain of Plaintiffs’ fees by Defendant up
to $5,000, and a final decision in writing that is subject to a limited right
to appeal under the FAA. (Hernandez Decl. Exh. A; Guzman Decl. Exh. A.) We
therefore find that, as described in Armendariz
v. Foundation Health Psychcare Services, Inc., supra, 24 Cal.4th 83 at pp .90–91, the
Sales Contract Arbitration Agreement permits Plaintiffs to vindicate their
statutory rights under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act through
arbitration.
 
The
Warranty Arbitration Agreement similarly provides for mutually enforceable
mandatory minding arbitration of disputes, the payment by Defendant of all fees
except Plaintiffs’ initial filing fee, and a final decision in writing that is
subject to a limited right to appeal under the FAA. (Willette Decl., Exh. A.)
We therefore similarly find that, as described in Armendariz v. Foundation Health Psychcare Services, Inc., supra, 24 Cal.4th 83 at pp .90–91, the
Warranty Arbitration Agreement permits Plaintiffs to vindicate their statutory
rights under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act through arbitration.
 
We
fail to find any indicators of substantive unconscionability in either of the
Arbitration Agreements. Consequently, the Arbitration Agreements cannot be held
to be unenforceable on the grounds of unconscionability. 
 
C.  
Stay of Proceedings
 
California
Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.4 provides, in relevant part, “[i]f a
court of competent jurisdiction, whether in this State or not, has ordered
arbitration of a controversy which is an issue involved in an action or
proceeding pending before a court of this State, the court in which such action
or proceeding is pending shall, upon motion of a party to such action or
proceeding, stay the action or proceeding until an arbitration is had in
accordance with the order to arbitrate or until such earlier time as the court
specifies.”¿“In accordance with choice-of-law principles, the parties may limit
the trial court's authority to stay or deny arbitration under the CAA by
adopting the more restrictive procedural provisions of the FAA.” (Valencia
v. Smyth (2010) 185 Cal.App.4th 153, 157.) “Absent such an express
designation, however, the FAA's procedural provisions do not apply in state
court.” (Id. at 174.)  
 
The
Warranty Arbitration Agreement specifies that the FAA shall govern any
arbitration under the Warranty Arbitration Agreement, but it does not specify
that the FAA’s procedural provisions should apply to a motion to stay or deny
arbitration. Thus, this being a state court, the CAA applies. Following
California Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.4, this action should therefore
be stayed pending the outcome of arbitration. 
 
D.  
Conclusion
 
This
court finds that Defendant has standing to enforce the Warranty Arbitration
Agreement but not the Sales Contract Arbitration Agreement. This court
additionally finds that neither of the Arbitration Agreements are
unconscionable because, although both contain some procedural
unconscionability, neither is substantively unconscionable. 
 
Accordingly,
this court GRANTS the Motion and STAYS all proceedings pending the outcome of
arbitration.
