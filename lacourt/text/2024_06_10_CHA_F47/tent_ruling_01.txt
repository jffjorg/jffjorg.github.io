SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of a landlord tenant dispute
regarding property located at 13547 Osborne Street in Arleta, California. On
11/4/19, Plaintiff Jamal Salim Nasrallah (Plaintiff) filed this action alleging
causes of action for: (1) forcible entry and (2) forcible detainer against
Padita Ayana and Parawan Ayana. 
 
On 5/10/22, default was entered against Padita Ayana.  Also on 5/10/22, Plaintiff filed a Doe
Amendment naming Padita Ayana as Trustee of the Parawan Ayana Living Trust.  On 5/11/22, pursuant to Plaintiff’s request,
the Court entered a dismissal without prejudice of Parawan Ayana. (See 5/11/22
Minute Order).  On 6/6/22, the Court
entered an order pursuant to the stipulation of the parties setting aside the
default entered against Padita Ayana. 
 
On 12/7/22, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint
which again asserted causes of action for: (1) forcible entry and (2) forcible
detainer.  On 2/28/23, the Court
sustained, in part, Padita Ayana’s demurrer to the First Amended Complaint and
granted Padita Ayana’s motion to strike portions of the First Amended
Complaint, both with leave to amend. (See 2/28/23 Minute Order). On 4/4/23,
Plaintiff filed a Second Amended Complaint for forcible entry against Padita
Ayana, individually (Padita), and as Trustee of the Parawan Ayana Living Trust
(Trustee) (collectively, Defendant).  On
7/25/23, Defendant’s motion to strike portions of the Second Amended Complaint
was denied.  
 
On 8/15/23, Trustee served Plaintiff with Requests for
Production of Documents, Set 1, making answers due 9/18/23.  (Petrosyan Decl. ¶¶4-5, Ex.A).  Despite being granted multiple extensions of
time to respond, Plaintiff has failed to serve responses to the subject
discovery.  (Petrosyan Decl. ¶¶6-11,
Ex.B-F).    
 
Therefore, on 11/7/23, Trustee filed and served the
instant motion seeking an order compelling Plaintiff to serve verified answers,
without objections, to Requests for Production of Documents, Set 1, served on
Plaintiff on 8/15/23, within 20 days of the hearing.  Additionally, Defendant Padita Ayana as
Trustee of the Parawan Ayana Living Trust seeks an order imposing sanctions
against Plaintiff and/or his attorney of record in the amount of $460.00.  Plaintiff has not opposed or otherwise
responded to the motion.  
 
ANALYSIS
 
Due to Plaintiff’s failure to serve timely responses to
the subject Requests for Production of Documents, Trustee is entitled to an
order compelling Plaintiff to provide responses without objections.  CCP 2031.300(a), (b).  Additionally, due to Plaintiff’s and
Plaintiff’s counsel’s failure to comply with their discovery obligations,
sanctions in the amount of $460.00 are warranted against Plaintiff and
Plaintiff’s counsel, Bryan Castorina. 
CCP 2023.010(d); CCP 2031.300(c); (Petrosyan Decl. ¶12).  
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion is granted. 
Verified responses, without objections, to Requests for Production of
Documents, Set 1, are due and sanctions against Plaintiff and/or Plaintiff’s
counsel, Bryan Castorina, in the amount of $460.00 are payable within 30
days.
