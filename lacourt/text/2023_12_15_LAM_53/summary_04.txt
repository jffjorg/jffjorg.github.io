And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Sofia Nemzer vs. 1544 9th Street, LLC, et al. The Judge has granted the defendant's motion to compel the deposition of Eric Palmquist, a former employee of Amtech Elevator Services, to appear for and testify at deposition. However, the Judge has denied the motion to compel Palmquist to produce documents at deposition because the defendant did not submit a separate statement in support of that request as required.

The Judge has also denied the defendant's request for monetary sanctions against Amtech because the defendant did not state the type of sanction sought in the notice of motion.

The Judge has taken off calendar the hearings on the defendant's motions to compel the depositions of Jimmie Martin and Derek Hunter. The Judge has ordered the defendant to give notice of this ruling.

The Judge's ruling is based on the Code of Civil Procedure, Section 2025.450, which allows a party to move for an order compelling a deponent's attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the deposition notice. The Judge has also relied on Cal. Rules of Ct., rule 3.1345, subd. (a)(5), which requires a separate statement in support of a request to compel or quash the production of documents or tangible things at a deposition.
