 Case Number:  24STCV06740    Hearing Date:   April 30, 2024    Dept:  86 APPLICATIONS (3) FOR RIGHT TO ATTACH ORDERS
  
Date:               4/30/24
(1:30 PM)
Case:                           Tahari LLC et al.
v. Wires Only, Inc. et al. (24STCV06740)
 
TENTATIVE
RULING:
 
The three applications for right to attach orders are ruled
upon as follows: 
 
I.                  
DEFENDANT WIRES ONLY, INC.
 
Plaintiffs Tahari LLC and Jeremey
Tahari’s UNOPPOSED application for right to attach order with respect to Wires
Only, Inc. is taken OFF-CALENDAR as MOOT. On April 22, 2024, Wires Only, Inc.
was dismissed without prejudice pursuant to plaintiffs’ request.
 
II.               
DEFENDANT WHITTINGTON MOTORS SPORTS, INC. 
 
Plaintiffs Tahari LLC and Jeremey
Tahari’s UNOPPOSED application for right to attach order with respect to
Whittington Motors Sports, Inc. is DENIED. 
 
With respect to Whittington Motors Sports, Inc., plaintiffs
fail to show that it was a party to the Resolution Agreement (see Tahari
Decl. ¶ 16 & Ex. E) , which forms the basis of the instant
application. (Tahari Decl. ¶ 24.) Accordingly, plaintiffs fail to show that the
claim against Whittington Motors Sports, Inc. is based on a contract. (CCP §
483.010(a).) Plaintiffs argue no other basis upon which property of Whittington
Motors Sports, Inc. can be attached. 
 
III.            
DEFENDANT RD WHITTINGTON
 
Plaintiffs Tahari LLC and Jeremey
Tahari’s UNOPPOSED application for right to attach order with respect to RD
Whittington is GRANTED IN PART.
 
With respect to defendant RD Whittington, pursuant to CCP
§484.090, the Court finds:
1)     
the claim is one upon which attachment may be issued;
2)     
plaintiff has established the probable validity of the
claim;
3)     
attachment is not sought for any purpose other than
recovery on the claim;
4)     
the amount to be attached is greater than zero.
 
Plaintiffs’ claim against RD Whittington arises from a
Resolution Agreement between plaintiffs and defendants Wires Only, Inc. and RD
Whittington, dated November 10, 2023. (Tahari Decl. ¶ 13 & Ex. E
[“Resolution Agreement”].) Prior to the Resolution Agreement, plaintiff Tahari
LLC entered into an agreement with Wires Only, Inc. for Wires Only, Inc. to
provide and deliver a custom Mercedes-Benz Metris Van. (Tahari Decl. ¶ 4.) In
expectation of receiving the promised van, Tahari LLC paid a $50,000 down
payment, entered into a financing agreement with a third party to cover the
remaining balance of $185,085, obtained insurance, and made lease and insurance
payments. (Tahari Decl. ¶¶ 4, 6, 11, 16 & Exs. A-D.) The van was never
delivered. (Tahari Decl. ¶¶ 10, 12.) To avoid litigation, a Resolution
Agreement was executed. (Tahari Decl. ¶ 13.) 
 
Within 30 days of executing the Resolution Agreement, Wires
Only, defined to include both Wires Only, Inc. and defendant RD Whittington,
agreed to reimburse plaintiffs for all monthly loan principal and interest
payments and insurance premium payments since the loan origination date.
(Resolution Agreement ¶ 2.) Wires Only also agreed to repay plaintiffs their
$50,000 down payment no later than 3 weeks from the date of the Resolution
Agreement. (Resolution Agreement ¶ 6.) If the down payment was not repaid within
3 weeks, interest accrued at 10% per month, compounding monthly, within payment
of accrued interest due within 10 days of accrual. (Resolution Agreement ¶ 6.)
If the down payment or any accrued interest was not fully repaid within 7 weeks
of the Resolution Agreement, a 10% monthly compounding interest rate applied to
the full outstanding loan balance. (Resolution Agreement ¶ 6.) 
 
Defendant RD Whittington guarantied Wires Only, Inc.’s
performance under the Resolution Agreement. (Resolution Agreement ¶ 6.) 
 
Plaintiffs paid a principal amount of $78,810.35, consisting
of $50,000 for a down payment, lease payments totaling $24,735.35 (four lease
payments of $4,974.07), and insurance payments totaling $4,075.00 (four
insurance payments of $815.00). (Tahari Decl. ¶¶ 4, 11 & Exs. A, B, D;
Pottier Decl. ¶ 3 & Ex. 1.) Through March 2024, defendants have not paid
the entire principal amount or $34,684.65 in interest ($113,495.00 total -
$78,810 principal). (Pottier Decl. ¶ 3 & Ex. 1.) 
 
Plaintiffs also claim $69,045.00 in fees and $896.70 in
costs and expenses. The claimed costs appear reasonable, but the fees are not.
The Resolution Agreement contains an attorney fee provision for enforcing the
agreement when sums are not paid when due. (Resolution Agreement ¶ 6 ([“If any
sums go unpaid when due, . . . .Wires Only shall be responsible for payment of
any and all fees or expenses, including attorney’s fees . . . in enforcing this
Agreement”].) Plaintiffs do not provide any explanation of the work done by
counsel, including the tasks performed, number of hours expended, and hourly
rates charged. Based on the record before this Court, it would appear that,
since the Resolution Agreement was executed in November 2023, plaintiffs’ counsel
at most communicated a few times with counsel for Wires Only about repayment (see
Pottier Decl. ¶¶ 19-21), filed the complaint on March 18, 2024, and filed
the instant applications for writs of attachment.  The amount for fees is reduced to $20,000. 
 
Based on the foregoing, the application for at order of
attachment with respect to RD Whittington will be granted in the amount of $134,391.70
($78,810.35 principal + $34,684.65 interest + $20,000 fees + $896.70 costs). 
 
No writ shall issue without the posting of a bond in the
amount of $10,000. (CCP § 489.220.) The Court will sign the proposed order, electronically
received 3/21/24, with modifications to the amount to be attached and the bond
required.
 
Plaintiffs also seeks a temporary protective order pursuant
to CCP § 486.010 et seq. If plaintiffs are entitled to a right to attach order,
a temporary protective order may issue if plaintiffs “will suffer great or
irreparable injury (within the meaning of Section 485.010) if the temporary
protective order is not issued.” (CCP § 486.020.) Plaintiffs seek a temporary
protective order based on other lawsuits filed against RD Whittington. (Pottier
Decl. ¶¶ 6-12 & Exs. 6-11.) However, no judgment has been entered against
RD Whittington in those other lawsuits, and the allegations therein thus remain
unproven as of yet. Accordingly, the Court does not find that it is in the
interest of justice to issue the proposed temporary protective order. (See CCP
§ 486.040.) A writ of attachment sufficiently protects plaintiff’s
interests.
