And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The tentative ruling is that the petitioners' motion to vacate the order sustaining the demurrer to the Second Amended Petition and obtain leave to file a Fifth Amended Petition is denied. The petitioners contend that the demurrer was sustained based on extrinsic fraud on the part of the DWP, but the court finds that the petitioners failed to demonstrate that the grounds upon which the demurrer was sustained were based on false information from the DWP or Pandora. The court also finds that the petitioners' contention that the DWP falsified scoresheets and bid results does not change the fact that Maverick was the entity that submitted the bid and that a judgment in favor of Maverick would adversely affect Pandora. The court concludes that the petitioners fail to show that the ruling on March 21, 2023 was the result of any fraud. Additionally, the court declines to address whether the Fourth Amended Petition is adequately stated and denies DWP's request for judicial notice as "unnecessary to the resolution" of the issues before the court.
