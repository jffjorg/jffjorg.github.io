Here is the English summary:
The Judge's tentative ruling is about three applications for right to attach orders in a case between Tahari LLC and Jeremey Tahari (plaintiffs) and Wires Only, Inc., Whittington Motors Sports, Inc., and RD Whittington (defendants). The Judge rules on each application as follows: the application for right to attach order with respect to Wires Only, Inc. is taken off-calendar as moot since it was dismissed without prejudice; the application for right to attach order with respect to Whittington Motors Sports, Inc. is denied since it fails to show that it was a party to the Resolution Agreement; and the application for right to attach order with respect to RD Whittington is granted in part, granting an order for attachment in the amount of $134,391.70. The Judge also denies a temporary protective order sought by the plaintiffs, finding that a writ of attachment sufficiently protects their interests.
