[TENTATIVE] RULING ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF
  MANDATE
 
Dept. 86 (Hon. Curtis A. Kin)
 
 




 


 


 


 



Petitioners
Families First Funeral Services (“Families First”) and Shon-Tai Burton petition
for a writ of mandate directing respondent Cemetery and Funeral Bureau,
Department of Consumer Affairs, State of California (“Bureau”) to set aside and
vacate its decision to revoke petitioners’ funeral licenses. 
 
I.       Factual Background
 
A.          
Petitioners’
Disciplinary History
 
Families
First is a funeral establishment in Carson, California, and Burton is its owner
and responsible funeral director. (AR 218.) On February 15, 2008, the Bureau
issued funeral director license number 3039 to Petitioner Burton. On June 2,
2015, the Bureau issued funeral establishment license number 2247 to Petitioner
Families First, with Burton associated with the license as the business owner
and responsible funeral director (AR 218.) Burton’s spouse, Michael A. Brass
Jr., is an arrangement counselor and employee of Families First who runs the
day-to-day operations of the business. (AR 600.) Brass used to own and operate another
funeral establishment—All Brass Memorial Chapel—but he surrendered its funeral establishment
license in 2010 in a stipulated resolution of a disciplinary action against that
business. (AR 220-24.)
 
The
Bureau filed its initial Accusation against petitioners on August 10, 2018.
Following an administrative hearing, the Bureau issued a Decision and Order,
which was effective October 11, 2019 (“2019 decision”). In the 2019 decision,
the Bureau revoked petitioners’ licenses, stayed the revocations, and placed
them on probation for three years with terms and conditions that included a
30-day suspension and requirements to obey all laws, submit quarterly
compliance reports, and pay $10,000 in costs to the Bureau on a payment plan.
(AR 172-93 [2019 decision], 194-205 [Accusation].)
 
B.          
Events
Leading to Filing of Accusations
 
Between
February and December 2020, the Bureau received three consumer complaints alleging
months-long delays of Families First in providing cremated remains to family
members. (AR 244, 302, 398.) Two of the consumers who complained also stated
Families First failed to provide death certificates in a timely fashion. (AR
244, 398.) In September 2020, the Bureau itself initiated another complaint
internally after Families First did not renew its funeral establishment license
while on probation. (AR 354-59.) In January 2021, the Bureau received another
consumer complaint alleging that Families First was refusing to release a
decedent’s remains to the coroner without payment of an exorbitant fee. (AR
453.) In April 2021, the Bureau received a complaint from the Health Registrar
of the Ventura County Health Department alleging that Families First had not
returned a signed burial permit issued in January 2021 or payment for the
permit. (AR 507-16.)
 
Following
receipt of the complaints, the Bureau commenced an investigation. Bureau personnel
investigated the complaints and spoke to the complaining consumers, Burton,
Brass, and other witnesses. The investigations did not substantiate the
complaint that Families First had refused to release a decedent's remains to
the coroner, but they revealed evidence supporting the other complaints and
evidence of additional violations beyond what was stated in the complaints. (AR
452-66.)
 
On
March 9, 2021, the Bureau filed the Accusation and Petition to Revoke Probation
against Burton and Families First (AR 13.) The Bureau amended the pleading on
June 10, 2021. On March 29, 2022, after receiving additional complaints and
conducting additional investigations, the Bureau filed the operative Second
Amended Accusation and Petition to Revoke Probation (“Accusation and PTR”)
against petitioners. (AR 153-70.) The Accusation and PTR alleged six causes for
discipline and one cause to revoke probation, as follows: 
 
•
First Cause for Discipline – Failure to Register Death within Eight Calendar
Days – violating Business and Professions Code section 7686 and Health and
Safety Code section 102775, in that petitioners failed to register the deaths
of decedents CC, EM, MA, TS, and MJ with the local registrar within eight
calendar days after death (AR 165);
 
•
Second Cause for Discipline – Holding of Decedent Pending Disposition More than
Eight Calendar Days After Death – violating Business and Professions Code
section 7686 and Health and Safety Code section 103070, in that petitioners
temporarily held the bodies of decedents pending disposition more than eight
calendar days after death (AR 166); 
 
•
Third Cause for Discipline – Gross Negligence, Gross Incompetence, or
Unprofessional
Conduct– violating Business and Professions Code section 7707, in that petitioners
engaged in conduct constituting unprofessional conduct in regard to their
handling of the funeral arrangements of decedents CC, EM, MA, TS, and MJ (AR
166);
 
•
Fourth Cause for Discipline – Violation of Municipal Code – violating Business
and Professions Code section 7704, by violation of Carson Municipal Code
section 6310, subdivision (a), in that petitioners provided funeral goods and
services to consumers for seven months after their business license expired (AR
167);
 
•
Fifth Cause for Discipline – Embalming without Authorization– violating
Business and Professions Code section 7703, in that petitioners violated
California Code of Regulations, title 16, section 1214, by authorizing and
completing the embalming of decedent TS without receiving written authorization
from the person having the legal right to control the disposition of the
remains (AR 168);
 
•
Sixth Cause for Discipline – Failure to Exercise Direct Supervision and Control
– petitioner Burton violated Business and Professions Code section 7686 and
7703 and California Code of Regulation, title 16, Section 1204, subdivision
(b), by failing to exercise direct supervision and control over the conduct of
Families First Funeral Services as is necessary to ensure full compliance with
the Cemetery and Funeral Act, the provisions of the Act, and the applicable
provisions of the Health and Safety Code (AR 168), and;
 
•
First Cause to Revoke Probation – Failure to Obey All Laws– throughout their probation,
petitioners failed to comply with the probation condition which required them
to comply with all conditions of probation and obey all federal, state and
local laws, and all rules and regulations (AR 169).
 
C.          
Petitioners’
Request for Continuance
 
The
hearing on the Accusation and PTR was initially set for January 31 through
February 4, 2022. (AR 41.) On January 19, 2022, petitioners’ counsel filed a
request for continuance on the basis that their attorney, Emanuel Thomas, was
recovering from oral surgery. (AR 73.) The continuance motion also requested to
add two additional days of hearing. (AR 73.) On January 24, 2022, the Office of
Administrative Hearings (“OAH”) issued an order granted the continuance, and
the hearing date was continued to May 23 through June 1, 2022. (AR 82-83.) The
Bureau served a Notice of Continued Hearing on petitioners and their attorney
on February 3, 2022. (AR 86-89.)
 
On
May 17, 2022, petitioners filed a second request for a continuance, citing the unavailability
of their attorney. According to petitioners’ counsel, he was required to appear
at several criminal proceedings scheduled for hearing during the week of May 30
through June 3, 2022. (AR 98-99.) 
 
The
next day, on May 18, 2022, petitioners’ counsel filed an amended request for a
continuance, this time citing three grounds. First, petitioners asserted that
on Friday, May 13, 2022, they received a final witness and exhibit list from
the Bureau which stated that “[t]he hearing originally scheduled for January
31, - February 4, 2022, was continued and extended from one week to two
weeks to allow for the additional witnesses and evidence relating to
the Second Amended Accusation/Petition to Revoke.” (AR 104, emphasis in
original; see also AR 90-91.) Second, counsel cited nine criminal cases
which purportedly had proceedings scheduled the week of May 30 through June 3,
2022. (AR 104.) Counsel asserted that his clients’ rights would be violated if
the hearings did not go forward as scheduled. (AR 104.)  Third, counsel contended that he represented a
client in a murder trial, People v. Joseph Hill, Case No. TA155815, which
had purportedly been advanced to May 27, 2022. (AR 103-04.) The client
purportedly refused to waive time on his murder time due to his mental state.
(AR 104.) Petitioners’ counsel represented that he requested an advancement to
June 1 or 2 to not interfere with petitioners’ administrative case. (AR 104.)
The request was purportedly denied. (AR 104.) 
 
The
Bureau objected to the second continuance request. (AR 108-13.) The Bureau
contended that a review of the superior court’s website indicated that trial in
the Hill matter was scheduled for June 6, 2022, not May 27, 2022. (AR
108, 111.) The Bureau also represented that its counsel called the court clerk
in the Hill case, who confirmed that the trial date was June 6, 2022.
(AR 108.) Allowing for the possibility that the court website was not up to
date, the Bureau asserted that petitioners did not provide any supporting
documentation, such as a minute order. (AR 108.) The Bureau also argued that,
because the defendant in the Hill case was not arraigned until February
9, 2022, petitioners’ counsel was aware of the hearing date in the
administrative matter before proceedings in the Hill case commenced. (AR
108.)
 
Petitioners
responded to the objection. (AR 114-31.) Petitioners argued that their counsel
was retained to represent the defendant in the Hill case after the
arraignment and the preliminary hearing, i.e., March 10, 2022. (AR 111,
115.) Petitioners also asserted that the judge in the Hill case set the
trial for June 6, 2022 but “allowed the trial to be advanced to an earlier date
for the defendant’s counsel to appear and hopefully persuade the defendant to waive
time so his attorney can have adequate time to prepare for trial or move
forward with the trial, while remaining within the defendant's constitutional
rights for a speedy trial.” (AR 115.) Attached to the objection were four
exhibits. Exhibit 1 was an “Acknowledgement of Discovery Receipt” dated March
31, 2022 signed by the Deputy District Attorney in the Hill case, with a
discovery log attached. (AR 118-20.) Exhibit 2 was an “Attorney Special
Appearance,” which contained notes from the attorney who specially appeared on
behalf of the defendant on May 10, 2022. (AR 122.) According to the specially
appearing attorney, the defendant did not want to waive time. (AR 122.) The
judge set the trial for June 6, 2022. (AR 122.) The judge said the trial could
be advanced, but the defendant would need to be consulted. (AR 122.) Exhibit 3
was a “Motion to Continue,” wherein petitioners’ counsel requested that the
pre-trial conference be continued to June 24, 2022 because counsel hired an
investigator to investigate the case. (AR 124-27.) Exhibit 4 was an email from
the Deputy District Attorney to petitioners’ counsel, dated May 13, 2022, which
stated: “So we are set for trial 6/6/22. I intend on subbing witnesses for that
week unless you are going to advance the case to get a time waiver from your
client. If he will even waive time? My understanding is he refused at the last
court date.” (AR 129.) 
 
On
May 19, 2022, OAH issued an order denying the second request, noting that petitioners’
attorney had stated in his January 19, 2022, continuance request he was
available on any date after April 18, 2022. (AR 133.) OAH’s Order further
stated that petitioners’ motion and supporting documents failed to establish
that petitioners’ counsel is unavailable from May 23 to May 27, 2022, or that
he was taken by surprise on May 13, 2022, that the hearing was scheduled for
two additional days the following week. (AR 133.)
 
D.          
Hearing
 
The
matter was heard by videoconference before an Administrative Law Judge (“ALJ”)
from the Office of Administrative Hearings on May 23 through May 25, 2022. (AR
598.) 
 
At
the outset of the hearing, the ALJ stated with respect to petitioners’ request
for a continuance: 
 
I
should say, Mr. Thomas, I did receive and review your request for a continuance.
I know there have been multiple continuance requests related to another matter
you have pending on a different case. I want to acknowledge receipt of that, it
has been ruled on, the hearing will proceed. However, we're not going to make
you be in two places at once, should the hearing in your other matter or the
trial in your other matter actually commence on the 27th, but let’s see what we
can get done -- that is a few days away – and take whatever time is necessary
to accommodate the scheduling of that.
 
There
are many other days scheduled for this hearing, and hopefully we can get
through a good number of the witnesses, if not all of them, before you’re called
away for something else.
 
(HT,
Vol. 1, p. 9.)
 
Before
opening statements, the Bureau sought to exclude Brass from the hearing because
he was neither the licensee nor a party. (HT, Vol. 1, p. 9.) The Bureau argued
that Brass was petitioners’ primary percipient witness and that it did not want
him to adjust his testimony based on the testimony of the Bureau’s witnesses.
(HT, Vol. 1, p. 10.) Counsel for petitioners responded:
 
Your
Honor, he’s actually—that is true—that is true that he is the husband, but he’s
actually the one that deals with all the families. He was going to be my
witness in her place, because their daughter is actually in ICU, which I’ve
sent the Court notice of that, and she has to be with her daughter. Her
daughter’s been in ICU since Tuesday, and she doesn’t look like she’s going to
be getting out anytime soon, so the mother is there.
 
And,
again, I was going to have Mr. Brass as the witness for the funeral home, just
as I would have Ms. Shon-Tai Burton as the witness for the funeral home, and
Ms. Shon-Tai Burton would also be able to be called, she would hear the
witnesses just like the State has an opportunity to have their main witness or
their investigative officer present. That's all I’m saying, your Honor. But if
the Court wishes, I can have him excused.
 
(HT,
Vol. 1, p. 10.) Recognizing Brass’s role at the business and in light of
Burton’s unavailability, the ALJ allowed Brass to attend the proceedings and
denied the Bureau’s request to exclude him. (HT, Vol. 1, p. 12.) 
 
At
the hearing, the Bureau presented clear and convincing evidence in the form of
witness testimony and documentary evidence that proved that Families First
committed the charged acts of failing to register deaths within eight days and
holding decedents pending disposition for more than eight days. (AR 250-51,
305-09, 402-04, 463-66, 514, 615-16; HT, Vol. 1, pp. 145-46.) The ALJ found
that petitioners’ evidence about why that happened did not disprove the charges
and, in some cases, conflicted with the explanations given to family members at
the time. (HT, Vol. 1, pp. 50-51; AR 615-16.)
 
The
evidence also proved that Families First operated with an expired funeral
establishment license and an expired city business license. (AR 357-58.) Petitioners
also did not obtain authorization to embalm decedent TS in the correct form
before doing so, even if TS’s husband verbally authorized the embalming in
advance as claimed. (AR 462-63.) In addition, Families First failed to pay for
a disposition permit for decedent MJ for almost four months after the decedent’s
death and falsified the disposition date on the permit provided to the Bureau.
(AR 512-15; HT Vol. II, pp. 23, 30-31.) Furthermore, Burton failed to supervise
Families First adequately to prevent the violations. (AR 353-59, 464-66; HT,
Vol. 1, 112-13.) The ALJ found that this conduct was unprofessional and
occurred while Families First and Burton were already on probation. (AR 616.)
Indeed, some of the unprofessional conduct took place just a few months after
probation began. (AR 602-06.) At the same time, Families First and Burton
presented no evidence of changed business practices, increased compliance
efforts, or any other evidence of rehabilitation apart from the renewal of
Families First’s funeral establishment license and city business license. As found
by the ALJ, their evidence about some clients having positive experiences with
Families First provided no assurance that Families First and Burton would avoid
similar violations in the future. (AR 617.)
 
The
ALJ found that clear and convincing evidence supported sustaining all alleged
causes for discipline and revocation. (AR 621-27.) After having determined that
the Bureau had proven that Families First and Burton committed serious and
repeat violations that caused consumer harm while they were already on
probation, the ALJ held that allowing petitioners to continue providing funeral
services would not protect the public, which is the highest priority for the
Bureau in exercising its licensing, regulatory, and disciplinary functions. (AR
629-30.) The ALJ’s Proposed Decision held that the proper disciplinary action
is revocation of petitioners’ licenses. (AR 630.)
 
The
ALJ submitted the Proposed Decision on June 24, 2022. (AR 632.) On July 14,
2022, the Bureau adopted the Proposed Decision with an effective date of August
15, 2022 (the “Decision”). (2nd Amend. Opening Br. at 3:14-16; Opp.
at 7:28-8:2.) 
 
II.      Procedural History
 
            On
August 8, 2022, petitioners Families First and Burton filed a verified Petition
for Writ of Mandate. On September 22, 2022, respondent Bureau filed an Answer.
 
Prior
to August 15, 2022, effective date of the Decision, petitioners filed an ex parte
application for a stay of the revocation order. On August 16, 2022, the Court
(Hon. Mary H. Strobel) denied petitioners’ application.
 
            On
June 23, 2023, petitioners filed an opening brief. On February 29, 2024, pursuant
to an October 5, 2023 order allowing for an amended opening brief, petitioners
filed an amended opening brief. On April 2, 2024, respondent filed an
opposition. On April 15, 2024, petitioners filed a second amended opening
brief, which solely corrected citations to the administrative record. (2nd
Amend. Opening Br. at 1:22-24.) On April 16, 2024, petitioners served and filed
a reply.[1] On the
same date, petitioners filed the administrative record and hearing transcript. The
Court has also received a hard copy of the joint appendix. 
 
III.     Standard of Review
 
          Under CCP § 1094.5(b), the pertinent issues are whether the respondent
has proceeded without jurisdiction, whether there was a fair trial, and whether
there was a prejudicial abuse of discretion. An abuse of discretion is
established if the agency has not proceeded in the manner required by law, the
decision is not supported by the findings, or the findings are not supported by
the evidence. (CCP § 1094.5(b).)
 
            The instant petition presents two questions: (1) whether it
was an abuse of discretion for the ALJ to deny a continuance of the hearing,
when counsel for petitioners was purportedly unable to delay a trial set for
May 27, 2022 and when Burton was unable to attend the hearing because her
daughter was hospitalized; and (2) whether it was an abuse of discretion to revoke
petitioners’ licenses.
 
            With respect to the first question, courts exercise
independent judgment in determining whether an ALJ had any discretion under the
circumstances to grant a continuance pursuant to the applicable law. (Bussard
v. Department of Motor Vehicles (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 858, 863.) Orders
granting or denying a continuance “will be upheld unless a clear abuse is
shown, amounting to a miscarriage of justice.” (Ibid.) 
 
            With respect to the second question: “[T]he penalty
imposed by [an] administrative body will not be disturbed in the mandate
proceeding unless a manifest abuse of discretion is shown. If reasonable minds
may differ as to the propriety of the penalty imposed, there has been no abuse
of discretion. It is only in the exceptional case, when it is shown that
reasonable minds cannot differ on the propriety of the penalty, that an abuse
of discretion is shown.” (Deegan v. City of Mountain View (1999) 72
Cal.App.4th 37, 46-47, internal citations omitted.)
 
An agency is presumed to
have regularly performed its official duties. (Evid. Code § 664.) “In
exercising its independent judgment, a trial court must afford a strong
presumption of correctness concerning the administrative findings, and the
party challenging the administrative decision bears the burden of convincing
the court that the administrative findings are contrary to the weight of the
evidence.”  (Fukuda v. City of Angels (1999) 20 Cal.4th 805, 817, internal
quotations omitted.) 
 
IV.     Analysis
 
A.          
Denial
of Continuance
 
Petitioners
contend that it was an abuse of discretion for the ALJ to deny a continuance
based on their counsel’s lack of notice of the hearing dates and representation
of other clients in criminal matters, as well as the inability of Burton to
attend the hearing. (AR 104, 115; HT, Vol. 1, p. 10.)
 
Government
Code § 11524(a) states:
 
(a)
The agency may grant continuances. When an administrative law judge of the
Office of Administrative Hearings has been assigned to the hearing, no
continuance may be granted except by him or her or by the presiding judge of
the appropriate regional office of the Office of Administrative Hearings, for
good cause shown.
 
(b)
When seeking a continuance, a party shall apply for the continuance within 10
working days following the time the party discovered or reasonably should have
discovered the event or occurrence which establishes the good cause for the
continuance. A continuance may be granted for good cause after the 10 working
days have lapsed if the party seeking the continuance is not responsible for
and has made a good faith effort to prevent the condition or event establishing
the good cause.
 
Notably,
Government Code § 11524(c) also states:
 
In
the event that an application for a continuance by a party is denied by an
administrative law judge of the Office of Administrative Hearings, and the
party seeks judicial review thereof, the party shall, within 10 working days of
the denial, make application for appropriate judicial relief in the superior
court or be barred from judicial review thereof as a matter of jurisdiction. A
party applying for judicial relief from the denial shall give notice to the
agency and other parties. Notwithstanding Section 1010 of the Code of Civil
Procedure, the notice may be either oral at the time of the denial of
application for a continuance or written at the same time application is made
in court for judicial relief. 
 
            On May 19, 2022, the ALJ denied the
application by petitioners’ counsel for a continuance based on lack of notice
of hearing dates and clients in other criminal matters. (AR 103-05, 133-35.)
The order denying the continuance was served on petitioners’ counsel by email.
(AR 135.) Petitioners make no showing that they sought review of the denial of
the continuance in the superior court, either within 10 working days of the
denial or thereafter. In the opposition, respondent contends that petitioners
are barred from seeking judicial review of the denial of the continuance now. (Opp.
at 4-11.) Petitioners do not demonstrate how the Court has jurisdiction to
review the ALJ’s denial of the continuance. Indeed, petitioners did not respond
to this argument in their reply at all.
 
Even
if the Court had jurisdiction to consider petitioners’ request for a
continuance based on the criminal matters, petitioners do not show that their
counsel did not have notice of the dates of the administrative hearing. Although
the Bureau asserted in its Final Witness and Exhibit List dated May 13, 2022 that
the hearing was extended from one week to two weeks and that the matter was
currently set for 10 days of hearing (AR 90-92), this assertion appears to have
been erroneous. In response to petitioners’ request to continue the hearing and
extend the hearing time from five to seven days, the ALJ had scheduled the
hearing from May 23 to June 1, 2022, a total of seven working days, with the
Memorial Day holiday excluded. (AR 73, 82-84.) The Bureau served notice that
the hearing was scheduled from May 23 to June 1, 2022. (AR 86-89.) Accordingly,
the ALJ did not abuse his discretion in finding that petitioners filed to
establish that their counsel “was taken by surprise on May 13, 2022, that the
hearing was scheduled for two additional days the following week.” (AR 133.)
 
Petitioners
also do not demonstrate that any criminal proceeding prevented the
administrative hearing from going forward from May 23 through June 1, 2022. The
Bureau presented a printout from the Los Angeles Superior Court website that
indicated that trial in the Hill case was set for June 6, 2022. (AR 111.)
Petitioners responded to the Bureau’s objection by asserting that, even though
the judge in the Hill case set the trial for June 6, 2022, the judge allowed
the trial to be advanced to an earlier date so that counsel could persuade the
defendant to waive time so that counsel could adequately prepare. (AR 115.) However,
none of petitioners’ exhibits attached to the response indicated that the trial
in the Hill case had actually been advanced to May 27, 2022 or any other
date earlier than June 6, 2022. (AR 117-129.) The only trial date referenced in
the exhibits was June 6, 2022. (AR 122, 129.) Petitioners presented no other
documentary evidence purporting to show that their counsel had to appear at any
other criminal proceedings during the scheduled dates for the administrative
hearing. (AR 104.) 
 
In
any event, even if petitioners’ counsel had to appear at any criminal
proceeding during the period when the administrative hearing was scheduled, the
ALJ allowed for the possibility that the hearing would be continued if it were
not concluded by May 27, 2022. (HT, Vol. 1, p. 9; see also AR 134 [“If
the hearing is not concluded by May 27, 2022, the assigned administrative law
judge will have the discretion to make any scheduling orders he or she deems
necessary based on facts and circumstances existing at the time”].) 
 
Accordingly,
petitioners fail to demonstrate that the ALJ abused his discretion in finding
that petitioners’ motion for a continuance failed to establish that their
counsel was unavailable from May 23 to 27, 2022 or that the hearing should proceed
as scheduled on May 23, 2022.
 
With
respect to petitioner Burton’s inability to attend the hearing due to her
daughter’s hospitalization, petitioners do not show that they ever requested a
continuance for that reason. Counsel stated during the hearing that, if Burton
had been able to attend, she “would also be able to be called, she would hear
the witnesses just like the State has an opportunity to have their main witness
or their investigative officer present.” (HT, Vol. 1, p. 5.) However,
petitioner never requested a continuance to allow Burton to attend the hearing.
Accordingly, petitioner fails to show how Burton “was denied the opportunity to
be present at her own hearing.” (2nd Amend. Opening Br. at
14:16-17.) 
 
In
any event, procedural errors, “even if proved, are subject to a harmless error
analysis.” (Hinrichs v. County of Orange (2004) 125 Cal.App.4th 921,
928.) “The question is whether the violation resulted in unfairness, in some
way depriving [petitioner] of adequate notice or an opportunity to be heard
before impartial judges.” (Rhee v. El Camino Hosp. Dist. (1988) 201
Cal.App.3d 477, 497; see also Thornbrough v. Western Placer Unified School
Dist. (2013) 223 Cal.App.4th 169, 200.) The procedural fairness of an
administrative proceeding is a question of law and accordingly reviewed de
novo. (Nasha L.L.C. v. City of Los Angeles (2004) 125 Cal.App.4th 470,
482.)
 
Here,
the evidence showed that Brass, not Burton, handled the day-to-day operations
of Families First. (AR 600.) Petitioners’ counsel stated at the hearing that Brass
was “actually the one that deals with all the families.” (HT, Vol. 1, p. 10.) The
consumer complainants who appeared during the hearing testified that they dealt
with Brass (HT Vol. 1, pp. 42, 48-50, 76-78, 83-84.) Brass told Jennifer Livingston,
a decedent’s family member, that he was the owner of Families First. (HT, Vol.
1, pp. 84-85.) Bureau investigator Neil St. Pierre testified that Brass was the
operator and the person that works in the office of Families First. (HT, Vol.
1, p. 119.) According to St. Pierre, he only spoke with Burton one or possibly
two times over the four years he investigated Families First, because “Brass
was the face of the company” and he “didn’t really see her as an active part of
the funeral establishment.” (HT, Vol. 1, 120-21.)
 
In
the reply, petitioners argue that Burton was not able to call witnesses,
observe their testimony, assist her counsel in responding to the testimony, rebut
the Bureau’s evidence, or review the final exhibits admitted during the hearing
for evidentiary concerns. (Reply at 4:13-19.) Burton fails to show that she
would have been able to provide any such assistance even if she did attend the
hearing. Even though Burton was the licensed owner and responsible funeral
director of Families First, she operated the establishment through Brass. Brass
was not deprived of any opportunity to be heard, as he testified at the
hearing. (AR 614-15.) Burton fails to establish any prejudice that resulted
from her inability to attend the hearing. 
 
            For the foregoing reasons,
petitioners fail to show that the ALJ abused his discretion by having the
hearing proceed on May 23, 2022. 
 
B.          
Propriety
of Penalty
 
Petitioners
assert that revocation of their funeral licenses constitutes an abuse of
discretion. Petitioners argue that they were handling a drastic increase in
bodies due to the COVID-19 pandemic, doctors refused to promptly sign death
certificates, and county crematories were unable to handle the increased
workload. (2nd Amend. Opening Br. at 17:7-11.) Petitioners contend
that they maintained communication with families, made prompt restitution to
unsatisfied consumers, and took immediate action to correct a bounced check
submitted for license fee renewals. (Id. at 17:12-17.) Petitioners
maintain that no parties were injured and that there was no threat of injury. (Id.
at 18:19-21.) 
 
The
Bureau must consider its disciplinary guidelines in reaching a disciplinary
decision. (16 C.C.R. § 1253.6.) “Deviation
from these guidelines and orders, including the standard terms of probation, is
appropriate where the bureau in its sole discretion determines that the facts
of the particular case warrant such a deviation--for example, the presence of
mitigating factors; the age of the case; evidentiary problems.” (Ibid.) 
 
The
guidelines recommend a stayed license revocation with three years’ probation as
a minimum disciplinary action. (AR 628.) The guidelines recommend outright revocation
as the maximum disciplinary action. (AR 628.) In addition, when a suspension or
revocation is based on violations of Business and Professions Code section 7703,
7704, and 7707, the Bureau shall consider the nature and gravity of the acts,
the time that has elapsed since commission of the acts, whether the licensee
has complied with any terms of probation, and evidence of rehabilitation
submitted by the licensee. (16 C.C.R. § 1253.5(b)(2).) 
 
Petitioners
do not dispute the factual findings of the ALJ, only that revocation of their
licenses was excessive. The ALJ found that Families First failed to register
deaths within eight days and held decedents pending disposition for more than
eight days. (AR 615.) The ALJ also found that Brass falsely promised family
member JL that the remains of her aunt would arrive in time for the memorial
service but they never did. (AR 616.) The ALJ also found that “Families First
operated with an expired funeral establishment license and an expired city
business license,” that “Families First and Burton also did not obtain
authorization to embalm TS in the correct form before doing so,” and that “Families
First failed to pay for a disposition permit for MJ for almost four months
after the decedent’s death and falsified the disposition date on the permit
provided to the Bureau.” (AR 616.)
 
With
respect to Burton, the ALJ found that she “failed to supervise Families First
adequately to prevent the violations.” (AR 616.) Burton “relied largely on Brass
to operate the business, and she was not personally involved with any of the cases
until the Bureau received the complaints and contacted Families First about them.”
(AR 616.) 
 
Based
on the foregoing, the ALJ found that petitioners violated Business and
Professions Code section 7703 (violation of regulations), 7704 (operating with
an expired business license), and 7707 (unprofessional conduct). (AR 623-27.) 
 
The
nature and gravity of the acts, including untimely disposition of decedents’
remains and the false assurance that a loved one’s remains would arrive in time
for a memorial service, are severe and egregious. Moreover, the acts at issue
occurred between late 2019 and early 2021, shortly before the ALJ’s decision on
June 24, 2022. (AR 602-11, 629.) Further, at the time of the acts at issue,
petitioners were on probation, under which they were required to obey all state
laws and regulations of programs regulated by the Department of Consumer
Affairs. (AR 191.) By violating Business and Professions Code sections 7703,
7704, and 7707 while under probation, petitioners violated the terms of
probation. 
 
With
respect to evidence of rehabilitation, “[f]ully
acknowledging the wrongfulness of [one’s] actions is an essential step towards
rehabilitation.” (Seide v. Committee of Bar Examiners (1989) 49 Cal.3d
933, 940.) Petitioners’ excuse that the violations were a result of the
COVID-19 pandemic is without merit, as two of the decedents died in late 2019,
before the pandemic began in March 2020. (AR 244, 302, 306-11, 616; Vol. III,
pp. 66-67.) In addition, Brass attempted to attribute the late delivery of EM’s
remains to another Families First employee, which the ALJ found not credible. (AR
616.) Brass gave decedents’ family members false information instead of
accepting responsibility. (HT, Vol. 1, pp. 50-51; AR 615-16.) The foregoing
shows that petitioners, by and through Brass, refused to accept responsibility
and acknowledge the wrongfulness of her acts. 
 
Petitioners
cite cases to support their assertion that revocation of their licenses was
excessive. Based on petitioners’ prior disciplinary history and lack of good
faith, the cases are inapt. (Cf. Harris v. Alcoholic Beverage Control
Appeals Bd. (1965) 62 Cal.2d 589, 595 [licensee had no prior disciplinary
record]; Magit v. Board of Medical Examiners (1961) 57 Cal.2d 74, 88 [licensee
acted in “utmost good faith”]; Wingfield v. Fielder (1972) 29 Cal.App.3d
209, 223 [charges unsupported by the evidence]; Richardson v. Board of
Supervisors (1988) 203 Cal.App.3d 486, 494–495 [termination excessive for “single,
isolated incident that occurred after an unblemished six and one-half year
record of public service during which he had received several commendations”].)
 
In
light of the foregoing, the Court finds that revocation of petitioners’
licenses was not a manifest abuse of discretion.
 
C.          
Motion
for Attorney Fees
 
Petitioners
seek attorney fees pursuant to CCP § 1028.5(a), which states: “In any civil
action between a small business or a licensee and a state regulatory agency,
involving the regulatory functions of a state agency as applied to a small
business or a licensee, if the small business or licensee prevails, and if the
court determines that the action of the agency was undertaken without
substantial justification, the small business or licensee may, in the
discretion of the court, be awarded reasonable litigation expenses in addition
to other costs.” Because petitioners do not prevail, petitioners’ request for
attorney fees is DENIED. 
 
V.      Conclusion
 
The petition is DENIED. Pursuant to Local Rule
3.231(n), respondent shall prepare, serve, and ultimately file a proposed
judgment.
