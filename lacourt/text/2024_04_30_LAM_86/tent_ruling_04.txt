 Case Number:  23STCP01594    Hearing Date:   April 30, 2024    Dept:  86 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
 
Date:               4/30/24
(1:30 PM)
Case:                           Diane Frierson v.
California Victim Compensation Board (23STCP01594)
  
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
The hearing on petitioner Diane Frierson’s Petition for Writ
of Mandate is CONTINUED.
 
While petition elected not to file on opening brief, on
April 2, 2024, respondent California Victim Compensation Claims Board filed an
opposition brief to the petition. On April 17, 2024, respondent filed a Notice
of Lodging of Respondent’s Appendix re Certified Administrative Record. These
two filings were served by electronic mail, according to the proofs of service
attached thereto. 
 
Petitioner Diane Frierson is self-represented. Self-represented
litigants “are to be served by non-electronic methods unless they affirmatively
consent to electronic service.” (Rule of Court 2.251(c)(3)(B).) Neither
petitioner nor respondent have made any filing indicating they have
affirmatively consented to electronic service.
 
Because the opposition and notice of lodging of
administrative record were improperly served, the hearing on the Petition is
CONTINUED to June 4, 2024 at 1:30 p.m. in Department 86 at Stanley Mosk
Courthouse. On or before May 3, 2024, respondent California Victim Compensation
Claims Board shall serve the opposition and notice of lodging of administrative
record to petitioner by mail at petitioner’s address of record: 3835 W. 8th
Street, Apt. 408, Los Angeles, CA 90005 and file proofs of service with the Court.
Petitioner has until May 17, 2024, to file and serve a reply brief, if any. 
 
Counsel for respondent is to give notice.
