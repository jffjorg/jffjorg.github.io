MOVING PARTIES:              Plaintiff and cross-defendant KBS Holdco, LLC, d/b/a Regency
Outdoor Advertising, and defendant and cross-complainant Thomas M. Carlson       
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       n/a
Joint Motion to Seal
The court
considered the moving and supplemental papers filed in connection with this
motion.  
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff
and cross-defendant KBS Holdco, LLC, d/b/a Regency Outdoor Advertising
(“Plaintiff”), together with defendant and cross-complainant Thomas M. Carlson
(“Defendant”) (collectively, the “Parties”) move the court for an order sealing
portions of Defendant’s Cross-Complaint.  Specifically, the Parties seek
the seal the information set forth on the following pages of the
Cross-Complaint: (1) page 2, lines 8-11; (2) page 2, lines 13-16; (3) page 2,
lines 17-24; (4) page 3, lines 2-4; (5) page 3, lines 8-11; (6) page 5, lines
12-14; (7) page 5, lines 15-17; (8) page 5, lines 18-20; (9) page 6, lines 1-2;
(10) page 6, lines 4-7; (11) page 6, lines 9-14; (12) page 7, lines 13-15; (13)
page 7, lines 16-17; and (14) page 8, lines 21-23.   (Angioni Decl.,
Ex. A [proposed redacted Cross-Complaint].)  
Generally,
court records are presumed to be open unless confidentiality is required by
law.¿ (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.550, subd. (c).)¿ If the presumption of
access applies, the court may order that a record be filed under seal “if it
expressly finds facts that establish: (1) There exists an overriding interest
that overcomes the right of public access to the record; (2) The overriding
interest supports sealing the record; (3) A substantial probability exists that
the overriding interest will be prejudiced if the record is not sealed; (4) The
proposed sealing is narrowly tailored; and (5) No less restrictive means exist
to achieve the overriding interest.”¿ (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.550, subd.
(d).)¿¿ 
The Parties
have asserted that, “as part of the[ir] settlement, the Parties jointly agreed
to seek to redact allegations in the Cross-Complaint that [Plaintiff] contends
damage Plaintiff’s (and its owner and employees’) character, business, future
business opportunities, and professional reputation.”  (Mot., pp. 5:12-15, 6:2-5; Angioni Decl., ¶¶
1, 3 [declaration from Plaintiff’s counsel stating that “As part of the
Parties’ agreed upon settlement, the Parties agreed to jointly bring this
Motion to Seal”]; Sylla Decl., ¶¶ 1, 4 [declaration from Defendant’s
counsel stating that “As part of the Parties’ agreed upon settlement terms,
this motion to seal the documents is being filed jointly” by the Parties].)  The portions of the Cross-Complaint that the
Parties seek to seal allege facts supporting the causes of action for sex discrimination,
sexual harassment, wrongful discharge, and retaliation.  (Angioni Decl., ¶ 4; Angioni Decl., Ex. A.)

On
March 7, 2024, the court issued an order on the Parties’ motion (1) noting that
the Parties’ settlement agreement might include a provision that does not
comply with Code of Civil Procedure section 1001, and (2) continuing the
hearing to allow the Parties an opportunity to file supplemental briefs
addressing the effect of section 1001 on their motion to seal. 
The
court finds that it may not enter an order sealing the proposed portions of the
Cross-Complaint and therefore denies the Parties’ joint motion to seal.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1001, subd. (b).) 
“[A]
provision within a settlement agreement that prevents or restricts the
disclosure of factual information related to a claim filed in a civil action or
a complaint filed in an administrative action, regarding any of the following,
is prohibited: [¶¶] (3) An act of workplace harassment or discrimination,
failure to prevent an act of workplace harassment or discrimination, or an act
of retaliation against a person for reporting or opposing harassment or
discrimination, as described in subdivisions (a), (h), (i), (j), and (k) of
Section 12940 of the Government Code.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1001, subd. (a)(3).)  In such a civil matter, “a court shall not
enter, by stipulation or otherwise, an order that restricts the disclosure of
information in a manner that conflicts with subdivision (a).”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1001, subd. (b).) 
            As set forth above, the Parties have
each stated that they have filed the pending motion to seal “[a]s part of the
Parties’ agreed upon settlement” of this action.  (Mot., pp. 5:12-15, 6:2-5; Angioni Decl.,
¶ 3; Sylla Decl., ¶ 4.)  The
allegations that the Parties seek to seal describe workplace harassment under
the Fair Employment and Housing Act. 
(Angioni Decl., Ex. A.)  Thus, the
“provision within [the Parties’] settlement agreement that” requires the
Parties to seal this information is a provision that “prevents or restricts the
disclosure of factual information related to a claim filed in a civil action”
for workplace harassment.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1001, subd. (a)(3).)  The
court therefore “shall not enter . . . an order” sealing, and therefore restricting
the disclosure of, this information pursuant to the Parties’ settlement
agreement.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 1001, subd. (b).) 
            The court notes that Plaintiff has
argued, in its supplemental brief, that section 1001 does not apply to the
Parties’ motion because that statute applies only to settlement
agreements.  (Pl. Supp. Brief, p. 2:7-11,
2:20-23.)  The court disagrees.  
As
set forth above, section 1001, subdivision (a) prohibits the inclusion of
provisions in settlement agreements that prevent or restrict the disclosure of
information related to certain claims filed in civil or administrative actions.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1001, subd.
(a).)  The court agrees that this
provision applies to settlement agreements. 
(Ibid.)  However,
subdivision (b) of section 1001 is not so limited.  Pursuant to that subdivision, “a court shall
not enter, by stipulation or otherwise, an order that restricts the disclosure
of information in a manner that conflicts with subdivision (a).”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1001, subd.
(b).)  Thus, this provision prohibits a
court from entering “an order” preventing or restricting the disclosure of factual
information described in subdivision (a). 
The plain language of subdivision (b) does not limit its application to
motions involving settlement agreements. 
The
court also notes that Defendant, in his supplemental brief, has asserted that
the unverified allegations made in the Cross-Complaint do not constitute
“factual information” within the meaning of section 1001.  The court, however, disagrees, because the
allegations here set forth factual information describing the existence of
workplace harassment. 
Thus,
the court finds that the Parties have not met their burden to show that the
court is not prohibited from entering an order sealing portions of Defendant’s
Cross-Complaint under Code of Civil Procedure section 1001.  The court also finds that, based on the
public policy expressed in section 1001, there is not an overriding interest
that overcomes the right of public access to the record as required.  (Cal. Rules of Ct., rule 2.550, subd.
(d)(1).) 
ORDER
            The court denies plaintiff and
cross-defendant KBS Holdco, LLC, d/b/a Regency Outdoor Advertising and
defendant and cross-complainant Thomas M. Carlson’s joint motion to seal.
            The court orders defendant and
cross-complainant Thomas M. Carlson to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
