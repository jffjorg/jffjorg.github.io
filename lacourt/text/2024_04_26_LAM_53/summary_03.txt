Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The court has denied the joint motion of the plaintiff and defendant to seal portions of the defendant's Cross-Complaint. The court found that the proposed sealing of the Cross-Complaint would restrict the disclosure of factual information related to a claim filed in a civil action, in violation of California Code of Civil Procedure Section 1001. The court held that the parties' settlement agreement, which included a provision requiring the parties to seal the information, was prohibited by Section 1001. The court also found that there was no overriding interest that would justify sealing the information, as required by California Rules of Court, Rule 2.550.
