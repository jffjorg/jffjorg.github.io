Request for Default Judgment 
Plaintiff Asiana Resources, Inc., d/b/a Asiana USA, Inc. (“Plaintiff”)
requests that the court enter default judgment against defendants Royal Halo,
LLC (“Royal Halo”) and Ricardo Hernando Bezares (“Bezares”) (collectively,
“Defendants”).
On April 23, 2024, defendant Royal Halo filed a motion to set aside
its default, which is scheduled for hearing on July 1, 2024. 
On April 23, 2024, defendant Bezares filed a motion to set aside his
default, which is scheduled for hearing on July 2, 2024. 
The court finds that it is appropriate, and exercises its discretion,
to continue the Order to Show Cause re entry of default judgment so that the
court may rule on (1) Royal Halo’s motion to set aside default, (2) Bezares’s
motion to set aside default, and (3) Plaintiff’s request for default judgment
on the same day. 
The court orders that the Order to Show Cause re Entry of Default
Judgment is continued to July 1, 2024, at 10:00 a.m., in Department 53.
The court orders that the hearing on the motion to set aside default
filed by defendant Ricardo Hernandez Bezares is advanced from July 2, 2024 to
July 1, 2024, at 10:00 a.m., in Department 53.
The court directs the clerk to give notice of this order.  
IT IS SO ORDERED.
