MOVING PARTY:                 Plaintiff Seran Ng, D.M.D. Inc.

 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Defendant Yang Lu
Motion to Compel Further Responses to Request for Admission, Set Eight,
and for Sanctions
The court
considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers filed in connection with
this motion. 
EVIDENTIARY OBJECTIONS
The court rules on plaintiff Seran
Ng, D.M.D., Inc.’s evidentiary objections, filed on April 19, 2024, as follows:
Objections Nos. 1 and 7 are overruled. 
Objections Nos. 2-6, and 8 are sustained. 
 
 
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff Seran Ng, D.M.D., Inc. (“Plaintiff”) moves the court for an
order (1) compelling defendant Yang Lu (“Defendant”) to provide a further
response to Requests for Admission, Set Eight, number 105, and (2) awarding
sanctions in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant in the amount of
$4,381.65.
The court finds that Defendant has not shown (1) that Plaintiff’s
motion is untimely on the ground that it was filed after Defendant filed a
motion for a protective order or (2) that, for purposes of this motion, Defendant
was not required to answer this request for admission on the ground that
Plaintiff requested that she admit more than 35 matters because Plaintiff
submitted evidence showing that its discovery request was accompanied by a
declaration that complies with Code of Civil Procedure sections 2033.030,
subdivision (b) and 2033.050.[1]  (Chan Decl., Ex. A, pp. 4-5 [declaration of
Chan for additional discovery].) 
The court grants Plaintiff’s motion to compel Defendant’s further
response to Request for Admission number 105 because (1) the objections to the
request are without merit, and (2) the answer to the request is evasive and
incomplete.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2033.290, subds. (a)(1), (a)(2).) 
The court grants Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions against
Defendant.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2033.290, subd. (d).)  The court
finds that $1,661.65 ((4 hours x $400 hourly rate) + $61.65 filing fee) is a
reasonable amount of sanctions to impose against Defendant in connection with
this motion.  (Chan Decl., ¶ 18.)
The court denies Defendant’s request for monetary sanctions against
Plaintiff, made in her opposition. 
ORDER
            The
court grants plaintiff Seran Ng, D.M.D., Inc.’s motion to compel further
response to request for admission and for sanctions as follows.
            Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 2033.290, the court orders defendant Yang Lu to serve a further, full
and complete response to plaintiff
Seran Ng, D.M.D., Inc.’s Requests for Admission, Set Eight, number 105, that
complies with Code of Civil Procedure sections 2033.210-2033.240 within 20 days
of the date of service of this order. 
            The court orders defendant Yang Lu
to pay monetary sanctions to plaintiff
Seran Ng, D.M.D., Inc. in the amount of $1,661.65 within 30 days of the date of service of this
order. 
            The court orders plaintiff Seran Ng, D.M.D., Inc. to
give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.


DATED:  April 26, 2024
