  Order RE:
 
cross-defendants’ demurrer to second amended
  cross-complaint
 



 
MOVING PARTIES:              Cross-defendants Andrew Morgan,
and Westchester Playa Realty Alliance, Inc., d/b/a Pacific Playa Realty                        
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Defendant and cross-complainant Prosodos Holdings V, LLC
Demurrer to Second Amended Cross-Complaint
Plaintiff Patricia Galea (“Plaintiff”) filed this fraud action on
December 9, 2022 against, inter alia, defendant Prosodos Holdings V, LLC
(“Prosodos”). 
On February 10, 2023, Prosodos filed a Cross-Complaint against
Plaintiff, Andrew Morgan, and Westchester Playa Realty Alliance, Inc., d/b/a
Pacific Playa Realty. 
On June 12, 2023, the court issued an order sustaining the demurrer to
Prosodos’s Cross-Complaint filed by cross-defendants Andrew Morgan, and
Westchester Playa Realty Alliance, Inc., d/b/a Pacific Playa Realty
(“Cross-Defendants”).  Pursuant to the
court’s order granting it leave to amend, Prosodos filed its First Amended
Cross-Complaint against Plaintiff and Cross-Defendants on June 21, 2023. 
On November 28, 2023, the court issued an order sustaining
Cross-Defendants’ demurrer to Prosodos’s third, fourth, and fifth causes of
action in the First Amended Cross-Complaint with leave to amend.  (Nov. 28, 2023 Order, p. 5:1-5.)  The court granted Prosodos 20 days leave to
file a Second Amended Cross-Complaint that cured the deficiencies in the third,
fourth, and fifth causes of action. 
(Nov. 28, 2023 Order, p. 5:12-14.) 
Now pending before the court is the demurrer filed by Cross-Defendants
to the third, fourth, and fifth causes of action alleged in “the Second Amended
Cross-Complaint of Defendant/Cross-Complainant Prosodos Holdings V, LLC[.]”  (Demurrer, p. 2:1-3.)  However, Prosodos did not file a Second
Amended Cross-Complaint with the court. 
Moreover, the parties did not attach the Second Amended Cross-Complaint
as an exhibit for the court’s review. 
Thus, it appears that, pursuant to the court’s November 28, 2023 order
granting it leave to amend, Prosodos (1) served on Cross-Defendants and
Plaintiff[1]
a Second Amended Cross-Complaint but (2) inadvertently failed to file the
Second Amended Cross-Complaint with the court. 
Because Prosodos has not filed its Second Amended Cross-Complaint with
the court, the court cannot rule on Cross-Defendants’ pending demurrer. 
The court therefore exercises its discretion to continue the hearing
on Cross-Defendants’ demurrer to give Prosodos an opportunity to file its
Second Amended Cross-Complaint. 
The court orders that the hearing on cross-defendants Andrew Morgan,
and Westchester Playa Realty Alliance, Inc., d/b/a Pacific Playa Realty’s
demurrer is continued to June 5, 2024, at 10:00 a.m., in Department 53. 
The court orders defendant and cross-complainant Prosodos Holdings V,
LLC to file the Second Amended Cross-Complaint that it served on plaintiff and
cross-defendant Patricia Galea and cross-defendants Andrew Morgan, and
Westchester Playa Realty Alliance, Inc., d/b/a Pacific Playa Realty with the
court no later than May 6, 2024. 
            
 
 
The court orders cross-defendants Andrew Morgan, and Westchester Playa
Realty Alliance, Inc., d/b/a Pacific Playa Realty to give notice of this
ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  April 26, 2024
