```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings. The defendant argued that the plaintiff's first amended complaint fails as a matter of law, but the court declines to follow this argument. The court also rejects the defendant's argument that section 340.1, which allows victims of childhood sexual abuse to bring suit against their abusers, is an unlawful gift of public fund. The judge concludes that the defendant has failed to demonstrate that the plaintiff's claims are deficient as a matter of law or that the statute is unconstitutional. The motion for judgment on the pleadings is therefore denied.
