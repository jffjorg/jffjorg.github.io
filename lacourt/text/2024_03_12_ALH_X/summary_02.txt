And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motions for a protective order and to compel deposition testimony in the case of Dennis O'Brien v. Debra Ann Harris. The Plaintiff seeks to stay his own deposition, while the Defendant seeks to compel the Plaintiff's deposition testimony. The Judge has denied the Plaintiff's motion and granted the Defendant's motion. The Judge has ordered the Plaintiff's counsel to produce the Plaintiff for deposition within 10 days of the date of this order. The Judge has also rejected the Plaintiff's argument that the appointment of a guardian ad litem precludes him from testifying, and has stated that the appointment of a guardian ad litem is not conclusive proof that the Plaintiff is unable to testify as a matter of law.
