Here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The tentative ruling denies Plaintiff's motions to quash deposition subpoenas seeking employment records from Plaintiff's subsequent employers. The court finds that the records are relevant to the case and not overly broad. The court balances Plaintiff's privacy interest against Defendant's interest in discovering relevant documents and finds that the balance shifts clearly in favor of disclosure. The court also denies Plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions and declines to award the requested $500 in sanctions to Defendants.
