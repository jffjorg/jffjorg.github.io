Venice Cardiff, LLC v. Gupta, Case
no. 24SMCV02737
Hearing date October 15, 2024
Defendants’
Motion to Set Aside Default
Plaintiff
sues defendants Praveen and Badri Gupta for breach of written lease. Badri
Gupta was personally served on 8/1/24. Praveen Gupta was substitute served (on
Badri Gupta) that same date. Default was entered against defendants on
9/10/2024 and 9/12/2024. Defendants answered on 9/16/2024. Defendants move to
set aside the defaults. 
Defendants’
counsel Sofris states the defaults were the result of his inadvertence and
excusable neglect. Plaintiff does not contest setting aside the defaults but
seeks $750 in fees. Defendants ask the court to deem the answer filed by
defendant Badri Gupta on 9/16/2024 as timely.
Under
Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. §473(b), the court may set aside a dismissal taken
against a party through “mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable
neglect.” Relief under §473 should be liberally granted because public policy
favors resolution of disputes on the merits, rather than through technical
default. E.g., Fasuvi v. Permatex, Inc. (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th
681, 685.
Defendants
failed to file a timely response due to an error in calendaring. Decl. Sofris
paras. 6-8. Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. §473(b) states a party is entitled to
relief when the default was entered due to attorney error, and a complying
affidavit is filed. Metropolitan Service Corp. v. Casa de Palms, Ltd.
(1995) 31 Cal.App.4th 1481, 1487.
Plaintiff
does not contest set-aside of the defaults but seeks $750 in fees for
preparation and filing of default papers and a CCP 585(b) packet, 2 hours at a
billing rate of $375/hour. Decl. Robinson para. 2. Defendants argue that legal
fees sought under Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. §473(b) must be those necessitated by
obtaining the default. 
Two
hours for preparation and filing of the defaults is not unreasonable, so fees
of $750 (2 x $375/hour) are ordered, payable within 30 days. The defaults are
set aside. GRANTED. Defendants’ answer filed 9/16/2024 is deemed timely.
