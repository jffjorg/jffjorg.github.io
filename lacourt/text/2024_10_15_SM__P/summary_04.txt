And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion by the defendant to stay the proceedings or continue the trial. The plaintiff is suing to establish the limits of an access easement agreement and road grading rights. The defendant argues that the plaintiff's standing to bring the action is uncertain due to a pending foreclosure action against the plaintiff, and that the court's determination of ripeness and standing predate the foreclosure action. The judge finds that the plaintiff's standing is not uncertain and that the action can proceed, as the issues of access and development rights will persist regardless of who owns the properties. The judge also finds that the defendant's request for a 180-day continuance is not justified, as the case has been ongoing since 2016 and the defendant was made aware of the plaintiff's intentions to go to trial in July 2024. The judge grants a 120-day continuance instead, continuing the trial date to April 2025. The motion to stay is denied.
