Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the motion for summary judgment filed by Equinox Fitness Culver City, Inc. and Stages Cycling, LLC, and has made the following findings.

The court finds that there is a triable issue of material fact regarding the existence of a signed waiver of liability by Homerin. Equinox argues that Homerin signed a liability waiver, but Homerin disputes this, claiming that she never saw nor signed a waiver. The court finds that this creates a triable issue of material fact.

The court also finds that there is a triable issue of material fact as to whether Equinox employee Robertson increased the risk of harm to Homerin. Homerin argues that Robertson failed to properly secure the toe-cage on her bike, which caused her injury, and that Robertson's actions increased the risk of harm to her. The court finds that this creates a triable issue of material fact.

As a result, the court denies Equinox's motion for summary judgment.

The court also addresses Equinox's request for judicial notice of the third amended complaint and grants this request.

The court overrules 8 of Equinox's 32 evidentiary objections to Voris Declaration and grants objections 9-10 (which relate to hearsay).

The court finds that plaintiff's opposition to the motion for summary judgment was filed one day late, but will consider it on its merits.
