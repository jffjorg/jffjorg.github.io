180 PCH, LLC v. Saitman, Case no. SC126172
Hearing date October 15, 2024
Defendants’
Motion for Stay of Proceedings or to Continue Trial
Plaintiff
sues to establish the limits of an access easement agreement and road grading
rights. Defendants now seek to stay the proceedings until conclusion of
foreclosure proceedings pending against plaintiff. In the alternative,
defendant seeks a 180-day continuance of the trial, set for 12/16/24. Plaintiff
opposes a stay but is agreeable to a 60-day continuance.
The
complaint was filed 7/22/16, and the FAC was filed 10/17/16. The parties
stipulated to stay the action while plaintiff sought approval for development
and grading plans from the City of Malibu. The City rejected the plans on
10/4/2021 and 5/9/2022. The court lifted the stay on 9/15/2022 so the parties
could adjudicate plaintiff’s grading rights, which plaintiff argues is
necessary before it can seek approval for the overall development plans. Decl. Williams
ex. B at 2. The parties jointly requested a continuance on 5/8/2023 because a
notice of default was recorded against plaintiff and the properties. Decl. Rosen
ex. A.
The
parties jointly requested a continuance on 9/5/2023 because the assignee of
plaintiff’s lender filed a judicial foreclosure action, and the court continued
the matter on 1/25/2024. Decl. Rosen ex. C. Plaintiff informed defendant in
July 2024 that it wished to move forward with the phase one declaratory relief bench
trial due to the limited scope of the trial and the drawn-out nature of the
foreclosure action. Plaintiff agreed to a trial continuance to 12/16/2024 so
defendant would have time to prepare. Decl. Rosen para. 9.
The
Court has the inherent power stay an action. OTO, L.L.C. v. Kho (2019) 8
Cal.5th 111, 141. “[T]he power to stay proceedings is incidental to the power
inherent in every court to control the disposition of the causes on its docket
with economy of time and effort for itself, for counsel, and for litigants.” Id.

Defendants
argue plaintiff’s standing to bring the action is uncertain due to the
foreclosure; while plaintiff may lose standing in the future, it has standing
unless and until it is stripped of its property. Defendants also argue that due
to repeated delays, he has not been actively preparing for trial.
The
court noted on 9/15/2022 “[Plaintiff] cannot realistically proceed with an
application to the City of Malibu without prior adjudication of its grading
rights. Practically, these rights must be adjudicated before a plan is
submitted, not after submission and approval. The matter is ripe and may
proceed.” Min. Order 9/15/2022. The court’s ripeness analysis is not affected
by the pending foreclosure action against plaintiff. The issue is ripe, and so
long as plaintiff retains standing, the action may proceed.
Defendant
asserts the court’s determination of ripeness and standing predate the
foreclosure action. Defendant asserts the court’s finding of ripeness was based
on the expectation that plaintiff would file new plans with the City for
approval. The court’s determination of ripeness acknowledged that plaintiff
needed to establish access and grading rights prior to seeking approval from
the City. Defendant’s argument that plaintiff does not intend to seek such
approval until resolving the foreclosure action is speculative and insufficient
to support a continued stay. 
Defendant
argues plaintiff’s standing is uncertain. Plaintiff is currently the undisputed
owner and possessor of the property. Plaintiff notes easements and grading
rights run with the property, so, even if plaintiff loses possession of the
property, a determination of such rights benefits future owners. Plaintiff may pursue
this action, the results of which would run with the land. The issues of access
and development rights will persist regardless of who owns the properties.
The
parties are bound by a mutual attorney’s fees provision. Defendant argues if
the matter is not stayed, and plaintiff subsequently goes bankrupt, he would be
unable to recover attorney’s fees. It is speculative as to (1) which party will
prevail, (2) whether they would be entitled to fees and (3) whether plaintiff
may file bankruptcy at some point in the future. Such speculation cannot be a
basis for a stay.
In
the alternative, defendant requests a 180-day trial continuance. Plaintiff is
amenable to a 60-day continuance. Defendant was made aware of plaintiff’s
intentions to go to trial in July 2024. The court granted the joint request to continue
the trial from 10/7/24 to 12/16/2024. Decl. Rosenthal para. 9. It does not seem
that defendants need an additional six months to be ready for trial in a case
that has been ongoing since 2016. The court is inclined to continue the trial
date by a period of 120 days to April 2025. Motion to stay is DENIED.
