Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has denied LAUSD's motion for issue sanctions, granted its motion for evidence sanctions, and granted its request for further monetary sanctions. The court has ordered Plaintiff to not present or seek the admission of certain documentary evidence and has imposed a monetary sanction of $540 on Plaintiff. The court has also ordered Plaintiff to pay further monetary sanctions in the amount of $540 within 30 days of notice. The court's decision is based on Plaintiff's failure to comply with discovery orders and his refusal to provide requested documents and information.
