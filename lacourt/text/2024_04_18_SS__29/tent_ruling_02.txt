Background
On May 26, 2020, Plaintiff Renee Agnew (“Plaintiff”) filed the
complaint in this action against Defendants Jensen Enterprises, Inc., Jensen
Precast, and Does 1 through 50, asserting causes of action for premises
liability and negligence arising out of injuries Plaintiff allegedly sustained
after tripping and falling on June 6, 2018, on Defendants’ premises at or near
1375 West Adams in Los Angeles.
On January 3, 2022, Jensen Enterprises, Inc. dba Jensen
Precast (erroneously sued as separate entities) (“Jensen”) filed an answer to
the complaint.
On various dates running from May 2022 through March 2024, Plaintiff
amended the complaint to name Little Shell LLC as Doe 1; Victor Sanchez as Doe
2; Manuel Sanchez as Doe 3; Baskin-Robbins Franchising LLC as Doe 4; Metamoros
LLC as Doe 5; L.A. Grease Solutions, Inc. as Doe 6; Dolce BG, Inc. dba Baskin
Robbins as Doe 7; and Tacos El Unico, Inc. as Doe 8.
On various dates running from January through May 2023, Manuel
Sanchez, Victor Sanchez, Matamoros LLC (erroneously sued as Metamoros LLC), and
Baskin-Robbins Franchising LLC filed answers to the complaint.
On November 7, 2023, the Court granted Plaintiff’s motion for
leave to file a First Amended Complaint (“FAC””).  Plaintiff did not file the FAC until March 6,
2024, but Jensen nonetheless filed an answer to the FAC on December 15, 2023.  On March 11, 2024, Dolce BG, Inc. dba Baskin
Robbins filed an answer to the FAC.
On February 9, 2024, Manuel Sanchez, Victor Sanchez, and
Matamoros LLC filed a cross-complaint for express indemnity, equitable indemnity,
indemnity, and declaratory relief against  Tacos El Unico, Inc. and L.A. Grease Solutions,
Inc.  On April 8, 2024, a First Amended
Cross-Complaint was filed.
Plaintiff filed requests to dismiss Baskin-Robbins Franchising
LLC (Doe 4) and Jensen in February and April 2024.
As it relates to the two motions set for hearing on April 18, Plaintiff
served Defendant Dolce BG, Inc. dba Baskin Robbins (“Dolce”) with Form
Interrogatories (Set One) and Special Interrogatories (Set One) on January 12,
2024. (Steiner Decls., ¶ 8 & Exhs. 1.) Dolce served responses on January
23.  (Id., ¶ 10 & Exhs.
2.)  Plaintiff contends that the
responses are not code compliant, but the parties were unable to resolve the
dispute.  (Id., ¶¶ 11-17 &
Exhs. 3-7.)  The parties participated in
an Informal Discovery Conference (IDC) on March 14, 2024, but the matter was
not resolved.
Plaintiff filed these motions to compel on March 15, 2024.  
Dolce has not filed any opposition.
Legal Standard
“On receipt of a response to interrogatories, the propounding
party may move for an order compelling a further response if the propounding
party deems that any of the following apply: (1) An answer to a particular
interrogatory is evasive or incomplete. (2) An exercise of the option to
produce documents under Section 2030.230 is unwarranted or the required
specification of those documents is inadequate. (3) An objection to an
interrogatory is without merit or too general.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (a).)
Notice of a motion to compel further responses must be given
“within 45 days of the service of the verified response, or any supplemental
verified response, or on or before any specific later date to which the
propounding party and the responding party have agreed in writing.” (Id.,
subd. (c).)
A motion to compel further responses must be accompanied by a meet-and-confer
declaration and a separate statement or, in the discretion of the Court, a
“concise outline of the discovery request and each response in dispute.” (Id.,
subd. (b)(1) & (b)(2); Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345.)
“The court shall
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)
against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a
motion to compel a further response to interrogatories, unless it finds that
the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that
other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (d).)
In Chapter 7 of the
Civil Discovery Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030, subdivision (a)
provides, in pertinent part, that the court may impose a monetary sanction ordering
that any person “engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any
attorney advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses, including
attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.” A “misuse of
the discovery process” includes (among other things) failing to respond or to
submit to an authorized method of discovery; making, without substantial
justification, an unmeritorious objection to discovery; making an evasive
response to a discovery request; disobeying a court order to provide discovery;
and making or opposing, unsuccessfully, a motion to compel without substantial
justification. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subds. (d)-(h).)

Interrogatories Nos. 1.1. and 15.1.

The motion to compel is GRANTED.

Special Interrogatories
Plaintiff moves to compel further responses to Special Interrogatories
Nos. 1-5, 12-14, 17-21, and 27.
Nos. 1, 4, 5, 17, 18, 19.
Dolce’s objections are without merit and are OVERRULED.  Dolce’s responses are incomplete and not code
compliant.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.220,

Sanctions
Plaintiff seeks sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure
sections 2030.300 and 2023.010, et seq. The requests are denied.
Section 2030.300,
subdivision (d), authorizes an award of sanctions against a party or attorney
“who unsuccessfully makes or opposes” a motion to compel further responses, but
here Dolce did not oppose the motion. 
Sections
2023.010 and 2023.030 “do not
independently authorize the trial court to impose monetary sanctions for misuse
of discovery.”  (City of Los Angeles
v. PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLC (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 466, 504.)  (The
Court is aware that the California Supreme Court has granted review of the City
of Los Angeles case, but the Court notes that the order granting review, filed
on January 25, 2023, states that pending review, the appellate opinion “may be
cited,” including “for its persuasive value.”  The Court finds the
reasoning of Justice Moor in the City of Los Angeles case to be
persuasive.)
Conclusion
The Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion to compel Dolce to provide
further responses to Form Interrogatories (Set One).
