The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for leave to amend the complaint to add a cause of action for declaratory relief and arbitration against the plaintiff's UIM insurance carrier. The plaintiff had filed the original complaint on November 5, 2021, and had previously filed a motion for summary judgment, which was granted on March 19, 2024. The plaintiff then filed a motion for leave to amend the complaint on March 18, 2024. The judge found that the plaintiff had established good cause for leave to amend and that the motion satisfied all substantive and procedural requirements. The judge granted the plaintiff's motion for leave to amend and allowed the plaintiff to file the amended complaint within 10 days of the hearing.
