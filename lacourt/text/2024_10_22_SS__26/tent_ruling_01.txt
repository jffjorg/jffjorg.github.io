Discussion
 
Timing of
Motion
 
Defendant Franzen brings the instant Motion
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 1032, 1033.5 and Civil Code
section 1717. A prevailing party is entitled to recover costs, including
attorneys’ fees when authorized by contract, statute, or law. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 1032, subd. (a)(4); § 1033.5, subd. (a)(10).) A motion for attorney’s fees
must be filed and served with the time for filing a notice of appeal under Cal.
Rules of Court Rule 8.822. (Cal. Rules of Court Rule 3.1702(a).) Cal. Rules of
Court Rule 8.822 states that an attorneys’ fees motion must be filed within the
earlier of (1) 30 days after the trial court clerk serves the moving party with
notice of entry of judgment; (2) 30 days after the moving party serves or is
served by a party with a document entitled “Notice of Entry” of judgment or a
file-endorsed copy of the judgment, accompanied by proof of service; or (3) 90
days after entry of judgment. (Cal. Rules of Court 8.822(1).) Here, the Motion
was timely filed as there has been no entry of judgment or notice of entry of
judgment. 
 
Entitlement to Attorney’s Fees as Prevailing
Party
 
Defendant Franzen moves for attorney’s fees
pursuant to the parties’ relevant contractual provision, which states in
relevant part: “ATTORNEY’S FEES. In any legal action brought by either party to
enforce this Agreement or relating to the Residence, the prevailing party will
be entitled to all costs incurred in connection with that action, including
reasonable attorney fees, expert witness and consultant fees, and costs and
expenses.” (Compl., Exh. A, 2017 Lease Agreement, ¶73.) The provision provides
for attorney’s fees to enforce the lease agreement or relating to the residence.
Defendant Franzen argues that they are a prevailing party under this provision
based on the definition set forth in Code of Civil Procedure section 1032,
which includes “a defendant in whose favor a dismissal is entered.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1032, subd. (b)(4).)
 
In opposition, Plaintiff argues that Civil
Code section 1717 creates an exception to that definition of “prevailing party”
by dictating that “[w]here an action has been voluntarily dismissed or
dismissed pursuant to a settlement of the case, there shall be no prevailing
party for purposes of this section.” (Civ. Code, § 1717, subd. (b)(2).) Civil
Code section 1717, however, pertains to attorney’s fees on actions on a
contract: 
 
In any action on a contract, where the
contract specifically provides that attorney’s fees and costs, which are
incurred to enforce that contract, shall be awarded either to one of the
parties or to the prevailing party, then the party who is determined to be the
party prevailing on the contract, whether he or she is the party specified in
the contract or not, shall be entitled to reasonable attorney's fees in
addition to other costs.
 
(Civ. Code, § 1717, subd. (a).) In Khan v.
Shim (2016) 7 Cal.App.5th 49, the Court of Appeals ruled that while Civil
Code section 1717, subdivision (b)(2) barred recovery of attorney’s fees with
respect to the contract causes of action, the parties’ contractual attorney’s
fees provision was broad enough to allow for an award of attorney’s fees on the
tort causes of action. (Khan v. Shim (2016) 7 Cal.App.5th 49, 52.) Here,
the parties’ attorney’s fees provision is likewise broad enough to cover
non-contract causes of action “relating to the residence.”
 
Defendant Franzen argues that the common
counts for open book account and for work, labor, services, and materials
rendered are causes of action that allow for an award of non-contractual
attorney’s fees. The opposition makes no response to this argument, or to the
citation to Khan and its holding with respect to attorney’s fees on
non-contract causes of action. Therefore, the Court finds Defendant Franzen is
entitled to recover attorney’s fees incurred with respect to the common counts.

 
Calculation of Attorney’s Fees Amount
 
The moving party bears the burden of proof
with respect to attorney’s fees. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (c)(5)(A).)
Specifically, a party seeking fees has the burden of showing the fees
incurred are “allowable,” are “reasonably necessary to the conduct of the
litigation,” and are “reasonable in amount.” 
(Levy v. Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc. (1992) 4 Cal.App.4th
807, 816.)
 
The Court’s objective is to award attorney’s fees at the fair market value based
on the particular action. (Ketchum
v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1132.) “The reasonable
hourly rate is that prevailing in the community for similar work.” (PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000)
22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095.) “‘[T]he fee setting inquiry in California
ordinarily begins with the ‘lodestar,’ i.e., the number of hours reasonably
expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate . . . .’” (Ketchum v.
Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1134.) 
The lodestar method is based on the
factors, as relevant to the particular case: “(1) the novelty and difficulty of
the questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the
extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded other employment by the
attorneys, (4) the contingent nature of the fee award.”  (Id. at 1132.) “The ‘‘experienced
trial judge is the best judge of the value of professional services rendered in
his court, and while his judgment is of course
subject to review, it will not be disturbed unless the appellate court is convinced that it is clearly wrong.’’” (Id.) A negative modifier was appropriate
when duplicative work had been performed.
(Thayer v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2001) 92 Cal.App.4th 819.)
 
The Motion seeks $5,000.00 in attorney’s fees
based on the retainer Defendant Franzen paid to defense counsel and that the fees
incurred by defense counsel exceeded that amount. (Motion, Disner Decl., ¶¶2,
5.) Defense bills at $395.00, which is a reasonable hourly rate for an attorney
with more than 15 years of experience. (Id. at ¶4.) Defense counsel
spent more than 12.6 hours on this action by (1) reviewing the Complaint,
multiple lease agreements and addenda, relevant correspondence, other evidence,
and pertinent authority; (2) speaking at length with Defendant’s former
counsel, among other things; (3) preparation of a lengthy and detailed Meet and
Confer Letter to Plaintiff’s counsel on the merits of this action; (4) preparing,
filing, and serving Defendant’s demurrer; (5) speaking with and exchanging
emails with Plaintiff’s counsel on the subject of settlement; (6) preparation,
filing and service of Defendant’s Reply in support of the demurrer; and (7)
appearing on Defendant’s behalf on the date of the demurrer. (Id. at
¶2.) This declaration sufficiently demonstrates the time spent by defense
counsel on this action, which Plaintiff’s opposition does not dispute.

Based
on the foregoing, Defendant Lynda Franzen’s Motion for Attorney’s Fees and
Costs is GRANTED IN THE AMOUNT OF $5,000.00.
