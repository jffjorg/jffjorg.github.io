The Judge has tentatively ruled that Defendant Lynda Franzen's Motion for Attorney's Fees and Costs is GRANTED IN THE AMOUNT OF $5,000.00. The motion was filed on August 23, 2024, and seeks attorney's fees and costs as a prevailing party. The Judge found that Defendant Franzen is a prevailing party under the parties' contractual provision, which provides for attorney's fees to enforce the lease agreement or relating to the residence. The Judge also found that the fees incurred by defense counsel were reasonable and necessary to the conduct of the litigation. The Judge awarded $5,000.00 in attorney's fees, which is the amount of fees incurred by defense counsel in excess of the retainer fee paid by Defendant Franzen.
