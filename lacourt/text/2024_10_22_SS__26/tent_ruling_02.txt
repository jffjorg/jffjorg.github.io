ANALYSIS:
 
On July 9, 2024,
Plaintiff X-Tream Cleaning Service, Inc. (“Plaintiff”) served Form
Interrogatories, Set Two, Special Interrogatories, Set Two, Requests for
Production of Documents, Set Two, and Requests for Admission, Set Two, on
Defendant Royal Personal Training (“Defendant”). (Motion, Hurt Decl., Exh. A.) Despite a meet and confer effort
extending the deadline to serve verified responses without objections,
Defendant has not served responses to the discovery. (Id. at ¶5 and Exh.
B.) Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to Compel Discovery Responses and
Request for Sanctions, on September 30, 2024. No opposition has been filed to
date.
 
Plaintiff improperly
filed a single discovery motion to compel responses with respect to four
separate sets of discovery: the second sets of Form Interrogatories, Special
Interrogatories, Requests for Production, and Requests for Admission. Filing
the requests as a single motion negatively impacts the Court’s calendar by
placing more motions on the calendar than slots have been provided by the
online reservation system. Furthermore, it allows the moving party to avoid
paying the requisite filing fees. Statutorily required filing fees are
jurisdictional and “it is mandatory for the court clerks to demand and receive
statutorily required filing fees.” (See Duran v. St. Luke’s Hospital
(2003) 114 Cal.App.4th 457, 460.) Plaintiff’s motion, therefore, cannot be
heard in full until three additional motion reservations are made and the
corresponding filing fees are paid.
 
Additionally, the
Court notes that the Motion has not attached copies of the discovery requests
served on Defendant. Simply attaching the proofs of service of the discovery
sets is insufficient for the Court’s consideration because the limited
jurisdiction court is subject to particular discovery restrictions. (See Code
Civ. Proc., § 94.) 
 
Conclusion
 
Therefore, Plaintiff X-Tream
Cleaning Service, Inc.’s Motion to Compel Discovery Responses and Request for
Sanctions, is CONTINUED TO DECEMBER 3,
2024 AT 10:00 AM IN DEPARTMENT 26 IN THE SPRING STREET COURTHOUSE. BY NOVEMBER
12, 2024, PLAINTIFF IS TO PAY THE ADDITIONAL FILING FEES AND FILE AND SERVE
SUPPLEMENTAL DECLARATIONS CORRECTING THE DEFECTS NOTED HEREIN.
