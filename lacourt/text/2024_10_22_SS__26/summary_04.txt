And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff, Kinecta Federal Credit Union, its motion for summary judgment in the case against Derek J. Hudson. The plaintiff brought the case for breach of contract, alleging that Hudson defaulted on a loan agreement and failed to make payments. The judge found that the plaintiff presented undisputed facts that demonstrated the existence of the loan agreement, Hudson's breach, and the plaintiff's resulting damages. Since no opposition was filed by Hudson, the judge concluded that a triable issue of material fact does not exist, and therefore granted the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment.
