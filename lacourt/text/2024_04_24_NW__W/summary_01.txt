And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The tentative ruling holds that Plaintiff's Motion to Quash Defendant's Subpoenas for Plaintiff's Private Academic Records is MOOT. The court finds that the subpoenas are no longer relevant since Plaintiff has narrowed her injury claims solely to her spine/neck. Both parties' requests for sanctions are DENIED.
