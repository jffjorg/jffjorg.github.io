The judge has considered the factors in CCP §708.510(c) and has determined that an assignment order is necessary to satisfy the judgment. The charging order will apply to the defendant's interest in HRG1 and HRG2, and the assignment order will require the defendant to assign any money he receives or will receive from these companies to the plaintiff. The plaintiff is ordered to submit a proposed order.
