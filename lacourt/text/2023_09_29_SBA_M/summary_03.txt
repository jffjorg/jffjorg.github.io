```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the motion to relieve attorney Armen Zadourian from representing plaintiffs Jorge Chilel and Everlido Chilel. The attorney has filed a declaration stating that there has been an irreconcilable breakdown in the attorney-client relationship, making it unreasonably difficult to carry out the attorney-client relationship effectively. The court finds that the service requirements of California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1362, have been satisfied and that there are sufficient reasons why the motion to be relieved as counsel should be granted.
