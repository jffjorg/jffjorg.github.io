## English Summary:

This tentative ruling addresses a motion by Attorney Armen Zadourian to be relieved as counsel for plaintiffs Jorge Chilel and Everlido Chilel in a negligence case (Case No. 22TRCV01028). The court finds that the attorney has met the procedural requirements for withdrawing and has provided sufficient reasons for the motion.  

The attorney states that communication with the plaintiffs has broken down, making it impossible to effectively represent them. Despite numerous attempts to contact them via phone, email, social media, and mail, he has been unable to reach them since January 2023.  

Based on these facts and the procedural compliance, the court grants the motion to be relieved as counsel. The attorney will be officially removed from representing the plaintiffs upon filing the required paperwork with the court.
