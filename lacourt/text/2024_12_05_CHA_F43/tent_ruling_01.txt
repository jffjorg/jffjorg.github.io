SUMMARY
OF ACTION
Michael
R. Parker and M.R. Paker Law, PC, counsel of record for Plaintiff Robert Aaron
Stephens, seek to be relieved as counsel for that party.  Counsel filed a motion with the required
forms MC-051, MC-052, and MC-053.  Counsel’s
declaration states that there has been an irreconcilable breakdown in the
attorney-client relationship, such that counsel cannot effectively carry out
representation and finalize the claim. 
Counsel advised Plaintiff to seek new counsel.  
 
Absent
a showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney’s request for withdrawal should
be granted.¿(People v. Prince¿(1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406.)¿There is
no showing of prejudice, and counsel’s motion complies with California Rules of
Court, Rule 3.1362 and meets its requirements.
 
Motion
to be relieved as counsel is granted.
 
Moving
party to give notice.
