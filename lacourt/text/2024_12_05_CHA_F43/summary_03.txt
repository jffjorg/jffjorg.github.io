The Judge has ruled that the Plaintiff's motion to compel depositions and production of documents is moot. The parties had previously noticed the depositions, but the Defendants' counsel stated he was unavailable for depositions until October 2024. Despite this, the parties were able to successfully reschedule the depositions, and the purpose of the motion is now fulfilled. The Judge declines to award sanctions to either party.
