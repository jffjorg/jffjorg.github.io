SUMMARY
OF ACTION
Plaintiff
Samuel Nelson (Plaintiff) filed this elder abuse action against defendants
Veronica Diaz and Diana Morales (Defendants) alleging two causes of action for
elder abuse and civil theft.  The
complaint alleges that while Defendants served as Plaintiff’s caregivers,
Defendants exerted undue influence over Plaintiff.  Defendants stole Plaintiff’s personal
property, falsified their time sheets, compelled Plaintiff to pay the falsified
amounts, and refused to correct their timesheets and return the stolen
items.  
 
On
June 14, 2024 and June 21, 2024, Plaintiff served notices of deposition on Defendants.  The depositions were scheduled for July 5,
2024 and July 12, 2024.  Defendants’
counsel stated he was unavailable for depositions until October 2024.  
 
Plaintiff
filed this motion to compel depositions on July 26, 2024.  Plaintiff filed a supplemental motion and
supporting declaration on November 21, 2024. 
Defendants filed an opposition on November 25, 2024.  Plaintiff filed a reply that same day. 
 
Meet and Confer
A
motion to compel a deposition must include either a meet and confer declaration
or, “when the deponent fails to attend the deposition and produce the
documents, electronically stored information, or things described in the
deposition notice, . . . a declaration stating that the petitioner has
contacted the deponent to inquire about the nonappearance.” (Code Civ. Proc., §§
2025.450, subd. (b), 2016.040.)   
 
Plaintiff’s
counsel of record, Margot Nelson, P.C., states she attempted to meet and confer
with Defendant’s counsel, Joe L. Richardson. 
(Declaration of Margot Nelson, P.C.) 
On June 14, 2024, Ms. Nelson electronically served a Notice of
Deposition of Diana Morales.  (Nelson
Dec., Exh. C.)  The deposition was set
for July 5, 2024.  (Nelson Dec., ¶ 2,
Exh. A.)[1]  On June 21, 2024, Ms. Nelson electronically served
a Notice of Deposition of Veronica Diaz. 
(Nelson Dec., Exh. D.)  The
deposition was set for July 12, 2024.  (Nelson
Dec., ¶ 2, Exh. A.) Ms. Nelson asked Richardson to let her know if these dates
were inconvenient.  (Ibid.)
  
On
June 25, 2024, Mr. Richardson served an objection to the noticed deposition
dates because Nelson did not first ascertain Morales and Diaz’s availability
before setting the dates.  (Nelson Dec.,
Exhs., at pp. 17-24.)  On June 26, 2024,
Nelson requested that Mr. Richardson and his co-counsel Roxanne M. Henry send her
dates when both Morales and Diaz would be available for depositions within
10-20 days of the noticed dates.  (Nelson
Dec., Exh. G.)  
 
On
July 5, 2024, Ms. Nelson again requested that Richardson provide alternative
dates for the depositions.  (Nelson Dec.,
Exh. H.)  Ms. Nelson stated if Mr. Richardson
did not respond by the end of day on July 8, 2024, she would reset the
depositions without his input and file a notice of nonappearance if the Defendants
did not attend the depositions.  (Ibid.)  Ms. Nelson also emailed Mr. Richardson a meet
and confer letter attempting to meet and confer and set new deposition
dates.  (Nelson Dec., Exhs. J, K.)  Mr. Richardson replied that he was not
available until October 2024.  (Nelson
Dec., Exh. I.)  Ms. Nelson also served a
notice of continuing the depositions: July 26, 2024 for Diana Morales and
August 2, 2024 for Veronica Diaz. 
(Nelson Dec., Exh. K.)  
 
On
July 17, 2024, Mr. Richardson served objections to the continued deposition
dates.  (Nelson Dec., Exhs., at pp.
38-45.)  Mr. Richardson reiterated that
he was not available for depositions until October 2024.  (Nelson Dec., Exh. P.)  
 
On
July 22, 2024, Ms. Nelson sent Mr. Richardson another meet and confer email requesting
alternative deposition dates or that she would file a motion to compel.  (Nelson Dec., Exh. Q.)  
 
Summary of Arguments
Plaintiff’s
counsel moves for an order compelling depositions and awarding sanctions
because Defendants refused to cooperate and provide alternative dates for
depositions.  Defendants’ counsel berated
Plaintiff’s counsel through email and objected to the depositions on invalid
bases.  In his supplemental
papers, Plaintiff argues he is entitled to sanctions because Defendant Morales
refused to be deposed on the requested documents or to the produce the
requested documents.  
 
In
opposition, Defendants argue this motion is moot because the parties already
rescheduled the deposition dates.  Defendant
Morales was deposed on November 15, 2024, and Defendant Diaz’s deposition will
occur on December 6, 2024.  (Opposition,
p. 2:7-8.)  The requested sanctions are
unfounded because Plaintiff has not shown bad faith or misuse of the discovery
process.  Rather, the Court should impose
sanctions against Plaintiff for filing its supplemental motion and declaration
because deposition dates have been set and Defendant Morales already attended
her deposition.  Additionally, Plaintiff’s
counsel’s representation of Plaintiff is inappropriate because she may be a
material witness in this case. 
Defendants do not address Plaintiff’s arguments about not producing
documents.  
 
In
reply, Plaintiff states the Court should not consider Defendants’ opposition
because it was filed five days after the deadline to file oppositions.  Plaintiff also reiterates that the depositions
have not been completed because Defendant Morales refused to be fully deposed
or produce the requested documents during her November 15, 2024
deposition.  (Plaintiff’s Reply, p.
2:8-13.)  Regarding Defendants’ material
witness argument, this argument is irrelevant to this motion and is improperly
raised by Defendants.  (Id. at pp.
2:24-26, 3:1-2.)
 
ANALYSIS
An
oral deposition shall be scheduled for a date at least 10 days after service of
the deposition notice.”  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2025.270, subd. (a).)  A
properly served deposition notice is effective to require a party or
party-affiliated deponent to attend and to testify, as well as to produce
documents for inspection and copying.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.280, subd.
(a).) 
 
“If,
after service of a deposition notice, a party . . . without having served a
valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to appear for examination, or to
proceed with it, or to produce for inspection any document . . . described in
the deposition notice, the party giving notice may move for an order compelling
deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production . . . of any document .
. . described in the deposition notice.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd.
(a).)¿ The motion must set forth both facts showing good cause justifying the
demand for any documents and a meet and confer declaration.¿ (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2025.450, subds. (b)(1), (b)(2).)¿ 
 
A
motion to compel production of documents described in a deposition notice must attach
declarations with facts showing “good cause” for inspecting the requested
documents.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450,
(b)(1).)  “Good cause” exists where the specific
facts show the documents are necessary for the demanding party to prepare for
trial and to prevent surprise.  (See Associated
Brewers Distributing Co. v. Superior Court (1967) 65 Cal.2d 583, 587.)  
 
As
an initial matter, Plaintiff is correct that Defendants filed a late
opposition.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005,
subd. (b).)  Although “a trial court has
broad discretion to accept or reject late-filed papers,” the late-filing party
should seek leave to file their opposition late.  (See Rancho Mirage Country Club Homeowners
Ass’n v. Hazelbaker (2016) 2 Cal.App.5th 252, 262; see also Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1300(d).)  Defendants do
not show good cause for filing their opposition late, and the Court does not
consider the opposition’s arguments.  
 
Plaintiff
noticed Defendants of the depositions at least ten days before the deposition
dates.  Plaintiff noticed Defendant
Morales on June 14th for a July 5th deposition. 
Plaintiff noticed Defendant Diaz on June 21st for a July 12th
deposition.  Defense counsel objected to
these dates and informed Plaintiff he was not available for depositions until
October 2024.  Plaintiff continued
suggesting dates prior to October 2024, and Defense counsel’s response remained
the same.  After much discussion, the
parties successfully rescheduled the depositions.  Morales’s deposition occurred on November 15,
2024.  (Supplemental Nelson Dec., ¶¶ 2,
4.)  Defendant Morales already attended
her deposition.  Plaintiff does not
dispute that the parties agreed on deposition date for Defendant Diaz.  Thus, this motion is moot.  
 
Plaintiff
argues his discontent with Defendant Morales’s deposition in his supplemental
moving papers filed November 21, 2024. 
Plaintiff states Morales failed to produce the requested documents and
refused to answer questions about the documents.  However, Plaintiff must file a separate
motion to compel answers and production of documents under section 2025.480,
subdivision (a).  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2025.480, subd. (a).)  Additionally, in
order for the Court to properly rule on these issues, Plaintiff must “lodge” a
certified copy of the relevant parts of the deposition transcript with the
Court.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.480,
subd. (h).)  Plaintiff has not filed this
paperwork. 
 
Therefore,
Plaintiff’s motion to compel depositions and production of documents is
moot.  
 
            Sanctions
Plaintiff
requests $2,000.00 in monetary sanctions. 

 
The
court must impose monetary sanctions “against the deponent or the party with
whom the deponent is affiliated, unless the court finds that the one subject to
the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances
make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (g)(1).)   
 
As
noted above, Defendants’ counsel consistently stated he was unavailable for
depositions until October 2024. 
Regardless, Plaintiff chose to proceed with this motion.  However, the parties were able to successfully
schedule depositions, and the purpose of this motion is now moot. 
 
Accordingly,
the Court does not award sanctions for either party in this matter.
 
ORDER
Plaintiff’s motion to compel depositions and
production of documents is moot. The Court does not award sanctions. 
 
Moving
party to give notice.
