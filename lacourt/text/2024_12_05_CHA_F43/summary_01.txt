And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted the motion of Michael R. Parker and M.R. Parker Law, PC, counsel for Plaintiff Robert Aaron Stephens, to be relieved as counsel. The motion was filed with the required forms and a declaration stating that there has been an irreconcilable breakdown in the attorney-client relationship, making it impossible for counsel to effectively represent the Plaintiff and finalize the claim. The Judge cites People v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406 and California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1362 in support of the decision. The Judge notes that there is no showing of prejudice and that counsel's motion complies with the required procedures. The moving party is ordered to give notice.
