SUMMARY
OF ACTION
Plaintiffs
Juan Ibarra Villegas and Paloma Roman Ibarra (Plaintiffs) bought a 2017 Dodge
Caravan from defendant FCA US, LLC.  The
car began experiencing several mechanical defects, and Plaintiffs sued FCA for
violating the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act, alleging that FCA was unable
to repair the defects and did not replace the car or make restitution.  
 
On
June 14, 2024, Plaintiffs propounded 49 special interrogatories on FCA seeking information
about repair rates for other 2017 Dodge Grand Caravans regarding the same issues
plaguing Plaintiffs’ Dodge Grand Caravan. 
Plaintiffs also served a good cause declaration.  Responses were due 30 days later.  
 
FCA
served unverified responses on July 26, 2024. 
Plaintiffs asked FCA to provide further verified responses by August 20,
2024.  
 
On
September 16, 2024, Plaintiffs filed this motion to compel further responses to
special interrogatory numbers 45, 46, 47, and 48.  FCA filed an opposition on November 22,
2024.  No reply has been filed as of
December 3, 2024.  
 
Meet and Confer
A
motion to compel further responses must be accompanied by a meet and confer
declaration showing a “reasonable and good faith attempt” to resolve issues
outside court.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2016.040, 2030.300,
subd. (b)(1).)  
 
Plaintiffs’
counsel, Armando Lopez, declares he sent FCA’s counsel a meet and confer letter
on August 9, 2024 and specified the deficiencies in FCA’s unverified responses.  (Declaration of Armando Lopez, ¶ 5, Exh.
C.)  Lopez asked FCA to provide further
verified responses by August 20, 2024. 
(Lopez Dec., ¶ 6, Exh. C, p. 9.) 
Lopez also proposed setting the motion to compel deadline to September
16, 2024.  (Lopez Dec., ¶ 6, Exh. C, p. 1.)  FCA agreed to the September 16th deadline but
later rescinded the agreement.  (Lopez
Dec., ¶ 7, Exh. D, p. 1, 3.)  FCA did not
directly address the meet and confer letter. 

 
Summary of
Arguments
Plaintiffs
move for the Court to order FCA to serve code-complaint verified responses to special
interrogatories numbers 45, 46, 47, and 48. 
Plaintiffs argue that FCA’s responses lack merit because they only
object to relevance.  Plaintiffs’
interrogatories seek relevant information about the repair rates for 2017 Dodge
Grand Caravans to determine whether the alleged defects and nonconformities are
widespread and to refute FCA’s affirmative defense that Plaintiffs caused their
vehicle’s issues through their own misuse. 
(Motion to Compel Further, pp. 4: 28, 5:1-3.)  Plaintiffs also seek evidence of customer
complaints related to warranty repairs for the 2017 Dodge Grand Caravan.  FCA’s handling of these complaints is
relevant to determining whether FCA “willfully” violated the Song-Beverly
Act.  
 
In
opposition, FCA argues special interrogatories 36 through 58 are excessive and are
unauthorized according to the Court’s Song-Beverly Litigation Discovery
Order.  The information Plaintiffs seek is
irrelevant to this case.  Plaintiffs have
ignored this Court’s live meet and confer requirement and FCA’s ongoing
willingness to cooperate and resolve discovery disputes.  Additionally, once FCA realized the statutory
deadline to file a motion to compel further did not commence until it filed
verifications for its initial responses, it rescinded its agreement to extend
Plaintiffs’ deadline to file this motion on September 16, 2024.  FCA served a formal response to Plaintiffs’
meet and confer letter, verifications for its discovery responses, and
supplemental productions of pages of relevant documents on September 17, 2024.  (Declaration of Michael D. Smith, Exh. 11, at
p. 3.)  
 
Plaintiffs
did not reply.
 
ANALYSIS
A
demanding party may move to compel further responses to special interrogatories
where the demanding party fails to respond or responds with objections or
incomplete answers.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§
2030.290, 2030.300.)  The demanding party
must serve the motion to compel further within 45 days after service of
verified responses, unless the parties agree, in writing, to extend the time to
file.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300,
subd. (c).)  If the responding party
serves unverified responses, the 45-day time limit does not run until verified
responses are served.  (See Golf &
Tennis Pro Shop, Inc. v. Superior Court (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 127,
135-136.)
 
The
Court has reviewed the documents related to his motion and will not decide the
motion on the merits at this time.  The
Court orders the parties to meet and confer directly, not by email or in
writing.  Additionally, the parties are
ordered to file a joint statement of remaining issues by a date to be set by
the Court.  The joint statement should
briefly describe the matters in dispute, followed by Plaintiffs’ arguments,
then FCA’s arguments.
