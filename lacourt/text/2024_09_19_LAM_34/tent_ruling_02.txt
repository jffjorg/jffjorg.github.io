Ballin’s
Motion for Attorney’s Fees
 
A.   
      Legal
Standard
 
“Except as otherwise expressly
provided by statute, a prevailing party is entitled as a matter of right to
recover costs in any action or proceeding.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd.
(b).)
 
Attorneys’ fees are allowed as costs
when authorized by contract, statute, or law. (Code Civ. Proc, § 1033.5, subd.
(a)(10)(B).)
 
B.   
      Discussion
 
1.    
      The
Parties’ Arguments
 
Defendant Ballin moves the Court to award her $29,965.27, which is
comprised of $25,605.00 in attorney’s fees for the anti-SLAPP Motion, $3,650.00
in attorney’s fees for the fee motion, and $710.27 in costs and expenses.
(Ballin’s Motion for Attorney’s Fees, pp. 3:14–28, 7:14–15; Proposed Order to
Ballin’s Motion for Attorney’s Fees, p. 2:5–7.)
 
Defendant Ballin argues: (1) that she is entitled to an award of
reasonable attorney’s fees under the lodestar method; (2) that her lawyers’
hourly rates and hours incurred are reasonable; and (3) that she is entitled to
an award of costs. (Ballin’s Motion for Attorney’s Fees, pp. 4:1–2, 4:15–16,
4:26–27, 5:14–15, 5:24–25, 6:3–4, 6:13–14, 6:19.)
 
Plaintiffs apparently concede that Defendant Ballin is entitled to
attorney’s fees for prevailing on Ballin’s anti-SLAPP Motion, instead arguing
that “an award of $10,000 seems appropriate.” (Opposition to Ballin’s
anti-SLAPP Motion, pp. 2:13–15, 4:16–17, 5:7.) Plaintiffs come to this number
after arguing that Ballin’s anti-SLAPP Motion was not factually or legally
complex. (Id. at p. 4:16–17.)
 
In her Reply, Defendant Ballin reiterates her arguments and requests an
additional $1,770.00 in fees for 4.5 hours of work (not 5.0 hours) done since
filing the motion. (See Reply in support of Ballin’s Motion for Attorney’s
Fees, p. 6:7–8 and Supp. Decl. Lewis, ¶ 3.) Thus, the total amount of fees
requested by Defendant Ballin is $31,735.27. (Id. at p. 6:18–20.)
(Although this number is not explicitly listed in the Reply, the language in
the body of Ballin’s Motion for Attorney’s Fees and the associated Reply
indicate that Defense Counsel mistakenly forgot to account in the conclusory
figures for the initial seven hours allegedly spent on the fee motion.)
 
2.    
      Authority for Fees & Prevailing Party
 
a.     
      Legal
Standard
 
“Except as provided in paragraph
(2), in any action subject to subdivision (b), a prevailing defendant on a
special motion to strike shall be entitled to recover that defendant’s
attorney’s fees and costs. If the court finds that a special motion to strike
is frivolous or is solely intended to cause unnecessary delay, the court shall
award costs and reasonable attorney’s fees to a plaintiff prevailing on the
motion, pursuant to Section 128.5.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 425.16, subd. (c)(1).)
 
“A defendant who prevails on a
special motion to strike in an action subject to paragraph (1) shall not be
entitled to attorney’s fees and costs if that cause of action is brought
pursuant to Section 11130, 11130.3, 54960, or 54960.1 of the Government Code,
or pursuant to Chapter 2 (commencing with Section 7923.100) of Part 4 of
Division 10 of Title 1 of the Government Code. Nothing in this paragraph shall
be construed to prevent a prevailing defendant from recovering attorney’s fees
and costs pursuant to Section 7923.115, 11130.5, or 54960.5 of the Government
Code.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 425.16, subd. (c)(2).)
 
b.    
      Discussion
 
On March 28, 2024, the court
granted Ballin’s anti-SLAPP Motion and dismissed with prejudice Defendant
Ballin from the Verified Complaint. (Minute Order dated March 28, 2024, p. 15.)
 
            Defendant Ballin is a prevailing
defendant on a special motion to strike that is not brought pursuant to one of
the causes of action listed in Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16,
subdivision (c)(2). Thus, Defendant Ballin is entitled to recover her attorney’s
fees and costs. (Code Civ. Proc., § 425.16, subd. (c)(1).)
 
3.    
      Method
of Calculation for Fees
 
a.     
      Legal
Standard
 
“Section 425.16, subdivision (c), provides that a prevailing
defendant on a special motion to strike shall be entitled to recover his or her
attorney's fees and costs. It is well established that the amount of an
attorney fee award under the anti-SLAPP statute is computed by the trial court
in accordance with the familiar lodestar method. Under that method, the court
tabulates the attorney fee touchstone, or lodestar, by multiplying the number
of hours reasonably expended by the reasonable hourly rate prevailing in the
community for similar work.” (569 East Cnty. Boulevard LLC v. Backcountry
Against the Dump, Inc. (2016) 6 Cal.App.5th 426, 432, brackets, quotations,
internal quotation marks omitted.)
 
b.    
      Discussion
 
Defendant Ballin argues that the
lodestar adjustment method should be used to calculate attorney’s fees. (Ballin’s
Motion for Attorney’s Fees, p. 4:1–2.) 
 
Plaintiffs do not dispute this or
propose a different method.
 
The court uses the lodestar adjustment
method to calculate fees.

Legal
Standard
 
“The courts repeatedly have
stated that the trial court is in the best position to value the services
rendered by the attorneys in his or her courtroom, and this includes the
determination of the hourly rate that will be used in the lodestar calculus. In
making its calculation, the court may rely on its own knowledge and familiarity
with the legal market, as well as the experience, skill, and reputation of the
attorney requesting fees, the difficulty or complexity of the litigation to
which that skill was applied, and affidavits from other attorneys regarding
prevailing fees in the community and rate determinations in other cases.” (569
Easy Cnty. Boulevard LLC, supra, 6 Cal.App.5th at p. 437, citations

ii.              
Discussion
 
Counsel for Defendant Ballin claim the following hourly rates: (1)
$800.00 per hour for Counsel Jeff Lewis; (2) $400.00 per hour for Counsel Kyla
Dayton; (3) $225.00 per hour for Paralegal Jason Ebbens; and (4) $225.00 per
hour for Counsel Paralegal Renee Miramontes. (Ballin’s Motion for Attorney’s
Fees, pp. 4:15–6:1, Decl. Lewis ¶¶ 5–12, Exh. 1.)
 
Plaintiffs do not make an argument about the hourly rates, although
Plaintiffs’ Counsel states that Counsel Lewis’ rate of $800.00 per hour “is a
bit steep, in my opinion, but not unreasonable.” (Opposition to Ballin’s Motion
for Attorney’s Fees, Decl. Schuman, ¶ 5.)
 
After considering the information provided, the court agrees that the
hourly rates for Counsel Lewis and Counsel Dayton. However, the court does not
agree that attorney’s fees should be awarded for services provided by Paralegals.
(Roe v. Halbig (2018) 29 Cal.App.th 286, 312.) 
 
b.    
      Reasonableness
of the Number of Hours
 
i.                
Legal
Standard
 
“Under the lodestar adjustment methodology, the trial court
must initially determine the actual time expended and then ascertain whether
under all the circumstances¿of the case the amount of actual time expended and the monetary charge being
made for the time expended are reasonable. Factors to be considered include,
but are not limited to, the complexity of the case and procedural demands, the
attorney skill exhibited and the results achieved. The prevailing party and fee
applicant bears the burden of showing that the fees incurred were reasonably
necessary to¿the conduct of the litigation,
and were
reasonable in amount. It follows that if the prevailing party fails to meet
this burden, and the court finds the time expended or amount charged is not
reasonable under the circumstances, then the court must take this into account
and award attorney fees in a lesser amount.” (Mikhaeilpoor v. BMW of N. Am.,
LLC (2020) 48 Cal.App.5th 240, 247 [cleaned up].)
 
ii.              
Discussion
 
Counsel for Defendant Ballin claims that the following hours were
incurred: (1) 7.5 total hours for Counsel Lewis; and, (2) 47.6 hours for
Counsel Dayton. (Ballin’s Motion for Attorney’s Fees, pp. 3:14–28 and Exh. 1,
pp. 1, 7, 10; Reply in support Ballin’s Motion for Attorney’s Fees, Supp. Decl.
Lewis, ¶ 3.)
 
Plaintiffs’ Counsel argues that the number of hours is unreasonable
because Ballin’s anti-SLAPP Motion was not factually or legally complex.
(Opposition to Ballin’s Motion for Attorney’s Fees, p. 4:16–17.) In his
declaration, Counsel Schuman does not point to any specific line items but
rather generally notes: (1) that an associate spent “volume hours” here, which
was not the best use of time; (2) that many of the hours requested do not
relate to Ballin’s anti-SLAPP Motion but rather to the motion for an
undertaking, settlement discussion, and communications with the client; and (3)
that it is difficult to assess certain items due to the redactions. (Id.,
Decl. Schuman, ¶¶ 8–11.)
 
The court agrees with most of Plaintiffs’ Counsel’s arguments. 
 
First, the primary reason why Defendant Ballin prevailed on her special
motion to strike is because Plaintiffs did not provide sufficient (or, for some
claims, any) admissible evidence to substantiate their allegations.
Furthermore, the court spent a significant amount of additional time working on
the Minute Order dated March 28, 2024 because Ballin’s anti-SLAPP Motion did a
below-average job in breaking down and considering the various individual
pieces of conduct within the Complaint. (Compare Ballin’s anti-SLAPP Motion,
pp. 7–10 with Minute Order dated March 28, 2024, pp. 6–8.)
 
Second, the issues in this case were relatively straightforward, and thus
it was unreasonable to incur over fifty-five hours of attorney work (and dozens
more hours of paralegal work) on a special motion to strike with such issues.
This is particularly the case when the quality of those “volume hours” do not
appear to have provided a better product.
 
Third, the court finds it difficult to parse through the redacted
invoices. Specifically, it is very difficult to tell when certain line items in
the invoices are (or, perhaps more importantly, are not) directly related to
the special motion to strike. From what the Court can tell, it does appear that
a significant amount of items are not related to the special motion to strike.
 
Finally, the court notes that the amount of hours incurred for the fees
motion is patently unreasonable. The fee motion is a boilerplate document that
should not have taken five hours of attorney time and two hours of paralegal
time, much less an additional 4.5 hours. Even if such hours could have been
reasonably justified, it does not appear likely that those hours were actually
incurred here. As noted above in Section I.B.1, Defense Counsel appears to have
rushed through the fee motion so quickly that they did not even request the
initial seven hours of work on the fee motion in the conclusions of either the
motion or the reply. 
 
Based on the court’s assessment of a reasonable amount of hours incurred
for both Ballin’s anti-SLAPP Motion and Ballin’s Motion for Attorney’s Fees,
the court will allow 4 total hours for Counsel Lewis and 20 hours for Counsel
Dayton.
 
5.    
      Reasonableness
of the Costs Claimed
 
Defendant Ballin lists $710.27 in costs and expenses, which are comprised
of: (1) $435.00 in filing fees for the special motion to strike; (2) $60.00 in
filing fees for the motion for undertaking; (3) $60.00 in filing fees for fee
motion; and (4) $155.27 in service fees. (Ballin’s Motion for Attorney’s Fees,
pp. 6:19–7:4.)
 
Plaintiffs concede that these costs should all be awarded, but not twice.
(Opposition to Ballin’s Motion for Attorney’s Fees, p. 3:7–11.)
 
The court notes that as a prevailing defendant who has been dismissed
from the Complaint, Defendant Ballin can obtain costs pursuant to both Code of
Civil Procedure section 1032, subdivision (b) and pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 425.16, subdivision (c)(1). The court agrees with Plaintiffs that
Defendant Ballin is not entitled to a double recovery of costs. 
 
All of these costs are reasonable and allowable under at least one of the
cost statutes. The Court will award all $710.27 in these costs and
expenses.  
 
C.   
      Conclusion
 
Ballin’s Motion for Attorney’s Fees is GRANTED in part. Fees and costs
are AWARDED in favor of Defendant Ballin and against Plaintiffs, jointly and
severally, in the total amount of $11,910.27. This amount is comprised of $11,200.00
in attorney’s fees and $710.27 in costs and expenses.

1.    
      The
Parties’ Arguments
 
Defendant Sill moves the Court to award her $42,650.78, which is
comprised of $41,324.80 in total attorney’s fees (for both the anti-SLAPP
Motion and the fee motion) and $1,325.98 in costs. (Sill’s Motion for
Attorney’s Fees, p. 5:26–27.)
 
Defendant Sill argues: (1) that she is entitled to an award of reasonable
attorney’s fees under the lodestar method; (2) that her lawyers’ hourly rates
and hours incurred are reasonable; (3) that the time spent on preparing the fee
motion, any reply, and appearing at the motion on it should be included; and (4)
that she is entitled to an award of costs. (Sill’s Motion for Attorney’s Fees,
pp. 3:15, 3:26–4:1, 4:7, 4:25, 5:13–14, 5:19.) 
 
Plaintiffs argue that Defendant Sill is not entitled to fees because the
issues in Sill’s anti-SLAPP Motion were identical to those in Ballin’s
anti-SLAPP Motion yet Defendant Sill waited until after the court had already
ruled on Ballin’s anti-SLAPP Motion to file a separate motion instead of
joining Defendant Ballin’s motion. (Opposition to Sill’s Motion for Attorney’s
Fees, p. 3:8–15.) Plaintiffs also argue that even if the work was necessary,
the issues were not complex, the hours incurred were duplicative, and the hours
did not relate to the special motion to strike. (Id. at pp. 4:1–2,
5:8–10.) Plaintiffs ultimately allow that the $2,500.00 would be an appropriate
amount of fees and do not comment on costs. (Id. at pp. 5:26–6:2.)
 
In her Reply, Defendant Sill reiterates her arguments and requests the
same amount as before. (Reply in support of Sill’s Motion for Attorney’s Fees,

Discussion
 
Defendant Sill is represented by two law firms: (1) Slaughter, Reagan
& Cole, LLP; and (2) Plonsker Law LLP. (Sill’s Motion for Attorney’s Fees,
p. 4:8, 4:17.)
 
The former firm’s attorneys claim the following hourly rates: (1) $225.00
per hour for Counsel Barry J. Reagan; (2) $225.00 per hour for Counsel Kevin J.
Heimler; (3) $209.00 per hour for Counsel Gabrielle Mezger-Lashley; and (4)
$209.00 per hour for Counsel Jeffrey J. Halfen. The court does not agree that attorney’s
fees should be awarded for services provided by Paralegals. (Roe v. Halbig
(2018) 29 Cal.App.th 286, 312.) 
 
The latter firm’s attorneys claim the following hourly rates: (1)
$1,000.00 per hour for Counsel Michael J. Plonsker; and (2) $700.00 per hour
for Counsel Rex Glensy. (Sill’s Motion for Attorney’s Fees, p. 4:17–24 and
Decl. Plonsker, ¶ 4.)
 
Plaintiffs do not discuss the hourly rates, either in the body of their
opposition or in the associated declaration. 
 
After considering the information provided, the court agrees that the
hourly rates for the lawyers at Slaughter, Reagan & Cole, LLP are
reasonable. 
 
However, the court does not agree that Counsel Plonsker and Glensy’s
hourly rates are reasonable. The court has not been provided with sufficient
evidence that would explain why respective rates of $1,000.00 and $700.00 are
reasonable. Length of practice, being a named partner, and having represented
well-known individuals in the entertainment industry are insufficient for why
such a significant departure from the standard range of rates in this community
is appropriate in this circumstance. (Sill’s Motion for Attorney’s Fees, Decl.
Plonsker, ¶¶ 6–7.) In addition, while Counsel Plonsker’s Declaration does state
that they have been involved with “the prosecution and defense of actions for
defamation and also Anti-SLAPP Motions”, this detail is vague as it does not
state, for example, how many such motions have been litigated and what their
results were. (Id. at ¶ 4.) Thus, the Court will allow a $600.00 per
hour rate for Counsel Plonsker and a $500.00 per hour rate for Counsel Glensy.

made for the time expended are reasonable. Factors to be considered include,
but are not limited to, the complexity of the case and procedural demands, the
attorney skill exhibited and the results achieved. The prevailing party and fee
applicant bears the burden of showing that the fees incurred were reasonably
necessary to¿the conduct of the litigation,
and were
reasonable in amount. It follows that if the prevailing party fails to meet
this burden, and the court finds the time expended or amount charged is not
reasonable under the circumstances, then the court must take this into account
and award attorney fees in a lesser amount.” (Mikhaeilpoor v. BMW of N. Am.,
LLC (2020) 48 Cal.App.5th 240, 247 [cleaned up].)
 
ii.              
Discussion
 
The attorneys from Slaughter, Reagan & Cole, LLP claim that the
following hours were incurred for Sill’s anti-SLAPP Motion: (1) 5.1 hours for
Counsel Reagan; (2) 18.2 hours for Counsel Heimler; (3) 47.4 hours for Counsel
Mezger-Lashley; and (4) 4.8 hours for Counsel Halfen. (Sill’s Motion for
Attorney’s Fees, Decl. Heimler, ¶¶ p. 4:8–16 and Decl. Heimler, ¶ 6–12.)
 
The attorneys from Plonsker Law LLP claim that the following hours were
incurred for Sill’s anti-SLAPP Motion: (1) 16.95 hours for Counsel Michael J.
Plonsker; and (2) 5.9 hours for Counsel Glensy. (Sill’s Motion for Attorney’s
Fees, Decl. Plonsker, ¶¶ 6–7.)
 
            In addition to those hours, 13.8
hours are estimated to be incurred by Counsel Heimler for the fees motion,
which would be comprised of 7.8 hours on the motion, five hours reviewing the
opposition and preparing a reply, and one hour attending the hearing. (Sill’s
Motion for Attorney’s Fees, Decl. Heimler, ¶ 14.) 
 
            As previously stated, Plaintiffs argue
that no fees should be granted because Defendant Sill could have joined the
earlier special motion to strike. (Opposition to Sill’s Motion for Attorney’s
Fees, p. 3:8–15.) Plaintiffs also argue that even if the work was necessary,
the issues were not complex, the hours incurred were duplicative, and the hours
did not relate to the special motion to strike. (Id. at pp. 4:1–2,
5:8–10.) Plaintiffs’ Counsel even makes an additional argument about redactions
and how they make it difficult to tell what each line item relates to. (Id.,
Decl. Schuman, ¶ 10.)
 
The court agrees with most of the opposing arguments. 
 
First and foremost, it was unnecessary to file a separate special motion
to strike. Excluding the cover page and the verification, the pleading is only
four pages, and it is filled with paragraphs that do not make any distinction
among any of the defendants when it comes to descriptions of the conduct
alleged. Thus, Counsel for Defendant Sill could have simply filed a joinder to
Ballin’s anti-SLAPP Motion, which would have conserved both their resources and
judicial resources. 
 
Second, once Defendant Sill did choose to file her own special motion to
strike, it was not reasonable to spend almost 100 hours of attorney time on a
special motion to strike that dealt with identical conduct to what the Court
had already ruled on. It is particularly unreasonable given that Sill’s
anti-SLAPP Motion does not make any different arguments from Ballin’s
anti-SLAPP Motion.
 
Third, while there is no set number of attorneys who are
allowed to work on a case, the number of attorneys can be unreasonable. “Plainly,
it is appropriate for a trial court to reduce a fee award based on its
reasonable determination that a routine, noncomplex case was overstaffed to a
degree that significant inefficiencies and inflated fees resulted.” (Morris
v. Hyundai Motor Am. (2019) 41 Cal.App.5th 24, 39.) “[J]ust as there
can be too many cooks in the kitchen, there can be too many lawyers on a case.”¿
(Id. at p. 38, quoting Donahue v. Donahue¿(2010) 182 Cal.App.4th
259, 272.) The use of six attorneys and three paralegals—all of whom billed in
connection with the special motion to strike—led to overstaffing,
inefficiencies, and inflated fees. Simply put, there was no reason here to use
two law firms on a relatively straightforward special motion to strike that had
already been ruled upon. 
 
Fourth, many of the hours listed have nothing to do with Sill’s
anti-SLAPP Motion. Contrary to Defense Counsel’s arguments, line items like the
2.6 hours spent on writing the demurrer, 2.1 hours writing the motion to
strike, 0.1 hours analyzing a notice of related case, 2.3 hours of reviewing
pleadings in related cases, and so on are not recoverable because they were
completely unrelated to Sill’s anti-SLAPP Motion. (Sill’s Motion for Attorney’s
Fees, p. 5:6–12 and Exhs. 1–2; Lafayette Morehouse, Inc. v. Chronicle
Publishing Co. (1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 1379, 1383–1384 [“These reports
clearly show the Legislature intended that a prevailing defendant on a motion
to strike be allowed to recover attorney fees and costs only on the motion to
strike, not the entire suit. . . . We decline to interpret and apply the
statute in a way other than as the Legislature intended.”].)
 
Fifth, as with Ballin’s anti-SLAPP Motion, the primary reason why
Defendant Sill prevailed on her special motion to strike is because Plaintiffs did
not provide sufficient (or, for some claims, any) admissible evidence to
substantiate their allegations. In addition, it is notable that Sill’s
anti-SLAPP Motion is very similar to Ballin’s anti-SLAPP Motion—and ignores how
the Court broke down the individual pieces of conduct in the Minute Order dated
April 24, 2024—even though the Court’s tentative order had been available for
days prior to the filing of Sill’s anti-SLAPP Motion. This indicates a
copy-and-paste approach to the work rather than close attention paid to the
case at hand.
 
Sixth, the Court faces even more difficulty parsing these invoices than
it did with the invoices in Ballin’s Motion for Attorney’s Fees. Specifically,
the invoices from Plonsker Law LLP are so vague and over-redacted that it is
difficult to see why they should be awarded more than few hours even if
incurring such hours was reasonable. Submitting invoices with sections that are
completely redacted is tantamount to not submitting that evidence at all.
Further, it is unclear why the Plonsker Law LLP invoices include so many hours
for “researched” and “read websites”, whether those hours were directly related
to the special motion to strike, and why those hours are reasonable if the
purpose of the second firm was to be experts on anti-SLAPP litigation. 
 
Finally, the court notes that the number of hours claimed for the fees motion
is patently unreasonable and unlikely to have actually occurred. The fee motion
is a boilerplate document that should not have taken multiple hours to create
and is highly unlikely to have actually taken 7.8 hours of attorney time—much
less five additional hours for a three-page reply.
 
In its discretion, the court chooses not to deny all attorney’s fees. The
reason for this is because Defendant Sill was not required to file a separate
special motion to strike, even if doing so would have been more efficient.
However, given the duplicative nature of the work for the second special motion
to strike, the reasonableness of additional hours comes under a higher level of
scrutiny. 
 
Based on the court’s assessment of a reasonable amount of hours incurred
for both Sill’s anti-SLAPP Motion and Sill’s Motion for Attorney’s Fees, the court
will allow 0.75 hours for Counsel Reagan, 4.5 hours for Counsel Heimler, 5
hours for Counsel Mezger-Lashley, 1 hour for Counsel Halfen, 1 hour for
Paralegal DeSoto, 1 hour for Paralegal Suarez, 0.25 hours for Paralegal Gomez,
2.5 hours for Counsel Plonsker, and 1 hour for Counsel Glensy. 
 
5.    
      Reasonableness
of the Costs Claimed
 
Defendant Ballin lists $1,325.98 in costs, which are comprised of: (1) $1,130.00
in filing and motion fees; (2) $78.55 in court reporter fees; and (3) $117.43
in e-filing fees. (Sill’s Motion for Attorney’s Fees, Decl. Heimler, ¶ 16.)
 
Plaintiffs do not make a separate argument about costs but rather leave
it to Plaintiffs’ Counsel to declare a belief that the total amount of fees and
costs should be no more than $2,500.00. (Opposition to Sill’s Motion for
Attorney’s Fees, Decl. Schuman, ¶ 12.)
 
The Court notes that, as a prevailing defendant who has been dismissed
from the Complaint, Defendant Sill can obtain costs pursuant to both Code of
Civil Procedure section 1032, subdivision (b) and pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 425.16, subdivision (c)(1), but that she is not entitled to a
double recovery of costs. 
 
All of these costs are reasonable and allowable under at least one of the
cost statutes. The Court will award all $1,325.98 in these costs.  
 
C.   
      Conclusion
 
Sill’s Motion for Attorney’s Fees is GRANTED in part. Fees and costs are
AWARDED in favor of Defendant Sill and against Plaintiffs, jointly and
severally, in the total amount of $5,761.23. This amount is comprised of $2,435.25
in attorney’s fees associated with Slaughter, Reagan & Cole, LLP, $2,000.00
in attorney’s fees associated with Plonsker Law LLP, and $1,325.98 in costs. 
 
III.          
SHEI’s
anti-SLAPP Motion & Friedman’s anti-SLAPP Motion
 
A.   
      Legal
Standard
 
“A cause of action
against a person arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the
person’s right of petition or free speech under the United States Constitution
or the California Constitution in connection with a public issue shall be
subject to a special motion to strike, unless the court determines that the
plaintiff has established that there is a probability that the plaintiff will
prevail on the claim.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 425.16, subd. (b)(1).)
 
“In making its
determination, the court shall consider the pleadings, and supporting and
opposing affidavits stating the facts upon which the liability or defense is
based.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 425.16, subd. (b)(2).)
 
“A SLAPP suit—a strategic
lawsuit against public participation—seeks to chill or punish a party's
exercise of constitutional rights to free speech and to petition the government
for redress of grievances. The Legislature enacted Code of Civil Procedure section
425.16—known as the anti-SLAPP statute—to provide a procedural remedy to
dispose of lawsuits that are brought to chill the valid exercise of
constitutional rights.” (Rusheen v. Cohen (2006) 37 Cal.4th 1048,
1055–56, citations omitted.)
 
“In light of the foregoing, we may
summarize a court's task in ruling on an anti-SLAPP motion to strike as
follows. Section 425.16, subdivision (b)(1) requires the court to engage in a
two-step process. First, the court decides whether the defendant has made a
threshold showing that the challenged cause of action is one arising from
protected activity. The moving defendant's burden is to demonstrate that the
act or acts of which the plaintiff complains were taken ‘in furtherance of the
[defendant]'s right of petition or free speech under the United States or
California Constitution in connection with a public issue,’ as defined in the
statute. (§ 425.16, subd. (b)(1).) If the court finds such a showing has been
made, it then determines whether the plaintiff has demonstrated a probability
of prevailing on the claim. Under section 425.16, subdivision (b)(2), the trial
court in making these determinations considers ‘the pleadings, and supporting
and opposing affidavits stating the facts upon which the liability or defense
is based.’” (Equilon Enters. v. Consumer Cause, Inc. (2002) 29 Cal.4th
53, 67.)
 
“Only a cause of
action that satisfies both prongs of the anti-SLAPP
statute—i.e., that arises from protected speech or petitioning and lacks even minimal merit—is a SLAPP, subject to
being stricken under the statute.” (Navellier v. Sletten (2002) 29
Cal.4th 82, 88­–89, emphases in original.)
 
B.   
      Discussion
 
1.    
      The
Parties’ Arguments
 
Defendant SHEI moves the Court to strike it from the Complaint and to
award it attorney fees and costs. (SHEI’s anti-SLAPP Motion, p. 14:19–21.)
 
            Defendant Friedman similarly moves
the Court to strike him from the Complaint. (Friedman’s anti-SLAPP Motion, p.
9–10.)
 
            Plaintiffs oppose both special
motions to strike. 
 
Plaintiffs argue that SHEI’s anti-SLAPP Motion is untimely. (Opposition
to SHEI’s anti-SLAPP Motion, pp. 2:21, 6:19–21.) 
 
Plaintiffs argue that Friedman’s anti-SLAPP Motion should be denied,
based entirely on the arguments and evidence made in opposition to the other
three special motions to strike. (Opposition to Friedman’s anti-SLAPP Motion,
p. 2:8–10.)
 
2.    
      Timeliness
 
a.     
      Legal
Standard
 
“The special motion may be filed
within 60 days of the service of the complaint or, in the court’s discretion,
at any later time upon terms it deems proper. The motion shall be scheduled by
the clerk of the court for a hearing not more than 30 days after the service of
the motion unless the docket conditions of the court require a later hearing.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 425.16, subd (f).)
 
b.    
      Discussion
 
A brief recounting of the timeline is helpful here. 
 
·       On January 30, 2024, Plaintiffs filed
Judicial Council Form POS-010, Proof of Service of Summons regarding Defendant
SHPS. 
 
·      
On
February 27, 2024, Plaintiffs amended their Complaint to substitute Doe 1 with
Defendant SHEI. 
 
·       On March 4, 2024, SHEI’s Counsel signed
Judicial Council Form POS-015, Notice and Acknowledgment of Receipt—Civil
regarding receipt of the Summons and Complaint in this matter. (Opposition to
SHEI’s anti-SLAPP Motion, Exh. 1.)
 
·      
On April 17, 2024, the Parties agreed via
email to an additional thirty days for SHEI to file SHEI’s anti-SLAPP Motion. 
 
·       On May 16, 2024, Defendant SHPS filed SHPS’s anti-SLAPP
Motion.
 
·       On May 20, 2024, by request of Plaintiffs,
the Clerk’s Office dismissed without prejudice Defendant SHPS. 
 
·      
On May 21,
2024, Defendant SHEI filed SHEI’s anti-SLAPP Motion. 
 
Regarding the sixty-day service deadline, SHEI had until May 3, 2024 to
file its anti-SLAPP Motion because SHEI was served with the Complaint on March
4, 2024. Unless the Court uses its discretion here, SHEI’s anti-SLAPP Motion
would be considered untimely because it was filed on May 21, 2024. 
 
The Court finds that the late filing of SHEI’s anti-SLAPP Motion is
proper given the circumstances at hand. Specifically, it appears that the
Parties informally agreed to a thirty-day extension of the deadline. (Reply in
support of SHEI’s anti-SLAPP Motion, Exh. 7 [actual pp. 128–130 of 164].) While
the Court need not accept the Parties’ stipulations, the Court looks favorably
upon the Parties’ respective Counsel acting civilly and granting each other
extensions. 
 
In this situation, it is important to note that one could reasonably have
read ambiguity into this extension, such that the deadline had either become
May 17, 2024 (based on if the thirty-day extension was from the date requested
of April 17, 2024) or June 3, 2024 (based on if the thirty-day extension was to
a ninety-day deadline, plus one day due to it falling on a Sunday). That issue
did not require resolution because Defendant SHPS filed SHPS’s anti-SLAPP
Motion on May 16, 2024. While Defendant SHPS and SHPS’s anti-SLAPP Motion were
soon dismissed, they were in reality identical to Defendant SHEI and SHEI’s
anti-SLAPP Motion. 
 
Thus, the circumstances here do not indicate that Defendant SHEI
inappropriately delayed but rather that, despite minor procedural issues, the
Parties and their Counsel did their best to work together and submit their
filings on a timely basis. 
 
The Court allows the filing of SHEI’s anti-SLAPP Motion past the
sixty-day service deadline. 
 
In addition, the Court notes that both SHEI’s anti-SLAPP Motion and
Friedman’s anti-SLAPP Motion are being heard long past the thirty-day deadline
for service of those motions. (Code Civ. Proc., § 425.16, subd (f).) This was necessary due to the docket
conditions of the Court, which have been delayed for months by the recent
retirement of the prior judicial officer in Department 34. (Ibid.)
 
3.    
      The
Merits
 
The two special motions to strike at hand (and their associated filings)
do not present the Court with any new law, arguments, or evidence. 
 
Notably, each of the individual pieces of conduct alleged in the
Complaint was alleged against all of the Defendants. (Complaint, ¶¶ 10–18.) 
 
The Court has already twice granted special motions to strike against
this Complaint after concluding that the alleged activity involves protected
activity and that Plaintiffs have not demonstrated a probability of prevailing
on their claims. (Minute Order dated March 28, 2024, pp. 6–8, 10–12; Minute
Order dated April 24, 2024, pp. 5–8, 10.)
 
“Where the reason is the same, the
rule should be the same.” (Civ. Code, § 3511.)
 
                        Conclusion
 
Defendant SHEI’s anti-SLAPP Motion is GRANTED. Defendant SHEI is STRICKEN
from the Complaint. Defendant SHEI may move for attorney’s fees and costs. 
 
Defendant Friedman’s anti-SLAPP Motion is GRANTED. Defendant Friedman is
STRICKEN from the Complaint. Defendant Friedman may move for attorney’s fees
and costs. 
 
            All Parties have been stricken or
dismissed from the Complaint. The Complaint is now DISMISSED with prejudice. 
 
IV.          
SHEI’s
Demurrer and SHEI’s Motion to Strike
 
In addition to SHEI’s anti-SLAPP Motion, Defendant SHEI also filed SHEI’s
Demurrer and SHEI’s Motion to Strike. 
 
The Court has now stricken Defendant SHEI from the Complaint. Thus, the
Court lacks jurisdiction to hear SHEI’s Demurrer and SHEI’s Motion to Strike. 
 
SHEI’s Demurrer and SHEI’s Motion to Strike are TAKEN OFF CALENDAR.
