  Case Number:  23STCV06298    Hearing Date:   September 19, 2024    Dept:  34 Plaintiff Yasmeen Masoud’s Motion for Order
Compelling Further Answers to 
Special Interrogatories, Set Two, from Defendant Ceragem International,
Inc. is MOOT.
Sanctions are declined.
 
Background    
 
Plaintiff Yasmeen Masoud
(“Plaintiff”) alleges the following:
 
Ceragem International,
Inc. (“Defendant”) owns and operates stores devoted to selling therapeutic
massage chairs and tables. Defendant regularly employed more than five people
during the time period alleged herein. In January 2022, Defendant hired Masoud
to work as an employee at its store in Cerritos, CA. Plaintiff is female,
raised in Qatar, and is of Arabic descent. She wears a hi jab 3 and is of the
Islamic faith. On January 17, 2022, Defendant promoted Masoud to the store
manager position at Cerritos at a salary of $41,600 per year. On July I, 2022, Defendant
increased her salary to $50,000 a year to be the Cerritos store manager. On
November 20, 2022, Defendant increased her salary to $63,000 a year to be the
store manager at its Century City location. During Plaintiff's employment as a
store manager, Defendant paid higher salaries 11 to its male store managers
than Masoud. These male store managers performed substantially similar work as
Masoud. Masoud excelled as a store manager. She consistently met Defendant’s
expectations for her position. On January 12, 2023, Defendants terminated
Plaintiff's employment. Defendant told Plaintiff that they terminated Plaintiff
on the basis that she was "too young". Plaintiff's supervisor, Jake
Kim, and a marketing executive, known to Plaintiff as "Mr. Kim", told
Plaintiff that the decision to terminate her employment, and the reasoning
motivating her termination (being "too young"), came directly from
the CEO of Ceragem, J.W. Oh. This reason was false. Defendant terminated
Plaintiff on the basis of her being a Muslim female from Qatar who wore a hi
jab. Moreover, Defendant terminated Plaintiff because it favored Korean and
white male employees.
 
On March 22, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Complaint,
asserting causes of action against Defendant and Does 1-10 for:
 
1.              
Equal Pay Act
2.              
Gender Discrimination
3.              
Racial Discrimination
4.              
Religious Discrimination
5.              
National Origin Discrimination
 
The Final Status Conference is
scheduled for January 6, 2024, and the Jury Trial is scheduled for January 13,
2024.
 
Legal Standard
 
“[T]he
propounding party may move for an order compelling a further response if the
propounding party deems that . . . (1) An answer to a particular interrogatory
is evasive or incomplete[,] (2) An exercise of the option to produce documents
under Section 2030.230 is unwarranted or the required specification of those
documents is inadequate[, and/or] (3) An objection to an interrogatory is
without merit or too general.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (a).) 
 
The moving party must demonstrate a “reasonable and
good faith attempt” at an informal resolution of each issue presented. (Code
Civ. Proc., §§ 2016.040, 2030.300, subd. (b)(1).) “In lieu of a separate
statement required under the California Rules of Court, the court may allow the
moving party to submit a concise outline of the discovery request and each
response in dispute.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (b)(2).)
 
Notice
of the motion must be provided “within 45 days of the service of the verified
response, or any supplemental verified response, or on or before any specific
later date to which the propounding party and the responding party have agreed
in writing. . .” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (c).) The responding party
has the burden of justifying the objections to the requests. (Coy v. Superior Court (1962) 58 Cal.2d
210, 220-221.)
 
“The
court shall impose a monetary sanction. . . against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a further
response to interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the
sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make
the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd.
(d).)
 

Discussion 
 
Plaintiff moves the court for an order compelling Defendant
to provide further responses to Plaintiff’s Special Interrogatories, Set Two
(i.e., Nos. 26-30.) Plaintiff also seeks sanctions against Defendant in the
amount of $9,862.50.
 
Merits
 
Plaintiff’s counsel Nicholas Lynes (“Lynes”) represents as
follows: 
 
On May 2, 2024, Plaintiff served
Defendant the subject discovery. (Lynes Decl., ¶ 13.) On July 2, 2024, Mr.
Kaufman sent Defendant’s counsel a correspondence regarding Defendant’s
improper discovery objections. (Id., ¶ 14.) Defendant failed to respond
to the correspondence or meet the deadline of July 11, 2024. (Id., ¶
14.) On July 23rd, and July 24, 2024, Defendant’s counsel was emailed concerning
a future meet and confer. (Id., ¶ 15.) On July 24th, Defendant’s counsel
responded, and on July 26th, Plaintiff’s and Defendant’s counsels
telephonically met and conferred in which Defendant’s counsel agreed to provide
further responses on or before August 9th. (Id..) As of the date of this
Motion, Defendant has not provided further responses, necessitating this
Motion. (Id., ¶ 17.)
 
The requested discovery seeks the following:
 
SPECIAL INTERROGATORY NO. 27: IDENTIFY
the compensation of YOUR California located Store Managers by pay period, name,
or other identifier, position, and compensation per pay period.
 
SPECIAL INTERROGATORY NO. 28: IDENTIFY
each person employed as the store manager at the Cerritos store between January
17, 2022, and January 15, 2023.
 
SPECIAL INTERROGATORY NO. 29: IDENTIFY
each person who worked a shift at the Cerritos store between January 17, 2022,
and January 15, 2023.
 
SPECIAL INTERROGATORY NO. 30: IDENTIFY
each person who worked a shift at the Mission Viejo store between January 17,
2022, and January 15, 2023.
 
On September 6, 2024, Defendant’s counsel opposed the motion
and declared that supplemental responses were provided to Plaintiff on
September 5, 2024. It also sought sanctions in the same amount requested by
Plaintiff. Prior to filing Plaintiff’s motion, counsel for both parties met and
conferred concerning the subject discovery, In fact, it appears that
Plaintiff’s counsel invited Defendant’s counsel to further discuss resolving
the issue. (Declaration of Seunghyun Kim, Exh. B.) Nevertheless, despite this
“invitation” Plaintiff soon followed up with the instant motion.
 
The court has reviewed Defendant’s amended responses served
on September 5, 2021. It finds that Defendant has complied with its obligation of
supplement its responses. To the extent Plaintiff contends the responses are
inadequate, an additional meet and confer will be necessary. This motion could
have been avoided if the parties had continued their discussion. Instead,
Plaintiff despite inviting further discussion filed the motion. 
 
The court declines to
award sanctions, given the inability of the parties to meet their respective
obligations.
