And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Core Construction and Development's motion for determination of good faith settlement. The settlement was entered into between Core and Plaintiffs Greg Mooradian, Debra Mooradian, and the Greg and Debra Mooradian Family Trust for a total amount of $350,000. The judge found that Core's motion and supporting evidence were sufficient to support a good faith determination, as they set forth the ground of good faith and provided a brief background of the case. The judge noted that no opposition papers were filed, and therefore, the court granted Core's motion and determined that the settlement was made in good faith within the meaning of Code of Civil Procedure section 877.6, subdivision (a). As a result, all other joint tortfeasors or co-obligors are barred from any further claims against Core for equitable comparative contribution, or partial or comparative indemnity, based on comparative negligence or comparative fault.
