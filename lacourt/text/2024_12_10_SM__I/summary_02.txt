And here is a summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is that the unopposed motion to add co-defendants will be granted. The defendants are all Cucine-related entities owned by the same human, and the court believes that plaintiff is at risk of suing the wrong entity due to the defense's strategy of saying that each company is separate and apart. The court also notes that plaintiff has alleged alter ego, but the defendant has not conceded liability. The court is granting the motion to avoid potential prejudice and to allow plaintiff to serve the entities through their owner, Solati. The court also notes that defendant counsel is seeking to withdraw, and warns that if this occurs, the new entities will be in default and the existing entities will soon have their answers stricken and be placed in default.
