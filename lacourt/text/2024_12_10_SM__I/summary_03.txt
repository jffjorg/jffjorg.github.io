And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to quash service of the summons. The defendant claims he was not served personally, but the process server's declaration states that the defendant was served on September 30, 2024. The defendant's girlfriend, Sharona Cruz, declares that she and the defendant were watching TV together at the time of service, but the judge finds the process server's testimony to be more credible. The judge notes that the process server's declaration is detailed and includes descriptions of the defendant's race, height, build, and weight, which are unlikely to be ascertained through a window. The judge also finds it suspicious that the defendant never disputes the accuracy of the description. The judge concludes that the defendant was indeed served personally and denies the motion to quash. The defendant has 5 court days to answer the complaint.
