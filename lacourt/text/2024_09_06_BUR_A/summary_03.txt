And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for leave to amend the complaint. The plaintiff, Alfred William, seeks to add his wife, Lians Gasparian, as a plaintiff and assert a claim for loss of consortium. The plaintiff also seeks to add Intermountain Trailer as a defendant and assert causes of action for Negligence and Products Liability.

The judge has denied the motion to add Gasparian as a plaintiff and assert a claim for loss of consortium, finding that the claim is barred by the statute of limitations. The judge has also denied the claim that the loss of consortium was not discovered until a certain point in time, finding that the effects of the incident on the plaintiff were alleged to have been immediately apparent.

The judge has granted the motion to add Intermountain Trailer as a defendant and assert causes of action for Negligence and Products Liability, finding that the requirements of California Rules of Court, Rules 3.1324(a) and (b) are satisfied. The judge has also found that allowing the amended complaint will increase the likelihood of the case being resolved efficiently on the merits.

The judge has ordered the plaintiff to file the amended complaint within 10 days and has provided notice to all parties.
