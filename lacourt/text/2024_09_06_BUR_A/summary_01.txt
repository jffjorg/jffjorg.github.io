Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has ruled on the motion to quash service of summons brought by The Detox Stop LLC. The motion was brought to challenge the service of summons on the ground that it was not properly served. The judge found that The Detox Stop has adequately rebutted the presumption of validity created by the process server and that the declarations of the registered agent and a coworker are sufficient to demonstrate that service was not made. However, the judge also found that Ascentia has demonstrated substantial compliance with the code's requirements for service of process, resulting in actual notice to The Detox Stop. Therefore, the motion to quash service of summons is denied. The Detox Stop is ordered to file a responsive pleading within 30 days.
