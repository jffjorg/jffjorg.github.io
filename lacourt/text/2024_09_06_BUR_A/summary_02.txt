```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motions to compel further responses to discovery demands. The motion to compel further responses to SPROG Set Two is denied because it is an attempt to "restart the clock" on discovery after failing to compel further responses to SPROG Set One. The motion to compel further responses to RFPD Set Four is granted in part and denied in part. The judge finds that Plaintiff has demonstrated good cause for further production of photos/videos and metadata, but denies the request for inspection of cameras and production of documents reflecting the amount paid to independent investigators. The judge also imposes sanctions on any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a further response, unless they acted with substantial justification.
