  Order RE:
 
plaintiff’s motion to compel deposition
  attendance and testimony of plaintiff
 



 
MOVING PARTIES:              Defendants
Diffusion Pharmaceuticals, Inc., f/k/a RestorGenex Corporation, f/k/a Stratus
Media Group, Inc., Pro Sports & Entertainment, Inc., and ProElite, Inc.      

 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Plaintiff Paul Feller
Motion to Compel Deposition Attendance and Testimony of Plaintiff 
The court
considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers filed in connection with
this motion.[1] 
DISCUSSION
Defendants Diffusion Pharmaceuticals, Inc., f/k/a RestorGenex
Corporation, f/k/a Stratus Media Group, Inc., Pro Sports & Entertainment,
Inc., and ProElite, Inc. (“Defendants”) move the court for an order compelling
plaintiff Paul Feller (“Plaintiff”) to appear for and testify at deposition. 
On September 7, 2023, Defendants served Plaintiff with a Notice of
Deposition, noticing Plaintiff’s deposition for September 22, 2023.  (Ikem Decl., Ex. KK.)  Thereafter, on January 26, 2024, Defendants
served Plaintiff with a Notice of Deposition, noticing Plaintiff’s deposition
for February 9, 2024.  (Ikem Decl., Ex.
LL.)  Plaintiff objected to the notices
of deposition and did not appear for deposition.  (Ikem Decl., ¶ 29.)
In his opposition, Plaintiff does not dispute that he did not appear
for deposition, instead asserting that (1) he objected to the September 2023
Notice of Deposition on the ground that Defendants did not appear for their
depositions, (2) he objected to the February 2024 Notice of Deposition because
counsel was traveling and unavailable for deposition on that date, (3) his
counsel informed Defendants’ counsel that counsel was “[s]till waiting to hear”
about Plaintiff’s availability, but as counsel would be in trial, counsel
“figure[]d the end of March, beginning of April[,]” and (4) Defendants did not
thereafter notice Plaintiff’s deposition and therefore Plaintiff has not
refused to cooperate.  (Steiner Decl., ¶¶
3, 5-7 and Exs. 2 and 4.)  However, the
court notes that, as late as July 22, 2024, counsel for Defendants requested that
Plaintiff provide his availability for deposition.  (Ikem Decl., Ex. FF, p. 6 [“Please give
available times in August that [Plaintiff] may be deposed”].)  Plaintiff did not show that he provided his
availability for deposition after that date. 
Thus, the court finds that Defendants are entitled to an order
compelling Plaintiff to appear for and testify at deposition.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (a).)  The court therefore grants Defendants’ motion.
            The court denies Defendants’ request
for monetary sanctions against Plaintiff because their notice of motion did not
identify every person, party, and attorney against whom the sanction is sought
or specify the sanction sought as required. 
(Consolidated Memo., p. 11:15-28 [requesting sanctions for fees incurred
in preparing pending discovery motions]; Notice of Mot. to Compel Depo., p.
2:1-10; Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.040.)
 
 
 
ORDER
The court grants defendants Diffusion Pharmaceuticals, Inc., f/k/a
RestorGenex Corporation, f/k/a Stratus Media Group, Inc., Pro Sports &
Entertainment, Inc., and ProElite, Inc.’s motion to compel deposition
attendance and testimony as follows. 
The court orders plaintiff Paul Feller to appear for and testify at a
deposition to be taken by counsel for defendants Diffusion Pharmaceuticals,
Inc., f/k/a RestorGenex Corporation, f/k/a Stratus Media Group, Inc., Pro
Sports & Entertainment, Inc., and ProElite, Inc. on ________________, 2025,
at 10:00 a.m., at the offices of TroyGould PC, located at 1801 Century Park
East, 16th Floor, Los Angeles, California, 90067.
The court denies defendants Diffusion Pharmaceuticals, Inc., f/k/a
RestorGenex Corporation, f/k/a Stratus Media Group, Inc., Pro Sports &
Entertainment, Inc., and ProElite, Inc.’s request for monetary sanctions.
            The court orders defendants
Diffusion Pharmaceuticals, Inc., f/k/a RestorGenex Corporation, f/k/a Stratus
Media Group, Inc., Pro Sports & Entertainment, Inc., and ProElite, Inc. to
give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
