And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Joseph Ariel Hazani vs. Lighting Solution Development, LLC. The court has ordered that the defendant's motion to quash service of summons is stricken because the defendant is improperly representing itself in the action. The court has found that a limited liability company such as Lighting Solution Development, LLC must be represented by licensed counsel in court proceedings, and the defendant has failed to provide evidence of representation by counsel. Therefore, the court has ordered that the defendant's motion to quash service of summons is stricken and the hearing on the motion is taken off calendar.
