(2)  
Motion
to Quash Service of Summons 
ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE WHY THE COURT SHOULD
NOT STRIKE MOTION TO QUASH SERVICE OF SUMMONS
On September 14, 2023, the
court held a case management conference and issued a minute order that, inter
alia, set an Order to Show Cause re why the court should not strike the
motion to quash service of summons filed by defendant Lighting Solution
Development, LLC (“Defendant”) because Defendant is a limited liability company
that is not represented by counsel. 
(Sep. 13, 2024 Minute Order, p. 1.) 
The court ordered that any response to the Order to Show Cause shall be
filed no later than nine court days before the hearing.  (Ibid.)  On September 13, 2024, the clerk served the
court’s September 13, 2024 minute order on Defendant, at the address identified
in its court filings, and plaintiff Joseph Ariel Hazani (“Plaintiff”).  (Sep. 13, 2024 Cert. of Mailing, p. 1
[showing service on Defendant at 7889 River Hill Lane, Alexandra, Pennsylvania,
16611]; July 2, 2024 Def. Mot. to Quash, p. 1 [listing Defendant’s address to
be 7889 River Hill Lane, Alexandria, PA 16611].) 
Thereafter, on October 29,
2024, the court issued a minute order continuing the hearing on the Order to
Show Cause and Defendant’s motion to quash service of summons to December 12,
2024.  (Oct. 29, 2024 Minute Order, p.
1.)  The clerk served the October 29,
2024 minute order on Plaintiff and Defendant on that date.  (Oct. 29, 2024 Cert. of Mailing.)  Neither Plaintiff nor Defendant filed a
response to the Order to Show Cause. 
The court finds that Defendant
is improperly representing itself in this action. 
“[U]nder a long-standing
common law rule of procedure, a corporation [or a limited liability company],
unlike a natural person, cannot represent itself before courts of record in
propria persona, nor can it represent itself through a corporate officer,
director or other employee who is not an attorney.¿ It must be represented by
licensed counsel in proceedings before courts of record.”¿ (CLD
Construction, Inc. v. City of San Ramon (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 1141,
1145.)¿¿ 
Defendant is a limited
liability company.  (July 2, 2024 Def.
Mot. to Quash, p. 1 [identifying itself to be an LLC].)  Thus, Defendant is required to be represented
by counsel in this action.  (CLD
Construction, Inc., supra, 120 Cal.App.4th at p. 1145.)  However, Defendant’s court filings state that
it is representing itself in pro per through its president, David Shiller.  (July 2, 2024 Def. Mot. to Quash, p. 1; Nov.
6, 2024 Def. Response to Amended Summons and Complaint, p. 1.)  Defendant did not (1) file a Substitution of
Attorney – Civil form stating that it is now represented by counsel, or (2)
file a response to the Order to Show Cause or other evidence establishing that
it has since retained counsel. 
Thus, the court finds that
Defendant is improperly representing itself in propria persona and therefore
orders that the “Motion to Quash Service of Summons” filed by Defendant on July
2, 2024 is stricken.  (CLD
Construction, Inc., supra, 120 Cal.App.4th at p. 1145; Code Civ.
Proc., § 436, subd. (b) [court may, at any time in its discretion, strike any
pleading “not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of this
state”].)  
MOTION TO QUASH SERVICE OF SUMMONS
For the reasons set forth
above, the court has ordered that Defendant’s motion to quash service of
summons is stricken.  The court therefore
takes the hearing on Defendant’s motion off calendar. 
ORDER
            The court orders that the “Motion to
Quash Service of Summons” filed by defendant Lighting Solution Development, LLC
on July 2, 2024, is stricken.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 436, subd. (b).) 
            The court orders that the hearing on
defendant Lighting Solution Development, LLC’s motion to quash service of summons is taken off calendar. 
            The court directs the clerk to give
notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  December 12, 2024
