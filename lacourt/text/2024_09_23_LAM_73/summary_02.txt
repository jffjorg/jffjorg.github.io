Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Lan Venture Group LLC, the defendant, to the complaint filed by ILTF, Inc., the plaintiff. The judge has overruled the demurrer to the first, second, and third causes of action, which alleges breach of contract, service mark infringement, and false or misleading advertising. The judge has sustained the demurrer to the fourth and fifth causes of action, which alleges intentional and negligent misrepresentation, with 20 days leave to amend.

The judge has taken judicial notice of certain documents, including the Consent Order dated February 27, 2019, and the Tutti Frutti Franchising, Inc. Franchise Disclosure Document. The judge has also noted that the parties did not meet and confer as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41.

The judge has found that the plaintiff has adequately alleged breach of contract, service mark infringement, and false or misleading advertising. However, the judge has found that the plaintiff has not adequately alleged intentional and negligent misrepresentation, and has given the plaintiff 20 days to amend the complaint to cure these defects.
