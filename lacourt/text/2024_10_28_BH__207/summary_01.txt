And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of KPRS Construction Services, Inc. (Plaintiff) vs. Jefferson Park, LLC (Defendant) regarding a request for default judgment. The Plaintiff is seeking $360,115.87 in damages, including special damages, prejudgment interest, costs, and attorneys' fees. The Defendant was personally served with a copy of the summons and complaint on January 04, 2023, but the clerk rejected the Plaintiff's request for entry of default due to technical deficiencies.

The Judge has denied the Plaintiff's request for default judgment because the Court cannot enter default judgment until default is entered against the Defendant and the Doe defendants are dismissed. Additionally, the Court cannot analyze the Plaintiff's request for damages, prejudgment interest, and attorneys' fees because the Plaintiff has not provided the corroborating exhibits referenced in the Zwistowski Declaration, and the amount of damages requested does not match those indicated in the Zwistowski declaration.

The Judge has ordered the Plaintiff to file an amended Request for Entry of Default Judgment (Default Judgment package) in conformance with the Court's ruling on or before January 10, 2025. The Order to Show Cause re Entry of Default Judgment is continued to February 4, 2025 at 8:30 A.M. in Department 207.
