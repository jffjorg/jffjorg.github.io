And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion of the defendants (LiveOne, Inc; PodcastOne, Inc.; Slacker, Inc.; LiveXLive, Corp.; Robert Ellin; and Josh Hallbauer) to reclassify the case from unlimited to limited jurisdiction. The defendants argued that the plaintiffs' damages cannot exceed $35,000, the jurisdictional minimum for a limited civil case, because the tenant about whose conduct the plaintiffs complained has since vacated the premises, and the plaintiffs have not received any medical treatment or suffered a loss of income or earning capacity. The plaintiffs, on the other hand, argued that they seek damages for annoyance and disruption of their quiet enjoyment of their residential neighborhood, which damages are available without a showing of physical damage to their property or person. The judge found that a jury could theoretically award damages in excess of $35,000 based on the massive pre-Grammy red carpet event held at the residence next door to the plaintiffs, and therefore cannot say as a legal certainty that the verdict will necessarily be less than $35,000 to warrant reclassification.
