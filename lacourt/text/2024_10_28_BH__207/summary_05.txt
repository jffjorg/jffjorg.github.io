**Significant Statements**
```
"The Court declines Plaintiff's invitation to overlook these deficiencies, construe the demurrer as a motion for judgment on the pleadings, and analyze the merits at this time."
"Because the demurrer is untimely and the parties failed to meaningfully meet and confer, the Court declines Plaintiff's request to construe the demurrer as a motion for judgment on the pleadings, but does so without prejudice to Plaintiff's filing of any subsequent motion for judgment on the pleadings, as necessary and appropriate."
```
Here is the summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by the Plaintiff, Galina Kopelev, against the Defendant, The Churchill Condominium Association. The Plaintiff filed a complaint with 10 causes of action, and the Defendant filed an answer with 55 affirmative defenses. The Plaintiff demurred to all 55 affirmative defenses, and the Defendant opposed the demurrer.

The Court notes that the Plaintiff failed to properly meet and confer with the Defendant prior to filing the demurrer, and that the demurrer was untimely filed. Despite these deficiencies, the Court declines to construe the demurrer as a motion for judgment on the pleadings and instead overrules the demurrer in its entirety as untimely.

The Court encourages the parties to meet and confer in good faith to try to come to an agreement and potentially stipulate to an amended answer, as appropriate, to avoid expending Court resources. The Plaintiff is ordered to provide notice of the Court's ruling and file a proof of service of such.
