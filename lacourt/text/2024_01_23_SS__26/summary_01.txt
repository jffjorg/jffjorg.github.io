```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Judgment Creditor Bag Fund, Inc.'s motion to amend the renewal of judgment to correct a clerical error. The error occurred when the applicant's name was omitted from the application for renewal of judgment, despite an assignment of judgment indicating that Judgment Creditor assigned its interest in the judgment to Jason Lynn. The judge has declined to exercise its discretion to amend the renewal of judgment, citing the declaration of rescission filed by Jason Lynn, which relinquishes his interest in the judgment. The judge has also declined to consider the oppositions filed by non-parties, as they do not have standing to file oppositions.
