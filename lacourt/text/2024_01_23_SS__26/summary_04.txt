And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the Motion to Reclassify filed by Plaintiffs Erica Henderson and Jeffrey Henderson. The Motion was filed after the time allowed for amending the initial pleading and seeks to reclassify the action from unlimited to limited. The Judge has denied the Motion, finding that Plaintiffs did not provide sufficient evidence to demonstrate a possibility that their damages will exceed $25,000.00. The Judge also found that Plaintiffs did not show good cause for the timing of the request and did not provide an explanation for how they calculated their damages. Despite being provided an opportunity to file supplemental papers, Plaintiffs did not do so. The Judge has ordered that the Motion to Reclassify be denied and that the moving party give notice.
