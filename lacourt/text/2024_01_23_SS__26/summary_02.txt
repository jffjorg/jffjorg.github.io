And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer and motion to strike filed by Defendant Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. The demurrer is sustained without leave to amend as to the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth, and twelfth causes of action. The demurrer is overruled as to the eleventh cause of action.

The motion to strike is granted without leave to amend, as the request for punitive damages is not supported by the facts alleged in the complaint.

The Judge notes that the demurrer refers to the eleventh cause of action for negligence but does not address it in the demurrer itself, and therefore overrules the demurrer as to that cause of action.

The Judge also denies leave to amend the complaint, as the plaintiff has not provided any additional facts that could be alleged to amend the claims that were sustained.

The case will proceed with only the eleventh cause of action for negligence remaining.
