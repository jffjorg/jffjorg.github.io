Henderson, et al. v. Eden Iris Gardens LLC, et al.MOTION TO RECLASSIFY(CCP § 403.040)
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Plaintiffs Erica Henderson and
Jeffrey Henderson’s Motion to Reclassify is DENIED.
 
 
ANALYSIS:
 
On December 19, 2022, Plaintiffs Erica Henderson (“Plaintiff
Erica”) and Jeffrey Henderson (“Plaintiff Jeffrey”) (collectively
“Plaintiffs”), in propria persona, filed an action against Defendants Rockvale
Apartments LP (“Defendant Rockvale LP”), Rockvale Apartments GP, LLC (“Defendant
Rockvale GP”), Rockvale Apartments Limited, LLC (“Defendant Rockvale Limited”),
FPI Management[1], Inc. (“Defendant FPI”), and Eden Housing, Inc. (erroneously
sued as Eden Iris Gardens, LLC (“Defendant Eden”) for: (1) breach of implied
warranty of habitability, (2) negligence, (3) nuisance, (4) personal injury,
(5) intentional infliction of emotional distress, and (6) breach of contract.
 
Plaintiffs filed the instant Motion to
Reclassify on October 11, 2023. Defendants Eden and FPI separately filed
oppositions on December 6, 2023. The Motion initially came for hearing on
December 19, 2023 and was continued to January 23, 2024 to allow Plaintiffs to
file supplemental briefing. (Minute Order, 12/19/23.) Defendants filed
supplemental oppositions on January 16, 2024. 
 
Discussion
 
The Motion to
Reclassify is brought pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 403.040,
which allows a plaintiff to file a motion for reclassification of an action
within the time allowed for that party to amend the initial pleading. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 403.040, subd. (a).) If the motion is made after the time for the
plaintiff to amend the pleading, the motion may only be granted if (1) the case
is incorrectly classified; and (2) the plaintiff shows good cause for not
seeking reclassification earlier. (Code Civ. Proc., § 403.040, subd. (b).) In Walker
v. Superior Court (1991) 53 Cal.3d 257, 262, the California Supreme Court
held that a matter may be reclassified from unlimited to limited only if
it appears to a legal certainty that the plaintiff's damages will necessarily
be less than $25,000. (Walker v. Superior Court (1991) 53 Cal.3d 257.) 
 
In Ytuarte v.
Superior Court (2005) 129 Cal.App.4th 266, 278, the Court of Appeals
examined the principles it set forth in Walker and held that “the court should reject the plaintiff's effort to
reclassify the action as unlimited only when the lack of jurisdiction as an
“unlimited” case is certain and clear.” (Id. at 279.) Plaintiffs’ burden is to present evidence to demonstrate
a possibility that the damages will exceed $25,000.00 and the trial court must
review the record to determine “whether a judgment in excess of $25,000.00 is
obtainable.” (Ibid.) 
 
As the instant Motion was filed after the time to amend the
complaint, Plaintiffs must show both good cause for the timing of the request
and that the case is incorrectly classified. Plaintiffs mistakenly contend that
they are within the time to bring this Motion because Defendants have not yet
filed answers to the First Amended Complaint. (Motion, p. 5:11-14.) However,
good cause for the timing of the Motion must be shown if it is brought after
the time to amend the initial pleading. Plaintiffs already amended the initial
Complaint but have not provided evidence that the amount of their damages has
changed since the filing of the action in December 2022 and filing the instant
Motion almost a year later. 
 
Nor have Plaintiffs provided evidence to demonstrate a
possibility that their damages will exceed $25,000.00. Plaintiffs contend they
will amend the pleadings to update the damages amount and submit the
declaration of Plaintiff Erica, who states that they have calculated their
final damages amount at $125,000.00. (Motion, Erica Henderson Decl., ¶7.) No
explanation is provided as to how these damages were calculated, nor is the
declaration supported by exhibits demonstrating the damages Plaintiffs have incurred.
Therefore, Plaintiffs have not demonstrated a basis to reclassify the action.
The Court does note that Defendant Eden’s contention that the declaration of
Plaintiff is not sworn under penalty of perjury is incorrect. The declaration
is properly attested. (Motion, Erica Henderson Decl., p. 2.) 
 
Despite the Court providing Plaintiffs with an opportunity
to file supplemental papers addressing these deficiencies, no such papers have
been filed. Therefore, Plaintiffs have not demonstrated that reclassification
of the action is appropriate.
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiffs Erica
Henderson and Jeffrey Henderson’s Motion to Reclassify is DENIED.
 
 
Moving party to give notice.
