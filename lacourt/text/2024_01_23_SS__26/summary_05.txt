And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling strikes defendant Joseph Sguigna's motion to strike portions of the complaint and places the hearing off calendar. The motion is procedurally defective because it lacks proof of service showing that it was served on the plaintiff, a violation of statutory requirements and due process. Additionally, the defendant is in default and cannot bring the motion, as entry of default cuts off the defendant's right to take further affirmative steps such as filing a pleading or motion. The court strikes the motion on its own motion, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 436, subdivision (b).
