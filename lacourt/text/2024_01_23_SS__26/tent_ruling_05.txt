Moon v. Sguigna, et al.MOTION TO STRIKE COMPLAINT
TENTATIVE RULING: 
 
Defendant Joseph Sguigna’s Motion to Strike Portions of
Complaint is STRUCK AND THE HEARING ON THE SAME IS PLACED OFF CALENDAR.
 
 
ANALYSIS:
 
On September 27, 2023, Plaintiff Doo H. Moon (“Plaintiff”)
filed the instant action for breach of lease agreement against Defendant Joseph
Sguigna (“Defendant”). Following Defendant’s failure to file a responsive
pleading, the Court entered their default on November 27, 2023. Default
Judgment was entered on December 6, 2023.
 
Defendant filed the instant Motion to Strike Portions of the
Complaint on December 21, 2023. No opposition has been filed to date. 
 
The Motion to Strike is
procedurally defective. First, the Motion is not accompanied by any proof of
service showing it was served on Plaintiff. Failure to give notice of a motion
is not only a violation of the statutory requirements but of due process. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1005; Jones v. Otero (1984) 156 Cal.App.3d 754, 757.)
Furthermore, Defendant is in default and cannot bring the instant Motion. Entry of default cuts off the
defendant's right to take further affirmative steps such as filing a pleading
or motion. (Sporn v. Home Depot USA, Inc. (2005) 126 Cal.App.4th 1294,
1301.)
 
Therefore, the Court strikes the Motion to Strike on
its own motion, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 436, subdivision
(b) and places the hearing on the Motion to Strike off calendar. 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant Joseph Sguigna’s Motion
to Strike Portions of Complaint is STRUCK AND THE HEARING ON THE SAME IS PLACED
OFF CALENDAR. 
 
 
 
Court clerk to give notice.
