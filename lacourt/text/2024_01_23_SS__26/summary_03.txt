And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Defendant William Reyes' Motion to Vacate Default and Default Judgment; and Quash Service of Summons. The motion was filed late, and the supporting declaration does not show that the defendant's lack of actual notice was not caused by avoidance of service or inexcusable neglect. Additionally, the declaration does not state that the defendant lacked actual notice of the action. The Judge also notes that the motion cites Civil Code section 1788.61, which only pertains to an "action brought by a debt buyer" and does not apply to this action.
