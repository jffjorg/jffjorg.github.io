L&J Assets, LLC v. Alexander, et al.MOTION
TO AMEND RENEWAL OF JUDGMENT 
TO
CORRECT CLERICAL ERROR
(CCP
§§ 473(d), 187)
TENTATIVE RULING: 
 
Judgment Creditor Bag Fund, Inc.’s Motion to Amend Renewal
of Judgment is DENIED.
 
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
This collections action was filed on May 3, 2005 by
Plaintiff L&J Assets, LLC (“Plaintiff’) against Defendant Helen L.
Alexander (“Defendant”). Default judgment was entered against Defendant on
January 9, 2006. Notice of Assignment of Judgment from Plaintiff to Bag Fund,
LLC was filed on September 21, 2009; the judgment was then assigned from Bag
Fund, LLC to Bag Fund, Inc. (“Judgment Creditor”), on December 21, 2011. 
 
On December 18, 2012, the Court granted Judgment Creditor’s
Application for an Order for Sale of Real Property with respect to 8943 Telfair
Avenue, Sun Valley, California (“the Property”) in order to satisfy the
judgment. On March 21, 2014, an Assignment of Judgment and Acknowledgment of
Assignment of Judgment was filed assigning the judgment to Jason Lynn (“Lynn”).
The judgment was then renewed on October 14, 2014, pursuant to an application
filed by only by Judgment Creditor.
 
On July 20, 2020, the case was reassigned to the Limited
Jurisdiction Court, Department 26 of the Spring Street Courthouse. On April 30,
2021, the Court denied the motion of non-party Narek Aroutynyan (“Aroutynyan”) for
leave to intervene. (Minute Order, 04/30/21.) 
 
Notices of
Related Case were also filed with respect to this case in In Re Alexander
James, LASC Case No. 17STPB08246 and Aroutynyan v. Bag Fund, Inc.,
LASC Case No. 21STCV22192. (Notices of Related Case, filed 08/23/21 and
10/04/21.) Both Notices of Related Cases were subsequently denied. (Minute
Orders, 11/22/21 and 12/08/21.) On August 18, 2023, the Court denied Judgment
Creditor’s ex parte application for an order transferring the case to the
Chatsworth Collections Hub. (Minute Order, 08/18/23.) 
 
Judgment
Creditor filed the instant Motion to Amended Renewal of Judgment to Correct
Clerical Error on August 22, 2023. Non-parties Amwest Funding Corporation
(“Amwest”) filed an opposition on October 25, 2023; Aroutynyan filed an
opposition October 30, 2023. On November 1, 2023, Judgment Creditor filed a
Declaration of Recission; Judgment Creditor also filed an Application for and
Renewal of Judgment on January 11, 2024. 
 
Discussion
 
Judgment Creditor moves to amend
the renewal of judgment entered on October 14, 2014, pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 473, subdivision (d) or section 187. An amendment to the
renewal of judgment under Code of Civil Procedure section 187 is typically done
to bring in an alter ego of the judgment debtor, as in the cases cited by
Judgment Creditor: Highland Springs Conference & Training Center v. City
of Banning (2016) 244 Cal.App.4th 267, 273 and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v.
Weinberg (2014) 227 Cal.App.4th 1, 3. It does not appear that Code of Civil
Procedure section 187 is an appropriate vehicle by which to correct a clerical
error in a renewal of judgment. However, Code of Civil Procedure section 473,
subdivision (d) provides that the court may “correct clerical mistakes in its
judgments or orders as entered, so as to conform to the judgment or order
directed . . . .” (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (d).)
 
Judgment Creditor moves to amend the renewal of judgment to correct the
applicant’s name from “Bag Fund, Inc.” to “Bag Fund, Inc. and Jason Lynn.”
(Motion, p. 7:18.) The request is brought on the grounds that an assignment of
judgment was filed with the Court on March 21, 2014 indicating that Judgment
Creditor assigned its “right, title and interest” in the judgment in favor of
Jason Lynn, with Judgment Creditor to maintain responsibility for collection
and servicing of the judgment. (Assignment of Judgment, filed 03/21/14.) The
application for renewal of judgment, however, omitted “Jason Lynn” from the applicant’s
name, in error. (Application for Renewal, filed 10/14/14, ¶1.) 
 
Non-parties Artounynyan and Amwest filed oppositions to the
instant Motion on the grounds that they are parties “in the related case Aroutynyan
v. Bag Fund, Inc., et al., LASC Case No. 21STCV22192 (the “Aroutynyan
case”). (Artounynyan Opp., p. 2:1-4; Amwest Opp., p. 1:25-26.) Although Artounynyan
and Amwest characterize the Aroutynyan case as “related” to this action,
it is not. The notice of related case was denied on December 8, 2021. Nor have Artounynyan
and Amwest otherwise shown they have standing to file oppositions to the
instant Motion. Therefore, the Court will not consider the oppositions. 
 
Despite filing the instant Motion to amend, on multiple
dates, Judgment Creditor also filed “Notice and Declaration of Rescission
and/or Withdrawal of Assignment of Judgment Acknowledged on March 10, 2014.” (Notice
and Declaration of Recission, filed 07/26/23, 08/15/23, 11/01/23.) The
declaration of rescission was signed by Lynn on August 31, 2017 and states that
Lynn “hereby relinquishes and returns any and all equitable rights and interest
he may have in said judgment to Bag Fund, Inc.” (Ibid. at pp. 1-2.) The
Motion does not address the significance of the declaration of rescission. Yet
it seems to the Court that amending the renewal of judgment to add Lynn as an
applicant at this date, years after it was filed and years after Lynn had
rescinded his interest in the judgment, serves no purpose. Although Judgment
Creditor was erroneously stated to be the applicant, it now holds all interest
in the judgment, as it did up until March 21, 2014. Indeed, in the Application
for and Renewal of Judgment filed by Judgment Creditor on January 11, 2024, the
application is again listed only as “Bag Fund, Inc.” (App. For Renewal, filed
01/11/24, ¶1.)
 
Therefore, the Court declines to exercise its discretion to
amend the renewal of judgment at this time.
 
Conclusion
 
Judgment Creditor Bag Fund, Inc.’s Motion to Amend Renewal
of Judgment is DENIED.
 
 
Court clerk to give notice.
