The court has reviewed the unopposed Motion to be Relieved as Counsel for Plaintiff Juan Luis Lopez Aguilar, and finds that the motion complies with the California Rules of Court.

Due to the lack of cooperation and communication, the attorney is unable to provide discovery responses and is seeking to be relieved as counsel. The court grants the motion and orders Friedman & Chapman, LLP to give notice. The effective date of the order relieving counsel will be upon the filing of proof of service of this signed order upon the Plaintiff.
