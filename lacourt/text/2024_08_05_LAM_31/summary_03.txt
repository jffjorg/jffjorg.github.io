And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge, Kerry Bensinger, has issued a tentative ruling granting the Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel filed by Brian Brumfield, counsel for Defendants Yeezy LLC, Donda Academy, Inc., and Kanye West aka Ye. The Motion was filed on July 10, 2024, and is unopposed. The Judge has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw, and the Motion complies with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362. The reason for the withdrawal is that the Defendants terminated their relationship with Brian Brumfield on June 21, 2024, and will not communicate with him or pay him. The Judge finds that there is no prejudice to the client and that the withdrawal will not disrupt the orderly process of justice. The Motion is granted and effective upon the filing of the proof of service of this signed order upon the Defendants. The court sets a Status Conference re: Counsel for Defendants for September 20, 2024.
