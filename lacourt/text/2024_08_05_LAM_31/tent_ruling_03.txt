MOTION
TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL



 
MOVING PARTY:               Brian Brumfield,
The Brumfield Law Group
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     No opposition
 
 
I.          INTRODUCTION
 
            On July 10,
2024, Brian Brumfield, counsel for Defendants, Yeezy LLC, Donda Academy, Inc.,
and Kanye West aka Ye, filed this Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel.  
 
On July 12, 2024, counsel for Defendants filed an ex parte
application to shorten time for the hearing on this motion.  The court granted the ex parte application on
July 24, 2024. 
 
            On July 29,
2024, counsel for Defendant re-filed this Motion and provided proof of service
of the court’s July 24, 2024 order shortening time on the hearing.
 
            The Motion
is unopposed.
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARD
California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362 (Motion to Be
Relieved as Counsel) requires (1) notice of motion and motion to be directed to
the client (made on the Notice of Motion and Motion to be Relieved as
Counsel—Civil form (MC-051)); (2) a declaration stating in general terms and
without compromising the confidentiality of the attorney-client relationship
why a motion under Code of Civil Procedure section 284(2) is brought instead of
filing a consent under Code of Civil Procedure section 284(1) (made on the
Declaration in Support of Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil
form (MC-052)); (3) service of the notice of motion and motion and declaration
on all other parties who have appeared in the case; and (4) the proposed order
relieving counsel (prepared on the Order Granting Attorney's Motion to Be
Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-053)).  
 
The court
has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw, and such a motion should be
granted provided that there is no prejudice to the client, and it does not
disrupt the orderly process of justice.  (See Ramirez v. Sturdevant
(1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915.)¿
III.      DISCUSSION
 
            Brian Blumfield seeks to be relieved
as counsel of record for Defendants for the following reasons: “Defendants, Yeezy
LLC Donda Academy and Kanye West, terminated relationship on 6/21/2024. Defendants
also will not speak to counsel and Defendants refuse to pay counsel as well.”  (Form MC-052.)    
 
Absent a showing
of resulting prejudice, an attorney’s request for withdrawal should be
granted.  (People v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398,
406.)¿¿ 
 
Upon review, the
court finds that the Motion complies with California Rules of Court, rule
3.1362. 
 
IV.        CONCLUSION
            
Accordingly, the Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel is GRANTED
and effective upon the filing of the proof of service of this signed order upon
Defendants.
 
The court sets a Status Conference re: Counsel for
Defendants for September 20, 2024.
 
Counsel to give notice.
