And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is in response to a demurrer to the Complaint and a motion to quash service of summons. The Complaint alleges that Defendant Jae Hueng Rye aka Joseph Ryu misappropriated trade secrets from Plaintiff Sky Express World Courier, Inc. The moving defendants, Salt International Co., LTD, Jihyun Seo, Daeyoung Kim, and One Road USA, Inc., demurred to the Complaint, arguing that it fails to state sufficient facts against them. The Judge sustained the demurrer, stating that the Complaint is insufficient to state any claims against the moving defendants, and ordered the Plaintiff to file a First Amended Complaint within 30 days.

Defendant Gyumgyeong Chae moved to quash service of summons, arguing that the service was ineffective because he is not a resident of California and was served at an address that is not his usual place of business. The Judge denied the motion, finding that the service was effective because Chae's usual place of business is at the address where he was served, and he was served as the CEO of One Road USA, Inc. that operates at that address.

The Judge also noted that the Hague Service Convention does not apply in this case, and that the Plaintiff has demonstrated that Chae's usual place of business is at the address where he was served, making the service effective.
