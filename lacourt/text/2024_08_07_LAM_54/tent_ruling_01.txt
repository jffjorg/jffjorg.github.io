BACKGROUND
 
 This is a lemon law action arising out
of Plaintiff Daniel Meza’s purchase of a 2022 Honda Accord manufactured and
distributed by Defendant American Honda Motor Co., Inc.  On May 22, 2023, Plaintiff sued Defendant
asserting causes of action for (1) violation of Song-Beverly Act – Breach of
Express Warranty; and (2) fraudulent inducement – concealment.
 
Defendant moves for
summary adjudication on the second cause of action. 
 
 
ANALYSIS
 
The function of a
motion for summary judgment or adjudication is to allow a determination as to
whether an opposing party cannot show evidentiary support for a pleading or
claim and to enable an order of summary dismissal without the need for trial.  (Aguilar
v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843).  In analyzing such motions, courts must apply a
three-step analysis: “(1) identify the issues framed by the pleadings; (2)
determine whether the moving party has negated the opponent's claims; and (3)
determine whether the opposition has demonstrated the existence of a triable,
material factual issue.”  (Hinesley v. Oakshade Town Center (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th
289, 294).  Thus, summary judgment or summary adjudication is granted
when, after the Court’s consideration of the evidence set forth in the papers
and all reasonable inferences accordingly, no triable issues of fact exist and
the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  (Code Civ.
Pro., § 437c(c); Villa v. McFarren (1995) 35 Cal.App.4th
733, 741). 
 
As to each claim as
framed by the complaint, the party moving for summary judgment or summary
adjudication must satisfy the initial burden of proof by presenting facts to
negate an essential element.  (Scalf v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th
1510, 1520).  Courts “liberally construe
the evidence in support of the party opposing summary judgment and resolve
doubts concerning the evidence in favor of that party.”  (Dore v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc.¿(2006) 39
Cal.4th 384, 389).  A motion for summary judgment
or summary adjudication must be denied where the moving party's evidence does
not prove all material facts, even in the absence of any opposition or where
the opposition is weak.  (See Leyva
v. Superior Court (1985) 164 Cal.App.3d 462, 475; Salesguevara v. Wyeth Labs., Inc. (1990) 222 Cal.App.3d
379, 384, 387.   
 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 437c, subdivision (h), provides, in relevant part:
“If it appears from the affidavits submitted in opposition to a motion for
summary judgment or summary adjudication, or both, that facts essential to
justify opposition may exist but cannot, for reasons stated, be presented, the
court shall deny the motion, order a continuance to permit affidavits to be
obtained or discovery to be had, or make any other order as may be just.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (h).) 
“A party seeking continuance or denial of a motion under [Code of Civil
Procedure] section 437c, subdivision (h) must show that the facts to be
obtained are essential to opposing the motion, that there is reason to believe
such facts may exist, and that additional time is needed to obtain these
facts.”  (501 East 51st Street, Long Beach-10 LLC v. Kookmin Best
Insurance Co., Ltd. (2020) 47 Cal.App.5th 924, 939.)   
 
Plaintiff
contends that facts essential to justify opposition to Defendant’s motion for
summary adjudication exist but cannot be presented.  Plaintiff provides the affidavit of his
counsel, who states that Plaintiff has not yet had the opportunity to depose
Defendant’s PMQ witness despite Plaintiff’s attempts to schedule the
deposition. (Affidavit of Timonthy Lupinek ¶ 2-5, 8.)  The deposition will address the allegedly
defective collision mitigation braking system and Defendant’s knowledge of the
defects.  (Id. at ¶ 6.)  It may reveal essential evidence that
Plaintiff needs to oppose Defendant’s motion. Plaintiff has shown the motion
should be denied pursuant to Code
of Civil Procedure section 437c, subdivision (h).[1]  
 
Defendant also argues that Plaintiff’s fraudulent inducement/concealment claim fails under the
economic loss doctrine. Defendant is incorrect. “Simply stated, the¿economic¿loss¿rule¿provides: ‘[W]here a purchaser's
expectations in a sale are frustrated because the product he bought is not
working properly, his remedy is said to be in contract alone, for he has
suffered only ‘economic’¿losses.”’  (Robinson
Helicopter Co. v. Dana Corp. (2004) 34 Cal. 4th 979, 988.)  “The economic loss rule requires a purchaser
to recover in contract for purely¿economic¿loss¿due to disappointed
expectations, unless he can demonstrate harm above and beyond a broken
contractual promise.”  (Id.¿
(citations omitted).  However, when a
person makes affirmative misrepresentations that induces another party into a
contract, the economic loss rule does not prevent that party from alleging both
a contract and a tort claim.  (Id.
at 991.) 
 
Robinson did not address a
cause of action for fraudulent concealment. The court stated its holding was
“narrow in scope and limited to a defendant's affirmative misrepresentations on
which a plaintiff relies and which expose a plaintiff to liability for personal
damages¿independent of the plaintiff's¿economic loss.”  (Robinson,¿supra, 34 Cal.4th at
pp. 991, 993.)¿¿But this does not mean the economic loss rule applies to
fraudulent concealment. The court in Dhital v. Nissan North America, Inc.
held that the economic loss rule does not bar a claim for fraudulent inducement
by concealment.  (Dhital v. Nissan
North America (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 828, 841-843.)  The California Supreme Court recently granted
review in Dhital, but the appellate decision has not been de-published
and it may be cited for its persuasive value. 
(See
Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 8.1115(e)(1).)  The Court finds that Dhital
is persuasive in this case.
