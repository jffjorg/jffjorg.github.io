And here is the summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant's demurrer to the complaint is sustained with 30 days leave to amend. The motion to strike is denied as moot. The court finds that the plaintiff has failed to state claims for fraud, strict liability, breach of contract, and conversion. The court also finds that the allegations of harassment, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and invasion of privacy are insufficient to state a cause of action. The court denies the defendant's motion to strike, finding that it is moot.
