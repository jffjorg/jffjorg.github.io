Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court denies Defendant's motion for summary adjudication on the second cause of action, which is a claim for fraudulent inducement/concealment. The Court finds that Plaintiff has shown that facts essential to opposing the motion exist but cannot be presented at this time, and therefore, the motion should be denied under Code of Civil Procedure section 437c, subdivision (h). The Court also finds that the economic loss rule does not apply to Plaintiff's claim, and that the claim is not barred by the rule. The Court relies on the persuasive value of the appellate decision in Dhital v. Nissan North America, Inc. (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 828, 841-843, which held that the economic loss rule does not bar a claim for fraudulent inducement by concealment.
