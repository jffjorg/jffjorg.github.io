The court finds that the plaintiff's responses were evasive and insufficient, and grants the motion. The court orders the plaintiff to provide full, complete, and verified responses and pay imposed monetary sanctions in the amount of $661.65 within 10 days of the date of this order. The court also finds that the plaintiff's responses fail to comply with the California Code of Civil Procedure, and therefore, sanctions are warranted.
