Litberg (Defendants) to vacate the default and default judgment entered against them.

The Judge finds that the Defendants have shown entitlement to the relief sought and that the motion was filed within the time limits specified in California law. The Judge grants the motion, allowing the Defendants to file an answer or other pleading and seek relief from the default and default judgment.
