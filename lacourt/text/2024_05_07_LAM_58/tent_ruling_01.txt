This is a lemon law action arising from Plaintiff Danya
Campbell’s lease of a 2018 BMW 530e. (Complaint ¶ 6.) This matter came on for
trial on March 13, 2023, and the jury rendered its verdict on March 24, 2023,
finding in Plaintiff’s favor on the implied warranty claim in the amount of
$10,882.47.
On July 12, 2023, this court denied Plaintiff’s motion for
new trial. On January 10, 2024, this court denied Plaintiff’s motion to
invalidate Defendant’s section 998 offer. Plaintiff’s motion for attorney fees
was granted on March 11, 2024, in the amount of $37,589.50, with costs in the
amount of $3,911.48.
Defendant filed a memorandum of costs seeking a total
$41,586.65 on February 20, 2024. Plaintiff filed the present motion to tax
costs on March 7, 2024. Defendant filed an opposition on April 24, and
Plaintiff filed a reply on April 30, 2024.
Legal Standard
“Any notice of motion to
strike or to tax costs must be served and filed 15 days after service of the
cost memorandum. If the cost memorandum was served by mail, the period is
extended as provided in Code of Civil Procedure section 1013. If the cost memorandum
was served electronically, the period is extended as provided in Code of Civil
Procedure section 1010.6(a)(4).” (California Rules of Court Rule 3.1700, subd.
(b)(1).) 
“Code of Civil Procedure section 1032,
subdivision (b) [], guarantees prevailing parties in civil litigation awards of
the costs expended in the litigation: ‘Except as otherwise expressly provided
by statute, a prevailing party is entitled as a matter of right to recover
costs in any action or proceeding.’” (Williams v. Chino Valley Independent
Fire Dist. (“Williams”) (2015) 61
Cal.4th 97, 100.).
“If the items on a verified cost bill appear
proper charges, they are prima facie evidence that the costs, expenses and
services therein listed were necessarily incurred.” (Rappenecker v. Sea-Land Service, Inc. (1979) 93 Cal.App.3d 256,
266.) Although individual cost items are ordinarily challenged by a motion to
tax costs, no cost-item is effectively put in issue by “mere statements”
claiming them to be unreasonable. (Ibid.)
However, where “it cannot be determined from the face of the cost bill whether
the items are proper,” “the mere filing of a motion to tax costs may be a
‘proper objection’ to an item.” (Nelson
v. Anderson (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 111, 131, 132.)
Analysis
Defendant has filed a
costs memorandum seeking a total of $41,586.24 in costs. Defendant is entitled
to costs under Code of Civil Procedure § 998, having served an offer under that
section for $22,736.02 on September 16, 2021, which was greater than
Plaintiff’s ultimate recovery amounting to $10,882.47. (See Code Civ.
Proc. § 998, subd. (c)(1).) The court determined this offer to be valid in its
order of January 10, 2024, denying Plaintiff’s motion to invalidate the offer.
Plaintiff presents a
number of objections to these cost items, which are discussed in turn below.
Plaintiff argues that
of the $2,026.96 sought in filing fees, that only one item charged by Defendant
— a $61.65 fee dated June 5, 2023 for a motion for judgment notwithstanding the
verdict — constitutes a compensable cost under Code of Civil Procedure §
1033.5, subd. 9a)(1). Plaintiff argues that the remainder of the charges
identified in Defendant’s Attachment 1g are not filing fees. (Motion at pp.
3–4.)
Plaintiff’s argument
is unpersuasive, as the fees identified in attachment 1g are compensable as
electronic filing fees under Code of Civil Procedure § 1033.5, subd.
(a)(14), which renders such fees compensable “if a court requires or orders
electronic filing or service of documents.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 1033.5, subd.
(a)(14).) Such an order is in effect at this court. (See LASC Local Rule
3.4, subd. (a).) Moreover, the two largest charges in the cost memo’s
filing-fee section are, as explained by Defendant in opposition, the fees
charged by Defendant’s electronic filing service for posting jury fees, which
include the amounts of the jury fees themselves. (Opposition at p. 3; Costs
Memo Att. 1g invoices; see 3/21/2023 and 3/24/2023 Notices of Posting
Trial Fees.) These costs too are compensable under Code of Civil Procedure §
1033.5, subd. (a)(1).
Plaintiff argues that
none of Defendant’s claimed $14,451.65 in deposition costs should be awarded.
(Motion at pp. 4–5.) Plaintiff notes that nine of the eleven depositions cited
in the costs memo were noticed and taken by Plaintiff, not Defendant. (Motion
at pp. 4–5.) Plaintiff also argues that the section 998 offer, which marked the
starting point from which costs may be sought, was served on the eve of
Plaintiff’s deposition, without sufficient time for Plaintiff and counsel to
confer as to its merits, meaning the $1,982.30 charge for Plaintiff’s
deposition ought to be excluded. (Motion at p. 4.) Plaintiff further argues
that the $7,267.70 charge for the deposition of Plaintiff’s expert William
Charles Zimmer contains excessive, extraneous charges merely for the
convenience of Defendant’s counsel. (Motion at pp. 4–5.)
Plaintiff’s arguments
as to the deposition costs are unpersuasive. Defendant is expressly permitted
to claim costs associated with the depositions noticed by Plaintiff. (See Code
Civ. Proc. § 1033.5, subd. (a)(a)(A) [compensable deposition costs include “an
original and one copy of those taken by the claimant and one copy of
depositions taken by the party against whom costs are allowed”].) That is what
Defendant seeks with respect to nine out of the eleven depositions here. And
the fact that Defendant’s expert did not rely on these depositions does not mean
that Defendant sought its own copies unreasonably.
Moreover, Plaintiff
offers no authority for the proposition that her own deposition cannot be
considered a “postoffer” costs under section 998, when that deposition occurred
the day after the offer was sent. Defendant is entitled to costs incurred after
the offer was made, not only to those incurred after a sufficient amount of
time has passed for the receiving party to evaluate the offer. (Code Civ. Proc.
§ 998, subd. (c)(1).)
However, certain
costs associated with the Zimmer deposition are properly taxed. The bulk of the
cost associated with a that deposition — $5,311.70 — is not improper, but was
evidently the result of a deposition divided into separate “A.M.” and “P.M.” sessions.
(Costs Memo Att. 4e.) The remaining charges, however, for “rough draft[s]” of
both sessions, “litigation services & logistics,” “professional
attendance,” and “virtual services,” are unexplained and amount to $1,956.00 of
the charges incurred. Thus $1,956.00 of this charge is properly taxed.
Plaintiff next
objects to the $2,022.60 sought by Defendant in connection with “models,
enlargements, and photocopies of exhibits.” (Motion at pp. 5–6.) Plaintiff
argues that $49.61 of the costs sought were incurred after trial ended. (Motion
at p. 5.) Plaintiff also argues that these costs were merely for the
convenience of counsel, and not reasonably necessary. (Motion at pp. 5–6.)
There is little basis to conclude that the bulk of these exhibit
charges were only for the convenience of Defendant’s counsel, as the
preparation of exhibits for trial was a necessary aspect of the defense.
Moreover, Defendant in opposition identifies the costs that Plaintiff
challenges as post-trial expenses as being costs incurred for delivering
exhibits to the court during trial. (Lee Decl. ¶ 16.) Defendant is entitled to
the fees for the preparation of these exhibits, although those charges associated
with their messenger delivery — amounting to $382.35 — are separate and
taxable. (See Doe v. Los Angeles County Dept. of Children & Family
Services (2019) 37 Cal.App.5th 675, 696.) Thus $382.35 is taxed.
Plaintiff’s objections
to the $13,369.46 in court reporter fees are unpersuasive, as they rest on the
erroneous assumption that only court-ordered reporter fees are compensable.
(Motion at p. 6.) Section 1033.5 authorizes “[c]ourt reporter fees as established
by statute.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 1033.5, subd. (a)(11; Gov. Code § 68086, subd.
(c).) Plaintiff relies on the provision of Code of Civil Procedure § 1033.5
prohibiting cost awards for “[t]ranscripts of court proceedings not ordered by
the court.” (Motion at p. 6.; Code Civ. Proc. § 1033.5, subd. (b0(5).) However,
most of “[t]hese charges are not for transcripts. They are for court reporter
fees, an entirely different expense. The parties have to pay the court reporter
regardless of whether anyone orders transcripts.” (Chaaban v. Wet Seal, Inc.
(2012) 203 Cal.App.4th 49, 58.) Only one $186 charge for a certified copy of a
transcript of the final status conference fits within the ambit of the
prohibitory provision cited by Plaintiff. (Costs Memo Att. 12c.) Thus this $186
charge is taxed. 
 
Plaintiff objects to various costs associated
with electronic filing and service. (Opposition at pp. 6–7.) These include $275
charged for serving courtesy copies upon the court, $141 to electronically
serve documents between the parties, $257 to serve a subpoena, and $91.60 to
download documents from the court website. Plaintiff is correct that the costs
for service are not recoverable, because fees “for the electronic filing or
service of documents” is compensable only “if a court requires or orders electronic
filing or service of documents.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 1033.5, subd. (a)(14).)
Here, this court requires electronic filing, but not electronic service. (See
LASC Local Rule 3.4, subd. (a).) Accordingly, $764.60 is taxed from
this category.
 
Plaintiff finally objects to various “other” costs
sought in the costs memo. “Where costs are not expressly allowed by the
statute, the burden is on the party claiming the costs to show that the charges
were reasonable and necessary.” (Foothill-De Anza Community College Dist. v.
Emerich (2007) 158 Cal.App.4th 11, 29.) Plaintiff here objects to
Defendant’s claimed costs for mediation, meals, messengers, service of a
subpoena, outside counsel fees, an easel for trial, and parking and mileage
fees for trial. 
The mediation costs ($2,400) and service of
subpoena ($210) are justified as proper costs. As Plaintiff notes, even fees
for unsuccessful mediations may be compensable when the mediation was
court-ordered, as the mediations were here. (Motion at p. 8, citing Gibson
v. Bobroff (1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 1202, 1209.) Defendant in
opposition justifies the expense to subpoena Plaintiff’s expert based on the
belated disclosure by Plaintiff that they did not intend for their expert to be
present at trial. (Lee Decl. ¶ 21.)
The remaining “other” costs are properly taxed.
The expenses for meals would have been incurred absent this litigation, and the
$379.26 sought for their reimbursement are properly taxed. Likewise, “[r]outine
expenses for local travel by attorneys or other firm employees are not
reasonably necessary to the conduct of litigation.” (Ladas v. California
State Auto. Assn. (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761, 775–776.) Thus the $917.08 for
parking and mileage related to trial is properly taxed. Defendant also does not
justify the $215 in messenger services, save to cite one charge for retrieving
materials from the courthouse. (Opposition at pp. 13–14.) Defendant
offers no authority for its claiming of $4,484.00 in attorney fees for
consulting with corporate counsel related to Plaintiff’s post-trial motions,
and these costs are also taxable. Finally, Defendant does not justify the
$50.90 charged for the purchase of an easel for use at trial. Accordingly, $6,046.24
is properly taxed from these “other” costs.
In
summary, Plaintiff’s motion to tax costs is granted in part, and $9,335.19 in
costs are deducted from the costs award, yielding a total cost award payable by
Plaintiff to Defendant of $32,251.66.
 
The
parties are ordered to meet and confer to reconcile the fee and cost awards the
Court has made to each side.
