And here is the English-text summary:

The court denied the defendants' motion to bifurcate the trial into two phases, one for liability and another for damages. The defendants argued that bifurcation would promote efficiency by potentially eliminating the need for a damages phase, but the court found that the defendants' case for efficiency depended entirely on a verdict in their favor in the liability phase. The court also found that bifurcation would likely increase the burden of trial on all parties, the court, and the jury. The defendants also argued that the introduction of new defendant Natural Hair Productions should delay the ruling on the motion to bifurcate, but the court found that the showing made in the motion did not support this argument.
