And here is the English text summary:

The Tentative Ruling is granting Defendant Martin's motion to appoint an appraiser and referee in a real property case. The case involves a dispute between Plaintiff Edward Chappell and Defendant Martin Chappell, who are siblings and co-owners of a property. Martin seeks to buy out Edward's interest in the property and have a referee determine offsets for his overpayment of mortgage, taxes, and insurance. The Court finds that the property is "heirs property" under the Uniform Partition of Heirs Property Act, which governs the partition of real property held in tenancy in common. The Court appoints Kevin J. Howell as the appraiser and Matthew L. Taylor as the referee to determine the value of the property and resolve the dispute.
