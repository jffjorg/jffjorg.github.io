Summary:

The Judge issues a tentative ruling on a motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories filed by the Plaintiff, G&P Group, Inc. against the Defendant, City National Bank.

The Judge grants the motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories, ordering the Defendant to provide verified, code-compliant responses without objections within 30 days.

The Judge finds that the Defendant's responses to the special interrogatories are insufficient and that the Plaintiff is entitled to a more detailed response.
