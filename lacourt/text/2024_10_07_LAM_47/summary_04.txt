And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer to the first amended complaint filed by Plaintiff Troy Williams against Defendants Ralphs Grocery Co., The Kroger Company, and Kirk Reynolds. The demurrer was filed on the basis that the complaint does not state a cause of action and is barred by res judicata.

The Judge has sustained the demurrer to the fourth cause of action for unfair competition, finding that it is barred by res judicata and cannot be cured by amendment.

The Judge has overruled the demurrer to the first three causes of action, finding that they are not barred by res judicata and can proceed to trial.

The Judge has granted Defendants' requests for judicial notice of certain documents and evidence, including the prior jury verdict and judgment.

The Judge has denied Plaintiff's requests for judicial notice of certain trial transcripts and the Court's prior ruling on the Motion for Sanctions.

The Judge has ordered that the parties give notice of the tentative ruling and that any party may submit on the ruling by contacting the courtroom via email by a certain deadline.

The Judge has also warned that if a party submits on the tentative ruling, they will be deemed to have waived their right to be present at the hearing, and the court may issue an order that modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
