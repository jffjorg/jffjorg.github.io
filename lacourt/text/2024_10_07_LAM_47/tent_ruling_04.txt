CASE
HISTORY:
·        
03/18/24: Complaint filed. 
·        
08/23/24: First Amended Complaint filed. 
 
STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is an action for defamation and unfair business practices. Plaintiff
was terminated in December 2010 for allegedly stealing six bottles of lemonade.
In 2012, Plaintiff filed the action Willams v. Ralphs Grocery Co. LASC
Case No. BC495977, which concluded with a jury verdict in Plaintiff’s favor,
with judgment entered on January 11, 2024. Plaintiff alleges that, during the
pendency of that proceeding, Defendants continued to defame him by communicating
to others that he was a thief. 
 
Defendants demur to the first
amended complaint in its entirety. 
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
            Defendants’
Demurrer to the First Amended Complaint is SUSTAINED without leave to
amend as to the fourth cause of action and otherwise OVERRULED. 
 
DISCUSSION:
 
Defendants demur to the first
amended complaint in its entirety.

Legal Standard
 
A demurrer tests whether the
complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147
Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations
liberally and in context. (Taylor v. City of Los Angeles Dept. of Water and
Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228.) In a demurrer proceeding, the
defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial
notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968,
994.) “A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other
extrinsic matters. Therefore, it lies only where the defects appear on the face
of the pleading or are judicially noticed.” (SKF Farms v. Superior Court
(1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 902, 905.) “The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing
is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters,
states a cause of action.” (Hahn, supra, 147 Cal.App.4th at p. 747.) The
ultimate facts alleged in the complaint must be deemed true, as well as all
facts that may be implied or inferred from those expressly alleged. (Marshall
v. Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1397, 1403; see also Shields
v. County of San Diego (1984) 155 Cal.App.3d 103, 133 [stating, “[o]n
demurrer, pleadings are read liberally and allegations contained therein are
assumed to be true”].) “This rule of liberal construction means that the
reviewing court draws inferences favorable to the plaintiff, not the
defendant.” (Perez v. Golden Empire Transit Dist. (2012) 209 Cal.App.4th
1228, 1238.) 
 
Meet and Confer
 
Before filing a demurrer, the
demurring party shall meet and confer in person or by telephone with the party
who has filed the pleading subject to the demurrer and file a declaration
detailing their meet and confer efforts.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41(a).)
However, an insufficient meet and confer process is not grounds
to overrule or sustain a demurrer.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
430.41(a)(4).)
 
The Declaration of Defendants’
counsel states that the parties met and conferred on September 6, 2024,
regarding the deficiencies in the operative pleading, but could not resolve
this dispute. (Declaration of Joshua A. Waldman ISO Dem. ¶ 5.) The Court
therefore finds that Defendants have satisfied their statutory meet and confer
obligations.
 
Requests for Judicial Notice
 
            Defendants
request that the Court take judicial notice of (1) Plaintiff’s claim in the
action Williams v. The Kroger Co. LASC Case No. BC495977 (the “Prior
Action,”) (2) Plaintiff’s Worker’s Compensation Claim; (3) the Notice of Ruling
on the Motion for Summary Adjudication in the Prior Action; (4) the Court of
Appeal Opinion in the Prior Action; (5-11) the Official Reporter’s Transcripts
for the jury trial in the prior action beginning August 17, 2023 and continuing
through September 19, 2023; (12) the Judgment in the prior action; (13)
Plaintiff’s Notice of Filing Partial Satisfaction of Judgment in the Prior
Action; (14) Plaintiff’s opposition to Defendants’ Motion for Sanctions in this
action; and (15) Trial Exhibit 351A from the Prior Action. Defendants’ requests
are GRANTED pursuant to Evidence Code section 452(d) (court records).
 
            Plaintiff
requests that the Court take judicial notice of (1) portions of the September
7, 2023 trial transcript from the Prior Action, and (2) the Court’s July 16,
2024 Ruling on the Motion for Sanctions. Plaintiff’s Requests are GRANTED
pursuant to Evidence Code section 452(d) (court records). 
 
Res Judicata (First through Third Causes of Action)
 
Defendants demur to all four causes
of action on the basis that they are barred by res judicata. Defendants contend
these claims are grounded in the same primary right that was litigated to a
jury verdict in the prior action. As the parties litigated this issue quite
thoroughly in the context of Defendants’ Motion for Sanctions pursuant to Code
of Civil Procedure section 128.7, the Court will not belabor the point.  For the reasons explained in the Court’s July
16, 2024 ruling, Plaintiff’s claims against Ralphs and its employees, to the
extent they are grounded in publications made before the entry of the jury’s
verdict in the prior action, are barred by the doctrine of res judicata.
(Plaintiff’s RJN Exh. 3.) However, since the First Amended Complaint also
alleges ongoing publications in general terms (FAC ¶¶ 24-29), that conclusion
does not immediately defeat Plaintiff’s claims in this action which are
premised on continuing defamation, compelled self-defamation, and emotional
distress.  
 
As Defendant’s reliance on the
prior jury verdict is the sole basis for the challenge to the first cause of
action for defamation, second cause of action for compelled self-defamation,
and third cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress,
Defendants’ Demurrer to the first three causes of action is OVERRULED. 
 
Fourth Cause of Action: Unfair Competition
 
            Defendants
also demur to the fourth cause of action for unfair competition on the basis
that it does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. 
 
California Business and Professions Code § 17200 prohibits
any “unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business act or practice.” Ultimately, “an
‘unfair’ business practice occurs when that practice ‘offends an established
public policy or when the practice is immoral, unethical, oppressive,
unscrupulous or substantially injurious to consumers.” (Davis v. Ford Motor
Credit Co., LLC (2009) 179 Cal.App.4th 581, 585.) “Unlawful” practices are
business practices forbidden by any law.” (Olszewski v. Scripps Health
(2003) 30 Cal.4th 798, 827.) “Unfair” practices must also be tethered to some
underlying constitutional, statutory, or regulatory provision. (Scripps
Clinic v. Superior Court (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 917, 940.) 
 
            Defendants
first argue that the fourth cause of action is barred by the litigation
privilege, as codified in Civil Code section 47(b), to the extent it is
grounded in Defendants’ alleged suppression of evidence in the prior action. In
response, Plaintiff contends that the fourth cause of action is not premised on
the concealment of evidence, but on Defendants’ refusal to issue a retraction
of their prior publications, which has resulted in reputational harm, lost
business, and other economic losses. (FAC ¶ 56.) As Defendants note, Plaintiff
asserted the opposite argument in his response to the Motion for Sanctions, and
the Court did not find it to be persuasive at that time. (See Defendants’ RJN
Exh. N; Plaintiff’s RJN Exh. 3.) Plaintiff’s contention here fares no better,
as his argument brings the fourth cause of action squarely within the scope of
the Court’s res judicata finding by characterizing this claim as grounded in
reputational injury from publications made before the jury verdict. 
 
            Accordingly,
Defendants’ Demurrer to the fourth cause of action is SUSTAINED.
 
Leave to Amend
 
            Here,
Plaintiff has conceded that the fourth cause of action is premised on claims
which were conclusively litigated in the prior action. The Court therefore
finds that the fourth cause of action cannot be cured by amendment because it
is barred by the doctrine of res judicata. 
 
CONCLUSION:

 
            Accordingly,
Defendants’ Demurrer to the First Amended Complaint is SUSTAINED without
leave to amend as to the fourth cause of action and otherwise OVERRULED. 
 
            Moving
Parties to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
