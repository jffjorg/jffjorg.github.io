And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to compel arbitration of the dispute. The defendant had moved to compel arbitration of the sexual harassment and employment discrimination action filed by the plaintiff, citing an arbitration agreement signed by the plaintiff. However, the judge found that the plaintiff's complaint is excluded from arbitration under the Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act of 2021, which was enacted in March 2022. The judge concluded that the complaint alleges conduct constituting sexual harassment and a dispute relating to that conduct, and therefore is not subject to arbitration.
