And here is a summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is on a motion to compel defendant's further responses to requests for production of documents, set three, and requests for monetary sanctions. The plaintiffs, Susan Udewitz and David Udewitz, filed a complaint against the defendant, South Coast Botanic Garden Foundation, Inc., and the County of Los Angeles, alleging negligence and loss of consortium. The plaintiffs served the defendant with requests for production of documents, set three, on August 23, 2024, and the defendant responded on October 8, 2024. The plaintiffs argue that the defendant failed to provide responsive documents, while the defendant disputes this claim.

The court denies the motion to compel further responses, as the requests are overbroad and unlikely to lead to the production of relevant evidence. The court also denies requests for monetary sanctions from both parties at this time. However, the court indicates that it would reconsider the tentative ruling if the plaintiffs are willing to narrow the scope of the requests to include only incident reports relating to slip or trip and fall incidents in the three years preceding the subject incident.
