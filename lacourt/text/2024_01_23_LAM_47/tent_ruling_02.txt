STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            Plaintiff alleges that he
purchased a car that is inoperable.
 
            Attorney
Nick Iezza, counsel for Defendant Washington Motors, LLC, moves to be relieved
as counsel. 
 
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Attorney Nick Iezza, counsel for
Defendant Washington Motors, LLC, moves to be relieved as counsel.
 
Moving counsel filed all three required forms (MC-051,
-052, and -053). However, Moving Counsel did not include a proof of service as
required by California Rules of Court rule 3.1362(d).  The
Court will therefore continue this matter to permit Moving Counsel to serve all
parties to this action and file proof of service with the Court. 
 
Accordingly, Attorney Nick Iezza, counsel for Defendant
Washington Motors, LLC’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel is CONTINUED to
Tuesday, March 19, 2024 at 9:00 AM. Moving counsel is directed to serve all
parties with the moving papers and to file proof of service with the Court no
later than Monday, January 29, 2024. 
 
Moving
party to give notice.  
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.

            Any party may submit on the
tentative ruling by contacting the courtroom via email at Smcdept47@lacourt.org by no later than 4:00 p.m. the day
before the hearing. All interested parties must be copied on the email. It
should be noted that if you submit on a tentative ruling the court will still
conduct a hearing if any party appears. By submitting on the tentative you
have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you
should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an
order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
