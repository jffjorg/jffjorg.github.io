Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion for terminating sanctions against defendants J&A Mercado's Plumbing & Rooter and Juan Mercado. The plaintiff filed an employment discrimination action against the defendants on April 12, 2021, and later filed a motion to compel the deposition of defendant Juan Mercado, which was granted. However, defendant Juan Mercado failed to appear for his deposition and has not paid the monetary sanctions imposed. The judge concludes that defendant Juan Mercado has no intention of complying with his discovery obligations and that terminating sanctions are warranted.
