     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
defendant county of los angeles’ demurrer
  to second amended complaint




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On June 16, 2023, Plaintiff Alma
Rosa Hernandez filed this action against Defendants County of Los Angeles (erroneously
sued as Los Angeles County High Desert Regional Health Center) and SEIU Local
721. The complaint was labeled as one for discrimination and violation of
labor/union rights. However, the complaint contained no factual allegations. Instead,
the complaint merely attached prior complaints filed with the Civil Rights
Department and Labor Commissioner’s Office. On August 21, 2023, the Court sustained
the County’s demurrer with leave to amend. 
Plaintiff filed her First Amended
Complaint on September 8, 2023. On November 15, 2023, the Court sustained the
County’s demurrer to the FAC with leave to amend, finding that the FAC
contained no facts beyond conclusory statements that Plaintiff was
discriminated against. On December 14, 2023, Plaintiff filed the operative
Second Amended Complaint. 
On January 16, 2024, Defendant County filed
the instant demurrer to the SAC. Plaintiff has not filed an opposition. 
LEGAL STANDARD
A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether a
pleading states a cause of action or defense. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When
considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in
context. (Taylor v. City of Los
Angeles Dept. of Water and Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228.)
In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the
pleading or by proper judicial notice. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.30, subd. (a).) A
demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic
matters. (SKF Farms v. Superior Court
(1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 902, 905.) Therefore, it lies only where the defects
appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed. (Ibid.) The only issue involved in a
demurrer hearing is whether the pleading, as it stands, unconnected with
extraneous matters, states a cause of action or defense. (Hahn, supra, 147 Cal.App.4th at 747.)
MEET AND CONFER
Before filing a demurrer or a motion to strike,
the demurring or moving party is required to meet and confer with the party who
filed the pleading demurred to or the pleading that is subject to the motion to
strike for the purposes of determining whether an agreement can be reached
through a filing of an amended pleading that would resolve the objections to be
raised in the demurrer. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 430.41, 435.5.) The Court notes
that Defendant has complied with the meet and confer requirement. (See Ortega
Decl.) 
DISCUSSION
            Government Code section 12940,
subdivision (a) prohibits an employer from discriminating against an employee
based on a protected characteristic. In order to establish a claim of
discrimination, Plaintiffs must prove: (1) they are in a protected class; (2)
an adverse employment action was taken against them; (3) at the time of the
adverse action they were satisfactorily performing their jobs; and (4) some
other circumstance suggesting discriminatory motive. (Guz v. Bechtel
(2000) 24 Cal. 4th 317, 355.) 
In the SAC, Plaintiff alleges that she was
suspended for 5 days without pay for inappropriate behavior towards coworkers.
Plaintiff also alleges that she asked for union representation but was denied. The
complaint concludes with the statement: “I claim employment discrimination on
the characteristics of race, and color, national origin and reverse age
discrimination.” 
            The complaint identifies the adverse
employment action and the prohibited basis for the action. While the complaint
does not explicitly state that Plaintiff was suspended due to race, color,
national origin, and age, the complaint must be read as a whole and interpreted
liberally. It is sufficiently clear that Plaintiff alleges she was suspended
because of her race, color, national origin, and age. Because Plaintiff asserts
discrimination, it may be reasonably inferred that she is in a protected racial
and age class. Plaintiff’s precise race and age may be ascertained in discovery.
While the complaint does not distinguish each cause of action by heading, it is
the substance of a claim, not its formatting, that matters. (See Williams v.
Beechnut Nutrition Corp. (1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 135, 139, fn. 2.) Plaintiff
clearly asserts discrimination based on race and age. 
            However, Defendant also points out
that Plaintiff fails to allege her exhaustion of administrative remedies. “[W]here
a remedy before an administrative agency is provided by statute, regulation, or
ordinance, relief must be sought by exhausting this remedy before the courts
will act.” (Parthemore v. Col (2013) 221 Cal.App.4th 1372, 1379.) “The ‘failure
to exhaust administrative remedies is a proper basis for demurrer.’” (Ibid.)
The Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA) contains an administrative
exhaustion requirement. (See Gov. Code, § 12965.) Assuming Plaintiff’s
discrimination claims are based on FEHA, she has not alleged administrative
exhaustion. 
Lastly, a complaint must contain “[a]
demand for judgment for the relief to which the pleader claims to be entitled.
If the recovery of money or damages is demanded, the amount demanded shall be
stated.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 425.10(a)(2).) The SAC lacks a prayer for relief.
CONCLUSION
            Defendant County of Los Angeles’s
demurrer is SUSTAINED with leave to amend.
