And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to stay the proceedings pending the California Supreme Court's review of Rodriguez v. FCA US, LLC. The defendant argued that a stay is necessary because the plaintiffs must rely on the broader interpretation of "new motor vehicle" in order to succeed, and the Supreme Court's decision will determine the scope of this phrase. However, the judge found that the factual dispute about the status of the subject vehicle cannot be resolved on this motion, and that the Supreme Court's decision will not resolve this dispute. The judge also noted that there is no reason to wait until the Supreme Court's decision before resolving the factual disputes, and that these disputes must be resolved at trial by the finder of fact.
