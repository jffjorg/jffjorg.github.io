And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court is considering the County of Los Angeles' demurrer to the Second Amended Complaint filed by Plaintiff Alma Rosa Hernandez. The plaintiff alleges discrimination based on race, color, national origin, and age, and claims that she was suspended for 5 days without pay for inappropriate behavior towards coworkers. The plaintiff also alleges that she asked for union representation but was denied.

The court notes that the plaintiff has not filed an opposition to the demurrer. The demurrer is sustained with leave to amend, as the plaintiff fails to allege administrative exhaustion of remedies and does not include a prayer for relief in the complaint.

The court finds that the complaint must be read liberally and that it is sufficiently clear that the plaintiff alleges she was suspended due to her race, color, national origin, and age. However, the plaintiff's failure to exhaust administrative remedies and the lack of a prayer for relief are proper bases for sustaining the demurrer.

The court orders that the demurrer be sustained with leave to amend, and that the plaintiff may file an amended complaint addressing the issues raised in this ruling.
