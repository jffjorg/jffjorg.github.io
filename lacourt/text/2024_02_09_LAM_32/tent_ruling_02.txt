  Case No.:  21STCV13893
  Hearing Date:  February 9, 2024
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
plaintiff’s motion for terminating
  sanctions 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On April 12, 2021, Plaintiff filed
this employment discrimination action against Defendants J&A Mercado’s
Plumbing & Rooter, Juan Mercado, and Adriana Mercado. 
            On October 16, 2023, Plaintiff filed
a motion to compel the deposition of Defendant Juan Mercado. Defendant did not
file an opposition. The Court granted the motion on November 15, 2023, ordering
Defendant to appear for deposition by December 22, 2023 and imposing monetary
sanctions. Defendant has not appeared for his deposition and has not paid the
sanctions. 
            On January 10, 2024, Plaintiff filed
the instant motion for terminating sanctions against Defendant J&A Mercado’s
Plumbing & Rooter and Defendant Juan Mercado, who is doing business as J&A
Mercado’s Plumbing & Rooter. Defendants have not filed an opposition. 
LEGAL STANDARD
 The
Court may impose monetary or nonmonetary sanctions against a party engaging in
misuse of the discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030.) Misuse of the
discovery process is defined as, among other things, failing to respond to an authorized
method of discovery, making an evasive response to discovery, or disobeying a
court order for discovery. (Id., § 2023.010.) If a lesser sanction fails
to curb misuse, a greater sanction is warranted: continuing misuses of the discovery
process warrant incrementally harsher sanctions until the sanction is reached
that will curb the abuse. (Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th
967, 992.) “The penalty should be appropriate to the dereliction, and should
not exceed that which is required to protect the interests of the party entitled
to but denied discovery.” (Wilson v. Jefferson (1985) 163 Cal.App.3d
952, 959.) Generally, two facts are prerequisite to the imposition of
nonmonetary sanctions: (1) there must be a failure to comply with a court order;
and (2) the failure must be willful. (Biles v. Exxon Mobil Corp. (2004)
124 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1327.)
DISCUSSION
            Defendant Juan Mercado has failed to
appear for deposition despite a court order and the imposition of monetary
sanctions. (See Berkowitz Decl. ¶¶ 20-21.) This demonstrates that lesser sanctions
are inadequate to compel Defendant to comply with his discovery obligations.
Defendant appears to have no intention of complying because he has hung up
multiple times when Plaintiff’s counsel called him to confer about the
deposition. (See Nov. 15, 2023 Order re MTC Depo. 2:24-25.) Therefore, Defendant’s
failure to comply with the Court’s November 15 order is likely intentional.
Under these circumstances, terminating sanctions are warranted.  
CONCLUSION
            Plaintiff’s motion for terminating
sanctions is GRANTED as to Defendants J&A Mercado’s Plumbing & Rooter
and Juan Mercado.
