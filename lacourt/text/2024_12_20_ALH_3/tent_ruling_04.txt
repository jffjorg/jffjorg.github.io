          On May 15,
2024, plaintiff 5623 Peck Road, LLC (“Plaintiff”) filed this action seeking
damages to a commercial property located at 5623 Peck Road, Arcadia, CA 91006
(the “Premises”). On October 15, 2024, Plaintiff filed this motion for leave to
file a First Amended Complaint (“FAC”). 
The court may, in its discretion and
after notice to the adverse party, allow, upon any terms as may be just, an
amendment to any pleading, including adding or striking out the name of any
party, or correcting a mistake in the name of a party, or a mistake in any
other respect. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (a)(1).) A motion to amend a
pleading must include a copy of the proposed amendment or amended pleading
which must be serially numbered to differentiate it from previous pleadings or
amendments and must state what allegations in the previous pleading are
proposed to be deleted or added, if any, and where, by page, paragraph, and
line number, the allegations are located. 
(Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1324(a).) The motion shall also be
accompanied by a declaration attesting to the effect of the amendment, why the
amendment is necessary and proper, when the facts giving rise to the amended
allegations were discovered, and why the request for amendment was not made
earlier. (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 1.324(b).)
The FAC adds Cultiva Group and Qirong
Lin (“Lin”) as defendants. By way of background, Cultiva Group and Lin were
named in a prior unlawful detainer action (LASC Case No. 23AHCV01071) as the
tenants of the Premises pursuant to a 5-year lease, from October 20, 2021, to
November 30, 2026. (Green Decl., ¶ 2-4.) Plaintiff eventually obtained a
judgment for possession and monetary damages against Cultiva Group and Lin on
October 16, 2023. (Green Decl., ¶ 3.) On February 24, 2024, Plaintiff obtained
full possession of the premises. (Green Decl., ¶ 5.) While conducting a
judgment debtor exam on March 11, 2024, Plaintiff discovered different parties
who sublet the Premises in 2023 without its authorization and inflicted
substantial damage to the Premises. (Green Decl., ¶ 6.) Thus, this action was
filed against those unauthorized sublessees on May 15, 2024. (Green Decl., ¶
7.) 
          The proposed FAC adds Cultiva
Group and Lin as defendants and causes of action for breach of contract and
breach of personal guarantee. Plaintiff’s counsel declares that the Premises
remained vacant despite attempts to re-lease them. (Green Decl., ¶¶ 8-9.) Plaintiff
entered into a month-to-month lease with another tenant on May 3, 2024, for
significantly reduced rent, but this tenant vacated the Premises on September
30, 2024. (Green Decl., ¶ 9.) Therefore, the proposed FAC seeks to recover
unpaid rent during the period that the Premises remained vacant. (Green Decl.,
¶¶ 10-11.) 
          Plaintiff’s
motion includes a copy of the FAC identifying the proposed changes. The motion
was brought two weeks after the replacement tenant vacated the premises on
September 30, 2024, and could not have been brought earlier. Also, the motion
is unopposed and it does not appear that any prejudice will result from the
granting of this motion. Accordingly, the motion is GRANTED. Plaintiff is
ordered to file the proposed FAC within 5 days of the date of this Order. 
Moving party to give notice.
