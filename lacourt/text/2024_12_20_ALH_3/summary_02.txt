And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding the motion filed by Eastern Horizon, LLC, Chong Ding, and Yan Ding to try Plaintiff Pauline Yip's equitable claims for specific performance, quiet title, cancellation of instrument, and declaratory relief by the Court before empaneling a jury. The Judge has granted the motion, ordering that Plaintiff's equitable claims and the defendants' defenses of estoppel, unclean hands, and failure to do equity will be tried by the Court before a jury hears any remaining legal claims. The Judge has based this decision on the authority of Nwosu v. Uba (2004) 122 Cal.App.4th 1229, which states that a trial court has the authority to order a trial of equitable claims before legal claims, and that this is the preferred procedure where the case includes both equitable and legal claims. The Judge has also considered the facts of the case, including Plaintiff's claims regarding the ownership of the Twiggs Property and her tax liability relating to the Internal Revenue Service, and has determined that the equitable claims should be tried first.
