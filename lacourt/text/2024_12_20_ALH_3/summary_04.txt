And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for leave to file a First Amended Complaint. The plaintiff, 5623 Peck Road, LLC, has filed a lawsuit seeking damages for a commercial property located at 5623 Peck Road, Arcadia, CA 91006. The defendant, Mulan Shi, et al., were previously tenants of the property and were named in a prior unlawful detainer action. The plaintiff obtained a judgment for possession and monetary damages against the defendants and has now filed a motion to add Cultiva Group and Qirong Lin as defendants and causes of action for breach of contract and breach of personal guarantee.

The court has granted the motion, finding that the plaintiff's motion includes a copy of the proposed First Amended Complaint, which adds the new defendants and causes of action, and that the motion is unopposed and does not appear to cause prejudice. The plaintiff is ordered to file the proposed First Amended Complaint within 5 days of the date of this order.
