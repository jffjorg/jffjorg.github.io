Background   
Plaintiff B.R. Building Resources Company (“B.R.”) alleges
as follows:
B.R. is a boutique builder. Defendants
SA Hospital Acquisition Group, LLC (“SAH Acquisition”), SA Hospital Real Estate
Holdings, LLC (“SAH Real Estate”) and SA Hospital Real Estate
Holdings-Jefferson, LLC (“SAH Jefferson”) (hereinafter collectively, the “SAH
Defendants”) own and/or operate the South City Hospital (“Hospital”) in St.
Louis, Missouri. Defendants Lawrence Feigen (“Feigen”) and Jeffrey Ahlholm
(“Ahlholm”) are the owners/agents of the SAH Defendants. B.R. and the SAH
Defendants entered into a “Master Service Agreement” (“MSA”), wherein B.R.
agreed to perform different categories of construction projects to improve the
Hospital. The funding for the projects to be completed by B.R. was provided by
Twain Financial Partners (“Twain”). The SAH Defendants had an agreement with
Twain to provide the funding directly to B.R. upon completion of certain work
related to the projects. These funds were deposited into an escrow account
(“Construction Fund”). Twain was to make deposits to the Construction Fund on a
per project basis. B.R. entered into twelve subcontracts (“AIA Contracts”) with
the SAH Defendants, each of which pertained to specific construction work to
improve different portions of the Hospital. B.R. was to be paid $15,537,397.16
to perform the work contemplated in the AIA Contracts. To date, Twain has
provided $6,460,063.24 in funds to the Construction Fund. 
On January 3, 2022, Feigen and asked
B.R. to give them $826,937.00 from the Construction Fund to cover operating
costs for the Hospital. On this same date an additional $200,000.00 from the
Construction Fund was given to Feigen and Ahlholm upon requesting funds from
B.R. and assuring B.R. they had approval from Twain to make this request. On
March 3, 2022, Feigen and Ahlholm made another request for B.R. to give
$400,000.00 directly to Modern HR Payroll Company from the Construction Fund to
cover the Hospital’s payroll expenses, again assuring B.R. they had Twain’s
approval. On April 26, 2022, B.R. met with Dave Merrifield, an employee of
Twain, to discuss funding for ongoing projects, at which time B.R. learned that
Twain did not know that Feigen and Ahlholm had requested Construction Funds
from B.R., nor that B.R. had transferred Construction Funds to Feigen and
Ahlholm. Twain subsequently stopped funding the projects, which has rendered
B.R. unable to complete the AIA Contracts.
Also, since January 2022, B.R. entered
into a contract to rent a boiler and a chiller to service the Hospital. B.R.
was instructed by the SAH Defendants, by and through Feigen and Ahlholm, to use
the Construction Fund to pay for the aforesaid service as. Due to no longer
receiving fund deposits to the Construction Fund, B.R. is unable to continue
paying the rental fees for the boiler or chiller or any other temporary
services.
On June 21, 2023, B.R. filed an “Amendment to Complaint,”
wherein Modern HR, Inc. (“Modern HR”) was named in lieu of Doe 1.
On August 21, 2023, Modern HR filed a cross-complaint,
asserting causes of action against SAH Acquisition, Feigen, Ahlholm and Roes 1-10 for:
1.                 
Contractual Indemnification
2.                 
Equitable Indemnification
3.                 
Intentional Misrepresentation
4.                 
Declaratory Relief
On November 14, 2023, B.R. filed a First Amended Complaint
(“FAC”), asserting causes of action against the SAH Defendants, Feigen,
Ahlholm, Modern HR and Does 2-25 for:
1.                 
Fraud and Deceit
2.                 
Breach of Contract
3.                 
Penal Code § 496(c)
4.                 
Defamation Per Se
5.                 
Money Had and Received
On December 15, 2023, the SAH Defendants, Ahlholm and Feigen
filed a cross-complaint, asserting causes of action against B.R., Juan Banos
(“Banos”) and Roes 1-50 for:
1.                 
Breach of Contract
2.                 
Fraud in the Concealment 
3.                 
Fraud in the Deceit
4.                 
An Accounting
5.                 
Unjust Enrichment 
6.                 
Intentional Interference with Contractual Relations
A Case Management Conference is set for March 11, 2024.
1.         Motion
to Compel Furthers Re: Requests for Production (i.e., as to Ahlholm)
Legal Standard
“[T]he
demanding party may move for an order compelling further response to the demand
if the demanding party deems that. . . (1) [a] statement of compliance with the
demand is incomplete[,] (2) [a] representation of inability to comply is
inadequate, incomplete, or evasive [and/or] (3) [a]n objection in the response
is without merit or too general.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a).)
The moving party must demonstrate a
“reasonable and good faith attempt” at an informal resolution of each issue
presented. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2016.040, 2031.310, subd. (b)(2).) “In lieu of
a separate statement required under the California Rules of Court, the court
may allow the moving party to submit a concise outline of the discovery request
and each response in dispute.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (b)(3).)
A motion to compel further responses to a demand for
inspection or production of documents must “set forth specific facts showing
good cause justifying the discovery sought by the demand.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.310, subd. (b)(1).) If the moving party has shown good cause for the
production of documents, the burden is on the objecting party to justify the
objections. (Kirkland v. Superior Court
(2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 92, 98.) 
Notice
of the motion must be provided “within 45 days of the service of the verified
response, or any supplemental verified response, or on or before any specific
later date to which the demanding party and the responding party have agreed in
writing . . .” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.310, subd. (c).)
“[T]he court shall impose a monetary sanction. . . against
any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to
compel further response to a demand, unless it finds that the one subject to
the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances
make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310,
subd. (h).)
Discussion
Plaintiff moves the court for an order compelling Ahlholm to
provide further responses to Plaintiff’s Request for Production, Set No. One
(i.e., Nos. 1-11, 13, 16-31 and 33-41). Plaintiff also seeks sanctions against
Ahlholm in the amount of $2,640.00.
Plaintiff’s counsel
Michael Jones’s (“Jones”) declaration and/or accompanying exhibits reflect as
follows:
On
March 14, 2023, Plaintiff served the subject discovery. (Jones Decl., ¶ 3, Exh.
A.) On April 13, 2023, Ahlholm’s counsel requested an extension of the deadline
until May 8, 2023 to provide responses. (Id., ¶ 4, Exh. B). On
April 14, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel agreed to an extension until May 1, 2023.
(Id.) On May 3, 2023, Ahlholm’s counsel William Pallares (“Pallares”) advised
that he had misread Plaintiff’s counsel’s prior email regarding the May 1, 2023
deadline and that responses would be provided on May 8, 2023. (Id.) Pallares
added, “[p]lease let me know if this will be an issue. Otherwise, I will seek
leave from the court on excusable neglect.” (Id.) On May 8, 2023,
Ahlholm provided unverified responses, with objections and without any
documents. (Id., ¶ 5, Exh. C.) 
 
On May 9, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel
Scott Kalter (“Kalter”) emailed Pallares, requesting verifications. (Id.,
¶ 4, Exh. B.) Pallares advised that same day that verifications would be
provided. (Id.) Pallares also stated, “[f]urther, I brought the issue up
of me misreading your correspondence thinking that you had granted the
extension requested. I inquired on whether this would be an issue and asked for
a response. You failed to provide a response.” (Id.) Pallares
subsequently advised that verifications would be provided by May 12, 2023; they
were, in fact, provided on that date. (Id., ¶¶ 4 and 6, Exhs. B & D).

 
On June 7, 2023, Jones sent a meet and
confer letter, requesting therein that verified supplemental responses be
received by June 16, 2023 due to a June 26, 2023 deadline to file any necessary
motion to compel. (Id., ¶ 7, Exh. E). Counsel subsequently agreed that
Ahlholm would provide supplemental responses by June 23, 2023 and that
Plaintiff would have until July 17, 2023 to file any motion to compel. (Id.,
¶ 8, Exh F.) On June 23, 2023, Plaintiff received supplemental responses and a
privilege log from Ahlholm. (Id., ¶¶ 9 and 10, Exh G and H.) On July 12,
2023, Jones sent a meet and confer email to Pallares regarding the supplemental
responses and privilege log. (Id., ¶ 8, Exh F.) On July 27, 2023,
Gardner agreed to review the requests and indicated responses might be
supplemented. (Id.) Jones proposed that Ahlholm provide additional
supplemental responses on or before August 18, 2023 and that Plaintiff’s
deadline for filing any needed motion be extended to August 28, 2023. (Id.)
On July 31, 2023, Ahlholm provided a supplemental privilege log only. (Id.,
¶ 11, Exh. I). On August 2, 2023, counsel agreed that Pallares would provide a
response to Plaintiff’s meet and confer by August 4, 2023 and that Plaintiff’s
motion deadline would be extended to August 11, 2023. (Id., ¶ 8, Exh F.)
On August 7, 2023, Gardner provided a substantive response to Plaintiff’s meet
and confer communications and agreed to provide supplemental responses to
certain requests, but did not state when those supplemental responses would be
received. (Id., ¶ 12, Exh. J). When Jones inquired of Gardner as to when
these responses would be served and requested that Gardner agreed to extend the
motion deadline to September 8, 2023, Gardner advised that supplemental
responses would be provided by August 9, 2023 and that Plaintiff could have a
one-week extension as to “the remaining requests.” (Id.) Counsel
thereafter exchanged communications regarding the propriety of “splitting” sets
of discovery for purposes of motion filing before Jones agreeing that Plaintiff
would have until August 18, 2023 to file a motion as to the requests that
Ahlholm chose not to supplement and would file an additional motion as to any
remaining deficiencies in Ahlholm’s second supplemental responses anticipated
on August 9, 2023. (Id.) Ahlholm’s second supplemental responses were
received on August 11, 2023. (Id., ¶ 14, Exh. L.)
 
At the outset, the court disagrees with Plaintiff’s
contention that Ahlholm has waived his right to
assert objections, based on the above communications between counsel. Pallares
specifically advised Plaintiff’s counsel on May 3, 2023 that he had misread
Plaintiff’s counsel’s prior communication as providing him with an extension
until May 8, 2023, not May 1, 2023 and explicitly asked whether “this [would]
be an issue. Otherwise, I will seek leave from the court on excusable neglect.”
(Jones Decl., ¶ 4, Exh. B.) Plaintiff’s counsel never responded to this
statement and, in fact, proceeded to engage in numerous meet and confer efforts
which addressed the objections raised in Ahlholm’s discovery responses. 
Again, the requests in issue are Nos. 1-11, 13, 16-31 and
33-41.
No. 1 seeks correspondence between Ahlholm and Twain Financial
Partners (“Twain”) from 2015-present. No. 2 seeks documents relating to any
agreements between Ahlholm and Twain from 2015-present.
No. 3 seeks documents relating to the asset purchase
agreement between Ahlholm and American Healthcare Systems that took place in or
around June 2022. No. 4 seeks correspondence relating to the agreement in No.
3.  Nos. 5-8 seek correspondence between
Ahlholm and SAH Acquisition/SAH Real Estate/SAH Jefferson/Feigen, respectively,
relating to the agreement in No. 3.
Nos. 9-11 seek documents relating to operating agreements
for SAH Acquisition/SAH Real Estate/SAH Jefferson, respectively.
Nos. 13 and 16-18 seek documents relating to correspondence
concerning the Master Services Agreement (“MSA”) executed between Ahlholm/SAH
Acquisition/SAH Real Estate/SAH Jefferson/Feigen and Plaintiff, respectively.
Nos. 19-21 seek documents relating to correspondence between
Ahlholm and Feigen concerning the MSA between Plaintiff and SAH Acquisition/SAH
Real Estate/SAH Jefferson, respectively.
Nos. 22-24 seek correspondence concerning any AIA contracts
executed between SAH Acquisition/SAH Jefferson/SAH Real Estate and Plaintiff,
respectively.
Nos. 25 and 26 seek correspondence concerning any AIA
contracts executed between Feigen/Ahlholm and Plaintiff, respectively.
No. 27 seeks documents relating to correspondence between
Ahlholm and Modern HR Payroll Company from 2020-present.
Nos. 28 and 29 seek documents relating to correspondence
concerning the asset purchase agreement between Ahlholm and Feigen/American
Healthcare Systems, respectively.
No. 30 seeks documents relating to correspondence about
using money from the construction funds provided by Twain to cover operating
expenses for South City Hospital (“Hospital” from 2020-present.
No. 31 seeks documents relating to agreements between
Plaintiff and Twain concerning construction improvements to be performed for
the benefit of Hospital from 2015-present.
Nos. 33-35 seek documents relating to SAH Acquisition’s/SAH
Real Estate’s/SAH Jefferson’s balance sheets from 2015-present, respectively.
Nos. 36-38 seek documents relating to SAH Acquisition’s/SAH
Real Estate’s/SAH Jefferson’s income statement from 2015-present, respectively.
Nos. 39-41 seek documents relating to SAH Acquisition’s/SAH
Real Estate’s/SAH Jefferson’s cash flow statement from 2015-present,
respectively.
Ahlholm provided objection-only responses to Nos. 1-11,
27-31 and 33-41; his responses to Nos. 13 and 16-26, moreover, contain
substantive responses “without waiving these objections.” Ahlholm objected to
each of the above requests on the basis that they were vague and ambiguous as
to certain terms, were overly broad, sought irrelevant information, potentially
violated the attorney client and/or attorney work product privileges and
violated his privacy rights. Ahlholm also predicated his responses with a
subsection entitled “General Objections.”
First, the court agrees that Ahlholm’s “General Objections”
do not comply with Code of Civil Procedure §§ 2031.210 and 2031.240. Next, the
court agrees that none of Ahlholm’s objections are well-taken. Ahlholm has
offered no justification for his position that any of the requests are so vague
and ambiguous and therefore overbroad that he cannot understand what he is
being asked.
Additionally, although Ahlholm interposed an objection on
the basis of attorney client and/or attorney work product privilege, Ahlholm has
not met his burden of justifying this objection. “The party
claiming the privilege has the burden of establishing the preliminary facts
necessary to support its exercise, i.e., a communication made in the course of
an attorney-client relationship.” (Costco Wholesale Corp. v. Superior Court
(2009) 47 Cal.4th 725, 733.) Further, “[i]f an objection is based on a
claim of privilege or a claim that the information sought is protected work
product, the response shall provide sufficient factual information for other
parties to evaluate the merits of that claim, including, if necessary, a
privilege log.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.240, subd. (c)(1).) “In general, . . .
a privilege log typically should provide the identity and capacity of all
individuals who authored, sent, or received each allegedly privileged document,
the document's date, a brief description of the document and its contents or
subject matter sufficient to determine whether the privilege applies, and the
precise privilege or protection asserted.” (Catalina Island Yacht Club v.
Superior Court (2015) 242 Cal.App.4th 1116, 1130.)
As Plaintiff points out, neither Ahlholm’s responses nor the
privilege log specify which of the records being withheld are responsive to the
specific requests to which the objection is asserted, Further, the privilege
log only includes an “email subject” column, which does not sufficiently describe
the documents and its contents or subject matter. (Jones Decl., ¶ 11, Exh. I).
Further, while the log identifies Frank Saidara as an “attorney” involved in a
majority of the communications listed therein, Plaintiff notes that Defendants
have previously produced records that suggest that the relationship between
Saidara and Defendants was not one of attorney and client(s) and that Saidara
instead acted as a business partner, advisor and negotiator. (Id., ¶ 18,
Exhs. P-S). Further, on August 15, 2022, Ahlholm emailed Plaintiff and copied
Saidara, informing Plaintiff that Defendants had retained Mayer Klein of
Frankel Rubin to represent them with regard to potential legal disputes. (Id.,
¶ 18, Exh. T.) “[T]he attorney-client privilege does not attach to an attorney's
communications when the client's dominant purpose in retaining the attorney was
something other than to provide the client with a legal opinion or legal
advice. For example, the privilege is not applicable when the attorney acts
merely as a negotiator for the client or is providing business advice.” (Costco
Wholesale Corp., supra, 47 Cal.4th at 735).
Ahlholm’s opposition simply states, without any further
detail, that “Saidara served as the transactional counsel for the
Defendants in their operation of the South City Hospital.” (Opp., 17:15-16).
This statement is not supported by any declaration, nor was it included in
Ahlholm’s responses. At the very least, it is evident that Ahlholm must provide
a supplemental privilege log complying with Catalina Island Yacht Club,
supra, 242 Cal.App.4th 1116 and 2031.240, subd. (c)(1)) and must provide further responses
specifying which of the records being withheld are responsive to the specific
requests to which the objection is asserted.
Additionally, it appears certain records being withheld by
Ahlholm on the basis of attorney-client privilege are not so protected,
including an email subsequently forwarded to third party Twain (Jones Decl., ¶
18, Exh. U) and an attachment to an email (Id., Exh. V).
Next, Ahlholm’s relevancy objection lacks merit. “In the context of
discovery, evidence is ‘relevant’ if it might reasonably assist a party in
evaluating its case, preparing for trial, or facilitating a settlement.” (Glenfed
Development Corp. v. Superior Court (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 1113, 1117.)
Plaintiff has alleged that Defendants misappropriated funds from the
construction fund under the false premise that they had authority from Twain to
use those funds for purposes not related to Plaintiff’s work on the project. An
attorney representing AHS, which subsequently was under contract to acquire
Hospital from the SAH Defendants, subsequently contacted Plaintiff and advised
that Defendants had told AHS that Plaintiff had stolen approximately $5 million
from the construction fund and that, as a result, AHS would not honor the MSA
and AIA Contracts that Plaintiff has with the SAH Defendants. Plaintiff’s
requests focus on Defendants’ relationships with one another, with Plaintiff
and with third parties Modern HR, Twain and AHS.
Finally, Ahlholm’s privacy objection is not well-taken. “The party
asserting a privacy right must establish a legally protected privacy interest,
an objectively reasonable expectation of privacy in the given circumstances,
and a threatened intrusion that is serious.” (Williams v. Superior Court
(2017) 3 Cal.5th 531, 551.)
The motion is granted in full. Ahlholm is to provide
further, Code-compliant responses to Requests Nos. 1-11, 13, 16-31 and 33-41,
as well as a supplemental privilege log, within 20 days from the date of the
notice of ruling.
Sanctions
Plaintiff seeks sanctions against Ahlholm in the amount of $2,640.00
[calculated as follows: 3 hours drafting meet and confer correspondence,
plus 15 hours researching and drafting 5 motions, plus
5 hours reviewing oppositions, drafting replies and preparing oral argument, plus
1 hour hearing at $550.00, divided by 5].
Utilizing a Lodestar approach, and
in view of the totality of the circumstances, the court finds that the total
and reasonable amount of attorney’s fees and costs incurred for the work
performed in connection with the pending motion is $1,190.00 [i.e., 3 hours
for time expended with meet and confer, plus 10 hours researching and drafting
5 motions, plus 3 hours reviewing oppositions, drafting replies and preparing
oral argument, plus 1 hour hearing at $350.00/hour, divided by 5]. Sanctions
are payable within 30 days of the date of the hearing.
2.         Motion
to Compel Furthers Re: Requests for Production (i.e., as to Feigen)
Legal Standard
See Motion #1.
Discussion
Plaintiff moves the court for an order compelling Feigen to
provide further responses to Plaintiff’s Request for Production, Set No. One
(i.e., Nos. 1-11, 13, 16-31 and 33-41). Plaintiff also seeks sanctions against
Feigen in the amount of $2,640.00.
See analysis re: Motion #2. The requests propounded to
Feigen are identical to those set forth in Motion #2 (save that they are
addressed to Feigen and thus swap any references to “Feigen” with “Ahlholm”).
The motion is granted in full. Feigen is to provide
further, Code-compliant responses to Requests Nos. 1-11, 13, 16-31 and 33-41,
as well as a supplemental privilege log, within 20 days from the date of the
notice of ruling. Sanctions are awarded in the reduced amount of $1,190.00.

sampling is directed fails to serve a
timely response to it, . . . [t]he party making the demand may 
move for an order compelling response
to the demand.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (b).) 
“[T]he court
shall impose a monetary sanction . . . against any party, person, or attorney
who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a
motion to compel a response to a demand for inspection,

waiver on its determination that both of the following conditions are

(Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).)
Discussion
Defendants move the court, pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure § 2031.300, for an order granting them relief from any purported
waiver of their objections and references to document production to the
following five sets of discovery:
(1)              
Request for Production, Set No. Two as to Ahlholm
(2)              
Request for Production, Set No. Two as to Feigen
(3)              
Request for Production, Set No. Two as to SAH Real
Estate
(4)              
Request for Production, Set No. Two as to SAH Jefferson
(5)              
Request for Production, Set No. Two as to SAH
Acquisition
Defendants’ motion “is made on the grounds that Plaintiff
reneged on an agreement regarding the timing and chronology of discovery in
this matter such that Plaintiff is estopped from seeking the waiver of
Defendants’ objections and references to documents in Defendants’ discovery
responses.” (Motion, 2:20-23).
Defendants’ counsel Quinn Gardner (“Gardner”) represents,
and/or the attached exhibits reflect, as follows:
On June 16, 2023, Plaintiff served its
Requests for Production, Sets No. Two (“subject discovery”) on Defendants.
(Gardner Decl., ¶ 20). Defendants failed to calendar the due date for their
responses thereto. (Id., ¶ 21). Due to Defendants’ extensive meet and
confer process with Plaintiff in relation to Plaintiff’s first set of document
production requests, Defendants did not respond in a timely manner to the
subject discovery. (Id., ¶ 22). When, on or about August 24, 2023, SAH
Acquisition served its initial discovery requests to Plaintiff, Plaintiff
requested responses to the subject discovery. (Id., ¶ 23). On August 31,
2023, Defendants agreed to provide responses to the subject discovery by
September 8, 2023. (Id., ¶ 24). On September 5, 2023, Gardner sent a
letter to Plaintiff’s counsel James Daily (“Daily”), advising therein that SAH
Acquisition had filed for involuntary bankruptcy and that the bankruptcy filing
stayed the action. (Id., ¶ 25, Exh. 3). Gardner’s letter requested that
Daily “advise if [he] disagree[d] as soon as possible.” (Id.) On
September 6, 2023, Daily emailed Gardner and other counsel, citing legal
authority and advising therein that “[w]e firmly believe the stay is confined
solely to SA[H] [Acquisition].” (Id., ¶ 27, Exh. 4.) On September 6,
2023, Plaintiff’s counsel Michael Jones (“Jones”) proposed that the parties
agree to mutual deadline extensions in relation to Plaintiff’s first set
of document production requests; in return, Gardner reiterated her position
that the automatic stay applied to the entire litigation, but that she would
review Daily’s response, and that she was agreeable to a mutual four-week
extension. (Id., ¶ 29, Exh. 5). 
 
On September 7, 2023, Jones agreed to
the extension, stating that “Plaintiff’s deadline to bring any necessary
motions on the discovery responses highlighted in the meet and confer letter
dated yesterday is therefore extended until October 25, 2023.” (Id., ¶
30, Exh. 6 [Emphasis added].) Jones also requested that Gardner review Daily’s
legal authority regarding the bankruptcy stay and provide any analysis in
support of her contrary position. (Id.) On September 11, 2023, Plaintiff
filed four motions to compel with respect to the subject discovery. (Id.,
¶ 31). On September 19, 2023, Gardner emailed Daily and Jones, acknowledging
receipt of the motions to compel and advising that “[o]n September 7, 2023 we
emailed your office and stated that due to SA Hospital Acquisition Group’s
bankruptcy we believe that the automatic stay applies to the entire litigation.
Your office responded and stated a position that the stay did not apply to all
defendants. We then requested an extension to provide responses so that we
could respond to your client’s position. Upon your agreement, we did not
proceed to serve responses as we understand that the automatic stay applies.” (Id.,
¶ 32, Exh. 7). Gardner requested that the motions to compel be withdrawn until
the court resolved the issue of the stay. (Id.)
 
That same day, Jones advised Gardner
that the mutual extension on September 7, 2023 only covered Plaintiff’s first
set of document production requests and reiterating his firm’s position that
the stay pertained only to SAH Acquisition. (Id., ¶ 33, Exh. 8). On
October 4, 2023, Plaintiff filed its fifth motion to compel with respect to the
subject discovery. (Id., ¶ 34). On October 19, 2023, Plaintiff requested
an extension to October 30, 2023 to provide responses, which was granted. (Id.,
¶ 36). On October 27, 2023, Defendants served responses. (Motion, 6:18-19).
The court cannot determine whether or not Defendants subsequently served responses that are
in substantial compliance with Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230, 2031.240,
and 2031.280, inasmuch as Gardner has failed to attach Defendants’ respective
responses purportedly served on October 27, 2023 to her moving declaration.
Plaintiff cannot remedy this deficiency on reply.
Further, the
court determines that Defendants have not demonstrated that their respective
failures to serve timely responses resulted from mistake, inadvertence, or
excusable neglect. The subject discovery was served on June 16, 2023. (Gardner
Decl., ¶ 20). Gardner first attests that Defendants failed to calendar
the due date for their responses thereto, but then attests that Defendants
failed to respond in a timely manner “[d]ue to the Defendants[‘] extensive meet
and confer process with the Plaintiff in relation to Plaintiff’s first set of
document production requests. (Id., ¶¶ 21 and 22). No further
explanation is provided, nor is the identity of the individual who failed to
calendar the response deadline disclosed. It is unclear how “extensive” meet
and confer efforts conducted on a separate set of discovery would affect the
timeliness of responses to the instant discovery.
Jones has provided the court with a copy of his August 24,
2023 email, in which he advised Defendants that no responses had been received
and that such responses were untimely and all objections were waived. (Jones
Decl., ¶ 5, Exh. A). On August 31, 2023, Gardner responded that responses would
be provided by “end of next week.” (Id., ¶ 6, Exh. B.) At no point did
Plaintiff agree that Defendants were relieved from their waiver of objections.
(Id., ¶ 7). On September 5, 2023, Gardner took the position that SAH
Acquisition’s bankruptcy filing stayed the entire action. (Gardner Decl., ¶ 25,
Exh. 3). It does not appear that Gardner considered the authorities to the
contrary provided by counsel. At any rate, SAH Acquisition’s involuntary
bankruptcy filing occurred after the subject discovery responses were already
overdue.[1]
Again, Defendants’ motion “is made on the grounds that
Plaintiff reneged on an agreement regarding the timing and chronology of discovery
in this matter such that Plaintiff is estopped from seeking the waiver of
Defendants’ objections and references to documents in Defendants’ discovery
responses.” (Motion, 2:20-23). This is erroneous. It is clear from the
communications attached to Gardner’s declaration that the mutual deadline
extensions agreed to between counsel pertained to Plaintiff’s first set
of document production requests only. Defendants simply failed to timely
respond to the subject discovery.
The motion is denied.
12.       Judgment on the Pleadings
Legal Standard
The rules
governing demurrers are generally applicable to a motion for judgment on the
pleadings. (Cloud v. Northrop Grumman
Corp. (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 995, 999; Code Civ. Proc., § 438, subd. (d)
[“The grounds for motion. . . shall appear on the face of the challenged
pleading or from any matter of which the court is required to take judicial
notice. Where the motion is based on a matter of which the court may take
judicial notice. . ., the matter shall be specified in the notice of motion, or
in the supporting points and authorities, except as the court may otherwise
permit”].)
A motion by a
defendant may only be made on the grounds that “[t]he court has no jurisdiction
of the subject of the cause of action alleged in the complaint” or that “[t]he
complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action
against that defendant.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 438, subd. (c)(1)(B).)
Although a
nonstatutory motion “may be made at any time either prior to the trial or at
the trial itself” (Stoops v. Abbassi
(2002) 100 Cal.App.4th 644, 650 [quotation marks and citation omitted]), a statutory
motion cannot be made after entry of a pretrial conference order or 30 days
before the initial trial date, whichever is later, unless the court otherwise
permits. (Code Civ. Proc., § 438, subd. (e).)
Discussion
Feigen, Ahlholm, SAH Acquisition, SAH Real Estate and SAH
Jefferson move for judgment on the pleadings as to the second, third and fifth
causes of action[2]
in Plaintiff’s FAC.
Second Cause of Action (i.e., Breach of Contract)
“[T]he elements of a cause of action for breach of contract
are (1) the existence of the contract, (2) plaintiff's performance or excuse
for nonperformance, (3) defendant's breach, and (4) the resulting damages to
the plaintiff.” (Oasis West Realty, LLC v. Goldman (2011) 51 Cal.4th
811, 821).
Plaintiff has alleged that on or about January 20, 2021, Plaintiff
and SAH Acquisition, SAH Real Estate and SAH Jefferson (together, the “SAH
Defendants”), by and through their owners/agents, Feigen and Ahlholm, entered
into a Master Service Agreement (“MSA”), which governed the terms twelve
subcontracts (“AIA Contracts”) entered into between Plaintiff and the SAH
Defendants, by and through their owners/agents, Feigen and Ahlholm (FAC, ¶¶ 19,
21 and 54-56); that the SAH Defendants, by and through Feigen and Ahlholm,
breached the MSA and the AIA Contacts by misappropriating construction funds
rather than use those funds to pay Plaintiff to perform under the MSA and the
AIA Contacts (Id., ¶ 57); that, prior to the breach, Plaintiff performed
all requirements under the MSA and AIA Contracts (Id., ¶ 59); and that
Plaintiff was damaged (Id., ¶¶ 58, 60 and 61). Defendants fail to
provide any legal authority for their position that Plaintiff needed to allege
facts “that detail whether or not Plaintiff performed their duties under
the MSA and/or AIA contracts or were excused.” (Motion, 6:7-9 [Emphasis
added].)
Defendants’ motion is denied as to this cause of action.
Third Cause of Action (i.e., Penal Code § 496(c)
Penal Code § 496, subdivision (a) “defines the criminal
offense of what is commonly referred to as receiving stolen property.” (Siry
Investment, L.P. v. Farkhondehpour (2022) 13 Cal.5th 333, 346.) Subdivision
(a) provides, in relevant part, that “[e]very person who buys or receives any
property that has been stolen or that has been obtained in any manner
constituting theft or extortion, knowing the property to be so stolen or
obtained, or who conceals, sells, withholds, or aids in concealing, selling, or
withholding any property from the owner, knowing the property to be so stolen
or obtained, shall be punished by imprisonment. . .” Subdivision (c) permits
“[a]ny person . . .injured by a violation of subdivision (a) or (b) [to] bring
an action for three times the amount of actual damages, if any, sustained by
the plaintiff, costs of suit, and reasonable attorney's fees.
“The essential elements of receiving stolen property are: (1)
The property must be stolen property, (2) the defendant must receive, conceal,
or withhold it or aid in receiving, concealing or withholding it from its
owner, (3) and defendant must have knowledge that the property is stolen
property.” (People v. Schoeder (1968) 264 Cal.App.2d 217, 225.)
Theft is defined in Penal Code § 484 as occurring when, inter
alia, a person “feloniously steal[s], take[s], lead[s], or drive[s] away the
personal property of another, or knowingly and designedly, by any false or
fraudulent representation or pretense, defraud[s] any other person of money,
labor or real or personal property, or . . . causes or procures others to
report falsely of his or her wealth or mercantile character and by thus
imposing upon any person, obtains credit and thereby fraudulently gets or obtains
possession of money, or property or obtains the labor or service of another. .
.”
Defendants have conceded that Plaintiff “for purposes of the
pleadings, satisfied the elements for fraud and deceit.” (Motion, 3:10). Here, Plaintiff
has alleged that Defendants “misappropriated funds from the Construction
Fund, in a manner constituting theft, under the false pretense that they had
authority from Twain to use these funds for other purposes not related to
Plaintiff’s construction work.” (Id., ¶ 68). Plaintiff has alleged that even
though, pursuant to the agreement between Defendants and Twain, the
construction funds were provided to Plaintiff by Twain, Defendants made it
clear to Plaintiff that the funds could only be used or distributed as they
directed, and forbade Plaintiff from contacting Twain regarding use of the funds.
(FAC, ¶¶ 20, 24-30 and 49). Plaintiff has alleged that “Defendants
knowingly obtained, received, withheld and/or concealed the Construction Funds
with the intent to deprive Plaintiff and/or Twain of its use permanently and
have knowingly, willfully, and deliberately, aided the other Defendants in
obtaining, receiving, withholding, and/or concealing said monies, knowing that
such property has been stolen from Plaintiff’s possession or from Twain or
obtained in a manner constituting theft.” (Id., ¶ 74). Plaintiff has
also alleged that, once Twain learned that Feigen and Ahlholm had requested
construction funds from Plaintiff and that Plaintiff had transferred
construction funds to Feigen and Ahlholm, Twain stopped funding the projects as
this was a violation of the agreement that Twain had with Defendants, which
caused damage to Plaintiff. (Id., ¶¶ 34 and 73).
Defendants’ motion is denied as to this cause of action.
Fifth Cause of Action (i.e., Money Had and Received)
Defendants argue that Plaintiff has somehow “elected to
pursue recovery via tort” and cannot inconsistently plead “both in tort and in
equity.” (Motion, 8:21-26). Defendants have failed to provide the court
with any legal authority in support of their argument.
Defendants’ motion is denied as to this cause of action.
13.       Motion
to Compel Furthers Re: Requests for Production (i.e., as to Plaintiff)
Legal Standard
See Motion #1.
Discussion
SAH Acquisition, Ahlholm and Feigen move the court for an
order compelling Plaintiff to provide further responses to their respective Requests
for Production, Sets No. One (i.e., Nos. 8-11, 17-18,
30-32, 43, 57, 61-64 and 66).

Procedural Deficiencies
At the outset, the court notes that while the instant motion
purports to put at issue three separate sets of discovery served by three
separate defendants in this action—namely, SAH Acquisition, Ahlholm and
Feigen—the motion fails to provide the court with the discovery requests, or
the responses thereto, served by Ahlholm and Feigen.[3] The
court, then, declines to consider the instant motion as it pertains to Ahlholm
and Feigen and will provide an analysis as it pertains to SAH Acquisition only.
Additionally, SAH Acquisition’s separate statement reflects
non-compliance with California Rules of Court (“CRC”) Rule 3.1345, subdivision
(c), in that SAH Acquisition has failed to provide the court with “the text of
all definitions, instructions, and other matters required to understand each
discovery request and the responses to it.” Regardless, the court has the
discretion to consider the motion notwithstanding a violation of Rule 3.1345
and will do so in this instance. (Mills v. U.S. Bank (2008) 166 Cal.App.4th
871, 893).
Merits
Gardner represents, and/or the attached exhibits reflect, as
follows:
On August 24, 2023, SAH Acquisition
served its Requests for Production, Set No. One (“subject discovery”) on
Plaintiff. (Gardner Decl., ¶ 8, Exh. 1). On September 5, 2023, Plaintiff was
informed that SAH Acquisition was involved in an involuntary bankruptcy
proceeding. (Id., ¶ 9). On October 19, 2023 and after the bankruptcy was
dismissed as to SAH Acquisition, Plaintiff’s counsel Jones acknowledged that
Plaintiff’s responses were due October 23, 2023 and requested an extension to
October 30, 2023; said request was granted. (Id., ¶¶ 12 and 13, Exhs. 2
and 3). On October 30, 2023, Plaintiff served objection-only responses. (Id.,
¶ 15, Exh. 4.) On November 7, 2023, Gardner sent a meet and confer letter to
Jones, requesting therein that supplemental responses be provided by November
9, 2023 (erroneously stated as October 9, 2023 in the letter). (Id., ¶
18, Exh. 6.) Jones, in return, advised that Plaintiff would provide substantive
amended responses no later than November 27, 2023 and offered to extend SAH
Acquisition’s motion deadline to January 18, 2023. (Id., ¶ 20, Exh. 8).
On November 8, 2023, SAH Acquisition requested an Informal Discovery Conference
(“IDC”) with the court. (Id., ¶ 19, Exh. 7). The court set an IDC for
November 28, 2023. (Id., ¶ 22). On November 27, 2023, Plaintiff served
amended responses. (Id., ¶ 25, Exh. 11). On November 28, 2023, the court
ruled that SAH Acquisition was allowed to file discovery motions. (Id.,
¶ 26). On December 4, 2023 and December 5, 2023, Gardner sent meet and confer
communications to Jones, requesting therein that amended responses be provided
by December 15, 2023. (Id., ¶¶ 27 and 28, Exhs. 13 and 14). On December 15,
2023, Plaintiff served supplemental responses. (Id., ¶ 30, Exh. 15). 
Again, the requests in issue are Nos. 8-11, 17-18, 30-32,
43, 57, 61-64 and 66. SAH Acquisition claims that Plaintiff’s responses “are
evasive and violate Code of Civil Procedure Section 2031.220.” This ground,
however, does not appear to have been raised by SAH Acquisition in its meet and
confer communications, such that the instant motion may be denied on this basis
alone. Regardless, Plaintiff provided responses as follows: “Based on
Responding Party’s understanding of the information sought, and following a
diligent and reasonable inquiry to locate the information requested, all
responsive documents that are in Responding Party’s possession, custody, and
control will be produced, and identified bates labels . . .” SAH Acquisition
does not explain how the phrase “[b]ased on Responding Party’s understanding of
the information sought” violates Section 2031.220.[4]
Plaintiff’s December 15, 2023 supplemental responses as to Requests Nos. 8-11,
17, 18, 30, 62, 63 and 66 do not contain any objections. The motion, then, is
denied as to Nos. 8-11, 17, 18, 30, 62, 63 and 66.
Further, regardless of the objections asserted in Nos. 31,
32, 43, 57, and 61, Plaintiff provided Code-compliant substantive responses and
identified specific records that were produced. Plaintiff, in response to No.
64, advised that it was “unable to produce any response records [sic], as none
have ever existed.”
The motion is denied.
