[1]           The
involuntary bankruptcy against SAH Acquisition was dismissed September 28,
2023, yet Defendants failed to serve responses until October 27, 2023. (Jones
Decl., ¶ 10). 


[2]              Defendants’ notice of motion
indicates that the motion is directed to Plaintiff’s causes of action for fraud
and deceit, breach of contract and violation of Penal Code section 496(c)
causes of action, which are the first through third causes of action in the
FAC; however, Defendants subsequently states that “Plaintiff, for purposes of
the pleadings, satisfied the elements for fraud and deceit, [but] the FAC
remains deficient as to Plaintiff’s breach of contract and violation of penal
code section 496(c).” (Motion, 3:10-12). The body of the motion subsequently
addresses the causes of action for breach of contract, Penal Code § 496(c) and
Money Had and Received, which are the second, third and fifth causes of action.
Plaintiff’s opposition addresses Defendants’ arguments on the second, third and
fifth causes of action, notwithstanding the deficient notice. The court’s
analysis will focus on the second, third and fifth causes of action.


[3]              Moving parties have also only paid
one filing fee and reserved a hearing for one motion, which is improper.


[4]           Section
2031.200 provides that “[a] statement that the party to whom a demand for
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling has been directed will comply with
the particular demand shall state that the production, inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling has been directed will comply with the particular demand
shall state that the production, inspection, copying, testing, or sampling, and
related activity demanded, will be allowed either in whole or in part, and that
all documents or things in the demanded category that are in the possession,
custody, or control of that party and to which no objection is being made will
be included in the production.”
