And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion filed by Defendants regarding the plaintiff's causes of action for fraud and deceit, breach of contract, and violation of Penal Code section 496(c). Despite the deficient notice of the motion, the judge will focus on the second, third, and fifth causes of action, as addressed in the plaintiff's opposition. The judge notes that the moving parties have only paid one filing fee and reserved a hearing for one motion, which is improper. The judge also references California Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.200, which governs demands for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling. The judge is considering the arguments presented by both parties and will issue a final ruling after reviewing the evidence and arguments presented.
