I. BACKGROUND
 
On November
1, 2023, Plaintiffs Tae Lee and Hyun Park filed the instant action against Defendants
Kathy Hyun Kyung Lee, Ron Hernandez and Does 1-50. 
 
The Complaint
alleges the following causes of action:
1.      Fraud
2.      Constructive
Fraud
3.      Negligence
4.      Conversion
 
The Complaint
alleges the following. Defendant Kathy Hyun Kyung Lee (“Lee”) represented
herself as someone who works with banks and could assist Plaintiffs in
refinancing mortgage loans. However, Plaintiffs are informed and believe that
Lee is not a licensed mortgage/loan broker or agent. Lee did not disclose that
she was not a license mortgage/loan broker or agent. Lee, through false
representations, convinced Plaintiffs to give her total sum of $ 43,759.04
between 2000 to May 2022. When Plaintiffs demanded the funds in return, Lee
wrote a check which had insufficient funds. Plaintiffs have made multiple
demands for the return of money without success.
 
On May 31, 2024, Plaintiffs dismissed Defendant Hernandez and Does
1-50.
 
On July 8, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a Request for
Default Judgment against Defendant Lee. Plaintiffs seek judgment against Defendant
Lee in the total amount of $154,770.52 consisting of the amount demanded in the
complaint of $43,759.05, $110,406.48 in interest, and $605 in costs.
 
On September 19, 2024, the Court denied
Plaintiffs’ Request for Default Judgment without prejudice.
 
On October 22, 2024, Plaintiffs filed the instant

costs.

Plaintiffs are seeking default judgment against
Defendant Lee. Plaintiffs properly dismissed non-parties to the judgment,
submitted a CIV-100 form, submitted declarations to support damages, and a
proposed judgment. It appears Plaintiffs submitted a proper default judgment application so long as they present
adequate evidence of damages. 
 
To prove damages, Plaintiffs provide their own declarations stating:
 
“When plaintiffs needed help with
refinancing their loan, they asked Lee and she represented herself as someone
who works with banks and could assist Plaintiffs in refinancing mortgage loans.
However, at that time, we did not know Lee was not a licensed mortgage/loan
broker or agent. Lee convinced plaintiffs to deposit $ 43,759.04 but as time
went by without any progress, Plaintiffs couldn't wait any longer and asked for
the refund. Lee promised to refund the money and in fact did write a check, but
the check was returned for insufficient funds. We want the money back. The $43,759.04
was not intended as a fee but to part of the refinance. For the foregoing
reasons, I am entitled to the return of the $ 43,759.04 I deposited with Lee.”
(Lee Decl., ¶¶ 4-6; Park Decl., ¶¶ 4-6.)
 
Plaintiffs purportedly attached a copy of the
checks from Defendant that were returned for insufficient funds as well as
correspondence between Plaintiff and Defendant in support of their assertion
that Defendant failed to return their deposit. (Lee Decl., Exs. B-C; Park
Decl., Exs. B-C.)
 
However,
Plaintiffs have not provided evidence showing that any monies were transmitted
from Plaintiffs to Defendant. Exhibit A to Plaintiffs’ declarations provides only
a table of the amounts they allegedly deposited to Defendant and the dates.
Yet, Plaintiffs do not provide any invoices or bank statements in support. (Lee Decl., Ex.
A; Park Decl., Ex. A.)
 
Default
judgment may only be granted upon competent evidence proving Plaintiff’s
entitlement to the damages sought. (Kim v. Westmoor Partners, Inc. (2011)
201 Cal.App.4th 267, 272.) A CCP § 585 declaration must include a proper
foundation for the testimony.
(CCP § 585(d).) A defaulting defendant admits only the well pled facts concerning
liability, not damages. Plaintiff must still introduce admissible prima facie
evidence of damages. (Johnson v. Stanhiser (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 357,
361.)
 
The Court
does not find that Plaintiffs have adequately supported their claims for
damages. Accordingly, request for default judgment is DENIED without prejudice.

 
III.
CONCLUSION 
 
Plaintiffs’ request for default judgment is DENIED without
prejudice.
