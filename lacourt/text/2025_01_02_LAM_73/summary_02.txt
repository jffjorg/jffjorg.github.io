And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted the Motion for Summary Adjudication filed by Defendant Barlow Respiratory Hospital as to the first and second causes of action for elder abuse and negligence. The Judge found that the Defendant has carried its initial burden and that the Plaintiff has failed to establish a triable issue of material fact to avoid summary adjudication. The Plaintiff did not file an opposition to the motion, and the Court inferred that the motion was meritorious. The Court concluded that the Defendant's expert witness, Ryan Klein, M.D., established that the hospital complied with the standard of care in treating the Plaintiff, and that the Plaintiff's pressure injuries were not caused by the hospital's negligence. The Judge's ruling is based on the evidence presented, including the Plaintiff's care plan and the Defendant's medical records, which showed that the hospital's staff inspected the Plaintiff's skin daily and repositioned her every two hours, and that her condition remained stable throughout her admission.
