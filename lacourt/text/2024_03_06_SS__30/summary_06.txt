And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the Petitioner's request for relief from the claims statute. The Petitioner claimed that he failed to file a claim against the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (LACMTA) within the six-month government tort claims period due to mistake, inadvertence, and excusable neglect. The Petitioner's counsel's staff member mistakenly checked off that the government claims were also submitted to LACMTA, and the mistake was not discovered until just before the deadline to file the claim. However, the judge found that the Petitioner did not meet his burden of proving excusable neglect. The judge noted that the Petitioner did not provide any averments regarding what actions he took to pursue his claims against LACMTA within the six-month period from the date of injury, and that the Petitioner's counsel did not explain why his firm decided to file a claim against LACMTA, who reviews the staff member's work, and why it would wait until the deadline to present the claim to the government. The judge concluded that the Petitioner's failure to file a claim was not due to mistake, inadvertence, and excusable neglect, and therefore denied the Petition for Relief from Claim Statute.
