And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has granted the motion of Defendants John Michael Taferner and Joseph Goldberger to compel Plaintiff Nanette Price to undergo an independent medical examination (IME) with neurologist Dr. Ludwig. The IME is scheduled to take place on March 19, 2024, at 10:30 a.m. at 2811 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 508 in Santa Monica, CA.

The judge has also denied the request for sanctions by both parties in connection with the motion to compel the IME.

However, the judge has granted Defendant Salvatore Martinez's motion for sanctions and ordered Plaintiff to pay sanctions in the amount of $3,250 within 20 days to Defendant Martinez's counsel. This sanction is related to Plaintiff's cancellation of the IME with Dr. Henry on December 18, 2023, without providing adequate notice.

The judge has also denied Plaintiff's request for sanctions in connection with the motion to compel the IME.
