```

And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The Court has reviewed the request for default judgment and has denied it due to several defects. The proof of service states that the documents were served by substituted service, but there is no declaration of due diligence attached. Additionally, there is an error in Item 2b(2) of the request for Court judgment, and the claimed general damages are excessive. Furthermore, the plaintiff has failed to perfect the default judgment within the statutory time constraints. As a result, the Court has calendared an OSC for May 15, 2024, at 8:30 am to consider imposing sanctions on the plaintiff for the delay in prosecution.
