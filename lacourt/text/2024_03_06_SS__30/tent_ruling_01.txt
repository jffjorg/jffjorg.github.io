  Case Number:  20STCV07031    Hearing Date:   March 6, 2024    Dept:  30 EMANI ELLIS vs BELCALIS MARLENIS ALMANZAR, et al.TENTATIVEDefendant’s Motion for Setting a Reasonable Rate for Plaintiff’s Experts is DENIED in part and GRANTED in part. The Court finds that Dr. Moelleken’s hourly rate of $1,500 per hour (with a 2-hour minimum) is reasonable; however, Dr. Moelleken may not charge an additional $500 per hour for videotaped depositions (with a 2-hour minimum). The Court finds Estrada’s rate of $1,000 reasonable. Lastly, the Court sets the reasonable rate of Dr. Noomand as $2,000 per hour.Moving party is ordered to give notice.Legal StandardA party seeking to depose an expert witness shall pay the expert’s reasonable and customary hourly or daily fee for any time spent. (Code of Civ. Proc., § 2034.430(b).) If the party seeking to the take the deposition of an expert witness deems the hourly or daily fee of that expert to be unreasonable, that party may move for an order setting the compensation rate and notice of the motion shall be given to the expert. (Code of Civ. Proc., § 2034.470(a).) The notice shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Code of Civil Procedure section 2016.040. (Code of Civ. Proc., § 2034.470(b).)In any attempt at informal resolution, either the party or expert shall provide the other with: (1) proof of the ordinary and customary fee actually charged and received by that expert for similar services provided; (2) the total number of times the presently demanded fee has ever been charged and received by that expert; and (3) the frequency and regularity with which the presently demanded fee has been charged and received by that expert within the preceding two-year period. (Code of Civ. Proc., § 2034.470(b)(1)-(3).)The expert or party designating the expert shall provide, and the court shall base its determination of the reasonableness of the demanded fee on, proof of the ordinary and customary fee actually charged and received by that expert for similar services, in addition to any other facts or evidence. (Code of Civ. Proc., § 2034.470(c).)The court’s determination of a reasonable fee shall be based on both (1) the total number of times the presently demanded fee has ever been charged and received by that expert; and (2) the frequency and regularity with which the presently demanded fee has been charged and received by that expert within the preceding two-year period. (Code of Civ. Proc., § 2034.470(d)(1)-(2).) “The court may also consider the ordinary and customary fees charged by similar experts for similar services within the relevant community and any other factors the court deems necessary and appropriate to make its determination.” (Code of Civ. Proc., § 2034.470(e).) Upon determination that the fee demanded is unreasonable, the court shall set the fee of the expert providing testimony. (Code of Civ. Proc., § 2034.470(f).)  DiscussionDefendant moves for a court order setting the reasonable compensation of Plaintiff’s experts Brent Moelleken, M.D., Lucila Estrada, Psy.D., Behrouz Broukhim, M.D., Kourosh Noormand, M.D., Ebi Nikjoo, D.D.S, and Anthony Bledin, M.D., to sit for a deposition at $800 on grounds that the amount they charge for a deposition is unreasonable.Defendant argues that Dr. James Rosenberg, who is a Board-certified forensic psychologist in Los Angeles and whose expert testimony is directly relevant as he administered the independent medical examination to Plaintiff in this case, charges $800/hour as his deposition fee. (Melius Decl., Ex. B.) However, Defendant has not provided any evidence of the ordinary and customary fees charged by similar experts for similar services within the relevant community, or any other evidence, except for its own psychologist’s hourly rate, which is only relevant to Estrada’s hourly rate here, and not too far from Estrada’s rate.Defendant has demonstrated that she contacted Plaintiff, to discuss the expert’s rates, but Plaintiff did not respond. (Id., ¶ 5; Exh. D.)In opposition, Plaintiff first states that she agrees to withdraw three of the expert witnesses: Broukhim, Nikjoo, and Bledin. As such, the motion is moot as to these three experts.Next, Plaintiff advances evidence that Moelleken, Estrada, and Noormand have frequently and regularly charged and received the presently demanded fee within the preceding two-year period.Dr. MoellekenDr. Moelleken has charged $1,500 per hour (with a 2 hour minimum) and an additional $500 per hour for videotaped depositions (with a 2 hour minimum) since 2018. (Moelleken Decl., ¶ 7.) Further, Dr. Moelleken has been paid $1,500 per per hour for deposition testimony (with a 2-hour minimum) for in office/virtual depositions in well over 50 depositions since 2018. (Id., ¶ 10.) Other board certified plastic surgeons in the community that charge $1,500.00 or more per hour for deposition testimony. (Id., ¶ 12; Janfaza Decl., Exhs. 7-10.)The Court finds that Plaintiff has presented sufficient evidence that Dr. Moelleken frequently and regularly charged and received $1,500 per hour (with a 2-hour minimum). However, Dr. Moelleken has not testified to being paid an additional $500 per hour for videotaped depositions (with a 2-hour minimum). As such, the Court finds that there is no proof of the additional $500 being charged and paid and finds that additional amount is unreasonable, and that Dr. Moelleken may not charge that additional amount for videotaped depositions.EstradaEstrada states that her time has been billed at $1,000 per hour for deposition testimony since 2020. (Estrada Decl., ¶ 8.) Estrada’s time has been billed at $1,000 per hour fordeposition testimony in approximately 12 depositions since 2020. (Id., ¶ 10.) The Court finds that Plaintiff has presented sufficient evidence that Estrada frequently and regularly charged and received $1,000 per hour within the preceding two years.In reply, Defendant argues that Estrada charges less than $1,000 for evaluation of patients. However, Estrada testified as to how much she charges for depositions, not for her work.Dr. NoormandDr. Noormand currently charges $2,500 per hour for deposition testimony as of 2023. He previously charged $2,000. (Noormand Decl., ¶ 7.) Dr. Noormand charged and has been paid $2,000 per hour in well over 20 depositions since 2019. He has been paid $2,500 in over 10 depositions since 2023. (Noormand Decl., ¶ 10.) Other board-certified physicians and surgeons in anesthesiology and pain medicine in the community that charge $2,000 or more per hour for deposition testimony. (Noormand Decl., ¶ 12; Janfaza Decl., Exhs. 11-12.)The Court finds that Plaintiff has presented sufficient evidence that Dr. Noormand frequently and regularly charged and received $2,000 per hour in the preceding two years. Because Dr. Noormand only started charging $2,500 in 2023, this evidence is not sufficient to show that rate is reasonable within the preceding two years. Further, Dr. Noormand states he is aware of other experts in his same field that charge $2,000, not $2,500. Thus, the Court sets the reasonable rate of Dr. Noormand as $2,000 per hour.Again, Defendant argues that Dr. Noormand’s declaration stands in stark contrast to his company website which shows dramatically lower rates of “$900 for the first session (1 hour); $720 for each session thereafter.” (Kossoff Decl., Ex. C.) However, this appears to be the price of a ketamine treatment Dr. Noormand offers, which is of course not the same as a deposition. Further, there is no evidence showing that Dr. Noormand himself, and not someone else at his office, such as a nurse, provides the treatment shown on the website.SanctionsCCP Section 2034.470 (g) states, the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to set the expert witness fee, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. (CCP § 2034.470 (g).)The Court finds that sanctions are not warranted against either party as the motion is granted in part and denied in part.ConclusionBased on the foregoing, Defendant’s Motion for Setting a Reasonable Rate for Plaintiff’s Experts is DENIED in part and GRANTED in part. The Court finds Dr. Moelleken’s hourly rate of $1,500 per hour (with a 2-hour minimum) is reasonable; however, Dr. Moelleken may not charge an additional $500 per hour for videotaped depositions (with a 2-hour minimum). The Court finds Estrada’s rate of $1,000 reasonable. Lastly, the Court sets the reasonable rate of Dr. Noomand as $2,000 per hour.
