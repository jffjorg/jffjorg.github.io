Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the Defendant's motion to set a reasonable rate for the Plaintiff's expert witnesses. The Court finds that Dr. Moelleken's hourly rate of $1,500 per hour (with a 2-hour minimum) is reasonable, but he may not charge an additional $500 per hour for videotaped depositions (with a 2-hour minimum). The Court also finds that Dr. Estrada's rate of $1,000 per hour is reasonable. Finally, the Court sets the reasonable rate of Dr. Noormand as $2,000 per hour. The Court denies the motion in part and grants it in part.
