And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has sustained the City of Burbank's demurrer to the plaintiff's complaint without leave to amend. The plaintiff alleged that the City was negligent in the operation of a motor vehicle, but the City contended that the complaint did not fairly reflect the factual basis for recovery, as the plaintiff's claim to the City related to an equipment failure, not a motor vehicle accident. The judge found that the factual allegations in the complaint were entirely different from those presented in the claim to the City, and therefore, the complaint did not state a valid cause of action. The judge also denied the City's motion to strike the complaint, as the plaintiff had attempted to file an amended complaint within the time allowed, even though it was rejected by the clerk.
