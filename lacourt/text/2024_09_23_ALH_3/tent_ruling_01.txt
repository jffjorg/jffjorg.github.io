Plaintiff Ricardo Calvario
(“Plaintiff”) moves for an order compelling defendant Oral Aesthetic Advocacy
Group, Inc. dba Cosmetic Dentistry Grants (“Defendant”) to serve further
responses to Special Interrogatories (Set One) Nos. 1 through 29. 
On receipt of a response to
interrogatories, the propounding party may move for an order compelling a
further response if the propounding party deems that the responses contain: (1)
answers that are evasive or incomplete, (2)¿an unwarranted or insufficiently
specific exercise of an option to produce documents in lieu of a substantive
response, or (3) unmerited or overly generalized objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300(a).) The
responding party has the burden of justifying the objections thereto. (Coy v.
Sup. Ct. (1962) 58 Cal.2d 210, 220-21.)
Defendant’s responses to Plaintiff’s
special interrogatories consist solely of objections and Defendant did not
oppose this motion and justify them. Accordingly, Plaintiff’s motion is GRANTED
in its entirety. Plaintiff’s request for sanctions is GRANTED and imposed
against Defendant in the amount of $1,050, consisting of 3 hours at Plaintiff’s
counsel’s hourly rate of $350. Further responses must be served and sanctions
must be paid within 20 days of the date of this Order. 
Dated
this 23rd
day of September, 2024
