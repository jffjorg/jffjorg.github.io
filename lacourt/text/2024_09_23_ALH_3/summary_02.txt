And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on the petition for approval of a minor's compromise settlement. The settlement is for $100,000, with $6,615.22 going towards medical expenses, $25,000 towards attorney's fees, and $1,281.01 towards non-medical expenses. The balance of $67,103.77 will be invested in a single-premium deferred annuity. However, the court is not inclined to approve the settlement without evidence that the minor's health plan and medical providers have agreed to accept a negotiated reduction to their liens. Therefore, the court continues the hearing to allow for supplemental evidence of the negotiated lien reductions to be filed. The court also requires the petitioner's counsel to appear at the hearing, but not the petitioner or claimant, unless good cause is shown otherwise.
