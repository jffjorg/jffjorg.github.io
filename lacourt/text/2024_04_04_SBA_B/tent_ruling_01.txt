  Case Number:  23TRCP00265    Hearing Date:   April 4, 2024    Dept:  B THE CITY OF RANCHO PALOS VERDES vs DONALD WEITZMAN
CASE NO. 23TRCP00265
MOTION FOR RELIEF PURSUANT TO CCP SECTION 473 FROM SANCTION FOR
FAILURE TO APPEAR
On June 26, 2023 Petitioner City of Rancho Palos Verdes
filed an Application for Abatement Warrant pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 1822 et
seq.  The same date that the
Application for Abatement was filed, the Court issued the Order for Abatement.  On July 13, 2023 the Return to Warrant was
executed by the Court.  (A copy does not
appear in the Court’s file int this matter.)  This concluded the proceedings in this case under
CCP § 1822 et seq.
However, the Court on June 26, 2023 had also issued its
Notice of Case Management Conference and Order to Show Cause re Failure to file
Proof of Service, Failure to Prosecute Case, and Failure to File a Request for
Entry of Default.  Both matters were set
for hearing on October 24, 2023.
Since the proceedings under CCP § 1822 had been completed, counsel failed to appear at the
October 24, 2023 hearing.  As a result,
the Court issued its Order sanctioning counsel $250 for failure to appear, failure
to file proof of service and failure to prosecute.
Counsel for Petitioner now seeks relief from the October 24,
2023 Order that he pay $250 as a sanction. The Court GRANTS the motion as it
finds that counsel for Petitioner reasonably believed that all matters related
to this case had been concluded and thus there was no need to attend a hearing.
ORDER:
The Motion is GRANTED and no sanctions are ordered.
The Clerk shall record this case as completed.
