Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling sustaining the demurrer filed by the defendant, Brant Griffin, without leave to amend. The plaintiff, Christine Rush, has filed a complaint against Griffin for premises liability based on a slip and fall accident that occurred on April 24, 2021. However, the complaint was not filed until May 16, 2023, more than two years after the incident. The Judge has ruled that the complaint is barred by the two-year statute of limitations under CCP §335.1.

The Judge has considered the arguments presented by both parties and has found that the plaintiff's contentions regarding the timing of the filing are not sufficient to toll the statute of limitations. The Judge has also found that the plaintiff did not seek relief within six months of the alleged mistake, as required by CCP §473.

The Judge has ordered that the demurrer is sustained without leave to amend, meaning that the complaint will be dismissed unless the plaintiff files an amended complaint that addresses the issues raised in the demurrer.
