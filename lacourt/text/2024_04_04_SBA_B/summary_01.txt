And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the motion of Counsel for Petitioner, Donald Weitzman, to relieve him from the sanction of $250 imposed for failing to appear at a hearing on October 24, 2023. The judge finds that Counsel reasonably believed that all matters related to the case had been concluded and therefore did not need to attend the hearing. The judge notes that the proceedings under CCP Section 1822 et seq. had been completed on July 13, 2023, and that the Counsel had not received any notice of a hearing after that date. Therefore, the judge grants the motion and orders no sanctions to be paid.
