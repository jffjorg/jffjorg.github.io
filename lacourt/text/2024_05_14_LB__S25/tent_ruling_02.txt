 Case Number:  23LBCV00692    Hearing Date:   May 14, 2024    Dept:  S25 Procedural BackgroundOn April 14, 2023, Plaintiff Mary Ann Moody (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint against Defendant Joe Kenneth Del Rio (“Defendant”) alleging causes of action for: (1) General Negligence and (2) Intentional Tort. Plaintiff alleges the following: on or about April 14, 2021, at about 7:45 p.m., Plaintiff was walking near the Long Beach Arena accompanied by her dog Buddy. (Complaint, p. 5 at ¶ 9.) Buddy was on a short leash, which at the time of this incident, she had dropped allowing him to walk on his own. (Complaint, p. 5 at ¶ 9.) Defendant was nearby standing with his two dogs on a leash. (Complaint, p. 5 at ¶ 10.) Plaintiff followed Buddy as Buddy approached affably to where Defendant was standing with his two dogs. (Complaint, p. 5 at ¶ 11.) Neither Plaintiff nor Defendant’s dogs acted aggressively. (Id.) When Plaintiff and Buddy were approximately two to three arm’s length from Defendant, he began to yell at her and told her that she needed to put her dog on a leash. (Id.) Plaintiff approached Defendant and he became aggressive and began hitting Plaintiff in the head with his phone. (Id.) Plaintiff raised a plastic “chuck it” stick in self-defense but did not strike Defendant. (Id.) Defendant then grabbed the “chuck it” stick from Plaintiff forcibly causing damage to her fore finger. (Id.) Plaintiff tried to run but tripped and fell to the ground. (Id.) Defendant then sat or kneeled on Plaintiff and began striking her with the “chuck it” stick repeatedly. (Id.) Plaintiff alleges that, at the same time, one of Defendant’s dogs began to bite Plaintiff on her leg as she lay on the ground. (Complaint, p. 5 at ¶ 12.)Defendant now demurs to the second cause of action in the Complaint (“Intentional Tort”) on the grounds that (1) the claim fails to state facts sufficient to state a cause of action and (2) the claim is uncertain and does not identify intentional tort(s) which is or are alleged. Defendant also moves to strike punitive damages from the Complaint.AnalysisDemurrer to Plaintiff Moody’s ComplaintA party may demur to a complaint on the grounds that it “does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e).) A party may also demur to a complaint on the grounds that the complaint is uncertain. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (f).) A demurrer tests whether the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahnv. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) A special demurrer for uncertainty under Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10, subdivision (f) is disfavored and will only be sustained where the pleading is so bad that defendant or plaintiff cannot reasonably respond—i.e., cannot reasonably determine what issues must be admitted or denied, or what counts or claims are directed against him or her. (Khoury v. Maly’s of Calif., Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.)When considering demurrers, courts accept all well pleaded facts as true. (Fox v. JAMDAT Mobile, Inc. (2010) 185 Cal.App.4th 1068, 1078.) “A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters. Therefore, it lies only where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed.” (SKF Farms v. Superior Court (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 902, 905.) “The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters, states a cause of action.” (Hahn, supra, 147 Cal.App.4th at p. 747.)Although courts construe pleadings liberally, sufficient facts must be alleged to support the allegations pled to survive a demurrer. (Rakestraw v. California Physicians' Serv. (2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 39, 43.) Where a demurrer is sustained, leave to amend must be allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349.) The burden is on the party who filed the pleading subject to demurrer to show the court that a pleading can be amended successfully. (Ibid.)Defendant argues Plaintiff fails to specify what intentional tort is alleged and, without specificity, Defendant is left to guess, for example, the nature and scope of discovery he should seek. Plaintiff insists she need not label the tort being pleaded if the facts provide notice and meet the requirements and elements. Plaintiff argues that, at the very least, Plaintiff has set out the elements of battery – an intentional tort.“The essential elements of a cause of action for battery are: (1) defendant touched plaintiff, or caused plaintiff to be touched, with the intent to harm or offend plaintiff; (2) plaintiff did not consent to the touching; (3) plaintiff was harmed or offended by defendant’s conduct; and (4) a reasonable person in plaintiff’s position would have been offended by the touching.” (So v. Shin (2013) 212 Cal.App.4th 652, 668-669.)Although not labelled “Battery,” the second cause of action as pled is not so uncertain that the defendant cannot reasonably respond or reasonably determine what issues must be admitted or denied, or what counts or claims are directed against him or her. (Khoury v. Maly’s of Calif., Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.)Motion to Strike Portions of Moody’s Complaint“In order to survive a motion to strike an allegation of punitive damages, the ultimate facts showing an entitlement to such relief must be pled by a plaintiff.” (Clauson v. Superior Court(1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 1253, 1255.) Civil Code § 3294 authorizes punitive damages upon a showing of malice, fraud, or oppression. Malice is defined as either “conduct which is intended by the defendant to cause injury to the plaintiff,” or “despicable conduct which is carried on by the defendant with a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” (Civil Code § 3294(c)(1).) “Despicable conduct is conduct which is so vile, base, contemptible, miserable, wretched or loathsome that it would be looked down upon and despised by ordinary decent people.” (Mock v. Michigan Millers Mutual Ins. Co. (1992) 4 Cal. App. 4th 306, 331.) Specific facts must be pled in support of punitive damages. (Hillard v. A.H. Robins Co. (1983) 148 Cal.App.3d 374, 391-392.)Plaintiff fails to allege any specific facts showing malice, fraud, or oppression. Accordingly, the motion to strike Plaintiff’s claim for punitive damages pursuant to California Civil Code 3294 is granted. If Plaintiff intends to continue to pursue punitive damages, an amended complaint must be filed within 10 days of this order.TENTATIVE RULING: (1) Defendant Del Rio’s Demurrer to Plaintiff Moody’s Complaint is overruled. (2) Defendant Del Rio’s Motion to Strike Portions of Moody’s Complaint is granted.
