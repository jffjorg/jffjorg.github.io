 Case Number:  23LBCV01957    Hearing Date:   May 14, 2024    Dept:  S25 Procedural BackgroundThis action arises from Plaintiff Deshawn Logan (“Plaintiff”) being violently attacked while at 3011 Miner Street, San Pedro, CA 90731 (the “Premises”) on July 24, 2023. (Complaint, ¶ 11.) Plaintiff alleges that he was lawfully on the Premises when he was violently attacked by Defendant Kennan Vatani. (Complaint, ¶ 11.) On October 12, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Complaint against Defendants Kombu Kitchen SF LLC, F50 League, LLC, Instaworks, Inc., Keenan Vatani (collectively “Defendants”), and DOES 1 through 10, alleging causes of action for: (1) Premises Liability; (2) Negligence; and (3) Battery.On January 23, 2024, Defendant F50 League, LLC (“Defendant F50 League”) filed and served the instant unopposed demurrer to the first and second causes of action in the Complaint. As of May 9, 2024, the demurrer is unopposed. Any opposition was required to have been filed and served at least nine court days prior to the hearing. (CCP § 1005(b).) Given that the demurrer is unopposed, an inference is created that the demurrer is meritorious. (Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.)AnalysisA party may demur to a complaint on the grounds that it “does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e).) A demurrer tests whether the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When considering demurrers, courts accept all well pleaded facts as true. (Fox v. JAMDAT Mobile, Inc. (2010) 185 Cal.App.4th 1068, 1078.) “A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters. Therefore, it lies only where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed.” (SKF Farms v. Superior Court (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 902, 905.) “The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters, states a cause of action.” (Hahn, supra, 147 Cal.App.4th at p. 747.)Although courts construe pleadings liberally, sufficient facts must be alleged to support the allegations pled to survive a demurrer. (Rakestraw v. California Physicians' Serv. (2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 39, 43.) Where a demurrer is sustained, leave to amend must be allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349.) The burden is on the party who filed the pleading subject to demurrer to show the court that a pleading can be amended successfully. (Ibid.)Defendant F50 League demurs to the first and second causes of action in the Complaint on the grounds that pleading fails to state facts sufficient to constitute these two causes of action.First Cause of Action - Premises LiabilityA cause of action for premises liability and negligence requires proof the same elements:(1) a legal duty of care; (2) a breach of that duty; and (3) proximate cause resulting in injury. (Martinez v. City of Beverly Hills (2021) 71 Cal.App.5th 508, 517.) “[T]here is no duty to act to protect others from the conduct of third parties.” (Barenborg v. Sigma Alpha Epsilon Fraternity (2019) 33 Cal.App.5th 70, 76.) “There are, however, a few recognized exceptions to this general no-duty-to-protect rule.” (Ibid.) “One such exception is the special relationship doctrine.” (Ibid., internal quotations omitted.) Pursuant to the special relationship doctrine, “[a] defendant may owe a duty to protect the plaintiff from third party conduct if the defendant has a special relationship with either the plaintiff or the third party.” (Ibid.)The Court finds that the first cause of action is insufficiently alleged. Plaintiff only generally alleges that multiple Defendants owed Plaintiff a duty of care but does not state how Defendant F50 League owed Plaintiff a duty to protect Plaintiff from the act of a third party. (Complaint, ¶¶ 10-15.) Plaintiff does not allege that he had a special relationship with Defendant F50 League. (Complaint, ¶¶ 10-15.) Plaintiff’s first cause of action for negligence is premised on mere conclusions of law. Accordingly, the Court SUSTAINS the demurrer to the 1st cause of action with leave to amend.Second Cause of Action - NegligenceThe Court references its discussion as to the first cause of action for premises liability andincorporates such discussion herein. The second cause of action is insufficiently alleged. (Complaint, ¶¶ 16-18.) Pursuant to the second cause of action, Plaintiff has not alleged proximate cause. (Complaint, ¶¶ 16-18.) Moreover, Plaintiff has not alleged the existence of a special relationship between Plaintiff and Defendant F50 League pursuant to the second cause of action to give rise to a duty of Defendant F50 League to protect Plaintiff from the conduct of a third party. (Complaint, ¶¶ 16-18.) The Court, therefore, SUSTAINS the demurrer to the 2nd cause of action with leave to amend.TENTATIVE RULING: Defendant F50 League’s demurrer as to the 1st and 2nd cause of action pf the Complaint is sustained with 20 days leave to amend.
