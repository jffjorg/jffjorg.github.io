  - Courts construe pleadings liberally, but sufficient facts must be alleged to support the allegations pled to survive a demurrer.
  - The burden is on the party who filed the pleading subject to demurrer to show the court that a pleading can be amended successfully.

```

And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has reviewed the demurrer filed by Defendant Joe Kenneth Del Rio to Plaintiff Mary Ann Moody's Complaint, which alleges causes of action for general negligence and intentional tort. The court has also reviewed the motion to strike punitive damages from the Complaint. After considering the pleadings, the court finds that the second cause of action for intentional tort is not uncertain and does not fail to state facts sufficient to state a cause of action. Therefore, the demurrer is overruled. However, the court grants the motion to strike Plaintiff's claim for punitive damages because the Complaint fails to allege any specific facts showing malice, fraud, or oppression. If Plaintiff intends to continue to pursue punitive damages, an amended complaint must be filed within 10 days of this order.
