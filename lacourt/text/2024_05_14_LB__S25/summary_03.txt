```

And here is the English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The court has reviewed the motion by Defendant Velez and Classic Distribution to compel Pledge Medical to comply with their subpoena for production of business records. The defendants seek to obtain medical records related to Plaintiff Filoteo's treatment and billing practices, as well as records of non-party patients who had similar injuries or treatment methods. The court finds that the majority of the requested documents are irrelevant and overly burdensome, and that alternative means of obtaining the information sought can be established through expert witness testimony. Therefore, the court denies the motion and refuses to award sanctions to either party.
