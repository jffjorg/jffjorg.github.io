And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a breach of contract and fraud action brought by Fei Li (Plaintiff) against Dong Yu (Defendant Yu). The Plaintiff invested $620,000 in a Robinhood account managed by Defendant Yu, who allegedly manipulated the investments without adequately disclosing the risks. The Plaintiff paid $123,300 in commissions to Golden Baby Inc., an entity owned by Defendant Kundi Li, who is allegedly an employee of Defendant Yu. The Plaintiff and Defendant Yu reached an agreement in July 2022 to compensate the Plaintiff's losses with $725,000, payable in four installments. However, the Defendants failed to make any payments, and the Plaintiff is now seeking entry of default judgment against Defendant Yu in the amount of $725,757.26 plus interest accruing at $198.63 per day. The judge grants the request for default judgment conditionally upon the dismissal of all remaining defendants, including Kundi Li and Golden Baby Inc.
