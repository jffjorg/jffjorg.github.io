            This
is an unlawful detainer action. The Complaint alleges that Plaintiff IRP
Griffin Apartments, LLC (Plaintiff) entered into a residential lease agreement
with Defendant Michael Nelson (Defendant). Thereafter, Defendant failed to make
all the required rental payments under the lease.
            
            On
June 15, 2023, this Court entered default against Defendant. Plaintiff now moves
for default judgment against Defendant. Possession is no longer at issue. The
request for entry of default judgment is granted.  
 
Discussion
 
            Plaintiff
seeks default judgment in the amount of $90,751.45 against Defendant Nelson,
which includes $60,622.33 in past due rent, $33,428.12
in holdover damages, $1,200 in attorney fees, $720 in costs, plus a $5,219
credit in the form of the security deposit. 
 
            Plaintiff
submits evidence that the parties entered into a lease agreement on October 21,
2021 for a monthly rent of $4,876 (which increased to $5,363 on January 1,
2022) and a security deposit of $5,219. (Izquierdo Decl., ¶¶ 4-5, Ex. 4c.) As
of April 1, 2022, Defendant has failed to and refuses to pay rent to Plaintiff.
(Izquierdo Decl. ¶ 6.) Based on the foregoing evidence, Plaintiff has
substantiated its claim for damages in the amount of $60,622.33 in past due
rent and $33,428.12 in holdover damages. 
 
            Plaintiff
also seeks costs in the amount of $720. Plaintiff has substantiated these
costs. (Izquierdo Decl., ¶ 14.) 
 
            Lastly,
Plaintiff seeks attorney fees in the amount of $1,200. Section 32 of the Lease
provides for attorney fees. (Izquierdo Decl., ¶ 13.) Plaintiff is entitled to
attorney fees. 
 
Thus, the Court
will grant default judgment in the amount of $90,751.45 against Defendant
Nelson.
