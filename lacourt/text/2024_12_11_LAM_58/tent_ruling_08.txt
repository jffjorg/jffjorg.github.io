 
            This is a breach
of contract and fraud action. The Complaint alleges that Plaintiff Fei Li (Plaintiff)
entered into an agreement with Defendant Dong Yu (Defendant Yu). Under the
agreement, Plaintiff was to invest $200,000 into a Robinhood account, with Defendant
Yu managing the account as Plaintiff’s stockbroker for a commission. Over time,
Plaintiff invested a total of $620,000 at Defendant Yu’s urging, but alleges
that Defendant Yu, in conspiracy with Defendant Kundi Li, manipulated
Plaintiff’s investments for their own profit without adequately disclosing the
risks involved. Plaintiff also paid $123, 300 as commissions to Defendant Golden Baby Inc.

 
            In July
2022, Defendants agree to compensate Plaintiff’s loss with 4 installments of
payments for a total of $725,000; in consideration, Plaintiff agreed he would not
pursue any damage claim to Defendants.
 
Plaintiff filed his Complaint on February
20, 2024. The Request for Entry of Default against Defendants was entered on August
30, 2024. On November 25, 2024, the Court denied Plaintiff’s prior attempt for
entry of default judgment against Defendants Yu, Kundi Li, and Golden Baby Inc.
 
Now, Plaintiff seeks entry of
default judgment solely against Defendant Yu in the amount of $725,757.26 plus
interest accruing at $198.63 a day. 
 
Plaintiff has not dismissed DOES
1-20; nor has Plaintiff dismissed the remaining defendants, Kundi Li and Golden
Baby Inc.
 
The request for entry of default
judgment is granted conditionally upon the dismissal of all remaining named Defendants
and Doe defendants. (CRC 3.1800, subd. (a)(7).)  
 
DISCUSSION 
 
            Plaintiff
requests entry of default judgment in the amount of $725,000 plus $957.26 in
costs and interest accruing at $198.63 a day. Plaintiff does not seek attorney
fees. 
 
Specifically, Plaintiff requests “prejudgment
interest accruing at a rate of $198.63 per day from January 1, 2024, to the
date of entry of judgment.” Plaintiff indicates that the interest began to
accrue on January 1, 2024 – the “last maturity date of the restitution amount
agreed by Defendants.” (Case Summary 7:10-11.) The request for interest has
been properly substantiated. (CRC 3.1800, subd. (a)(3).)
 
            In support
of the request for damages, Plaintiff submits evidence that he invested a total
amount of $620,000 into the Robinhood account under the solicitation of Defendant
Yu, who acted as his stockbroker for commissions. (Li Decl., ¶¶ 1-2; Yang
Decl., ¶¶ 5-6, 14, Ex. 1.) Plaintiff also paid to pay commissions to Defendant Golden Baby Inc. in the amount of $123,000,
which was an entity owned by Defendant Kundi Li, who is allegedly an
employee of Defendant Yu. (Li Decl., ¶¶ 3-5; Yang Decl., ¶¶ 7, 15, Ex. 2.) 
 
            Based on a
declaration from Plaintiff’s counsel, Plaintiff states, as a result of
Defendant Dong Yu’s lack of due diligence and failure to fulfill his fiduciary
duty, Plaintiff missed the opportunity to withdraw from the stock market and
suffered substantial financial losses. (Yang Decl., ¶¶ 9-11.)
 
            Thereafter,
in July 2022, Plaintiff and Defendant Yu reached an agreement whereby
Defendants promised to compensate Plaintiff with $725,000, payable in four
installments: $185,000 on January 1, 2023, $180,000 on May 1, 2023, $180,000 on
September 1, 2023, and $180,000 on December 1, 2023. (Li Decl., ¶ 7; Yang
Decl., ¶¶ 12, 18.) However, after the agreement was reached, Plaintiff was
unable to contact Defendants, and they have failed to make any payments under
the compensation agreement. (Li Decl., ¶ 8.) 
 
            As the Court previously noted, this evidence supports damages as to
Defendant Yu under a breach of contract theory for the alleged contract entered
into in July 2022. (Kim v. Westmoore Partners, Inc. (2011) 201
Cal.App.4th 267, 288 [“ ‘[p]laintiffs in a default judgment proceeding must
prove they are entitled to the damages claimed’ ”].) 
 
Based on the foregoing, the
request for default judgment is granted against Defendant Yu in the amount
requested -- upon the dismissal of all other remaining Defendants in compliance
with California Rule of Court, Rule 3.1800, subd. (a)(7).
