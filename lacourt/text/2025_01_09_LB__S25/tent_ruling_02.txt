 Case Number:  24LBCV00373    Hearing Date:   January 9, 2025    Dept:  S25 Procedural BackgroundOn February 23, 2024, Plaintiff filed a complaint against Defendants Barnes & Noble, Inc. and Does 1 to 10, alleging premises liability and general negligence causes of action. On May 7, 2024, Plaintiff amended her complaint. Plaintiff alleges that on February 23, 2022, she was injured at Defendant’s location at 7651 Carson Blvd., Long Beach, CA 90808. (May 7, 2024 Compl., at p. 5.) On October 2, 2024, Defendant filed the instant demurrer to the complaint. On December 30, 2024, Defendant filed a notice of non-opposition to demurrer.Legal StandardA demurrer is a pleading used to test the legal sufficiency of other pleadings. It raises issues of law, not fact, regarding the form or content of the opposing party’s pleading. It is not the function of the demurrer to challenge the truthfulness of the complaint; and for purpose of the ruling on the demurrer, all facts pleaded in the complaint are assumed to be true, however improbable they may be.A demurrer can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the pleading under attack; or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311.) No other extrinsic evidence can be considered (i.e., no “speaking demurrers”). A demurrer is brought under Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10 [grounds], § 430.30 [as to any matter on its face or from which judicial notice may be taken], and § 430.50, subd. (a) [can be taken to the entire complaint or any cause of action within]. Specifically, a demurrer may be brought per Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e) if insufficient facts are stated to support the cause of action asserted. Furthermore, a demurrer for uncertainty will be sustained only where the complaint is so bad that the defendant cannot reasonably respond. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (f).)Leave to amend must be allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.) The burden is on the complainant to show the Court that a pleading can be amended successfully. (Ibid.)Meet and ConferDefense counsel states that there was a meet and confer with Plaintiff’s prior counsel via telephone on July 19, 2024. (Tretola Decl., ¶ 3, Exs. B-C.) On August 1, 2024, Defense counsel emailed Plaintiff’s then-counsel requesting confirmation that her office filed a substitution of attorney for this matter and has not received a response to said email. (Tretola Decl., ¶ 4, Ex. A.) Defense counsel requests the Court excuse Defendant’s inability to comply with the meet and confer requirements as Defense counsel has been unable to meet and confer with Plaintiff prior to filing the instant demurrer. (Tretola Decl., ¶ 5.) The demurrer is ripe for determination on its merits.Discussion1st Cause of Action – Premises Liability and 2nd Cause of Action – General NegligenceTo plead a cause of action for negligence, one must allege (1) a legal duty owed to plaintiffs to use due care; (2) breach of duty; (3) causation; and (4) damage to plaintiff. (County of Santa Clara v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2006) 137 Cal.App.4th 292, 318.) In California, negligence may be pleaded in general terms. (Landeros v. Flood (1976) 17 Cal.3d 399, 407-408.)“Ordinarily, negligence may be alleged in general terms, without specific facts showing how the injury occurred, but there are ‘limits to the generality with which a plaintiff is permitted to state his cause of action, and … the plaintiff must indicate the acts or omissions which are said to have been negligently performed. He may not recover upon the bare statement that the defendant's negligence has caused him injury.’ [Citation].” (Berkley v. Dowds (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 518, 527.) However, there is no requirement that plaintiff identify and allege the precise moment of the injury or the exact nature of the wrongful act. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)The elements of a cause of action for premises liability are the same as those for negligence: duty, breach, causation, and damages. (Castellon v. U.S. Bancorp (2013) 220 Cal.App.4th 994, 998, citing Ortega v. Kmart Corp. (2001) 26 Cal.4th 1200, 1205.)Defendant argues that the Complaint at best pleads one of the four required elements for negligence and the derivative claim for premises liability. Defendant states the complaint fails to demonstrate specific acts or omissions by Defendants and is factually ambiguous as to what the injuries suffered.No opposition has been filed.The Court agrees. As it stands, the complaint is uncertain and fails to state a cause of action for negligence. There is no description of what happened, how Defendant’s acts and/or omissions caused Plaintiff’s injury, and so on. (See Berkley v. Dowds (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 518, 527.)Tentative RulingThe instant demurrer is SUSTAINED with 15 days leave to amend as to the 1st and 2nd causes of action.
