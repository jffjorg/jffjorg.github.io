And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendant's demurrer to the plaintiff's complaint is sustained with 15 days' leave to amend. The complaint fails to state a cause of action for negligence and premises liability because it does not provide specific details about the acts or omissions that caused the plaintiff's injury. The judge agrees with the defendant's argument that the complaint is uncertain and fails to state a cause of action. The plaintiff will have 15 days to amend the complaint to include more specific details about the incident.
