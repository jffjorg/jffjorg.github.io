And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies a motion to be relieved as counsel filed by Robert M. Dickson, attorney for Cora Woodard. The motion was filed on February 29, 2024, more than 30 days after the address of the client was confirmed. The Judge cites CRC 3.1352(d), which requires the address to be confirmed within 30 days prior to filing the motion. The hearing on the motion to compel, specially set for March 28, 2024, will not be ruled on as no moving papers have been filed. The Judge orders counsel to give notice and instructs parties who intend to submit on the tentative to send an email to the court.
