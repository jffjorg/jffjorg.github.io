 Case Number:  22LBCV00940    Hearing Date:   March 28, 2024    Dept:  S27 Robert M. Dickson, attorney for Cora
Woodard, seeks to be relieved as counsel, contending a total breakdown of the
attorney-client relationship has occurred by Woodard has failed to return a
substitution of attorney.    
 
Counsel declares he confirmed
Client’s address within the past thirty days, but then states that he confirmed
the address in October of 2023 and on 1/09/24. 
Counsel filed his motion on 2/29/24, more than thirty days after he
confirmed the address.  CRC 3.1352(d)
makes clear that the address must have been confirmed within the thirty days
prior to filing the motion.  The motion
is therefore denied without prejudice.  
 
The Court notes that, at the
hearing on 2/29/24, the Court specially set a hearing on a motion to compel for
3/28/24.  No moving papers have been
filed, and therefore the Court is not ruling on the specially set motion. 
 
Counsel is ordered to give
notice.  
 
Parties who intend to submit
on this tentative must send an email to the court at gdcdepts27@lacourt.org indicating intention to submit on the tentative

tentative and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion may be placed
off calendar.  If a party submits on
the tentative, the party’s email must include the case number and must identify
the party submitting on the tentative. If any party does not submit on the
tentative, the party should make arrangements to appear remotely at the hearing
