And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling denying the motion to compel compliance with a deposition subpoena for production of business records from the City of Long Beach. The subpoena sought production of all documents relating to any criminal investigation of Thomas Maggio, including contact information for other victims of Maggio's alleged sexual assaults. The City opposes the motion, arguing that Penal Code §293(c) precludes it from providing the requested documents. The Court finds that §293(c) bars disclosure of the contact information and that the plaintiff failed to meet her burden to show some exception to the express wording of the statute. The motion is denied.
