And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the motion to trifurcate in part. The liability and alter ego issues will be tried together, and if the Plaintiff is successful, the second phase of the trial, which is the amount of punitive damages, will be tried immediately after the first phase. The court agrees that the liability issue will not overlap with the alter ego issues, but notes that the crux of an alter ego claim is that an individual is fraudulently using an entity as a shell through which to operate for his own advantage and shield himself from liability. The court is not inclined to sever the alter ego claim from the liability claim at trial.
