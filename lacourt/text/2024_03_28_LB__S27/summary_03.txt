Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in YAML format:

**Case Information**

* Case Number: 22LBCV01003
* Hearing Date: March 28, 2024
* Department: S27

**Facts**

* Plaintiff, Jeroma Bonner, filed an action against LAUSD and Christina Park for disability discrimination, perceived disability discrimination, age discrimination, work environment harassment, retaliation, and failure to provide reasonable accommodation.
* Plaintiff was terminated from her job as a teacher's assistant and early education aide due to her failure to comply with LAUSD's vaccination policy.

**Disputes**

* Plaintiff disputes that she was given notice of the vaccination deadline and claims that her termination was wrongful.
* Defendant argues that Plaintiff was given notice of the deadline and that her termination was for a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason.

**Laws**

* FEHA (California Fair Employment and Housing Act)
* Gov Code ยง12940(m) and (n) (interactive process for reasonable accommodations)
* CCP ยง437c(p)(2) (initial burden of proof on motions for summary judgment)

**Key Points**

* Defendant met its initial burden to show a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for termination.
* Plaintiff failed to raise a triable issue of material fact concerning whether she had notice of the policy or whether her stated reason for termination was mere pretext.
* Plaintiff's medical condition, hypertension, was not a basis for an accommodation, as she did not provide evidence that she had a medical reason for failing to comply with the policy.

**Ruling**

* The motion for summary judgment is granted.
* Defendant is ordered to give notice.
* The parties who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the court at gdcdepts27@lacourt.org indicating their intention to submit on the tentative.
