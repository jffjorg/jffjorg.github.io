And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has seen a significant increase in motions to compel further responses in lemon law cases over the past six to nine months. The attorneys for both parties have failed to meet and confer in good faith to resolve issues related to each case, resulting in a backlog of discovery motions taking up more than five motion hearing slots in a week. The judge believes that counsel can easily resolve the issues on these discovery motions with the assistance of prior rulings. The judge also references a previous case, Volkswagenwerk Aktiengesellschaft v. Superior Court (1981) 122 Cal.App.3d 326, which affirmed the trial court's award of sanctions against both attorneys on the case. The judge finds that the attorneys in these lemon law cases are acting in a way that does not benefit their clients, constantly incurring attorneys' fees in connection with discovery disputes. The judge orders the parties to meet and confer with prior rulings in mind, and if they are unable to resolve their issues, they must file a joint statement detailing the disputed discovery items and each party's statement on why a further response should or should not be ordered. The judge also orders the parties to file briefs and declarations detailing their efforts to meet and confer if they are unable to resolve their issues.
