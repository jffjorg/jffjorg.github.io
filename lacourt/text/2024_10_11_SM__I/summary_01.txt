And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for summary judgment filed by the defendant. The defendant claims that DBH has no connection to the underlying lease and therefore should not be liable. The judge notes that the motion was filed and served on October 8, 2024, which is later than the statutory minimum timeframe of 75 days. The judge finds that the defendant's delay in filing the motion is the real problem, not the court's congested calendar. Despite the untimeliness of the motion, the judge is willing to hear it because it raises a potentially important issue. The judge warns the defense counsel that its conduct in this matter leaves much to be desired and could be sanctionable. The judge grants the motion to hear the summary judgment motion less than 30 days before trial, but notes that this is not a guarantee of a favorable outcome.
