And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the unopposed Special Motions to Strike filed by Defendants Richard Fannan and Vincent Quigg, pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure Section 425.16, also known as the anti-SLAPP statute. This statute protects individuals from lawsuits that arise from their exercise of their right to petition or free speech.

The Plaintiffs, Aimee Thurman, Daniel Thurman, Lorin Rowley, and Sandra Rowley, alleged that the Defendants filed a false and frivolous complaint against them, and that the Defendants have been trying to take advantage of them by claiming there are judgments against them. The Plaintiffs also alleged that Quigg sent Sandra Rowley documents stating she owed a balance of $81,364.00 and sent a letter stating he would foreclose on their family residence.

The Judge found that the Defendants had made a threshold showing that the challenged causes of action arose from protected activity, as they were related to the filing of a lawsuit and post-judgment collection efforts. However, the Plaintiffs failed to oppose the motions, which meant they did not meet their burden to show a probability of prevailing on their claims. Therefore, the motions were granted, and the Plaintiffs' complaint was struck and dismissed.

```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has granted the special motions to strike filed by defendants Richard Fannan and Vincent Quigg, as they have made a threshold showing that the challenged causes of action arise from protected activity under California Code of Civil Procedure Section 425.16. The plaintiffs failed to oppose the motions, and therefore did not meet their burden to show a probability of prevailing on the merits of their claims.

The judge found that the plaintiffs' causes of action arise from the defendants' filing of a lawsuit and post-judgment collection efforts, which is protected activity under the anti-SLAPP statute. The judge also ruled that the plaintiffs failed to provide sufficient evidence to support their claims and that the defendants have not engaged in any protected activity that would warrant a probability of prevailing on the merits of their claims.

The judge has granted the motions to strike and dismiss the plaintiffs' complaint, and has deferred attorneys' fees to be addressed in a separate motion.
