And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the unopposed Special Motions to Strike filed by Defendants Richard Fannan and Vincent Quigg, pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure Section 425.16, also known as the anti-SLAPP statute. This statute protects individuals from lawsuits that arise from their exercise of their right to petition or free speech.

The Plaintiffs, Aimee Thurman, Daniel Thurman, Lorin Rowley, and Sandra Rowley, alleged that the Defendants filed a false and frivolous complaint against them, and that the Defendants have been trying to take advantage of them by claiming there are judgments against them. The Plaintiffs also alleged that Quigg sent Sandra Rowley documents stating she owed a balance of $81,364.00 and sent a letter stating he would foreclose on their family residence.

The Judge found that the Defendants had made a threshold showing that the challenged causes of action arose from protected activity, as they were related to the filing of a lawsuit and post-judgment collection efforts. However, the Plaintiffs failed to oppose the motions, which meant they did not meet their burden to show a probability of prevailing on their claims. Therefore, the motions were granted, and the Plaintiffs' complaint was struck and dismissed.
