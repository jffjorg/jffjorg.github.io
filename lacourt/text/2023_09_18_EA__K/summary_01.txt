**English Summary:**

The judge is considering a motion by BJ's Restaurants to protect itself from what it considers to be overly burdensome discovery requests by the Plaintiffs. BJ's wants the Plaintiffs to meet and confer in good faith to schedule a deposition of their Person Most Knowledgeable (PMK).  The Plaintiffs, in turn, are seeking to depose the PMK as soon as possible due to an upcoming motion for summary judgment.  

The judge acknowledges that there was some confusion regarding scheduling the deposition, but ultimately finds that BJ's did not intentionally obstruct the process.  The judge grants BJ's request to meet and confer on the date and time of the deposition, but denies the request to strike a specific category of discovery.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding a motion for a protective order filed by BJ's Restaurants, Inc. The motion was filed in response to a deposition notice served on BJ's, which sought to depose the company's Person Most Knowledgeable (PMK) on August 4, 2023. BJ's objected to the deposition notice, claiming that it was unilaterally scheduled and that the company had not been given adequate notice.

The judge has granted BJ's motion to some extent, ordering the parties to meet and confer in good faith on a date and time for the PMK deposition. The judge has also instructed BJ's counsel to come prepared at the time of the hearing with at least three dates within the next twenty days on which the PMK is available to be deposed.

The judge has denied BJ's request to strike Category No. 4 from Plaintiffs' deposition notice, which seeks information about the management of the Region containing the City of Industry BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse from 2018 through 2021. The judge has also declined the parties' respective requests for sanctions.

The judge's ruling is based on the parties' communications and the need to schedule the deposition of BJ's PMK in a reasonable and expeditious manner. The judge has taken into account the upcoming MSJ hearing and the need for Plaintiffs to depose BJ's PMK as expeditiously as possible.

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for a protective order filed by BJ's Restaurants, Inc. The motion seeks to prevent the deposition of BJ's Person Most Knowledgeable (PMK) and to strike Category No. 4 from Plaintiff's deposition notice. The court has granted the motion in part, ordering the parties to meet and confer in good faith on a date and time for the PMK deposition. The court has also denied the motion to strike Category No. 4, finding that the parties did not specifically confer on this issue. The court has declined the parties' respective requests for sanctions. The ruling is based on the court's review of the communications between counsel and the applicable law, including Code of Civil Procedure sections 2025.420, 2019.030, and 2031.060. The court has found that BJ's counsel, Christopher Cianci, did not improperly schedule the deposition, but rather was attempting to accommodate Plaintiff's counsel, Kerry Zeiler, who was out of the country. The court has also found that Zeiler's need to depose BJ's PMK as expeditiously as possible is a legitimate concern. The ruling is subject to change after the hearing on the motion.
