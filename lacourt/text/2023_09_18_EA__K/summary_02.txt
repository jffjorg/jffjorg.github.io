However, the Judge awarded sanctions against Glorious Sky, payable to MT Hermon, in the reduced amounts of $660.00 and $510.00 for the two motions, respectively. The sanctions are for attorney fees and the filing fee related to bringing the motions. If MT Hermon believes the *supplemental* responses are deficient, they must file new motions specifically addressing those supplemental responses. The judge had previously continued the first hearing date, ordering more complete meet-and-confer actions.
