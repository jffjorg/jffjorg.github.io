And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court is considering two motions, #1 and #2, which were originally set for hearing on May 31, 2023 and July 17, 2023, respectively. Due to a continuance, the hearing on both motions has been rescheduled to September 18, 2023. The court is reviewing the Code of Civil Procedure ยง 2030.300, which outlines the rules for responding to interrogatories. Specifically, the court is considering whether the propounding party has waived its right to compel a further response to the interrogatories due to the lack of notice within the 45-day period. The court will consider this issue further in its final ruling.
