**English Text Summary of the Tentative Ruling:**

This tentative ruling addresses two motions (Motion #1 and Motion #2) filed by the propounding party to compel further responses to interrogatories.  Motion #1 was originally set for hearing on May 31, 2023, but was continued to July 17, 2023, and then again to September 18, 2023.  Motion #2 was filed shortly after Motion #1 and also set for hearing, which was continued to same date, September 18, 2023.  The judge is referencing Code of Civil Procedure Section 2030.300, which states that a party seeking to compel further responses to interrogatories must file a motion within 45 days of receiving the responses, or they waive their right to compel. The core issue the judge will likely address at the hearing is whether the motions were timely filed under this 45-day rule, or if an agreement to extend the deadline existed.

(Emphasis added)
```
And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

This tentative ruling addresses motions #1 and #2, which were filed on March 27 and 28, 2023, respectively. The original hearing dates were May 31 and July 17, 2023, but were continued to July 17 and then again to September 18, 2023. The court continued the hearing dates, and notice was waived.

The case involves the propounding party's request to compel further responses to interrogatories. The propounding party claims that the responses are evasive or incomplete, and therefore, they are entitled to a further response. The Code of Civil Procedure § 2030.300 provides guidance on this matter, stating that unless notice of the motion is given within 45 days of the service of the verified response, the propounding party waives any right to compel a further response.

The court's tentative ruling suggests that the propounding party's motion will be granted, as they have not waived their right to compel a further response. However, the court will wait for further briefing and argument before issuing a final ruling.
