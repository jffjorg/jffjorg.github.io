1.         Motion to Compel Furthers Re: Requests
for Admission
MT moves the court for an order compelling
Plaintiff to provide further responses to MT’s Requests for Admissions, Set No.
One (i.e., Nos. 1-60). MT further seeks sanctions against Plaintiff and its
counsel of record in the amount of $5,450.00.
The instant motion originally came on
calendar for hearing on July 17, 2023. The court posted the following tentative
ruling for that proceeding:
MT’s counsel Robert Scott Shtofman (‘Shtofman’) declares as follows:
On November 13, 2022, Plaintiff propounded four
separate sets of discovery on MT, including Requests for Admissions, Form and
Special Interrogatories and Requests for Production of Documents, Sets No. One;
that day, Plaintiff also propounded an additional four separate sets of
discovery on Mike. (Shtofman Decl., ¶¶ 3 and 4). Plaintiff’s counsel
subsequently denied MT’s counsel’s request for an extension of time to respond
to the aforesaid discovery. (Id., ¶¶ 5 and 6.) On January 3, 2023, MT
served the subject discovery on Plaintiff. (Id., ¶ 9, Exh. 3.) On
February 6, 2023, Plaintiff served its objection-only responses thereto. (Id.,
¶¶ 11 and 12, Exh. 4.) On March 20, 2023, Shtofman sent a meet and confer
letter to Plaintiff’s counsel. (Id., ¶ 13, Exh. 5.) No further responses
have been provided, as of the motion filing date. (Id., ¶ 15.) 
Plaintiff, in opposition, represents that
supplemental responses, sans objections, have since been provided.
(Opperwall Decl., ¶ 5, Exh. 1.) Plaintiff appears to take the position that the
subject discovery and instant motion were unnecessary because the parties
entered into a Termination Agreement (Id., ¶ 9, Exh. 4), “that
Defendants are still obligated to perform,” that if defendants fail to complete
performance of said agreement, the remedy is mediation followed by arbitration
as per an ADR clause contained therein and that the ADR clause makes no
provision for discovery. The court will not entertain the validity of
Plaintiff’s arguments (which appear irrelevant and unnecessary, given that the
instant action is not in arbitration). At any rate, the court queries why
Plaintiff would not have felt precluded by the ADR clause in the Termination
Agreement from propounding its own discovery requests to MT and Mike in
November 2022.
The motion is denied as moot, except as to
the issue of sanctions.
Sanctions
MT
seeks sanctions against Plaintiff and its counsel of record in the amount of
$5,450.00 [calculated as follows: 5.2 hours preparing motion, plus 1.5 hours
preparing separate statement, plus 1 hour preparing reply and attending hearing
at $700.00/hour, plus $60.00 filing fee].
Utilizing
a Lodestar approach, and in view of the totality of the circumstances, the
court finds that the total and reasonable amount of attorney’s fees and costs
incurred for the work performed in connection with the pending motion is $660.00
(i.e., 2 hours at $300.00/hour, plus $60.00 filing fee). Sanctions are payable
within 30 days from the date of the notice of ruling.”
The court’s July 17, 2023 minute order
reflects that, after a discussion with counsel and on the court’s own motion,
the hearing was continued to September 18, 2023. Said minute order further
provides that “[t]he parties are to meet and confer regarding outstanding
discovery. Briefs are due by each side no later than nine (9) days prior to the
next hearing date.”
On September 8, 2023, Plaintiff filed its
supplemental brief. Plaintiff asserts that the instant motion is moot, inasmuch
as it served supplemental responses which were substantive and did not contain objections.
Plaintiff asserts that after the July 17, 2023 hearing, Plaintiff’s counsel
unsuccessfully attempted to meet and confer with opposing counsel. (Opperwall
Decl., ¶¶ 14-17, Exhs. 2-5). Plaintiff asserts that, if MT is dissatisfied with
Plaintiff’s supplemental responses, MT’s recourse is to file a new Motion to
Compel Furthers directed to the supplemental responses.
On September 11, 2023, MT filed its
supplemental brief. MT’s supplemental brief does not suggest that Plaintiff’s
supplemental responses to the subject discovery were deficient in any way.
The court reaffirms, based on the above
supplemental briefs and its original tentative ruling, that the instant motion
is denied as moot, except as to the issue of sanctions, and that sanctions of
$660.00 are payable within 30 days from the date of the notice of ruling.

2.         Motion to Compel Furthers Re: Form
Interrogatories
Discussion
MT
moves the court for an order compelling Plaintiff to provide further responses
to MT’s Form Interrogatories, Set No. One (i.e., Nos. 1.1, 3.1-3.7, 4.1, 4.2,
7.1-7.3, 8.1-8.8, 9.1, 9.2, 12.1-12.7, 13.1, 13.2, 14.1, 14.2, 17.1 and
50.1-50.6). MT further seeks sanctions against Plaintiff and its counsel of
record in the amount of $4.435.00.
Again,
the instant motion originally came on calendar for hearing on July 17, 2023.
The court posted the following tentative ruling for that proceeding:
See synopsis of
Motion #1.
Plaintiff,
in opposition, represents that supplemental responses, sans objections, have
since been provided. (Opperwall Decl., ¶ 5, Exh. 1.) Again, Plaintiff raises
certain arguments (set forth in the analysis on Motion #1), which the court
declines to entertain.
The
motion is denied as moot, except as to the issue of sanctions.
Sanctions
MT seeks sanctions against
Plaintiff and its counsel of record in the amount of $4,435.00 [calculated as
follows: 5.25 hours preparing motion and separate statement, plus 1 hour
preparing reply and attending hearing at $700.00/hour, plus $60.00 filing fee].
Utilizing a Lodestar approach, and
in view of the totality of the circumstances, the court finds that the total
and reasonable amount of attorney’s fees and costs incurred for the work
performed in connection with the pending motion is $510.00 (i.e., 1.5 hours at
$300.00/hour, plus $60.00 filing fee). Sanctions are payable within 30 days
from the date of the notice of ruling.”
Again,
the court’s July 17, 2023 minute order reflects that, after a discussion with
counsel and on the court’s own motion, the hearing was continued to September
18, 2023. Said minute order further provides that “[t]he parties are to meet
and confer regarding outstanding discovery. Briefs are due by each side no
later than nine (9) days prior to the next hearing date.”
On
September 8, 2023, Plaintiff filed its supplemental brief. Plaintiff asserts
that the instant motion is moot, inasmuch as it served supplemental responses
which were substantive and did not contain objections. Plaintiff asserts that
after the July 17, 2023 hearing, Plaintiff’s counsel unsuccessfully attempted
to meet and confer with opposing counsel. (Opperwall Decl., ¶¶ 14-17, Exhs.
2-5). Plaintiff asserts that, if MT is dissatisfied with Plaintiff’s
supplemental responses, MT’s recourse is to file a new Motion to Compel
Furthers directed to the supplemental responses.
Onn
September 11, 2023, MT filed its supplemental brief. MT asserts that the
parties have never met and conferred since the motions were filed and that
Plaintiff has still failed to provide “complete and straight-forward answers to
Form Interrogatory Nos. 1.1, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 4.1, 4.2, 7.1,
7.2, 7.3, 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5, 8.6, 8.7, 8.8, 9.1, 8.2, 12.1, 12.2, 12.3,
12.4, 12.5, 12.6, 12.7, 13.1, 13.2, 14.1, 14.2, 17.1, 50.1, 50.2, 50.3, 50.4,
50.5 and 50.6.”
Plaintiff’s
position is correct: since Plaintiff has provided substantive supplemental
responses, MT’s recourse is to file a Motion to Compel Furthers directed to the
supplemental responses, in the event MT determines they are deficient.[2] The
court reaffirms, based on the above supplemental briefs and its original
tentative ruling, that the instant motion is denied as moot, except as to the
issue of sanctions, and that sanctions of $510.00 are payable within 30 days
from the date of the notice of ruling.
