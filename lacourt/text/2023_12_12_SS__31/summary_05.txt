And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling addresses a motion for summary judgment filed by Herald Christian Healthcare Center (HCHC) against Temple City, ET AL., in a case related to a trip and fall on an allegedly defective stair at Live Oak Park. HCHC argues that it is not liable for the injuries because the incident did not arise out of its acts or omissions, and that the indemnity clause in the Facility Use Agreement between HCHC and Temple City does not apply. Temple City argues that HCHC is liable because the incident was caused by APU staff participating in group photographs, and that HCHC has a contractual duty to indemnify Temple City.

The court finds that HCHC has not met its burden of showing that it is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law. The court concludes that there are triable issues of material fact regarding whether APU staff were agents of HCHC, and whether HCHC has a contractual duty to indemnify Temple City. Therefore, the court denies HCHC's motion for summary judgment.
