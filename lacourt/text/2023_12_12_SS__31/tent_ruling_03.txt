 Case Number:  20STCV49024    Hearing Date:   December 12, 2023    Dept:  31 DEPT:   31 OSC DATE:  12/12/2023 CASE NAME/NUMBER:  20STCV49024 HENG ZHAO vs GILIBERTO ZUNIGANORBERTO, et al. REQUEST FOR COURT JUDGMENT AGAINST [DEFAULTING PARTY]:  GILIBERTO ZUNIGANORBERTO,  JORGE LUIS RESENDIZAGUILAR   RECOMMENDATION:  Deny for reasons below.  TENTATIVE  This is Plaintiff’s third request for default judgment. The request for default judgment submitted on November 20, 2023 is DENIED for the following reasons:  Although Plaintiff cured some of the previously identified defects in the last denial, including obtaining new defaults, Plaintiff still has not submitted any evidence in support of the request for general damages of $4,985,000 from Zuniganorberto and $15,000 from Resendizaguilar for pain and suffering.  Plaintiff’s declaration provides no admissible evidence of the damages sought. Plaintiff again merely attaches a copy of the Traffic Collision Report (“TCR”), which is inadmissible hearsay, and a single photograph of an arm.   Facts and circumstances that establish reliable indicia of pain and suffering include evidence such as numerous visits to medical provider(s), a declaration from a treating physician, evidence of problems adjusting to injuries, permanent disfiguration or permanency of injury, disabilities, and so forth.   Plaintiff must introduce admissible prima facie evidence substantiating his claim for damages on the next request for default judgment or risk the Court awarding nominal damages for lack of support.   Because this is the second time that the Court has identified these same defects, which Plaintiff has failed to correct, Plaintiff has failed to show cause why sanctions should not be imposed for failure to comply with the Court’s prior orders and for failure to prosecute. Accordingly, the Court hereby imposes monetary sanctions of $250 payable within 30 days.  No later than __________, Plaintiff is to submit a new default judgment package correcting these defects. Failure to do so may result in the imposition of sanctions, including monetary sanctions and/or dismissal. The OSC re entry of default judgment is continued to ____________.
