The judge has denied the plaintiff's third request for default judgment against the defendants, Giliberto Zuniganorberto and Jorge Luis Resendizaguilar. The plaintiff is seeking $4,985,000 in general damages and $15,000 in pain and suffering, but has not provided admissible evidence to support these claims. The judge has previously identified defects in the plaintiff's submission, including the lack of admissible evidence, and has given the plaintiff multiple opportunities to correct these defects. Despite this, the plaintiff has failed to provide sufficient evidence to support its claims. The judge has also imposed monetary sanctions of $250 on the plaintiff for failure to comply with court orders and for failure to prosecute the case. The plaintiff is required to submit a new default judgment package correcting the defects within a certain timeframe, or risk the imposition of further sanctions or dismissal.
