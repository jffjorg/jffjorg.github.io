The English text summary is:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion to quash service of summons filed by Defendant Benyun. The motion was filed in response to Plaintiff Castellanos' attempt to serve Benyun with a summons and complaint for a motor vehicle accident. Benyun's counsel claimed that Benyun did not reside at the address where he was served, and therefore, the service was defective. The Court found that the burden was on the plaintiff to establish that the service was proper, and since Benyun's counsel presented sufficient evidence to rebut the presumption of proper service, the motion to quash was granted. The Judge noted that the Court is unable to consider the landlord's unsworn affidavit and that Plaintiff Castellanos' declaration that he ran a public search and social media search identifying the address as current as of July 31, 2023 should not be considered.
