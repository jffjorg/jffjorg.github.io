And here is a summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the motions to compel filed by American Guard Services, Inc. (AGS) without prejudice. AGS had propounded discovery requests on August 9, 2023, but the plaintiff, Justin Biggers, has not served responses to date. AGS' counsel had a telephone meet and confer with Plaintiff's counsel's paralegal, who stated that they could not locate the plaintiff and are unable to provide responses. The court finds that there is no evidence that the plaintiff was properly served with discovery and therefore denies the motions to compel. The court orders the moving party to give notice and encourages the parties to meet and confer to reach an agreement.
