And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying without prejudice the motion to be relieved as counsel filed by William Jones' attorney, Nineli Sarkissian. The motion was filed due to a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. However, the Judge denied the motion because Counsel failed to provide proof of service to Plaintiff, William Jones, and also failed to confirm his address. The Judge ordered Counsel to provide further explanation for the service of the moving papers to Plaintiff and to meet and confer with the other parties to reach an agreement. If a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling, they must send an email to the court with the subject line "SUBMIT" followed by the case number.
