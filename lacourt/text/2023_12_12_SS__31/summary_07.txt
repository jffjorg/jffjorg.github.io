And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge, Hon. Michelle C. Kim, has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion of counsel, Matthew A. Rochlin, to be relieved as counsel for the plaintiffs, Victoria Velasco, Sheyla Amaya, and Mateo Velasco. The motion is unopposed and is granted due to a breakdown in the working relationship between Counsel and Plaintiff Velasco, making it impossible for Counsel to communicate with the plaintiffs. Counsel has attached proof of service demonstrating service of the motion papers on the plaintiffs, defendant, and clerk of court. The ruling is effective upon filing proof of service of the final order. The judge encourages the parties to meet and confer to reach an agreement and reminds them to submit to the tentative ruling by email if they intend to do so. If all parties do not submit, they should appear remotely or in person for oral argument.
