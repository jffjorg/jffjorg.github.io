And here is the summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed the Plaintiff's request for default judgment against Heaberlin and Duplessis. The Plaintiff seeks damages from Duplessis as the vehicle owner, citing Vehicle Code 17151(a) which caps the vehicle owner's liability at $15,000. However, the Plaintiff failed to specify the amount sought against Duplessis, and therefore, the request for default judgment is denied. The Plaintiff must specify the amount sought against Duplessis, either $15,000 or a lesser value within the statutory cap.

Additionally, the Court notes that the statement of damages filed on October 4, 2023, increased the amount of special damages sought against the Defendants. However, the service of this amended statement of damages was improper, and personal service is required. The Plaintiff must properly serve the amended statement of damages and obtain new entry of default thereafter.

The Court also notes that this is the fifth time the Plaintiff has submitted a defective request for default judgment, and therefore, the Plaintiff has failed to show cause why sanctions should not be imposed for failure to prosecute. The Court hereby imposes monetary sanctions of $250 payable within 30 days. The OSC re entry of default judgment is continued to a later date.
