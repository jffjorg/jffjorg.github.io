Burbank Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery failed to produce the records despite the subpoena. The defendant has submitted a proof of service showing that the subpoena was personally served on the custodian of records, but the court notes that it is unclear if the individual personally served was confirmed to be the custodian of records.
