```

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling denies the defendant's motion to quash service of summons, which argued that the service was defective due to the lack of a valid seal on the summons. The defendant claimed that the seal was not affixed in accordance with Government Code section 68076, which requires the seal to be circular and at least one and one-fourth inches in diameter. However, the court found that the summons was prepared and signed by the clerk of the court, on the “Form Adopted for Mandatory Use, Judicial Council of California,” and therefore complied with the requirements of CCP section 412.20. The court also noted that the image at the bottom-left of the summons measures 1.3 inches, which is in excess of the 1 and ¼ inches required. As a result, the court denied the motion to quash service of summons.
