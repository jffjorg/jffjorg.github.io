And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the Motion to Amend Judgment filed by Judgment Creditors, Eve Somer, as Trustee of the Eve Somer Living Trust dated July 1, 2020, and Gregory C. Yaitanes, as Trustee of the Gregory C. Yaitanes Family Trust. The motion seeks to amend the Judgment to terminate the revocable licenses for encroachment Nos. 1 and 3 and remove encroachments Nos. 1-4. The court has continued the motion to December 6, 2024, at 9:00 a.m. to permit the parties to pursue a lot line adjustment with the City of Los Angeles.

The court has also ruled that the opposition's request for continuance is granted, and the parties will have 120 days to complete the lot line adjustment process. The court will hear from the parties at the hearing concerning whether additional briefing is necessary or will be permitted prior to the continued hearing date.

The court has also considered the opposition's argument that Judgment Creditors should be estopped from bringing this motion because plaintiffs and plaintiffs' successor trust failed to notify defendants of the transfer of the property. The court has ruled that this argument is without merit, as there is no provision in the Judgment or the Statement of Decision requiring plaintiffs to notify defendants of a transfer of the property.

Finally, the court has denied the opposition's alternative request to grant a permanent equitable easement in this case, as no basis for entering such an order has been established by the opposition.
