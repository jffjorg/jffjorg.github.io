```

As for the summary of the judge's tentative ruling, here is a brief summary:

* The judge denies the motion to seal the records, as the moving parties failed to follow the proper procedures for sealing records and the records are already publicly available.
* The judge also denies the motion for summary judgment, as the moving parties failed to establish that there is no triable issue of material fact and that they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law.
* The judge notes that the statute of limitations for liability not founded on an instrument in writing is two years, and that the plaintiff filed his complaint on October 6, 2022, within the two-year period following the alleged breach.
* The judge also notes that the Judicial Council's Emergency Rule 9, which tolled the statutes of limitations and repose, is still in effect until June 30, 2022, and that the plaintiff's complaint was filed within the extended statute of limitations period.
* The judge concludes that the plaintiff has a viable cause of action and that the motion for summary judgment is denied.
