Stepanyan, et al.   MOTION TO COMPEL COMPLIANCE WITH SUBPOENAMoving Party: Defendant Martin Stepanyan, DMD        Responding Party: Plaintiff Stepan Tashchyan  (No Opposition)  RELIEF REQUESTED:Order to compel Burbank Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery to comply with defendant’s deposition subpoena for production of business records. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND:Plaintiff Stepan Tashchyan alleges that in May of 2019 plaintiff entered into an oral contract with defendants Martin Stepanyan, D.D.S. and Stepanyan Surgical Arts Center wherein defendants promised to provide dental care and procedures with guaranteed outcomes in exchange for plaintiff’s payment of certain sums of money.  Plaintiff alleges that from May of 2019 plaintiff was under the dental care of defendants, and in August 2019 defendants performed a surgical procedure on plaintiff for extraction of teeth, placement of maxillary implants, placement of implant fixtures, and bone grafting.  In March of 2020, defendants performed further procedures, including uncovering.  Plaintiff alleges that shortly thereafter plaintiff began experiencing problems with the implants, such as ill-fitting implants and pieces that started to loosen and fall out, which caused plaintiff to suffer significant pain.  Plaintiff immediately informed defendant of the issues and asked for help, but defendants were unable to or refused to correct the issues.  Plaintiff alleges that because defendants were not responding to plaintiff’s requests to fix the problems, plaintiff had to seek treatment from another dental surgeon to correct the issues which caused plaintiff to incur additional costs.  The First Amended Complaint alleges that defendants breached the standard of care for dentists and dental surgeons practicing in their community, causing plaintiff injuries and damages, and also breached the contract between the parties. Plaintiff further alleges that he has made repeated requests for his medical records from defendants, but his requests were denied or ignored.  Plaintiff alleges that plaintiff contacted the Dental Board of California and filed a complaint, as a result of which some documents were finally sent to plaintiff but that the documents were missing important records, such as radiology from before and after the procedure, complete chart notes, surgical notes, and periodontal records prior to the procedure.   Plaintiff alleges that defendants’ failure to make, keep, or provide plaintiff’s complete medical records exacerbated plaintiff’s injury and delayed his ability to get further treatment and mitigate his damages.  It is also alleged that defendants’ refusal to provide complete medical records violates Health & Safety Code section 123100, et seq.  This matter was originally heard on June 14, 2024, and was continued to this date for submission by the moving party of a proof of service showing that the subject subpoena was personally served on the custodian of records for the third-party business, Burbank Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery.  The file shows that on June 17, 2024, moving party filed a Notice of Continued Hearing which was served on the other parties and the third party. On that date, moving party also filed a Proposed Order, granting the motion and ordering the third-party to comply with the deposition subpoena and provide records no later than July 19, 2024.   The order was signed and filed by the court on June 17, 2024.  On July 18, 2024, moving party filed and served a Declaration of Clark R. Hudson in Support of Defendant Martin Stepanyan, DMD’s Continued Motion to Compel.   ANALYSIS:Defendant Martin Stepanyan, DMD seeks an order compelling non-party Burbank Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery to comply with a deposition subpoena for business records.  Defendant indicates that plaintiff has identified Dr. Raffi Margossian and staff as witnesses to his allegations of negligence and damages in responses to special interrogatories, and further identified records of Dr. Margossian as substantiating his damages.  [Zaragoza Decl., Ex. A].  Dr. Margossian is evidently a subsequent treater of plaintiff for his dental issues.  Counsel for defendant has determined that Dr. Margossian is employed with Burbank Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, and defendant issued a deposition subpoena for production of business records to the entity for the records of plaintiff.  [Zaragoza Decl., Exs. B, C].  The subpoena is directed to the Custodian of Records for Burbank Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery, at the address identified in the special interrogatories for Dr. Margossian, 239 West Olive Avenue, Burbank.  [Zaragoza Decl., Ex. C].  The subpoena seeks: “ANY AND ALL MEDICAL RECORDS, DOCUMENTS, MEDICAL REPORTS, INCLUDING DOCTORS' ENTRIES, NURSES' CHARTS, PROGRESS REPORTS, PHYSICAL THERAPY RECORDS, PATHOLOGY REPORTS, X-RAY REPORTS, ALL FILMS, ORIGINAL X-RAY FILMS, MRl'S, CT SCANS, X-RAY REPORTS, LAB REPORTS, CASE HISTORY, EMERGENCY ROOM RECORDS, ADMtmNG SHEETS, DIAGNOSIS, PROGNOSIS, CONDITION, DISCHARGE, INCLUDING ANY AND ALL DENTAL RECORDS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO: COPY OF FRONT/BACK OF TREATMENT FILE FOLDERS; DENTIST NOTES; DENTAL ASSISTANT NOTES; HYGIENISTS RECORDS; STUDY MODELS; CASTS; MOLDS; SLIDES; PHOTOGRAPHS; SKETCHES; TRACINGS; DIAGRAMS; DENTAL APPLIANCES; WAX-UPS; DRAWINGS; NOTES; CORRESPONDENCE; ALL COMPUTER GENERATED NOTES; LETTERS, PHONE MESSAGES, ALL BILLINGS, STATEMENTS OF ACCOUNTS, WRITINGS, AND DOCUMENTS REFLECTING THE FOLLOWING: ANY AND ALL PAYMENTS MADE OR RECEIVED IN REFERENCE TO SAID PATIENT, ANY AND ALL CREDITS, ADJUSTMENTS, WRITE.OFFS, RECONCILIATIONS, CONTRACT PRICE PAYMENTS OR REDUCTION, PAYMENTS BY ANY HEAL TH INSURANCE ENTITY, PERSONAL PAYMENTS BY OR TO SAID PATIENT FROM ANY SOURCE, HMO, PPO, MEDI-CAL, MEDICARE OR CONTRACT PAYMENTS BY ANY ENTITY CONCERNING SAID PATIENT, BILLING LEDGERS, REPORTS AND/OR STATEMENTS OF CHARGES RENDERED ANO ANY INSURANCE RECORDS. THIS REQUEST FOR RECORDS INCLUDES ANY AND ALL EVIDENCE OF ANY PAYMENTS FROM ANY SOURCE REGARDING THE ACCOUNT OF THIS PATIENT TO OR FROM ANY PERSON AND/OR ENTITY, BILLING LEDGERS, DEMONSTRATIVE MATERIALS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY RECORDS/DOCUMENTS THAT MAY BE STORED DIGITALLY AND/OR ELECTRONICALLY INCLUDING ALL PATIENT ORDERS AND PATIENT RESULTS AND SPECIFICALLY FOR ANY DISCHARGE ORDERS, ALL DETAILED SCREEN SHOTS WITHIN ANY COMPUTER SYSTEM AFFECTING OR RELATING TO STEPHAN S. TASHCHYAN AKA STEPHAN TASHCHYAN, DOB: 9/21/1956 SS#: XXX-XX•9902. TO INCLUDE RECORDS OF RAFFI MARGOSSIAN, DDS.”[Ex. C, Deposition Subpoena, Attach. 3 No documents have been produced, despite requests from the litigation support services company designated to copy the records and meet and confer efforts on the part of defendant, and plaintiff has not objected to or filed a motion to quash the subpoena for the subject records.   [Zaragoza Decl., paras. 4-11, Exs. D, F]. Under CCP § 2017.010, “any party may obtain discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action..., if the matter either is itself admissible in evidence or appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.”  CCP § 2020.220(c) provides, in pertinent part:“(c) Personal service of any deposition subpoena is effective to require all of the following of any deponent who is a resident of California at the time of service (1) Personal attendance and testimony, if the subpoena so specifies.(2)   Any specified production, inspection, testing and sampling....”  In this case, the court had been previously unable to determine if the subpoena had been personally served on the custodian of records of the deponent, or that defendant had obtained personal jurisdiction over the deponent. Defendant has now submitted the proof of service, which shows that the subpoena was personally delivered to “NATALIE (NO LAST NAME PROVIDED,” the Custodian of Records for Burbank Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery, on April 4, 2023.  [Hudson Decl., para. 1, Ex. G].   The deponent has now also been served with the supplemental declaration and notice of continuance of the hearing date.  It is not clear that the individual personally served was confirmed to be the custodian of records, or that the other documents were served on a confirmed custodian of records.   This issue will be discussed at the hearing.  If the court is satisfied that service has been properly made, and there continues to be no opposition to the motion, the court’s order of June 17, 2024 will stand, and the motion will be granted, as the subpoena seeks discoverable records, which were not produced in accordance with the subpoena, by April 17, 2023, and the paperwork appears in order.  With respect to sanctions, which are sought against the deponent, monetary sanctions for the expense of bringing this motion are sought pursuant to CCP section 2020.240, which provides:“A deponent who disobeys a deposition subpoena in any manner described in subdivision (c) of Section 2020.220 may be punished for contempt under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) without the necessity of a prior order of court directing compliance by the witness. The deponent is also subject to the forfeiture and the payment of damages set forth in Section 1992.” Under CCP section 1992:“A person failing to appear pursuant to a subpoena or a court order also forfeits to the party aggrieved the sum of five hundred dollars ($500), and all damages that he or she may sustain by the failure of the person to appear pursuant to the subpoena or court order, which forfeiture and damages may be recovered in a civil action.”(Emphasis added) The statute accordingly requires that a separate civil action be filed to obtain forfeiture and damages under this section.  While the California Supreme Court has noted that this is an impractical remedy (see New York Times v. Superior Court (1990) 51 Cal.3d 453, 464), this provision remains substantially unchanged in the Discovery Act, and does not permit the recovery of sanctions against the third party in this action.   The court notes it would not be inclined to award sanctions against the deponent in any case, as the deponent is a health care provider with patient privacy obligations.   Sanctions are denied. RULING:Defendant Martin Stepanyan, DMD’s Motion to Compel Burbank Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery’s Compliance with Deposition Subpoena for Production of Business Records is GRANTED.  Court order of June 17, 2024 remains the Order of the Court. Request for sanctions is DENIED.  DEPARTMENT D IS CONTINUING TO CONDUCT AND ENCOURAGE AUDIO OR VIDEO APPEARANCESPlease make arrangement in advance if you wish to appear via LACourtConnect by visiting www.lacourt.org to schedule a remote appearance.  Please note that LACourtConnect offers free audio and video appearances.  However, ADVANCE REGISTRATION IS REQUIRED. If no appearance is set up through LACourtConnect, or no appearance is otherwise made, then the Court will assume the parties are submitting on the tentative.
