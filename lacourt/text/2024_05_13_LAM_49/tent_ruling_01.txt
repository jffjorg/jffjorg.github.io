  Case Number:  18STCV04752    Hearing Date:   May 13, 2024    Dept:  49 Kurt Knutsson, et al. v. Judith Salkow Shapiro, et al.DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO STRIKE THE THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT MOVING PARTIES: Defendants Judith Salkow Shapiro, A.P.C., and San Pasqual Fiduciary Trust CompanyRESPONDING PARTY(S): Plaintiffs Kurt Knutsson and Woojivas, Inc.STATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:Plaintiffs Kurt Knutsson and Woojivas, Inc. bring this suit against the law corporation of their deceased former lawyer, Judith Salkow Shapiro, for legal malpractice and fraud in the handling of an underlying employment and right of publicity action against KTLA, Local TV, and other television stations.  The operative Third Amended Complaint asserts causes of action for (1) Breach of Contract, (2) Professional Negligence/Legal Malpractice, (3) Fraud and Deceit, (4) Negligent Misrepresentation, and (5) Breach of Fiduciary Duty.  Defendants now move to strike portions of the Third Amended Complaint. Plaintiffs opposed.TENTATIVE RULING:Defendants’ Motion to Strike is GRANTED. The portions of the TAC identified in the notice of motion (see Notice p. 2, lines 6-13) are hereby ordered stricken.Defendants are ordered to give notice.DISCUSSION:Motion to Strike I. Legal StandardA motion to strike lies either (1) to strike any irrelevant, false or improper matter inserted in any pleading; or (2) to strike any pleading or part thereof not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule or order of court.  (CCP § 436.)II. Meet and ConferThe declaration of attorney Adam A. Ainslie reflects the meet and confer requirement has been satisfied.III. AnalysisDefendants move to strike portions of the Third Amended Complaint. Plaintiffs initially named the beneficiaries of the Shapiro Family Trust as Defendants in this action, but dismissed them without prejudice pursuant to a tolling agreement. Plaintiffs then moved this court to vacate the dismissals. At the February 15, 2024 hearing on that motion, all parties orally stipulated to bring the beneficiaries back into the action. The court gave Plaintiffs leave to file a Third Amended Complaint to do so. Defendants now contend, however, that Plaintiffs “went well beyond what was agreed and permitted, and filed an amended complaint with numerous additional allegations against Shapiro.” (Mtn. 3: 9-10.) The court agrees that Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint with allegations that exceed the scope of leave granted by this court and understood by the parties. The purpose of the amendments was to add the beneficiaries back into the action, as well as allegations showing that the statute of limitations would not be an issue. As stated at the hearing on the record, a simple reference to the tolling agreement would be sufficient to accomplish this. Nothing more, nothing less.Plaintiffs were not given leave, however, to supplement the pleading with allegations to bolster their claims against Shapiro. Plaintiffs feigned ignorance or dispute of this point in their opposition based on the lack of a transcript with the moving papers is unavailing and disingenuous. If Plaintiffs wish to file an amended pleading containing additional allegations against Shapiro, they must file a noticed motion for leave to file an amended complaint. This court is well aware of the policy favoring liberal amendments (Howard v. County of San Diego (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 1422, 1428), and that absent prejudice to the adverse party, the court may permit amendments to the complaint “at any stage of the proceedings, up to and including trial.” (Atkinson v. Elk Corp. (2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 739, 761 [internal quotes omitted].) These are considerations to be made if and when a proper motion for leave appears before this court.Accordingly, Defendants’ Motion to Strike is GRANTED. The portions of the TAC identified in the notice of motion (see Notice p. 2, lines 6-13) are hereby ordered stricken.Defendants are ordered to give notice.IT IS SO ORDERED.Dated:   May 13, 2024 ___________________________________ Randolph M. Hammock Judge of the Superior Court*********************************************************************************************************************************************************DEFENDANTS’ DEMURRER TO THE THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT MOVING PARTIES: Defendants, Susan Salkow Shapiro Moss, Kenneth Salkow-Shapiro, and Ben ShapiroRESPONDING PARTY(S): Plaintiffs Kurt Knutsson and Woojivas, Inc.STATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS: Plaintiffs Kurt Knutsson and Woojivas, Inc. bring this suit against the law corporation of their deceased former lawyer, Judith Salkow Shapiro, for legal malpractice and fraud in the handling of an underlying employment and right of publicity action against KTLA, Local TV, and other television stations.  The operative Third Amended Complaint asserts causes of action for (1) Breach of Contract, (2) Professional Negligence/Legal Malpractice, (3) Fraud and Deceit, (4) Negligent Misrepresentation, and (5) Breach of Fiduciary Duty.  Defendant Beneficiaries now demurrer to the Third Amended Complaint. Plaintiffs opposed.TENTATIVE RULING:Defendants’ Demurrer as to all Causes of Action asserted against Kenneth and Barbara as purported Trustees of the Trusts is SUSTAINED. Generally speaking, leave to amend must be allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.) Plaintiffs are given limited leave to substitute the appropriate trustee(s), if applicable.Defendants’ Demurrer is OVERRULED as to the remaining Defendants.Defendants are to file an Answer to the 3AC within 21 days.DISCUSSION:DemurrerI. Meet and ConferThe Declaration of Alexandra L. Letzel, Counsel for Defendants, reflects that the parties met and conferred.II. Judicial NoticePursuant to Defendants’ request, the court takes judicial notice of Exhibits 1 and 2. (See Paragraph (IV)(A), infra, for further discussion.)III. Legal StandardA demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action.  (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal. App. 4th 740, 747.)  When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in context.  (Taylor v. City of Los Angeles Dept. of Water and Power (2006) 144 Cal. App. 4th 1216, 1228.)  In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or by proper judicial notice.  (CCP § 430.30(a).)  A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters.  (SKF Farms v. Superior Court (1984) 153 Cal. App. 3d 902, 905.)  Therefore, it lies only where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed.  (Id.)  The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters, states a cause of action.  (Hahn, 147 Cal.App.4th at 747.)  IV. AnalysisA. Demurrer as to TrusteesFirst, the Beneficiaries argue that each cause of action against Kenneth, as Trustee of the Shapiro Family Trust FBO Kenneth Salkow-Shapiro (“Kenneth’s Trust”), and Barbara Zipkin (“Barbara”), as Trustee of the Shapiro Family Trust FBO Ben Shapiro (“Ben’s Trust”), fail because (1) Kenneth is not and never has been the Trustee of Kenneth’s Trust and (2) Barbara resigned as Trustee of Ben’s Trust after the tolling agreement was executed. In support of these contentions, the Beneficiaries ask the court to take judicial notice of the Tolling Agreement that Plaintiffs’ signed and attached to their counsel’s declaration in support of their Motion to Vacate, which reflects that Kenneth’s Trust has a corporate trustee. (See RJN, Exh. 1.) They also ask the court to take judicial notice of a copy of Ms. Zipkin’s fully executed and notarized resignation, which reflects she is no longer a Trustee. (RJN, Exh. 2.) In opposition, Plaintiffs argue only that the Beneficiaries’ requests for judicial notice is improper because the facts are reasonably in dispute. Defendants’ Exhibit 1 is the tolling agreement submitted by Plaintiffs in support of their previous motion to vacate. It lists a corporate entity as Trustee. But Plaintiffs argue this “may be nothing more than a typing error.” (Opp. 15: 16-17.) Absent more, Plaintiffs’ have failed to demonstrate that the Exhibit is reasonably subject to dispute. Merely claiming the potential of a typing error is insufficient. Exhibit 1 therefore establishes that Kenneth is not Trustee of the Shapiro Family Trust FBO Kenneth Salkow-Shapiro. Accordingly, any claims against him as Trustee fail.Defendants’ Exhibit 2 is a notarized document indicating Barbara Zipkin’s resignation as co-Trustee of the Shapiro Family GST Exempt Trust FBO Ben Shapiro. (See RJN, Exh. 2.) Plaintiffs argue this “declaration” is not a proper subject of judicial notice. However, the Exhibit is not a declaration, but a notarized document showing Zipkin’s resignation. Again, Plaintiffs have failed to show that this document is reasonably subject to dispute. Moreover, courts may take judicial notice of “facts that can be deduced, and/or clearly derived from, [a document’s] legal effect, such as the names and dates contained in the document, and the legal consequences of the document. [Citations]. This is different from taking judicial notice of the truth of specific factual representations within a document.” (Julian Volunteer Fire Co. Assn. v. Julian-Cuyamaca Fire Prot. Dist. (2021) 62 Cal. App. 5th 583, 600.)Therefore, Exhibit 2 establishes that Barbara is no longer Trustee of the Shapiro Family Trust FBO Ben Shapiro. Accordingly, Defendants’ Demurrer as to all Causes of Action asserted against Kenneth and Barbara as purported Trustees of the Trusts is SUSTAINED. Generally speaking, leave to amend must be allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.) Plaintiffs are given limited leave to substitute the appropriate trustee(s), if applicable.B. Demurrer Based on Probate CodeNext, the Beneficiaries argue the claims against them fail because Plaintiffs have failed to plead facts supporting liability against them. Probate Code Section 19400 states:Subject to Section 366.2 of the Code of Civil Procedure, if there is no proceeding to administer the probate estate of the deceased settlor, and if the trustee does not file a proposed notice to creditors pursuant to Section 19003 and does not publish notice to creditors pursuant to Chapter 3 (commencing with Section 19040), then a beneficiary of the trust to whom payment, delivery, or transfer of the deceased settlor’s property is made pursuant to the terms of the trust is personally liable, to the extent provided in Section 19402, for the unsecured claims of the creditors of the deceased settlor’s probate estate.”Section 19402 provides, in pertinent part, that “personal liability under this chapter is applicable only to the extent the claim of the creditor cannot be satisfied out of the trust estate of the deceased settlor and is limited to a pro rata portion of the claim of the creditor, based on the proportion that the value of the property distributed to the person out of the trust estate…” (Cal. Prob. Code. § 19402(b) [emphasis added].) The crux of the Beneficiaries argument is that Probate Code section 19400 & 19402 relief cannot be invoked here because there are no allegations demonstrating that Shapiro’s revocable trust is inadequate to satisfy the claim. The beneficiaries argue the mere allegation based on information and belief that that the trust is inadequate is insufficient. (See TAC ¶ 11 [“Plaintiffs are further informed and believe and on that basis allege that the assets of the Shapiro Family Trust are not sufficient to satisfy a judgment in the amount that Plaintiffs’ damages expert has estimated will be owing to Plaintiffs in this action, which totals between $8 million and upwards of $10 million”].)Under California’s “fact-pleading” rule, allegations need only provide fair notice of the claim and must be liberally construed. (Medical Marijuana, Inc. v. ProjectCBD.com (2020) 46 Cal.App.5th 869, 886.) The plaintiff satisfies this burden by alleging ultimate, as opposed to evidentiary facts that “ ‘as a whole apprise[ ] the adversary of the factual basis of the claim. [Citations.]’ ” (Id.) The essential elements to be pleaded “are determined by the substantive law that defines the cause of action.” (Foster v. Sexton (2021) 61 Cal. App. 5th 998, 1018.) In addition, “[l]ess specificity is required when ‘it appears from the nature of the allegations that the defendant must necessarily possess full information concerning the facts of the controversy.’” (Comm. On Children's Television, Inc. v. Gen. Foods Corp. (1983) 35 Cal. 3d 197, 217.)Here, it appears from the allegations that the relevant facts rest within the knowledge of the Defendants. For pleadings purposes, Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged that the assets of the Shapiro Family Trust are not sufficient to satisfy the potential judgment. Nothing more is required at the pleading stage. Next, the Beneficiaries assert that claims against them are improper so long as the underlying claims are pending. As the court understands that argument, the Beneficiaries suggest that any relief against them can only be sought after a judgment has been entered against the Law Corporation and Trust. While the court agrees that the Probate Code and cases interpreting it appear to contemplate this two-step scenario, the court is unaware of any authority requiring that the claims proceed separately or in two separate actions. Notably, section 19402 refers to “claims,” not “judgments.” The Probate Code defines claims as “a demand for payment…whether due, not due, accrued or not accrued, or contingent, and whether liquidated or unliquidated.” (§ 19000(a). Thus, Plaintiffs’ may pursue their pending “claims” against the beneficiaries, even though it is not certain at this time that the assets of the Shapiro Family Trust will be insufficient to satisfy the potential judgment.  [FN 1]Be that as it may, and contrary to Plaintiffs’ contention, this court is equally unconvinced the law requires that the claims must proceed together in this manner. This is all to say that Plaintiffs’ course of action appears permissible, but not mandatory.Accordingly, Defendants’ Demurrer to the Third Amended Complaint on this ground is OVERRULED.IT IS SO ORDERED.Dated:   May 13, 2024 ___________________________________ Randolph M. Hammock Judge of the Superior CourtFN 1 - Of course, these Code sections and cases interpreting them may dictate the procedure by which Plaintiffs can ultimately attempt to collect on any potential judgment in this matter. The court takes no position on that procedure at this time. It concludes only that the matter may proceed as pled.********************************************************************************************************************************************************  Any party may submit on the tentative ruling by contacting the courtroom via email at Smcdept49@lacourt.org by no later than 4:00 p.m. the day before the hearing.  All interested parties must be copied on the email.  It should be noted that if you submit on a tentative ruling the court will still conduct a hearing if any party appears.
