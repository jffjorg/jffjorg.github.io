MIL No.1 For An Order To Preclude Any Documents Not
  Produced In Discovery
·      
  Written Response by Prokupek, et al. 
NOT CONCRETE OR SPECIFIC:
This motion
  in limine is plagued by the same defects noted by the Court of Appeal in Kelly
  v. New West Federal Savings (1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 659:
On the other hand, many of the motions
  filed by Amtech were not properly the subject of motions in limine, were not
  adequately presented, or sought rulings which would merely be declaratory of
  existing law or would not provide any meaningful guidance for the parties or
  witnesses. For example, motion No. 19 sought to “... exclude any testimony of
  the plaintiffs which is speculative.” No factual support or argument was
  presented to suggest the nature and type of speculative testimony which
  Amtech expected to be elicited from plaintiffs. Motions No. 8, 20 and 21
  sought to exclude evidence of prior incidents unless an appropriate foundation
  was established to show the relevance of such evidence or that the prior
  incidents were similar in nature to the incident involved in the suit. Again,
  no factual support was presented in connection with the motions, meaning the
  court would have to rule in a vacuum. Motion No. 7, previously referred to,
  sought to limit the opinions of plaintiffs experts to those “rendered at
  deposition and in written reports.” Again, there was no supporting evidence
  to suggest what opinions had been rendered at the depositions, leaving the
  court and the parties to guess what opinions during trial may be included
  within the scope of the ruling. Motion No. 6 sought an order precluding
  plaintiffs from calling any witnesses “not previously identified in
  plaintiffs' discovery responses.” Absent a meaningful and expressed belief
  that this may occur, this was a meaningless motion unless and until
  plaintiffs attempted to call such witnesses.
(Kelly v.
  New West Federal Savings (1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 659, 670–671.)
For the same
  reasons stated in Kelly v. New West Federal Savings, the motion in
  limine here is not specific enough for the Court to make a meaningful order.  The motion fails to identify what specific
  evidence the moving party seeks to exclude. 
  As such, the motion in limine also fails to comply with Local Rule
  3.57.  (Super. Ct. L.A. County, Local
  Rules, rule 3.57(a)(1) [“Motions made for the purpose of precluding the
  mention or display of inadmissible and prejudicial matter in the presence of
  the jury must be accompanied by a declaration that includes the following: (1)
  Specific identification of the matter alleged to be inadmissible and
  prejudicial.”].)  Instead of
  identifying the specific evidence that the motion seeks to exclude, this
  motion in limine amounts to little more than a restatement of the law and
  general legal principles.  Accordingly,
  the Court DENIES the motion in limine. 
  The moving party may at trial assert an objection to the introduction
  of specific evidence if and when this issue arises.

MIL No. 2 For An Order
  Excluding Any Evidence Or Testimony Concerning Plaintiff’s HIV Status
 
·            
  Written Response by Prokupek, et al. 
·            
  Weber’s Joinder to Prokupek’s Response
352 EXCLUDE:
The Court has weighed the probative value of such evidence
  against the danger of undue prejudice and risk of necessitating undue
  consumption of time.  The Court has
  determined that the probative value of such evidence is substantially
  outweighed by the probability that its admission will necessitate undue
  consumption of time and create substantial danger of undue prejudice,
  confusing the issues, and misleading the jury.  (Evid. Code, § 352.)  Therefore, the Court GRANTS he motion in
  limine.
 




·                                                                                                
   


MIL No. 3 For An Order
  Excluding Any Evidence Or Testimony Concerning Plaintiff Having An STI
 
NO OPPOSITION:
The Court has read and considered the motion in limine,
  and because there is no opposition, the Court GRANTS the motion in limine.

MIL No. 4 For An Order Excluding Any Evidence Or
  Testimony Concerning Plaintiff’s Sexual Orientation 
NO OPPOSITION:
The Court has read and considered the motion in limine,
  and because there is no opposition, the Court GRANTS the motion in limine.

MIL No. 5 For An Order Excluding Non-Expert Witnesses
  
·      
  Written Response by Prokupek, et al. 
·      
  Weber’s Joinder to Prokupek’s Response
NOT A MIL:
This is not a motion in limine as it does not seek
  exclusion or limitation of any evidence. 
  Therefore, the Court DENIES the motion in limine.  
The Court, however, notes that its Standing Order is to
  exclude ALL witnesses from the Courtroom until they have testified and are
  excused, subject to further arguments of any party.

(B)       DEFENDANT WEBER’S MOTION IN LIMINE AND JOINDERS 




·                                                                                                
   


MIL No. 1 To Preclude Cumulative Testimony On Standard Of Care
  By Plaintiff’s Experts
·            
  Written Opposition by Plaintiff 
 
EXPERT WITNESS:  CUMULATIVE
“The court may, at any time before or
  during the trial of an action, limit the number of expert witnesses to be
  called by any party.”  (Evid. Code, §
  723.)  
Trial courts
  may not use their powers to control the orderly conduct of the proceedings,
  to prevent cumulative evidence, and to limit the number of expert witnesses,
  if it destroys a plaintiff's evidentiary presentation.  Overly restrictive limitations on the
  introduction of evidence and on the method and manner of presenting a case
  can undercut a plaintiff's case by preventing that party from presenting
  evidence in an organized and coherent way. Even if a defense expert will
  testify to the same conclusion as a plaintiff's own expert, the testimony
  will not be identical, will have different focuses, and will be accompanied
  by different explanations. Subtleties in responses can be critical.
  Repetition is often the key to believability, and credibility may be enhanced
  when a defense expert agrees with a plaintiff's expert. Identical or
  virtually identical evidence may not be cumulative if there is significance
  to the evidentiary weight to be given.  It is often invaluable to have evidence come
  from different sources.
(Monroy v.
  City of Los Angeles (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 248, 266–267 [cleaned up].)  Here, unlike the plaintiff in Monroy v.
  City of Los Angeles, the moving party is seeking to present cumulative
  expert witness testimony regarding the standard of care for a nurse
  practitioner.  Moreover, the moving
  party has designated and intends to call an expert witness, Elena Rubin, concerning
  the standard of care for a nurse practitioner.  Therefore, the Court GRANTS the motion in
  limine.

MIL No. 5 To
  Limit Expert Witnesses To Opinions And Conclusions As Testified To At Their
  Depositions And Order Precluding Testimony Based On Newly Acquired
  Information;
·      
  Written Opposition by Plaintiff 
KENNEMUR:  EXCLUSION OF EXPERT WITNESS OPINIONS NOT
  DISCLOSED
The
  Legislature has singled out the pretrial discovery of expert opinions for
  special treatment. When appropriate demand is made for exchange of expert
  witness lists, the party is required to disclose not only the name, address
  and qualifications of the witness but the general substance of the testimony
  the witness is expected to give at trial.   In our view, this means the party must
  disclose either in his witness exchange list or at his expert's deposition,
  if the expert is asked, the substance of the facts and the opinions which the
  expert will testify to at trial.  Only
  by such a disclosure will the opposing party have reasonable notice of the
  specific areas of investigation by the expert, the opinions he has reached
  and the reasons supporting the opinions, to the end the opposing party can
  prepare for cross-examination and rebuttal of the expert's testimony. Only by
  such a disclosure will the possibility of a reasonable settlement of the case
  before trial be encouraged.
(Kennemur v.
  State of California (1982) 133 Cal.App.3d 907, 919, citation omitted (hereafter
  Kennemur).)  
The moving party’s
  Kennemur objection is premature at this juncture.  The Court cannot anticipate at this time
  whether each and every possible opinion that the opposing party may attempt
  to elicit from expert witnesses at trial will fall within the scope of an
  expert witness’  deposition testimony
  or potentially extend beyond the opinions that an expert witness rendered
  during his deposition.  This is not an
  objection that the Court can sustain before trial and not a motion in limine
  that the Court can grant before an expert witness testifies at trial.  If the moving party has properly asked an
  expert witness at his/her deposition whether he/she has completely testified
  as to the universe of all of his/her opinions and has not omitted any
  opinions, and if the opposing party attempts to elicit a new opinion at trial

MIL No. 6 For
  An Order Forbidding Textbooks On Direct Examination
NOT CONCRETE OR
  SPECIFIC:
This motion in limine is plagued by the
  same defects noted by the Court of Appeal in Kelly v. New West Federal
  Savings (1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 659:
“On
  the other hand, many of the motions filed by Amtech were not properly the
  subject of motions in limine, were not adequately presented, or sought
  rulings which would merely be declaratory of existing law or would not
  provide any meaningful guidance for the parties or witnesses. For example,
  motion No. 19 sought to “... exclude any testimony of the plaintiffs which is
  speculative.” No factual support or argument was presented to suggest the
  nature and type of speculative testimony which Amtech expected to be elicited
  from plaintiffs. Motions No. 8, 20 and 21 sought to exclude evidence of prior
  incidents unless an appropriate foundation was established to show the
  relevance of such evidence or that the prior incidents were similar in nature
  to the incident involved in the suit. Again, no factual support was presented
  in connection with the motions, meaning the court would have to rule in a
  vacuum. Motion No. 7, previously referred to, sought to limit the opinions of
  plaintiffs experts to those “rendered at deposition and in written reports.”
  Again, there was no supporting evidence to suggest what opinions had been
  rendered at the depositions, leaving the court and the parties to guess what
  opinions during trial may be included within the scope of the ruling. Motion
  No. 6 sought an order precluding plaintiffs from calling any witnesses “not
  previously identified in plaintiffs' discovery responses.” Absent a
  meaningful and expressed belief that this may occur, this was a meaningless
  motion unless and until plaintiffs attempted to call such witnesses.”
(Kelly v. New West Federal Savings
  (1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 659, 670–671.)
For the same reasons stated in Kelly v.
  New West Federal Savings, the motion in limine here is not specific
  enough for the Court to make a meaningful order.  The motion fails to identify what specific
  evidence the moving party seeks to exclude. 
  As such, the motion in limine also fails to comply with Local Rule
  3.57.  (Super. Ct. L.A. County, Local
  Rules, rule 3.57(a)(1) [“Motions made for the purpose of precluding the
  mention or display of inadmissible and prejudicial matter in the presence of
  the jury must be accompanied by a declaration that includes the following: (1)
  Specific identification of the matter alleged to be inadmissible and
  prejudicial.”].)  Instead of
  identifying the specific evidence that the motion seeks to exclude, this
  motion in limine amounts to little more than a restatement of the law and
  general legal principles.  Accordingly,
  the Court DENIES the motion in limine. 
  The moving party may at trial assert an objection to the introduction
  of specific evidence if and when this issue arises.

MIL No. 8 For
  An Order Precluding Evidence Of Medical Expenses Billed
HOWELL:
“[A] plaintiff
  may recover as economic damages no more than the reasonable value of the
  medical services received and is not entitled to recover the reasonable value
  if his or her actual loss was less.”  (Howell
  v. Hamilton Meats & Provisions, Inc. (2011) 52 Cal.4th 541, 555 (hereafter
  Howell).)  “[A]n injured
  plaintiff whose medical expenses are paid through private insurance may
  recover as economic damages no more than the amounts paid by the plaintiff or
  his or her insurer for the medical services received or still owing at the
  time of trial.”  (Id. at p.
  566.)  
It follows
  from our holding that when a medical care provider has, by agreement with the
  plaintiff's private health insurer, accepted as full payment for the
  plaintiff's care an amount less than the provider's full bill, evidence of
  that amount is relevant to prove the plaintiff's damages for past medical
  expenses and, assuming it satisfies other rules of evidence, is admissible at
  trial. Evidence that such payments were made in whole or in part by an
  insurer remains, however, generally inadmissible under the evidentiary aspect
  of the collateral source rule. (Hrnjak v. Graymar, Inc., supra, 4 Cal.3d at
  p. 732, 94 Cal.Rptr. 623, 484 P.2d 599.) Where the provider has, by prior
  agreement, accepted less than a billed amount as full payment, evidence of
  the full billed amount is not itself relevant on the issue of past medical
  expenses. We express no opinion as to its relevance or admissibility on other
  issues, such as noneconomic damages or future medical expenses. (The issue is
  not presented here because defendant, in this court, conceded it was proper
  for the jury to hear evidence of plaintiff's full medical bills.)
(Howell, supra, 52 Cal.4th at p.
  567.)   Here, the moving party seeks to exclude
  evidence of health care expenses which were billed, not paid or due.  Under Howell, the moving party’s request
  is proper.  Therefore, the Court GRANTS
  the unopposed motion limine.

MIL No. 1 To Exclude
  Testimony or Argument Of The "Golden Rule”
GOLDEN RULE/REPTILE
  THEORY:
This is not a
  motion in limine as it does not seek exclusion or limitation of any specific evidence.  Therefore, the Court DENIES the motion in
  limine.   But the Court agrees with the moving party’s
  contention that any reference to the “Golden Rule” in the presence of the
  jury is prohibited.  
The jury must impartially determine pain and
  suffering damages based upon evidence specific to the plaintiff, as opposed
  to statistical data concerning the public at large. The only person whose
  pain and suffering is relevant in calculating a general damage award is the
  plaintiff. How others would feel if placed in the plaintiff's position is
  irrelevant. It is improper, for example, for an attorney to ask jurors how
  much they would “charge” to undergo equivalent pain and suffering. This
  so-called “golden rule” argument is impermissible.
(Cassim v.
  Allstate Ins. Co. (2004) 33 Cal.4th 780, 798 [cleaned up].)   
               “The
  law, like boxing, prohibits hitting below the belt. The basic rule forbids an
  attorney to pander to the prejudice, passion or sympathy of the jury.  For example, an attorney representing a
  public entity commits misconduct by appealing to the jurors' self-interest as
  taxpayers. An attorney's appeal in closing argument to the jurors'
  self-interest is improper and thus is misconduct because such arguments tend
  to undermine the jury's impartiality.” 
  (Regalado v. Callaghan (2016) 3 Cal.App.5th 582, 598 [cleaned
  up].)  Further, “ ‘reptile theory’
  arguments, which are improper appeals to a jury's emotions by arguing a
  defendant's conduct threatens the community's safety.”  (Russell v. Department of Corrections &
  Rehabilitation (2021) 72 Cal.App.5th 916, 941, citation omitted.)

  Other Manner Conveying to the Jury Any Expert Opinions Except Those Stated in
  Their Depositions and Precluding Plaintiff’s Experts from Testifying to
  Opinions and/or Conclusions Based Upon Material Available but Not Reviewed
  Prior to Their Depositions
KENNEMUR:  EXCLUSION
  OF EXPERT WITNESS OPINIONS NOT DISCLOSED
The Legislature has singled out the pretrial
  discovery of expert opinions for special treatment. When appropriate demand
  is made for exchange of expert witness lists, the party is required to
  disclose not only the name, address and qualifications of the witness but the
  general substance of the testimony the witness is expected to give at trial.   In our view, this means the party must
  disclose either in his witness exchange list or at his expert's deposition,
  if the expert is asked, the substance of the facts and the opinions which the
  expert will testify to at trial.  Only
  by such a disclosure will the opposing party have reasonable notice of the
  specific areas of investigation by the expert, the opinions he has reached
  and the reasons supporting the opinions, to the end the opposing party can
  prepare for cross-examination and rebuttal of the expert's testimony. Only by
  such a disclosure will the possibility of a reasonable settlement of the case
  before trial be encouraged.
(Kennemur v. State of California (1982) 133
  Cal.App.3d 907, 919, citation omitted (hereafter Kennemur).)  
The moving party’s Kennemur objection is premature
  at this juncture.  The Court cannot
  anticipate at this time whether each and every possible opinion that the opposing
  party may attempt to elicit from expert witnesses at trial will fall within
  the scope of an expert witness’  deposition testimony or potentially extend
  beyond the opinions that an expert witness rendered during his
  deposition.  This is not an objection
  that the Court can sustain before trial and not a motion in limine that the
  Court can grant before an expert witness testifies at trial.  If the moving party has properly asked an
  expert witness at his/her deposition whether he/she has completely testified
  as to the universe of all of his/her opinions and has not omitted any
  opinions, and if the opposing party attempts to elicit a new opinion at trial
  about which an expert witness did not testify during his deposition,  the moving party may make a Kennemur
  objection, and the Court will rule on such objection at that time.

  Plaintiff from Any and All References or Evidence Relating to Medical
  Expenses in Excess of Amounts Actually Paid or Incurred
HOWELL:
“[A] plaintiff may recover as economic damages no more
  than the reasonable value of the medical services received and is not
  entitled to recover the reasonable value if his or her actual loss was less.”  (Howell v. Hamilton Meats &
  Provisions, Inc. (2011) 52 Cal.4th 541, 555 (hereafter Howell).)  “[A]n injured plaintiff whose medical
  expenses are paid through private insurance may recover as economic damages
  no more than the amounts paid by the plaintiff or his or her insurer for the
  medical services received or still owing at the time of trial.”  (Id. at p. 566.)  
It follows from our holding that when a medical care
  provider has, by agreement with the plaintiff's private health insurer,
  accepted as full payment for the plaintiff's care an amount less than the
  provider's full bill, evidence of that amount is relevant to prove the
  plaintiff's damages for past medical expenses and, assuming it satisfies
  other rules of evidence, is admissible at trial. Evidence that such payments
  were made in whole or in part by an insurer remains, however, generally
  inadmissible under the evidentiary aspect of the collateral source rule.
  (Hrnjak v. Graymar, Inc., supra, 4 Cal.3d at p. 732, 94 Cal.Rptr. 623, 484
  P.2d 599.) Where the provider has, by prior agreement, accepted less than a
  billed amount as full payment, evidence of the full billed amount is not
  itself relevant on the issue of past medical expenses. We express no opinion
  as to its relevance or admissibility on other issues, such as noneconomic
  damages or future medical expenses. (The issue is not presented here because
  defendant, in this court, conceded it was proper for the jury to hear
  evidence of plaintiff's full medical bills.)
(Howell,
  supra, 52 Cal.4th at p. 567.)   Here, the moving party seeks to exclude
  evidence of health care expenses which were billed, not paid or due.  Under Howell, the moving party’s request
  is proper.  Therefore, the Court GRANTS
  the unopposed motion limine.

MIL No. 6 To Preclude
  Plaintiff’s Counsel from Engaging in a Campaign to Precondition Jurors During
  Voir Dire About the Facts of the Case and its Dollar Value from Plaintiff’s
  Perspective and to Preclude the Admission of Evidence or Argument Based on
  the “Reptile Theory”
·      
  Written Opposition by Plaintiff 
GOLDEN RULE/REPTILE
  THEORY:
This is not a
  motion in limine as it does not seek exclusion or limitation of any specific evidence.  Therefore, the Court DENIES the motion in
  limine.   But the Court agrees with the moving party’s
  contention that any reference to the “Golden Rule” in the presence of the
  jury is prohibited.  
The jury must impartially determine pain and
  suffering damages based upon evidence specific to the plaintiff, as opposed
  to statistical data concerning the public at large. The only person whose
  pain and suffering is relevant in calculating a general damage award is the
  plaintiff. How others would feel if placed in the plaintiff's position is
  irrelevant. It is improper, for example, for an attorney to ask jurors how
  much they would “charge” to undergo equivalent pain and suffering. This
  so-called “golden rule” argument is impermissible.
(Cassim v.
  Allstate Ins. Co. (2004) 33 Cal.4th 780, 798 [cleaned up].)   
               “The
  law, like boxing, prohibits hitting below the belt. The basic rule forbids an
  attorney to pander to the prejudice, passion or sympathy of the jury.  For example, an attorney representing a
  public entity commits misconduct by appealing to the jurors' self-interest as
  taxpayers. An attorney's appeal in closing argument to the jurors'
  self-interest is improper and thus is misconduct because such arguments tend
  to undermine the jury's impartiality.” 
  (Regalado v. Callaghan (2016) 3 Cal.App.5th 582, 598 [cleaned
  up].)  Further, “ ‘reptile theory’
  arguments, which are improper appeals to a jury's emotions by arguing a
  defendant's conduct threatens the community's safety.”  (Russell v. Department of Corrections &
  Rehabilitation (2021) 72 Cal.App.5th 916, 941, citation omitted.)

MIL No. 7 To Preclude
  Expert Testimony Mentioning, Interrogating Upon, or in Any Other Manner
  Conveying to the Jury Expert Opinions Which Lack Foundation or Are Based on Speculation
·      
  Written Opposition by Plaintiff 
NOT CONCRETE OR SPECIFIC:
This motion
  in limine is plagued by the same defects noted by the Court of Appeal in Kelly
  v. New West Federal Savings (1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 659:
On the other hand, many of the
  motions filed by Amtech were not properly the subject of motions in limine,
  were not adequately presented, or sought rulings which would merely be
  declaratory of existing law or would not provide any meaningful guidance for
  the parties or witnesses. For example, motion No. 19 sought to “... exclude
  any testimony of the plaintiffs which is speculative.” No factual support or
  argument was presented to suggest the nature and type of speculative
  testimony which Amtech expected to be elicited from plaintiffs. Motions No.
  8, 20 and 21 sought to exclude evidence of prior incidents unless an
  appropriate foundation was established to show the relevance of such evidence
  or that the prior incidents were similar in nature to the incident involved
  in the suit. Again, no factual support was presented in connection with the
  motions, meaning the court would have to rule in a vacuum. Motion No. 7,
  previously referred to, sought to limit the opinions of plaintiffs experts to
  those “rendered at deposition and in written reports.” Again, there was no
  supporting evidence to suggest what opinions had been rendered at the depositions,
  leaving the court and the parties to guess what opinions during trial may be
  included within the scope of the ruling. Motion No. 6 sought an order
  precluding plaintiffs from calling any witnesses “not previously identified
  in plaintiffs' discovery responses.” Absent a meaningful and expressed belief
  that this may occur, this was a meaningless motion unless and until
  plaintiffs attempted to call such witnesses.
(Kelly v.
  New West Federal Savings (1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 659, 670–671.)
For the same
  reasons stated in Kelly v. New West Federal Savings, the motion in
  limine here is not specific enough for the Court to make a meaningful order.  The motion fails to identify what specific
  evidence the moving party seeks to exclude. 
  As such, the motion in limine also fails to comply with Local Rule
  3.57.  (Super. Ct. L.A. County, Local
  Rules, rule 3.57(a)(1) [“Motions made for the purpose of precluding the
  mention or display of inadmissible and prejudicial matter in the presence of
  the jury must be accompanied by a declaration that includes the following: (1)
  Specific identification of the matter alleged to be inadmissible and
  prejudicial.”].)  Instead of
  identifying the specific evidence that the motion seeks to exclude, this
  motion in limine amounts to little more than a restatement of the law and
  general legal principles.  Accordingly,
  the Court DENIES the motion in limine. 
  The moving party may at trial assert an objection to the introduction
  of specific evidence if and when this issue arises.

MIL No. 8 To Preclude

·      
  Written Opposition by Plaintiff
DEFER RULING:
Pursuant to
  Local Rule 3.57(d), “[t]he court may defer ruling upon a motion in limine,
  and may order that no mention or display of the matter that is the subject of
  the motion be made in the presence of the jury unless and until the court
  orders otherwise.”  (Super. Ct. L.A.
  County, Local Rules, rule 3.57(b), emphasis in original.)  As authorized under Local Rule 3.57(d), the
  Court will defer ruling on the motion in limine and all parties are ordered
  not to mention or display the matter that is the subject of this motion in
  the presence of the jury without first raising this issue and asking the
  Court for a ruling on the motion in limine.
