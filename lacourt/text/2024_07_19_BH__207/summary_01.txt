And here is a summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on multiple motions in limine filed by Prokupek, et al. The motions seek to exclude various types of evidence and expert testimony, including documents not produced in discovery, evidence of plaintiff's HIV status, evidence of plaintiff's sexual orientation, and expert testimony on certain topics. The judge has denied several of the motions, citing defects in their presentation and failure to comply with local rules. The judge has granted a few of the motions, finding that the evidence is cumulative or not relevant. The judge's ruling is not final and will be reconsidered at the upcoming hearing date.
