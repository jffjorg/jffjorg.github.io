And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the motion to quash two deposition subpoenas issued by the plaintiff to Bank of America, N.A. seeking all banking records of the defendants from 2009 onward. The judge finds that the subpoenas were improperly issued by Gary E. Mastin, who is not the attorney of record for the plaintiff. The plaintiff has been representing himself since the inception of the case, and Mastin was never substituted in as counsel of record.

The judge awards sanctions against the plaintiff and Mastin in the amount of $1,600.00. The judge finds that the motion was unopposed, but under court rules, the failure to file a written opposition or to appear at a hearing does not constitute an admission that the motion was proper or that sanctions should be awarded. The judge notes that the plaintiff did not attempt to justify the subpoenas with contrary authority and did not present any authority for their validity in opposition.
