SUMMARY OF ACTION
Plaintiff Matthew S. Garza was a Major League Baseball
(MLB) pitcher for 12 years. Plaintiff’s career 
with a MLB team ended after the the 2017 season, due to a pitching arm
shoulder injury, which was not successfully repaired following surgery well
enough to return to MLB pitching form. 
 
Prior to the injury causing event, Plaintiff procured a
ten million disability insurance policy from defendant Certain Underwriters at
Lloyd’s of London Subscribing to the Policy (Lloyd’s). Plaintiff maintains the
policy was procured and submitted by defendant International Specialty
Insurance Services, Inc. (ISI), Nigro Karlin Segal & Feldstein, LLP and
NKSFB, LLC (collectively NKSFB). Defendants Paradigm - Gilbert Insurance Group,
LLC, and Gilbert Insurance Services, Inc. (Paradigm and Gilbert) assisted Plaintiff
in providing information in support of the application, though the application
admittedly omitted certain information at the time of submission. Following
submission of the claim to Lloyd’s, the claim was denied based at least in part
on the provision of an incomplete application. 
 
On Jul 1, 2021, Plaintiff filed a complaint for Breach of
Contract, Breach of Implied Duty of Good Faith and Fair Dealing, and Breach of
Duties as an Insurance Broker. The case was initially filed in Fresno County,
and transferred to Los Angeles County on April 5, 2022, following a successful
motion to change venue. Lloyd’s also previously filed a cross-complaint against
Paradigm and Gilbert for Fraud, Negligence, Negligent Misrepresentation, and
Comparative Fault/Contribution. 
 
On May 11, 2022, the case was reassigned from complex
court to Department 68, and independent calendar court. On July 26, 2022, the
court granted the motion to strike the cross-complaint with leave to amend.
Lloyd’s filed its first amended cross-complaint on August 11, 2022. On December
6, 2022, the court denied the motion to strike the first amended
cross-complaint. 
 
On December 21, 2022, the court granted Plaintiff leave
to file a first amended complaint. The amended pleading added in defendants
NKSFB and new causes of action. On the same date, the first amended complaint
for Breach of Contract (first and fourth causes of action), Breach of Implied
Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing, Breach of Duties as an Insurance
Brokers, Intentional Misrepresentation, Negligent Misrepresentation, and Breach
of Fiduciary Duties, was filed. 
 
On March 23, 2023, the court denied the motion to compel
arbitration. On March 29, 2203, the court overruled the demurrer to the first
amended complaint, and a motion for sanctions, both brought by Gilbert
Insurance Services. 
 
On December 14, 2023, the court granted the motion of
International Specialty Insurance Services, Inc. to interplead $133,624.68 in
funds with the court.
 
RULING: Granted.
Counsel for
Defendant Gilbert Insurance Services moves to be relieved as counsel of record,
due to a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship with the client, and a
refusal by the client to substitute in new counsel. The court electronic filing
system shows no opposition on file at the time of the tentative ruling
publication cutoff. Defendant filed a reply/notice of non-opposition as well.
 
“The determination whether to grant or deny a motion to
withdraw as counsel lies within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi
& Levine v. Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1133.) The court
accepts the breakdown of the attorney client relationship with the client
thereby impacting the attorney relationship. The will meet counsel in chambers,
if requested. (Bus. & Prof. Code, § 6068, subd. (e); Manfredi &
Levine v. Superior Court, supra, 66 Cal.App.4th at p. 1133; Aceves
v. Superior Court (1996) 51 Cal.App.4th 584, 590- 593.) The motion
otherwise complies with all procedural requirements. The unchallenged motion is
therefore granted. 
 
Order not effective until service on the client. The
corporate entity, in whatever form, cannot appear in the action without
representation from an admitted attorney, if applicable. (Merco Constr. Engineers, Inc. v. Municipal Court (1978) 21 Cal.3d
724, 731.)
 
Three motions for summary judgment set for June 12, 2024.
Trial currently scheduled for November 4, 2024.
 
Moving
