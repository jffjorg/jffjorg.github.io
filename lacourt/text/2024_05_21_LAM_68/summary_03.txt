```

And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the Defendant's motion for leave to file a second amended cross-complaint. The motion lists 47 articulated additions to the pleading, including new factual claims, exhibits, and allegations of liability. The Judge finds that the proposed changes do not constitute an invalid amendment as a matter of law and that the delay in filing the motion was caused by fragmented discovery due to a confidentiality agreement. The Judge also finds that the proposed changes do not cause significant prejudice to the Cross-Defendant and that the liberal policy for leave to amend outweighs any potential prejudice. The Judge orders the Defendant to file a separate copy of the second amended cross-complaint within 10 days of the order.
