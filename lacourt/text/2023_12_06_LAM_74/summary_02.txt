And here is the English summary:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge regarding a future court hearing. The case, BC714514, is an employment dispute between Tabitha Lawson (plaintiff) and Los Angeles Unified School District (defendant). The parties stipulated to file cross-motions under Code of Civil Procedure section 437c, subdivision (t), addressing issues such as whether defendant's interpretation and application of Education Code section 45192 is consistent with the statute, and whether defendant's placement of plaintiff on the 39-month reemployment list was lawful.

The court considered the moving papers, opposition, and reply, and found that defendant violated Education Code section 45192, subdivision (g) by relying on plaintiff's exhaustion of "benefit time" to place plaintiff on the 39-month reemployment list without permitting plaintiff to first exhaust both paid and unpaid leaves of absence. The court also found that defendant's request for plaintiff to authorize the release of all medical records as part of the reemployment process was unlawful.

The court granted plaintiff's motion for summary adjudication and denied defendant's motion for summary adjudication in its entirety.
