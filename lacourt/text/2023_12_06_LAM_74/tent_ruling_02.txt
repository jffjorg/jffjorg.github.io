 Case Number:  BC714514    Hearing Date:   December 6, 2023    Dept:  74 Tabitha Lawson v. Los
Angeles Unified School District
 
Plaintiff Tabitha
Lawson’s Motion for Summary Adjudication
 
The court considered the moving papers, opposition, and reply.
BACKGROUND

            This action arises from an
employment dispute. 
            On July 18, 2018, Plaintiff Tabitha
Lawson (Plaintiff) filed a complaint against Los Angeles Unified School
District (Defendant).
            On September 14, 2023, the parties
stipulated to file cross-motions under Code of Civil Procedure section 437c,
subdivision (t). In the stipulation, the parties agreed to address the
following issues in their motions: whether Defendant’s interpretation and
application of Education Code section 45192 is consistent with the statute or
the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA); whether Defendant’s placement of
Plaintiff on the 39-month reemployment list can be considered discriminatory or
unlawful under any of her FEHA claims; whether Defendant’s process to obtain
reemployment under the 39-month reemployment list was lawful.
            On October 5, 2023, Plaintiff filed
this motion for summary adjudication.
LEGAL
STANDARD 
            Under Code of Civil Procedure
section 437c, subdivision (t), a party may move for summary adjudication of a
legal issue or a claim for damages other than punitive damages that does not
completely dispose of a cause of action, affirmative defense, or issue of duty
pursuant to this subdivision. Such a motion shall proceed in all procedural
respects as a motion for summary judgment. (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd.
(t)(5).)
DISCUSSION
            The court will sign plaintiff’s
proposed order granting plaintiff’s motion for summary adjudication under
section 437c, subdivision (t) because plaintiff has established that defendant
violated Education Code section 45192, subd. (g) by relying on plaintiff’s
exhaustion of “benefit time” to place plaintiff on the 39-month reemployment
list without permitting plaintiff to first exhaust both her paid and unpaid
leaves of absence. By jumping the gun to place plaintiff on the 39-month
reemployment list prematurely, defendant short-circuited the interactive
process and its duty to provide reasonable accommodations absent an undue
hardship. Furthermore, defendant’s request that plaintiff authorize the release
of all her medical records as part of the reemployment process was unlawful. 
            Plaintiff shall give notice.//////////////Tabitha Lawson v. Los
Angeles Unified School District
 
Defendant Los Angeles
Unified School District’s Motion for Summary Adjudication
 
The court considered the moving papers, opposition, and reply.
BACKGROUND

            This action arises from an
employment dispute. 
            On July 18, 2018, Plaintiff Tabitha
Lawson (Plaintiff) filed a complaint against Los Angeles Unified School
District (Defendant).
            On September 14, 2023, the parties
stipulated to file cross-motions under Code of Civil Procedure section 437c,
subdivision (t). In the stipulation, the parties agreed to address the
following issues in their motions: whether Defendant’s interpretation and
application of Education Code section 45192 is consistent with the statute or
the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA); whether Defendant’s placement of
Plaintiff on the 39-month reemployment list can be considered discriminatory or
unlawful under any of her FEHA claims; whether Defendant’s process to obtain
reemployment under the 39-month reemployment list was lawful.
            On September 26, 2023, Defendant
filed this motion for summary adjudication.
LEGAL
STANDARD 
            Under Code of Civil Procedure
section 437c, subdivision (t), a party may move for summary adjudication of a
legal issue or a claim for damages other than punitive damages that does not
completely dispose of a cause of action, affirmative defense, or issue of duty
pursuant to this subdivision. Such a motion shall proceed in all procedural
respects as a motion for summary judgment. (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd.
(t)(5).)
            As stated in its tentative granting
plaintiff’s cross-motion for summary adjudication, the court finds defendant
violated Education Code section 45192, subdivision (g).
            The court further finds that
defendant’s motion for summary adjudication raises issues not properly before
the court because those issues exceed the parties’ stipulation filed under Code
of Civil Procedure section 437c, subdivision (t) or were previously ruled upon
in November 2021.
Whether Education Code
Section 45192, Subdivision (g) Precludes Plaintiff’s Discrimination Claims
 
            Defendant contends Plaintiff’s
discrimination claims fail as a matter of law given Defendant’s application of
Education Code section 45192, subdivision (g). However, the court has already
denied Defendant’s motion for summary adjudication of these causes of action.
(November 19, 2021, Minute Order, pp. 3-4.) 
Whether Education Code
Section 45192, Subdivision (g) Precludes Plaintiff’s Claim for Failure to
Accommodate.
 
            Defendant contends Plaintiff’s claim
for failure to accommodation fails as a matter of law because of Defendant’s
application of Education Code section 45192, subdivision (g). But the court has
already denied Defendant’s motion for summary adjudication of this cause of
action. (November 19, 2021, Minute Order, p. 4.)
Whether Education Code
Section 45192, Subdivision (g) Precludes Plaintiff’s Claim for Failure to Engage
in the Interactive Process.
 
            Defendant contends Plaintiff’s claim
for failure to engage in the interactive process fails as a matter of law due
to Defendant’s application of Education Code section 45192, subdivision (g).
However, the court already denied Defendant’s motion for summary adjudication
of this cause of action. (November 19, 2021, Minute Order, pp. 4-5.)
Whether Education Code
Section 45192, Subdivision (g) Precludes Plaintiff’s Claim for Retaliation
Under FEHA.
 
            Defendant contends Plaintiff’s claim
for retaliation under FEHA fails because of Defendant’s application of
Education Code section 45192, subdivision (g). But the court has already denied
Defendant’s motion for summary adjudication of this cause of action. (November
19, 2021, Minute Order, pp. 5-6.)
Whether Education Code
Section 45192, Subdivision (g) Precludes Plaintiff’s Claim for Retaliation
Under California Family Rights Act (CFRA)
 
            Defendant contends Plaintiff’s
claim for retaliation under CFRA fails given Defendant’s application of
Education Code section 45192, subdivision (g). However, the court has already
denied Defendant’s motion for summary adjudication of this cause of action.
(November 19, 2021, Minute Order, pp. 7-8.)
Whether Education Code
Section 45192, Subdivision (g) Precludes Plaintiff’s Claim for Failure to
Prevent Discrimination.
 
            Defendant contends Plaintiff’s claim
for failure to prevent discrimination fails due to Defendant’s application of
Education Code section 45192, subdivision (g). But the court has already denied
Defendant’s motion for summary adjudication of this cause of action. (November
19, 2021, Minute Order, p. 7.) 
CONCLUSION
                The
court denies Defendant’s motion for summary adjudication in its entirety.
            Defendant shall give notice.
