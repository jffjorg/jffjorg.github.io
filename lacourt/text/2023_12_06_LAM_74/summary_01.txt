And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by the defendants, Bellwood Animal Hospital and Mohamed Khalid Haridy Ghaefeer, to the first amended complaint filed by Ivan Arnoldo Luna and Annabelle Fonseca. The demurrer challenges the sufficiency of the fraud claim alleged by the plaintiffs. The judge concludes that the plaintiffs have alleged facts sufficient to support their fraud claim, including the forgery of their signatures and the alteration of veterinary records. The judge also finds that the plaintiffs' allegations are particular enough to satisfy the requirements of a fraud claim. As a result, the judge overrules the demurrer and denies the defendants' request to dismiss the fraud claim.
