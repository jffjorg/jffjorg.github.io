And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's demurrer, which argued that the notice to quit was invalid. The judge found that the notice to quit was preceded by a notice to cure, and that the defendant's past acts may have made it impossible to cure the violation, but this is not a basis for the demurrer. The judge also found that there is no evidence that the defendant attempted to cure the violation, and that the issue of whether the breach was incurable is better resolved through summary judgment or trial. The judge has given the defendant 5 days to answer the complaint.
