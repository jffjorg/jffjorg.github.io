And here is the summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has tentatively ruled that the demurrer (a defense to the lawsuit) is sustained (upheld) with leave to amend (the opportunity to revise the complaint). The plaintiff alleges that her supervisor made inappropriate comments, failed to provide reasonable accommodations for her disability, and retaliated against her after she complained. The defendant demurs on the basis that the alleged acts of discrimination occurred before the statute of limitations was amended, making the claims time-barred. The court finds that the complaint does not adequately allege the connection between the earlier alleged acts of discrimination and the alleged misconduct occurring in 2021. The court is not saying that the plaintiff cannot bridge this gap, but rather that the plaintiff needs to allege the linkage between the earlier and later acts. The court grants the defendant's demurrer and gives the plaintiff 30 days to amend the complaint to allege the relationship between the earlier allegations and the alleged misconduct occurring in 2021.
