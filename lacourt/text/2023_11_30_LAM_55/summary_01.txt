And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding the motion to dismiss and quash service filed by Defendant Antoinette Waller. The Judge has found that the Plaintiff failed to meet the burden of proof regarding valid service of the summons and complaint. The Plaintiff's proof of service is defective, and the process server's declaration of due diligence is nonsensical. The Judge has therefore quashed the service of the summons and complaint and dismissed the action as to Defendant Waller only. The Judge has also found that the Plaintiff failed to exercise reasonable diligence in serving Defendant within the three-year period after the case was filed.
