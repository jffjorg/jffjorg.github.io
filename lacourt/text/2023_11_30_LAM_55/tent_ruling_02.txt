 Case Number:  22STCV19039    Hearing Date:   November 30, 2023    Dept:  55 NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS:      Motion
of Defendant
ANDREAS MAUER, MD. for Terminating Sanctions; 
Motion of Plaintiff PAUL BUTAKOV to Terminate Sanctions and Compel
Plaintiff’s Responses to Special Interrogatories, and Request from Productions
Of Documents from All Defendants.
Defendant’s motion for terminating sanctions is
granted.Plaintiff’s motion requesting vacating discovery
rulings is denied.This entire action is ordered dismissed with prejudice as to
Defendant Mauer.The Court reviewed the docket and determined that due to
inadvertence, it did not calendar the motion for terminating sanctions
filed by Defendant Joseph Carey, M.D. for 11/30/2023 despite the Court’s order
continuing the motion to 11/30/23. As a result, the Court is not prepared to
conduct the hearing on that motion on 11/30/2023. The Court will discuss with
the parties on 11/30/2023 a hearing date in December that works
for all parties.
 
 
On 6/10/22, Plaintiff PAUL BUTAKOV (“Plaintiff”), a
self-represented litigant, filed a Complaint for Medical Negligence, alleging
that, in June 2020, Plaintiff underwent vessel coronary artery bypass at
HUNTINGTON HOSPITAL, and thereafter experienced a clicking noise in his chest,
which thereafter was discovered to be an improperly closed chest plate by
doctors at KECK MEDICAL CENTER OF USC.
Defendant ANDREAS MAUER, MD. (“Defendant”) filed a
motion for Terminating Sanctions.    Plaintiff filed a cross-motion to “Terminate
Sanctions…” that actually seeks to vacate prior discovery rulings and to have
more time to serve responses.
Defendant requests an order granting terminating
sanctions against Plaintiff, and defendants oppose Plaintiff’s requests for
relief, on grounds including the following:   1) The court ordered that plaintiff provide
verified responses, without objections and, and pay a total of $1,580.00 in
sanctions within thirty (30) days; 
2)   Defendant filed and served the Notices of
Ruling on February 24, 223. (mot., exs. F and G);  3) no responses have been received from
plaintiff, nor has payment of sanctions been made;  4)  Plaintiff
failed to show his failure to respond to any discovery propounded by the USC
Defendants was due to mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect;  5)  Plaintiff
is not entitled to relief or more lenient treatment by the Court based on being
self-represented;  6)  Plaintiff provided a doctor’s note dated
March 2, 2023 supporting his claim that he was unable to “handle his financial
or personal affairs at this time.” However, this note is dated months after the
deadline to respond to discovery had passed, and this note was never provided
to defense counsel prior to Plaintiff’s Motion for Relief;  7)  the
only documentation provided with respect to DR. MAUER’S motions indicates that
plaintiff was hospitalized from February 24, 2023, to March 2, 2023. The
document is signed by a hospital social worker, not a physician;  and 8) 
there is no evidence as to why Plaintiff has not been able to produce
the requested discovery responses in the almost six months since the Court
issued the order.
Plaintiff requests an order vacating defendants’
discovery motions, on bases including the following:  1)  Plaintiff
finally recovered from health issues sufficiently to be able to respond to the
demand for production and interrogatories requested by defendants, but needs
additional time, as he is working pro per and he is being bombarded by the
defendants’ discovery;  2) due to health
issues, and being in-and-out of the hospital, Plaintiff has been unable to
respond to the discovery motions;  3) defendants
have been fully aware of Plaintiff’s health issues, yet continued to file
motions;  4) Plaintiff has not been able
to attend court hearings due to doctor’s appointments scheduled on the same
date as court hearings, which could not be rescheduled due to life-threatening
health concerns;  and 5)  medical records are attached to Plaintiff’s
motion in support.
Serious illnesses
of parties generally are good cause for granting continuances, or extensions of
cut-off dates.  Hernandez v. Sup. Ct.
(2004) 115 Cal. App. 4th 1242, 1247-48 (finding abuse of discretion as to trial
court denial of request to reopen discovery, where counsel was seriously ill).
“[A] penalty as severe as dismissal or default is not
authorized where noncompliance with discovery is caused by an inability to
comply rather than willfulness or bad faith.” 
Brown v. Sup. Ct.  (1986)
180 Cal. App. 3d 701, 707.  An order
imposing ultimate sanctions may be an abuse of discretion, as being excessive
under the particular circumstances.  E.g.,  Motown Record Corp. v. Sup. Ct. (1984)
155 Cal. App. 3d 482, 490
Discretionary relief under CCP Section 473 applies to
any proceeding, such as failures to meet procedural deadlines.  Huh v. Wang (2007) 158 Cal.App.4th
1406, 1419.  Parties are not entitled to
relief under Code of Civil Procedure Section 473, merely based upon being a
self-represented litigant.  Burnete v.
La Casa Dana Apartments (2007) 148 Cal. App. 4th 1262, 1267-71.
Here, the motions were ordered continued from 8/23/23
and gave Plaintiff until 10/30/23 to serve all due discovery responses upon
defendants.  
It appearing that Plaintiff had recovered and had the
ability to serve the discovery responses by 10/30/23, but has not yet served
them, the Court now finds Plaintiff’s willful failures to comply with the discovery
orders and dismisses this action as to Defendant Mauer with prejudice.
