Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The motion to compel further responses and documents in response to the deposition notice of Defendant Thomas Amalfitano Sr. is denied. The opposing request for monetary sanctions is granted. The Court finds that the Plaintiff and counsel lacked substantial justification for the customized procedure and for seeking to compel grossly overbroad document productions.

The Court concludes that the motion does not follow any authorized procedure of the Discovery Act or California Rules of Court. The deposition notice failed to specify with reasonable particularity of any materials or category to be produced by the deponent, and the motion fails to set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the production of any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing.

The Court also finds that the deposition notice requests are vague, grossly overbroad, and broadly sweeping categories, encompassing countless of irrelevant documents, possibly existing for over 3 decades, in an unprecedented fishing expedition that is on its face overly burdensome.

As a result, the Court imposes monetary sanctions of $4,213.35 on the Plaintiff and counsel, the Court finding that the absence of substantial justification.
