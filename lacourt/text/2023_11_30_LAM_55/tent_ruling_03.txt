 Case Number:  23STCP02493    Hearing Date:   November 30, 2023    Dept:  55 NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS:  Petitioners’ Motion to Confirm Arbitration
Award.
 
The unopposed motion is granted.
The Court will sign and file a proposed judgment in
conformance with the arbitration award.
 
  
 
On 7/18/23, petitioners JTH Hallmark LLC and KLS
Hallmark LLC (“petitioners”) filed a petition to confirm an arbitration award.
Petitioners move to confirm an Arbitration Award in
favor of Petitioners and against Respondents Hallmark 75 Ontario, LLC; R&R Enterprises
II, LLC; and Hall 75 Apt Venture, LLC. in the calculated total amount of
$354,565.94.  No opposition has been
filed to the motion.
According to the moving documents, on 6/30/23,
Arbitrator Terry Friedman, Ret., issued an Arbitrator's Final Award  (Jason Hoffman Decl., filed 9/20/23, ex. 1).  Petitioners seek the amount of that award,
plus fees and costs related to the filing in the amount of $4,475.00, pursuant
to a Purchase and Sale Agreement containing a clause permitting the recovery of
attorneys fees  (Amin Decl., exh. 1).“[W]here parties have agreed their dispute will be
resolved by binding arbitration, judicial intervention is limited to reviewing
the award to see if statutory grounds for vacating or correcting the award
exist.”  Corona v. Amherst (2003)
107 Cal. App. 4th 701, 706.  Unless a
petition or response seeking to correct or vacate an arbitration award was
filed properly based upon valid grounds, or the proceeding is dismissed, courts
are required to enter judgment in conformity with the award.  Valsan Partners Ltd. Partnership v. Calcor
Space Facility (1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 809, 818.  “‘[T]he court shall confirm the award as made
…, unless in accordance with this chapter it corrects the award and confirms it
as corrected, vacates the award or dismisses the proceeding.’”  Law Offices of David S. Karton v. Segreto
(2009) 176 Cal.App.4th 1, 8Additionally,  a
court may award attorneys' fees, and costs, incurred in relation to statutorily
authorized judicial proceedings regarding arbitration, and the arbitrator makes
the determination in connection with the arbitration proceedings. Corona v.
Amherst (2003) 107 Cal.App.4th
701, 707;  DiMarco v.  Chaney (1995) 31 Cal.App.4th 1809,
1816-17;  Carole Ring & Assocs. v.
Nicastro (2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 253, 260-62;  Ajida Technologies, Inc. v. Roos
Instruments, Inc. (2001) 87 Cal. App 4th 534, 552 n. 11. Here, the moving documents sufficiently evidence the
arbitration award and underlying contract, and no response has been filed.  Therefore, the Court grants the motion and
confirms the award as made.
