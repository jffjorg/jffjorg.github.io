  Case Number:  20STCV15663    Hearing Date:   November 30, 2023    Dept:  55  
NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS:  Defendant Doe 2 ANTOINETTE WALLER’s Motion to
Dismiss for Failure to Serve Within Three Years and Motion to Quash Service.
 
The Court quashes service of summons and dismisses
this entire action, as to Moving Defendant Doe 2 ANTOINETTE WALLER, only.
 
 
On 4/23/20, Plaintiff ROLAN FELD filed a Complaint
alleging that Defendants, as Plaintiff’s lawyer in an underlying arbitration
about another attorney seeking attorney fees, negligently handled the matters,
including by failing to question witnesses about exorbitant fees, and failing
to raise defenses to show a void fee agreement. In January 2021, Plaintiff
filed a Doe Amendment adding Defendant Antoinette Susan Waller.
On 10/30/23, the Clerk issued a notice of rejection of
default documents regarding DOE Defendant Antoinette Susan Waller, partly based
on noted defects of the most recent proof of service of summons.
Defendant Antoinette Waller (“Defendant”) now moves to
dismiss this action pursuant to C.C.P. sections 583.210,
583.240 and 583.250, and to quash service of summons pursuant to C.C.P.
sections 415.20 and 418.10. Plaintiff opposes the motion. 
Quashing and Dismissal
C.C.P. section 583.210(a) provides that a summons and
complaint shall be served upon a defendant within three years after the action
is commenced. CCP Section 583.250 provides that if a defendant is not served
within three years, the Court shall dismiss the case on its own motion or
motion of any person interested in the action. 
“When a trial court has ruled on a motion to dismiss
for failure to serve, a reviewing court may not substitute its opinion for that
of the trial court and thereby divest it of its discretionary power unless a
clear case of abuse is shown and unless there has been a miscarriage of
justice.…  Additionally, the plaintiff
must show that he exercised reasonable diligence throughout the entire
three-year (for mandatory dismissals) or two-year (for discretionary
dismissals) period.”  A. Groppe &
Sons Glass Co. v. Fireman's Fund Ins. Co. (1991) 232 Cal. App. 3d 220, 224-25.
C.C.P. section 415.20(b) provides that a defendant may
be served by substitute service if the “summons cannot with reasonable
diligence be personally served.” C.C.P. section 418.10 provides that a party
may move to quash service of summons for alleged improper service. Complainants
have the initial burden to evidence valid statutory service of a summons and
complaint. Dill v. Berquist Const. Co., Inc. (1994) 24 Cal.App.4th
1426, 1439-40; Floveyor Internat. v. Sup. Ct. (1997) 59 Cal. App. 4th
789, 794.  Court findings as to
conflicting proof regarding whether a summons and complaint were properly
served are upheld if based upon substantial evidence.   Stafford v. Mach (1998) 64
Cal.App.4th 1174, 1182.  “‘The court may
dismiss without prejudice the complaint in whole, or as to that defendant, when
dismissal is made pursuant to Section 418.10.’ ”  PNEC Corp. v. Meyer (2010) 190 Cal.
App. 4th 66, 71 (quoting CCP §581(h)), disapproved
on other grounds by  DisputeSuite.com,
LLC v. Scoreinc.com (2017) 2 Cal. 5th 968, 979.
This action was filed in April 2020. Plaintiff filed a
proof of service for Defendant on October 19, 2023. The process server
declaration of due diligence attached to the proof of service states
substituted service was completed on 9/18/23, with a last page listing attempts
to serve Defendant personally on 9/18/23, 9/29/23, and 10/4/23. This declaration
of due diligence is nonsensical because the purported attempts at personal service
post-date the purported date of substitute service. Plaintiff contends yet
another date of service in the opposing memorandum and declaration—10/4/23. (See
EDUARDO MARTORELL decl., filed 11/15/23, ¶ 9 
(“Again, Apex was unable to serve Waller. (See Docket at Oct. 18, 2023
Proof of Service and Declaration of Diligence.) But finally, Apex served Waller
via substituted service on October 4, 2023. (Ibid.)”)).  The Court therefore concurs with the Clerk’s
notice of rejection of default entry due to defects in the proof of service of
summons,
 
The process server declaration stating illogical
dates, and the opposing declaration stating another date without personal
knowledge, are not substantial evidence of valid service of summons. Therefore,
there is no valid proof of service of summons in evidence or filed to this
date, and Plaintiff failed to meet his burden of proof regarding valid service.
The Court therefore quashes service of the summons and complaint. 
Plaintiff has also not shown diligence in serving
Defendant within the three-year period after this case was filed in April 2020.
At most, the evidence shows that Plaintiff made attempts to serve Defendant in or
around March 2022, and then made no further attempts until the most recent
failed attempt. Accordingly, the Court dismisses this action as to moving
Defendant only pursuant to C.C.P. section 250. Because the Court dismisses the
case against Defendant on this basis, it does not reach Defendant’s argument that
she was improperly named as a Doe defendant.  
            Objections
The Court overrules Defendant’s evidentiary objections
filed 11/20/23, as to all numbers.
 
Conclusion
 
For the reasons stated herein, the Court quashes
service of summons and dismisses this entire action as to Moving Defendant
only.
