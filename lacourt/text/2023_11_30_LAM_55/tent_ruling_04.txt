 Case Number:  BC667234    Hearing Date:   November 30, 2023    Dept:  55  
NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS:  Motion to Compel Further Responses and
Documents in Response to Deposition Notice of Defendant Thomas Amalfitano [Sr.]
and Request for Monetary Sanctions.
 
The motion is denied.
The opposing request for sanctions is granted.
On or before 12/15/23, Plaintiff MARIO LINO MIRAMONTES
and counsel BENJAMIN P. WASSERMAN shall pay discovery sanctions in the sum of $4,213.35
to Defendant THOMAS AMALFITANO SR., the Court finding the absence of
substantial justification.    E.g.,
CCP   § 2023.030.
 
 
On 7/3/17, Plaintiff MARIO LINO MIRAMONTES
("Plaintiff') filed a Complaint.  On
8/8/18, Plaintiff MARIO LINO MIRAMONTES filed a First Amended Complaint,
alleging that defendants breached a verbal agreement, granting Plaintiff
exclusive rights to proprietary custom spice blends, formulations and recipes,
in growing the business called “San Pedro Fish Market,” including by
interfering with Plaintiff’s business arrangements, and reneging on
compensation agreements.  The causes of
action are:  1)  Breach Of Oral Contract;  2)  Tortious
Interference With Written Contract Or Prospective Business Advantage;  3)   Negligent
Interference With Prospective Business Advantage;  4)  Violation
Of Business & Professions Code § 17500; 
5)  Violation Of Business &
Professions Code § 17200.6;  6)  Fraud; 
and 7)  Restitution.
Plaintiff requests the Court to compel further
documents responses, pursuant to deposition-notice requests 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
7, 8, 9, 11, 15, 16, and 17, and to impose $5,225.00 in sanctions, on grounds
including the following:  1) Defendant
Amalfitano Sr. (“Defendant”) objected to every document request at issue, with
the same boilerplate objections.  On 1/19/23,
Plaintiff sent a detailed meet and confer letter.  Defendants sent a letter indicating that they
would be producing documents, but later reneged by claiming the letter was a
mistake.
Defendant opposes the motion, and requests monetary
sanctions, for reasons including: 
1)  Plaintiff’s attorney cancelled
the deposition after receiving Defendant’s objections to the document
production requests, such that no motion lies to compel  (CCP  
§ 2025.450, 2025.480);  2)  every category of documents is patently
overbroad, requests irrelevant matter, requests documents far beyond any
potential statute of limitations, among other valid objections;  3) if the motion, filed 2/21/23, is
considered under the code sections cited in the motion, pertaining to requests
for production of documents, then the motion to compel is not timely filed
within 45 days (CCP § 2031.310), after the objections served 12/21/22;  and 4) meeting and conferring efforts were
not done in good faith.
 
            Procedure
As specified above, Defendant objected as to procedure.
A separate statement is to address a motion to “compel
or to quash the production of documents or tangible things at a deposition”  CRC Rule 3.1345(a)(5).  [Emphasis added.]  Also, it is to include the “text of the
request, interrogatory, question, or inspection demand….”  Ibid. at 3.1345(c)(1).
A deposition notice shall contain:  “[t]he specification with reasonable
particularity of any materials or category of materials, including any
electronically stored information, to be produced by the deponent.”  CCP § 2025.220 (a)(4).  
A motion lies to compel deposition attendance or
document production, after service of a deposition notice, where a deponent
fails to appear at, or proceed with, a deposition, without having served a
valid objection under Section 2025.410. 
CCP §2025.450(a).  
A motion to compel deposition attendance and
testimony, and the production for inspection of any document, electronically
stored information, or tangible thing, shall “shall set forth specific facts
showing good cause justifying the production for inspection of any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice.”  CCP   § 2025.450(a)-(b).  Specifically, “[t]he motion shall set forth
specific facts showing good cause justifying the production for inspection of
any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in
the deposition notice.”  CCP
§2025.450(b)(1).
“If a deponent fails to answer any question or to
produce any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing
under the deponent’s control that is specified in the deposition notice or a
deposition subpoena, the party seeking discovery may move the court for an
order compelling that answer or production.” 
CCP   § 2025.480(a);  Unzipped Apparel, LLC v. Bader (2007)
156 Cal. App. 4th 123, 129 (quoting CCP §2025.480(a)).
“‘If the court determines that the answer or
production sought is subject to discovery, it shall order that the answer be
given or the production be made on the resumption of the
deposition.’"   Maldonado v. Sup.
Ct. (2002) 94 Cal. App. 4th 1390, 1398.
As to the instant motion, the Court concludes that it
does not follow any authorized procedure of the Discovery Act or California
Rules of Court.  They do not include
motions to compel document production pursuant to a deposition notice
specifying materials or categories.  E.g.,  CRC Rule 3.1345.  Further, they do not contemplate deposition
notices as to which no deposition occurred. 
Additionally, the Court finds that the deposition notice failed to
specify with reasonable particularity of any materials or category to be
produced by the deponent.  Similarly, the
Court finds that the motion fails to set forth specific facts showing good
cause justifying the production of any document, electronically stored
information, or tangible thing that the deposition notice describes.  
Hence, the motion is denied, as being based upon no
authorized procedure.
 
            Request
and Response Requirements
As specified above, Defendant has raised issues as to
the merits of the requests and responses.
As to overbreadth objections involving no claim of
privilege, courts determine whether the discovery is “ ‘reasonably calculated
to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence’ ”, generally resolving doubt
in favor of permitting discovery.  Williams
v. Sup. Ct. (2017) 3 Cal.5th 531, 542. 
“When discovery requests are grossly overbroad on their face, and
hence do not appear reasonably related to a legitimate discovery need, a
reasonable inference can be drawn of an intent to harass and improperly
burden.”  Obregon v. Sup. Ct.
(1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 424, 431. 
[Emphasis added.] 
Here, assuming, arguendo, that the instant motion
is based upon a procedure of authorized document requests, the Court denies the
motion, by finding that the deposition notice requests are vague, grossly
overbroad and broadly sweeping categories, encompassing countless of irrelevant
documents, possibly existing for over 3 decades, in an unprecedented fishing
expedition that is on its face overly burdensome, as exemplified by the following
items:
·        
“REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION NO. 1:  ANY and ALL DOCUMENTS, which in any way,
EVIDENCE, REFER, PERTAIN OR RELATED TO the SPJCE PRODUCTS utilized in the
preparation of food items and/or drinks at San Pedro Fish Market
("SPFM") and/or sold at San Pedro Fish Market ("SPFM") or
any of its affiliates from 1981 to 2014;”
·        
“REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION NO. 2:  ANY and ALL DOCUMENTS, which in any way,
EVIDENCE, REFER, PERTAIN OR RELATED TO any of Plaintiff’s claimed PRODUCTS from
1981 to the 2014;”
·        
“REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION NO. 3:  ALL DOCUMENTS which in any way EVIDENCE,
REFER, PERTAIN OR RELATE to business dealings between the named Defendants and
Pacific Spice Company from 1981 to 2014, including but not limited to,
contracts, invoices and statements….”
 
            Sanctions
Opposing party has requested monetary sanctions
against Plaintiff and counsel.
Generally, monetary sanctions are mandatory as to
parties losing discovery motions, unless courts find substantial justification
or other injustice.  E.g.,  Foothill Properties v. Lyon/Copley
Corona Assocs., L.P. (1996) 46 Cal.App.4th 1542, 1557-58.  “ ‘[S]ubstantial justification” has been
understood to mean that a justification is clearly reasonable because it is
well-grounded in both law and fact.”  Doe
v. U.S. Swimming, Inc. (2011) 200 Cal.App.4th 1424, 1434.  “If the party seeking a monetary sanction meets
its burden of proof, the burden shifts to the opposing party attempting to
avoid a monetary sanction to show that it acted with ‘substantial
justification.’ ”  Doe v. U.S.
Swimming, Inc. (2011) 200 Cal.App.4th 1424, 1435.
Here, the Court finds that Plaintiff and counsel
lacked substantial or other justifications for the customized procedure
expressly conflating Discovery Act sections addressing depositions and document
demands, and for seeking to compel grossly overbroad document productions.  Therefore, the Court imposes monetary
sanctions.
