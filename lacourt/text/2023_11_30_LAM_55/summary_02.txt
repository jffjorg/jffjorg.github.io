And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

On November 30, 2023, the court issued a tentative ruling regarding the motions filed by the parties in the case of Paul Butakov v. Andreas Mauer, MD. The court granted the defendant's motion for terminating sanctions and denied the plaintiff's motion to vacate discovery rulings. The court also dismissed the action with prejudice as to the defendant Mauer.

The court's decision was based on the fact that the plaintiff had failed to respond to discovery requests and had not paid the required sanctions. The defendant had filed a motion for terminating sanctions, alleging that the plaintiff had failed to comply with court orders and had not provided verified responses to discovery requests. The plaintiff had filed a cross-motion to vacate discovery rulings and to have more time to serve responses.

The court found that the plaintiff's failure to respond to discovery requests was not due to mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect, but rather was the result of willful failure to comply with court orders. The court also noted that the plaintiff had not provided any evidence to support his claim that he was unable to respond to discovery requests due to health issues.

The court's decision was based on the following legal principles: (1) a penalty as severe as dismissal or default is not authorized where noncompliance with discovery is caused by an inability to comply rather than willfulness or bad faith; (2) serious illnesses of parties generally are good cause for granting continuances, or extensions of cut-off dates; and (3) an order imposing ultimate sanctions may be an abuse of discretion, as being excessive under the particular circumstances.

The court's ruling is subject to change based on any further submissions or arguments presented by the parties.
