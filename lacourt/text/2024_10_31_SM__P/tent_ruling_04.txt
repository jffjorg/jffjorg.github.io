Bosse v. Prado, Case no. 24SMCV04285
Hearing date October 31, 2024
Defendant’s
Demurrer
Plaintiff
landlord sues for failure to pay rent. Defendant, in pro per, demurs,
arguing the complaint fails to state a cause of action for unlawful detainer
and is procedurally defective.
“The
function of a demurrer is to test the sufficiency of the complaint as a matter
of law.” Holiday Matinee, Inc. v. Rambus, Inc. (2004) 118 Cal.App.4th
1413, 1420. A complaint “is sufficient if it alleges ultimate rather than
evidentiary facts,” Doe v. City of Los Angeles (2007) 42 Cal.4th 531,
550, but plaintiff must allege essential facts “with reasonable precision and
with particularity sufficient to acquaint [the] defendant with the nature,
source and extent” of the plaintiff’s claim. Doheny Park Terrace Homeowners
Ass’n., Inc. v. Truck Ins. Exchange (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 1076, 1099.
Plaintiff
properly alleged a landlord-tenant relationship and failure to pay rent. Defendant
asserts plaintiff failed to provide 3-day notice as required by Cal. Code Civ.
Proc. §1161(2) and fails to state a claim. Defendant asserts plaintiff did not
attach a complete acknowledgement of receipt of service. Defendant’s assertions
regarding Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §1161(2)’s 3-day notice requirement are
questions of fact inappropriate for demurrer. Plaintiff alleged proper service
of a 3-day notice. Compl. para. 9. Plaintiff included a declaration of ervice.
Compl. ex. 3. Whether notice was procedurally defective is a question of fact,
which the court cannot determine on demurrer. OVERRULED. Defendant to answer
within 5 days.
