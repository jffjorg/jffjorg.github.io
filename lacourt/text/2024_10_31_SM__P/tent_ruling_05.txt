Ferri v. Devgan Enterprises, Case
no. SC127317
Hearing date October 31, 2024
Cross-Defendant
Arefadib’s Motion for Attorney’s Fees
Plaintiff
Ferri sued defendant Devgan Enterprises, LLC for breach of contract and fraud
in connection with a commercial lease. Devgan Enterprises and Baldev Devgan
(collectively “Devgan”) cross-complained against prior lessor Arefadib. The
court ruled on 8/13/2024 Arefadib was the prevailing party in the cross-action and
granted his motion for attorney’s fees but allowed supplemental briefs regarding
the $166,578.90 sought. See Decl. Nejadapur ex. 001. Devgan opposes, asserting the
requested fees are fraudulent (see Decl. Gordon); Ferri’s counsel Rich submits
a declaration in support of Arefadib’s requested fees.
Devgan
requests the court reconsider whether Arefadib should be considered the
prevailing party. Devgan asserts that while Arefadib succeeded in defending
against Devgan’s claims for breach of contract and declaratory relief, Arefadib
did not prove his counter-claims against Devgan. Arefadib was brought into this
action by Devgan’s cross-complaint and successfully defended against Devgan’s
claims. For purposes of Devgan’s cross-complaint against Arefadib, Arefadib was
the prevailing party. Additionally, Devgan did not file a motion for
reconsideration, nor is there any basis to grant such, as there are no new
facts or law. CCP 1008. 
To
award $166,578, the court requires substantial justification and support,
considering this was a relatively limited case against Arefadib. Devgan
suggests a reduction to $21,697.50. Arefadib suggests a 10% reduction to $147,698.01.

Devgan
notes $94,467.08 are redacted billing entries. Decl. Nejadapur ex. 001. Arefadib
in reply offers updated billing records with reduced redactions. Decl.
Silverstein ex. B. Devgan did not respond to the subsequently unredacted
entries; however, he did file “Notice of Fraud on this Court in Opposition to
the Nejadpour Fee/Cost Application” on 10/24/24, after the unredacted time
sheets were filed, so the court assumes Devgan did not intend to respond
directly to the newly unredacted time sheets.
Devgan
notes entries for work done by attorney Montezari on November 30, 2021,
December 1, 2, 22, 29, 2021 and January 7, 10, 11, 13, 17, 2022, totaling 24.7
hours, are inconsistent and may in fact represent work done by paralegal Muehler.
Id. As Arefadib concedes, Montezari is unavailable to clarify the
billing, so he urges the court to adjust the billing from Montezari’s $350/hour
rate to the paralegal requested rate of $250/hour. The court finds $250/hour is
unreasonable for paralegal work, as discussed below, and adjusts those noted
entries to $150/hour.
Devgan
argues Arefadib’s then-counsel Nejadapur claims 414 total hours for all work on
the case, but Nejadpour was not in court March 2, 9, 10, 15 and 21, 2022, and
appeared via zoom February 24, 28, 2022 and March 8, 2022. Id. Arefadib
argues litigation was ongoing since 2017 and highly contentious, and the
billing summary includes entries where 0.0 hours were listed and clarifies that
no hours were billed for said entries. Decl. Silverstein para. 5. Arefadib
requests 11.1 hours for Nejadapur’s Zoom appearances. 
Devgan
argues 34 hours sought by Arefadib in preparation of this motion is
unreasonable. Though the motion included supplemental briefs, the court agrees
and reduces the total number of hours from 34 to 10, for work performed by Nejadpour.

Devgan
argues Nejadapur’s hourly rate of $600 is excessive. Arefadib’s reliance on the
Laffey Matrix is unavailing. As noted by Devgan, non-insurance attorneys in
this matter billed $350-$400/hourly. Decl. Gordon para. 1. The court reduces Nejadapur’s
rate to a more reasonable rate of $400/hour. 
Devgan
argues that the $350/hour billed by paralegals Feiner, Muehler and Gonzalez is
unreasonable. The court agrees. No evidence is offered justifying such a high
rate for paralegal work. The court reduces the rate for all paralegal work
billed to $150/hour. 
Devgan
submits additional opposition asserting the requested fees are fraudulent. Per
the declaration of Gordon, he only interacted with one Nejadpour staff member
“Ali,” and argues other staff listed, including Montezari, Feiner, Gonzalez and
Muehler, are “ghost” paralegals concocted to run up fees. Simply because Gordon
did not speak with staff does not mean they do not exist. Ferri’s counsel Rich
offers a declaration that he interacted with these paralegals. Decl. Rich para.
8. 
The
court reduces the requested fees as above. GRANTED as modified.
