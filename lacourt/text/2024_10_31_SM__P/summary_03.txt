And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is granting the plaintiff's ex parte application for appointment of a receiver and issuing an order to show cause (OSC) re: confirmation of appointment of receiver. The plaintiff, Churchill Funding I LLC, is seeking judicial foreclosure, breach of guaranty, and injunctive/declaratory relief against the defendants, 728 Indiana, LLC, 732 Indiana, LLC, Kenig, Los Angeles 104 Projects 2016 LP, and Marom Kislev Projects 2016 LP, due to defaults on two loans totaling over $10 million.

The judge notes that the defendants have failed to pay property taxes, insure the properties, and are insolvent, which puts the plaintiff's interest in the properties in danger of being lost. The judge also finds that the defendants have consented to the appointment of a receiver in the event of default.

The judge disagrees with the defendants' argument that the plaintiff cannot elect to pursue judicial foreclosure and non-judicial foreclosure simultaneously, citing California law that allows a receiver to be appointed in an action for judicial foreclosure. The judge grants the plaintiff's request for a preliminary injunction requiring all defendants to cooperate with the appointed receiver.

The judge sustains the plaintiff's evidentiary objections to the declarations submitted by the defendants and finds that the defendants have failed to rebut the plaintiff's arguments in support of the appointment of a receiver. The judge concludes that the appointment of a receiver is necessary to protect the plaintiff's interests in the properties and grants the plaintiff's ex parte application for appointment of receiver and OSC re: confirmation of appointment of receiver.
