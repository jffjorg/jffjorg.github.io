And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendant's motion to set aside a default judgment against him is granted. The defendant was served with the complaint on November 10, 2024, but did not file an answer and a default judgment was entered on February 28, 2024. The defendant has since moved to set aside the default, claiming that he did not understand the nature of the documents and did not receive actual notice of the default. The judge has found that, although the defendant was properly served, he did demonstrate a willingness to move forward with the litigation process by retaining new counsel and providing a proposed answer. The judge has also imposed a penalty of $800 on the defendant, as requested by the plaintiff, under California Code of Civil Procedure section 473(c)(1)(A). The motion is granted, and the penalty is payable within 30 days.
