And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the motion for attorney's fees filed by Arefadib and the opposition filed by Devgan. The court finds that Arefadib was the prevailing party in the cross-action and is entitled to attorney's fees. However, the court also finds that the requested fees of $166,578.90 are excessive and reduces them to $147,698.01. The court also reduces the hourly rate of Arefadib's counsel, Nejadapur, from $600 to $400 per hour and the hourly rate of the paralegals from $350 to $150 per hour. The court notes that the billing entries were redacted and that some of the entries may be fraudulent. The court also finds that Arefadib's counsel, Rich, has presented a declaration that he interacted with the paralegals listed in the billing entries, which contradicts Devgan's assertion that they are "ghost" paralegals. The court grants the motion for attorney's fees as modified.
