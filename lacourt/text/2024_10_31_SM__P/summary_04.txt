This is a tentative ruling by a judge regarding a hearing on October 31, 2024, in case number 24SMCV04285, Bosse v. Prado. The plaintiff, Bosse, is suing the defendant, Prado, for failure to pay rent and is seeking to evict them. The defendant has filed a demurrer, arguing that the complaint fails to state a cause of action for unlawful detainer and is procedurally defective. The judge has ruled that the complaint is sufficient and that the defendant's demurrer has been overruled. The defendant is ordered to answer the complaint within 5 days. The judge has also ruled that questions of fact, such as the 3-day notice requirement and the completeness of the acknowledgement of service, are inappropriate for demurrer and must be decided at a later stage in the proceedings.
