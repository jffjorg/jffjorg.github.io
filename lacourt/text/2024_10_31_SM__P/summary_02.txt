And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendants' motion to stay the California state court action should be granted. The defendants, Pacific Shangrila LLC and ILU LLC, argue that the California state court action is duplicative of a Federal action filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona, which involves similar claims and parties. The judge notes that it is black letter law that a California court has the discretion to stay a state court action when a Federal action has been filed covering the same subject matter.

The judge finds that the California state court action and the Federal action in Arizona involve overlapping claims and parties, and that the Arizona action names additional defendants and alleges additional claims. The judge also notes that the plaintiff, Huynh, previously recorded a lis pendens, which was expunged, and that Huynh may petition for leave to record a subsequent lis pendens.

The judge rejects the plaintiff's argument that California law offers unique remedies not available under Arizona law, specifically the right to record a lis pendens. The judge finds that the plaintiff can recover his alleged interest in the defendant LLCs via the Arizona action, which all defendants are party to, or subsequently upon resumption of the instant action.

The judge also rejects the plaintiff's argument that the defendants seek a stay to facilitate fraudulent conduct. The judge finds that the defendants' motion is based on the comity principle, which requires a stay to prevent judicial inefficiency and overlapping rulings.

The judge concludes that there is no compelling reason to advance the California state court action, given the risk of judicial inefficiency and overlapping rulings. Therefore, the judge grants the defendants' motion to stay the California state court action.
