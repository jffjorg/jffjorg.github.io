Summary:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge in a case involving a plaintiff who alleges child sexual abuse and negligence by a defendant. The defendant moves for judgment on the pleading, arguing that the revival of claims under Civil Procedure ยง 340.1 (AB 218) constitutes a gift of public funds. The plaintiff argues that the statute serves a public purpose and is constitutional. The court declines to take judicial notice of other Superior Court orders addressing the same issue and finds that the revival of claims does not constitute a gift of public funds. The court denies the defendant's motion for judgment on the pleading.
