[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING
PLAINTIFF’S
 MOTION FOR ATTORNEY’S FEES 
 
I.       
BACKGROUND
       The complaint alleges claims for breach of contract and common
counts arising from Defendants’ alleged failure to pay for transportation and
related services provided by Plaintiff in the amount of $84,570.25. On November
14, 2023, after a court trial at which Defendant, Warren Jeffrey, did not
appear, the Court entered judgment for $97,409.37, comprised of the principal
amount alleged in the complaint, prejudgment interest, and costs. Defendant
Jeffrey was the remaining Defendant after the Court struck Defendant Zircon’s
answer on November 29, 2022. 
       Plaintiff requests an award of $25,768.00 in attorney’s fees
as provided in the credit application signed by Defendants. Defendant did not
file an opposition. 
 
II.      DISCUSSION
       A
prevailing party in an action to enforce a contract may recover attorney’s fees
and costs incurred if the contract so provides. (Civ.
Code, § 1717.) Defendants signed a credit application that provided for
recovery of “all reasonable collection and/or legal fees” in the event
Plaintiff was required to refer the matter to an attorney. (Defendant’s Ex. 3.)

       To
determine whether fees are reasonable, the court begins with the “lodestar”,
which is the number of hours reasonably spent multiplied by the reasonable
hourly rate. (PLCM
Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095.) The court
considers a number of factors including "the nature of the litigation, its
difficulty, the amount involved, the skill required in its handling, the
skill employed, the attention given, the success or failure, and other
circumstances in the case.’” (PLCM
Group at 1096.) The lodestar figure can be adjusted based on the
factors specific to the case. (Id.)
       To
determine a reasonable market rate, "the courts will look to equally
difficult or complex types of litigation.” (Syers
Properties III, Inc. v. Rankin (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 691, 700.)
The “market rate” is generally based on the rates prevalent in the community
where the court is located. (Id.) The trial court is in the best
position to value the services rendered by the attorneys in his or her
courtroom for the type of litigation at issue. The prevailing party is entitled
to “’compensation for all the hours reasonably spent’ in
litigating the action to a successful conclusion. (Ibid., italics in
original.) ‘Reasonably spent’ means that time spent ‘in the form of inefficient
or duplicative efforts is not subject to compensation.’” (Horsford
v. Board of Trustees of California State University (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th
359, 394.)
       The
Court has reviewed Plaintiff’s billing records in support of the fee request. Given
Plaintiff’s counsel’s experience in freight charge litigation and
transportation law, the non-complex nature of the case, Defendants’ absence at
trial and at court hearings throughout the litigation of this matter, and the
result obtained, the Court finds that $400 per hour is reasonable. (Decl. of
Kathleen C. Jeffries.)  
       The
billing records reflect that Plaintiff’s counsel spent 53.4 hours litigating
this case from July 10, 2022, through October 30, 2023, which the Court finds
were reasonably incurred. Accordingly, the Court awards total fees of
$21,360.00 ($400 per hour x 53.4 hours), reduced from $25,768.00.
