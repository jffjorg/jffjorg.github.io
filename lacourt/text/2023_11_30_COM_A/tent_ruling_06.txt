[TENTATIVE] ORDER DENYING
DEFENDANTS’
 MOTION FOR JUDGMENT NOTWITHSTANDING THE VERDICT
 
I.       
BACKGROUND
       This action originally commenced as a derivative action filed
by Plaintiff, Kris Park, on behalf of SIWY Denim, Inc. (“SIWY”). Plaintiff
alleges that Defendants conspired to embezzle funds from SIWY. In the related
matter, BC714096 SIWY Denim, Inc, Raven Denim, Inc, Kiwi Media Group, USA, Inc.
v. Kris Park, Defendants alleged claims for breach of contract breach of the
implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, fraud, negligence
misrepresentation, conversion, and breach of fiduciary duty. On July 31, 2023,
the jury rendered its verdict in favor of Plaintiff, Kris Park (“Park”), and
SIWY (collectively, “Plaintiffs”).
       At trial, the parties agreed to consolidate both cases in a
Master Complaint subsequently amended. The operative pleading is the Second
Amended Master Complaint (“SAMC”). Park added claims for breach of contract
claim against Kiwi and intentional and negligent misrepresentation against Kiwi
and Chung. Park dismissed claims against Chung and Defendant Cho. (SAMC, filed
7/25/23.) 
II.      ARGUMENTS
       On the claim for breach of the asset assignment agreement
contract the jury awarded $14.4 million in favor of Park. Defendants, Kiwi Co. (“Kiwi”)
and Chul Woong Chung (“Chung”) (collectively, “Defendants”), argue that the
jury’s finding that Park entered into a contract with Kiwi was not consistent
with nor supported by the facts. Chung argues that the jury erroneously found that
Chung owed a fiduciary duty to SIWY, and there was no evidence to support the award
of $15.8 million against Chung for that purported breach. Defendants argue that
the punitive damage award of $4 million dollars is not supported by substantial
evidence. 
       In opposition, Plaintiffs argue that Kiwi and Chung initially
maintained that none of the purported contracts were legally binding. In the
middle of trial all parties agreed to amending the complaint to add a claim for
breach of contract against Kiwi. There is substantial evidence to support the
verdict. 
       In reply, Defendants argue that the jury was clearly confused
given the complex transactions. The Court should correct the jury’s verdict.
III.    LEGAL
STANDARDS
       A
motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict of a jury pursuant to Civil
Procedure section 629 may properly be granted "only if it appears from
the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the party securing the
verdict, that there is no substantial evidence to support the verdict. If there
is any substantial evidence, or reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom, in
support of the verdict, the motion should be denied.” (Simmons
v. Ware (2013) 213 Cal.App.4th 1035, 1048.)  
       The
court’s discretion in granting the motion is “severely limited.” (Id. at
1047.) The trial court cannot "reweigh the
evidence [citation] or judge the credibility of witnesses. [Citation.] If the
evidence is conflicting or if several reasonable inferences may be drawn, the
motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict should be denied.” (Simmons at 1047; Castro
v. State of California (1981) 114 Cal.App.3d 503, 513 [“the
very existence of the conflict rendered it inappropriate for the court to grant
the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict."].) 
       The motion can be sustained “only
when it can be said as a matter of law that no other reasonable conclusion is
legally deducible from the evidence, and that any other holding would be so
lacking in evidentiary support that the reviewing court would be compelled to
reverse it, or the trial court would be compelled to set it aside as a matter
of law.” (Moore
v. City & County of San Francisco (1970) 5 Cal.App.3d 728, 733.) 
IV.   
DISCUSSION
       Plaintiff
Park testified to the existence of the asset agreement between Plaintiff Park
and Kiwi calling for an exchange of shares. Park testified that she performed
her part of the agreement by transferring shares to Kiwi. (7/20/23 R.T. 54:28-55:1-16;
57:4-16; 58:11-14, 58:28 – 59:1-6.) Defendant Chung testified that the contract
was binding. (7/21/23 R.T. 8:22-27; 9:4-5.) The existence of the agreement is
supported by substantial evidence; Defendants’ contention that the jury was
“confused” is not a basis for a different judgment. (Mot. 7:22-23.) 
       The
evidence supported the existence of a fiduciary duty owed by Chung to SIWY. The
law recognizes that "officers and directors owe a fiduciary duty to
stockholders and controlling stockholders owe a fiduciary duty to minority
stockholders." (Singhania
v. Uttarwar (2006) 136 Cal.App.4th 416, 426.) The Statement of
Information for Siwy Denim, Inc., admitted at trial, identified Chung as an
additional director. (Beck decl., Ex. 6, .pdf p. 173.) Defendants cite
conflicting testimony of Park, however, the existence of a conflict in evidence
warrants denial of the motion. (Castro at 513.) Chung’s breach, as
supported by the evidence, was Chung’s failure to make the minimum purchase
requirements of SIWY product that would be used to fund SIWY’s business
operations. (Beck decl., ¶ 23 (7/20/23 RT 11:3-20.) 
       With
respect to the jury’s award of $15.8 in damages for Defendant’s breach, the
award was supported by substantial evidence of Defendant’s failure to adhere to
the minimum purchase schedule. Chung testified Kiwi purchased only $1.3 million
of SIWY product although the contract required $25 million in five years. (Beck
decl., ¶ 22, 7/20/23 RT 111:5-9; 112:6-9.) Plaintiff Park also testified to
Kiwi’s failure. (Beck decl., ¶ 23, 7/20/23 RT 11:3-20-; 12:17-13:9.)
       Defendant
Chung argues that there was no evidence to show his conduct constituted malice,
fraud, or oppression to support the award of punitive damages. “Malice” is
defined as “despicable conduct which is carried on by the defendant with a
willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” (Civ. Code, § 3294 subd. (c)(1); College Hospital Inc. v. Superior
Court (1994) 8 Cal.4th 704, 725.)
“Despicable conduct” refers to circumstances that are “base, vile, or
contemptible.” (College Hospital Inc. v. Superior Court (1994) 8 Cal.
4th 704, 725.). 
       Defendants
contend that the verdict was inconsistent in that the jury agreed that Chung
had reasonable grounds for believing that the representations made were true,
which would arguably remove the negligent misrepresentation claim as a
predicate to support the punitive damages claim. However, the punitive damages
claim is supported by the jury’s finding of other predicate acts.       The jury found that Defendants engaged in
conduct with malice, fraud, or oppression in connection with Park’s and SIWY’s
claim for breach of fiduciary duty, conversion, or constructive fraud. (Beck
decl., ¶ 24.) 
       The
evidence adduced at trial supports Plaintiffs’ contention that Chung transferred
the Overseas Distribution Agreement to another company, Deco & E, who paid $3.5
million as a security deposit. (Beck decl., ¶ 25, 7/24/23 RT 6:22-24;
11:17-18.) Chung testified that he did not receive cash and that if he had, it
would have been paid to SIWY. (Id.) He later affirmed
Kiwi received the deposit and used the money. (Beck decl., ¶ 25, 7/24/23 RT
20:19-21; 21:18-22:8.) The evidence supports a finding of despicable conduct. 
  
V.     
CONCLUSION
       Defendants
have not met their burden of showing that “no other reasonable conclusion is
legally deducible from the evidence.” (Moore
v. City & County of San Francisco (1970) 5 Cal.App.3d 728, 733.)
Accordingly, Defendant’s motion is DENIED.
