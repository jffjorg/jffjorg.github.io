And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the defendant, granting their motion to compel verified responses to form interrogatories, set one, which were served on the plaintiffs on May 1, 2023. The plaintiffs, Ronnie Bass Sr and Gerald Brown, failed to respond to the interrogatories and did not file an opposition by November 15, 2023. As a result, the court finds that the plaintiffs have waived their right to object to the discovery requests. The court orders the plaintiffs to serve verified responses to the interrogatories within 10 days.

Additionally, the court has tentatively imposed monetary sanctions of $545 against each of the plaintiffs, payable within 10 days, due to their failure to timely respond to the authorized methods of discovery. The court finds that $235 per hour is a reasonable billing rate and two hours to prepare each motion is a reasonable time spent.
