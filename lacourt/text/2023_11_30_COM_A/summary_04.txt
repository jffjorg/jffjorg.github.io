Here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge regarding a motion to quash service of summons on Denise Kontos and Peter Kontos. The case arises from alleged failure to pay wages and overtime, and failure to provide rest periods in violation of the Labor Code. Denise Kontos died in September 2022, and the plaintiff served her by substituted service on August 28, 2023. The plaintiff did not file an opposition to the motion to quash service of summons.

The judge grants the motion to quash service of summons on Denise Kontos because she is deceased and cannot be a party to the action. The judge also grants the motion to quash service of summons on Peter Kontos because the plaintiff has not met its burden of establishing that it satisfied the requirements of Civil Procedure section 474. The plaintiff's arguments regarding Peter Kontos' liability are irrelevant to the issues raised by the defendant.
