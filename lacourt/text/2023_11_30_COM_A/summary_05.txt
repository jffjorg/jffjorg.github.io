And here is the English-text summary:

Based on the information presented, Judge [Tentative Ruling by Judge] has issued a tentative ruling denying Raenna Clark's motion to transfer the case to another district in Los Angeles County. The motion was filed based on Civil Procedure, section 396a subd. (e), which permits transfer of an action to a different superior court if the action is not pending in the proper court or "for other cause." However, the Court finds that this section does not apply to this wrongful death case. The Plaintiff also contended that the Court has a "mentoring" relationship with defense counsel, which creates an appearance of partiality. The Court finds this contention to be unfounded and inaccurate. Furthermore, the Court has a long-standing professional relationship with the Honorable Laura Walton, a judicial officer also presiding in the South Central District. As a result, the Court recuses itself in furtherance of the interests of justice. The matter has been referred for reassignment to the Supervising Judge of the South Central District, Department D, who will determine whether to recuse Judge Wasserman, the new assigned judge, under the circumstances.
