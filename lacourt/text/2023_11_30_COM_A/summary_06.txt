And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The court has denied the defendant's motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, which argued that the jury's verdict was not supported by the evidence. The plaintiff, Kris Park, brought a derivative action on behalf of SIWY Denim, Inc. against the defendants, alleging that they conspired to embezzle funds from SIWY. At trial, the parties agreed to consolidate the cases in a Master Complaint, which was subsequently amended. The jury rendered a verdict in favor of the plaintiffs, awarding $14.4 million in damages for breach of contract and $15.8 million in damages for breach of fiduciary duty. The defendants argued that the verdict was not supported by the evidence, but the court found that there was substantial evidence to support the verdict. The court also found that the punitive damages award was supported by the jury's finding of despicable conduct. The defendant's motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict was denied, and the verdict was upheld.
