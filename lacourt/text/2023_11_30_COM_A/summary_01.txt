```

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the motion for attorney's fees filed by Fiasco Enterprises, the plaintiff, and has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion. The dispute arose from the defendants' failure to pay for transportation and related services provided by the plaintiff in the amount of $84,570.25. After a court trial, the court entered judgment in favor of the plaintiff in the amount of $97,409.37. The defendants signed a credit application that provided for the recovery of "all reasonable collection and/or legal fees" in the event the plaintiff was required to refer the matter to an attorney. The court found that the plaintiff's counsel spent 53.4 hours litigating the case and that the reasonable hourly rate was $400 per hour. Based on this, the court awards a total of $21,360.00 in attorney's fees, which is reduced from the original request of $25,768.00.
