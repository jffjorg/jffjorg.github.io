And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's unopposed motion to compel the deposition of non-party witness Patrick Renteria. The defendant had issued a valid out-of-state deposition subpoena to Renteria, and Renteria agreed to remotely appear for deposition. However, after the plaintiff posted threats on social media to prevent Renteria from testifying, Renteria did not appear at the deposition. The court finds that the plaintiff's actions violated the protective orders in place and ordered Renteria to appear for deposition within 30 days.
