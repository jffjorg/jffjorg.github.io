Discussion
Payee
Information on Petition
Insurance Code §§10139.5(c)-(d) provides as follows: 
(c)  Every petition for approval of a transfer of
structured settlement payment rights, except as provided in subdivision (d),
shall include, to the extent known after the transferee has made reasonable
inquiry with the payee, all of the following: 
 
(1)
The payee’s name, address, and age.
 
(2)
The payee’s marital status, and, if married or separated, the name of
the payee’s spouse.      
 
(3)
The names, ages, and place or places of residence of the payee’s minor
children or other dependents, if any.
 
(4)
The amounts and sources of the payee’s monthly income and financial
resources and, if presently married, the amounts and sources of the monthly
income and financial resources of the payee’s spouse. 
 
(5)
 Whether the payee is currently
obligated under any child support or spousal support order, and, if so, the
names, addresses, and telephone numbers of any individual, entity, or agency
that is receiving child or spousal support from the payee under that order or
that has jurisdiction over the order or the payments in question.
 
(6)
Information regarding previous transfers or attempted transfers, as
described in paragraph (11), (12), or (13) of subdivision (b).  The transferee or payee may choose to provide
this information by providing copies of pleadings, transaction documents, or
orders involving any previous attempted or completed transfer or by providing
the court a summary of available information regarding any previous transfer or
attempted transfer, such as the date of the transfer or attempted transfer, the
payments transferred or attempted to be transferred by the payee in the earlier
transaction, the amount of money received by the payee in connection with the
previous transaction, and generally the payee’s reasons for pursuing or
completing a previous transaction.  The
transferee’s inability to provide the information required by this paragraph
shall not preclude the court from approving the proposed transfer, if the court
determines that the information is not available to the transferee after the
transferee has made a reasonable effort to secure the information, including
making an inquiry with the payee.
 
(d)
With respect to the information required to be included in every
petition for approval of a transfer of structured settlement payment rights
pursuant to paragraphs (2), (3), (4), (5), and (6) of subdivision (c), that
information shall be deemed to be included in the petition if it is provided at
the scheduled hearing on the proposed transfer through oral testimony or
documentary evidence filed with the court and made a part of the record
consistent with the rules of evidence and procedure.
 
(Ins. Code
§§§10139.5(c)-(d).)
The
Amended Petition provides all information required in Insurance Code §10139.5(c).  (See Decl. of Estrellado ¶¶8-9, 13;
Amended Petition, Exh. 1.)
 
Specific Findings
Pursuant to
Insurance Code §10139.5(a):
A
direct or indirect transfer of structured settlement payment rights is not
effective and a structured settlement obligor or annuity issuer is not required
to make any payment directly or indirectly to any transferee of structured
settlement payment rights unless the transfer has been approved in advance in a
final court order based on express written findings by the court that: 
(1) The transfer is in the best interest of the payee,
taking into account the welfare and support of the payee’s dependents.
 
(2) The payee has been advised in writing by the
transferee to seek independent professional advice regarding the transfer and
has either received that advice or knowingly waived, in writing, the
opportunity to receive the advice.  
 
(3) The transferee has complied with the notification
requirements pursuant to paragraph (2) of subdivision (f), the transferee has
provided the payee with a disclosure form that complies with Section 10136, and
the transfer agreement complies with Sections 10136 and 10138. 
 
(4) The transfer does not contravene any applicable
statute or the order of any court or other government authority. 
 
(5) The payee understands the terms of the transfer
agreement, including the terms set forth in the disclosure statement required
by Section 10136. 
 
(6) The payee understands and does not wish to exercise
the payee’s right to cancel the transfer agreement. 
 
(Ins. Code §10139.5(a).)
 
(1)
Best Interest of Payee (Ins. Code §10139.5(a)(1)):  
Insurance Code section 10139.5(b)
lists 15 factors for the court to consider in determining whether the transfer
would be fair, reasonable, and in the payee’s best interests.
The Payee declares he is the recipient of certain structured settlement
payments under a structured settlement agreement under which Pacific Life &
Annuity Services, Inc. (“Payment Obligor”) is the obligor and pursuant to which
the Payment Obligor purchased an annuity contract from Pacific Life Insurance
Company (“Payment Issuer”) to fund the aforesaid obligation.  (Decl. of Estrellado ¶2.)  The Payee declares Subject to this Court’s
approval of the Amended Petition, he has entered into a transfer agreement (“Transfer
Agreement”) to transfer the following structured settlement payments to Petitioner
or its assignee: 30 monthly payments in the amount of $3,599.89 which will
become due and payable commencing March 1, 2024, through and including August 1,
2026 (“Transferred Payments”).  (Decl. of
Estrellado ¶3; Amended Petition, Exh. 2.) 
The aggregate amount of payments to be transferred is $79,700.00 to the
Payee in exchange for selling the transferee future payments totaling
$107,996.70.  (Amended Petition, Exh. 2
at §5.2.)  The future payments have a
discounted present value equal to $99,033.30. 
(Amended Petition, Exh. 2 at §5.6.) 
The original annuity contract provided Payee with $3,599.89 for life,
payable monthly, guaranteed for five years, beginning on 9/1/2021, with the
last guaranteed payment on 8/1/2026. 
(Amended Petition, Exh. 1 at Addendum No. 1.)
The Payee declares he intends to use the proceeds he receives from this
transaction to cover the cost of his timeshare while in the process of trying
to sell it, pay property taxes, and pay other financial obligations like homeowner
association fees.  (Decl. of Estrellado
¶11.)  The Payee declares the Transferred
Payments that he is assigning are the remainder of his guaranteed monthly
payments under the policy, and beginning September 1, 2026, he will begin to
receive life contingent payments.  (Decl.
of Estrellado ¶12.)  The Payee declares the
structured settlement was not designed to provide me with future payments for future
medical care or loss of income as a result of the circumstances that gave rise
to the settlement.  (Decl. of Estrellado
¶14.)  The Payee declares he does not
believe that approval of this transfer will negatively affect his standard of
living, and that he has determined this transfer is in his best interest and
will improve his quality of life.  (Decl.
of Estrellado ¶15.)
In light of the original terms of the original annuity contract, the
structured settlement before the Court appears substantially similar to the
terms of the guaranteed payments, with the same ending date as the guaranteed
payments under the annuity contract.  (Compare
Amended Petition, Exh. 2. §5.2 with Amended Petition, Exh. 1 at Addendum
No. 1.)  The Court considers Payee’s
evaluation of his own life circumstances, as there is no documentation before
the Court to believe the Payee does not have sufficient mental capacity or
maturity to make such an evaluation.
On balance, the Court finds that the
transfer is in the best interest of the Payee. 
(Ins. Code §10139.5(a)(1).)
 
(2)
Advice to Seek Independent Professional Advice (Ins. Code
§10139.5(a)(2)):  
The Payee has been
advised in writing by the Petitioner to seek independent professional advice
regarding the transfer and has waived, in writing, the opportunity to receive
the advice.  (Decl. of Estrellado ¶7; Amended
Petition, Exh. 3 at pg. 3 of 3; Ins. Code
§10139.5(a)(2).)
 
(3)
Notices/Disclosures/Transfer Agreement (Ins. Code
§10139.5(a)(3)):  
Notifications (Ins. Code
§10139.5(f)(2))
The Transferee timely filed a notice of the proposed
transfer and the petition for its authorization at least 20 days before
hearing.  (Ins.
Code §10139.5(f)(2).)
The
notice includes the petition, copies of the transfer agreement and disclosures,
and a listing of dependents.  (11/8/23 Proof
of Service; Ins. Code §10139.5(f)(2)(A)-(D).)
 
Disclosures Form (Ins. Code §10136(b))
 
The
Transferee provided all disclosures to Payee at least 10 days before the Payee
executed the transfer agreement.  (Amended
Petition, Exh. 3; Ins. Code §10136(b).)
The disclosures include all
statements required under section 10136(b). (Amended Petition, Exh. 3.) 
 
Transfer
Agreement:  Required Information (Ins. Code
§10136):
The Transfer Agreement sets forth all
information required under §10136(c).  (Amended
Petition, Exh. 2 at §§5.1-5.13.)
 
Transfer
Agreement:  Prohibited Provisions (Ins. Code
§10138):  
Transfer Agreement does not contain
any prohibited provisions under §10138. 
 
For the reasons stated above, the
transfer complies with Insurance Code §10139.5(a)(3).
 
(4) Contravention
of Statute or Court Order
(Ins. Code §10139.5(a)(4)):
There does not appear to be any
applicable statute or court order contravened by this transaction.
 
(5) Payee
Understands Terms Including Disclosures (Ins. Code §10139.5(a)(5)):
The Payee appears to understand the
effect of this agreement. (Decl. of Estrellado ¶¶11-16.)
 
(6) Payee’s
Right to Cancel
(Ins. Code § 10139.5(a)(6)):
The Payee appears to understand the
right to cancel.  (Amended Petition, Exh.
2 at pgs. 12-13 of 13.)
 
For
the reasons stated above, the Court finds that the transaction complies with
all requirements set forth in Insurance Code §10139.5(a)(1)-(6).  
Because
the transaction complies with all requirements set forth in Insurance Code §10139.5(a)(1)-(6),
the Court GRANTS the Petition for Approval of Transfer of Structured
Settlement Payment Rights under Insurance Code §§10134, et seq.  
 
 
Petitioner
to submit a proposed order granting the petition.
 
Conclusion
Petitioner’s Amended Petition is granted.
Moving
Party to give notice.
