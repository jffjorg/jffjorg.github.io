MICHELLE ARIANNA GARZA,
 
  
         vs.
 
SHELDEN COYASO BALATICO, et al.


 Case No.: 
  20STCV35070
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  December 4, 2023



 
Defendant
Fitness International, LLC’s unopposed motion to compel the deposition
of Non-party Witness Patrick Renteria is granted.  Non-Party Patrick Renteria is
ordered to appear for deposition within 30 days. 
 
          Defendant
Fitness International, LLC (“Fitness International”) (“Defendant”) moves unopposed
to compel Non-party
Witness Patrick Renteria (“Renteria”) to appear for deposition and enforce the
deposition subpoena.  (Notice of Motion,
pg. 1; C.C.P §1987.1.)
Having reviewed Defendant’s unopposed
Motion to Compel Renteria to Comply with Deposition Subpoena, the Court rules
as follows.
 
On April 14, 2023, Defendant issued a
valid out-of-state deposition subpoena of Renteria.  (Decl. of An ¶4, Exh. A.)  On September 21, 2023, after this Court denied
Plaintiff’s motion to quash the deposition of Renteria, Defendant served its
Second Amended Notice of Deposition Renteria on September 21, 2023, set for
October 5, 2023.  (Decl. of An ¶6, Exh. C.)
 Renteria agreed to remotely appear on
October 5, 2023, for deposition.
On the week of the deposition, on
October 2, 2023, pro per Plaintiff Michelle Garza (“Garza”)
(“Plaintiff”) posted on her social media account to prevent Renteria from
testifying in this deposition, which included threats to Renteria of a motion
for enforcement for a violation of the protective order and jail time if he chooses
to attend his deposition.  (Decl. of An ¶7,
Exhs. D, E.)  Plaintiff removed the
original post and reposted a similar post on October 5, 2023.  (See Decl. of An ¶7, Exhs. D, E.)  As a result, Renteria informed Defendant that
he would not appear at the deposition as noticed, and Renteria did not appear
at the deposition on October 5, 2023, where Defendant obtained a certificate of
non-appearance.  (Decl. of An ¶10, Exh. H.)
At the Final Status Conference on
October 20, 2023, Plaintiff conveyed to this Court that the mutual protective
orders in place would be violated should the deposition proceed and that this
Court should obtain the approval of the Texas Court.  Despite this Court’s order to submit the
protective order issued by the Court in Texas by October 30, 2023, to date,
Plaintiff has not done so.  
The dueling protective orders, which
were provided to Defendant by Renteria in response to the deposition subpoena,
does not prohibit Renteria from testifying at a remote deposition.  (Decl. of An ¶¶8-9, Exhs. F, G.)
          The
Court grants the motion pursuant to C.C.P. §1987.1 and orders Renteria
to appear for deposition within 30 days.
          Moving
Party to give notice.
