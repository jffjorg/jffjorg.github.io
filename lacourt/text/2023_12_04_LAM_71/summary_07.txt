  - Personal jurisdiction may be either general or specific.
  - The purposeful availment test is only satisfied if the defendant purposefully and voluntarily directs its activities toward California so that the defendant should expect, because of the benefits it receives, to be subject to jurisdiction here based on its contacts with California.
  - The court will exercise specific jurisdiction over a defendant when the defendant has purposefully availed itself of the forum state, and the controversy is related to or arises out of a defendant's contacts with the forum.
  - The court will exercise general jurisdiction over a defendant when the defendant has substantial and systematic contacts with the forum state.
  - The court will not exercise jurisdiction over a defendant when the defendant has only a passive website that does little more than make information available to those who are interested in it.
```

Summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants Global Communications Group, Inc.'s (GCG) motion to quash service of summons. The plaintiff, Jose J. Licea, has failed to demonstrate by a preponderance of evidence that GCG has sufficient contacts with California to establish personal jurisdiction over GCG. GCG's website is considered a passive website that does little more than make information available to those who are interested in it, and therefore, the court will not exercise jurisdiction over GCG. The court also finds that GCG does not have any offices, property, or employees in California, and therefore, it would be unreasonable to require GCG to appear in the California court.
