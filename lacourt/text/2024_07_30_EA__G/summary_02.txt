And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge continues the hearing on Reyes Vargas's motion to strike punitive damages from Ramirez's Complaint. The judge finds that Reyes Vargas's counsel did not adequately meet and confer with Ramirez's counsel before filing the motion, as required by California law. Therefore, the judge orders Reyes Vargas's counsel to meet and confer with Ramirez's counsel regarding the motion to strike and file a supplemental declaration describing these efforts at least nine court days before the next scheduled hearing. The hearing on the motion to strike is continued to a date to be determined.
