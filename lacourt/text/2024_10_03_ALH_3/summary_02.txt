And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has decided to continue the hearing on the distribution of surplus funds from the trustee's sale of a property located at 540 N Marengo Avenue, Apt 3, Pasadena, CA 91101. The surplus funds were deposited with the court on June 3, 2024, and the court has determined that the funds should be distributed according to Civil Code section 2924k, which sets out the order of priority for the distribution of surplus funds. However, the court has also decided to delay the distribution of the surplus funds until June 2, 2025, in light of a pending wrongful foreclosure lawsuit filed by Marti Mackey, who claims that the trustee's sale was wrongful and seeks declaratory relief and damages. The court has also set a non-appearance case review for April 2, 2025, to assess the progress of Mackey's lawsuit.
