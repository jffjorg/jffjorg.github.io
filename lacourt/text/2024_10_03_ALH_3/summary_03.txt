And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the motion filed by Malek H. Shraibati and BD&J, PC to be relieved as counsel of record for plaintiff Virginia Maria Rodriguez. The reason for the motion is a significant breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. The court finds that there is no prejudice that would result from granting the motion, as the trial in the matter has not yet been set. Therefore, the court has granted the motion and it will take effect once a proof of service is filed showing that the order has been served on the plaintiff and all parties who have appeared in the case.
