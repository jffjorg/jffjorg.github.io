Malek H.
 Shraibati and BD&J, PC seek to be relieved as counsel of record
for plaintiff
 Virginia Maria Rodriguez (“Plaintiff”) on grounds that there has
 been a significant breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. Absent
a showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney’s request for withdrawal should
be granted. (People v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406.) 
The Court notes that trial in this
matter is not yet set and no prejudice will result from granting these motions.
Accordingly, this unopposed motion to be relieved is GRANTED and effective upon
filing a proof of service showing service of this Order on Plaintiff and all
parties who have appeared. 
 
Moving party to give notice.
 
Dated
this 3rd
day of October 2024
