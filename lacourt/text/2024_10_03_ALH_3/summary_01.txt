And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a demurrer filed by the defendant, County of Los Angeles, to the plaintiff's first amended complaint (FAC). The demurrer argues that the plaintiff failed to comply with the claim presentation requirements of the Government Tort Claims Act and that the FAC does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action for negligence per se and negligence. The judge notes that the FAC is not available in the Court's records, and therefore cannot determine if the allegations are sufficient. The judge continues the hearing to allow the plaintiff to file a copy of the FAC and to give the parties an opportunity to brief the issue further. The hearing is set for a future date, and the parties are advised to submit on the tentative ruling and to assume that the opposing party may appear at the hearing to argue the matter.
