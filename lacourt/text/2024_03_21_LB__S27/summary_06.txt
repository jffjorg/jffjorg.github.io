And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the defendants. The Judge finds that the case is subject to demurrer under CCP § 430.20(c), which provides for demurrer when there is another action pending between the same parties on the same cause of action. The Judge is concerned about the potential res judicata or collateral estoppel effect of the first lawsuit and finds that abating this action pending the outcome of the trial is appropriate. The Judge sustains the demurrer and abates the action pending trial in the first lawsuit. The Judge also requests that the plaintiff amend the complaint at least two weeks prior to the continued hearing date, if necessary.
