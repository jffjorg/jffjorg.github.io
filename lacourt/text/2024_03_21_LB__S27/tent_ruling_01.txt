  Case Number:  19LBCV00551    Hearing Date:   March 21, 2024    Dept:  S27 1.    
Motion for Sanctions
Plaintiff seeks imposition of sanctions against Defendants and their
attorney of record, contending they have willfully failed to pay sanctions in
violation of the Court’s 5/18/23 order. 
They seek sanctions pursuant to CRC 2.30(b).  
 
The motion is denied for two reasons. 
First, as Defendants correctly note in opposition to the motion, CRC
2.30(b) permits the Court to impose sanctions if the moving party shows that
the opposing party violated a rule of court. 
Plaintiff made no such showing here. 
Plaintiff instead moves for sanctions based on Defendants’ failure to
pay court-ordered sanctions.
 
Second, pursuant to Newland v. Superior Court (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th
608, 615, sanctions awards are immediately enforceable as monetary judgments,
and failure to pay sanctions awards should not typically be used as the basis for
imposition of further sanctions.  
 
2.    
Motions
to be Relieved as Counsel
Defendants’ attorney filed motions to be relieved as counsel on 3/11/24,
setting the motions to be heard on the first available date, 4/04/24.  On 3/13/24, the Court granted Counsel’s ex
parte application to have the hearing date on the motions advanced in light of
the 3/25/24 trial date.  
 
The Court, at the ex parte hearing, ordered Hooman Nissani and any
attorney he retained to appear at the 3/21/24 hearing.  The Court will, at the time of the hearing,
hear from Counsel (in camera if necessary) and Nissani concerning the conflict
that has arisen between them.  The Court
recognizes that the entity defendants cannot proceed to trial absent attorney
representation, and is therefore loathe to relieve their attorney without either
a newly retained attorney and/or a heightened showing of good cause for
relief.  The Court notes that the case
has been pending since fall of 2019 and that Plaintiff opposes any relief that
would give rise to a trial date continuance.
