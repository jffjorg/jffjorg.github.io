Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the demurrer to the First Amended Answer filed by Prestig, Inc. and has sustained it without leave to amend in part and with leave to amend in part. The judge has found that certain affirmative defenses, including 6, 10, 13, 16, 20, 21, 25, and 29, are insufficiently pled and sustain the demurrer without leave to amend. The judge has also sustained the demurrer to affirmative defenses 25 and 34 without leave to amend.

The judge has ordered Cross-Defendants to file a Second Amended Answer within twenty days. The judge has also ordered Cross-Complainant to give notice of the ruling.

The judge's tentative ruling does not address the motion to strike the First Amended Answer, as the motion is duplicative of the arguments made in the demurrer. The judge anticipates that Cross-Defendants will file a Second Amended Answer through their retained attorney.
