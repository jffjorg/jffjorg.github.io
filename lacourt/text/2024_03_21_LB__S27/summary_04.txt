And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel further responses in a lemon law case. The court has seen a dramatic increase in such motions and is frustrated that attorneys for both parties are failing to meet and confer in good faith to resolve issues. The judge notes that this has led to a significant amount of unnecessary work, with discovery motions often taking up multiple hearing slots per week. The court finds that the attorneys are aware of how it will rule on the motions, yet continue to incur attorneys' fees. The judge is ordering the parties to meet and confer, with a continued hearing on May 2, 2024. If the parties are unable to resolve their issues, they must file a joint statement outlining the items in dispute and make arguments relevant only to each item. If the parties resolve their issues, they must take the motion off calendar. The judge also warns that failure to comply with these requirements may result in sanctions.
