The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for summary judgment in the case of Chelsey Binz vs. LBMMC, et al. The plaintiff, Chelsey Binz, is seeking damages for complications that arose during her labor and delivery, which caused damage to her child, Indiana Rayne Van Den Oever. The defendant, Dr. Cardin, is being sued for medical negligence and NIED. The judge has denied the motion for summary judgment and ordered the defendant to give notice.

The judge's ruling is based on the evidence and arguments presented, including the plaintiff's expert declaration and the defendant's supporting documents. The defendant argued that the plaintiff's expert declaration is not admissible, but the judge overruled this objection. The judge also considered the defendant's arguments that the plaintiff's evidence does not support the claims, but found that the plaintiff has presented sufficient evidence to raise a triable issue of fact.

The judge's tentative ruling sets forth the legal standards for summary judgment, including the requirement that the moving party show that there are no triable issues of material fact and that the plaintiff may defeat the motion by producing evidence showing that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to that cause of action. The judge's ruling is subject to change based on any further arguments or evidence presented at the hearing.
