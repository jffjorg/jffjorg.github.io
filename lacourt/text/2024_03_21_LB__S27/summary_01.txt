And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motions before the court. The plaintiff has filed a motion for sanctions against the defendants, claiming they have willfully failed to pay sanctions in violation of the court's 5/18/23 order. The judge denies the motion because the plaintiff failed to show that the defendants violated a rule of court, and instead relies on their failure to pay court-ordered sanctions. The judge also notes that sanctions awards are immediately enforceable as monetary judgments and should not be used as the basis for further sanctions.

The judge also addresses the defendants' motion to be relieved as counsel. The defendants' attorney has filed a motion to be relieved as counsel, and the court has granted an ex parte application to advance the hearing date. The judge will hear from the parties at the 3/21/24 hearing and will consider the conflict between the defendants and their attorney. The judge notes that the case has been pending since 2019 and that the plaintiff opposes any relief that would result in a trial date continuance.
