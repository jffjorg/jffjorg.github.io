The parties agreed to supplement their responses to special interrogatories and requests for production by February 16, 2024. The deadline for filing and serving motions to compel further responses has been extended to March 8, 2024. The parties must file a joint statement within 5 days of serving supplemental responses, which must include information about whether the parties have resolved the issue of sanctions. If the parties fully resolve all pending discovery issues, the moving party must cancel any pending motion off-calendar and cancel all Court Reservation System reservations.
