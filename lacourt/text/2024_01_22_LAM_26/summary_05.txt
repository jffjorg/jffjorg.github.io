The tentative ruling denies the petition without prejudice due to the Petitioner's failure to provide identification tied to a fingerprint, which is necessary for Probation to run a criminal history assessment. The Court had previously ordered the Petitioner to provide such identification on November 27, 2023, but the Petitioner failed to comply. The Petitioner is given the opportunity to resubmit a petition addressing the lack of identification.
