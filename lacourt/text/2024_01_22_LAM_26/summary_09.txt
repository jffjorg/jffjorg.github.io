The Judge's tentative ruling is that the name change criminal history assessment form has not been processed due to the Petitioner's failure to complete and file a request for the form or because Probation needs more time to complete it. The Petitioner must contact Probation to request the Name Change Probation Officer to complete the form before the continued hearing date. If the form is not completed, the petition will be denied without prejudice. The hearing is continued to March 4, 2024 at 9:30 a.m.
