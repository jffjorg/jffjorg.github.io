```

Summary:

The judge's tentative ruling is that the petition for writ of mandate is denied. The applicant, Maria De Jesus Abundis, was found liable for fraud in a civil action and ordered to pay damages and costs. She applied for a Mortgage Loan Originator (MLO) license endorsement, but the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) and Real Estate Commissioner denied her application due to her failure to fully acknowledge the wrongfulness of her actions and make bona fide attempts to satisfy the judgment. The judge concludes that substantial evidence supports the denial of Abundis' application and that she has failed to demonstrate rehabilitation.
