Respondent.







 

 



 


 


 


 

 


            Petitioner John Doe petitions for a writ
of mandate directing respondent Fuller Theological Seminary to set aside a decision
finding that petitioner engaged in sexual misconduct and suspending petitioner
for five quarters.  
 
I.       Factual Allegations
 
            This
is a sexual misconduct case. Jane Doe and petitioner John Doe were students at
respondent Fuller Theological Seminary. (First Amended Petition [“FAP”] at
1:21-23.) According to allegations from Jane, on October 13, 2021, petitioner
asked Jane sexual questions and made sexual comments. (FAP ¶ 15.) Petitioner
also allegedly showed Jane pornography without her consent. (FAP ¶ 15.) 
 
According to petitioner, Jane brought up topics
about her sexuality and that he only asked follow-up questions. (FAP ¶¶ 18, 24.)
Petitioner denied showing or attempting to show pornography to Jane. (FAP ¶
18.) 
 
            On
October 23, 2021, Jane alleged that petitioner touched her thigh without her consent
at a party. (FAP ¶ 15.) After the party and in Jane’s apartment, petitioner
allegedly placed Jane’s hand on his penis and touched her breasts and vagina
without her consent. (FAP ¶ 15.) 
 
According to petitioner, Jane prompted petitioner
to hold her hand. (FAP ¶ 19.) In Jane’s apartment, Jane purportedly initiated
sexual contact between them. (FAP ¶ 19.) Jane placed petitioner’s hand on her
breasts. (FAP ¶ 19.) Jane also placed her hand on petitioner’s penis. (FAP ¶
19.) Petitioner removed her hand, but Jane continued touching him on his penis,
including while he was asleep. (FAP ¶¶ 19, 24.)
 
Petitioner made a complaint with the Office of
Student Concerns based on his version of the events of October 23, 2021. (FAP ¶
16.) On December 2, 2021, respondent notified petitioner of Jane’s allegations
and indicated that the Office of Student Concerns would investigate Jane’s
claims. (FAP ¶ 12.) 
 
Petitioner was interviewed on December 10, 2021,
January 5, 2022, and February 7, 2022. (FAP ¶ 17.) On February 22, 2022,
petitioner was provided with the Investigator’s report. (FAP ¶ 22.) Petitioner
responded to the report on March 4, 2022. (FAP ¶ 22.) On May 5, 2022,
petitioner was provided a copy of the final report. (FAP ¶ 22.) 
 
On May 12, 2022, respondent conducted a hearing.
(FAP ¶ 24.) Petitioner testified to his version of the events of October 13,
2021 and October 23, 2021. (FAP ¶ 24.) 
 
On July 1, 2022, the hearing panel issued a report.
(FAP ¶ 25.) The hearing panel found that Jane did not violate respondent’s
sexual misconduct policy but that petitioner had engaged in non-consensual
sexual contact with Jane. (FAP ¶ 25.) Petitioner was removed from student
housing, directed to have no contact with Jane, and suspended for five
consecutive quarters. (FAP ¶ 26.) 
 
Petitioner appealed the hearing panel’s
determination, which was denied. (FAP ¶¶ 28, 29.) Petitioner alleges that the
hearing panel ignored exculpatory evidence and inconsistencies in the evidence,
having resolved such inconsistencies in favor of Jane. (FAP ¶ 27.)
 
II.      Procedural History
 
            On
January 26, 2023, petitioner filed a Petition for Writ of Administrative Mandate.
On March 22, 2023, petitioner filed a First Amended Petition for Writ of
Administrative Mandate. On January 5, 2024, respondent filed a Verified Answer
to the First Amended Petition. 
 
            On
May 11, 2023, the Court (Hon. Mary H. Strobel) set the hearing on the writ
petition for January 30, 2024. (5/11/23 Minute Order.) Judge Strobel ordered
petitioner’s opening brief to be filed sixty days prior to the hearing date, i.e.,
December 1, 2023.  Judge Stroble also
ordered that petitioner lodge the administrative record when filing
petitioner’s Reply Brief, which was due 15 days prior to the hearing on the
writ petition.  (5/11/23 Minute Order.)
 
No opening brief was filed or served. (See Engstrom
Decl. ¶ 3; Ishikawa Decl. ¶ 5 [respondent not served with opening brief].)  Nor has the administrative record been
lodged.
 
III.     Analysis
 
The
petition for writ of mandate is brought pursuant to CCP § 1094.5. (FAP at 3:5,
¶¶ 38, 39; Prayer for Relief at ¶ 3.) Under CCP § 1094.5, “the party
challenging the administrative decision bears the burden of convincing the
court that the administrative findings are contrary to the weight of the
evidence.” (Fukuda v. City of Angels (1999) 20 Cal.4th 805, 817; see
also Bixby v. Pierno (1971) 4 Cal.3d 130, 139.) “In a section 1094.5
proceeding, it is the responsibility of the petitioner to produce a sufficient record
of the administrative proceedings; ‘otherwise the presumption of regularity
will prevail, since the burden falls on the petitioner attacking the
administrative decision to demonstrate to the trial court where the
administrative proceedings were unfair, were in excess of jurisdiction, or
showed “ ‘prejudicial abuse of discretion.’ ” (Elizabeth D. v. Zolin
(1993) 21 Cal.App.4th 347, 354.)
 
Petitioner
also refers to CCP § 1085 in the operative petition. (FAP at 3:6, ¶¶ 6, 38.)
“There are two essential requirements to the issuance of a traditional writ of
mandate: (1) a clear, present and usually ministerial duty on the part of the
respondent, and (2) a clear, present and beneficial right on the part of the
petitioner to the performance of that duty.” (California Assn. for Health
Services at Home v. State Dept. of Health Services (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th
696, 704.) “An action in ordinary mandamus is proper where…the claim is that an
agency has failed to act as required by law.” (Id. at 705.)
 
An
agency is presumed to have regularly performed its official duties. (Evid. Code
§ 664.) “The petitioner always bears the burden of proof in a mandate
proceeding brought under Code of Civil Procedure section 1085.” (California
Correctional Peace Officers Assn. v. State Personnel Bd. (1995) 10 Cal.4th
1133, 1154.)
 
A
memorandum of points and authorities is required for a noticed motion,
including for mandamus. (See CRC 3.1113(a); Local Rule 3.231(b)
[describing noticed motion procedure for prerogative writs].) The absence of a
memorandum is an admission that the motion is not meritorious and may be
denied. (CRC 3.1113(a).) “The memorandum must contain a statement of facts, a
concise statement of the law, evidence and arguments relied on, and a
discussion of the statutes, cases, and textbooks cited in support of the position
advanced.” (CRC 3.1113(b); see also Local Rule 3.231(i)(2) [opening
brief must cite to administrative record].)
 
Rule
of Court 3.1113 “rests on a policy-based allocation of resources, preventing
the trial court from being cast as a tacit advocate for the moving party’s
theories”. (Quantum Cooking Concepts, Inc. v. LV Associates, Inc. (2011)
197 Cal.App.4th 927, 934.) A reviewing court “will not act as counsel for
either party to an appeal and will not assume the task of initiating and
prosecuting a search of the record for any purpose of discovering errors not
pointed out in the briefs.” (Fox v. Erickson (1950) 99 Cal.App.2d 740,
742.) The Court cannot evaluate arguments that are not made in the briefs and
cannot make the parties’ arguments for them. (Nelson v. Avondale HOA
(2009) 172 Cal.App.4th 857, 862-63 [argument waived if not raised]; Pfeifer
v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc. (2012) 211 Cal.App.4th 1250, 1282 [same].)
 
As
noted above, on May 11, 2023,
the Court (Hon. Mary H. Strobel) ordered petitioner to serve and file the
opening brief 60 days prior to the hearing date of January 30, 2024. (5/11/23
Minute Order.) Petitioner was ordered to lodge the administrative record
on the same day the reply brief was filed. (Ibid.)
 
No
opening brief was filed, timely or otherwise. No administrative record was
lodged, timely or otherwise. Accordingly, petitioner fails to meet his burden
to demonstrate how he was denied a fair hearing; how respondent failed to
proceed in the manner required by law; how respondent’s findings, decision, and
sanctions were not supported by the evidence; or how the sanction imposed
against petitioner was without legal justification or factual basis. (FAP ¶
38.)  In addition to affirmatively
failing to meet his burden, petitioner’s failure to file an open brief
constitutes a admission the petition lacks merit. (CRC 3.1113(a).)
 
IV.     Conclusion
 
            The
petition is DENIED.
