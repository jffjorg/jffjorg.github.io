Petitioner
Maria De Jesus Abundis petitions for a writ of mandate directing respondent California
Department of Real Estate, Douglas R. McCauley, Real Estate Commissioner to set
aside the October 10, 2022 final decision to deny petitioner’s application for
a Mortgage Loan Originator license and to issue said license.
I.       Factual Background
 
A.          
Events
Leading to Fraud Judgment
 
On
July 17, 2004, the Department of Real Estate (“DRE”) issued petitioner Maria De
Jesus Abundis a salesperson license.[1]
(AR 68.) In October 2005, petitioner got a listing to sell a home. (AR 67,
400:18-20, 408.) The sellers called her on the phone telling her they wanted to
sell their home. (AR 143, 207-08, 399, 403.) Petitioner prepared the paperwork
for the transaction and spoke to her broker about it. (AR 404-05.) At least one
of the sellers followed up with petitioner asking about the status of the
transaction, as the seller was looking for money to feed their children during
the holidays. (AR 404:25-405:9.) Petitioner spoke English and Spanish with her
clients, the sellers. (AR 400.)
At
the time, petitioner was 29 years of age. (AR 10 [no. 12], 408.) Petitioner was
an independent contractor fulfilling a one-year commitment to broker Gerardo
Montelongo. (AR 355-57, 396:21-25.) According to petitioner, Montelongo told
her to close the transaction as soon as possible. (AR 404:20-24.) Petitioner
did not receive a commission from the transaction. (AR 407:22-25.) 
 
In
February 2007, petitioner’s former clients sued her and Montelongo for fraud,
among other causes of action, related to the sale of their home. (AR 143-59,
258-83.) The civil complaint alleged that petitioner, while working for
employer-broker Montelongo, deceived her clients into participating as sellers
of their property in an illusory real estate transaction involving a “straw man”
buyer who was a friend of petitioner.  The
employer-broker was a broker for both sides of the transaction, acted as the
loan agent, and received a commission for the transaction.  After the transaction was consummated, the
straw man buyer reconveyed the “sold” property back to the seller’s wife as a
“gift.”  In connection with facilitating
the transaction, petitioner was accused of making false representations to the
sellers that they would obtain a lower interest rate and lower monthly
payments, whereas the payments and interest rate instead increased after the
transaction.  (AR 8, 146-47 [First
Amended Complaint for Damages ¶12].)
 
In
February 2010, petitioner appeared in pro se to defend herself at the bench
trial in the civil fraud action. (AR 130, 132.) Montelongo did not appear at
trial. (AR 130.)  In August 2010, the
court entered its statement of decision in favor of plaintiff sellers and against
petitioner and her former broker. (AR 131-32.) 
In September 2010, the court entered judgment awarding $135,000 in
damages against petitioner and her former broker “jointly and severally” for
“fraud and breach of fiduciary duties,” $142,245.50 in attorney’s fees, and
$11,959.00 in costs. (AR 130-32.)
 
The
DRE suspended petitioner’s license and lifted it less than a month later after
she paid $50,400 ($50,000 damages + $400 interest) to the DRE Recovery Account
Program.  The DRE had become the assignee
of the judgment after paying the civil fraud plaintiffs $50,000 for assignment
of the plaintiffs’ judgment rights.  (AR
8-9, 68, 76, 123 [ROA 239], 409:2-7.) A partial satisfaction of judgment was
subsequently filed. (AR 124 [ROA 247], 127, 350, 382.)
 
In
July 2017, the judgment was renewed for the total sum of $426,563.22. (AR
78-82, 125 [ROA 253], 127, 352-54, 382-83.) No additional payments have been
made toward satisfying the judgment. (AR 10 [¶ 12], 409:11-13 [petitioner
stipulated that judgment remains outstanding less credit of $50,000].) 
 
B.          
Evidence
Relevant to Rehabilitation
 
On
June 20, 2012, the DRE issued a broker license to petitioner. (AR 68.) Other
than the civil judgment discussed above, petitioner has not received any
complaints or been subject to disciplinary action from the DRE. (AR 68.) 
 
            Since the civil judgment, petitioner
has been active in her church. (AR 335.) Petitioner leads counseling groups at
retreats and church events, where she teaches about “justice, honesty, and
integrity.” (AR 335.) Petitioner’s church hired her to assist with its lease
contracts. (AR 335.) 
 
            Several of petitioner’s religious
and professional colleagues wrote letters supporting her character. (AR 333-42.)
Petitioner contends that at least five of these colleagues were aware of petitioner’s
civil liability. (AR 386:24-389:10.) Rosa Baltazar, a member of petitioner’s
church, remarked how petitioner “[g]ives everyone an equal opportunity” and
“treat[s] her clients…with respect, honesty, and
integrity.”
(AR 336.) Kay Wilson-Bolton, president of Real Estate Magic, Inc. and former
colleague of petitioner, wrote that petitioner was “one of the gems in the real
estate business with a stellar career as a business leader.” (AR 338.) Miguel
Guzman, who petitioner represented in the purchase of a house, described how petitioner
provided him with excellent service for over a year to help his family secure a
dream home. (AR 334.) Guzman, also a member of petitioner’s church, stated that
she was a “role model for others at church and in the community.” (AR 334.) 
 
            Petitioner has completed various
training programs and vocational courses related to real estate transactions.
In 2020, petitioner completed four consumer protection courses with Real Estate
Trainers, Inc. as part of her continuing education, covering subjects like real
estate red flags, real estate contracts, and disclosure obligations. (AR 347.) Petitioner
has successfully completed her Realtor Code of Ethics Training with the National
Association of Realtors. (AR 346, 348.)
            
Petitioner
has also completed various ethics and morals courses in her church, on subjects
like citizenship, charity, and integrity. (AR 383:12-384:21.)
 
C.          
Application
for Mortgage Loan Originator License Endorsement
 
In
2021, petitioner applied for a Mortgage Loan Originator (“MLO”) license
endorsement to help Latina families in underserved communities secure home ownership.
(AR 69, 71, 77, 410:23-411:14.) Petitioner disclosed the outstanding judgment.
(AR 74 [D], 76, 77.) In her sworn application, petitioner stated she had been
sued for a “real estate listing.” (AR 76-77.) Petitioner also stated: “[T]he
judgment was given to the DRE and the DRE paid my enemy $50,000, so DRE suspended
my license until I was able to pay the DRE back the $50,000.” (AR 76.)
 
D.          
Administrative
Proceedings
 
After
receiving petitioner’s application for an MLO endorsement, the DRE issued a
Statement of Issues finding cause to deny the application and requested a
hearing. (AR 51-55, 59-66.) Petitioner requested an evidentiary hearing. (AR
51-56, 58.)
 
On
July 13, 2022, an evidentiary hearing was held. (AR 5, 358-62.) The DRE’s
exhibits were received in evidence by stipulation. (AR 22, 26-330 [exhibits
1-7], 361, 363.) Most of petitioner’s exhibits were received in evidence
without limitation. (AR 22, 342-354 [exhibits B-D], 361, 379-85.) Petitioner’s
character reference letters (AR 333-341 [exhibit A],) however, were received in
evidence, but considered “as administrative hearsay.” (AR 23-24 and 379:6-17.) 
 
Petitioner
denied committing fraud. (AR 390:9-10 [“[Q]: Did you commit fraud?  THE WITNESS: No”].) When asked if she did
anything wrong, petitioner blamed the broker:
 
Q:        Did you do anything wrong in this case?
 
A:        No. 
I was following the instructions of the broker.  He was my broker.  It was my first listing.
 
(AR 390:12-14.)
 
When
asked about her claimed rehabilitation, petitioner took no responsibility for
what happened and instead faulted others and suggested she herself was a victim.
(AR 389.) 
 
Q:
       What are you rehabilitated from?
 
A:
       From -- from -- from the -- from
the -- I felt defrauded. I felt like -- like a child that -- that is lied to.
From -- from all the lies and deceit. And also it was very hard. And actually
it has been very hard. It’s been hindering my -- well, you know, my person for
a long time. 
 
(AR
389:16-22.) When again asked whether she had done anything wrong, petitioner
testified that she was “naïve” and “too trusting” and apologized “for that.”
(AR 406:10-407:12.)
 
On
August 3, 2022, Administrative Law Judge (“ALJ”) Eileen Cohn issued a proposed
decision denying petitioner’s application of an MLO license endorsement. (AR
5-16.) 
 
The
ALJ acknowledged that petitioner, as a then new mother, made payment to the DRE
Recovery Account “at great sacrifice to her and her young family.” (AR 10 [¶
12].) Montelongo, the broker, has never made any payment. (AR 10 [¶ 12].) The
ALJ acknowledged that petitioner’s real estate license has not been disciplined
by the DRE, petitioner’s act of fraud and conviction were in the “distant
past,” petitioner was the only defendant in the case to make restitution to the
DRE, petitioner has a stable family life, and petitioner was active in her
church and community. (AR 9-11 [summarizing mitigating and rehabilitation
evidence], 15 [¶ 10].)
 
Nevertheless,
the ALJ cited the civil case filed against petitioner as cause for denial. (AR
14 [¶ 7].) The proposed decision related that, given the stringent requirements
for an MLO license endorsement, and the attention to detail required for such
an endorsement, petitioner failed to provide sufficient evidence that the
public would be protected by giving her the endorsement. (AR 6.) Despite having
received certain evidence of rehabilitation, the ALJ ultimately concluded: “On
the other hand, the civil judgment established a degree of carelessness in real
estate transactions involving Spanish-speaking clients, the very clients
[petitioner] intends to serve.” (AR 15 [¶ 10].) 
The ALJ concluded as follows: 
 
[Petitioner’s]
evidence in mitigation and rehabilitation establishes her to be a trustworthy
and competent real estate broker, but her activities as a real estate broker
are segregated from the MLO, and given the circumstances of the civil judgment,
there is insufficient evidence the public, especially the Spanish-speaking
community she intends to serve, will be adequately protected by allowing her to
combine her skills as a broker with that of a MLO which requires an attention
to financial details.
 
(AR 15
[¶ 11].)
 
On
September 20, 2022, Douglas R. McCauley, the Real Estate Commissioner
(“Commissioner”), adopted the proposed decision, which became effective October
10, 2022. (AR 3-20.) The decision’s findings included, among other things, that:
(1) denial of the application was based on the fraud civil judgment; (2) the
judgment held petitioner jointly and severally liable for fraud; and (3) petitioner
was 29 years of age at the time of the transaction, which resulted in the civil
judgment against her. (AR 6-10.) 
 
On
October 6, 2022, the Commissioner denied petitioner’s petition for
reconsideration. (AR 1-2.)
 
II.      Procedural History
 
            On
November 7, 2022, petitioner Maria De Jesus Abundis filed a Verified Petition
for Writ of Mandate. On November 30, 2023, respondent California Department of
Real Estate, Douglas R. McCauley, Real Estate Commissioner filed an Answer.         On November 29, 2023, petitioner filed
an opening brief. On December 21, 2023, respondent filed an opposition. On
January 12, 2024, petitioner filed a reply.       The
Court has received the administrative record lodged by respondent. 


 
III.     Standard of Review
 
Under CCP § 1094.5(b), the pertinent issues are
whether the respondent has proceeded without jurisdiction, whether there was a
fair trial, and whether there was a prejudicial abuse of discretion. An abuse
of discretion is established if the agency has not proceeded in the manner
required by law, the decision is not supported by the findings, or the findings
are not supported by the evidence. (CCP § 1094.5(b).)
 
“An attempt to obtain a license to engage in a
profession or business does not involve a fundamental vested right.” (Harrington
v. Department of Real Estate (1989) 214 Cal.App.3d 394, 404.) “Where no
fundamental vested right is involved, the superior court’s review is limited to
examining the administrative record to determine whether the adjudicatory
decision and its findings are supported by substantial evidence in light of the
whole record.” (JKH Enterprises, Inc. v. Department of Industrial Relations
(2006) 142 Cal.App.4th 1046, 1057.) Because the administrative decision at
issue concerns the denial of a license, the Court reviews the DRE’s decision
for substantial evidence. 
 
Substantial evidence is “relevant evidence that a
reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion” (California
Youth Authority v. State Personnel Board (2002) 104 Cal.App.4th 575,
584-85), or evidence of ponderable legal significance which is reasonable,
credible and of solid value (Kuhn v. Department of General Services
(1994) 22 Cal.App.4th 1627, 1633). “Courts may reverse an [administrative]
decision only if, based on the evidence…a reasonable person could not reach the
conclusion reached by the agency.” (Sierra Club v. California Coastal Com.
(1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 602, 610.)
 
An agency is presumed to
have regularly performed its official duties. (Evid. Code § 664.) A reviewing
court “will not act as counsel for either party to an appeal and will not
assume the task of initiating and prosecuting a search of the record for any purpose
of discovering errors not pointed out in the briefs.” (Fox v. Erickson (1950) 99 Cal.App.2d 740, 742.) When an appellant
challenges “‘the sufficiency of the evidence, all material evidence on the
point must be set forth and not merely their own evidence.’ [Citation.]” (Toigo
v. Town of Ross (1998) 70 Cal.App.4th 309, 317.)  
 
“On questions of law
arising in mandate proceedings, [the Court] exercise[s] independent judgment.’”
(Christensen v. Lightbourne (2017) 15
Cal.App.5th 1239, 1251.) The interpretation of statute or regulation is a
question of law. (See State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Quackenbush
(1999) 77 Cal.App.4th 65, 71.) 


IV.     Analysis
 
A.          
Law
Applicable to MLO License Endorsements
 
Mortgage
loan originators are individuals “who take[] a residential mortgage loan
application or offers or negotiates terms of a residential mortgage loan for
compensation or gain.” (Bus. & Prof. Code § 10166.01(b)(1).)[2]
A real estate salesperson may not engage in business as an MLO without obtaining
and maintaining an MLO license endorsement. (§ 10166.02(b)(2).) 
 
The
DRE administers the MLO license endorsement. (§ 10151(e).) The Commissioner “has
full power to regulate and control the issuance…all licenses to be issued….” (§
10071.) “Protection of the public shall be the highest priority for the
Department of Real Estate in exercising its licensing, regulatory, and
disciplinary functions. Whenever the protection of the public is inconsistent
with other interests sought to be promoted, the protection of the public shall
be paramount.” (§ 10050.1.) 
 
The
Commissioner shall not issue an MLO endorsement unless the Commissioner finds
that the applicant “has demonstrated such financial responsibility, character,
and general fitness as to command the confidence of the community and warrant a
determination that the mortgage loan originator will operate honestly, fairly,
and efficiently….” (§ 10166.05(c).) This finding required of the Commissioner “relates
to any matter, personal or professional, that may impact upon an applicant's
propensity to operate honestly, fairly, and efficiently when engaging in the
fiduciary role” of an MLO. (10 C.C.R. § 2758.3.) If an applicant’s personal
history includes any judgments for fraud, misrepresentation, or dishonest
dealing, the applicant “may” be precluded from obtaining an MLO endorsement. (Id.
§ 2758.3(a)(1).) 
 
The
DRE is required to consider whether an applicant has made a showing of
rehabilitation. (§ 482.) The following factors are relevant to the instant
proceeding and considered in determining whether an applicant is rehabilitated
for purposes of issuing a license are:
 

The time that has passed since commission of
     the wrongful act
Restitution to persons who suffered monetary
     damages through substantially related wrongful acts
Stability of family life and fulfilment of
     family responsibilities
Completion of training courses for economic
     self-improvement
Bona fide efforts toward discharging monetary
     obligations to others
Correction of business practices resulting in
     injury to others
Significant involvement in community or church
     programs designed to provide social benefits
New and different social and business
     relationships from that which existed at the time of the wrongful act
Change in attitude from that which existed at
     the time of the wrongful act

 
(10
C.C.R. § 2911.) 
 
The
applicant for a license has the burden of proof in application proceedings. (Martin
v. Alcoholic Beverage Control Appeals Bd. of Cal. (1959) 52 Cal.2d 259, 265.)
“[T]he more serious the misconduct and the bad character evidence, the stronger
the applicant's showing of rehabilitation must be.” (In re Gossage
(2000) 23 Cal.4th 1080, 1096.)
 
B.          
Merits
 
Petitioner
was found liable for fraud in a civil action. (AR 8, 146-47 [¶ 12], 159, 131-32.)
Under Business and Professions Code § 2758.3(a)(1), petitioner may be precluded
from obtaining an MLO license endorsement. 
 
            Petitioner contends that the
licensing requirements for a real estate license are analogous to the MLO
requirements. Business and Professions Code § 10177(j) allows the Commissioner
to deny a real estate license to an applicant if the applicant engaged in fraud
or dishonest dealing. (§ 10177(j).) According to petitioner, the DRE cannot
claim that petitioner satisfies the requirements of a salesperson or broker
license, but not an MLO license endorsement. (AR 68.) However, the requirements
to obtain a non-MLO related license are not at issue here. The Court’s analysis
here is whether, under the statutes pertaining to the MLO license endorsement, substantial
evidence supports the findings and decision of the ALJ. 
 
Petitioner
maintains that she has rehabilitated. However, petitioner did not make a sufficient
showing that her attitude has changed since entry of the civil judgment against
her. (10 C.C.R. § 2911(14).) “Fully acknowledging the wrongfulness of [one’s] actions
is an essential step towards rehabilitation.” (Seide v. Committee of Bar
Examiners (1989) 49 Cal.3d 933, 940.) In petitioner’s application for an
MLO license endorsement, she referred to the plaintiffs in whose favor the
civil judgment was entered as “my enemy.” (AR 76, 130-32.) Further, during the
administrative hearing, instead of admitting any responsibility, petitioner
blamed the broker and denied committing fraud. (AR 390:9-10, 390:12-14.) During
the hearing, petitioner admitted speaking to the sellers and preparing
paperwork for the transaction. (AR 400, 404-05.) This is significant in that plaintiffs
in the civil fraud action alleged they entered into the transaction under the
belief their mortgage payments would decrease by “follow[ing] the instructions
and advice of [petitioner].” (AR 147.)
 
The
contrition petitioner expressed during the administrative hearing was her
apology for being naïve and too trusting. (AR 406:10-407:12.) That is neither
an apology nor acknowledgment of her conduct. 
It certainly does not address the civil plaintiffs’ claims of fraud,
namely, that the defendants, including petitioner, had represented to the sellers
that their loan payments would be reduced if they sold their home to a “straw
man.” (AR 146-47 [¶12].) Petitioner cannot be said to have fully acknowledged
the wrongfulness of her actions leading to the civil judgment. 
 
Moreover,
petitioner has not demonstrated that she has made any bona fide attempts to
make payments to satisfy the judgment. (AR 10 [¶ 12], 409:11-13; 10 C.C.R. §
2911(a)(2), (a)(10).) She made the required $50,400 payment to reverse the
suspension of her salesperson license. (AR 8-9, 68, 76, 123 [ROA 239], 409:2-7.)
Even though the broker with whom she was affiliated has not made any payment of
the judgment, petitioner remains jointly and severally liable under the
judgment. (AR 130-32.) Petitioner has not demonstrated that she is incapable of
making even minimal installment payments to further satisfy the judgment. Further,
the timing and amount of petitioner’s partial satisfaction of the judgment is
as consistent with her self-interest in obtaining her suspended license as it
is with rehabilitation and making amends for her actions.
 
            With respect to the other factors
listed in the section above, the Court recognizes the evidence discussed in
section I.B above could weigh in favor of a finding that petitioner has
rehabilitated. Indeed, the ALJ also found that petitioner had provided
“compelling evidence in mitigation and rehabilitation.” (AR 6.) Even crediting
such evidence, however, full acknowledgment of the wrongfulness of the acts
leading to the civil judgment is “essential” toward rehabilitation. (Seide, 49
Cal.3d at 940.) For the reasons stated above, petitioner has failed to fully
acknowledge any wrongdoing. Accordingly, applying the “substantial evidence”
standard of review, a reasonable person could find, as the ALJ did, that the
civil judgment against petitioner evidences a carelessness and inattention to
financial details that could harm the public, especially the Spanish-speaking
community petitioner intends to serve, should the DRE approve an MLO license
endorsement. (AR 15 [¶¶ 10, 11].) 
 
            Because substantial evidence
supports the denial of petitioner’s application for an MLO license endorsement,
this Court does not disturb the decision. 
(Northern Inyo Hospital v. Fari Employment Practices Comm’n
(1974) 38 Cal.App.3d 14, 24 [under substantial evidence standard, trial court
may not disregard or overturn the agency finding “for the reasons that it is
considered that a contrary finding would have been equally or more
reasonable”].)


V.      Conclusion
 
The petition for writ of mandate is DENIED.
Pursuant to Local Rule 3.231(n), respondent California Department of Real
Estate, Douglas R. McCauley, Real Estate Commissioner shall prepare, serve, and
ultimately file a proposed judgment.
