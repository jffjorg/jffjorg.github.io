Case No. 20STCP03035
 
[TENTATIVE] RULING ON MOTION FOR AWARD OF
  ATTORNEY FEES
 
Dept. 82 (Hon. Curtis A. Kin)




 
CALIFORNIA FISH AND GAME COMMISSION,
 
 
 


 
 
 
 
Respondent.
 


 


 

 



 


 


 


 

 


Petitioner
Ballona Wetlands Land Trust moves for an award of attorney fees in the amount
of $344,160.25. 
 
I.       Background
 
On
October 13, 2022, petitioner Ballona Wetlands Land Trust filed the operative
verified first amended verified petition for writ of mandate. On September 7,
2023, the hearing on the petition took place, after which the Court took the
matter under submission. On September 8, 2023, the Court granted the petition. 
 
On
November 3, 2023, the Court entered judgment in favor of petitioner. On
November 7, 2023, the Court issued a writ of mandate directing respondent
California Fish and Game Commission (“Commission”) to make a compatibility
determination pursuant to Section 630 of Title 14 of the Cal. Code of
Regulations as to whether the parking lots in Area A and baseball fields in
Area C of the Ballona Wetlands Ecological Reserve are compatible with the
purpose of the Reserve. (See 14 C.C.R. § 630(a) [“Visitor uses are dependent
upon the provisions of applicable laws and upon a determination by the
commission that opening an area to such visitor use is compatible with the
purposes of the property”].) 
 
II.      Analysis
 
A.          
Entitlement
to Fees under Code of Civil Procedure § 1021.5
Petitioner seeks an award of attorney fees pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure § 1021.5. “Upon motion, a court may award attorneys’
fees to a successful party against one or more opposing parties in any action
which has resulted in the enforcement of an important right affecting the
public interest….” (CCP § 1021.5.) “[E]ligibility for section 1021.5 attorney
fees is established when ‘(1) plaintiffs’ action “has resulted in the enforcement
of an important right affecting the public interest,” (2) “a significant
benefit, whether pecuniary or nonpecuniary has been conferred on the general
public or a large class of persons” and (3) “the necessity and financial burden
of private enforcement are such as to make the award appropriate.”’” (Conservatorship
of Whitley (2010) 50 Cal.4th 1206, 1214.)
 
1.           
Successful Party
 
A party “may be
considered successful if they succeed on any significant issue in the
litigation that achieves some of the benefit they sought in bringing suit.” (Ebbetts
Pass Forest Watch v. Department of Forestry & Fire Protection (2010)
187 Cal.App.4th 376, 382.) In determining whether the issue upon which a party
prevailed is significant, “the court must critically analyze the surrounding
circumstances of the litigation and pragmatically assess the gains achieved by
the action.” (Ibid.)
 
Here, petitioner
succeeded in obtaining a writ directing the Commission to make an express and
affirmative determination regarding whether parking lots and a little league
field located on the Ballona Wetlands Ecological Reserve is compatible with the
purpose of the Reserve. (11/7/23 Writ of Mandate; compare FAP Prayer for
Relief at (iii).) Because petitioner prevailed on a significant issue
in the litigation, petitioner is the successful party under section 1021.5. The
Commission does not argue otherwise.
 
2.           
Enforcement of Important
Right Affecting the Public Interest
 
“In assessing whether an
action has enforced an important right, courts should generally realistically
assess the significance of that right in terms of its relationship to the
achievement of fundamental legislative goals. As to the benefit, it may be conceptual
or doctrinal and need not be actual and concrete; further, the effectuation of
a statutory or constitutional purpose may be sufficient ... [However,] [t]he
benefit must inure primarily to the public. Thus, the statute directs the
judiciary to exercise judgment in attempting to ascertain the ‘strength’ or
‘societal importance’ of the right involved.” (Sandlin v. McLaughlin
(2020) 50 Cal.App.5th 805, 829, quoting Choi v. Orange County Great Park
Corp. (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 524, 531, internal quotations and citations
omitted.) 
 
The subject of the instant proceeding, the Ballona
Wetlands Ecological Reserve, is “land or land and water areas…that are to be
preserved in a natural condition, or which are to be provided some level of
protection as determined by the commission, for the benefit of the general
public to observe native flora and fauna and for scientific study or research.”
(Fish & G. Code § 1584; 14 C.C.R. § 630(b)(10) [Ballona Wetlands designated
as ecological reserve by Commission].) Moreover, it is undisputed that the State
of California purchased the Reserve with $139 million in public bond funds.
(Lamb Decl. ¶ 5.) Requiring the Commission to make a compatibility
determination concerning potentially incompatible uses in the Reserve, which
could potentially result in restoration of the land, furthers the significant
policy set forth in Fish and Game Code § 1584. (14 C.C.R. § 630(h)(3)
[providing that Commission may allow recreation use unless it determines that
restoration or other uses are more appropriate]; La Mirada Avenue
Neighborhood Assn. of Hollywood v. City of Los Angeles (2018) 22
Cal.App.5th 1149, 1158 [“Where, as here, the nonpecuniary benefit to the public
is the proper enforcement of the law, the successful party must show that the
law being enforced furthers a significant policy”].) 
 
Citing Center for Biological Diversity v.
California Fish & Game Com. (2011) 195 Cal.App.4th 128 and Karuk
Tribe of Northern California v. California Regional Water Quality Control Bd.,
North Coast Region (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 330, respondent contends that the
writ of mandate does not compel any finding that the parking lots and baseball
field are incompatible with the Reserve. (Opp. at 9:16-10:12.) Both cases are
distinguishable. The petitioners in those cases only received remands for new
hearings, which was not the relief they sought. 
 
In Center for Biological Diversity, all the
petitioner obtained was a “limited ‘do-over’”: “The trial court did not decide
that the Commission had actually used the wrong standard, only that there was
an appreciable risk that it may have erroneously evaluated the petition…. [T]he
court did not accede to the Center's prayer that its petition to the Commission
deserved to prevail as a matter of law, i.e., by overturning the Commission's
finding that the Center had not produced sufficient evidence. This was the
Center's ‘strategic objective.’… [¶] When the Commission reviewed the petition
for the second time, it reached the same conclusion as it had before.” (Center
for Biological Diversity, 195 Cal.App.4th at 140-141.)
 
In Karuk, the trial court remanded a matter
to the agency to provide an “augmented explanation” of its decision that a
state law was preempted by federal law. (Karuk, 183 Cal.App.4th at 364,
369.) However, the plaintiffs did not seek such relief: “The only
relief/achievement/success from this litigation was the remand to the Board.
However…it certainly was not sought by plaintiffs, but was engineered by the
trial court for its own reasons. Nowhere in plaintiffs’ petition is there a
hint that they wanted a fuller explanation from the Board supporting its
conclusion that it was powerless against the [Federal Power Act].” (Id.
at 366.) “Providing that augmented explanation does not, as the trial court
concluded, qualify as a ‘significant benefit’ worth $138,000 to the people of
California.” (Id. at 369.)
 
Contrary to Center for Biological Diversity
and Karuk, petitioner’s central contention in the operative First
Amended Petition was that respondent had not complied with its regulatory
obligation to make a compatibility determination. (FAP ¶¶ 1, 22, 30, 34, 35,
39, 46, 54, 55, 57.) Petitioner’s prayer for relief seeks such a determination.
(FAP Prayer for Relief at (iii).) Accordingly, petitioner’s enforcement of 14
C.C.R. § 630(a) affects an important right, specifically the public’s right to
have the Commission conduct itself in a manner that makes sure the biological
resources in and around the publicly funded Reserve are protected.. 
 
3.           
Significant Benefit
Conferred on General Public or Large Class of Persons
 
“Whether a successful
party’s lawsuit confers a ‘significant benefit’ on the general public or a
large class of persons is a function of (1) ‘the significance of the benefit,’
and (2) ‘the size of the class receiving [the] benefit.’ [Citation.] In evaluating
these factors, courts are to ‘realistic[ally] assess[ ]’ the lawsuit’s ‘gains’
‘in light of all the pertinent circumstances.’ [Citation.]” (La Mirada, 22
Cal.App.5th at 1158.) “A benefit need not be monetary to be significant. (§
1021.5 [defining “a significant benefit” as either “pecuniary or
nonpecuinary”].) Where, as here, the nonpecuniary benefit to the public is the
proper enforcement of the law, the successful party must show that the law
being enforced furthers a significant policy. [Citation.]” (La Mirada,
22 Cal.App.5th at 1158.) 
 
“[T]he significant
benefit requirement of section 1021.5 requires more than a mere statutory
violation.” (Burgess v. Coronado Unified School District (2020) 59
Cal.App.5th 1, 9.) However, a significant benefit can be found “simply from the
effectuation of a fundamental constitutional or statutory policy” “from a
realistic assessment, in light of all the pertinent circumstances, of the gains
which have resulted in a particular case.” (Woodland Hills Residents Assn.,
Inc. v. City Council (1979) 23 Cal.3d 917, 939-40.)
 
For the reasons stated
above with respect to enforcement of an important right, petitioner
demonstrates that a significant benefit was conferred on the general public. (La
Mirada, 22 Cal.App.5th at 1158 [finding when proper enforcement of law is
the public benefit, “the significant benefit and important right requirements
of section 1021.5 to some extent dovetail”].) The policy of protecting the
Reserve for the benefit of the general public is set forth in Fish
and Game Code § 1584. By enforcing 14 C.C.R. § 630(a), petitioner effectuated
regulatory policy by ensuring that the Reserve is being used for purposes that
are compatible with the purpose of the Reserve. (See Health Net of
California, Inc. v. Department of Health Services (2003) 113 Cal.App.4th
224, 235 [treating regulatory violation as violation of statute because
“regulations, by definition, are rules, orders, and standards of general
application that ‘implement, interpret, or make specific’ the statutory law”].)
 
4.           
Necessity and Financial
Burden of Private Enforcement
 
“[T]he necessity and
financial burden requirement really examines two issues: whether private
enforcement was necessary and whether the financial burden of private
enforcement warrants subsidizing the successful party’s attorneys.” (Whitley,
50 Cal.4th at 1214.) 
 
Private enforcement was
necessary in this case because the petitioner brought the action against the
government agency responsible for making a compatibility determination
regarding the parking lots and baseball field at the Reserve. (See Woodland
Hills Residents Assn., Inc. v. City Council (1979) 23 Cal.3d 917, 941
[“Inasmuch as the present action proceeded against the only governmental
agencies that bear responsibility for the subdivision approval process, the
necessity of private, as compared to public, enforcement becomes clear”].)
Further, the financial burden of private enforcement warrants a fee award here,
as petitioner did not obtain any financial relief from the judgment. (See
Whitley, 50 Cal.4th at 1217 [“As a logical matter, a strong nonfinancial
motivation does not change or alleviate the ‘financial burden’ that a litigant
bears”].) 
 
Respondents do not argue
that private enforcement by petitioner was unnecessary or did not pose a
financial burden. For the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that the necessity
and financial burden of private enforcement by petitioner warrants a fee award
under CCP § 1021.5. 
 
B.          
Reasonableness
of Fees Requested
Petitioner seeks $344,160.25
in fees, based on the sum of the asserted lodestar of $193,293.50, application
of a 1.5 multiplier resulting in $96,646.75, and $54,220.00 for preparation of
the fee motion. 
 
1.           
The Lodestar Amount
 
With respect to the fees
incurred in obtaining a favorable judgment, petitioner seeks a total of $193,293.50,

The Court finds the
asserted hourly rates are reasonable, and respondent does not contend
otherwise.
 
The Court finds that the $24,413.50
in fees claimed by Venskus & Associates, A.P.C. are excessive. “Entitlement
to fees under [section] 1021.5 is based on the impact of the case as a whole.”
(Karuk, quoting Punsly v. Ho (2003) 105 Cal.App.4th 102, 114, cleaned
up.) Considering that the bulk of the work was performed by the Mitchell M.
Tsai Law Firm, the Venskus firm does not make a sufficient showing that their
work was instrumental in obtaining the writ relief sought by petitioner. Attorney
Venskus states in a conclusory manner that the Venskus firm “contributed to the
successful outcome of the litigation by formulating legal strategies, drafting
and serving the initial petition, conducting legal research, and appearing at hearings.”
(Venskus Decl. ¶ 9.) Aside from drafting the initial writ petition, serving the
petition, and providing notice to the Attorney General, the Venskus firm did
not impact the case as a whole. The Court awards the Venskus firm fees for 6
hours for drafting the petition, 0.2 hours for serving the petition, and 0.2
hours for drafting notice to the Attorney General. Based on a blended rate of $675.00
per hour (($1000 Venskus + $850 Sanders + $650 Andrews + $200 paralegal) ÷ 4 =
$675 per hour), the Venskus firm is awarded fees in the amount of $4,320.00
($675 x 6.4 hours). 
 
With respect to the fees
claimed by attorneys from the Mitchell M. Tsai Law Firm, the Court finds that
certain fees were excessive.  With
counsel’s experience as reflected in the relatively high billing rates, counsel
should have spent less time performing the tasks set forth in the time records.  Further, the reductions account for inefficiencies
and waste resulting from two or more attorneys unnecessarily working on the
same briefing and tasks. 
 
The Court reduces the billing entries as reflected
in the following table:

TOTAL:

Based on the foregoing, the Court finds that
petitioner is entitled to the lodestar amount of $118,000 ($4,320
Venskus + $113,680 Tsai).
 
2.           
Requests for Multiplier
 
            Petitioner
also seeks a 1.5 multiplier of the lodestar amount. Courts look to the
following factors, among others, in determining whether a multiplier is
appropriate: “(1) the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, and the
skill displayed in presenting them; (2) the extent to which the nature of the
litigation precluded other employment by the attorneys; (3) the contingent
nature of the fee award, both from the point of view of eventual victory on the
merits and the point of view of establishing eligibility for an award; (4) the
fact that an award against the state would ultimately fall upon the taxpayers
….” (See Serrano v. Priest (1977) 20 Cal.3d 25, 48.)
 
Here,
the Court finds that the requested 1.5 multiplier is not warranted. Even if 14
C.C.R. § 630 was not the subject of case law, the resolution of this case
required a straightforward review of the record to determine whether the
parking lots and baseball field were ever the subject of a compatibility
determination. Although counsel represented petitioner on a partial contingency
basis, the Court finds that the substantial lodestar award as set forth above
sufficiently compensates counsel for their efforts. (Weeks v. Baker &
McKenzie (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1176.) 

 
Regardless of any budget deficit,[1] the
Commission’s repeated denials of petitioner’s request for a compatibility
determination, as discussed in the Court’s 9/8/23 Ruling on the First Amended
Petition for Writ of Mandate, warrants against imposition of a negative
multiplier. (See Rogel v. Lynwood Redevelopment Agency (2011) 194
Cal.App.4th 1319, 1331, quoting Horsford v. Board of Trustees of California
State University (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 359, 400-01 [taxpayer burden should
not be considered where a governmental entity “chooses to defend its conduct
through lengthy and complex litigation”].)
 
3.           
Fees on Fees
 
With respect to the fees
incurred in obtaining fees, petitioner seeks a total of $54,220, calculated as follows:

The
Court finds that the hours claimed for the fee motion are excessive.
Considering attorney Tsai’s averment that Mitchell M. Tsai Law Firm “almost
entirely works on public-interest environmental litigation” (Tsai Decl. ¶ 6),
this routine fee motion should not have taken as many hours as claimed by
counsel. 
 
In
the opposition, respondent suggested that petitioner be awarded fees based on 8
hours for the motion, 4 hours for the reply, and 3 hours for attending the
hearing, a total of 15 hours. (Opp. at 18:14-16.) The Court finds respondent’s
suggestion is reasonable. 


 
Petitioner’s
counsel calculated the blended hourly rate as $625 per hour. (Tsai Decl. ¶ 23.)
Counsel does not explain how this rate was calculated. The Court calculates the
blended rate to be $525 per hour ([$800 Tsai + $650 Soghbatyan + $450 Nimmer +
$200 paralegal] ÷ 4 = $525 per hour).
 
Accordingly,
petitioner is awarded $7,875 for the fee motion (15 hours x $525/hour
blended rate). 
 
III.     Conclusion
 
The motion is GRANTED IN PART. Using the appropriate lodestar approach, and
based on the foregoing findings and in view of the totality of the
circumstances, the total and reasonable amount of attorney fees incurred for
the work performed in connection with the writ petition is $125,875 ($4,320 Venskus + $113,680 Tsai + $7,875
fee motion). Such fees are awarded
to petitioner Ballona Wetlands Land Trust and against respondent California
Fish and Game Commission.
