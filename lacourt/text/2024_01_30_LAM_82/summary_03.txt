And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration of the court's previous order compelling arbitration. The court found that the motion was untimely, as it was filed over two years after the original order was issued. The court also found that the plaintiffs had not proceeded with arbitration and instead had engaged in dilatory tactics. The court noted that the plaintiffs' claims arise out of the defendant's express written warranty, not the sale contract, and therefore are not subject to arbitration. The court cited several California appellate court decisions, including Ford Motor Warranty Cases, which held that equitable estoppel does not permit the manufacturer to compel arbitration based on provisions in the sale contract regarding claims arising out of the condition of the vehicle. The court concluded that the plaintiffs' claims are not subject to arbitration and denied the defendant's motion to compel arbitration. The stay in the matter is lifted, and further proceedings will be scheduled.
