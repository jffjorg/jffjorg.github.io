And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the petitions to confirm minor's compromise of disputed claim as to minor claimants Gianni Jackson and Kenzo Jackson. The court finds that the proposed settlement is fair and reasonable, but notes several deficiencies in the petitions. Specifically, the petitions are missing Attachment 11b(6) and a copy of the notice and proof of delivery to the Director of Health Care Services. The court orders the plaintiff to submit a declaration of counsel in satisfaction of the requirements set forth in Item 13(a), including discussion of California Rules of Court Rule 7.955(b) and reason for the different percentages. The court also orders the plaintiff to submit Attachment 11b(6) and a copy of the notice and proof of delivery to the Director of Health Care Services. The petitions are continued to October 29, 2024, at 10:00 a.m. in Department 25 of the Spring Street Courthouse, to allow the plaintiff to address the deficiencies.
