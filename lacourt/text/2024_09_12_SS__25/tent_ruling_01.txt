Code §§ 3500(d), 3505, 3601(a))    I.                     BACKGROUND  On December 11, 2023, Alexandra Myles, mother of  Gianni Jackson and Kenzo Jackson (“Plaintiff”), filed her Complaint against Defendant  Cindy Diaz Roman (“Defendant”) for motor vehicle and general negligence arising  from a car incident on October 26, 2022.  On December 15, 2023, the Court granted Plaintiff’s  applications and orders for appointment of guardian ad litem of Gianni Jackson  and Kenzo Jackson.  On July 17, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant  petitions to approve compromise of disputed claim as to minor claimants Gianni  Jackson and Kenzo Jackson (“Claimants”). The petition is unopposed.  II.                  LEGAL STANDARD             “A  parent having the right to compromise the disputed claim of the minor under  this section may execute a full release and satisfaction or execute a covenant  not to sue on or a covenant not to enforce judgment on the disputed claim,  after the money or other property to be paid or delivered has been paid or  delivered as provided in subdivision (c). If the court orders that all or any  part of the money to be paid under the compromise or covenant be deposited in  an insured account in a financial institution in this state, or in a  single-premium deferred annuity, the release and satisfaction or covenant is  not effective for any purpose until the money has been deposited as directed in  the order of the court.” (Prob. Code, § 3500(d).)  “The court shall schedule a  hearing on a petition for compromise of a minor’s disputed claim pursuant to  Section 3500 within 30 days from the date of filing. If the petition is  unopposed, the court shall issue a decision on the petition at the conclusion  of the hearing.” (Prob. Code, § 3505.)  “The court making the order or  giving the judgment referred to in Section 3600, as a part thereof, shall make  a further order authorizing and directing that reasonable expenses, medical or  otherwise and including reimbursement to a parent, guardian, or conservator,  costs, and attorney’s fees, as the court shall approve and allow therein, shall  be paid from the money or other property to be paid or delivered for the  benefit of the minor or person with a disability.” (Prob. Code, § 3601(a).) III.               DISCUSSION According to both petitions, Claimants suffered personal injuries—body  aches, neck and back pain—from the subject car incident and sought medical  treatment for their injuries. Claimants have recovered completely from the  effects of their injuries.   The petition concerning Gianni Jackson seeks approval of a $3,000  prelitigation compromise of claim from Defendant. Of the settlement amount,  $1,000 will go to medical expenses, $810 will go to attorney’s fees and $186.12  will go to costs. The balance of the proceeds ($1,003.88) will be deposited in  an insured account at Bank of America, subject to withdrawal only on  authorization of the court.    The petition concerning Kenzo Jackson seeks approval of a $4,900  prelitigation compromise of claim from Defendant. Of the settlement amount,  $760 will go to medical expenses, $1,225 will go to attorney’s fees and $186.12  will go to costs. The balance of the proceeds ($2,728.99) will be deposited in  an insured account at Bank of America, subject to withdrawal only on  authorization of the court.   Here, as to each petition, Petitioner submits the  required forms—MC-350, MC-351, and MC-355—each fully completed. The Court has reviewed the proposed settlement and finds  that it is fair and reasonable. Further, the requested attorney’s fees, which  amounts to 27% and 25% for Gianni and Kenzo respectively, is fair and  reasonable. Counsel provides a copy of the retainer agreement and a declaration  explaining that the agreement details higher fees. The declaration of  Alexzandria Myles provides that the fee agreement is fair since there was a  reduction from $1000 to $810. However, the Declaration of counsel does not  discuss why the fee arrangements are different.    The net balance of the settlement proceeds going  to Gianni and Kenzo is $1,003.88 and 2,728.99, respectively. (Petition, Item  15.) The proceeds will be deposited in an insured account in Bank of America,  subject to withdrawal only on authorization of the Court. (Petition, Item 18b(2).)  Bank of America’s information is detailed in Attachment 18b(3). (Petition,  Attachment 18b(2).) The contractual lien and amount agreed upon with Nwude  Chiropractic, Inc. is attached to both petitions. However, both petitions are  missing attachment 11b(6). Instead, there are two Attachment 11b(5), but  neither includes the content that is supposed to be in Attachment 11b(6), which  is the reason for the apportionment of the settlement payments. Further, both  petitions purport that notice of the claim has been given to the Director of  Health Care Services, and a copy of the notice and proof of delivery was filed  in this case on June 19, 2024 as to Gianni’s petition while it is attached to Kenzo’s  petition. However, the Court cannot locate such for either petition.  Therefore, both petitions are continued so that Petitioner may submit  the following:  (1)   a declaration of counsel in satisfaction of  the requirements set forth in Item 13(a), including discussion of California  Rules of Court Rule 7.955(b) and reason for the different percentages;  (2)   Attachment 11b(6); and  (3)   a copy of the notice and proof of delivery to  the Director of Health Care Services.   CONCLUSION   Accordingly, Petition  to Confirm Minor’s Compromise as to minor Claimant Gianni Jackson and Petition to Confirm Minor’s Compromise as  to minor Claimant Kenzo Jackson are CONTINUED to OCTOBER 29, 2024 at 10:00  a.m. in Department 25 of the Spring Street Courthouse, to allow Petitioners to  address the deficiencies identified by the Court and stated  above.     At least ten (10) court days before the next scheduled hearing,  Plaintiffs/Petitioners must serve and electronically file supplemental papers  addressing the errors discussed herein.   Failure to do so may result in the Application being placed off calendar  and/or denied.   Moving party is ordered to give notice.
