  Case Number:  22TRCV01211    Hearing Date:   June 7, 2024    Dept:  B BARBARA HILL vs CITY OF LOS ANGELES
Case. No. 22TRCV01211
Ex Parte Request to Continue Trial (Stipulation)
This lawsuit was commenced by Plaintiff Barbara Hill on
November 10, 2022.  She alleges that on
August 6, 2021 she was seriously injured at the Defendant’s property as
defendant “negligently and carelessly owned, occupied, maintained, inspected,
supervised, controlled, managed, cleaned, use, repaired, directed and
superintended the above-described premises so as to cause Plaintiff Barbara
Hill to slip and fall when she came into contact with a dangerous condition on
the subject property.”
On April 24, 2023 the Court conducted its Case Management
Conference.  At that time it set the Final
Status Conference in this case for September 18, 2024, with the jury trial to
commence September 25, 2024.  The Court
also set a Post-Mediation Status Conference for February 15, 2024.  (The Post-Mediation Status Conference was
continued by the Court to February 29, 2024.) 
On February 28, 2024 Plaintiff’s counsel filed a Declaration stating:
“Due to mediator availability a
mediation has been scheduled on 02/13/2024 for 5/3/2024 at 10:00 AM with Mr.
Edward Fernandez, Esq.”
The declaration asked for an extension of the MSC to a date
after 5/3/2024.  At the hearing on
February 29, 2024 the Court indicated that all future dates remained.
On June 5, 2024 a “Ex Parte Application for an Order to
Continue Trial and All Trial Related Dates; Declaration Of Moreen K. Mekha” was
filed. The parties are requesting that the Court continue the current trial
date of September 25, 2024 to January 25, 2025.  Among other things, the Ex Parte Application
states:
“1. Discovery has just begun and
the Parties have yet to take any depositions.
2. This is the first trial
continuance requested by the Parties.
3. The Parties wish to mediate this
matter and believe that this matter may resolve if the Parties are given time
to mediate and discuss settlement.  As
such, the Parties are working to schedule mediation.”  (Ex Parte Notice pg. 2:3-6.)
The parties note that this Court “has broad discretion to
determine whether good cause exists for the purposes of granting a motion for
continuance of trial”  (Ex Parte pg.
2:22-24.)
“A consideration of the above
factors in conjunction with the circumstances in which all the Parties currently
find themselves, demonstrates that this Court has good cause to continue trial.
 As explained herein, it is imperative
that the trial date be continued; otherwise the Parties will be prejudiced by
not having the opportunity to engage in meaningful discovery.  Moreover, the Parties are firmly intent on
resolving this matter either informally or through a mediator.  As mentioned above, a stipulation executed by
all Parties has been filed with this Court.” 
(Ex Parte pg. 2:28-3:5.)
The parties obtained their trial date in this slip-and-fall
case in April 2023.  The Court set a POST-Mediation
Status Conference for February 29, 2024. 
(Post means “after.”)  No
mediation had taken place by that date. 
The parties had waited until mid-February to schedule a mediation with
the mediation to take place on May 3, 2024. 
The Court reminded the parties at that February hearing that the other dates
remained on calendar.
Now, the parties seek to delay this case for an additional 3
months, having failed to conduct their mediation, and failed to conduct any deposition
discovery.  This Court reminds counsel
that their professional obligations include the obligation to prepare their
case in a timely manner for trial.  They
must determine the discovery that they need, the settlement efforts that they
shall undertake, and the timeline for completing that and all other appropriate
tasks.  All of this must be completed
between the time the case is commenced and the trial date.  The Court intends to confer with counsel to
establish dates for the parties to complete the remaining tasks so that they
are prepared for their September 25, 2024 trial.
The Court expects counsel to take the field on game day –
September 25, 2024.
Ex Parte DENIED.
