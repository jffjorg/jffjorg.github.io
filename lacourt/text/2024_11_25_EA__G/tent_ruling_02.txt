 Case Number:  24PSCV00548    Hearing Date:   November 25, 2024    Dept:  G Defendant PHH Mortgage Corporation’s Motion to Dismiss
Action With Prejudice
Respondent: NO OPPOSITION
TENTATIVE RULING
Defendant PHH Mortgage Corporation’s Motion to Dismiss
Action With Prejudice is GRANTED.
BACKGROUND
This
is an action to quiet title. In November 1987, Plaintiffs Shelia Crigler and
William Crigler purchased a property in Pomona. To finance their purchase, they
obtained a secured loan and subsequently mortgaged the Pomona property for
additional funds. In October 2018, they executed a quitclaim deed to convey
their ownership to the Family Trust of William Robert Crigler and Shelia Vera
Crigler. After William Crigler passed away in 2018, Plaintiff Kyndle Crigler
assumed the mortgage payments. In 2022, the Criglers applied for and were
placed on a payment plan by Defendant PHH Mortgage Corporation (PHH). In April
2023, PHH removed the Criglers from the repayment plan after they allegedly
failed to timely pay property charge expenses. While the Criglers allege they
attempted to make payment towards the amount demanded by PHH, PHH proceeded
with nonjudicial foreclosure proceedings. On December 4, 2023, Defendant
Breckenridge Property Fund 2016, LLC (Breckenridge) purchased the Pomona
property at a foreclosure auction.
On
February 21, 2024, the Criglers filed a complaint against Breckenridge, First
American Title Insurance Company (First American), PHH, and Does 1-20, alleging
the following causes of action: (1) quiet title, (2) cancellation of written
instrument, (3) wrongful foreclosure, (4) declaratory relief, (5) slander of
title, and (6) negligent misrepresentation. On May 13, 2024, the court
sustained a demurrer to the Complaint by Breckenridge.
On
June 3, 2024, the Criglers filed a First Amended Complaint (FAC) against the
same defendants alleging the same causes of action. On August 28, 2024, the
court sustained a demurrer to the FAC by Breckenridge without leave to amend
and a demurrer to the FAC by PHH with thirty days leave to amend.
On
October 8, 2024, the court granted the Criglers’ ex parte application to extend
the deadline for leave to amend to October 15, 2024.
On
October 16, 2024, PHH filed the present motion. A hearing on PHH’s motion is
set for November 25, 2024, along with a case management conference.
ANALYSIS
PHH
moves for dismissal of the Criglers’ action on the grounds that they failed to
timely file a SAC. For the following reasons, the court GRANTS PHH’s motion.
Legal Standard
Pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure section 581, subdivision (f)(2), the court may
dismiss the complaint when, “after a demurrer to the complaint is sustained
with leave to amend, the plaintiff fails to amend it within the time allowed by
the court and either party moves for dismissal.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 581,
subd. (f)(2).)  If a plaintiff fails to amend after the court has
sustained a demurrer, the court may construe the failure to amend as an
admission that the plaintiff cannot cure the defects that the court identified
and dismiss the plaintiff’s complaint with prejudice.  (Cano v. Glover (2006)
143 Cal.App.4th 326, 330.)
Discussion
On
August 28, 2024, the court sustained PHH’s demurrer to the Criglers’ FAC with
thirty (30) days leave to amend as to the third and sixth causes of action and
without leave to amend as to the fourth and fifth causes of action. (08/28/2024
Ruling, p. 1.) On September 30, 2024, the Criglers filed an ex parte
application that requested an extension of time to file and serve an amended
pleading. The court granted their requested and extended the deadline to 4:00
PM on October 15, 2024. Because the Criglers did not file any amended pleading
by these deadlines and no cause of action remains against PHH, the court GRANTS PHH’s motion.
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, PHH’s
motion to dismiss the Criglers’ action with prejudice is GRANTED.
