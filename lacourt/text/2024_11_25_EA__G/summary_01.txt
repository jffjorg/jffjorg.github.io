And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion by Defendant Tae San International, Inc. to quash a deposition subpoena served on Marco Martinez, Tae San's insurance claims adjustor. The court has granted the motion, finding that the subpoena is harassing and oppressive and seeks information that is available from other sources. The court has also denied Tae San's request for monetary sanctions, as Solorzano did not oppose the motion. The court has scheduled a hearing on the motion for November 25, 2024, along with a mandatory settlement conference and a case management conference/trial setting conference.
