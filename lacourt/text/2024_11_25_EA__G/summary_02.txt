```

And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted PHH Mortgage Corporation's motion to dismiss the Criglers' action with prejudice. The Criglers failed to amend their complaint after a demurrer was sustained with leave to amend, and the court has construed this failure as an admission that the Criglers cannot cure the defects identified by the court. The Criglers' action is now dismissed with prejudice, meaning they cannot re-file the action. The dismissal is based on California Code of Civil Procedure section 581, subdivision (f)(2), which allows the court to dismiss a complaint when a plaintiff fails to amend it within the time allowed after a demurrer is sustained with leave to amend.
