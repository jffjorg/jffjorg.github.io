MOTION
 
On November 1, 2023, Plaintiff Victory 14827, LLC (“Plaintiff”)
brought suit against Defendant Evergreen Advantage Management, Inc.
(“Defendant”) alleging a single cause of action for “Damages for Illegal
Liquidated Damages Charge Breaching Written Contract.”  
 
Defendant now demurs to the Complaint on the grounds that it fails to
state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action and is uncertain
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10, subdivisions (e) and (f),
respectively.
 
Plaintiff opposes the demurrer and Defendant replies.
 
REQUEST
FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
 
            Plaintiff requests the Court to take
judicial notice of:  
 
1.     Exhibit
1: A Promissory Note Secured by Deed of Trust dated September 1, 2021.
 
2.     Exhibit
2: A Deed of Trust recorded with the Los Angeles County Recorder’s Office on
September 21, 2021, as Instrument No. 20211440404.
 
3.     Exhibit
3: A Balloon Payment Disclosure Notice dated September 1, 2021.
 
4.     Exhibit
4: A Demand Loan Payoff dated November 15, 2022.
 
In regard to Exhibit 2, courts
can take judicial notice of the existence and recordation of real property
records, including deeds, if authenticity is not reasonably disputed.  (Fontenot v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.
(2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 256, 264-265.) 
“The official act of recordation and the common use of a notary public
in the execution of such documents assure their reliability, and the
maintenance of the documents in the recorder’s office makes their existence and
text capable of ready confirmation, thereby placing such documents beyond
reasonable dispute.”  (Ibid.)  Moreover, courts can take judicial notice not
only of the existence and recordation of recorded documents but also matters
that can be deduced from the documents, including the parties, dates, and legal
consequences of recorded documents relating to real estate transactions.  (Ibid.)  Therefore, the Court takes judicial notice of
the recorded documents and their legal effect, but not necessarily the truth of
the matters asserted therein.
 
            With regard to the other exhibits, “Judicial
notice may not be taken of any matter unless authorized or required by
law.”  (Evid. § 450.)  Evidence Code, section 452 outlines the matters
of which a Court may take judicial notice as follows:
 
(a)   The
decisional, constitutional, and statutory law of any state of the United States
and the resolutions and private acts of the Congress of the United States and
of the Legislature of this state.
 
(b)   Regulations
and legislative enactments issued by or under the authority of the United
States or any public entity in the United States.
 
(c)   Official
acts of the legislative, executive, and judicial departments of the United
States and of any state of the United States.
 
(d)   Records
of (1) any court of this state or (2) any court of record of the United States
or of any state of the United States.
 
(e)   Rules
of court of (1) any court of this state or (2) any court of record of the
United States or of any state of the United States.
 
(f)    The
law of an organization of nations and of foreign nations and public entities in
foreign nations.
 
(g)   Facts
and propositions that are of such common knowledge within the territorial
jurisdiction of the court that they cannot reasonably be the subject of
dispute.
 
(h)   Facts
and propositions that are not reasonably subject to dispute and are capable of
immediate and accurate determination by resort to sources of reasonably
indisputable accuracy.
 
Plaintiff contends that the remaining exhibits
are properly the subject of judicial notice because they are incorporated into
the Complaint by reference.  In support,
Plaintiff cites to Ingram v. Flippo (1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 1280, 1285,
fn. 3 (hereinafter Ingram); Align Technology, Inc. v. Bao Tran
(2009) 179 Cal.App.4th 949, 956, fn. 6 (hereinafter Align) and Salvaty
v. Falcon Cable Television (1985) 165 Cal.App.3d 798, 800, fn. 1 (hereafter
Salvaty.)
 
In Ingram, the court took judicial notice
of a copy of a letter and media release distributed by the District Attorney’s
office.  The court took judicial notice
of the letter under Evidence Code section 452, subdivision (h) because “the
complaint excerpted quotes from the letter and summarized parts of it in some
detail[,] “both sides referred to the letter and quoted from it[,]” and the
appellant did not oppose the request.  (Ingram,
supra, 74 Cal.App.4th at p. 1285, fn. 3.)
 
In Salvaty, the court took judicial notice
of an attachment agreement that was not certified, and therefore there was no
proof that it had actually been filed with the Public Utilities Commission
because “appellants referred repeatedly to the agreement throughout their
complaint, and alleged on information and belief that it had been approved by
the commission” and “[t]he trial court was given no reason to believe
otherwise.”  (Salvaty, supra, 165
Cal.App.3d at p. 800, fn. 1.)
 
In Align, the court took judicial notice
of the parties’ prior settlement agreement, which “resulted in the dismissal of
the prior suit,” noting the settlement agreement was referred to in the
complaint, citing Ingram and Salvaty for support.  (Align, supra, 179 Cal.App.4th at p.
956, fn. 6.)
 
The Court declines to take judicial notice of
Exhibits 1, 3, and 4.  Unlike the private
agreements in Salvaty and Align, the documents here are not
“capable of immediate and accurate determination by resort to sources of
reasonably indisputable accuracy.”  
 
            And unlike the letter
and media release publicly distributed by the District Attorney’s office in Ingram,
the uncertified attachment agreement alleged to have been approved by the
Public Utilities Commission, or the settlement agreement that resulted in the
dismissal of a prior lawsuit, the private documents between the parties here
are neither official acts of the legislative, executive, or judicial branches,
nor are they capable of immediate and accurate determination by resort to
sources of reasonably indisputable accuracy.
 
            Moreover, the
documents are unauthenticated by declaration or otherwise.  
 
 
ANALYSIS
 
1.     DEMURRER
 
“It is black letter law that a demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of
the allegations in a complaint.”  (Lewis v. Safeway, Inc. (2015)
235 Cal.App.4th 385, 388.)  In testing the sufficiency of a cause of
action, a court accepts “[a]s true all material facts properly pled and matters
which may be judicially noticed but disregard contentions, deductions or
conclusions of fact or law.  [A court
also gives] the complaint a reasonable interpretation, reading it as a whole
and its parts in their context.”  (290
Division (EAT), LLC v. City & County of San Francisco (2022) 86
Cal.App.5th 439, 450 [cleaned up]; Hacker v. Homeward Residential, Inc.
(2018) 26 Cal.App.5th 270, 280 [“in considering the merits of a demurrer,
however, “the facts alleged in the pleading are deemed to be true, however
improbable they may be”].)
 
Further, in ruling on a demurrer, a court must “liberally construe”
the allegations of the complaint “with a view to substantial justice between
the parties.”  (See Code Civ. Proc., §
452.)  “This rule of liberal construction
means that the reviewing court draws inferences favorable to the plaintiff, not
the defendant.”  (Perez v. Golden Empire Transit Dist. (2012) 209
Cal.App.4th 1228, 1238.)   
 
In summary, “[d]etermining whether the complaint is sufficient as
against the demurrer on the ground that it does not state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action, the rule is that if one consideration of all the
facts stated it appears the plaintiff is entitled to any relief at the hands of
the court against the defendants the complaint will be held good although the
facts may not be clearly stated, or may be intermingled with a statement of
other facts irrelevant to the cause of action shown, or although the plaintiff
may demand relief to which he is not entitled under the facts alleged.”  (Gressley v. Williams (1961) 193
Cal.App.2d 636, 639.)
 
A.   
UNCERTAINTY
 
A demurrer for uncertainty will be sustained only where the pleading
is so bad that the responding party cannot reasonably respond - i.e., he or she
cannot reasonably determine what issues must be admitted or denied, or what
claims are directed against him or her. 
(Khoury v. Maly’s of California (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612,
616.)  Where a demurrer is made upon the
ground of uncertainty, the demurrer must distinctly specify exactly how or why
the pleading is uncertain, and where such uncertainty appears by reference to
page and line numbers.  (See Fenton
v. Groveland Comm. Services Dist. (1982) 135 Cal.App.3d 797, 809.)  
 
Although Defendant asserts the demurrer in part on the basis of
uncertainty, Defendant does not demonstrate that any portions of the Complaint
are so bad that Defendant cannot reasonably determine what issues must be
admitted or denied, or what claims are directed against it.  The Court thus declines to sustain Defendant’s
demurrer on the basis of uncertainty.  
 
B.   
FAILURE TO STATE A CAUSE OF ACTION
 
                                                      
i.         
First Cause
of Action – Damages for Illegal Liquidated Damages Charge Breaching Written
Contract
 
Plaintiff alleges that Defendant
loaned Plaintiff $3,575,000 (Compl. ¶ 6); that Plaintiff “did not pay defendants
the principal balance when it was due on October 1, 2022” (Compl. ¶ 7) but
Plaintiff “did pay the entire debt by its payment of approximately
$3,691,503.16 on or about December 1, 2022.” 
(Compl. ¶ 8.)  Plaintiff further
alleges “Defendants included in their payoff demand a $357,500 Balloon Late Fee
in addition to charging 16.50% per annum interest on a daily basis for each day
the balance was not paid off.  The lender
then gave a voluntary credit of $282,500 which was not provided for in the
promissory note that had the 10% late fee on the entire balance as a
contractual term.”  (Compl. ¶ 9.)
 
As such, Plaintiff alleges
that even with the $282,500 discount, the balloon late fee “was an illegal
penalty and not a legal liquidated damage” and the contractual late fee of 10%
on the entire balance due “was an illegal penalty” as a matter of law.  (Compl. ¶¶ 11, 15, 17, 19.)
 
Defendant argues that based on
the unauthenticated documents of which the Court has declined to take judicial
notice, the 10% was only charged on each late payment, not the entire loan
balance, as alleged, the 16.5% default interest rate was only charged upon
Plaintiff’s default of the entire loan, and Plaintiff’s entire case is barred
by accord and satisfaction, when Plaintiff agreed to pay the reduced balloon
late fee of $75,000.
 
Having declined to take
judicial notice of Defendant’s unauthenticated private documents, the Court
cannot say that Plaintiff fails to state a cause of action at this stage of the
litigation.
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
For the reasons stated, the Court overrules Defendant’s Demurrer in
its entirety.
 
Further, the Court orders Defendant to file an Answer to the Complaint
on or before March 29, 2024.  
 
Defendant shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file a proof
of service regarding the same.
