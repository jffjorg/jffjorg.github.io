This is a tentative ruling by Judge Michael E. Whitaker in a case where Natalie M. Georges and Brian W. Shaffer, counsel for Defendants Cigna Health & Life Insurance Company and Cigna Healthcare of California, have moved to appear as counsel pro hac vice in the case. The motion is unopposed. The Court previously denied a similar motion on January 3, 2024, due to a failure to provide evidence of notice of the hearing to the State Bar, as required by California Rules of Court, rule 9.40. However, Georges and Shaffer have now provided proofs of service indicating that the State Bar was served with notice of the hearing on January 5, 2024, and subsequent continuances. The Court finds that Georges and Shaffer have satisfied the requirements for pro hac vice admission and grants both applications.
