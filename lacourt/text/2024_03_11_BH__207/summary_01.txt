Summary in English:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies Plaintiff Ashley Rochestie's petition for relief from the claim statute, which seeks to allow a late claim to be filed after the original deadline. The Plaintiff allegedly sustained injuries from a fall into a half-filled planter and filed a lawsuit against the City of Santa Monica and other defendants. The Court found that the Plaintiff failed to present a claim to the City within the required time period and that the City denied the Plaintiff's petition for leave to file a late claim. The Court also found that the Plaintiff did not demonstrate jurisdiction to petition the court for relief and that the petition was filed too late.
