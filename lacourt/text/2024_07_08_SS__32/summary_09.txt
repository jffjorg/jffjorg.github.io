And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling on a motion to compel arbitration filed by Claimant Peter Wada against James River Insurance Company. The motion seeks to compel arbitration to recover damages as a beneficiary of Alshakarchi's underinsured motorist coverage. The Claimant was injured as a passenger during an Uber drive by a third-party underinsured driver and filed a petition against Liberty Mutual Auto and Home Services, LLC and Helmsman Insurance Agency, LLC. The Claimant filed a motion to compel arbitration against James River Insurance Company, which has not opposed the motion. However, the Court finds that the proof of service on James River Insurance Company is deficient and does not comply with the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 1005. Additionally, the Court lacks jurisdiction over an underinsured motorist arbitration matter. Therefore, the Claimant's motion to compel arbitration is denied.
