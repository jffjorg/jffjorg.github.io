The Court has reviewed the petition
filed on May 29, 2024 by Petitioner Christine Agopian (Petitioner) on behalf of
Claimant Sacha Agopian, age 9.
The Court denies the petition without prejudice for the following reasons: 
 
In item 2, Petitioner must only put Claimant’s name and
not her own name.
 
The entries in item 12a and 12b are inconsistent.
Petitioner now seeks to have $4,638.00 in medical expenses reimbursed. However,
in item 12b, she indicates that she seeks to be reimbursed $4,638, and a
private health insurance will be reimbursed for $4,459.00. The values asserted
in 12b should equal the total value of reimbursements sought (i.e. item
12a(4)). According to the values in 12b, Petitioner actually seeks $9,097 in
total medical reimbursements. However, this amount is further contradicted by
the value in item 16b (which should equal the value in 12a4): $9,955.18. 
 
Furthermore, the declaration filed by Plaintiff on May
29, 2024 in connection with this petition states she is only requesting $4,070
in medical expense reimbursements. (Agopian Decl. ¶ 4.) As stated before, the
values in all future petitions must be consistent throughout. Nevertheless,
Petitioner’s declaration shows support for $4,070 in payments to Blooming Steps
Physical Therapy. The records provided from the Rawlings Company/Blue Shield do
not show that Claimant’s insurance paid for the physical therapy. Accordingly,
in a future petition, Petitioner must write $4,070 in items 12b(1) and 14b(1).
This value, added with the amount requested by Claimant’s insurance ($4,459),
equals: $8,529. Based on the information provided, $8,529 should be the total
amount of medical expenses sought to be reimbursed and should be reflected in
items 12a(4) and 16b of the petition, and in the proposed order. 
 
Petitioner asserts $0 owed to each provider in item 12b5
and attachment 12b5. If there are no medical liens from medical providers, then
Petitioner should mark item 12b(5)(a)(i) instead. 
 
Petitioner requests $20,851.14 in attorney fees which
represents 27.8% of the gross settlement. The Court finds this to be
reasonable. 
 
Attachment 18b2 contains no information. 
 
Petitioner does not need to complete item 21 since
Claimant is not an adult. 
 
In the proposed order (MC-351), Petitioner must include
the correct hearing information for a future petition. Item 8a(4) must contain
addresses for each payee. Item 8b(1) must specify the amount deposited into the
blocked account. The birth date in item 9c(2) contains a typo. 
 
Furthermore, the order in item 9c2 of MC-351 conflicts
with item 5a in MC-355. Petitioner must correct the inconsistency. 
 
Accordingly, the Court denies the petition without
prejudice.
 
Petitioner shall give notice and file a
proof of service of such.
