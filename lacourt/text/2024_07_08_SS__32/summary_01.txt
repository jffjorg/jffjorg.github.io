And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the petition for minors compromise filed by Petitioner Christine Agopian on behalf of Claimant Sacha Agopian, age 9. The petition seeks to have $4,638.00 in medical expenses reimbursed, but the judge finds that the entries in item 12a and 12b are inconsistent and that the values asserted in the petition do not match the declaration filed by the plaintiff. The judge also finds that the records provided from the Rawlings Company/Blue Shield do not show that Claimant's insurance paid for the physical therapy, and therefore requests to be reimbursed for $4,070.00 in medical expenses. The judge also finds that the petition requests $20,851.14 in attorney fees, which is reasonable. The judge denies the petition without prejudice and orders the petitioner to correct the inconsistencies in the petition and to include correct hearing information in the proposed order.
