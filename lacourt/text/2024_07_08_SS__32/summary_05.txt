And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion to relieve counsel, Simon Esfandi, from representing Kenneth Moore, the plaintiff, due to a breakdown in attorney-client communication. Despite numerous attempts to contact the plaintiff, including sending letters and attempting to retain a private investigator, counsel has been unable to locate the plaintiff or communicate with him for 24 months. The court finds this to be a valid reason for withdrawal, as per California Rule of Professional Conduct (CRPC) 1.16 (b)(4). Counsel is required to provide notice of the court's ruling and file proofs of service.
