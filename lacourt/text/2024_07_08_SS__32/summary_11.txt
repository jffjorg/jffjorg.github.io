And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling denies the motion of Plaintiff Jose Virgilio Lopez's counsel, Narimon Pishnamaz/Law & Pish, Injury Trial Lawyers, to be relieved as counsel. The motion is denied due to lack of notice to the Plaintiff and all parties that have appeared in the case, as well as the failure to provide information for all future proceedings. The Court finds that the attorney-client relationship has broken down, but the attorney has not taken reasonable steps to avoid reasonably foreseeable prejudice to the client's interests. The Court orders counsel to provide notice of the ruling and file proofs of service.
