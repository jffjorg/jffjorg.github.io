And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to quash a Notice to Attend Trial served on Defendant Danilo Solis Trinidad by Plaintiff Ryan Pitcher. The Notice was served on May 13, 2024, but the trial date was continued to July 15, 2024. The Defendant argues that the Notice must be quashed because he resides in the Philippines and has no intention of returning to California. The Plaintiff opposes the motion, arguing that the Defendant's testimony is important for trial and that there are ways he could appear remotely. The judge finds that the Court lacks authority to compel the Defendant's attendance at trial under California Code of Civil Procedure sections 1987(b) and 1989. Therefore, the judge grants the motion to quash the Notice to Attend Trial.
