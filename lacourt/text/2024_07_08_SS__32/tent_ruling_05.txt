RULING
 



DEPT:

HEARING DATE:


July
  8, 2024




CASE NUMBER:


22STCV21428




MOTIONS:  


Motion
  to be Relieved as Counsel




MOVING PARTY:


Plaintiff Kenneth Moore’s Counsel




OPPOSING PARTY:


None



 
BACKGROUND
 
            Plaintiff
Kenneth Moore’s (Plaintiff) counsel of
record, Simon Esfandi, Esq./ Compass Law Group, LLP (Counsel), moves to be
relieved as counsel for Plaintiff. Counsel contends relief is necessary because
there has been a breakdown in attorney-client communication. 
 
            No
opposition has been filed for this motion. 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
To be granted relief as counsel, counsel must comply with California
Rules of Court (CRC) 3.1362. Even where grounds for termination exist,
attorneys seeking to withdraw must comply with the procedures set forth in
California Rule of Professional Conduct (CRPC) 3.700 and are subject to
discipline for failure to do so. CRPC 3.700(B) lists various grounds for
mandatory withdrawal. 
 
An attorney's right to terminate the attorney-client relationship and
withdraw from a case is not absolute. (See Vann v. Shilleh (1975) 54
Cal.App.3d 192, 197; People v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398.) The
decision whether to grant or deny an application for withdrawal is within the
court's discretion, and it does not abuse that discretion by denying the
application on the ground that the attorney's withdrawal would work injustice
upon a third party. (Hodcarriers, Bldg. and Common Laborers Local Union No.
89 v. Miller (1966) 243 Cal.App.2d 391.)
 
The rules have been liberally construed to protect clients. (Vann
v. Shilleh, supra, 54 Cal.App.3d 192.) An attorney, either with client's
consent or court's approval, may withdraw from a case when withdrawal can be
accomplished without undue prejudice to client's interests; however, an
attorney “shall not withdraw from employment until the member has taken
reasonable steps to avoid reasonably foreseeable prejudice to the rights of the
client, including giving due notice to the client, allowing time for employment
of other counsel, complying with rule 3-700(D), and complying with applicable
laws and rules.” (CRPC 3.700(A)(2).) A lawyer violates his or her ethical
mandate by abandoning a client (Pineda v. State Bar (1989) 49 Cal.3d
753, 758 759), or by withdrawing at a critical point and thereby prejudicing
the client’s case. (CRPC 3.700(A)(2); Vann v. Shilleh, supra.)
 
 
DISCUSSION
 
Counsel
has filed forms MC-051 and MC-052 and has lodged with the Court a copy of the
proposed order on form MC-053 as required. 
(Cal Rules of Court, rule 3.1362.) 
Counsel states the instant motion is filed for the following reason: “Despite
numerous attempts to contact client via telephone, email, U.S. mail and on-line
searches. Plaintiff's attorney has attempted to hire a private investigator to
locate Plaintiff, however, they have refused to accept the assignment because
Plaintiff is homeless. Compass Law Group has lost all communication with client
for 24 months. Further, client has not once reached out to Compass Law Group
and/or handling attorney Simon Esfandi/Compass Law Group regarding his personal
injury lawsuit.” (MC-052.) The Court finds this to be a valid reason for withdrawal.
(See CRPC 1.16 (b)(4).)  
 
            Additionally, Counsel provides
exhibits showing he has sent letters to the addresses provided by Plaintiff and
attempted to retain an investigator without success. Counsel has been unable to
confirm Plaintiff’s current address despite mailing the motion papers, return
receipt requested, calling Plaintiff’s telephone number, and conducting online
searches. The Court finds these attempts to be sufficient. 
 
            Counsel has also provided
information for all future proceedings in this case.  
 
 
Accordingly, the Court GRANTS the motion to relieve
counsel.  
 
Counsel shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file
proofs of service of such.
