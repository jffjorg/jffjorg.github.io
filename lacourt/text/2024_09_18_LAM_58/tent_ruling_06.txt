Case No.:                    24STCV08425
Motion:                       Motion
for Judgment on the Pleadings
Moving Party:             Defendant,
The Purple Mixer, Inc. dba Miss Jones Baking Co.
Opposing Party:          Plaintiff,
Kaveh Fasih
 

 
Tentative Ruling:      The motion
is granted. 
 

             
         This is a “slack fill” claim.  Plaintiff Kaveh Fasih (“Plaintiff”) sued
defendant The Purple Mixer, Inc. dba Miss Jones Baking Co. (“Defendant”) on
April 4, 2024, asserting one cause of action for fraud and another for
violation of the Consumer Legal Remedies Act (“CLRA”), Civil Code section 1750
et seq.
 
         Plaintiff alleges Defendant sells
muffin mix in opaque packaging that obscures its volume; the mix only fills
about 30% of its container. By obscuring the actual volume of what consumers
are purchasing, Plaintiff alleges “Defendant dupes consumers into paying extra
for empty space.” (FAC, ¶¶ 1, 3.)
 
            On July 10, 2024, Defendant moved
for judgment on the pleadings. As to both causes of action, Defendant argues
Plaintiff fails to state a claim and lacks standing to seek injunctive relief.
As to Plaintiff’s CLRA claim only, Defendant also argues the claim is preempted
by federal law.
 
            Plaintiff filed his opposition on
August 7, 2024. On August 13, 2024, Defendant replied.
 
Request
for Judicial Notice
 
            Defendant requests judicial notice
of its own packaging. The request is granted. 
Plaintiff included a photo of the packaging in the Complaint.
 
Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings
 
A defendant may move for judgment on the pleadings
when the “complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of
action against the defendant.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 438(b)(1) and (c)(1)(B)(ii).)
“A motion for judgment on the pleadings performs the same function as a general
demurrer, and hence attacks only defects disclosed on the face of the pleadings
or by matters that can be judicially noticed. Presentation of extrinsic
evidence is … not proper on a motion for judgment on the pleadings.” (Cloud
v. Northrop Grumman Corp. (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 995, 999, citations
omitted.)
 
The standard for ruling on a motion for judgment on
the pleadings is essentially the same as that applicable to a general demurrer:
that under the state of the pleadings, together with matters that may be
judicially noticed, it appears that a party is entitled to judgment as a matter
of law. (Schabarum v. California Legislature (1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 1205,
1216.) The court “must accept as true all material facts properly pleaded, but
does not consider conclusions of law or fact, opinions,
speculation, or allegations contrary to law or facts that are judicially
noticed.” (Stevenson Real Estate Services, Inc. v. CB Richard Ellis Real
Estate Services, Inc. (2006) 138 Cal.App.4th 1215, 1219-1220, citing Shea
Homes Limited Partnership v. County of Alameda (2003) 110 Cal.App.4th
1246, 1254.)
 
First
Cause of Action for Fraud
 
            The
elements of fraud are (1) a misrepresentation, (2) with knowledge of falsity,
(3) intent for plaintiff to rely on the misrepresentation, (4) plaintiff’s
reasonable reliance, and (5) damage. (Lazar v. Superior Court
(1996) 12 Cal.4th 631, 638.) Under California law, fraud must be pled with
particularity; “[t]he
particularity demands that a plaintiff plead facts which show how, when, where,
to whom, and by what means the representations were tendered.” (Cansino v.
Bank of America (2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 1462, 1469.) Fraud allegations need
not be liberally construed, general pleading of the legal conclusion of fraud
is insufficient, and every element of the cause of action for fraud must be
alleged fully, factually and specifically. (Wilhelm v. Pray, Price, Williams
& Russell (1986) 186 Cal. App. 3d 1324, 1331; see also Quelimane
Co., Inc. v. Stewart Title Guaranty Co. (1998) 19 Cal. 4th 26, 47)
 
            Plaintiff
seeks to meet these elements at paragraph 34 of the complaint.  But these are mostly simply conclusions.  Plaintiff asserts that the false representation
was that the package was “full of product.”  Plaintiff does not claim that the weight
stated on the package is inaccurate.  The
package as depicted in the complaint is clearly pliable, and can be picked up
by the consumer who can feel the amount of the contents within the package. This
is not a hard sided box in which the weight and volume of the product cannot be
seen or felt.  And, there is no statement
on the package asserting anything about the package being “full.”  
 
            A
reasonable consumer can read the package setting forth the weight and can pick
up and handle the package before purchasing it. 
Because Plaintiff does not contend that the net weight specified on the
package is inaccurate, or that the package lacks pliability, the Court concludes
that the Complaint fails to establish a misrepresentation.  (Ebner v. Fresh, Inc. (9th
Cir. 2016) 838 F.3d 958, 965 [reasonable consumer would not be misled when
correct weight included on product].)
 
            Plaintiff
must also plead and prove that he actually relied upon the asserted
misrepresentation. (Schroeder v. Auto Driveaway Co. (1974) 11 Cal.3d
908, 917.) Plaintiff does not plead reliance and, because he is a serial tester,
he cannot truthfully claim that he purchased the product relying on whatever he
regards as the “representations” of the packaging.  (Buckland v. Threshold Enterprises, Ltd.
(2007) 155 Cal.App.4th 798, 808-809 [rejecting claim of reliance under
fraud and CLRA theories].)
 
            The
motion to strike the first cause of action is granted.
 
Second Cause of Action for Violation of the Consumers
Legal Remedies Act
 
            “The
CLRA prohibits ‘unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or
practices’ in transactions involving the sale of goods or services to any
consumer.” (Gutierrez v. Carmax Auto Superstores California (2018) 19
Cal.App.5th 1234, 1249.) Per the CLRA’s private cause of action, “[a]ny
consumer who suffers any damage as a result of the use or employment by any
person a method, act or practice declared to be unlawful by [Civil Code section
1770] may bring an action against that person[.]” (Civ. Code, § 1780(a).) 
 
The elements for a CLRA claim, derived from
sections 1770 and 1780, are: (1) that the plaintiff is a consumer, (2) that the
defendant engaged in an unlawful practice, and that the practice (3) resulted
in (4) damage to the plaintiff. (See ibid.; cf. also Gutierrez v.
Carmax Auto Superstores California (2018) 19 Cal.App.5th 1234, 1246 [basic
elements of wrongdoing, causation, and harm as applied to consumer protection
claim (Song Beverly Act)].)
 
            As
discussed above, Plaintiff has not pleaded reliance. (Princes Cruise Lines,
Ltd. v. Superior Court (2009) 179 CalApp.4th 36, 46 [“reliance
is required for CLRA actions”].)
Moreover, the Complaint does not claim that the
package states a net weight different from what the package contains or that
the packaging precludes a container by holding the pliable package, ascertain
the weight and volume of the product. 
 
            The
Court grants the motion for judgment on the pleadings as to the CLRA claim.
 
Conclusion
 
         The Court grants the motion for
judgment on the pleadings as to both causes of action.  The Court grants leave to file and serve an
amended complaint on or before September 13, 2024.
