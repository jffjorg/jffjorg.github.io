And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling sustaining the demurrer to the second cause of action for retaliation under Labor Code section 1102.5. The Plaintiff, Daryl G. Crouse, alleges that he was discriminated against and terminated from his position as an attorney at Defendant eAccidents, APC based on his religion and for reporting Defendant Avi E. Muhtar's harassing behavior.

The Court has reviewed the Complaint and finds that it fails to plead facts showing that the Plaintiff engaged in a protected activity and had a reasonable belief that Muhtar's conduct constituted illegal activity. The Court has previously sustained the demurrer to the second cause of action in the First Amended Complaint (FAC) for the same reasons.

The Plaintiff has not opposed the demurrer, and therefore, the demurrer is sustained without leave to amend.
