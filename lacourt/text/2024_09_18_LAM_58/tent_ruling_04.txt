Tentative
Ruling:      The demurrer to the
second cause of action for retaliation under Labor Code section 1102.5 is
sustained without leave to amend.  
 

 
This action arises
from an employment dispute. Plaintiff Daryl G. Crouse (Plaintiff or Crouse)
alleges he was discriminated against and ultimately terminated from his
position as an attorney at Defendant eAccidents, APC (Defendant or eAccidents)
based on his religion and for reporting Defendant Avi E. Muhtar’s harassing
behavior. 
 
On October 2,
2023, Plaintiff filed a Complaint for (1.) wrongful termination, (2.)
retaliation under Labor Code section 1102.5, (3.) religious discrimination,
(4.) failure to pay wages and commissions under Labor Code sections 201 and
202, and (5.) waiting time penalties under Labor Code section 203. A Second
Amended Complaint (SAC) was filed on April 22, 2024, alleging the same causes
of action. 
 
On November 2,
2023, Defendant/Cross-Complainant eAccidents filed a Cross-Complaint for (1.)
breach of contract, (2.) breach of duty of loyalty, (3.) trespass, and (4.)
trespass to chattels. On March 5, 2024, eAccidents filed its operative First
Amended Cross-Complaint, alleging those causes of action. 
 
On June 24, 2024, Defendant
filed the instant demurrer to the SAC’s second cause of action for retaliation.
Crouse has not filed an opposition. On September 11, 2024, Defendant filed its
reply, arguing (among other things) that because Crouse failed to oppose the
demurrer, he has conceded to the arguments raised in the demurrer. 
 
            The
demurrer to the second cause of action for retaliation under Labor Code section
1102.5 is sustained without leave to amend. 

 
Legal Standard for Demurrers
 
A demurrer is an
objection to a pleading, the grounds for which are apparent from either the
face of the complaint or a matter of which the court may take judicial
notice. Code Civ. Proc. § 430.30, subd. (a); see also Blank v. Kirwan
(1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) The purpose of a demurrer is to challenge the
sufficiency of a pleading “by raising questions of law.” (Postley v.
Harvey (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 280, 286.) “In the construction of a
pleading, for the purpose of determining its effect, its allegations must be
liberally construed, with a view to substantial justice between the parties.”
(Code Civ. Proc. § 452.) The court “ ‘ “treat[s] the demurrer as admitting
all material facts properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or
conclusions of fact or law . . . .” ’ ”  (Berkley v. Dowds (2007)
152 Cal.App.4th 518, 525.) In applying these standards, the court
liberally construes the complaint to determine whether a cause of action has
been stated. (Picton v. Anderson Union High School Dist. (1996) 50
Cal.App.4th 726, 733.)
 
Discussion 
 
Defendants demur the
SAC’s second cause of action for retaliation under Labor Code section 1102.5,
arguing that it still fails to state a claim. 

 
To establish a
prima facie case of retaliation under Labor Code section 1102.5, a plaintiff
must show (1) he engaged in a protected activity, (2) he was subject to an
adverse employment action, and (3) there is a causal link between the two.
(See, e.g., Patten v. Grant Joint Union High School Dist. (2005) 134
Cal.App.4th 1378, 1384.) With respect to the second element, the current
version of Labor Code section 1102.5, subdivision (c), prohibits retaliation by
“[a]n employer, or any person acting on behalf of the employer.”
 
            Section
1102.5 prohibits retaliatory employment action against a whistleblower.
Specifically, an employer is prohibited from retaliating against an employee
for disclosing information when “the employee has reasonable cause to believe
that the information discloses a violation of state or federal statute, or a
violation of or noncompliance with a local, state, or federal rule or
regulation.” (Lab. Code, § 1102.5, subd. (b).)
 
            In
a prior ruling, the Court sustained Defendants’ demurrer to the second cause of
action in the First Amended Complaint (FAC) because Plaintiff failed to allege
facts showing he had engaged in a protected activity within the meaning of
Section 1102.5. According to the Court, the FAC alleged that the purported
protected activity in which Plaintiff engaged was: “‘reporting Muhtar’s
misconduct, including but not limited to demeaning Plaintiff in front of staff,
filing incorrect federal court documents, and making a veiled threat regarding
office hierarchy.’ (FAC ¶ 23.)” (Minute Order dated March 27, 2024 (March 27
Order), p. 4, the third full paragraph.) The Court ruled “[n]one of [those]
things constitute[d] the unlawful conduct required.” (Ibid.)
 
The Court also
sustained Defendants’ demurrer to the second cause of action in the FAC because
the FAC failed to plead facts showing that Plaintiff had a “reasonable belief”
that Muhtar’s conduct constituted illegal activity. (March 27 Order, p. 4, the
third full paragraph.)
 
            The
Court has reviewed the second cause of action in the SAC and notes that
Plaintiff hardly amended that claim. Plaintiff only deleted a comma in
Paragraph 23 and rewrote Paragraph 24, but did not fix the issues the Court
identified in its prior ruling (i.e., failure to allege facts showing he
engaged in protected activity and that he had reasonable belief that Muhtar’s
conduct constituted illegal activity). 
 
Plaintiff has not
opposed the demurrer. 
 
            Therefore,
the demurrer is sustained without leave to amend. 
 
Conclusion
 
            The
demurrer to the second cause of action for retaliation under Labor Code section
1102.5 is sustained without leave to amend.
