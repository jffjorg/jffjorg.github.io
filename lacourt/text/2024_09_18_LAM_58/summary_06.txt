And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the defendant, The Purple Mixer, Inc. dba Miss Jones Baking Co., on the plaintiff's claims for fraud and violation of the Consumer Legal Remedies Act (CLRA). The plaintiff, Kaveh Fasih, alleges that the defendant sells muffin mix in opaque packaging that obscures its volume, leading consumers to believe they are purchasing more product than they actually are.

The judge found that the plaintiff's complaint fails to state a claim for fraud because it does not allege a misrepresentation that was made with knowledge of its falsity, and that the plaintiff cannot truthfully claim that he relied on any misrepresentation. The judge also found that the complaint fails to state a claim for violation of the CLRA because it does not allege that the defendant engaged in an unlawful practice that resulted in damage to the plaintiff.

The judge granted the defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings and gave the plaintiff leave to file and serve an amended complaint on or before September 13, 2024.
