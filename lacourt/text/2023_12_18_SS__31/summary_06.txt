And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling on the motions to compel is that they are MOOT since the Defendant has now served the responses. However, the Judge finds that the Defendant is still liable for sanctions due to their failure to serve the responses in a timely manner. The Judge awards Plaintiff $900 in attorney's fees and $180 in costs, and sanctions Defendant and their attorney in the amount of $1,080. The parties are encouraged to meet and confer to reach an agreement, and if not, to appear remotely or in person for oral argument.
