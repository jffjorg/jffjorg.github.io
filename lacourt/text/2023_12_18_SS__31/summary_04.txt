And here is the English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has granted the unopposed motion to compel the deposition of Plaintiff Julie Muradyan. The Defendants, Inderjit Kaur and Tarsem Khinda, had previously noticed Plaintiff's deposition on multiple dates, but Plaintiff failed to appear each time. The Judge finds that Plaintiff did not serve valid objections to the deposition notices and did not oppose the motion to compel deposition. As a result, the Judge orders Plaintiff to appear for her deposition at a date, time, and location to be noticed by the Defendant, but with at least 10 days' notice.

The Judge also awards the Defendants $585 in sanctions, which includes $525 in attorney's fees and $60 in costs. The Judge declines to award the request for an unspecific "no-show" appearance fee.

The Judge encourages the parties to meet and confer to reach an agreement, and if a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling, they must send an email to the court with the subject line "SUBMIT" followed by the case number. If all parties do not submit, the parties should arrange to appear remotely or in person for oral argument.
