Background Defendants Inderjit Kaur and Tarsem Khinda, erroneously sued and served as Khindia Tarsem, (“Defendants”) move to compel Plaintiff Julie Muradyan (“Plaintiff”) to appear for her deposition and to pay monetary sanctions.  Defendants noticed Plaintiff’s deposition on numerous dates, but Plaintiff failed to appear for her deposition on August 9, 2022, November 17, 2022, January 31, 2023, February 9, 2023, March 23, 2023, April 6, 2023, May 12, 2023, May 26, 2023, and June 6, 2023. Defendants contend Plaintiff’s counsel would state either their office or Plaintiff was unavailable to each scheduled deposition.  Any opposition was due on or before December 5, 2023; none was filed.   II. Motion to Compel Deposition CCP § 2025.450(a) provides, “If, after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action or an officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a party, or a person designated by an organization that is a party under Section 2025.230, without having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for inspection any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order compelling the deponent's attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the deposition notice.”  CCP § 2025.450 requires the Court to compel the deposition unless it finds a valid objection was served under §2025.410. There is no evidence that Plaintiff served any valid objections to the deposition notices, and Plaintiff did not oppose this motion demonstrating otherwise. Further, there is no evidence that Plaintiff’s deposition has proceeded since the filing of the instant motion.  Therefore, the unopposed motion to compel is GRANTED. (CCP § 2025.450(a).) Defendant requests Plaintiff be ordered to appear for her deposition on December 28, 2023 at 10:00 a.m. However, due to the proposed date’s proximity to the hearing, the Court has reservations as to whether this would provide Plaintiff sufficient time and notice to prepare for her deposition. Accordingly, Plaintiff is ordered to appear for her deposition at a date, time, and location to be noticed by Defendant, but Defendant must give at least ten days’ notice of the deposition (notice extended per Code if by other than personal service; an additional 5 days if by mail, or 2 days if by electronic mail).  III. Sanctions CCP § 2025.450(g)(1) requires the court to impose sanctions unless it finds the deponent acted with substantial justification or there are circumstances that render imposition of sanctions unjust. Defendants request $941.65 in connection with the instant motion. The Court awards Defendants two hours to prepare the motion, and one hour to appear at the hearing, at the requested rate of $175 per hour for a total of $525 in attorney’s fees. Additionally, Defendant is awarded one motion filing fee of $60, as costs. The Court declines to award the request for the unspecific “no-show” appearance fee.  Sanctions are imposed against Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel. Plaintiff and/or Plaintiff’s counsel are ordered to pay sanctions to Defendant, by and through counsel of record, in the total amount of $585 within twenty (20) days.  Moving party is ordered to give notice.    PLEASE TAKE NOTICE: Parties are encouraged to meet and confer after reading this tentative ruling to see if they can reach an agreement. If a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling,¿the party must send an email to the court at¿sscdept31@lacourt.org¿with the Subject line “SUBMIT” followed by the case number.¿ The body of the email must include the hearing date and time, counsel’s contact information, and the identity of the party submitting.¿¿ Unless¿all¿parties submit by email to this tentative ruling, the parties should arrange to appear remotely (encouraged) or in person for oral argument.¿ You should assume that others may appear at the hearing to argue.¿¿ If the parties neither submit nor appear at hearing, the Court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the Court.¿ After the Court has issued a tentative ruling, the Court may prohibit the withdrawal of the subject motion without leave.¿  Dated this 15th day of December 2023      Hon.
