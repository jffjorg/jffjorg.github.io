And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies the request for default judgment submitted by Plaintiff ROBERT CLARK against TEMPLE CB, LLC, a defendant that was previously dismissed without prejudice. The Judge's decision is based on the fact that Plaintiff had previously dismissed TEMPLE CB, LLC (then known as Doe 1) and cannot enter default judgment against a dismissed defendant. The Judge cites previous court orders, including denials of Plaintiff's motion to vacate dismissal and motion for reconsideration, to support this decision.
