And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Diva Abdul-Mansour v. City of Los Angeles, et al. (Case No. 21STCV38636). The case involves a motion for summary judgment or adjudication filed by Defendant Stephen R. Dixon, which was directed at Plaintiff Diva Abdul-Mansour's original complaint. However, Plaintiff filed an amended complaint on November 13, 2023, which superseded the original complaint. The judge holds that the amended complaint moots the motion for summary judgment or adjudication, as the motion is directed at the original complaint, which is no longer operative. The judge orders Defendant to give notice and encourages the parties to meet and confer to reach an agreement.
