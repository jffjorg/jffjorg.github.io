Because Temple CB, LLC was named as Doe 1, Plaintiff had dismissed Temple CB, LLC from the action.   On April 26, 2023, the Court denied Plaintiff’s motion to vacate dismissal as to Temple CB, LLC (Doe 1) on the grounds that Plaintiff waited over six months from the date of dismissal to move for relief.   On July 28, 2023, the Court denied Plaintiff’s motion for reconsideration to set aside the dismissal of Temple CB, LLC.  Therefore, to date, Temple CB, LLC remains dismissed. Plaintiff cannot enter default judgment against a dismissed defendant.
