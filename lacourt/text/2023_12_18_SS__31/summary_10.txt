And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the plaintiff's motion for relief from waiver of discovery objections. The plaintiff filed an action against the defendants, Parking Concepts, Inc. and CA-Lats South, LLC, for damages arising from a trip and fall on a concrete parking block. The plaintiff failed to timely serve responses to discovery requests, but the judge finds that the responses were in substantial compliance with the relevant code provisions. The judge also finds that the plaintiff's counsel's failure to serve the responses in a timely manner was due to mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. CA-Lats opposed the motion, arguing that the responses were not in substantial compliance and that the plaintiff's counsel's reason for untimely service did not constitute mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. However, the judge finds that CA-Lats did not identify any prejudice if responses are permitted with objections. The judge orders that the plaintiff's motion for relief from waiver of discovery objections is GRANTED.
