  Case Number:  19STCV04912    Hearing Date:   December 18, 2023    Dept:  31 DEPT:  31 HEARING DATE: 12/18/2023 CASE NAME/NUMBER: 19STCV04912 MORGAN JORDAN, et al. vs SANTOSH K GARG, M.D., et al. PETITION TO APPROVE COMPROMISE OF PENDING ACTION OF A MINOR Ava Arzate, Age 5 RECOMMENDATION: DENY  TENTATIVE¿ ¿ The Court excuses the personal appearance of Claimant and the guardian ad litem. Counsel may appear by telephone or video conference call.¿  Claimant Ava Arzate (“Claimant”) has agreed to settle her claims against Defendants for the total amount of $990,000. If the settlement is approved, $218,500 will be used for attorneys’ fees, and $107,916.25 will be used for costs.  The net balance of $664,303.75 will be invested in a single-premium deferred annuity, subject to withdrawal only on authorization of the court.  The petition filed on November 17, 2023 is denied for the following reasons.  Petitioner must file an Order Approving Compromise of Claim (MC-351) alongside this petition. Additionally, Item 15 was not completed.  Petitioner provides on Item 10(c) that the settlement is to be placed into a structured settlement annuity and special needs trust. Further, counsel’s declaration requests that “$664,303.75 be placed into the Ava Arzate Irrevocable Special Needs Trust.” The Court is unable to locate any special needs trust accompanying the petition.   Further confusing the matter is Item 18, in which only Item 18(b)(3) was marked, providing that the entirety of the net balance will be placed into an annuity. Item 18(b)(4), pertaining to a special needs trust, was not indicated.   The Court is currently unclear on the disposition of Claimant’s net settlement, whether the entirety is going into an annuity or to be placed into the Ava Arzate Irrevocable Special Needs Trust, or some other allocation between the two. If any of Claimant’s net settlement will be placed into a trust, then Petitioner must furnish a copy of the trust instrument for the Court’s review.   Petitioner must reserve a new date and file a new petition curing the above-noted defects at least 9 court days before the continued hearing date.  Moving party is ordered to give notice.
