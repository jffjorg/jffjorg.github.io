And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the petition to approve the compromise of pending action of a minor, Ava Arzate, and has denied the petition for certain defects. Specifically, the petition was not accompanied by the required form, MC-351, and the special needs trust mentioned in the petition was not provided. Additionally, the court is unclear about the disposition of the net settlement, whether it will be placed into an annuity or a special needs trust. The court orders the petitioner to file a corrected petition and provide a copy of the trust instrument (if applicable) before the continued hearing date.
