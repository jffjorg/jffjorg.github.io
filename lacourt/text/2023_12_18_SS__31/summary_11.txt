And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the demurrer filed by Plaintiff Steffi Pool to Defendant Jacklin Kevorkova's cross-complaint is OVERRULED. The demurrer was based on the argument that the cross-complaint lacks sufficient facts to constitute a claim. The judge found that the cross-complaint alleges two causes of action, for motor vehicle and general negligence, and that these causes of action plead sufficient facts. The judge also noted that the indemnification language contained in the judicial form cross-complaint was not marked by Kevorkova and was not a cause of action being brought by Kevorkova. Therefore, the demurrer was unfounded and was overruled.
