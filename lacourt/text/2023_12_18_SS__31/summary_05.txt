Summary in English text:

The tentative ruling grants the request for default judgment against Dwayne Lamont Brown in the amount of $49,357.19, consisting of $48,720.82 in principal damages and $636.37 in costs. The ruling is based on the plaintiff's declaration, which provides sufficient documentation for past medical specials, and the court's review of the records. The court reduces the request for general damages from $100,000 to an unspecified amount, as the plaintiff did not provide sufficient evidence to support the claim. The court also declines to grant the request for future medical specials, as the recommendation for treatment was over two years ago and there is no evidence that the plaintiff has received or plans to receive the recommended treatment.
