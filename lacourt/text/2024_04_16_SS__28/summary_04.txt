Significant Statements:
  - "A decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly. But where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction."
```
And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers and rules as follows. The court denies plaintiff's request for terminating sanctions against defendants Omar Penaloza and J.J. Kane Associates, Inc. for failure to comply with discovery orders. The court grants monetary sanctions of $561.65 against both defendants. The court orders defendants to comply with discovery orders by April 23, 2024. The court also denies plaintiff's request for evidence and issue sanctions, which would be equivalent to the terminating sanctions that the court has determined are premature.
