  Case Number:  19STCV29977    Hearing Date:   April 16, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
considered the petitioning papers, the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On
August 23, 2019, Plaintiff Yassine Belmlih
(“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendants Los Angeles Unified School
District (“Defendant”) and Does 1-100 for negligence. 
On
August 4, 2020, Plaintiff filed a first amended complaint against Defendant and
Does 1-100 for negligence (Gov. Code, § 910). 
On
August 20, 2020, Defendant filed an answer. 
On
August 29, 2022, Plaintiff’s counsel informed the Court that the case had
settled. 
On
March 22, 2024, Petitioner Mohammed Belmlih
(“Petitioner”) filed a petition to approve the compromise of the claim of a
person with a disability, to be heard on April 16, 2024. 
PETITIONER’S REQUEST 
Petitioner
asks the Court to approve the compromise of the pending action of Plaintiff
Yassine Belmlih. 
DISCUSSION      
Proposed
settlement terms:
          Gross settlement amount:                    $57,023.20
          Attorney’s fees:                                   $13,405.92
          Payment to mediator Alan Saler:         $3,975.00
          Payment to medical providers:            $5,294.97
          Net balance:                                         $34,347.31 
Section
12a(1) of the petition states that Plaintiff’s total medical expenses were
$99,167.66.  Section 12a(3) of the
petition states that, of the total amount, $5,294.97 was the subject of negotiated,
contractual, or statutory reductions. 
This should mean that the remaining amount – $93,872.69 – will be paid
or reimbursed from the settlement proceeds. 
However, Section 12b(5) of the petition states that only $5,294.97 in medical
expenses will be paid or reimbursed from the settlement proceeds.  As a result, $88,577.72 in medical expenses
remain unaccounted for. The Court cannot
approve the petition unless it shows that the minor’s compromise will pay or reimburse
all of Plaintiff’s medical expenses that have not been reduced or waived. 
It
seems possible that the amount listed in Section 12a(3) does not include all of
the reductions from the $99,167.66 in total medical expenses listed in Section
12a(1) of the petition.  The only reduction documented in the petition is the
Department of Health Care Services’ agreement to accept $5,294.97 as reimbursement
for Medi-Cal's payment of $7,059.95.  The
petition does not identify the medical providers that billed $99,167.66 in
total medical expenses or show that these medical providers (aside from Medi-Cal)
agreed to reduce their charges. 
In
addition, Section 12a(2) of the petition states that $5,294.97 in medical
expenses were paid, but Section 12b(4) states that Medi-Cal paid $7,059.95.  Therefore, the figure in Section 12a(2)
should be at least $7,059.95. 
The
Court denies the petition without prejudice. 
CONCLUSION 
The Court DENIES without prejudice the petition for
approval of the compromise of the pending action of Plaintiff Yassine Belmlih filed
by Petitioner Mohammed Belmlih on March 22, 2024. 
          Petitioner is ordered to give notice of the ruling. 
Petitioner
is ordered to file the proof of service of the ruling with the Court within
five days.
