And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the motion of Defendants Alexander Maeda and Edward Maeda to enforce a settlement agreement with Plaintiff Angel Zamora. The settlement agreement was reached on October 19, 2022, and Plaintiff did not file a request to dismiss the matter. The settlement check was stopped and reissued to Plaintiff, but Plaintiff has not dismissed the matter against the Defendants. The Defendants argue that the settlement agreement is enforceable without their signatures, citing Fiege v. Cooke (2004) 125 Cal.App.4th 1350, which held that a defendant is not required to sign a settlement agreement when a liability insurer providing a defense without reservation of rights has agreed to settle the claims within the policy limits. However, the judge finds that the Defendants have not established that their insurance policies gave their insurers the right to settle without their consent. Therefore, the motion to enforce the settlement agreement is denied.
