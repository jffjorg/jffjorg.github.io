And here is the English text summary:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Flat Rate Moving Systems, LLC (Flat Rate) v. A1 Transportation Network, Inc. (A1). Flat Rate filed a cross-complaint against A1 and sought a default judgment against A1 for $85,000.00 in special damages. However, the Court found that Flat Rate failed to provide adequate notice to A1 of the maximum amount of damages that could be assessed against it. The Court ruled that A1 did not receive notice of the damages that might be assessed against it before the clerk entered A1's default, and therefore denied Flat Rate's application for default judgment and vacated the clerk's entry of A1's default. The Court set an OSC re: Status of Entry of Default on May 30, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. in Department 28 of the Spring Street Courthouse.
