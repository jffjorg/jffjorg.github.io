```

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The court has reviewed the evidence presented by both parties and has determined that the defendant's motion for summary judgment is denied. The court finds that the defendant has not met its initial burden on the issue of whether the plaintiff was exposed to laser radiation. The court further finds that there are triable issues of material fact on the issue of causation. The plaintiff's testimony and expert declarations raise sufficient questions of fact to prevent summary judgment. The court is prepared to find that the plaintiff was exposed to diffuse radiation from the CytoFlex S machine, and the defendant's expert testimony is insufficient to establish that the plaintiff was not exposed. The motion for summary judgment is denied.
