```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has dismissed this action for delay in prosecution, as plaintiff Valerie Bradford has failed to prosecute the case and has not obtained the appointment of a successor in interest to continue the action. The court has previously granted defendant Allcare Home Health Provider's motion to compel and imposed monetary sanctions against plaintiff. Despite notice, plaintiff has failed to respond or take action to continue the case. The court finds that it is appropriate to dismiss the action under CCP Section 583.410(a) for delay in prosecution. The motion for evidentiary or terminating sanctions and the ex parte application for order lifting stay are moot.
