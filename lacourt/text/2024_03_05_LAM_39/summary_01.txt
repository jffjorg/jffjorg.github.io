And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the motions filed by Executive Presentations, Inc. (Plaintiff) against Maro Burunsuzyan, et al. (Defendant). Plaintiff moves to compel Defendant to serve responses to requests for production of documents and supplemental requests, as well as to deem matters specified in requests for admission to have been admitted. The Court finds that both motions are moot because Defendant has already served responses without objections. The Court also awards sanctions to Plaintiff in the amount of $4,596.60, which Defendant must pay within 30 days.
