And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge issues a tentative ruling on Plaintiff Cynthia Beck's motion for a protective order regarding an inspection of the subject property. The Plaintiff alleges that a grant deed was forged conveying the property, which was then encumbered without her authorization. The Plaintiff moves for a protective order to prevent harassment and a "fishing expedition" by the Defendant. The Judge denies the motion, finding that the Plaintiff has not demonstrated good cause for the requested protective order. The Judge also notes that the Plaintiff failed to engage in the balancing test required for privacy objections and did not establish a legally protected privacy interest. The ruling is based on California Code of Civil Procedure Section 2031.060 and Evidence Code Section 312, as well as case law, including Hill v. National Collegiate Athletic Assn. (1994) and Williams v. Superior Court (2017).
