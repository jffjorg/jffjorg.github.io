   [1] In this  regard, Plaintiff’s repeated argument that Defendants must show a compelling  need for the discovery is based on authority which has been overruled.__________________________________________________________________________________________________________  TENTATIVE RULING RE: Ex Parte Application of Non-Party Percipient Witness, Girard Damien Saenz, for the Quashing of Non-Party Percipient Witness Girard Damien Saenz' Security and Business Records Subpoena to Home Title LockThe Court has reviewed the ex parte application of nonparty
Girard Damien Saenz.  The Court finds the
matter appropriate for ruling in chambers without argument.

In the ex parte application, Mr. Saenz seeks an order
quashing subpoenas for “business records related to [his] security and
financial information.”  Mr. Saenz does
not provide copies of the subpoenas, does not provide details regarding who the
subpoenas were served upon, and does not provide any information regarding the
scope of the subpoenas.  The application
therefore fails to provide an adequate definition of the problem and an adequate description of the relief sought, and must be DENIED.

Moreover, a request to quash a subpoena is governed by Code
of Civil Procedure section 1987.1, which provides that the Court can quash,
modify, or direct compliance with a subpoena “upon motion reasonably made” by persons
including a prospective witness, a party to the action, or a consumer whose
personal records are subject to the subpoena.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 1987.1(a), (b).)  When a statute authorizes relief by “motion,”
that statute generally precludes the use of an ex parte application to seek
relief.  (See St. Paul Marine &
Fire Ins. Co. v. Superior Court, 156 Cal. App. 3d 82, 86 (1984).)  Granting relief on an ex parte basis often
causes prejudice to the due process rights of affected parties who would
otherwise have the opportunity to address issues on normal notice.  In the absence of a statutory basis for ex parte
relief, and in the absence of specific facts showing prejudice to Mr. Saenz,
there is an inadequate showing of good cause. 
This is a second reason for denial.

The instant ex parte application is DENIED.
