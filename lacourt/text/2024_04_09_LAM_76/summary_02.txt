And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies the ex parte application of Girard Damien Saenz, a non-party percipient witness, to quash subpoenas for his security and business records. The Judge finds that the application fails to provide adequate information regarding the subpoenas and relief sought. Furthermore, the Judge concludes that the request to quash the subpoena is governed by Code of Civil Procedure section 1987.1, which requires a motion reasonably made by a prospective witness, party to the action, or consumer whose personal records are subject to the subpoena. The Judge also notes that granting relief on an ex parte basis can cause prejudice to the due process rights of affected parties.
