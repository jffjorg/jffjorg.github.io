And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings as to the second cause of action for fraudulent concealment. The plaintiff alleged that the defendant, American Honda Motor Co., Inc., concealed the existence of a sensing defect in the vehicle and failed to disclose this information to the public. The judge finds that the plaintiff has not adequately alleged that the defendant had a duty to disclose the existence of the defect, and that the defendant's issuance of Technical Service Bulletins (TSBs) regarding the defect satisfies the "exclusive knowledge" requirement giving rise to a duty to disclose.

The judge also finds that the plaintiff has not alleged that the defendant actively concealed the existence of the defect, and that the defendant's disclosure of the defect to NHTSA and the public through TSBs is sufficient to satisfy the "active concealment" requirement. Further, the judge finds that the plaintiff has not alleged that the defendant had superior knowledge of the defect, and that the mere existence of knowledge that some prior models have experienced customer complaints is not sufficient by itself to establish an affirmative duty to disclose.

The judge will consider oral argument as to whether the plaintiff can amend the Complaint in a manner that could address the Court's concerns.
