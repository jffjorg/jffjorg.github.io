And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings as to the second cause of action for fraudulent concealment. The plaintiff alleged that the defendant, American Honda Motor Co., Inc., concealed the existence of a sensing defect in the vehicle and failed to disclose this information to the public. The judge finds that the plaintiff has not adequately alleged that the defendant had a duty to disclose the existence of the defect, and that the defendant's issuance of Technical Service Bulletins (TSBs) regarding the defect satisfies the "exclusive knowledge" requirement giving rise to a duty to disclose.

The judge also finds that the plaintiff has not alleged that the defendant actively concealed the existence of the defect, and that the defendant's disclosure of the defect to NHTSA and the public through TSBs is sufficient to satisfy the "active concealment" requirement. Further, the judge finds that the plaintiff has not alleged that the defendant had superior knowledge of the defect, and that the mere existence of knowledge that some prior models have experienced customer complaints is not sufficient by itself to establish an affirmative duty to disclose.

The judge will consider oral argument as to whether the plaintiff can amend the Complaint in a manner that could address the Court's concerns.

## Tentative Ruling Summary: Chavez v. American Honda

**Case:** Chavez v. American Honda Motors Co., Inc., et al. 
**Case Number:** 23TRCV00503
**Hearing Date:** September 29, 2023
**Judge:**  (Not specified in the document)

**Summary:**

The judge has **granted** American Honda's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings regarding Plaintiff's second cause of action for fraudulent inducement - concealment. 

**Key Points:**

* **Plaintiff's Allegations:** Plaintiff claimed Honda concealed information about defects in its Honda Sensing system, causing him to purchase a vehicle he wouldn't have otherwise.
* **Judge's Reasoning:** The judge ruled that Honda did not have a duty to disclose information about customer complaints regarding its vehicles, especially when those complaints and repair procedures were publicly available through NHTSA Technical Service Bulletins (TSBs).

* **Plaintiff's Opportunity:** The judge allowed Plaintiff the opportunity to amend his complaint to address the concerns raised in the ruling.

**Legal Issues:**

* **Duty to Disclose:** The core issue was whether a manufacturer has a legal duty to disclose pre-existing customer complaints about a vehicle's safety features to potential buyers, even if those complaints and repair procedures are publicly available. The judge ultimately ruled that such a duty does not exist in this case.
* **Fraudulent Concealment:** The judge found that Plaintiff failed to adequately allege that Honda actively concealed information about the alleged defects. The existence of public TSBs made it difficult to argue that Honda actively hid information.

**Significant Statements:**

* "The MJOP is GRANTED."
* "The Court finds as a matter of law that there is no duty for a manufacturer to disclose the existence of other customers’ complaints in other models of a new motor vehicle when (before the date of sale or lease) the manufacturer has made a disclosure to NHTSA of such complaints and/or repair or diagnostic procedures in a publicly disclosed TSB. Absent a determination by the Legislature of such a duty, the Court will not create one in an individual Song-Beverly Act case."

```

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted the Defendant's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings as to the Second Cause of Action for fraudulent concealment. The Plaintiff, Salvador Chavez, had filed a Complaint against the Defendant, American Honda Motor Co., Inc., alleging causes of action for violation of the Song-Beverly Act and fraudulent inducement. The Defendant argued that the Plaintiff failed to state sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action for fraudulent concealment. The Court found that the Plaintiff did not adequately allege that the Defendant had a duty to disclose material facts, and that the Plaintiff's allegations of exclusive knowledge were inconsistent with the fact that the Defendant had issued publicly available Technical Service Bulletins (TSBs) addressing the alleged defects. The Court will allow oral argument as to whether the Plaintiff can amend the Complaint to sufficiently allege this cause of action. The Judge noted that the applicable standards for a motion for judgment on the pleadings are similar to those of a demurrer, and that the Court will not create a duty for a manufacturer to disclose the existence of other customers' complaints in other models of a new motor vehicle when the manufacturer has made a disclosure to NHTSA of such complaints and/or repair or diagnostic procedures in a publicly disclosed TSB.
