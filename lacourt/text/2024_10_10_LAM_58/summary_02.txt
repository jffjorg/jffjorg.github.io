And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted the motion to dismiss the causes of action 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 11 against Defendant Jon Allen. This is because Plaintiff Jeanie Bryant failed to file an amended complaint after the Court sustained the demurrer and ordered her to do so by August 30, 2024. The Judge assumes that Plaintiff intends to stand on her original complaint, which the Court sustained with leave to amend. As a result, the Judge is dismissing the same causes of action against Defendant Allen.
