Tentative
Ruling:      Granting Defendant
Allen’s Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff Bryant’s first, second, third, fourth,
fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, and eleven causes of action against
Defendant Allen
 

 
I. Background
 
This is an action in which
Plaintiff Jeanie Bryant alleges she was defrauded out of money paid to
Defendants Jon Allen dba Jon Allen Construction, Michael Zatorski dba Ubuild
Construction, David O’Brien, and Efrain Olalde, in exchange for promises to build
two tiny homes for her by September 13, 2022. On April 11, 2024, Plaintiff Bryant
filed a Complaint for (1) breach of contract, (2) breach of the implied
covenant of good faith and fair dealing, (3) fraud— intentional
misrepresentation, (4) negligent misrepresentation, (5) deceit – Civil Code §§
1709- 10, (6) conspiracy to commit fraud or other tort, (7) conversion, (8)
monies had and received, (9) breach of oral contract, (10) promissory estoppel,
and (11) Business & Professions Code § 17200. 
 
On July 5, 2024, Defendant Allen
filed a demurrer to all causes of action except promissory estoppel. Plaintiff Bryant
did not oppose the demurrer, nor did Plaintiff Bryant appear at the hearing on
August 8, 2024.
 
On August 8, 2024, the Court
sustained Defendant Allen’s demurrer and ordered Plaintiff Bryant to file an
amended Complaint on or before August 30, 2024. (08/08/2024 Minute Order.)
 
Plaintiff Bryant did not file an
amended Complaint by the August 30, 2024 deadline.
 
On September 5, 2024, Defendant
Allen filed the instant motion to dismiss the ten causes of action the Court
sustained in Defendant Allen’s demurrer.
 
As of October 10, 2024, Defendant’s
motion to dismiss is unopposed.
 


 
II. Discussion
 
Legal Standard
 
The Court may dismiss a complaint
if “after a demurrer to the complaint is sustained with leave to amend, the
plaintiff fails to amend it within the time allowed by the court and either
party moves for dismissal.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 581, subd. (f); Gonzales v.
State (1977) 68 Cal.App.3d 621, 635.)
 
Motion to Dismiss
 
Here, because Plaintiff Bryant has
not filed an amended complaint, an opposition to the instant motion, or a
declaration explaining the reason for delay, the Court presumes Plaintiff Bryant
intends to stand on her original Complaint. Because the Court
sustained ten of Plaintiff Bryant’s eleven causes of action in the Complaint, the
Court dismisses those same causes of action with respect to Defendant Allen. 
 
III. Conclusion
 
The Court therefore grants
Defendant Allen’s Motion to Dismiss causes of action one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight, nine, and eleven with respect to Defendant Allen.
