Plaintiff Lazhiya Veney’s Counsel’s Motion to be Relieve
as Counsel is GRANTED, effective upon [see below]. 
 
Background
 
This case arises from a motor vehicle accident that occurred
on 2/26/2021.
 
On February 27, 2023, Plaintiffs ZALEKA SHELET TURNER, CORA
GORDON, and LAZHIYA VENEY (a minor) filed suit against Defendants FEDEX FREIGHT
WEST INC. and DAVID HERNANDEZ for: 1.    
Negligence and 2.    
Negligence Per Se
 
On June 20, 2023, Plaintiffs filed their first amended
complaint (FAC).
 
On November 6, 2023, Defendant Hernandez filed his answer.
 
On December 14, 2023, Plaintiffs named FEDEX GROUND PACKAGE
SYSTEM, INC. as Doe 1.
 
On January 9, 2024, Plaintiffs dismissed Fedex Freight West
Inc. 
 
On January 12, 2024, DEFENDANT FEDEX GROUND PACKAGE SYSTEM,
INC. filed its answer.
 
On February 29, 2024, the court held an IDC.[1]
The minute order states, in relevant part, “On the Court's own motion, the
Informal Discovery Conference (IDC) scheduled for 02/29/2024 is continued to
05/01/2024 at 10:00 AM in Department O at Pomona Courthouse South. The Court
and Counsel confer re: Defense Counsel's request to Depose Gloria Martinez
Rodriguez. In light of the above and by Order of the Court, the matter is
reserved as follows: The matter is reserved for May 1, 2024, at the Pomona
Courthouse in Department O at 10:00 a.m. for a Hearing on Motion to Compel
Deposition.”
 
On March 6, 2024, Defendant Hernandez filed the instant
motion.
 
On April 17, 2024, Plaintiffs’ Counsel Ardy Prinia filed a
motion to be relieved as counsel as to Lazhiya Veney. 
 
On May 1, 2024, the court
granted Defendant David Hernandez's Motion To Enforce Deposition Subpoena For
Attendance At Deposition Of Third-Party Witness, Gloria Martinez Rodriguez;
Request For An Award Of Monetary Sanctions Against Gloria Martinez Rodriguez In
The Sum Of $1,185.00.
 
Discussion
 
Counsel Ardy Pirnia seeks to be relieved as counsel because
of a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. More specifically, it
appears that Ms. Veney has been unresponsive to Counsel’s numerous
communication attempts, despite Plaintiffs being “under tremendous pressure
from opposing counsel regarding the discoveries that [they] have to submit on
[Ms. Veney’s] behalf.” (MC-051 Form, p. 3 of 5 of PDF.)
 
Here, as the case is relatively new, no substantive motions
are on calendar, Plaintiff Lazhiya has been unresponsive for months, and the
failure to provide discovery will but prejudice Plaintiff Veney more
than any prejudice from relieving her counsel as discovery sanctions can
include terminating sanctions, the court finds good cause to grant the motion. 
 
The only defect noted is that not all plaintiffs have
been provided with notice of the motion; Defendants have been provided with
notice. 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, the motion is granted effective upon
service of motion and the court’s order upon all Plaintiffs, Defendants, and
all other parties who have appeared.
