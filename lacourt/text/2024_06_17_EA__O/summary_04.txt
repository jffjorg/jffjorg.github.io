And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling addresses the supplemental opposition filed by Plaintiffs in response to the Defendants' motion to strike. The Judge notes that the Defendants did not address the legal principle in their supplemental opposition, instead arguing that the facts and procedural history of the case are different. The Judge also points out that Plaintiffs did not file an opposition to the motion to strike. The Judge seeks clarification on the Penal Code section and whether the Plaintiffs have established evidence for punitive or exemplary damages. The Judge notes that the FAC defines the "Church Defendants" and "Church Leader Defendants" and that the Plaintiffs did not address delayed discovery in their supplemental opposition. The Judge concludes that the argument regarding delayed discovery is presumed waived. The Judge intends to allow the filing of an amended pleading claiming punitive or exemplary damages if the Plaintiffs can establish evidence that meets the clear and convincing standard of proof under Civil Code section 3294.
