And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Defendant LRA, LLC. The demurrer was filed in response to a complaint filed by Plaintiffs BRIANA GARCIA, MARIA ANA YELI GARCIA CASTILLO, and ELIJAH GARCIA (minor). The complaint alleges that the property has severe cockroach infestation, severe spider infestation, aggressive mold contamination, lack of plumbing and heating facilities, and deterioration of the structure. The court has sustained the demurrer in part and overruled it in part.

The court has sustained the demurrer as to the 2nd COA (Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment) without leave to amend. The court has also sustained the demurrer as to the 5th COA (Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress) with leave to amend. The court has overruled the demurrer as to the 1st COA (Tortious Breach of Warranty of Habitability), 3rd COA (Nuisance), and 4th COA (Nuisance/Intentional Tort).

The court has found that the complaint is not "so bad" that Defendant cannot respond to the issues, and that any ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery procedures. The court has also noted that some of the specifics required to clarify the complaint are within Defendant's knowledge.

The court's decision is subject to change based on further briefing and argument.
