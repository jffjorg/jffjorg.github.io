On October
20, 2023, the court issued the following minute order re: Notice of Related
Case: “The Court finds that the following cases, 23STCV16430 and 23STCV24432,
are related within the meaning of California Rules of Court, rule 3.300(a).
23STCV16430 is the lead case. For good cause shown, said cases are assigned to
Judge Christian R. Gullón
in Department O at Pomona Courthouse South for all purposes.”
 
On January
26, 2023, Defendants the International Christian Church, Inc. and City Of
Angels International Christian Church filed a demurrer with a motion to strike.
 
On February
20, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a first amended complaint (FAC) alleging the same
COAs against the same Defendants, rendering the 1/26/23 demurrer moot.
 
On March 12,
2024, Defendant Ricardo (pro per) filed his answer. 
 
On March 25,
2024, Defendants International Christian Church, Inc. and City Of Angels
International Christian Church filed their demurrer to the FAC.
 
On April 29,
2024, as Plaintiffs opposition to the demurrer did not sufficiently address the
SOL issue, the court continued the hearing for supplemental briefing. According
to the minute order: “Plaintiff's
Counsel is ordered to provide response to the reply due on or before May
20, 2024, and Defense Counsel is ordered to file a sur-reply due on or
before May 29, 2024. In light of the above, the Court orders the matter
continued as follows: On the Court's own motion, the Hearing on Demurrer - with
Motion to Strike (CCP 430.10) scheduled for 04/29/2024 is continued to
06/17/2024 at 10:00 AM in Department O at Pomona Courthouse South.” (emphasis
added). 
 
On May 29,
2024, Plaintiffs
filed a ‘Sur-Reply to DEMURRER OF DEFENDANTS THE INTERNATIONAL CHRISTIAN
CHURCH, INC. and CITY OF ANGELS INTERNATIONAL CHRISTIAN CHURCH.’ 
That same
day, moving Defendants filed a ‘SUPPLEMENTAL REPLY OF DEFENDANTS, THE
INTERNATIONAL CHRISTIAN CHURCH, INC. AND CITY OF ANGELS INTERNATIONAL CHRISTIAN
CHURCH’ wherein they indicate that as filing the brief, no opposition was
received by the court’s 5/20/24 due date. 
 
On June 4,
2024, Defendant Thomas McKean filed a demurrer. 
 
On June 7,
2024, ICC and City of Angles Church filed a ‘RESPONSE OF DEFENDANTS, THE
INTERNATIONAL CHRISTIAN CHURCH, INC. AND CITY OF ANGELS INTERNATIONAL CHRISTIAN
CHURCH TO PLAINTIFFS’ UNTIMELY SUR-REPLY TO DEMURRER.” 
Discussion
 
At the
outset, the opposition is grossly untimely. The minute order was clear that the
opposition was due by 5/20/24. For that reason, as also observed by moving
Defendants, it is unclear why Plaintiffs would label an opposition as a
‘sur-reply’ when a reply is filed by a moving party.[1]
What is more, previously, the court continued the hearing for supplemental
briefing because Plaintiffs conclusively argued that equitable tolling
applies. Now, Plaintiffs again conclusively argue that equitable tolling
applies. Plaintiffs’ opposition is mostly if not all a recitation of case law. This is of import because “[e]quitable tolling is a
fact intensive issue and it is determined based upon evidence” (Thomas v.
Gilliland (2002) 94 Cal.app.4th 427, 434.) Notwithstanding, the
court will consider the untimely filing. 
 
The
predominant issue presented is whether Plaintiffs claims are time-barred when
their claims were revived three years from January 1, 2020, but the civil
action was filed on July 13, 2023, which is 193 days past the expiration of the
SOL. (Demurrer pp. 7-8.) Moving Defendants contend that where a plaintiff
voluntarily dismisses a federal action (which was originally filed in a federal
court on 12/30/2022) and then refiles the case in state court—as is the case
here—the case does not relate back to the date of the federal filing for SOL
purposes. In opposition, Plaintiffs maintain that equitable tolling applies regardless
of dismissal’s status (voluntary or involuntary).  
 
Effectively, the parties are presenting conflicting
legal principles, but Plaintiffs citations ultimately prevail. 
 
In its
supplemental opposition, Plaintiffs cite to three cases—Appalachian Ins. Co.
v. McDonnell Douglas Corp. (1989) 214 Cal.App.3d 1, San Francisco
Unified School Dist. v. W.R. Grace & Co. (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1318,
and Addison v. State of California (1978) 21 Cal.3d 313—which addresses
the legal principle set forth by moving Defendants.[2]
In Appalachian Ins. Co. v. McDonnell Douglas Corp. (1989) 214 Cal.App.3d
1 (Appalachian), the appellate court observed the following: 
 
The Respondents assert the equitable
tolling doctrine does not apply when the plaintiff voluntarily dismisses an
action; they assert it applies only to involuntary dismissals. To support this
assertion, the Respondents cite Wood v. Elling Corp. (1977) 20 Cal.3d
353, 142 Cal.Rptr. 696, 572 P.2d 755; Neff v. York Life Ins. Co. (1947) 30 Cal.2d
165, 180 P.2d 900; Dowell v. County of Contra Costa (1985) 173
Cal.App.3d 896, 219 Cal.Rptr. 341; Permanente Medical Group v. Workers' Comp. Appeals Bd. (1985) 171 Cal.App.3d 1171, 217 Cal.Rptr. 873; Hill v. Allan (1968) 259 Cal.App.2d 470, 66
Cal.Rptr. 676; and Cook v. Stewart McKee & Co. (1945) 68
Cal.App.2d 758, 157 P.2d 868.) Initially, we note none of the cases applying the
equitable tolling doctrine have depended on whether there was an voluntary or
involuntary dismissal. Second, the cases cited by the Respondents do not,
either when read singly or together, establish a general rule that a
voluntary dismissal precludes application of the equitable tolling
doctrine. Rather, these cases turn on the failure to meet the Bollinger criteria relating to timely notice, lack
of prejudice to the defendant and reasonable and good faith conduct on the
part of the plaintiff. (Id. at p. 40, emphasis added.) 
 
Accordingly, the Appalachian court expressly
establishes that equitable tolling doctrine does not depend on
whether there the dismissal was voluntary or involuntary. 
 
In its sur-reply,
moving Defendants argue that “[e]very recent case on this issue
makes clear that where a plaintiff elects to voluntarily dismiss a federal
action, there is no tolling for statute of limitations purposes if the
plaintiff then decides to file a state court action, particularly where the
state court action differs from the federal action, as is the case here.”
(Sur-Reply, p. 5:1-5, italics original.) Moving Defendants cite to Paniguia
v. Orange County Fire Authority (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 83, Troche v.
Daley (1990) 217 Cal.App.3d 403, and Johnson v. Riverside Healthcare
Sys., LP (9th Cir. 2008) 534 F.3d 1116, 1127 (citing Mills v. Forestex Co.
(2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 625, 652.) 
 
But
none of moving Defendants’ cases involve equitable tolling of an
action filed in a state court after dismissal in a federal court. As applied to such a situation,
equitable tolling stops the statute of limitations from expiring when a
plaintiff has remedies in addition to state court. Where an action is filed
first in federal court, is dismissed, and then is refiled in state court, the
statute of limitations is deemed tolled under the doctrine of equitable
tolling. (See Mojica v. 4211 Wilshire, LLC (2005) 13 Cal.App.4th 1069 [personal injury plaintiff filed actions against
defendants in federal district court, based on diversity jurisdiction, then
filed an action in state court when the federal action was dismissed]; Thomas,
supra, 94 Cal.app.4th 427, 434 [“ Equitable tolling has been applied
where a plaintiff first filed an action in the federal court that was dismissed
for lack of federal jurisdiction and then refiled in the state court. In that
circumstance the statute of limitations is deemed tolled.”]; Nichols v.
Canoga Industries (1978) 83 Cal.App.3d 956.) 
 
That said, the three elements of equitable tolling
must still apply: (i) timely notice, (ii) lack of prejudice to the
defendant, and (iii) reasonable and good faith conduct on the part of the
plaintiff.

 
Here, though moving
Defendants maintain that none of the elements are not met, the court is
unpersuaded. Even if specifics about the state claim were not provided
(Sur-Reply p. 5), absent evidence otherwise, the same set of
facts are the basis for claims under both the state and federal actions. (See
also Addison, supra, 21 Cal.3d at p. 319.) Furthermore, since the
federal court action was timely filed, moving Defendants “were notified of the
action and had the opportunity to begin gathering their evidence and preparing
their defense.” (Ibid.) Moreover, no prejudice to defendants is shown
for Plaintiffs' state court action was filed the same day as
the federal stipulated dismissal. (Ibid.) Ultimately, similar to Addison,
here, the moving Defendants were fully
notified of Plaintiffs' claims and their intent to litigate in state court, and
they were informed at all times of the nature of Plaintiffs' claims such that
any delay resulting from Plaintiffs' original choice of forum was minimal. (Id.
at p. 321.)
 
Therefore, equitable
tolling applies[3]
and, as such, the court overrules the demurrer as to arguments predicated upon
the SOL.[4] 
 
With that, the court
turns to the remainder of the arguments (starting at page 16, section IV of the
demurrer). 
 
Whether Plaintiffs’ 2nd Cause of Action States
Facts Necessary to Support a Claim Against ICC and/or City of Angels
 
Section 647.6, subdivision (a)(1)
provides: “Every person who annoys or molests any child under 18 years of age
shall be punished by a fine not exceeding five thousand dollars ($5,000), by
imprisonment in a county jail not exceeding one year, or by both the fine and
imprisonment,” As a general rule, “prosecution for an offense not punishable by
death or imprisonment in the state prison [i.e., a misdemeanor] shall be
commenced within one year after commission of the offense.” [Citation omitted.]
An express exception exists for the “[p]rosecution for a misdemeanor violation
of Section 647.6 or former Section 647a committed with or upon a minor under
the age of 14 years [,which] shall be commenced within three years after
commission of the offense.” [Citation omitted.]
 
Moving Defendants argue that there are
no allegations that ICC and/or City of Angels physically abused the plaintiffs
or otherwise “annoyed” or “molested” them but that other defendants did
so. (Demurrer p. 17.) That argument misses the mark. 
 
The
FAC is predicated upon vicarious liability as the named individual defendants
were employees of the Church Leader Defendants. (FAC ¶168). According to the FAC,
Boquet was an ICC leader who ran the Chemical Recovery program (FAC p. 36) and
Gonzalez was another ICC leader. (FAC p. 37.)The FAC further alleges that ICC
and the City of Angels “aided and abetted Sanchez, Boquet, Gonzalez, and
Alanis’s respective sexual molestation because they knew and/or should have
known that Sanchez, Boquet, Gonzalez, and Alanis were molesting the Plaintiffs
and would continue to molest the Plaintiffs; the Church Leader Defendants gave
them substantial assistance (e.g., in the form of concealment, cover, and
social or financial support); the Church Leader Defendants’ support was a
substantial factor in allowing Sanchez, Boquet, Gonzalez, and Alanis to abuse
the minor Plaintiffs unchecked.” (FAC p. 35.) 
 
Therefore, the court OVERRULES the
demurrer as to the 2nd COA. 
 
Whether Plaintiffs’ Complaint
Sufficiently Pleads IIED Against ICC And/Or City Of Angels?


Plaintiffs’ 3rd COA for
IIED is based upon “the sexual assault, molestation, or harassment committed by
Sanchez, Bouquet, Gonzales, and Alanis.” (FAC ¶182.)
 
Moving Defendants argue that the FAC
does not allege that ICC and/or City of Angels committed any acts of sexual
abuse on the Plaintiffs. (Demurrer p. 18.)
 
Here, for reasons stated above—notably
that the FAC alleges that the Church Leader Defendants[5]
created a “hierarchical cult-like structure that aided and abetted the access
to children and the concealment of sexual abuse of minors” (FAC ¶172) and that
instead of notifying law enforcement or taking affirmative actions the Church
Leader Defendants “directed Plaintiffs and Plaintiffs’ parents to continue to
have contact with [the abusers], thereby ratifying and facilitating Defendants’
continued sexual assault and/or sexual abuse and molestation of Plaintiffs”
(¶196)—the FAC does make direct allegations against ICC and City of
Angels. 
 
To the extent that moving Defendants
argue this conduct does not rise to the level of egregious conduct, moving
Defendants’ case citation to a veterinary malpractice case suggests that there
is no case law that would hold the alleged conduct tolerable in a
civilized community.
 
Therefore, the court OVERRULES the
demurrer as to the IIED COA. 
 
II. Motion to Strike[6]

 
Moving Defendants seek to strike
punitive and treble damages on the grounds that as a religious nonprofit corporation,
no claim for punitive or exemplary damages against a religious corporation or
religious corporation. (Code of Civil Procedure section 425.14.)[7]

 
It is unclear whether the FAC seeks punitive damages against Church
Defendants. According
to the ‘prayer for relief,’ Plaintiffs seek exemplary damages “[e]xcept as
against the Church Defendants (against which Plaintiffs reserve their
rights pursuant to Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 425.14).” (FAC p. 59, emphasis added;
see also FAC ¶26 [same], ¶188
[same].) 
 
Thus, this issue does not appear
to be ripe. 
 
Therefore, the court does not rule
on the MTS because it is not ripe. 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, notably as
equitable tolling applies, the demurrer is overruled in its entirety and the
MTS is not ripe because Plaintiffs do not yet seek punitive damages/treble
damages from Church Defendants.
