And here is the summary in English text:

This tentative ruling grants the motion of Plaintiff Lazhiya Veney's Counsel Ardy Prinia to be relieved as Counsel, effective upon service of the motion and the court's order upon all parties. The court finds good cause to grant the motion due to a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship, with Plaintiff Veney being unresponsive to Counsel's attempts to communicate. The court notes that the case is relatively new, and no substantive motions are on calendar, but Plaintiff Veney's failure to provide discovery will prejudice her more than any prejudice from relieving her counsel. The court also notes that not all plaintiffs have been provided with notice of the motion, but Defendants have been provided with notice.
