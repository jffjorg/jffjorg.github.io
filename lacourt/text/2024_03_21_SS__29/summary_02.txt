And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendants' motions to compel the depositions of Plaintiffs Leora and Sharam Lavian. The defendants had previously noticed the depositions for March 7, 2023, but Plaintiffs did not serve a written objection and failed to appear for their depositions. Despite efforts by the defendants to schedule the depositions, Plaintiffs did not respond. The judge finds that the defendants have shown good cause for the requested document production and grants the motions to compel. The judge also orders the Plaintiffs to pay monetary sanctions under the Civil Discovery Act in the amount of $60. The depositions will be rescheduled for April 5, 2024, at 10 am and 2 pm by remote videoconference.
