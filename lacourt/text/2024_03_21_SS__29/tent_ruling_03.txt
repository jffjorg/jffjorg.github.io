 Case Number:  21STCV04710    Hearing Date:   March 21, 2024    Dept:  29 Petition to
Approve Minor’s Compromise for Aaron Samuel Baltayian, IV (Age 12).
 
Tentative:
 
 
The Court excuses the personal appearance of the claimant and the
guardian ad litem. Counsel may appear by telephone or video conference
call.  
 
The Court has reviewed the petition
filed on February 16, 2024. All substantive and procedural requirements are satisfied,
and the settlement and requested fees are reasonable.
 
There are, however, some issues with
regard to the proposed orders.  
 
According to the Petition, the
balance of the settlement proceeds available for claimant will be used to
purchase a single-premium deferred annuity. 
(Petition, No. 18b(3) & Attachment 18b(3).)  The proposed order (MC-351) indicates,
however, that the settlement proceeds will be deposited into a blocked, interest-bearing,
federally insured account.  (Proposed
Order, No. 8b(1) & No. 9a.) 
Petitioner also submits a proposed order for the deposit of funds into a
blocked account (MC-355).
 
The Court assumes that the Petition
is correct and Petitioner proposes the purchase of a single-premium deferred annuity.  In that case:
 
1.      There
is no need for MC-355.
 
2.      The
proposed order (MC-351) must be corrected to indicate at No. 8b(2) that the
settlement proceeds will be used to purchase a single-premium deferred annuity,
with the identifying information regarding the company from which the annuity
will be purchased.  No. 8b(1) and No. 9a
of the proposed order need not be completed as they do not apply. 
 
Therefore, the Court CONTINUES the
hearing on Petition to Approve Minor’s Compromise for a short period of time,
to _______________, for the submission of a corrected MC-351.
 
Moving party to give notice.
