And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the petition filed by Aaron Samuel Baltayian, IV, a minor, to approve a compromise settlement. The judge excuses the personal appearance of the claimant and the guardian ad litem, and allows counsel to appear by phone or video conference. The judge finds that all substantive and procedural requirements are satisfied, and the settlement and requested fees are reasonable. However, the judge notes that there are issues with the proposed orders regarding the use of settlement proceeds. The judge assumes that the petition is correct and proposes the purchase of a single-premium deferred annuity. The judge orders the correction of the proposed order and continues the hearing for a short period to allow for the submission of a corrected order.
