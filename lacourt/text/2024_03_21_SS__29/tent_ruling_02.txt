 Case Number:  19STCV33752    Hearing Date:   March 21, 2024    Dept:  29 Defendants’ Motions to Compel Plaintiffs Leora and Sharam  Lavian to appear for deposition   Tentative The motions are granted. Background On  September 23, 2019, Plaintiffs Sharam Lavian, Leora Lavian, Vida Nikjoo, and  Shanin Nikjoo (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) filed a complaint against Scott  Urquhart, Tamera Urquhart (collectively Defendants”), and Does 1 through 50 asserting  causes of action for motor vehicle negligence and general negligence arising  out of an alleged accident on October 1, 2017, on the 101 Freeway near the  interchange with the 405 Freeway in Sherman Oaks.  Defendants filed an answer on April 5, 2021.   Shortly  after filing their answer in April, Defendants noticed the depositions of all  four Plaintiffs.  (Citron Decls., ¶ 2  & Exhs. A.)  Those depositions were  taken off calendar by agreement of counsel.   (Id., ¶ 4.)  In March 2022,  Defendants renoticed the depositions.  (Id.,  ¶ 9 & Exhs. G.)  Plaintiffs’ counsel  objected to the dates set.  (Id.,  ¶ 10.)  Defendants requested alternative  dates for the deposition, but Plaintiffs did not respond.  (Id., ¶¶ 11-12.)   On  February 22, 2023, Defendants renoticed the depositions of the four Plaintiffs  for March 7, 2023.  (Id., ¶ 13 &  Exhs. J.)  Plaintiffs objected to the  deposition dates in an telephone conversation but did not serve a written  objection; Plaintiffs’ counsel stated that he was at the time on medical  leave.  (Id., ¶ 14.)  Defendants then followed up with Plaintiffs,  but no resolution was reached.  (Id., ¶¶  15-16 & Exhs. K.)    On May  31, 2023, Defendants filed motions to compel the depositions of all four Plaintiffs.  Three of the motions were set for hearing on  March 21, and the fourth was set for hearing on March 22.  Defendants seek $60 in sanctions in each  motion.   No  opposition has been filed.    The  motion to compel the deposition of Shahin Nikjoo, initially set for hearing on  March 21, was taken off calendar by the moving party on March 19, 2024.   Legal Standard “Any party may obtain discovery … by taking in California the oral  deposition of any person, including any party to the action.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.010.)  Code of Civil Procedure sections 2025.210  through 2025.280 provide the requirements for (among other things) what must be  included in a deposition notice, when and where depositions may be taken, and  how and when the notice must be served.   “The service of a deposition notice … is effective to require any  deponent who is a party to the action or an officer, director, managing agent,  or employee of a party to attend and to testify, as well as to produce any  document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing for inspection  and copying.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §  2025.280, subd. (a).) Section 2025.410, subdivision (a), requires any party to serve a  written objection at least three days before the deposition if the party  contends that a deposition notice does not comply with the provisions of  sections 2025.210 through 2025.280. “If, after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action  or an officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a party, or a person designated by an organization  that is a party under Section 2025.230, without having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410,  fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce  for¿inspection any document, electronically stored information, or tangible  thing described in the deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move  for an order compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the  production for inspection of any document, electronically stored information,  or tangible thing described in the deposition notice.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §  2025.450, subd. (a).)  Any such motion to compel must show good  cause for the production of documents and, when a deponent has failed to  appear, the motion must be accompanied “by a declaration stating that the  petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire about the nonappearance.”  (Id., subd. (b).)  “Implicit in the requirement that counsel contact  the deponent to inquire about the nonappearance is a requirement that counsel  listen to the reasons offered and make a good faith attempt to resolve the  issue,” including by rescheduling. (Leko v. Cornerstone Bldg. Inspection  Serv. (2001) 86 Cal.App.4th 1109, 1124. See  also L.A.S.C.L.R. 3.26, Appendix 3.A(e) (reasonable consideration should be  given to accommodating schedules in setting depositions).)   When a motion to compel is granted, “the court shall impose a  monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) in favor  of the party who noticed the deposition and against the deponent or the party  with whom the deponent is affiliated, unless the court finds that the one  subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other  circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ.  Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (g)(1).)   In Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery Act, section 2023.010,  subdivision (d), defines “[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include  “[f]ailing to respond to or to submit to an authorized method of  discovery.”  Where a party or attorney  has engaged in misuse of the discovery process, the court may impose a monetary  sanction in the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees,  incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.”  (Id., § 2023.030, subd. (a).) Discussion Before the Court for hearing on March 21 are motions to  compel the depositions of Plaintiffs Leora and Sharam Lavian.  After at least two prior attempts, the  depositions were properly noticed for March 7, 2023.  (Citron Decls., ¶ 13 & Exhs. J.)  Plaintiffs did not serve a written objection  and did not appear for their depositions.   (Id., ¶ 14.)  Defendants inquired  about the non-appearance, but no resolution was reached.  (Id., ¶¶ 15-16 & Exhs. K.)  Defendants do not need to show anything more.  Their motions to compel are granted.   Good cause has been shown for the requested document production. The requests for sanctions are also granted.  The motion to compel has been granted, and  Plaintiff did not act with substantial justification.  The Court understands that Plaintiffs’  counsel has had some health challenges, but as of the time of filing Defendants  had been attempting to schedule these depositions for more than two years, and  it is not unjust under the circumstances to award the small amount of sanctions  requested by Defendants. As requested by Defendants, sanctions are set in the  amount of the $60 filing fee per motion.   (Citron Decl., ¶ 19.) Conclusion Defendants’ motions to compel the depositions of Plaintiffs  Leora Lavian and Sharam Lavian are GRANTED.  The Court ORDERS Plaintiff Leora Lavian to appear for deposition and produce the requested documents on April 5, 2024, at 2 pm by  remote videoconference.
