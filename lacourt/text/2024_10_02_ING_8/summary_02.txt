Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion for summary judgment in this medical malpractice case. The defendants, Michael K. Newman, M.D. and Association of South Bay Plastic Surgeons Medical Group, argue that they complied with the standard of care and did not cause the death of the plaintiff's decedent, Natalia C. Ulloa. The defendants rely on the expert declaration of Daniel A. Del Vecchio, M.D., who opines that the defendants met the standard of care.

The plaintiffs, Cecilia Tapia De Ulloa and Edwin J. Ulloa, argue that the defendants' actions were negligent and caused Natalia's death. The plaintiffs rely on the expert declaration of Mark A. Schusterman, M.D., FACS, who opines that the defendants breached the standard of care.

The judge finds that both parties have introduced competing expert declarations, which creates triable issues. The judge notes that a defendant moving for summary judgment in a medical malpractice action must present evidence that would preclude a reasonable trier of fact from finding that their treatment fell below the standard of care.

The judge concludes that the motion for summary judgment is denied, and the case will proceed to trial. The plaintiffs are ordered to provide notice of the denial.
