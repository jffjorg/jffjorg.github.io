And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiff, Dubravko Skare, has filed an application for a writ of attachment to enforce a foreign-country money judgment against the defendant, Peter Balov. The judgment was obtained in Croatia and is for the amount of HRK 2,598,091.25 (approximately $373,086). The plaintiff seeks to attach various types of property, including interests in real property, accounts receivable, and general intangibles.

The court has tentatively denied the application because the plaintiff's description of the property to be attached is not specific enough to give notice to the defendant. Additionally, there is no proof of service of the required documents on the defendant.

The court will hear oral argument on the issue of whether the plaintiff is entitled to an attachment order without notice to the defendant. The plaintiff must convince the court that an attachment is necessary to prevent concealment or impairment of the property, and that the defendant will not be prejudiced by the attachment.
