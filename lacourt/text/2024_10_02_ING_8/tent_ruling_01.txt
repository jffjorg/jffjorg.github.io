I. BACKGROUND¿¿ 
¿¿ 
A. Factual¿¿ 
¿ 
This action arises out of allegations of negligence claimed
to have caused a motor vehicle collision. Amir Aziz Sarem (Plaintiff) alleges that
on February 10, 2022, Michael James Dempski (Defendant) recklessly crashed
his vehicle into Plaintiff’s vehicle at “Sofi stadium parking lot located at
1001 Stadium Dr, Inglewood, CA 90301.” (Compl., at p. 4-5.) Plaintiff alleges Defendant’s actions were the proximate cause of Plaintiff’s
injuries and property damage. (Ibid.) 
 
B. Procedural 
 
Plaintiff filed this action against
Defendant, Enterprise Rent-A-Car
Company of Los Angeles, LLC (Defendant), and Does 1 through 20 (Defendant) on
November 18, 2022 alleging two causes of action: (1) Property Damage - Motor
Vehicle and (2) General Negligence – Personal Injury. (Compl., at p. 3.) 
 
On July 7, 2023, Defendant Dempski filed an answer denying
all Plaintiff’s allegations. (Answer.) Defendant all pleads 21 affirmative
defenses including Failure to State a Claim, Assumption of Risk, and expired
Statute of Limitations. (Id. at ¶ 1, 4, 18.)
 
On July 29, 2024, California Insurance
Company (Intervenor) filed a motion for leave to intervene pursuant to Civil
Procedure Code section 387 subdivisions (a) and (b) and Labor Code section 3853.
(Mtn. to Intervene, pgs. 2:25-28, 3:1-10.) Intervenor states that Plaintiff’s injuries occurred during
the course and scope of his employment and that Plaintiff’s employer was
insured for workers’ compensation liability by Intervenor on the date of the
accident. Intervenor alleges it has paid $105,000 in workers’ compensation
benefits to Plaintiff split between medical expenses and indemnity payments as
a result of the subject incident. (Id. at pg. 2:5-9.)
 
 As of the date of this tentative, neither
Plaintiff nor Defendants have filed an opposition.

¿II. ANALYSIS¿ 
Intervention occurs when “a nonparty,
deemed an intervenor, becomes a party to an action or proceeding between
other persons by . . . (1) Joining a plaintiff in
claiming what is sought by the complaint; (2) Uniting with a defendant
in resisting the claims of a plaintiff; or (3) Demanding anything adverse to
both a plaintiff and a defendant.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 387,
subd. (b)(1)-(3).) Allowing nonparties to participate in litigation “‘protects
the interests of others affected by the judgment, obviating delay and
multiplicity.’” (Carlsbad Police Officers Ass’n v. City of Carlsbad (2020)
49 Cal.App.5th 135, 148 (quoting People v. Superior Court (1976) 17
Cal.3d 732, 736).)
A.   
Legal
Standard ¿ 
 
“A
nonparty shall petition the court for leave to intervene by noticed motion or
ex parte application. The petition shall include a copy of the proposed
complaint in intervention or answer in intervention and set forth the grounds
upon which intervention rests.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 387, subd. (c).) 
 
“The
court shall, upon timely application, permit a nonparty to intervene in the
action or proceeding if either of the following conditions is satisfied: 
(A)¿A provision of law confers an unconditional right
to intervene. 
(B)¿The person seeking intervention claims
an interest relating to the property or transaction that is the subject of the
action and that person is so situated that the disposition of the action may
impair or impede that person’s ability to protect that interest, unless that
person’s interest is adequately represented by one or more of the existing
parties.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 387, subd. (d)(1).) 
 
Where an employee brings an action
for damages proximately caused by a third person, an employer who pays or
becomes obligated to pay compensation, or who pays, or becomes obligated to pay
salary in lieu of compensation, may also make a claim or bring an action
against the third person. (Lab. Code, § 3852.) “[T]he employer may
recover in the same suit, in addition to the total amount of compensation,
damages for which he or she was liable including all salary, wage, pension, or
other emolument paid to the employee or to his or her dependents.” (Ibid.)
 
“A workers’ compensation carrier is
authorized to attempt recovery of benefits paid either through the maintenance
of an independent action (Lab. Code, § 3852), intervention in the employee’s
action (Lab. Code, § 3853), or assertion of lien rights in the employee’s
recovery (Lab. Code, § 3856, subd. (b).)” (Catello v. I.T.T. General
Controls (1984) 152 Cal.App.3d 1009, 1015, fn. 7.) When the action is
initiated by the employee, the employer may, “at any time before trial on the
facts,” join as a party plaintiff. (Lab. Code, § 3853.)
If leave to intervene is granted by
the court, the intervenor shall separately file the complaint in intervention
and serve notice of the court’s decision to parties who have appeared. (Code
Civ. Proc. § 387, subd. (e)(1)-(2).) 
B.   
Discussion
¿
Intervenor’s motion is timely.
 
A request for leave to intervene must be timely. (Code Civ. Proc., §
387, subds. (d)(1) & (2).) A request based on an unconditional right
to intervene should be exercised: (1) within the statutorily permitted
timeframe; (2) before the suit is voluntarily dismissed; and (3) in most cases,
before the statute of limitations runs on any new causes of action asserted in
the pleading in intervention. (Mar v. Sakti Int’l (1992) 9 Cal.App.4th
1780, 1784-1785; Lohnes v. Astron Computer Prods. (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th
1150, 1153-1154; Basin Constr. Corp. v. Dept. of Water & Power of L.A.
(1988) 199 Cal.App.3d 819, 824.) “The relevant statute granting the right to
intervene in a particular situation must be consulted to determine whether it
addresses the timeliness issue.” (Mar, supra, 9 Cal.App.4th at p.
1784.) 
 
Labor
Code section 3853 “provides that the unconditional right to intervene” it
confers “may be exercised ‘at any time before trial on the facts.’” (Id.
at p. 1785.) An Intervenor may file its complaint even if the statute of
limitations has run on a separate employer or employee claim. (Jordan v.
Superior Court (1981) 116 Cal.App.3d 202, 207-210.) This standard “as
incorporated into subdivision (b) of section 387, constitutes the
governing rule of decision.” (Ibid.)
 
Here, Intervenor filed its motion for leave to intervene on July 29,
2024, and the court has not set a trial date. (See Minute Order
(2/26/2024) (“Trial Setting Conference is scheduled for 10/02/2024 at
08:30 AM . . . ”).) Additionally, the court notes that while the
one-year statute of limitations governs Plaintiff’s suit against a third party,
Plaintiff filed this suit within the one-year statute of limitations (alleged
injury occurred on February 10, 2022 and suit filed on November 18, 2022), and
an employer or employee who has an unconditional right to intervene may
intervene at any time prior to trial on the facts, and thereby avoid the
one-year statute of limitations. (O’Dell v. Freightliner Corp. (1992) 10
Cal.App.4th 645, 654.) 
 
Accordingly, Intervenor’s motion is timely.
 
Intervenor
has an unconditional right to intervene under Labor Code sections 3852 and
3853. 
 
A nonparty moving for mandatory intervention must show
that it has an interest relating to the property or transaction that is the
subject to the action, such as a direct pecuniary interest. (Code Civ. Proc., §
387, subd. (d)(1)(B); Coalition for Fair Rent v. Abdelnour (1980) 107
Cal.App.3d 97, 115.)
 
California Labor Code section 3852 grants
“employers” who pay or are obligated to pay worker’s compensation benefits for
workplace injuries the unconditional right to bring an action for damages against
third parties. (Lab. Code, § 3852; Bailey v. Reliance Insurance Co.
(2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 449, 454.) The Labor Code defines “employer” as both
employers and workers’ compensation carriers. (Lab. Code, § 3850(b)
[“‘Employer’ includes insurer[.]”]; Lab. Code, § 3211 [“‘Insurer’
includes . . . any private company . . . authorized
under the laws of this State to insure employers against liability for
compensation . . . .”].)
 
Here, pursuant to Civil Procedure
Code section 387, subdivision (d)(1)(A), the law confers an unconditional right
as to Intervenor joining this action based on Labor Code section 3853. Plaintiff
sustained the injury at issue on February 10, 2022 while in the course and
scope of his employment to RCL Red Carpet Limousine Service Inc. (Intervenor’s
Mtn. Leave to Intervene, pg. 2:3-5.) Intervenor contends that on February 10,
2022, Intervenor insured Plaintiff’s employer RCL Red Carpet Limousine Service
Inc. for workers’ compensation. (Id., pg. 2:4-6.) Plaintiff filed a workers’
compensation claim, and Intervenor has been paying “benefits to and on behalf
of Plaintiff” pursuant to the Labor Code. (Id. pg. 2:7-9; Declaration of
Katherine J. Hanson [Hanson Decl.] – Exh. B “Amir Sarem – 164800 – Benefits
Paid as of 07/19/2024.) Plaintiff indicates no opposition to this intervenor. Accordingly, because Intervenor has met its burden of showing it has
a direct interest the subject of Plaintiff’s action, Intervenor has an
unconditional right to intervene under Labor Code sections 3852 and 3853.
Therefore, the Court
GRANTS Intervenor’s motion.
            Intervenor is ordered to give notice.
