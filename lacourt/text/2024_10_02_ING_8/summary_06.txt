Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by Loya Casualty Insurance Company, a defendant in a personal injury lawsuit brought by Henry Yee. The lawsuit claims that Loya Casualty is liable for damages sustained by Yee in a motor vehicle collision that occurred on April 28, 2022. The demurrer argues that the Complaint fails to state a cause of action against Loya Casualty and that Yee failed to join the proper parties to the lawsuit.

The court has sustained the demurrer with leave to amend, meaning that Yee may amend his Complaint to address the concerns raised by the demurrer. The court has given Yee 30 days to file and serve his first amended complaint.

The court's decision is based on the fact that the Complaint does not allege sufficient facts to state a cause of action against Loya Casualty. The demurrer argues that Loya Casualty is not liable for the damages sustained by Yee because it is an insurance company and not a party to the underlying tort. The court agrees with this argument and finds that the Complaint has failed to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against Loya Casualty.

The court has also pointed out that Yee has not alleged which exception to the general rule that a third party cannot sue an insurance company applies in this case, such as where the injured party is a judgment creditor or an assignee of the insured's claims. Therefore, the court has sustained the demurrer and given Yee the opportunity to amend his Complaint to address these concerns.
