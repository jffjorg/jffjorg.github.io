And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiff, Sunnyside Cremation and Funeral, Inc., has filed a motion for sanctions against the defendants, AASP, Inc., Jay Hoon Lee, Jae So Lim, Andy Lim, and Jennyfer Oh, seeking $8,925.00 in monetary sanctions. The defendants had filed two demurrers, both of which were overruled, and the plaintiff contends that the second demurrer was improper. The judge has denied the motion for sanctions, finding that the defendants' filing of the second demurrer was not improper and that the plaintiff's contention that it was a non-compliant motion for reconsideration is not supported by the facts. The judge has also denied the defendants' request for sanctions against the plaintiff, finding that the motion for sanctions was not brought in bad faith or to harass or cause undue delay and cost.
