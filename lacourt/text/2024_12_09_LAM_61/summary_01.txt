And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiffs' motion to strike defendant's answer or deem matters admitted in part. The defendant's answer is not stricken, but the plaintiffs' requests for admission are deemed admitted against the defendant. The defendant failed to respond to correspondence and discovery, and failed to serve timely responses to requests for admission. The judge found that the defendant's conduct constitutes a misuse of the discovery process, but did not justify terminating sanctions such as striking the answer or dismissing the action. However, the judge did find that the defendant's failure to respond to the requests for admission was sufficient to deem those requests admitted.
