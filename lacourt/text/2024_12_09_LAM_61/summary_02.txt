The defendant, Kelly Gibbons, has filed a motion to withdraw or amend admissions made in response to requests for admission. The plaintiff, Stewart Lucas Murrey, opposes the motion and seeks sanctions. The court has considered the motion and opposition and has denied the motion. The court found that Gibbons has not demonstrated entitlement to relief, as she has not shown that the admissions were obtained by mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect, and that the plaintiff will not be prejudiced if the motion is granted. The court also noted that Gibbons has not provided evidence authenticated by a declaration submitted under oath, as required by law. As a result, the court has denied the motion and awarded no sanctions.
