Here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is based on the information presented before today. The Judge notes that Lundeen Coatings Corp. v. Department of Water & Power is inapt and does not address the question of whether a statute's use of "city" necessarily includes charter cities within the context of the home-rule doctrine of the State Constitution. The Judge also notes that it is unlikely that the City Council would have rescinded the declaration if presented with a resolution. The Judge determines that the City Council has jurisdiction and that the declaration was not rescinded. The Judge also notes that the interpretation of an ordinance is a legal issue for the Court and that when the language of an ordinance is clear, resort to extrinsic aids is unnecessary.
