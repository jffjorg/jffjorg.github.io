 Case Number:  24STCP02973    Hearing Date:   May 30, 2024    Dept:  86 MOTIONS (2) TO QUASH SERVICE OF SUMMONS  Date:               5/30/24 (1:30 PM) Case:               Chester P. Kim et al. v. Alex Myung Cha et al.
(24STLC00247)   TENTATIVE RULING: Defendant Young Nae
Lee aka Brandon Lee and Benedict J. Pak each move to quash service of summons
and First Amended Complaint.  For the
reasons that follow, the Motions are GRANTED.  A motion to quash may be granted on the ground that the
court lacks jurisdiction over the respondent. (CCP § 418.10(a)(1).)
“[C]ompliance with the statutory procedures for service of process is essential
to establish personal jurisdiction. [Citation.]” (Dill v. Berquist
Construction Co. (1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 1426, 1444.) “When a defendant
challenges [personal] jurisdiction by bringing a motion to quash, the burden is
on the [petitioner] to prove the existence of jurisdiction by proving, inter
alia, the facts requisite to an effective service.” (Id. at 1439-40.)  According to the proofs of service filed on February 13,
2024, a registered process server personally served both defendants Lee and Pak
the summons and First Amended Complaint on February 12, 2024 at 1:51 p.m. and
1:53 p.m., respectively, at 965 South Normandie Avenue #102, Los Angeles, CA
90006. (See also Cha Decls. ¶ 2 & Exs. A.) Lee and Pak aver that
they were not at the Normandie address on February 12, 2024, nor were they ever
served with the summons and complaint at any time. (B. Lee Decl. ¶¶ 4, 5; Pak
Decl. ¶¶ 4, 5.) According to Hyunjung Lee, who was the only individual working
at the Normandie address (the address of defendant Los Angeles Korean Festival
Foundation), on February 12, 2024 around 1:50 p.m., a man handed her envelopes
with the names of defendants Lee and Pak on the cover of the envelopes. (H. Lee
Decl. ¶¶ 4, 5.) According to Hyunjung Lee, neither defendant Lee nor Pak were
in the office on February 12, 2024. (H. Lee Decl. ¶ 6.)  Defendants Lee and Pak also aver that, although they are
members of the Foundation, they do not work at or maintain an office at the
Normandie address. (B. Lee Decl. ¶ 4; Pak Decl. ¶ 4.) Nor have defendants Lee
and Pak received the summons and complaint in the mail at their home or
business addresses. (B. Lee Decl. ¶ 6; Pak Decl. ¶ 6.)  Such averments demonstrate that defendants may not have been personally
served with the summons or First Amended Complaint, pursuant to CCP § 415.10.  To the extent
plaintiffs wish to maintain that Lee and Pak were served with the summons and
First Amended Complaint by substitute service at their usual place of business
pursuant to CCP § 415.20(a), Lee and Park also aver that they do not work
or maintain an office at the Normandie address. (B. Lee Decl. ¶ 4; Pak
Decl. ¶ 4; CCP § 415.20(a) [“In lieu of personal delivery of a copy of the
summons and complaint to the person to be served…a summons may be served by
leaving a copy of the summons and complaint during usual office hours in his or
her office….”].) Defendant therefore also demonstrate that substitute service may
not have been effectuated.  In light of the
foregoing plaintiffs fail to meet their ultimate burden to demonstrate effective
service to establish personal jurisdiction over Lee and Pak. Plaintiffs do not
attempt to dispute the averments of defendants or Hyunjung Lee. Rather,
plaintiffs argue that defendants made a general appearance on May 6, 2024 by
filing a joinder to defendant Alex Cha’s opposition to the petition for writ of
mandate. “[I]t has long been the rule in California that a party waives any
objection to the court’s exercise of personal jurisdiction when the party makes
a general appearance in the action.” (Roy v. Superior Court (2005) 127
Cal.App.4th 337, 341.) “A general appearance occurs when the defendant takes
part in the action or in some manner recognizes the authority of the court to
proceed.” (Dial 800 v. Fesbinder (2004) 118 Cal.App.4th 32, 52.) Here, however,
defendants Lee and Pak filed their motions to quash on April 15 and April 29,
2024, respectively. “[N]o act by a party who makes a motion [to quash service of
summons], including filing an answer, demurrer, or motion to strike constitutes
an appearance, unless the court denies the motion made under this section.”
(CCP § 418.10(e)(1).) Per the CCP § 418.10(e)(1), the filing of the joinder
after defendants had filed their motions to quash did not constitute an
appearance by either Lee or Pak.  Plaintiffs also
argue that they served notice of the hearing on defendants Lee and Pak by
registered mail in accordance with Corporations Code § 709, as ordered by the
Court on April 17, 2014. (W.D. Lee Decl. ¶¶ 6, 7, 9, 10 & Exs. A, D, E.) That
may be true.  But, even assuming
plaintiffs satisfied the heightened notice requirements for the hearing as
permitted by the Court in accordance with section 709, meeting such heightened
notice requirements for a hearing on an expedited basis does not equate to satisfying
the requirements for service of summons to establish the Court’s jurisdiction
over Lee and Pak. (CCP § 410.50(a).) As discussed above, plaintiffs have not
established that they complied with the statutory procedures setting forth the
manner of service of summons. (See CCP § 415.10, et seq.)  For the foregoing
reasons, the Court finds that plaintiffs failed to meet their burden to
demonstrate proper service.  Accordingly,
the motions to quash are GRANTED. Service of the summons on defendants Young
Nae Lee aka Brandon Lee and Benedict J. Pak is hereby QUASHED.  















































HEARING RE: VALIDITITY OF ELECTION PURSUANT TO CORPORATIONS  CODE § 5527   Date:               5/30/24 (1:30 PM)  Case:               Chester P. Kim et al. v. Alex Myung Cha et al.  (24STLC00247)    TENTATIVE RULING:         The hearing re:  validity of election of Alex Myung Cha, Young Nae Lee aka Brandon Lee, and  Benedict J. Pak is CONTINUED to 6/25/24 at 1:30 PM in Department  86 at Stanley Mosk Courthouse.   Plaintiffs Chester  P. Kim, Howard Park, and Al Insoon Choe challenge the election of defendant  Alex Myung Cha, Young Nae Lee aka Brandon Lee, and Benedict J. Pak as directors  of the Los Angeles Korean Festival Foundation (“Foundation”) on January 23,  2023.  Plaintiffs also challenge  defendant Cha’s election to Chair of the Board for the Foundation and the  expulsion of plaintiffs as directors of the Foundation—contentions that may depend  upon whether defendants were legitimately made directors of the Foundation in  the first instance.  (See First  Am. Compl ¶¶64-73.)   As for plaintiff’s  challenge to the election of defendants, CCP § 5527 states: “An action  challenging the validity of any election, appointment or removal of a director  or directors must be commenced within nine months after the election,  appointment or removal. If no such action is commenced, in the absence of  fraud, any election, appointment or removal of a director is conclusively  presumed valid nine months thereafter.”    It is undisputed that defendants Cha, Lee, and Pak were  elected on January 23, 2023. (C. Kim Decl. ¶ 14; Choe Decl. ¶ 14; Bae Decl. ¶  10; H. Kim Decl. ¶¶ 24, 25; Cha Decl. ¶ 2 & Ex. I at 1, 15-2`.) Based on  the date of the Board meeting, “in the absence of fraud,” plaintiffs had until October  23, 2023 to file the instant action challenging the election. Plaintiffs filed  the original Complaint on February 5, 2024.   Accordingly, plaintiffs must demonstrate fraud in order to avoid the  conclusive presumption that defendants’ election on January 23, 2023 was valid.   Plaintiffs argue that there was fraud on the part of Board  member Moo Han Bae. Bae purportedly made the motion to appoint defendants as  directors. (C. Kim Decl. ¶ 14; Choe Decl. ¶ 14.) Before taking a vote on a  motion, Bae purportedly told plaintiffs Kim and Choe that each of the  defendants paid the required $10,000 director fee to the Foundation. Plaintiffs  purportedly relied on Bae’s assurances in voting to appoint defendants as  directors. (C. Kim Decl. ¶ 14; Choe Decl. ¶ 14.)    Defendants dispute plaintiffs’ recounting of the discussion.  Bae and Hanna Kim (“Ms. Kim”), Executive Director of the Foundation, aver that there  was never any discussion about whether defendants paid any amount of their  director fees. (Bae Decl. ¶ 10; H. Kim Decl. ¶ 25.) Defendants present a  transcript of a recording of the Board meeting, which contains no discussion of  the director payment. (H. Kim Decl. ¶¶ 26, 27; Cha Decl. ¶ 3 & Ex. I.) The  transcript also reflects that plaintiff Kim asked Bae who made the motion and  who seconded the motion. Bae responded that Choe made the motion and Kim  seconded it. Plaintiffs did not dispute Bae’s characterization. (Cha Decl. ¶ 3  & Ex. I at 20.) Prior to the election, plaintiffs Kim and Choe also  expressed concern that the Foundation had only four members. (Cha Decl. ¶ 3  & Ex. I at 15-16.)   In the reply, plaintiffs maintain that the discussion of the  director payment occurred before Hanna Kim arrived and started recording the  meeting. (Kim. Supp. Decl. ¶¶ 3, 4; Choe Supp. Decl. ¶¶ 3, 4.) Plaintiff Kim  purportedly informed Bae that, in late December 2022, Ms. Kim told plaintiff  that defendants each paid $5,000, half of the $10,000 director fee. (Kim Supp.  Decl. ¶ 3; Choe Supp. Decl. ¶ 3.) Kim purportedly asked Bae if defendants paid  the remaining $5,000 of the director fee. Bae purportedly responded that he  received three additional checks in the amount of $5,000 and gave them to Ms.  Kim to be deposited into the Foundation’s bank account. In response, plaintiffs  Kim and Choe purportedly thanked Bae for having taken care of the director fees  before the election. (Kim Supp. Decl. ¶ 3; Choe Supp. Decl. ¶ 3.) Plaintiffs do  not explain how purportedly verbatim quotations of what Bae said in their  initial declarations can be reconciled with purportedly verbatim quotations of  what Bae purportedly said in their reply declarations.    In order to establish fraud, plaintiff must demonstrate (i)  misrepresentation(s); (ii) knowledge of falsity; (iii) intent to defraud; (iv) justifiable  reliance, and (v) damages. (Small v. Fritz Cos. Inc. (2003) 30 Cal.4th  167, 173.) The evidence discussed above demonstrates that there is competing  evidence regarding whether there was fraud in the election, including with  respect to what, if anything, was said to Kim or Choe, whether any statements  by Bae were made with an intent to defraud, and whether Kim or Choe relied on  any such statements or had some other reasons to vote for defendants as  directors.    Accordingly, the Court shall continue the hearing in this  matter for the purpose of receiving live testimony, subject to  cross-examination, regarding the issues of fraud. The parties should be  prepared to discuss what testimony they intend to present at any such continued  hearing. This matter is CONTNUED to 6/25/24 at 1:30 PM in Department 86  of the Stanley Mosk Courthouse.
