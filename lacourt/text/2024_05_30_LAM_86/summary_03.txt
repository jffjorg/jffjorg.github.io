And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court's tentative ruling grants the motion to quash service of summons filed by defendants Young Nae Lee and Benedict J. Pak. The Court finds that plaintiffs failed to demonstrate compliance with statutory procedures for service of summons. The Court also finds that plaintiffs failed to establish that they served defendants with the summons and First Amended Complaint as required by law. The Court notes that defendants may not have been personally served with the summons and First Amended Complaint, and that substitute service may not have been effectuated.

The Court also rules on the hearing regarding the validity of the election of directors. The Court finds that plaintiffs must demonstrate fraud in order to avoid the conclusive presumption that the election was valid. The Court notes that there is competing evidence regarding whether there was fraud in the election, and that the Court shall continue the hearing to receive live testimony regarding the issues of fraud. The Court sets the continued hearing for 6/25/24 at 1:30 PM.
