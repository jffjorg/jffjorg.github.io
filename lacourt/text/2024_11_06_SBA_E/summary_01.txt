* The Court exercises its discretion to consider the motion on its merits

**Significant Statements**

* "What seems beyond doubt is that the Legislature enacted a scheme distinguishing between – and decidedly not lumping together – claims of professional negligence and neglect." (Winn v. Pioneer Medical Group, Inc. (2016) 63 Cal. 4th 148, 58)
