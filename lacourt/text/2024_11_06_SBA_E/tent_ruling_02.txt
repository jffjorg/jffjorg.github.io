JUDICIAL
NOTICE
            
The Court may take judicial notice of records
of (1) any court of this state or (2) any court of record of the United States
or of any state of the United States. (Evid. Code § 452 subd. (d).) The Court
may also take judicial notice of “Official acts of the legislative, executive,
and judicial departments of the United States and of any state of the United
States.” (Evid. Code § 452 subd. (c).)
 
Defendant requests that the Court take notice
of the existence and contents of the Verified Petition for Declaratory and Injunctive
Relief Ordering Compliance with California Public Records Act, Government Code
§ 6258, the existence and contents of the Defendant’s Answer to the Petition
for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief filed in LASC Case No. 22TRCP00251, the
existence and contents of the Declaration of Esther Kim in support of the Defendant’s
Motion for Summary Judgment filed in LASC Case No. 22TRCP00251, and the fact
that according to the Torrance Online Citizen Portal for the City of Torrance,
the status of the Building Permit Application for the Property identified as BLD24-000649
is “out for corrections” and was “picked up by Esse Kim.”
 
The Court grants these requests.
 
 
LEGAL STANDARD
A demurrer can be used only to challenge
defects that appear on the face of the pleading under attack or from matters
outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable. (Blank v. Kirwan
(1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) “To survive a demurrer, the complaint need only
allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action; each evidentiary fact that
might eventually form part of the plaintiff’s proof need not be alleged.” (C.A.
v. William S. Hart Union High School Dist. (2012) 
53 Cal.4th 861, 872.) For the purpose of testing the sufficiency of
the cause of action, the demurrer admits the truth of all material facts
properly pleaded. (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist. (1992) 2 Cal.4th
962, 966-967.) A demurrer “does not admit contentions, deductions or
conclusions of fact or law.” (Daar v. Yellow Cab Co. (1967) 67 Cal.2d
695, 713.) 
 
A pleading is uncertain if it is ambiguous or
unintelligible. (Code Civ. Proc., §
430.10, subd. (f).) A demurrer for uncertainty may lie if the
failure to label the parties and claims renders the complaint so confusing
defendant cannot tell what he or she is supposed to respond to. (Williams v.
Beechnut Nutrition Corp. (1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 135, 139, fn. 2.) However,
“[a] demurrer for uncertainty is strictly construed, even where a complaint is
in some respects uncertain because ambiguities can be clarified under modern
discovery procedures.” (Khoury v. Maly’s of California, Inc. (1993) 14
Cal.App.4th 612, 616.) 
 
 
DISCUSSION 
            Pursuant
to the California Public Records Act and the California Constitution,
Petitioner seeks to make a copy of a “revised set of records” for the Minor Hillside
Exemption Permit Application pertaining to the real property located at 139 Via
Alameda, Redondo Beach, CA (Property) identified by the CITY as MHE 23-00021:
A0.0 – Coversheet & Site Plan
A2.1 – 1st Floor Plan – Date 10:20:23
A2.3 – 2nd Floor Plan – Date 10:20:23
A2.5 – Roof Plan – Date 10:2:23
A3.1 – Elevations – Date 1-14-24.
(See Petition, ¶¶1, 6 – 17, 23, 32.) Petitioner also seeks to make
copies of documents contained in the Building Permit Applications for the property
identified as BLD24-00649 and BLD00650. (Petition ¶ 25.)
 
Defendant demurs to
the TAC on the grounds that Petitioner has failed to join a necessary party.
 
Meet and confer
 
Before filing a
demurrer, “the demurring party shall meet and confer in person or by telephone
with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the
purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve
the objections to be raised in the demurrer.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41 subd.
(a).)
 
On September 5,
2024, Defendant’s Counsel spoke with Petitioner regarding the demurrer.
(Guerrero Decl. ¶ 2.) Therefore, the Court finds that Defendant has satisfied
the meet and confer requirement.
 
Joinder
 
The Code of Civil
Procedure section 389 requires that a person be joined as a party “if (1) in
his absence complete relief cannot be accorded among those already parties or
(2) he claims an interest relating to the subject of the action and is so
situated that the disposition of the action in his absence may (i) as a
practical matter impair or impede his ability to protect that interest or (ii)
leave any of the persons already parties subject to a substantial risk of
incurring double, multiple, or otherwise inconsistent obligations by reason of
his claimed interest.” (Code Civ. Proc § 389, subd. (a).) A person meeting
these requirements is often referred to as a “necessary party.” (Bowles v.
Superior Court (1955) 44 Cal.2d 574, 583, 283 P.2d 704; Quantification
Settlement Agreement Cases (2011) 201 Cal.App.4th 758, 848, 134 Cal.Rptr.3d
274.)
 
Defendant argues
that complete relief cannot be granted to the Petitioner without including the
design professionals and owner of the property, such as Esther Kim Design, as
indispensable parties. (Code Civ. Proc. § 389 subd. (a)(b); In re Marriage
of Ramirez (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 336, 345.) These parties are essential
because they hold property rights and monetary interests in the project plans
and drawings (see e.g., Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 61503.)  Given that the building plans are "out
for correction," meaning they are currently with Esther Kim Design for
revisions, any order regarding the plans would directly impact their interests.
Therefore, Defendant contends that Esther Kim Design and other relevant
professionals must be joined.
 
In opposition, Petitioner
argues that complete relief can be given to Petitioner if Petitioner is allowed
to use his own equipment to copy the documents at issue. Furthermore, Petitioner
states that in his First Amended Complaint, which has not been filed with the
Court, Petitioner only requests to make copies of the documents Defendant
currently has possession of. 
 
            In reply, Defendant argues that Petitioner's First
Amended Verified Petition, referenced in his Opposition, is not on the court’s
docket, making it unclear if it was officially submitted. Petitioner does not
contest the distinct property and pecuniary interests of design professionals
in the plans, nor that these interests differ from Defendant’s and are not
adequately represented. Instead, Petitioner suggests design professionals
should file a separate lawsuit to protect their rights but incorrectly claims
this must be in federal court. (Opposition pp. 6-7.) Defendant counters that
federal jurisdiction only applies if a federal issue appears on the petition's
face. (Scholastic Entm’t, Inc. v. Fox Entm’t Group, Inc. (9th Cir. 2003)
336 F.3d 982, 986.) However, because federal copyright law is not an essential
element in proving Petitioner’s argument under the California Public Records
Act, California Government Code section 7920.000, or the California
Constitution, the petition does not arise out of federal copyright law, and
therefore, the court would not lose jurisdiction if Esther Kim Designs was
joined.
 
            The plans that the Petition seeks to copy are currently
in the possession of Esther Kim Designs, and Esther Kim Designs holds property
rights to the plans. Therefore, Esther Kim Designs is a necessary party because
the Court cannot grant relief to Petitioner as the plans are held by a third
party. Furthermore, Esther Kim Designs holds proprietary rights to the plans,
and not joining them to this suit may open up Defendant to multiple
inconsistent obligations. (Request for Judicial Notice Exhibit D ¶ 8.) While Petitioner
argues that in the FAC, he clarifies that he only seeks documents Defendant
currently possesses, Petitioner has not filed the FAC. Furthermore, Petitioner
has not rebutted that failing to join Esther Kim Designs may lead to multiple
inconsistent obligations for Defendant or impair Esther Kim Designs' ability to
protect its interest. Last, the Court finds that joining Esther Kim Designs
would not cause the Court to lose jurisdiction over the case as this case does
not arise out of federal copyright law. (Scholastic Entm’t, Inc., supra, 336
F.3d 982, 986.)
 
            Therefore, the Court sustains the Demurrer with leave to
amend.
