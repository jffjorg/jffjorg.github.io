Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling sustaining the demurrer filed by the defendant, the City of Torrance, and granting the defendant leave to amend. The demurrer was filed in response to a petition filed by the plaintiff, G. Joseph Buck, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief related to a building permit application. The defendant argued that the petition was defective because it failed to join necessary parties, including design professionals and the owner of the property. The plaintiff argued that he only seeks to make copies of documents that the defendant currently possesses and that he does not need to join the design professionals or the owner of the property. The judge found that the design professionals and the owner of the property are necessary parties because they hold property rights and monetary interests in the project plans and drawings. The judge also found that joining these parties would not cause the court to lose jurisdiction over the case. The judge granted the defendant's demurrer and allowed the plaintiff to amend his petition to include the necessary parties.
