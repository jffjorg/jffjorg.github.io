Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling awards Plaintiff Timothy Jang, M.D. $3,604,544.25 in reasonable attorney fees. The court reviewed Plaintiff's motion for attorney fees and Defendant's opposition to the motion. The court accepted expert witness Grant D. Stiefel's proposed reductions to Plaintiff's requested attorney fees, with the exception of certain deductions. The court found that Plaintiff's counsel worked on contingency and faced challenges in the case, including the need to establish Dr. Jang's claim for failure to promote and the risk of loss due to the contingency model. The court applied a 1.5 lodestar multiplier to determine the reasonable attorney fees.
