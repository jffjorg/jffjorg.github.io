The Court awards Plaintiff $3,604,544.25 in reasonable attorney
fees. 
 
On 7/7/205, Plaintiff Timothy Jang M.D. (Plaintiff) filed suit
against the County of Los Angeles d/b/a Harbor UCLA Medical Center and Roger
Lewis M.D., alleging: (1) Health and Safety Code section 1278.5; (2) Labor Code
section 98.6 and 1102.5; (3) Business and Professions Code section 2056; (4)
discrimination; (5) retaliation; (6) harassment; and (7) failure to prevent
harassment, discrimination, and/or retaliation.
 
            On 8/20/2024, Plaintiff moved for
attorney fees of $6,445,474.60 (with an adjusted 2.0 lodestar multiplier) and
paralegal expenses in the amount of $333,202.50.
 
Legal
Standard
 
The party claiming attorneys’ fees must establish entitlement to
such fees and the reasonableness of the fees claimed.  (Civic
Western Corporation v. Zila Industries, Inc. (1977) 66 Cal.App.3d 1, 16.)
“Except as attorney’s fees are specifically provided for by statute, the
measure and mode of compensation of attorneys and counselors at law is left to
the agreement, express or implied, of the parties[.]” (CCP § 1021.)
 
“It is well established that the determination of what constitutes
reasonable attorney fees is committed to the discretion of the trial court,
whose decision cannot be reversed in the absence of an abuse of
discretion.”  (Melnyk v. Robledo (1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 618, 623.)  In exercising its
discretion, the court should consider a number of factors, including the nature
of the litigation, its difficulty, the amount involved, the skill required in
handling the matter, the attention given, the success or failure, and the
resulting judgment.  (Id.) 
 
In determining what constitutes a reasonable compensation for an
attorney who has rendered services in connection with a legal proceeding, the
court may and should consider the nature of the litigation, its difficulty, the
amount involved, the skill required and the skill employed in handling the
litigation, the attention given, the success of the attorneys’ efforts, their
learning, their age, and their experience in the particular type of work
demanded the intricacies and importance of the litigation, the labor and
necessity for skilled legal training and ability in trying the cause, and the
time consumed. (Stokus v. Marsh (1990)
217 Cal.App.3d 647, 657.) 
 
In determining the proper amount of fees to award, courts use the
lodestar method.  The lodestar figure is calculated
by multiplying the total number of reasonable hours expended by the reasonable
hourly rate.  “Fundamental to its
determination … [is] a careful compilation of the time spent and reasonable
hourly compensation of each attorney … in the presentation of the case.”  (Serrano
v. Priest (1977) 20 Cal.3d 25, 48 (Serrano
III).)  A reasonable hourly rate must
reflect the skill and experience of the attorney.  (Id.
at 49.)  “Prevailing
parties are compensated for hours reasonably spent on fee-related
issues.  A fee request that appears
unreasonably inflated is a special circumstance permitting the trial court to
reduce the award or deny one altogether.” 
(Serrano v. Unruh (1982) 32
Cal.3d 621, 635 (Serrano IV); see
also Weber v. Langholz (1995) 39 Cal.App.4th
1578, 1587 (“The trial court could make its own evaluation of the reasonable
worth of the work done in light of the nature of the case, and of the
credibility of counsel’s declaration unsubstantiated by time records and
billing statements.”)
 
Reasonable attorney fees should be based on an
objective standard of reasonableness, i.e., the market value of services
rendered, not on some notion of cost incurred. (PLCM Group, Inc. v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1090.)  The value of legal services performed in a
case is a matter in which the trial court has its own expertise.  (Id.
at 1096.)  The trial court may make its
own determination of the value of the services contrary to, or without the
necessity for, expert testimony.  (Id.) 
The
trial court makes its determination after consideration of a number of factors,
including the nature of the litigation, its difficulty, the amount involved,
the skill required in its handling, the skill employed, the attention given,
the success or failure, and other circumstances in the case.  (Id.)

In opposition, Defendant submitted an expert declaration from Grant
D. Stiefel, a full-time consultant and testifying expert in the field of
attorneys’ fees and a member of the California State Bar, to establish the
unreasonableness of Plaintiff’s requested rates and total hours. In his
declaration, Mr. Stiefel recommended the following rates:
 
-         
Lawrence
A. Bohm: $900/hr
-         
Kelsey
K. Ciarimboli: $500/hr
-         
Brandon
P. Ortiz: $500/hr
-         
Bradley
J. Mancuso: $600/hr
-         
Kyle A.
Pruner: $475/hr
-         
Jack C.
Brouwer: $350/hr 
-         
Ruth Ann
Reeves: $250/hr
-         
M. Noah
Cowart: $250/hr
-         
Jenni
Burton: $250/hr
-         
Edward Li:
$250/hr
-         
Michael
Patterson: $250/hr
 
Moreover,
his declaration set forth following the analysis:
 
-         
78
percent of all billing entries—memorialize the sending or receiving of an email
or text message. [Id., ¶ 43]. Plaintiff’s counsel billed 1,386 hours to
send and receive emails and text messages, which is the equivalent of seven
months of full-time billable work and represents 31 percent of all time billed.
[Id., ¶ 44]. In total, Plaintiff claims $962,875 in hourly fees—
$1,925,750 with multiplier—just to send and receive emails and texts in this
case. [Id., ¶ 45].
 
-         
Plaintiff’s
counsel would record as much as seventeen billable hours per day for email and
text communications. 
 
-         
Plaintiff’s
counsel billed 328 hours and seeks $265,191 in hourly fees ($530,382 with
multiplier) for conversations and emails/texts with Dr. Jang.
 
-         
Plaintiff’s
counsel also billed 286 hours to communications (texts, emails, phone calls,
meetings, etc.) with defense counsel, for which Plaintiff seeks $206,485 in
hourly fees ($412,970 with multiplier).
 
-         
Plaintiff’s
counsel billed 1,003 hours to internal communications (conferences, phone
calls, meetings, discussions, and thousands-upon-thousands of individual texts
and emails) between the lawyers, paralegals, and office staff at Bohm Law
Group. This is more than six months of full-time billable work for counsel to
do nothing but talk about the case,
 
-         
Plaintiffs’
counsel also billed for clerical and secretarial work, including filing
documents with the court, scheduling court reporters, ordering transcripts,
saving documents to the firm’s file system, proofreading, accounting,
organizing, and word processing. Plaintiff seeks $147,897 in fees—$295,794 with
multiplier—for 288 hours of clerical/secretarial work.
 
-         
Plaintiff’s
counsel also billed for a substantial amount of travel time: 166 hours,
reflecting $131,920 in claimed fees (or $263,840 with multiplier).
 
-         
Counsel
also spent a massive amount of time preparing their motion for attorneys’ fees.
In addition to the 220 hours that Plaintiffs’ counsel billed to “compile and
audit” time for the fee motion, counsel billed an additional 97 hours to
discuss and draft the fee motion. 12 In total, counsel claims 317 hours and
$235,389 in fees for the attorneys’ fee motion, which is excessive. 
 
-         
Plaintiff’s
counsel billed 50 hours to the Motion for Equitable Relief, for which they
claim $33,803 in fees.
 
Based on
his review, he recommended the following fee model:
 
-         
A 70%
deduction to the 9,352 line-item entries for sending and receiving emails and
text messages. [Paragraphs 43-56.] 
 
-         
A 100%
deduction to the time billed to “compile and audit” time for the fee motion.
[Paragraphs 57-59.] 
 
-         
A 50%
deduction to the time billed for internal attorney conferencing. [Paragraphs
63-67.]
 
-         
A 100%
deduction for non-compensable office overhead, clerical, and secretarial work
[Paragraphs 69-70].
 
-         
A 100%
deduction for the time billed for Attorney Brandon Ortiz to attend trial as
third-chair counsel. [Paragraphs 71-75].
 
-         
A 50%
deduction to travel time (and a 100% discount for the travel time billed by
Jack Brouwer, who served as the trial team’s on-call driver at a rate of up to
$600/hour. [Paragraphs 76-81]. 
 
-         
A 50%
deduction for the time billed to discuss and draft the fee motion. [Paragraph
82.] 
 
-         
A 100%
deduction to time billed to Plaintiff’s Motion for Equitable Relief and for
work attributed to the dismissed defendants. [Paragraph 83a].
 
After applying the foregoing deductions and using the recommended
hourly rates, Mr. Stiefel set forth a maximum recommended lodestar of
$1,648,283 (reflecting 2,847 hours of compensable work).
 
After review, the Court accepts Mr. Stiefel’s proposed reductions
with the exception of: (1) the deduction for Attorney Brandon Ortiz to attend
trial; (2) the 70% deduction to billings for emails and texts; and (3) the 100%
deduction for time billed to Plaintiff’s motion for equitable relief and for
work attributed to the dismissed defendants. The Court is not persuaded that it
was unreasonable for three trial attorneys to attend for an employment dispute
like this. While the Court finds it appropriate to reduce some time billed for
communication, the Court finds a 70% reduction to be excessive, given that
communication is an essential aspect of litigation. Finally, fees were actually
incurred in order to prepare the equitable relief motion. While the Court finds
the 50 hours claimed for that motion to be unreasonable on its face, the Court
finds only a 50% reduction to be appropriate. The Court agrees that fees
incurred in connection with dismissed defendants are not properly recovered
here.  
 
Accordingly, the Court calculates a lodestar amount of $2,403,029.50
in reasonable attorney fees.  This
reflects the $1,648,283 sum set forth by Mr. Stiefel, plus adds back $64,025 in
fees billed by Mr. Ortiz as third-chair counsel, plus $673,820 in recoverable fees
billed for communications, plus $16,901.50 in reasonable fees incurred for the
equitable relief motion (i.e., 50% of the $33,803 initially billed.) 
 
Moreover, the Court finds a 1.5 lodestar to be appropriate here.
Relevant factors to determine whether an enhancement is appropriate include (1)
the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, (2) the skill displayed
in presenting them, (3) the extent to which the nature of the litigation
precluded other employment by the attorneys, (4) the contingent nature of the
fee award.  (Ketchum v. Moses
(2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1132.) Here, counsel worked on contingency, and there
were a number of factors which presented challenges. As noted by Plaintiff, Dr.
Jang is a doctor, who may garner less sympathy from a jury, and the case was
against public entity. Moreover, Dr. Jang’s claim for failure to promote can be
difficult to establish.  Trial here was
exceptionally time consuming and laborious, and presented considerable risk to
counsel given the continency model. The level of skill demonstrated by
Plaintiff’s counsel was exceptional. 
 
 Applying the 1.5 multiplier,
the Court awards $3,604,544.25 in reasonable attorney fees. 
 
 
 
It is so
ordered.
