And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on the defendant's demurrer and motion to strike in a case brought by Peter Stone and Barbara Stone against Green Pastures Group, Inc. and John M. Cohen. The plaintiffs allege that the defendants violated Business and Professions Code section 7159, were negligent, engaged in unfair business practices, and breached a contract. The defendants argued that the plaintiffs cannot state a claim against them and that the plaintiffs do not have standing to assert claims against the defendants in their personal capacities. The judge found that the plaintiffs have sufficient allegations to support their claims and that the defendants' demurrer is therefore overruled. The judge also denied the defendants' motion to strike certain allegations from the complaint.
