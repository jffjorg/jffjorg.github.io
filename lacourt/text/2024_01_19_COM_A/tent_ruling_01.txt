[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING
PLAINTIFF’S REQUEST FOR COURT JUDGMENT AGAINST DEFENDANT, WESTLAND ARCHITECTURE
AND DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION (MODIFIED)
 
      The
Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”), filed on August 29, 2018, alleges that
Plaintiff owns residential real property located at 925 E. Stockton Avenue in
Compton (the Compton Property). Defendants allegedly engaged in fraudulent acts
to fund three separate loans secured by the real property at issue. Defendants
allegedly presented the loan as a non-owner-occupied transaction, although
Plaintiff resided at the home. Plaintiff alleges claims for fraud, constructive
fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, and unfair business
practices.
      The
clerk entered default against Defendant, Westland Architecture and Development
Corporation (“Westland”), on November 21, 2023. Plaintiff requests judgment of
$62,300 plus prejudgment interest, attorney’s fees, costs, and punitive
damages. Plaintiff personally served the Statement of Punitive Damages on Westland.
      The Court’s file reflects that the
following Defendants have been named but have not answered: Adenheim, Inc.;
Ester Perez; and Unicitizens Financial. Defendant, Shobert Vartan answered the
complaint, but a bankruptcy petition stays the action against Vartan. The clerk
has entered defaults against Defendants, Fidelity Mortgage Finance Corp and
Mpire Property Services, LLC. Plaintiff requests judgment against Westland
only. Plaintiff must file a dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is
not sought or file an application for separate judgment against those parties (including
DOE defendants) under Code of Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a
showing of grounds for each judgment. (Cal. Rules of Court 3.1800.) 
      Plaintiff
has otherwise substantiated principal damages of $62,300. Plaintiff is also
entitled to recover a statutory penalty of $500 and attorney’s fees for Westland’s
inducement of a contract for a work of improvement based on false or fraudulent
representations. (Bus. & Prof. Code, § 7160.)  
      Plaintiff
also requests imposition of punitive damages of $181,500.00. Punitive damages
based the amount of the fraudulent profiteer’s ill-gotten gains is proper
assuming the defendant has the ability to pay, Plaintiff has not proffered such
evidence. (Kenly v. Ukegawa (1993) 16 Cal.App.4th 49, 58 ["Lacking ability, the
purpose of punitive damages is not served when the award is based solely on
high paper profit from the fraudulent transaction."].) Therefore, punitive
damages are not recoverable. 
      Prejudgment interest is
re-calculated at $17.07 per day based on the total principal damage sustained
($62,300 x .10 / 365) for total prejudgment interest of $36,939.48 (2164 days x
$17.07 per day) for interest accrued from the date the complaint was filed to
the date Plaintiff submitted this request on December 22, 2023.  
      The
Court awards attorney’s fees based on Los Angeles County Local Rule 3.214 in
the amount of $2,136 (2 percent of the excess of the principal balance over
$50,000 + 1,890). The amount of costs is modified to correct a calculation
error ($230  not $250.00). 
      Therefore,
if Plaintiff dismisses all remaining defendants against whom default was not
entered, the Court is inclined to award judgment against Westland as follows:

$62,300




Penalty


500.00




Prejudgment interest


36,939.48
