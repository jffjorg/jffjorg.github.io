And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the plaintiff, Philip Alvarez, in the case against Westland Architecture and Development Corporation. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant engaged in fraudulent acts to fund three separate loans secured by a residential property in Compton, California. The plaintiff is seeking judgment of $62,300, plus prejudgment interest, attorney's fees, costs, and punitive damages.

The court has entered default against the defendant, Westland Architecture and Development Corporation, and has ruled that the plaintiff is entitled to principal damages of $62,300. The court has also awarded the plaintiff a statutory penalty of $500 and attorney's fees of $2,136.

However, the court has denied the plaintiff's request for punitive damages, finding that the amount of the fraudulent profiteer's ill-gotten gains is not sufficient to support an award of punitive damages. The court has also recalculated the prejudgment interest and has awarded the plaintiff $36,939.48 in prejudgment interest.

Finally, the court has awarded the plaintiff costs of $230, which includes process server and motion and service fees. The total judgment against Westland Architecture and Development Corporation is $102,105.48.
