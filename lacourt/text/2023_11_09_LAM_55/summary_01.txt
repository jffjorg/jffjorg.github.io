```

And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted the Plaintiff's motion for reconsideration of the court's order granting Defendant's motion to compel arbitration. The Judge has lifted the stay and denied the motion to compel arbitration. The Judge's ruling is based on the fact that the doctrine of equitable estoppel is no longer good law in this context, and that an automobile manufacturer's warranties are not part of the sales contract between a buyer and the dealer. The Judge also ruled that a non-party to a contract cannot be a third-party beneficiary of the contract if the contract does not directly benefit the non-party. Therefore, the Judge has concluded that the Defendant cannot enforce the arbitration clause in the Retail Installment Sales Contract and that the Plaintiff's Song-Beverly Act claims should not be compelled to arbitration.
