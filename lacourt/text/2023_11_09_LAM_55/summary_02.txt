And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case 23STCV07536. The Defendant's unopposed demurrer is sustained with leave to amend, and the motion to strike is granted. The Plaintiff filed an official form Complaint with the Breach of Contract box checked at paragraph 8 and "contractual fraud" written in at paragraph 1. However, the Complaint fails to attach any page having a cause of action and is completely devoid of any allegations supporting any cause of action. The Court finds that the Plaintiff's lack of specificity in alleging cause of action and failure to plead adequately essential elements of cause of action are grounds for sustaining the demurrer. The Judge grants the Plaintiff 20 days' leave to amend the Complaint.
