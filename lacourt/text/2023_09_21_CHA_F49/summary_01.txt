And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the defendants, GG&C 1, LLC, et al. to the second amended complaint filed by the plaintiff, Duda Adams. The defendants have challenged the eighth and eleventh causes of action in the complaint, which relate to quiet title and adverse possession. The judge has sustained the demurrer with leave to amend, meaning that the plaintiff has 20 days to amend the complaint to address the defects raised by the defendants. The judge has also granted the plaintiff leave to substitute the eleventh cause of action for resulting trust and equitable mortgage, but has declined to allow the plaintiff to substitute any new causes of action. The judge has warned the plaintiff that any further requests for leave to amend will be considered a concession to the inability to bring the claim.
