## English Summary

The judge tentatively rules to sustain the demurrer filed by Defendant GG&C 1, LLC and David Adams against Plaintiff Duda Adams' eighth and eleventh causes of action in the second amended complaint, which are for quiet title and adverse possession respectively. 

The judge finds that Plaintiff has not adequately supported these claims. Specifically, the Defendant argues that Plaintiff has not provided a clear legal basis for the quiet title claim and has failed to explicitly allege the payment of property taxes for the adverse possession claim, a requirement under California law.

The Plaintiff requests leave to amend the complaint to address these deficiencies. The Plaintiff proposes to incorporate cultural context regarding Romani (Gypsy) traditions into the quiet title claim and substitute the adverse possession claim with a claim for resulting trust and equitable mortgage.

The judge grants leave to amend the complaint within 20 days but cautions that this will be the third amendment. Any further amendments will be considered a concession that the Plaintiff cannot properly state these claims. If no third amended complaint is filed, the Defendant will be ordered to answer the remaining causes of action in the second amended complaint within ten days of the amendment deadline.

**English Summary:**

The judge has ruled that the defendant's challenge to two causes of action in the plaintiff's lawsuit is valid, but the plaintiff is given the opportunity to revise their complaint. The judge found issues with the plaintiff's arguments for quiet title and adverse possession, specifically the lack of a clear legal basis for quiet title and the failure to properly allege payment of taxes for adverse possession.

The plaintiff is given 20 days to revise their complaint and address these issues. They can replace the adverse possession claim with a claim for "resulting trust and equitable mortgage," but they cannot add any other new causes of action. If the plaintiff fails to file a revised complaint, the defendant will be required to respond to the remaining claims.  This case is still in the early stages of litigation.
