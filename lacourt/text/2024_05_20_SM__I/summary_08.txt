```

And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the defendant. The demurrer is sustained as to the first cause of action, as the complaint does not allege that the defendant's dog bit the plaintiff. The court notes that the statute mentioned in the complaint, Civil Code section 3342, is not applicable in this case. The court also finds that the plaintiff has adequately established a cause of action for breach of the duty of care, as the dog's sudden and unprovoked attack suggests a vicious nature. The judge grants leave to amend the complaint to allege that the plaintiff was bitten, and if not, the demurrer will be denied. The judge also notes that the plaintiff can have 30 days to amend the complaint, and if not, the defendant will have 30 days to answer the complaint.
