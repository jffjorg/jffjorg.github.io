 Case Number:  23SMCV03052    Hearing Date:   May 20, 2024    Dept:  I The unopposed motion to set aside default is GRANTED.  Defendant states that after being served she
informed her carrier.  The insurer,
however, failed to send the documents to counsel and did not follow up until
March 8, 2024—after default had been entered. 
After March 8, 2024, counsel was assigned.  The court finds that the facts as established
are within section 473 and that excusable neglect and inadvertence has been
sufficiently demonstrated.  That is
especially true in that the strong policy in California is to resolve cases on
their merits.  The motion is therefore
GRANTED and defendant is ordered to file her proposed answer within 3 court
days.
