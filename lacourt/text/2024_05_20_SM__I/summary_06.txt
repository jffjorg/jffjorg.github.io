And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling grants the unopposed motion to set aside default. The defendant argues that after being served, she informed her carrier, but the insurer failed to send the documents to counsel and did not follow up until March 8, 2024, after default had been entered. The court finds that the defendant's failure to respond was due to excusable neglect and inadvertence, especially given California's strong policy to resolve cases on their merits. The motion is therefore granted, and the defendant is ordered to file her proposed answer within 3 court days.
