And here is the English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has reviewed the joint statement of remaining issues and believes that many of them need to be resolved before a jury venire is called. The Judge suggests that plaintiff make an offer of proof as to what parol evidence, if admitted, would show the words of a contract or contracts to mean. The Judge would be inclined to allow the parol evidence to be admitted if the words are reasonably susceptible to the meaning ascribed. The Judge notes that the contracts on their face are written agreements and did not see an integration clause in either of the original contracts.

The Judge discusses the measure of damages theories, including lost revenue to the licensor, reasonable license fee, and disgorgement of specific profits. The Judge also notes that rescission is another issue, but it may not be possible to put the parties back where they were in 1999. The Judge prefers live testimony, but will allow Zoom testimony with a stipulation and under specific conditions.

The Judge requires each party to disclose its order of witnesses to be called two court days before calling the witness. The Judge also notes that the court will review the objections to the updated joint witness list and will need to hear from the parties on new exhibits. The Judge does not understand issue 13 and will need to hear argument on issues 14 and 18. The Judge will address the jury instructions separately and will address at least some of the issues with the parties.
