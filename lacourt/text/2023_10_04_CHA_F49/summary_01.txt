## English Summary

This tentative ruling addresses a motion filed by Plaintiff Rolando Urquidiez to compel Ford Motor Company to produce further documents related to a claimed defective transmission in his 2019 Ford F-150.  

The Court ultimately granted the motion in part, finding that Plaintiff is entitled to documents related to the specific vehicle and transmission defect, but denied the motion in part, finding that Plaintiff's requests for broader categories of documents were too vague and overreaching.

The Court emphasized its policy of limiting discovery in lemon law cases to the specific make and model year of the vehicle in question, and the specific defect alleged. The Court found that Plaintiff's requests for "all documents" related to "engine defects" were too broad, especially since the only claim currently in the case is related to the transmission.


The Court also noted that while Ford had provided some documents related to "engine defects," this production was sufficient and not subject to further compelled discovery.  

The Court ultimately granted the motion as to requests for documents related to the specific vehicle's history, repair procedures, and repurchase/exchange policies, but denied the motion for other requests deemed overly broad or lacking justification.

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel further responses to request for production of documents. The plaintiff, Rolando Urquidiez, is seeking to compel Ford Motor Company to produce documents related to the transmission defect in the 2019 F-150 vehicle. The judge has granted the motion as to numbers 3, 96, and 98, which relate to internal documents regarding the transmission defect, and denied it as to the remainder.

The judge has also adopted a policy of limiting discovery to the make and model year, with further limitation to the transmission defect, as exclusively and particularly alleged in the complaint. This policy is intended to facilitate robust adjudication of the case, without imposing any burden on the defendant to determine the cause of the purported defects, while also allowing the plaintiff the opportunity to investigate.

The judge has denied the motion in part, finding that certain requests for production are overly broad or lack sufficient justification. The judge has also invited the plaintiff to reexamine motions possibly filed prior to a change in the disposition of the action, and utilize the reply as an opportunity to update arguments possibly rendered moot.

English text:
The tentative ruling is for Case Number 23CHCV00081, with a hearing date of October 4, 2023, in Department F49. The plaintiff, Rolando Urquidiez, alleges that a 2019 certified pre-owned Ford F-150 vehicle has a defective transmission. On January 11, 2023, the plaintiff filed a complaint for Violations of Civil Code section 1793.2, Breach of Implied Warranty of Merchantability, Fraudulent Inducement – Concealment, Negligent Repair, Violation of Consumer Legal Remedies Act, and Violation of Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act. Galpin Motors, Inc. answered the complaint on March 3, 2023. The court overruled the demurrer of Ford Motor Company to the third cause of action for Violation of Civil Code section 1793.2, and sustained the demurrer to the fifth cause of action for Fraudulent Inducement – Concealment with leave to amend. Plaintiff filed a first amended complaint on June 20, 2023. Ford Motor Company Answered the remaining causes of action in the first amended complaint on September 15, 2023.

The plaintiff moves to compel further responses to request for production of documents, numbers 1-3, 7, 12-13, 44, 47-48, 50, 52, 69, 83, 91, 96, 98, 120-121, 128, 130-131, and 144-148. The dispute involves the request for general categories of documents to which Plaintiff alleges unmeritorious objections. Ford Motor Company opposes the motion, maintaining that the responses, some of which included objections to the 2908 categories of documents, were appropriate, and that the sought-after discovery is overly broad and unreasonable. Ford produced documents regarding the subject model year of the vehicle and transmission but declines to produce documents outside the year model to unrelated defects.

The court denies in part and grants in part the motion. The court finds that certain items lack justification for production, such as numbers 50, 52, 121, 128, 130, and 131, due to overbroad and insufficiently defined parameters. Number 99 seeks information beyond the defined scope of the action, while number 132 lacks justification for dealership agreement information given the lack of any challenge regarding arbitration and the lack of any remaining punitive damages claim with the discharge of the fraud claim. Numbers 145, 146, 147, and 148 also lack justification beyond the agreed-upon production based upon a non-existent punitive damages claim.

The court cannot determine how publicly available information regarding consumer reports as to Ford vehicles requires production from Ford in the information is equally available. The court accepts the definition and parameters established barring a more concisely, specifically articulated, factually supported basis justifying the otherwise general term of “engine defect.”

The motion is therefore granted as to number 3, 96, and 98, and denied as to the remainder. The court invites Plaintiff to reexamine motions possibly filed prior to a change in the disposition of the action and inform the court of any potential production occurring after the filing of the motion. Sanctions are denied as to Plaintiff. Plaintiff is to give notice.
