And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is to deny the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to request for production of documents in part, and grant it in part. The motion is denied as to numbers 50, 52, 121, 128, 130, and 131 due to overbroad or insufficiently defined parameters. The court will limit discovery to the make and model year, 2019 F-150, with further limitation to the transmission defect. The court will allow discovery into the relevant make and model year for all impacted systems or parts. The court will also deny the motion as to numbers 145, 146, 147, and 148 due to lack of justification beyond the agreed upon production. The Judge invites the plaintiff to reexamine motions possibly filed prior to a change in the disposition of the action, and utilize the reply as an opportunity to update arguments possibly rendered moot.
