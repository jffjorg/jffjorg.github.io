    - The court finds Defendant's lien sale process was invalid.
    - The court finds the balance of equities favors granting a preliminary injunction prohibiting Defendant from selling or transferring the property. 

**English Summary:**

The judge is inclined to grant Plaintiff Gary Nevieux's request for a preliminary injunction to prevent Defendant Douglas Hews from selling or transferring his property. 

The judge finds that Plaintiff is likely to succeed in proving his claim of conversion because Defendant improperly denied him access to his property and conducted an invalid lien sale. The judge also found that it would be unfair to allow Defendant to sell the property while the lawsuit is pending, as Plaintiff has a strong likelihood of regaining ownership.

However, the judge is not ordering Defendant to immediately return the property to Plaintiff. The case will proceed to a trial where the full merits of the claim will be decided.
