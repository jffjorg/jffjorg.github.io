SUMMARY
OF ACTION
Plaintiff
Rolando Urquidieza alleges a 2019 certified pre-owned Ford F-150 vehicle
suffers from a defective transmission. On January 11, 2023, Plaintiff filed a
complaint for Violations of Civil Code section 1793.2, Breach of Implied
Warranty of Merchantability, Fraudulent Inducement – Concealment, Negligent
Repair, Violation of Consumer Legal Remedies Act, and Violation of
Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act. On March 3, 2023, Galpin Motors, Inc. answered the
complaint.
 
On
May 2, 2023, the court overruled the demurrer of Ford Motor Company to the
third cause of action for Violation of Civil Code section 1793.2, and sustained
the demurrer to the fifth cause of action for Fraudulent Inducement –
Concealment with leave to amend. Plaintiff filed a first amended complaint on
June 20, 2023. On August 23, 2023, the court sustained the demurrer to the
Fraudulent Inducement – Concealment with leave to amend. On September 15, 2023,
Ford Motor Company Answered the remaining causes of action in the first amended
complaint.
 
RULING: Denied in
Part/Granted in Part.
Plaintiff Rolando Urquidiez moves to compel further
responses to request for production of documents, numbers 1-3, 7, 12-13, 44,
47-48, 50, 52, 69, 83, 91, 96, 98, 120-121, 128, 130-131, and 144-148. The
dispute involves the request for general categories of documents to which
Plaintiff alleges unmeritorious objections. 
 
Defendant in opposition challenges the
separate statement, maintains the responses, some of which included objections
to the 2908 categories of documents were appropriate, and the sought after
discovery is overly broad and unreasonable, and Ford produced documents
regarding subject model year of the vehicle and transmission, but declines to
produce documents outside the year model to unrelated defects. 
 
Plaintiff in reply reiterates the basis
for production. 
 
Plaintiff also filed evidentiary
objections with the reply.  Plaintiff’s
request to strike the entire declaration of Jeffrey Push is denied.  Plaintiff’s evidentiary objections to the
declaration of Jeffrey Push are overruled. 

 
Plaintiff describes the categories of
documents as follows: Numbers 1-3, 7, 13, 145-148, documents “concerning” the
subject vehicle; numbers 44, 47, 48, 50, 52, 69, 144, documents regarding
“internal knowledge” of engine defects, including summaries, memoranda, power
point presentations; numbers 83 and 91, documents regarding engine defects in
the form of summaries, memoranda, and power point presentations; number 96, 98,
99, policies on buybacks and procedures; numbers 120-121, 128, 130-131,
documents regarding communications with governmental agencies and third party
suppliers; and, number 132, documents regarding Ford Motor Company dealer
agreements. 
 
Under the Song-Beverly Act, “[a] plaintiff pursuing
an action under the Act has the burden to prove that (1) the vehicle had a
nonconformity covered by the express warranty that substantially impaired the
use, value or safety of the vehicle (the nonconformity element); (2) the
vehicle was presented to an authorized representative of the manufacturer of
the vehicle for repair (the presentation element); and (3) the manufacturer or
his representative did not repair the nonconformity after a reasonable number of
repair attempts (the failure to repair element). (Civ.Code, § 1793.2; Ibrahim v. Ford Motor Co.
(1989) 214 Cal.App.3d 878, 886–887, 263 Cal.Rptr. 64.)” (Oregel v. American Isuzu Motors, Inc. (2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 1094, 1101.)
 
Due to the increasing volume of filed Lemon Law cases
in this courtroom and presumably countywide, and the pending decisions from the
California Supreme Court potentially impacting whether cases proceed to arbitration
or remain in trial courts, with de rigueur motions to compel further document
production, this court generally adheres to certain, consistent guidelines for
its cases: an approach allowing discovery into the relevant make and model year
for all impacted systems or parts, without opening the door for a general
inquiry into any and all lemon law claims filed against vehicle manufacturers
for all makes and models, including varying individual and potential system
defects. The goal is to facilitate robust adjudication of the case, without
imposing any burden on defendant to determine the cause of the purported
defects, while also allowing Plaintiff the opportunity to investigate. The
court in no way doctrinally adheres to this policy. The court established this
policy based on established practice standards common among counsel in this
field based on standards established and reviewed by practice and reviewed at
least in party by appellate courts. (Donlen
v. Ford Motor Co. (2013) 217 Cal.App.4th
138, 153-154; Oregel v. American Isuzu
Motors, Inc., supra, 90 Cal.App.4th
at p. 1104-1105.) No doubt other courts may take different approaches. The
court in no way seeks to invite comparisons with other courtrooms. The court
only notes its reasoning behind its policy.
 
On
the specific requests, the court limits discovery to the make and model year,
2019 F-150, with further limitation to the transmission defect, as exclusively
and particularly alleged in the complaint. Discovery shall include defect
information related to the vehicle itself specifically identified by vehicle
identification number. While the fraud claim is no longer part of the action,
the court still finds the policy behind lemon law claims entitles Plaintiff to
information about vehicle transmission defects without objections over the form
of request for purposes of obstreperous withholding of information. 
 
Notwithstanding
the guidelines, the court finds the justification for certain items
questionable given the offer to produce documents, the lack of any
clarification regarding whether said production occurred, a legal basis beyond
the dismissed fraud cause of action, and/or any additional factual basis for
production. The court specifically finds the offer to produce documents
relative to the make, model, specific vehicle, regarding the transmission
sufficiently complies as to numbers 1, 2, 7, 13, 44, 47, 48, 69, 83, 91, 120, 144,
145, 146, 147, and 148.
 
The
court finds the objections to numbers 50, 52, 121, 128, 130, and 131, valid on
grounds of overbroad, insufficiently defined parameters. On number 99, the
request seeks information beyond the defined scope of the action. On number
132, the court finds a lack of justification for dealership agreement
information given the lack of any challenge regarding arbitration and the lack
of any remaining punitive damages claim with the discharge of the fraud claim.
Numbers 145, 146, 147 and 148, also lacks justification beyond the agreed upon
production based upon a non-existent punitive damages claim.
 
On
numbers 120 the court also cannot determine from the motion how the publicly
available information regarding consumer reports as to Ford vehicles requires
production from Ford in the information is equally available. (Bunnell v. Sup.Ct. (1967) 254 Cal.App.2d
720, 723–724.) 
 
The
court also notes that even though the operative complaint only alleges
transmission defects, Ford also apparently provided documents regarding related
“engine defects” apparently relative to the transmission. The court therefore
accepts the definition and parameters established barring a more concisely,
specifically articulated, factually supported basis justifying the otherwise
general term of “engine defect.”
 
On
number 13, the court also finds the request overly broad, especially given the
lack of a fraud claim. On numbers 44 and 47 the court declines to consider the
supplemental declaration of Jeffrey Push or the objections and second set of
points and authorities challenging the declaration. The court finds the term
“engine defects” overbroad, especially relative to the transmission claim (see
numbers 48, 50, 52). The court also agrees that the term “all documents”
constitutes a vastly overbroad term. The motion lacks sufficient support
regardless of the supplemental opinions and objections. 
 
On
numbers 3, 96, and 98, the court finds the request justified relative to the
established parameters in that Lemon Law claims allow a party to examine the
basis of the defects, and procedures and considerations for repairs, repurchase
or exchange related to the subject make, model and year. On numbers 96, 98,
Ford needs to address internal documents rather than refer to publicly
available website information.. Any documents potentially qualifying but not
produced shall be articulated in a privilege log. (Code Civ. Proc. 2031.240,
subd. (c).) 
 
The
motion is therefore granted as to number 3, 96 and 98, and denied as to the
remainder. The court invites Plaintiff to reexamine motions possibly filed
prior to a change in the disposition of the action, and utilize the reply as an
opportunity to update arguments possibly rendered moot, and inform the court of
any potential production occurring after the filing of the motion.
 
Sanctions not requested by Ford, and
denied as to Plaintiff given the vast majority of the argument denied.
 
Plaintiff
