(1)  Motion to
  Compel Responses to Requests for Production of Documents,

(3)  Motion to

[THE FOLLOWING IS A TENTATIVE RULING IN THE ABOVE CASE]: 
 
BACKGROUND
 
On January 9, 2021, plaintiff Rita Zetino (“Plaintiff”) and defendant
Davit Andreasyan (“Defendant”) were involved in a motor vehicle accident in
which Defendant’s vehicle struck Plaintiff’s vehicle. (Complaint p. 5.)
Plaintiff thereby sustained injuries. (Ibid.) 
 
On January 9, 2023, Plaintiff initiated this lawsuit by filing a
complaint alleging causes of action for (1) motor vehicle negligence and (2)
general negligence.
 
On October 2, 2023, Defendant served three discovery requests on
Plaintiff. (Motion #1 p. 1; Motion #2 p. 1; Motion #3 p. 1.) Defendant has not
received any response to any of the three discovery requests. (Motion #1 p. 3;
Motion #3 p. 3; Motion #4 p. 3.)
 
On January 17, 2024, Defendant served a deposition notice on Plaintiff,
which scheduled the deposition for February 9, 2024, but Plaintiff failed to
appear for her deposition at that time. (Motion #2 p. 3.)
 
On February 22, 2024, Defendant brought four motions to compel: (1) a
motion to compel responses to requests for production of documents (“Motion
#1”), (2) a motion to compel plaintiff’s attendance at deposition (“Motion
#2”), (3) a motion to compel responses to form interrogatories (“Motion #3”),
and (4) a motion to compel responses to special interrogatories (“Motion #4”
and, together with Motion #1, Motion #2, and Motion #3, the “Motions”).
Plaintiff has not opposed the Motions.
ANALYSIS
 
I.          Production
of Documents, Form Interrogatories, and Special Interrogatories (Motion #1,
Motion #3, and Motion #4)
 
“If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely
response,…[t]he party propounding the interrogatories may move for an order
compelling response to the interrogatories.” (Cal. C. Civ. Proc.
§ 2030.290.) And, “a party's failure to object to interrogatories within
30 days, or such additional time as extended by the court, constitutes a waiver
of any right to object.” (Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d
902, 905.) Similarly, “[i]f a party to
whom a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or
sampling is directed fails to serve a timely response to it,… [t]he party
to whom the demand for inspection, copying, testing, or
sampling is directed waives any objection to the demand [and]…[t]he party
making the demand may move for an order compelling response to
the demand.” (Cal. C. Civ. Proc. § 2031.300.) In the absence
of any response to the discovery request, all that a motion to compel need show
is that a set of interrogatories was properly served on the opposing
party, that the time to respond has expired, and that no response of any kind
has been served. (See Leach v. Superior Court, supra at905–06.)
 
Defendant attaches to each of the Motions evidence that each discovery
request was properly served on Plaintiff’s attorney by e-mail at his correct
e-mail address on October 2, 2023. (Motion Exh. “A.”) Plaintiff’s responses
thereto were therefore due 30 days later, on November 1, 2023. (Cal. C. Civ.
Proc. §§ 2030.260(a), 2031.260(a).) Defendant attaches to the Motions
evidence that no response of any kind to any of the three discovery requests
was received by that response due date or thereafter. (Katiraie Decl.
¶ 9.) Thus, Defendant has met its burden of showing that the Motions are
necessary.
 
Accordingly, Motion #1 is GRANTED, Motion #3 is GRANTED, and Motion #4 is
GRANTED.
 
II.        Attendance
at Deposition (Motion #2)
 
A motion to compel deposition attendance and testimony or
document production may be brought when a party fails to appear for a
deposition following service of a deposition notice without having served a
valid objection under Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §¿2025.410. (Cal. Code Civ. Proc.
§¿2025.410, subd. (a).)
 
Defendants properly bring the Motion under Cal. Code Civ.
Proc. §¿2025.410, subd. (a) because the Motion follows Plaintiff’s failure to
appear for her depositions, which followed service of the deposition notice
without the deponent having served any valid objections under Cal. Code Civ.
Proc. §¿2025.410. The deposition notice does not seek any document production
along with oral deposition testimony.
 
Accordingly,
Motion #2 is GRANTED.
 
III.       Sanctions
 
Sanctions are
mandatory against the party, the attorney, or both whose failure to serve a
timely response to the request necessitated the motion to compel response to
interrogatories or the motion to compel response to a demand for inspection. (Cal. C. Civ. Proc. §§ 2030.290(c),
2031.300(c); see also Cal. Rules of Court R. 3.1348(a) (the court can award
sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a party seeking to compel
discovery even though no opposition was filed, the opposition was withdrawn, or
the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after the motion was
filed). “As to the amount of sanctions, Cal. C. Civ. Proc.
§ 2023.030(a) authorizes the trial court to impose an amount
representing ‘the reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees, incurred by
anyone as a result’ of a party's misuse of the discovery process.” (Parker
v. Wolters Kluwer United States, Inc. (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 285, 294.)
 
Motion #1, Motion
#3, and Motion #4 each request sanctions in the amount of $585.00 and Motion #2
requests sanctions in the amount of $410.00 for a total of $2,165.00. (Katiraie
Decl.  ¶¶ 6, 10.) For each Motion, this
is based upon one hour of attorney time spent preparing the Motion at a rate of
$175.00 per hour, in the cases of Motion #1, Motion #3, and Motion #4, two
hours of attorney time attending the hearing on those Motions and travel at the
same rate for each of those Motions, for Motion #2, one hour of attorney time
attending the hearing on Motion #2 and travel at the same rate, and the filing
fees. (Hettena Decl. p. 7.) 
 
These calculations
reveal some duplication in time. The Motions are now being heard together, so
Plaintiff’s attorney only needs to travel to and appear at one hearing. We
therefore believe Plaintiff’s attorney should only be permitted to bill 2.0
hours once for all four Motions for travel to and attendance at the hearing.
Thus, we believe that the reasonable amount of attorney time spent on the
Motions is the sum of one hour for each of the four Motions and two hours
travelling to and attending the hearing for a total of six hours. Six hours
billed at a rate of $175.00 per hour is $1,050.00. We believe that the $60.00
expense to file each of the four Motions is reasonable. The product of $60.00
per motion by four motions is $240.00. The sum of reasonable attorney’s fees
and reasonable filing expenses is therefore $1,290.00.
 
Accordingly,
Defendant’s request for sanctions against Plaintiff is GRANTED in the reduced
amount of $1,290.00. Sanctions are payable within 30 days of service of this
order.
