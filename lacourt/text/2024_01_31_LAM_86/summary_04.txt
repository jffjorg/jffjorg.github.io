Judge's Tentative Ruling Summary:

The court is considering a motion for attorney's fees under the Hollister Aircraft Act (HAA) and Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5. The City's letter, dated July 18, 2023, was not emailed to the Petitioner until July 19, 2023, and the court conducted a hearing on the Petitioner's ex parte application on the same day. The court notes that discovery may be permitted to assist in bringing a motion for attorney's fees, as indicated by the Court of Appeal in Save Open Space Santa Monica Mountains v. Superior Court (2000) and Citizens Against Rent Control v. City of Berkeley (1986).

The court will analyze whether the agency acted in good faith and whether the Petitioner's lawsuit was a material factor in achieving the relief obtained. The "catalyst theory" permits an award of attorney fees if the litigation resulted in a change of behavior by the defendant. The court will conduct an inquiry to determine whether the lawsuit was causally linked to the achievement of the relief obtained.

The court will consider relevant discovery, including evidence submitted by the Petitioner, and will decide whether the lawsuit was a material factor in achieving the relief obtained. The court's tentative ruling is based on the information presented before today and is subject to change after further consideration.
