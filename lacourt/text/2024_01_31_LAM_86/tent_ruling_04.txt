[1] The court notes the Court of Appeal has indicated
discovery may be permitted, depending on the circumstances, to assist in
bringing a motion for attorney’s fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 1021.5. (See Save Open Space Santa Monica Mountains v. Superior
Court (2000) 84 Cal.App.4th 235, 246-250; Citizens Against Rent Control
v. City of Berkeley (1986) 181 Cal.App.3d 213, 235-236.)  
 


[2] A fee award under the HAA may also
require an analysis of whether the agency acted in good faith.  (See Reply 4 [citing Gov. Code § 65589.5,
subd. (k)].)  Further, the discovery
might also be relevant to Petitioner’s second cause of action for declaratory
relief or third cause of action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. section 1983. However,
since Petitioner has shown, as a general matter, that discovery is relevant to
a fee motion under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5, the court need not determine
the relevance of the discovery to a motion for fees under the HAA or to
Petitioner’s second or third causes of action. 


[3] While the City’s letter is dated July 18, 2023,
Eilenberg submits evidence the City did not email the letter to Petitioner
until July 19, 2023. (Eilenberg Decl. ¶¶ 15-17, Exh. F-H.) The court conducted
a hearing on Petitioner’s ex parte application on July 19, 2023 wherein the
City made an appearance.


[4] “The
‘catalyst theory’ permits an award of attorney fees even when the litigation
does not result in a judicial resolution if the defendant changes its behavior
substantially because of, and in the manner sought by, the litigation.” (CPRR, supra, 4 Cal.App.5th at
191.) “[W]hen a 
plaintiff seeks fees under a catalyst
theory, courts generally must conduct the following inquiry: (1) identify the
plaintiff's primary litigation objectives, (2) compare the results obtained to
determine whether the plaintiff in fact achieved those objectives, and, if so,
(3) decide whether the lawsuit was a material factor or contributed in a
significant way to those results. . . .” 
(Department of Water Resources Environmental Impact Cases (2022)
79 Cal.App.5th 556, 572-573.) “[T]he question of whether plaintiffs’ action is
causally linked to the achievement of the relief obtained is one of fact.” (Wallace
v. Consumers Coop. of Berkeley, Inc. (1985) 170 Cal.App.3d 836, 845.)
