[1] While a staff report states Eddie’s address as 10803
S. Western Avenue (AR 410), certain California licensing and business records reflects
Supreme Euphoria No. 43. Inc., which apparently owns Eddie’s and/or the state
liquor license (see Opposition 7:25-26), has an address of 10805 S. Western
Avenue. (AR 57-63.) Further, based on sheriff’s department crime statistics
reports, it appears Eddie’s addresses are both 10803 S. Western Avenue and 10805
S. Western Avenue. (See AR 442 [crime statistics for both addresses]; AR 940
[map and report showing Eddie’s address as 10805 S. Western Avenue].) At the hearing, the court
requests counsel confirm Eddie’s address includes both 10803 S. and 10805 S. Western Avenue.


[2] On August 23, 2022, in Case No. 21STCP03392, the
Honorable James Chalfant issued a minute order stating: “Pursuant to agreement
of counsel, the court issues the following oral Stipulated Judgment granting a
portion of the relief sought in the Petition based on Tran v. The County of Los
Angeles [74 Cal.App.5th 154]. The Board of Supervisors decision that is at
issue is set aside. The operative decision will be the Planning Commission’s
decision.”  (RJN Exh. B.)


[3] While the court concludes substantial evidence review
is required here, the court nonetheless evaluated the weight of the evidence
using its independent judgment. The standard of review is not determinative
here. The court’s discussion of the weight of the evidence is in the last
substantive section of this order.


[4] Korean
American Legal Advocacy Foundation, supra, 23
Cal.App.4th at 389 quotes Justice Tobriner then writing for the Court of Appeal
in Floresta, Inc. v. City Council (1961) 190 Cal.App.2d 599, 605 addressing
an argument similar to that made by Petitioners:
[t]he argument confuses
the function of zoning with that of the control of the sale of liquor. The
essence of zoning lies in metropolitan and regional planning; it is the use and
treatment of public and private land and its appurtenances in the interests of
the community as a whole. The factors and reasons that determine the imposition
of metropolitan zoning are entirely different from those which control the
regulation of the consumption of liquor. To compress zoning or city planning
into the mold of liquor regulation is to reduce its compass to a single aspect
of its impact. That it may cover the regulation of the sale or consumption of
liquor does not mean that it merely proposes liquor control; its sweep and
design are wide; its particular application in the prohibition of a cocktail
lounge does not correspondingly limit its scope or purpose.


[5] Petitioners also state “Respondents . . . exceeded
their jurisdiction premised upon a stereotypical bias against Petitioners and .
. . revoked Petitioners’ vested authority based upon inadmissible evidence.” (Opening
Brief 3:1-4.) Petitioners do not elaborate on these arguments, cite to the administrative
record, or discuss relevant legal authorities. To the extent Petitioners
contend decisionmakers were biased or decided the case based on “inadmissible evidence,”
Petitioners have waived the claims given the lack of legal analysis. (Nelson
v. Avondale Homeowners Assn. (2009) 172 Cal.App.4th 857, 862-863 [argument
waived if not raised or adequately briefed]; see also Quantum Cooking
Concepts, Inc. v. LV Associates, Inc. (2011) 197 Cal.App.4th 927, 934 [same].)    


[6] Failure to comply with performance standards may
result in revocation of deemed-approved status. (LACC, § 22.140.030.J.2.d.)


[7] Despite Petitioners’ suggestion to the contrary, BSA,
Inc. does not use the word “excessive.” 
(See Opening Brief 7:19-25 [use of “excessive” with quotation marks].)  


[8] The court acknowledges the SAAFE Ordinance states, to
maintain a deemed-approved status, the operator “shall not cause, allow, or
permit nuisance and other unlawful activities on the premises . .
. .”  (LACC, § 22.140.030.I.7 [emphasis added].)
The court concludes a reasonable inference can be made that police calls to the
address of Eddie’s or the “immediate exterior vicinity” pertain to potential
illegal activity that originated on the premises of Eddie’s. Petitioners have
developed no persuasive argument to the contrary.  


[9] Despite Petitioners’ assertions to the contrary, the
documentary evidence specifies the location as the “Liquor Store.” It also
separately categorizes other locations. (AR 440, 442.) During the relevant time
period, the general area had 308 calls for service or “proactive contacts.” Of
those, Sheriff’s Department records specified 106 were specific to the “Liquor
Store.” (AR 442.) While it is true some Sheriff Department records identify the
location as “108TH ST/WESTERN AV, LA” (AR 457, 459), some of the service call
records specify Eddie’s as the location. (AR 448 [“DP AT LIQUOR STORE WEARING
DARK JACKET”], 459, 466, 473, 474, 476, 479, 482, 483, 484, 486.)  Moreover, Eddie’s is located on the corner of
108th Street and South Western Avenue. (AR 182, 184, 224, 225, 280,
412, 492.) In at least two records, there is a general reference to the parking
lot at the intersection (AR 449) and a store. (AR 474.)


[10] Admittedly, it is somewhat unclear to the court how
the staff report calculated the number of certain incidents for its summary,
such as loitering (43) and disturbing the peace (61). (See AR 417-420.) For
example, the Sheriff Department’s Crime Incidents Report shows one incident of
vandalism (consistent with the administrative findings and staff report) (see
AR 440), but the Crime Incidents Report and CAD Report do not specify incidents
of “loitering.” The CAD Report specifies 16 incidents of “Disturbance” at Eddie’s
(AR 442) but does not specify the number of incidents of disturbing the peace.
(AR 440-442.) Nonetheless, the record contains other detailed Sheriff’s
Department documentation addressing loitering and disturbing the peace.  (See e.g., AR 940-953, 947 [“Ten to 15 people
were loitering” and “Five to 6 people were loitering”].)  Furthermore, absent some showing by
Petitioners the staff report is inaccurate—a showing not made—the staff report
is itself substantial evidence in support of the findings. 


[11] In their Opening Brief, Petitioners argued generally
“there is no evidence” that alleged incidents occurred on Petitioners’
premises. (See generally Opening Brief 8-10.) 
However, Petitioners did not discuss the record evidence, including
police call records and other Sheriff’s Department documentation when they made
their generalized arguments. Accordingly, the specific arguments at pages 3-4
of Petitioners’ Reply Brief are entirely new. 



[12] The parties do not explain the difference between the
RAPS Report (AR 444) and the Los Angeles Regional Crime Information System
(LARCIS). (AR 942.) The Sherrif’s Department used LARCIS for certain
information provided during the administrative hearing and the Problem Profile.
The RAPS Report and LARCIS summary contain different information. For example,
the RAPS Report the attempted stabbing with scissors on January 12, 2018. (AR
448-449.) The LARCIS summary contains no such entry. The same is true for a
loitering incident on February 27, 2018 reflected in the RAPS Report (AR 449)
but not in the LARCIS summary (AR 943).
