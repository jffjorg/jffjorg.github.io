And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court is issuing a tentative ruling on the dispute over the address of Eddie's and the revocation of its deemed-approved status. The court has reviewed the evidence presented and finds that the address of Eddie's is disputed, with some records showing it as 10803 S. Western Avenue and others showing it as 10805 S. Western Avenue. The court requests counsel to confirm that Eddie's address includes both addresses.

The court concludes that substantial evidence review is required, and it will evaluate the weight of the evidence using its independent judgment. The court finds that the police calls to the address of Eddie's are related to potential illegal activity that originated on the premises, and that the decision to revoke the deemed-approved status is supported by the evidence.

The court also finds that Petitioners have waived certain arguments, including claims of bias and decision based on inadmissible evidence, due to a lack of legal analysis. The court acknowledges that the SAAFE Ordinance requires the operator to maintain a deemed-approved status by not causing or permitting nuisance and other unlawful activities on the premises.

The court's tentative ruling will be further discussed in the last substantive section of this order.
