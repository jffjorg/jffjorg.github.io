Here is a summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses and production of documents from the defendant. The defendant is ordered to serve further responses and produce documents, without objections, and in full compliance with the California Discovery Act, by January 18, 2024. The defendant is also ordered to pay discovery sanctions in the sum of $5,505.00 to the plaintiff, as the court finds the defendant's opposition to the motion lacked substantial justification. The court cites various laws and case precedents, including the California Discovery Act, Civil Discovery Act of 1986, and 22 CFR §§ 72523(b) and 72527, in support of its ruling.
