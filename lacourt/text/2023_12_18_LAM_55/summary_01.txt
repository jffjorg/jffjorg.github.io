And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by Alliance Building Solutions (Defendant/Cross-Complainant) against Santa Clarita Electrical, Inc. (Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant) in a case involving breach of contract claims. The Court has sustained the demurrer with 30 days' leave to amend. The Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint alleging that the Defendant refused to turn over payment for work done installing equipment for William S. Hart Union High School District and Inglewood Unified School District. The Cross-Complainant filed a Cross-Complaint alleging breaches of subcontract agreements for monitoring and management systems and LED lighting. The Court found that the allegations in the Cross-Complaint are too uncertain and vague regarding the effects of the contract language and the facts regarding breaches of such language. The Court allowed leave to amend to fairly and certainly apprise the Cross-Defendant of the legal effect of the contracts and the claimed breaches.
