And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the unopposed motion filed by Decon Properties Corporation to compel the responses of Plaintiffs Ali and Kelly Maadarani to special interrogatories. The judge has ordered the Plaintiffs to serve their initial responses without objections and in full compliance with the California Discovery Act by January 8, 2024. The judge has also denied the request for additional sanctions of $1,460.00, finding that the previously ordered sanctions of $1,000.00 are sufficient to cover all the discovery motions against the Plaintiffs. The judge's decision is based on the fact that Decon Properties Corporation properly served the special interrogatories on the Plaintiffs, who failed to respond, and did not file any opposition to the motion. The judge has cited relevant case law and statutes, including Leach v. Sup. Ct. and Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pac. Healthcare Consultants, to support its decision.
