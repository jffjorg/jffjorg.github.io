And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has granted the Plaintiff's unopposed motion to vacate the dismissal and enter judgment on a settlement agreement. The Plaintiff, a student loan trust, alleged that the Defendant owed them $54,367.20, and the parties entered a Conditional Stipulated Settlement Agreement in 2015. The Defendant made payments towards the balance due, totaling $30,200.00, but the last payment was made in 2021. The Plaintiff is seeking judgment in the amount of $24,729.70, which is the remaining balance due after credits for the payments made. The Court has determined that the parties have properly followed the procedure for requesting the court to retain jurisdiction to enforce the settlement under CCP Section 664.6, and has entered judgment in accordance with the settlement agreement.
