2449 E. Roughneck Place, Brea, CA 92821 (“the Property”).
 
BACKGROUND
 
This is
an unlawful detainer case filed on May 11, 2023, by Plaintiff 5623
PECK ROAD, LLC
against Defendants Cultiva Group and Qirong Lin, claiming past-due rent
totaling $137,435.90, attorney fees, forfeiture of the lease agreement, damages
accruing daily since January 1, 2023, and additional expenses around $20,000.
On October 16, 2023, Plaintiff obtained a Judgment-Unlawful Detainer for
past-due rent in the amount of $137,435.90; Holdover damages for $177,933.24;
Attorney fees in the amount of $2,467.41; and Costs of $1,127.19. A Credit of
$216,176.78 was stated, and the Total Judgment was for $102,787.56.
 
On May
28, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant motion. As of July 2, 2024, no opposition
has been filed. 
 
TENTATIVE RULING
The Court CONTINUES the motion to
allow Plaintiff to file a Notice of Motion and properly notice Defendant. Plaintiff
is ordered to file and serve a Notice of Motion within 10 days of this hearing.

 
LEGAL STANDARD
 
Code of Civil Procedure § 1005 requires written notice for  “any other proceeding under this code in which
notice is required, and no other time or method is prescribed by law or by
court or judge.” (Code of Civil Procedure § 1005.)
 
DISCUSSION
 
As a preliminary matter, the Court notes the instant motion
is procedurally defective because Plaintiff failed to file a Notice of Motion. Here,
Plaintiff only filed a proposed order and a memorandum of points and
authorities. Therefore, the Court orders Plaintiff to file a Notice of Motion
to properly notice Defendant. 
 
CONCLUSION
 
Therefore, the Court CONTINUES the
motion to allow Plaintiff to file a Notice of Motion. Plaintiff is ordered to
file and serve a Notice of Motion within 10 days of this hearing.
