RELIEF
REQUESTED 
 
Defendant, Philip Tse Chow, named as
“DOE 1”, moves the Court for an order to dismiss Plaintiff’s complaint. This
Motion is based on the following: It is abundantly and unequivocally clear that
Plaintiff knew that Defendant PHILIP TSE CHOW as DOE 1 should have been named
much earlier in this lawsuit as a Defendant – long before the expiration of the
Statute of limitations.
 
BACKGROUND
 
 This matter arises from an
automobile accident that occurred on March 14, 2021. Plaintiff Chris Arredondo
alleges that he was injured in a collision caused by Defendant Philip Tse Chow.
Plaintiff filed the Complaint on March 9, 2023, alleging motor vehicle
negligence and general negligence. 
 
On October 12, 2023, Plaintiff filed an amendment naming
PHILIP TSE CHOW as “DOE 1” and it was served on October 27, 2023, by substitute
service on “Anita Doe.”
 
 
On February 12, 2024, Plaintiff’s Counsel advised Defendant
that he was withdrawing as counsel of record for Plaintiff and granted an open
extension to respond to the complaint. On March 11, 2024, the Court granted the
motion to relieved as counsel.
 
On
June 4, 2024, Defendant Philip Tse Chow filed the instant motion. 
 
As of
July 2, 2024, Plaintiff has not filed an opposition. 
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
The Court GRANTS the Defendant Philip Tse Chow’s unopposed Motion
to Dismiss because the Doe amendment is barred by the statute of limitations. 
            
LEGAL STANDARD
 
The name of the motion to dismiss an action when a known
defendant has been brought into the lawsuit as a “DOE” after the statute of
limitations has been expired has interchangeably been used by the courts as a
“motion to dismiss”, or “a motion to quash” or a “Barrows motion”. (A.N. v.
County of Los Angeles (2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 1058; Barrows v. Am.
Motors, Corp. (1983); C.C.P. 581(m).) It’s also been referred to as a
“motion to strike”. (See: A.N. v. County of Los Angeles (2009) 171
Cal.App.4th 1058, 1064, [“The substance of the ‘motion to quash’ is what
mattered, not its label”].)
 
In cases where persons that were known to a plaintiff at the
time the complaint was filed have been allowed to be brought in by a DOE
amendment after the statute of limitations had run, there was some showing that
the plaintiff was ignorant of something having a bearing upon the new
defendant’s liability. (Miller v. Thomas (1981) 121 Cal. App. 3d 440,
445, 175 Cal. Rptr. 327, 330.) The plaintiff “must be genuinely ignorant of the
defendant’s identity or the facts rendering the defendant liable when the original
complaint was filed.” (Taito v. Owens Coming (1992) 7 Cal. App. 4th 798,
802, 9 Cal. Rptr. 2d 687, 699.)
 
Moreover, “even if a good amendment is proposed in proper
form, unwarranted delay in presenting it may—of itself—be a valid reason for
denial.” ’ ” (Huff v. Wilkins (2006) 138 Cal.App.4th 732, 746, 41
Cal.Rptr.3d 754 (Huff ); Record v. Reason, supra, 73 Cal.App.4th at p. 486.)
Thus, appellate courts are less likely to find an abuse of discretion where,
for example, the proposed amendment is “ ‘offered after long unexplained delay
... or where there is a lack of diligence....’ ” (Hulsey v. Koehler
(1990) 218 Cal.App.3d 1150, 1159, Melican v. Regents of Univ. of California,
151 Cal. App. 4th 168, 175 (2007).
 
DISCUSSION
 
California Code of
Civil Procedure section 335.1 states that the injured party or accident victim
has 2 years, from the time of the incident, to file a personal injury lawsuit
to seek compensation from the party at fault. The statute of limitations begins
“from the date of the injury, or the date it was discovered, or the date on
which it would have been discovered with reasonable efforts.”
 
Here, the accident
occurred on March 14, 2021, and
the complaint was filed on March 9, 2023 which was within the 2 year
statute of limitations. However, on October 12, 2023 – more than 2 and ½ years
after the accident -- Plaintiff filed an amendment naming PHILIP TSE CHOW as
“DOE 1.” The Traffic Collision Report dated March 14, 2021, shows Driver 1 and
the owner of the vehicle as Philip Tse Chow while Driver 2 and owner of the
vehicle is Chris Arredondo. (Kang Decl. ¶ 6; Ex. C.)
 
The Court is
granting the motion of Defendant Philip Tse Chow to dismiss Plaintiff's
complaint in this action. The Court is so ruling because the evidence presented
to the Court shows that the Plaintiff was aware of the existence of Philip Tse
Chow during the filing of the complaint. Plaintiff's awareness of Philip Tse
Chow’s involvement stems from the Traffic Collision Report dated March 14,
2021. Because of the Plaintiff's awareness of Philip Tse Chow, his Doe
amendment to name Philip Tse Chow as a Defendant was improper under Code of
Civil Procedure Section 474. Additionally, Plaintiff failed to file an
opposition providing any explanation for the delay and or that he was
“genuinely ignorant.” Since, the Doe amendment was improper, Plaintiff's claims
against Philip Tse Chow do not relate back to Plaintiff's filing of the
complaint and thus are barred under the applicable statute of limitations.
Therefore, dismissal is warranted. 
 
CONCLUSION
 
Thus, the Court GRANTS the unopposed Motion to Dismiss. 
 
Moving Party to give notice.
