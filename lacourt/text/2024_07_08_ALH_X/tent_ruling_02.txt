RELIEF
REQUESTED 
 
Defendant moves for an order
dismissing the Complaint of Plaintiff Jose Sanchez for failure to comply with
the Court Orders compelling verified answers to discovery. In the event that terminating
sanctions are not awarded, Albertsons further requests that Plaintiff be
ordered to pay sanctions in the amount of $1,310.00 to Albertsons representing
reasonable expenses including the attorney's fees incurred by the moving party
in connection with this proceeding as well. 
 
BACKGROUND
 
Plaintiff alleges that on or about February 15, 2021, he was
at the premises maintained by Albertsons when he sustained injuries. Plaintiff
filed suit for personal injuries on February 1, 2023, and served same on
Albertsons on June 13, 2023.
 
No response has been provided to any of the written
discovery requests for which Plaintiff was ordered to provide verified
responses, on or before May 20, 2024. Albertsons now brings this Motion for
Dismissal (terminating sanctions) for Plaintiff’s failure to comply with the
court’s Orders issued on April 29, 2024.
 
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
The Court grants the unopposed motion to dismiss.
 
LEGAL STANDARD
 
Code of Civil
Procedure §2023.010(g) defines misuse of the discovery process to include
“disobeying a court order to provide discovery.” 
 
Section 2023.030
continues: “[T]he court, after notice to any affected party, person, or
attorney, and after an opportunity for hearing, may impose the following
sanctions against anyone engaging in conduct that is a misuse of the discovery
process: . . . . (d) The court may impose a terminating sanction by of the
following orders: (3) An order dismissing the action, or any part of the
action, of that party.” 
 
DISCUSSION
 
On May 2, 2024, the Court ordered Plaintiff to provide
verified responses to Albertsons’ First Set of Form Interrogatories, Special
Interrogatories and Request for Production of Documents by May 20, 2024. (Galstyan
Decl. ¶ 9.) On May 20, 2024, counsel for Albertsons’ called Plaintiff and left
him a voicemail inquiring as to the status of the responses. (Galstyan Decl. ¶
9.) To date, Albertsons has not received any responses to its’ First Set of
Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories and Request for Production of
Documents. (Galstyan Decl. ¶ 9.) Notably, Plaintiff failed to file an
opposition. Therefore, there is a misuse of discovery and dismissal is
appropriate. 
 
CONCLUSION
 
Thus, the Court grants the unopposed motion to dismiss. 
 
Moving Party to give notice.
