And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Joel L. Lofton in the case Leafire, Inc. and Llulllu, LLC v. CADM, Inc., et al. (Case Number 20GDCV00722). The case involves a dispute over jurisdiction and venue, with the defendants seeking to reconsider an earlier order denying their motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.

The defendants argue that the court lacked jurisdiction over the action because the two real estate properties in dispute are located in Riverside County, where defendant Jianqiang Gu has been a resident since the commencement of the lawsuit. However, the court finds that the main relief sought in the action was transitory in nature, seeking personal relief for fraud and breach of contract, and that the majority of the real property were located in Los Angeles County. The court also notes that the defendants failed to provide a satisfactory explanation for their failure to raise this issue earlier.

The court denies the defendants' motion for reconsideration, finding that it was based on facts and circumstances that were known to the defendants at the time of the original ruling, and that they failed to provide a sufficient explanation for their failure to raise this issue earlier.
