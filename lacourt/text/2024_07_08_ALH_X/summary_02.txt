And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the defendant's unopposed motion to dismiss the plaintiff's lawsuit. The plaintiff failed to comply with court orders to provide verified responses to the defendant's discovery requests, and as a result, the court has dismissed the action. The defendant had requested termination sanctions, including an order dismissing the action or ordering the plaintiff to pay sanctions in the amount of $1,310.00. The court has not awarded these sanctions, but has instead granted the motion to dismiss.
