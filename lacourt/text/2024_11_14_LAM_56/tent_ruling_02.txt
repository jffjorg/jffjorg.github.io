BACKGROUND
             On July 10, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a complaint
asserting the following causes of action: (1) Declaratory Judgment and Injunctive
Relief Under California Code of Civil Procedure § 1060 et seq.; (2) Violation
of California Labor code § 925; (3) Violation of California Business & Professions
Code § 16600 et seq.; and (4) Violation of California Business & Professions
Code § 17200.
 
On
September 10, 2024, Defendants filed two respective applications to permit
Katherine E. Perrelli (“Perrelli”) and Dallin R. Wilson (“Wilson”) to appear pro
hac vice as counsel, along with local counsel, Jesse L. Miller, in this
action (the “Applications”).
 
 The Court has considered the Applications. 
No opposition papers were filed.  Any opposition papers were required to
have been filed and served at least nine court days prior to the hearing under
California Code of Civil Procedure section 1005, subdivision (b).
 
DISCUSSION
California
Rules of Court (“CRC”) rule 9.40 provides that an attorney in good standing in
another jurisdiction may apply to appear pro hac vice in this State by
way of written application upon due notice to all interested parties, as well
as service on the State Bar in San Francisco with payment of a $50 fee,
provided that the attorney (a) is not a California resident, (b) does not work
in California, and (c) does not perform regular or substantial business,
professional or other activities in California. 
 
An
application for pro hac vice admission must set forth: (1) the applicant
attorney’s residence and office addresses; (2) the courts to which the
applicant attorney has been admitted and dates of admission; (3) a
representation that the attorney applicant is a member in good standing in the
courts of admission and is not currently suspended or disbarred in any court;
(4) the title of each court and action in which the applicant attorney has
appeared pro hac vice in this State in the prior two years; and (5) the
name, address and phone number of the active California State Bar member with
whom the applicant is associated.  (CRC, rule
9.40(d).)
 
The
Court finds that though Defendants have complied with most of the requirements,
Defendants failed to submit proof that the $50.00 fees were paid for each
application.  Additionally, the Applications do not state that Perrelli
and Wilson do not perform regular or substantial business, professional or
other activities in the State.  (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 9.40.)
 
For
the above reasons, the Court, DENIES the Applications, and each of them,
without prejudice.
 
Moving
parties are ordered to give notice of this ruling.       
 
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org
as directed by the instructions provided on the court website at
www.lacourt.org.  If the department does
not receive an email and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion
will be placed off calendar.
 
Dated this 14th day of November 2024
