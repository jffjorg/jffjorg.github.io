Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on a special motion to strike certain causes of action from the complaint filed by Plaintiffs Kevin Hart and K. Hart Enterprises, Inc. against Defendants Miesha Shakes, Latasha Transrina Kebe, Kebe Studios, LLC, Yelen Entertainment LLC, and Does 1-20.

The judge granted the motion to strike Hart and KHE's first cause of action for civil extortion, KHE's fourth cause of action for invasion of privacy, and KHE's fifth cause of action for defamation.

The judge denied the motion to strike the second cause of action for breach of contract, which is asserted only against Shakes. The judge found that Shakes' contention that Hart did not perform his obligations under the non-disclosure agreement creates a disputed issue of fact.

The judge also found that Plaintiffs have shown minimal merit as to Hart's invasion of privacy claim and defamation claim, but not as to KHE's corresponding claims.

The judge's ruling is based on California Code of Civil Procedure § 425.16 and California Evidence Code § 452, and cites several court cases, including Equilon Enterprises v. Consumer Cause, Inc., Soukup v. Law Offices of Herbert Hafif, Sylmar Air Conditioning v. Pueblo Contracting Services, Inc., and Tran v. Nguyen.
