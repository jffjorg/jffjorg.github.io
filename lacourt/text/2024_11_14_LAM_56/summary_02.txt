And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the applications of Katherine E. Perrelli and Dallin R. Wilson to appear pro hac vice as counsel in this action without prejudice. The applications were filed by the defendants, Telus International (CDA) Inc., Telus International (U.S.) Corp., Telus International AI Acquisition, Inc., Telus International Holdings (U.S.A.) Corp., Telus International AI Inc., and Telus International Services Ltd. The judge found that the applications were incomplete because they did not include proof that the $50 fee for pro hac vice admission was paid, and they did not state that Perrelli and Wilson do not perform regular or substantial business, professional or other activities in California. The judge has ordered the moving parties to give notice of this ruling.
