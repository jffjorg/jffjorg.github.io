The Court finds that the motion is procedurally deficient due to inadequate notice and failure to comply with the Rules of Court. As a result, the motion is denied. The Plaintiff is ordered to give notice of the denial. Any party may submit on the tentative ruling by contacting the courtroom via email by 4:00 p.m. the day before the hearing.
