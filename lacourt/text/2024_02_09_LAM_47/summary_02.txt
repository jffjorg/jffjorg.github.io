Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the defendant's motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories and for sanctions. The defendant has sought further responses to 112 interrogatories, which are categorized into three areas: facts related to various contentions and claims in the complaint, the identity of individuals named in the pleadings or with knowledge of relevant facts, and identification of documents supporting the plaintiff's contentions.

The court finds that the defendant has satisfied its statutory meet-and-confer obligation and that the plaintiff's responses to special interrogatories are incomplete and evasive in certain areas. The court grants the defendant's motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories in part, specifically with respect to interrogatories nos. 31, 34, 37, 40, 43, 46, 49, 52, 55, 58, 61, 64, 67, 71, 73, 74, 77, 80, and 83.

The court denies both parties' requests for sanctions, finding that neither party fully prevailed on the motion to compel further responses. The court's tentative ruling is subject to change based on any submissions from the parties.
