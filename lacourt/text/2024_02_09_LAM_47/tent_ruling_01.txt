Traber, Department 47     HEARING DATE:     February 9, 2024                  TRIAL  DATE: VACATED                                                             CASE:                         Century Recovery LLC v. Walter C.  Harris, et al.    CASE NO.:                 22STCV24280               MOTION  FOR ATTORNEY’S FEES AND COSTS    MOVING PARTY:               Plaintiff Century Recovery, LLC    RESPONDING PARTY(S): No response on  eCourt as of 02/06/24   STATEMENT  OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:                          This is an action for breach of contract that was filed on July 27, 2022.  Plaintiff alleges that Defendant breached the terms of a loan agreement by  failing to make payments as required by its terms.    Plaintiff moves for attorney’s fees  and costs.    TENTATIVE RULING:               Plaintiff’s Motion for Attorney’s Fees and Costs is GRANTED.   DISCUSSION:   Plaintiff moves for attorney’s fees  and costs.    Entitlement to Fees               Civil Code section 1717 provides, in  relevant part: In any action on a contract, where the contract specifically  provides that attorney's fees and costs, which are incurred to  enforce that contract, shall be awarded either to one of the parties or  to the prevailing party, then the party who is determined to be the party  prevailing on the contract, whether he or she is the party specified in the  contract or not, shall be entitled to reasonable attorney's fees in addition to  other costs. (Civil Code § 1717(a), bold emphasis added.) “[I]t  is established that fees, if recoverable at all – pursuant either to statute or  parties’ agreement – are available for services at trial and on appeal.”  (Morcos v. Board of Retirement (1990) 51 Cal.3d 924, 927 [emphasis in  original].) Here, the Promissory Note that gives rise to this action, to which Defendant  is a party, states:    If suit or action is instituted to  collect, defend or enforce the Note and Guarantee, or any portion hereof or  obligation of the Borrower or Guarantor related hereto, Borrower and Guarantor  promise to pay Lender's reasonable attorney's fees and court costs in said  proceedings, together with all other expenses Incurred by Lender in connection  therewith, including interest on those amounts at the rate disclosed above from  the date such expenses were incurred by Lender.    (Plaintiff’s Exh. 1. p.3.) “Lender” includes both the  original lender, LoanMe, Inc., and any subsequent holder of the Note. (Id.  p.1.) As the Court granted summary judgment on December 5, 2023, in favor of  Plaintiff as a subsequent holder of the note, Plaintiff is entitled to collect  reasonable attorney’s fees incurred to enforce the contract as a matter of law.  (See December 5, 2023 Minute Order.)    Reasonableness of  Fees             Reasonable attorney’s fees are  allowable costs when authorized by contract, statute, or law. (Code Civ. Proc §  1033.5(a)(10), (c)(5)(B).) In actions that are based on a contract, “where the  contract specifically provides that attorney’s fees and costs, which are  incurred to enforce that contract, shall be awarded either to one of the  parties or to the prevailing party, then the party who is determined to be the  party prevailing on the contract… shall be entitled to reasonable attorney’s  fees in addition to other costs.” (Civil Code § 1717(a) [emphasis added].) A  recovery of attorney’s fees is authorized even in noncontractual or tort  actions if the contractual provision for fee recovery is worded broadly enough.  (See Code Civ. Proc § 10211; Maynard v. BTI Group, Inc. (2013) 216  Cal.App.4th 984, 993 [agreement to award fees based on outcome of “any dispute”  encompasses all claims, “whether in contract, tort or otherwise]; Lockton v.  O'Rourke (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 1051, 1076; Lerner v. Ward (1993) 13  Cal.App.4th 155, 160.)  The prevailing party must file a noticed motion to claim  contractual attorney fees as costs. (Civil Code § 1717(b)(1); see Russell v.  Trans Pacific Group (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 1717, 1728.) Reasonable  attorney’s fees shall be fixed by the Court and shall be an element of the  costs of suit. (Civil Code § 1717(a); Code Civ. Proc. § 1033.5(c)(5)(B).)  Reasonable attorney fees are ordinarily determined by the Court pursuant to the  “lodestar” method, i.e., the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by  the reasonable hourly rate. (See PLCM Group, Inc. v. Drexler (2000) 22  Cal.4th 1084, 1095-1096; Margolin v. Regional Planning Com. (1982) 134  Cal.App.3d 999, 1004 [“California courts have consistently held that a  computation of time spent on a case and the reasonable value of that time is  fundamental to a determination of an appropriate attorneys' fee award.”].) “[T]he lodestar is the basic fee for  comparable legal services in the community; it may be adjusted by the court  based on factors including, as relevant herein, (1) the novelty and difficulty  of the questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the  extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded other employment by the  attorneys, (4) the contingent nature of the fee award….”  (Ibid.)  In setting the hourly rate for a fee award, courts are entitled to consider the  “fees customarily charged by that attorney and others in the community for  similar work.” (Bihun v. AT&T Info. Sys., Inc. (1993) 13 Cal.App.4th  976, 997 [affirming rate of $450 per hour], overruled on other grounds by Lakin  v. Watkins Associated Indus. (1993) 6 Cal.4th 644, 664.)  The burden  is on the party seeking attorney’s fees to prove the reasonableness of the  fees. (Center for Biological Diversity v. County of San Bernardino  (2010) 188 Cal.App.4th 603, 615.)  The Court has broad discretion in  determining the amount of a reasonable attorney’s fee award, which will not be  overturned absent a “manifest abuse of discretion, a prejudicial error of law,  or necessary findings not supported by substantial evidence.” (Bernardi  v. County of Monterey (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 1379, 1393-1394.)  The  Court need not explain its calculation of the amount of attorney’s fees awarded  in detail; identifying the factors considered in arriving at the amount will  suffice. (Ventura v. ABM Indus. Inc. (2012) 212 Cal.App.4th 258,  274-275.)               Here,  Plaintiff requests attorney’s fees in the amount of $15,100, based on 44.8  hours of attorney time billed at $275 per hour, plus 13.9 hours of attorney  time billed at $200 per hour. (Declaration of Assly Sayyar ISO Mot. ¶ 9.) Attorney  Sayyar testifies to her own experience and the experience of her of-counsel  attorney, and to the hourly rates of attorneys in her firm. (Id. ¶¶  4-5.) Attorney Sayyar does not testify to the experience of her associate  attorney who billed on this matter, but states that that work was done under  her supervision. (Id. ¶ 4.) Plaintiff has also provided itemized timesheets  showing each time entry, the work done, the proportional rate, and whether  those fees have yet been invoiced to the client. (Plaintiff’s Exh. 4A.) From  these records, the Court observes that Plaintiff’s counsel exercised billing  judgment by assigning procedural and technical work to associates charging  lower rates, while reserving strategic work, editing, and court appearances to  more senior attorneys. (See Id.) The Court therefore finds that  Plaintiff has demonstrated that the fees sought are fair and reasonable.    Costs               Plaintiff  also requests an award of costs in the amount of $1,935.25. Under Code of Civil  Procedure section 1033.5(a), Plaintiff, as the prevailing party in this action,  is likewise entitled to recover costs. Plaintiff  provided a memorandum of costs which was served by mail on December 13, 2023  with this motion, before entry of judgment (Memorandum of Costs.) Defendant did  not serve or file notice of a motion to tax costs within the 15-day period set  forth by California Rule of Court 3.1700(b). As Defendant has not objected to  the cost memorandum, the Court finds the requested costs to be reasonable, and  will award costs to Plaintiff in the amount of $1,935.25.   CONCLUSION:               Accordingly,  Plaintiff’s Motion for Attorney’s Fees and Costs is GRANTED.                Moving  Party to give notice.   IT IS SO ORDERED.   Dated: February 9, 2024                                 ___________________________________                                                                                     Theresa  M.
