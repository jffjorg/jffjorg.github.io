Legal Standards
 
Under Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.300, subdivision (a), a court
may order a party to serve a further response to an interrogatory when the
court finds that: “(1) An answer to a particular interrogatory is evasive or
incomplete[;] (2) An exercise of the option to produce documents under Section
2030.230 is unwarranted or the required specification of those documents is
inadequate[; or] (3) An objection to an interrogatory is without merit or too
general.”
 
The burden is on the responding party to justify any objection or failure
to fully answer the interrogatories. Fairmont Ins. Co. v. Superior Court
(2000) 22 Cal.4th 245, 255.
 
Meet and
Confer
 
A party making a
motion to compel further responses must include a declaration stating facts
showing a “reasonable and good faith attempt” to resolve informally the issues
presented by the motion before filing the motion. (Code Civ. Proc., §§
2016.040, 2030.310(b).) 
 
The Declaration of Amanda
H. Herron in support of the motion states that the parties met and conferred
via telephone concerning the Plaintiff’s responses to Defendant’s discovery on
October 30, 2023, during which time the parties discussed mutually
supplementing their respective discovery responses. (Declaration of Amanda H.
Herron ISO Mot. ¶¶ 7-8.) Plaintiff, in opposition, claims that this telephone
call did not discuss Plaintiff’s responses to this discovery. (Declaration of Ali
M. Sachani ISO Opp. ¶ 5.) Attorney Herron next contacted Plaintiff’s counsel
via email on November 6, 2023, seeking an extension to the time to compel
further responses because she was in the process of drafting a meet and confer
letter. (Herron Decl. ¶ 6, Exh. C; Sachani Decl. ¶ 7.) Plaintiff’s counsel
denied the request and refused to discuss the matter further, claiming the deadline
to bring a motion to compel further responses had passed. In light of
Plaintiff’s refusal to discuss the matter further, the Court finds that
Defendant has satisfied its statutory meet-and-confer obligation. 
 
Timeliness
 
A
motion to compel a further response must be noticed within 45 days of the
service of the verified response, or any supplemental response, or on or before
any specific later date to which the propounding party and the responding party
have agreed in writing.  (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2030.300(c),
2031.310(c); see also Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58
Cal.App.4th 1403, 1409; Vidal Sassoon, Inc. v. Superior Court
(1983) 147 Cal.App.3d 681, 685.) Otherwise, the propounding party waives any
right to compel further responses. (Id.) The 45-day time limit is mandatory and
jurisdictional.  (Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58 Cal.
App. 4th 1403, 1410.)
 
Plaintiff
contends that the motion is untimely because it was served more than 45 days
after Plaintiff’s responses were served, but neglects to account for statutory
extensions of time due to the manner of service. (See Code Civ. Proc. §§
1010.6; 1013.) The undisputed facts show that Plaintiff’s responses were served
via email on September 20, 2023. (Herron Decl. ¶ 5, Exh. B.) As the responses
were served via electronic service, the 45-day motion to compel deadline was
extended by two court days. (Code Civ. Proc. § 1010.6.) 45 days plus two court
days after September 20, 2023 was Tuesday, November 7, 2023. This motion was
filed and served on Tuesday, November 7, 2023. (Proof of Service.) Defendant’s
motion is timely. 
 
Analysis
            
            Defendant moves to compel further responses
to special interrogatories propounded to Plaintiff. Defendant served special
interrogatories on Plaintiff on June 29, 2023. (Herron Decl. ¶ 3; Exh. A.) Plaintiff’s
responses were served on September 20, 2023. (Id. ¶ 5; Exh. B.)
Defendant contends that Plaintiff’s responses to each of the 112 interrogatories
except Nos. 28, 29, 30, and 70 lack detail and are evasive. Plaintiff declined
to address the sufficiency of his responses in his opposition, choosing merely
to argue that the motion is untimely as a matter of law. For the reasons stated
above, Plaintiff is incorrect. As Plaintiff has not addressed his responses,
any answers which are not sufficient on their face will merit an order
compelling further responses.
 
            Turning now to the merits of the
motion, Defendant propounded 112 interrogatories to Plaintiff in this single
set of discovery. These interrogatories break down into three categories seeking

 
(1)   facts
related to various contentions and claims in the Complaint (Herron Decl. Exh.
A. Nos . 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, 22, 25, 31, 34, 37, 40, 43, 46, 49, 52, 55,
58, 61, 64, 67, 71, 73, 74, 77, 80, 83, 86, 89, 92, 95, 98, 101, 104, 107, and
110); 
 
(2)   the
identity of individuals named in the pleadings or with knowledge of relevant
facts (Nos. 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20, 23, 26, 28-30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, 48, 51,
54, 57, 60, 63, 66, 69-70, 73, 76, 79, 82, 85, 88, 91, 94, 97, 100, 103, 106,
109, and 112); and 
 
(3)   identification
of documents supporting Plaintiff’s contentions (Nos. 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21,
24, 27, 32, 35, 38, 41, 44, 47, 50, 53, 56, 59, 62, 65, 68, 72, 75, 78, 81, 84,
87, 90, 93, 96, 99, 102, 105, 108, and 111.) 

 
These categories
are distributed across three subject areas: 
 
a)      the
individual causes of action in the Complaint (Exh. A. Nos. 1-27, 110-112); 
 
b)      the
factual allegations in the Complaint (Exh. A. Nos. 28-82) and;
 
c)      the
relief sought in Plaintiff’s prayer for relief (Exh. A. Nos. 83-109.) 
 
Plaintiff’s
response to each of the first category of interrogatories was an identical
recitation of the factual contentions offered in the Complaint. (See, e.g., Herron
Decl. Exh. B. No. 1.) As the Complaint includes substantial factual contentions
in support of the various causes of action asserted, setting forth those
contentions in response to an interrogatory seeking factual support for a given
cause of action (i.e., Herron Decl. Exh. B. Nos. 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, 22,
25 and 110) is not per se evasive. These answers are likewise responsive
to a request for factual support for a specific prayer for relief, as sought in
Interrogatories Nos. 83, 86, 89, 92, 95, 98, 101, 104, and 107. However, where
the questions concern the basis for those same factual contentions, a response
that merely repeats those same allegations verbatim is patently inadequate.
(See Herron Decl. Exh. B. Nos. 31, 34, 37, 40, 43, 46, 49, 52, 55, 58, 61, 64,
67, 71, 73, 74, 77, 80, and 83.) 
 
As
to the second and third categories, Plaintiff responded to each of the second
category (except Nos. 28-30 and 70) with an identical list of witnesses:
Plaintiff, Chad McFadden, Janet Dent, Martha (Last Name Unknown), Levi Last
Name Unknown) and other employees, officers, or agents of defendant whose names
and identities are not yet known. (See Herron Decl. Exh. B. Nos. 2, 5, 8, 11,
14, 17, 20, 23, 26, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, 48, 51, 54, 57, 60, 63, 66, 69, 73, 76,
79, 82, 85, 88, 91, 94, 97, 100, 103, 106, 109, and 112.) Plaintiff responded
to each question in the third category by referring Defendant to his CRD
Complaint and Right to Sue Letter and his accompanying declaration. (Herron
Decl. Exh. B. Nos.3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 32, 35, 38, 41, 44, 47, 50,
53, 56, 59, 62, 65, 68, 72, 75, 78, 81, 84, 87, 90, 93, 96, 99, 102, 105, 108,
and 111.) Defendant contends that these responses are not sufficient because they
do not delineate which witnesses or documents possess information that is
responsive to each interrogatory. However, Defendant cites no authority
requiring that level of detail in responding to these interrogatories which do
not themselves call for further detail. Further, in a situation like this where
only a handful of witnesses are identified, it cannot be said that Plaintiff’s
response is evasive, as where key witnesses are hidden in a lengthy list naming
many individuals.  Defendant sought
individuals and documents in possession of specific categories of information.
Plaintiff identified individuals and documents which he contends have that
information. These are full and complete responses to the interrogatories as
they were propounded. Further responses to these interrogatories are not
required. 
 
Sanctions
 
            Both parties seek sanctions in
connection with this motion. However, as neither party fully prevailed on the
motion to compel further responses, the Court finds that sanctions are not
warranted. 
 
CONCLUSION:

 
            Accordingly,
Defendant’s Motion to Compel Further Responses to Special Interrogatories is
GRANTED IN PART with respect to Interrogatories Nos. 31, 34, 37,
40, 43, 46, 49, 52, 55, 58, 61, 64, 67, 71, 73, 74, 77, 80, and 83 and
otherwise DENIED. 
 
            Both parties’ requests for sanctions
are DENIED. 
 
            Moving
Party to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
