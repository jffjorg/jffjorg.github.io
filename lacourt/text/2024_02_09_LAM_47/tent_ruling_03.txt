Traber, Department 47     HEARING DATE:     February 9, 2024                   TRIAL  DATE: NOT SET                                                             CASE:                         Cenigent  Health Enhancement Medical Institute v. Dan Mintz, et al.    CASE NO.:                 BC545169                MOTION  TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL    MOVING PARTY:               Attorney Daniel W. Doyle of Doyle Schafer McMahon, LLP,  counsel for Plaintiff   RESPONDING PARTY(S): No response on  eCourt as of 2/6/24   CASE  HISTORY: ·          05/08/14: Complaint  filed.  ·          05/06/16: First  Amended Complaint filed.  ·          09/06/16: Second  Amended Complaint filed.  ·          11/17/17: Case stayed  pending arbitration.  ·          01/14/19: Arbitration  ordered terminated.    STATEMENT  OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:                          Plaintiff allegedly provided medical  treatment and medical research services to Defendants. Defendants have not paid  outstanding invoices for such services totaling over $1.5 million.                Attorney  Daniel W. Doyle of Doyle Schafer McMahon, LLP, counsel for Plaintiff, moves to  be relieved as counsel.   TENTATIVE RULING:               Attorney  Daniel W. Doyle of Doyle Schafer McMahon, LLP, counsel for Plaintiff, moves to  be relieved as counsel.               On December  8, 2023, Moving Counsel sought to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff via an ex  parte application. The Court declined to issue such relief on an ex  parte basis, but specially set a hearing on a formal motion to be relieved  as counsel for February 9, 2024. (December 12, 2023 Minute Order.) Moving  Counsel’s papers were not filed until January 29, 2024, well after the date for  proper notice of a motion as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 1005(b),  despite the Court’s order providing Moving Counsel with more than three weeks  to do so. Further, Moving Counsel did not prepare the motion, supporting  declaration, and proposed order on Judicial Council Forms MC-051, -052, and  -053. Use of these forms is mandatory under Rule of Court 3.1362.                As Moving  Counsel has failed to give adequate notice of this motion and failed to comply  with the Rules of Court in presenting the moving papers, Moving Counsel’s  motion is procedurally deficient in every respect.                Accordingly,  Attorney Daniel W. Doyle of Doyle Shaver McMahon, LLP’s Motion to Be Relieved  as Counsel is DENIED.    Moving Party to give notice.   IT IS SO ORDERED.   Dated:  February 9,  2024                                ___________________________________                                                                                     Theresa  M.
