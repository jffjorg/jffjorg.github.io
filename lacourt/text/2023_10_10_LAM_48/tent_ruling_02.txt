  CASE NO.: 21STCV42813
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO BE RELIEVED
  AS COUNSEL
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
October 10, 2023



 
I.
Donald Weissman, counsel of record for Plaintiff Filipino American Community of
Los Angeles Inc (FACLA)s, seeks to be relieved as counsel.  Counsel’s declaration states that communication
has broken down, the client has not paid, and counsel cannot represent a client
who does not respond or communicate.  No party
opposed the motion.
Absent
a showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney’s request for withdrawal should be
granted.  (People v. Prince (1968)
268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406.)  Counsel’s motion
complies with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, and no prejudice is shown.
The
proposed order does not include the upcoming hearing dates.  Before signing the order, the Court will add this
information.
The
unopposed motion to be relieved is GRANTED and effective upon filing a proof of
service showing service of the signed Form MC-053 order and this order on Filipino
American Community of Los Angeles Inc (FACLA) and all parties who have appeared.
However,
“a corporation cannot represent itself in a court of record either in propria persona
or through an officer or agent who is not an attorney.”  (Caressa Camille, Inc. v. Alcoholic Beverage
Control Appeals Bd. (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 1094, 1101.)  Plaintiff Filipino American Community of Los Angeles
Inc (FACLA) must retain new counsel before the December 15, 2023 Case Management
Conference or the Court may dismiss its claims.
An
Order to Show Case Re: Failure to Retain New Counsel For Filipino American Community
of Los Angeles Inc (FACLA) is scheduled for 12/15/2023 at 8:30 a.m. in Department
48 at Stanley Mosk Courthouse.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
