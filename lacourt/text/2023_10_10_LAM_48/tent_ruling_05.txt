On
April 11, 2023, Plaintiff Sarah M. Strandberg filed this action against Defendants
Inmaung F&M Corporation dba Thai Angel and Chavalit Inmaung.
On
September 8, 2023, Plaintiff filed (1) a motion to compel Thai Angel’s responses
to Form Interrogatories – General, Set One; (2) a motion to compel Chavalit Inmaung’s
responses to Form Interrogatories – General, Set One; (3) a motion to compel Thai
Angel’s responses to Form Interrogatories – Employment, Set One; (4) a motion to
compel Chavalit Inmaung’s responses to Form Interrogatories – Employment, Set One;
(5) a motion to compel Thai Angel’s responses to Request for Production, Set One;
and (6) a motion to compel Chavalit Inmaung’s responses to Request for Production,
Set One.
When
a party fails to serve timely responses to discovery requests, the court may make
an order compelling responses.  (Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 2030.290, 2031.300; Healthcare Consulting,
Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.)   A party that fails to serve timely responses
waives any objections to the request, including ones based on privilege or the protection
of attorney work product.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§§ 2030.290, subd. (a), 2031.300, subd. (a).) 
Sanctions shall be imposed against the party who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel, unless the party acted with substantial justification
or the sanction would otherwise be unjust. 
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (c), 2031.300, subd. (c).)
Defendants
filed no oppositions to these motions and did not serve responses to Plaintiff’s
discovery.  Accordingly, the motions to compel
are GRANTED, and Defendants are ordered to serve verified responses, without objection,
to Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatories – General, Form Interrogatories – Employment,
and Request for Production, Set One within 30 days.
Each
motion includes a request for monetary sanctions.  The Court will not award fees for time reviewing
an opposition and preparing a reply because the motions are unopposed.  The Court therefore finds that a reasonable total
sanction against Inmaung F&M Corporation dba Thai Angel is $2,767.50 (4.5 hours
at $575/hour [$2,587.50] plus three $60 filing fees [$180.00]) and against Chavalit
Inmaung is $2,767.50 (4.5 hours at $575/hour [$2,587.50] plus three $60 filing fees
[$180.00]).  Counsel for Defendants is ordered
to pay sanctions of $2,767.50 and $2,767.50 ($5,535.00 total) to Plaintiff within
30 days.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
