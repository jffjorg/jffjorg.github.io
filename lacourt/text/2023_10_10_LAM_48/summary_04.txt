And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is granting the defendant's motion to set aside the default judgment entered against them on March 8, 2023. The defendant's counsel had expected to file an answer on behalf of the defendant, but was not timely notified that the plaintiff was seeking a default judgment. The plaintiff's counsel had an ethical obligation to warn defense counsel, which was not fulfilled. The defendant timely filed their motion to set aside the default, and the judge finds that setting aside the default will not cause prejudice to the plaintiff. The judge orders the defendant to file a responsive pleading within five days. The hearing on the motion to strike the answer is advanced and vacated.
