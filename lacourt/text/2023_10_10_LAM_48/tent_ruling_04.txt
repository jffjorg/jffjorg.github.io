  CASE NO.: 22STCV15653
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING DEFENDANT’S MOTION
  TO SET ASIDE/VACATE DEFAULT
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
October 10, 2023



 
On May 10, 2022, Plaintiff Skye Anesthesia filed this action
against Defendant Law Offices of David Azizi and others.  On March 8, 2023, the Court entered default against
Defendant.  On March 15, 2023, Defendant filed
an answer, and on July 6, 2023, Plaintiff moved to strike the answer.
On August 23, 2023, Defendant filed a
motion to set aside/vacate default.

The Court may relieve a party or counsel from a judgment
resulting from mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b).)  The application for relief must be made within
a reasonable time, not to exceed six months, after the judgment.  (Ibid.)  “Section 473 is often applied liberally where
the party in default moves promptly to seek relief, and the party opposing the motion
will not suffer prejudice if relief is granted. 
[Citations.]  In such situations ‘very
slight evidence will be required to justify a court in setting aside the default.’  [Citation.]” 
(Elston v. City of Turlock (1985) 38 Cal.3d 227, 233.)
Defendant
timely filed this motion less than six months after entry of default.  Defendant’s counsel explains that he knew that
Mr. Azizi was communicating with Plaintiff’s counsel about dismissing Defendant.  (Ghermezian Decl. ¶ 2.)  When Plaintiff refused to dismiss Defendant, Defendant’s
counsel understood that Defendant expected him to file an answer on its behalf,
along with the answers for other defendants. 
(Ghermezian Decl. ¶ 2.)  Plaintiff’s
counsel did not provide timely notice that they were going to take Defendant’s default.  (Ghermezian Decl. ¶ 3.)
Plaintiff’s counsel had an ethical obligation to warn
defense counsel that Plaintiff was about to seek default judgment.  (See Lasalle v. Vogel (2019) 36 Cal.App.5th
127, 135 (Lasalle).)  On
June 23, 2022, Plaintiff’s counsel emailed Mr. Azizi and stated, “Please respond
to the complaint or I will default you.” 
(Schutzman Decl., Ex. A.)  Plaintiff
did not seek Defendant’s default until over eight months later, on March 8, 2023.  This is not sufficient notice that Plaintiff was
about to take Defendant’s default.
Plaintiff
has not shown any prejudice if the default is set aside, “given the relatively short
time between [Plaintiff] seeking the default and [Defendant] asking to be relieved
from it.”  (Lasalle, supra, 36 Cal.App.5th
at pp. 138-139.)  “‘When evaluating a motion
to set aside a default judgment on equitable grounds, the “court must weigh the
reasonableness of the conduct of the moving party in light of the extent of the
prejudice to the responding party.”’ [Citation.]”  (Id. at p. 139.)  As in Lasalle, setting aside this default
involves little wasted time.
Accordingly,
the motion to set aside the March 8, 2023 entry of default is GRANTED.  Defendant is ordered to file a responsive pleading
within five days.
On
the Court’s own motion, the Hearing on Motion to Strike the Answer of Law Offices
of David Azizi set for 02/29/2024 at 08:30 AM is advanced to this date and vacated.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
