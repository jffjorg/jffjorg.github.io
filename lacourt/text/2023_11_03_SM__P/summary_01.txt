And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Vaatete v. Lyft, Inc. et al. (Case No. 23SMCV03631) regarding Lyft's motion to compel arbitration. The case involves a car accident between a Lyft driver and a pedestrian, Vaatete, who was injured. Vaatete argues that the arbitration agreement does not cover her claims because she was a pedestrian at the time of the accident, and that the agreement is unconscionable. The judge has ruled that Vaatete did assent to the terms of service (TOS) and arbitration agreement by accepting the updated TOS and having the opportunity to review them. The judge has also ruled that the delegation clause in the arbitration agreement is enforceable and will be decided by the arbitrator. Finally, the judge has ruled that the FAA governs the case and that the matter should be referred to arbitration despite the risk of inconsistent rulings in the litigation against the Lyft driver.
