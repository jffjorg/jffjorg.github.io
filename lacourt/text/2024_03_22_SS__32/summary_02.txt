And here is the English-text summary:

The Court's tentative ruling addresses a motion for a protective order filed by the defendant, The Bicycle Casino, LP, in a case involving the wrongful death of Decedent Jonathan Dongin Jung. The defendant seeks to avoid responding to discovery requests propounded by the plaintiffs, alleging that the requests are excessive, unduly burdensome, and intended to harass. The plaintiffs argue that the discovery requests are relevant and necessary to prove their claims.

The Court finds that the motion is timely and that the defendant has not shown good cause to grant a protective order as to the remaining discovery requests. However, the Court grants the motion in part, finding that the discovery requests propounded by Vanessa Jung Tirman and Special Interrogatories, Set Two, numbers 36-137, propounded by Sik Jung, do not need to be answered by the defendant.

The Court also notes that a motion for protective order is scheduled for June 3, 2024, and that counsel for the defendant must give notice and file a proof of service of such. The Court admonishes counsel to meet and confer and attempt to resolve their issues before filing further discovery motions.
