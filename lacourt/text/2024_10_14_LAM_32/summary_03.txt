Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to consolidate two separate actions filed by the plaintiff, John Hensley, against the defendant, Edward Joseph Rachal, and others. The motion was filed by the defendant L&R Auto Parks, Inc. (erroneously sued as Joe's Auto Parks 212 E. 7th – Spoleto, LLC) on September 17, 2024. The plaintiff filed a notice of non-opposition on October 1, 2024. The judge has denied the motion to consolidate because it must be heard in the earlier case, 22STCV31707, and not in the current case, 24STCV01480. The judge has referred to California Rules of Court, Rule 3.350, which governs the procedure for consolidating cases.
