And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for leave to file a first amended complaint. The plaintiff, America Sanchez, filed the original complaint against Lockheed Martin and Henry Roman on November 14, 2023, alleging causes of action for sex discrimination, sexual harassment, retaliation, and others. On August 14, 2024, the plaintiff filed a motion to file a first amended complaint, which adds new claims based on disability discrimination, failure to accommodate, failure to engage, and retaliation. The court found that the new claims are "material to the case" and "consistent with the original action", and that permitting the amendment is more efficient than allowing the plaintiff to file a separate action. The court granted the motion and ordered the plaintiff to file the amended complaint within 5 days.
