  order RE:
r&m’s motion to compel further
  responses to requests for production (CRS# 9362) 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On March 15, 2023, Plaintiffs BFF
Construction, Inc. (BFF) and RB Realty Management, LLC (RB) filed this action
against Defendants R&M Bro’s Construction Inc. (R&M) and Miguel Duarte
Olmos (Duarte). Plaintiffs filed the operative First Amended Complaint on March
5, 2024, alleging (1) breach of contract, (2) implied indemnity, (3)
negligence, (4) conversion, (5) fraud, (6) money had and received, (7) breach
of contract, (8) conversion, and (9) money had and received.  
            The case involves a construction
project that took place in Ventura County. The property is owned by RB. BFF was
the general contractor on the project, and R&M was the subcontractor.
Duarte owns and operates R&M. The complaint alleges that R&M performed
its work negligently, causing multiple shutdowns and delays. BFF terminated
R&M from the project, and Duarte allegedly retaliated by vandalizing the
property and destroying or stealing certain materials. R&M also allegedly
absconded with money meant for paying BFF’s vendors. R&M and Duarte have
also cross-complained against BFF and RB, seeking damages for unpaid work and
alleged physical injuries. 
            On September 13, 2024, R&M filed
the instant motion to compel BFF’s further responses to requests for
production. BFF filed its opposition on October 1, 2024. R&M filed its
reply on October 7, 2024.    
LEGAL STANDARD
Upon receiving responses to its discovery
requests, the propounding party may move for an order compelling further
responses if the responses are incomplete or evasive, or objections are without
merit or too general. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300(a), 2031.310(a),
2033.290(a).) The party seeking production of documents
bears the initial burden of showing good cause through a fact-specific showing
of relevance. (Kirkland v. Superior Court (2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 92, 98.)
Once this showing is made, the burden shifts to the responding party to justify
any objections. (Ibid.) 
DISCUSSION
            A motion to compel further must be
accompanied by a meet and confer declaration demonstrating an attempt to
resolve the matter informally. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300(b)(1),
2031.310(b), 2033.290(b).) “A meet and confer declaration in support of a
motion shall state facts showing a reasonable and good faith attempt at an
informal resolution of each issue presented by the motion.” (Id.,
§ 2016.040.) 
            R&M’s evidence in support of the
motion does not demonstrate sufficient meet and confer regarding the particular
RFPs at issue. (See Tiwana Decl.) R&M’s email merely concluded that “RFP
Request Nos. 2 through 65 are deficient to the extent that most of those
requests have been ignored.” (Id., Ex. E.) Broadly concluding that
nearly all of the RFP responses are deficient does not constitute a good faith
attempt to address “each issue” in the motion. (See Code Civ. Proc., §
2016.040.) 
            R&M’s reply declaration contains
no additional evidence of meet and confer on the RFPs beyond the same broad
conclusions reflected in the original declaration. (See Tiwana Reply Decl., Ex.
C [“the responses to RFP Request Nos. 2 through 65 are deficient to the extent
that most of those requests have been ignored”]; Ex. D [“Request Nos. 3 thru 65
have been evaded in spite of extensive meet and confer”].)  
            Given the volume of requests at
issue, the Court is not inclined to compel further responses without a showing
that the parties met and conferred on the specific issues raised in the motion.
The lack of adequate meet and confer is evident in R&M’s own separate
statement, which shows that BFF properly responded to many of the RFPs by stating
that it will produce all responsive non-privileged documents in its possession.
Clearly, BFF did not ignore or evade most of the RFPs, as claimed in R&M’s
correspondence. A proper meet and confer could have narrowed the actual issues
in contention.   
Some of R&M’s arguments pertain to the
completeness of BFF’s production. However, BFF’s production is not at issue in
this motion, as this is a motion to compel further responses. In any case, R&M’s
skepticism as to the completeness of the production is not a reason to compel a
further response or production. 
CONCLUSION
            R&M’s
motion to compel further responses

BACKGROUND
            On March 15, 2023, Plaintiffs BFF
Construction, Inc. (BFF) and RB Realty Management, LLC (RB) filed this action
against Defendants R&M Bro’s Construction Inc. (R&M) and Miguel Duarte
Olmos (Duarte). Plaintiffs filed the operative First Amended Complaint on March
5, 2024, alleging (1) breach of contract, (2) implied indemnity, (3)
negligence, (4) conversion, (5) fraud, (6) money had and received, (7) breach
of contract, (8) conversion, and (9) money had and received.  
            The case involves a construction

Duarte owns and operates R&M. The complaint alleges that R&M performed

also cross-complained against BFF and RB, seeking damages for unpaid work and
alleged physical injuries. 
            On September 13, 2024, BFF filed the
instant two motions to compel R&M’s and Duarte’s further responses to form
interrogatories. R&M and Duarte filed their joint opposition on October 1,
2024. BFF filed its reply on October 7, 2024.

responses if the responses are incomplete or evasive, or objections are without
merit or too general. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300(a), 2031.310(a),

MEET AND CONFER
            A motion to compel further must be
accompanied by a meet and confer declaration demonstrating an attempt to
resolve the matter informally. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300(b)(1),
2031.310(b), 2033.290(b).) The Court finds that BFF has satisfied the meet and
confer requirement. (See Ardalan Decl.) 
DISCUSSION
I.
FROG No. 8.7
            FROG No. 8.7 asks R&M and Duarte
to state the total income lost as a result of the incident, and to show how
that amount was calculated. “Incident” is defined as the circumstances and
events surrounding R&M’s work on the subject properties. Specifically,
Duarte alleges that he suffered injuries after falling down a 25-foot hole on
the construction site. 
            R&M’s and Duarte’s responses
state that Duarte has been unable to perform a significant portion of his job
since the injury and has been forced to forgo certain opportunities and
projects. The responses claim that the calculation is subject to expert
analysis and that discovery is ongoing. This is a sufficient response to this
particular FROG. BFF may propound additional discovery if it seeks further
information.   
            The motions are DENIED as to FROG
No. 8.7.    
II.
FROG No. 15.1
            FROG No. 15.1 asks R&M and
Duarte to identify facts, witnesses, and documents supporting each denial of a
material allegation and each affirmative defense. Duarte’s response contained
only objections, and R&M’s response contained objections and a narrative
summary of its theory of the case. Neither R&M nor Duarte identified each
material denial or affirmative defense, or provided the requisite information
on each. This renders the responses defective. 

            A party “is entitled to demand
answers to its interrogatories, as a matter of right . . . [and] the burden of
justifying any objection and failure to respond remains at all times with the
party resisting an interrogatory.” (Williams v. Sup. Ct. (2017) 3
Cal.5th 531, 541.) R&M and Duarte do not attempt to justify the objections
in their responses. Their only argument is that BFF did not properly respond to
FROG No. 15.1 either. However, the sufficiency of BFF’s discovery responses has
no bearing on R&M’s and Duarte’s obligations. 
R&M and Duarte argue that they
provided more information in response to this FROG than BFF did in its response
to the same FROG. But that does not mean R&M and Duarte provided responsive
information. As stated above, FROG No. 15.1 asks for discrete information on
each material denial and affirmative defense. It does not ask for “a 900+ word factual
summary of their case.” (See Opp. 6:9-10.) The fact that R&M and Duarte
have produced 3,892 pages of documents has no bearing on whether their response
to FROG No. 15.1 is sufficient. 
The motions are GRANTED as to FROG No.
15.1. 
CONCLUSION
            BFF’s motions to compel further
response to form interrogatories are GRANTED in part as set forth above.
Sanctions are denied.

BACKGROUND
            On March 15, 2023, Plaintiffs BFF
Construction, Inc. (BFF) and RB Realty Management, LLC (RB) filed this action
against Defendants R&M Bro’s Construction Inc. (R&M) and Miguel Duarte
Olmos (Duarte). Plaintiffs filed the operative First Amended Complaint on March
5, 2024, alleging (1) breach of contract, (2) implied indemnity, (3)
negligence, (4) conversion, (5) fraud, (6) money had and received, (7) breach
of contract, (8) conversion, and (9) money had and received.  
            The case involves a construction

the general contractor on the project, and R&M was the subcontractor.
Duarte owns and operates R&M. The complaint alleges that R&M performed

also cross-complained against BFF and RB, seeking damages for unpaid work and

            On September 13, 2024, R&M filed
the instant motion to compel BFF’s further responses to form interrogatories.
BFF filed its opposition on October 1, 2024. R&M filed its reply on October
7, 2024.   
LEGAL STANDARD
Upon receiving responses to its discovery
requests, the propounding party may move for an order compelling further
responses if the responses are incomplete or evasive, or objections are without
merit or too general. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300(a), 2031.310(a),
2033.290(a).) The party seeking production of documents
bears the initial burden of showing good cause through a fact-specific showing
of relevance. (Kirkland v. Superior Court (2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 92, 98.)
Once this showing is made, the burden shifts to the responding party to justify
any objections. (Ibid.) 
MEET AND CONFER
            A motion to compel further must be
accompanied by a meet and confer declaration demonstrating an attempt to
resolve the matter informally. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300(b)(1),
2031.310(b), 2033.290(b).) The Court finds that R&M has satisfied the meet
and confer requirement. (See Tiwana Decl. ¶¶ 5-7; Ardalan Decl., Ex. B.) 
DISCUSSION
I.
FROG No. 305
            FROG Nos. 305.12 and 305.13 ask
about BFF’s repairs of any “construction claim” or “construction defect claim”
that BFF alleges existed. During meet and confer, the parties agreed on
narrowed definitions for “construction claim” and “construction defect claim”
and also agreed that BFF would answer the FROGs despite not owning the subject
property. (Tiwana Decl. ISO MTC RFPs, Ex. B.)  
BFF’s responses merely reiterate its
allegation that R&M absconded with materials and left BFF to hire other
contractors to complete the work. This does not provide all of the information
requested in the FROGs, which have discrete subparts seeking specific information.

BFF also responded that it would produce
documents under Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.230. However, BFF has not
made the requisite showing to invoke section 2030.230, i.e., that
answering the FROGs would require “the making of a compilation, abstract,
audit, or summary of” documents, and the burden of doing so is the same for
both parties. Reference to external documents is not warranted merely because
the answer to an interrogatory may be found within. If BFF can answer the
interrogatories, it must simply do so. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.220(a) [“Each
answer in a response to interrogatories shall be as complete and
straightforward as the information reasonably available to the responding party
permits”].) 
The motion is GRANTED as to FROG Nos.
305.12 and 305.13.   
II.
FROG No. 311
            FROG Nos. 311.2, 311.3, and 311.4
ask about diagrams, reproductions, models, reports, and inspections concerning
any “construction claim” or “construction defect claim.” In response to FROG
Nos. 311.2 and 311.3, BFF denied the existence of responsive documents. In
response to FROG No. 311.4, BFF stated that Bahram Fata (BFF’s principal) “inspected
the both property sites on a regular, and ongoing basis, including on or about
January 13, 2023.” 
            BFF’s answers are responsive.
R&M mainly takes issue with BFF’s objections. However, BFF is entitled to
assert objections to preserve them while providing responsive information.
R&M’s skepticism about BFF’s claim that it has no responsive documents is
not a reason to compel a further response. 
            The motion is DENIED as to FROG Nos.
311.2, 311.3, and 311.4. 
 
 
III.
FROG No. 313
            FROG No. 313.1 asks BFF to describe
each “construction claim” or “construction defect claim” that was concealed
from it. FROG No. 313.2 asks BFF to describe each concealment or
misrepresentation made to it in connection with the provision of services or supplies
to the subject property. 
            BFF objected to the requests and did
not respond. In its opposition, BFF argues that the FROGs are either unrelated
to its fraud claim or unrelated to the subject property. This is an overly
narrow conception of relevance. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2017.010.) “Construction
claims” and “construction defect claims,” as defined by the parties in meet and
confer, are relevant to the issues in the complaint and cross-complaint. If BFF
contends that information on a “construction claim” or “construction defect
claim” was concealed from it, then it must answer FROG No. 313.1. R&M’s
alleged fraud about being a subcontractor on the project is sufficiently
related to the subject property. Thus, BFF must detail that alleged fraud in
response to FROG No. 313.2. 
            The motion is GRANTED as to FROG
Nos. 313.1 and 313.2.  
IV.
FROG No. 314
            FROG No. 314.7 asks BFF if it
contracted out any of the work it was to perform on the subject property to
another person or entity, and to provide certain information if so. BFF
objected and did not respond. 
            BFF argues that the interrogatory is
harassing, burdensome, and irrelevant because there were two construction
projects on the subject property spanning years. BFF also argues that it is
vague whether subcontracted work is responsive to the request because the
definition of “you” is broad. 
These arguments are without merit. BFF
fails to demonstrate how providing the discrete information requested by the
FROG would be unduly burdensome just because there were two construction
projects. BFF also declares the information to be irrelevant without
explanation. Whether BFF contracted out the work on the property is relevant to
the claims being asserted in this action, which arise from work on the
property. Lastly, the request is not vague. It is a standard form interrogatory
drafted by the Judicial Council. The definition of “you” is clear, and
“contracted out” clearly includes subcontracting. 
The motion is GRANTED as to FROG No.
314.7. 
V.
FROG No. 321
            FROG Nos. 321.1 through 321.11 ask
various questions about BFF’s work on the subject property. The interrogatories
are related to the subject matter of the litigation or are reasonably
calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. (See Code Civ.
Proc., § 2017.010.) 
            The motion is GRANTED as to FROG
Nos. 321.1 through 321.11. 
CONCLUSION
            R&M’s motion to compel further
responses to form interrogatories is GRANTED in part as set forth above.
Sanctions are denied.
