  Case No.:  23STCV27862
  Hearing Date:  October 14, 2024
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
plaintiff’s motion for leave to file
  first amended complaint 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On November 14, 2023, Plaintiff
America Sanchez filed this action against Defendants Lockheed Martin and Henry
Roman, asserting causes of action for (1) sex discrimination, (2) sexual
harassment, (3) retaliation, (4) failure to prevent, (5) negligent hiring, (6)
violation of Labor Code section 1102.5, and (7) intentional infliction of
emotional distress. 
            On August 14, 2024, Plaintiff filed
the instant motion for leave to file a first amended complaint. Defendant
Lockheed Martin filed its opposition on October 1, 2024. 
LEGAL STANDARD
“The plaintiff and defendant,
respectively, may be allowed, on motion, to make a supplemental complaint or
answer, alleging facts material to the case occurring after the former
complaint or answer.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 464(a).) “A ‘supplemental’ pleading
is used to allege facts occurring after the original pleading was filed.” (Foster
v. Sexton (2021) 61 Cal.App.5th 998, 1032.) “In contrast, the additional
allegations in an ‘amended’ pleading address matters that had occurred before
the original pleading was filed.” (Ibid.) The facts in a supplemental
complaint must be “material to the case,” meaning “in furtherance and
consistent with the original action.” (Gonzales v. Arbelbide (1957) 155
Cal.App.2d 721, 727.) “[C]ourts should exercise liberality in permitting the
filing of supplemental pleadings when the alleged ‘occurring-after’ facts are
pertinent to the case.” (Flood v. Simpson (1975) 45 Cal.App.3d 644, 647.)

DISCUSSION
            Plaintiff’s proposed FAC adds causes
of action based on: (i) disability discrimination; (ii) failure to accommodate;
(iii) failure to engage; and (iv) retaliation. While these new claims are based
on facts occurring after Plaintiff filed the original complaint, they are
“material to the case” and “consistent with the original action.” (See Code
Civ. Proc., § 464(a); Gonzales, supra, 155 Cal.App.2d at p. 727.) The
new claims arise from further discrimination occurring within the course of the
same employment. Plaintiff also alleges retaliation in the proposed FAC, which
relates to both the earlier claims and the new ones, i.e., Plaintiff was
retaliated against for reporting the earlier sexual harassment and later
disability discrimination. 
            While Plaintiff could file a
separate action, it would inevitably be related and likely consolidated, as the
motive for Plaintiff's termination is related to the allegations in the
original complaint. Thus, it is more efficient to allow Plaintiff to file an
amended complaint with the new allegations. 
The court has discretion to permit amendments that set forth new claims arising
after commencement of the action. (Hong v. Financial Corporation of America (1992)
6 Cal.App.4th 960, 966 [Employee defamation claim against employer
arose after harassment action was filed.)
CONCLUSION
            Plaintiff’s motion for leave to file
first amended complaint is GRANTED.  Amended
Complaint to be filed within 5 days of this order.
