JOHN HENSLEY,
                        Plaintiff,
            v.
 
EDWARD JOSEPH RACHAL,
  et al., 
                        Defendants.
  


 
  Case No.:  24STCV01480
  Hearing Date:  October 14, 2024
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
motion to consolidate 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On January 19, 2024, Plaintiff John
Hensley filed this action against Edward Joseph Rachal (Rachal) and numerous
other defendants. The complaint asserts causes of action for (1) negligence,
(2) negligent hiring, (3) vicarious liability, (4) premises liability, and (5)
negligent undertaking. 
            The complaint stems from injuries
Plaintiff suffered after being shot by Rachal, a security guard working near a
parking garage located at 832 South Francisco Street, Los Angeles. Besides
Rachal, the defendants consist of individuals and entities that allegedly hired
Rachal, employed security at the location of the incident, or owned or operated
the parking garage. 
            Prior to this action, on September
28, 2022, Plaintiff filed another action titled John Hensley v. Edward
Joseph Rachal, et al. (22STCV31707). That complaint contained causes of
action for (1) negligence, (2) negligent hiring, (3) assault, (4) battery, (5)
negligent infliction of emotional distress, (6) intentional infliction of
emotional distress, and (7) punitive damages. The complaint arose from the same
incident, i.e., Rachal shooting Plaintiff. 
            On September 17, 2024, Defendant
L&R Auto Parks, Inc. (erroneously sued as Joe’s Auto Parks 212 E. 7th –
Spoleto, LLC) filed the instant motion to consolidate the two actions.
Plaintiff filed a notice of non-opposition on October 1, 2024. 
LEGAL STANDARD
While a notice of motion to consolidate
must “[b]e filed in each case sought to be consolidated,” the “memorandums,
declarations, and other supporting papers must be filed only in the lowest
numbered case.” (Cal. Rules of Ct., Rule 3.350(a)(1)(C), (a)(2)(A).) In other
words, the motion itself must be heard in the earlier case. Furthermore, “[u]nless
otherwise provided in the order granting the motion to consolidate, the lowest
numbered case in the consolidated case is the lead case.” (Id., Rule
3.350(b).)   
DISCUSSION
            This Court cannot hear the merits of
the motion to consolidate because the motion must be heard in the lowest
numbered case, 22STCV31707. (See Cal. Rules of Ct., Rule 3.350(a)(2)(A).) 
CONCLUSION
            Defendant L&R Auto Parks, Inc.’s
motion to consolidate is DENIED.
