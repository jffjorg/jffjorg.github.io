BACKGROUND
A. FactualOn April 17, 2023, Plaintiff, Ali Mohaved (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint against Defendant, BMW of North America, LLC, and DOES 1 through 100. The Complaint alleges causes of action for: (1) Violation of Song-Beverly Act – Breach of Express Warranty; (2) Violation of Song-Beverly Act – Breach of Implied Warranty; and (3) Violation of the Song-Beverly Act § 1793.2(b).    The moving papers indicate that on September 8, 2023, Plaintiff propounded his Requests for Production of Documents, Set Two on Defendant, BMW. Plaintiff notes that the responses were due on October 10, 2023, but that despite this, BMW served no responses, nor requested an extension of time to respond. On October 16, 2023, Plaintiff states that he sent a detailed meet and confer letter to BMW, notifying BMW that no responses, and no documents, had been received in responses to the RFP, Set Two, and that as a result, BMW’s objections were waived. On October 27, 2023, Plaintiff also notes that his counsel sent a follow up meet and confer letter to memorialize a conversation with BMW’s attorney had, where BMW’s attorney pledged to respond by November 3, 2023. Plaintiff notes that the responses were sent on November 3, 2023, and were unverified, included no document production, and had objections.    B. ProceduralOn January 5, 2024, Plaintiff filed this Motion to Compel. To date, no opposition has been filed.  
II. ANALYSIS Motions to Compel Responses   Legal Standard  Where there has been no timely response to a Code of Civil Procedure § 2031.010 demand, the demanding party must seek an order compelling a response. (CCP § 2031.300.) Failure to timely respond waives all objections, including privilege and work product. Thus, unless the party to whom the demand was directed obtains relief from waiver, he or she cannot raise objections to the documents demanded. There is no deadline for a motion to compel responses. Likewise, for failure to respond, the moving party need not attempt to resolve the matter outside court before filing the motion. Where the motion seeks only a response to the inspection demand, no showing of "good cause" is required.¿  Discussion   Here, Defendant BMW served tardy, unverified responses that contained objections, and failed to contain any document production. Based on the fact alone that BMW’s responses were late would ensure that they should have been served without objections. Here, this Court orders BMW to provide Plaintiff with verified, code-compliant responses to Requests for Production, Set Two, without objections, and with the documents requested, by March 29, 2023.   III. CONCLUSIONFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel BMW’s responses to Requests for Production of Documents, Set Two, without objections is  GRANTED. Code-compliant, verified, and unobjected to responses are due to Plaintiff by March 29, 2024.   Plaintiff is ordered to give notice.
