```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a petition to approve a compromise of the claims of three plaintiffs, including two minors, against a landlord for alleged violations of the implied warranty of habitability. The compromise is for $720,000, with the two minors receiving $70,000 each and the adult plaintiff receiving $580,000. The court finds that the settlement is reasonable, but notes that the allocation of the settlement proceeds may need further explanation. The court is requesting further argument on why the current division of the settlement is reasonable, and will grant the petition to approve the compromise subject to this additional information.
