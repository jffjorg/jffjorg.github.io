 On March 12, 2024, Plaintiff Law Office of Fari Bari Nejadpour filed the operative Complaint against Defendants Ghazaleh Fatemi, Paul Pourhoma, and Seddigheh Khajavi for (1) breach of contract and (2) fraud/conspiracy to defraud.   For the breach of contract claim, Plaintiff alleges as follows: “On September 6, 2022, Defendant Ghazaleh Pourhoma Fatemi [ ] entered into an Hourly Legal Services Agreement [ ] with Plaintiff Law Office of Fari Bari Nejadpour [ ] whereunder Law Office undertook to defend Fatemi in a marital dissolution case brought by Fatemi's husband, Amir Shahram Fatemi, entitled, Amir Shahram Fatemi v. Ghazaleh Fatemi, LASC Case No. 22STFL09569. By the Agreement, Defendant Fatemi agreed in writing to pay the Law Office attorney's fees at the rate of $600/hour plus costs. Defendant Fatemi agreed to pay a retainer fee of $10,000.00. She paid only $5,000.00. Law Office represented Fatemi from September 6, 2022, until November 17, 2023, when Law Office substituted: out of the case. Over that period, Fatemi accumulated unpaid attorney's fees and costs of $167,030.72, which sum is now due and owing. On February 20, 2024, Fatemi entered into a stipulated judgment in her marital dissolution case in which Fatemi agreed to accept, and Amir Shahram Fatemi agreed to pay, $213,500. Rather than pay the attorney's fees and costs due and owing, Fatemi instead breached the Agreement by choosing not to pay any of the $167,030.72 to the Law Office.” For the second cause of action, the allegations are as follows: “On September 6, 2022, Defendant Ghazaleh Fatemi [ ] entered into an Hourly Legal Services Agreement wherein the Law Office of Fari Bari Nejadpour [ ] agreed to represent Defendant Fatemi in a marital dissolution case, Amir Shahram Fatemi v. Ghazaleh Fatemi, LASC Case No. 22STFL09569, and Fatemi promised to pay the Law Office attorney's fees at a rate of $600/hour plus costs. In turn, Defendant Fatemi's parents, Defendant Paul Pourhoma and Defendant Seddigheh Khajavi, joined Defendant Fatemi upon the September 6, 2022, retention of Plaintiff Law Office at the Law Office and said that Defendant Fatemi is their daughter, they are going to support her, and they promised to help Defendant Fatemi pay Defendant Fatemi's attorney's fees and costs, as well. . . . On or about February 20, 2024, Defendant Fatemi conspired with her father, Defendant Paul Pourhoma, and her mother, Seddigheh Khajavi, to circumvent Plaintiff Law Office and thereby avoid paying Law Office the $167,030.72 due and owing by diverting the $213,500.00 to Defendants Pourhoma and Khajavi in hopes of thereby concealing Defendant Fatemi's ability to  pay Plaintiff Law Office from the Law Office and put the $213,500.00 out of Plaintiff Law Office's reach.”Defendants now demur to both causes of action for failure to state sufficient facts.When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in context, and “treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law.” (Serrano v. Priest (1971) 5 Cal.3d 584, 591.)  “A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters. Therefore, it lies only where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed. The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters, states a cause of action.”  (Hahn v. Mirda¿(2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)  It is error “to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend if the plaintiff shows there is a reasonable possibility any defect identified by the defendant can be cured by amendment.”  (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist.¿(1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 967.) Defendants first argue that the litigation privilege applies.  The litigation privilege set forth in Civ. Code § 47 generally applies “to any communication (1) made in judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings; (2) by litigants or other participants authorized by law; (3) to achieve the objects of the litigation; and (4) that have some connection or logical relation to the action.”  (Silberg v. Anderson (1990) 509 Cal.3d 205, 212.)   Statements made in anticipation of litigation are subject to the litigation privilege.  (Briggs v. Eden Council for Hope and Opportunity (1999) 19 Cal.4th 1106, 1115.)  The “principle purpose of [the litigation privilege] is to afford litigants . . . the utmost freedom of access to the courts without fear of being harassed subsequently by derivative tort actions.”  (Id. at p. 213.) “[W]hether the litigation privilege applies to an action for breach of contract turns on whether its application furthers the policies underlying the privilege.”  (Wentland v. Wass (2005) 126 Cal.App.4th 1484, 1492.)   The litigation privilege does not apply because neither cause of action targets communications made in furtherance of litigation.  The basis for liability for the first cause of action is that Fatemi failed to pay contractual attorneys’ fees after having obtained money pursuant to a settlement.  The basis for the second cause of action is that Defendants falsely promised to pay these fees when they had no intention to do so.  This cause of action targets (a) the communication that there would be payment and (b) the action of transferring the settlement funds amongst the Defendants so as to avoid paying Plaintiff.  The settlement itself and its negotiations are not at issue and neither is any communication within a lawsuit.  Defendants’ argument would mean that an attorney cannot sue a client for contractual fees, and that is clearly not the law. For these same reasons, Defendants’ anti-SLAPP motion set to be heard in August 2024 should be withdrawn.  Neither cause of action arises from or is premised on protected activity (CCP § 425.16(e)), and the litigation privilege simply does not apply.   Defendants next make the argument that Plaintiff admitted that Fatemi did not pay $5,000 in retainer fees—which is a condition precedent of the subject agreement—such that no contract exists.  This lacks merit because it is based on Defendants citing an inapplicable provision about how the attorney will not take action unless “court fees” are tendered.  This has no relation to the retainer fee.  Furthermore, if services were rendered despite the retainer fee, this would merely mean waiver of that fee or some other analysis.  It would not invalidate the contract, and, even then, relief would be available in quantum meruit.  Defendants also seem to complain that the subject agreement was not attached to the Complaint.  Its legal effect, however, has been sufficiently alleged.  (See Miles v. Deutsche Bank Nat'l Trust Co. (2015) 236 Cal. App. 4th 394, 402.)Finally, Defendants argue that the fraud/conspiracy claim is not particularly pleaded.  “The elements of fraud, which give rise to the tort action for deceit, are (a) misrepresentation (false representation, concealment, or nondisclosure); (b) knowledge of falsity (or ‘scienter’); (c) intent to defraud, i.e., to induce reliance; (d) justifiable reliance; and (e) resulting damage.”  (Lazar v. Superior Court (1996) 12 Cal.4th 631, 638, internal quotation marks omitted.) “[F]raud must be pled specifically; general and conclusory allegations do not suffice. [Citations] Thus the policy of liberal construction of the pleadings . . . will not ordinarily be invoked to sustain a pleading defective in any material respect.  This particularity requirement necessitates pleading facts which show how, when, where, to whom, and by what means the representations were tendered.”  (Lazar v. Superior Court (1996) 12 Cal.4th 631, 645, internal quotation marks omitted.)  As discussed above, Plaintiff adequately alleges that on September 6, 2022, all Defendants, in-person and orally, stated to Plaintiff, at the law office, that they would pay all accrued fees, when they had no intention to do so.  This is sufficiently specific.  The Demurrer is overruled.  The anti-SLAPP motion should be withdrawn.  An answer is to be filed within 20 days.  Moving parties to give notice.If counsel do not submit on the tentative, they are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
