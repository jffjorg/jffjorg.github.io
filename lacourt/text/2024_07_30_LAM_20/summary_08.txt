Summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is in response to a demurrer filed by the defendants, Ghazaleh Fatemi, Paul Pourhoma, and Seddigheh Khajavi, against the plaintiff, Law Office of Fari Bari Nejadpour. The plaintiff is seeking to recover unpaid attorney's fees and costs arising from a breach of contract and fraud/conspiracy to defraud. The defendants argue that the litigation privilege applies, but the judge finds that it does not because the causes of action do not target communications made in furtherance of litigation. The judge also rejects the defendants' argument that the plaintiff admitted that Fatemi did not pay a retainer fee, finding that this is based on an inapplicable provision. The judge overrules the demurrer and orders the defendants to file an answer within 20 days. The judge also recommends that the anti-SLAPP motion be withdrawn.
