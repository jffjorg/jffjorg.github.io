DISCUSSION:
 
Motion to Compel Compliance 
 
            Plaintiff
moves to compel Defendant’s compliance with the Court’s February 27, 2023 order
under the Court’s inherent authority to compel compliance with its orders under
Code of Civil Procedure section 128(a)(4).
 
Analysis
 
            On February
27, 2023, the Court issued an order granting Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel
Further Responses to Requests for Production. The Court considered Defendant’s
objections and responses to Requests Nos. 1, 17, 20, 24-27, 32, 37, 40, 44,
48-51, 56, 61, 64, 85, 86, 100, 110, 120, 125-28, and 139 and found the
objections to be without merit and the responses to be improperly evasive.
(February 27, 2023 Minute Order.) The Court ordered Defendant to produce
further responses that were verified, code-compliant, and without objections
within 60 days of the order, including Electronically Stored Information (ESI)
and email searches. (Id.) 
 
            On April
28, 2023, Defendant served unverified responses that, in large part, stated
that the production would be limited to all documents that are in Defendant’s
possession, custody, and control and as to which no objections are being made.
(See Declaration of Alexus Ringstad ISO Mot. ¶ 4 Exh. 2 Nos. 1, 17, 20, 24-27.)
Unverified responses are “tantamount to no responses at all.” (Appleton v.
Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 632, 636.) Moreover, the Court
expressly ordered verified responses without objections on February 27, 2023,
and also ordered production of ESI and email searches. Defendant has not provided
valid responses as ordered by the Court. 
 
            In response
to this motion, Defendant entirely fails to address the sufficiency of its
responses, except to claim that it has been “inundated” and therefore unable to
comply with the Court’s order to produce ESI and email searches because it is
attempting to redact the emails it has gathered which contain personally
identifiable information. Defendant justifies the delay in that respect as the
result of extensive discussions with Plaintiff’s counsel regarding the scope of
ESI searches. (See Declaration of Ricardo Azcarraga ISO Opp. ¶¶ 10-12.)
 
In reply, Plaintiff concedes that
Defendant served verifications on January 11, 2024, and responsive documents on
January 11 and 12. (Declaration of Hannah Theophil ISO Reply ¶¶ 11, 19.)
Plaintiff states that further responses are no longer sought as to requests 17,
44, 48-51, 56, 61, 64, and 100, but that Defendant’s responses remain
insufficient as to Requests Nos. 1, 20, 24-27, 32, 37, 40, 85, 86, 110, 120,
125-28, and 139. Plaintiff also contends that efforts to meet and confer in
January 2024 revealed Defendant had only conducted native language searches,
rather than using search terms selected by Plaintiff. (Theophil Decl. ¶ 28.) Further,
Plaintiff states that Defendant has still failed to produce responsive emails.
(Theophil Decl. ¶ 32.) Plaintiff also states that Defendant has not cured the
improper limitations of the scope of its April 28 responses. (Theophil Decl. ¶¶
10, 34.) 
 
            The Court concurs
with Plaintiff. Defendant’s justifications do not suffice to account for a full
year’s delay in providing responsive emails sought by Plaintiff.
Moreover, redaction of confidential information is not a valid justification
where the parties have stipulated to a protective order regarding the handling
of that information, as they did here on October 10, 2022. Plaintiff is
entitled to an order compelling compliance with the Court’s February 27, 2023
Order. 
 
Sanctions
 
            Plaintiff
also requests sanctions in the amount of $4,250 from Defendant for its failure
to comply. Code of Civil Procedure
section 2023.030 authorizes the Court to impose monetary sanctions on any
attorney engaging in the misuse of the discovery process by requiring that
attorney to pay the reasonable expenses incurred by anyone because of that
conduct. Plaintiff’s request is based on 10 hours of attorney time incurred by
Alexus Ringstad on this motion at an hourly rate of $425. (Ringstad Decl. ¶
10.) The Court finds this request to be somewhat inflated given the basis of
the motion. The Court will therefore award reduced sanctions in the amount of
$2,550, reflecting 6 hours of attorney time at $425. 
 
CONCLUSION:

 
            Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion to
Compel Compliance is GRANTED.
 
            Defendant is ordered to produce verified, code-compliant responses without objections or limitations within 20
days of this order, including electronically stored information and email
searches using the terms specified by Plaintiff in the reply brief, as to Requests
Nos. 1, 20, 24-27, 32, 37, 40, 85, 86, 110, 120, 125-28, and 139.
 
            Plaintiff’s request for sanctions is
GRANTED against Defendant in the amount of $2,550.00. Payment is to be made
within 30 days of this order.
 
            Moving
Party to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.

conduct a hearing if any party appears. By submitting on the tentative you
have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you
should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an
order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
