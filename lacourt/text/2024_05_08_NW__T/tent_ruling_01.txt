  Case Number:  22STCV34393    Hearing Date:   May 8, 2024    Dept:  T De Los
Santos v T&R 22STCV34394
Tentative
ruling: Motion to dismiss-Deny.  The Third
Amended Complaint was timely filed on 4/29/2024 although there is no proof of
service attached.  The court is not inclined
to dismiss for lack of a proof of service. 
However, POS must be filed forthwith. 
Mr. Rapaport’s declaration states that the TAC was not filed but it is clearly
in the court file.
