 Case Number:  24VECV00240    Hearing Date:   May 8, 2024    Dept:  T 24VECV00240
Farr v Younan
Tentative
ruling: Ex parte application to enter default against defendants: The court strikes
the CIV-141s filed by defendants on 4/26/2024 and 3/25/2024 as they were improperly
filed.  The court orders the default
clerk to process the requests for entry of default filed on 4/26/2024.
The court sets an OSC re sanctions on _____________ at 8:30 a.m. whether
Michael Shakouri and the Goodkin Law Group, APC, jointly and severally, should
pay the sum of $250 pursuant to CCP section 128.5 for improperly filing CIV-141
forms when the form is specifically for extending the time in which to file a
demurrer because of the inability to have a meet and confer.  The form is for no other purpose. The court
will determine whether the forms were filed in bad faith and whether by improperly
filing these forms, Mr. Shakouri has frivolously caused delay in the prosecution
of this case.  His declaration states
that he has NOT discussed the demurrer/motion to strike with plaintiff’s
counsel.
