(1) defendant weststar property
  MANAGEMENT, inc’s demurrer to second amended complaint 
(2) DEFENDANTS 5505 ackerfield apts, llc
  and weststar property MANAGEMENT, inc.’s motion to strike 
 
 



 
Background
            Plaintiffs
leased residential premises located at 5505 Ackerfield Ave., Long Beach, CA
90805 that were owned, managed and/or operated by Defendants.  Plaintiffs allege Defendants allowed multiple
dangerous conditions to exist at the property that rendered the premises uninhabitable
and dangerous to the Plaintiff’s health and safety.  Plaintiffs filed a formal complaint with the
City of Long Beach Department of Health. 
Plaintiffs allege Defendants also collected rent despite these
conditions and illegally served 3-Day Notices to Pay Rent or Quit in violation
of Civil Code §1942.2.  Plaintiffs also
allege Defendants failed to properly account for and return their security
deposits.  
            On December 27, 2022, Plaintiffs
filed this action against Defendants 5505 Ackerfield Apts LLC, AJJ2020 LLC,
Masuda Investments LLC and Weststar Property Management, Inc.  The operative complaint is the Second Amended
Complaint filed on December 22, 2023 alleging (1) breach of contract; (2)
breach of implied warranty of habitability; (3) nuisance; (4) IIED; (5)
negligence; and (6) violation of Civil Code §1942.4.
            On July 27, 2023, three other
residents of 5505 Ackerfield Apts LLC, Edana Jones, Tykisha Bain and Raydell
Latrent Patterson, filed a separate action, Edana Jones, et al. v. 5505
Ackerfield Apts LLC, et al., Case No. 23LBCV01405 alleging the same
habitability issues.  The complaint in
23LBCV01405 alleges (1) failure to provide habitable dwelling; (2) breach of
covenant and right to quiet enjoyment and possession of the property; (3)
nuisance; and (4) negligence.  
            On March 19, 2023, the Court ordered
consolidation of Edana Jones, et al. v. 5505 Ackerfield Apts LLC, et al., Case
No. 23LBCV01405 with the instant action, 22STCV40554.  Case No. 22STCV40554 is the lead action.            
Legal Standard
1.  Demurrer Standard
A
demurrer can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the
pleading under attack; or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially
noticeable. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal 3d 311, 318.) No other
extrinsic evidence can be considered (i.e., no “speaking demurrers”). (Ion
Equipment Corp. v. Nelson (1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 868, 881.)
A
demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action.
(Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal. App. 4th 740, 747.)  When considering demurrers, courts read the
allegations liberally and in context.  (Taylor
v. City of Los Angeles Dep’t of Water & Power (2006) 144 Cal. App. 4th
1216, 1228.)  In a demurrer proceeding,
the defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial
notice.  (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins.
Co. (2004) 116 Cal. App. 4th 968, 994.) 
“A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other
extrinsic matters.  Therefore, it lies
only where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially
noticed.”  (SKF Farms v. Superior Ct.
(1984) 153 Cal. App. 3d 902, 905.)  “The
only issue involved in a demurrer hearing is whether the complaint, as it
stands, unconnected with extraneous matters, states a cause of action.”  (Hahn, supra, 147 Cal.App.4th
at 747.)
2.  Motion to Strike Standard
Motions
to strike are used to reach defects or objections to pleadings that are not
challengeable by demurrer (i.e., words, phrases, prayer for damages,
etc.).  (CCP §§ 435-437.)  A party may file a motion to strike in whole
or in part within the time allowed to respond to a pleading, however, if a
party serves and files a motion to strike without demurring to the complaint,
the time to answer is extended.  (CCP §§
435(b)(1), 435(c).)
A
motion to strike lies only where the pleading has irrelevant, false, or
improper matter, or has not been drawn or filed in conformity with laws.  (CCP § 436.) 
The grounds for moving to strike must appear on the face of the
pleadings or by way of judicial notice. 
(CCP § 437.)
            In ruling on a motion to strike, the
allegations in the complaint are considered in context and presumed to be true:
“[J]udges read allegations of a pleading subject to a motion to strike as a
whole, all parts in their context, and assume their truth.”  (Clauson v. Sup.Ct. (Pedus Services, Inc.
(1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 1253, 1255.)
Discussion
Defendant Weststar
Property Management Inc.’s Demurrer
            Defendant
Weststar Property Management Inc. (“Weststar”) demurs to the first cause of
action for breach of contract, second cause of action for breach of the implied
warranty of habitability and sixth cause of action for Civil Code §1942.4.  Plaintiffs did not file an opposition to the
demurrer.
            1.  Defendant’s
RJN
            Defendant’s
RJN of the First and Second Amended Complaints filed by Plaintiffs in this
action is granted.  
2.  First and
Second Causes of action for Breach of Contract and Breach of Implied Warranty
of Habitability
            Weststar
demurs to the first cause of action for breach of contract and second cause of
action for breach of the implied warranty of habitability, because it is not in
privity of contract with Plaintiffs and it is not the landlord of the
property.  Weststar is not an alleged party
to the Lease Agreement.  (SAC, ¶50.)  Plaintiffs allege breach of a Lease Agreement
attached as Exhibit A to the SAC.  (Id.)  Plaintiffs failed to attach Exhibit A to the
SAC, but the Lease Agreement was also attached as Exhibit A to the FAC.  Based on Exhibit A to the FAC, the Court
finds that Weststar is not a party to the lease agreement. (FAC filed on May
11, 2023, Ex. A.)  The parties to the
lease agreement are Plaintiffs and Masuda Investments. (Id.)  Plaintiffs allege that the current and past owners
of the premises are Masuda Investments, AJJ202 LLC and 5505 Ackerfield Apts
LLC. (SAC, ¶¶35-37.)  
Plaintiffs also
admit that Weststar is merely the current property manager of the subject
property.  (SAC, ¶38.)  An agent is not generally liable on the
contract when he or she acts on behalf of a disclosed principal.  (Stoiber v. Honeychuck (1980) 101
Cal.App.3d 903, 929.)  Since the suit for
breach of the implied warranty is essentially a contractual one, Weststar as
the current property manager cannot be held liable for breach of the lease
agreement or the warranty of habitability implied into the lease agreement. (Id.
at 929.)
            Plaintiffs
did not oppose the motion.  Plaintiffs
therefore fail to establish that the defects raised by Weststar can be cured
with leave to amend.  (Hendy v. Losse
(1991) 54 Cal.3d 723, 742.)  
Weststar’s
demurrer to the first and second causes of action for breach of contract and
breach of the implied warranty of habitability is sustained without leave to
amend.  
3.  Sixth Cause of Action for Violation of
Civil Code §1942.4
Civil Code
§1942.4(a) states, “[a] landlord of a dwelling may not demand rent, collect
rent, issue a notice of a rent increase, or issue a three-day notice to pay
rent or quit pursuant to subdivision (2) of Section 1161 of the Code of Civil
Procedure, if all of the following conditions exist prior to the landlord’s
demand or notice….”  Civil Code
§1942.4(b) provides, “[a] landlord who violates this section is liable to the
tenant or lessee for the actual damages sustained by the tenant and lessee and
special damages of not less than one hundred dollars and nor more than five
thousand dollars…”
Weststar demurs
on grounds that it is only the alleged property manager, not the landlord of
the property.  Plaintiffs fail to allege
that Weststar is the landlord of the property and only allege that Weststar is
the property manager.  (SAC, ¶38.)  Based on the express language of Civil Code
§1942.4, only a landlord may be held liable thereunder.  Plaintiffs did not file an opposition arguing
that this defect is capable of cure.  
Defendant
Weststar’s Demurrer to the sixth cause of action for violation of Civil Code
§1942.4 is sustained without leave to amend.     
Defendants 5505 Ackerfield Apts LLC and Weststar’s
Motion to Strike 
            1.  Defendants’
RJN
Defendants’ RJN
of the First and Second Amended Complaints filed in this action is
granted.  
2.  Parties’ Positions
Defendants 5505
Ackerfield Apts LLC (“5505 Ackerfield”) and Weststar move to strike Plaintiffs’
punitive damages allegations and request for attorney’s fees.  Defendants argue the failure to remedy the
alleged conditions at the property was not oppressive, fraudulent or malicious
and at most amounts to negligence.  Defendants
argue the attorney’s fees request must be stricken as to Weststar in connection
with the first and sixth causes of action for breach of contract and violation
of Civil Code §1942.4.  
            In
opposition, Plaintiffs argue punitive damages are justified in this case. Plaintiffs
argue  Defendants had full subjective
knowledge of the dangerous conditions and failed to remedy them despite formal
complaints to authorities and citations issued by the City.  Plaintiffs argue the allegations are
sufficient to satisfy the “despicable conduct” prong of the definition of
malice under Civil Code §3294.  Plaintiffs
argue they are entitled to reasonable attorney’s fees if they prevail on their
breach of contract and CC §1942.4 claims. 

            In
reply, Defendants contend Plaintiffs’ allegations are conclusory and do not
establish malice.  Defendants argue more
than willful or conscious disregard of Plaintiffs’ interests is required.  Defendants do not respond to Plaintiffs’
arguments regarding reasonable attorney’s fees. 

            3.  Defendants’
Motion to Strike Punitive Damages 
            Defendants
AJJ2020 LLC and Masuda Investments LLC moved to strike punitive damages from
the First Amended Complaint, also arguing that malice, fraud or oppression were
not alleged based on the exact same allegations of wrongdoing.  Defendants 5505 Ackerfield and Weststar now
move to strike punitives from the Second Amended Complaint based on the same
argument—the factual allegations do not support a claim for punitives based on
malice, fraud or oppression.
            The
Court denies Defendants 5505 Ackerfield and Weststar’s Motion to Strike for the
same reasons stated in its October 3, 2023 order denying the Motion to Strike
of AJJ2020, LLC and Masuda Investments.  Plaintiffs
have more than satisfied the pleading threshold to allege punitives based on
malice.  “‘Malice’ means conduct which is
intended by the defendant to cause injury to the plaintiff or despicable
conduct which is carried on by the defendant with a willful and conscious
disregard of the rights or safety of others.” 
(CC §3294(c)(1).)  “‘Oppression’
means despicable conduct that subjects a person to cruel and unjust hardship in
conscious disregard of that person's rights.” 
(CC §3294(c)(2).)
            Plaintiffs
allege a litany of dangerous and hazardous conditions that existed at the
property, of which Defendants had full knowledge and for which the property had
been cited by the City of Long Beach. 
(SAC, ¶¶41-48.)  Despite
repeatedly complaining about the conditions and the health issues they were
causing Plaintiffs, Defendants did not remedy those conditions.  (Id.) 
As landlords, Defendants’ position gave them the power to damage
Plaintiff’s interests, as only Defendants could remediate the hazardous
condition issues.  (Stoiber v.
Honeychuck (1980) 101 Cal.App.3d 903, 925-926.)  A reasonable trier of fact could find that
clear and convincing evidence of these facts qualify as malice under Civil Code
§3294.  
            The
request to strike the request for attorney’s fees from the first and sixth
causes of action as to Weststar is moot in light of the Court’s ruling on
Weststar’s demurrer to these causes of action. 
Defendants do not challenge Plaintiffs’ right to request attorney’s fees
as to 5505 Ackerfield.
            Defendants’
Motion to Strike is therefore denied as to the punitive damages claim and moot
as to the attorney’s fees request against Weststar.  
Conclusion and ORDER
            Defendant Weststar’s Demurrer to the
first, second and sixth causes of action against it in the Second Amended
Complaint is SUSTAINED WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND. 

            Defendants 5505 Ackerfield and
Weststar’s Motion to Strike is DENIED as to Plaintiffs’ punitive damages
allegations and MOOT as to Plaintiffs’ request for attorney’s fees. 
            Moving Party to give notice.
