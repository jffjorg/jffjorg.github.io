 Case Number:  23STCV09694    Hearing Date:   April 30, 2024    Dept:  26 Myriam Jazmin Pulido Payan, et al. v. Sergio  Arturo Ruiz Nunez, et al.Case No. 23STCV09694PLAINTIFF'S REQUEST FOR ENTRY OF DEFAULT JUDGMENT IS DENIED.1.  No CIV-100  Form requesting court judgment has been filed.   As such, there is technically no request for default judgment before the  Court.  2.  Because  there is no CIV-100 Form filed, the Court cannot determine what damages  Plaintiffs seek.  Plaintiffs submit a  proposed judgment setting forth $411,300 in damages.  Plaintiffs CIV-100 Form requesting entry of  default submitted on 1/16/24 also inconsistently indicates $150,000 in general  damages and indicates a complaint demand of $74,800.   3.  The amount  requested on the proposed judgment ($411,300) far exceeds the amount plead in  the complaint ($74,800).  4.  If  Plaintiffs do intend to seek general damages, they must served and file a  Statement of Damages pursuant to CCP §425.11, which would reopen the default.  Plaintiffs would have to request entry of default against Defendant after the  time to respond to the newly served Statement of Damages and Complaint has  expired.   5.  Plaintiffs  fail to submit any admissible evidence in support of any damages.  Plaintiff Myriam Pulido Pavan’s declaration  does not provide any evidence of damages.   6.  Plaintiffs  failed to file a request for dismissal of DOEs.   This matter is continued to August 21, 2024, at 8:30 a.m.
