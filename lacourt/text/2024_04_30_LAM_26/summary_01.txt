And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has ruled on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by Defendant Weststar Property Management, Inc. and 5505 Ackerfield Apts LLC. With regard to the demurrer, the judge has sustained the demurrer without leave to amend, meaning that the plaintiffs failed to state a cause of action for breach of contract and implied warranty of habitability. The judge has also denied the motion to strike the punitive damages claim, finding that the plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged malice and oppression. The judge has also denied the motion to strike the request for attorney's fees.
