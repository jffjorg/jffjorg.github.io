And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

"The Court has denied the Plaintiffs' request for entry of default judgment. The reason for this denial is that there is no CIV-100 Form requesting court judgment that has been filed. Additionally, the Court cannot determine what damages the Plaintiffs seek. The Plaintiffs' proposed judgment exceeds the amount pleaded in the complaint, and they failed to submit admissible evidence in support of damages. The matter is continued to August 21, 2024."
