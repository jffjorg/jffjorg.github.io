[TENTATIVE] order RE:
defendant rsm properties inc.’s motion for attorney fees pursuant
  to code of civil procedure § 425.16 



 
Procedural
Background
On January 23,
2023, Plaintiffs Caroline S. Lee (“Caroline”) and Chung Soonkyo LLC (“CSL”)
(jointly, “Plaintiffs”) filed the instant collateral action against Defendants
Jong Han Lee (“Jong”), Bow Tie Realty and Investment, Inc. (“Bow Tie”), RSM
Properties, Inc. (“RSM”), Michael I. Kim (“Kim”), Unity Escrow, Inc. (“Unity”),
Ticor Title Company of California (“Ticor”), and Douglas Chadwick Biggins
(“Biggins”) (collectively, “Defendants”). 
The Complaint
asserts the following six causes of action: (1) Slander of Title against Jong
and Bow Tie; (2) Quiet Title against Jong, Bow Tie, RSM, Unity, Ticor, and
Biggins; (3) Breach of Contract against RSM, Unity, and Ticor; (4) Breach of
Fiduciary Duty against Unity; (5) Negligence against Unity and Ticor; and (6)
Extortion (Penal Code § 523) against RSM, Kim, Unity, and Ticor. 
On August 23,
2023, the Court granted RSM’s special motion to strike as to each cause of
action raised against it. (See August 22, 2023 Order.) 
On September 6,
2023, RSM filed the instant motion for attorneys’ fees and costs. As of April
25, 2024, no opposition has been filed.    
Legal
Standard
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure §
1033.5, subdivision (a)(10)(A), attorney fees when authorized by contract are
allowable as costs and may be awarded upon a noticed motion pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure § 1033.5, subdivision (c)(5). 

In determining what fees are reasonable,
California courts apply the “lodestar” approach. (See, e.g., Holguin v. DISH
Network LLC (2014) 229 Cal.App.4th 1310, 1332.)  This inquiry “begins with the ‘lodestar,’
i.e., the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable
hourly rate.” (See PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084,
1095.)  From there, the “[t]he lodestar
figure may then be adjusted, based on consideration of factors specific to the
case, in order to fix the fee at the fair market value for the legal services
provided.” (Ibid.)  Relevant factors
include: “(1) the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, (2) the
skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the extent to which the nature of the
litigation precluded other employment by the attorneys, [and] (4) the
contingent nature of the fee award.” (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th
1122, 1132.)
Discussion
A.   
Right to
Recover
Code of Civil Procedure § 425.16,
subdivision (c)(1), states that “a prevailing defendant on a special motion to
strike shall be entitled to recover his or her attorney’s fees and costs.” As
the prevailing moving party on a special motion to strike, RSM is entitled to
recover its attorney fees and costs reasonably incurred in connection with the
litigation of their anti-SLAPP motion.
B.   
Reasonableness of Attorney’s Fees
RSM initially moved for attorney fees and
costs in the amount of $30,682.70, which consisted of $21,750 for preparing its
anti-SLAPP motion, $1,372.70 in costs, and $7,560 for the instant fee motion.
(Notice of Motion at pg. 2.) Because no opposition has been filed, RSM has
reduced the total amount to $29,232.70. (Notice of Motion at pg. 2; Declaration
of Counsel re Non-Receipt of Opposition at ¶ 8.)
            The trial court has broad authority
to determine the amount of a reasonable fee. (PLCM Group, Inc. v. Drexler
(2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095.) The party bears the burden of proof as to
“reasonableness” of any fee claim. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (c)(5).)
The party seeking fees has the burden of documenting the appropriate hours
expended and hourly rates. (City of Colton v. Singletary (2012) 206
Cal.App.4th 751, 784.) This burden requires competent evidence as to the nature
and value of the services rendered. (Martino v. Denevi (1986) 182
Cal.App.3d 553, 559.)  
            An attorney's testimony as to the
number of hours worked is sufficient evidence to support an award of attorney
fees, even in the absence of detailed time records or billing statements, and
there is no requirement that such records or statements be offered in evidence.
(Steiny & Co., Inc. v. California Electric Supply Co. (2000) 79
Cal.App.4th 285, 293.)  Ascertaining the fee amount is left to the trial
court’s sound discretion. (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122,
1132.)  Moreover, “[t]here is ‘no mathematical rule requiring
proportionality between compensatory damages and attorney's fees awards’,
[Citation], and courts have awarded attorney's fees where plaintiffs recovered
only nominal or minimal damages.”  (Harman v. City and County of San
Francisco (2007) 158 Cal.App.4th 407, 421.)
            Here, Counsel Dilip Vithlani, the
attorney of record for RSM, attests that his hourly rate is $725 per hour and
that this rate is below the average charged by attorneys in the area with
comparable experience according to the Laffey Matrix for 2022. (Vithlani Decl.
¶ 28.) “The trial court [i]s entitled to rely on [an attorney’s own]
declaration[] to determine the reasonable rates for experienced attorneys in
Los Angeles County.” (Pasternack v. McCullough (2021) 65 Cal.App.5th
1050, 1059.) In light of Counsel Vithlani’s years of experience and level of
skill, Counsel Vithlani’s hourly rate is within the realm of reasonable hourly
rates in the area. (See Vithalni Decl. ¶ 21-27; Nishiki v. Dank Meredith,
APC (2018) 25 Cal.App.5th 883, 889 [“trial court has its own
expertise I the value of legal services performed in a case [Citation] and it
may rely on its own familiarity with the local legal market in setting the
hourly rate[.]”].)
            Additionally, Counsel Vithlani
claims 30 hours of work on the anti-SLAPP motion. (Motion at pg. 8; Vithlani
Decl. ¶ 20.) Though this is a significant amount of time spent, the Court
acknowledges that anti-SLAPP motions are complex motions that require skill,
time, and extensive research in an ever-evolving area of the law. As to the
instant motion, Counsel Vithlani states that 8 hours were expended in its preparation.
(Vithlani Decl. ¶¶ 29-30; Declaration of Counsel re Non-Receipt of Opposition
at ¶ 8.) The Court finds that these amounts are reasonable. It is further noted
that no opposition has been submitted to argue the contrary. Lastly, RSM’s
claimed costs of $1,372.70 have not been opposed and deemed reasonable.  
            Accordingly, based on the totality
of the circumstances, the Court finds that $29,232.70 represents the reasonable
attorney fees and costs incurred in conjunction with the anti-SLAPP motion and
with the filing of the instant motion. 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
Based on the foregoing, Defendant RSM Properties, Inc.’s motion for attorney
fees and costs is GRANTED in the amount of $29,232.70.
Moving party to give notice.
