```

And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling grants Defendant's motion to compel Intervenor Plaintiff Bristow's individual PAGA claims to arbitration and stay the prosecution of her representative PAGA claims pending the outcome in arbitration. The court finds that the parties concede the existence of an enforceable arbitration agreement and that Viking River Cruises, Inc. v. Moriana (2022) 142 S.Ct. 1906 requires the subdivision of PAGA claims into "individual" and "representative" components, with the individual components going to arbitration. The court notes that the California Supreme Court has advised that prosecution of the representative component can and should be stayed pending the arbitration on the individual component. Therefore, the court grants the motion and stays the prosecution of the Complaint-in-Intervention pending the outcome in arbitration. The court also sets a Status Conference for April 26, 2024, at 8:30 am, and requires counsel to meet and confer and file a Joint Status Report on or before April 19, 2024.
