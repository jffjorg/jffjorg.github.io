The tentative ruling grants Plaintiffs' motion for attorney's fees on appeal in the amount of $134,475.06, and takes the motion for attorney's fees on appeal from the fee award off-calendar pending reconsideration of the fee award. The ruling also reduces the amount of attorney's fees by $4,301.00 and $10,595.06 due to excessive time spent on certain tasks and a unique legal issue raised during the trial.
