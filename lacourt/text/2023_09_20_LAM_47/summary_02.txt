And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

Judge Theresa M. Traber issued a tentative ruling in the case of Nabil Mihoubi v. General Motors, LLC (Case Number: 22STCV33724). The case is a lemon law action filed on October 17, 2022, in which Plaintiff Nabil Mihoubi alleges that the 2022 Cadillac Escalade he purchased is defective. The Plaintiff moved for an order deeming the truth of the matters in requests for admissions propounded to Defendant General Motors, LLC. The Court granted the motion, finding that the Defendant failed to respond to the requests for admissions despite being properly served.

In addition, the Court granted the Plaintiff's request for sanctions against the Defendant and its counsel, jointly and severally, in the amount of $411.65. This amount represents the fees and costs actually incurred by the Plaintiff. The Court ordered the Defendant to pay the sanctions within 10 days of the order.

The Court's decision is based on California Code of Civil Procedure § 2033.280(b) and (c), which provide that when a party fails to respond to requests for admissions, the propounding party may move for an order deeming the truth of the matters specified in the requests admitted. The Court also cited California Code of Civil Procedure § 2023.010(d) and (a), which authorize the imposition of sanctions for failure to respond to discovery requests.
