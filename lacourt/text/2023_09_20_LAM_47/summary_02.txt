The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to deem the truth of matters in requests for admissions. The plaintiff served requests for admissions on the defendant, but the defendant failed to respond in a timely manner. As a result, the plaintiff is entitled to an order deeming the truth of the matters in the requests for admissions. The judge also granted the plaintiff's request for sanctions against the defendant and its counsel, jointly and severally, in the amount of $411.65. The sanctions are due within 10 days of the order.
