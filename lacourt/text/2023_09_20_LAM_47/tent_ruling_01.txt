HISTORY:

     Complaint filed.
12/16/21:
     First Amended Complaint filed.

 
STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            Plaintiff
alleges that the lawyer Defendants made misrepresentations to it so that it
would pay them $600,000 to provide services to another of their clients, Paul
Turley.
 
            Defendants
move for leave to file an overlength motion for terminating sanctions. 
 
TENTATIVE RULING: 
 
            Defendants move for leave to file an
overlength motion for terminating sanctions. 
 
            Ordinarily, the memorandum of points
and authorities for a motion may not exceed 20 pages for a motion for summary
judgment or summary adjudication, or 15 pages for any other type of motion.
(Cal. Rules of Court Rule 3.1113(d).) However, “[a] party may apply to the
court ex parte but with written notice of the application to the other parties,
at least 24 hours before the memorandum is due, for permission to file a longer
memorandum.” (Rule 3.1113(e).) The application must state reasons why the
argument cannot be made within the limit provided by the rules. (Id.) 
 
            Defendants seek leave to file a
motion for terminating sanctions that is 27 pages in length. According to
Defendants, the nature of the motion and the arguments advanced therein rely on
a significant portion of the factual record in this case, and the additional length
is necessary for a full recitation of the facts. The Court finds, given the
lack of any opposition by Plaintiff and the complex procedural and factual
history of this case, that there is good cause to permit Defendants to file an
overlength motion for terminating sanctions so that they may fully and
accurately state the factual basis for their motion. 
 
            Accordingly, Defendants’ Motion for
Leave to File Overlength Motion is GRANTED. 
 
            Defendants’ Motion for Terminating
Sanctions is deemed filed this date and set for hearing pursuant to the Court’s
September 15, 2023 Minute Order.
 
            The parties are ordered to adhere to
the briefing schedule on this motion ordered by the Court on September 15, 2023.
 
            Moving parties to give notice. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
