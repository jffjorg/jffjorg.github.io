And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling is to deny the motion to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff Neil Buenaventura. The motion was filed by Plaintiff's counsel, Sharona Eslamboly Hakim, stating that there has been an irreparable breakdown of attorney-client communications, making it impossible to continue representing the Plaintiff. However, the mandatory forms MC-052 and MC-053 were not filed and served prior to the hearing, as required by California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1362. As a result, the court cannot grant the motion at this time.
