And here is the English text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that Defendant Compass California, Inc. dba Compass' Motion to Strike is DENIED. The Plaintiffs have alleged sufficient facts to support a claim for punitive damages against Compass, including allegations that an officer, director, or managing agent of Compass was aware of the Improta's fraud and failed to take any action to stop it. The Judge finds that the allegations are more than conclusory and are sufficient to support a claim against Compass for punitive damages.
