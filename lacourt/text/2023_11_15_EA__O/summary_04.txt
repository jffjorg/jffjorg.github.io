The court grants the unopposed motion filed by Uber Technologies Inc. and Jiang Xu to seal their settlement agreement and joint motion for determination of good faith settlement. The court also grants the joint motion for determination of good faith settlement. The settlement agreement contains a confidentiality clause that restricts the disclosure of information, including the terms of the agreement, settlement amount, and parties. The purpose of the clause is to protect the vested interest of the settling parties in keeping their financial information private. The court finds that the settlement was made in good faith and grants the motion for determination of good faith settlement.
