And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted Defense Counsel's motion to be relieved as counsel for both the individual and corporate defendants. The motion was filed due to a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship, as the client has breached the client-fee agreement, is not following the attorneys' advice, and is not sufficiently responsive to counsel's attempts to communicate. The court has found that Defense Counsel has complied with all California Rules of Court Rule 3.1362 and has no substantive motions on calendar that would raise concerns of imminent prejudice. The motion is granted, effective upon serving the court's order relieving Counsel on the plaintiff, defendants, and all other parties who have appeared in the case.
