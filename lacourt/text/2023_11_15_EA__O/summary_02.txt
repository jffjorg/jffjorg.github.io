Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is reviewing a motion to strike certain allegations and paragraphs in a complaint related to the death of a child, Noah. The complaint alleges that the County and a mental health agency, Hathaway, failed to protect Noah and his siblings from abuse. The judge notes that the original complaint was focused on Noah's abuse, but the amended complaints involve more than just Noah's abuse. The judge also notes that the Structured Decision Making assessment indicated a high risk of danger to Noah, which further corroborates the abuse allegations.

The judge grants the motion as to the 2nd COA because the complaint did not allege facts sufficient to show a statutory mandatory duty to warn the County owed to Noah's great-grandmother, Eva. The judge also notes that the complaint implicitly alleges vicarious liability, but the lack of clarity between direct and vicarious liability ties into the County's motion to strike certain allegations.

The judge concludes that the 6AC identifies paragraphs 89-95 as facts related to the Minor Plaintiffs' Claims and will address the passages sought to be stricken as presented in the headers (Headers A through D). The judge also notes that the County's failure to protect Noah and his siblings is a critical issue in the case.

Overall, the judge's tentative ruling is aimed at clarifying the scope of the allegations and the County's potential liability for the death of Noah and the abuse of his siblings.
