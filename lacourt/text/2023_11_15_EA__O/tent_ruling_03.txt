On June 29, 2022, Defendants filed their answer alleging the
work was near completed but Plaintiff refused to pay the balance.
 
On April 11, 2023, Plaintiff filed the instant motion. That
same day, the court issued the following minute order: The Court notes a Motion
to Deem Request for Admissions Admitted has been reserved for 5/17/2023 at

Discussion
 
Counsel Horowitz seeks to be relieved as counsel for both
the individual and corporate Defendants as there has been a breakdown in the
attorney-client relationship. Specifically, Counsel explains that the client
has breached the client-fee agreement, is not following the attorneys’ advice,
and is not sufficiently responsive to counsel’s attempts to communicate. (See
generally MC-052 form.) 
 
As Defense Counsel has complied with all California Rules of
Court Rule 3.1362 (filed MC-051, 052, and 053 forms), has appropriately served
Plaintiff and Defendants, and there are no substantive motions on calendar that
would raise concerns of imminent prejudice, the court grants the motion. 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, Defense Counsel’s Motion to Be
Relieved as Counsel is GRANTED, effective upon serving this court’s order relieving Counsel sent to
Plaintiff, Defendants, and all other parties who have appeared in the case.
