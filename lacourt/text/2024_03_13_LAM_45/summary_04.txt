And here is a summary in English:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a lawsuit between DelMorgan Group, LLC and Globalist Capital, LLC (plaintiffs) and Australis Capital, Inc. (defendant). The plaintiffs filed a First Amended Complaint (FAC) alleging a single cause of action for breach of written contract. The defendant demurred to the FAC on the grounds of uncertainty and lack of facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The judge found that the FAC does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action and sustains the demurrer. However, the judge grants the plaintiffs 20 days leave to amend their complaint. The dispute centers on the termination of a Letter of Engagement (LOE) between the parties and the defendant's alleged breach of the LOE. The judge also noted that the plaintiffs failed to plead facts sufficient to support a claim for a "prior balance" of $1,386.55 owed to them.
