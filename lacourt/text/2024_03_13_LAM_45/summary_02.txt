And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel responses to his first set of special interrogatories. The plaintiff had served the interrogatories on April 1, 2022, and the deadline for response had expired. Despite sending a meet and confer letter and follow-up emails, the defendant failed to respond. The court finds that the plaintiff has demonstrated that the defendant failed to provide a timely response and therefore grants the motion. The court orders the defendant to serve verified responses, without objections, to the first set of special interrogatories within 30 days.

The court has also granted the plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions against the defendant. The plaintiff initially requested $4,110.00 in sanctions, but the court reduced the amount to $735. The court finds that the plaintiff incurred one hour of attorney time and $60 in filing fees, which are reasonable expenses. The court orders the defendant to pay $735 to the plaintiff within 30 days.
