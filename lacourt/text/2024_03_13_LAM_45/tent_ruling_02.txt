Motion to Compel Responses to Special Interrogatories (Set One) (CRS
9854)
The court considered the moving papers.  No opposition was received. 
The court GRANTS Plaintiff’s
motion to compel responses to Plaintiff’s first set of Special
Interrogatories.  The court orders
Defendant Kristina Rozina Bonhomme to serve verified responses, without
objections, to first set of Special Interrogatories, within 30 days of the date
of this ruling. 
The court GRANTS
Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions against Defendant Kristina Rozina Bonhomme in the
reduced amount of $735 in attorney’s fees and costs for the motion to compel
responses to Plaintiff’s first set of Special Interrogatories.  The court orders Defendant  to pay $735 to Plaintiff, through its counsel
of record, within 30 days of the date of this ruling. 
 
Background 
            Francisco Javier
Cervantes Manriquez (“Plaintiff”) filed this action on November 15, 2021,
against Great Western Remodeling Inc. and Kristina Rozina Bonhomme (collectively
“Defendants”) asserting fifteen causes of action arising from Plaintiff’s
employment with Defendants as a production assistant from August 16, 2021 to
September 29, 2021.  
            On September 20, 2023,
Plaintiff filed the instant motion to compel responses to Special
Interrogatories (Set One) and for sanctions. 
No opposition was received.  
Legal Standard 
If a party to whom
interrogatories were directed fails to serve a timely response, the propounding
party may move for an order compelling responses and for a monetary sanction.
(CCP § 2030.290(b)-(c); see Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific
Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 404.)  CCP § 2030.290 contains no time limit for a
motion to compel where no responses have been served.  All that needs to be shown in the moving
papers is that a set of interrogatories was properly served on the opposing
party, that the time to respond has expired, and that no response of any kind
has been served.  (Leach v. Superior
Court (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902, 905-906.) 
Discussion 
            Motion to Compel
Responses  
Plaintiff moves for an order
compelling Kristina Rozina Bonhomme (“Defendant”) to provide responses, without
objection, to Plaintiff’s first set of Special Interrogatories.  Plaintiff also moves for an order for
$4,110.00 in sanctions for reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs Plaintiff
incurred in connection with his motion. 
            The court finds that the
motion to compel responses to Plaintiff’s first set of Special Interrogatories
should be granted.  Plaintiff established
he propounded the subject discovery, along with other discovery, on April 1,
2022.[1]  (Declaration of Thomas H. Schelly, ¶ 4; Ex. “A.”) 
Defendant failed to respond by the May 30, 2022 deadline.  (Id. at ¶ 5.)  Plaintiff sent a meet and confer letter to
Defendant on September 29, 2022.  (Id.
at ¶ 6; Ex. “B.”)  Plaintiff sent follow
up emails from February 22, 2023 to May 1, 2023.  (Id.) 
Defendant never responded to Plaintiff’s meet and confer letter and
follow up emails.  (Id.)  
            Thus,
Plaintiff demonstrates Defendant provided no timely response to Plaintiff’s first set of Special Interrogatories. 
Defendant never responded despite Plaintiff sending a meet and confer
letter and follow up emails, which Plaintiff was not required to do.  Defendant does not oppose this motion, thus
failing to show why the court should not grant it. 
            Accordingly, the court
GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion to compel responses to Plaintiff’s first set of
Special Interrogatories.  The court
orders Defendant to serve verified responses, without objections, to first set
of Special Interrogatories, within 30 days of the date of this ruling. 
            Requests for Monetary
Sanctions 
            Plaintiff requests
$4,110.00 in monetary sanctions for (4 hours incurred and 2 hours anticipated
at the hourly rate of $675, plus $60 filing fee.)  (Id. at ¶ 10.)  The court
finds the number of hours requested should be reduced because the moving papers
are identical to those for Plaintiff’s other motions to compel.  Also, some hours do not apply because this
motion is unopposed.  The court finds one
hour for preparing the motion and attending the hearing, plus the $60 filing
fee are reasonable.  Thus, Plaintiff’s
total reduced recoverable amount in attorney’s fees and costs for this motion
is $735 (1 hour incurred at hourly rate of $675, plus $60 filing fee.) 
            Accordingly,
the court GRANTS Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions against Defendant
in the reduced amount of $735 in attorney’s fees and costs for the motion to
compel responses to Plaintiff’s first set of Special Interrogatories.  The court orders Defendant to pay $735 to
Plaintiff, through its counsel of record, within 30 days of the date of this
ruling. 
 
It is so ordered.
