And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to stay the proceedings in this childhood sexual abuse case. The defendant sought to stay the proceedings pending the outcome of two appeals regarding the constitutionality of California Assembly Bill 218, which removed the claims presentation requirement for claims against public entities in cases involving childhood sexual abuse that occurred before January 1, 2009. However, the judge has found that the appeals are moot because the Court of Appeal has already upheld the constitutionality of California Assembly Bill 218. The judge has also noted that even if the Second District of the Court of Appeal reaches a different conclusion in the other appeal, it remains within the court's discretion to follow either holding. Therefore, the motion to stay the proceedings is denied as moot.
