Summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the Defendant's Motion to Stay Proceedings in a childhood sexual abuse case. The Defendant sought to stay the proceedings pending the outcome of two appeals related to the constitutionality of California Assembly Bill 218 (AB 218). The Judge found that the appeals are unrelated to the case at hand and that the Court of Appeal's decision upholding the constitutionality of AB 218 makes it unnecessary to stay the proceedings. The Judge also noted that even if the Second District of the Court of Appeal reaches a different conclusion in one of the appeals, it remains within the Court's discretion to follow either holding.
