BACKGROUND
 
On November 13, 2023, Plaintiff initiated this action.
Subsequently, on January 12, 2024, Plaintiff filed her operative First Amended
Complaint (“FAC”) against Defendants Emily J. Simanian D.D.S. (“Simanian”) and
Emily J. Simanian D.D.S, Inc. d/b/a Golden Oak Dental Group Practice of Emil J
Simanian DDS Inc (“GODGP” or the “Moving Defendant”) (collectively
“Defendants”), and Does 1 to 25, alleging (1) Medical Malpractice, (2) General
Negligence, and (3) Negligence Hiring, Training, and Supervision. Subsequently,
Defendants filed their Answer to the Complaint on February 29, 2024. 
 
On May 23, 2024, GODGP filed the instant Motion to Deem
Admitted Request for Admissions, Set One (the “Motion”). Additionally, it
requests monetary sanctions against Plaintiff and her counsel.
No Opposition or Reply papers have been received by the
Court.  
 
ANALYSIS
 
“Any party may obtain discovery
. . . by a written request that any other party to the action admit the
genuineness of specified documents, or the truth of specified matters of fact,
opinion relating to fact, or application of law to fact. A request for
admission may relate to a matter that is in controversy between the parties.”¿
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.010.)¿ “Within 30 days after service of requests for
admission, the party to whom the requests are directed shall serve the original
of the response to them on the requesting party, and a copy of the response on
all other parties who have appeared ....”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.250, subd.
(a).)¿¿ 
 
If a party to whom request for
admissions is served fails to provide a timely response, the party to whom the
request was directed waives any objections, including based on privilege or the
work product doctrine. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (a).) The requesting
party can move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth
of any matters specified in the request be deemed admitted, as well as for
monetary sanctions. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).) The court shall
issue this order unless the party to whom the request was made serves a
response in substantial compliance prior to the hearing on the motion. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)¿¿ 
 
A.   
Motion to Deem
Admitted Request for Admissions, Set One
 
Moving Defendant’s counsel (“Counsel”) attests that on
February 29, 2024, it served Plaintiff with the first set of Request for Admissions,
to which responses were due on April 1, 2024. (Conley Decl., ¶ 3, Ex. “A.”)
Having not received any responses by the due date, Counsel sent Plaintiff’s
counsel a written meet and confer letter on April 30, 2024, demanding Plaintiff
to serve responses, without objection, by May 6, 2024. (Id. ¶ 4, Ex.
“B.”) Subsequently, on May 2, 2024, in response to Plaintiff’s request for an
extension of two weeks, Counsel agreed to grant a one-week extension. (Id.
¶ 6.) However, no responses had been received as of May 21, 2024. (Id. ¶
7.)   
 
Given the absence of any Opposition from Plaintiff and the
records above, the Court finds that Plaintiff has failed to serve a timely
response, thereby waiving any objection to the interrogatories, including those
based on privilege or the protection for work product, pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure section 2033.280, subdivision (a).
 
Consequently, the Court shall make this order, deeming the
genuineness of any documents and truth of any matters specified in the requests
to be admitted. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b) and (c).)
 
Therefore, the Court GRANTS the Motion.
 
B.    
Monetary
Sanctions
 
Pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280, subdivision (c), “It is mandatory that the court impose a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) on the party or
attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely response to requests for
admission necessitated this motion.”
 
Here, Plaintiff did not provide responses to the Request
for Admissions, Set One, nor file an Opposition to the Motion. Accordingly,
based on the above records and authorities, the Court finds that the mandatory
monetary sanctions are applicable. 
 
Utilizing
a lodestar approach, and in view of the totality of the circumstances,
the Court finds that the total and reasonable amount of attorney’s fees and
costs incurred for the work in preparing the Motion is $637.50, calculated at a
reasonable hourly rate of $425.00 for one and half hours reasonably spent. 
 
Therefore, the Court GRANTS IN PART the Moving Defendant’s request
for monetary sanctions.
 
CONCLUSION
 
Defendant Emil J. Simanian D.D.S., Inc. d/b/a Golden Oak
Dental Group Practice of Emil J Simanian DDS Inc’s Motion to Deem Admitted Request
for Admissions, Set One, is GRANTED. 
 
Defendant Emil J. Simanian D.D.S., Inc. d/b/a Golden Oak
Dental Group Practice of Emil J Simanian DDS Inc’s request for monetary sanctions
is GRANTED IN PART. 
 
Plaintiff Liliana Castillo Onofre and her attorney of
record are ordered to jointly and severally pay $637.50 to Defendant Emil J.
Simanian D.D.S., Inc. d/b/a Golden Oak Dental Group Practice of Emil J Simanian
DDS Inc’s counsel within 20 days.
