 Case Number:  22CHCV01086    Hearing Date:   August 19, 2024    Dept:  F49 MOTION TO STAY PROCEEDINGS  Los Angeles Superior  Court Case No. 22CHCV01086    Motion  filed: 6/26/24   MOVING PARTY: Defendant/Cross-Defendant William S.  Hart Union High School District  RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff Jane Doe M.K. NOTICE: OK.   RELIEF  REQUESTED: An  order granting William S. Hart Union High  School District’s Motion  to Stay Proceedings in this matter pending the decisions of two matters  currently before the Court of Appeals regarding the constitutionality of  California Assembly Bill 218 (“AB 218”).    RECOMMENDED  RULING: The motion  is DENIED.    BACKGROUND   This is a childhood sexual abuse case.    On November 7, 2022, Plaintiff Jane Doe M.K. (“Plaintiff”)  filed a Complaint against Defendants Doe 1, a public entity; Doe 2, an  individual employed by Doe 1, and Does 3 through 60. Subsequently, Plaintiff  filed amendments to the Complaint on April 7 and June 20, 20, 2023,  substituting Defendant/Cross-Defendant William S. Hart Union High School  District (“District” or “Defendant/Cross-Defendant”) for Doe 1 and Defendant  Martin John Spalding (“Spalding” or “Defendant/Cross-Complainant”) for Doe 2,  respectively. District and Spalding filed their respective Answers to the  Complaint on May 17, and July 26, 2023, respectively.   On July 26, 2023, Defendant/Cross-Complainant Spalding filed  a Cross-Complaint against Defendant/Cross-Defendant District, and Roes 1 to  100, alleging the following causes of action: (1) Implied Equitable Indemnity,  (2) Total Equitable Indemnity, (3) Apportionment; Contribution and Partial  Indemnity, (4) Declaratory Relief, and (5) Apportionment of Fault. District  filed its Answer to the Cross-Complaint on August 25, 2023.    On June 26, 2024, District filed the instant Motion to Stay  Proceedings. Subsequently, Plaintiff filed her Opposition on August 6, 2024,  and District replied on August 12, 2024.   ANALYSIS   The court has the inherent authority to “amend and control  its process and orders so as to make them conform to law and justice.” (Code  Civ. Proc., § 128, subd. (a)(8).)               Courts “have an inherent obligation  to decide cases properly brought before them[.]” (Top Ins. Co. v. Fireman’s  Fund Ins. Companies (1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 1331, 1345.) “Trial courts  generally have the inherent power to stay proceedings in the interests of  justice and to promote judicial efficiency.” (Freiberg v. City of Mission  Viejo (1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 1484, 1489.) They may also exercise their  inherent power to “prevent wrongful use of process….” (Western Steel &  Ship Repair, Inc. v. RMI, Inc. (1986) 176 Cal.App.3d 1108, 1116.)   A. Request for Judicial Notice               The Court GRANTS  District’s Requests for Judicial Notice (“RJN”). The Court also GRANTS  Plaintiff’s RJN. (Evid.  Code § 452, subds. (c), (d), (h); People v. Morales (2018) 25  Cal.App.5th 502, 511 fn. 7 [courts may take judicial notice of information  published on official government websites].) However, the Court  takes judicial notice only as to “the existence, content and authenticity of  public records and other specified documents”; it does not take judicial notice  of the truth of the factual matters asserted in those documents. (Dominguez v. Bonta (2022) 87 Cal. App. 5th 389, 400.)   B. Motion to Stay Proceedings   Courts  may postpone cases when, “it would not only be the right of the judge to do so,  but it would be his duty, in the interest of justice, and to promote the  substantial rights of the parties[.]”( Smith v. Jones (1900) 128 Cal.  14, 15.)   Here, District seeks to stay this action pending the appeals  of two unrelated cases, namely West Contra Costa U.S.D. v. Superior Court  (First Appellate District, Case No. A16934) and Roe #2 v. Superior Court  (Second Appellate District, Div. 6, Case No. B334707).   District notes that the issue on appeal in both of these  cases is the constitutionality of AB 218, which removed the claims presentation  requirement for claims against public entities in cases involving childhood  sexual abuse that occurred before January 1, 2009. District contends that this  case should be stayed pending the outcome of those appeals because AB 218 is at  the heart of Plaintiff’s case against Defendant, and if it is found  unconstitutional, Plaintiff’s case ends.    District further cites the case of Farmland Irrigation  Co. v. Dopplmaier (1957) 48 Cal.2d 208 (Farmland Irrigation) as the  criteria for determining whether to stay this action.    The Court finds the factors set forth in  Farmland Irrigation do not apply to this case. The Farmland  Irrigation court stated, “When an action is brought in a court of this  state involving the same parties and the same subject matter as an action  already pending in a court of another jurisdiction, a stay of the  California proceedings is not a matter of right, but within the sound  discretion of the trial court....” (Farmland Irrigation Co. v. Dopplmaier,  supra, 48 Cal.2d at p. 215.) (Underlines added.) Here, this action does not  involve the same parties or facts as West Contra Costa and Roe #2 v.  Superior Court, nor is the Court of Appeal a court of a different  jurisdiction or state. Therefore, the Court determines the applicable factors  for consideration here are those set forth in Smith v. Jones, supra.   In Opposition,  Plaintiff contends the Motion is moot because the Court of Appeal issued its  decision in West Contra Costa on July 31, 2024, which upholds the  constitutionality of AB 218.    The  Court finds Plaintiff’s contention compelling. Since the Court of Appeal has  upheld the constitutionality of AB 218, Plaintiff’s claim may proceed against District.  The Court therefore does not find that a stay would be in the interest of  justice or promote the substantial rights of the parties. (Smith v. Jones,  supra, 128 Cal. at p. 15.)   The  Court further notes that even if the Second District of the Court of Appeal  ultimately reaches a different conclusion in Roe #2 v. Superior Court,  it remains within the Court’s discretion to follow either holding. (Auto  Equity Sales, Inc. v. Superior Court of Santa Clara County (1962) 57  Cal.2d 450, 456; see also Fudge v. City of Laguna Beach (2019) 32 Cal.App.5th 193, 199 [no horizontal stare  decisis in California].) Consequently, the pending decision in Roe #2 v.  Superior Court does not, by itself, provide a basis to stay this case.   Based  on the foregoing, the Court DENIES the Motion to Stay Proceedings.   CONCLUSION    Defendant/Cross-Defendant  William S. Hart Union High School District’s Motion  to Stay Proceeding is DENIED as moot.   Moving  party is ordered to give notice.
