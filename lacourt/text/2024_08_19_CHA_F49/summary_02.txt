As for the summary of the judge's tentative ruling, here is a brief summary:

The Judge has denied the Defendant/Cross-Defendant's Motion to Stay Proceedings, citing that the issue on appeal in the related cases is the constitutionality of California Assembly Bill 218, which has already been upheld by the Court of Appeal. The Judge finds that a stay would not be in the interest of justice or promote the substantial rights of the parties, and that the pending decision in Roe #2 v. Superior Court does not provide a basis to stay the case.
