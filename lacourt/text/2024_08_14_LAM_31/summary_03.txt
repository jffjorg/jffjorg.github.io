The court granted the motion to compel further responses to discovery in part, ordering defendant to provide further responses and documents to requests Nos. 16-19 within 45 days. The court denied the motion to compel a further response to requests Nos. 20-21, finding that the terms "fixes" and "failure rates" were vague and overbroad. The parties had previously met and conferred about possible control search terms for GM's internal communications, but were unable to come to an agreement.
