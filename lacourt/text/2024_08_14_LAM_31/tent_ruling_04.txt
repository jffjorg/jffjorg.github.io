[1] Granted by the court on January
12, 2024.


[2] Defendant filed an opposition to
Plaintiff’s original motion on February 28, 2024.  Plaintiff merely points out Defendant’s
failure to file a supplemental opposition.  Accordingly, Plaintiff’s request to preclude
Defendant from providing oral argument at the hearing is DENIED.  


[3] Given that the parties agreed to
adopt the court’s tentative re: Request nos. 20 and 21, the court adds the
limitation to Request Nos. 16, 17, 18, and 19 only.
