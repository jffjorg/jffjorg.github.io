MOTION
TO COMPEL PLAINTIFF RANDI WINTER TO PROVIDE VERIFIED RESPONSES TO DEFENDANT’S
SPECIAL INTERROGATORIES, SET TWO, AND REQUEST FOR MONETARY SANCTIONS



 
MOVING PARTY:               Defendant
El Camino Community College District
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     Plaintiff Randi
Winter
 
 
I.          INTRODUCTION
 
            On April 4, 2024, Defendant, El Camino Community College
District, filed this Motion to Compel Plaintiff Randi Winter to Provide
verified responses to Defendant’s Special Interrogatories, Set Two, without
objections.  Defendant also seeks
monetary sanctions against Plaintiff and his attorney.  
 
            Plaintiff
filed an opposition.  Defendant replied.
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARD
 
            If
a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely response,
the propounding party may move for an order to compel responses without
objections.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (b).)¿ A party moving to
compel discovery responses under this statutory provision is not required to
meet and confer prior to filing the motion.¿ (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290,
subd. (b); see also Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific
Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411 (Sinaiko)
(citing Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902, 906 for the
proposition that “meet and confer” requirement “did not apply when propounding
party sought order compelling responses to interrogatories and sanctions for
responding party's failure to respond ‘within the statutorily permitted
time’”).)¿¿¿ 
 
Monetary Sanctions¿¿¿¿¿ 
¿
¿Code of Civil Procedure section
2023.030 is a general statute authorizing the Court to impose discovery
sanctions for “misuse of the discovery process,” which includes (without
limitation) a variety of conduct such as: making, without substantial justification,
an unmeritorious objection to discovery; making an evasive response to
discovery; and unsuccessfully and without substantial justification making or
opposing a motion to compel or limit discovery.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §
2023.010.)¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
 
If sanctions are sought, Code of
Civil Procedure section 2023.040 requires that the notice specify the identity
of the person against whom sanctions are sought and the type of sanction
requested, that the motion be supported in the points and authorities, and the
facts be set forth in a declaration supporting the amount of any monetary
sanction.¿¿¿¿¿ 
¿
¿If the court finds that a party
has unsuccessfully made or opposed a motion to compel responses to
interrogatories or inspection demands, the court “shall impose a monetary
sanction . . . unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (c), 2031.310,
subd. (h).)¿¿¿¿  
 
Sanctions against counsel:¿ The court in Kwan
Software Engineering, Inc. v. Hennings (2020) 58 Cal.App.5th 57, 81 (Hennings)
noted that discovery sanctions against an attorney are governed by a different
standard than sanctions against a party:¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿¿¿ 
By the terms of the statute, a trial court under section
2023.030(a) may not impose monetary sanctions against a party’s attorney unless
the court finds that the attorney “advised” the party to engage in the conduct
resulting in sanctions. (§ 2023.030(a); Ghanooni v. Super Shuttle (1993)
20 Cal.App.4th 256, 261, 24 Cal.Rptr.2d 501.)¿ “Unlike monetary sanctions
against a party, which are based on the party's misuse of the discovery
process, monetary sanctions against the party's attorney require a finding the
‘attorney advis[ed] that conduct.’ ” (Ibid.) “It is not enough that the
attorney's actions were in some way improper.” (Corns v. Miller (1986)
181 Cal.App.3d 195, 200, 226 Cal.Rptr. 247 (Corns).) Because an
attorney's advice to a client is “peculiarly within [his or her] knowledge,”
the attorney has the burden of showing that he or she did not counsel discovery
abuse. (Ibid.) Accordingly, when a party seeking sanctions against an
attorney offers sufficient evidence of a misuse of the discovery process, the
burden shifts to the attorney to demonstrate that he or she did not recommend
that conduct. (Id. at pp. 200–201, 226 Cal.Rptr. 247; Ghanooni,
at p. 262, 24 Cal.Rptr.2d 501.)¿¿
 
III.       DISCUSSION
 
            It is
undisputed that Defendant properly served Plaintiff with the at-issue
interrogatories on December 1, 2023 by electronic service.  It is further undisputed that Plaintiff did
not provide timely responses.  (Pitts
Decl., ¶¶ 3-9.)  Rather, despite
objections having been waived, Plaintiff served objection-only responses on May
28, 2024.  (See Wise Decl., Ex. B.)  For this reason, Defendant seeks an order
compelling Plaintiff to provide verified, objection-free responses.
 
            In
opposition, Plaintiff argues the motion should be denied because (1) Counsel
for Plaintiff misplaced the interrogatories and requested Defense Counsel to
furnish a copy of the same; Defense Counsel refused; (2) Counsel for Plaintiff was
overextended with matters in other cases; (3) Counsel for Plaintiff was not
able to provide timely responses because her laptop was being repaired; and (4)
Defendant did not engage in an Informal Discovery Conference (IDC) in lieu of
filing this motion.  
 
Each of the foregoing grounds lacks merit.  On January 10, 2024—after the deadline to
provide responses had passed—Counsel for Plaintiff requested a copy of the
interrogatories from Defense Counsel. 
Plaintiff’s Counsel did not provide any reason for not providing
discovery responses.  Counsel did not
explain that she was engaged in other matters, that she had misplaced the
interrogatories, or that her laptop was being repaired. (See Wise Decl., Ex. A,
1/10/24 Email.)  Rather, the
correspondence makes clear that Counsel for Plaintiff was aware of the
discovery requests and failed to provide a timely response.  Given that Plaintiff did not timely respond,
and served unverified, objection-only responses despite waiving objections,
Plaintiff effectively did not serve responses at all.  “Unsworn responses are tantamount to no
responses at all.”¿ (Appleton v. Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d
632, 636.)¿ Therefore, Defendant was not required to engage in an IDC in lieu
of filing of this motion.  Defendant is
entitled to an order compelling Plaintiff to provide verified, objection-free
responses.
 
            Monetary
Sanctions
 
            Defendant
requests sanctions against Plaintiff and his counsel of record.  Given the Court’s ruling, sanctions are
warranted against Plaintiff’s Counsel only. 
Pursuant to Hennings, supra, imposition of monetary
sanctions against counsel is proper unless counsel shows that he or she did not
counsel the discovery abuse.¿ (Hennings, 58 Cal.App.5th at p. 81.)¿ Plaintiff’s
Counsel does not meet her burden.  Accordingly,
sanctions are imposed against Plaintiff’s Counsel only in the sum of $610,
representing two hours at Defense Counsel’s hourly rate.
 
IV.       CONCLUSION
 
            The Motion to
Compel is GRANTED.  Plaintiff is ordered
to provide verified, objection-free responses within 30 days of this order.
 
            The request
for sanctions is GRANTED.  Plaintiff’s
Counsel is ordered to pay sanctions in the sum of $610 to Defendant, by and
through its counsel, within 30 days of this order.
 
Moving party to give notice.
