MOTION
TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TO DISCOVERY 



 
MOVING PARTY:               Plaintiff
William Robert Fonseca 
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     Defendant General
Motors, LLC
 
 
I.          INTRODUCTION

 
This is a Song-Beverly action.  On January 18, 2024, Plaintiff, William
Robert Fonseca, filed this motion to compel Defendant, General Motors, LLC, to
provide further responses to Plaintiff’s Request for Production of Documents,
Set One, Nos. 16-21.  Plaintiff does not
seek sanctions.  There is a stipulated
protective order in place.[1]
 
The motion, which was fully briefed, came on for hearing on
March 12, 2024.  Because the parties had
not participated in an Informal Discovery Conference (IDC) prior to the hearing,
the court continued the motion to allow the parties to participate in an IDC.  The parties appeared for an IDC on May 1,
2024.  The issues were not resolved.  Counsel was directed to meet and confer and
to file a Notice of Outcome within five court days after the meet and confer
date.  The court also set a briefing
schedule for the filing of supplemental papers. 
 
On May 6, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Notice of Outcome.  As relevant here, the Notice indicates that
the parties discussed Defendant’s concerns with the scope of Plaintiff’s defect
definition, the ESI discovery sought, and Plaintiff’s request for internal
communications such as emails.  Further, the
parties agreed to meet and confer to discuss Plaintiff’s proposals regarding
the foregoing topics; Defendant, in turn, was to inform Plaintiff if Defendant
agreed to produce subject to the conditions discussed during the meet and
confer process.  
            
On July 2, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel filed a supplemental
declaration stating, in part, that the parties were unable to agree to a
satisfactory written discovery search.  As
such, Plaintiff is proceeding with his motion.
 
On July 17, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Notice of
Non-Opposition.  Plaintiff requests that
the court not allow Defendant another opportunity to file an opposition and
preclude Defendant from offering oral argument at the hearing.[2]
 
The motion came on for hearing on July 24, 2024.  The court issued a tentative ruling granting
the motion in part.  After hearing oral
argument, the court did not adopt the tentative ruling and directed the parties
to meet and confer and to file a joint supplemental declaration.  Pursuant to oral stipulation, the hearing for
the motion was continued to August 14, 2024. 

 
On August 8, 2024, the parties timely filed a joint
supplemental declaration.  The parties did
not resolve the dispute.  Accordingly,
the court adopts its previously issued tentative ruling as the final order of
the court.
 
II.        LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
Under Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.310, parties may
move for a further response to requests for production of documents¿where an
answer to the request is evasive or incomplete or where an objection is without
merit or too general.¿ The motion “shall set forth specific facts showing good
cause justifying the discovery sought by the inspection demand.”¿ (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (b)(1).)¿¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿¿ 
Notice of the motion must be given within 45 days of service
of the verified response, otherwise, the propounding party waives any right to
compel a further response.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (c).)¿ The
motion must also be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration.¿ (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (b)(2).)¿¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿¿ 
Finally, California Rules of Court, rule 3.1345 requires
that all motions or responses involving further discovery contain a separate
statement with the text of each request, the response, and a statement of
factual and legal reasons for compelling further responses.¿ (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1345(a)(3).)¿¿¿¿ 
 
III.       DISCUSSION
 
In his motion, Plaintiff states:  “This action alleges
that Defendant GENERAL MOTORS LLC (“Defendant” or “GM”) violated California’s
Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act (“Song-Beverly Act” or “Lemon Law”) by
failing to repair Plaintiff’s 2020 Silverado 1500 Vehicle and its various
defects—including the POWETRAIN DEFECT—within a reasonable number of attempts,
and by failing to repurchase the vehicle despite its knowledge that Plaintiff’s
vehicle suffers from those defects. [¶] Accordingly, Plaintiff propounded
Request for Production of Documents, Set One Nos. 16-21 (collectively, the
“Requests”), which seek documents relating to GM’s internal investigation and
analysis of the Defects plaguing Plaintiff’s vehicle and establishing that
Defendant previously knew of such Defects but nevertheless failed to repurchase
the vehicle (i.e., Nos. 16-21).” (Mot., p. 1:3-13.)  
 
Plaintiff now seeks a further response to Request for
Production, Nos. 16-21.  The parties have the Court’s Addendum to Case
Management Conference Order re: Song-Beverly Discovery (“Addendum”).  The
Court addresses each production request with the Addendum in mind. 
 
NO. 16: All
DOCUMENTS, including but not limited to electronically stored information and
electronic mails, concerning any internal analysis or investigation by YOU or
on YOUR behalf regarding POWERTRAIN DEFECT in vehicles of the same year, make,
and model as the SUBJECT VEHICLE. [This request shall be interpreted to
include, but not be limited to, any such investigation to determine the root
cause of such POWERTRAIN DEFECT, any such investigation to design a permanent
repair procedure for such POWERTRAIN DEFECT, any such investigation into the
failure rates of parts associated with such POWERTRAIN DEFECT, any cost
analysis for implementing any proposed repair procedures, any savings analysis
not implementing a proposed repair procedures, etc.]. 
 
GM’s Response: 
GM objects to this Request on grounds the terms “concerning,” “internal
analysis,” “investigation,” and “POWERTRAIN DEFECT” are vague and ambiguous. GM
also objects to this Request on grounds it improperly assumes that there are
alleged defects with respect to the SUBJECT VEHICLE, or GM VEHICLES, generally.
GM also objects to this Request on the grounds it is overbroad and seeks
documents that are irrelevant and not reasonably calculated to lead to the
discovery of admissible evidence as it is not limited to the SUBJECT VEHICLE at
issue in this action. GM also objects to this Request on grounds it is
burdensome and oppressive, and that compliance would be unreasonably difficult
and expensive considering the needs of the case, the amount in controversy, and
the importance of the issues at stake in the litigation. This is a simple,
individual lemon law case with limited issues and this request violates Calcor
Space Facility, Inc. v. Superior Court (1997)53 Cal.App.4th 216, 61
Cal.Rptr.2d 567. Specifically, whether Plaintiffs are entitled to relief under
the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act is entirely unrelated and incommensurate
to the scope and breadth of this Request. GM also objects to this Request to
the extent it seeks confidential, proprietary and trade secret information. GM
further objects to this Request to the extent it seeks information protected by
the attorney-client privilege and/or work-product doctrine. No documents will
be produced. 
 
Ruling: GRANTED in
part.¿ With respect to electronically stored information, the motion to compel
is Granted.¿ 
 
The court previously issued a tentative ruling to deny this
request and Request Nos. 17, 18, and 19 as to email communication. The court
found that these requests were overbroad and that¿Plaintiff did not identify
the control source or search terms that might provide responsive documents.
 
As detailed in the joint supplemental declaration, the
parties met and conferred about possible control search terms for GM’s internal
communications.  Plaintiff proposed 15
search terms.  (Notice of Outcome, pp.
2-3).  They include: 
 
·        
malfunction of EGR differential
pressure sensor connector;
·        
engine control module circuit losing
continuity;
·        
reductant control module software; 
·        
transmission pump seizure; 
·        
torque converter not spinning; 
·        
defective pump intermediate gear
bearing; 
·        
transmission case cover assembly
failure; 
·        
DTC P2382; 
·        
DTC P208B; 
·        
TSB #21-NA-125; 
·        
TSB #20-NA-039; 
·        
TSB #21-NA-007; 
·        
TSB#PIP5640A; 
·        
TSB #22-NA-181; 
·        
TSB #PIP5718A.
 
Defendant proposed the following language: “Documents that
GM relied upon in generating applicable TSBs and recalls, to be identified by
Plaintiff as applicable.”  (Id.,
p. 4.)  The parties could not come to
an agreement.  Plaintiff now requests
that the court include the following provision: production of responsive
internal communications, limited to the lead product engineer of the 2020 Chevy
Silverado to the proposed terms listed above. 
(Id., p. 3.)   
 
The court finds that Defendant’s proposed search term is
more reasonable, but still unduly vague.  

 
Accordingly, with respect to email communications, the
motion to compel is Granted with the following limitation:  Defendant shall produce email communications
from the lead project engineer for the 2020 Chevy Silverado that were purchased
or leased in California that discuss TSB #21-NA-125;TSB #20-NA-039; TSB
#21-NA-007; TSB#PIP5640A; TSB #22-NA-181 and email communications from the lead
project engineer for the 2020 Chevy Silverado that were purchased or leased in
California that discuss recall notices related to the 2020 Chevy Silverado that
were purchased or lease in California.[3]

 
NO. 17: All
DOCUMENTS, including but not limited to electronically stored information and
electronic mails, concerning or relating to any communications YOU have had
regarding POWERTRAIN DEFECT in vehicles of the same year, make, and model as
the SUBJECT VEHICLE. 
 
GM’s Response: 
GM objects to this Request on grounds the terms “concerning or relating to,”
“communications,” and “POWERTRAIN DEFECT” are vague and ambiguous. GM also
objects to this Request on the grounds it improperly assumes that there are
alleged defects with respect to the SUBJECT VEHICLE, or GM VEHICLES, generally.
GM also objects to this Request on grounds it is overbroad and seeks documents
that are irrelevant and not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of

oppressive, and that compliance would be unreasonably difficult and expensive

Space Facility, Inc. v. Superior Court (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 216, 61
Cal.Rptr.2d 567. Specifically, whether Plaintiff is entitled to relief under
the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act is entirely unrelated and incommensurate
to the scope and breadth of this Request. GM also objects to this Request to
the extent it seeks confidential, proprietary and trade secret information. GM
further objects to this Request to the extent it seeks information protected by
the attorney-client privilege and/or work-product doctrine. No documents will
be produced.

#22-NA-181 and email communications from the lead project engineer for the 2020
Chevy Silverado that were purchased or leased in California that discuss recall
notices related to the 2020 Chevy Silverado that were purchased or lease in
California.
 
NO. 18: All
DOCUMENTS, including but not limited to electronically stored information and
electronic mails, concerning or relating to any decision to issue any notices,
letters, campaigns, warranty extensions, technical service bulletins and
recalls concerning the POWERTRAIN DEFECT in vehicles of the same year, make,
and model as the SUBJECT VEHICLE.  
 
GM’s Response:
GM objects to this Request on grounds the terms “concerning or relating to,”
“issue,” and “POWERTRAIN DEFECT” are vague and ambiguous. GM also objects to
this Request on grounds it improperly assumes that there are alleged defects
with respect to the SUBJECT VEHICLE, or GM VEHICLES, generally. GM also objects

Subject to and without waiving these objections, GM will
comply in part and produce the following documents in its possession, custody
and control and a list of TSBs and ISBs for vehicles of the same year, make,
and model as the SUBJECT VEHICLE. After it has produced the lists of TSBs and
ISBs, GM will – at Plaintiff’s request – search for and produce, if located,
copies of a reasonable number of TSBs and ISBs, if any, that Plaintiff has
identified as relevant to the conditions alleged in Plaintiff’s complaint.
