Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has reconsidered the stay of the case and has decided to maintain it pending the appeal of the motion to disqualify counsel. The judge finds that the motion was not insubstantial or frivolous and that the case should be stayed to avoid undue prejudice to the parties. The judge also notes that the parties did not brief the issue of the stay before the case management conference and that the court needs to exercise its discretion to stay the proceedings. The motion for reconsideration is denied, and the case will remain stayed.
