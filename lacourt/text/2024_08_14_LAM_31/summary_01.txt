Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to compel the plaintiff to provide verified responses to the defendant's special interrogatories, set two. The plaintiff failed to provide timely responses and instead served objection-only responses. The judge found that the plaintiff's counsel did not meet their burden to show that they did not counsel the discovery abuse and therefore sanctions are imposed against plaintiff's counsel in the sum of $610.

The judge ordered the plaintiff to provide verified, objection-free responses within 30 days of the order. The judge also granted the defendant's request for sanctions and ordered plaintiff's counsel to pay sanctions in the sum of $610 to the defendant within 30 days of the order.

The judge's ruling is based on the California Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.290, 2023.030, and 2023.040, which govern discovery and sanctions. The judge's decision is supported by case law, including Appleton v. Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 632, 636, and Kwan Software Engineering, Inc. v. Hennings (2020) 58 Cal.App.5th 57, 81.
