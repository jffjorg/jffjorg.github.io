MOTION
FOR TERMINATING, ISSUE, EVIDENCE AND/OR MONETARY SANCTIONS AGAINST DEFENDANT
AND DEFENDANT’S COUNSEL



 
MOVING PARTY:               Plaintiffs/Cross-Defendants
Richard Sweet, et al.
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     No opposition
 
 
I.          BACKGROUND 
 
This is a breach of contract and negligent construction
action concerning the property at 4374 Chevy Chase Dr., La Canada (the
“Property”).  Plaintiffs Richard and Lori
Sweet are the owners of the Property.  In
July 2022, Plaintiffs executed an agreement with Defendant ArchiBuildz, LLC to serve
as the general contractor for a remodel of the Property.  On June 1 2023, Plaintiffs filed a Complaint
against Defendant, alleging that Defendant breached the contract by failing to
make timely payments to subcontractors and modifying or altering the scope of
the work, among other breaches. 
Plaintiffs also allege various ways in which Defendant negligently
completed the work.  Thereafter,
Defendant filed a Cross-Complaint against Richard Sweet, Lori Sweet,
individually and as Co-Trustees of the Sweet Living Trust for breach of
contract and foreclosure of a mechanic’s lien.
 
On January 8, 2024, Richard Sweet, Lori Sweet, individually
and as Co-Trustees of the Sweet Living Trust (collectively, “Plaintiffs”),
filed a motion to compel Defendant to provide responses to Plaintiffs’ Requests
for Production of Documents, Set One.  Plaintiffs sought sanctions against
Defendant. 
 
On April 4, 2024, the court granted Plaintiffs’ unopposed
motion to compel.  Pursuant to the court’s
order, Defendant was to provide verified, objection-free responses and to pay
sanctions within 30 days of the court’s order.  Defendant did not comply with the court’s
order.
 
On May 15, 2024, Plaintiffs filed this Motion for
Terminating, Issue, Evidence And/Or Monetary Sanctions in the Amount of
$4,500.00 Against Defendant and Defendant’s Counsel (“Motion for Sanctions”).
 
The Motion for Sanctions is unopposed.
 
At the hearing on August 2, 2024, defense counsel requested
additional time to respond.  The court
granted the request and continued the matter to August 14, 2024.  The court indicated that if defense counsel
produced the documents within a week, the court would take that into
consideration.  The parties were ordered
to meet and confer no later than August 5, 2024.  Defense counsel was ordered to produce documents
and file an opposition no later than August 9, 2024.  Plaintiff’s counsel filed a declaration on August
12, 2024, indicating that defense counsel failed to produce the requested
documents and failed to meet and confer.  
 
Because defense counsel failed to produce the documents, failed
to meet and confer with plaintiff’s counsel, and failed to file an opposition, the
court adopts its prior tentative as discussed below.  
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARD
 
            Code of
Civil Procedure § 2023.030 gives the court the discretion to impose sanctions
against anyone engaging in a misuse of the discovery process.¿ Misuse of the
discovery process includes failure to respond to an authorized method of
discovery or disobeying a court order to provide discovery.¿ (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2023.010, subds. (d), (g).)¿ A court may impose terminating sanctions by
striking pleadings of the party engaged in misuse of discovery or entering
default judgment.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (d).)¿ A violation of a
discovery order is sufficient for the imposition of terminating sanctions.¿ (Collison
& Kaplan v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1620.)¿ Terminating
sanctions are appropriate when a party persists in disobeying the court’s
orders.¿ (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771, 795-796 (Deyo).)¿¿¿¿ 
 
            The court
should consider the totality of the circumstances, including conduct of the
party to determine if the actions were willful, the detriment to the
propounding party, and the number of formal and informal attempts to obtain
discovery.¿ (Lang v. Hochman (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246.)¿ If a
lesser sanction fails to curb abuse, a greater sanction is warranted.¿ (Van
Sickle v. Gilbert (2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 1495, 1516.)¿ However, “the
unsuccessful imposition of a lesser sanction is not an absolute prerequisite to
the utilization of the ultimate sanction.”¿ (Deyo, supra, 84
Cal.App.3d at p. 787.)          
 
            Before any
sanctions may be imposed the court must make an express finding that there has
been a willful failure of the party to serve the required answers.¿ (Fairfield
v. Superior Court for Los Angeles County (1966) 246 Cal.App.2d 113, 118.)¿
Lack of diligence may be deemed willful where the party understood its
obligation, had the ability to comply, and failed to comply.¿ (Deyo, supra,
84 Cal.App.3d at p. 787; Fred Howland Co. v. Superior Court of Los Angeles
County (1966) 244 Cal.App.2d 605, 610-611.)¿ The party who failed to comply
with discovery obligations has the burden of showing that the failure was not
willful.  (Deyo, supra, 84 Cal.App.3d at p. 788; Cornwall v.
Santa Monica Dairy Co. (1977) 66 Cal.App.3d 250; Evid. Code, §§ 500,
605.)¿¿ 
 
III.       DISCUSSION
 
Plaintiffs move for terminating sanctions against Defendant
on the ground that Defendant has not complied with the court’s April 4, 2024,
order directing Defendant to respond to discovery and pay sanctions.  
 
A terminating sanction is a “drastic measure which should be
employed with caution.”¿ (Deyo, 84 Cal.App.3d at p. 793.)¿ “A decision
to order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly.¿ But where a
violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows
that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery
rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.”¿ (Mileikowsky
v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 262, 279-280.)¿ While the
court has discretion to impose terminating sanctions, these sanctions “should
be appropriate to the dereliction and should not exceed that which is required
to protect the interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery.”¿ (Deyo,
84 Cal.App.3d at p. 793.)¿ “[A] court is empowered to apply the ultimate
sanction against a litigant who persists in the outright refusal to comply with
his discovery obligations.”¿ (Ibid.)¿ Discovery sanctions are not
to be imposed for punishment, but instead are used to encourage fair disclosure
of discovery to prevent unfairness resulting for the lack of information.¿ (See
Midwife v. Bernal (1988) 203 Cal.App.3d 57, 64 [superseded on other
grounds as stated in Kohan v. Cohan (1991) 229 Cal.App.3d 967,
971].)¿¿ 
 
Here, Plaintiffs do not demonstrate that terminating
sanctions are warranted. Plaintiffs do not describe a “history of abuse” or a
persistence on the part of Defendant “in the outright refusal to comply with …
discovery obligations.”  Rather,
Plaintiffs show only that Defendant has not complied with one court order.  
 
Plaintiffs also point to Defendant’s failure to pay
court-ordered sanctions.  This, too, does
not change the calculus.  The court may
impose terminating sanctions against anyone engaging in the misuse of the
discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (d), emphasis added.)¿
Misuse of the discovery process includes failure to respond to an authorized
method of discovery or disobeying a court order to provide discovery.¿
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subds. (d), (g), emphasis added.)¿ Plaintiff does
not provide any authority for the proposition that a court may issue a
terminating sanction for failure to pay court-ordered monetary sanctions. 
Given this backdrop, the court declines to impose the drastic measure of
terminating sanctions. 
 
Alternatively, Plaintiffs request imposition of evidentiary
sanctions.  “An evidence sanction is an
order prohibiting designated matters from being introduced in evidence.” (New
Albertsons, Inc. v. Superior Ct. (2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1422, citing
Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (c).) 
The court may impose an evidence sanction against a party that fails to
obey an order compelling their response. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (c).)  
 
Here, Plaintiffs request that the court preclude Defendant
from introducing any evidence (documentary, testimony, etc.) on any issue
covered by the document requests, which include: documents concerning the
construction of the project (plans and specifications, shop drawings, progress
reports), contracts, change orders, is modifications or addenda, emails between
Defendant and Plaintiffs, emails between Defendant and its employees or
subcontractors, photos and videos, insurance policies, communications with the
City of La Canada, Planning Department, documents relating to payments made by
Plaintiffs, all materials related to the Mechanic's Lien, licenses issued,
demands for payments by subcontractors, specific communications with Jose Luis
Dias and Willie Parungo, and other documents. 
(See Jannol Decl., Ex. 1.)  
 
Evidence sanctions are warranted.  Because Defendant did not file an opposition,
Defendant fails to present any evidence or argument that the violation of the
court order was not willful.  The
specificity of the evidentiary sanctions, however, is difficult to discern
based upon this record.[1]  The court is inclined to grant evidence
sanctions tailored to the document request at issue.  At the FSC, the court will be able to better
address what documents, if any, Defendant seeks to introduce and if those
documents were the subject of the discovery request at issue.  If so, the court will preclude Defendant from
introducing those documents.  The court
is not inclined to extend the evidence sanctions to include testimonial
sanctions.  Whether and to what extent the
evidence sanctions impact Defendant’s ability to elicit testimony is too
difficult to discern at this juncture.   
 
Monetary Sanctions
 
Plaintiffs also request imposition of monetary sanctions
against Defendant and its counsel.  The
court finds additional monetary sanctions against Defendant are warranted.  However, discovery sanctions against an
attorney are governed by a different standard than sanctions against a party.  As noted by the court in Kwan Software
Engineering, Inc. v. Hennings (2020) 58 Cal.App.5th 57, 81 (Hennings),

 
“[M] monetary
sanctions against the party’s attorney require a finding the ‘attorney
advis[ed] that conduct.’ ” (Ibid.) “It is not enough that the attorney’s
actions were in some way improper.” (Corns v. Miller (1986) 181
Cal.App.3d 195, 200, 226 Cal.Rptr. 247 (Corns).) Because an attorney’s
advice to a client is “peculiarly within [his or her] knowledge,” the attorney
has the burden of showing that he or she did not counsel discovery abuse. (Ibid.)
Accordingly, when a party seeking sanctions against an attorney offers
sufficient evidence of a misuse of the discovery process, the burden shifts to
the attorney to demonstrate that he or she did not recommend that conduct. (Id.
at pp. 200–201, 226 Cal.Rptr. 247; Ghanooni, at p. 262, 24 Cal.Rptr.2d
501.)¿”
 
            Here,
Plaintiffs do not submit any evidence to show that Defense Counsel advised a
discovery abuse.  Accordingly, the court
will impose sanctions against Defendant only in the sum of $900, consisting of
two hours at Plaintiffs’ counsel’s hourly rate.
 
V.        CONCLUSION 
 
            Based on
the foregoing, the Motion for Termination Sanctions is DENIED.  
 
Plaintiffs’ alternative request for evidence sanctions is GRANTED,
as modified. 
 
Plaintiffs’ request for monetary sanctions is GRANTED.  Defendant is ordered to pay sanctions of $900
to Plaintiffs by and through Plaintiffs’ counsel within 30 days of this order.
 
Moving party to give notice.
