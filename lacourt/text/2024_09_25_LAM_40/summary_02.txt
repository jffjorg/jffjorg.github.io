Roles:
  - Judge: determines whether the Arbitration Agreement is enforceable and whether the single provision "Each party will bear its own attorneys' fees and costs" in paragraph 2 of the Arbitration Agreement is severable and should be struck
Significant Statements:
  - The Arbitration Agreement is procedurally unconscionable due to the unequal bargaining power between De Leon and Allied Digital
  - The Arbitration Agreement is substantively unconscionable due to the lack of mutuality, unlimited duration, employer-controlled pre-arbitration resolution, and requirement to pay costs unique to arbitration
  - The single provision "Each party will bear its own attorneys' fees and costs" in paragraph 2 of the Arbitration Agreement is severable and should be struck to remove the unconscionable taint from the agreement
  - The Court will grant Allied Digital's motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings, with the single provision "Each party will bear its own attorneys' fees and costs" in paragraph 2 of the Arbitration Agreement being stricken.
