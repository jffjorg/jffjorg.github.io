And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling denies the defendant's motion to compel the plaintiff to respond to discovery requests without prejudice, pending proof of proper service of the motion on the plaintiff. The defendant had propounded discovery requests on November 28, 2022, and the plaintiff's counsel had filed a motion to be relieved as counsel on December 28, 2022. The court granted the motion, and the plaintiff's counsel was relieved as counsel on February 2, 2023. However, the plaintiff has not served responses to the discovery requests, and the defendant seeks an order compelling the plaintiff to do so and pay sanctions. The court notes that the proofs of service indicate that the plaintiff's former counsel were served with the motion, but the court requires proof of proper service on the plaintiff himself.
