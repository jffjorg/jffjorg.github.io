And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer to the cross-complaint filed by Williams & Ribb LLP and WNR CPA's, Inc. against Deanna J. Wiebe. The cross-complaint alleges six causes of action, including gender discrimination, failure to prevent gender discrimination, misclassification, failure to pay wages, waiting time penalties, and ERISA violations.

The judge sustains the demurrer to the first two causes of action for gender discrimination and failure to prevent gender discrimination because the cross-complaint fails to allege exhaustion of administrative remedies. However, the judge overrules the demurrer to the remaining four causes of action, finding that Wiebe has alleged sufficient facts to support her claims.

The judge notes that the demurrer relies on factual assertions extrinsic to the cross-complaint and fails to identify the legal standard for determining whether someone is an employee under the relevant statutes. Additionally, the judge finds that the demurrer's argument based on estoppel is flawed because it fails to identify the elements of estoppel and applies them to the cross-complaint's allegations.
