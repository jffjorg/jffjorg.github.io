And here is the summary in English text:

The defendant, Caltrans, moves for summary judgment in this action brought by plaintiffs Scott Miller and Melissa Miller. The parties entered into a settlement agreement in November 2015, which required Caltrans to build a wall with tiebacks on the north side of Pacific Coast Highway. The agreement also required the parties to act reasonably to accommodate two separate improvements. However, the parties did not proceed with the grading project as described in the settlement agreement.

Plaintiffs allege that Caltrans breached the settlement agreement by not building a wall that supports and is compatible with the Millers' proposed grading project, and by failing to provide plans and calculations for the wall. Plaintiffs also allege that Caltrans breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing by failing to provide stability analysis or factor of safety for the deep-seated landslide.

The court finds that Caltrans is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on both causes of action. The court concludes that Caltrans did not breach the settlement agreement because it built the wall in accordance with the approved design and as described in the settlement agreement. The court also finds that Caltrans did not breach the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing because it did not have the information requested by plaintiffs and did not act unreasonably in providing the information it did have.

The court also declines to reach the defendant's arguments that plaintiffs' claims are barred by the Government Claims Act and equitable estoppel.
