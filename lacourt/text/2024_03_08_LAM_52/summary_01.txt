And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The City of Burbank and the People of the State of California, represented by Joseph H. McDougall, City of Burbank City Attorney, have filed a motion to strike and tax the memorandum of costs filed by defendants/cross-complainants Barfly, Inc., Baret Lepejian, Lucas Lepejian, and Tayla Lepejian. The defendants/cross-complainants failed to timely serve and file their memorandum of costs, and therefore, it may be stricken. Additionally, the defendants/cross-complainants were not prevailing parties, as the plaintiffs/cross-defendants successfully moved for summary judgment on the cross-complaint and recovered non-monetary relief against the defendants. The Judge grants the motion to strike costs and strikes the entire memorandum of costs filed by the defendants/cross-complainants.
