 Case Number:  24STLC05911    Hearing Date:   January 13, 2025    Dept:  26 Su v. Ni, et al.TENTATIVE RULING:
Petitioner John Chung-An Su’s
Petition to Approve Compromise of Pending Action on behalf of minor Plaintiff
Kyle Su is GRANTED.  
ANALYSIS:
Minor Plaintiff Kyle Su (“Minor
Plaintiff”), by and through their Guardian Ad Litem John Chung-An Su (“Petitioner”),
filed the instant action for personal injuries against Defendant Byran Yueh Ni (“Defendant”)
on August 15, 2024. Petitioner’s Application for Appointment of Guardian Ad
Litem was granted on September 11, 2024. On October 14, 2024, Petitioner filed the
instant Petition to Approve Compromise of Pending Action (“the Petition”) on
behalf of minor Plaintiff. 
Court
approval is required for all settlements
of a minor’s claim. (Prob. Code §§ 3500, 3600, et seq.; Code Civ. Proc., § 372.) “‘[W]ithout trial court approval
of the proposed compromise of the ward’s claim, the settlement cannot be valid.
[Citation.]  [¶] Nor is the settlement
binding [on the minor] until it is endorsed by the trial court.’” (Pearson
v. Superior Court (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th 1333, 1338.) A minor, like
Claimant, “shall appear either by a guardian or conservator of the estate or by
a guardian ad litem appointed by the court in which the action or proceeding is
pending, or by a judge thereof, in each case.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 372, subd.
(a)(1).) Alternatively, the petitioner may file a declaration demonstrating
that they have a right to compromise the minor’s claim under Cal. Probate Code
section 3500. 
Having
reviewed the instant Petition for Compromise of Pending Action, the Court finds
it is complete and provides for a reasonable settlement based on the injuries
sustained and future prognosis. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.950.) Proposed
orders with respect to the Petition on behalf of minor Plaintiff have also been
filed. 
Conclusion
 
Petitioner John Chung-An Su’s
Petition to Approve Compromise of Pending Action on behalf of minor Plaintiff
Kyle Su is GRANTED.
