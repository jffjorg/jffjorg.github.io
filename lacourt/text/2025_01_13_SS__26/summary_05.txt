The Defendant, Progressive Casualty Insurance Company, has filed a demurrer to the Complaint, arguing that it fails to state a cause of action. The Plaintiff, Maliyah McKnight, has not filed an opposition to the demurrer. The Judge has reviewed the Complaint and found that it does not attach any facts to support the claim of motor vehicle negligence. Therefore, the demurrer is sustained without leave to amend, meaning that the Plaintiff cannot re-file a revised Complaint. The Defendant is ordered to give notice of the ruling.
