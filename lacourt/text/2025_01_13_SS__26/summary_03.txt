And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Petitioner Esomchi Enenwali's petition to release property from a mechanic's lien. The petition was filed on September 3, 2024, and served by first-class mail on September 10, 2024. However, the service did not meet the statutory requirements, as it was not made in the same manner as service of summons or by certified or registered mail with return receipt requested. Additionally, the petition is incomplete, lacking a legal description of the subject property and failing to indicate that the petitioner has not filed for relief under any law. Therefore, the petition does not meet the procedural and substantive statutory requirements to release the mechanic's lien. The judge is denying the petition without prejudice to bringing an amended petition.
