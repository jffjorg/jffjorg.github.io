And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion of William K. Bgdoian, Esq. of Bgdoian Law, P.C. to be relieved as counsel for defendant Arman Walker. The motion was only served electronically by email to the defendant, which is not in compliance with the Rules of Court. Specifically, California Rule of Court 8.78 requires that a party give notice to all parties that it agrees to accept electronic service, and file that notice with the court. The notice must also include the electronic service address at which the party agrees to accept service. Since this was not done, the service of the motion and all subsequent notices is invalid.
