  Case Number:  21TRCV00820    Hearing Date:   January 13, 2025    Dept:  26 Shalyer v. Prairie Hospitality Group, Inc., et al.,TENTATIVE RULING:
Plaintiff
James Shayler’s Motion to Tax Costs is GRANTED IN THE AMOUNT OF
$2,636.14, AS DETAILED HEREIN. ANALYSIS:
On November 5, 2021, Plaintiff James
Shayler (“Plaintiff”) filed the Complaint in this action against Defendants Prairie
Hospitality Group Inc. (“Defendant PHG”), William B.
Serns and Eydie Serns (“the Serns Defendants”). The action was assigned to an
unlimited civil courtroom, Department 8 in the Torrance Courthouse. Default was
entered against Defendant PHG on February 22, 2022, and against the Serns
Defendants on April 25, 2022.
On May 4, 2022, Plaintiff and
Defendant PHG stipulated to vacate the entry of default and Defendant PHG filed
its answer on May 16, 2022. Plaintiff stipulated to the same with the Serns
Defendants on August 2, 2022, who filed their answer on October 3, 2022.
Plaintiff then dismissed Defendant PHG on October 18, 2022. Defendant PHG filed
a memorandum of costs on October 28, 2022. On June 29, 2023, the Court denied Plaintiff’s
Motion to Strike, or in the alternative, to Tax Costs sought in Defendant PHG’s
memorandum of costs. (Minute Order, 06/29/23.)
The case was then reclassified to
the limited jurisdiction court by stipulation on May 3, 2024. (Stip and Order,
05/03/24.) On October 23, 2024, Plaintiff dismissed the Serns Defendants from
the action. The Serns Defendants filed a memorandum of costs on the same date.
Plaintiff filed the instant
Motion to Tax Costs on November 7, 2024. No opposition has been filed to date. 
Discussion
Plaintiff moves to tax the costs from the Serns Defendants’ Memorandum of Costs, filed on October
23, 2024. The Motion is brought pursuant to California Rules of Court, rule
3.1700(b) and Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5. Code of Civil Procedure
section 1033.5 states in relevant part: 
(c) An award of costs shall be subject
to the following:
(1) Costs are allowable if incurred,
whether or not paid. 
(2) Allowable costs shall be
reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation rather than merely
convenient or beneficial to its preparation. 
(3) Allowable costs shall be
reasonable in amount. 
(4) Items not mentioned in this
section and items assessed upon application may be allowed or denied in the
court's discretion. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (c).)
“Any notice of
motion to strike or to tax costs must be served and filed 15 days after service
of the cost memorandum. If the cost memorandum was served by mail, the period
is extended as provided in Code of Civil Procedure section 1013. If the cost
memorandum was served electronically, the period is extended as provided in
Code of Civil Procedure section 1010.6(a)(4).” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule
3.1700(b)(1).) The Memorandum of Costs was electronically served on Plaintiff
on October 23, 2024. The instant Motion to Tax Costs was timely filed and
served 15 days later.
Plaintiff objects to specific costs on the grounds that they
were (1) not incurred by the Serns Defendants; and (2) already paid to defense
counsel in July 2023 to compensate costs incurred by Defendant PHG. These costs include Item 4, deposition costs in
the amount of $1,841.00, Item 9, court ordered transcripts in the amount of
$50.00, Item 14, fees for electronic filing or service in the amount of
$737.67, Item 15, fees for hosting electronic documents in the amount of
$20.00, and Item 16, LASC Case Documents Access in the amount of $61.65. 
For Item 4, deposition costs in the amount of $1,841.00,
Plaintiff demonstrates that the deposition was noticed by Defendant PHG, not by
the Serns Defendants. (Motion, Janowski Decl., ¶5 and Exh. D.) Item 9, court
ordered transcripts in the amount of $50.00, correspond to a motion to compel
further responses brought by Defendant PHG with respect to discovery propounded
only by Defendant PHG. (Id. at ¶6 and
Exh. E.) For Item 14, fees for electronic filing or service in the amount of $663.49,
Plaintiff shows that these fees were actually incurred by Defendant PHG for its
filings and were claimed by Defendant PHG in its memorandum of costs. (Id.
at ¶2 and Exhs. A-B.) The filings included Defendant PHG’s stipulation to
vacate default, answer, case management statement, motion to compel, memorandum
of costs, opposition to motion to tax costs, and ex parte application to
continue hearing date on motion to tax costs. (Ibid.) Plaintiff
challenges Item 15, fees for hosting electronic documents in the amount of
$20.00 for failing to show that it was incurred by any party. Finally, Item 16,
LASC Case Documents Access in the amount of $61.65 was incurred with respect to
Defendant PHG’s motion to compel. (Id. at ¶¶4, 6 and Exhs. C, E.)
This evidence raises a successful, and uncontested challenge to the costs
claimed by the Serns Defendants on the grounds that they were not actually
incurred, as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5, subdivision
(c). The Serns Defendants have filed no opposition to the instant Motion to
demonstrate that the costs are proper. Therefore, the memorandum of costs filed
on October 23, 2024 is taxed in the amount of $2,636.14. 
Conclusion 
Plaintiff
James Shayler’s Motion to Tax Costs is GRANTED IN THE AMOUNT OF
$2,636.14, AS DETAILED HEREIN.
Moving party to give notice.
