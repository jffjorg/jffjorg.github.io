 Case Number:  24STLC07003    Hearing Date:   January 13, 2025    Dept:  26 McKnight v. Progressive Casualty Ins. Co., et al.,TENTATIVE RULING:
Defendant Progressive Casualty Insurance Company’s Demurrer
to the Complaint is SUSTAINED WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND. 
ANALYSIS:

On September 30, 2024, Plaintiff Maliyah
McKnight (“Plaintiff”), in propria persona, filed the
Complaint in this action against Defendant Progressive Casualty Insurance
Company (“Defendant”) and others. On December 12, 2024, Defendant filed the
instant Demurrer to the Complaint. No opposition has been filed to date. 
Discussion
The Demurrer is accompanied by a
meet and confer declaration as required by Code of Civil Procedure section
430.41. (Demurrer, Lowell Decl., ¶2 and Exh. A.)
Defendant demurs on the grounds that the Complaint fails to
allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action. (Citing Code Civ. Proc., §
430.10, subd. (e).) The Complaint indicates that it asserts a cause of action
for motor vehicle negligence but attaches no facts in support of such a claim,
as required. (Compl., ¶10(a).) Without any attachments setting forth facts to
support the purported claim, the Complaint fails to state a cause of action. (Id.
at p. 2.) Nor has Plaintiff filed any opposition to the instant demurrer
demonstrating that facts can be alleged to articulate a cause of action against
Defendant. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348 [the burden is
on complainant to show the Court a reasonable possibility of successful
amendment].) Therefore, the demurrer is sustained without leave to amend.
Conclusion
Defendant Progressive Casualty Insurance Company’s Demurrer
to the Complaint is SUSTAINED WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND. 
Moving party to give notice.
