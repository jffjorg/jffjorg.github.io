Petition To Approve Minor’s
Compromise 
Hearing Date: 10/4/24 
Claimant Name: Valerie Chicatti and Roman Chicatti, minors 
CASE NO./NAME: 22STCV07252
ALICIA HUESCA, et al. vs PHILIP SPENCER LEWIN MCKENDNEE
 
Ruling: DENY
 
TENTATIVE 
 
The Court excuses the personal appearance of Claimant
and the guardian ad litem. Counsel may appear by telephone or video conference
call.
 
The applications for the appointment of a guardian ad
litem for both claimants, Valerie Chicatti and Roman Chicatti, have been
rejected. Thus, the present petitions for minor’s compromise are premature.
Nonetheless, there are several identical deficiencies as to both petitions:
 
·       
Item 3b, instead of Item 3a, of the petitions need to
be checked.
·       
Item 17f of the petitions need to be completed, as
counsel is expecting to receive attorney's fees from the other two plaintiffs.
·       
Attachment 18b(2) of the petitions and Plaintiffs'
proposed orders do not include the bank name or address for the blocked
account. That information needs to be provided.
 
Petitioner is hereby
ordered to correct the deficiencies noted above no less than 5 days prior to
the new court date set below. ¿
