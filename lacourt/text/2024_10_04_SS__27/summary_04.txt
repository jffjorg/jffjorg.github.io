And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the petitions for minor's compromise filed by Valerie Chicatti and Roman Chicatti, minors, represented by counsel. The court has excused the personal appearance of the claimants and the guardian ad litem, and has rejected the applications for the appointment of a guardian ad litem. The judge has identified several identical deficiencies in the petitions, including incomplete information regarding bank accounts and attorney's fees. The petitioner is ordered to correct these deficiencies no later than 5 days prior to a new court date set for non-appearance case review. Failure to provide corrected documents may result in an order to show cause for sanctions.
