And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion for judgment on the pleadings filed by the defendants. The motion was unopposed, and the defendants seek to dismiss the case due to the alleged death of the plaintiff, M. Lynne Marta. The defendants relied on an IMDb page and a newspaper article to prove the plaintiff's death, but the judge found that these sources are not reliable and do not meet the standard for judicial notice under California Evidence Code ยง452(h). The judge noted that courts typically take judicial notice of more authoritative and verifiable sources, such as official records, and that the defendants failed to provide sufficient evidence linking the individual mentioned in the IMDb page and newspaper article to the plaintiff in the present case. As a result, the motion is denied, and the case will proceed.
