And here is the summary in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to vacate the dismissal of the case. The case was originally filed by Sabrina Garcia against Natalie Angela Mattera, et al. on August 10, 2022. On January 24, 2024, Plaintiff represented to the Court that the matter had settled. However, the case was not dismissed, and on June 7, 2024, the Court directed Plaintiff's counsel to file a Declaration addressing the delay in dismissing the action. On September 5, 2024, the case was dismissed due to Plaintiff's failure to file the required Declaration.

Plaintiff has now moved to vacate the dismissal, citing California Code of Civil Procedure, Section 473, subdivision (b), which allows for relief from a judgment, dismissal, or other proceedings taken against a party or their attorney due to mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. The Court has found that Plaintiff's counsel's mistake was the cause of the dismissal and has granted the motion to vacate the dismissal.
