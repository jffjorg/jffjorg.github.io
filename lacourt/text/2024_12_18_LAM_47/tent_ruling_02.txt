arising from a commercial lease agreement. Plaintiff alleges that Defendants

to compel responses to requests for admissions. 
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Defendant Bristol Central, L.P. moves
to compel responses to requests for admissions. However, no such motion is
authorized by the Code of Civil Procedure, which permits only Motions to Deem
the Truth of Matters Stated (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280) and Motions to Compel Further
Responses to Requests for Admissions (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.290.) This is
neither. 
 
Accordingly, Defendant’s Motion to
Compel Responses to Requests for Admissions is DENIED.
Defendant’s Request for Sanctions
is DENIED. 
 
            Moving
Party to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.

should be noted that if you submit on a tentative ruling the court will still
conduct a hearing if any party appears. By submitting on the tentative you
have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you
should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an
order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
