And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the defendants on several issues. The defendants' motion for summary judgment or alternative summary adjudication of the first through fourth causes of action is granted in part. The court finds that the defendants are entitled to summary adjudication of the second cause of action, which alleges that the defendants failed to allow inspection of corporate records in Arizona. The court also finds that the defendants' refusal to provide access to inspect and copy all corporate records under California Corporations Code section 1601 is improper. However, the court finds that there are triable issues of fact that the defendants have improperly prevented inspection of corporate records under Corporations Code Section 1601 and in violation of GW California's bylaws. The court has granted summary adjudication of the second and fourth causes of action, but denied summary adjudication of the first and third causes of action.
