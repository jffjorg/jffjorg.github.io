Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has ruled that the Plaintiff's application for a writ of possession is continued pending the Plaintiff's provision of additional documents and proof of service. The Plaintiff must provide proof of service of the summons and complaint, notice of the application, and copy of the application on the Defendant. The Plaintiff must also provide an approximate value of the vehicle, which is a 2012 Ferrari 458 Coupe, and an undertaking in an amount not less than twice the value of the Defendant's interest in the property. The Judge has found that the Plaintiff has demonstrated its entitlement to possession of the property due to the Defendant's default under the lease and the probable validity of the Plaintiff's claims for claim and delivery and breach of contract. The Judge has also found that the Plaintiff has been damaged by being deprived of possession of the vehicle.
