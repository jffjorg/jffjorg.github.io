And here is the summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is that the motion to substitute a successor in interest for the deceased plaintiff, Richard Wells, is granted. The case arose from a slip and fall on March 25, 2018, at a Burger King location in Long Beach, California. The plaintiff died on August 13, 2023, and his widow, Brenda Wells, seeks to substitute as plaintiff. The court finds that the declaration filed by Brenda Wells meets the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 377.31. The court grants the motion to substitute, finding that the cause of action does not abate with the plaintiff's death and that allowing the substitution will serve the interests of justice.
