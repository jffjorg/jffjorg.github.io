The Judge finds that good cause exists for the continuance due to the Defendant's timely filed motion for summary judgment, which is set to be heard on October 9, 2024. The Judge notes that the law is clear that a party has a right to have a timely filed motion for summary judgment heard before trial. The Judge concludes that the motion for a continuance is granted, and the trial date is advanced and continued to a date in mid-January 2025.
