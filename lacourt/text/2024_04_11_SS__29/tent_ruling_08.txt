 Case Number:  22STCV09726    Hearing Date:   April 11, 2024    Dept:  29 Defendant’s Motion
to Continue Trial 
Tentative
The motion is granted.
Background
On March 21, 2022, Walter E. Jones and Yahne
Coleman (collectively “Plaintiffs”) filed a complaint against Six Flags Magic
Mountain, Inc.; Six Flags Magic Mountain Limited Partnership; and Does 1 through
10.  On May 3, 2022, Plaintiffs filed the
First Amended Complaint (the “FAC”) against Six Flags Theme Parks Inc.; Six
Flags Entertainment Corporation; and Does 1 through 10, asserting causes of
action for premises liability; negligence in training, retention, and
supervision; and negligent infliction of emotional distress.  All of Plaintiffs’ causes of action arise out
of an alleged altercation with theme park patrons on June 29, 2021.
On May 27, 2022, Plaintiffs amended the FAC
to name Magic Mountain, LLC (“Defendant”) as Doe 1. 
On March 27, 2023, Defendant filed its answer
to the FAC.
On February 28, 2024, Defendant filed its
motion for summary judgment.  The motion
is set for hearing on October 9, 2024. 
The trial date is June 11, 2024.
On March 13, 2024, Defendant filed this motion to
continue trial. Plaintiffs filed an opposition on March 27, and Defendant filed
a reply on April 4.
Legal Standard
Code of Civil Procedure section 128,
subdivision (a)(8), provides that the court has the power to amend and control
its process and orders so as to make them conform to law and justice. “The
power to determine when a continuance should be granted is within the
discretion of the trial court.” (Color-Vue, Inc. v. Abrams (1996) 44
Cal.App.4th 1599, 1603.) “A trial court has wide latitude in the matter of
calendar control including the granting or denying of continuances.” (Park
Motors, Inc. v. Cozens (1975) 49 Cal.App.3d 12, 18.)  
Each request for a continuance must be
considered on its own merits according to California Rules of Court, Rule
3.1332(c). The court may grant a continuance only on an affirmative showing of
good cause requiring the continuance. Circumstances of good cause include:  
“(1) The
unavailability of an essential lay or expert witness because of death, illness,
or other excusable circumstances;  
(2) The
unavailability of a party because of death, illness, or other excusable
circumstances;  
(3) The
unavailability of trial counsel because of death, illness, or other excusable
circumstances;  
(4) The
substitution of trial counsel, but only where there is an affirmative showing
that the substitution is required in the interests of justice;  
(5) The addition
of a new party if: (A) The new party has not had a reasonable opportunity to
conduct discovery and prepare for trial; or (B) The other parties have not had
a reasonable opportunity to conduct discovery and prepare for trial in regard
to the new party's involvement in the case; 

(6) A party's
excused inability to obtain essential testimony, documents, or other material
evidence despite diligent efforts; or  
(7) A
significant, unanticipated change in the status of the case as a result of
which the case is not ready for trial.”  
(Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1332(c).)  
California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1332 sets
forth a list of non-exhaustive factors to be analyzed when determining whether
good cause for a trial continuance is present. A court considers factors such
as:  
“(1) The
proximity of the trial date;  
(2) Whether
there was any previous continuance, extension of time, or delay of trial due to
any party;  
(3) The length
of the continuance requested;  
(4) The
availability of alternative means to address the problem that gave rise to the
motion or application for a continuance; 

(5) The
prejudice that parties or witnesses will suffer as a result of the continuance;

(6) If the case
is entitled to a preferential trial setting, the reasons for that status and
whether the need for a continuance outweighs the need to avoid delay; 
(7) The court's
calendar and the impact of granting a continuance on other pending trials; 
(8) Whether
trial counsel is engaged in another trial; 

(9) Whether all
parties have stipulated to a continuance; 

(10) Whether the
interests of justice are best served by a continuance, by the trial of the
matter, or by imposing conditions on the continuance; and  
(11) Any other
fact or circumstance relevant to the fair determination of the motion or
application.”  
(Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1332(d).) 
“A trial court may not refuse to hear a summary judgment
motion filed within the time limits of section 437c.” (Sentry Ins. Co. v.
Superior Court (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 526, 529; accord Cole v. Superior
Court (2022) 87 Cal.App.5th 84, 88.)
“A party may move for summary judgment in an action or
proceeding if it is contended that the action has no merit or that there is no
defense to the action or proceeding. … Notice of the motion and supporting
papers shall be served on all other parties to the action at least 75 days
before the time appointed for hearing. …The motion shall be heard no later than
30 days before the date of trial, unless the court for good cause orders
otherwise. The filing of the motion shall not extend the time within which a
party must otherwise file a responsive pleading.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c,
subd. (a).)
Electronic service of a document extends any period of notice
by two court days. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1010.6, subd. (a)(3)(B).)
Discussion
Defendant contends
good cause exists to continue trial as it has filed a motion for summary
judgment, set to be heard October 9, 2024, after the current trial date of June
11, 2024. (Makorow Decl., ¶ 1.) Defendant states this motion is timely as the
motion cut-off date is May 13, 2024, and the motion for summary judgment was
served on February 28, 2024.  (Mem. at p.
4:14-27.)  
Plaintiffs do not contend that the summary judgment motion was
not timely filed.  Instead, they argue
that Defendant should have acted sooner to reserve an earlier hearing date amd
that they will be prejudiced by the requested continuance.
As the Court
previously noted, however, the law is clear that a party has a right to have a
timely filed motion for summary judgment heard before trial.  (See Cole v. Superior Court (2022)
87 Cal.App.5th 84, 88; Sentry Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1989) 207
Cal.App.3d 526, 529.)  
Good cause has been shown. 
The motion for a continuance until after the hearing on Defendant’s
summary judgment motion is granted.
Plaintiffs argue in the alternative that if the motion is
granted, trial should be continued to mid January 2025 so that they will have
adequate time to prepare for trial in the event that the summary judgment
motion is denied.  That seems appropriate
to the Court, and Defendant does not argue otherwise in its reply.
Conclusion
The Court GRANTS Defendant’s Motion to
Continue Trial.
The trial date is advanced and continued to a
date in mid January 2025.  The Final
Status Conference and all deadlines are reset based on the new trial date. 
Moving Party is ORDERED to give notice.
