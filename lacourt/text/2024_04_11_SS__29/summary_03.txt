And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling grants the Plaintiff's motion to reopen discovery. The Plaintiff sought to reopen discovery to depose a potentially adverse witness and to obtain a ruling on a pending motion to compel. The Defendant objected to the motion, citing untimely service and lack of diligence by the Plaintiff. However, the Court found that the Plaintiff had made a sufficient showing for the request to reopen discovery. The Court considered the factors set forth in California Code of Civil Procedure section 2024.050, including the necessity and reasons for the discovery, the diligence or lack of diligence of the party seeking the discovery, and the likelihood that permitting the discovery or hearing the discovery motion will prevent the case from going to trial on the date set or cause any undue or unfair prejudice to any other party. The Court granted the motion, resetting all discovery deadlines based on the trial date of August 28, 2024.
