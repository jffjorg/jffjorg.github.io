 Case Number:  22STCV06001    Hearing Date:   April 11, 2024    Dept:  29 Motion to be
Relieved as Counsel, filed by Plaintiff’s Counsel Jacob Brown of Downtown Law
Group. 
Tentative
The hearing on the motion is continued.
Background
On February 16, 2022, Lamar Reaves (“Plaintiff”)
filed a complaint against Gwendolyn Achury and Does 1 to 20 for motor vehicle
negligence and general negligence causes of action arising from an automobile
accident occurring on October 6, 2020.
On March 20, 2024, Jacob
Brown of Downtown Law Group (“Counsel”) filed this motion to be relieved
as counsel. No opposition has been filed. 
Legal
Standard
The court may order that an attorney be changed or
substituted at any time before or after judgment or final determination upon
request by either client or attorney and after notice from one to the other.
(Code of Civ. Proc., § 284(b).) An attorney is permitted to withdraw where
conflicts between the attorney and client make it unreasonable to continue the
representation. (See Cal. Rules of Prof. Conduct 3-700(C)(1).) “The
determination whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel lies
within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi & Levine v.
Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1133.)   
 
An application to be relieved as counsel must be made on
Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion) (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.136(c)), and MC-053 (Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362(e)).   
 
Further, the requisite forms must be served on the client
and all other parties who have appeared in the case. (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1362(d).) The court may delay effective date of the order relieving
counsel until proof of service of a copy of the signed order on the client has
been filed with the court. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).) 
 
Discussion
 
Counsel has
filed the Notice, Declaration and Order to be Relieved as Counsel. Service has
been made on all parties in this action. Counsel contends there has been a
breakdown of the attorney-client relationship. Counsel was unable to confirm Plaintiff’s
address, but conducted a TLO search and sent the moving papers with return
receipt requested.
 
However, Counsel
has failed to list all upcoming hearings on both the declaration and order.  Counsel lists the OSC re dismissal on
February 13, 2025, correctly.  The trial
date listed is 4/25/2024, which was correct at the time of filing but has since
been continued.  The Final Status
Conference is not listed in either the declaration or the proposed order. 
 
The Court will
continue the hearing to permit moving counsel to file and serve an updated and
complete declaration and proposed order.
 
Conclusion
The hearing on
the motion to be relieved as counsel is CONTINUED for approximately 14 days.
Moving counsel
to give notice.
