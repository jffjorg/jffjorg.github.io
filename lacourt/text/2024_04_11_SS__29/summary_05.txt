And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted Uber's motion to compel the second deposition of Plaintiff, Dominique Johnston. The judge has also granted leave for Uber to notice a second deposition of Plaintiff, subject to certain restrictions. The deposition will not exceed two hours, and the questioning will be limited to specific topics, including treatments received after October 11, 2022, symptoms or injuries that developed or worsened after October 11, 2022, and lost work or earnings after October 11, 2022. The judge has denied the request for sanctions, finding that Plaintiff and counsel have acted with substantial justification in opposing the request for leave to take a second deposition.
