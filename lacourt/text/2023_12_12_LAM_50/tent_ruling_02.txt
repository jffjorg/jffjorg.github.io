TENTATIVE RULING
  RE: 
 
MOTION FOR AWARD
  OF MANDATORY ATTORNEY FEES AND COSTS



 
            Background
On October 21, 2021,
Plaintiffs 800 E. Pico Blvd., LLC and Xiang Hao Cui (jointly, “Plaintiffs”)
filed this action against Defendants Online Edugo, Inc. (“Edugo”), Andrew Kim
(“Kim”) and Law Office of Andrew Kim, APC (the “Law Office”). The Complaint
asserts one cause of action for wrongful use of civil proceedings. 
On August 3, 2022, the
Court issued an Order granting Edugo’s special motion to strike Plaintiffs’
Complaint. In addition, on April 28, 2023, the Court issued an Order granting
Kim and the Law Office’s special motion to strike Plaintiffs’ Complaint. 
Edugo and the Law Office
(jointly, the “Moving Parties”) now move for an order compelling Plaintiffs to
pay the Moving Parties attorney fees “in connection with the successful
Special Motions to Strike, and to prepare this Motion, for all the mandatory
fees and costs.” (Notice of Motion at p. 2:3-5.) 
 
Discussion
The anti-SLAPP statute
provides that “a prevailing defendant on a special motion to strike
shall be entitled to recover that defendant’s attorney’s fees and costs.” (Code Civ. Proc.,     § 425.16, subd. (c)(1).) An award of fees may also include “the fees incurred in enforcing
the right to mandatory fees under Code of Civil
Procedure section 425.16.” (Ketchum v.
Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1141.)

            As an initial matter, Plaintiffs assert in the opposition
that the instant motion is untimely. Plaintiffs cite to California Rules of Court, rule 3.1702, which provides, inter alia, that “[e]xcept as otherwise provided
by statute, this rule applies in civil cases to claims for statutory attorney’s
fees and claims for attorney’s fees provided for in a contract. Subdivisions
(b) and (c) apply when the court determines entitlement to the fees, the amount
of the fees, or both, whether the court makes that determination because the
statute or contract refers to ‘reasonable’ fees, because it requires a
determination of the prevailing party, or for other reasons.” (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1702, subd. (a).) Pursuant to California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1702, subdivision (b), “[a]
notice of motion to claim attorney’s fees for services up to and including the
rendition of judgment in the trial court--including attorney’s fees on an
appeal before the rendition of judgment in the trial court--must be served and
filed within the time for filing a notice of appeal under rules
8.104 and 8.108 in an unlimited civil case…” 
            Pursuant
to California Rules of Court, rule 8.104, subdivision
(a), “[u]nless a statute or rules 8.108, 8.702,
or 8.712 provides otherwise, a notice of appeal must be filed on or before the
earliest of: (1) (A) 60 days after the superior court clerk serves
on the party filing the notice of appeal a document entitled ‘Notice of Entry’
of judgment or a filed-endorsed copy of the judgment, showing the date either
was served; (B) 60 days after the party filing the notice of
appeal serves or is served by a party with a document entitled ‘Notice of
Entry’ of judgment or a filed-endorsed copy of the judgment, accompanied by
proof of service; or (C) 180 days after entry of judgment.” California Rules of Court, rule
8.104, subdivision (e) provides that “[a]s
used in (a) and (d), ‘judgment’ includes an appealable order if the appeal is
from an appealable order.” Plaintiffs note that “[a]n order granting or denying a special motion to strike shall be
appealable under Section 904.1.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
425.16, subd. (i).)  
            Plaintiffs assert that accordingly, the “deadline
to appeal an order granting a special motion to strike is 60 days after service
by the clerk of a filed-endorsed copy of the order granting the anti-SLAPP
motion, or 60 days after notice of entry of that order is served by a party,
whichever is earlier.” (Opp’n at p. 2:10-13.) 
             Plaintiffs note that here, on April 28, 2023, the Court issued an
Order granting Kim and the Law Office’s special motion to strike. The Court’s
April 28, 2023 minute order provides, inter alia, that “[t]he
Special Motion to Strike under CCP Section 425.16 (Anti-SLAPP motion) filed by Andrew
Kim, Law Office of Andrew Kim, APC on 11/28/2022 is Granted.” 
On April 28, 2023, a Certificate of Mailing was filed which provides, inter
alia, that “I, the below-named Executive Officer/Clerk of the
above-entitled court, do hereby certify that I am not a party to the cause
herein, and that on this date I served the Minute Order (Hearing on Special
Motion to Strike under CCP Section 425.16 ...) of
04/28/2023 upon each party or counsel named below by placing the document for
collection and mailing so as to cause it to be deposited in the United States
mail at the courthouse in Los Angeles, California, one copy of the original
filed/entered herein in a separate sealed envelope to each address as shown
below with the postage thereon fully prepaid, in accordance with standard court
practices.” This certificate of mailing filed on April 28, 2023 is dated May 1,
2023. Sixty days after May 1, 2023 is June 30, 2023. As noted by Plaintiffs,
the instant motion was filed on September 28, 2023. 
            The Court notes that the Moving
Parties did not file any reply in support of the motion, and thus do not
dispute that the motion is untimely. 
            The Court also notes that to the
extent the instant motion concerns Edugo’s motion to strike, the Court issued
an Order on August 3, 2022 granting Edugo’s special motion to
strike Plaintiffs’ Complaint. The docket for this action does not appear to
show the filing of a certificate of mailing of the August 3, 2022 Order. In any
event, 180 days after August 3, 2022 is January 30, 2023. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 8.104, subd. (a)(1)(C).) The instant motion was filed on
September 28, 2023. 
            In light of the foregoing, the Court denies the instant
motion as untimely. 
Conclusion
Based on the foregoing, the Moving Parties’ motion
for attorney’s fees is denied. 
Plaintiffs are ordered to provide notice of
this Order.
