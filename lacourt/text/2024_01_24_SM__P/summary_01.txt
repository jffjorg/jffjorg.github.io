And here is the summary in English text:

This tentative ruling addresses a motion by the plaintiffs, De Julio, et al., to file a first amended complaint to add punitive damages to their habitability case against defendant Tana, et al. The defendant opposes the motion, arguing that the plaintiffs should have known about the defendant's receipt of replacement income from her insurance company earlier, and that the motion will cause prejudice and necessitate a trial continuance. The court agrees that there is no evidence that the plaintiffs previously knew about the replacement income, and that the issue of punitive damages does not appear to necessitate much additional discovery. The court grants the motion, citing the strong policy in favor of liberal allowance of amendments.
