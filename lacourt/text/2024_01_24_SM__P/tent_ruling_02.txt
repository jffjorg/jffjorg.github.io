Mejia v. Campione, et al., Case No. 22SMCV01905
Hearing date January
24, 2024
(1) Defendant/Cross-Complainant
Campione’s Motion for Terminating Sanctions
(2) Defendant/Cross-Complainant Woo’s
Motion for Terminating Sanctions
Plaintiff sued
defendants Campione and Woo in this motor vehicle accident matter. On October
13, 2023, the court ordered plaintiff to respond to all outstanding discovery
within 30 days and to pay monetary sanctions. Defendants each bring a motion
for terminating sanctions. Both defendants filed proofs of service of their
respective motions. Plaintiff has not filed an opposition to either motion.
 
Where a party
fails to obey an order compelling answers to discovery, “the court may make
those orders that are just, including the imposition of an issue sanction, an
evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction.” Code Civ. Proc. §§2031.300;
2023.010(c); R.S. Creative, Inc. v. Creative Cotton, Ltd. (1999) 75
Cal.App.4th 486, 495. The court may impose terminating sanctions for misuse of
the discovery process. Code Civ. Proc. §2023.030(d). Misuse of the discovery
process includes failure to respond to discovery or disobeying a court order to
provide discovery. Code Civ. Proc. §2023.010(d), (g). A terminating sanction
may dismiss all or part of the action. Code Civ. Proc. §2023.030 (d)(3).
 
The court should
consider the totality of the circumstances to determine if the actions were
willful, the detriment to propounding party, and the number of attempts to
obtain discovery. Lang v. Hochman (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246. If a
lesser sanction fails to curb abuse, a greater sanction is warranted. Van
Sickle v. Gilbert (2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 1495, 1516. However, “the
unsuccessful imposition of a lesser sanction is not an absolute prerequisite to
the utilization of the ultimate sanction.” Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84
Cal.App.3d 771, 787. Terminating sanctions should not be ordered lightly, but
are justified where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and
there is evidence that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance. Doppes
v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 967, 992.
 
Before sanctions
may be imposed, the court must make an express finding of willful failure to
serve the answers. Fairfield v. Superior Court for Los Angeles County
(1966) 246 Cal.App.2d 113, 118. Lack of diligence may be deemed willful where
the party understood its obligation, had ability to comply and failed to do. Deyo,
supra, 84 Cal.App.3d at 787; Fred Howland Co. v. Superior
Court of Los Angeles County (1966) 244 Cal.App.2d 605, 610-611. The party
who failed to comply with discovery obligations has the burden of showing the
failure was not willful. Deyo, supra, 84 Cal.App.3d at 788; Cornwall
v. Santa Monica Dairy Co. (1977) 66 Cal.App.3d 250; Evid. Code, §§ 500,
605.
 
Plaintiff filed no
opposition to either motion and failed to respond to discovery or pay monetary
sanctions and has disobeyed court orders to do so. Notice was provided. Plaintiff
is deemed to have known of the discovery obligations and court order compelling
compliance, and failed to show noncompliance was not willful. Given the
foregoing, the Court finds the failure was willful and lesser sanctions would
not curb the abuse. Accordingly, the motions are GRANTED. As the court is
granting terminating sanctions, it declines to also impose monetary sanctions.
