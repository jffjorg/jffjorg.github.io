And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of 1200 Management, LLC vs. Anton Ivchenko. The defendant, Anton Ivchenko, has moved to set aside a default judgment entered against him, claiming that he did not receive actual notice of the action in time to defend himself. The court has denied the motion, finding that the defendant's lack of actual notice was caused by his own inexcusable neglect, including his failure to visit his business office frequently and his listing of a different address for service of process with the California Secretary of State.

The court has granted the plaintiff's application for default judgment, awarding damages of $69,951.04, which includes outstanding balances of $55,779.44 in unpaid rent and $3,142.15 in late fees, as well as interest and attorney's fees. The court has also awarded the plaintiff costs of $592.88 for filing fees and service of process.

The court has denied the defendant's request to set aside the default judgment, finding that the service of process was proper and that the defendant had actual notice of the action. The court has also denied the defendant's request for attorney's fees, finding that the amount requested was excessive and not supported by the evidence.
