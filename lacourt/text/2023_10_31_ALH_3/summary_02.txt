And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the Defendant's motion for summary judgment in a medical malpractice case. The Plaintiff, Danny A. Godoy, filed a survival action against the Defendant, Shane S. Pak, M.D., and others, alleging that Godoy's wife, Ana Xanthe Chirino Godoy, died from excessive blood loss during a lumbar decompression surgery performed by the Defendant. The Defendant argued that he complied with the standard of care and presented expert declarations from board-certified orthopedic surgeon Jeffrey E. Deckey and anesthesiologist Kevin Becker, M.D. The Judge found that the Defendant has sufficiently shown compliance with the standard of care and that the Plaintiff has failed to produce conflicting expert evidence. Therefore, the motion for summary judgment is granted.
