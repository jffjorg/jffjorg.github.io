And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the plaintiff's motion for reconsideration and amended the order to specify that the plaintiff's obligations for storage fees do not exceed $2,750. The court has also denied the plaintiff's request for attorneys' fees, finding that the request was substantively deficient. The court notes that granting the application for writ of possession does not necessarily conclude the litigation, and that the plaintiff may still be able to recover reasonable attorneys' fees as costs in the future. The court has scheduled a hearing for October 31, 2023, and parties who wish to submit on the tentative must email the court to indicate their intention to do so.
