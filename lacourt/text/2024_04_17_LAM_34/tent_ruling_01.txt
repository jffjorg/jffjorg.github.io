PRELIMINARY
COMMENTS:
 
“We conclude by reminding
members of the Bar that their responsibilities as officers of the court include
professional courtesy to the court and to opposing counsel. All too often today
we see signs that the practice of law is becoming more like a business and less
like a profession. We decry any such change, but the profession itself
must chart its own course. The legal profession has already suffered a loss of
stature and of public respect. This is more easily understood when the public
perspective of the profession is shaped by cases such as this where lawyers
await the slightest provocation to turn upon each other. Lawyers and judges
should work to improve and enhance the rule of law, not allow a return to the
law of the jungle.” (Lossing v. Superior Court (1989) 207
Cal.App.3d 635, 641.)
 
        The Court reminds both counsel that they must comply with Los
Angeles Superior Court, Local Rules, Appendix 3.A:  “Guidelines for Civility in Litigation.”
 
 
BACKGROUND:
 
On October
27, 2023, Plaintiffs Vrezh Hovhanissyan and Leo Gonzalez filed their Complaint
against Defendants Soraya Moazaam, Faro Optometry Inc., and Faro Management, LLC.
The causes of action arise from an alleged business relationship gone awry. 
 
On December
14, 2023, the First Amended Complaint (FAC) was filed, which omitted Leo
Gonzalez as a plaintiff and added a cause of action. 
 
On December

First Amended Complaint. 
 
On February

filed their Demurrer to the FAC. In support of their Demurrer, Defendants
concurrently filed their Request for Judicial Notice. 
 
On March 27,
2024, Plaintiff filed her Opposition to the Demurrer. Plaintiff concurrently
filed her Opposition to the Request for Judicial Notice. 
 
On March 27,
2024, by request of Plaintiff, the Clerk’s Office entered default on Defendant
Faro Management, LLC. 
 
        On April 3, 2024,
Defendants filed their Reply in support of the Demurrer. 
 
ANALYSIS:
 
I.         
Request for Judicial Notice
 
Defendants request that the Court take
judicial notice of the docket in Case No. LACBA514505 before the Superior Court
of California, County of Los Angeles. 
 
The Court DENIES as irrelevant judicial notice to
this item. “Although a court may judicially notice a variety of matters (Evid.
Code, § 450 et seq.), only relevant material may be noticed.” (Am.
Cemwood Corp. v. Am. Home Assurance Co. (2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 431, 441, fn.
7, quotation omitted, italics in original.)
 
II.      
Legal Standard
 
“The party
against whom a complaint or cross-complaint has been filed may object, by
demurrer or answer as provided in Section 430.30, to the pleading on any one or
more of” various grounds listed in statute. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10.)
 
“When any ground for
objection to a complaint, cross-complaint, or answer appears on the face
thereof, or from any matter of which the court is required to or may take
judicial notice, the objection on that ground may be taken by a demurrer to the
pleading.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.30, subd. (a).)
 
“A demurrer to a
complaint or cross-complaint may be taken to the whole complaint or
cross-complaint or to any of the causes of action stated therein.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 430.50, subd. (a).)
 
“In reviewing the sufficiency
of a complaint against a general demurrer, we are guided by long-settled rules.
We treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded, but not
contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law. We also consider matters which may be judicially
noticed. Further, we give the complaint a reasonable interpretation,
reading it as a whole and its parts in their context.” (Blank v. Kirwan (1985)
39 Cal.3d 311, 318, citations and internal quotation marks omitted.)
 
III.    
Discussion
 
A. 
    The Parties’ Arguments
 
Defendants demur to all twelve causes of
action in the FAC, arguing that these causes of action are barred by the
statute of limitations. (Demurrer, p. 9:12–27.)
 
Plaintiff disagrees, arguing: (1) that
Defendant argues inapplicable law and misunderstandings the standard on a
demurrer; and (2) that Plaintiff sufficiently pleads each cause of action
because each cause of action is within the statute of limitations. (Opposition
to the Demurrer, pp. 2:25–26, 5:1–2.)
 
In their Reply, Defendants argue: (1) that
Plaintiff plays fast and loose with his allegations; (2) that Plaintiff
misreads his own research and cites inapplicable case law; and (3) that
Plaintiff contradicts his own arguments. (Reply, pp. 3:27, 4:16, 5:13.)
 
B. 
    The Statute of Limitations at Issue
 
“If a person
against whom an action may be brought on a liability of the person, whether
arising in contract, tort, or otherwise, and whether accrued or not accrued,
dies before the expiration of the applicable limitations period, and the cause
of action survives, an action may be commenced within one year after the date
of death, and the limitations period that would have been applicable does not
apply.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 366.2, subd. (a).)
 
C. 
    Discussion
 
Defendants point to Code of Civil Procedure
section 366.2, subdivision (a) and Stoltenberg v. Newman (2009) 179
Cal.App.4th 287 as the basis for their argument that all of the causes of
action in the FAC are barred by the statute of limitations. (Demurrer, pp.
3:8–18, 8:24–9:6.)
 
The Court disagrees with this argument. 
 
According to the allegations made in the FAC,
the causes of action do not arise from action taken by Decedent Dr. Ali
Mohebbi, who passed away on or about July 31, 2021. (FAC, ¶ 15.) Rather, the causes
of action accrued in November and December 2021, after Defendant Moazaam had
already obtained control of Faro Optometry Inc. The allegations involve unpaid
wages, failures to reimburse, misrepresentations, failure to return an edging
machine, and fraudulent winding up of a business — again, all of which are
alleged to have been done by Defendant Moazaam after the death of Decedent.
(FAC, ¶¶ 15, 22–29, 32–33, 36, 40, 45–47, 50, 55, 62, 68, 71, 76–78, 81, 89,
93, 98–99, 101–102.)
 
For the purposes of a demurrer, the Court
must assume the truth of the allegations. Because Plaintiff alleges in the
pleading that the causes of action did not accrue before Decedent’s death, the
Court cannot sustain a demurrer to these allegations on the basis of Code of
Civil Procedure section 366.2, subdivision (a). Stoltenberg, which
involved statements made by a decedent before that decedent’s death, is
inapposite. (Stoltenberg, supra, 179 Cal.App.4th 287, 289.)
 
IV.     
Conclusion
 
The Demurrer to
the FAC is OVERRULED.
