And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has ruled that the demurrer to the First Amended Complaint (FAC) is overruled. The demurrer was filed by the defendants, Soraya Moazaam and Faro Optometry Inc., arguing that the causes of action in the FAC are barred by the statute of limitations. The judge disagrees with this argument, finding that the causes of action did not arise from actions taken by the decedent, Dr. Ali Mohebbi, who passed away on or about July 31, 2021. Instead, the causes of action accrued in November and December 2021, after Defendant Moazaam had already obtained control of Faro Optometry Inc. The judge also reminds counsel that they must comply with the Guidelines for Civility in Litigation and encourages them to work together to improve and enhance the rule of law.
