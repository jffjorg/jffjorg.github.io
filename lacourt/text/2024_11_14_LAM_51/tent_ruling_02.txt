The court is not persuaded by Plaintiff’s argument that Burton lacks evidence
because Burton filed a Joinder including an independent Separate Statement.

should be further noted that the undisputed evidence was that Dr.
Castenda-Panuco’s diagnosis did not factor into the treatment of decedent for three
reasons. First, decedent had already been discharged when Dr. Castenda-Panuco
had filed their report. Second, Dr. Castenda-Panuco’s  opinion had not been communicated to Dr. Yarnell,
the treating physician, until after resuscitation attempts had commenced.
Third, Dr. Yarnell declared that Dr. Castenda-Panuco’s report had no impact on  the lifesaving attempts.
