And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a case involving a plaintiff who is pursuing claims in California, but the defendants argue that Texas law should apply instead. The defendants note that Texas law provides remedies for the claims, but the plaintiff does not oppose the application of Texas law. The judge agrees that Texas law should be applied, as the defendants are all based in Texas and the plaintiff does not dispute this. However, the defendants provide no evidence to support their claims, and the judge notes that this lack of evidence is a significant omission. Overall, the judge is leaning towards applying Texas law and dismissing the plaintiff's claims, pending further evidence or development of the case.
