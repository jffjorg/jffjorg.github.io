And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on the motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. The motion is granted as to Global One Bancshares, Inc. and Global One Bank, and denied as to Jeung-Ho Park and Jay Song. The individual defendants, Jeung-Ho Park and Jay Song, are ordered to file their responsive pleading within 30 days of notice of this ruling. The judge found that the individual defendants purposefully availed themselves of California's forum by traveling to California multiple times to work on the project and communicating with the plaintiff in California. However, the judge did not find that the entity defendants purposefully availed themselves of California's forum. The judge also considered the factors of fair play and substantial justice, including the burden on the defendants, the forum State's interest in adjudicating the dispute, the plaintiff's interest in obtaining convenient and effective relief, and the interstate judicial system's interest in obtaining the most efficient resolution of controversies. The judge concluded that exercising jurisdiction over the individual defendants is fair and just, but not exercising jurisdiction over the entity defendants.
