And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Defendant Burton's motion for summary judgment. The motion was based on Burton's contention that Plaintiff Carmen Barton cannot prove that Burton's alleged failure to report a widened mediastinum was a substantial factor in causing Decedent's death. However, the judge found that Burton had not met his burden of showing that Plaintiff cannot prove causation. Additionally, the judge found that there was a disputed material fact as to whether Decedent could have received non-surgical stabilizing intervention with a correct diagnosis. The judge also noted that Burton's expert opinion, provided by Dr. Pfeiffer, was limited to Dr. Castaneda-Panuco's conduct and did not address the issue of Burton's alleged failure to report a widened mediastinum. The judge concluded that Plaintiff had met her burden to demonstrate a triable material fact and denied Burton's motion for summary judgment.
