The defendants argue that there was no final judgment until the February 27, 2024, judgment and that the collection efforts on the May 8, 2023, judgment were improper. The judge believes that the judgment may be final yet still subject to modification at a later date and that the collection efforts were proper. The judge sees no reason to further amend the judgment and denies the motion to amend the judgment.
