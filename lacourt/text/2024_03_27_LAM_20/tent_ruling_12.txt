On February 7, 2023, a jury entered verdicts in favor of Plaintiffs DONE! Ventures, LLC (“Done!”) and Coastal Laundromat, Inc. (“Coastal”), and against Defendants Jerry Jamgotchian, El Segundo Plaza Associates L.P. (“ESPA”), and Theta Holding IV, Inc. (“Theta”), for Plaintiffs’ claims for interference with contract, negligent interference with prospective economic advantage, and breach of contract.On May 8, 2023, the Court entered a “judgment” on the verdict.  On July 12, 2023, the Court ruled on a motion for new trial/JNOV, stating that the amount of punitive damages awarded by the jury was improper and that Coastal was either to stipulate to $525,000 or else the Court would grant a new trial only as to the amount of punitive damages.  Coastal stipulated to taking less punitive damages.On September 5, 2023, the Court ruled on Coastal’s motion for attorneys’ fees and prejudgment interest.  Prejudgment interest was rejected, but the Court awarded $357,673 in fees.On February 6, 2024, the Court entered a final ruling denying Defendants’ motion to tax costs with respect to Done!.  That ruling also rejected prejudgment interest for Done!.  On February 27, 2024, the Court entered an “amended judgment”, which reduced the amount of punitive damages to be obtained by Done! and indicated the amount of fees, costs, and prejudgment interest to be awarded as discussed above.  Defendants now seek to amend the February 27, 2024 judgment as follows: “(1) amend title of the Court’s February 27, 2024, judgment to read ‘Final Judgment’ and not its current incorrect and misleading title, ‘Amended Judgment,’ (2) Amend the date of the Court’s award of post-judgment interest from May 8, 2023 (date of the Court’s interim, non-final jury verdict judgment) to the date of final judgment, or February 27, 2024 (the date the Court signed final judgment in this case, erroneously entitled ‘Amended Judgment,’ as above), as the May 8, 2023 interim judgment is void and no longer has any force and effect by operation of law.”  Defendants also seek to quash  “all outstanding levies issued under the Court’s interim - and now void and unenforceable - May 8, 2023 jury verdict judgment.”  The thrust of the Motion is that there wasn’t a “final judgment” until the Court entered its February 27, 2024, judgment and, therefore, Plaintiffs’ collection efforts on the Court’s interim May 2023 “judgment” were improper.    Coastal and Done! argue that the Motion is frivolous as post-trial motions are collateral and incidental matters that do not affect the finality of the May 8, 2023, judgment. The issue seems to be whether there was a final judgment on May 8, 2023, that was later modified or whether there was never any final judgment until February 27, 2024.    Initially, the fact that fees, prejudgment interest, and costs were still at issue does not seem to detract from the finality of the May 2023 “judgment”.  Indeed,  “[m]atters such as an award of fees and costs to a prevailing party are commonly taken care of by way of separately appealable postjudgment orders.”  (Laraway v. Pasadena Unified Sch. Dist. (2002) 98 Cal.App.4th 579, 582.) Punitive damages were reduced after the Court’s hearing on a motion for new trial.  The term “final” is used in many different contexts.  There is finality in the sense of being appealable, but it’s also been said that “a judgment is not ‘final’ as long as it remains subject to direct attack by appeal, by motion for a new trial, or motion to vacate the judgment.”  (Sullivan v. Delta Air Lines, Inc. (1997) 15 Cal.4th 288, 303.) However, the Court believes here that “[a] judgment may be final . . .  yet, under a statutory or judicially recognized power, the court may modify its terms at some future date. However, unless and until the modification is sought and ordered, the judgment is as final as any other final judgment.”  (7 Witkin, Cal. Proc. 6th Judgm § 7 (2023).) Turning to the requests at hand.  The Court sees no reason to further amend the judgment.  Its title does not alter its effect, and “[t]he law does not require idle acts.”  (People v. Haskins (1985) 171 Cal.App. 3d 344, 350.)  Further, post judgment interest would accrue from the entry of the original judgment as a remittitur or the like does not apparently affect this date.  (See Ehret v. Congoleum Corp. (2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 202, 206.)   With respect to the writs of execution and levies filed by Plaintiffs, they weren’t improper to the extent a final judgment existed at the time—indeed, “a judgment is enforceable under this title upon entry.”  (Code Civ. Proc. § 683.010.)  Further, there is no reason to quash these devices because they reflect the correct amounts that are owed for punitive damages and other matters.    Thus, the Motion is denied.Moving parties to give notice.If counsel do not submit on the tentative, they are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
