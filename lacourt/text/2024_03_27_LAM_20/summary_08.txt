And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge rules that the Motions to Compel filed by the defendants are granted, allowing the depositions of the plaintiffs to take place within 30 days. The judge also sanctions defendant's counsel, Suzanne E. Rand-Lewis, $1,200 for her improper and obstructive arguments. The judge notes that Rand-Lewis has a history of making implausible excuses and violating court rules, citing several previous cases. The judge concludes that there is no reason to prevent the depositions from taking place, and that Rand-Lewis can accompany the minor plaintiff, Alexis Redmond, to the depositions instead of having the mother, Dawnielle Desensi, attend on her behalf.
