This is a habitability matter.  Defendants 3J1M LLC, Ironwood Velvet LLC, and Aperto Property Management Inc. seek to compel the depositions of Plaintiffs Dawnielle Desensi, Shyann Redmond, and Alexis Redmond.  Counsel for Plaintiffs, Suzanne E. Rand-Lewis, without citing any real authority, mainly argues that there should not be three separate days of depositions.  Her argument is that “Plaintiff Shyann Redmond is disabled, suffers from Auditory Processing Disorder, does not drive, and relies upon her mother to assist and support her. Plaintiff Alexis Redmond is a minor, 15 years old. Accordingly, Plaintiff Dawnielle DeSensi must attend both of her daughters’ depositions, and should not be forced to miss three days of work to do so.”The Court will no longer entertain Rand-Lewis’ obstructive and improper arguments.  It’s already been said that “[t]he public record reveals a troubling pattern of behavior in both federal and state courts. As another judge of this Court remarked when denying a suspect ex parte application from Ms. Rand-Lewis, her excuses were ‘at best implausible’ and ‘[a]t worst, her actions violated Rule 11.’ Nisbet v. Am. Nat'l Red Cross et al., No. 2:16-cv-7342-GW (ECF 120, 136). The California state appellate courts are no strangers to Ms. Rand-Lewis' habits either. See De La Cruz v. El Pollo Loco, Inc., 2016 WL 230572, at *4-5 (Cal. Ct. App. Jan. 19, 2016) (‘Ms. Rand-Lewis' declaration [that she was ill and bedridden] lacked key information and was contradicted by other communications’); Foss v. San Antonio Cmty. Hosp., 2015 WL 4555377, at *3-5 (Cal. Ct. App. July 28, 2015) (Ms. Rand-Lewis' declaration that she was ‘off work per doctor's orders’ lacked ‘any documentation from [her] doctor confirming the injury and off-work order’); Jangozian v. Farmers Ins. Exch., 2015 WL 3417549, at *22-24 (Cal. Ct. App. May 28, 2015) (sanctions proper against plaintiffs represented by Ms. Rand-Lewis given her ‘disregard for the trial court's orders,’ ‘repeated failures to meet and confer,’ and ‘failure, when faced with terminating sanctions, even to attempt to justify their disregard of the trial court's most recent order’); Pers. Court Reporters, Inc. v. Rand, 205 Cal. App. 4th 182, 193, 140 Cal.Rptr.3d 301 (2012) (sanctioning Ms. Rand-Lewis, her husband, and her father for filing baseless appeal ‘for the purpose of delaying this matter’). And Ms. Rand-Lewis has been disciplined before by the California State Bar for submitting a false declaration. (ECF 65 at 4-13).”  (Infanzon v. Allstate Ins. Co. (C.D. Cal. 2020) 335 F.R.D. 305, 315.)There is nothing that would preclude the depositions of the Plaintiffs; there is nothing that requires that the depositions all take place in one day; and there is nothing that requires Dawnielle DeSensi to accompany her children when Rand-Lewis can do that.  The Motions to Compel are granted.  The depositions are to take place within 30 days on dates chosen by Defendants.  Rand-Lewis, individually, is sanctioned $1,200.Moving parties to give notice.If counsel do not submit on the tentative, they are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
