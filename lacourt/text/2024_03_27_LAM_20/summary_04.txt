```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed the parties' arguments and finds that the instant claims are barred by res judicata based on the stipulated judgment entered in the unlawful detainer action. The stipulated judgment states that all causes of action that were pleaded between the parties were fully resolved, including Niño's affirmative defenses. The Court finds that the stipulated judgment is a final and binding agreement that precludes Niño from relitigating the same claims. The Court grants the motion for judgment on the pleadings and denies Plaintiff's request to reform the stipulated judgment.
