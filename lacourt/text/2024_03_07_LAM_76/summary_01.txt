And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for leave to file a supplemental complaint, which seeks to add E Room Design, Inc. as a defendant and assert successor and alter ego liability. The judge finds that the motion is procedurally improper and that the plaintiff has not demonstrated a sufficient reason for delay in seeking to add E Room Design, Inc. as a defendant. The judge notes that the plaintiff has already made a previous attempt to bring E Room Design, Inc. into the case through a Doe amendment, which was procedurally improper. The judge also finds that the plaintiff's lack of diligence in timely seeking a supplemental complaint is a significant issue. As a result, the judge has denied the motion for leave to file a supplemental complaint and has instructed the plaintiff to file a new action against E Room Design, Inc. if necessary.
