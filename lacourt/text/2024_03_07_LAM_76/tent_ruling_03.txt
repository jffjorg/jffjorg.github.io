ANALYSIS
 
Demurrer
 
Meet and Confer
 
The Declaration of Matthew E. Hess
reflects that Cross-Defendant’s counsel satisfied the meet and confer requirement
set forth in Civ. Proc. Code, § 430.41.
 
Discussion
 
            Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant
Tim Pappas demurs to the Cross-Complaint as follows:
 
1.         First Cause of action (Breach of Written
Contract).
 
            Cross-Defendant argues that the
Cross-Complaint does not attach a copy of the contract, plead the terms of the
contract in haec verba, or expressly allege the substance of the
material terms.
 
Although older case law states that “[i]f the action is based
on an alleged breach of a written contract, the terms must be set out verbatim
in the body of the complaint or a copy of the written instrument must be
attached and incorporated by reference.”  (Otworth v. Southern Pac. Transportation Co. (1985) 166 Cal. App. 3d 452,
458-459), the modern view is to permit a plaintiff to plead the legal effect of
a written contract rather than its precise language:
 
The Wise court stated, “where a written instrument is the foundation of
a cause of action, it may be pleaded in haec verba by attaching a copy as an
exhibit and incorporating it by proper reference.” (Citation omitted.) It is
readily apparent that the Otworth court read more into that statement than is
actually there. The Wise court was simply stating one available method of
pleading the contract—it was not specifying the exclusive means of pleading a
contract. The correct rule is that “a plaintiff may plead the legal effect of
the contract rather than its precise language.” (Citation omitted.) Because it
is apparent that the Otworth court misread Wise , and because, in any
event, we are bound by our Supreme Court, we decline to follow Otworth.
Accordingly, plaintiff's failure either to attach or to set out verbatim the
terms of the contract was not fatal to his breach of contract cause of action.


(Miles v.
Deutsche Bank National Trust Co. (2015) 236 Cal.App.4th 394, 402.)
 
            This argument is persuasive. ¶ 21 of
the Cross-Complaint only vague refers to written memorialization of Pappas
agreeing to purchase alterations and restorations to vehicles and vehicle parts
from Canepa Group. Although ¶¶ 8 – 12 generally allege that work was performed
and invoiced, as Cross-Defendant
argues, the unsigned invoices do not create a written contract because they are
not signed by the party to be charged—Pappas.
 
Unsigned invoices, however, cannot on
their own create a contract or add terms to a contract. “The prevailing rule is
that an invoice, standing alone, is not a contract [citations]; and a buyer is
ordinarily not bound by statements thereon which are not a part of the original
agreement.” (Citation omitted.) “After the orders were placed the seller
transmitted certain invoices on which it attempted to place certain additional
covenants into the contract. Such additions were mere self-serving declarations
on the part of the seller and were not binding on the purchasers.” (Citation
omitted.) “An invoice, as such, is no contract.” (Citation omitted.)


(C9 Ventures v. SVC-West, L.P. (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th 1483, 1501.)
 
            Thus,
although Cross-Defendant may be liable for breach of oral contract (second
cause of action) or implied contract (see discussion re: unjust enrichment
below), the Cross-Complaint does not adequately allege a breach of written
contract.
 
            The demurrer
to the first cause of action is SUSTAINED with leave to amend.
 
2.         Third Cause of Action (Unjust
Enrichment).
 
            Cross-Defendant argues that there is
no cause of action for unjust enrichment.
 
“We find “there is no cause of action in California for unjust enrichment.” (Melchior v. New Line Productions, Inc. (2003)
106 Cal.App.4th 779, 793 [131 Cal. Rptr. 2d 347].)” (Everett v. Mountains Recreation & Conservation Authority (2015)
239 Cal.App.4th 541, 553.)
 
 
“Unjust enrichment is not a cause of action, however,
or even a remedy, but rather ‘ “ ‘a general principle, underlying various legal
doctrines and remedies’ ” … . [Citation.] It is synonymous with restitution.’ ”
(McBride v. Boughton (2004) 123 Cal.App.4th 379, 387 [20 Cal. Rptr. 3d 115].)
Like the trial court, we will construe the cause of action as a quasi-contract claim
seeking restitution.
 
“[A]n action based on an implied-in-fact or
quasi-contract cannot lie where there exists between the parties a valid
express contract covering the same subject matter.” (Lance Camper Manufacturing
Corp. v. Republic Indemnity Co. (1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 194, 203 [51 Cal. Rptr.
2d 622].) However, “restitution may be awarded in lieu of breach of contract
damages when the parties had an express contract, but it was procured by fraud
or is unenforceable or ineffective for some reason.” (McBride v. Boughton,
supra, 123 Cal.App.4th at p. 388.) Thus, a party to an express contract can assert
a claim for restitution based on unjust enrichment by “alleg[ing in that cause
of action] that the express contract is void or was rescinded.” (Lance Camper
Manufacturing Corp. v. Republic Indemnity Co. supra, at p. 203.) A claim for
restitution is permitted even if the party inconsistently pleads a breach of
contract claim that alleges the existence of an enforceable agreement. (Klein
v. Chevron U.S.A., Inc. (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th 1342, 1389 [137 Cal. Rptr. 3d
293].)
 
(Rutherford Holdings, LLC v. Plaza
Del Rey (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 221, 231.)
            
            Thus, the allegation that
Pappas breached the agreement bars a claim for implied-in-fact or
quasi-contract (as an underlying theory because there is no cause of action for
unjust enrichment). (Cross-Complaint, ¶¶ 31, 32.) However, Cross-Complainant
will be given an opportunity to pled why any express contract is void or
rescinded.
            The demurrer to the third cause of
action is SUSTAINED with leave to amend.
3.         Sixth Cause of Action (Fraud).
            Cross-Defendant argues that this
cause of action is not pled with the requisite specificity.
            Moreover, Cross-Defendant argues,
the specific allegations regarding what Pappas said in July 2021, occurred
after the work had already been performed prior to July 2021.
            The
elements of a cause of action for a false promise constituting fraud or deceit
are: “(1) a promise made regarding a material fact without any intention of
performing it; (2) the existence of the intent at the time of making the
promise; (3) the promise was made with intent to deceive or with intent to
induce the party to whom it was made to enter into the transaction; (4) the
promise was relied on by the party to whom it was made; (5) the party making
the promise did not perform; (6) the party to whom the promise was made was
injured.” (Regus v. Schartkoff (1957) 156 Cal.App.2d 382, 389.)
          As stated in Service By Medallion v. Clorox Co. (1996) 44
Cal.App.4th 1807, 1816:
 
"An action for promissory fraud may lie
where a defendant fraudulently induces the plaintiff to enter into a
contract." (Lazar v. Superior Court (1996) 12 Cal. 4th 631, 638 [49 Cal.
Rptr. 2d 377, 909 P.2d 981].) The action is one of deceit, which requires proof
that the defendant made a misrepresentation of fact or a promise without any
intention of performing it. (Civ. Code, § 1710.) A complaint for fraud must
allege the following elements: (1) a knowingly false representation by the
defendant; (2) an intent to deceive or induce reliance; (3) justifiable
reliance by the plaintiff; and (4) resulting damages. (Croeni v. Goldstein
(1994) 21 Cal. Cal. App. 4th 754, 758 [26 Cal. Rptr. 2d 412].) Every element
must be specifically pleaded. (Tarmann v. State Farm  Mut. Auto. Ins. Co.
(1991) 2 Cal. Cal. App. 4th 153, 157 [2 Cal. Rptr. 2d 861].) 
 
            “Consequently,
in pleading the tort it is indispensable to set forth the falsity of the
promise at the time it was tendered. (Citation omitted.) In so differentiating
a false promise from the great bulk of broken promises, the allegations
necessary to show contemporaneous intention not to perform should be clear, specific,
and unequivocal. (Citations omitted.)” (Hills Transp. Co. v. Southwest Forest Industries, Inc. (1968) 266 Cal.App.2d 702, 708.)
 
            “The
mere failure to carry out a promise is not a tort, and it is therefore
essential, in pleading fraud consisting of a false promise, to allege the
elements of fraud.” (Maynes v.
Angeles Mesa Land Co. (1938)
10 Cal.2d 587, 589.)
 
Fraud must be pleaded with specificity rather than with “ ‘general and
conclusory allegations.’ ” (Small v. Fritz Companies, Inc. (2003) 30 Cal.4th
167, 184 [132 Cal. Rptr. 2d 490, 65 P.3d 1255].)  The specificity
requirement means a plaintiff must allege facts showing how, when, where, to
whom, and by what means the representations were made, and, in the case of a
corporate defendant, the plaintiff must allege the names of the persons who
made the representations, their authority to speak on behalf of the corporation,
to whom they spoke, what they said or wrote, and when the representation was
made. (Lazar v. Superior Court, supra, 12 Cal.4th at p. 645.)
 
We enforce the specificity requirement in consideration of its two
purposes. The first purpose is to give notice to the defendant with
sufficiently definite charges that the defendant can meet them. (Committee on
Children's Television, Inc. v. General Foods Corp. (1983) 35 Cal.3d 197, 216
[197 Cal. Rptr. 783, 673 P.2d 660].) The second is to permit a court to weed
out meritless fraud claims on the basis of the pleadings; thus, “the pleading
should be sufficient ‘ “to enable the court to determine whether, on the facts
pleaded, there is any foundation, prima facie at least, for the charge of
fraud.” ’ ” (Id. at pp. 216–217.)
(West v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.
(2013) 214 Cal.App.4th 780, 793.) 
Here, the Cross-Complaint alleges in general terms that Pappas agreed to timely
pay for all work invoiced by Canepa Group. (Cross-Complaint, ¶ 47). The Cross-Complaint
does not allege exactly what Pappas said, when and in what matter (orally or in
writing), and why such representation was known to be false when made.
Moreover, the Cross-Complaint does not allege that such representations were
made before Cross-Complainant performed services. 
The allegation that Pappas misrepresented his intention on July 14, 2021 to
have Canepa Group perform future work in order to obtain possession of the Porsche
to have a third party perform interim mechanical work could constitute actionable
fraud, but it is not pled with sufficient specificity, as the exact misrepresentation
is not specifically pled. (Cross-Complaint, ¶¶ 48, 49, 50.) The amount of out-of-pocket
damages to Cross-Complainant would be the amount of parts of labor which
Cross-Complainant provided to Pappas’ 1995 Porsche, of which Cross-Complainant
allowed Pappas to take possession in expectation the vehicle would be returned
to Canepa Group’s possession.
            The demurrer to the sixth cause of
action is SUSTAINED with leave to amend.
4.         Seventh Cause of Action (Receipt of
Stolen Property).
            Cross-Defendant
argues that this is a garden-variety civil dispute which does not violate Penal
Code, § 496. First, the 1995 Porshe was Pappas’ own car, not the property of
another. Second, the fraud claim fails, so the property was not obtained by defrauding
Canepa Group.
            Penal
Code § 496
provides in pertinent part:
(a) Every person who buys or receives any property that has
been stolen or that has been obtained in any manner constituting theft or
extortion, knowing the property to be so stolen or obtained, or who
conceals, sells, withholds, or aids in concealing, selling, or withholding any
property from the owner, knowing the property to be so stolen or obtained,
shall be punished by imprisonment in a county jail for not more than one year,
or imprisonment pursuant to subdivision (h) of Section 1170. However, if the value
of the property does not exceed nine hundred fifty dollars ($950), the offense
shall be a misdemeanor, punishable only by imprisonment in a county jail not
exceeding one year, if such person has no prior convictions for an offense
specified in clause (iv) of subparagraph (C) of paragraph (2) of subdivision
(e) of Section 667 or for an offense requiring registration pursuant to
subdivision (c) of Section 290.
 
 A principal in the actual theft of the property may be convicted
pursuant to this section. However, no person may be convicted both pursuant to
this section and of the theft of the same property.
 
. . .
 
(c) Any person who has been injured by a violation of subdivision
(a) or (b) may bring an action for three times the amount of actual damages, if
any, sustained by the plaintiff, costs of suit, and reasonable attorney's fees.
 
            The Court
finds to be persuasive Cross-Defendant’s argument that he cannot violate Penal
Code, § 496 for taking his own property. At most, he took his own property
subject to a mechanic’s lien, but this does not violate § 496. However, Cross-Defendant
can violate § 496 by obtaining labor by false or fraudulent representation,
which constitutes theft.
            Penal Code,
§ 484(a) defines theft as follows:
(a) Every person who shall
feloniously steal, take, carry, lead, or drive away the personal property of
another, or who shall fraudulently appropriate property which has been
entrusted to him or her, or who shall knowingly and designedly, by any false
or fraudulent representation or pretense, defraud any other person of money,
labor or real or personal property, . . ., is guilty of theft. . . . For
the purposes of this section, any false or fraudulent representation or
pretense made shall be treated as continuing, so as to cover any money,
property or service received as a result thereof, and the complaint,
information or indictment may charge that the crime was committed on any date
during the particular period in question. The hiring of any additional employee
or employees without advising each of them of every labor claim due and unpaid
and every judgment that the employer has been unable to meet shall be prima
facie evidence of intent to defraud.

     (Pen.
Code § 484(a)[bold emphasis added].)
            As discussed above, Cross-Complainant
will be given an opportunity to sufficiently plead fraud upon which Cross-Complainant
relied in performing services.
            The
demurrer to the seventh cause of action is SUSTAINED with leave to
amend.
Motion To Strike
Meet and Confer
The Declaration of Matthew E. Hess
reflects that Cross-Defendant’s counsel satisfied the meet and confer requirement
set forth in Civ. Proc. Code, § 435.5.
Discussion
Cross-Defendant Tim Pappas moves to
strike the following portions of the Cross-Complaint as barred by the two-year
statute of limitations for breach of oral agreements entered into prior to
April 11, 2020 (the date on which the Complaint was filed, as to which the
filing of the Cross-Complaint would relate back because based on the same series
of transactions—Luna Records
Corp. v. Alvarado (1991) 232 Cal.App.3d 1023, 1028.)
¿        ¶ 8 – “Beginning on or about June of
2017…” - DENIED
 
¶ 8 alleges that the cost of work which
began in June 20167 was finished in April 2022, with a final progress invoice
date of May 1, 2022. As such, it is a question of fact as to whether this claim
for breach did not accrue until that date because Plaintiff could not refuse to
pay the invoice until it was issued.
 
“Resolution of the statute of limitations issue is normally a question
of fact.” (Fox, supra, 35 Cal.4th at p. 810.) More specifically, as to accrual,
“once properly pleaded, belated discovery is a question of fact.” (Bastian v.
County of San Luis Obispo, supra, 199 Cal. App. 3d at p. 527.)  As our
state's high court has observed: “There are no hard and fast rules for
determining what facts or circumstances will compel inquiry by the injured
party and render him chargeable with knowledge. [Citation.] It is a question
for the trier of fact.” (United States Liab. Ins. Co. v. Haidinger-Hayes, Inc.,
supra, 1 Cal.3d at p. 597 [reversing judgment after demurrer].) “However,
whenever reasonable minds can draw only one conclusion from the evidence, the
question becomes one of law.” (Snow v. A. H. Robins Co. (1985) 165 Cal. App. 3d
120, 128 [211 Cal. Rptr. 271] [reversing summary judgment].) Thus, when an
appeal is taken from a judgment of dismissal following the sustention of a
demurrer, “the issue is whether the trial court could determine as a matter of
law that failure to discover was due to failure to investigate or to act
without diligence.” (Bastian v. County of San Luis Obispo, at p. 527.)
(E-Fab,
Inc. v. Accountants, Inc. Services (2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 1308, 1320.)   
¿        ¶ 9 – “Beginning on or about June of
2018…” - DENIED
 
¶ 9 alleges that the work which began
in December 2017 was completed in February 2020, with a final invoice date of
March 22, 2021. As such, it is a question of fact as to whether this claim for
breach did not accrue until that date because Plaintiff could not refuse to pay
the invoice until it was issued.
¿        ¶ 10 – “On or about October of 2018….” -
DENIED
            ¶ 10
alleges that the work which began in October 2018 was completed in August of
2021, with a final invoice date of September 21, 2021. As such, it is a question
of fact as to whether this claim for breach did not accrue until that date because
Plaintiff could not refuse to pay the invoice until it was issued.

¿        ¶ 14 – 
“Beyond the goods and service described above, during the time period of
June 2017 through…”  - GRANTED with
leave to amend.
 
As to goods and services purchased from
June 2017 for other vehicles and vehicle parts, to the extent Pappas did not
pay for these when provided, it would depend upon whether the purchase was done
pursuant to written contract or orally, Cross-Complainant must specifically
allege each purchase in this regard.
 
¿        The following invoices attached at
Exhibit A to the Cross-Complaint: Nos. 36102 (3/12/18, $164,595.34), 36293
(6/21/18, $107,775.63), 38539 (2/27/00 $169,030.69) and 41079 (9/10/19,
$11,675.29) – GRANTED with leave to amend.
            As
discussed above re: the demurrer, unsigned invoices do not themselves
constitute written contracts and, at most, memorialize oral or implied-in-fact
contracts, which are subject to the two-year statute of limitations set forth in
Civ. Proc. Code, § 339(1)(action upon a contract, obligation or liability not
founded upon an instrument of writing). As such, the amounts reflected in the
above invoices are time-barred, as pled.          
            Cross-Complainant
is given 30 days’ leave to amend where indicated.
