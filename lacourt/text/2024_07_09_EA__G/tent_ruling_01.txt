  Case Number:  24PSCV00472    Hearing Date:   July 9, 2024    Dept:  G Plaintiff Gershman Properties, LLC’s Application for
Default Judgment
Respondent: NO OPPOSITION
TENTATIVE RULING
Plaintiff Gershman Properties, LLC’s Application for
Default Judgment is GRANTED in the
reduced amount of $43,403.67.
BACKGROUND
This
is an unlawful detainer action. In February 2023, Plaintiff Gershman
Properties, LLC (Gershman) entered into a written lease agreement with Defendant
CH Glendora, LLC (CH Glendora) in which Gershman agreed to lease commercial
property in Glendora to CH Glendora. Subsequently, Gershman alleges CH Glendora
breached the lease agreement by failing to pay rent. On January 24, 2024,
Gershman served a three day notice to pay rent or quit on CH Glendora. CH
Glendora subsequently failed to pay rent or vacate the Glendora property.
On February
7, 2024, Gershman filed a complaint against CH Glendora and Does 1-30, alleging
a cause of action for unlawful detainer. On March 1, 2024, Gershman’s process
server served CH Glendora by posting notice at the Glendora property.
On March
19, 2024, the Court entered default against CH Glendora after CH Glendora
failed to file a timely answer.
On
March 25, 2024, the Court granted a default judgment for Gershman on the issue
of possession only.
On May
17, 2024, Gershman submitted the present application for default judgment.
A case
management conference is set for July 9, 2024.
LEGAL STANDARD
Code
of Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a
party has filed to timely respond or appear.  A party seeking judgment on
the default by the court must file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a
brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in
support of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4)
a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a proposed form of judgment; (6) a
dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application
for separate judgment under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of grounds for
each judgment; (7) exhibits as necessary; and (8) a request for attorneys’ fees
if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.  (Cal. Rules of
Court 3.1800.)
ANALYSIS
Gershman
seeks default judgment against CH Glendora in the total amount of $43,403.68,
including $40,476.72 in damages, $1,604.31 in attorney fees, and $1,322.65 in
costs. Because the Court finds Gershman has submitted sufficient evidence, the Court
GRANTS Gershman’s application for default judgment with the following
modification. While Gershman requests $1,604.31 in attorney fees, the correct
calculation of attorney fees pursuant to Local Rule 3.214 is $1,604.30.
Accordingly, the total requested damages will be reduced to $43,403.67.
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, Gershman’s
application for default judgment is GRANTED in the reduced amount of $43,403.67.
