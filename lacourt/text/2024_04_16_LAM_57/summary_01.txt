And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling denies the motion of Defendant/Cross-Complainant Approved Plans, Inc. to compel Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant David Darwash to appear at his deposition and produce requested documents. The court finds that Darwash has not yet failed to appear at his deposition, making the motion to compel him to appear premature. Additionally, Approved Plans failed to show good cause for the production of the requested documents and did not submit a separate statement in support of the motion as required by the California Rules of Court. The court also cautions counsel for Approved Plans about citing non-precedential California Superior Court decisions in their reply brief.
