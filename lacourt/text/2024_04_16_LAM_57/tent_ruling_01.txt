  Case Number:  22STCV18797    Hearing Date:   April 16, 2024    Dept:  57 Pending before the Court is the motion of Defendant/Cross-Complainant Approved Plans, Inc. ('Approved Plans") to compel the Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant David Darwash to(1)  appear and testify at his deposition, and (2) produce documents that Approved Plans requested in the notice of Darwash's deposition ---  a request to which Darwash objected.  The Court is denying Approved Plans's motion.  Darwash has not yet failed to appear at his deposition.  Thus, the motion to compel him to appear is premature.  Approved Plans has failed in the motion to show good cause for the production of the documents that it is requesting.  Nor did Approved Plans submit a separate statement in support of the motion, as required by the California Rules of Court.The Court cautions counsel for Approved Plans about the many citations to  California Superior Court decisions in the reply brief in support of the motion.  Such decisions are not precedent and must not be cited.
