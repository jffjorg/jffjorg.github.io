Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in a motion for assignment order and related restraining order. The motion was filed by Hamid Reza Mirshojae, the judgment creditor, seeking an order assigning to him any and all interest of Ross Reghabi dba Southern California Law Group, the judgment debtor, in the judgment against Fereshteh Nasseh in LASC Case No. PC57770 ("Nasseh Judgment") and all rights to payment thereunder, including accrued interest through the date of payment. The motion also requests an order restraining Reghabi and any others from assigning, encumbering, or modifying Reghabi's rights to payment under the Nasseh Judgment.

The Judge notes that CCP 708.510 provides that the court may order a judgment debtor to assign to the judgment creditor all or part of a right to payment due or to become due, and that the court may consider relevant factors in determining the assignment or restraint. The Judge also notes that CCP 708.510(d) provides that a right to payment may be assigned to a judgment creditor "only to the extent necessary to satisfy the money judgment."

The Judge rules that the hearing on the motion will be continued to allow for proper service of the motion in compliance with CCP 708.510(b), which requires that the motion be served on the judgment debtor personally or by mail. The Judge notes that the proof of service indicates that the motion and supporting documents were served by e-service on attorney Behrouz Shafie of Behrouz Shafie & Associates on behalf of Reghabi, which does not comply with the requirements of CCP 708.510(b).
