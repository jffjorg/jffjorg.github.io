And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by the judge regarding a summary judgment motion filed by Kmadn Capital Management, LLC (Plaintiff) against Gidy Akin and Sharon Sharabi (Defendants) on August 25, 2023. The Plaintiff seeks an order granting summary judgment in its favor and against the Defendants, alleging that the Defendants breached their residential lease agreement and failed to pay their monthly rent of $3,500.00. The Plaintiff claims that it is entitled to $17,500.00 in damages.

The Judge denies the motion, finding that the Plaintiff fails to explain why its claim for damages is not barred by the stipulation and judgment in the prior unlawful detainer action. The Judge also finds that a triable issue of fact exists as to whether the Plaintiff incurred $3,500.00 in cleanup and repair costs, and that the Plaintiff's claim is not supported by sufficient evidence.
