Case #23CHCV01534
 
MINOR’S
COMPROMISE
 
Petition filed on 10/24/23.
 
MINOR: Plaintiff Nathan J. Bravo
GAL: Mario Bravo-Palacios (parent)
DEFENDANTS: Helena Don Miner; Ivonne Miner; Richard Allen
Veon; Rick Veon; Rubik Barseghyan; Hayk Bablumyan; Yossi Dayan; Karen Manukyan
and Temptechs dba Temptechs, Inc.
 
RULING: The petition is denied without
prejudice.  
 
This action arises out of a motor vehicle collision that
occurred on 5/16/22.  Minor Plaintiff
Nathan J. Bravo (Minor) was a passenger in a rear-ended vehicle driven by
Plaintiff Mario Bravo-Palacios.  Minor
suffered from pain to the neck, back, chest and both knees.  Minor underwent chiropractic care and had
MRIs taken.  The petition indicates that
the Minor has completely recovered from his injuries.  
 
On 5/25/23, Plaintiffs filed this action against Helena
Don Miner; Ivonne Miner; Richard Allen Veon; Rick Veon; Rubik Barseghyan; Hayk
Bablumyan; Yossi Dayan; Karen Manukyan and Temptechs dba Temptechs, Inc.  On 9/26/23, Helena Don Miner and Ivonne Miner
answered the complaint.  On 10/2/23,
Defendant Richard Allen Veon answered the complaint and filed a cross-complaint
against the other named defendants.    
 
On 10/4/23, an expedited petition to approve minor’s
compromise was filed seeking approval of the compromise of Minor’s claim as
against Defendants Helena Don Miner and 
Ivonne Miner, only, for $6,500.00. 
The proof of service attached to the expedited petition shows that it
was served only on counsel for the settling defendants, Helena Don Miner and
Ivonne Miner.  
 
Since Defendant Richard Allen
Veon (the only other defendant who has appeared in the action at this time)
is not participating in the compromise/settlement and this Court has not
finally determined that the settling parties entered into the settlement in
good faith, the petition did not qualify for expedited approval.  See CRC 7.950.5(a)(7)(A), (B).  Based on the expedited petition, it also was not
clear that there are no unresolved disputes concerning liens to be satisfied
from the proceeds of the compromise as is required for expedited approval.  See CRC 7.950.5(a)(4).  
Additionally, Attachment 18a in the expedited petition did
not correspond to number 18.a. in the petition and the Attorney Fee Agreement
should have been part of Attachment 14a. 
There was also no Attachment 19b(2) as required.
 
Based on the foregoing, the Court set a hearing on the
petition for 11/15/23 because it intended to deny same without prejudice.  (See 10/9/23 Minute Order); CRC 7.950(c)(3).  
 
In response to the Court’s 10/9/23 order, on 10/24/23, a new
petition (not expedited) for approval of minor’s compromise (new petition) was
filed and served.
 
The service of the new petition by electronic mail is
defective.  Such service for the 11/15/23
hearing date does not provide the 16 court days plus 2 court days’ notice
required for electronic service.  See
CCP 1005(b); CCP 1010.6(a)(3)(B). 
Additionally, the email address where counsel for Defendant/Cross-Complainant
Richard Allen Veon was served (marshall.coyle@kemper.com)
does not match the email address on record for his counsel (mcoyle@md-llp.com) in eCourt.
 
In addition to the foregoing, the new petition suffers
from the following defects: 
 
(1) The petition indicates that the Minor has completely
recovered from his injuries. 
(No.8.a.).  However, the medical
report dated 3/21/22 attached to the petition indicates that Minor “can expect
to suffer flare-ups and exacerbations of his pain in the future.  Therefore, it is recommended that provision
be made for future medical care, as needed. 
The cost of the future conservative care may range between $1200.00 and
$1500.00 per year.”  (See
Attachment 8, pdf p.19).  The next report
is dated 3/29/22 and does not indicate the Minor has completely recovered.  No other medical reports are provided.    
 
(2) The medical expenses do not make sense.  The petition indicates that the total medical
expenses before any reductions are $3,268.00; none of the expenses have been
paid, there has been a total reduction of $718.00; total medical expenses to be
paid from the settlement are $2,550.00 and there is a lien of $2,550.00.  (See Petition, No.12.a.(1)-(5)).  However, elsewhere in the petition, it is
indicated that only $1,650.00 will be paid from the settlement for medical
expenses.  (See No.12.b.(5),
No.16.b.).
 
(3) No.17.e. indicates that the attorney is not
representing any other party.  However,
the attorney also represents the Minor’s father and co-plaintiff.  (See No.17.f.).
 
(4) The name of the client in the retainer agreement is
blank, the signature is illegible and there is no reference to the Minor.  (See Attachment 17a, pdf pp.30, 35).
