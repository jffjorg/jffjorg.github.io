SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of Defendants Gidy Akin and Sharon
Sharabi’s (“Defendants”) alleged breach of a residential lease with Plaintiff
Kmadn Capital Management LLC (“Plaintiff”). 

 
Plaintiff is the owner of the property commonly known as
10112 Hanna Avenue, Chatsworth, California 91311 (the “Property”).  (Separate Statement (SS) 1).   On or
about July 7, 2021, Plaintiff entered into a residential lease agreement with
Defendants for a period of one (1) year (the “Lease”).  (SS 3).  Pursuant to Section 3(A) of the Lease,
Defendants’ rent obligation was $3,500.00 per month.  (SS 4).  The Lease commenced on July 7, 2021 and ended
on June 30, 2022, after which the lease converted into a month-to-month
tenancy.  (SS 5).  
 
On August 10, 2022, Plaintiff caused to be served on
Defendants a written notice in compliance with California Code of Civil
Procedure 1946.1 et seq., requiring and demanding that Defendants quit and
deliver possession of the premises within sixty (60) days.  (SS 13).  After the sixty days elapsed, Defendants held
over and continued in possession of the premises.  (SS 14).  As a result, in or around October 2022,
Plaintiff filed an unlawful detainer complaint against Defendants. (SS 14).  On January 11, 2023, Plaintiff and Defendants
entered into an unlawful detainer stipulation and judgment, in which Defendants
agreed to forfeit all of their rights under the Lease  and Plaintiff was awarded possession of the Property.
 (SS 15). Pursuant to the stipulation and
judgment, Defendants were required to vacate the Property by January 31, 2023,
removing all persons and personal property, leaving all keys and remotes with
Plaintiff or Plaintiff’s agent, and leaving the premises in a broom-clean
condition.  (SS 16). 
 
On January 20, 2023, Plaintiff filed this action against
Defendants for Breach of Contract seeking $17,500.00 in rental damages, among
other things. (SS 17-18).  On February
24, 2023, Defendants, representing themselves, filed an answer to the
complaint.
 
On August 25, 2023, Plaintiff filed and served the
instant motion seeking an order granting summary judgment in favor of Plaintiff
and against Defendants.  Defendants have
not opposed or otherwise responded to the motion.  
 
ANALYSIS
 
Plaintiff contends that it is entitled to judgment in its
favor and against Defendants because Defendants failed to pay their monthly
rental obligation of $3,500.00 to Plaintiff from September 1, 2022 to January
31, 2023, in the total amount of $17,500.00. 
(Wazana Decl. ¶4).  Plaintiff
further contends that Defendants failed to leave the Property in broom-clean
condition upon vacating the Property on January 31, 2023 as required under the
Lease  (Wazana Decl. ¶5, Ex.C).  Plaintiff contends that it was forced to pay
$3,500.00 in cleanup and repair costs for which Plaintiff kept Defendants’
$3,500.00 security deposit leaving total damages of $17,500.00.  (Wazana Decl.¶¶4-6, Ex.C).
 
Res judicata precludes a party from again litigating any
claim or defense that has been or could have been litigated in a prior
adversary hearing.  Full and fair
litigation of a claim or defense will result in a conclusive judgment on issues
material to that claim or defense and matters directly related thereto cannot
be adjudicated a second time in a subsequent action.  See Vella (1977) 20 C3d 251,
256-257; DKN Holdings LLC (2015) 61 C4th 813, 824.
 
In unlawful detainer actions where rent is due monthly, a
right of action accrues upon each installment when it becomes due.  However, landlords suing for accrued rent
have only one cause of action for all rent due and owing at the time the
complaint is filed.  A separate or
subsequent action to recover past-due rent that could have been recovered in
the first action is barred by the rule against splitting causes of action (res
judicata).  Lekse (1982) 138 CA3d
188, 194.
 
Here, the Unlawful Detainer Stipulation and Judgment
entered on January 1, 2023 between the Plaintiff and Defendants in the prior
unlawful detainer action provides that Plaintiff is awarded $0 for past due
rent and holdover damages.  (See
Wazana Decl., Ex.F).  The $17,500.00 in
damages sought in this action is for rent for the period of September 1, 2022
to January 31, 2023.  Plaintiff fails to
explain why its claim for damages in this action is not barred by the
stipulation and judgment in the unlawful detainer action, particularly when
considered with Defendants’ answer which states: 
 
“We were told to vacate by end of
January by plaintiff attorney for eviction and we will not owe any past rent or
fees of any kind.
 
We agreed to give up rights so no
one owes anything after Jan 31st upon us leaving.”
 
(See Answer filed 2/24/23).   
 
Plaintiff also fails to explain how it was aware that it
would incur $3,500.00 in cleanup and repair costs on January 20, 2023, when
this action was filed, when Defendants had until January 31, 2023 to vacate the
Property and leave it in broom clean condition. 
(See Complaint ¶8; Wazana Decl. ¶¶5, 9, Ex.C, F).  Even if the Property was left in the
condition set forth in the photos attached to the Wazana declaration, a triable
issue of fact exists as to whether $3,500.00 in cleanup and repair costs were
actually incurred.  Plaintiff merely
provides photos and notes without any other supporting documentation (i.e.,
estimates, receipts, cancelled checks). 
(Wazana Decl. ¶5, Ex.C).
 
Based on the foregoing, triable issues of material fact
exist as to whether Plaintiff’s claim for past due rental damages is barred by
the doctrine of res judicata and/or whether Plaintiff was entitled to apply
Defendants’ $3,500.00 security deposit to claimed cleanup and repair costs
rather than past due rent.  
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion is denied.
