As of August 13, 2024, Plaintiff’s fee motion remains

LEGAL STANDARD: 
 
A prevailing party is entitled to recover costs as a matter
of right.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd. (a)(4).) Attorney’s fees may be
recovered as costs when authorized by contract, statute, or law. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (a)(10).)  
 
“A notice of motion
to claim attorney's fees for services up to and including the rendition of
judgment in the trial court . . . must be served and filed within the time for
filing a notice of appeal under . . . rules 8.822 and 8.823 in a limited civil
case.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1702, subd. (b)(1).) In a limited civil
case, a notice of appeal must be filed on or before the earliest of 30 days
after service of a document entitled “Notice of Entry” of judgment or 90 days
after the entry of judgment. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.822, subd.
(a)(1).) 
 
The fee setting
inquiry in California ordinarily begins with the “lodestar” method, i.e., the
number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly
rate.  A computation of time spent on a case and the reasonable value of
that time is fundamental to a determination of an appropriate attorneys’ fee
award.  The lodestar figure may then be adjusted, based on factors
specific to the case, in order to fix the fee at the fair market value for the
legal services provided.  (Serrano
v. Priest (1977) 20 Cal.3d 25, 49.)  Such an approach anchors the
trial court’s analysis to an objective determination of the value of the
attorney’s services, ensuring that the amount awarded is not arbitrary.  (Id., at p. 48, fn. 23.)  After the
trial court has performed the lodestar calculations, it shall consider whether
the total award so calculated under all of the circumstances of the case is
more than a reasonable amount and, if so, shall reduce the section 1717 award
so that it is a reasonable figure.  (PLCM
Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095-1096.) 
 
As explained in Graciano v. Robinson Ford Sales, Inc.
(2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 140, 154: 
 
“[T]he lodestar
is the basic fee for comparable legal services in the community; it may be
adjusted by the court based on factors including, as relevant herein, (1) the
novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in
presenting them, (3) the extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded
other employment by the attorneys, (4) the contingent nature of the fee award.
[Citation.] The purpose of such adjustment is to fix a fee at the fair market
value for the particular action. In effect, the court determines,
retrospectively, whether the litigation involved a contingent risk or required
extraordinary legal skill justifying augmentation of the unadorned lodestar in
order to approximate the fair market rate for such services. . . . This
approach anchors the trial court's analysis to an objective determination of
the value of the attorney's services, ensuring that the amount awarded is not
arbitrary.” [Internal citations and internal quotation marks omitted.] 
 
(Graciano v. Robinson Ford Sales, Inc.
(2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 140.) “It is well-established that the determination of
what constitutes reasonable attorney fees is committed to the discretion of the
trial court, whose decision cannot be reversed in the absence of an abuse of
discretion. [Citations.]  The value of legal services performed in a case
is a matter in which the trial court has its own expertise. . . . The trial
court makes its determination after consideration of a number of factors,
including the nature of the litigation, its difficulty, the amount involved,
the skill required in its handling, the skill employed, the attention given,
the success or failure, and other circumstances in the case. 
[Citations.]”  (Melnyk v. Robledo
(1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 618, 623624.)   
 
No specific
findings reflecting the court’s calculations are required.  The record
need only show that the attorney fees were awarded according to the “lodestar”
or “touchstone” approach.  The court’s focus in evaluating the facts
should be to provide a fee award reasonably designed to completely compensate
attorneys for the services provided.  The starting point for this
determination is the attorney’s time records. (Horsford v. Board of Trustees of Calif. State Univ. (2005)
132 Cal.App.4th 359, 395-397 [verified time records entitled to credence absent
clear indication they are erroneous].)  However, California case law
permits fee awards in the absence of detailed timesheets. (Sommers v. Erb (1992) 2
Cal.App.4th 1644, 1651; Dunk v. Ford
Motor Co. (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 1794, 1810; Nightingale v. Hyundai Motor America (1994) 31 Cal.App.4th 99,
103.)  An experienced trial judge is in a position to assess the value of
the professional services rendered in his or her court.  (Id.; Serrano
v. Priest (1977) 20 Cal.3d 25, 49; Wershba
v. Apple Computer, Inc. (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 224, 255.) 
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
Plaintiff contends that he is entitled to his costs as the
prevailing party and that the court may award attorneys’ fees pursuant to Cal.
Corp. Code § 6337 and § 1021.5. Plaintiff further contends that the court need
not apportion the attorneys’ fees because they are inextricably intertwined
with each cause of action and all recoverable.  
 
Cal. Corp. Code § 6337 states in pertinent part: 
“In any action or proceeding under
this article . . . if the court finds that failure of the corporation to comply
with a proper demand thereunder was without justification, the court may award
the member reasonable costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees,
in connection with such action or proceeding.” 
 
A prevailing party may recover attorney fees under CCP §
1021.5. (Choi v. Orange County Great Park
Corp. (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 524 (Choi).)
CCP § 1021.5 provides:
“Upon motion, a court may award
attorneys’ fees to a successful party against one or more opposing parties in
any action which has resulted in the enforcement of an important right
affecting the public interest if:
(a)  
a significant benefit, whether pecuniary
or nonpecuniary, has been conferred on the general public or a large class of
persons,
(b)  
the necessity and financial burden of
private enforcement, or of enforcement by one public entity against another
public entity, are such as to make the award appropriate, and
(c)  
such fees should not in the interest of
justice be paid out of the recovery, if any.”
The Court presided over the bench trial where Plaintiff was
the prevailing party. The Court finds that attorney fees are warranted under
both theories. First, TAM’s refusal to comply with Plaintiff’s inspection demands
was without justification. At the time, Plaintiff was a member of the board. As
such, his request for inspection was appropriate. Moreover the refusal of TAM
to comply with the request was unjustified. Second, TAM had a significant
presence in the greater Compton area. They garnered national attention for providing
education and mentoring to at risk youth in an underserviced community. This
national exposure led to tremendous national fundraising and donations of
goods. Plaintiff’s lawsuit revealed significant financial malfeasance by the
Executive Director, Robin Petgrave, that undermined the mission of TAM and
caused significant pecuniary and non- pecuniary damage to TAM and the community
it sought to serve. In fact, TAM was in danger of becoming insolvent if not for
this lawsuit. As such, it cannot be reasonably disputed that the public received
a significant benefit due to Plaintiff’s initiation of this action. 
 
Reasonableness
of Hourly Rate
 
Plaintiff contends that the rates
requested for this matter are reasonable. “In determining hourly rates, the
court must look to the “prevailing market rates in the relevant community.” (Bell v. Clackamas County (9th
Cir.2003) 341 F.3d 858, 868.) The rates of comparable attorneys in the forum
district are usually used. (See Gates
v. Deukmejian (9th Cir.1992) 987 F.2d 1392, 1405.) In making its
calculation, the court should also consider the experience, skill, and
reputation of the attorney requesting fees.” (Heritage Pacific Financial, LLC v. Monroy (2013) 215
Cal.App.4th 972, 1009.) Here, the rates for the various attorneys and a paralegal
range from $150 to $450. (7/18/24 amended. Dec. Sanders at ¶5-6.) These rates
are reasonable based on this court’s knowledge and experience of similar work
performed in the Los Angeles area. 
 
Thus, the court finds
that these requested hourly rates are reasonable. 
 
Reasonableness of Hours Billed 
 
Plaintiff have
provided verified billing invoices, attached to the July 18, 2024 Amended Declaration
of Justin Sanders. A verified fee bill is “prima facie evidence the costs,
expenses and services listed were necessarily incurred, and when they are
properly challenged the burden of proof shifts to the party claiming them as
costs.” (Hadley v. Krepel (1985) 167
Cal.App.3d 677, 682.) Still, the Court is the ultimate arbiter in deciding
whether expenses are reasonable. A review of the billings indicates that the
requested fees are appropriate. Plaintiffs have provided detailed invoices
demonstrating the various tasks over the almost five years the matter took to
litigate.
 
The
provided billings are proper and reasonable
 
Costs 
 
Plaintiff seeks $26,976.89 in
costs. These include filing and motion fees, jury fees, depositions costs,
service of process, witness fees, court reporter fees, electronic filing or
service fees, costs for milage and parking for trial.
 
            The
Court finds that the requested costs are appropriate.
 
CONCLUSION:
 
            For
the foregoing reasons, the Court decides the pending motion as follows: 
 
Motion for Attorneys’ Fees and Costs is GRANTED in the
amount of $155,967.55 in Attorneys’ Fees and $26,976.89 in Costs payable within
30 days.
 
Moving party is to give notice. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
