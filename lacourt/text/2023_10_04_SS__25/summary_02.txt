And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by the Judge in the case of Carlos Garnett vs. Lauren Alicia Brazile and Paula Beauchamp-Brazile. The case involves a motor vehicle and general negligence lawsuit filed by Garnett against Brazile and Beauchamp-Brazile in 2020. On August 15, 2023, Brazile and Beauchamp-Brazile filed a motion for terminating sanctions against Garnett, alleging that he had failed to comply with court orders and discovery requests. The motion was not opposed by Garnett.

The Judge has granted the motion and dismissed the case with prejudice. The Judge has also granted Brazile and Beauchamp-Brazile's request for monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,760.00, which includes $1,260.00 for attorney fees and costs and $250.00 for each defendant. Garnett and his counsel, Yoon S. Kim of THE BARNES FIRM, L.C., are ordered to pay the sanctions within 30 days of the date of the order. The Judge notes that Brazile and Beauchamp-Brazile's motion was granted because Garnett failed to comply with court orders and failed to serve verified responses to discovery requests, and that Garnett appears to have abandoned the case.
