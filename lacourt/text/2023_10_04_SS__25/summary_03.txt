## English Summary:

The Judge ruled in favor of Alonso Jauregui, vacating the default judgment entered against him.  The ruling stemmed from the Defendant's attorney's office (MDZ) admitting to mistakes and neglect in handling the case. Due to a large staff turnover, MDZ failed to properly respond to the lawsuit filed against Jauregui, leading to a default judgment. 

The Judge acknowledged that these errors constituted a valid reason to set aside the default judgment, and reset the trial for June 4, 2024.

And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Court has granted Defendant Alonso Jauregui's Motion to Vacate Entry of Default Judgment. The Motion was filed on September 5, 2023, and was granted on October 4, 2023.

The Court found that Defendant's attorney, Gary C. Harvey, made a mistake and neglected to monitor the Court docket and contact Defendant, resulting in default judgment being entered against Defendant. The Court also found that Defendant was not served with the Complaint and did not have notice of the lawsuit.

The Court noted that Plaintiff Anne Lee's Opposition to the Motion was that Defendant's own failure to act caused the default judgment. However, the Court found that Defendant was not responsible for the default judgment, and that MDZ's mistake and neglect caused the default judgment.

As a result, the Court granted Defendant's Motion to Vacate Entry of Default Judgment and set aside the default judgment. The Court also reset the trial date to June 4, 2024, and ordered the parties to comply with the trial requirements as set forth in the court's Third Amended Standing Order for Limited Civil Cases.
