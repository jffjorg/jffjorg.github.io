And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the Defendant's Motion to Set Aside Default Judgment. The Defendant, Alonso Jauregui, was served with a Summons and Complaint in 2021, but failed to respond, resulting in a default judgment being entered against him in 2023. The Defendant claims that his attorney, Gary C. Harvey, and the law firm Martinez, Dieterich & Zarcone Legal Group (MDZ) made mistakes and neglected to follow up with him, leading to the default judgment. The Plaintiff, Anne Lee, argues that the Defendant's own failure to act was the cause of the default judgment. The judge finds that the Defendant's claims have merit and grants the Motion to Set Aside Default Judgment. The Defendant is ordered to file an answer within 10 days, and the trial date is reset for June 4, 2024.
