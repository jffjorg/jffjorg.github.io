On
September 19, 2022, Plaintiff Old Republic Surety Company (“Plaintiff” or “Old
Republic”) filed a Complaint for Interpleader against Defendants Metropolitan
Pool Builders dba BlueHaven Pools (“MPB”), Monica J. Dumont (“Dumont”), Paul
Flowers (“Flowers”), Jared Negron (“Negron”), and Sean Hoagland (“Hoagland”)
(collectively “Defendants”). 
 
On
November 16, 2022, pursuant to Plaintiff’s request, the Court dismissed
Defendants Negron and Hoagland from the action. (11-15-22 Request for
Dismissal.) 
 
On
December 5, 2022, Defendant Flowers, in propria persona, filed an Answer to the
Complaint. 
 
On
June 20, 2023, pursuant to Plaintiff’s request, the Court entered default
against Defendants MPB and Dumont. On July 13, 2023, pursuant to the parties’
stipulation, the Court set aside the default entered against Defendant MPB.
(7-13-23 Stipulation and Order.) MPB filed an Answer on July 20, 2023. 
 
On
June 20, 2023, Plaintiff Old Republic filed the instant Motion to Deposit and
Discharge Stakeholder and Request for Attorney’s Fees (“Motion”). 
 
No
opposition has been filed to Plaintiff’s Motion.
 
On
August 28, 2023, the Court issued a minute order continuing the hearing on this
matter to October 4, 2023. The Court found that Plaintiff has satisfied all
requirements for the instant Motion. (Ibid.) However, because the Court
also found that Plaintiff has not deposited the interpleader funds, the Court
continued the hearing to allow Plaintiff time to deposit the interpleader funds
with the Court. The Court declined to rule on Plaintiff’s request for
attorney’s fees and costs until the next scheduled hearing. (8-28-23 Minute
Order.)
 
On
September 21, 2023, Plaintiff filed a notice of deposit of bond funds in
support of the instant motion.  (9-21-23
Notice of Deposit of Bond Funds; Ex. “1.”) 
 
ANALYSIS 
 
I.                  
Legal Standard 
 
Interpleader
is a procedure whereby a person holding money or personal property to which
conflicting claims are being made by others, can join the adverse claimants and
force them to litigate their claims among themselves. (See Code of Civ. Proc. §
386; Hancock Oil Co. v. Hopkins (1944) 24 Cal. 2d 497, 508; City of
Morgan Hill v. Brown (1999) 71 Cal.App.4th 1114, 1122-23.) 
 
Once
the stakeholder’s right to interplead is established, and he or she deposits
the money or personal property in court, he or she may be discharged from
liability to any of the claimants. This enables the stakeholder to avoid a
multiplicity of actions, and the risk of inconsistent results if each of the
claimants were to sue him or her separately. (Cantu v. Resolution Trust
Corp. (1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 857, 874; City of Morgan Hill, supra, 71
Cal.App.4th at 1122.) 
 
“An
interpleader action is traditionally viewed as two suits: one between the
stakeholder and the claimants to determine the stakeholder's right to
interplead, and the other among the claimants to determine who shall receive
the funds interpleaded ... As against the stakeholder, claimants may raise only
matters which go to whether the suit is properly one for interpleader; i.e.,
whether the elements of an interpleader action are present.” (State Farm
Fire & Cas. Co. v. Pietak (2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 600, 612.)
 
If
the defendant-stakeholder claims no interest in the funds or property held, he
or she need not file an interpleader cross-complaint. He or she may simply
apply to the court for permission to deposit the money or property with the
court clerk, and for an order discharging him or her from further liability to
the adverse claimants. Such order will also substitute the adverse claimants as
parties to the action; or, if only money is involved, simply dismiss the
stakeholder. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 386 subd. (a), 386.5.) The motion must be
supported by an affidavit by the stakeholder establishing the ground for
interpleader. (Code Civ. Proc., § 386(a).) The supporting affidavit must also
state that the moving party is “a mere stakeholder with no interest in the
amount or any portion thereof and that conflicting demands have been made upon
him for the amount by parties to the action…” (Code Civ. Proc., § 386.5.)
Notice of the motion must be served on each of the adverse claimants to the
funds or property. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 386 subd. (a), 386.5.) “Where a deposit
has been made pursuant to Section 386, the court shall, upon the application of
any party to the action, order such deposit to be invested in an insured
interest-bearing account.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 386.1.) 
 
Pursuant
to § 386 subdivision (f), the court may also “enter may enter its order
restraining all parties to the action from instituting or further prosecuting
any other proceeding in any court in this state affecting the rights and
obligations as between the parties to the interpleader until further order of
the court.” (Cal. Civ. Proc. § 386 subd. (f).) 
 
The
stakeholder may seek reimbursement for its costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees
incurred. (Code Civ. Proc., § 386.6; UAP-Columbus JV 326132 v. Nesbitt
(1991) 234 Cal.App.3d 1028, 1036.) The court may order payment thereof out of
the funds deposited by the stakeholder. (Code Civ. Proc., § 386.6.)
 
II.               
Discussion 
 
A.    Motion
to Dismiss and Discharge 
 
The
subject matter of the instant Motion is a $15,000 Contractor’s State License
Bond issued to Defendant MPB, as principal. (Sosa Decl. ¶ 2.) Plaintiff Old
Republic filed a Complaint in Interpleader naming the following claimants to
the bond: 
 
(1)  
Metropolitan Pool Builders dba Blue Haven Pools
(Answered)
(2)  
Monica J. Dumont (Defaulted)
(3)  
Paul Flowers (Answered)
(4)  
Jared Negron (Dismissed)
(5)  
Sean Hoagland (Dismissed) 
 
(Id. at ¶¶ 3-4; Compl.) 
 
Plaintiff
contends that “it does not know and cannot determine the respective merits of
the claim from plaintiff and the defenses of METROPOLITAN POOL which are
conflicting claims against the subject bond” and finds that the interpleader is
a “safe, expedient, or economical remedy.” (Sosa Decl. ¶ 8.) Plaintiff states
that it “has no interest in the proceeds of Bond No. W150387234 and is a mere
stakeholder with respect thereto pursuant to CCP § 386.5.” (Ibid.) Old
Republic requests permission from the Court to deposit the $15,000 bond with
the Court, less attorney’s fees and costs, and be discharged from further
liability to claimants in regard to this bond. (Mot. p. 2.) It also requests
that the Court issue a restraining order against claimants and all other
persons from instituting further legal action against Old Republic with respect
to this bond, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 386(f). (Id. at pp.
2-3.) 
 
Plaintiff
has served the moving papers on Defendants MPB, Dumont, and Flowers via U.S.
mail. (Mot. pp. 8-9.) The Court finds that Plaintiff has satisfied all
requirements for the instant Motion. Furthermore, the Court finds that
Plaintiff has deposited the interpleader funds as order by the Court.  (8-28-23 Minute Order; 9-21-23 Notice of
Deposit of Bond Funds; Ex. “1.”) 
 
Thus,
Plaintiff is entitled to be dismissed and discharged from liability. The Motion
is GRANTED. 
 
B.     Attorney’s
Fees and Costs 
 
The
stakeholder may seek reimbursement for its costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees
incurred. (Code Civ. Proc. § 386.6; UAP-Columbus JV 326132 v. Nesbitt
(1991) 234 Cal.App.3d 1028, 1036.) The court may order payment thereof out of
the funds deposited by the stakeholder. (Code Civ. Proc. § 386.6.)
 
Plaintiff
Old Republic requests $1,800 in attorney’s fees and costs related to the
interpleader although the attorney’s fees and costs exceed $1,800. (Sosa Decl.
¶ 10.) The costs are as follows:
 
(1)   $370
filing fee;
(2)   $75
in service fees as to Defendant MPB;
(3)   $170
in service fees as to Defendant Monica J. Dumont;
(4)   $65
in service fee as to Defendant Paul Flowers;
(5)   $55
in service fee as to Defendant Jared Negron;
(6)   $65
in service fee as to Defendant Sean Hoagland; and
(7)   $60
filing fee for the instant Motion. 
 
(Id. at ¶
6.) Furthermore, Plaintiff’s counsel has attached an itemized statement
containing details of additionally incurred attorney’s fees and states than an
additional $450 in attorney’s fees is requested for filing the instant Motion.
(Ibid.; Ex. “1.”) The Court finds Plaintiff’s request to be reasonable
and that Plaintiff has deposited the funds with the Court. Thus, Plaintiff’s request
for attorney’s fees and costs in the amount of $1,800 is granted. 
 
III.       Conclusion  
 
In all, the Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s
Motion for an Order of Deposit, Restraining Order, Interpleader, and Attorney’s
Fees in the amount of $1,800. Moving Party is ordered to give notice.
