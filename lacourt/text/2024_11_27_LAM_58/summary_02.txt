**Legal Standard**

**Significant Statements**

* "The requirement of a separate statement from the moving party and a responding statement from the party opposing summary judgment or summary adjudication serves two functions: to give the parties notice of the material facts at issue in the motion and to permit the trial court to focus on whether those facts are truly undisputed."
* "A motion for summary adjudication may be granted only if it completely disposes of a cause of action, an affirmative defense, a claim for damages, or an issue of duty."
* "To prove theft, a plaintiff must establish criminal intent on the part of the defendant beyond mere proof of nonperformance or actual falsity."
