And here is the English-text summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The Judge is considering a motion to augment the Phase 1 record with extra-record evidence to support preemption claims. The petitioners argue that the Court should consider extra-record evidence to support their constitutional challenges to the local ordinance, citing Western States Petroleum Ass'n. v. Superior Court. The County opposes the motion, arguing that extra-record evidence should not be permitted to adjudicate state preemption claims because they are a pure question of law. The Judge rules that the Court grants the motion, allowing the petitioners to refer to a small set of documents outside the administrative record. The Judge notes that the Court will need to consider the facts surrounding the use of the County's powers for contending that this ordinance is or is not preempted. The Judge also notes that the Court cannot conclude that it can permissibly now bar Defendants altogether from offering evidence outside the administrative record as pertains to preemption.
