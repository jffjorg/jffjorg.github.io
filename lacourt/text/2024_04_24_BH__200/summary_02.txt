And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has granted the motion to augment the Phase 1 record with extra-record evidence to support preemption claims. The court finds that preemption is a legal issue, but also notes that the court's decision may still turn on particular facts. The court concludes that the County of Los Angeles should be allowed to refer to a much smaller set of documents in the preemption phase of the case, without prejudice to other parties having the opportunity to object to the court's consideration of specific evidence based on relevance or for other reasons. The court's decision is without prejudice to the parties' ability to object to specific evidence or cross-examine witnesses at trial.
