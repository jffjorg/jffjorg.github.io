And here is the English text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses five motions in limine filed by the parties. The court grants the motion to exclude the expert testimony of Dr. Sean Fischer, Tom Hacker, Robert Griswold, and Robert Zohoury based on their failure to make them available for deposition. The court also grants the motion to exclude the expert testimony of Harry L. Skalsky and Jonathan Massey to the extent it is inconsistent with the facts found by the Santa Monica Rent Control Board. The court denies the motion to exclude the expert testimony of Alan Wallace, but limits his testimony to opinions based on foundation evidence. The court denies the motion to exclude the expert testimony of Dr. Gary Richwald, but requires him to explain his qualifications and experience related to the issues at hand. Finally, the court denies the motion to exclude expert testimony related to the lack of a permit for construction work or reliance on the SMRCB for its hearsay statements.

The court also addresses several procedural issues, including the exclusion of documents that were responsive to defendants' second set of document requests. The court finds that the defendants did not comply with LASC Rule 3.57 and denies their motion. The court also discusses the exclusion of expert testimony related to the SMRCB decision and the weight of the evidence.
