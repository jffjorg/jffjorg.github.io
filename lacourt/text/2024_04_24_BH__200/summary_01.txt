And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling grants the motion to augment the Phase 1 record with extra-record evidence to support preemption claims. The Court finds that the issue of the exclusive nature of an administrative record does not apply to the preemption phase of the case. The Court allows the parties to refer to a smaller set of documents in the preemption phase of the case. The ruling is without prejudice to other parties still having the opportunity to object to the Court's consideration of specific evidence based on relevance or for other reasons, or if there were a trial in this phase of the case, to cross-examine witnesses.
