SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of a dog attack that occurred on
4/25/24 and ensuing confrontations and/or altercations between Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant
Ralph Sasson (Ralph) and Defendants/Cross-Complainants Quentin (Quentin) Collins,
Bernard Collins (Bernard) and Armene Voskanyan (Armene) (collectively, the
Collins Family) occurring on 4/25/24, 4/26/24, 4/27/24 and 7/10/24.
 
Ralph and the Collins Family live on the same block with
one house separating their homes.  In the
late evening on 4/25/24, as evidenced by the testimony and other evidence at
the hearings on the restraining orders between the parties, the Collins
Family’s German Shepherds attacked Ralph’s two small dogs by coming onto
Ralph’s property.  (See Karapetyan
Decl., Ex.1-3, 6, 7).  The testimony further indicates that the
situation became heated with Ralph, Quentin and Bernard exchanging expletives and
Quentin and Bernard refusing to leave Ralph’s property after repeatedly being
asked to do so.  (Id.).  Thereafter, on 4/26/24 and 4/27/24, further
words were exchanged between Ralph, Quentin and Bernard culminating in a
physical altercation.  Id.  The parties filed petitions for restraining
orders against one another which were granted on 8/6/24.  (Id., Ex.2, p.99:6-p.105:7).    
 
On 9/6/24, Sasson filed this action against the Collins
Family for: (1) Strict Liability (Bernard & Armene), (2) Negligence Per Se (Bernard
& Armene), (3) Negligence (Bernard & Armene), (4) Trespass to Chattels
(Bernard & Armene), (5) Negligent Supervision (Bernard & Armene), (6)
Assault I (Quentin), (7) Assault II (Quentin), (8) Battery (Quentin), (9)
Trespass to Land (Quentin), (10) Assault (Bernard), (11) Battery (Bernard),
(12) Trespass to Land I (Bernard), (13) Trespass to Land II (Bernard), (14)
Slander Per Se (Bernard) and (15) Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress
(Bernard & Quentin).  
 
On 10/25/24, the Collins Family, representing themselves,
answered the complaint and filed a cross-complaint against Ralph for: (1) Assault,
(2) Battery, (3) Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress, (4) Trespass to
Chattel, (5) Trespass to Land, (6) Violation of Ralph Act (Civil Code 51.7) and
(7) Violation of Bane Act (Civil Code 52.1). 

 
On 11/1/24, Ralph provided the Collins Family with the “safe-harbor”
notice required under CCP 128.5 and CCP 128.7 regarding the withdrawal of their
cross-complaint or the instant motion would be filed.  The Collins Family did not withdraw the
cross-complaint.  Therefore, on 11/25/24,
Ralph filed and, again, served the Collins Family with the instant motion
seeking an order, pursuant to CCP 128.5 and 128.7, imposing sanctions against
Cross-Complainants Quentin Collins, Bernard Collins and Armene Voskanyan, jointly
and severally, in the amount of $16,830.00 for Ralph Sasson’s reasonable
expenses and attorneys’ fees incurred as a result of Cross-Complainants filing
and refusal to dismiss their factually frivolous Cross-Complaint.  Additionally, Ralph Sasson requests that the
Court dismiss the Cross-Complaint with prejudice.  Further, Ralph Sasson requests that the Court
order that Cross-Complainants must obtain leave of
Court before filing any further pro se actions against Ralph Sasson. 
 
The Collins Family has not opposed or otherwise responded
to the motion.  
 
ANALYSIS
 
CCP 128.5(a) provides, in relevant part, that “[a] trial
court may order a party, the party's attorney, or both, to
pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees, incurred by another
party as a result of actions or tactics, made
in bad faith, that are frivolous or solely intended to
cause unnecessary delay.” (emphasis added). 
“Bad faith” means that “the action or tactic is being pursued for an
improper motive” such as intending to cause unnecessary delay, or for the sole
purpose of harassing the other side.  Gemini
Aluminum Corp. (2002) 95 CA4th 1249, 1263. 
Bad faith is also defined as dishonesty of belief, purpose or
motive.  Jones (2020) 57 CA5th
521, 536.
 
CCP 128.7 allows for the imposition of sanctions,
including monetary sanctions and dismissal, for abuses in the filing of
pleadings, etc.  See Musaelian
(2009) 45 C4th 512, 514; Ponce (2018) 21 CA5th 253, 263; Averill
(1996) 42 CA4th 1170, 1176 n.2; CCP 127.8(b), (d).  By filing the cross-complaint with the court,
the Collins Family certified to the best of their knowledge, information and
belief, formed after a reasonable inquiry that the cross-complaint was not
being presented for primarily an improper purpose, such as to harass or to
cause unnecessary delay or needlessly increase the cost of litigation and the
allegations and factual contentions have evidentiary support.  See CCP 128.7(b)(1), (3).  
 
The Court does not find that the filing of the
cross-complaint rises to the level of bad-faith necessary to impose sanctions
under CCP 128.5.  The Court finds that
the allegations in the cross-complaint arose after an incident, a dog attack,
which caused tensions to rise between neighbors who previously seemingly got
along.  The filing of the cross-complaint
(and the allegations therein) appears to be the Collins Family’s interpretation
of the interactions between the parties following the dog attack rather than an
act of bad faith.   
 
However, based on the evidence presented at the
restraining order hearings, including the testimony of the Collins Family, the
Court finds that the Collins Family did not/do not have evidentiary support for
the allegations made in the cross-complaint which concern incidents that
occurred on 4/25/24, 4/26/24, 4/27/24 and 7/10/24.  (See Karapetyan Decl., Ex.1-3, 6, 7);
CCP 128.7(b)(3).  For example, the
cross-complaint alleges that Ralph’s dogs attacked the Collins Family’s dogs
when the evidence at the restraining order hearings establishes that it was the
Collins Family’s dogs that attacked Ralph’s dogs.  (See Cross-Complaint ¶12; Karapetyan
Decl., Ex.1, pp.47:15-49:7, p.70:16-18, p.70:28-p.71:17; Ex.6).  Additionally, the cross-complaint alleges
that Ralph trespassed onto the Collins Family’s property shouting racial slurs
and making physical threats. 
(Cross-Complaint ¶17).  However,
evidence from the restraining order hearings indicates that Ralph never came
onto the Collins Family’s property.  (See
Karapetyan Decl., Ex.2, p.11:3-10, p.56:24-p.57:18; Ex.5-6).  
 
Sanctions imposed for a violation of CCP 128.7(b) must be
limited to what is sufficient to deter repetition of such conduct or comparable
conduct by others similarly situated and may include monetary sanctions (payment
of some or all of the reasonable attorney’s fees and other expenses incurred as
a direct result of the violation) and non-monetary sanctions, including
dismissal.  See CCP 128.7(d); Ponce,
supra; Averill, supra. 

 
Based on the evidence presented with this motion and lack
of opposition/response thereto by the Collins’ Family, the Court finds that
dismissal of the cross-complaint is warranted along with monetary sanctions in
the amount of $2,810.00 against the Collins Family, jointly and severally.
 
The Court finds that the $16,830.00 requested in monetary
sanctions to be unwarranted.  First, the
Court finds that the time spent by Ralph’s counsel reading the trial transcript
from the restraining order hearings and viewing the videos from 4/25/25
and4/27/24 would have been necessary to prepare Ralph’s claims against the
Collins Family in this action. 
Additionally, the Court finds that the instant motion is unnecessarily
lengthy.  For example the “Relevant
Factual Background” portion of the motion includes many irrelevant facts and
counsel’s improper commentary.  (See
Motion, p.1:26-p.2:7 - The fact that Ralph took the California Bar exam in 2022
and passed on his first attempt has no relevance to this motion/case and is not
supported by any evidence; p.15:2-p.16:7 amounts to improper
commentary/opinion).  Further, the motion
unnecessarily repeats the same “facts.” 
(See Notice of Motion, p.2:13-p.3:24 and Memorandum of Points
& Authorities, p.18:11-p.20:20 which unnecessarily reiterate the
facts/arguments included at p.4:15-p.14:7 of the Memorandum of Points &
Authorities).  
 
The Court finds that Ralph is entitled to recover
reasonable attorney’s fees in the amount of $2,810.00 for 4 hours to prepare
the instant motion, plus 1 hour to appear at the hearing on the motion at
$550/hour plus a $60.00 filing fee.
 
The Court finds that Ralph has failed to establish that
an order requiring the Collins Family to  obtain leave of Court before filing any
further pro se actions against Ralph is warranted or proper under the
circumstances.

CONCLUSION
 
The request for an order imposing sanctions against Cross-Complainants
Quentin Collins,  Bernard Collins and Armene Voskanyan under
CCP 128.7 is granted, in part.  Quentin
Collins,  Bernard Collins and Armene
Voskanyan’s cross-complaint against Ralph Sasson filed on 10/25/24 is dismissed
with prejudice.  Additionally, sanctions
in the amount of $2,810.00 are imposed against Quentin Collins,  Bernard Collins and Armene Voskanyan, payable
within 30 days.
 
The request for sanctions against Quentin
Collins,  Bernard Collins and Armene
Voskanyan under CCP 128.5 is denied. 

 
The request for an order requiring Quentin Collins,
Bernard Collins and/or Armene Voskanyan to 
obtain leave of Court before filing any further pro se actions against
Ralph Sasson is denied.
