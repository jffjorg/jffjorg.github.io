MOTION TO
BIFURCATE
 
Motion filed on 11/25/24.
 
MOVING PARTY: Defendant Zekai Yildiz
RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff Guillermo Velazquez
NOTICE: ok
 
RELIEF REQUESTED: An order bifurcating
the liability issues from the damages issues in the trial of this action so
that liability may be tried prior to damages. 

 
RULING: The motion is granted.  
 
SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of a motor vehicle collision that
occurred on 5/23/22 at the intersection of Balboa Blvd. and Woodley Ave. in Los
Angeles, California.  Plaintiff Guillermo
Velazquez (Plaintiff) was driving southbound on Balboa Blvd. when he made a
left turn onto Woodley Ave. and collided with the vehicle driven by Defendant Zekai
Yildiz (Defendant) who was traveling northbound on Balboa Blvd. and driving for
Lyft at the time of the collision.  Liability for the collision is disputed.  
 
On 5/10/23, Plaintiff filed this action against Defendant
and Does 1-50 for motor vehicle negligence and general negligence.  On 7/5/23, Plaintiff filed an amendment to
the complaint to add Lyft, Inc. in place of Doe 1.  On 7/11/23, Defendant answered the
complaint.  
 
On 11/25/24, Defendant filed and served the instant
motion for an order bifurcating the liability issues from the damages issues in
the trial of this action so that liability may be tried prior to damages.  Plaintiff has opposed the motion and
Defendant has filed a reply to the opposition. 

 
ANALYSIS
 
The Court has wide discretion to bifurcate issues for
trial.
 
CCP 1048(b) provides: 
 
“The court, in furtherance of
convenience or to avoid prejudice, or when separate trials will be conducive to
expedition and economy, may order a separate trial of any cause of action,
including a cause of action asserted in a cross-complaint, or of any separate
issue or of any number of causes of action or issues, preserving the right of
trial by jury required by the Constitution or a statute of this state or of the
United States.”
 
See also CCP 598.
 
Courts may order separate phases of trial for issues of
liability and damages.  See American
Motorist Insurance Co. (1998) 68 CA4th 864, 872-873.  A trial court’s discretion regarding a
decision to bifurcate will only be disturbed on appeal upon a showing of clear
abuse of discretion.  See Downey
Savings & Loan Association (1987) 189 CA3d 1072, 1086; Grappo
(1991) 235 CA3d 496, 504.
 
The Court finds that bifurcating the trial of this action
so that the issue of liability is tried before the issue of damages will simplify
and organize the presentation of evidence which will be conducive to expedition
and economy for the parties and the court.
 
In this case, it appears that there will be little
overlap in the testimony regarding liability and the damages claimed by
Plaintiff.  As such, bifurcating the
trial may avoid wasting time and money on the damage phase, if Defendant
prevails on the liability phase.  See
Trickey (1967) 252 CA2d 650, 653; Foreman & Clark Corp.
(1971) 3 C3d 875, 888, fn.8; (Sargsyan Decl.). 
Even if Defendant is found liable in the first phase of trial, such a
finding may promote settlement rendering the second damages phase
unnecessary.  
 
Plaintiff provides no authority to support the claim made
in the opposition that Defendant must present evidence that he will prevail on
liability in order to have the instant motion granted.    (See  Opposition, p.1:22-25, p.3:13-p.4:4).    
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion is granted.
