And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has granted the motion filed by the defendant, Zekai Yildiz, to bifurcate the trial of the action. The action arises from a motor vehicle collision that occurred on May 23, 2022, at the intersection of Balboa Blvd. and Woodley Ave. in Los Angeles, California. The plaintiff, Guillermo Velazquez, was driving southbound on Balboa Blvd. when he made a left turn onto Woodley Ave. and collided with the vehicle driven by Zekai Yildiz, who was traveling northbound on Balboa Blvd. and driving for Lyft at the time of the collision.

The Court has wide discretion to bifurcate issues for trial, and in this case, it finds that bifurcating the trial will simplify and organize the presentation of evidence, which will be conducive to expedition and economy for the parties and the court. The Court also notes that there will be little overlap in the testimony regarding liability and the damages claimed by the plaintiff, and bifurcating the trial may avoid wasting time and money on the damage phase if the defendant prevails on the liability phase.

The plaintiff has opposed the motion, but the Court finds that the opposition provides no authority to support the claim that the defendant must present evidence that he will prevail on liability in order to have the motion granted. Therefore, the motion is granted, and the trial will proceed with bifurcated phases for liability and damages.
