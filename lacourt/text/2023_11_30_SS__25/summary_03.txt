Summary: The Judge's tentative ruling denies Plaintiff's motion to strike Defendant's answer and Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment. The Court finds that Defendant's answer was properly filed after a substitution of attorney was made, and therefore, the motion to strike is denied. The Court also finds that Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment is not supported by a separate statement, proof of service, or admissible evidence, and therefore, the motion is denied.
