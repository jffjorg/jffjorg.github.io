BACKGROUND
 
On September 06, 2022, Petitioner Executive
Presentations, Inc. (“Petitioner”) filed a motion to compel arbitration and for
the Court to Appoint an Arbitrator against Respondent Joshua Weisbord
(“Respondent”). 
 
On March 29, 2023, the Court continued the hearing on the
motion till May 01, 2023, so that Petitioner could provide the court with authenticated
copies of the agreement containing the arbitration provision along with other
exhibits requested by the Court.
 
On May 1, 2023, the Court granted Petitioner’s motion to
compel arbitration and ordered the arbitrations be conducted by the American
Arbitration Association with an arbitrator selected by the AAA in accordance
with its rules and deferred Petitioner’s request for cos until the conclusion
of the arbitration. 
 
On September 12, 2023, Arbitrator William J. Tucker, Esq.
(the “Arbitrator”) issued an initial arbitration award awarding Petitioner in
the amount of $40,111.02 to
be paid by Respondent.  
 
On October 04, 2023, the Arbitrator issued a subsequent final
arbitration award (the “Award”) amending the initial arbitration award to
correct for an error mistakenly misstating the interest occurrence on the
initial award.
 
On October 05, 2023, Petitioners filed the instant
Petition for an Order Confirming Arbitration Award (the “Petition”) and provided
Respondent with notice of the Petition and proof of service by mail. No
opposition has been filed.

ANALYSIS
 
I.          Legal
Standard 
“Any
party to an arbitration award in which an award has been made may petition the
court to confirm, correct, or vacate the award.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 1285.) “Regardless of the particular relief
granted, any arbitrator’s award is enforceable only when confirmed as a
judgment of the superior court.” (O’Hare v. Municipal Resource Consultants (2003)
107 Cal.App.4th 267, 278.) “Once a petition to
confirm an award is filed, the superior
court must select one of only four courses of action: it may confirm the award,
correct and confirm it, vacate it, or dismiss the petition.” (EHM Productions, Inc. v. Starline Tours of
Hollywood, Inc. (2018) 21 Cal.App.5th 1058, 1063.) “It is well
settled that the scope of judicial review of arbitration awards is extremely
narrow.” (California Faculty Assn.
v. Superior Court (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 935, 943.) “Neither the trial court, nor the appellate court, may
‘review the merits of the dispute, the sufficiency of the evidence, or the
arbitrator’s reasoning, nor may we correct or review an award because of an
arbitrator’s legal or factual error, even if it appears on the award’s face.”
(EHM Productions, supra, at p.
1063-64.) 
 
II.        Discussion 
 
A.        Filing Requirements (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1285.4)
 
Code of Civil Procedure, section
1285.4 states: “A petition under
this chapter shall: 
 
(a) Set forth the substance of or have attached a copy of
the agreement to arbitrate unless the petitioner denies the existence of the
agreement.
 
(b) Set forth the names of the arbitrators. 
 
(c) Set forth or have attached a copy of the award and
the written opinion of the arbitrators, if any.” 
 
(Code Civ.
Proc. § 1285.4.) “A response to a petition under this chapter may request the
court to dismiss the petition or to confirm, correct or vacate the award.”
(Code Civ. Proc. § 1285.2.)
 
Here, Petitioner has satisfied the
requirements of CCP section 1285.4 by setting forth the substance of the
parties’ agreement to arbitrate within the Petition. (Pet., 2.) Petitioner sets
forth the Arbitrator’s name, William J. Tucker, Esq., and attaches two copies
of the Arbitrator’s award[1]
of $40,111.02 in
Plaintiff’s favor along with a letter indicating the award is duly executed. (See
Attachment 8(c)-2, See Also Attachment 8(c).) The Award stipulates
that the Petitioner is to be awarded the amount totaling $40,111.02
representing the sum of $16,980.13
for failure to pay for services, $3,121.55 in interest and $15,964.50 for
attorney’s fees, $2,394.84 in costs, and $1,650.00 in fees remitted to the
American Arbitration Association by Petitioner. (Id.) Respondents have
not filed any response requesting the Court to dismiss the petition or to
confirm, correct or vacate the award. Thus, the Court finds that Petitioner
follows CCP section 1285.4.
B.        Service of the Petition and Notice of Hearing (Code Civ.
Proc. § 1290.4)
Code of
Civil Procedure, section 1290.4 states, in relevant part: 
 
“(a) A copy of the petition and a
written notice of the time and place of the hearing thereof and any other
papers upon which the petition is based
shall be served in the manner provided in the arbitration agreement for the
service of such petition and notice.
 
(b) If the arbitration agreement does not
provide the manner in which such service shall be made and the person upon whom
service is to be made has not previously appeared in the proceeding and has not
previously been served in accordance with this subdivision:
 
(1) Service within this State shall be made in the
manner provided by law for the service of summons in an action. 
 
(2) Service outside this State shall be made by mailing
the copy of the petition and notice of hearing and other papers by registered
or certified mail. Personal service is the equivalent of such service by mail.
Proof of service by mail shall be made by affidavit showing such mailing
together with the return receipt of the United States Post Office bearing the
signature of the person on whom service was made…” 
(Code Civ. Proc., §
1290.4(a)&(b).)
 
Here, the Petition and notice
of hearing was served by mail on Respondent on October 05, 2023. (See. 10/05/23
Notice of Hearing.) Thus, the
Court finds that Petitioner has satisfied CCP section 1290.4.
C.        Service
of the Arbitration Award & Timeliness of Petition (Code Civ. Proc. §§
1283.6, 1288, 1288.4)
Code of Civil Procedure section 1283.6
provides that, “The neutral arbitrator
shall serve a signed copy of
the award on each party to the arbitration personally or by registered or
certified mail or as provided in the agreement.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
1283.6.)  California Rules of Court rule
3.825(b)(1) provides that the arbitrator must file the award with the clerk,
with proof of service on each party to the arbitration. (CA ST CIVIL RULES Rule
3.825(b)(1)) The Superior Court of Los Angeles County, Local Rules, rule
3.301(a) so provides that consistent with CRC 3.825, the arbitrator can satisfy
this by filing Form LAADR-014 with the award, and proof of service. (Super. Ct.
L.A. County, Local Rules, rule 3.301(a).) Additionally, a party may seek a
court judgment confirming an arbitration award by filing and serving a petition
no more than four years, but not less
than 10 days, after the award is served on
the petitioner. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1288, 1288.4.)
Petitioner has attached a letter from the Manager of ADR
Services of the American Arbitration Association, addressed to all parties of
the inclusion of the initial award, to the petition. (See Petition,
Attachment 8(c).) The same was done when the Manager of ADR services provided
the parties with a copy of the amended Award on October 04, 2023. (See Attachment
8(c)-2 at 4.) This would not be sufficient to meet CCP section 1283.6 nor CRC
rule 3.825(b)(1). For CCP section 1283.6 to be met, the Arbitrator needs to file
the award along with Form LAADR-014 and proof of service indicating both
parties were served. Here the arbitrator has not done so. Thus, the Petition
does not comply with 1283.6. 
Moreover, the Petition was not filed in a timely manner. CCP
section 1288.4 provides that no petition may be served and filed until 10 days from
when the petitioner was served a copy of the arbitration award. (Code Civ.
Proc. § 1288.4.) Here,
the amended award was served on October 04, 2023. Petitioner subsequently filed
and served the Petition on October 05, 2023, the day after the award was served.
Thus, since less than ten days have passed between when the amended award was
served and when Petitioner filed the Petition, the Petition does not comply
with CCP section 1288.4. 
Therefore, because the Petition does
not satisfy the requirements, the Petition is DENIED without prejudice.
 
II.        Conclusion 
            
Petitioner Executive Presentation,
Inc.’s Petition to Confirm Contractual Arbitration Award is DENIED without
prejudice. 
 
Moving party is ordered to give
notice.
