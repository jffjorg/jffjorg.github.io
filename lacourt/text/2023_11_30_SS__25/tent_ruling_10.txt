(the “Arbitrator”) issued an arbitration award (the “Award”) in  the amount of $25,000 for Petitioners Michael Sanders (“Sanders”) and Trisha  Atkinson (“Atkinson”) (collectively “Petitioners”) and against Respondents Oren  Badler (“Badler”) and OB Floors, Inc. (“OB Floors”), (collectively  “Respondents”).    On March 1, 2023, Petitioners, in  propria persona, filed the instant Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award  (“Petition”) against Respondents.    On June 16, 2023, Petitioner  Sanders filed a Request to Postpone Trial in the form of a sworn declaration,  indicating that he had “to travel out of the country to act as a personal  caregiver and power of attorney for an ailing parent.”    On June 27, 2023, Petitioner  Sanders filed proofs of personal service on Oren Badler for the Request for  Postponement.   On July 5, 2023, the Court noted  that the Petition listed the Van Nuys Courthouse East address, instead of the  address for the Spring Street Courthouse. Pursuant to the request of Petitioner  Sanders (erroneously requesting continuance of trial rather than the hearing),  the Court continued the hearing to August 16, 2023, and ordered the moving  party to give notice.   On August 16, 2023, the Court  continued the hearing on the Petition because there was no indication that  Petitioner had served Respondents with a notice of continuance. The Court subsequently  gave notice to Petitioner Sanders and Respondent Badler.    On September 18, 2023, the Court  continued the hearing on the Petition to October 24, 2023, so that a legible  copy of the Home Improvement Contract could be submitted. The court also noted  that Petitioner had not presented evidence that a neutral arbitrator served a  copy of the Award on the parties. Petitioners were ordered to give notice.  Petitioners failed to file proof that notice of the continuance was served on  Respondents.   On October 24, 2023, the Court continued  the hearing on the Petition to November 30, 2023, so Petitioner could serve  Notice of Hearing on the Petition and the Petition on both Respondents.  Petitioner was also ordered to serve proof that the Arbitrator served the Award  on Respondents in accordance with CCP section 1283.6.   On November 14, 2023, Petitioner  requested to postpone the Hearing until December 14, 2023, and provided a declaration  regarding service of the Award by the Arbitrator on Respondents.    No opposition has been filed.    MOVING PARTY  POSITION               Petitioners  move to confirm the arbitration award they obtained against Respondents in the  amount of $25,000.00 on May 24, 2022, and enter judgment thereon. Petitioners  hired Respondents to perform renovations on their home. Petitioners claimed in  arbitration that Respondents’ work was substandard. Petitioners filed their  arbitration claim against Respondents pursuant to the arbitration clause  contained in the parties’ Home Improvement Contract.   OPPOSITION               No  opposition has been filed.    REPLY               No reply  has been filed.     ANALYSIS   I.          Legal  Standard  “Any  party to an arbitration award in which an award has been made may petition the  court to confirm, correct, or vacate the award.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 1285.) “Regardless of the particular relief  granted, any arbitrator’s award is enforceable only when confirmed as a  judgment of the superior court.” (O’Hare v. Municipal Resource Consultants (2003)  107 Cal.App.4th 267, 278.) “Once a petition to  confirm an award is filed, the superior  court must select one of only four courses of action: it may confirm the award,  correct and confirm it, vacate it, or dismiss the petition.” (EHM Productions, Inc. v. Starline Tours of  Hollywood, Inc. (2018) 21 Cal.App.5th 1058, 1063.) “It is well  settled that the scope of judicial review of arbitration awards is extremely  narrow.” (California Faculty Assn.  v. Superior Court (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 935, 943.) “Neither the trial court, nor the appellate court, may  ‘review the merits of the dispute, the sufficiency of the evidence, or the  arbitrator’s reasoning, nor may we correct or review an award because of an  arbitrator’s legal or factual error, even if it appears on the award’s face.”  (EHM Productions, supra, at p.  1063-64.)    II.        Discussion    A.        Filing Requirements (Code Civ.  Proc., § 1285.4)   Code of Civil Procedure, section  1285.4 states: “A petition under  this chapter shall:    (a) Set forth the substance of or have attached a copy of  the agreement to arbitrate unless the petitioner denies the existence of the  agreement.   (b) Set forth the names of the arbitrators.    (c) Set forth or have attached a copy of the award and  the written opinion of the arbitrators, if any.”    (Code Civ.  Proc. § 1285.4.) “A response to a petition under this chapter may request the  court to dismiss the petition or to confirm, correct or vacate the award.”  (Code Civ. Proc. § 1285.2.)   Here, Petitioners have satisfied the  requirements of CCP section 1285.4 by setting forth the substance of the  parties’ agreement to arbitrate with the Petition. (Pet., 2.) Petitioners provide  the Court with a copy of the sales agreement between the parties which includes  the relevant arbitration agreement. (See. Attachment. 4(b).) Petitioners  set forth the Arbitrator’s name, Kathy Vogdes, Esq., and attach a copy of the Arbitrator’s  award of $25,000.00 in Petitioners’  favor along with a letter indicating the award is fully executed. (See Attachment  8(c).) Respondents have not filed any response requesting the Court to dismiss  the petition or to confirm, correct or vacate the award. Thus, the Court finds  that Petitioners have satisfied CCP section 1285.4. B.        Service of the Petition and Notice of Hearing (Code Civ.  Proc. § 1290.4) Code of  Civil Procedure, section 1290.4 states, in relevant part:    “(a) A copy of the petition and a  written notice of the time and place of the hearing thereof and any other  papers upon which the petition is based  shall be served in the manner provided in the arbitration agreement for the  service of such petition and notice.   (b) If the arbitration agreement does not  provide the manner in which such service shall be made and the person upon whom  service is to be made has not previously appeared in the proceeding and has not  previously been served in accordance with this subdivision:   (1) Service within this State shall be made in the  manner provided by law for the service of summons in an action.    (2) Service outside this State shall be made by mailing  the copy of the petition and notice of hearing and other papers by registered  or certified mail. Personal service is the equivalent of such service by mail.  Proof of service by mail shall be made by affidavit showing such mailing  together with the return receipt of the United States Post Office bearing the  signature of the person on whom service was made…”  (Code Civ. Proc., §  1290.4(a)&(b).)   In our prior orders, the Court noted that the two proofs  of service filed on June 27, 2023 were not proper as Petitioners did not  provide Respondents with a copy of the Petition, and more specifically neither proof  of service indicated that Respondent OB Floors was ever properly served with a  copy of the Petition thus failing to comply with section 1290.4. (10/24/2023  Minute Order, p. 5.) Based on a review of the June 27, 2023 proof of service,  service rendered on Respondent Badler does comply with section 1290.4  subsection (a) as it did include a copy of the Petition. Specifically, the  proof of service provides the following documents were served: “ADR-106, Court  Filing.pdf, Notice of Case Assignment Superior Court.pdf, Notice of  hearing.pdf, superiorcourt.pdf, picture of Oren.pdf.” (6/27/23 Proof of Service)  ADR-106 is the form designation of the Petition itself. Thus, Petitioner has  properly served the Petition on Respondent Badler.    However, since the Court’s October  24, 2023 order was issued, Petitioner has not provided the Court with any proof  of service or other evidence that Respondent OB Floors was properly served with  a copy of the same documents provided to Respondent Badler or that one of the  proofs of service filed on June 27, 2023 was for service on OB Floors through Respondent  Badler. Thus, Petitioners are still not in compliance with section 1290.4 as it  relates to Respondent OB Floors.    C.        Service  of the Arbitration Award & Timeliness of Petition (Code Civ. Proc. §§  1283.6, 1288, 1288.4) Code of Civil Procedure section 1283.6  provides that, “The neutral arbitrator  shall serve a signed copy of  the award on each party to the arbitration personally or by registered or  certified mail or as provided in the agreement.” (Code Civ. Proc., §  1283.6.) Additionally, a party may seek a court judgment confirming an  arbitration award by filing and serving a petition no more than four years, but not less than 10 days, after the  award is served on the petitioner. (Code  Civ. Proc., §§ 1288, 1288.4.) In our prior order, the Court noted that the Award did  not include proof of service or any other indication demonstrating the  Arbitrator properly served a copy of the award on the parties. (10/24/23 Minute  Order, p. 5.) Petitioner subsequently filed a declaration on November 14, 2023.  (11/14/23Trisha Atkinson Declaration.)  Petitioners  declared that FairClaims sent a reply to their November 07, 2023 email  communication on November 13, 2023, declaring that the email they sent Petitioners  on Mar 24, 2022, was a true and correct copy of the email sent to both parties.  (Atkinson Declaration ¶ 4., Exhibit B) The Court notes that Petitioners  attached a copy of the email communications between Petitioners and FairClaims.  (Atkinson Declaration, See Exhibit B.) The emails show that the Award  was sent to both Petitioners and Respondents and are sufficient to show  compliance with CCP section 1283.6. Petitioner complies with CCP sections 1288 and 1288.4 as it  relates to Respondent Badler. Petitioner properly filed this petition seeking a  judgment confirming the award on March 01, 2023. (Pet.) Petitioner then properly  served Respondent Badler on June 27, 2023. The award was served to the parties  on May 24, 2022. Thus, approximately ten months have lapsed since the award was  served and when Petitioners filed the Petition and served Respondent Badler in  compliance with sections 1288 and 1288.4. (See. Petition. See Also 06/27/2023 Proof of Service.)  However, service was not properly made on Respondent OB Floors for the reasons stated  in section B of the order. Thus, the Court finds that Petitioners have not  complied with CCP sections 1288 and 1288.4 with respect to Respondent OB Floors.  Therefore, because the Petition does  not satisfy the requirements, the Petition is CONTINUED TO DECEMBER 14, 2023 at  10:00 a.m. at the SPRING STREET COURTHOUSE.   II.        Conclusion               The Petition is CONTINUED TO FEBRUARY 15, 2024 at 10:00  a.m. at the SPRING STREET COURTHOUSE. At least 16 court days before the next  scheduled hearing, Petitioners must file and serve supplemental papers that provide  proof of service or some other corroborating evidence showing the Petition and  notice of petition were served on Respondent OB Floors. Failure to do so will  result in the Petition being placed off calendar or denied.   Moving parties are ordered to give  notice.
