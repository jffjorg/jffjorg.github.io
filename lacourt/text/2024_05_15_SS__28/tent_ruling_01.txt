PARTY’S REQUESTS 
Plaintiff
asks the Court to enter default judgments against Heikali, F&M, and
Tabibian. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
A.      Default judgment 
“[With exceptions that do not apply here,] [a] party
seeking a default judgment on declarations must use mandatory Request for Entry
of Default (Application to Enter Default) (form CIV-100) . . . The following
must be included in the documents filed with the clerk: 
“(1)  Except in
unlawful detainer cases, a brief summary of the case identifying the parties
and the nature of plaintiff's claim; 
“(2) 
Declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment
requested; 
“(3)  Interest
computations as necessary; 
“(4)  A
memorandum of costs and disbursements; 
“(5)  A
declaration of nonmilitary status for each defendant against whom judgment is
sought; 
“(6)  A proposed
form of judgment; 
“(7)  A
dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application
for separate judgment against specified parties under Code of Civil Procedure
section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; 
“(8)  Exhibits
as necessary; and 
“(9)  A request
for attorney fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.” 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1800(a).) 
B.       Damages 
 On a request for default judgment, “[w]here a
cause of action is stated in the complaint, plaintiff merely needs to introduce
evidence establishing a prima facie case for damages.”  (L. Edmon & C. Karnow, Cal. Practice
Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶ 5:213.1, p. 5-56 (Cal.
Practice Guide), citing Johnson v. Stanhiser (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 357,
361 [trial court erred in applying preponderance of the evidence standard].) 
 The relief granted to a plaintiff upon entry
of a defendant's default cannot exceed the amount demanded in the complaint or,
for personal injury cases where damages may not be stated in the complaint, the
amount listed in the statement of damages. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 580, subd. (a),
585, subd. (b).) “The notice requirement of section 580 was designed to insure
fundamental fairness.” (Becker v. S.P.V. Construction Co. (1980) 27
Cal.3d 489, 494.) The statute insures that “defendants in cases which involve a
default judgment have adequate notice of the judgments that may be taken
against them. [Citation.] ‘If a judgment other than that which is demanded is
taken against him, [the defendant] has been deprived of his day in court—a
right to a hearing on the matter adjudicated.’ ’’ (Id. at p. 493.) A
trial court exceeds its jurisdiction if it awards damages in excess of the
amount specified in the complaint or statement of damages. (Id. at p.
494.) 
DISCUSSION 
A.   Heikali         
Plaintiff asks the Court to enter default judgment
against Heikali for $1,494,661.93, consisting of $94,661.93
in special damages and $1,400,000 in general damages.  According to Plaintiff’s statement of
damages, the general damages consist of $950,000.00 for pain and suffering and
$450,000.00 for emotional distress. 
The Court has reviewed the evidence and concludes that
an award of $250,000.00 for pain and suffering and $250,000.00 for emotional
distress is appropriate.  The Court
therefore reduces the general damage award to $500,000, making the total award
$594,661.93.  Based on the reduced
damages amount, the Court grants the application for default judgment against
Heikali. 
B.   F&M 
Plaintiff
asks the Court to enter default judgment against F&M for
$1,496,631.93, consisting of $94,661.93 in special damages, $1,400,000 in
general damages, and $1,970.00 in costs. 
According to Plaintiff’s statement of damages, the general damages
consist of $950,000.00 for pain and suffering and $450,000.00 for emotional
distress. 
The
Court has reviewed the evidence and concludes that an award of $250,000.00 for
pain and suffering and $250,000.00 for emotional distress is appropriate.  The Court therefore reduces the general
damage award to $500,000, making the total award $596,631.93.  Based on the reduced damages amount, the
Court grants the application for default judgment against F&M. 
C.   Tabibian 
Plaintiff
asks the Court to enter default judgment against Tabibian for $794,661.93, consisting of $94,661.93 in special damages and $700,000 in
general damages. 
On
January 18, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Statement of Damages listing $400,000.00 in
general damages, consisting of $250,000.00 for pain and suffering and
$150,000.00 for emotional distress.  The proof
of service showed service on September 7, 2022. 
On February 1, 2023, the clerk entered Tabibian’s default. 
On
January 30, February 6, 2024, February 23, and March 15, 2024, Plaintiff filed
a new Statement of Damages listing $700,000.00 in general damages, consisting
of $250,000.00 for pain and suffering and $450,000.00 for emotional
distress.  The proofs of service showed
service on January 15, 2024 and February 29, 2024.  The clerk entered a new default on April 10,
2024.  Therefore, Plaintiff put Tabibian
on notice of the new general damage amount before the clerk entered the April
10, 2024 default. 
The
Court has reviewed the evidence and concludes that an award of $250,000.00 for
pain and suffering and $250,000.00 for emotional distress is appropriate.  The Court therefore reduces the general
damage award to $500,000, making the total award $594,661.93.  Based on the reduced damages amount, the
Court grants the application for default judgment against Tabibian. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court GRANTS Plaintiff Ebrahim Ahdoot’s application for default judgment
against Defendant Mossa Heikali and awards Plaintiff Ebrahim Ahdoot $594,661.93
against Defendant Mossa Heilali. 
The
Court GRANTS Plaintiff Ebrahim Ahdoot’s application for default judgment
against Defendant F&M Radiology Medical Center and
awards Plaintiff Ebrahim Ahdoot $596,631.93 against Defendant F&M Radiology
Medical Center. 
The
Court GRANTS Plaintiff Ebrahim Ahdoot’s application for default judgment
against Defendant Behram Tabibian and awards Plaintiff Ebrahim Ahdoot
$594,661.93 against Defendant Behram Tabibian. 
Plaintiff
is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
