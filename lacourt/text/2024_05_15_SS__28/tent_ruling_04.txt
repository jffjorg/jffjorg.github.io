LEGAL STANDARD 
A.   Inspection demand 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2031.300 provides: 
“If a party to whom a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a timely response to it, the
following rules shall apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the demand for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling is directed waives any objection to the demand,
including one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under
Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve
that party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230,
2031.240, and 2031.280. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The party making the demand may move for an order
compelling response to the demand. 
“(c) Except as provided in subdivision (d), the court
shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails to obey the order compelling
a response, the court may make those orders that are just, including the
imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in
addition to this sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). 
“(d) (1) Notwithstanding subdivision (c), absent
exceptional circumstances, the court shall not impose sanctions on a party or
any attorney of a party for failure to provide electronically stored
information that has been lost, damaged, altered, or overwritten as a result of
the routine, good faith operation of an electronic information system. 
“(2) This subdivision shall not be construed to alter
any obligation to preserve discoverable information.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.300.) 
B.   Interrogatories 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2030.290 provides: 
“If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails
to serve a timely response, the following rules apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the interrogatories are
directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under
Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to the interrogatories, including
one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4
(commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that
party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, and
2030.240. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The party propounding the interrogatories may
move for an order compelling response to the interrogatories. 
“(c) The court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to
interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails to obey an order compelling
answers, the court may make those orders that are just, including the imposition
of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in addition to that
sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010).” 
(Code
Civ. Proc., § 2030.290.) 
C.      Requests for admission 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2033.280 provides: 
“If a party to whom requests for admission are
directed fails to serve a timely response, the following rules apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the requests for admission are
directed waives any objection to the requests, including one based on privilege
or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section
2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its
determination that both of the following conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2033.210, 2033.220, and 2033.230. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The requesting party may move for an order that
the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the
requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010). 
“(c) The court shall make
this order, unless it finds that the party to whom the requests for admission
have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed
response to the requests for admission that is in substantial compliance with
Section 2033.220. It is mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction
under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or
both, whose failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission
necessitated this motion.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280.) 
DISCUSSION 
On
January 11, 2024, Defendants served request for production of documents, set
one, special interrogatories, set one, form interrogatories, set one, and
requests for admission, set one, on Burden. 
Burden
did not provide timely responses and had not provided responses by the time
Defendants filed these motions on March 19, 2024. 
The
Court grants Defendants’ motion to compel responses to the request for
production of documents and orders Burden to provide verified code-compliant
responses without objections and to produce the documents, electronically
stored information, and/or other things requested without objections by June 14,
2024. 
The
Court grants Defendants’ motion to compel responses to the special and form
interrogatories and orders Burden to provide verified code-compliant responses
to the special and form interrogatories without objections by June 14, 2024. 
The
Court grants Defendants’ motion to deem admitted matters specified in the
requests for admission and deems those matters admitted. 
Defendants
request sanctions on the motions to compel responses to the request for
production of documents, special interrogatories, and form interrogatories.  Under Code of Civil Procedure sections
2030.290 and 2031.300, sanctions are available against parties, persons, and
attorneys who unsuccessfully make or oppose a motion to compel a response to
interrogatories or requests for production. (See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290,
subd. (c) [interrogatories], 2031.300, subd. (c) [demand for inspection].)  Burden
did not make or oppose a motion to compel responses to interrogatories or
requests for production. Therefore, sanctions are not available under these
statutes. 
Other
statutes addressing misuse of the discovery process do not, by themselves,
authorize a sanctions award for these motions. (See Code Civ. Proc., §
2023.010.) Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010 is “ ‘definitional’ and
monetary sanctions may not be imposed based solely on [the statute]. Monetary
sanctions may be imposed only if authorized by some other provision of the
Discovery Act.” (L. Edmon & C. Karnow, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure
Before Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶ 8:1900, p. 8M-2; see Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030
[court may impose sanctions for misuse of the discovery process “[t]o the
extent authorized by the chapter governing any particular discovery method or
other provision of this title”]; City of Los Angeles v.
PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLC (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 466, 498-504, review granted Jan. 23, 2023 with order permitting citation of opinion
for its persuasive value and to establish the existence of a conflict in
authority that would “allow trial courts to exercise discretion . . . to choose
between sides of any such conflict.”) 
California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1348(a), provides: “The court may award sanctions under
the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery,
even though no opposition to the motion was filed . . . .”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 1348(a).)  “ ‘Rules of court have the force of law and
are as binding as procedural statutes as long as they are not inconsistent with
statutory or constitutional law.’ ” (Fidelity National Home Warranty Company
Cases (2020) 46 Cal.App.5th 812, 842, fn. 41, quoting In re I.V.
(2017) 11 Cal.App.5th 249, 256.) 
Interpreting rule 3.1348(a) to authorize an award of sanctions on the
motions to compel would be inconsistent with Code of Civil Procedure sections
2030.290 and 2031.300. 
The
Court is required to grant Defendants’ request for sanctions on their motion to
deem admitted matters specified in requests for admission. (See Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c) [“It is mandatory that the court impose a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) on the party or
attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely response to requests for
admission necessitated this motion”].) Defendants request $800.00 in sanctions
based on four hours of attorney time at a rate of $200.00 per hour. Defendants’
counsel spent one hour attempting to meet and confer with Burden’s counsel and
two hours preparing the moving papers. Defendants’ counsel anticipated spending
one hour to attend the hearing. The Court grants $400.00 in sanctions based on
two hours of attorney time.
