And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The judge has denied Defendant Robert Romo's motion to shorten time to hear his motion for summary judgment or to continue the trial date. The defendant filed a motion for summary judgment on April 3, 2024, but did not serve it timely. The judge finds that the defendant did not show good cause for the late service and therefore denies the motion. The judge also denies the motion to continue the trial date for the same reason. The defendant's motion does not comply with the service requirement of California Code of Civil Procedure section 437c and therefore the judge denies the motion.
