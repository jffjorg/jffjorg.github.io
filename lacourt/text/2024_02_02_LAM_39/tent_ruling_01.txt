  Case Number:  23STCP03121    Hearing Date:   February 2, 2024    Dept:  39 Tricorbraun, Inc.
v. If Copack, LLC
Case No.
23STCP03121
Petition to
Confirm Arbitration Award
 
            Petitioner
Tricorbraun, Inc. (“Petitioner”) petitions to confirm an arbitration award
against If Copack, LLC (“Respondent”). 
The petition is not opposed, and the record reflects no good cause why
the Court should not confirm the award. 
Based upon the foregoing, the Court orders as follows:
 
            1.         The Court confirms the arbitration
award issued by the Honorable Candace D. Cooper (ret.), dated July 7, 2023, in
the total amount of $438,365.95 plus post-judgment interest at the statutory
rate.    
 
            2.         The Court has granted the only relief
sought in the petition, so the Court sets no future dates, and the Court’s
clerk shall close the case in the system.
 
            3.         Petitioner may lodge a proposed order
if necessary.
 
            4.         Petitioner shall provide notice and
file proof of such with the Court.
