Significant Statements:

* "The determination of what constitutes reasonable attorney fees is committed to the discretion of the trial court, whose decision cannot be reversed in the absence of an abuse of discretion."
* "The lodestar figure may then be adjusted, based on consideration of factors specific to the case, in order to fix the fee at the fair market value for the legal services provided."
* "The burden is on the party seeking attorney fees to prove that the fees it seeks are reasonable."
* "The reasonable hourly rate is that prevailing in the community for similar work."
* "A court should defer to the winning lawyer's professional judgment as to the tasks completed in an action because he won, and might not have, had he been more of a slacker."
