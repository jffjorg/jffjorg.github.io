And here is a summary in English text of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge grants Plaintiff Jennifer Cobio's unopposed motion to compel arbitration and stay the action against Defendants Mulholland Security Centers, LLC, Abraham Ben David, and Avi 'Coby' Jacoby. The motion was granted because the Plaintiff established the existence of an arbitration agreement and that the dispute is within the scope of the agreement, and the Defendants failed to respond to the requests to arbitrate. The Judge also denies the Plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions because the notice was insufficient and did not provide due process for the Defendants to be heard. The arbitration status conference is set for February 26, 2025, at 8:30 a.m. in Department T.
