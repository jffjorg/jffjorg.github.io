And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling states that the Plaintiff, Ally Bank, has successfully applied for a writ of possession against the Defendant, Meline Hovhannisyan. The Plaintiff provided evidence that the Defendant was properly served with the summons and complaint, and that the Defendant breached the Retail Installment Sales Contract, resulting in the Plaintiff's right to repossess the vehicle. The Court found that the Defendant no longer has rights to possess the vehicle and has refused to surrender it. The Plaintiff has shown that the account balance exceeds the value of the vehicle, and therefore, no equity exists for the Defendant. The Court waived the requirement for the Plaintiff to post an undertaking and granted the Plaintiff's application for a writ of possession. The writ will issue forthwith.
