  Case Number:  22VECV01190    Hearing Date:   February 28, 2024    Dept:  T Forrester v
Reshad 22VECV01190
 
2/28 Ex parte
application to continue trial: Denied. 
No good cause shown.  The court is
ready to proceed with trial as scheduled. 
The court finds grounds to grant relief from 1-day late designation of experts
as they are only treating physicians who have long been known to defendants and
not retained experts.  The court asks
defendants to produce their 2034 designation and supplemental designation to
determine whether the same doctors were designated by defendants as non
retained experts.
