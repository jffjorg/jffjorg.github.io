And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling in the case of Forrester v Reshad, case number 22VECV01190. The court denied the ex parte application to continue the trial, finding no good cause for the delay. The court is ready to proceed with the trial as scheduled. The court granted relief from the 1-day late designation of experts, but only for treating physicians who have long been known to the defendants and are not retained experts. The court also sanctioned both sides $250 for failing to comply with the court's Final Status Conference order, which required submission of witness lists, exhibits lists, and jury instructions. As a result, the only witnesses allowed to testify will be the plaintiff and defendant, and no exhibits may be used. The case will proceed as a bench trial.
