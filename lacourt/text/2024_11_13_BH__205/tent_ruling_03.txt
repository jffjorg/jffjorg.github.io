 Case Number:  24SMCV01598    Hearing Date:   November 13, 2024    Dept:  205    Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles – West District  Beverly Hills Courthouse / Department 205   WESTSIDE PROPERTIES-2 LLC,  Plaintiff, v.  RICKY DANIEL KAGASOFF, et al.,   Defendants.    Case No.:  24SMCV01598     Hearing Date:  November 13, 2024   [TENTATIVE] order RE:   PLAINTIFF’s applications for writ    of attachment   BACKGROUND  This case arises from a breach of lease agreement.  Plaintiff Westside Properties-2 LLC, entered into a written lease agreement (the “Lease”) with Defendant Swish Studios Grp, LLC (“Tenant”).  The lease was for commercial property located at 1323 Third Street Promenade, Santa Monica, California 90401 (the “Premises”).  (Zamudio Decl., ¶¶1, 3; Ex. A.)  Tenant was obligated to pay rent.  (Zamudio Decl., ¶4; Ex. A, B.)   As consideration for Plaintiff agreeing to the Lease, Defendants Ricky Daniel Kagasoff, Abhishek Hitesh Patadia, and Kevin Dwight Ware (“Guarantors”) signed a personal guaranty (the “Guaranty”), guaranteeing Tenant’s payment obligations under the Lease.  (Zamudio Decl., ¶5; Ex. B.)   Guarantors are jointly and severally liable for all rent payable to Landlord from Tenant under the Lease.  (Zamudio Decl., ¶¶5-6; Ex. B.)   Beginning in February 2024, Tenant and Guarantors failed to pay rent due through March 2024, in violation of the Lease and Guaranty, in the amount of $55,772.01, exclusive of late fees, interest, etc.  Plaintiff thereafter served on Guarantors and Tenant a “Ten (10) – Day Notice to Pay Rent or Quit”.  (Zamudio Decl., ¶7; McGarrigle Decl., ¶5, Ex. C.) Tenant and Guarantors failed to pay and Tenant failed to quit the Premises within the time set forth in the Notice. (Zamudio Decl., ¶¶7-8, 10.)  Once Landlord regained possession of the Premises, Landlord promptly hired a broker to market the Premises in an effort to mitigate its damages.  (Zamudio Decl., ¶11; Tenzer Decl., ¶¶2-4, Ex. D (the “Brochure”).)  However, despite the diligent efforts of Landlord’s broker, no replacement tenant has been found and, given the market conditions in the Third Street Promenade area, the earliest date range to secure a replacement tenant will be June-August 2025.  (Zamudio Decl., ¶11; Tenzer Decl., ¶¶4-5, Ex. D.)   Due to Guarantors’ breaches, Plaintiff has sustained fixed and readily ascertainable Rent damages, after a credit for security deposit, in the sum of $491,700.15 (“Unpaid Rent”).  (Zamudio Decl., ¶¶12-13.)  Guarantors’ breaches compelled Plaintiff to retain counsel and initiate this present action to recover unpaid rent, resulting in estimated fees and costs of $60,000.  (Zamudio Decl., ¶¶3, 5-6, 12-13; McGarrigle Decl., ¶¶2-3.)  This hearing is on Plaintiff’s applications for writs of attachment.  The applications seek an attachment in the amount of unpaid rent (of $491,700.15) along with Plaintiff’s estimated attorneys’ fees and costs (of $60,000.00), for a total amount of $551,700.15 (the “Attachment Amount”).   LEGAL STANDARD  “Upon the filing of the complaint or at any time thereafter, the plaintiff may apply pursuant to this article for a right to attach order and a writ of attachment by filing an application for the order and writ with the court in which the action is brought.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 484.010.) The application shall be executed under oath and must include:  a statement showing that the attachment is sought to secure the recovery on a claim upon which an attachment may be issued; a statement of the amount to be secured by the attachment; a statement that the attachment is not sought for a purpose other than the recovery on the claim upon which the attachment is based; a statement that the applicant has no information or belief that the claim is discharged or that the prosecution of the action is stayed in a proceeding under the Bankruptcy Act (11 U.S.C. section 101 et seq.); and  a description of the property to be attached under the writ of attachment and a statement that the plaintiff is informed and believes that such property is subject to attachment. (CCP § 484.020.) “The application [for a writ of attachment] shall be supported by an affidavit showing that the plaintiff on the facts presented would be entitled to a judgment on the claim upon which the attachment is based.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 484.030.)  “The declarations in the moving papers must contain evidentiary facts, stated ‘with particularity,’ and based on actual personal knowledge with all documentary evidence properly identified and authenticated.” (Hobbs, 73 Cal.App.4th at 79–80 (citing CCP § 482.040).)   The Court shall issue a right to attach order if the Court finds all of the following:  The claim upon which the attachment is based is one upon which an attachment may be issued. The plaintiff has established the probable validity of the claim upon which the attachment is based. The attachment is not sought for a purpose other than the recovery on the claim upon which the attachment is based. The amount to be secured by the attachment is greater than zero. (Code Civ. Proc., § 484.090.)  Statutory attachment procedures are purely creations of the legislature and as such “are subject to ‘strict construction.’”  (Hobbs v. Weiss (1999) 73 Cal.App.4th 76, 79; see also Nakasone v. Randall (1982) 129 Cal.App.3d 757, 761.)  A judge does not have authority to order any attachment that is not provided for by the attachment statutes.  (Jordan-Lyon Productions, Ltd. v. Cineplex Odeon Corp. (1994) 29 Cal.App.4th 1459, 1466.) “In contested applications, the court must consider the relative merits of the positions of the respective parties and make a determination of¿the probable outcome of the litigation.”  (Hobbs, 73 Cal.App.4th at 80.) REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE Plaintiff requests judicial notice of (1) 2024 Statement of Information of Swish Studios GRP LLC, filed with the California Secretary of State on August 14, 2024, (2) 2023 Statement of Information of Swish Studios LW LLC, filed with the California Secretary of State on June 1, 2023; (3) 2023 Statement of Information of Swish Studios SM LLC, filed with the California Secretary of State on June 2, 2023; (4) Douglas v. Smith, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 41577 (C.D. Cal. April 28, 2010); and (5) Wells Fargo Bank Nat’l Ass’n v. Kurt Orban, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 237760 (C.D. Cal. March 11, 2021). The Court grants the request as to (1)-(3) pursuant to Cal. Evid. Code §§ 452(c) and 452(h).  As to (4)-(5), the request for judicial notice is unnecessary; Plaintiff can simply cite to relevant caselaw.    DISCUSSION Basis of Attachment “[A]n attachment may be issued only in an action on a claim or claims for money, each of which is based upon a contract, express or implied, where the total amount of the claim or claims is a fixed or readily ascertainable amount not less than five hundred dollars ($500) exclusive of costs, interest, and attorney's fees.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 483.010(a).)  “An attachment may not be issued on a claim which is secured by any interest in real property arising from agreement . …” (Code Civ. Proc., § 483.010(b).)  “It is a well-recognized rule of law in this state that an attachment will lie upon a cause of action for damages for a breach of contract where the damages are readily ascertainable by reference to the contract and the basis of the computation of damages appears to be reasonable and definite. The fact that the damages are unliquidated is not determinative.  But the contract sued on must furnish a standard by which the amount due may be clearly ascertained and there must exist a basis upon which the damages can be determined by proof.” (See CIT Group/Equipment Financing, Inc. v. Super DVD, Inc. (2004) 115 Cal.App.4th 537, 541.) Here, Plaintiff’s requested attachment arises out of its claim for money (unpaid rent) due under the express terms of the Lease and Guaranty.  (Zamudio Decl., ¶¶3-8, Exs. A-B; RJN, Exs. E, F, G and H.)  The amount due is fixed and readily ascertainable (and in excess of $500) based on the Tenant’s rent obligations under the Lease, the Guaranty and the Guarantors’ obligations thereunder and Plaintiff’s supporting testimony and evidence.  (Zamudio Decl., ¶¶3-6, 12-13, Exs, A-B; CIT Group/Equip. Fin., Inc. v. Super DVD, Inc. (2004) 115 Cal. App. 4th 537, 541 (master lease and corresponding lease schedules provided clear and definite formula for computation of damages: monthly rent multiplied by unexpired term). Defendant argues that damages are not readily ascertainable because Plaintiff failed to mitigate damages and therefore there is a factual dispute on the amount of damages.  Based on the evidence, the Court concludes there is no failure to mitigate.  Plaintiff submitted the declaration of their broker (Barbara Tenzer) which shows Plaintiff actively marketed the Premises but could not find a replacement tenant.  Plaintiff’s broker sent a marketing brochure advertising the Premises to all known brokers in the marketplace.  (Tenzer Decl. ¶3.)  The broker installed signage on the Premises to alert potential prospects who drove or walked by the building.  (Id.)  The broker also marketed the Premises both online and through social media.  (Id.)  These facts support a finding that there is no failure to mitigate.   Trade, Business or Profession For natural-person defendants, as here, the claim or claims against Guarantors must arise out of their “trade, business or profession.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 483.010(c).)  If the sum total of the circumstances justifies the conclusion that the guarantor occupied himself to a substantial degree and on a continuing basis in promoting his own profit through provision of credit or management to the primary obligor, a guarantee executed in the course of such activity may properly be considered an obligation arising out of the conduct of the guarantor’s business. (Advance Transformer Co. v. Superior Court (1974) 44 Cal. App. 3d 127 (finding attachment proper where a husband and wife guaranteed a promissory note as payment for business materials of a closely held corporation); Douglas v. Smith 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 41577 *6-9 (C.D. Cal. April 28, 2010) (attachment may issue against individual guarantor who is in the business of extending credit generally, or so involved in the primary obligor’s business that the guaranty is made to further the guarantor’s livelihood or profit on a continuing basis).  Here, Plaintiff argue the Lease and Guaranty were executed in the context of a commercial leasing transaction with Guarantors directly involved in the Tenant’s business enterprise.  While Kagasoff and Patadia do not dispute Plaintiff’s claims that the Guaranty arises out of each of their “trade, business or profession,” Ware argues that he was not materially involved in the business of the Tenant and was merely a passive investor.  (Ware Decl. ¶2.)  Plaintiff presents no evidence to contradict Ware’s claim.  Accordingly, the Court denies the writ of attachment as to Ware.     Probable Validity “A claim has ‘probable validity’ where it is more likely than not that the plaintiff will obtain a judgment against the defendant on that claim.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 481.190.)  Here, Plaintiff has shown it is more likely than not to obtain a judgment against Guarantors on its claims.   Plaintiff satisfies all elements of a claim for breach of contract.  A breach of contract claim requires proof of: (1) the existence of a contract; (2) plaintiff’s performance or excuse for nonperformance; (3) defendant’s breach of the contract; and (4) the resulting damages to the plaintiff.  (Oasis West Realty, LLC v. Goldman (2011) 51 Cal. 4th 811, 821.)   Here, Plaintiff has shown the existence of a contract -- the written Guaranty (and underlying Lease) that binds Guarantors. (Zamudio Decl., ¶¶3, 5-6, Ex. A, B (Guarantors promised “absolutely” and “unconditionally” to fully and timely perform all of Tenant’s obligations).)  Plaintiff has performed all obligations required of it under the terms of the Lease and Guaranty, except for those obligations excused or not justified.  (Zamudio Decl., ¶9.)  Plaintiff has submitted admissible evidence that the Guarantors, and each of them, have breached the Guaranty by failing to pay rent due under the Lease.  (Zamudio Decl., ¶¶8, 10, Exs. A-C.)  The evidence also establishes that Guarantors are jointly and severally liable for the unpaid rent.  (Zamudio Decl., ¶¶5-6, 13, Exs. A, B.)  As a proximate result of Guarantors’ breaches, Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer substantial damages, which are fixed and readily ascertainable, in the amount of, after the security deposit is applied, $491,700.15. (Zamudio Decl., ¶¶12-13.)  Furthermore, Plaintiff was compelled to retain counsel and initiate legal proceedings to enforce the Guaranty, incurring estimated attorneys’ fees and costs of $60,000.  (Zamudio Decl., ¶¶3, 5, 13, Exs. A-B.)  In sum, Plaintiff has established through competent and admissible evidence that its breach of contract claim is probably valid.   Purpose and Amount of Attachment Code Civ. Proc. § 484.090(a)(3) states that the Court shall issue a right to attach order if “the attachment is not sought for a purpose other than the recovery on the claim upon which the attachment is based . . . [and] the amount to be secured by the attachment is greater than zero.” Plaintiff declares that the attachment is not sought for a purpose other than the recovery on Plaintiff’s claim.  (Appl. ¶ 4.)  The amount to be secured is greater than zero.   Based on the foregoing, the Court determines that Plaintiff has complied with Code Civ. Proc. § 484.020(c).  Subject Property Where, as here, the Guarantors are natural persons, Code Civ. Proc. § 484.020(e) requires that Plaintiff provide a description of the type of property subject to attachment that is “reasonably adequate to permit the defendant to identify the specific property to be attached.” (Id.)  Language that tracks Code Civ. Proc. 487.010(c) is reasonably adequate.  (Bank of America v. Salinas Nissan, Inc. (1989), 207 Cal. App. 3d 260, 267-68.)  Plaintiff’s request here to attach “all” property of Guarantors listed in Code Civ. Proc. section 487.010(c) and (d) (as applicable), overcomes any alleged objection that such description is not “reasonably adequate to permit the defendant to identify the specific property sought to be attached.”  Furthermore, Plaintiff is entitled to seek and attach all of Guarantors’ property which is not exempt, including Guarantors’ respective interests in real property, “whether or not it is business related.”  (Post-A-Traction, Inc. v. Kelly-Springfield Tire Co., 112 F. Supp. 2d 1178, 1183 (C.D. Cal. May 26, 1999); quoting Ahart, California Practice Guide: Enforcing Judgments and Debts, P 4:82 (1998 rev.).)  Thus, Plaintiff’s applications comply with the standards articulated in Code Civ. Proc. §§ 483.010(a), 484.020, 487.010(a), and 484.090(a)(1), (3), and (4).  Exemptions  Guarantors claim exemptions.  Kagasoff claims exemption of (1) common household items and personal property used in his trade and business in the amount of $8,725 and (2) his 2015 Lexis CT200H and a Buick Enclave for a maximum exemption of $7,500.  Patadia claims an exemption of common household items and personal property used in his trade or business in the amount of $8,725.  These exemptions are authorized under Code Civ. Proc. §§ 704.010 (car), 704.020 (household furnishings) and 704.060 (tools of the trade).  Reduction of Amount to be Secured Code of Civil Procedure section 483.015(b) provides that the amount to be secured by the attachment shall be reduced by, inter alia:  (2) The amount of any indebtedness of the plaintiff that the defendant has claimed in a cross-complaint filed in the action if the defendant’s claim is one upon which an attachment could be issued.  (3) The amount of any claim of the defendant asserted as a defense in the answer pursuant to Section 431.70 if the defendant’s claim is one upon which an attachment could be issued had an action been brought on the claim when it was not barred by the statute of limitations.  “[T]o sustain reduction in a writ amount, most courts require that the defendant provide enough evidence about its counterclaims and/or defenses to prove a prima facie case [for attachment against Plaintiff].”  (Ahart, California Practice Guide: Enforcing Judgments and Debts, ¶ 4:64 (1998 rev.).) There is no claim that the amount of attachment should be reduced by an attachable cross-claim or affirmative defense.   Undertaking  Code of Civ. Proc. § 489.210 requires the plaintiff to file an undertaking before issuance of a writ of attachment.  Code Civ. Proc. § 489.220 provides, with exceptions, for an undertaking in the amount of $10,000.  Neither party contends that another amount of undertaking should be required.  CONCLUSION For the foregoing reasons, the Court GRANTS the applications for writ of attachment as to Ricky Kagasoff and Abhishek Patadia subject to their claimed exemptions and DENIES the application for writ of attachment as to Kevin Ware.  Plaintiff is required to post an undertaking of $10,000.   DATED:  November 13, 2024   ___________________________ Edward B.
