And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants a motion to set aside a default judgment against Defendant Abraham Estrada in a breach of contract case. The plaintiff, Forwardline Financial, LLC, alleges that the defendants, Estrada Building Services, LLC, and Estrada, owe them a debt of approximately $81,000. The plaintiff served the complaint on Estrada by substitute service on March 2, 2024, but Estrada did not respond by the deadline. As a result, the clerk entered a default against Estrada on April 22, 2024. Estrada then submitted a motion to set aside the default, claiming that his attorney's mistake or neglect caused the default. The judge finds that Estrada has met the requirements for mandatory relief under Code of Civil Procedure §473(b) and grants the motion to set aside the default.
