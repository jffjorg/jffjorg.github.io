And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on the defendant's demurrer to the plaintiff's complaint. The complaint is unclear and lacks specific allegations, making it difficult for the defendant to respond. The judge agrees with the defendant that the complaint is subject to a special demurrer due to its uncertainty. The judge sustains the demurrer without leave to amend, meaning the plaintiff will not be allowed to revise the complaint to address the defendant's concerns. The judge also admonishes the plaintiff to follow applicable statutes and rules of court when serving the defendant with future filings.
