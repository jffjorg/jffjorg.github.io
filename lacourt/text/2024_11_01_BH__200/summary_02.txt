  - "By the same token, it is also not child support which is for Elizabeth. Property to which a minor is entitled is for a GAL to control (and the GAL can be a parent if they do not have a conflict.)"

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the cross-motions of Brian Corman and Elizabeth Weaver regarding the appointment of Lawrence Lebowsky as Substitute Guardian Ad Litem (GAL) for minor beneficiary Caroline Corman. The ruling grants Elizabeth's motion and denies Brian's motion.

The judge finds that Brian has a conflict of interest as beneficiary of the Sub-Trust and cannot properly represent Caroline's interests. The judge also finds that Lebowsky should be appointed as GAL to provide input for Caroline, separate and apart from the ongoing differing views of her parents.

The scope of Lebowsky's appointment includes reviewing and seeking approval of Crawford's accounts as to the Sub-Trust, determining whether it would be appropriate to seek the input of the Family Court concerning the ongoing legal effect of the December 12, 2019 order, and filing a response to the pending petition for writ of mandate if the Court of Appeal seeks further briefing.

The judge notes that the December 12, 2019 Family Law stipulation and order do not make clear whether Brian can represent Caroline's interests in her rights to Trust distributions, and that a GAL is needed to weed through the competing claims. The judge also finds that the appointment of Lebowsky is necessary due to the changes to the Sub-Trust by way of the court-ordered accounting that may be disadvantageous to Caroline.
