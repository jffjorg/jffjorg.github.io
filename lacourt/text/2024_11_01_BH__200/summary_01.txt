And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the motion of Dawn Mills regarding waiver of the right to object to her first and third accounts as trustee of the David Martin Finkelstein Trust. The motion was filed on October 2, 2024, and the hearing is scheduled for November 1, 2024.

The Court has reviewed the facts and legal arguments presented by the parties and has determined that the beneficiaries, Teresa Yui, Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute, City of Hope, Dollywood Foundation, and National Park Foundation, have not waived their right to object to the trustee's accounts. The Court has also determined that the joinder and supplement filed by City of Hope and Dollywood were timely filed and should not be deemed untimely.

The Court has exercised its discretion to hear the objections and supplements where Mills has not shown any prejudice from when these documents were filed. The Court has also determined that the trustee's payment to Jeffrey Condon in the sum of $35,450 is not proper and will be addressed at the trial.

The Court has denied the motion and will address the issues raised in the motion, including the verifications, duplication, and standing, at the time of trial.
