And here is a summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to her requests for production of documents. The defendant failed to oppose the motion, and therefore, the court grants the motion. The court orders the defendant to provide further code-compliant responses to the plaintiff's first set of requests for production of documents within 30 days. Additionally, the court imposes sanctions against the defendant in the amount of $500.00.
