And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has denied the petition to compel arbitration filed by Dean Gettleson against Mervat Kelada. The petition was filed in response to Kelada's failure to respond to Gettleson's demand to arbitrate a dispute arising from their retainer agreement. The judge found that the arbitration clause in the agreement is unenforceable due to its lack of specificity and information. Additionally, the judge ruled that Gettleson waived his right to arbitrate by initiating a small claims court action against Kelada. The judge also noted that Kelada did not waive her rights under the Mandatory Fee Arbitration Act, but has not invoked them either.
