And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Infinity Select Insurance Company's motion to intervene in the lawsuit between Blanca Rosa Quezada Garcia and Antonio Perez Garcia, on one side, and Abel Arteaga De Leon and Artlux Builders Corp., on the other side. Artlux Builders Corp. has been suspended as a corporation, and therefore lacks the ability to defend itself in the action. Infinity Select Insurance Company is the insurer of Artlux Builders Corp., and if a judgment is rendered against Artlux, Infinity Select may become liable. The judge finds that Infinity Select has a sufficient interest in the action to allow it to intervene, citing California law and previous court decisions. The judge orders Infinity Select to file a proposed answer to the complaint within 10 days of receiving the order.
