BLANCA ROSA QUEZADA GARCIA; ANTONIO PEREZ GARCIA, Plaintiff,
vs. ABEL ARTEAGA DE LEON; ARTLUX BUILDERS CORP.; et al.
MOTION FOR LEAVE TO INTERVENE
Infinity Select Insurance Company on behalf of Artlux
Builders Corp. seeks to intervene in this lawsuit.  Code of
Civil Procedure § 387.  It is the
insurer of Defendant Artlux Builders Corp. 
Artlux Builders Corp. has been suspended as a corporation, and hence
lacks the ability to defend itself in this action.  Revenue and Taxation Code section 23301 et
seq. and Reed v. Norman (1957) 48 Cal.2d 338.  As its insurer, Infinity Select may become
liable for any judgment rendered against Artlux Builders Corp.  Therefore, Infinity Select has the requisite
interest in this action such that it may properly intervene in this case.  Western Heritage Ins. Co. v. Superior Ct.
(2011) 199 Cal.App.4th 1196, 1205.
“As already noted (see fn. 9,
ante.), section 11580(b)(2) “provides insurance policies issued in California
shall either contain the following *1205 provision or shall be construed as if
this provision is in the policy: ‘A provision that whenever judgment is secured
against the insured or the executor or administrator of a deceased insured in
an action based upon bodily injury, death, or property damage, then an action
may be brought against the insurer on the policy and subject to its terms and
limitations, by such judgment creditor to recover on the judgment.’ Thus, a
judgment creditor who has prevailed in a lawsuit against an insured party may
bring a direct action against the insurer subject to the terms and limitations
of the policy. [Citation.]” (Kaufman & Broad, supra, 136 Cal.App.4th at p.
223, 39 Cal.Rptr.3d 33.)
This exposure to such direct
liability has been repeatedly held sufficient to create a basis for insurer
intervention in a third party action against the insured.12 “Intervention may
... be allowed in the insurance context, where third party claimants are
involved, when the insurer is allowed to take over in litigation if its insured
is not defending an action, to avoid harm to the insurer.”13 (Royal Indemnity
Co. v. United Enterprises, Inc. (2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 194, 206, 75 Cal.Rptr.3d
481.)”  Western Heritage Ins. Co. v.
Superior Court (2011) 199 Cal.App.4th 1196, 1204–1205 [132 Cal.Rptr.3d 209,
216]
No Opposition has been filed.
A proposed Answer-in-Intervention has been attached to the
Motion.
The Court finds that Infinity Select Ins. Co. is entitled to
intervene in this action.  The Motion is
GRANTED.
ORDER:
1.  The Motion to
seeking leave to intervene is GRANTED.
2.  Infinity Select
Insurance Company is ordered to file its proposed Answer-in-Intervention within
10 days of receipt of the Order signed by the Court.
