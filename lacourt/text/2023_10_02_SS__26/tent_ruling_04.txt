ANALYSIS:
 
On August 25, 2021, Plaintiff
Kemory D. Harris (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant action for breach of loan
agreement against Defendant Robert Carillo (“Defendant”). Defendant filed an
answer to the Complaint on September 23, 2021. The case came for trial on
February 22, 2023, at which time Plaintiff did not appear. (Minute Order,
02/22/23.) The Court dismissed the case without prejudice. (Ibid.)
 
Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to Vacate Dismissal on
July 14, 2023. No opposition to the Motion has been filed to date.
 
Discussion
 
The motion is brought
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure, section 473, subdivision (b). Under this
statute, an application for relief must be made no more than six months after
entry of the order from which relief is sought and must be accompanied by an
affidavit of fault attesting to the moving party’s mistake, inadvertence,
surprise or neglect. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b); English v. IKON
Business Solutions (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 130, 143.) When based on attorney
fault with respect to entry of default, default judgment, or involuntary
dismissal, a timely request for relief must be granted. (Code Civ. Proc., §
473, subd. (b).) When brought pursuant to the provision for discretionary
relief based on party fault, the request must have been filed within a
reasonable amount of time. 
 
The motion was timely filed
within six months of dismissal of the action and explains that Plaintiff went
to the wrong courthouse by mistake. (Motion, pp. 1-2.) However, Plaintiff must
set forth these facts in an affidavit that complies with the requirements of
Code of Civil Procedure section 2015.5. Additionally, the Motion is not
accompanied by a proof of service showing service of the motion papers and
notice of hearing on Defendant. Failure to give notice of a motion is not only
a violation of the statutory requirements but of due process. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 1005; Jones v. Otero (1984) 156 Cal.App.3d 754, 757.) 
 
Therefore, Plaintiff has not met the requirements for relief
under Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b). 
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff Kemory D.
Harris’ Motion to Vacate Dismissal is CONTINUED TO DECEMBER 4, 2023 AT 10:00 AM
IN DEPARTMENT 26 IN THE SPRING STREET COURTHOUSE. BY NOVEMBER 6, 2023,
PLAINTIFF IS TO FILE AND SERVE A SUPPLEMENTAL DECLARATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH
CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE SECTION 2015.5 AND PROOF OF SERVICE OF THE MOVING
PAPERS AND NOTICE OF NEW HEARING DATE ON DEFENDANT. FAILURE TO DO SO MAY RESULT
IN THE MOTION BEING DENIED.
