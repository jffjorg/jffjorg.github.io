**Summary:**

This is a tentative ruling denying Plaintiff Haroun Bacchus's Motion for Reconsideration in a lawsuit against Defendant Misty Thomson. 

The lawsuit initially involved claims of illegal lockout and breach of contract.  The Court previously dismissed most of Plaintiff's claims and granted Defendant's demurrer.  Plaintiff then filed a supplemental complaint and a trial was held which resulted in a judgment in favor of Defendant.

Plaintiff's Motion for Reconsideration is denied because it does not present new facts or law that could not have been presented earlier, and it was filed outside of the statutory time limit.
