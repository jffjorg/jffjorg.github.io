Brooks
v. Explorer 1 Ambulance & Medical Services, LLC, et al.MOTION
FOR ATTORNEY’S FEES
(CCP § 708.170)
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Judgment Assignee Creative
Recovery Concepts, Inc.’s Motion for Attorney’s Fees is DENIED.
 
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
On January 11,
2019, the Court entered judgment in favor of Petitioner Corey Brooks
(“Petitioner”) and against Respondent Explorer 1 Ambulance and Medical
Services, LLC (“Respondent”) pursuant to an Order, Decision, or Award of the
Labor Commissioner. 
 
On January 7, 2021, Petitioner filed a
Notice of Assignment of Judgment, naming Creative Recovery Concepts, Inc. (“Judgment
Assignee”) as Assignee of Record. On August 5, 2021, Judgment Assignee filed an Application and Order for Appearance and
Examination, which was set for hearing on February 7, 2022. On February 7,
2022, counsel for Respondent appeared and indicated that a Motion to Quash had
been filed. (Minute Order, 02/07/22.) The Court continued the hearing on the
second Application and Order for Appearance and Examination to May 24, 2022. (Ibid.)
Respondent filed a Motion to Quash Service of the second
Application and Order for Appearance and Examination on the same date, which
the Court denied on September 1, 2022. (Minute Order, 09/01/22.) 
 
The Order for Appearance and Examination was
reset for December 15, 2022, at which time Judgment Debtor did not appear.
(Minute Order, 12/15/22.) The Court held the bench warrant for appearance and
continued the matter to February 16, 2023. (Ibid.) On February 16, 2023,
the parties announced that a settlement had been reached and the Court
continued the Order for Appearance and Examination to July 17, 2023. (Minute
Order, 02/16/23.)
 
Judgment Debtor appeared on July 17, 2023
and after Judgment Assignee indicated that there was no settlement, the Order
for Appearance and Examination went forward. The matter was continued to August
30, 2023 to allow Judgment Debtor to bring the documents set forth in the
Subpoena Duces Tecum served with the Application for Order for Appearance and
Examination. (Minute Order, 07/17/23.) On August 16, 2023, Judgment Assignee
filed the instant Motion for Attorney’s Fees. No opposition has been filed to
date. 
 

Discussion
 
The Motion for Attorney’s Fees is
brought pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 708.170 but does not
specify under which subdivision. (Motion, p. 1:18-20.) Subdivision (a)(2)
states in relevant part: “If the person’s failure to appear is without good
cause, the judgment creditor shall be awarded reasonable attorney's fees
incurred in the examination proceeding. Attorney's fees awarded against the
judgment debtor shall be added to and become part of the principal amount of
the judgment.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 708.170, subd, (a)(2).) 
 
Judgment Assignee moves for
attorney’s fees incurred as a result of spending four hours at the hearing on
July 17, 2023 due to various failed motions and lengthy discussions by Judgment
Debtor’s attorney. (Motion, Love Decl., p. 2:15-25.) Despite all the time
spent, Judgment Assignee argues that the hearing was a waste of time due to
Judgment Debtor’s failure to bring the subpoenaed documents. (Ibid.) It
is unclear to the Court that attorney’s fees can be awarded under Code of Civil
Procedure section 708.170, subdivision (a)(2) where the judgment debtor appears
at the Order for Appearance and Examination. This statute only refers to fees
for failure to appear. Without further authority showing that Judgment Assignee
is entitled to fees for Judgment Debtor’s failure to comply with the production
of document pursuant to the subpoena duces tecum, the request is denied.
 
Conclusion
 
Judgment Assignee Creative
Recovery Concepts, Inc.’s Motion for Attorney’s Fees is DENIED.
 
 
Court clerk to give notice.
