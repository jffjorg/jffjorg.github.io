And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the six motions filed by Quint Tax Services Corporation (Cross-Complainant) to compel further responses to form interrogatories, requests for admissions, and requests for production of documents. The motions were filed after the statutory cutoff date for discovery and discovery motions, and the Cross-Complainant failed to meet the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 2024.050 for a continuance of the discovery deadlines. The judge ruled that it would be an abuse of discretion to grant the motions without evidence of the required meet and confer effort and without considering the statutory factors for a continuance.
