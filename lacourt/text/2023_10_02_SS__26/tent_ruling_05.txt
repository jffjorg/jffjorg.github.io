Bacchus
v. Thomson, et al.MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION
(CCP § 1008)
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Plaintiff Haroun Bacchus’ Motion for
Reconsideration is DENIED.
 
 
ANALYSIS:
 
On August 11,
2017, Plaintiff Haroun Bacchus (“Plaintiff”)
filed the Complaint in this action against Defendant Misty Thomson
(“Defendant”) in the unlimited jurisdiction court. The Complaint originally
alleged Defendant illegally locked Plaintiff out of their apartment in
violation of Code of Civil Procedure section 789.3 and sought monetary and
injunctive relief. The operative complaint is the Second Amended Complaint,
filed on December 18, 2019. On January 12, 2022, the Court granted Defendant’s
Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings as to the first, second, third and fifth
causes of action of the Second Amended Complaint without leave to amend.
(Minute Order, 01/12/22.) The only remaining cause of action is for breach of
contract re: nonpayment of the utility bill. (Ibid.) The Court then
reclassified the action as a limited jurisdiction case and it was transferred
to Department 26 in the Spring Street Courthouse. (Notice of Reclassification,
01/26/22.) On June 22, 2022, the Court denied Plaintiff’s Motion for Reconsideration
of the ruling on the Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings. (Minute Order,
06/22/22.) 
 
On December 21,
2022, the Court granted Plaintiff’s Motion to File a Supplemental Complaint.
(Minute Order, 12/21/22.) Plaintiff filed the Supplemental Complaint on
December 30, 2022. Trial was held on January 10, 2023, with judgment in favor
of Defendant. (Judgment, 01/10/23.) Notice of entry of the judgment was served
on the parties by the clerk on the same date. Plaintiff filed a Notice of
Intention to Move for New Trial which the Court denied on March 30, 2023.
(Minute Order, 03/30/23.)
 
Plaintiff filed
the instant Motion for Reconsideration with respect to the Court’s ruling on
the Motion for New Trial on April 10, 2023. No opposition has been filed to
date. 
 
Discussion
 
Plaintiff
moves pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1008, subdivision (a), which
states in relevant part:
 
When an application for an order has been made to a judge, or
to a court, and refused in whole or in part, or granted, or granted
conditionally, or on terms, any party affected by the order may, within 10 days
after service upon the party of written notice of entry of the order and based
upon new or different facts, circumstances, or law, make application to the
same judge or court that made the order, to reconsider the matter and modify,
amend, or revoke the prior order. The party making the application shall state
by affidavit what application was made before, when and to what judge, what
order or decisions were made, and what new or different facts, circumstances,
or law are claimed to be shown.
 
(Code Civ.
Proc., § 1008, subd. (a).) 
 
The Court
lacks the jurisdiction to reconsider a prior ruling, on motion of a party,
where the motion does not comply with the requirements of Code of Civil
Procedure section 1008. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1008, subd. (e); Le Francois v.
Goel (2005) 35 Cal.4th 1094, 1106.) The purpose of this jurisdictional bar
is to protect the Court from repetitive motions. (Ibid.) Also, the
statute requires the moving party “to show a satisfactory explanation for
failing to provide the evidence earlier, which can only be described as a
strict requirement of diligence” the purpose of which is to incentivize parties
“to efficiently marshall their evidence.” (Baldwin v. Home Sav. of America
(1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 1192, 1199 [citing Garcia v. Hejmadi (1997) 58
Cal.App.4th 674, 689-690].) 
 
Additionally,
“the power of a trial court to rule on a motion for a new trial is constrained
by the jurisdictional 60-day limitation period of section 660, which is a
specific statute, and cannot be extended or expanded by the procedural device
of moving under section 1008, a general statute, for reconsideration of an
order granting or denying a new trial motion, which necessarily involves a
request to correct judicial error.” (Jones v. Sieve (1988) 203
Cal.App.3d 359, 370 [the limitations period is now 75 days].) 
 
Plaintiff’s Motion for Reconsideration cites no new facts or
law that could not have been presented at the hearing on the Motion for New
Trial on March 30, 2023. Instead, Plaintiff continues to argue that the Court’s
rulings were in error. (Motion, pp. 3:3-7:11.) Furthermore, the Motion is not
set for hearing with the 75-day deadline to hear a motion for new trial under
Code of Civil Procedure section 660, subdivision (c).) 
 
Conclusion
 
Therefore, Plaintiff
Haroun Bacchus’ Motion for Reconsideration is DENIED.
 
 
Court clerk to give notice.
