The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the Motion for Attorney's Fees filed by Creative Recovery Concepts, Inc. (Judgment Assignee) on August 16, 2023. The motion was brought under Code of Civil Procedure section 708.170, subdivision (a)(2), which allows for the award of reasonable attorney's fees incurred in an examination proceeding if the judgment debtor's failure to appear is without good cause. However, the Judge finds that the statute only refers to fees for failure to appear, and not for failure to comply with the production of documents. Despite the judgment debtor's failure to bring the subpoenaed documents to the hearing, the Judge is unclear whether attorney's fees can be awarded in this situation without further authority. As a result, the motion is denied.
