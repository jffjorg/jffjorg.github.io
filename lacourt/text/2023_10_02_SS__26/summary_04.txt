## English Text Summary

The judge's tentative ruling in this case involves a motion filed by Kemory D. Harris (Plaintiff) to vacate a dismissal of her lawsuit against Robert Carillo (Defendant). 

The case was dismissed without prejudice in February 2023 because Plaintiff failed to appear at trial. Plaintiff claims she went to the wrong courthouse by mistake.

While the motion to vacate the dismissal was filed within the six-month timeframe allowed by law, the judge notes that Plaintiff must provide a formal affidavit explaining her mistake, complying with the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 2015.5. Additionally, Plaintiff has not properly notified Defendant about the motion.

Because of these shortcomings, the judge is continuing the hearing to December 4, 2023. Plaintiff must file the required affidavit and proof of service on Defendant by November 6, 2023. Failure to do so may result in the motion being denied.
