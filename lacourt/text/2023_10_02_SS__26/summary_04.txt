Harris, must file and serve a supplemental declaration by November 6, 2023, in accordance with Code of Civil Procedure section 2015.5. If the plaintiff fails to do so, the motion may be denied. The motion was filed on July 14, 2023, and explains that the plaintiff went to the wrong courthouse by mistake. However, the plaintiff has not met the requirements for relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b), as the motion is not accompanied by a proof of service showing service of the motion papers and notice of hearing on the defendant.
