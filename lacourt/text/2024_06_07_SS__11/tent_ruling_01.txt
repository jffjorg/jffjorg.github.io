TENTATIVE RULING
 
John Roe 88’s motion for joinder is denied.
 
BACKGROUND
 
The coordinated Southern California Clergy Cases (JCCP 5101)
consist of hundreds of individual lawsuits.  Plaintiffs
allege that clergy members sexually assaulted them when they were minors and
that the religious entities responsible for supervising the clergy members
failed to protect against the alleged sexual assaults.
 
Here, John Roe 88 moves to join John Roe 89, John Roe 90, John Roe 91,
and John Roe 92 to his bellwether trial.
 
DISCUSSION
 
The parties disagree about
whether Roe 88’s motion constitutes a joinder motion (Roe 88) or a
consolidation motion (Institutional Defendants).  
 
Technically, Roe 88’s position is
unavailing.  He filed the motion pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure section 378(a), which states:
 
(a) All persons may join
in one action as plaintiffs if:
 
(1) They assert any right
to relief jointly, severally, or in the alternative, in respect of or arising
out of the same transaction, occurrence, or series of transactions or
occurrences and if any question of law or fact common to all these persons will
arise in the action; or
 
(2) They have a claim,
right, or interest adverse to the defendant in the property or controversy
which is the subject of the action.
 
(Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 378, subd.
(a).)  He contends the motion should be
granted because his claims and the claims of Roes 89 through 92 arose out of
the same transactions or occurrences and involve common legal and factual
issues.  (See Motion, pp. 6-9; see also
Reply, pp. 3-4.)  As Institutional
Defendants point out, though, joinder is supposed to be addressed at the outset
of litigation.  (See Opposition, pp.
2-3; see also Edmon & Karnow, Cal. Practice Guide: Civ. Procedure Before
Trial (The Rutter Group June 2024 Update) ¶¶ 2:150-2:151, 2:205, 2:231
[discussing compulsory and permissive joinder and requiring misjoinder to be
challenged via demurrer or by “raising . . . an affirmative defense in the
answer”].)  Roe 88 joined Roes 89 through
92 in his complaint filed on February 9, 2022. 
He joined them again in his amended complaint filed on May 17,
2022.  Institutional Defendants neither
filed a misjoinder demurrer nor asserted a misjoinder defense (see 8/15/22 Roman Catholic Archbishop of Los
Angeles’s Answer, pp. 2-5; see also 8/19/22 Roman Catholic Bishop of Orange’s
Answer, pp. 2-7), so the misjoinder defect (assuming one exists) is “waive[d.]”  (Edmon & Karnow, supra, at ¶ 2:232,
emphasis in original.)  Consequently, if
viewed as a joinder motion, the motion is moot since Roes 89 through 92 are
already named parties, and the time to contest misjoinder has passed.  Section 378(a) is not the proper statute for
making a post-demurrer-stage request to add purported co-plaintiffs to a
bifurcated bellwether trial.
 
Nevertheless,
Institutional Defendants’ position is also technically unavailing.  “Consolidation
is a procedure for
uniting separate lawsuits for trial, where they
involve common
questions of law or fact and
are pending in the same court.”  (Id. at
¶ 12:340, emphasis in original.)  “Where separate
lawsuits have been filed, consolidation in effect permits a ‘joinder’ at a
later stage of the proceedings.”  (Id. at
¶ 12:342, emphasis added.)  There is only
one lawsuit here, and Roes 89 through 92 are already joined.  The consolidation rules do not apply.
 
What do apply are the
bifurcation rules.  Roe 88’s case is part
of the coordinated Southern California Clergy Cases (JCCP 5101).  It is a complex action.  As such, the Court has “inherent managerial
power” (Cottle v. Superior Court (1992) 3 Cal.App.4th 1367,
1378), including discretion to bifurcate Roe 88’s claims as part of a
bellwether procedure.  (See Edmon &
Karnow, supra, at ¶ 12:406 [noting that “[b]ifurcation is, in effect, the ‘flip
side’ of consolidation: i.e., it is the procedure whereby the court may order separate
trials of issues or parties joined in a single action”], emphasis in
original.)  On March 28, 2023,
Institutional Defendants selected Roe 88’s claims for bellwether
treatment.  (See Breidenbach Decl., Ex.
E, p. 6.)  Roe 88 did not object.  (See Opposition, p. 2.)  Now, more than 14 months later, with trial
scheduled for October 1, 2024, he asks to insert four Plaintiffs whose claims,
to date, have been stayed.  The Court
finds that the request should be denied because it undermines fairness,
judicial economy, and the goals of the bellwether process that the parties and
the Court spent months negotiating and crafting.  Allowing Roes 89 through 92 to skip to the
front of the line, adding non-bellwether claims to a bellwether trial, would be
contrary to the interests of justice.
 
Roe 88’s motion is
denied.
 
This ruling is not meant
to bar Roes 89 through 92 from bringing a future motion to have their claims
tried together.  The holding is
narrow.  The Court is merely finding that
their claims cannot be tried in Roe 88’s bellwether trial.[1]
