Significant Statements:

  - "What do apply are the bifurcation rules." (Edmon & Karnow, supra, at ¶ 12:406)
  - "The Court finds that the request should be denied because it undermines fairness, judicial economy, and the goals of the bellwether process that the parties and the Court spent months negotiating and crafting."
  - "Allowing Roes 89 through 92 to skip to the front of the line, adding non-bellwether claims to a bellwether trial, would be contrary to the interests of justice."
```

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied John Roe 88's motion to join four other plaintiffs in his bellwether trial. The judge found that the motion was unnecessary and would undermine the fairness and efficiency of the trial process. The judge noted that the four plaintiffs whose claims were sought to be joined were already named parties in the lawsuit and had not objected to the original joinder in the complaint. The judge also found that the motion was not a proper way to seek joinder, citing California Code of Civil Procedure section 378(a).
