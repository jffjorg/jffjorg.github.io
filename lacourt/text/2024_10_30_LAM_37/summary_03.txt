And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has made a tentative ruling on the Motion to Strike punitive damages from the Complaint. The Motion was filed by Defendants Jesse Braham and Iris Johnson, and the Plaintiff is Leeana Smith. The Complaint alleges 15 causes of action, including breach of implied warranty of habitability, negligence, and retaliation.

The Judge found that the Plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts to find that Defendant Braham acted with malice or oppression by engaging in conduct with a willful and conscious disregard to her rights as a tenant. However, the Judge found that the Plaintiff has failed to allege facts to show that Defendant Johnson, as a co-owner or agent of Defendant Braham, perpetrated, authorized, or knowingly ratified Defendant Braham's conduct.

As a result, the Judge granted the Motion to Strike as to Defendant Johnson with leave to amend, and denied the Motion as to Defendant Braham. The Judge granted the Plaintiff 10 days leave to amend and set an OSC RE: Amended Complaint for November 29, 2024, at 8:30 a.m.
