On September 18, 2024,

LEGAL STANDARDS 
A.        Motion to Strike 
 
¿Any party, within the time allowed to respond to a pleading
may serve and file a notice of motion to strike the whole or any part thereof.
(CCP, § 435(b)(1); CRC, rule 3.1322(b).) The court may, upon a motion or at any
time in its discretion and upon terms it deems proper: (1) strike out any
irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading; or (2) strike
out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the
laws of California, a court rule, or an order of the court. (CCP, § 436(a)-(b);
Stafford v. Shultz (1954) 42 Cal.2d 767, 782 [“Matter in a pleading
which is not essential to the claim is surplusage; probative facts are
surplusage and may be stricken out or disregarded”].)¿¿¿¿ 
 
B.        Leave to Amend 
 
“Where the defect raised by a motion to strike or by demurrer
is reasonably capable of cure, leave to amend is routinely and liberally
granted to give the plaintiff a chance to cure the defect in question.” (CLD
Construction, Inc. v. City of San Ramon (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 1141, 1146.)
The burden is on the complainant to show the Court that a pleading can be
amended successfully. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.)¿¿¿

I.         Discussion
 
Defendants move to strike the
Complaint’s request for punitive damages. (See Compl., ¶¶ 87:14-21; 94:18-25;
101:16-23; 146:10-17; 162:4-21; 181:7-9; 186:23-25; Prayer for Relief, Lines
10-11, 18.) 
 
To state a claim for punitive damages under Civ. Code
§ 3294, a plaintiff must allege specific facts showing that the defendant has
been guilty of malice, oppression or fraud. (Smith v. Superior Court
(1992) 10 Cal. App. 4th 1033, 1042.)¿ The basis for punitive damages must be
pled with specificity; conclusory allegations devoid of any factual assertions
are insufficient. (Ibid.)¿¿“Malice” is defined in Civ. Code, § 3294
(c)(1) as “conduct which is intended by the defendant to cause injury” or
“despicable conduct which is carried on by the defendant with a willful and
conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” “Oppression” is defined
as “despicable conduct subjecting a person to cruel and unjust hardship in
conscious disregard of that person’s rights.” (Civ. Code §, 3294(c)(2).) The
term “despicable” has been defined in the case law as actions that are “base,”
“vile,” or “contemptible.” (Shade Foods, Inc. v. Innovative Products Sales
& Marketing, Inc. (2000) 78 Cal.App.4th 847, 891.) Fraud means “an
intentional misrepresentation, deceit, or concealment of a material fact known
to the defendant with the intention on the part of the defendant of thereby
depriving a person of property or legal rights or otherwise causing injury.”
(Civ. Code, § 3294(c)(3). When the defendant is a¿corporation, “the oppression,
fraud, or malice must be perpetrated, authorized, or knowingly ratified by an
officer, director, or managing agent of the¿corporation.” (Wilson v.
Southern California Edison Company (2015) 234 Cal.App.4th 123, 164; see
Civ. Code, § 3294(b).)
 
Here, the Complaint alleges
that Plaintiff was a tenant that moved into the Rental Unit located on a property
in Los Angeles, CA (the “Property”) on or about April 5, 2023. (Compl., ¶ 20.)
Defendant Braham is the owner of the Property, including the Rental Unit. (Id.,
¶ 12.) 
Defendant Johnson was the
former owner of the Property, is an associate and agent of Defendant Braham,
and assisted in the management of the Rental Unit. (Id., ¶¶ 12, 21.)
Since the time Plaintiff moved into the Rental Unit, Defendant Braham began to
harass Plaintiff by making unwelcome advances toward Plaintiff “including
inviting her into his home and making promises to move Plaintiff to a larger
unit.” (Id., ¶ 22.) The Complaint alleges the harassment intensified due
to Plaintiff’s rebuffing these advances. (Ibid.) This included shouting
at Plaintiff in front of her children on multiple occasions. (Id., ¶
67.) Plaintiff received a Civil Harassment Restraining Order against Defendant
Braham in July 2023. (Id., ¶ 68.) 
 
Since April 13, 2023, the
Rental Unit lacked heating and Defendant Braham attempted to bar Los Angeles
Housing Department (“LAHD”) inspectors from accessing the Property for
inspection. (Compl., ¶ 28.) Beginning on August 15, 2023, Defendant Braham shut
off all power to the Rental Unit rendering it uninhabitable for about one
month. (Id., ¶ 35.) When Plaintiff complained about the washer and dryer
hookups being unusable according to the gas company, instead of fixing said
issues, “on or about October 23, 2023, Defendant Braham threatened to remove
Plaintiff and her children from their home if she did not get rid of the
washing machine and dryer in three days.” (Id., ¶ 50.) 
 
Defendant Braham tried to evict
Plaintiff and her children in retaliation for Plaintiff making a  complaint to LAHD regarding the lack of heat
and hot water. (Compl., ¶ 52.) “On or about April 12, 2023, only days after
Plaintiff moved into the Rental Unit, Defendant Braham issued a 30-Day Notice
to Vacate attempting to terminate Plaintiff’s tenancy.” (Id., ¶ 53.)
Defendant Braham also filed an Unlawful Detainer action against Plaintiff (LASC
Case No. 23STUD04269) seeking to recover possession of the Rental Unit despite
Plaintiff not being in default of the payment of rent. (Id., ¶¶ 54-56.) 
In April and May of 2023,
Defendant Braham orally informed Plaintiff that he would not accept further
rent payments and that Plaintiff had to vacate the unit within 60 days.
(Compl., ¶¶ 58, 59.) “Yet, on or about August 7, 2023, Defendant Braham
demanded that Plaintiff pay rent for May through August of 2023 within three
days or get out.” (Id., ¶ 59.) “On or about September 16, 2023,
Defendant Braham again demanded Plaintiff pay rent for June through August of
2023 within three days or face immediate eviction.” (Id., ¶ 61.) 
 
In April 2023, Defendant Braham
repeatedly misrepresented that Plaintiff must vacate the Rental Unit and that a
sheriff would be coming any day to lock her and her children out of the home.
(Compl., ¶ 64.) In May of 2023, Defendant Braham illegally locked Plaintiff out
of the Rental Unity by changing the locks and telling Plaintiff she was
trespassing. (Id., ¶ 65.) Defendant Braham also threatened to report
Plaintiff to child protective services by falsely alleging Plaintiff left the
children home alone. (Id., 70.) Defendant Braham’s conduct was intended
to entice Plaintiff to vacate the unit and cause Plaintiff emotional distress.
(Id., ¶¶ 70, 71, 118.) 
 
Based on these allegations, the
court finds that Plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts to find that Defendant
Braham acted with malice or oppression by engaging in conduct with a willful
and conscious disregard to her rights as a tenant by repeatedly harassing and
threatening Plaintiff with unlawful eviction and false reporting Plaintiff to
child protective services in order to get Plaintiff to vacate the Rental Unit. 
 
However, the court finds that
Plaintiff has failed to allege facts to show that Defendant Johnson as a
co-owner or agent of Defendant perpetrated, authorized, or knowingly ratified
Defendant Braham’s conduct. The Complaint is devoid of factual allegations to
support the finding that Defendant Johnson had notice of the need for various
repairs to the Unit and acted intentionally in not making repairs. That
Defendant Johnson was grossly negligent in undertaking repairs is also
insufficient to show that acted intentionally. “Mere negligence, even gross
negligence, is not sufficient to justify such an award” for punitive damages. (Kendall
Yacht Corp. v. United California Bank (1975) 50 Cal.App.3d 949, 958.)
Therefore, the motion to strike as to Defendant Johnson is granted with leave
to amend. 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendants’ motion to strike is
granted with leave to amend as to Defendant Johnson and denied as to Defendant
Braham. Plaintiff is granted 10 days leave to amend. The court sets the OSC RE:
Amended Complaint for November 29, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. Moving party to give
notice.
