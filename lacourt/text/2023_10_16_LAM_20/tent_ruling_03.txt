BACKGROUND
            This is a habitability action
brought by plaintiffs Jason Konopisos and Tara Norris (“Plaintiff”), both
tenants, against Ark Wong (“Defendant”), the alleged owner, operator, agent,
and/or property manager of the premises where they reside. The complaint asserts
causes of action for (1) private nuisance; (2) negligence; (3) breach of
warranty of habitability; (4) breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing;
(5) breach of implied covenant of quiet enjoyment; (6) violation of Civil Code
§ 1942.4; and (7) violation of Civil Code § 1942.5; and (8) intentional
infliction of emotional distress.
            On January 4, 2023, Plaintiff served
Form Interrogatories, Set One, Special Interrogatories, Set One, and Request
for Production of Documents, Set One on Defendant. (Tapanian Declaration Re:
Form Rogs, Special Rogs, and RPDs ¶ 3 and Exhibit A.)
            On June 21, 2023, Plaintiff moved to
compel further responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One. On June 23, 2023,
Plaintiff moved to compel further responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One
and Request for Production of Documents, Set One. 
            On October 2, 2023, Defendant filed
oppositions to the three motions.
            On October 9, 2023, Plaintiff filed
replies.
DISCUSSION
Applicable
Law
CCP §2030.300(a) authorizes a party propounding interrogatories to move
for an order compelling a further response if that party deems that “[a]n
answer to a particular interrogatory is evasive or incomplete,” “[a]n exercise of the option to produce documents under Section
2030.230 is unwarranted or the required specification of those documents is
inadequate,” or “[a]n objection to an interrogatory is without merit or
too general.”
CCP §2031.310(a) authorizes the demanding
party to move for an
order compelling a further response to the demand if the demanding party deems
that: “[a] statement of compliance with the demand is incomplete;” “[a]
representation of inability to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive;”
or “[a]n objection in the response is without merit or too general.”
 “Although the
scope of civil discovery is broad, it is not limitless.  [M]atters are
subject to discovery if the matter either is itself admissible in evidence or
appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible
evidence.  The burden rests upon the party seeking the discovery to
provide evidence from which the court may determine these conditions are
met.”  (Calcor Space Facility, Inc. v. Superior Court (1997)
53 Cal.App.4th 216, 223.)  A party seeking to compel production of
documents must “set forth specific facts showing good cause
justifying the discovery sought.”  (Id., emphasis added.) 
“[F]actual evidence is supplied to the court by way of declarations.” (Id. (motion
to compel properly denied where justifications for the motion were based on
mere generalities presented in arguments.) As to interrogatories, the
responding party has the burden of justifying the objections. (Coy v. Super. Ct. (1962) 58 Cal.2d 210,
220-221.)
 
Application
to Facts
(1)          
Form Interrogatories (Set One)
At issue are Nos. 2.2
– 2.7, 2.12 –2.13, 12.1 – 12.7, 13.1, 16.1—16.3, and 16-7 – 16.8. 
Nos.
2.3-2.4, 2.6, 2.12-2.13, 12.1-12.7, 13.1, 16.1-16.3, 16.7
These
interrogatories refer to “incident.”  Defendant
objects that they are vague and ambiguous regarding the term “incident.” Plaintiff
asserts that “incident” refers to the facts and circumstances that gave rise to
all eight of Plaintiff’s habitability causes of action, and the relevant
statutory period is four years prior to Plaintiff filing her complaint. In opposition,
Defendant argues that given the scope of Plaintiff’s allegations, absent a
clear definition, Defendant must speculate as to the information sought,
particularly considering that there are eight causes of action asserted based
on alleged events that span approximately a ten-year period.
Defendant further objects
to interrogatories 2.3, 2.4, 2.6, and 2.12-2.13 on the grounds of privacy and
privilege. Defendant has not justified these objections. 
The motion is GRANTED.
Plaintiff has sufficiently clarified “incident.” 
Nos.
2.2, 2.5. and 2.7
These interrogatories
ask, in the following order, (1) the date and place of Defendant’s birth; (2)
the place of Defendant’s residence; and (3) Defendant’s educational background.
Defendant objects
that the interrogatories seek irrelevant information that is not reasonably
calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. Defendant also
objects that the interrogatories violate Plaintiff’s privacy and that they seek
privileged information.  Plaintiff moves
to compel further on the ground that Defendant did not provide a full and
complete response to Plaintiff’s request, and Plaintiff is unable to obtain the
requested information from another source. Plaintiff argues that relevance is
presumed because these interrogatories are based on judicial council forms. Plaintiff
further argues that the disclosure of the names and addresses of potential
witnesses is a routine and essential part of pretrial discovery, citing People
v. Dixon (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 414, 443. Contrary to what Plaintiff
argues, relevance is not presumed from the use of judicial council forms;
Plaintiff cites to no authority in support and none exists. The information is
not relevant and not reasonably likely to lead to the discovery of admissible
evidence given the claims alleged in the Complaint.
The motion is
DENIED for 2.2, 2.5, and 2.7. 

(2)          
Special Interrogatories (Set One)
At issue here are Special
Interrogatories Nos. 2 – 4, 11, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25 – 32, and
42-43. 
            Nos. 2 – 4, 11, 15, 17, 19, 21,
23, 25, 28–32, 42 – 43
Plaintiff moves to compel further on the ground that Defendant’s
responses do not identify which documents or categories of documents are
responsive, but rather produced documents labeled 000001-000246. For example,
special interrogatory number 28 is about asbestos at the subject property, and
Defendant contends that all documents are responsive, but 000030 to 000032 is an
email chain about plumbing issues. (Separate Statement, pg. 60.)  Defendant disagrees that he has not
sufficiently identified the documents. 
The motion is GRANTED. 
            No. 26
            This interrogatory asks when the subject property was
originally constructed. 
            Defendant states that the information sought is
irrelevant, the interrogatory constitutes a misuse of the discovery process,
and the information is equally available to Plaintiff by reviewing public
records on file with the City of Los Angeles. Plaintiff moves to compel further
on the ground that Defendant did not provide a full and complete response, and
Plaintiff is unable to obtain the requested information from another source. In
opposition , Defendant argues that he has directed Plaintiff to where the
information can be obtained and that it is not his obligation to conduct his own
independent search of the City of Los Angeles records. Defendant does not
justify his other objections. However, abuse of the discovery process is not a
valid objection. Defendant cites to no authority, and none exists for the
notion that abuse of the discovery process is a valid objection.
            The motion is DENIED. Information in recorded public
documents is readily available to both sides; a party cannot be required to
search public records, compile search results, and furnish them to an opposing
party. (Alpine Mut. Water Co. v. Super. Ct. (1968) 259 Cal.App.2d 45,
54.) 
            No. 27
This interrogatory asks to describe any instances the subject
property was renovated. 
Defendant states that the interrogatory seeks irrelevant
information not calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence,
constitutes a misuse of the discovery process, and the information is equally
available to Plaintiff by reviewing public records on file with the City of Los
Angeles. Plaintiff moves to compel further on the ground that Defendant did not
provide a full and complete response, and Plaintiff is unable to obtain the
requested information from another source. In opposition , Defendant argues
that Plaintiff did not define “renovation” as requested and described how past
work on the apartment building unrelated to the conditions alleged in their
complaint could lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. Further, the
interrogatory does not provide a time period. Defendant refers Plaintiff to
records on file with the City of Los Angeles to obtain any permits and plans
concerning the apartment building.
The motion is DENIED. Information in recorded public documents is
readily available to both sides; a party cannot be required to search public
records, compile search results, and furnish them to an opposing party. (Alpine
Mut. Water Co. v. Super. Ct. (1968) 259 Cal.App.2d 45, 54.) If Plaintiff
needs further information after searching public records, Plaintiff is to
clarify “renovation” and explain why past work on the apartment building
unrelated to the alleged conditions leads to the discovery of admissible
evidence.  
 
(3)          
Request for Production of Documents (Set One)
At issue here are RFP Nos. 1-5, 9-10, and
15-20.
            Nos. 1-5, 9-10, 15, 17
Plaintiff moves to compel further on the ground that Defendant’s
responses do not identify which documents or categories of documents are
responsive, but rather produced documents labeled 000001-000246. Defendant
disagrees that he has not sufficiently identified the documents. 
The motion is GRANTED. 
            No. 16
This request asks for documents evidencing any
fictitious business name statements filed by Defendant in the last 10 years. 
In response to RFP No. 16, Defendant states that
he produced document no. 179. 
This motion is DENIED. 
            No. 18
This request asks for documents filed with any government entity
or agency evidencing any corporation in which Defendant is any officer,
director, and/or shareholder. 
Defendant objects that the request is overly broad and seeks irrelevant
information, infringes on Defendant’s privacy, and constitutes an abuse of the
discovery process. Plaintiff argues that the information will help her evaluate
Defendant’s financial condition, which is at issue because of Plaintiff’s
punitive damages claim. Plaintiff also argues that it will help Plaintiff
evaluate Defendant’s education and skill set, which is relevant to determine
Defendant’s knowledge as a landlord. Defendant argues that Civil Code section
3295, subdivision (c) requires Plaintiff to obtain a court order to permit
pretrial discovery of Defendant’s financial condition. Defendant does not justify
his other objections. 
The motion is DENIED because the request is overbroad as to time,
scope and subject matter. 
            No. 19
This request asks for documents filed with any government entity
or agency evidencing any limited liability company in which Defendant is a
member, officer, and/or manager.
Defendant objects that the request is overly broad and seeks
irrelevant information, infringes on Defendant’s privacy, and constitutes an
abuse of the discovery process. Plaintiff argues that the information will help
her evaluate whether another entity may be needed to amend into the case as a
defendant and will help Plaintiff evaluate Defendant’s education and skill set,
which is relevant to determine Defendant’s knowledge as a landlord. Defendant
argues that Plaintiff is really asking about Defendant’s financial condition,
and Civil Code section 3295, subdivision (c) requires Plaintiff to obtain a
court order to permit pretrial discovery of Defendant’s financial condition.
Defendant does not justify his other objections. 
The motion is DENIED because the request is overbroad and not
reasonably limited as to time, scope and subject matter given the allegations
raised in the complaint.    
            No. 20
This request asks for all documents filed with any government
entity or agency evidencing any partnership in which Defendant is a partner. 
Defendant objects that the request is overly broad and seeks
irrelevant information, infringes on Defendant’s privacy, and constitutes an
abuse of the discovery process. Plaintiff argues that the information will help
her evaluate whether another entity may be needed to amend into the case as a
defendant and will help Plaintiff evaluate Defendant’s education and skill set,
which is relevant to determine Defendant’s knowledge as a landlord. Defendant
argues that Plaintiff is really asking about Defendant’s financial condition,
and Civil Code section 3295, subdivision (c) requires Plaintiff to obtain a
court order to permit pretrial discovery of Defendant’s financial condition.
Defendant does not justify his other objections. 
The motion is DENIED because the request is overbroad and not
reasonably limited as to time, scope and subject matter given the allegations
raised in the complaint.    
 
(4)          
Monetary Sanctions
The applicable
statutes (CCP §§2030.300(d) and 2031.310(h)) contain similar language mandating
the imposition of sanctions “against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel further response . . . unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”
            “[T]he burden is on the moving party to show (by
declarations) the facts essential to an award of sanctions: e.g., the opposing
party's failure to make discovery, reasonable efforts to resolve the matter
informally, etc. The burden then shifts to the party against whom sanctions are
being sought to establish some excuse or justification for the conduct in
question.”  (Weil &
Brown, Cal. Practice Guide:  Civ. Pro.
Before Trial (The Rutter Group June 2021 Update) ¶
8:2015.)
            Here,
Plaintiff requests monetary sanctions of $4,122.50 in connection with Form Interrogatories,
Set One; $3,960 in connection with the motion re: Special Interrogatories, Set
One; and $3,635.00 in connection with the motion re: Request for Production of
Documents, Set One. Defendant requests monetary sanctions of $2,520 in
connection with Form Interrogatories, Set One; $2,160 in connection with the
motion re: Special Interrogatories, Set One; and $2,160 in connection with the
motion re: Request for Production of Documents, Set One.  
            Sanctions
are not warranted because each motion has been granted in part and denied in
part. 
CONCLUSION
The Motion to Compel Further Responses to Requests
for Production of Documents, Set One is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part.
The Motion to Compel Further Responses to
Special Interrogatories, Set One is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part.
The Motion to Compel Further Responses to
Form Interrogatories, Set One is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part.

Nos.

Request for Production of Documents (Set One)
At issue here are RFP Nos. 1-5, 9-10, and
15-20.
            Nos. 1-5, 9-10, 15, 17
Plaintiff moves to compel further on the ground that Defendant’s
responses do not identify which documents or categories of documents are
responsive, but rather produced documents labeled 000001-000246. Defendant
disagrees that he has not sufficiently identified the documents. 
The motion is GRANTED. 
            No. 16
This request asks for documents evidencing any
fictitious business name statements filed by Defendant in the last 10 years. 
In response to RFP No. 16, Defendant states that
he produced document no. 179. 
This motion is DENIED. 
            No. 18
This request asks for documents filed with any government entity
or agency evidencing any corporation in which Defendant is any officer,
director, and/or shareholder. 
Defendant objects that the request is overly broad and seeks irrelevant
information, infringes on Defendant’s privacy, and constitutes an abuse of the
discovery process. Plaintiff argues that the information will help him evaluate
Defendant’s financial condition, which is at issue because of Plaintiff’s
punitive damages claim. Plaintiff also argues that it will help Plaintiff

The motion is DENIED because the request is overbroad as to time, scope,
and subject matter. 
            No. 19
This request asks for documents filed with any government entity
or agency evidencing any limited liability company in which Defendant is a
member, officer, and/or manager.
Defendant objects that the request is overly broad and seeks
irrelevant information, infringes on Defendant’s privacy, and constitutes an
abuse of the discovery process. Plaintiff argues that the information will help
her evaluate whether another entity may be needed to amend into the case as a
defendant and will help Plaintiff evaluate Defendant’s education and skill set,
which is relevant to determine Defendant’s knowledge as a landlord. Defendant
argues that Plaintiff is really asking about Defendant’s financial condition,
and Civil Code section 3295, subdivision (c) requires Plaintiff to obtain a
court order to permit pretrial discovery of Defendant’s financial condition.
Defendant does not justify his other objections. 
The motion is DENIED because the request is overbroad and not
reasonably limited as to time, scope, and subject matter given the allegations
raised in the complaint.    
            No. 20

Monetary Sanctions
The applicable
statutes (CCP §§2030.300(d) and 2031.310(h)) contain similar language mandating
the imposition of sanctions “against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel further response . . . unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”
            “[T]he burden is on the moving party to show (by
declarations) the facts essential to an award of sanctions: e.g., the opposing
party's failure to make discovery, reasonable efforts to resolve the matter
informally, etc. The burden then shifts to the party against whom sanctions are
being sought to establish some excuse or justification for the conduct in
question.”  (Weil &
Brown, Cal. Practice Guide:  Civ. Pro.
Before Trial (The Rutter Group June 2021 Update) ¶
8:2015.)

in connection with Form Interrogatories, Set One; $2,160 in connection with the
motion re: Special Interrogatories, Set One; and $2,160 in connection with the
