And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling grants the defendants' motion to quash the subpoena for the plaintiff's tax records. The defendants argued that the records are shielded from disclosure by the tax privilege and that the plaintiff has not established a basis to obtain the records. The court found that the tax privilege applies and that the plaintiff has not shown that the defendants have waived their right to assert the privilege. The court also found that the plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions is denied.

The court granted the defendants' motion to quash, but denied their motion for a protective order, which was deemed moot. The court ordered the defendants to give notice of the ruling.
