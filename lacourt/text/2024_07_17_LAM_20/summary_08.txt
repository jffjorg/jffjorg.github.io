And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the defendants in the case of Olataga Pele v. City of Gardena, Gardena Police Department, and Doe Officer. The plaintiff claims that the defendants are liable for the death of De'Andre Shepard, Jr., who was killed in a car accident during a police pursuit.

The Court has sustained the demurrer filed by the Doe Officer, finding that the officer is immune from liability under Vehicle Code § 17004. The Court has also sustained the demurrer filed by the defendant Gardena Police Department as to the wrongful death claim, finding that the police department is not a separate and independent entity from the City of Gardena.

However, the Court has overruled the demurrer filed by the remaining defendants as to the negligence, negligent supervision, and survival claims. The Court finds that the plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts to support these claims and that discovery may be necessary to determine the merits of the case.

The Court has also granted the motion to strike filed by the defendant Gardena Police Department, finding that the police department is not a separate and independent entity from the City of Gardena.

The parties are directed to submit written responses to the tentative ruling and to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
