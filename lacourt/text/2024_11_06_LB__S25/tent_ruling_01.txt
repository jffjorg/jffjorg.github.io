  Case Number:  23LBCV00132    Hearing Date:   November 6, 2024    Dept:  S25 Procedural BackgroundOn January 23, 2023, Plaintiff Tolani Lawal, through her Guardian ad Litem Vanyel Lawrence, as a wrongful death beneficiary of Decedent Ayomipo Oluwatobi Lawal filed a complaint against Defendants City of Long Beach, County of Los Angeles, David Anthony Jones and Does 1 through 100. Plaintiff alleges two causes of action: (1) negligence/wrongful death and (2) dangerous condition of public property. On February 18, 2022, at or around 7:40 am at the intersection of Oregon Avenue and 17th Street in the City of Long Beach a collision occurred between a bicycle ridden by Ayomipo Lawal (“Decedent”) and a City-owned vehicle driven by Defendant and City employee David Anthony Jones (“Defendant Jones”); Defendant Jones was working within the course and scope of his employment at the time of incident. (Compl., ¶¶ 3, 6, 12-15). Decedent died because of his injuries and Plaintiff Tolani Lawal is his heir. (Exh. A, Government Claim, p. 3; Exh. B, Compl., ¶¶ 1-3, 6, 12-15; Zinger Decl., ¶¶ 4-15.) On June 11, 2024, the Court denied Defendants’ motion for summary judgment. (June 11, 2024 Minute Order – Ruling on Submitted Matter.) On June 28, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Notice of Settlement.Legal Standard“The guardian or conservator of the estate or guardian ad litem so appearing for any minor, person who lacks legal capacity to make decisions . . . has been appointed shall have power, with the approval of the court in which the action or proceeding is pending, to compromise the same, to agree to the order or judgment to be entered therein for or against the ward or conservatee, and to satisfy any judgment or order in favor of the ward or conservatee or release or discharge any claim of the ward or conservatee pursuant to that compromise.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 372, subd. (a)(3).) “A petition for court approval of a compromise of, or a covenant not to sue or enforce judgment on, a minor's disputed claim; a compromise or settlement of a pending action or proceeding to which a minor or person with a disability is a party; or the disposition of the proceeds of a judgment for a minor or person with a disability under Probate Code sections 3500 and 3600-3613 or Code of Civil Procedure section 372 must be verified by the petitioner and must contain a full disclosure of all information that has any bearing upon the reasonableness of the compromise, covenant, settlement, or disposition. Except as provided in rule 7.950.5, the petition must be submitted on a completed Petition for Approval of Compromise of Claim or Action or Disposition of Proceeds of Judgment for Minor or Person With a Disability (form MC-350).” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.950.)A court approving a minor and/or person with a disability’s compromise will order and direct payment of reasonable expenses – including attorney’s fees out of the total settlement amount. (Prob. Code, § 3601.) Under Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.955(a)(1), the Court “must use a reasonable fee standard when approving and allowing the amount of attorney’s fees payable from money or property paid or to be paid for the benefit of a minor or a person with a disability.” Also, the court must give weight to the terms of any existing representation agreement. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.955(a)(2).) Other non-exclusive factors to consider include: (1) the fact that a person with a disability is involved, and her particular circumstances; (2) the length and nature of representation; and (3) the time and labor required. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.955(b)(1-14).) “The rule permits, but does not require, the court to allow attorney’s fees in an amount specified in a contingency fee agreement. The amount of attorney’s fees allowed by the court must meet the reasonableness standard of section 3601 no matter how they are determined.” (Advisory Com. Comment to rule 7.955.)AnalysisThe Court has reviewed the proposed settlement and finds that the settlement itself is fair and reasonable. The minor claimant here, Tolani Lawal, has agreed to dismiss her claims and will receive $50,000.00 from Defendants City of Long Beach and David Anthony Jones (“Defendants”). (Pet. ¶ 10.) No other settlement payments are also being made to any person other than the claimant to settle claims arising out of the same incident or accident that resulted in the claimant’s injury. (Pet., ¶ 11.a.)The amount of attorney’s fees requested, represents 25 percent of the gross settlement to minor claimant, is $12,500.00. (See Pet., ¶ 13.a; Attachment 13a [Attorney Fee Declaration] ¶ 30.) The Claimant, through her parent and Guardian ad litem, Vanyel Lawrence, agreed to a 45 percent contingency fee arrangement at any time after a lawsuit is filed. (See Attachment 17.a [Retainer Agreement and Agreement and Consent and Authorization to Associate Co-Counsel] at pp. 1 and 3.) In relevant part, the retainer agreement provides:“At any time within sixty (60) days of execution of this agreement by Client, Client shall pay Law Firm as its fee the sum of Thirty-Three and One Third Percent (33 1/3%) of any recovery obtained. At any time after sixty (60) days of execution of this agreement by Client, Client shall pay Law Firm as its fee the sum of Forty Percent (40%) of any recovery obtained. Atany time after a lawsuit or demand of arbitration is filed, Client shall pay Law Firm as its fee the sum of Forty-Five Percent (45%) of any recovery obtained.”(Attachment 17.a at pp. 1 and 3 [“THE ATTORNEYS’ FEES PAID BY CLIENT ARE NOT INCREASED BY THIS ASSOCIATION”].) The petition further seeks $13,225.75 to pay costs other than medical expenses. (Pet. ¶ 13.b; Attachment 13.b at p. 2.) Costs and litigation expenses are provided for under Retainer Agreement. (See Attachment 17.a at p. 1.) After payment of all fees and expenses, Claimant is left with a balance of $24,274.25.Tentative RulingThe Court finds that Plaintiff’s counsel has set forth sufficient facts breaking down and explaining the legal fees and costs incurred in litigating this matter. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.955(b).) The Court approves the instant petition approve minor’s compromise and to deposit funds in blocked account.
