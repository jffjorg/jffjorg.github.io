Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel the defendant to respond to interrogatories and requests for production. The defendant has failed to respond to the plaintiff's discovery requests, despite multiple attempts by the plaintiff's counsel to obtain a response. The judge has ordered the defendant to provide objection-less responses to the interrogatories and requests for production within 20 days of the hearing. The judge has also declined to award monetary sanctions against the defendant in this instance, but warned that further failure to respond to discovery requests may result in future monetary sanctions.

The judge has also granted the plaintiff's motion to deem admitted the truth of the matters specified in the requests for admissions. The defendant has failed to respond to the requests for admissions, despite multiple attempts by the plaintiff's counsel to obtain a response. The judge has awarded monetary sanctions of $2,450.00 in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant and defendant's counsel jointly, payable within 30 days of the order.
