  Case Number:  23NWCV02826    Hearing Date:   December 23, 2024    Dept:  C This
breach of contract action was filed on September 7, 2023. Trial is currently
scheduled to begin on August 4, 2025. Defendants Lexington Insurance Company
and Western World Insurance Company’s (“Defendants”) Motion to Compel
Plaintiff’s Further Responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One and Motion to
Compel Plaintiff’s Further Responses to Request for Production, Set One
(collectively, “Motions”) are currently scheduled to be heard after trial, on
October 8, 2025. Defendants now move ex parte for an order specially setting
hearing dates on Defendants’ Motions to a date between January 27, 2025, and
March 3, 2025. Alternatively, Defendants seek a four-month trial continuance so
that the Motions may be heard before trial. 
 
In
opposition, Plaintiff argues that Defendants’ ex parte application was untimely
filed, and the Motions are frivolous after Plaintiff filed supplemental
responses on December 19, 2024. Defendants’ ex parte application was
electronically filed at 8:31 a.m. on December 20, 2024, and is therefore,
timely. Defendants additionally seek to proceed to have the Motions heard
despite Plaintiff’s supplemental responses. (Parker Decl., ¶ 8.)
 
Defendants’
ex parte application to specially set hearing dates on the Motions is GRANTED.
The hearings on the Motions on October 8, 2025, are ADVANCED to today’s
date and CONTINUED to May 7, 2025 at 10:30 a.m. in Dept. SE-C.
Opposition and Reply to be filed and served per Code in accordance with the new
hearing date. Based on the foregoing, Defendants’ alternative request to
continue the trial date is DENIED. Moving party to give notice.
