And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the defendants' ex parte application to stay proceedings pending their motion to compel arbitration. The defendants argued that there is good cause to stay proceedings because the plaintiffs have noticed multiple depositions, while the plaintiffs argued that the defendants have also propounded discovery and failed to state good cause. The judge will exercise its discretion to stay proceedings while the motion to compel arbitration is under submission.
