On November 7, 2024, the Court heard Defendants Rivera Sanatarium, Inc, Colonial Gardens Nursing Home, and Kent Stephens’ (Defendants) Petition to Compel Arbitration and Motion for Stay. The Court took the matter under submission. Defendants now move ex parte for an Order Staying Pending Proceedings, or in the alternative, for an Order Staying Proceedings Pending a Noticed Motion for Stay of Proceedings herein. Defendants argue good cause exists because Plaintiffs have noticed multiple depositions. In opposition, Plaintiffs note Defendants have also propounded discovery on Plaintiffs and have failed to state good cause. Defendants’ ex parte application for an Order Staying Pending Proceedings, or in the alternative, for an Order Staying Proceedings Pending a Noticed Motion for Stay of Proceedings is GRANTED.  The Court will exercise its discretion to stay proceedings while the motion to compel arbitration is under submission.  Moving party to give notice.
