```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has taken the two motions off calendar and Bank of America remains dismissed without prejudice. The court lacks the authority to take any action on the dismissal because a voluntary dismissal as of an entire cause of action deprives the court of both subject matter and personal jurisdiction. Even if the court had the authority, it would not grant the dismissal with prejudice because the plaintiff failed to oppose the motion for summary judgment and instead filed a request for dismissal two days after the opposition deadline and 12 days before the hearing on the motion. The court would fall on the side of allowing the dismissal without prejudice, as the plaintiff's right to dismiss without prejudice is not absolute and there are exceptions to Code Civ. Proc., section 581.
