```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has taken the two motions off calendar and Bank of America remains dismissed without prejudice. The court lacks the authority to take any action on the dismissal because a voluntary dismissal as of an entire cause of action deprives the court of both subject matter and personal jurisdiction. Even if the court had the authority, it would not grant the dismissal with prejudice because the plaintiff failed to oppose the motion for summary judgment and instead filed a request for dismissal two days after the opposition deadline and 12 days before the hearing on the motion. The court would fall on the side of allowing the dismissal without prejudice, as the plaintiff's right to dismiss without prejudice is not absolute and there are exceptions to Code Civ. Proc., section 581.

## English Summary:

The judge issued a tentative ruling regarding two motions: one by Plaintiff to amend their complaint, and one by Defendant Bank of America for summary judgment.  

Due to the Plaintiff's request to dismiss the case against Bank of America without prejudice, both motions were initially removed from the calendar. However, Defendant Bank of America objected to the dismissal without prejudice, arguing that it should be with prejudice because it was filed after the Plaintiff's deadline to oppose the summary judgment motion. 

The judge reviewed the relevant case law regarding voluntary dismissals and concluded that the Plaintiff's dismissal was valid. The court reasoned that there had been no formal judicial expression on the merits of the case and that the dismissal was filed before a decision on the summary judgment motion was inevitable. 

Therefore, the court ruled in favor of Plaintiff's request for dismissal without prejudice, meaning the Plaintiff can re-file the case against Bank of America at a later time.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in plain English:

The judge is considering two motions: one from the plaintiff to amend their complaint and add a new cause of action against Bank of America, and one from Bank of America to have the complaint dismissed with prejudice. The plaintiff previously filed a request to dismiss the case without prejudice, which the court granted. However, Bank of America objected to the dismissal without prejudice and asked the court to dismiss the case with prejudice instead.

The judge is considering whether the plaintiff's dismissal without prejudice is valid. The court notes that the plaintiff failed to oppose Bank of America's motion for summary judgment, which was due on September 5, 2023. The plaintiff filed the request for dismissal on September 7, 2023, two days later. The court concludes that the plaintiff's dismissal is invalid because it was filed after the opposition deadline and before the court issued a tentative ruling on the motion for summary judgment.

The court also notes that the plaintiff's dismissal is not absolute and that there are exceptions to the right to voluntary dismissal. The court concludes that the plaintiff's dismissal is ineffective because it was filed too close to the hearing on the motion for summary judgment and because the plaintiff failed to oppose the motion. As a result, the court will not allow the dismissal without prejudice and will take the two motions off calendar.

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling regarding the plaintiff's motion to amend the complaint and the defendant's motion for summary judgment. The plaintiff had requested a dismissal without prejudice, which was granted on September 18, 2023. However, the defendant objected to the dismissal without prejudice, arguing that it should be with prejudice since the plaintiff had failed to oppose the motion for summary judgment. The court considered the issue and determined that it lacked the authority to change the dismissal to with prejudice. Even if the court had the authority, it would not have done so based on the facts presented. The plaintiff's failure to oppose the motion for summary judgment and the timing of the dismissal (12 days before the hearing) were key factors in the court's decision. The court ultimately allowed the dismissal without prejudice, taking the motions off calendar and dismissing Bank of America without prejudice.

Summary:
This tentative ruling is for the case 20STCV37967, set to be heard on September 29, 2023 in Department 78 of the Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles. The plaintiff, Estate of Sumie Cordova, and defendant, Bank of America, appeared in court on September 19, 2023 regarding two motions: a motion for summary judgment filed by Bank of America and a motion for leave to file a second amended complaint. However, these hearings were taken off calendar due to Plaintiff’s dismissal of the case. Plaintiff requested an opportunity to oppose the motion for summary judgment, while Defendant objected to the dismissal of the complaint without prejudice. The court requested briefing on the issue of dismissal without prejudice vs. dismissal with prejudice, as well as briefing on whether Plaintiff should be provided with an opportunity to oppose the motion for summary judgment. Only Defendant Bank of America filed additional briefing. The court lacks the authority to take any action on the dismissal, and even if it had the authority, it would not do so on the facts presented. The court adopts a “mere formality” test, where a voluntary dismissal is ineffective if there has been either (1) a public and formal judicial expression of the merits of a case in the context of a substantively dispositive proceeding or (2) some procedural dereliction by the dismissing plaintiff that made dismissal otherwise inevitable. Here, the first part of the test does not apply, and Plaintiff failed to oppose the motion for summary judgment and instead filed a request for dismissal two days after the opposition deadline and 12 days before the hearing on the motion. Therefore, the court would allow the dismissal without prejudice. The two motions are taken off calendar and Bank of America remains dismissed without prejudice.
