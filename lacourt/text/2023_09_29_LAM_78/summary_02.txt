**English Summary:**

In this case, Universal Pipeline, Inc. (UPI) is suing Elite Earthworks & Engineering for unpaid services. Elite asked the court to force UPI into arbitration instead of going to trial. The judge denied this request because the contract between the parties was unclear about whether they agreed to arbitrate disputes. The judge found that while both parties checked boxes indicating they agreed to both arbitration and litigation, the contract language did not specify a default method in case of ambiguity. Therefore, the judge ruled that litigation is the appropriate way to resolve this dispute.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Defendant Elite Earthworks & Engineering's motions to compel arbitration and stay proceedings. The court found that the parties did not agree to arbitrate disputes, despite having an arbitration agreement in their contract. The contract states that the parties shall resolve disputes through direct discussion and mediation, and if those methods fail, they shall submit to binding dispute resolution procedures, including arbitration and litigation. However, the contract also states that if no default option is selected, litigation shall be the default method of dispute resolution. The court found that the parties checked both boxes for arbitration and litigation, effectively indicating that they did not choose arbitration over litigation. Therefore, the court concluded that the parties did not agree to arbitrate disputes, and the motions to compel arbitration and stay proceedings were denied.

English text:

This tentative ruling relates to Case No. 22STCV39594, scheduled for hearing on September 29, 2023, in the Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles, Department 78. The case concerns a breach of contract, accounts stated, reasonable value, and enforcement of mechanic's lien release bond between UNIVERSAL PIPELINE, INC. (Plaintiff) and ELITE EARTHWORKS & ENGINEERING, et al. (Defendants).

The Judge, Jill Feeney, denies Defendant ELITE EARTHWORKS & ENGINEERING's motions to compel arbitration and stay proceedings. The dispute arose from a written agreement between the parties for installing underground utilities, where Defendant owes Plaintiff $2,311,188.83. Despite direct discussions and mediation, the matter remains unresolved.

The Judge determined that the parties did not agree to arbitrate the dispute, as the contract contained boxes for both arbitration and litigation, which were both checked. The contract also states that if no choice is indicated, litigation is the default method. Therefore, the motion to compel arbitration is denied, and the motion to stay proceedings is also denied.
