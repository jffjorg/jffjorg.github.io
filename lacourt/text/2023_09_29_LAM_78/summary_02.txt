The court noted that the contract between the parties contained ambiguity, but ultimately found that the language of the contract indicated that the parties did not agree to arbitrate disputes. The court also found that the parties did not waive their right to be heard in a court of law. The court's decision is based on the unambiguous language of the contract and the case law cited. The judge, Hon. Jill Feeney, has issued the tentative ruling, which is subject to change after consideration of any further evidence or arguments presented at the hearing.
