  Case Number:  20STCV37967    Hearing Date:   September 29, 2023    Dept:  78 Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles Department 78  ESTATE OF SUMIE CORDOVA, et al.,Plaintiffs, vs.BANK OF AMERICA, et al.,Defendants.  Case No.:  20STCV37967 Hearing Date:  September 29, 2023      [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:  PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR LEAVE TO AMEND SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT; DEFENDANT BANK OF AMERICA’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENTOn September 7, 2023, Plaintiff filed a request for dismissal of Defendant Bank of America without prejudice. Due to the Court being dark, the dismissal was entered on September 18, 2023.On September 19, 2023, both Plaintiff and Defendant Bank of America appeared in Court. Two motions had been set for hearing that day, a motion for summary judgment filed by Bank of America and a motion for leave to file a second amended complaint to add a cause of action against Bank of America to the complaint. At that time, the Court noted that the two hearings were taken off calendar due Plaintiff’s dismissal of the case.Defendant objected to the dismissal of the complaint without prejudice and asked that the complaint be dismissed with prejudice as the dismissal was filed after Plaintiff’s time to file an opposition to the motion for summary judgment had passed.Plaintiff requested that if the Court was going to dismiss the case with prejudice that he instead be provided with an opportunity to oppose the motion for summary judgment.The Court asked both sides for briefing on the issue of dismissal without prejudice vs. dismissal without prejudice, as well as briefing on the issue of whether Plaintiff should be provided with an opportunity to oppose the motion for summary judgment.Only Defendant Bank of America filed additional briefing. A voluntary dismissal as of an entire cause of action deprives the court of both subject matter and personal jurisdiction. (Bank of America, N.A. V. Mitchell (2012) 204 Cal.App.4th 1199, 1209.) A court does not even have jurisdiction to change a dismissal without prejudice to one with prejudice. (Harris v. Gillings (1993) 16 Cal.App.4th 1396, 1405.) So here, the Court lacks the authority to take any action. However, even if the Court had the authority to take action, it would not do so on the facts presented here.Plaintiff’s opposition to the motion for summary judgment was due on September 5, 2023. Plaintiff filed the request for dismissal two days later on September 7, 2023. No tentative decision on the motion was ever issued.The right to voluntary dismissal is not absolute. Exceptions to Code Civ. Proc., section 581 exist where an action has proceeded to a determinative adjudication, or to a decision that is tantamount to an adjudication. (Mary Morgan, Inc. v. Melzark (1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 765.) For example, a plaintiff may not dismiss a defendant if there is a pending motion for summary judgment, the hearing on the motion has already commenced, and the court has already issued a tentative ruling. (Id at p. 257.) A voluntary dismissal would be valid if a motion for summary judgment was pending but the plaintiff dismissed the moving defendant prior to the date the opposition was due and before the court issued a tentative ruling. (Zapata v. Universal Care, Inc. (2003) 107Cal.App.4th 1167, 1173-1174.) A dismissal would be ineffective if the granting of a motion for summary judgment is a legal inevitability. (Cravens v. State Bd. of Equalization (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 253, 256.) For example, a dismissal is ineffective if it is filed the day before a hearing on a motion for summary judgment and a plaintiff has not opposed the motion. (Id at p.257.) Synthesizing these cases, the courts have adopted a “mere formality” test, where a voluntary dismissal is ineffective if there has been either (1) a public and formal judicial expression of the merits of a case in the context of a substantively dispositive proceeding or (2) some procedural dereliction by the dismissing plaintiff that made dismissal otherwise inevitable. (Cole v. Hammond (2019) 37 Cal.App.5th 912, 922 (citing Franklin Capital Corp. v. Wilson (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 187).) Legal inevitability is key to the second part of the test, meaning a dismissal is valid where a case has not yet reached a stage where a final disposition is a mere formality. (Id at pp.923-924.)The first part of the mere formality test does not apply here because the Court has not issued a public and formal judicial expression of the merits of the case. With respect to the second part, Plaintiff failed to oppose the motion for summary judgment and instead filed a request for dismissal two days after the opposition deadline and 12 days before the hearing on the motion. No tentative decision was reached by the Court.Here, unlike the voluntary dismissal at issue in Cravens, which was filed the day before the hearing, Plaintiff’s dismissal was filed 12 days before the hearing on the motion for summary judgment. In the end “[w]hether plaintiff’s ‘absolute’ right to dismiss without prejudice is cutoff before the court actually rules on a demurrer or a motion for summary judgment is unsettled.” (Weil & Brown, Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2023) ¶ 11:25.) (emphasis in the original) Based on dictum in Wells v. Marina City Properties, Inc. (1981) 29 Cal.3d 781, 789: (“[W]e note that such right of voluntary dismissal . .  . would also not be impaired prior to a decision sustaining the demurrer”), and the facts here, the Court would fall on the side of allowing the dismissal without prejudice.The two motions are taken off calendar and Bank of America remains dismissed without prejudice.
