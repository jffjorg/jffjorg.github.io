And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge sustains the demurrer to the fourth and fifth causes of action for breach of implied warranties, as the complaint does not adequately plead the necessary facts to establish a claim. The judge also sustains the demurrer to the ninth, tenth, and eleventh causes of action for fraud, as the complaint does not adequately plead the necessary facts to establish a claim. The judge concludes that the plaintiff has failed to remedy their fraud claims, which were previously given leave to amend to plead with particularity.
