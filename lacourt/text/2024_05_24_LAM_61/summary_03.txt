Here is the English text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has granted the defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings without leave to amend. The defendant argued that the plaintiff's breach of contract claim does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, as the plaintiff affirmatively disclaims the existence of a contract. The court agrees with the defendant and finds that the plaintiff's breach of contract claim is without merit. Additionally, the court finds that the plaintiff's fraud claim is deficient in that it lacks specificity, failing to allege the misrepresentation upon which the plaintiff relied. The court concludes that permitting leave to amend would be futile, as the plaintiff's opposition fails to provide any basis to believe that the defects in the pleading could be cured by amendment.
