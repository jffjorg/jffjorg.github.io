[1] For the first time
in Reply, Defendant focuses on the “damages” element of fraud. However, as it
was not adequately addressed in the demurrer, it is prejudicial to raise the
new argument in reply. That said, as the court’s analysis will only focus on
the first argument—sufficiency of the pleadings regarding element of
intentional concealment—damages will not be discussed in this ruling.  


[2] Plaintiff provided
an incorrect citation to 84 Cal.App.5th 725, at 728. Also, Defendant’s Reply
does not address Dhital.


[3] For example, to the
extent that Plaintiff claims it has alleged what statements were made by the
dealership (See FAC ¶20 [“Prior to purchase, Plaintiff spoke with the dealer
sales representative about the vehicle, inspected the Monroney sticker posted by
GENERAL MOTORS LLC on the vehicle and test-drove the vehicle”] that allegation
is not found within the 4th COA, and it is not the court’s
obligation to determine what allegations constitute what allegations. 
 


[4] And Plaintiff’s
opposition evidences its failure to abide by pleading practices as it references
allegations before paragraph 127. (See e.g., Opp. p. 6, citing FAC ¶¶ 14-23,
31-68, 69-85.) 
 


[5] See also ¶18 [“In actuality, however,
the 8L90 and 8L45 transmissions deliver anything but “comfort and
drivability[,]” “lightning-fast shifts[,]” and “enhanc[ed] refinement,
particularly during low-speed gear changes.” Plaintiff had no way of knowing about
Defendant’s deception regarding the 8L90 and 8L45 transmissions having a design
defect”; see also ¶40 [“In fact, the Transmission Defect in the 8L90 and 8L45
transmissions causes unsafe conditions, including, but not limited to, the
Subject Vehicle suddenly lurching forward, sudden acceleration, delayed
acceleration, and sudden loss of forward propulsion.”]; ¶42 [“As early as
September 2014, GM knew or should have known that the 8L90 and 8L45
transmissions were defective and that the Transmission Defect would adversely
affect the drivability of vehicles with the 8L90 and 8L45 transmissions and
cause safety hazards.”]; see also ¶43 [“Plaintiff is informed and believe and
based thereon allege that prior to the sale of the Subject Vehicle, GM knew, or
should have known, about the Transmission Defect: (1) because . . . GM service
bulletins applicable to vehicles with the 8L90 and 8L45 transmissions that
acknowledge the Transmission Defect.”].) 
 


[6] Though less particularity is required
when the information is uniquely within the defendant’s knowledge, some
particularity is still required. (Committee On Children’s Television, Inc.
v. General Foods Corp. (1983) 35 Cal.3d 197, 217; see also Opp. p. 1,
quoting Quelimane Co. v. Stewart Title Guaranty Co. (1998) 19 Cal.4th
26, 47, modified (Sept 23, 1998) [“We also note . . . in the pleading of fraud,
the rule is relaxed when it is apparent from the allegations that the defendant
necessarily possesses knowledge of the facts.”].)
