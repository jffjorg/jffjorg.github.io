And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the case and is issuing a tentative ruling. The defendant has raised a new argument in reply, focusing on the "damages" element of fraud, but the judge finds that it is prejudicial to raise this new argument at this stage. The judge will only consider the first argument, which is the sufficiency of the pleadings regarding intentional concealment.

The judge notes that the plaintiff has provided an incorrect citation to 84 Cal.App.5th 725, and that the defendant's reply does not address Dhital.

The judge also finds that the plaintiff's opposition evidences its failure to abide by pleading practices, referencing allegations before paragraph 127.

The judge will not discuss damages in this ruling.
