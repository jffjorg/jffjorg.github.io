[1] The Agreement has
already been recently enforced by this Court against two former employees of
Defendant, in a PAGA-only action pending in Los Angeles County Superior Court,
Salazar v. CPP-City of Industry Cast Parts, Inc., Case No. 21PSCV00014 and
Nunez v. Cast Parts, Inc. DBA Consolidation Precision Products, Case No.
21STCV08428.
 


[2] Thus, Plaintiff’s
predominant reliance on Lacayo v. Catalina Restaurant Group, Inc.
(2019) 38 Cal.App.5th 244, 257-259 is inapposite because the arbitration
agreement used “and/or” whereas here the agreement only uses “and.”   
 


[3] Plaintiff’s heavy
reliance upon Rebolledo v. Tilly’s, Inc. (2014) 228 Cal.App.4th 900, 920
is inapposite as not only the facts involved numerous factual dissimilarities
(i.e., plaintiff there could not speak or read English), but also the agreement(s)
“expressly exclude[d] ‘any matter within the jurisdiction of the California
Labor commissioner.’ ” (Id. at p. 913.) Here, however, the
arbitration agreement does not make any reference to the Labor commissioner’s
jurisdiction regarding labor code violations.
