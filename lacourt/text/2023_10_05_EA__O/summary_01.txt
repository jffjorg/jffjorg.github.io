And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the defendant's motion to compel arbitration of the plaintiff's claims. The plaintiff had brought a PAGA action against the defendant, alleging Labor Code violations. The defendant argued that the arbitration agreement between the parties, which was governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), required the plaintiff to arbitrate his claims individually rather than as a class action. The court found that the arbitration agreement was enforceable and that the claims were covered under the agreement. The court rejected the plaintiff's arguments that the agreement was unconscionable and that it had an express carve out for injunctive and equitable claims related to claims for unfair competition. The court also found that the plaintiff had not demonstrated procedural unconscionability, as there was no evidence of oppression or surprise in the formation and negotiation of the arbitration agreement. The court concluded that the motion to compel arbitration was granted, and the matter is stayed pending arbitration.
