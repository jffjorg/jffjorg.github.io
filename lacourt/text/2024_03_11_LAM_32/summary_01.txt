And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's motion to compel responses to requests for production. The plaintiff, Salvador Suarez, filed this action against Southern California Truck Bodies and Sales, Inc. and Miguel Sanchez, alleging wage violations, unfair business practices, retaliation, and wrongful termination. The defendant has not filed an opposition to the motion, conceding the facts and the merits of the motion. The court finds that the defendant has failed to respond to discovery requests and has not provided sufficient information, despite multiple extensions granted by the plaintiff. As a result, the court grants the motion to compel and orders the defendant to serve responses to the subject requests for production within 15 days. The court also sanctions the defendant and its counsel in the amount of $900, to be paid within 30 days.
