HEARING DATE:   12/14/2023
 

Background
 
This action was commenced on May 7, 2021, when Nancy and
Nolan Bushnell filed a Complaint against Farmers Insurance Exchange, Fire
Insurance Exchange, and Mid-Century Insurance Company (collectively, the
“Insurance Companies”). The case stems from an underlying disagreement on an
insurance policy Plaintiffs owned. Plaintiffs’ filed the operative Third
Amended Complaint (TAC) on May 5, 2023 detailing their causes of action and allegations.
 Defendant Truck Insurance Exchange (“Truck”)
filed two motions: (1) Defendant Truck Insurance Exchange’s Motion to Compel
Nancy Bushnell’s Subsequent Deposition and (2) Defendant Truck Insurance
Exchange’s Motion to Compel Nolan Bushnell’s Subsequent Deposition (the
“Motions”). Each Motion requests monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,058.00.
             
Legal
Standard
 
A motion lies to compel deposition attendance and document
production, after service of a deposition notice, where a deponent fails to
appear at, or proceed with, a deposition, without having served a valid
objection. (CCP §2025.450(a).) Any party that appeared in the action after the
initial deposition concluded may notice another deposition. (CCP
2025.290(b)(6).) No meet and confer is required to compel initial deposition
attendance, but instead there must be a declaration showing that moving party
inquired about the nonappearance. (CCP §2025.450(b)(2).)   
 
“Implicit in the requirement that counsel contact the deponent to
inquire about the nonappearance is a requirement that counsel listen to the
reasons offered and make a good faith attempt to resolve the issue,” including
by rescheduling. (Leko v. Cornerstone Bldg. Inspection Serv. (2001) 86
Cal. App. 4th 1109, 1124. See
also L.A.S.C.L.R. 3.26, Appendix 3.A(e) (reasonable consideration should be
given to accommodating schedules in setting depositions).)  
 
Analysis
 
After Plaintiffs filed their initial Complaint on May 7,
2021, the Insurance Companies deposed Plaintiffs on October 13, 2021. However,
Truck had not been served at that time and therefore, had not appeared in the
matter. (Declaration of Brieanna Dolmage, ¶¶ 2-5.) On March 25, 2022,
Plaintiffs served Truck with the FAC. (Id. at ¶ 5.) After receiving the
SAC and TAC which both added a new fourth cause of action, Truck noticed
Plaintiffs with a Notice of Deposition for a remote deposition to take place on
November 8, 2023. Plaintiffs objected to the notice on October 31, 2023,
arguing that a deposition had already been taken. After meet and confer efforts
failed, Truck filed these Motions. 
 
In their motion, Truck argues that although depositions had
been taken, Truck was not party to the action at that time and that Code of Civil Procedure section
2025.290(b)(6) allows Truck a statutory discovery right to take up to seven
hours of deposition of Plaintiffs.  Plaintiffs
oppose the motions based upon untimeliness, and that Plaintiffs’ age and health
concerns should limit the depositions to three-hour increments. 
 
Although the Motions are untimely pursuant to section 1005, the
Court will conduct the hearing as scheduled. 
Plaintiffs filed oppositions and there would be no violation of due
process in conducting the hearings on December 12, 2023.  (See Carlton v. Quint
(2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 690, 697-698.)
 Furthermore, the Court agrees that Truck
has a statutory right to depose Plaintiffs as outlined in section
2025.290(b)(6). Plaintiffs are willing to appear for the depositions, the issue
is whether Plaintiffs should be forced to sit for a seven-hour deposition.
Plaintiffs’ counsel points out that Nolan Bushnell is 80 years-old and
recovering from a bout with the flu, while Nancy Bushnell is in her 70’s. (See
Opposition Papers, 3:11-13.) It appears from the filings on both sides that
conducting the depositions in three-hour increments is agreeable for both
parties. 
 
Therefore,
the Motions are granted. However, although monetary sanctions are permitted,
the Court exercises its discretion and does not impose any sanctions.  
 
CONCLUSION
 
Accordingly, Defendant Truck’s Motion to Compel Nancy Bushnell’s
Subsequent Deposition and Defendant Truck Insurance Exchange’s Motion to Compel
Nolan Bushnell’s Subsequent Deposition are both GRANTED. The
depositions will occur within 30 days at a mutually agreed upon date, time, and
location.
