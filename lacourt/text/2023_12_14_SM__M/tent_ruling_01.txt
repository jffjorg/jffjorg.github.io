  Case Number:  19SMCV01614    Hearing Date:   December 14, 2023    Dept:  M Singer v. Related California Urban Housing, et al., 19SMCV01614
 
The Court has reviewed the parties supplemental briefs as
well as the January 7, 2022 order of Judge Karlin finding the 170.6 challenge
to Referee Polis moot. 
 
Code of Civil Procedure 170.6 applies to a “party to, or an
attorney appearing in an action or proceeding . . ..” When defendant Pankow
filed the 170.6 challenge against Referee Polis, it was not a party to the
stipulation appointing Polis as the referee.  A non-party lacks standing
to file a peremptory challenge. (Avelar v. Superior Court (1991) 7
Cal.App.4th 1270.) A 170.6 challenge by a non-party is not duly presented,
because the non-party cannot assert it is a “party to the action who cannot or
believes that he or she cannot have a fair and impartial trial or hearing
before the judge, court commissioner or referee.” (Frisk v. Superior Court (2011)
200 Cal.App.4th 402, 410-411.) The issue was handled by Judge Karlan by having
the parties, including Pankow, choose and agree on a new referee – thus mooting
Pankow’s 170.6. 
 
A peremptory challenge that has been rendered moot is not
effective. (Frisk, supra, 200 Cal.App.4th at p. 411.) A 170.6
challenge that was not duly and properly made is not exhausted and the
litigants retain the right to exercise one peremptory challenge per proceeding.
(Truck Ins. Exchange v. Superior Court (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 142, 148 [a
peremptory challenge is not exhausted immediately upon filing, regardless of
outcome].) Only once it is accepted does it preclude a subsequent challenge.
When parties on the same side have not exercised their right to a peremptory
challenge of the [referee], a late-appearing party on that side may exercise
such a challenge. (The Home Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (2005) 34 Cal.4th
1025, 1033.) 
 
Since the prior 170.6 was (1) not filed by a party to the
stipulation, and (2) found moot, a newly appearing party that had not
previously exercised a challenge would not be barred from doing so.  That challenge, however, would have to be made
by a party to the stipulation designating Judge Waldrip.  Otherwise, the party would lack
standing.  At this time, the Court believes
that TWOA lacks standing to bring a peremptory challenge.  TWOA only entered the matter on November 27,
2023, and was not part of the stipulation appointing Judge Waldrip as the referee.
