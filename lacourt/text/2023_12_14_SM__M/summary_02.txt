And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion for alternative service or service by publication filed by SMC Specialty Finance, LLC against Han Sanping, et al. The judge has determined that a cause of action exists against Alex Zhang, one of the defendants, based on his execution of a guarantee and forgery of a signature. The judge has also found that the Hague Convention applies because Zhang resides in China, which is a signatory to the convention. However, the judge has noted that the parties have agreed to waive formal service of process in favor of a specified type of notification, and therefore the Hague Convention is not applicable in this situation.

The judge has ordered that SMC may first attempt service through the agreed upon Process Agent, Jake Seal. If that is unsuccessful, the court authorizes service via email. The judge has also noted that there is evidence that Zhang is evading service and has responded to emails at the identified email address, making email service reasonably likely to provide notice to Zhang of the complaint. The judge will discuss the potential for email service with the parties at the hearing.
