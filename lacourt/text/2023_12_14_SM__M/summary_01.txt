And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the parties' supplemental briefs and the January 7, 2022 order of Judge Karlin, which found the 170.6 challenge to Referee Polis moot. The court concludes that a peremptory challenge by a non-party is not effective, as it lacks standing to bring such a challenge. The court also notes that a 170.6 challenge that was not properly made is not exhausted and the litigants retain the right to exercise one peremptory challenge per proceeding. The court further finds that TWOA, which entered the matter on November 27, 2023, lacks standing to bring a peremptory challenge as it was not part of the stipulation appointing Judge Waldrip as the referee.
