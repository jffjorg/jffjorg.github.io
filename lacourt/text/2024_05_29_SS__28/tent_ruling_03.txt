 Case Number:  20STCV32917    Hearing Date:   May 29, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
considered the moving, opposition, and amended papers, the Court rules as
follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On
August 28, 2020, Plaintiff Daniel Tepper (“Plaintiff”) filed this action
against Defendants Skinny Labs, Inc. dba Spin (“Spin”), City of Los Angeles
(“City”), and Does 1-100 for negligence, negligence under Government Code
sections 815.2 and 820, and public nuisance. Attorneys Dean Ogrin and Daniel M.
McGee of McGee, Lerer & Associates represented Plaintiff when he filed the
action. 
On
October 2, 2020, Spin filed an answer. 
On
November 4, 2020, the City filed an answer and a cross-complaint against
Cross-Defendants Spin and Roes 1-10 for express indemnity, breach of contract,
equitable indemnity, comparative indemnity, and declaratory relief. On March
25, 2021, the Court dismissed the City’s cross-complaint without prejudice at
the City’s request. 
On
November 19, 2021, the Court granted Plaintiff's counsel's motion to be
relieved as counsel. 
On
January 28, 2022, Attorneys Aidin D. Ghavimi and John Vafa of Starpoint LC
(“Starpoint”) filed a substitution of attorney form stating they were
Plaintiff’s new legal representatives. 
On
June 30, 2022, Starpoint filed a notice of lien stating that, as Plaintiff’s
former counsel, it was asserting a lien in the amount of $21,819.18 on the
proceeds or satisfaction of judgment, award, or settlement in Plaintiff’s
favor. 
On
July 12, 2022, Attorney Ariella E. Perry of Wilshire Law Firm (“Perry”) filed a
substitution of attorney stating that she was Plaintiff’s new legal
representative. 
On
September 27, 2022, Plaintiff filed a notice of settlement.  On September 7,
2023, Perry informed the Court that all parties except Plaintiff had signed a
release. The Court continued the hearing to allow Plaintiff to sign the
release. 
On
October 31, 2023, Plaintiff filed a motion to enforce a settlement agreement. 
On
November 28, 2023, Plaintiff filed a substitution of attorney form substituting
himself as a self-represented litigant in place of Perry. 
On
December 18, 2023, Plaintiff withdrew the motion to enforce a settlement
agreement. 
On
December 27, 2023, Perry filed a notice of lien stating that “Wilshire Law Firm
has a lien on this case for attorneys’ fees and costs totaling $181,443.89.” 
On
December 28, 2023, Spin filed a notice of bankruptcy filing and suggestion of
stay. Spin stated that it filed a voluntary petition for Chapter 11 relief on
December 20, 2023, staying the case against Spin and “any act that would affect
the property of the estate . . . .” 
On
March 14, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion to enforce settlement, to be heard on
May 2, 2024. On April 19, 2024, the City filed an opposition. On April 23,
2024, Plaintiff filed an amended motion to enforce settlement without changing
the hearing date. The City filed an objection to the amended motion. On April
29, 2024, Plaintiff filed a response to the objection. 
On
May 2, 2024, the Court issued a tentative ruling observing that, on April 23,
2024, Plaintiff filed an “amended” motion to enforce settlement, after the City
had filed an opposition to Plaintiff’s original motion and only seven court
days before the hearing on the motion. Under Code of Civil Procedure section
1005, subdivision (b), all moving papers must be served and filed at least 16
court days before the hearing. Therefore, the “amended” motion was untimely.
The Court continued the hearing on the motion to May 29, 2024 and ordered that
the deadlines to file any opposition or reply would be based on the new hearing
date. 
The
parties have not filed any additional papers. 
No
trial is currently scheduled. 
PARTIES’ REQUESTS
Plaintiff
asks the Court to enforce a settlement agreement. 
The City asks the Court to deny the motion. 
LEGAL STANDARD                   
Code
of Civil Procedure section 664.6 provides in part: 
“(a) If parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a
writing signed by the parties outside of the presence of the court or orally
before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon
motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement. If
requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to
enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of the
settlement. 
“(b) For purposes of this section, a writing is signed
by a party if it is signed by any of the following: 
“(1) The party. 
“(2) An attorney who represents the party. 
“(3) If the party is an insurer, an agent who is
authorized in writing by the insurer to sign on the insurer’s behalf.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6,
subds. (a), (b).) 
In
deciding motions made under section 664.6, courts “must determine whether the
parties entered into a valid and binding settlement.”  (Kohn v. Jaymar-Ruby (1994) 23
Cal.App.4th 1530, 1533.)  On a motion to
enforce a settlement under section 664.6, courts have the power to decide
disputed facts and to interpret the agreement. 
(Fiore v. Alvord (1985) 182 Cal.App.3d 561, 566; L. Edmon &
C. Karnow, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶¶
12:977–12:978.5, pp. 12(ll)-139 to 12(ll)-140.)  Courts may receive evidence,
determine disputed facts including the terms the parties previously agreed on,
and enter the terms of a settlement agreement as a judgment, but they may not
create new material terms. (Osumi v. Sutton (2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 1355,
1360.) 
DISCUSSION 
Plaintiff
states that he settled the case with Spin and the City “pursuant to a stipulated
draft settlement agreement, dated January 19th of 2023, and pursuant
to the oral stipulation for settlement on the record before this court on
October 20th of 2023.”  (Amended
Motion p. 1.)  (Plaintiff also asserts
that the case was settled “on or around September of 2022.  (Tepper dec. ¶ B.))  Plaintiff argues that Spin and the City
breached the settlement agreement by “fail[ing] to tender a final version of
the aforementioned draft settlement agreement” and failing to pay Plaintiff the
settlement proceeds. 
Plaintiff
asserts that he received only “an error-containing draft of the Release” and Defendants’
counsel have not complied with his requests for a final version that omits the
errors.  Aside from the errors,
Plaintiff agrees with the terms of the draft release.  Plaintiff therefore “produce[d] the final
version of the Release himself, by crossing out the aforementioned erroneous
sections, as well as by crossing out the word ‘draft’ on each page of the draft
Release . . . .”  There is no evidence
that Spin or the City signed Plaintiff’s “final” version of the release. 
Plaintiff
also points to the transcript of the October 20, 2023 hearing (attached as Exhibit 2 to Plaintiff’s original motion to enforce settlement filed on March
14, 2024).  In the transcript, Plaintiff’s
then-attorney states that the parties have agreed to settle the case but do not
have a signed settlement agreement. 
Plaintiff states that this is “not true” but it is not clear what Plaintiff believes is
not true.  The City’s counsel states, “We’ve been settled technically for almost a year now.”  No one put the terms of the purported settlement on the record at the hearing. 
Plaintiff
has not presented evidence to support a finding that the parties entered into a
valid and binding settlement.  In
particular, Plaintiff has not shown that the City accepted Plaintiff’s
modifications to the draft release.  The
Court denies the motion. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES Plaintiff Daniel Tepper’s motion to enforce a settlement agreement
with Defendant City of Los Angeles. 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
