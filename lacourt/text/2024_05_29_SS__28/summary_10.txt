And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reconsidered its views expressed in its January 23, 2024 order. The court now concludes that the petition may include the benefits that the plaintiff will receive from his own insurance carrier as part of the settlement that the plaintiff's counsel negotiated. The court also concludes that counsel may calculate attorney's fees based on those benefits. However, the court cannot approve the petition unless it shows that the minor's compromise will reimburse all the medical expenses that have not been reduced or waived. The court continues the hearing and directs the petitioner to clarify the total amount of medical expenses, the amount of medical expenses that were subject to reduction, and the amount of medical expenses that will be paid or reimbursed from the settlement proceeds. The court also orders the petitioner to state whether any changes to these figures will result in a modification of the net settlement balance.
