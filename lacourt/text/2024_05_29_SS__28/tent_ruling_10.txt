 Case Number:  23STCV21259    Hearing Date:   May 29, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
considered the petitioning papers, the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On
September 5, 2023, Plaintiff Meir Reichman (“Plaintiff”), a minor, by and
through his guardian ad litem Mitchell Reichman, filed this action against
Defendants John Philip Ingco Panis, Luis Panis, and Does 1-60 for general
negligence and motor vehicle tort. 
On
February 27, 2024, Petitioner Mitch Reichman filed a petition to approve the
compromise of minor Meir Reichman’s action, to be heard on April 9, 2024.  On April 9, 2024, the Court issued a tentative ruling, heard argument, and continued the hearing to May 29, 2024. 
No
trial date is currently scheduled. 
PETITIONER’S REQUEST 
Petitioner
Mitch Reichman asks the Court to approve the compromise of the pending action
of Plaintiff Meir Reichman. 
DISCUSSION      
The
Court has reconsidered the views it expressed in its January 23, 2024 order.  The Court now concludes that (1) the petition
may include the benefits that Plaintiff will receive from his own insurance
carrier as part of the settlement that Plaintiff’s counsel negotiated and (2) counsel
may calculate attorney’s fees based on those benefits. 
Section
12a(1) of the petition states that total medical expenses were $9,568.16.  Section 12a(3) of the petition states that
$6,084.60 of the total medical expenses were subject to reduction.  This should mean that the remaining amount,
$3,483.56, will be paid or reimbursed from the settlement proceeds.  However, Section 12a(4) of the petition
states that only $3,483.47 will be paid or reimbursed from the settlement
proceeds.  This leaves $0.09 of medical
expenses unaccounted for.  The Court cannot
approve the petition unless it shows that
the minor’s compromise will reimburse all the medical expenses that have not
been reduced or waived. 
The
Court continues the hearing and directs Petitioner to clarify (1) the total
amount of medical expenses, (2) the amount of medical expenses that were
subject to reduction, and (3) the amount of medical expenses that will be paid
or reimbursed from the settlement proceeds. 
Petitioner should also state whether any changes to these figures will
result in a modification of the net settlement balance. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court CONTINUES the hearing on the petition for approval of the compromise of
the pending action of Plaintiff Meir Reichman filed by Petitioner Mitch
Reichman on February 27, 2024, to a date to be provided at the May 29, 2024
hearing.  The Court orders Petitioner to file
a supplemental declaration containing the requested information within five
days before the continued hearing. 
Petitioner
is ordered to give notice of the ruling. 
Petitioner
is ordered to file the proof of service of the ruling with the Court within
five days.
