in its requests for admission be deemed admitted, to be heard on May 29,
2024.  Plaintiff did not file an
opposition.

PARTY’S REQUEST 
The
City asks the Court to deem admitted matters specified in requests for
admission served on Plaintiff. 
LEGAL STANDARD  
          Code of Civil Procedure section
2033.280 provides: 
“If a party to whom requests for admission are
directed fails to serve a timely response, the following rules apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the requests for admission are
directed waives any objection to the requests, including one based on privilege
or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section
2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its
determination that both of the following conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2033.210, 2033.220, and 2033.230. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The requesting party may move for an order that
the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the
requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010). 
“(c) The court shall make this order, unless it finds
that the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has
served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests
for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220. It is
mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to
serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280.) 
DISCUSSION

22, 2024, the City served requests for admission, set one, on Plaintiff.  Plaintiff did not serve timely responses and

The
Court grants the motion and deems admitted the matters specified in the
requests for admission.

Angeles’s motion to deem admitted the matters specified in requests for
admission served on Plaintiff
Ruth
Prins.  The Court deems the matters
admitted. 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
