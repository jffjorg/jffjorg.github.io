And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The Court has reviewed the parties' disputes regarding discovery and expert testimony. Defendant City of Pomona (Defendant) had requested to reopen discovery to conduct a physical examination of Plaintiff Movses Karapetyan (Plaintiff). The Court granted the request, but Plaintiff refused to allow the examination by Dr. Ronald Kvitne, instead of Dr. Barry I. Ludwig as previously agreed. Defendant subsequently filed a motion for issue, evidentiary, and monetary sanctions against Plaintiff or his attorneys. The Court denied the motion, finding that Plaintiff had not violated the Court's order and that Defendant's lack of diligence in scheduling the physical examination was not a sufficient reason to impose sanctions. The Court also denied Defendant's motion to augment its expert witness list to include Dr. Kvitne.
