LEGAL STANDARD 
A.   Inspection demand 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2031.300 provides: 
“If a party to whom a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a timely response to it, the
following rules shall apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the demand for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling is directed waives any objection to the demand,
including one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under
Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve
that party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230,
2031.240, and 2031.280. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The party making the demand may move for an order
compelling response to the demand. 
“(c) Except as provided in subdivision (d), the court
shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails to obey the order compelling
a response, the court may make those orders that are just, including the
imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in
addition to this sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). 
“(d) (1) Notwithstanding subdivision (c), absent
exceptional circumstances, the court shall not impose sanctions on a party or
any attorney of a party for failure to provide electronically stored
information that has been lost, damaged, altered, or overwritten as a result of
the routine, good faith operation of an electronic information system. 
“(2) This subdivision shall not be construed to alter
any obligation to preserve discoverable information.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.300.) 
B.   Interrogatories 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2030.290 provides: 
“If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails
to serve a timely response, the following rules apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the interrogatories are
directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under
Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to the interrogatories, including
one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4
(commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that
party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, and
2030.240. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The party propounding the interrogatories may
move for an order compelling response to the interrogatories. 
“(c) The court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to
interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails to obey an order compelling
answers, the court may make those orders that are just, including the imposition
of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in addition to that
sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010).” 
(Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290.) 
C.      Requests for admission 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2033.280 provides: 
“If a party to whom requests for admission are
directed fails to serve a timely response, the following rules apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the requests for admission are
directed waives any objection to the requests, including one based on privilege
or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section
2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its
determination that both of the following conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2033.210, 2033.220, and 2033.230. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The requesting party may move for an order that
the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the
requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010). 
“(c) The court shall make this order, unless it finds
that the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has
served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests
for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220. It is
mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to
serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., §
2033.280.) 
          D.      Depositions 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2025.450 provides in part: 
“(a) If, after service of a deposition notice, a party
to the action or an officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a party,
or a person designated by an organization that is a party under Section
2025.230, without having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails
to appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for inspection
any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in
the deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order
compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production for
inspection of any document, electronically stored information, or tangible
thing described in the deposition notice. 
“(b) A motion under subdivision (a) shall comply with
both of the following: 
“(1) The motion shall set forth specific facts showing
good cause justifying the production for inspection of any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice. 
“(2) The motion shall be accompanied by a meet and
confer declaration under Section 2016.040, or, when the deponent fails to
attend the deposition and produce the documents, electronically stored
information, or things described in the deposition notice, by a declaration
stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire about the
nonappearance. 
* * *
 “(g) (1) If a motion under subdivision (a) is granted,
the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010) in favor of the party who noticed the deposition and against
the deponent or the party with whom the deponent is affiliated, unless the
court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust. . . .” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450,
subds. (a), (b), (g)(1).) 
DISCUSSION 
A.   Motions to compel and to deem matters admitted 
On
January 11, 2024, Defendants served request for production of documents, set
one, special interrogatories, set one, form interrogatories, set one, and
requests for admission, set one, on Burden. 
Burden
did not provide timely responses and had not provided responses by the time
Defendants filed these motions on March 19, 2024. 
On
May 15, 2024, Plaintiffs’ counsel appeared at the hearing on these motions and asserted that Burden had served
responses to Defendants’ requests for admission and interrogatories.  Defendants’ counsel did not appear.  The Court continued the hearing to
May 29, 2024.  However, the Court has received no information (1) verifying counsel’s
statement that Burden served discovery responses or (2) the sufficiency of any responses. 
The
Court grants Defendants’ motion to compel responses to the request for
production of documents and orders Burden to provide verified code-compliant
responses without objections and to produce the documents, electronically
stored information, and/or other things requested without objections by June 28,
2024. 
The
Court grants Defendants’ motion to compel responses to the special and form
interrogatories and orders Burden to provide verified code-compliant responses
to the special and form interrogatories without objections by June 28, 2024. 
The
Court grants Defendants’ motion to deem admitted matters specified in the
requests for admission and deems those matters admitted. 
Defendants
request sanctions on the motions to compel responses to the request for
production of documents, special interrogatories, and form
interrogatories.  Under Code of Civil
Procedure sections 2030.290 and 2031.300, sanctions are available against
parties, persons, and attorneys who unsuccessfully make or oppose a motion to
compel a response to interrogatories or requests for production. (See Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (c) [interrogatories], 2031.300, subd. (c) [demand
for inspection].)  Burden did not make or
oppose a motion to compel responses to interrogatories or requests for
production. Therefore, sanctions are not available under these statutes. 
Other
statutes addressing misuse of the discovery process do not, by themselves,
authorize a sanctions award for these motions. (See Code Civ. Proc., §
2023.010.)  Code of Civil Procedure
section 2023.010 is “ ‘definitional’ and monetary sanctions may not be imposed
based solely on [the statute]. Monetary sanctions may be imposed only if
authorized by some other provision of the Discovery Act.” (L. Edmon & C. Karnow,
Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶ 8:1900, p.
8M-2; see Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030 [court may impose sanctions for misuse of
the discovery process “[t]o the extent authorized by the chapter governing any
particular discovery method or other provision of this title”]; City of Los
Angeles v. PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLC (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 466, 498-504,
review granted Jan. 23, 2023 with order permitting citation of opinion for its
persuasive value and to establish the existence of a conflict in authority that
would “allow trial courts to exercise discretion . . . to choose between sides
of any such conflict.”) 
California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1348(a), provides: “The court may award sanctions under
the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery,
even though no opposition to the motion was filed . . . .”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 1348(a).)  Because rule 3.1348(a) authorizes
sanctions “under the Discovery Act,” it does not authorize sanctions independent of the Discovery Act.  As explained above, the
Discovery Act does not authorize sanctions for Defendants’ unopposed motions to compel
responses to interrogatories and requests for production. 
The
Court is required to grant Defendants’ request for sanctions on their motion to
deem admitted matters specified in requests for admission. (See Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c) [“It is mandatory that the court impose a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) on the party or
attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely response to requests for
admission necessitated this motion”].) Defendants request $800.00 in sanctions
based on four hours of attorney time at a rate of $200.00 per hour. Defendants’
counsel spent one hour attempting to meet and confer with Plaintiffs’ counsel and
two hours preparing the moving papers. Defendants’ counsel anticipated spending
one hour to attend the hearing. The Court grants $400.00 in sanctions based on
two hours of attorney time. 
B.   Motions to compel depositions 
Defendants
noticed Plaintiffs’ depositions for March 12 and March 14, 2024.  Plaintiffs did not object to the deposition
notices and did not appear for their depositions.  Plaintiffs’ counsel has not responded to
Defendants’ counsel’s attempts to meet and confer about the depositions. 
The
Court grants the motions and orders Plaintiffs to appear for depositions, to be
taken remotely. Rosado is to appear for his deposition on or before June 4,
2024, at 2:00 p.m.  Burden is to appear for his deposition on or before June 4, 2024, at 10:00 a.m. 
Defendants
request $800.00 in sanctions against each
Plaintiff based on four hours of attorney time at a rate of $200.00 per hour.  Counsel spent one hour meeting and conferring
and two hours drafting the motion and anticipated spending one hour to attend
the hearing. 
The
Court awards $600.00 in sanctions ($300.00 on each motion) based on three hours
of attorney’s time.
