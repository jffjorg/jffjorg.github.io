 Case Number:  21STCV37727    Hearing Date:   May 29, 2024    Dept:  28 On
October 13, 2021, Plaintiff Movses Karapetyan (“Plaintiff”) filed this action
against Defendants City of Pomona (“Defendant”) and Does 1-30 for statutory
liability/dangerous condition of public property and premises liability. 
On
November 22, 2021, Defendant filed an answer. 
At
an informal discovery conference on July 7, 2023, the Court granted the
parties’ oral stipulation to continue the trial and continued the trial from
October 2, 2023 to January 31, 2024, with discovery and motion cut-off dates to
trail the new trial date. 
On
January 30, 2024, the Court granted the parties’ stipulated request to continue
the trial from January 31, 2024 to April 25, 2024. The parties stipulated that
all discovery would remain closed with the exception of any outstanding expert
depositions that the parties had previously agreed on. The parties also
stipulated that the Court’s order would not preclude any party from seeking
further relief from the Court. 
On
February 28, 2024, Defendant filed a motion to reopen discovery and allow for a
physical examination of Plaintiff Movses Karapetyan (“Plaintiff”) or
alternatively continue trial with limited discovery, to be heard on April 10,
2024. Defendant asserted that it had arranged for its expert, Dr. Barry I.
Ludwig, to conduct Plaintiff’s physical examination and the examination would
not delay the upcoming trial.  Plaintiff
opposed the motion, arguing that Defendant showed a lack of diligence in
failing to schedule the physical examination before the discovery cut-off. 
On April
10, 2024, the Court granted Defendant’s motion to reopen discovery.  The Court concluded that Defendant’s lack of
diligence in scheduling Plaintiff’s physical examination, while troubling,
should not prevent Defendant from conducting discovery which both parties agree
is critical to Defendant’s ability to defend itself in this case.  The Court reopened discovery for the purpose
of allowing Defendant to conduct a physical examination of Plaintiff and ordered
Plaintiff to appear for a physical examination on March 26, 2024 or on another
date to which the parties agreed.  The
Court’s April 10, 2024 order was premised on the understanding that Defendant
had already designated an expert, Dr. Barry I. Ludwig, who would examine
Plaintiff. 
On
April 11, 2024, Defendant noticed Plaintiff’s physical examination, not with Dr. Ludwig but with Dr. Ronald Kvitne on April 15, 2024.  Defendant accompanied the notice with a meet
and confer letter asking Plaintiff to agree to allow Defendant to augment its
expert witness list with Dr. Kvitne.  Plaintiff’s
counsel refused to allow Plaintiff to attend the examination by Dr. Kvitne and
refused to stipulate to allow Defendant to augment its expert witness list to
include Dr. Kvitne. 
On
April 12, 2024, Defendant filed a motion for issue, evidentiary, and monetary
sanctions against Plaintiff or his attorneys, to be heard on May 29, 2024.  On May 15, 2024, Plaintiff filed an
opposition. 
On
April 17, 2024, the Court denied Defendant’s ex parte application to continue
the trial until after the hearing on Defendant’s motion to augment its expert
witness list to include Dr. Kvitne.  The
Court observed that, in refusing to allow Dr. Kvitne to conduct Plaintiff’s
physical examination, Plaintiff had not violated the Court’s April 10, 2024
order because the Court did not order Plaintiff to stipulate to augment
Defendant’s expert witness list with Dr. Kvitne. 
Defendant
subsequently took its motion to augment its expert witness list off
calendar.  Defendant did not take its
motion for issue, evidentiary, and monetary sanctions off calendar. 
For
the reasons stated in the Court’s April 17, 2024 order, the Court denies
Defendant’s motion for issue, evidentiary, or monetary sanctions.
