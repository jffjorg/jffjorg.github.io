 Case No.: 20STCV26898
 
 Hearing Date: April 18, 2024
 
[TENTATIVE] order RE:
DEFENDANT KIA MOTORS AMERICA, INC.’S MOTION
  TO TAX COSTS
 
 



 
Background
            On February 3, 2021, Plaintiff Raul
Gutierrez (“Plaintiff”) filed the Operative First Amended Complaint (“FAC”)
against defendant Kia Motors America, Inc. (“Defendant”). The FAC asserted six causes
of action for (1) Violation of Subdivision (D) of Civil Code Section 1793.2;
(2) Violation of Subdivision (B) of Civil Code Section 1793.2; (3) Violation of
Subdivision (A)(3) of Civil Code Section 1793.2; (4) Breach of Express Written
Warranty; (5) Breach of the Implied Warranty of Merchantability; and (6) Fraud
by Omission.
            On June 1, 2023, at the conclusion
of a jury trial, the jury found in favor of Plaintiff. (Special Verdict
6/1/23.) On September 12, 2023, the Court entered judgment in favor of
Plaintiff pursuant to the jury’s special verdict. (Judgment 9/12/23.)
            On July 31, 2023, Plaintiff filed a
memorandum of costs. On August 17, 2023, Defendant filed the instant motion to
tax costs. The motion is unopposed. 
Legal Standard
“A
prevailing party is entitled ‘as a matter of right’ to recover costs in any
action or proceeding unless a statute expressly provides otherwise.”  (Segal v. ASICS America Corp. (2022)
12 Cal.5th 651, 658.)  “Section 1033.5
sets forth the types of expenses that are and are not allowable as costs under
section 1032. Specifically, subdivision (a) of section 1033.5 describes items
that are ‘allowable as costs,’ subdivision (b) describes items ‘not allowable
as costs, except when expressly authorized by law,’ and section 1033.5(c)(4)
provides that ‘[i]tems not mentioned in this section and items assessed upon
application may be allowed or denied in the court's discretion.’”  (Ibid.)
To
recover a cost, it must be reasonably necessary to the litigation and
reasonable in amount. (Perko’s Enterprises, Inc. v. RRNS Enterprises
(l992) 4 Cal.App.4th 238, 244.) If the items appearing in a cost bill appear to
be proper charges, the burden is on the party seeking to tax costs to show that
they were not reasonable or necessary. (Ladas v. California State Automotive
Assoc. (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761, 773-74.) 
On the other hand, if the items are properly objected to, they are put
in issue and the burden of proof is on the party claiming them as costs. (Id.)  
Discussion
Timeliness of the Instant Motion
California Rule
of Court, Rule 3.1700 requires that “[a]ny notice of motion to strike or to tax
costs must be served and filed 15 days after service of the cost memorandum. If
the cost memorandum was served by mail, the period is extended as provided in Code
of Civil Procedure section 1013. If the cost memorandum was served
electronically, the period is extended as provided in Code of Civil Procedure
section 1010.6(a)(4).” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1700(b)(1).)  Additionally, “the court may extend the times
for serving and filing the cost memorandum or the notice of motion or tax costs
for a period not to exceed 30 days.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule
3.1700(b)(3).)  
            Here,
the memorandum of costs was served electronically on July 31, 2023.  Accordingly, Defendant had until August 18,
2023 to timely file the instant motion. The instant motion was filed on August
17, 2023. Therefore, the instant motion was timely filed.  
Reasonably Incurred Costs
            “It
is not necessary that the [moving party], …, accompany the motion to tax cost
with any affidavit.”  (State of
California v. Meyer (1985) 174 Cal.App.3d 1061, 1075.)  Rather, “[i]f items on a memorandum of costs
appear to be proper charges on their face, those items are prima facie evidence
that the costs, expenses, and services are proper and necessarily incurred.
[Citation.] The burden then shifts to the objecting party to show them to be
unnecessary or unreasonable.”  (Doe v.
Los Angeles County Dept. of Children & Family Services (2019) 37
Cal.App.5th 675, 693.)  “[T]he objecting
party has the burden to show that a cost item is unrecoverable because it was
not necessary to the litigation.”  (Hooked
Media Group, Inc. v. Apple Inc. (2020) 55 Cal.App.5th 323, 338.)  “However, more than a bare objection is
needed to rebut the presumption that fees were reasonable and necessarily
incurred.”  (State of California,
supra, 174 Cal.App.3d at p.1075.)
            Defendant
contends that the (1) Mediation fees, (2) Court Reporter fees, (3) Veritext
Hearing Attendance costs for Defendant’s MSJ, and (4) Veritext Hearing
Attendance costs for Final Status Conference should be taxed. 
            Court
reporter fees including the Veritext Hearing Attendance for Defendant’s MSJ and
Final Status Conference are expressly permitted as costs.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5(a)(11).)  Thus, the burden falls on Defendant to show
that these claimed costs are unreasonable. Defendant fails to do so and appears
to misinterpret the statutory language concerning court reporter fees being
allowable cost “ as established by statute” by arguing Plaintiff cannot cite
any statute that authorizes costs for a court reporter at demurrer hearing.
However, court reporter fees are allowable costs pursuant to Government Code
Section 68086(a)(2)(c), which states in pertinent part “[t]he costs for the
services of the official court reporter shall be recoverable as taxable costs
by the prevailing party as otherwise provided by law” in civil actions or cases
and apply in Superior Court. Therefore, Defendant has not shown that the court
reporter fees are unreasonable. 
            As
to the mediation fees, they may be allowed or denied in the Court’s discretion.
Thus, the burden falls on Defendant to show that the claim costs is
unreasonable. Defendant fails to do so and merely argues Plaintiff did not make
a settlement demand or any effort to resolve the case prior to the mediation,
thus Plaintiff cannot argue the mediation was necessary to resolve the case.
However, Defendant proffers no legal authority to support its contention that
Plaintiff needed to make a settlement demand prior to mediation. Furthermore,
Defendant concedes that the mediation did take place and presumably in an
effort to resolve the case prior to trial. Therefore, Defendant has not shown
the mediation fee is unreasonable.  
Conclusion and ORDER
            Based on the foregoing, Defendant
Kia Motors America, Inc.’s motion to tax costs is DENIED. 
            Moving Party to give notice within
seven (7) days.
