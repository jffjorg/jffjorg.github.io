The court's tentative ruling is as follows:

* The demurrer to the second cause of action (breach of fiduciary duty) is overruled.
* The demurrer to the third cause of action (breach of contract) is overruled.
* The demurrer to the fourth cause of action (breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing) is sustained with leave to amend.
* The demurrer to the fifth cause of action (fraud and deceit) is sustained with leave to amend.
* The demurrer to the sixth cause of action (constructive fraud) is sustained with leave to amend.
* The demurrer to the seventh cause of action (negligent misrepresentation) is sustained with leave to amend.
* The motion to strike paragraphs 52, 60, 74, 80, 90, 95, 98, 108, and 109 is granted, in part, with leave to amend as to the punitive damages allegations.

The court's ruling is based on the pleadings and the parties' arguments. The court finds that the demurrer to the second and third causes of action should be overruled, as the pleadings adequately state a cause of action. The court also finds that the demurrer to the fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh causes of action should be sustained, as the pleadings do not adequately state a cause of action. The court grants the motion to strike paragraphs 52, 60, 74, 80, 90, 95, 98, 108, and 109, in part, as to the punitive damages allegations, with leave to amend.
