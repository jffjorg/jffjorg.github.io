MOTION
Plaintiff Lisa
Carson (“Plaintiff”) moves to compel Defendant FCA US LLC (“Defendant”) to
comply with this court’s March 14, 2024 order compelling Defendant to produce
discovery responses and documents.  On
August 9, 2024, Defendant filed an opposition to the motion, which was filed on
May 9, 2024 and set for hearing on August 13, 2024.  As such, Defendant’s opposition is untimely; Defendant
provides no explanation for the late filing; and the opposition will not be
considered.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005,
subd. (b); Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1300(a).)
ANALYSIS
In the March 14,
2024 order, the court ordered Defendant to respond to three of the four sets of
Plaintiff’s discovery requests.  (See March
14, 2024 Minute Order.)  As such, the court
has already entered the order Plaintiff seeks. 
Given Plaintiff’s proposed order, it appears her focus is on the document demands rather than
the interrogatories.  Nonetheless, Plaintiff
cites no authority under which the court could compel Defendant to comply with the
order.  Plaintiff’s remedy is to seek
sanctions.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290,
subd. (c), 2031.320, subd. (c).)  The court,
therefore, denies Plaintiff’s motion.
Plaintiff is ordered
to give notice of this ruling and to file proof of service of same.
