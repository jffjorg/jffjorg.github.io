The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel discovery responses filed by plaintiff Lisa Carson. The motion was filed on May 9, 2024, and the hearing is set for August 13, 2024. However, the defendant, FCA US LLC, filed its opposition on August 9, 2024, which is untimely and will not be considered. The court had previously ordered the defendant to produce discovery responses and documents on March 14, 2024, and the defendant failed to comply with the order. The judge denies the plaintiff's motion to compel discovery responses and instead suggests that the plaintiff seek sanctions for the defendant's non-compliance. The plaintiff is ordered to give notice of this ruling and to file proof of service of the same.
