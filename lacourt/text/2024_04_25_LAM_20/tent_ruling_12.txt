 This is an action in which Plaintiff Hennig, Kramer, Ruiz & Singh, LLP, Defendant Wendy Seretan’s former attorney, claims that Defendant failed to compensate Plaintiff after Plaintiff was able to settle Defendant’s case.   Defendant now seeks a protective order requiring that her deposition be taken remotely because she fears Rob Hennig.  Defendant states, “The last time that I saw Mr. Hennig in person, was at the Mandatory Settlement Conference on March 4, 2020. At that meeting, Mr. Hennig lunged across the table at me and yelled into my face. I am in fear for my mental and physical health to appear in-person for my deposition. . . . Mr. Hennig has made several rude and threatening remarks to me since the time he represented me as counsel and through today, including direct attacks on the state of my mental health, which were extremely offensive and hurtful to me. . . . On September 28, 2020, Mr. Hennig sent me an email stating, ‘To the extent paranoia may be manifesting in your life, I also have a professional obligation to encourage you to seek help from a mental health professional.’ ” Hennig denies that he has ever acted in a threatening manner; claims a right to an in-person deposition; and asserts that Defendant merely suffers from ordinary anxiety associated with litigation.Good cause must be shown for the protective order, and the issuance and formulation of the protective order are within the Court’s discretion.  (See, e.g., Mercury Interactive Corp. v. Klein (2007) 158 Cal.App.4th 60, 106-7; Raymond Handling Concepts Corp. v. Superior Court (1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 584, 588.) The Court has considered the matter and, in the exercise of its discretion, will require a remote deposition.  The deposition shall take place within 20 days.  The Motion is granted as set forth herein.Moving party to give notice.If counsel do not submit on the tentative, they are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
