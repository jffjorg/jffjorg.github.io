And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The defendant, Hof's Hut Restaurants, Inc., has sought to compel arbitration of the plaintiff's wage and hour and PAGA suit, citing an arbitration agreement executed by the plaintiff as part of his employment. The plaintiff opposes staying his non-individual PAGA claims. The court has granted the motion to compel arbitration, but will stay the representative PAGA claim pending the resolution of arbitration. The court finds that a stay of the PAGA claims is not required and would frustrate the purpose of PAGA, which is to expand enforcement of the Labor Code.
