And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the moving papers, opposition, and reply in this matter. The plaintiffs' motions to tax costs are granted in part and denied in part.

The court finds that the defendant, Titan Wheel Corporation, is entitled to recover some costs, but that certain costs are not reasonably necessary to the litigation or are duplicative. The court grants the plaintiffs' motions to tax the following costs: (1) duplicative costs by 50%, including deposition fees, travel and lodging expenses, court reporter fees, and interpreter fees; (2) the cost of the deposition of Michael Anthony Podue, as it was taken after summary judgment was granted and was not necessary to the litigation; (3) half of the costs of the depositions of Mark Jurisic, Curtis Shaw, Duane Brazil, Mathew Hillyer, Jeffrey Brown, Dante Cupello, Matthew Dickenson, Pedro Chavarin, Mark Rankin, Leonard Hensel, Lee Hamre, Thomas Vadnais, Jeffrey Olsen, and Pedro Ramos; (4) interpreter fees; (5) court reporter fees; (6) travel and lodging costs; (7) investigative expenses; (8) photocopying charges; (9) subpoena fees; (10) attorneys' meals; and (11) conference room fees.

The court denies the plaintiffs' motions to tax the following costs: (1) jury fees; (2) court reporter fees; and (3) travel and lodging costs.

The court grants the plaintiffs' motions to tax the costs in the amount of $1,265.55, $16,475.03, $705.00, $1,745.00, $2,159.24, $1,527.65, $29.71, $413.66, $345.63, and $675.00, respectively.

The court finds that the defendant is not entitled to recover double recovery and that the costs should be apportioned among the plaintiffs. The court also finds that the defendant is entitled to recover certain costs, including court reporter fees, travel and lodging costs, and investigative expenses.
