 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
Plaintiff Harutyun
  Shatarevyan’s Motion for Attorney’s Fees, Costs, and Expenses.



 
I. Background
A. Pleadings
Plaintiff Harutyun
Shatarevyan (Plaintiff) sues Defendants FCA US, LLC (FCA) and Does 1 through 30
pursuant to an April 26, 2021, Complaint alleging claims of (1) Breach of
Written Warranty Pursuant to the Magnuson-Moss Act; (2) Breach of Implied
Warranty Pursuant to the Magnuson-Moss Act; (3) Breach of Written Warranty
Pursuant to the California Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act (SBA); and (4)
Breach of Implied Warranty Pursuant to the SBA.
The Complaint’s claims
arise from the following allegations. Plaintiff leased a 2020 Jeep Wrangler
manufactured by FCA and sold by its authorized dealer, non-party Huntington
Beach Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram (Huntington Beach Chrysler). FCA issued and
supplied several written warranties to Plaintiff, including a five-year, 100,000-mile
factory warranty. During the warranty period, various defects arose in the
Subject Vehicle, namely a defective steering wheel that could not be repaired
after three attempts by FCA.  Plaintiff
Shatarevyan revoked acceptance of the Subject Vehicle on January 5, 2021, which
Defendant FCA failed to accept. This suit followed.
B. Motion Before the
Court
On November 6, 2023, at
a status conference regarding alternative dispute resolution, Plaintiff’s
counsel represented to the Court that the case was settled and that the parties
were currently negotiating attorney’s fees. The Court vacated the status
conference, as well as the jury trial in this action, and set an order to show
cause (OSC) re Dismissal (Settlement) hearing for March 6, 2024.
On March 6, 2024, the
Court held the OSC, at which time the Court noted that a motion for attorney’s
fees was scheduled for hearing on June 12, 2024, and continued the OSC to June
12, 2024.
On March 18, 2024,
Plaintiff filed a motion for attorney’s fees and costs as the prevailing buyer
in this lemon law action. According to the proof of service for this motion,
the moving papers and attachments were served on FCA’s counsel that same day
via email and regular mail.
On May 2, 2024, after FCA
failed to file an opposition to Plaintiff’s motion, Plaintiff filed a motion a
notice of non-opposition. Plaintiff also filed a proposed order the motion for attorney’s
fees and costs.
Plaintiff’s motion is
now before the Court.
II. Motion for Attorney’s Fees
and Costs: GRANTED.

A. Attorney’s Fees
1. Legal
Standard
A
prevailing buyer in a Song-Beverly Act action is entitled to recover their
attorney’s fees and costs under the Act’s express terms. (Civ. Code, § 1794,
subd. (d); see Goglin v. BMW of North America, LLC (2016) 4 Cal.App.5th
462, 464, 471.)
The Court begins this inquiry “with
the ‘lodestar,’ i.e., the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the
reasonable hourly rate.” (PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084,
1095 (PLCM Group).) From there, the “lodestar figure may then be
adjusted [according to a multiplier enhancement] based on consideration of
factors specific to the case, in order to fix the fee at the fair market value
for the legal services provided.” (Ibid.) Relevant multiplier factors
include “(1) the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, (2) the
skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the extent to which the nature of the
litigation precluded other employment by the attorneys, [and] (4) the
contingent nature of the fee award.” (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th
1122, 1132.)
The
Court is considered “an expert in the matter of attorney fees” since “[t]he
value of attorney’s services is a matter with which a judge must necessarily be
familiar.” (Excelsior Union High Sch. Dist. of L.A. Cnty. v. Lautrup
(1969) 269 Cal.App.2d 434, 448.) Accordingly, “[w]hen the court is informed of
the extent and nature of such services, its own experience furnishes it with
every element necessary to fix their value.” (Ibid.)
The
Court has broad discretion to determine the amount of a reasonable attorney’s
fee award, which will not be overturned absent a “manifest abuse of discretion,
a prejudicial error of law, or necessary findings not supported by substantial
evidence.” (Bernardi v. County of Monterey (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 1379,
1393-1394.)
2. Analysis
Plaintiff files this motion seeking
$105,885 in attorney’s fees and $5,449.10 in costs. The fees are comprised of
$11,440 in fees for work performed by Plaintiff’s counsel Armen Margarian,
$58,240 in fees for work performed by Plaintiff's counsel Hovanes Margarian, a
1.5 multiplier enhancement award of $34,840, and assistant fees in the amount
of $1,365.
Plaintiff’s motion is unopposed.
a. Reasonable
Fee Rate
i. Relevant
Law
The lodestar calculation begins
with a determination of the “reasonable hourly rate,” i.e., the rate
“prevailing in the community for similar work.” (PLCM Group, supra,
22 Cal.4th at p. 1095; see, e.g., Stratton v. Beck (2017) 9 Cal.App.5th
483, 496 [finding no abuse of discretion in court setting attorney’s hourly
rate based on comparison of rates from similarly experienced attorneys in same
field and area].)
Counsel’s
actual hourly rate is strong presumptive evidence of the reasonableness of that
rate. (Mandel, supra, 92 Cal.App.3d at p. 761 [“The value of an
attorney’s time generally is reflected in his normal billing rate”].)  However, there is no requirement that the
reasonable market rate mirror the rate actually billed by counsel. (Syers
Properties III, Inc. v. Rankin (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 691, 700-703.) The
determination is instead framed around the reasonable market value of the
services. (See, e.g., Serrano, supra, 32 Cal.3d at pp. 640-643
[discussing arguments and determining trial court did not abuse discretion by
applying fee rates for public interest counsel according to reasonable market
value, not the “normal billing rate” for public interest attorneys suggested by
defendants].)

ii. Court’s
Determination
Plaintiff seeks confirmation of
rates of $650 per hour for Plaintiff’s counsel Hovanes Margarian and $550 per
hour for Armen Margarian. These are the rates charged by counsel for
contingency cases, whereas their rates for retainer cases are $550 and $450 per
hour respectively. The requested fee rates are supported by declarations from
counsel, which detail their academic and professional background. (Mot., pp.
11-14; Mot., A. Margarian Decl., ¶¶ 2-3, 10-19; H. Margarian Decl., ¶¶ 2, 4, 12-23.)
No opposition appears in the
record.
The Court finds in favor of
Plaintiff.
Regarding Hovanes Margarian, the
rate of $650 per hour is reasonable for a 17-year practitioner with substantial
litigation experience in SBA consumer law matters, primarily dealing with cases
on pure contingency terms. Counsel’s experience in this action also factors
into this determination.
The rate of $550 per hour for Armen
Margarian is reasonable. While Armen Margarian is only a seven-year
practitioner, Mr. Margarian provides a detailed basis for supporting the
requested fee rate, including extensive litigation experience in consumer law
matters, primarily dealing with the SBA, and on a contingency basis. (Mot., A.
Margarian Decl., ¶¶ 16-19.) Counsel’s experience in this action also factors
into this determination.
Last, regarding Elmira Oganyan—an Assistant
of counsel, whose work was also billed and is included in this motion—the Court
determines that, although not explicitly raised in the moving papers, the rate
of $150 per hour is reasonable for a legal assistant in the Los Angeles legal
community. 
The Court confirms the requested
rates as reasonable on these grounds.
b. Reasonable
Hours Expended
i. Relevant
Law
“Under the lodestar method, a party
who qualifies for a fee should recover for all hours reasonably spent unless
special circumstances would render an award unjust.” (Vo v. Las Virgenes
Mun. Water Dist. (2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 440, 446, citing Serrano, supra,
32 Cal.3d at pp. 632-633.) Time spent solely relating to the fee award is also compensable.
(Ketchum, supra, 24 Cal.4th at p. 1133.)
Because the court’s focus in
evaluating the facts should be to provide a fee award reasonably designed to
completely compensate attorneys for the services provided, the starting point
for this determination is the attorney’s time records. (Horsford, supra,
132 Cal.App.4th at pp. 395-397 [verified time records entitled to credence
absent clear indication they are erroneous].)
ii. Court’s
Determination
Plaintiff seeks recovery for 110.4
hours spent by counsel litigating this case, with those hours supported by
verified time records attached to the Hovanes Margarian declaration. (Mot., pp.
9-11; Mot., H. Margarian Decl., Ex. A.)
No opposition appears in the
record.
The Court finds in favor of
Plaintiff, with one deduction.
Here, verified time records are
attached to the moving papers and are entitled to deference absent a clear
indication that the records are erroneous. (Ketchum, supra, 24
Cal.4th at pp. 1132-1133.)
A review of the records fails to
show a clear indication that the records are erroneous. Instead, these records
describe with great specificity the tasks undertaken by counsel in this
litigation. The records describe who performed the billed work, the nature of
the work, and the time expended on that work. A comparison between the work
performed and the time expended on that work shows that the time expended is
generally reasonable within the context of the task performed. The declaration
of Armen Margarian states that he is not seeking all of the time actually spent
and engaged in billing judgment. The declaration of Hovanes Margarian specifies
the hours spent by task, which appears reasonable. The only deduction necessary
would be time that was projected to review the opposition and to draft and file
a reply, since no opposition was filed in this case. As broken down in the
spreadsheet, Hovanes estimated a total of 7 hours for these tasks at his rate
of $650 for this task, or $4,550.
Absent an opposition challenging
specific time entries, the Court determines that the hours expended on this
action by counsel are otherwise reasonable; or $11,440 for Armen, $58,240 -
$4550 = $53,690 for Hovanes, and $1365 for the legal assistant.
c. Multiplier
Enhancement
i. Relevant
Law
The “lodestar figure may then be
adjusted [according to a multiplier enhancement] based on consideration of
factors specific to the case, in order to fix the fee at the fair market value
for the legal services provided.” (Ibid.) Relevant multiplier factors
include “(1) the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, (2) the
skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the extent to which the nature of the
litigation precluded other employment by the attorneys, [and] (4) the contingent
nature of the fee award.” (Ketchum, supra, 24 Cal.4th at p.
1132.)
ii. Court’s
Determination
Plaintiff argues that the novelty
of the questions in this action, the skill displayed by counsel, the fact that
counsel took this case on to the preclusion of other work, and the contingency
nature of the award support a 1.5 multiplier enhancement award. (Mot., pp.
15-17.)
No opposition appears in the
record.
The Court finds in favor of
Plaintiff, to a reduced degree.
The Court agrees that the skills
displayed in this action (partly under the prior judicial officer for this
Department), the preclusion of other work, and the contingency of the nature of
representation here support a multiplier enhancement. (See Mot., H. Margarian
Decl., ¶¶ 20-24.) On the other hand, as noted above, Plaintiff’s counsel have
already increased their fees $100 per hour to account for their contingency
rate. In order to avoid duplicate consideration of this factor, the Court will
award a reduced multiplier of 1.2 to the lodestar of the two attorneys ($11,440
for Armen and $53,690 for Hovanes = $65,130 x 1.2 = $78,156.)
d. Disposition
The Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion
as to fees in the amount of $78,156 + $1,365 = $79,521.
B. Costs
1. Legal
Standard
In general, the “prevailing party”
is entitled as a matter of right to recover costs for suit in any action or
proceeding. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd. (b); Santisas v. Goodin
(1998) 17 Cal.4th 599, 606; Scott Co. Of Calif. v. Blount, Inc. (1999)
20 Cal.4th 1103, 1108.) Assuming the “prevailing party” requirements are met,
the trial court has no discretion to order each party to bear his or her own
costs of suit. (Michell v. Olick (1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 1194, 1198; Nelson
v. Anderson (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 111, 129.)
A verified memorandum of costs is
prima facie evidence that the costs, expenses, and services therein listed were
necessarily incurred. (Rappenecker v. Sea-Land Serv., Inc. (1979) 93
Cal.App.3d 256, 266 (Rappenecker).) 
“A prematurely filed memorandum of
costs is ‘“a mere irregularity at best” that does not constitute reversible
error absent a showing of prejudice’ and is treated ‘as being timely filed.’” (Lowry
v. Port San Luis Harbor District (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th 211, 221 (Lowry)
[affirming award of costs even though judgment was entered after memorandum of
costs was filed]; accord. Haley v. Casa Del Rey Homeowners Assn. (2007)
153 Cal.App.4th 863, 880 [finding no reversible error where memorandum of costs
was filed after jury returned special verdict but arguably before entry of
judgment]; Lange v. Fisher (1983) 146 Cal.App.3d 113, 118 [reversing
trial court order striking costs memorandum filed prior to entry of judgment
because “the cost bill was timely served and filed and the trial court erred in
granting plaintiff’s motion to strike it”].)
2. Analysis
Plaintiff has filed a pre-judgment
(premature) memorandum of costs detailing $5,449.10 in costs, including $661.90
in filing and motion fees, $150 in jury fees, $3,611 in witness fees, $25.75 in
interpreter fees, and $1,001.45 in “other fees” relating to the reservation fee
for the motion for attorney’s fees and to the cancellation of reporting
services. (Memo of Costs, MC-010, p. 1 & MC-011, pp. 1-4.)
No opposition appears in the
record.
The Court finds in favor of
Plaintiff.
While this memo of costs was filed
prior to judgment in this action, the Court considers it to be timely filed and
properly before the Court. (Lowry, supra, 56 Cal.App.5th at p.
221.) Moreover, though no exhibits are attached to the memo of costs—e.g.,
receipts—supporting the claimed costs, a verified memorandum of costs is prima
facie evidence that the costs, expenses, and services therein listed were
necessarily incurred. (Rappenecker, supra, 93 Cal.App.3d at p. 266.)
As such, the memo of costs is itself prima facie evidence of these costs. Last,
the Court finds that the claimed costs of $5,449.10 are eminently reasonable in
relation to a more than three-year litigation.
The Court thus GRANTS Plaintiff’s
motion as to costs in the amount of $5,449.10. 
III. Conclusion
Plaintiff Harutyun Shatarevyan’s Motion for Attorney’s Fees, Costs, and
Expenses is GRANTED in the amount of $79,521 for fees and $5,449.10 in
costs.
