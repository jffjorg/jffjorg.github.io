English-text summary:

The tentative ruling grants the defendant's motion to compel arbitration and stays the matter pending the outcome of arbitration. The court finds that the arbitration agreement is enforceable and binding on the parties, and that it is not procedurally or substantively unconscionable. The agreement requires both parties to submit any and all claims to arbitration, with the exceptions of PAGA and Workers' Compensation claims. The court concludes that the defendant has met its burden of demonstrating the existence of a valid, enforceable arbitration agreement, and that the plaintiff has not demonstrated any substantive unconscionability.
