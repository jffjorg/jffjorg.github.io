[1]           Generally, multiple
judgment in a single case should be avoided. “[A]s a general rule there can be
only one final judgment in a single action.” (Nicholson v. Henderson
(1944) 25 Cal.2d 375, 378.) “A final, ordinarily single, judgment is a
prerequisite to appealing from an action, its purpose to avoid piecemeal
appeals.” (Cuevas v. Truline Corp. (2004) 118 Cal.App.4th 56, 60 [citing
9 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (4th ed. 1997) Appeal, § 58, p. 113]; see also Kinsmith Financial Corp. v. Gilroy (2003) 105
Cal.App.4th 447, 451 [“The one final judgment rule is a principle of appellate
practice that prohibits review of intermediate rulings by appeal until final
resolution of the case.’”].)


[2]           Interestingly, Plaintiff’s
own evidence repeatedly refer to the $400,000 as an “investment” not a loan.


[3]           A judgment for damages
arising from the fraud would not be jointly and severally liable as to
Defendant Companies and would not be part of this double recovery analysis.
However, as noted above, Plaintiff has not demonstrated any fraud damages and
has not proceeded in the manner required to recover punitive damages arising
from fraud.
