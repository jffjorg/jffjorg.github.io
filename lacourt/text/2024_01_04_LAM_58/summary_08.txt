And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is an action arising from a breach of a loan agreement. The Plaintiff, Aida Shahbandeh Masihi, alleges that the Defendants solicited a $400,000 loan, representing that the funds would be used to develop a "proven cure" for COVID-19. The Plaintiff seeks default judgment against the Defendants Matthew A. Bennett, MD and Robin Messier in the amount of $400,000. The Judge finds that the Plaintiff is entitled to this amount, as well as prejudgment interest and costs. However, the Judge also finds that the Plaintiff cannot recover on its request for special damages, including punitive damages, as the evidence presented does not show clear and convincing evidence of fraud, malice, or oppression.

The Judge also notes that the Plaintiff's FAC purports to state claims against the remaining Defendants despite the entry of default judgment against them. The Judge orders that these Defendants be dismissed from the FAC. Additionally, the Judge finds that the Plaintiff cannot recover a double judgment and orders that the judgments entered in this case include language stating that damages awarded will not be recoverable to the extent that such damages are recovered and collected under the other judgment.

Overall, the Judge's tentative ruling is in favor of the Plaintiff, but with some limitations on the amount of damages and the scope of the claims.
