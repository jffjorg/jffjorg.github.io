And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering the case and has reached a tentative ruling. The judge notes that generally, there should be only one final judgment in a single case, to avoid piecemeal appeals. The judge also finds that the plaintiff's own evidence refers to the $400,000 as an "investment" rather than a loan. The judge concludes that a judgment for damages arising from fraud would not be jointly and severally liable and would not be part of the double recovery analysis. However, the plaintiff has not demonstrated any fraud damages and has not proceeded to recover punitive damages arising from fraud.
