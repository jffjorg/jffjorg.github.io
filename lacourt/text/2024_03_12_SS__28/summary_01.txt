```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the motion filed by Liberty Mutual Fire Insurance Company (Intervenor) to set aside the default of Heide Orellana (Defendant) entered on March 29, 2022. The Intervenor argues that the Court should set aside the default because Plaintiff Taylor Briscoe served the summons and complaint more than 60 days after filing the complaint, violating California Rules of Court, rule 3.110(b). However, the Intervenor has provided no authority showing that a failure to effect timely service voids a subsequent default. The Court denies the motion, citing the discretion to dismiss an action for delay in service and the absence of authority for the proposition that a plaintiff's failure to serve the summons and complaint within 60 days voids the defendant's subsequent default.
