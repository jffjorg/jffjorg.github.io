  Case Number:  20STCV15001    Hearing Date:   March 12, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
considered the moving papers, the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On
April 20, 2020, Plaintiff Taylor Briscoe (“Plaintiff”) filed this action
against Defendants Heide Orellana (“Defendant”) and Does 1-50 for negligence. 
On
November 9, 2021, Plaintiff filed a proof of service showing substituted
service on Defendant of the summons, complaint, and other documents on November
2, 2021. 
On
February 17, 2022, Plaintiff filed a proof of service showing substituted
service on Defendant of a statement of damages on February 14, 2022. 
On March 29, 2022, the clerk entered Defendant’s default. 
On
July 15, 2022, the Court dismissed the action without prejudice. On March 3,
2023, the Court granted Plaintiff’s motion to vacate the dismissal. 
On
May 24, 2023, the Court dismissed the Doe defendants without prejudice at
Plaintiff’s request. 
On
November 17, 2023, the Court granted Intervenor Liberty Mutual Fire Insurance Company’s ex
parte application to intervene and to file an answer in intervention. 
On
November 27, 2023, Intervenor Liberty Mutual Fire
Insurance Company (“Intervenor”) filed an answer in intervention and a cross-complaint
against Cross-Defendants Roes 1-50 for equitable indemnity, contribution, and
declaratory relief. 
On
November 30, 2023, Intervenor filed a motion to set aside entry of default, to be heard on March 8, 2024. 
The Court continued the hearing to March 12, 2024.  Plaintiff has not filed an opposition. 
No trial
date is currently scheduled. 
INTERVENOR’S REQUEST 
Intervenor,
as Defendant’s insurer, asks the Court to set aside Defendant’s default. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
          Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (d), provides: 
“The court may, upon motion of the injured party, or
its own motion, correct clerical mistakes in its judgment or orders as entered,
so as to conform to the judgment or order directed, and may, on motion of
either party after notice to the other party, set aside any void judgment or
order.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 473,
subd. (d).)  California Rules of Court, rule 3.110(b), provides:  “The complaint must be served on all named defendants and proofs of service on those defendants must be filed with the court within 60 days of the filing of the complaint.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.110(b).) 
DISCUSSION 
          Intervenor argues that the Court should set
aside Defendant’s default because Plaintiff served the summons and complaint
more than 60 days after filing the complaint in violation of California Rules of Court, rule 3.110(b). 
          However, Intervenor has provided no authority showing that a failure to effect
timely service of the summons and complaint under California Rules of Court, rule 3.110(b), voids a
subsequent default for purposes of Code of Civil Procedure section 473,
subdivision (d).  The statutory and rule-based penalties for failing to effect timely service fall short of
requiring this result.  Under California
Rules of Court, rule 3.110(f), “If a party fails to serve and file pleadings as
required under [rule 3.110], and has not obtained an order extending time to
serve its pleadings, the court may issue an order to show cause why sanctions should
not be imposed.’  (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.110(f).)  “The court is presumably
limited to awarding monetary sanctions for violation of Rule 3.110.”  (Cal. Practice Guide, supra, ¶ 4:352,
p. 4-63.) 
          In addition, “the court has discretion to dismiss an action
for delay in service exceeding two years after filing a claim against the
defendant.” (Cal. Practice Guide, supra, ¶ 4:353, p. 4-64, citing Code
Civ. Proc., §§ 583.410, 583.420, subd. (a)(1).)  And “[i]f service is not completed within
three years, dismissal is mandatory.”  (Id.,
¶ 4:356, p. 4-64, citing Code Civ. Proc.,
§§ 583.2100, 583.250.) 
          It is not surprising that Intervenor has cited no authority
for the proposition that a plaintiff’s failure to serve the summons and
complaint within 60 days of filing the complaint voids the defendant’s
subsequent default.  It is not unusual
for a plaintiff to require more than 60 days to serve a defendant.  Here, for example, Defendant’s own counsel “has
made exhaustive attempts, including retaining a private investigator, to
contact and secure cooperation from [Defendant] to assist in her defense but
has been unsuccessful in contacting her.” 
(Motion p. 3.)  Allowing a defendant
to void her default after the plaintiff has attempted, without success, to
serve the defendant within 60 days of filing the complaint would only encourage
plaintiffs to evade service. 
          The Court denies the motion. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES Intervenor Liberty Mutual Fire Insurance Company’s motion to set
aside Defendant Heide Orellana’s default entered on March
29, 2022. 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
