And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling concerns an employment matter between plaintiff Jordan Getz and defendant Clear Vision Management, LLC. The plaintiff's deposition was scheduled for November 15, 2023, but was terminated early due to the plaintiff's counsel's medical condition. The defendant seeks terminating, evidentiary, and/or monetary sanctions against the plaintiff for misuse of the discovery process. However, the Judge finds that the delay was caused by medical issues and that the plaintiff is willing to proceed with the deposition. Therefore, the Judge will not award any sanctions at this time, but will order that the plaintiff's deposition take place within 20 days. The motion for sanctions is denied.
