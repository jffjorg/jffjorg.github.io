And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the motion for trial preference filed by the plaintiffs, Flavius Vamos, David Vamos, Rebeca Vamos, and Raluca Vamos, against defendants Park Sierra Properties II and GHP Management Corporation. The plaintiffs' children, David and Rebeca, are under the age of 14 and have a substantial interest in the case as tenants of the subject premises. The plaintiffs claim that the premises have habitability deficiencies, including toxic mold exposure, water damage, and insect infestations, which have caused them to suffer from breathing issues, congestion, allergies, and emotional distress. The defendants argue that their due process rights will be violated if the trial is granted, as they answered the complaint two-and-a-half months ago and only retained new counsel three-and-a-half months ago. However, the Judge finds that the language of Code Civ. Proc. § 36(b) is mandatory, and the defendants need only a reasonable time to prepare for the trial. The trial date is set for May 29, 2024.
