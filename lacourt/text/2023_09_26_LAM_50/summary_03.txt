## English Summary

This tentative ruling addresses a motion by defendants Dertad Teddy Bedjakian and 168 Entertainment, LLC ("Moving Defendants") to be awarded their attorney's fees following a trial in which they were found to be prevailing parties.

The Judge notes that the Moving Defendants' supporting declaration was not properly signed and therefore inadmissible. Additionally, the Judge found that the Moving Defendants had not adequately demonstrated the calculation of attorney's fees specifically incurred by 168 Entertainment.  

Due to these issues, the Judge denies the motion for attorney's fees.
