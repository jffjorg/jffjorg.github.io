Here is an English text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:
The Court issued a tentative ruling denying the Defendants' motion to strike portions of the Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint. The Court found that the Defendants' counsel's declaration did not demonstrate that the parties had met and conferred in person or by telephone regarding the complaint, as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 435.5. The Court had previously consolidated the Haller action with the Kumar action for pretrial purposes and ordered the parties to file a joint demurrer or motion to strike. However, the Defendants' motion to strike was not a joint motion and was not properly noticed. Therefore, the hearing on the motion to strike is denied, and the Defendants are ordered to give notice of this order.

English text:

On September 26, 2023, Judge Hon. Rolf M. Treu of the Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles, issued a tentative ruling denying Defendants' motion to strike portions of Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint (FAC) in Case No. 22STCV19257. The case involves Plaintiffs Haller, LLC and Shaun Tan, and Defendants City of Los Angeles, Hollywood Arts Collective LP, Hollywood Arts Collective LLC, Thomas Safran and Associates Development, Inc., Thomas Safran and Associates. Inc., Morley Construction Company, and Benchmark Contractors Inc.

The FAC was filed on June 8, 2023, and alleges causes of action for inverse condemnation, nuisance, dangerous condition of public property, trespass, and negligence. Defendants filed a motion to strike portions of the FAC on August 23, 2023, but did not meet and confer in good faith with Plaintiffs regarding the FAC. The Court noted that pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 435.5, subdivision (a), before filing a motion to strike, the moving party must meet and confer in person or by telephone with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to the motion to strike for the purpose of determining if an agreement can be reached that resolves the objections to be raised in the motion to strike.

The ruling also noted that on August 2, 2023, the Court issued an Order in the related case, Jayesh Kumar v. The City of Los Angeles, et al., Case No. 22STCV11937 (the Kumar Action), indicating that the two cases would be consolidated for all pretrial, discovery, and motion purposes only. The operative pleadings filed in the Kumar Action and the Haller Action would remain separate, and Defendants may file one (1) Joint Demurrer and/or Motion to Strike as to the Third Amended Complaint in the Kumar Action and the First Amended Complaint in the Haller Action to be noticed pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure § 1005 for and heard by the Court on September 26, 2023.
