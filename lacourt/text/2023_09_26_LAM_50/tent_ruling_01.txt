TENTATIVE RULING
  RE:
 
DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO STRIKE PORTIONS OF PLAINTIFFS’ FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT
 




            Background 
On June 13, 2022, Haller, LLC (“Haller”) and Shaun
Tan (“Tan”) filed the instant action (the “Haller Action”) against a number of defendants.
Haller and Tan filed the operative First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) in the
instant action on June 8, 2023 against Defendants City of Los Angeles (the
“City”), Hollywood Arts Collective LP, Hollywood Arts Collective LLC, Thomas
Safran and Associates Development, Inc., Thomas Safran and Associates. Inc.,
Morley Construction Company, and Benchmark Contractors Inc. (collectively,
“Defendants”). The FAC in the Haller Action alleges causes of action for (1)
inverse condemnation, (2) nuisance, (3) dangerous condition of public property,
(4) trespass, and (5) negligence. 
On April
4, 2022, Plaintiff Jayesh Kumar (“Kumar”) filed an action against a number of
defendants in the matter Jayesh Kumar v. The City of Los Angeles, et
al., Case No. 22STCV11937 (the “Kumar Action”). On June 8, 2023, Kumar
filed the operative Third Amended Complaint (“TAC”) in the Kumar Action against
the City and a number of other defendants. The TAC alleges causes of
action for (1) breach of lease, (2) nuisance, (3) trespass, and (4) dangerous
condition of public property.  
The Court notes that on August 2, 2023,
the Court issued an Order in the Kumar Action indicating that “IT IS HEREBY
ORDERED that Case Nos. 22STCV11937 (Kumar Action) and 
22STCV19257 (Haller Action) be
consolidated for all pretrial, discovery, and motion purposes only. Case
No. 22STCV11937 (Kumar Action) will be the Lead Case. The operative pleadings
filed in the Kumar Action and the Haller Action will remain separate. Defendants
may file one (1) Joint Demurrer and/or Motion to Strike as to the Third Amended
Complaint in the Kumar Action and the First Amended Complaint in the Haller
Action to be noticed pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure § 1005 for
and heard by the Court on September 26, 2023. If the issue of Haller being both
a plaintiff and a defendant is resolved, the parties may submit a further
stipulation to consolidate the cases for trial…” 
            The Court notes that a “Hearing on Demurrer – with
Motion to Strike” was scheduled in the instant Haller Action for September 26,
2023 at 2:00 p.m. On August 23, 2023, Defendants filed a motion to strike
portions of Plaintiff’s FAC in the Haller Action. The Court notes that the motion
appears to incorrectly state that it will be heard on November 1, 2023. No
opposition to this motion was filed, and the motion is not a joint motion as
provided for in the Court’s August 2, 2023 Order in the Kumar Action. 
Discussion 
As
an initial matter, Defendants’ counsel’s declaration in support of the motion
to strike indicates, inter alia, that “[o]n or about May 31, 2023,
Plaintiffs provided a second draft of the FAC as a result of the meet and confer efforts.” (Le Decl., ¶ 9.)
Defendants’ counsel states that “[o]n June 5, 2023, counsel for the City
e-mailed Plaintiffs’ counsel additional deficiencies of the second draft of the FAC,” and that “[c]ounsel for
Defendants and Plaintiffs agreed to disagree.” (Le Decl., ¶¶ 10-11.) The Court notes
that Defendants’ counsel’s declaration does not
demonstrate that the parties met and conferred by telephone or in person
regarding the FAC filed on June 8, 2023, which is the
subject of Defendants’ instant motion to strike.  
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 435.5,
subdivision (a), “[b]efore filing a motion
to strike…the moving party shall meet and confer in person or by
telephone with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to the
motion to strike for the purpose of determining if an agreement can be reached
that resolves the objections to be raised in the motion to strike.” (Emphasis
added.)¿Such meeting and conferring must be done in good faith with an
effort to try to resolve the issues subject to the motion to strike.
In light of the foregoing, the hearing on Defendants’ motion to strike is denied.¿ 
Defendants are ordered to give notice of this order.¿¿
