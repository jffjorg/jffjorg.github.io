Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English:

The Judge has denied the Petitioner's (WIB Holdings LLC) petition to compel arbitration with the Respondent (Kristi Pinocchio) in a dispute arising from their rental agreement. The Judge found that the Petitioner did not demonstrate the existence of a valid, binding arbitration agreement between the parties. The Petitioner had attached a copy of the arbitration agreement to their petition, but it was not signed by both parties. The Judge relied on California Code of Civil Procedure § 1281.2, which requires a valid arbitration agreement to exist before a court can order arbitration. The Judge also cited several case laws, including Henry v. Alcove Investment, Inc. and EFund Capital Partners v. Pless, to support their decision. The Judge ordered the Petitioner to provide notice and file a proof of service of the denial of their petition.
