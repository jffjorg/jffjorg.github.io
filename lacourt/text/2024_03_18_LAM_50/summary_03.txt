And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge, Judge Beaudet, has disclosed that she and her husband purchased a pickup truck 24 years ago that developed electrical problems. The manufacturer and dealer eventually agreed to refund the purchase price without litigation. However, Judge Beaudet has disclosed that she may be recused from the case due to her potential bias. She has given the parties until April 2, 2024, to file and serve a verified statement of disqualification. If the parties do not file a statement, they will be deemed to have waived their right to recusal. The Case Management Conference will be continued to June 13, 2024, unless both parties waive the right to file a statement.
