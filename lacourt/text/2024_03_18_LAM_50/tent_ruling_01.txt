  ORDER RE:  
 
DEFENDANTS’
  MOTION FOR JUDGMENT ON THE PLEADINGS




AND RELATED CROSS-ACTION


 



 
Background
Plaintiffs Craig
L. Dixon; Kathleen Gay Dixon; Craig L. Dixon, Kathleen Gay Dixon and Andrew
Dixon, Trustees of the Restated Dixon Family Trust U/D/O April 23, 2014; Azalea
Gardens; and Pioneer SG, LLC (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) filed this action on
October 13, 2020 against Defendants Frederick Kenneth Kramer, a/k/a Kevin Dosh,
Darren Kikuchi (“Kikuchi”), Cynthia Barron (“Barron”), Joyce Cook (“Cook”),
Betty Cannon (“Cannon”), Tony Wim Struyk, Lee Stein (“Stein”), and Oakcrest
Manor SD, Inc. 
On May 24, 2021, Plaintiffs filed the operative First Amended
Complaint (“FAC”), alleging twenty causes of action.
On July 12, 2021, Frederick Kenneth Kramer filed a Cross-Complaint
against Craig L. Dixon; Craig L. Dixon, Kathleen Gay Dixon and Andrew Dixon,
Trustees of the Restated Dixon Family Trust U/D/O April 23, 2014; Azalea
Gardens; and Pioneer SG, LLC. The Cross-Complaint alleges nine causes of
action. 
Frederick Kenneth Kramer (“Kramer”) now moves for judgment on the
pleadings as to portions of Plaintiffs’ FAC. Barron and Cook join in the
motion. Kikuchi, Cannon, and Stein also join in the motion. Kramer’s motion is
unopposed. 
Discussion 
As an initial matter,
the Court notes that Kramer’s counsel’s declaration filed in support of
the motion provides, inter alia, “I attempted to engage in a meet and
confer conversations with Plaintiff’s counsel, Mr. Chad Pehrson, by sending him
an email on January 6, 2024. In this email I explained the grounds for the
Judgment on the Pleadings as many of Dr. Dixon’s claims are time-barred. This
email was not responded to, and there was no out of office reply. On the
morning of January 10, 2024, my co-counsel, Ms. Anne Potiker, sent a follow-up
email to Mr. Pehrson in which she alerted him to the desire to meet and confer.
She informed him that Defendant would be filing the Judgment on the Pleadings
motion later that day if we received no response.” (Monks Decl., ¶ 2.) Kramer’s
counsel further states that “Mr. Pehrson responded to Ms. Swenson’s email. In
turn, we engaged in a back-and-forth short email discussion. I understand Mr.
Pehrson did not have a comment on the substance of the reasons of the Judgment
on the Pleadings [sic] and reserved making comment until he had read it. In
return, I indicated to him we would be filing the motion.” (Monks Decl., ¶ 3.) 
The Court notes that Kramer’s counsel’s declaration does not demonstrate that the parties met
and conferred in person, by telephone, or by video
conference regarding Kramer’s motion
for judgment on the pleadings, or that Kramer’s counsel attempted to do so. 
 Pursuant to Code
of Civil Procedure section 439, subdivision (a), “[b]efore
filing a motion for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to this chapter, the
moving party shall meet and confer in person, by telephone, or by video
conference with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to the
motion for judgment on the pleadings for the purpose of determining if an
agreement can be reached that resolves the claims to be raised in the motion
for judgment on the pleadings. If an amended pleading is filed, the responding
party shall meet and confer again with the party who filed the amended pleading
before filing a motion for judgment on the pleadings against the amended
pleading.” (Emphasis
added.) Such meeting and conferring
must be done in good faith with an effort to try to resolve the issues subject
to the motion for judgment on the pleadings. 

In addition, on March 14, 2024, counsel for Craig L. Dixon and
Kathleen Gay Dixon filed a declaration stating, inter alia, that “[o]n
June 14, 2022, Counsel for the Dixon Parties specifically communicated in
writing to counsel for Mr. Kramer/Dosch, stating as follows: ‘Pursuant to Code
of Civil Procedure section 1010.6(a) . . . We request all documents to be
served on us electronically, as the sole method of service; you should email
documents to: jadamson@kba.law, cpehrson@kba.law, calendar@kba.law.” (Pehrson
Decl., ¶ 2.)[1] Mr.
Pehrson states that “[o]n January 10, 2024, Counsel for Mr. Kramer Dosch
emailed, only to cpehrson@kba.law and jadamson@kba.law, and not
calendar@kba.law, as follows: ‘Please see the attached Notice of Motion and
Motion for Judgement on the Pleadings and accompanying documents.’” (Pehrson
Decl., ¶ 3, Ex. A, emphasis omitted.) Mr. Pehrson asserts that “[a]s a
practical matter, due to the non-service, neither the motion nor any supposed
hearing date was processed as being served or calendared by Counsel for the
Dixon Parties.” (Pehrson Decl., ¶ 4.) 
Mr. Pehrson also asserts that “[t]he Proof of Service attached to the
January 10, 2024 email purports that the Motion was also sent via mail. I
believe this to be an inaccurate statement. Neither I nor any other counsel for
the Dixon Parties ever received any copy of the Motion and Notice via mail.”
(Pehrson Decl., ¶ 5.) 
In light of the foregoing,
the hearing on Kramer’s motion
for judgment on the pleadings is continued to _______________, 2024 at 2
p.m. in Dept. 50.  
Kramer
is¿ordered to meet¿and confer¿with Plaintiffs within 10 days of the date of this order.¿If the
parties are unable to resolve the pleading issues¿or if the parties are
otherwise unable to meet and confer in good faith, Kramer is to¿thereafter¿file
and serve¿a declaration setting forth the efforts to meet and confer in
compliance with Code of Civil Procedure section 439,
subdivision (a)(3) within 15 days of this order.¿
In
addition, the parties may file and serve opposition and reply briefs per Code of Civil Procedure section 1005, subdivision (b), based on
the continued hearing date. Kramer
may file a new reply brief that will supersede the previously filed reply
papers. 
Kramer is ordered to give notice of this order.
