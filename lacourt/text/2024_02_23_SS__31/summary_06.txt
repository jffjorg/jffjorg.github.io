Here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the defendant's motion to compel the plaintiff to submit to an additional deposition. The plaintiff, Yvette Ortiz, filed an action against the defendants, Westfield, LLC, and others, alleging that she slipped and fell on water near the door of the restroom on June 9, 2019. The defendants moved to compel the plaintiff to submit to an additional deposition to cover new factual issues that have arisen since the first deposition, including the plaintiff's forced retirement and hip replacement surgery. The plaintiff does not oppose the motion. The judge finds that the defendants have demonstrated good cause for the second deposition and grants the motion. The parties are ordered to meet and confer to schedule the remote deposition within 30 days, and the trial date remains set for June 11, 2024.
