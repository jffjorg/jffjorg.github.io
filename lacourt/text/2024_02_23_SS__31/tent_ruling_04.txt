 Case Number:  20STCV30675    Hearing Date:   February 23, 2024    Dept:  31 SUPERIOR COURT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA  FOR THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES - CENTRAL DISTRICT  KENYCE SMITH, ET AL., Plaintiff(s),  vs.  CODY ARAGHACHI, ET AL.,  Defendant(s). ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) )       CASE NO: 20STCV30675  [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: (1) DEFENDANTS’ MOTIONS TO COMPEL; (2) DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO DEEM REQUESTS FOR ADMISSION ADMITTED  Dept. 31 1:30 p.m.  February 23, 2024  I.  Motions to Compel A. Plaintiff Smith Defendants Uber Technologies, Inc., Rasier, LLC, and Rasier-CA, LLC ("Uber Defendants”) propounded special interrogatories, set one, and request for production of documents, set one, on Plaintiff Kenyce Smith (“Plaintiff Smith”) on July 21, 2023. After receiving no responses, defense counsel sent a meet and confer letter to Plaintiffs’ counsel requesting that responses be provided, without objections, no later than October 6, 2023. However, as of the motion filing date, Plaintiffs have not served responses. The Uber Defendants therefore seek an order compelling Plaintiffs to respond, without objections, to the outstanding discovery and to pay sanctions. Plaintiff Smith opposes the motions, arguing they served verified responses, without objections, to all the outstanding discovery on February 6, 2024. The Court notes that Plaintiff’s opposition is Noticed as “Opposition to Defendant, CODY ARAGHCHI’S Motion to Deem, Admissions and Motion to Compel.” The moving papers pertain to the Uber Defendants. Further, Plaintiffs’ counsel’s declaration is not signed.  Nonetheless, Defendants in reply concede that Plaintiff Smith did serve responses after the instant motion was filed, but argue sanctions are still warranted because the responses were untimely.   Based on the foregoing, the Court finds that the motion to compel Plaintiff Smith moot in light of the responses served on the Uber prior to the hearing. (St. Mary v. Superior Court (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 762, 776.) The only remaining issue is monetary sanctions, discussed further below.    B. Plaintiff Grey The Uber Defendants propounded special interrogatories, set one on Plaintiff Abigail Grey (“Plaintiff Grey”) on July 21, 2023. After receiving no response, defense counsel sent a meet and confer letter to Plaintiff’s counsel requesting that responses be provided, without objections, no later than October 6, 2023. However, as of the motion filing date, Plaintiff Grey has not served responses. The Uber Defendants therefore seek an order compelling Plaintiff Grey to respond, without objections, to the outstanding discovery and to pay sanctions. For a motion to compel discovery responses, all a propounding party must show is that it properly served its discovery requests, that the time to respond has expired, and that the party to whom the requests were directed failed to provide a timely response. (See Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902, 905 906.) Where a party fails to serve timely responses to discovery requests, the court may make an order compelling responses. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290; 2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.) A party that fails to serve timely responses waives any objections to the request, including ones based on privilege or the protection of attorney work product. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a); § 2031.300, subd. (a).)     Here, no opposition or further papers were received pertaining to Plaintiff Grey, and there is no evidence that Plaintiff Grey served verified responses to the outstanding discovery. Therefore, because the evidence shows Plaintiff Grey was properly served with discovery and failed to respond, the Uber Defendants’ unopposed motion is GRANTED.  Plaintiff Grey is ordered to serve verified responses to the Uber Defendants’ special interrogatories, set one, without objections, within fifteen (15) days. (2030.290(a),(b).)  II. Motion to Deem RFAs Admitted On July 21, 2023, the Uber Defendants served on Plaintiff Smith request for admission (“RFAs”), set one. After receiving no responses, the Uber Defendants filed the instant motion to deem RFAs admitted against Plaintiff.   In opposition, Plaintiff’s counsel declares that he served verified responses on February 7, 2024. Plaintiff’s counsel’s declaration is unsigned.  Regardless, the Uber Defendants acknowledge Plaintiff Smith indeed served untimely responses on February 7, 2024.  Based on the foregoing, the Uber Defendants motion to deem RFAs, set one, admitted against Plaintiff Smith is moot. (Cal. Code Civ. Proc §2033.280(c); St. Mary v. Superior Court (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 762, 776.)   III. Sanctions Sanctions are mandatory against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling, unless a court makes certain findings.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., 2031.300(c).)¿ Further, “It is mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion.”  (CCP § 2033.280(c).)  The Uber Defendants are awarded 1 hour to prepare each motion and one hour to appear at the hearing (awarded only once), all at the requested rate of $250 per hour, for a total of $1,250 in attorney’s fees. Further, the Uber Defendants are awarded four motion filing fees of $61.65, for a total of $246.60, as costs.       Plaintiffs Smith and Grey are represented by the same counsel of record. Sanctions are imposed against Plaintiffs and Plaintiffs’ counsel, jointly and severally. Plaintiffs and/or Plaintiffs’ counsel are ordered to pay sanctions to the Uber Defendants, by and through counsel of record, in the total amount of $1,496.60, within twenty (20) days.  Moving party is ordered to give notice.    PLEASE TAKE NOTICE: Parties are encouraged to meet and confer after reading this tentative ruling to see if they can reach an agreement. If a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling,¿the party must send an email to the court at¿sscdept31@lacourt.org¿with the Subject line “SUBMIT” followed by the case number.¿ The body of the email must include the hearing date and time, counsel’s contact information, and the identity of the party submitting.¿¿ Unless¿all¿parties submit by email to this tentative ruling, the parties should arrange to appear remotely (encouraged) or in person for oral argument.¿ You should assume that others may appear at the hearing to argue.¿¿ If the parties neither submit nor appear at hearing, the Court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the Court.¿ After the Court has issued a tentative ruling, the Court may prohibit the withdrawal of the subject motion without leave.¿  Dated this 22nd day of February 2024      Hon.
