And here is the English summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion to set aside the default and default judgment against defendants Tom Cong Tran (Doe 1) and Daniel Tran (formerly known as Dinh Tran) (Does 2 and 3). The defendants filed the motion on May 9, 2023, which is within the six-month time limit for mandatory relief under CCP ยง 473(b). The Judge finds that defense counsel's mistaken belief that the amendments to complaint were not properly served led to the defaults and default judgment. The Judge also notes that defense counsel's affidavit provides a straightforward admission of fault, which is sufficient to set aside the dismissal. The motion is granted, and the defaults and default judgment are set aside. The defendants are ordered to file a separate copy of their proposed Answer within ten days of this Order.
