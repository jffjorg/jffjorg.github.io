And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Jesus Cruz, et al. vs David Assouline, et al. (Case Number: 18STCV08330). The plaintiffs had requested a default judgment against the defendant, but the court denied the request on February 9, 2024, due to defects in the default judgment package. The court instructed the plaintiffs to correct these defects and file a new default judgment package by February 16, 2024. However, the plaintiffs failed to do so, and the court has now ordered the complaint filed by the plaintiffs (Yesenia Galindo and Jesus Cruz) dismissed without prejudice.
