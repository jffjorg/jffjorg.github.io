And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge, Michelle C. Kim, has issued a tentative ruling on the motions filed by the Uber Defendants (Cody Araghachi, Uber Technologies, Inc., Rasier, LLC, and Rasier-CA, LLC) regarding Plaintiff Kenyce Smith and Plaintiff Abigail Grey. The motions are to compel discovery responses and to deem requests for admission admitted.

Regarding Plaintiff Smith, the Judge finds that the motion to compel discovery responses is moot since Plaintiff Smith has already served responses. The Uber Defendants' motion to deem requests for admission admitted is also moot since Plaintiff Smith has served untimely responses.

Regarding Plaintiff Grey, the Judge grants the Uber Defendants' motion to compel discovery responses since Plaintiff Grey has failed to respond to the discovery requests. The Judge orders Plaintiff Grey to serve verified responses to the Uber Defendants' special interrogatories, set one, without objections, within 15 days.

The Judge also awards sanctions against Plaintiffs Smith and Grey, jointly and severally, for a total amount of $1,496.60, to be paid within 20 days. The sanctions include attorney's fees and costs.
