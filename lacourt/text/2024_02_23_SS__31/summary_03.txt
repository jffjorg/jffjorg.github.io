And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has granted the plaintiff's request for default judgment against defendants Igor Kukharchuk and Ina Kuhr in the amount of $23,753.20, which includes $8,753.20 for special damages, $15,000 for general damages, and $3,944.46 for costs. The plaintiff suffered an infection and received medical treatment for a dog bite on the defendants' premises, and the court has found that the plaintiff's medical expenses are reasonable and supported by evidence. The court has also reduced the amount of general damages from the requested $100,000 to $15,000, in line with similar jury verdicts. The court has also taxed the "Investigation" fee of $2,670 from the costs award, as it is not an allowable cost under CCP section 1033.5.
