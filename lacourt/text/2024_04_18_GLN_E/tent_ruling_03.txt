[TENTATIVE
RULING ON MOTION FOR RELIEF FROM WAIVER OF OBJECTIONS] 
 
RELIEF REQUESTED 
Defendant, Modera Event Venue, Inc., seeks an order relieving them from waiver
of objections in response to Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatories, Set One, served
on November 2, 2023.
 
This Motion is based upon the fact
that Modera Event Venue, Inc. failed to timely respond to Form Interrogatories,
Set One, due to counsel’s mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. Due to a
conflict in representation, Cullins & Grandy LLP will no longer be
representing Modera Event Venue, Inc. In the process of transferring
representation to new counsel, Cullins & Grandy LLP failed to timely serve
a response to Form Interrogatories, Set One.
 
This Motion is brought pursuant to
Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.290(a) and 2033.280(a) and is based upon
this Notice, the Memorandum of Points and Authorities, the Declaration of
Allison L. Grandy and any attached exhibits as well as any oral arguments or
further evidence brought at the hearing of this matter.

ANALYSIS
CCP
§2030.290(a) states:

If a party to whom interrogatories are
directed fails to serve a timely response, the following rules apply:
(a) The party to whom the interrogatories
are directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under
Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to the interrogatories, including
one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4
(commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that
party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied:
 
(1) The party has subsequently served a
response that is in substantial compliance with Sections 2030.210, 2030.220,
2030.230, and 2030.240.
(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely
response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.
 
(CCP §2030.290(a)(1)-(2).)
 
Discussion
– CCP § 2030.290(a)(1)
“The party has subsequently served a response
that is in substantial compliance with Sections 2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230,
and 2030.240.” (CCP §2030.290(a)(1).)
Here, Defendant’s
motion, nor its declaration, nor its exhibits attached to the motion indicate
that Defendant has subsequently served any responses to the discovery in which
Defendant seeks to be granted relief from waiver of its objections.
Discussion
– § 2030.290(a)(2)
“The party’s failure to serve a timely
response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.” (CCP §
2030.290(a)(2).)
Defendant’s counsel,
Allison L. Grandy, states that initially State Farm Automobile Insurance
Company retained her firm to represent the insured Defendants Mihran Y. Meguerian
and Ivet Grigoryan in connection with the motor vehicle accident giving rise to
this litigation. (Decl. Grandy ¶2.) 
Grandy then states
that after litigation began, Plaintiff filed a Doe Amendment naming Modera
Event Venue, Inc. as Doe 11, and that although Grandy’s office filed an Answer
for Modera, a conflict in the representation subsequently arose which resulted
in State Farm appointing separate counsel for Modera. (Decl. Grandy ¶3.)
Grandy states that Plaintiff
propounded Form Interrogatories, Set One, on Modera. (Grandy Decl. ¶4.) 
Grandy’s motion
explains that she was granted extensions to respond to the discovery. 
Confusingly, Grandy
explains that she requested a further extension to February 1, 2024, but that
Plaintiff never responded to the request for extension. This is confusing
because Grandy also states that Plaintiff sent a meet-and-confer letter stating
that responses were due by February 14, 2024. 
Grandy then explains
that the February 14, 2024 deadline was not calendared in her firm’s system
because the correspondence was not sent to the firm’s e-service email and the
attorney handling this matter failed to calendar the February 14, 2024
deadline.
Grandy explains that
the sole reason to respond to the deadline for Form Interrogatories, Set One,
was not met due to her mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect of her
office.
Here, Defendant does
not provide any case law directly on point which would support Grandy’s actions
being considered mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
Although not
directly on point, the court in Bettencourt v. Los Rios Community College
Dist. (1986) 42 Cal.3d 270, 276 examined whether there was excusable
neglect for an attorney’s failure to file a claim with the correct public
entity. 
The court in
Bettencourt stated that when deciding whether counsel’s error is
excusable, the court looks to: 
(1) the nature of the mistake or neglect, and 
(2) whether counsel was otherwise diligent in investigating
and pursuing the claim. 
(Id.)

Further in Bettencourt,
the court noted that in examining the mistake or neglect, the court inquires
whether “a reasonably prudent person under the same or similar circumstances”
might have made the same error.
Here, the
Court is not entirely convinced by Grandy’s confusion as to not serving timely responses
under the belief that new counsel would be appearing and serving responses for
Modera. 
The
substitution of attorney notice for Grandy was filed on 3/29/2024. The Court is
unclear why Grandy was unaware that she was still acting as Defendant’s counsel
prior to the substitution of attorney notice being filed.
TENTATIVE
RULING
Defendant’s motion is DENIED. 
Defendant did not
state, nor did Defendant provide proof that it subsequently served responses
that are in substantial compliance with §§ 2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, and
2030.240. 
Defendant therefore
did not meet the requirements of § 2030.290(a)(1) to be granted relief from
waiver of objections. 
Further, Defendant did
not show that its failure to serve a timely response was the result of mistake,
inadvertence, or excusable neglect.
