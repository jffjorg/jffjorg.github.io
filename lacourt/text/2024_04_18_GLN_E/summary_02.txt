And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge will hear from the parties on the motion for protective order. The motion was filed by the defendants on March 8, 2024, and was taken off calendar on March 11, 2024. The opposition argues that sanctions should be imposed against the defendants for their alleged failure to produce evidence and for their attempt to withdraw the motion without giving the plaintiff adequate time to respond. The opposition cites California Code of Civil Procedure sections 2025.420(h) and 2023.020 in support of its argument. The judge will consider the parties' arguments and make a final ruling on the motion.
