And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling grants the defendants' motion to strike Jirair Krikor Kiladjian from the Second Amended Complaint. The court finds that the defendants' argument that the plaintiff cannot add a new party to the complaint without permission is more persuasive. The court notes that the plaintiff's opposition is untimely and lacks evidence to support its argument. The court also finds that the plaintiff's counsel did not provide a transcript of the demurrer hearing, and the minute order is silent on the issue of adding new parties. The court grants the motion to strike, finding that the defendants' arguments are more persuasive than the plaintiff's.
