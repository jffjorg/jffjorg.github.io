Case Name: ERIC CHEN, et al. v. JAMES WU, et al.
TENTATIVE
RULING ON MOTION FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER 
TENTATIVE RULING
The
instant motion for protective order was filed on 3/8/2024 by Defendants James
Wu and Wen Huang. On 3/11/2024, Defendants’ counsel filed a notice taking the
motion for protective order set for April 18, 2024 off calendar. 
An Opposition was filed wherein the Opposition states
that sanctions are still at issue. Opposition cites CCP § 2025.420(h) which
states, “The court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with § 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully
makes or opposes a motion for a protective order, unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (CCP § 2025.420(h).)

Opposition also cites CCP § 2023.020 which states, “Notwithstanding
the outcome of the particular discovery motion, the court shall impose a
monetary sanction ordering that any party or attorney who fails to confer as
required pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by
anyone as a result of that conduct.” Opposition argues that sanctions should be
imposed against Defendants based on the following timeline of alleged events :
3. I personally took the
deposition of the person most qualified at All Good Escrow on January 24, 2024.
At that deposition, All Good Escrow produced an email sent by Wen Huang. A true
and correct copy of that email is attached hereto and incorporated herein as
Exhibit 1. 
4. To the best of my
knowledge, this email had not been produced in discovery prior to that
deposition. Therefore, we served a subpoena (the “Subpoena”) for personal
appearance on Ms. Huang. 
5. At the time we sent
the Subpoena, we were not aware, to the best of my knowledge, that Ms. Huang
was married to Defendant James Wu (“Defendant”). 
6. On March 6, 2024, at
10:40 AM, counsel for Defendant sent a meet and confer stating Ms. Huang’s
deposition testimony would be “subject to the privileges in Evidence Code
section 970 and 980,” but did not state that Ms. Huang was the wife of
Defendant. A true and correct copy of that email is attached hereto and
incorporated herein as Exhibit 2. 
7. On March 8, 2024, at
9:50 AM, Defendant filed the instant motion without leaving Plaintiffs adequate
time to respond to the meet and confer. A true and correct email serving the
Motion is attached hereto and incorporated herein as Exhibit 3. For the sake of
economy, the motion is not included herein. 
8. On March 11, 2024, I
sent an email to counsel offering to withdraw the Subpoena if Plaintiff
withdrew the Motion. A true and correct copy of that email is attached hereto
and incorporated herein as Exhibit 4. 
9. That same day,
Defendant agreed. A true and correct copy of that email is attached hereto and
incorporated herein as Exhibit 5. 
10. On March 11, 2024,
Defendant filed a withdrawal of the Motion.
11. On March 20, 2024,
Pfrancez Quijano of my office emailed Defendant’s counsel, Lyle Mink, to advise
the Motion was still on calendar and that, per the Clerk, Defendant’s counsel
had to call the department to take it off calendar. For reasons unknown, Mr.
Mink refused to do so. A true and correct copy of that email is attached hereto
and incorporated herein as Exhibit 6.
(Decl.
Changala ¶¶3-11.)
Opposition also states
that the Defendants should bear the cost of this opposition. 
A Reply was submitted
that stated, “This motion was taken off calendar by a notice of taking off
calendar filed in this action on March 11, 2024.”
TENTATIVE RULING
The
Court will hear from the parties.
