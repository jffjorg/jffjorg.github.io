[1] Respondents and Real Parties contend
that Petitioner’s reply brief improperly introduced new legal arguments and failed

However, the Court allowed Respondents and Real Parties to file a sur-reply
addressing any evidence or argument raised for the first time in the Reply. 


[2] The Court rejects Respondents’ argument
that Petitioner waived these arguments.
