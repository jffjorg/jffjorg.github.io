Here is the English summary of the tentative ruling:

The tentative ruling denies Plaintiff Cynthia Juarez's motion for reconsideration of the Court's denial of her ex parte application. The Court finds that the Plaintiff's argument is based on the same argument that she advanced in her ex parte motion, and that the Court was made aware of the rule regarding electronic service at the hearing. The Court also finds that the Defendant's service of the summary judgment motion was adequate. The Court denies the Plaintiff's motion for reconsideration.
