         vs.
 
COUNTY
  OF LOS ANGELES, et al. 
 


 Case No.: 
  21STCV36851
 
 
 
 Hearing
  Date: May 17, 2024



 
 
            Plaintiff’s
motion for reconsideration is DENIED.
 
            On
10/5/2021, Plaintiff Cynthia Juarez (Plaintiff) filed suit against County of
Los Angeles, Billy Nettles, and Andrea Wood, alleging: (1) whistleblower
retaliation; (2) civil rights: free speech; (3) failure to provide a safe
workplace; (4) failure to provide a safe workplace; (5) failure to provide a
safe workplace; and (6) defamation. 
 
            On
4/22/2024, Plaintiff moves for reconsideration of this Court’s denial of her ex
parte application to strike Defendants’ MSJ.
 
Discussion 
 
            Plaintiff
seeks reconsideration of the Court’s 4/18/2024 denial of her ex parte motion. 
 
CCP section
1008 provides that a party may “based upon new or different facts,
circumstances, or law, make application to the same judge or court that made
the order, to reconsider the matter and modify, amend, or revoke the prior
order.” (CCP § 1008(a)-(b).)
 
Here,
Plaintiff’s argument is based on the same argument that she advanced in her ex
parte—i.e., that Defendants’ summary judgment motion was not timely served. (See
Plaintiff’s Motion at 2:3-4:6.) Plaintiff contends that “new or different
facts, circumstances, or law” exists here based on an argument that the Court
“had not heard” of the rule providing for two additional days’ notice for
electronic service. 
 
First, any
suggestion that this Court somehow misinterpreted or misapplied relevant law in
its ruling is not a proper basis for reconsideration. (See, e.g., Gilberd v.
AC Transit (1995) 32 Cal.App.4th 1494, 1500 (“What respondent essentially
argues is that section 1008 does not apply when the litigant disagrees with the
trial court’s ruling. Since in almost all instances, the losing party will
believe that the trial court's ‘different’ interpretation of the law or facts
was erroneous, to interpret the statute as the respondent urges would be
contrary to the clear legislative intent” of the statute).
 
            Second,
as Plaintiff admits in her Motion, at the hearing on Plaintiff’s Ex Parte
Application, Defendants’ counsel confirmed the rule regarding electronic
service to the Court (see Plaintiff’s Motion at 4:22-25.) As such, the Court
was made aware of the rule at the hearing. 
 
            Third,
CCP section 1011 prescribes the manner and method by which “personal service”
may be made. Pertinent here, it provides that “if the attorney’s office is not
open,” and the attorney’s residential address is not known, “then service may
be made by putting the notice or papers, enclosed in a sealed envelope, into
the post office or a mail box, subpost office, substation, or mail chute or
other like facility regularly maintained by the Government of the United States
directed to the attorney at his or her office.” (CCP § 1011(a).) 
 
            Here,
as detailed in the Declaration of Oscar A. Bustos in Support of Defendants’
Opposition to Plaintiff’s Ex Parte Application, Defendants’ counsel personally
delivered Defendants’ Motion to Plaintiff’s counsel’s office at 3:40 p.m. on
March 29, 2024, and left the Motion at the door of Plaintiff’s counsel’s office
because it was closed (even though it was during normal business hours). (See
Bustos Decl. ISO Opp. to Ex Parte Application, ¶¶ 2-6.) Because the office was
closed and Defendants’ counsel did not know Plaintiff’s counsel’s residential
address, Defendants’ counsel also mailed the Motion to Plaintiff’s counsel’s
office the same day in accordance with the above provisions of Code of Civil
Procedure § 1011. (See Bustos Decl. ISO Opp. to Ex Parte Application, ¶ 8.) In
addition, as a courtesy, Defendants’ counsel also provided an electronic copy
of Defendants’ Motion to Plaintiff’s counsel by email that same day. (See
Bustos Decl. ISO Opp. to Ex Parte Application, ¶ 7.)  Accordingly, the Court finds Defendant’s
service to be adequate. 
 
            Based
on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s motion for reconsideration is denied. 
 
 
It is
so ordered.

TENTATIVE RULING
 



CYNTHIA
  JUAREZ 
                           
         vs.
 
COUNTY
  OF LOS ANGELES, et al. 
 


 Case No.: 
  21STCV36851
 
 
 
 Hearing
  Date: May 17, 2024



 
Plaintiff’s
motions are DENIED, WITHOUT PREJUDICE. Plaintiffs are instructed to informally
meet and confer. Only once such meet and confer has taken place, and only if
there are unable to reach an informal resolution, the parties are to contact
Department 17 to schedule an IDC.
 
On 10/5/2021,
Plaintiff Cynthia Juarez (Plaintiff) filed suit against County of Los Angeles,
Billy Nettles, and Andrea Wood, alleging: (1) whistleblower retaliation; (2)
civil rights: free speech; (3) failure to provide a safe workplace; (4) failure
to provide a safe workplace; (5) failure to provide a safe work place; and (6)
defamation. 
 
            On
4/22/2024, Plaintiff moved to compel further responses to her Form
Interrogatories (General) from Defendant Woods and Defendant Nettles.
 
            As
a preliminary matter, the Court requires that parties participate in an
informal discovery conference (IDC) before motions to compel further can be
heard on the merits. 
 
            Second,
the Court concludes there has been inadequate meet and confer prior to the filing
of these motions. Indeed, Defendants submitted declarations stating that before
filing these motions, Plaintiff never once identified any issues with the
respective Defendants regarding their substantive responses to Form
Interrogatories Nos. 2.7, 12.1, or 16.1. (Bustos Decl., ¶ 3.)  
 
            While
Plaintiff sent an email to Defendants regarding Form Interrogatory No. 15, the
email demanded that Defendants’ counsel advise him “by the end of the day
whether [Defendants] will amend the responses to form interrogatory 15.1 ….”
(Bustos Decl., ¶ 4.) Such a message amounts to an “ultimatum,” not an
invitation to meet and confer to attempt to informally resolve this issue.
(Bustos Decl., ¶ 4.)
 
            Based
on the forgoing, Plaintiff’s motions are denied, without prejudice. Plaintiffs
are instructed to informally meet and confer. Only once such meet and confer
has taken place, and only if there are unable to reach an informal resolution,
the parties are to contact Department 17 to schedule an IDC. 
 
 
It is
so ordered.
