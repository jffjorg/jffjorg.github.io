And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English:

Judge Theresa M. Traber has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Carlos Torres, et al. v. Alvarado LLC, et al. (Case Number: 21STCV14627). The case involves a motion by Attorney Michael J. Danner to be relieved as counsel for Defendant Alvarado LLC.

The judge has determined that the motion should be granted due to a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship and the low risk of prejudice to the defendant. The judge notes that the defendant is not being represented and that counsel is not being paid. The judge sets a status conference to coincide with the case management conference on July 18, 2024, to address the retention of substitute counsel for the defendant.

The judge also notes that the plaintiff's counsel does not have standing to oppose the motion and that the plaintiff's declaration opposing the motion will not be considered. The judge orders that attorney Michael J. Danner give notice to all parties of the ruling and file proof of service with the court.
