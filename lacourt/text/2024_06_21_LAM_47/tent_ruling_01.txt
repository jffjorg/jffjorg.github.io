STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is an action for breach of contract and fraud. Plaintiffs allege
that Defendants breached a settlement agreement in a previous habitability
action. 
 
Attorney Michael J. Danner moves to
be relieved as counsel for Defendant Alvarado LLC
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Attorney Michael J. Danner moves to
be relieved as counsel for Defendant Alvarado LLC
 
Plaintiffs’ Improper Opposition
 
            Plaintiffs’
counsel, Ashley Soto, filed a declaration purporting to oppose the motion to be
relieved as counsel. As Plaintiff is not a party to the attorney-client
relationship at issue on this motion, Plaintiff does not have standing to
oppose this motion, nor does his counsel. The Court therefore refuses to
consider the Soto Declaration. 
Analysis
 
Moving counsel filed all three required forms (MC-051,
-052, and -053) and included a proof of service as required by California Rules
of Court rule 3.1362(d).  Moving counsel’s
declaration states that he served Defendant by mail at the P.O. box which is
his last known address. (MC-052 ¶ 3(a)(2).) Moving Counsel states that he
confirmed the address is current by conversation with an attorney who is in
contact with Moussa Kashani, the sole member of the LLC. (MC-052 ¶ 3(b)(1).)
Moving Counsel states that Kashani has no phone and is in the process of being
evicted from his current residence. (MC-052 ¶ 2.) 
 
In general, an attorney may withdraw with
or without cause so long as the withdrawal would not result in undue prejudice
to the client’s interest – i.e., counsel cannot withdraw at a critical point in
the litigation, because that would prejudice client, but can withdraw
otherwise. (Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal. App. 4th 904,
915.) The court has discretion to deny an attorney’s request to withdraw where
the withdrawal would work an injustice or cause undue delay in the proceeding,
but the court’s discretion in this area is to be exercised reasonably. (Mandell
v. Superior Court (1977) 67 Cal.App.3d 1, 4.)   
 
Here, the matter is not yet set for trial,
and the only other hearing on calendar is a Status Conference and Case
Management Conference at 8:30 AM on July 18, 2024. (MC-052 ¶¶ 4, 6.) The risk
of prejudice to Defendant is therefore low. Moving Counsel’s declaration states
that the sole member of the LLC will not communicate with him, and Moving
Counsel is not being paid for his services, and, therefore, it is not possible
to continue representing Defendant. (MC-052 ¶ 2.) Given the evidence of a
breakdown in the attorney-client relationship and the low risk of prejudice to Defendant,
the Court finds that these circumstances warrant withdrawal.
 
            Accordingly,
Attorney Michael J. Danner’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel is GRANTED. 
 
            The Court
sets a Status Conference Re: Retention of Substitute Counsel by Defendant
Alvarado, LLC for July 18, 2024 to coincide with the Case Management Conference
scheduled for that date. 
 
            This ruling
is conditioned on Moving Counsel giving notice to all parties of the ruling and
filing proof of service of that notice with the Court. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
