And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has made a tentative ruling in this case. The plaintiff, Doris Diaz, propounded special interrogatories, a request for production, and requests for admissions on October 19, 2023. The defendant, Simon Park, served unverified responses on December 22, 2023. The plaintiff moved to compel responses, deem the requests for admissions as admitted, and requested sanctions. The court finds that the motion is moot as verified responses have now been provided. The court also finds that the defendant's objections were not waived because it responded within the time provided by the extension. The court grants the defendant's request for sanctions in connection with the motion to deem the truth of the matters in the requests for admissions as admitted, but reduces the amount to $560. The defendant is ordered to pay the sanctions within 20 days of this order.
