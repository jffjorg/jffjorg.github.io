```

And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's untimely motion to set aside the dismissal. The plaintiff's attorney made a mistake, inadvertence, or neglect in filing the motion well past the six-month time limit. The court notes that the terminating sanction dismissing the defendant was entered on June 13, 2023, and the plaintiff does not seek to reinstate the complaint that was dismissed on September 6, 2023. Therefore, the motion is not timely filed under CCP section 473. The court has no authority to excuse the plaintiff's noncompliance with the six-month time limit.
