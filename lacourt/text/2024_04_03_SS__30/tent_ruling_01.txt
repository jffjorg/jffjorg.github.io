  Case Number:  20STCV26672    Hearing Date:   April 3, 2024    Dept:  30 JOSE LUIS TENCHIL, et al. vs ZACHARY SCOTTTENTATIVEPlaintiff’s Untimely Motion to Set Aside the Dismissal is DENIED. Clerk to give notice.Legal StandardCode of Civil Procedure § 473(b) provides for mandatory and discretionary relief from dismissal. The discretionary relief prong states: “The court may, upon any terms as may be just, relieve a party or his or her legal representative from a … dismissal… taken against him or her through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. Application for this relief … shall be made within a reasonable time, in no case exceeding six months, after the … dismissal … was taken.” (CCP section 473(b).) The mandatory prong states: “The court shall, whenever an application for relief is made no more than six months after entry of judgment, is in proper form, and is accompanied by an attorney's sworn affidavit attesting to his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect, vacate any … resulting … dismissal entered against his or her client….” (Id.)DiscussionPlaintiff moves to set aside the dismissal under CCP section 473(b) due to attorney mistake, inadvertence, or neglect. Plaintiff argues that a judgment of dismissal that implements a terminating sanction is a “dismissal entered” for purposes of section 473(b).On June 13, 2023, Defendant Scott’s motions for terminating sanctions dismissing the complaint against both Plaintiffs was granted.On September 6, 2023, the Court dismissed the entire action without prejudice when no party appeared for Jury Trial.The Court notes that Plaintiff argues the terminating sanction was entered on September 6, 2023. However, the terminating sanction dismissing Defendant Scott, the only defendant in this matter, was entered on June 13, 2023. Plaintiff does not seek to reinstate the complaint that was dismissed on September 6, 2023. Therefore, the motion to reinstate the case against Scott is not timely filed under CCP section 473. This Motion to Set Aside the Dismissal was filed on March 1, 2024, well past six months after the Court granted Defendant’s motion for terminating sanctions on June 13, 2023. The Court does not have authority under CCP section 473(b) to excuse Plaintiff’s noncompliance with the six-month time limit. (See Arambula v. Union Carbide Corp. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 333, 345.)Accordingly, Plaintiff’s untimely Motion to Set Aside the Dismissal is DENIED.
