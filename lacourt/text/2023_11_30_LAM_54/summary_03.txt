```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to compel the plaintiff to file a satisfaction of judgment. The defendant had argued that it had satisfied the judgment in full by paying the principal and prejudgment interest, but the plaintiff argued that the defendant had not satisfied the judgment in full because it had not paid the accrued post-judgment interest. The agreement executed by the parties on December 7, 2022, does not relieve the defendant of the obligation to pay post-judgment interest, and the court finds that the defendant must pay any post-judgment interest that accrued up to December 7, 2022. The court also finds that the defendant's motion is denied because the plaintiff has retained the right to seek additional costs and fees.
