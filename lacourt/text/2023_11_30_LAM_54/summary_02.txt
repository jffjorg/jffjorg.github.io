And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the petition brought by Uber Technologies, Inc. (Petitioner) to compel arbitration of Eric Ruiz's (Respondent) wage and hour claims brought before the Division of Labor Standards Enforcement (DLSE). The Petitioner seeks to compel arbitration based on the arbitration provision in the Platform Access Agreement executed by Respondent Ruiz on January 6, 2020. The agreement requires arbitration of any legal dispute arising out of or related to the relationship between Uber and Respondent Ruiz or its affiliates. The judge finds that the Petitioner has met its burden to establish an agreement to arbitrate and that Respondent Ruiz has failed to oppose this motion to show any defenses to enforcement. As a result, the judge grants the petition and stays the DLSE proceedings pending arbitration.
