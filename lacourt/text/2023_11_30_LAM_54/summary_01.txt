And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Mehrdad Vosoghi, M.D., has moved for summary judgment in a medical malpractice case alleging wrongful death due to a failure to diagnose and treat a gastrointestinal bleed. The plaintiff, Jose Rivera, et al., has failed to oppose the motion. The defendant has provided the declaration of expert Rudolph Bedford, M.D., who declares that Vosoghi's treatment of the decedent did not fall below the standard of care. The court finds that this is sufficient to meet the defendant's burden on summary judgment, and the burden shifts to the plaintiff to provide conflicting expert evidence. As the plaintiff has failed to do so, the defendant's motion for summary judgment is granted.
