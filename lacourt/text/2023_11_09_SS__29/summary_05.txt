And here is a summary in English text of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to compel the deposition of the plaintiff, Daniela Cohen, without prejudice. The defendant had repeatedly noticed the plaintiff's deposition, but the plaintiff had objected each time and failed to appear. The judge finds that the defendant did not comply with the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.450, which requires a motion to compel to be accompanied by a declaration stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire about the nonappearance. The judge also finds that the defendant's conduct was substantially justified and that it would be unjust to impose sanctions against the defendant when it is the plaintiff who has not appeared for deposition despite repeated notices. The judge has also denied both parties' requests for sanctions.
