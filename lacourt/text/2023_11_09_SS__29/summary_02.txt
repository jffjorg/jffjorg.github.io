And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to substitute successors in interest to the deceased plaintiff, Elora Bridges. The motion was filed on October 2, 2023, and no opposition has been filed. The Judge has found that the applications submitted by the successors in interest do not comply with the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure § 377.32, specifically that they fail to state that no proceeding is pending in California for the administration of the decedent's estate and that no other person has a superior right to commence the action or proceeding. As a result, the motion is continued to give the moving parties the opportunity to cure these defects and to submit declarations that comply with all substantive and procedural requirements. The hearing on the motion will be continued.
