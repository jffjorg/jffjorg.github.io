And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in two motions filed by Environmental Remediation Contractors, Inc. (the "defendant"): a motion for leave to file a cross-complaint against Sunset Junior, LLC (the "plaintiff"), Ryda Ventures, LLC, and Pietro Rovelli, and a motion for leave to amend its answer.

The defendant is seeking to file a cross-complaint against the plaintiff and others for equitable indemnity, contribution, declaratory relief, express indemnity, breach of contract, negligence, fraud, and fraud in the inducement, negligent misrepresentation, unfair business practices, unjust enrichment, and civil conspiracy, arising from the same incident as the underlying lawsuit.

The defendant is also seeking to amend its answer to add affirmative defenses considering recent developments, including a claim made by the plaintiff with its insurer and a lawsuit filed over the damages arising from the same incident.

The judge has granted both motions, finding that the proposed cross-complaint and complaint arise from the same incident and should be litigated together, and that there is no evidence of dilatory behavior or apparent prejudice to any party from the filing of the cross-complaint or the amendment to the answer.
