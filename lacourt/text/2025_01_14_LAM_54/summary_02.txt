```

And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Court has denied Defendant Pil Soo Lee's motion to set aside the entry of default. Defendant Lee claims he was never served the summons and complaint and that the description of the party served does not match his physical description. He also argues that Plaintiffs Lucia Lovos and Jose Ernesto Hernandez Huezo may have checked the mail before he would see anything. However, the Court finds that Defendant Lee has failed to show a lack of actual notice in time to defend the lawsuit and that he did not file and serve a copy of his proposed Answer or other responsive pleading with the motion as required by statute. The Court also notes that Defendant Lee's driver's license indicates that the property where service was effectuated is his residence, and he does not dispute that he resides at that property. Therefore, the Court has denied Defendant Lee's motion to set aside the entry of default.
