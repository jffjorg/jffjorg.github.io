BACKGROUND
 
Plaintiff
Sunset Junior, LLC filed this action against defendant Environmental
Remediation Contractors, Inc. for damages arising from roof work defendant did
on its property. 
 
Environmental
Remediation Contractors, Inc. filed its Answer to Plaintiff’s complaint on June
10, 2024.   
 
Environmental
Remediation Contractors, Inc. now seeks leave to file a cross-complaint against
Plaintiff; Ryda Ventures, LLC; and Pietro Rovelli and ROES 1 through 50 for
equitable indemnity, contribution, declaratory relief, express indemnity, breach
of contract, negligence, fraud and fraud in the inducement, negligent
misrepresentation, unfair business practices, unjust enrichment, and civil
conspiracy. 
 
As
of January 10, 2025, no opposition has been filed.  
 
 
ANALYSIS
 
A cross-complaint against any of the
parties who filed the initial complaint or cross-complaint against the
cross-complainant must be filed before or at the same time as the answer to the
initial complaint or cross-complaint, which answer must be filed within 30 days
of service of the complaint or cross-complaint. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 412.20,
subd. (a)(3), 428.50(a), 432.10.)  Any other cross-complaint may be filed
at any time before the court has set a trial date. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§428.50, subd. (b).) 
  
If a party fails to file a
cross-complaint within the time limits described above, he or she must obtain
permission from the court to file the cross-complaint. (Code Civ. Proc., §§
426.50, 428.50(c).)  Leave to file a mandatory cross-complaint must be
granted absent bad faith. (Silver Organizations, Ltd. v. Frank
(1990) 217 Cal.App.3d 94, 99.) Leave to file a permissive cross-complaint need
only be granted in the interest of justice. (Code Civ. Proc., §428.50(c).)
 
Ryda Ventures, LLC and Pietro Rovelli
are parties Defendant says it contracted with to provide asbestos remediation
to property of Plaintiff’s that is the subject of this lawsuit. According to Defendant,
Rovelli is Ryda Ventures, LLC’s principal. Defendant asserts that it later
discovered a unity of ownership between Plaintiff and Ryda Ventures, LLC.
Defendant states that it tendered the defense of this matter to Ryda Ventures,
LLC and Pietro Rovelli, but neither accepted the tender. 
 
The proposed cross-complaint and
complaint arise from the same incident and should be litigated together. There
is no evidence Environmental Remediation Contractors, Inc. has been dilatory in seeking to file
the cross-complaint, nor is there any apparent prejudice to any party from the
filing of the cross-complaint. No party opposes the motion. 
 
The Court grants the motion.

ANALYSIS
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 473,
subd. (a)(1) provides, in relevant part:  “The court may, in furtherance
of justice, and on any terms as may be proper, allow a party to amend any
pleading or proceeding by adding or striking out the name of any party, or by
correcting a mistake in the name of a party, or a mistake in any other respect;
and may, upon like terms, enlarge the time for answer or demurrer.  The
court may likewise, in its discretion, after notice to the adverse party,
allow, upon any terms as may be just, an amendment to any pleading or
proceeding in other particulars; and may upon like terms allow an answer to be
made after the time limited by this code.” “This discretion should be exercised
liberally in favor of amendments, for judicial policy favors resolution of all
disputed matters in the same lawsuit.”  (Kittredge Sports Co. v. Super.
Ct. (1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 1045, 1047.)   
 
Ryda Ventures, LLC and Pietro Rovelli
are parties defendant says it contracted with to provide asbestos remediation
to the property of Plaintiff’s that is the subject of this lawsuit. According
to Defendant, Rovelli is Ryda Ventures, LLC’s principal. Defendant asserts that
it later discovered a unity of ownership between Plaintiff and Ryda Ventures,
LLC. Defendant also asserts that Plaintiff made a claim with its insurer and
filed a lawsuit over the damages arising from the same incident. Defendant
states that it tendered the defense of this matter to Ryda Ventures, LLC and
Pietro Rovelli, but neither accepted the tender. Defendant states that it needs
to add affirmative defenses considering these findings and developments. 
 
There is no evidence Environmental
Remediation Contractors, Inc.
has been dilatory in seeking to file the answer, nor is there any apparent
prejudice to any party from amending the answer. No parties oppose the motion.  
 
The Court grants the motion.
