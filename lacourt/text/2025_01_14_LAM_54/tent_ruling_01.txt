BACKGROUND
 
 Plaintiff Rodolfo Garcia-Rosas was diagnosed
with silicosis in March 2022.  Plaintiff
alleges he developed silicosis after being exposed to Defendants’ stone
products during his employment cutting, fabricating, and installing artificial
stone and natural stone countertops, mostly in home kitchens and
bathrooms.  Plaintiff was exposed to
these products from about 2000 to 2022. 
Plaintiff alleges Defendants knew of the toxicity of their products but
fraudulently concealed them.  
 
The
operative complaint is the First Amended Complaint filed on March 13,
2023.  The FAC alleges (1) negligence;
(2) strict liability—warning defect; (3) strict liability—design defect; (4)
fraudulent concealment; (5) breach of implied warranties; and (6) loss of
consortium.
 
ANALYSIS
 
Evidentiary
Objections
 
            Defendant’s Objections to
Plaintiff’s Separate Statement and Defendant’s Objections to Declarations of Barrow
and Metzger—The Court declines to rule on these Objections because, they are
immaterial to the Court’s ruling per CCP §437c(q).  The Court finds Defendant fails to satisfy
its initial burden on summary judgment.  
 
Legal
Standard
 
            A
motion for summary judgment or adjudication provides “courts with a mechanism
to cut through the parties’ pleadings in order to determine whether, despite
their allegations, trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute.”  (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co.
(2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.)  It must be
granted “if all the evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably
deducible from the evidence’ and uncontradicted by other inferences or
evidence, show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that
the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”¿ (Adler v.
Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119 [quoting Code Civ.
Proc., § 437c, subd. (c)].)  
 
            Where
a defendant seeks summary judgment or adjudication, he must show that either
“one or more elements of the cause of action, even if not separately pleaded,
cannot be established, or that there is a complete defense to that cause of
action.”  (Code of Civ. Pros., section
437c, subd. (o)(2).)  A defendant may
satisfy this burden by showing that the claim “cannot be established” because
of the lack of evidence on some essential element of the claim.  (Union Bank v. Superior Court (1995)
31 Cal.App.4th 574, 590.)  Once the
defendant meets this burden, the burden shifts to plaintiff to show that a
“triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to that cause of action
or defense thereto.”  (Id.)  
 
            “A
party is entitled to summary judgment only if it meets its initial burden of
showing there are no triable issues of fact and the moving party is entitled to
judgment as a matter of law. This is true even if the opposing party fails to
file any opposition.  The court's
assessment of whether the moving party has carried its burden—and therefore
caused a shift—occurs before the court's evaluation of the opposing party's
papers.  Therefore, the burden on the
motion does not initially shift as a result of what is, or is not, contained in
the opposing papers.”  (Mosley v.
Pacific Specialty Insurance Company (2020) 49 Cal.App.5th 417, 434–435
[landlord’s failure to address issue of whether they were aware of their tenant’s
marijuana growing operation was not grounds to grant summary judgment where
moving party failed to satisfy its initial burden as to the issue]; Thatcher
v. Lucky Stores, Inc. (2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 1081, 1086-1087 [court cannot
grant summary judgment based merely on lack of opposition; court must first
determine if the moving party has satisfied its burden].) 
 
            In
addition, the evidence and affidavits of the moving party are construed
strictly, while those of the opponent are liberally read.  (Government Employees Ins. Co. v. Sup. Ct.
(2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 95, 100.)  “All
doubts as to the propriety of granting the motion (whether there is any issue
of material fact [Code of Civil Procedure] § 437c) are to be resolved in favor
of the party opposing the motion (i.e., a denial of summary judgment).”  (Hamburg v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.
(2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 497, 502.)
 
Defendant’s Motion for Summary
Judgment, or Summary Adjudication
 
            Sophisticated
User Defense
 
            “The
sophisticated user defense exempts manufacturers from their typical obligation
to provide product users with warnings about the products' potential hazards.
The defense is considered an exception to the manufacturer's general duty to
warn consumers, and therefore, in most jurisdictions, if successfully argued,
acts as an affirmative defense to negate the manufacturer's duty to warn. Under
the sophisticated user defense, sophisticated users need not be warned about
dangers of which they are already aware or should be aware. Because these
sophisticated users are charged with knowing the particular product's dangers,
the failure to warn about those dangers is not the legal cause of any harm that
product may cause.”  (Johnson v.
American Standard, Inc. (“Johnson”) (2008) 43 Cal.4th 56, 65; see
also 6 Witkin, Summary (11th ed. 2020), Torts §1321.)   
 
            “A
manufacturer is not liable to a sophisticated user of its product for failure
to warn of a risk, harm, or danger, if the sophisticated user knew or should
have known of that risk, harm, or danger. It would be nearly impossible for a
manufacturer to predict or determine whether a given user or member of the
sophisticated group actually has knowledge of the dangers because of the
infinite number of user idiosyncrasies. For example, given users may have
misread their training manuals, failed to study the information in those
manuals, or simply forgotten what they were taught. However, individuals who
represent that they are trained or are members of a sophisticated group of
users are saying to the world that they possess the level of knowledge and
skill associated with that class. If they do not actually possess that
knowledge and skill, that fact should not give rise to liability on the part of
the manufacturer.”  (Id. at 71.)
 
            “Thus,
in order to establish the defense, the defendant must identify the relevant
risk, show that sophisticated users are already aware of the risk, and
demonstrate that the plaintiff is a member of the group of sophisticated
users.”  (Buckner v. Milwaukee
Electric Tool Corp. (2013) 222 Cal.App.4th 522, 535.)  “In the context of the sophisticated user
defense, because the intended users are deemed to know of the risks,
manufacturers have no obligation to warn, and providing no warning is
appropriate. The focus of the defense, therefore, is whether the danger in
question was so generally known within the trade or profession that a
manufacturer should not have been expected to provide a warning specific to the
group to which plaintiff belonged.”  (Id.
at 534.)
 
            The
sophisticated user defense is applicable to both negligence and strict
liability causes of action based on failure to warn.  (Id. at 71.)  The sophisticated user defense does not apply
to strict liability or negligence claims based on a design defect risk-benefit theory.  (Johnson v. Honeywell Int. (“Honeywell”)
(2009) 179 Cal.App.4th 549, 558 (sophisticated user defense did not bar
HVAC technician's strict products liability claim against refrigerant
manufacturers, where claim was based on design defect risk-benefit theory,
rather than failure to warn; there is no logical reason why defense based on
need for warning should apply in design defect case).)  However, where a design defect claim is based
on the consumer expectations test, which is based on the expectations of the
ordinary consumer, the sophisticated user defense applies.  (Id. at 558, fn 4.)
 
            “A
user's sophistication is determined at the time of his or her injury.  The timeline focuses on the general
population of sophisticated users and conforms to the defense's purpose to
eliminate any duty to warn when the expected user population is generally aware
of the risk at issue.”  (Moran v.
Foster Wheeler Energy Corp. (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 500, 511–512.)  Thus, to establish the sophisticated user
defense, defendant must present admissible evidence establishing that the
general population of sophisticated users knew or should have known of the
particular risk or danger suffered by the plaintiff from the time of
plaintiff’s first exposure onward.  (Id.
at 518; Scott v. Ford Motor Co. (2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 1492, 1500-1501.)

 
             Defendant fails to satisfy its burden based on
the sophisticated user defense. 
Defendant’s submits evidence that the 2006
Material Safety Data Sheet (“MSDS”) of Silestone and the 2013 MSDS of Dekton
contained warnings to wear protective respiratory gear, because inhalation of
the particles could lead to development of serious health problems.  (Defendant’s SSUMF Nos. 5-15.)  These two documents contain specific warnings
that long term exposure to the dust from the cutting and manufacturing process could
cause serious diseases—the 2006 MSDS for Silestone (UMF Nos. 7, 9, 10) and the
2013 MSDS for Dekton (UMF No. 14.)  The
documents were attached to Plaintiff’s FAC. 

 
            These
MSDSs from 2006 and 2013 do not alone establish that the sophisticated users
were “generally aware of the risk at issue” or that this risk was “so generally
known within the trade or profession that a manufacturer should not have been
expected to provide a warning specific to the group to which plaintiff belonged.”  (Johnson, supra, 43 Cal.4th
at 73; Buckner, supra, 222 Cal.App.4th at 534.)  The documents cover two specific years and do
not establish widespread knowledge of the identified risk for the full period
of Plaintiff’s exposure, which was from 2000 through 2022.  (Scott v. Ford Motor Co. (2014) 224
Cal.App.4th 1492, 1500 (jury rejection of sophisticated user defense
supported by substantial evidence that defendant failed to prove that claimed
class of sophisticated users were or should have been aware of risks associated
with professional asbestos exposure “throughout the period” of plaintiff’s
exposure).)    
 
            Defendant’s
evidence also fails to establish that Plaintiff was a sophisticated user of the
products.  As explained in Johnson,
the sophisticated user doctrine was intended to apply to “members of a
sophisticated group of users are saying to the world that they possess the
level of knowledge and skill associated with that class.”  (Johnson, supra, 43 Cal.4th at
65 (highly trained and certified HVAC technician was sophisticated user of refrigerant
that injured him.)  “The sophisticated
user defense has been applied where the end user of a product can be expected
to know about potential risks due to the user’s extensive training or
professional experience.”  (Webb
v. Special Electric Co., Inc. (2016) 63 Cal.4th 167, 182-183.)  Sophisticated user status can be inferred
from the plaintiff’s occupation of a position that required knowledge of
certain regulations governing use of the product or from the plaintiff’s admission
of knowledge that would make the plaintiff a sophisticated user.  (Watts v. Pneumo Abex, LLC (2024) 106
Cal.App.5th 248, 261 (substantial evidence supported jury finding
that plaintiff was a sophisticated user where he was owner of auto repair shop since
1983, ownership required him to know applicable regulations governing brake
repair, including asbestos exposure, and plaintiff admitted he never referred
to manuals because he was sufficiently proficient and knew how to
professionally and safely perform brake jobs).)
            
            There
is no claim that Plaintiff was formally educated or certified as a stone cutter
or fabricator.  Defendant’s evidence of
Plaintiff’s “sophistication” is (1) a list of shops that he worked at in some
capacity from 2000 to 2022; (2) Plaintiff’s testimony that he initially learned
countertop fabrication from Mr. Morales; and (3) Plaintiff’s testimony that he
received “weeks of training” from Morales and was instructed to wear protective
equipment.  (Defendant’s SSUMF Nos.
16-18.)  In response to a question
regarding how many hours of training “in how to fabricate a slab,” Plaintiff
stated he had no idea, that Morales would just say, “Come and learn,” and that
was how he learned to “fabricate.”  (Defendant’s
Ex. H, 465:4-15.)  
 
            This
evidence does not establish as a matter of law that Plaintiff was a
“sophisticated user” as defined by Johnson and its progeny.  “Weeks of training” is not analogous to
formal education and certification, nor would what Plaintiff described as his
training give rise to an inference that he was a sophisticated user who knew or
should have known of the danger of silicosis from product exposure.  
 
            Defendant’s
Motion for Summary Judgment, or in the alternative, Summary Adjudication based
on the Sophisticated User Defense is DENIED.
 
            Lack
of Causation
 
            Causation
is ultimately a question of fact. (Butler v. Bell Helicopter Textron, Inc.
(2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 1073, 1088.) 
“There is no requirement that a manufacturer must give a warning which
could not possibly be effective in lessening the plaintiff’s risk of
harm.”  (Rosburg v. Minnesota Mining
& Mfg. Co. (1986) 181 Cal.App.3d 726, 735.)  Where a plaintiff alleges products liability
on grounds of inadequate warnings, there can be no proximate cause where the
plaintiff did not read or rely on the allegedly inadequate warnings.  (Conte v. Wyeth (2008) 168 Cal.App.4th
89, 112.)   
 
            Defendant
moves for summary judgment based on causation. 
Defendant argues any failure to warn was not a substantial factor in
causing Plaintiff’s injuries, because Plaintiff confirmed that he neither read
nor relied upon the warnings and instructions related to Defendant’s stone
countertop products.  Defendant argues
Plaintiff also admits that he could not read English and therefore would not
have been able to read any warnings.  
 
             Defendant fails to establish as a matter of
law that its failure to warn was not a substantial factor in causing
Plaintiff’s injury.  Plaintiff did not
testify that he received warnings, that they were inadequate and that he did
not review or rely on the inadequate warnings. 
Plaintiff testified that he never saw an MSDS, nor did he know what an
MSDS was.  Plaintiff testified that he
removed the bags the slabs came in; when asked if he ever opened the plastic
bag, he testified he did not, he only removed the plastic and even if he
checked inside, he did not know English, so he could not tell what was
inside.  (Defendant’s Evidence, Ex. F,
273:9-21.)  Plaintiff testified that he removed
labels and stickers, but there is no evidence that those stickers and labels
were relevant warnings.  (Id., Ex.
H, 415:1-416:19.)  Plaintiff is claiming lack
of any warnings, not inadequacy of warnings that were provided and which he
knowingly disregarded.  
 
            Defendant’s Motion for Summary
Judgment, or in the Alternative Summary Adjudication based on lack of causation
is DENIED.  
            
            Sophisticated
Intermediary Doctrine
 
            Under
the sophisticated intermediary doctrine, “a supplier may discharge its duty to
warn end users about known or knowable risks in the use of its product if it:
(1) provides adequate warnings to the product's immediate purchaser, or sells
to a sophisticated purchaser that it knows is aware or should be aware of the
specific danger, and (2) reasonably relies on the purchaser to convey
appropriate warnings to downstream users who will encounter the product.
Because the sophisticated intermediary doctrine is an affirmative defense, the
supplier bears the burden of proving that it adequately warned the
intermediary, or knew the intermediary was aware or should have been aware of
the specific hazard, and reasonably relied on the intermediary to transmit
warnings.”  (Webb v. Special Electric
Co., Inc. (2016) 63 Cal.4th 167, 187.) 

 
            “Like
the sophisticated user defense, the sophisticated intermediary defense applies
to failure to warn claims sounding in either strict liability or
negligence.  As we have previously
observed, there is little functional difference between the two theories in the
failure to warn context.  In failure to
warn cases, whether asserted on negligence or strict liability grounds, there
is but one unitary theory of liability which is negligence based—the duty to
use reasonable care in promulgating a warning.” 
(Id.)  
 
            “[T]he
sophisticated intermediary doctrine provides that a supplier can discharge its
duty to warn if it provides adequate warnings, or sells to a sufficiently sophisticated
buyer, and reasonably relies on the buyer to warn end users about the harm.
Reasonable reliance depends on all attendant circumstances and is typically a
question of fact for the jury.”  (Webb,
supra, 63 Cal.4th 167, 180; see also 6 Witkin, Summary (11th
ed. 2024), Torts § 1322.) 
 
            Defendant
fails to establish that Plaintiff’s claims are barred by the sophisticated
intermediary defense.  Defendant’s only
facts relevant here are (1) a list of shops where Plaintiff worked during the
relevant period (UMF No. 5) and (2) the 2006 and 2013 MSDSs for Silestone (UMF
Nos. 7, 9, 10) and the 2013 MSDS for Dekton (UMF No. 14.).  As discussed with the sophisticated user
defense, the MSDSs do not establish that adequate warnings were provided to
each of the shops where Plaintiff worked for the entire period of his exposure.
And Defendant provides no facts or evidence from which a trier of fact could
find that it was reasonable for Defendant to rely on those shops to convey the
warnings to end users like Plaintiff.  
            
            Defendant’s
Motion for Summary Judgment, or in the Alternative, Summary Adjudication based
on the Sophisticated Intermediary Doctrine is DENIED.  
 
            Hazard
Communications Standard (29 C.F.R. § 1910.1200)
 
            Under 29 Code of Federal Regulations
§1910.1200(a)(2), the standard set forth therein is “intended to address
comprehensively the issue of classifying the potential hazards of chemicals,
and communicating information concerning hazards and appropriate protective
measures to employees, and to preempt any legislative or regulatory enactments
of a state, or political subdivision of a state, pertaining to this subject.”  (29 C.F.R. §1910.1200(a)(2).)  “This section requires chemical manufacturers
or importers to classify the hazards of chemicals which they produce or import,
and all employers to provide information to their employees about the hazardous
chemicals to which they are exposed, by means of a hazard communication
program, labels and other forms of warning, safety data sheets, and information
and training. In addition, this section requires distributors to transmit the
required information to employers.”  (29
C.F.R. §1910.1200(b)(1).)  
 
            However,
nothing in Title 29, Chapter 15 of the United States Annotated Code (“Occupational
Safety and Health”) “shall be construed to superseded or in any manner affect
any  workmen's compensation law or to
enlarge or diminish or affect in any other manner the common law or statutory
rights, duties, or liabilities of employers and employees under any law with
respect to injuries, diseases, or death of employees arising out of, or in the
course of, employment.”  (29 U.S.C.A.
§653(4).)  
 
            Defendant
argues that 29 C.F.R. §1910.1200 bars Plaintiff’s claims, because it makes employers
responsible for protecting their workforce from occupational exposures to
respirable chemicals.  Defendant argues Plaintiff’s
employers never provided him with any information, documents, or warnings
issued by the stone countertop manufacturers and they are therefore liable for
Plaintiff’s injuries.
 
            Defendant’s
argument and evidence, at best, establish Plaintiff’s employer’s statutory duty
under the Hazard Communications Standard to provide warnings and protection
against the dangers of exposure to the products in question.  They do not bar Plaintiff’s claims against
Defendant.  Defendant cites no authority
holding that the Hazard Communications Standard makes employers solely
responsible or liable for employee injuries due to chemical exposure.
 
            Defendant’s
Motion for Summary Judgment, or Summary Adjudication, based on the Hazard
Communications Standard is DENIED.  
 
            Fraudulent
Concealment 
 
            Defendant argues that Plaintiff’s
fraudulent concealment claim fails because Defendant did not owe Plaintiff a
duty of disclosure.  Citing Bigler-Engler
v. Breg, Inc. (2017) 7 Cal.App.5th 276, 310-311 and LiMandri
v. Judkins (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 326, 336-337, Defendant argues it
was not in a fiduciary relationship with Plaintiff nor did they have a transactional
relationship involving “direct dealings,” such as “seller and buyer, employer
and prospective employee, doctor and patient, or contractual arrangement.” 
 
            The
Court disagrees that fraudulent concealment is barred as a matter of law on
this ground.  In Jones v.
ConocoPhillips Co. (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 1187, plaintiffs alleged a duty
of disclosure based on (1) defendant Dow’s awareness of the toxic nature of
their products, (2) Dow’s sole knowledge of that fact; and (3) decedent who
worked with the product did not have that knowledge available to him.  (Jones, supra, 198 Cal.App.4th at
1199.)  The decedent in Jones,
like Plaintiff, was an employee of employers who purchased and used chemicals
from various manufacturers, and suffered various health issues as a result of
exposure to those chemicals.  (Id.
at 1198.)  “Although, typically, a duty
to disclose arises when a defendant owes a fiduciary duty to a plaintiff, a
duty to disclose may also arise when a defendant possesses or exerts control
over material facts not readily available to the plaintiff.”  (Id.)
 
            The
analysis in Jones was based on LiMandri, which stated that,
outside of a fiduciary relationship, a duty to disclose can arise in three
other circumstances:  when the defendant
had exclusive knowledge of material facts not known to the plaintiff; (3) when the
defendant actively conceals a material fact from the plaintiff; and (4) when
the defendant makes partial representations but also suppresses some material
facts.  (LiMandri, supra,
52 Cal.App.4th at 336-337.)  “These three
circumstances, however, presuppose the existence of some other relationship
between the plaintiff and defendant in which a duty to disclose can
arise.”  (Id.)  Because Jones relied explicitly on
this discussion in LiMandri, Jones is reasonably interpreted to
imply that “some other relationship,” such as a transactional relationship,
exists between an employee who uses a hazardous chemical purchased by his or
her employer and the manufacturer or distributor from whom the employer
purchased that product.  (LiMandri,
supra, 52 Cal.App.4th at 337.)
 
            Such
an interpretation is supported by Peterson v. Lamb Rubber Co. (1960) 54
Cal.2d 339, 347.  Peterson held
that an employee is in contractual privity with a manufacturer for purposes of
a breach of implied warranty claim: 
“[I]t is a matter of common knowledge, and of course known to
vendor-manufacturers, that most businesses are carried on by means of the
assistance of employees and that equipment or supplies purchased by employers
will in actual use be handled by the employes, who in this respect may be said
to stand in the shoes of the employer.”  (Peterson,
supra, 54 Cal.2d at 347.)  By this
reasoning, an employee of a company that purchases a toxic chemical for use in
the employer’s business is in a “transactional relationship” with the
manufacturer of that chemical and a duty to disclose exists.  
 
            Bigler-Engler
does not change this analysis.  Bigler-Engler
merely reiterated LiMandri’s statement that “some other
relationship” must exist to find a duty of disclosure where there is no
fiduciary relationship.  Bilger-Engler
held that such a relationship must be the result of some transaction.  (Bigler-Engler, supra, 7 Cal.App.5th
at 312.)  “Such a transaction must
necessarily arise from direct dealings between the plaintiff and the defendant;
it cannot arise between the defendant and the public at large.”  Id. 
The Court reversed a jury verdict on the plaintiff’s intentional
concealment claim on grounds that the record did not support a finding of a
duty of disclosure.  (Id. at 315.)
 
            Bigler-Engler
is also factually distinguishable.  The
plaintiff in Bigler-Engler was a patient who was injured by a medical
device prescribed by her physician.  The
plaintiff also sued the manufacturer of the medical device on several theories,
including fraudulent concealment.  The
Court found that there were no “direct dealings” between plaintiff and the
manufacturer to support a duty of disclosure. 
Plaintiff is suing the manufacturers who sold stone product to his
employers or hirers. Plaintiff came in contact with product as an employee or
hired contractor of his employers or hirers, who purportedly had direct
dealings with the manufacturers.  Plaintiff
came into contact with the chemicals as an agent of his employers.  Plaintiff was not a “member of the public at
large.”  Bigler-Engler did not
examine whether the specific relationship at issue here satisfies the “some
other relationship” or “direct dealing” (manufacturer/seller to employer/buyer
to employee/agent) requirement to impose a duty of disclosure on a defendant
who is not a fiduciary.  Jones did
examine this exact type of relationship and found it gave rise to a duty of
disclosure sufficient to support a fraudulent concealment cause of action.  
            
            Defendant’s
Motion for Summary Adjudication of the fraudulent concealment cause of action
is DENIED.  
 
            Breach
of Implied Warranty
 
            Defendant moves for summary
adjudication of the breach of implied warranty cause of action on grounds of
lack of privity.  Defendant argues there
is no evidence to support contractual privity or any direct dealings between
Plaintiff and Defendant.  As discussed in
connection with the fraudulent concealment claim, Plaintiff satisfies the
contractual privity requirement under Peterson.  
 
            Defendant’s
Motion for Summary Adjudication of the breach of implied warranty cause of
action is DENIED.  
 
            Loss
of Consortium
 
            Defendant moves for summary
adjudication of Plaintiff Alma Delia Llamas’s loss of consortium claim on
grounds that the underlying causes of action by Plaintiff Garcia-Rosas are
barred.  As discussed above, Defendant
fails to establish that those claims are barred.  Defendant’s Motion for Summary Adjudication
of the Loss of Consortium cause of action is DENIED.  
 
            Punitive
Damages
 
            “In
the usual case, the question of whether the defendant's conduct will support an
award of punitive damages is for the trier of fact, since the degree of
punishment depends on the peculiar circumstances of each case.  But the issue may be resolved on summary
judgment, giving due regard to the higher proof standard. While the clear and
convincing evidentiary standard is a stringent one, it does not impose on a
plaintiff the obligation to prove a case for punitive damages at summary
judgment.  However, where the plaintiff's
ultimate burden of proof will be by clear and convincing evidence, the higher
standard of proof must be taken into account in ruling on a motion for summary
judgment or summary adjudication, since if a plaintiff is to prevail on a claim
for punitive damages, it will be necessary that the evidence presented meet the
higher evidentiary standard.  Summary
judgment on the issue of punitive damages is proper only when no reasonable
jury could find the plaintiff's evidence to be clear and convincing proof of
malice, fraud or oppression.”  (Johnson
& Johnson v. Superior Court (2011) 192 Cal.App.4th 757, 762; Pacific
Gas and Electric Company v. Superior Court (2018) 24 Cal.App.5th 1150,
1158–1159.)
 
            As
the party moving for adjudication of Plaintiff’s punitive damages claim,
Defendant bears the initial burden of production on Plaintiff’s punitive
damages claim.  (CCP §437c(f)(1) and (2);
Johnson & Johnson v. Supr. Ct. (2011) 192 Cal.App.4th 757, 761.)  A defendant may satisfy its initial burden on
summary judgment by showing that the claim “cannot be established” because of
the lack of evidence on some essential element of the claim.  (Union Bank v. Supr. Ct. (1995) 31
Cal.App.4th 574, 590.) Summary judgment still requires, however, the
presentation of evidence in the form of “affidavits, declarations, admissions,
answers to interrogatories, depositions, and matters of which judicial notice”
to demonstrate that plaintiff does not possess and cannot reasonably obtain
necessary evidence to establish his or her claim.  (Id. at 854.)  
 
            For
this reason, a defendant does not meet its burden under CCP §437(c)(o)(1) by
merely “pointing out” or “arguing” that the plaintiff does not possess or
cannot reasonably obtain necessary evidence. (Id.; Lona v. Citibank,
N.A. (2011) 202 Cal.App.4th 89 (defendant bank did not meet its burden on
summary judgment of wrongful foreclosure by merely arguing that plaintiff
lacked evidence to support her claim and only documentary evidence submitted
were the loan documents); Gaggero v. Yura (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 884,
890 (defendant did not establish plaintiff’s lack of evidence or inability to
reasonably obtain evidence of plaintiff’s ability and willingness to perform by
pointing to plaintiff’s refusal to answer certain questions during deposition
on grounds of a meritless privacy objection; such a refusal, regardless of its
merit, was neither an admission nor a factually devoid discovery response).)
 
            Defendant
fails to carry its burden as the party moving for summary adjudication of the
punitive damages claim. Defendant argues Plaintiff cannot establish that it
acted with fraud, malice, or oppression, because Plaintiff “conceded” at his
deposition that he never relied on any representation of any employee of
Defendant, he was not aware of any information that Defendant intended to cause
him harm and he had no information that Defendant acted in conscious disregard
for his safety.  (Defendant’s UMF Nos.
37-39.)  
 
            Plaintiff’s
deposition testimony is not an admission that Defendant did not act with fraud,
malice, or oppression.  Plaintiff alleges
that Defendant fraudulently concealed the hazards of their stone products.  Plaintiff’s testimony does not negate this
allegation, nor is it necessary for Plaintiff to have had direct contact with
an employee or agent of the Defendant to establish fraud, malice, or
oppression.  Defendant also fails to
demonstrate that Plaintiff would not be able to reasonably obtain evidence of
fraud, malice, or oppression.  
 
            Defendant’s
Motion for Summary Adjudication of the punitive damages claim is DENIED.

            The
Court considers the moving papers, opposition, and reply. 
 
If the parties wish to submit on the tentative, please email
the courtroom at¿SMCdept54@lacourt.org¿with notice to opposing counsel (or self-represented party)
before 8:30 am on the day of the hearing. 
 
BACKGROUND
 
 Plaintiff Rodolfo Garcia-Rosas was diagnosed
with silicosis in March 2022.  Plaintiff
alleges he developed silicosis after being exposed to Defendants’ stone
products during his employment cutting, fabricating, and installing artificial
stone and natural stone countertops, mostly in home kitchens and
bathrooms.  Plaintiff was exposed to
these products from about 2000 to 2022. 
Plaintiff alleges Defendants knew of the toxicity of their products but
fraudulently concealed them.  
 
The
operative complaint is the First Amended Complaint filed on March 13,
2023.  The FAC alleges (1) negligence;
(2) strict liability—warning defect; (3) strict liability—design defect; (4)
fraudulent concealment; (5) breach of implied warranties; and (6) loss of
consortium.
 
ANALYSIS
 
Evidentiary
Objections
 
            Defendant’s Objection to Arik
Tendler Deposition—The Court declines to rule on these Objections because, they
are immaterial to the Court’s ruling per CCP §437c(q).  The Court finds Defendant fails to satisfy
its initial burden on summary judgment.  
 
Request
for Judicial Notice
 
            Plaintiff’s Request for
Judicial Notice is GRANTED pursuant to Evidence Code §§451(a) and 452(a), (b)
and (c).  Plaintiff seeks judicial notice
of 29 C.F.R. §1910.1200, 29 C.F.R. §1926.1153, 8 C.C.R. §5194, OSHA Standards
Interpretations, Standard Number 19755.3(d) and Emergency Temporary Standard on
Respirable Crystalline Silica adopted by Cal-OSHA.  
            
Legal
Standard
 
            A
motion for summary judgment or adjudication provides “courts with a mechanism
to cut through the parties’ pleadings in order to determine whether, despite
their allegations, trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute.”  (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co.
(2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.)  It must be
granted “if all the evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably
deducible from the evidence’ and uncontradicted by other inferences or
evidence, show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that
the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”¿ (Adler v.
Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119 [quoting Code Civ.
Proc., § 437c, subd. (c)].)  
 
            Where
a defendant seeks summary judgment or adjudication, he must show that either
“one or more elements of the cause of action, even if not separately pleaded,
cannot be established, or that there is a complete defense to that cause of
action.”  (Code of Civ. Pros., section
437c, subd. (o)(2).)  A defendant may
satisfy this burden by showing that the claim “cannot be established” because
of the lack of evidence on some essential element of the claim.  (Union Bank v. Superior Court (1995)
31 Cal.App.4th 574, 590.)  Once the
defendant meets this burden, the burden shifts to plaintiff to show that a
“triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to that cause of action
or defense thereto.”  (Id.)  
 
            “A
party is entitled to summary judgment only if it meets its initial burden of
showing there are no triable issues of fact and the moving party is entitled to
judgment as a matter of law. This is true even if the opposing party fails to
file any opposition.  The court's
assessment of whether the moving party has carried its burden—and therefore
caused a shift—occurs before the court's evaluation of the opposing party's papers.  Therefore, the burden on the motion does not
initially shift as a result of what is, or is not, contained in the opposing
papers.”  (Mosley v. Pacific Specialty
Insurance Company (2020) 49 Cal.App.5th 417, 434–435 [landlord’s failure to
address issue of whether they were aware of their tenant’s marijuana growing
operation was not grounds to grant summary judgment where moving party failed
to satisfy its initial burden as to the issue]; Thatcher v. Lucky Stores,
Inc. (2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 1081, 1086-1087 [court cannot grant summary
judgment based merely on lack of opposition; court must first determine if the
moving party has satisfied its burden].) 
 
            In
addition, the evidence and affidavits of the moving party are construed
strictly, while those of the opponent are liberally read.  (Government Employees Ins. Co. v. Sup. Ct.
(2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 95, 100.)  “All
doubts as to the propriety of granting the motion (whether there is any issue
of material fact [Code of Civil Procedure] § 437c) are to be resolved in favor
of the party opposing the motion (i.e., a denial of summary judgment).”  (Hamburg v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.
(2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 497, 502.)
 
Defendant’s Motion for Summary
Judgment, or Summary Adjudication
 
            Lack
of Causation
 
            Causation
is ultimately a question of fact. (Butler v. Bell Helicopter Textron, Inc.
(2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 1073, 1088.)  “A
manufacturer, distributor, or retailer is liable in tort if a defect in the
manufacture or design of its product causes injury while the product is being
used in a reasonably foreseeable way.” (Soule v. General Motors Corp.
(1994) 8 Cal.4th 548, 560; CACI 1205(3)(plaintiff alleging strict liability
based on failure to warn must demonstrate that the potential risk to be warned
against presented a substantial danger when the product is used or misused in
an intended or reasonably foreseeable way).) 
Pursuant to CACI 1245, an affirmative defense to a strict liability
claim is the misuse or modification of a product “so highly extraordinary that
it was not reasonably foreseeable to [defendant] and therefore should be
considered as the sole cause of [plaintiff’s] harm.  (CACI 1245.)
 
            Product
misuse is a “defense to strict products liability only when the defendant
proved that an unforeseeable abuse or alteration of the product after it left
the manufacturer’s hands was the sole reason that the product caused an
injury.”  (Campbell v. So. Pacific Co.
(1978) 22 Cal.3d 51, 56.)  “If a misuse
or modification was a substantial factor contributing to, but not the sole
cause of plaintiff’s harm, there is no complete defense, but the conduct of the
plaintiff or third parties may be considered under principles of comparative
negligence.”  (Directions for Use, CACI
1245, para. 1.)  
 
            “Third
party negligence which is the immediate cause of an injury may be viewed as a
superseding cause when it is so highly extraordinary as to be
unforeseeable.  The foreseeability
required is of the risk of harm, not of the particular intervening act…It must
appear that the intervening act has produce harm of a kind and degree so far
beyond the risk the original tortfeasor should have foreseen that the law deems
it unfair to hold him responsible.”  (Soule,
supra, 8 Cal.4th at 573, fn. 9; Torres v. Xomox Corp. (1996) 49 Cal.App.4th
1, 18-19.)  
 
            Modification
of a product can be so substantial and unforeseeable as to constitute a
superseding cause of an injury as a matter of law.  (Torres, supra, 49 Cal.App.4th at 19.)  “However, foreseeability is a question for
the jury unless undisputed facts leave no room for reasonable difference of
opinion.  Thus, the superseding cause is
generally one of fact.”  (Id.)
 
            Defendant
argues that the conduct of Plaintiff’s employer was a superseding, intervening
cause of Plaintiff’s injury.  Defendant
abandons this argument on reply. 
 
            Defendant’s
evidence fails to support a finding of superseding, intervening cause as a
matter of law.  Defendant refers to
Plaintiff’s “employer” and Plaintiff’s discovery responses in support of its
claim of superseding, intervening cause. 
However, nowhere in the evidence does Plaintiff identify any particular employer’s
concealment of Defendant’s MSDS from the Plaintiff.  (Defendant’s SSUMF Nos. 4, 5, 10 and
13.)  Nothing submitted would support a
finding of intentional concealment by an employer.  
 
            The
testimony cited in UMF No. 5 does not support Defendant’s assertion that
Plaintiff’s “employer” “encouraged the use of large brooms as a means of
removing silica dust.” Plaintiff merely stated that brooms were used by all
workers.  (Id.)  
 
            Defendant’s
Motion for Summary Judgment, or in the Alternative Summary Adjudication based
on lack of causation is DENIED.  
 
            Hazard
Communications Standard (29 C.F.R. § 1910.1200)
 
            Under 29 Code of Federal Regulations
§1910.1200(a)(2), the standard set forth therein is “intended to address
comprehensively the issue of classifying the potential hazards of chemicals,
and communicating information concerning hazards and appropriate protective
measures to employees, and to preempt any legislative or regulatory enactments
of a state, or political subdivision of a state, pertaining to this subject.”  (29 C.F.R. §1910.1200(a)(2).)  “This section requires chemical manufacturers
or importers to classify the hazards of chemicals which they produce or import,
and all employers to provide information to their employees about the hazardous
chemicals to which they are exposed, by means of a hazard communication
program, labels and other forms of warning, safety data sheets, and information
and training. In addition, this section requires distributors to transmit the
required information to employers.”  (29
C.F.R. §1910.1200(b)(1).)  
 
            However,
nothing in Title 29, Chapter 15 of the United States Annotated Code
(“Occupational Safety and Health”) “shall be construed to superseded or in any
manner affect any  workmen's compensation
law or to enlarge or diminish or affect in any other manner the common law or
statutory rights, duties, or liabilities of employers and employees under any
law with respect to injuries, diseases, or death of employees arising out of,
or in the course of, employment.”  (29
U.S.C.A. §653(4).)  
 
            Like
Defendant C&C, Defendant Surface argues the Hazard Communications Standard
bars Plaintiff’s claims. As explained in the ruling on C&C’s motion, the
Hazard Communications Standard at best imposes a statutory duty on Plaintiff’s
employers or hirers as to workplace safety. 
Defendant Surface cites to no authority holding that the Hazard
Communications Standard makes the employer exclusively liable and bars or
preempts any state law claims against other alleged tortfeasors.  On reply, Defendant Surface abandons this
argument.  
 
            Defendant’s
Motion for Summary Judgment, or Summary Adjudication, based on the Hazard
Communications Standard is DENIED.  
 
            Fraudulent
Concealment 
 
            Defendant argues that Plaintiff’s
fraudulent concealment claim fails because Defendant did not conceal the safety
information relevant to Plaintiff’s claims. 
According to Defendant, it has made an MSDS available for every purchase
or shipment of Vadara Quartz since at least as early as May 1, 2017.  (Defendant’s UMF No. 6.)  Defendant cites to ¶304, 120:18-20 of
Plaintiff’s FAC as evidence of this material fact.  (Defendant’s UMF No. 6.)  However, ¶304 of the FAC merely states, “On
May 1, 2017 Vadara issued a Safety Data Sheet for Vadara Quartz Surfaces,
identifying the manufacturer/supplier of the product as Vadara Quartz Surfaces,
8969 Bradley Avenue, Sun Valley, CA 91352.” 
(Defendant’s Index of Evidence, Ex. A, FAC, ¶304, 120:18-20.)  Defendant’s claim that it has made an MSDS
available for every purchase or shipment of Vadara Quartz since May 1, 2017 is unsupported.  
 
            Defendant’s
UMF No. 8 also states, “The Material Safety Data Sheet issued by Surface
contains information that puts it in compliance with the information required
by Federal Law to be on a Material Safety Data Sheet.”  (Defendant’s UMF No. 8.)  Defendant’s UMF No. 8 is not a material fact
but a legal conclusion unsupported by any briefing.  Defendant merely cites as evidence the MSDS
sheet and 29 C.F.R. 1910.2000.  As moving
party, Defendant has the burden of establishing that the MSDS sheet complies
with the requirements of 29 C.F.R. 1910.2000. 
Defendant merely cites to (1) the 2017 MSDS’s statement that “Dust Masks
do not provide suitable respiratory protection” and (2) a conclusory statement
that “The [MSDS]…contains information related to the potentially hazardous
nature of silica containing stone, the appropriate manner in which it should be
fabricated, and the protective equipment that may be necessary for protection.”  (Defendant’s Memorandum of Points and
Authorities, 10:19-23.)  Defendant fails
to establish that its MSDS fully complies with the requirements of 29 C.F.R
§1910.2000.
 
            Defendant’s
UMF No. 11 indicates Surface’s MSDS is currently available on its website.  (Defendant’s UMF No. 11.)  That does not establish that it has been
publicly available for the entire time that Plaintiff worked on Defendant’s
product.  Defendant also fails to address
Plaintiff’s claim that those MSDS sheets were not provided to him at all or
that those sheets did not fully and accurately disclose risks associated with
the product or the safety precautions required to work with the material.  
 
            Defendant’s
Motion for Summary Adjudication of the fraudulent concealment cause of action
is DENIED.  
 
            Breach
of Implied Warranty
 
            In determining whether a defendant
breached the implied warranty of merchantability and fitness for normal use, “crucial
to the inquiry is whether the product conformed to the standard performance of
like products used in the trade.  This
determination may depend on testimony of persons familiar with the industry
standards and local practices and is a question of fact.”  (Pisano v. American Lease (1983) 146
Cal.App.3d 194, 198.)
 
            Defendant moves for summary
adjudication of the breach of implied warranty on ground that its slabs were
fit for their ordinary purpose: they conformed to the standard performance of
like products used in the trade.  None of
the thirteen material facts set forth in Defendant’s Separate Statement supports
such a conclusion. Defendant’s evidence also fails to set forth any such
facts.  Defendant’s brief does not
explain how any of the evidence or material facts presented establish that its
slabs were fit for their ordinary purpose. 

 
            Defendant
makes no showing regarding its product’s performance.  The “crucial” inquiry is whether its product
“conformed to the standard performance of like products used in the
trade.”  (Pisano, supra,
146 Cal.App.3d 194, 198.)  The applicable
standard for determining merchantability cited by Defendant requires that
Defendant make some showing as to the standard performance of like
products used in the trade.  Defendant
submits no evidence as to how its product performs, what the standard
performance of like products is and whether its product performance conforms to
the standard performance of like products. 
Defendant fails to establish that its product is merchantable and fit
for normal use as an issue of law.  
 
             Instead, Defendant argues “Plaintiffs did not
plead facts, and have no evidence, tending to show there is another stone that
serves as the standard product used in the stone cutting trade that is more
‘standard’ than Vadara Quartz stone slabs.” 
(Defendant’s Memorandum of Points and Authorities, 12:25-27.)  Defendant must present evidence to negate
Plaintiff’s allegations, or it must point to factually devoid responses that
support a finding that Plaintiff cannot establish an essential element and
cannot reasonably obtain such evidence. 
Defendant fails to do either.  The
burden never shifted to Plaintiff to raise a triable issue of fact.   
 
            Defendant’s
Motion for Summary Adjudication of the breach of implied warranty cause of
action is DENIED.  
 
            Loss
of Consortium
 
            Defendant moves for summary
adjudication of Plaintiff Alma Delia Llamas’s loss of consortium claim on
grounds that the underlying causes of action by Plaintiff Garcia-Rosas are
barred.  As discussed above, Defendant
fails to establish that those claims are barred.  As such, Defendant’s Motion for Summary
Adjudication of the Loss of Consortium cause of action is DENIED.  
 
            Punitive
Damages
 
            “In
the usual case, the question of whether the defendant's conduct will support an
award of punitive damages is for the trier of fact, since the degree of
punishment depends on the peculiar circumstances of each case.  But the issue may be resolved on summary
judgment, giving due regard to the higher proof standard. While the clear and
convincing evidentiary standard is a stringent one, it does not impose on a
plaintiff the obligation to prove a case for punitive damages at summary
judgment.  However, where the plaintiff's
ultimate burden of proof will be by clear and convincing evidence, the higher
standard of proof must be taken into account in ruling on a motion for summary
judgment or summary adjudication, since if a plaintiff is to prevail on a claim
for punitive damages, it will be necessary that the evidence presented meet the
higher evidentiary standard.  Summary
judgment on the issue of punitive damages is proper only when no reasonable
jury could find the plaintiff's evidence to be clear and convincing proof of
malice, fraud or oppression.”  (Johnson
& Johnson v. Superior Court (2011) 192 Cal.App.4th 757, 762; Pacific
Gas and Electric Company v. Superior Court (2018) 24 Cal.App.5th 1150,
1158–1159.)
 
            As
the party moving for adjudication of Plaintiff’s punitive damages claim,
Defendant bears the initial burden of production on Plaintiff’s punitive
damages claim.  (CCP §437c(f)(1) and (2);
Johnson & Johnson v. Supr. Ct. (2011) 192 Cal.App.4th 757, 761.)  A defendant may satisfy its initial burden on
summary judgment by showing that the claim “cannot be established” because of
the lack of evidence on some essential element of the claim.  (Union Bank v. Supr. Ct. (1995) 31
Cal.App.4th 574, 590.) Summary judgment still requires, however, the
presentation of evidence in the form of “affidavits, declarations, admissions,
answers to interrogatories, depositions, and matters of which judicial notice”
to demonstrate that plaintiff does not possess and cannot reasonably obtain
necessary evidence to establish his or her claim.  (Id. at 854.)  
 
            For
this reason, a defendant does not meet its burden under CCP §437(c)(o)(1) by
merely “pointing out” or “arguing” that the plaintiff does not possess or
cannot reasonably obtain necessary evidence. (Id.; Lona v. Citibank,
N.A. (2011) 202 Cal.App.4th 89 (defendant bank did not meet its burden on
summary judgment of wrongful foreclosure by merely arguing that plaintiff
lacked evidence to support her claim and only documentary evidence submitted
were the loan documents); Gaggero v. Yura (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 884,
890 (defendant did not establish plaintiff’s lack of evidence or inability to
reasonably obtain evidence of plaintiff’s ability and willingness to perform by
pointing to plaintiff’s refusal to answer certain questions during deposition
on grounds of a meritless privacy objection; such a refusal, regardless of its
merit, was neither an admission nor a factually devoid discovery response).)
 
            Defendant
fails to submit any evidence negating Plaintiff’s punitive damages claim. As
discussed in connection with the fraudulent concealment claim, Defendant fails
to negate Plaintiff’s allegations of fraudulent concealment with admissible
evidence, nor are Plaintiff’s discovery responses factually devoid.  
 
            Defendant
also argues Plaintiff’s employer intentionally concealed the safety information
from Plaintiff and it was Plaintiff’s employer who acted fraudulently.  As discussed above, Defendant’s evidence
fails to establish that Plaintiff’s employer or hirer intentional concealed
safety information.  
 
            Defendant
argues it has always made its MSDS publicly available.  However, as discussed in connection with the
fraudulent concealment action, Defendant’s evidence only establishes that the MSDS
is currently available on its website.  
 
            Defendant’s
Motion for Summary Adjudication of the punitive damages claim is DENIED.

Legal
Standard
 
            A
motion for summary judgment or adjudication provides “courts with a mechanism
to cut through the parties’ pleadings in order to determine whether, despite
their allegations, trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute.”  (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co.
(2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.)  It must be
granted “if all the evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably
deducible from the evidence’ and uncontradicted by other inferences or

the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”¿ (Adler v.
Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119 [quoting Code Civ.
Proc., § 437c, subd. (c)].)  
 
            Where
a defendant seeks summary judgment or adjudication, he must show that either
“one or more elements of the cause of action, even if not separately pleaded,
cannot be established, or that there is a complete defense to that cause of
action.”  (Code of Civ. Pros., section
437c, subd. (o)(2).)  A defendant may
satisfy this burden by showing that the claim “cannot be established” because
of the lack of evidence on some essential element of the claim.  (Union Bank v. Superior Court (1995)
31 Cal.App.4th 574, 590.)  Once the
defendant meets this burden, the burden shifts to plaintiff to show that a
“triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to that cause of action

            “A

            In
addition, the evidence and affidavits of the moving party are construed
strictly, while those of the opponent are liberally read.  (Government Employees Ins. Co. v. Sup. Ct.

of the party opposing the motion (i.e., a denial of summary judgment).”  (Hamburg v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.
(2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 497, 502.)
 
Defendant’s Motion for Summary
Judgment, or Summary Adjudication
 
            Lack
of Causation
 
            Causation
is ultimately a question of fact. (Butler v. Bell Helicopter Textron, Inc.
(2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 1073, 1088.)  A
threshold issue in toxic tort causes is “exposure to the defendant’s product…If
there has been no exposure, there is no causation.  (Whitmore v. Ingersoll-Rand Co. (2010)
184 Cal.App.4th 101078, 1083; see also Neel v. Magana, Olney,
Levy, Cathcart & Gelfand (1971) 6 Cal.3d 176, 187 [causes of action
share fundamental elements wrongdoing, causation, and harm].)  “The mere possibility of exposure does not
create a triable issue of fact.”  (Whitmire
v. Ingersoll-Rand Co. (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 1078, 1093.)
 
            “Circumstantial
evidence supporting a defendant's summary judgment motion can consist of
factually devoid discovery responses from which an absence of evidence can be
inferred, but the burden should not shift without stringent review of the
direct, circumstantial and inferential evidence.”  (Andrews v. Foster Wheeler LLC (2006)
138 Cal.App.4th 96, 101 (“Andrews”).)  Once
a defendant satisfies its burden as moving party on summary judgment on lack of
exposure, a plaintiff must produce evidence of the “time, location and actual
circumstance of his exposure” to the defendant’s product.  (Hunter v. Pacific Mechanical Corp. (1995)
37 Cal.App.4th 1282, 1290 (disapproved of on other grounds in Aguilar
v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826).)  
 
            Defendant
fails to satisfy its burden as moving party on the issue of exposure.  Defendant attempts to negate the allegation
of exposure and causation by relying on Plaintiff’s discovery responses,
arguing that Plaintiff’s testimony regarding his exposure to Defendant’s
product fails to allege the frequency, manner, and significance of Plaintiff’s
work with that product.  Defendant argues
Plaintiff’s responses only provided general statements regarding his work with
its products.  
            
            Defendant
mischaracterizes Plaintiff’s discovery responses in the Separate Statement as
“devoid of any meaningful piece of evidentiary facts or documents” supporting his
claim against Cambria.  (Defendant’s UMF
No. 3.)  Defendant may be attempting to
satisfy its burden as moving party based on “factually devoid responses.”   Plaintiff’s
responses are not “factually devoid.”  (Union
Bank v. Supr. Ct. (1995) 31 Cal.App.4th 573, 590 (responses were factually
devoid where plaintiff could not identify any fact or evidence to support fraud
claims and admitted that defendant “took no inappropriate action in connection
with its role in the transactions); Lona v. Citibank, N.A. (2011) 202
Cal.App.4th 89 (defendant did not satisfy burden as moving party by merely
arguing that plaintiff lacked evidence and only evidence submitted were loan
documents; Gaggero v. Yura (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 884, 890 (plaintiff’s
refusal to answer certain questions during deposition on grounds of meritless
privacy objection was neither an admission or a factually devoid discovery
response).)
 
            At
deposition, Plaintiff testified that he worked with Cambria products.  (Defendant’s Evidence, Ex. E, 929:6-24.)  Plaintiff testified that he worked with
Cambria products with two hirers/employers—“Mr. Hugo” and Bradeskoval.  (Id. at 929:10-14.)  Plaintiff testified that he worked with
Cambria slab in “2019, 2020” and the last year he worked with Cambria slab was
“’20 or ’21.”  (Id. at 929:18-24.)  Plaintiff identified “Cambria” as the product
name and its trademark or symbol, a dragon. 
(Id. at 930:15-25-931:1-2, 934:6-15.)  Plaintiff testified that he fabricated “two
or three” Cambria slabs for “Mr. Hugo.” 
(Id. at 933:3-4.)  Plaintiff
testified that he worked with two Cambria slabs for fireplaces and two or three
kitchen projects while with Bradeskoval. 
(Id. at 937:1-7.)  After
that, Plaintiff did not work with any more Cambria materials.  (Id. at 937:5-7.)  
 
            Plaintiff’s
deposition testimony meets the standard in Hunter; it does not raise only
a “mere possibility” of exposure.  Unlike
the plaintiff in Hunter, who could only testify that he was personally
unaware of defendant’s activities at his jobsite, or the plaintiff in Whitmire,
who could only establish that some of the buildings he worked in may have had
asbestos-lade insulation, Plaintiff testified that he worked with 
Cambria products, identifying the
product by name and by trademark or symbol. 
Plaintiff testified as to the number of times he worked with Cambria
slabs and the years during which he worked with them.  Plaintiff deposition testimony affirmatively
establishes exposure and is not factually devoid. 
 
            In
Plaintiff’s opposition and Defendant’s reply, the parties wrangle over whether
the extent of Plaintiff’s exposure to Cambria products could have medically
caused Plaintiff’s cancer. This issue is outside of Defendant’s motion for
summary judgment, which argued lack of causation based only on lack of
exposure.  Defendant did not attack
whether the exposure testified to could be the medical cause of Plaintiff’s
cancer, nor would such an attack have been successful given the lack of any
expert testimony on the issue.  Specific
causation in cases alleging cancer due to product exposure is clearly an issue outside
the realm of the knowledge of lay persons. 
(Johnson & Johnson Talcum Powder Cases (2019) 37 Cal.App.5th
292, 302 (comparing “‘specific causation,’ i.e. offering an opinion that talc
caused [plaintiff’s] ovarian cancer” and “general causation, i.e. offering an
opinion that talc in general may cause ovarian cancer”).)  “Although juries are normally permitted to
decide issues of causation without guidance from experts, ‘the unknown and
mysterious etiology of cancer’ is beyond the experience of laymen and can only
be explained through expert testimony.”  (Cooper
v. Takeda Pharmaceuticals America, Inc. (2015) 239 Cal.App.4th 555, 578.) 
 
            Defendant argues on reply that the
level of exposure testified to by Plaintiff cannot be a substantial factor in
causing Plaintiff’s cancer.  Defendant’s
argument on reply is, again, outside the scope of its causation argument,
particularly given its failure to shift the burden to Plaintiff.  Defendant’s argument is also wholly
unsupported by any admissible expert testimony on the issue.  
            Among Defendant’s factual claims,
however, is that its products could not have been a substantial factor in
causing Plaintiff’s cancer, because Plaintiff’s expert testified that Plaintiff
developed cancer by October 26, 2019, and Plaintiff testifies that he was first
exposed to Cambria products in 2019 or 2020. 
 But testimony concerning the
radiologist’s findings was based on Plaintiff’s x-ray on October 26, 2019; it
summarized the radiologist’s findings that the x-ray revealed “airspace
disease,” and the X-ray was consistent with “pneumonia” and “concerning for
tuberculosis.”  (Rosenman Dec.,
¶73.)  Rosenman does not opine that this
was when Plaintiff developed silicosis, only that the findings of the
radiologist who took the X-ray were consistent with silicosis.  (Id. at ¶73.)    
            Defendant
fails to negate Plaintiff’s allegation of exposure.  Defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment, or
in the Alternative Summary Adjudication based on lack of causation is
DENIED.  
 
            Sophisticated
Intermediary Doctrine
 
            Under
the sophisticated intermediary doctrine, “a supplier may discharge its duty to
warn end users about known or knowable risks in the use of its product if it:
(1) provides adequate warnings to the product's immediate purchaser, or sells
to a sophisticated purchaser that it knows is aware or should be aware of the
specific danger, and (2) reasonably relies on the purchaser to convey
appropriate warnings to downstream users who will encounter the product.
Because the sophisticated intermediary doctrine is an affirmative defense, the
supplier bears the burden of proving that it adequately warned the
intermediary, or knew the intermediary was aware or should have been aware of
the specific hazard, and reasonably relied on the intermediary to transmit
warnings.”  (Webb v. Special Electric
Co., Inc. (2016) 63 Cal.4th 167, 187.) 

 
            “Like
the sophisticated user defense, the sophisticated intermediary defense applies
to failure to warn claims sounding in either strict liability or
negligence.  As we have previously
observed, there is little functional difference between the two theories in the
failure to warn context.  In failure to
warn cases, whether asserted on negligence or strict liability grounds, there
is but one unitary theory of liability which is negligence based—the duty to
use reasonable care in promulgating a warning.” 
(Id.)  
 
            “[T]he
sophisticated intermediary doctrine provides that a supplier can discharge its
duty to warn if it provides adequate warnings, or sells to a sufficiently
sophisticated buyer, and reasonably relies on the buyer to warn end users about
the harm. Reasonable reliance depends on all attendant circumstances and is
typically a question of fact for the jury.” 
(Webb, supra, 63 Cal.4th at 180; see also 6 Witkin,
Summary (11th ed. 2024), Torts § 1322.) 
 
            Defendant
fails to satisfy its burden on the affirmative defense of sophisticated
intermediary.  To establish an entity is
a sophisticated intermediary, Defendant must present evidence that (1) it provided
adequate warnings to the product's immediate purchaser, or (2) sells to a
sophisticated purchaser that it knows is aware or should be aware of the
specific danger.  (Webb, supra,
63 Cal.4th at 187.)  
 
            Defendant
argues it is “undisputed” that Bradeskoval is a sophisticated
intermediary.  However, this is a legal
conclusion. It is Defendant’s burden to establish with admissible evidence that
Bradeskoval is a sophisticated intermediary as defined under Webb and
its progeny.  This requires evidence of
Defendant’s actual reliance on Bradeskoval to provide the requisite warnings.  (Webb, supra, 63 Cal.4th at
193 (defendant asserting sophisticated intermediary doctrine must establish
“actual and reasonable reliance.”) 
Actual reliance can be inferred by a jury from “circumstantial evidence
about the parties’ dealings.”  (Id.)  
 
            Defendant
fails to establish actual reliance. 
Defendant presents no evidence establishing that Bradeskoval was an
immediate purchaser to whom Defendant provided adequate warnings, nor does
Defendant present any evidence that it sold its product to Bradeskoval
specifically, knowing that it was aware or should have been aware of the
specific danger of silicosis or serious lung disease.  Defendant presents no evidence regarding the
nature of Bradeskoval’s business or any sales to Bradeskoval of its
product.  Defendant’s only material facts
regarding Bradeskoval involve the years during which Plaintiff worked there
(Defendants’ UMF No. 17) and what Plaintiff did for his employers/hirers
(Defendant’s UMF Nos. 18-19).  Defendant’s
MSDS dated January 5, 2001 and the OSHA fact sheet submitted by Defendant do
not establish actual reliance.  (Defendant’s
UMF Nos. 20-23; Defendant’s Index of Exhibits, Exs. H and I.)  There is simply no evidence of Defendant and
Bradeskoval’s “dealings” from which actual reliance can be inferred or
established.  The Court cannot speculate
or assume that Bradeskoval was an immediate purchaser or that Defendant knew of
facts indicating that Bradeskoval knew or should have known of the risks
associated with silicosis.  
            
            Defendant
also cites to its MSDS, the OSHA Fact Sheet and Plaintiff’s FAC to establish widespread
knowledge that exposure to silica dust when stone cutting carries health
risks.  (Defendant’s UMF Nos. 21-23;
Defendant’s Index of Exhibits, Ex. A, 26:4-5.) 
Defendant was required to submit evidence that Bradeskoval specifically knew
or should have known of the risk of silicosis or serious lung damage associated
with Defendant’s specific product.  (Webb,
supra, 63 Cal.4th at 193 (defendant failed to establish that
intermediary was sophisticated intermediary based on evidence of that
intermediary was “aware of the risks of asbestos, in general”; defendant had to
present evidence that intermediary “knew about the particularly acute risks
posed by the crocidolite asbestos [defendant] supplied.”)  Moreover, none of these documents establish that
Defendant provided adequate warnings to Bradeskoval, an immediate purchaser, or
that Defendant knew Bradeskoval had actual or constructive knowledge of the
specific risk of silicosis or lung disease when working with Defendant’s
product.  
 
            Defendant
argues it reasonably relied on Bradeskoval to provide end users with warnings
about risk of lung damage and disease, like silicosis, associated with its
product.  Defendant argues its reliance
on Bradeskoval to warn end users was reasonable, because Bradeskoval was an
employer independently obligated to maintain a safe workplace under
OSHA/Cal-OSHA.  
 
            Reliance
on an immediate purchaser can be reasonable where the purchaser itself has a
duty to warn of the same risk and there is no practicable way for the
manufacturer to warn the end user.  (Persons
v. Salomon North America, Inc. (1990) 217 Cal.App.3d 168, 178.)  However, as discussed above, Defendant has
not established the threshold issue of actual reliance on Bradeskoval to warn
of the risk.  
            
            Defendant’s
Motion for Summary Judgment, or in the Alternative, Summary Adjudication based
on the Sophisticated Intermediary Doctrine is DENIED.  
 
            Sophisticated
User Defense
 
            “The
sophisticated user defense exempts manufacturers from their typical obligation
to provide product users with warnings about the products' potential hazards.
The defense is considered an exception to the manufacturer's general duty to
warn consumers, and therefore, in most jurisdictions, if successfully argued,
acts as an affirmative defense to negate the manufacturer's duty to warn.  [¶] 
Under the sophisticated user defense, sophisticated users need not be
warned about dangers of which they are already aware or should be aware.
Because these sophisticated users are charged with knowing the particular
product's dangers, the failure to warn about those dangers is not the legal
cause of any harm that product may cause.” 
(Johnson v. American Standard, Inc. (“Johnson”) (2008) 43
Cal.4th 56, 65; see also 6 Witkin, Summary (11th ed. 2020), Torts
§1321.)   
 
            “A
manufacturer is not liable to a sophisticated user of its product for failure
to warn of a risk, harm, or danger, if the sophisticated user knew or should
have known of that risk, harm, or danger. It would be nearly impossible for a
manufacturer to predict or determine whether a given user or member of the
sophisticated group actually has knowledge of the dangers because of the
infinite number of user idiosyncrasies. For example, given users may have
misread their training manuals, failed to study the information in those
manuals, or simply forgotten what they were taught. However, individuals who
represent that they are trained or are members of a sophisticated group of
users are saying to the world that they possess the level of knowledge and
skill associated with that class. If they do not actually possess that
knowledge and skill, that fact should not give rise to liability on the part of
the manufacturer.”  (Id. at 71.)
 
            “Thus,
in order to establish the defense, the defendant must identify the relevant
risk, show that sophisticated users are already aware of the risk, and
demonstrate that the plaintiff is a member of the group of sophisticated
users.”  (Buckner v. Milwaukee
Electric Tool Corp. (2013) 222 Cal.App.4th 522, 535.)  “In the context of the sophisticated user
defense, because the intended users are deemed to know of the risks,
manufacturers have no obligation to warn, and providing no warning is
appropriate. The focus of the defense, therefore, is whether the danger in
question was so generally known within the trade or profession that a
manufacturer should not have been expected to provide a warning specific to the
group to which plaintiff belonged.”  (Id.
at 534.)
 
            The
sophisticated user defense is applicable to both negligence and strict
liability causes of action based on failure to warn.  (Id. at 71.)  The sophisticated user defense does not apply
to strict liability or negligence claims based on a design defect risk-benefit theory.  (Johnson v. Honeywell Int. (“Honeywell”)
(2009) 179 Cal.App.4th 549, 558 (sophisticated user defense did not bar
HVAC technician's strict products liability claim against refrigerant
manufacturers, where claim was based on design defect risk-benefit theory,
rather than failure to warn; there is no logical reason why defense based on
need for warning should apply in design defect case).)  However, where a design defect claim is based
on the consumer expectations test, which is based on the expectations of the
ordinary consumer, the sophisticated user defense applies.  (Id. at 558, fn 4.)
 
            “A
user's sophistication is determined at the time of his or her injury.  The timeline focuses on the general
population of sophisticated users and conforms to the defense's purpose to
eliminate any duty to warn when the expected user population is generally aware
of the risk at issue.”  (Moran v.
Foster Wheeler Energy Corp. (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 500, 511–512.)  Thus, to establish the sophisticated user
defense, defendant must present admissible evidence establishing that the
general population of sophisticated users knew or should have known of the
particular risk or danger suffered by the plaintiff from the time of
plaintiff’s first exposure onward.  (Id.
at 518; Scott v. Ford Motor Co. (2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 1492, 1500-1501.)

 
             Defendant fails to satisfy its burden as the
party seeking summary judgment based on the Sophisticated User Defense.  Defendant was required to “identify the
relevant risk, show that sophisticated users are already aware of the risk, and
demonstrate that the plaintiff is a member of the group of sophisticated
users.”  (Buckner, supra, 222
Cal.App.4th at 535.)  “In order to
establish the defense, a manufacturer must demonstrate that sophisticated users
of the product know what the risks are, including the degree of danger involved
(i.e., the severity of the potential injury), and how to use the product to
reduce or avoid the risks, to the extent that information is known to the
manufacturer.”  (Moran, supra,
246 Cal.App.4th at 516.)  
 
            Defendant
submits no evidence regarding Plaintiff’s training, certification, or education.  Defendant fails to establish the
applicability of the sophisticated user defense.
 
            Defendant’s
Motion for Summary Judgment, or in the alternative, Summary Adjudication based
on the Sophisticated User Defense is DENIED.
 
            Hazard
Communications Standard (29 C.F.R. § 1910.1200)
 
            Under 29 Code of Federal Regulations
§1910.1200(a)(2), the standard set forth therein is “intended to address
comprehensively the issue of classifying the potential hazards of chemicals,
and communicating information concerning hazards and appropriate protective
measures to employees, and to preempt any legislative or regulatory enactments
of a state, or political subdivision of a state, pertaining to this subject.”  (29 C.F.R. §1910.1200(a)(2).)  “This section requires chemical manufacturers
or importers to classify the hazards of chemicals which they produce or import,
and all employers to provide information to their employees about the hazardous
chemicals to which they are exposed, by means of a hazard communication
program, labels and other forms of warning, safety data sheets, and information
and training. In addition, this section requires distributors to transmit the
required information to employers.”  (29
C.F.R. §1910.1200(b)(1).)  
 
            However,
nothing in Title 29, Chapter 15 of the United States Annotated Code
(“Occupational Safety and Health”) “shall be construed to superseded or in any
manner affect any  workmen's compensation
law or to enlarge or diminish or affect in any other manner the common law or
statutory rights, duties, or liabilities of employers and employees under any
law with respect to injuries, diseases, or death of employees arising out of,
or in the course of, employment.”  (29
U.S.C.A. §653(4).)  
 
            Defendant
argues 29 C.F.R. §1910.1200 bars Plaintiff’s claims, because it makes employers
responsible for protecting their workforce from occupational exposures to
respirable chemicals.  Defendant argues
Plaintiff’s employers never provided him with any information, documents or
warnings issued by the stone countertop manufacturers and they are therefore
liable for Plaintiff’s injuries.
 
            Defendant’s
argument and evidence, at best, establish the statutory duty of Plaintiff’s employer
to provide warnings and protection against the dangers of exposure to the
products in question.  They do not bar
Plaintiff’s claims against Defendant. 
Defendant cites no authority holding that the Hazard Communications
Standard makes employers solely responsible or liable for employee injuries due
to chemical exposure.
 
            Defendant’s
Motion for Summary Judgment, or Summary Adjudication, based on the Hazard
Communications Standard is DENIED.  
 
            Fraudulent
Concealment 
 
            Defendant argues Plaintiff’s fraudulent
concealment claim fails as a matter of law did not owe Plaintiff a duty of
disclosure.  Citing Jones v.
ConocoPhillips Co. (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 1187, Defendant argues it was not
in a fiduciary relationship with Plaintiff and therefore did not have a duty of
disclosure.
 
            The
Court disagrees that fraudulent concealment requires a fiduciary relationship.  In Jones v. ConocoPhillips Co. (2011)
198 Cal.App.4th 1187, plaintiffs alleged a duty of disclosure based on (1)
defendant Dow’s awareness of the toxic nature of their products, (2) Dow’s sole
knowledge of that fact; and (3) decedent who worked with the product did not
have that knowledge available to him.  (Jones,
supra, 198 Cal.App.4th at 1199.)  The
decedent in Jones was also identically situated as Plaintiff—an employee
of employers who purchased and used chemicals from various manufacturers,
including Dow, who suffered various health issues as a result of exposure to
those chemicals.  (Id. at 1198.)  “Although, typically, a duty to disclose
arises when a defendant owes a fiduciary duty to a plaintiff, a duty to
disclose may also arise when a defendant possesses or exerts control over
material facts not readily available to the plaintiff.”  (Id.)
 
            The
analysis in Jones was based on LiMandri v. Judkins (1997) 52
Cal.App.4th 326, 336-337, which stated that, outside of a fiduciary
relationship, a duty to disclose can arise in three other circumstances:  when the defendant had exclusive knowledge of
material facts not known to the plaintiff; (3) when the defendant actively
conceals a material fact from the plaintiff; and (4) when the defendant makes
partial representations but also suppresses some material facts.  (LiMandri, supra, 52
Cal.App.4th at 336-337.)  “These three
circumstances, however, presuppose the existence of some other relationship
between the plaintiff and defendant in which a duty to disclose can
arise.”  (Id.)  Because Jones relied explicitly on
this discussion in LiMandri, Jones is reasonably interpreted to
imply that “some other relationship,” such as a transactional relationship,
exists between an employee who uses a hazardous chemical purchased by his or
her employer and the manufacturer or distributor from whom the employer
purchased that product.  (LiMandri,
supra, 52 Cal.App.4th at 337.)
 
            Such
an interpretation is supported by Peterson v. Lamb Rubber Co. (1960) 54
Cal.2d 339, 347.  Peterson held
that an employee is in contractual privity with a manufacturer for purposes of
a breach of implied warranty claim: 
“[I]t is a matter of common knowledge, and of course known to
vendor-manufacturers, that most businesses are carried on by means of the
assistance of employees and that equipment or supplies purchased by employers
will in actual use be handled by the employes, who in this respect may be said
to stand in the shoes of the employer.”  (Peterson,
supra, 54 Cal.2d at 347.)  By this
reasoning, an employee of a company that purchases a toxic chemical for use in
the employer’s business is in a “transactional relationship” with the
manufacturer of that chemical and a duty to disclose exists.  
 
            Defendant
also argues Plaintiff does not have, and cannot reasonably obtain, evidence
that it fraudulently concealed any information from him that led to his
injury.  Defendant’s statement is not
supported by any evidence, e.g. factually devoid responses and facts and
evidence of Plaintiff’s inability to reasonably obtain evidence of such fraud.  A defendant does not meet its burden under
CCP §437(c)(o)(1) by merely “pointing out” or “arguing” that the plaintiff does
not possess or cannot reasonably obtain necessary evidence. (Union Bank v.
Supr. Ct. (1995) 31 Cal.App.4th 574, 590.)
 
            Defendant’s
Motion for Summary Adjudication of the fraudulent concealment cause of action
is DENIED.   
 
            Punitive
Damages
 
            “In
the usual case, the question of whether the defendant's conduct will support an
award of punitive damages is for the trier of fact, since the degree of
punishment depends on the peculiar circumstances of each case.  But the issue may be resolved on summary
judgment, giving due regard to the higher proof standard. While the clear and
convincing evidentiary standard is a stringent one, it does not impose on a
plaintiff the obligation to prove a case for punitive damages at summary
judgment.  However, where the plaintiff's
ultimate burden of proof will be by clear and convincing evidence, the higher
standard of proof must be taken into account in ruling on a motion for summary
judgment or summary adjudication, since if a plaintiff is to prevail on a claim
for punitive damages, it will be necessary that the evidence presented meet the
higher evidentiary standard.  Summary
judgment on the issue of punitive damages is proper only when no reasonable
jury could find the plaintiff's evidence to be clear and convincing proof of
malice, fraud or oppression.”  (Johnson
& Johnson v. Superior Court (2011) 192 Cal.App.4th 757, 762; Pacific
Gas and Electric Company v. Superior Court (2018) 24 Cal.App.5th 1150,
1158–1159.)
 
            As
the party moving for adjudication of Plaintiff’s punitive damages claim,
Defendant bears the initial burden of production on Plaintiff’s punitive
damages claim.  (CCP §437c(f)(1) and (2);
Johnson & Johnson v. Supr. Ct. (2011) 192 Cal.App.4th 757, 761.)  A defendant may satisfy its initial burden on
summary judgment by showing that the claim “cannot be established” because of
the lack of evidence on some essential element of the claim.  (Union Bank v. Supr. Ct. (1995) 31
Cal.App.4th 574, 590.) Summary judgment still requires, however, the
presentation of evidence in the form of “affidavits, declarations, admissions,
answers to interrogatories, depositions, and matters of which judicial notice”
to demonstrate that plaintiff does not possess and cannot reasonably obtain
necessary evidence to establish his or her claim.  (Id. at 854.)  
 
            For
this reason, a defendant does not meet its burden under CCP §437(c)(o)(1) by
merely “pointing out” or “arguing” that the plaintiff does not possess or
cannot reasonably obtain necessary evidence. (Id.; Lona v. Citibank,
N.A. (2011) 202 Cal.App.4th 89 (defendant bank did not meet its burden on
summary judgment of wrongful foreclosure by merely arguing that plaintiff
lacked evidence to support her claim and only documentary evidence submitted
were the loan documents); Gaggero v. Yura (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 884,
890 (defendant did not establish plaintiff’s lack of evidence or inability to
reasonably obtain evidence of plaintiff’s ability and willingness to perform by
pointing to plaintiff’s refusal to answer certain questions during deposition
on grounds of a meritless privacy objection; such a refusal, regardless of its
merit, was neither an admission nor a factually devoid discovery response).)
 
            Defendant
fails to carry its burden as the party moving for summary adjudication of the
punitive damages claim. Defendant argues Plaintiff does not have evidence that
an officer, director, or managing agent ever engaged in an act or omission
constituting malice, oppression, or fraud. 
Defendant also argues Plaintiff cannot reasonably obtain such
evidence.  
 
            Defendant
relies on Plaintiff’s responses to Defendant’s Special Interrogatory No. 33 and
RFP No. 37.  (Defendant’s UMF Nos. 25 and
26.)  The Special Interrogatory asked
Plaintiff to identify those persons or entities with knowledge of facts
supporting his punitive damages claim.  (Id.
at Ex. J, SI No. 33.)  The RFP asked
that Plaintiff identify all document identified in Plaintiff’s responses to the
Special Interrogatories.  (Id. at
Ex. K, RFP No. 37.)  In his responses to
these discovery requests, Plaintiff identifies certain persons who were Cambria
employees and multiple documents. 
(Defendant’s Index of Exhibits, Ex B, 33:15-34:3; Ex. C. 32:25-26,
4:5-12:5.)  Such responses are not
factually devoid, nor do they demonstrate that Plaintiff cannot reasonably
obtain evidence in support of his punitive damages claim.  Plaintiff’s responses do not admit his
inability to obtain such evidence, nor do they unambiguously admit a fact
negating an element of Plaintiff’s claim. 

 
            Defendant
also argues its MSDS establishes that it was not intentionally concealing
information that gave rise to Plaintiff’s injuries.  Defendant, however, fails to submit any
evidence regarding the availability or distribution of its January 5, 2001 MSDS.  Defendant relies solely on a copy of its
January 5, 2001 MSDS.  Defendant’s
evidence also fails to address Plaintiff’s allegation that Defendant’s warnings
were inadequate, including the failure to place warnings on the product
itself.  
 
            Defendant
argues it is not liable for punitive damages, because it was Plaintiff’s
employer’s or hirer’s responsibility to provide safety warnings to
Plaintiff.  The fact that Plaintiff’s
employer or hirer may have failed to provide safety warnings to Plaintiff does
not negate Plaintiff’s allegation that Defendant fraudulently concealed material
information that led to Plaintiff’s injury.
 
            Defendant
fails to satisfy its burden as the party moving for summary adjudication of the
punitive damages claim.  Defendant’s
Motion for Summary Adjudication of the punitive damages claim is DENIED.
