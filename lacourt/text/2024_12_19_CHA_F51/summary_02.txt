And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the demurrer filed by the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Moving Defendant) is sustained without leave to amend. The judge found that the plaintiff, Nathan Lewellen, failed to allege facts sufficient to support his claims against the Moving Defendant. The Moving Defendant demurred to the plaintiff's complaint, arguing that the plaintiff did not present a government claim for damages to the MTA, and therefore, the claims presentation requirement was not met. The judge agreed with the Moving Defendant's argument, citing the Government Claims Act and the California Code of Civil Procedure. The judge also disregarded the plaintiff's supplemental declaration, which was deemed an unauthorized sur-reply. The judge concluded that there is no reasonable possibility of successfully amending the complaint to state a good cause of action, and therefore, the demurrer is sustained without leave to amend.
