BACKGROUND
 
This is contractual action in which
Plaintiff alleges that he loaned Defendant $36,600.00 so that Defendant “could
pay the arrearages owed on the Sierra Property’s mortgage and stop foreclosure”
of certain real property purchased by Defendant, located at 13006 Sierra
Highway, Santa Clarita, California 91390. (Compl. ¶¶ 6–11.) Defendant allegedly agreed to repay
Plaintiff in full within 90 days, made an initial repayment of $1,100.00, but
failed to make any additional payments. (Id. at ¶¶ 15–18.)
 
On 2/15/24, Plaintiff filed his
complaint, alleging against the Defendant the following causes of action: (1) Breach
of Contract; (2) Breach of Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing; (3) Fraud;
(4) Negligent Misrepresentation; (5) Unjust Enrichment; (6) Financial Elder
Abuse; and (7) Conversion. On 3/29/24, Defendant filed his general denial.
 
On 6/20/24, Plaintiff served his
first set of discovery requests on Defendant. (Decl. of Amy A. Mousavi ¶ 6.) On
8/5/24, Plaintiff filed the instant motions to compel Defendant’s responses
thereto. No oppositions have been filed to date.
 
ANALYSIS
 
A propounding party may move for an
order compelling a response to interrogatories if the responding party fails to
serve a timely response within 30 days. (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2030.290, subd.
(b); 2030.260, subd. (a).) Furthermore, the responding party who fails to serve
a timely response “waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings
under Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to the interrogatories,
including one based on privilege or on the protection for work product” unless
the Court grants it relief upon motion. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.290, subd.
(a).)
 
A propounding party may move for an
order compelling a response to a request for production of documents if the
responding party fails to serve a timely response within 30 days. (Code Civ.
Proc. §§ 2031.300, subd. (b); 2031.260, subd. (a).) Furthermore, the responding
party who fails to serve a timely response “waives any objection to the demand,
including one based on privilege or on the protection for work product” unless
the Court grants it relief upon motion. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.300, subd.
(a).)
 
A propounding party may move for an
order deeming the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters
specified in the requests be deemed admitted if the responding party fails to
serve a timely response within 30 days. (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2033.280, subd.
(b); 2033.250, subd. (a).) Furthermore, the responding party who fails to serve
a timely response “waives any objection to the requests, including one based on
privilege or on the protection for work product” unless the Court grants it
relief upon motion. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280, subd. (a).) “The court shall
make this order, unless it finds that the party to whom the requests for
admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a
proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial
compliance with Section 2033.220.” (Id. at subd. (c).)
 
Here, as Plaintiff served his first
set of discovery requests on Defendant by mail and electronic service on 6/20/24,
the last day for Defendant to respond was 7/29/24. (Code Civ. Proc. § 1013, subd. (a).) To
date, Defendant has not provided responses to the subject discovery requests. (Mousavi
Decl. ¶ 8.) As such, Defendant has waived any objections to the discovery
requests. 
 
The Court notes that Defendant has
failed to oppose the instant motions. Accordingly, the Court grants the instant
unopposed motions to compel Defendant’s objection-free responses to the subject
discovery requests. 
 
Sanctions¿ 
 
“The court shall impose a monetary
sanction … against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel a response to interrogatories, unless it finds that
the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that
other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ.
Proc. § 2030.290, subd. (c).)
 
“The court shall impose a monetary
sanction … against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.300, subd. (c).)
 
“It is mandatory that the court
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)
on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely response to requests
for admission necessitated this motion.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280, subd.
(c).) Additionally, “the court may impose a monetary sanction ordering that one
engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney advising that
conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred
by anyone as a result of that conduct.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.030, subd.
(a).)
 
Here, Plaintiff requests a total of
$3,300.00 in monetary sanctions to be imposed on Defendant. This amount
encompasses: (1) 3.2 hours of Plaintiff’s attorney’s time spent preparing the
motions; and (2) an anticipated 4 hours reviewing oppositions, preparing
replies, and preparing for and appearing at the hearing, at counsel’s hourly
rate of $425.00 per hour. (Mousavi Decl. ¶¶ 13–15.) Plaintiff also seeks to recover $60.00 in
filing fees per motion. (Id. at ¶
16.)
 
In granting the instant unopposed motions,
the Court finds it reasonable to award Plaintiff sanctions against Defendant in
the amount of $850.00 
¿ 
CONCLUSION¿ 
 
The unopposed motions are granted. Defendant is ordered to
provide objection-free responses to Plaintiff’s first set of discovery requests
within 30 days. The matters in Plaintiff’s RFAs, Set One, are deemed admitted. The
Court imposes monetary sanctions against Defendant in the amount of $850.00,
payable within 45 days.
