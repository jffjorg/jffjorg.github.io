On
August 15, 2023, Plaintiff BFS Group of California
LLC (“Plaintiff”) filed an action against Defendants Global Home Design
& Development, Inc., Zhirayr Jerry Lusikyan, individually and dba Global
Home Design & Development Inc., Narine Fstkchyan, individually and as

Fstkdayam, (“Defendants”) for breach of contract; quantum meruit; account

The
complaint alleges that in or around January 23, 2023, Plaintiff
and Defendants Global Home and Lusikyan entered into a written contract Credit
Application (“Contract”), the purpose of which was to allow Global Home and
Lusikyan to purchase building materials from Plaintiff on a credit basis for
various projects for which Global Home and Lusikyan would perform construction
services, including the private work of improvement of their property located
at 6525 Varna Avenue, Van Nuys, CA 91401. Further, Plaintiff alleges that on or
about March 9, 2023, Global Home and Lusikyan breached their Contract by
failing to pay the sum then due and owing to Plaintiff in the amount of
approximately $23,771.45, and by requiring Plaintiff to provide equipment and
materials without compensation.
                On
October 12, 2023, default was entered against Defendants Global Home and
Lusikyan (individually and dba Global Home).
 
            On
July 12, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant Motion for Order for Judgment
Pursuant to Stipulation.
No opposition has been filed. 
 
                
II.Legal Standard
 
CCP § 664.6, provides a summary
procedure that enables judges to enforce a settlement agreement by entering a
judgment pursuant to the terms of the parties’ settlement.  In particular,
the statute provides: 
 
(a) If parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a
writing signed by the parties outside of the presence of the court or orally
before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon
motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement. 
 
(b) For purposes of this section, a writing is signed by a
party if it is signed by any of the following: 
 
(1) The party. 
(2) An attorney who represents the party. 
(3) If the party is an insurer, an agent who is authorized
in writing by the insurer to sign on the insurer's behalf. 
 
(CCP¿§
664.6(a)-(b) (emphasis added).)
 
In hearing a CCP § 664.6 motion, the trial court may
receive evidence, determine disputed facts, and enter terms of a settlement
agreement as a judgment.  (Bowers v. Raymond J. Lucia Companies, Inc.
(2012) 206 Cal.App.4th 724, 732.) The Court may also receive oral
testimony in addition to declarations. (Kohn v. Jaymar-Ruby, Inc. (1994)
23 Cal.App.4th 1530, 1533.) The Court may interpret the terms and
conditions to settlement (Fiore v. Alvord (1985) 182 Cal.App.3d 561,
566), but the Court may not create material terms of a settlement, as opposed
to deciding what terms the parties themselves have previously agreed upon (Weddington
Productions, Inc. v. Flick (1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 793, 810). 
 
Strict
compliance with the statutory requirements is necessary before a court can
enforce a settlement agreement under this statute.  (Sully-Miller
Contracting Co. v. Gledson/Cashman Construction, Inc. (2002) 103
Cal.App.4th 30, 37.) The party seeking to enforce a
settlement “must first establish the agreement at issue was set forth ‘in a
writing signed by the parties’ (§ 664.6) or was made orally before the
court.  [Citation.]”  (Harris v. Rudin, Richman & Appel
(1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 299, 304.)  
 
             
III.Discussion 
 
 Plaintiff moves for an order enforcing its written
settlement agreement with Defendants Global Home and Lusikyan pursuant to CCP §
664.6. 
 
 
 
            While Plaintiffs have filed the Declarations of Christina
Oh and Bryan Manley, the Motion does not attach the fully executed stipulation
as Exhibit “A” and default notice as Exhibit “B” as referenced in Declaration(s).  
 
             
IV. Conclusion & Order 
 
For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff’s Motion to Enforce the Settlement Agreement is DENIED
without prejudice.  
 
Moving party is ordered to give
notice.
