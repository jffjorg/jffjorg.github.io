And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the Plaintiff's Motion for Order for Judgment Pursuant to Stipulation (CCP 664.6) without prejudice. The Plaintiff, BFS Group of California LLC, sought to enforce a settlement agreement with the Defendants, Global Home Design & Development, Inc., Zhirayr Jerry Lusikyan, Narine Fstkchyan, Harut Fstkdayam, and Hagop Fstkdayam. The settlement agreement was allegedly reached in a written contract Credit Application, which was executed on or around January 23, 2023. The Plaintiff alleged that the Defendants breached the contract by failing to pay the sum of approximately $23,771.45 and by requiring the Plaintiff to provide equipment and materials without compensation. The Judge noted that while the Plaintiff had filed the declarations of Christina Oh and Bryan Manley, the Motion did not attach the fully executed stipulation as Exhibit "A" and default notice as Exhibit "B" as referenced in the Declaration(s). The Judge also noted that the Plaintiff must establish that the agreement was set forth "in a writing signed by the parties" or was made orally before the court, as required by CCP ยง 664.6.
