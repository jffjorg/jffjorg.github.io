And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to compel compliance with the court's order of December 6, 2023, which compels the inspection of certain portions of the plaintiff's property. The court has found that the plaintiff failed to obey the court's order and has failed to permit the inspection as ordered. The court has awarded sanctions in the amount of $8,764.50 against the plaintiff. The court has also granted the defendant's request for attorney fees and costs associated with the motion. The court has found that the defendant provided adequate notice of the inspection to the plaintiff, and that the plaintiff's failure to respond to the notice was willful. The court has also found that the plaintiff's failure to permit the inspection was a violation of the court's order and that the defendant is entitled to sanctions as a result.
