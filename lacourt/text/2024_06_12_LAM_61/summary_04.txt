Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the demurrer filed by Hanmi Bank (the plaintiff) against Overseas Food Distribution, LLC and Shahpour Javidizad (the defendants) is sustained with leave to amend. The demurrer was filed in response to the defendants' answer to the plaintiff's first amended complaint. The judge found that the affirmative defenses raised by the defendants are insufficiently pleaded and are mere legal conclusions without any factual support. The judge noted that the defendants have not offered any opposition to the demurrer. The judge's decision is based on the principles of pleading and the requirements for a demurrer as set forth in California Code of Civil Procedure. The judge has given the plaintiff leave to amend its complaint to cure the defects identified in the demurrer.
