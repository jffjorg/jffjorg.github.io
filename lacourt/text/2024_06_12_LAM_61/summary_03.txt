And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has tentatively ruled to sustain the demurrer filed by the plaintiffs against the defendants' answer. The demurrer was filed due to the defendants' failure to properly plead their affirmative defenses. The judge found that the defendants' answer did not comply with the requirements of the Code of Civil Procedure and failed to provide sufficient facts to support their defenses. The judge also noted that the affirmative defenses were pleaded as "bare legal conclusions" without supporting facts. As a result, the judge granted the demurrer with leave to amend, allowing the defendants to re-plead their affirmative defenses in compliance with the law.
