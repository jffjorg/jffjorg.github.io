And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants Plaintiff Aram Bagramyan's motions to compel responses to Form and Special Interrogatories and Requests for Production served upon Defendants FMB Development, LLC and Ilan Kenig. The defendants failed to serve timely responses, and no responses were received despite informal meet-and-confer efforts. The judge awards sanctions of $2,685.00 against the defendants, payable within 30 days. The judge also notes that the original sanctions request of $16,110.00 is unreasonably excessive and reduces it to a single total award of $2,685.00 for all six motions.
