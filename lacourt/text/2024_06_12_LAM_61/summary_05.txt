And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has granted the Plaintiff's motion to seal Exhibits A-E of the Complaint. The Plaintiff has demonstrated an overriding interest in sealing the documents, citing potential competitive harm to the Defendant and the privacy interests of the participants. The exhibits contain sensitive commercial information and personal financial information, which would be prejudiced if disclosed to the public. The proposed order is narrowly tailored to the documents in question, and the court finds that sealing the records is necessary to protect these interests.
