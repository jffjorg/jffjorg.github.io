And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has made a tentative ruling to deny the petition for change of name filed by Jovan Kiro Roaches-Lambey, through his representative Keonee Young. The petition sought to change Jovan's name from Jovan Kiro Roaches-Lambey to Jovan Kiro Young-Lambey, adding his father's surname. The court initially considered the petition on April 23, 2024, but the hearing was continued twice due to the fact that only one parent consented to the name change. The court ordered the petitioner to serve the other parent with the Order to Show Cause at least 30 days before the hearing, but the record does not reflect that this was accomplished. Therefore, the petition is denied.
