And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer to a complaint filed by Eureka Young and others against Ford Motor Company and others. The complaint alleges that Ford issued a written warranty for a 2019 Lincoln Navigator, which developed transmission and other defects, and that Ford failed to repair or replace the vehicle. The complaint also alleges that Ford engaged in fraudulent inducement-concealment and negligent repair.

The court has overridden Ford's demurrer to the claim for fraudulent inducement-concealment, finding that the allegations are sufficient to support the claim. However, the court has sustained South Bay's demurrer to the claim for negligent repair, giving the plaintiff 10 days to amend the complaint.

The court's ruling is based on the following legal standards:

* A demurrer tests the sufficiency of a complaint as a matter of law.
* The court must assume the truth of properly pleaded factual allegations and judicially noticed matters.
* The economic loss rule bars tort recovery in a transaction where the plaintiff suffers only economic losses.

The court has also considered several case citations, including Schmidt v. Foundation Health, Blank v. Kirwan, and Robinson Helicopter Co., Inc. v. Dana Corp.

The court's tentative ruling is subject to change based on further briefing and argument.
