  Case Number:  24CMCP00012    Hearing Date:   July 18, 2024    Dept:  A 24CMCP00012
In the Matter of: Jovan Kiro Roaches-Lambey, by and through
 Keonee Young
Thursday,

[TENTATIVE] ORDER
DENYING
 THE PETITION FOR CHANGE OF NAME
 
              On April 23,
2024, the court initially considered the Petition filed on February
 29, 2024 by Jovan Kiro Roaches-Lambey, by and through Keonee Young, to
change name to Jovan Kiro Young-Lambey to add his father’s surname. Proof
of publication of the order to show cause was filed April 11, 2024. 
              The court has
twice continued the hearing since only one parent consented to the name change.
Petitioner was ordered to serve the other parent with the Order to Show Cause
at least 30 days before the hearing. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1277(a)(4).) The
record does not reflect that service on the non-consenting parent of the Order to
Show Cause was accomplished. 
Accordingly, the Petition is
DENIED.
