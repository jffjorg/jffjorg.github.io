And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the Defendant's motion to strike a portion of the complaint alleging that the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (LACMTA) is liable for the negligent supervision of its employees. The Judge found that the complaint is proper and that LACMTA can be held liable for its employees' negligent supervision and hiring/training of others. The Judge also found that a "special relationship" exists between a common carrier and its passengers, requiring a duty of "utmost" care. The Judge ruled that Plaintiff is not required to identify the Doe defendant in the complaint and that LACMTA is liable for death or injury proximately caused by a negligent or wrongful act or omission in the operation of any motor vehicle by an employee of the public entity acting within the scope of his employment.
