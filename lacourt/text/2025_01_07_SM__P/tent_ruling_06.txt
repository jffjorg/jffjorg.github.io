Doe v. Olson, Case no. SC126806
Hearing date January 7, 2025
Plaintiff Jane Doe’s Motion to
Disqualify Counsel
Defendant
Chateau Colline Homeowners Association’s Motions for Terminating Sanctions
Plaintiffs
Jane and May Doe, in pro per, and plaintiff John Doe sue defendants Curtis
Olson, Nexus Development Corporation, Chateau Colline Homeowners Association
(“Chateau”) and 13 others for 38 causes of action arising out of alleged sexual
assault, battery and harassment. 
Plaintiff
Jane Doe moves to disqualify defense counsel, alleging improper access to
confidential information and conflicts of interest. Defendant Chateau moves for
terminating sanctions as to defendants Jane and May Doe. Defendant Olson objects
to the declarations submitted by plaintiffs of a confidential witness, Jane
Doe, counsel Steven J. Aaronoff and William T. Heywood. 
Defendant Curtis Olson’s Objections
to Plaintiffs’ Declarations in Support of Motion to Disqualify
Defendant
Olson offers 158 evidentiary objections, 22 to the declaration of a
confidential witness and 136 to the declaration of Jane Doe. Objections 1-22
SUSTAINED (hearsay, lack of foundation). Objections 23-158 SUSTAINED (hearsay,
lack of foundation, improper legal conclusion, irrelevant, inadmissible
speculation and argument). The court notes no indicia of reliability is offered
to support the confidential witness’ hearsay declaration, rendering it inadmissible.
Plaintiff Jane Doe’s Motion to Disqualify
Counsel
When
considering a disqualification motion, courts consider a client’s right to
counsel of their choice, the attorney's interest in representing a client, the
financial burden on the client if required to replace disqualified counsel and
the potential that tactical abuse underlays the disqualification proceeding. In
re Complex Asbestos Litigation (Ct. App. 1991) 232 Cal. App. 3d 572, 586. The
complaining party must have or must have had an attorney-client relationship
with that attorney. Great Lakes Constr., Inc. v. Burman (2010) 186 Cal.
App. 4th 1347, 1356. When no attorney-client relationship exists, mere exposure
to the confidences of an adversary does not warrant disqualification. Oaks Mgmt.
Corp. v. Superior Court (2006) 145 Cal.App.4th 453, 467. A nonclient party
seeking disqualification of an attorney must show harm arising from a legally
cognizable interest which is concrete and particularized, not hypothetical. Great
Lakes, supra. 
Plaintiff
argues she formerly retained Barry Silbermann as advisory counsel and shared
confidential information with him. Plaintiff alleges Silbermann subsequently began
representing defendant Kelly Day in an unrelated criminal matter, during which
Silbermann shared plaintiff’s confidential information with Day and defendants’
legal counsel. Plaintiff asserts Silbermann acted intentionally, with the goal
of blackmailing or coercing plaintiff into dismissing her case. Plaintiff
argues all of defendants’ counsel have been implicated by Silbermann’s alleged
misconduct, so must be disqualified. 
Defendants
argue plaintiff failed to provide admissible evidence and failed to establish an
attorney-client relationship between plaintiff and any counsel, other than
Silbermann. See Great Lakes Constr., Inc., supra. Defendants proffer
declarations of counsel Harmeling, Quintairos partner Halm and counsel Zeetser,
who represents defendant Day, declaring they have not conspired with or against
Silbermann. See Decl. Harmeling para. 7; decl. Halm para. 7; decl.
Zeetser para. 8. Further, Harmeling and Halm had no communications of any kind
with Silbermann. See Decls. Harmeling and Halm.
Plaintiff
must establish harm to warrant disqualification of counsel with whom she never
had an attorney-client relationship. Hypothetical harm is insufficient to
warrant the severe step of disqualifying defendants’ counsel. Plaintiff’s
allegations of blackmail and coercion lack evidentiary support. Similarly,
plaintiff failed to establish that Silbermann had contact with defendant Day’s
current counsel, who substituted into the case 10/30/24. Absent evidence of any
wrongdoing or conspiracy, there is no basis to disqualify counsel. DENIED.
Defendant Chateau Colline Homeowners
Association’s Motions for Terminating Sanctions 
Where
a party willfully disobeys a discovery order, courts have discretion to impose
terminating, issue, evidentiary or monetary sanctions. E.g., Code Civ. Proc.
§§2023.010(g), 2030.290(c); R.S. Creative, Inc. v. Creative Cotton, Ltd.
(1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 486, 495. Terminating sanctions are authorized where the
evidence shows less severe sanctions will not be successful in compelling
responses. Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 262,
279-280. Courts may require financial reimbursement for expenses incurred as to
misuse of the discovery process. Code Civ. Proc., §2023.030; Deyo v.
Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771, 789, superseded by statute on another
ground as stated in Guzman v. General Motors Corp. (1984) 154 Cal.App.3d
438, 444; In re Marriage of Niklas (1989) 211 Cal.App.3d 28, 37. 
Chateau
served form interrogatories, special interrogatories and request for production
on plaintiffs on 9/6/23 and 9/7/23. Min. Order 9/5/24. May Doe served responses
10/16/23; Jane Doe failed to respond. Id. The court ordered further
responses from both plaintiffs and awarded sanctions of $1,867.26. Id.
Chateau moves for terminating sanctions, as further responses were never
produced. Decls. Partida paras. 3-5. Chateau seeks $1,050 in additional
sanctions.  
Plaintiffs
argue the failure to produce responses was not willful, and they will have
complied with the orders before the hearing on the instant matter. Plaintiffs
argue withdrawal of previous counsel Martinez-Senftner delayed production.
Decl. Martinez-Senftner paras. 4-6. Plaintiffs intended to serve responses
prior to the original 12/5/24 hearing date on this matter. Decl. Doe para. 4.
Terminating
sanctions are a drastic measure to be employed sparingly. Deyo, supra.
Plaintiffs provided evidence the failure to comply was not willful and will have
been rectified prior to the hearing. This is sufficient to survive the motion
for terminating sanctions. However, Chateau is entitled to sanctions for
expenses incurred by bringing this motion. Id.; R.S. Creative, Inc.,
supra. Chateau incurred fees at $220/hour for 6 hours plus $60 in costs,
totaling $1,320 and seeks $1,050, which is reasonable. Decl. Parida para. 6. 
Motion
DENIED, assuming all proper, verified responses have been provided prior to the
hearing date on this motion; sanctions awarded as above, payable within 30
days. The court also requires proof of payment of the previously-awarded
sanctions. The court will consider terminating sanctions, if plaintiffs disobey
this or future court orders.
