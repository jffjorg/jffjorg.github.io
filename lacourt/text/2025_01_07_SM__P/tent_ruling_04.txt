Defendant Matthew Green’s Demurrer
to the FAC
“The
function of a demurrer is to test the sufficiency of the complaint as a matter
of law.” Holiday Matinee, Inc. v. Rambus, Inc. (2004) 118 Cal.App.4th
1413, 1420. A complaint “is sufficient if it alleges ultimate rather than
evidentiary facts,” Doe v. City of Los Angeles (2007) 42 Cal.4th 531,
550, but plaintiff must allege essential facts “with reasonable precision and
with particularity sufficient to acquaint [the] defendant with the nature,
source and extent” of the plaintiff’s claim. Doheny Park Terrace Homeowners
Ass’n., Inc. v. Truck Ins. Exchange (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 1076, 1099.
Defendant
demurs to the first and second causes of action for trespass and conversion on
the grounds plaintiff fails to state sufficient facts. Defendant argues the
court, in a separate matter, ruled plaintiff was unlawfully in possession of the
property owned by the parties’ parents. Defendant argues plaintiff’s claims
arise from defendant’s actions when effectuating a lockout of plaintiff from
the property. Defendant argues his actions were permitted by court order, so
cannot constitute the basis for claims against him. 
Whether
defendant was acting within his rights is a question of fact not appropriate upon
demurrer; the only relevant consideration on demurrer is whether plaintiff’s
allegations, which must be accepted as true at the demurrer stage, constitute a
cause of action. 
Additionally,
questions of fact remain as to whether the court’s lockout order against
plaintiff empowered defendant to take personal action.
To
establish a claim for trespass, plaintiff must allege occupation, intentional
entry to the property, lack of permission, actual harm and that the intentional
entry was a substantial factor in causing the harm. CACI 2000. Plaintiff
alleges defendant, alongside defendant Catriel, hopped the fence to open the
door to allow the police to enter the property. FAC paras. 17-18. Plaintiff
alleges she was occupying the property at the time. FAC paras. 14, 25.
Plaintiff alleged defendant acted without her permission. FAC paras. 17-18. Plaintiff
alleged personal and material harm. FAC paras. 20, 24, 29, 32-33. Plaintiff
sufficiently pled the elements of trespass. 
To
establish a claim for conversion, plaintiff must establish she owned personal
property, defendant interfered with the property by taking possession of it,
plaintiff did not consent to said possession, plaintiff was harmed, and
defendant’s conduct was a substantial factor. CACI 2100. Plaintiff alleged she
had multiple pieces of personal property at the residence. FAC para. 25.
Plaintiff alleged defendant interfered with her property by taking possession
of the residence without consent. FAC paras. 25, 30, 33. Plaintiff alleged
defendant’s actions caused physical and financial harm. FAC paras. 1-37.
Plaintiff sufficiently pled the elements of conversion.
Defendant’s
arguments that the court previously already found plaintiff had no possessory
interest in the property at issue are relevant, but are improper at the
demurrer stage. Plaintiff alleged a possessory interest in the property; this
is sufficient to sustain a claim upon demurrer. Whether that interest is
tortious, as argued by defendant per Veiseh v. Srapp (2019) 35
Cal.App.5th 1099, 1106 is a question of fact the court cannot determine upon
demurrer. OVERRULED. Defendant to answer within 10 court days.
