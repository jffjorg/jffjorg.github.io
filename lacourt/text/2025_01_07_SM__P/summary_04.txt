And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Green v. Green (Case No. 23SMCV04006). The plaintiff, Paula R. Green, is suing the defendants, including Matthew Green, Robert Green, Alan Gutman, and others, for trespass, conversion, and fraud related to their actions in removing her from property owned by her parents. The defendants, including Matthew Green, have filed a demurrer to the plaintiff's complaint, arguing that it does not state sufficient facts to support the claims.

The court has denied the demurrer, finding that the plaintiff has sufficiently pled the elements of trespass and conversion. The court has also granted Matthew Green's request for judicial notice of 15 documents, orders, and filings related to the case.

The court has further ruled that questions of fact remain as to whether the court's lockout order against the plaintiff empowered the defendant to take personal action. The court has also noted that the defendant's arguments that the court previously found the plaintiff had no possessory interest in the property are relevant, but are improper at the demurrer stage.

The defendant is ordered to answer the complaint within 10 court days.
