Wainer v. Ota, Case no. 24SMCV01939
Hearing date January 7, 2024
Defendant
Ota’s Special Motion to Strike under CCP §425.16
Plaintiff
Martin Wainer, in pro per, sues defendant Frank Ota, also in pro per, for
wrongful eviction, breach of lease and harassment arising from defendant’s
alleged interference with plaintiff’s lease. Plaintiff’s allegations include
tampering with utilities, making threats and illegally serving eviction
notices. Defendant moves to strike all causes of action, arguing they arise
from protected activity. Plaintiff opposes.
In
ruling on an anti-SLAPP motion, a trial court uses a “summary-judgment-like
procedure at any early stage of the litigation.” Varian Medical Systems,
Inc. v. Delfino (2005) 35 Cal.4th 180, 192. This two-step process first
requires defendant to show the acts of which plaintiff complains were taken “in
furtherance of the [defendant]’s right of petition or free speech.” Code Civ.
Proc. §425.16(b)(1). If defendant carries that burden, the burden shifts to
plaintiff to demonstrate a probability of prevailing on the claim. Code Civ.
Proc. §425.16(b)(3). In making both determinations, the trial court considers
“the pleadings and supporting and opposing affidavits stating the facts upon
which the liability or defense is based.” Code Civ. Proc. §425.16(b)(2); Equilon
Enterprises v. Consumer Cause (2002) 29 Cal.4th 53, 67. A court does not
weigh credibility or the comparative strength of the evidence – the court considers
a defendant’s evidence to determine if it defeats a plaintiff’s showing as a
matter of law. Soukup v. Law Office of Herbert Hafif (2006) 39 Cal.4th
260, 291. 
Plaintiff
argues defendant’s motion is untimely and procedurally deficient. Plaintiff
argues defendant was served 7/15/24 and filed the instant motion 11/21/24, 129
days later; Code Civ. Proc. §425.16(f) sets a 60-day limit for the filing of an
anti-SLAPP motion following service. Id. Plaintiff also argues
defendant’s motion is procedurally defective because service was not completed,
despite defendant's proof of service indicating otherwise, so plaintiff had
insufficient time to respond. 
On
9/30/24, the court granted plaintiff leave to file the FAC, which included two
new causes of action. Defendant’s motion was filed 52 days later, within the
statutory time limit. This is sufficient, considering plaintiff’s additional
allegations. The court granted plaintiff’s ex parte to continue the hearing date
so plaintiff could file an amended opposition. See Min. Order 12/4/24.
Plaintiff filed the amended opposition on 12/23/24. Any risk of prejudice due
to improper service was addressed.
Defendant
argues plaintiff’s claims arise out of protected activity -- the notice to quit
served on plaintiff and its contents. Defendant argues the content of a notice
to quit constitutes protected speech. Birkner v. Lam (2007) 156
Cal.App.4th 275, 281. Defendant argues the burden is therefore shifted onto
plaintiff to demonstrate probability of success. Defendant argues plaintiff
cannot show a probability of success, as the filing of an unlawful detainer
action and its component actions is protected via litigation privilege. Feldman
v. 1100 Park Lane Assoc. (2008) 160 Cal.App.4th 1467, 1479. 
Plaintiff
argues under Birkner, supra, and Flatley v. Mauro (2006)
39 Cal.App.4th 299 that illegal activity is not covered under anti-SLAPP laws.
Plaintiff alleged 14 distinct illegal acts by defendant. Plaintiff argues
defendant failed to shift the burden or demonstrate the alleged illegal actions
were in fact legal. 
Defendant
failed to include affidavits or other evidence in support of the motion challenging
plaintiff’s allegations of illegality. Per Soukup, supra,
defendant failed to shift the burden. DENIED.
