Rowley v. James, Case no. 21SMCV00336
Hearing date January 7, 2025
Defendant’s
Motion for Stay of Proceedings
Defendant
James moves for a stay of proceedings, arguing the court has yet to enter a
final judgment, and defendant has multiple motions that could affect the
outcome of the case pending. Defendant filed the instant motion 9/24/24. Since
that date the court ruled on defendant’s motions for reconsideration, to deem
admission and to vacate summary judgment. The court denied defendant’s motions,
and no further motions are pending. 
Per
CRC 3.515(f) the court considers “whether the stay will promote the ends of
justice, considering the imminence of any trial or other proceeding that might
materially affect the status of the action to be stayed.” Id. Courts
have the discretion to stay proceedings when it serves judicial economy and
avoids unnecessary hardship on the parties. Landis v. North American Co.
(1936) 299 U.S. 248, 254. 
There
is no legal basis to stay the instant action. The motions defendant references have
all been heard and denied. A stay would not promote judicial economy and would
unnecessarily extend litigation. DENIED.
