And here is a summary in plain English text:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge regarding a motion filed by defendant James to stay proceedings in the case of Rowley v. James. James argues that the court has yet to enter a final judgment and that pending motions may affect the outcome of the case, and therefore, a stay would be necessary to promote judicial economy and avoid unnecessary hardship. However, the judge finds that there is no legal basis to grant the motion, as all of James' pending motions have already been heard and denied. The judge denies the motion, stating that a stay would not promote judicial economy and would only extend the litigation.
