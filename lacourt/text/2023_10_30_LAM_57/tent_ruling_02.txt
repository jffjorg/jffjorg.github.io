 Case Number:  21STCV31578    Hearing Date:   October 30, 2023    Dept:  57 Pending before the Court is Verizon's motion to compel the Church to provide further responses to Verizon's Request for Production of Documents Set One.  The Court is granting Verizon's motion.Verizon’s RFP Nos. 1-26 seek documents related to specific allegations set
forth in the Church’s Cross-Complaint. (Cross-Compl., ¶¶ 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18,
4
19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, Ex. B.) Nos. 27-34 seek documents related to the Lease and
Property. In particular, No. 34 seeks documents related to the Church’s affirmative
defenses to Verizon’s Complaint. Verizon seeks an order compelling the Church to
withdraw the following objection, set forth in bold herein, and provide further responses to Nos. 1-34 omitting the objection:Responding Party objections [sic] to this Request because the
electronically-stored information from the time period demanded is from a
source that is not reasonably accessible without undue burden and
expense, as such Responding Party’s electronically-stored mails and text
messages have not been searched.
(Kiesling Decl., ¶ 3, Ex. 4.) The Church frames the issue as “whether the Church has produced all
ESI/metadata for documents responsive to Verizon's Request for Production of
Documents, Set One, Nos. 1-34.” (Opp’n, 3.) However, as Verizon points out in its Reply,
the issue is whether the Church has justified its objection based on “undue burden and
expense” and its corresponding refusal to search its ESI for emails and text messages.
The Church does not address this issue in its Opposition and filed no Separate Statement
in response. The Church thus necessarily failed to meet its burden. The Court is granting
Verizon’s Motion and directs the Church to search its ESI for emails and text messages
and serve further responses accordingly. Finding that the Church's position has substantial justification, the Court declines to impose a monetary sanction against the Church.
