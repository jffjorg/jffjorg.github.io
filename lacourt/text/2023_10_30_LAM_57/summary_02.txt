And here is a summary in English text of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has granted Verizon's motion to compel the Church to provide further responses to their Request for Production of Documents Set One. The Church had objected to the request, claiming that searching their electronically-stored information from a certain time period would be an undue burden and expense. However, the Church failed to justify this objection and did not search their ESI for emails and text messages. The Court has therefore ordered the Church to search their ESI and serve further responses accordingly. Despite the Church's failure to meet its burden, the Court has declined to impose a monetary sanction against them.
