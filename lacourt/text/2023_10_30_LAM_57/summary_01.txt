And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the Suleminians' motion to disqualify the law firm of McMurry Henriks, LLP from representing both International Vintage Watch Company (IVWC) and the individual Defendants, Jack Abramov and Ronen Cohen. The Suleminians, who are minority shareholders of IVWC, claim that the Firm's representation of both sides creates a conflict of interest. The Judge has denied the motion, finding that the Suleminians lack standing to seek disqualification of counsel. The Judge also distinguished the Suleminians' case from previous cases in which courts have ordered disqualification of counsel, citing a lack of a derivative nature to the Suleminians' claims against IVWC.
