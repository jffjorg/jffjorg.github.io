 Case No.: 
  22STCV17241 
 
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  July 9, 2024



 
Plaintiff
Toyota Industries Commercial Finance, Inc.’s unopposed motion to amend
the judgment entered on August 25, 2023, is granted.
 
          Plaintiff
Toyota Industries Commercial Finance, Inc. (“Toyota”) (“Plaintiff”) moves unopposed
for this Court to amend the judgment in this matter entered on August 25, 2023,
against Defendants Kil H Choi aka Kil Han Choi and Air Boy Express, Inc. (collectively “Defendants”) to remove
the name of Air Boy Express, Inc., erroneously included in the Judgment as a
Plaintiff on line 5.  (Notice of Motion,
pg. 1; C.C.P. §473(d).)
 
Background
On August 25, 2023, the court granted Plaintiff’s
default judgment against Defendants.  Plaintiff
filed multiple default judgment packets to the Court, which necessitated this
Court’s line edit to include the name of Air Boy Express, Inc. on
the judgment listing Kil H Choi aka Kil Han Choi according to the one judgment
rule.  However, this Court erroneously
entered the name of Air Boy Express, Inc. as a Plaintiff instead of as a
Defendant.
Plaintiff filed the instant motion on March
13, 2024.  As of the date of this hearing
no opposition has been filed.
 
Motion to Amend Judgment
Legal Standard
Once a judgment is entered, trial courts
lose jurisdiction to set aside or amend the judgment except in accordance with
statutory procedures.  (APRI
Insurance Co. v. Superior Court (1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 176, 182; Rochin
v. Pat
Johnson Manufacturing Co. (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 1228, 1238).  However, “[t]he court may, upon motion of the
injured party, or its own motion, correct clerical mistakes in its judgment or
orders as entered, so as to conform to the judgment or order directed, and may,
on motion of either party after notice to the other party, set aside any void
judgment or order.” (C.C.P. §473(d).)
 
          Discussion
           Plaintiff’s
motion to amend the clerical error in the judgment to remove the name of Air
Boy Express, Inc. from line 5 as a Plaintiff and include the name of
Air Boy Express, Inc. as a Defendant is granted.  Here, the Court made an error by placing the
name of Air Boy Express, Inc. on the
Judgment in the wrong location.
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s unopposed
motion is granted.
 
Conclusion
Plaintiff’s unopposed motion to amend the judgment to
remove the clerical error listing Defendant Air Boy Express, Inc. as a Plaintiff and add the name Air Boy Express,
Inc. as a Defendant is granted.  
Moving Party to give notice.
