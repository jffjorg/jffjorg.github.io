[1] The Court notes a demurrer and a motion to strike
must be filed as two separate documents and not combined as a single omnibus
filing (however, the documents can be filed simultaneously for a hearing on the
same day).  Defendant filed its demurrer
and motion to strike as a single omnibus filing, which is improper.
 


[2] The Court notes Plaintiff’s two filed oppositions are
improperly noted on the instant docket as “Memorandum of Points and Authorities.”
The filings are not labeled as oppositions to Defendant’s respective
motions.  Plaintiff is advised to look
into this filing error and make appropriate changes before filing new documents
with the Court.
