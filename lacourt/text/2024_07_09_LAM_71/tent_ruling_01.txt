          Request

          Plaintiff’s
7/1/24 request for judicial notice of (1) The December 22, 2020, United States
District Court Northern District of California Order on Motion for Attorney
Fees and Costs in Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Inc. v. Center for
Medical Progress, (N.D. Cal., Dec. 22, 2020, No. 16-cv-00236-
WHO); and (2) The April 7, 2011, United
States District Court Northern District of California Order Granting in Part
and Denying in Part Plaintiff’s Motion for Attorneys’ Fees and Costs in Stonebrae,
L.P. v. Toll Bros., Inc. (N.D. Cal., Apr. 7, 2011, No. C-08-0221 EMC), at
*23 aff’d 521 Fed.Appx. 592 (9th Cir. 2013)
is denied as not relevant.
 
Background
This is a FEHA case involving
claims of disability discrimination, failure to accommodate, retaliation, and
failure to engage in the interactive process, violations of the Labor Code,
interference with the California Family Rights Act (“CFRA”), and a cause of
action under PAGA (C.C.P. §1021.5).  This
matter came on regularly for a jury trial from February 5, 2024, to February
20, 2024.  On February 20, 2024, the jury
returned a special verdict in favor of Plaintiff, awarding him $915,281.00 in
damages.  Judgment was entered on March 20,
2024.  
On
March 27, 2024, Plaintiff filed his memorandum of costs.  On April 16, 2024, Plaintiff filed an amended
memorandum of costs.  On May 22, 2024,
Plaintiff filed this motion for attorneys’ fees.  Defendant filed its opposition on June 25,
2024.  Plaintiff filed his reply on July 1,
2024.  
 
Discussion
FEHA provides that the “court, in its
discretion may award to the prevailing party. . . reasonable attorney fees.”  (Govt. Code §12965(c)(6).)  
Here, Plaintiff is the prevailing party
because he prevailed on his FEHA causes of action.  Defendant does not contest that Plaintiff is
the prevailing party in its opposition, rather Defendant argues an award of
attorneys’ fees under FEHA is discretionary, not mandatory, and Plaintiff’s
requested fees should be reduced because Plaintiff’s counsel did not meet its
burden of establishing the reasonability of fees requested.  For the purpose of this motion, Plaintiff is
regarded as the prevailing party and is therefore entitled to attorneys’ fees
pursuant to Government Code §12965(c)(6).
 
Reasonable
Fees
To calculate
a lodestar amount, the Court must first determine the reasonableness of the
hourly rates sought by the Plaintiff’s counsel.  The Supreme Court of California has concluded
that a reasonable hourly lodestar rate is the prevailing rate for private
attorneys “conducting non-contingent litigation of the same type.”  (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th
1122, 1133, emphasis added.)
The
attorneys of Horton Law Firm, APC, declare the following hourly rates: (a) Laura
L. Horton ($950 per hour); (b) Flor C. Dery ($525 per hour); and (c) Meriah
Prendergast (paralegal, $125 per hour).  (Decl.
of Horton ¶¶29-30; Decl. of Dery ¶13.)  These
rates are appropriate given the attorneys’ relative experiences and
qualifications.  (See id.)  Plaintiff has sufficiently demonstrated his
counsel’s hourly rates are reasonable in their community of practice in their
specialized area of law.
Defendant challenges
Plaintiff’s counsel’s hourly rates as unreasonable but Defendant’s argument is
unavailing.  (Opposition, pgs. 12-17.)  The Court finds Plaintiff’s counsel’s rates
to be reasonable in their community of practice and do not warrant reductions.
 
Billed
Hours
The party
seeking fees and costs bears the burden to show “the fees incurred were
allowable, were reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation, and were
reasonable in amount.”  (Nightingale
v. Hyundai Motor America (1994) 31 Cal.App.4th 99, 104.) 
“The court’s
discretion in awarding attorney fees is, initially (‘absent circumstances
rendering the award unjust’), to be exercised so as to fully compensate counsel
for the prevailing party for services reasonably provided to his or her client.
The basis for the trial court’s calculation must be the actual hours counsel
has devoted to the case, less those that result from inefficient or duplicative
use of time.  [Citation.]  Then the court must adjust the resulting fee
to fulfill the statutory purpose of bringing ‘the financial incentives for
attorneys enforcing important constitutional rights . . . into line with
incentives they have to undertake claims for which they are paid on a
fee-for-service basis.’”  (Horsford
v. Board of Trustees of California State University (2005) 132
Cal.App.4th 359, 395.)
Plaintiff’s counsel’s
fee recovery is based on 1,592 hours spent litigating this case ($1,161,647.50).
 (Decl. of Horsford ¶¶19-20, Exhs. B, C.)
 Plaintiff’s counsel declares the
following hours incurred: (a) Laura L. Horton (773.1 hours or $734,445.00); (b)
Flor C. Dery (812.1 hours or $426,352.50); and (c) Mariah Prendergast (6.8
hours or $850.00).  (Decl. of Horsford
¶20, Exh. C.)  Defendant argues Plaintiffs’
counsel’s billed hours were not reasonably incurred because they were
double-billed and inflated.  (Opposition,
pgs. 9-12.)  Defendant’s objections to
Plaintiff’s counsel’s billed hours are not well taken.
Defendant’s
argument that the work performed by two attorneys at trial, depositions, or
hearing was duplicative or unreasonable is unsupported by case law.  (See Margolin
v. Regional Planning Commission (1982) 134 Cal. App. 3d 999, 1007.) To show
unreasonable duplication, fee opponents must provide “specific evidence that
plaintiffs’ hours were duplicative or inefficient”; generalized objections that
the work is “excessive” or “duplicative” do not satisfy that burden.  (Hadley
v. Krepel (1985) 167 Cal.App.3d 677, 684.)
Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s request for attorneys’ fees is granted in the amount of $1,196,687.50.
 
Final
Lodestar Determination
The Court denies
Plaintiff’s request for lodestar multiplier of 1.75.  Plaintiff’s counsel’s rates already take into
account the risks associated with contingent risk and the preclusion of other
work, and the instant case did not pose exceptional difficulty compared to
similar FEHA litigation brought before this Court.
 
Costs
Any effort to tax
or strike costs must occur in the form of a motion to strike or to tax costs
and must be served and filed fifteen (15) days after service of the cost
memorandum.  (CRC, Rule 3.1700(b)(1).)  After the 15-day deadline to file a motion to
tax costs has passed, the Court clerk must immediately enter the costs. (CRC,
Rule 3.1700(b)(4).)
Plaintiff
submitted his cost memorandum on March 27, 2024, and then filed an amended
memorandum of costs on April 16, 2024.  Defendant failed to submit a motion to tax
costs within the 15-day deadline. 
Therefore, Defendant’s objections to Plaintiff’s costs must be denied.  (CRC, Rule
3.1700(b)(4).)
Plaintiff requests
an additional $5,820.75 that was not included in the amended memorandum of
costs for expert fees incurred by Richard M. Pearl in support of the instant
motion.  (See Supp.-Decl. of
Horsford ¶8, Exh. D.)  Such fees are also
recoverable by Plaintiff as expert fees. 
(Gov. Code §12965(c)(6).)
Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s costs are granted in the total amount of $73,205.76, comprised of $67,385.01
in the amended memorandum of costs and $5,820.75 in expert fees incurred on the
instant motion.
 
Conclusion
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s request
for attorneys’ fees and costs is granted in the reduced total of $1,269,893.26, comprised of $1,196.687.50 in attorneys’ fees and $73,205.76
in costs.
Moving Party to give notice.
