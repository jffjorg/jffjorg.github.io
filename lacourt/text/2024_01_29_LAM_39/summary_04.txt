The judge is issuing a tentative ruling that the hearing scheduled for January 29, 2024, will be continued, and the parties should not appear on Monday. The judge is advancing and continuing the hearing on the defendant's motion for summary judgment and the case management conference to February 20, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. The reason for the continuance is that the judge will be unavailable on September 29, 2024, due to an ongoing jury trial in another case. The court clerk will provide notice and file proof of the new hearing date with the court.
