  Case Number:  20STCV20878    Hearing Date:   January 29, 2024    Dept:  39 Ronald S. Carvel
v. Ford Motor Company, et al.
Case No.
20STCV20878
Motion for
Reconsideration
 
            Plaintiff
Ronald S. Carvel (“Plaintiff”) filed this case under the Song-Beverly Consumer
Warranty Act against Ford Motor Company (“Defendant”).  The Court granted a motion to compel
arbitration on July 21, 2021, based upon Felisilda v. FCA US LLC (2020) 53
Cal.App.5th 486.  At the time, the Court
was required to follow that precedent. 
Then, on April 4, 2023, the Second District decided Ocha v. Ford Motor
Company (2023) 89 Cal.App.5th 1324, which rejected the holding in
Felisilda.  Now, Plaintiff seeks reconsideration
of the Court’s decision to grant the motion for reconsideration.
 
            The Court
denies the motion for two reasons. 
First, the motion was served on Defendant’s former counsel, so service
was not effective.  Second, Plaintiff
waited over ten months after the Second District’s decision in Ochoa to seek
reconsideration.  As such, the motion is
untimely.  
 
            Based upon
the foregoing, the Court orders as follows:
 
            1.         Plaintiff’s motion for reconsideration
is denied.
 
            2.         Plaintiff’s counsel shall provide
notice and file proof of such with the Court.
