And here is the English-text summary:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling denying the Plaintiff's motion for reconsideration of the Court's decision to grant the motion to compel arbitration. The Plaintiff, Ronald S. Carvel, had filed a motion to compel arbitration against Ford Motor Company, citing the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act. The Court granted the motion in July 2021, following the precedent set in Felisilda v. FCA US LLC. However, in April 2023, the Second District decided Ocha v. Ford Motor Company, which rejected the holding in Felisilda. The Plaintiff is now seeking reconsideration of the Court's decision.

The Court denies the motion for two reasons: first, the motion was served on the Defendant's former counsel, making the service ineffective. Second, the Plaintiff waited over ten months after the Second District's decision in Ocha to seek reconsideration, making the motion untimely. The Court orders that the Plaintiff's motion for reconsideration is denied and that the Plaintiff's counsel must provide notice and file proof of such with the Court.
