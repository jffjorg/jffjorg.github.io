**English Text Summarizing the Judge's Tentative Ruling**

The judge's tentative ruling grants Plaintiff Tonia Flores's motion to compel further responses to form interrogatory set three, no. 17.1, which corresponds with her requests for admission. The Court finds that Defendant Safeco Insurance Company of America's responses to the form interrogatory are evasive and nonresponsive, and therefore grants the motion. Additionally, the Court awards Plaintiff sanctions in the reduced amount of $1,810 due to Safeco Insurance Company of America's willful refusal to meet and confer and evasive objections. The Court reduces the hours spent by Plaintiff's counsel on the motion from 6.75 to 5 hours, resulting in a reduced sanctions amount.
