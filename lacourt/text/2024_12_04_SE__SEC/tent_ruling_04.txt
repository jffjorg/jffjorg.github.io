TENTATIVE ORDER
Defendant Cerritos Gardens, LLC’s motion for terminating
sanctions is GRANTED. Plaintiff Felicia Rhodes’s case is DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.
 
Moving party(s) to give notice. 
 
Cerritos Gardens, LLC (Defendant) moves this Court for an
order for terminating sanctions against pro per plaintiff Felicia Rhodes
(Plaintiff).
 
Background
This is a wrongful eviction action. On October 31, 2022,
Plaintiff filed a complaint against Defendant alleging wrongful eviction and
fraud.
 
Legal Standard
 
If a party fails to comply with a court order compelling
discovery responses or attendance at a deposition, the court may impose
monetary, issue, evidence, or terminating sanctions. (Code of Civil Procedure §§
2023.010 subd. (g); 2030.290 subd. (c); 2023.030; R.S. Creative, Inc. v.
Creative Cotton, Ltd. (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 486, 495.) Ultimate discovery
sanctions are justified where there is a willful discovery order violation, a
history of abuse, and evidence showing that less severe sanctions would not
produce compliance with discovery rules. (Van Sickle v. Gilbert (2011)
196 Cal.App.4th 1495, 1516.) “[A] penalty as severe as dismissal or default is
not authorized where noncompliance with discovery is caused by an inability to
comply rather than willfulness or bad faith.” (Brown v. Sup. Ct. (1986)
180 Cal.App.3d 701, 707.) 
 
Under Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030 subd. (d),
“The court may impose a terminating sanction by one of the following orders: 
(1) An order striking out the
pleadings or parts of the pleadings of any party engaging in the misuse of the
discovery process.
(2) An order staying further
proceedings by that party until an order for discovery is obeyed.
(3) An order dismissing the action,
or any part of the action, of that party.
(4) An order rendering a judgment
by default against that party.”
 
“The trial court may order a terminating sanction for
discovery abuse ‘after considering the totality of the circumstances: [the]
conduct of the party to determine if the actions were willful; the detriment to
the propounding party; and the number of formal and informal attempts to obtain
the discovery.’” (Los Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th
377, 390, quoting Lang v. Hochman (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246.) 
 
Discussion
 
Defendant moves the Court for an order of terminating
sanctions against Plaintiff. Defendant seeks dismissal of Plaintiff’s complaint
with prejudice. 
 
Here, ultimate discovery sanctions are justified. Defendant
has provided a timeline of the discovery process in the instant matter. First, Plaintiff
failed to respond to Defendant’s form interrogatories, set one, and requests
for admission. (Mallon Decl., ¶ 4.) Then, Plaintiff did not appear for the
motion to compel hearings on October 19, 2023. (Mallon Decl., ¶ 6.) Defendant
then served an amended notice of deposition, set for November 20, 2023, to which
Plaintiff failed to appear. (Mallon Decl., ¶ 8.) On April 10, 2024, the Court
heard Defendant’s unopposed motion to compel the deposition of Plaintiff and
ordered the deposition happen within 30 days. (Mallon Decl. ¶ 11.) Defendant
properly noticed Plaintiff’s deposition to take place on May 7, 2024. (Mallon
Decl. ¶ 12.) Plaintiff failed to appear. (Mallon Decl. ¶ 12.) 
 
Within this timeframe, it is clear Plaintiff has engaged in
multiple misuses of the discovery process. By ignoring Defendant’s notice of
depositions, Plaintiff failed to respond to an authorized method of discovery.
(See Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.010 subd. (d).) Plaintiff disobeyed the
Court’s April 10, 2024, minute order by failing to appear for the Court-ordered
deposition. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.010 subd. (g).) The failure to
obey the Court order further shows Plaintiff fails to comply with the discovery
process under the Court’s less severe factions. 
Plaintiff has additionally not engaged in any meet and confer process nor
provided her availability for the past depositions. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.010
subd. (i).) “If a plaintiff wishes to avail himself of the California courts,
he owes a duty to comply with its rules, such as the rules of discovery. To
hold otherwise, would permit a litigant to disappear and not be obliged to
comply with our discovery statutes.” (Cornwall v. Santa Monica Dairy Co.,
66 Cal.App.3d 250, 253.) Plaintiff’s failure to comply with the discovery
process, without any appearances or justifications, constitutes a willful violation.
Accordingly, terminating sanctions are warranted. 
 
Defendant’s motion for terminating sanctions against
Plaintiff is GRANTED. Plaintiff’s case is DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.
