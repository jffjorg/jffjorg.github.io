Summary:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for summary adjudication as to the second cause of action for disgorgement. The plaintiff alleged that the defendants, H-T General Engineering, Inc. and its employees, were unlicensed contractors who failed to complete the construction of a single-family residence on the plaintiff's property. The plaintiff paid the defendants $694,578 to date, but the defendants did not provide a valid license or proof of insurance. The judge found that the plaintiff established that the defendants were unlicensed contractors and that the plaintiff's payments were made directly to the defendants, rather than through a subcontract. The judge also found that the defendants did not provide sufficient evidence to raise a triable issue of material fact regarding whether the defendants improperly performed tasks outside the scope of their license. Therefore, the court granted the plaintiff's motion for summary adjudication as to the disgorgement cause of action.
