TENTATIVE ORDER
 
Defendants Cedarlane Natural Foods, Inc. and Camerino
Perez Pinzon’s motion for consolidation is GRANTED. Case no. 23NWCV00320 is
deemed the lead case.
 
Moving party to give notice. 
 
Defendants Cedarlane Natural Foods, Inc. and Camerino Perez
Pinzon (Defendants) move for an order consolidating the instant case, case no. 23NWCV00320,
with Lava Ghimire, et al., v. Camerino Perez Pinzon, et al., case no. 24NWCV01964.
 
Background
 
This consolidation action concerns two actions that arise
from the same motor vehicle incident. In the instant action, on January 30,
2023, Nani Gita Kanel (Plaintiff) filed a complaint against Defendants alleging
(1) negligence, (2) negligence per se, (3) negligent entrustment, and (4)
negligent hiring, supervision, and retention. Plaintiff alleges that on August
16, 2022, Defendant Pinzon collided with a vehicle in which Plaintiff was a
passenger on Interstate 605 in Los Angeles County. (Complaint, ¶ 1.) At the
time of the collision, Defendant Pinzon was in the scope of employment at
Defendant Cedarlane Natural Foods. (Complaint, ¶ 1.)
 
On August 28, 2024, the Court granted Defendants’ amended
notice of related case regarding case no. 24NWCV01964. On September 10, 2024,
the Court granted Defendants’ ex parte application to continue trial to June 9,
2025. 
 
Defendants now move to consolidate the instant motion with
case no. 24NWCV01964. This motion is unopposed.
 
Legal Standard 
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 1048 subd. (a) provides that
“[w]hen actions involving a common question of law or fact are pending before
the court . . . it may order all the actions consolidated and it may make such
orders concerning proceedings therein as may tend to avoid unnecessary costs or
delay.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1048, subd. (a).) “[T]he lowest numbered case in
the consolidated case is the lead case.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.350(b).)
 
Discussion 
 
Defendants argue good cause exists for consolidating case
no. 23NWCV00320 with case no. 24NWCV01964 because both actions involve common
questions of fact and law, involve similar discovery, and arise out of the same
incident. 
 
The Court finds that case no. 23NWCV00320 and case no. 24NWCV01964
involve common questions of law and fact. Both actions arise out of the same
motor vehicle incident which took place on August 16, 2022. The plaintiffs in
both actions were passengers of the same motor vehicle and allege similar
causes of action against Defendants. Both actions were filed in Norwalk
Courthouse and are currently pending in Department F. The Court finds that
consolidation of both actions will promote judicial economy as both actions
require overlapping discovery and witnesses. 
 
Accordingly, Defendants’ unopposed motion for consolidation
is GRANTED. Case no. 23NWCV00320 is deemed the lead case.
