TENTATIVE ORDER
 
Defendant The Bicycle Casino L.P.’s motion for attorney’s
fees is GRANTED in the amount of $8,010.
 
Moving party to give notice. 
 
Defendant The Bicycle Casino L.P. (TBC) brings this motion
for attorney’s fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16 subd.
(c).
 
Background
 
This is a wrongful death and survival action. On September
27, 2023, Phillip Tirman, individually and as successor in interest to Vanessa
Jung Tirman, (Plaintiff) filed a complaint against TBC. and Parkwest Bicycle
Casino, LLC (Defendants). The complaint alleges causes of action for
intentional infliction of emotional distress and abuse of process. In July of
2022, decedent Vanessa Jung Tirman (Decedent) brought a wrongful death action
against Defendants regarding the death of her brother. (Complaint ¶ 12.) Plaintiff
alleges Defendants intentionally showed Decedent a surveillance video of her
brother’s death during a deposition to prompt her to dismiss the case. (Complaint
¶¶ 17-19.) On August 16, 2023, Decedent commit suicide. (Complaint ¶ 28.)
 
On November 8, 2023, Defendant Parkwest filed its special
motion to strike pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16 (Anti-SLAPP
motion). On December 1, 2023, TBC filed its Anti-SLAPP motion. On December 20,
2023, the Court granted Defendant Parkwest’s Anti-SLAPP motion. On January 3,
2024, the Court granted TBC’s Anti-SLAPP motion. Accordingly, the Court entered
a judgment in favor of Defendants on February 27, 2024.
 
TBC now moves the Court for an order requiring Plaintiff to
pay $8,010 in attorney fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16
subd. (c).
 
Legal Standard
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16 subd. (c)(1)
provides, in part, “a prevailing defendant on a special motion to strike shall
be entitled to recover that defendant’s attorney’s fees and costs.” California
law makes the award of attorney’s fees to a prevailing Anti-SLAPP defendant
mandatory. (See Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1131 (“[u]nder
Code of Civil Procedure §425.16, subdivision (c), any SLAPP defendant who
brings a successful motion to strike is entitled to mandatory attorney’s fees.”).)
 
In determining what fees are reasonable, California courts
apply the “lodestar” approach. (See, e.g., Holguin v. DISH Network LLC
(2014) 229 Cal.App.4th 1310, 1332.) This inquiry “begins with the ‘lodestar,’
i.e., the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable
hourly rate.” (See PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095.)
From there, the “[t]he lodestar figure may then be adjusted, based on
consideration of factors specific to the case, in order to fix the fee at the
fair market value for the legal services provided.” (Ibid.) Relevant
factors include: “(1) the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, (2)
the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the extent to which the nature of
the litigation precluded other employment by the attorneys, [and] (4) the
contingent nature of the fee award.” (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th
1122, 1132.)
 
The trial court has broad authority to determine the amount
of a reasonable fee. (PLCM Group, Inc. v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th
1084, 1095.) The party bears the burden of proof as to “reasonableness” of any
fee claim. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (c)(5).) The party seeking fees
has the burden of documenting the appropriate hours expended and hourly rates. (City
of Colton v. Singletary (2012) 206 Cal.App.4th 751, 784.) This burden
requires competent evidence as to the nature and value of the services
rendered. (Martino v. Denevi (1986) 182 Cal.App.3d 553, 559.)
 
An attorney's testimony as to the number of hours worked is
sufficient evidence to support an award of attorney fees, even in the absence
of detailed time records or billing statements, and there is no requirement
that such records or statements be offered in evidence. (Steiny & Co.,
Inc. v. California Electric Supply Co. (2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 285, 293; see
also Horsford v. Board of Trustees of California State University (2005)
132 Cal.App.4th 359, 396 (“the verified time statements of the attorneys, as officers
of the court, are entitled to credence in the absence of a clear indication the
records are erroneous.”). Ascertaining the fee amount is left to the trial
court’s sound discretion. (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122,
1132.) 
 
Discussion
 
TBC requests attorney’s fees in the total amount of $8,010. To
justify each attorney’s reasonable rate, TBC compares each rate to the
Fitzpatrick Matix and Laffey Matrix, finding each rate is at or below the rates
estimated based on experience. 
 
TBC was represented by Bordin Semmer LP at all times during
this action. (Bordin-Wosk Decl., ¶ 1.) Four attorneys at Bordin Semmer LP worked
on this matter. Defendant provides each of the four attorney’s billing records
on TBC matters. (Bordin-Wosk Decl., Exh. 3.) 
 
Attorney Christopher Blanchard spent 13.7 hours of work on
TBC’s Anti-SLAAP motion and 3.9 hours on the instant motion at a billing rate
of $225 per hour. (Bordin-Wosk Decl., ¶¶ 5, 7.) TBC’s counsel declares that
this rate is reasonable as Mr. Blanchard is Bordin Semmer LP’s of counsel, has
been a practicing attorney since 2005, and is experienced in complex
litigation. (Bordin-Wosk Decl., ¶ 6.)
 
Attorney Bryan Aghakhani spent 8.5 hours of time on TBC’s
Anti-SLAAP motion including reviewing Plaintiff’s opposition, conducting
research, preparing a reply, and attending the hearing. (Bordin-Wosk Decl., ¶ 8.)
Mr. Aghakhani’s billing rate is $225 per hour. (Bordin-Wosk Decl., ¶ 8.) TBC’s
counsel declares that this rate is reasonable because Mr. Aghakhani has
practiced law since 2016, and this rate is lower than market rates for similar
defense-side attorneys. (Bordin-Wosk Decl., ¶¶ 9, 10.)
 
Attorney Tara Alaegha spent 6.9 hours on TBC’s Anti-SLAAP
motion at a rate of $225 per hour, which includes preparing the initial draft. (Bordin-Wosk
Decl., ¶ 11.) TBC’s counsel declares this rate is reasonable as Ms. Alaegha is
an associate who has practiced law since 2022 and has concentrated on law and
motion matters. (Bordin-Wosk Decl., ¶ 12.)
 
Attorney Joshua Bordin-Wosk spent 1.5 hours on TBC’s
Anti-SLAAP motion and 0.6 hours on the instant motion at an hourly rate of $225
per hour. (Bordin-Wosk Decl., ¶ 15.) He declares this rate is reasonable as is
the managing partner of Bordin Semmer LP, has practiced law since 2005, and was
principal point of contact for TBC. (Bordin-Wosk Decl., ¶¶ 14, 15.)
 
Plaintiff submit a joint-opposition to both Defendant
Parkwest and TBC’s motions for attorney’s fees. The Court notes Defendants’
argument in their joint reply that Plaintiff’s opposition is submitted in the
form of a declaration and exceeds the page limit. “No opening or responding
memorandum may exceed 15 pages.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1113(d).) Since
Plaintiff’s opposition jointly responds to both Defendants’ motions for
attorney’s fees, the Court will consider the merits of Plaintiff’s opposition as
it relates to the instant motion for attorney’s fees. The Court need not
rule on Defendants’ objections where the declaration functions as a memorandum.
 
In opposition, Plaintiff argues that Defendants’ fees are
redundant because the work of Defendants were the same and Defendants could
have filed a joinder pleader. Plaintiff argues that Defendants were represented
by the same law firm, Bordin Semmer LP. However, this argument is not correct.
Defendant Parkwest states that it was represented by Umberg Zipser LLP when it
brought the Anti-SLAPP Motion. (Parkwest, Bordin-Wosk Decl., ¶ 2.) Bordin
Semmer LLP, Defendant Parkwest’s current counsel, substituted as counsel after
the initial Motion was filed, but before Plaintiff filed the opposition. (Parkwest,
Bordin-Wosk Decl., ¶ 2.) Each Defendant, therefore, separately filed an
Anti-SLAAP motion. Attorney’s fees are mandatory for any defendant who brings a
successful Anti-SLAAP motion. (See Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th
1122, 1131.) Here, TBC is entitled to recover under Code of Civil Procedure section
425.16 subd. (c)(1) because it successfully brought an Anti-SLAAP motion.
Whether Defendants may have brought a joint Anti-SLAAP motion is immaterial
under the statute. 
 
As to whether the fees are redundant or excessive, the Court
recognizes Anti-SLAAP motions are complex motions requiring skill, time, and
extensive research in an ever-evolving area of law. Here, as outlined above, TBC’s
counsel provided each attorney’s hours worked, experience, and reasons for the
hourly rate. The Court sees that the hours spent on TBC’s Anti-SLAAP motion and
motion for attorney’s fees are generally lower than the hours spent on
Defendant Parkwest’s motions. Defendants argue that this is because TBC’s
counsel was able to use Parkwest’s motions as frameworks. For example, Mr.
Blanchard spent 8.9 hours drafting Defendant Parkwest’s motion for attorney
fees, and 3.9 hours drafting the instant motion for TBC. (See Bordin-Wosk
Bicycle Decl., ¶ 5; Parkwest, Bordin-Wosk Decl., ¶ 21.) The Court finds that
TBC’s evidence is more than enough to substantiate the 37.4 hours spent on the Anti-SLAAP
motion and supporting papers. 
 
As to the reasonableness of the rates, the Court finds such
rates are reasonable based on the experience of each attorney. The attorneys’
rates suggested are at or below the rates estimated via the Laffey Matrix,
adjusted for Los Angeles. The Declaration of Attorney Bordin-Wosk confirms the
reasonableness of such rates for defense attorneys handling commercial
litigation matters in Southern California. The Court may rely on such support
in finding the rates are reasonable. (See Pasternack v. McCullough (2021)
65 Cal.App.5th 1050, 1059 (“The trial court was entitled to rely on [one
attorney’s declaration] to determine the reasonable rates for experienced
attorneys in Los Angeles County.”); see also Syers Properties III, Inc. v.
Rankin (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 691, 702 (holding the trial court properly
relied on the Laffey Matrix as adjusted for the San Francisco-San Jose-Oakland
region to determine reasonableness of attorneys’ rates).) The Court thus finds
that each attorney’s rate is reasonable. 
 
Plaintiff also argues that pursuit of attorney’s fees under
the circumstances of this case are undignified and cruel. However, regardless
of the circumstances of the case, California law makes the award of attorney’s
fees to a prevailing Anti-SLAPP defendant mandatory. (See Ketchum v. Moses (2001)
24 Cal.4th 1122, 1131.) 
 
Plaintiff lastly argues that that the fees were billed to a
non-party, and thus are not recoverable. The Court finds Plaintiff cites no
authority to support that contention, and thus, rejects it. 
 
Accordingly, TBC’s motion for attorney’s fees pursuant to Code
of Civil Procedure section 425.16 subd. (c)(1) is GRANTED in the amount of $8,010.
