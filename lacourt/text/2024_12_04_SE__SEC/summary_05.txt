And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Thomas v. BV Lakewood Carson SE LLC, granting the plaintiff's request to electronically file motions and court documents. The request was made due to the plaintiff's disability, which makes it difficult for her to physically file documents and participate in courtroom proceedings. The court granted the request under California Rules of Court, rule 1.100, which governs requests for accommodations by persons with disabilities. However, the court denied the plaintiff's request for additional communication assistance, as the request did not include a description of the accommodation sought and a statement of the medical condition that necessitates the accommodation, as required by the rule.
