And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion for terminating sanctions against the plaintiff, Felicia Rhodes. As a result, the plaintiff's case is dismissed with prejudice. The plaintiff has failed to comply with the discovery process, including failing to respond to discovery requests, failing to appear for a deposition, and failing to comply with court orders. The judge has found that the plaintiff's actions were willful and that less severe sanctions would not have produced compliance with the discovery rules. The judge has cited various legal precedents to support the decision, including cases that discuss the imposition of terminating sanctions for discovery abuse.
