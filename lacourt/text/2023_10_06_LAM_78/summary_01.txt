Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court is reconsiding its prior ruling on the motion to compel arbitration in favor of Hyundai Motor America. The court finds that the motion is untimely, but it will reconsider the motion under its own authority in light of the recent decision in Ochoa v. Ford Motor Company (2023) 89 Cal.App.5th 1324. The court denies the motion to compel arbitration and remands the matter to the superior court for all further proceedings. The court holds that the manufacturer's warranty is not part of the sales contract and that the arbitration clause in the sales contract only applies to claims arising out of or related to the purchase or condition of the vehicle between the parties who signed the contract. The court also holds that the doctrine of equitable estoppel does not apply in this case.
