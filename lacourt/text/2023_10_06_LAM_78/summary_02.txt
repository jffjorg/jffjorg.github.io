And here is the English text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the Plaintiff's motion to disqualify the Defendant's counsel, John Oh. The motion was denied. The Plaintiff alleged that Oh represented both parties when they purchased the property at issue and drafted the parties' partnership agreement. However, the Defendant argued that Oh was never retained by the Plaintiff, and the evidence showed that Oh was never involved in the transaction that is the subject of this lawsuit with the Plaintiff. The Judge found that there was no evidence that Oh represented the Plaintiff, and therefore, the motion was denied.
