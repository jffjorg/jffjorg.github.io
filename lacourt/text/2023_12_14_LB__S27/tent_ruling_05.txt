 Case Number:  22LBCV00541    Hearing Date:   December 14, 2023    Dept:  S27 1.     Background
Facts
On September 30, 2022, Plaintiff
Kimiko Mizuochi (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendants Spectre,
Inc. (“Spectre”), Atsumi Matsumura (“Matsumura”), and Does 1 to 10, inclusive,
asserting causes of action for (1) breach of contract, (2) promissory fraud,
(3) conversion, (4) violation of Penal Code 496, and (5) common counts. 
The Complaint alleges the
following. Spectre is a California corporation. (Compl., ¶ 2.) On or about
September 22, 2021, Matsumura (acting as Spectre’s Vice President and
authorized agent) contacted Plaintiff to obtain a loan on Spectre’s behalf. (Compl.,
¶ 8.) Matsumura told Plaintiff that the purpose of the loan was to purchase and
resell Coach handbags and promised that Plaintiff would not only receive
interest on the money lent, but also earn commissions on the merchandise bought
and resold using Plaintiff’s funds. (Compl., ¶ 8.) Matsumura further assured
Plaintiff that Spectre would repay all funds loaned within a week to 10 days
after the goods were shipped to Japan. (Compl., ¶ 8.) Matsumura said the
repayment was 120% guaranteed and claimed that Spectre had never had a
non-payment to lenders after the merchandise purchased with loans was resold. (Compl.,
¶ 8.) Before the parties finished preparing and executing their written
contract, Plaintiff received a call from Matsumura on or about October 25,
2021, asking for a loan to purchase items immediately on Spectre’s behalf
because a sales event was starting the next day. (Compl., ¶ 10.) Matsumura
re-promised that Spectre would repay the money and promised there was no risk
of non-payment involved for Plaintiff. (Compl., ¶ 10.) Given those assurances,
on or about October 26, 2021, Plaintiff began loaning money to Spectre to
purchase Coach merchandise for resale in Japan. (Compl., ¶ 11.) Based on
information and belief, Spectre resold the Coach merchandise in Japan in late
2021, but has refused to repay Plaintiff’s loan of $27,464.17 or otherwise
comply with its contractual promises. (Compl., ¶ 14.) In addition to that loan,
the defendants owe Plaintiff $3,730.49 for commission, interest, and late fees
on the unpaid loan. (Compl., ¶ 12.) 
On May 25, 2023, Plaintiff filed a
Request for Entry of Court Judgment Upon Default and Request for Continuance of
Hearing on Default Prove-Up.
On April 12, 2023, the Court held
the Order to Show Cause Re: CCP 585 Default Packet hearing. The Court requested
live testimony and scheduled a Default Prove Up Hearing for May 26, 2023.
            On May 16,
2023, the Court continued the Default Prove Up hearing to June 2, 2023. 
On May 25, 2023, default was
entered against Defendants Spectre and Matsumura. 
On June 2, 2023, the Court
continued the Default Prove Up Hearing to June 16, 2023, pursuant to Plaintiff’s
request. 
On June 16, 2023, the Court entered
the following Minute Order (in relevant part):
Matter comes on for Default prove up
as to defendants Atsumi Matsumura and Spectre, Inc. a California corporation.
Kimiko Mizuochi is sworn and testifies
with the assistance of the Japanese interpreter.
Plaintiff’s exhibit 1 (California
Secretary of State Corporation Statement) is admitted in evidence.
The plaintiff rests.
The Court finds for the plaintiff
and against defendants Atsumi Matsumura and Spectre, Inc. a California
corporation.
The Court will award treble damages
as to Atsumi Matsumura only as fraud and intent have been proven only as to the
individual defendant.
Plaintiff’s counsel to submit proposed
judgment and a declaration re: attorney fees calculation within 10 days.
Exhibit is ordered returned to counsel
for plaintiff to be held until the final resolution of this case.
(Minute Order, dated June 16, 2023, p. 1 [emphasis added].)
Therefore, according to the Minute Order, the Court found in favor of Plaintiff
and against both defendants, Matsumura and Spectre. However, the Court found
that treble damages were only proven against Matsumura and not Spectre. 
On June 23, 2023, Plaintiff filed
the instant motion for reconsideration of the order from the Default Prove Up
Hearing on June 16, 2023. 
On June 28, 2023, Plaintiff filed a
Proposed Final Court Judgment Upon Default, requesting default judgment against
Matsumura only. On June 28, 2023, the Court approved the proposed judgment and entered
a default judgment against Matsumura for $124,797.22, consisting of $111,797.22
for treble damages, $614 costs of suit, and $12,500 attorney’s fees.
            As of
December 12, 2023, no opposition to the motion for reconsideration had been
filed. 
2.     Motion
for Reconsideration
a.    
Legal Standard
            “When an
application for an order has been made to a judge, or to a court, and refused
in whole or in part, or granted, or granted conditionally, or on terms, any
party affected by the order may, within 10 days after service upon the party of
written notice of entry of the order and based upon new or different facts,
circumstances, or law, make application to the same judge or court that made
the order, to reconsider the matter and modify, amend, or revoke the prior
order.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1008, subd. (a).)
“The party making the application
shall state by affidavit what application was made before, when and to what
judge, what order or decisions were made, and what new or different facts,
circumstances, or law are claimed to be shown.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1008, subd.
(a).)
“[A] party must provide a
satisfactory explanation for failing to offer the evidence in the first
instance.” (In re Marriage of Herr (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 1463, 1468 [internal
citations omitted]; In re Marriage of Oropallo (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th
997, 1002 [“A motion made in accordance with section 1008 must include
reference to new or different facts, circumstances, or law before the earlier
order may be reconsidered”].)
b.    
Discussion
Although the motion is unclear, the
conclusion reveals that Plaintiff is seeking an order finding that Spectre (not
just Matsumura) is liable to Plaintiff for treble damages. Specifically, the
motion seeks an order finding “Defendants Matsumura and Spectre … jointly and
severally liable for treble damages for fraud in the inducement under
California Penal Code section 496(c) in the final judgment amount of
$111,797.22. Plaintiff [also seeks] … $614 for costs of suit and $20,000 for
her reasonable attorney’s fees. In other words [Plaintiff argues], a total
final judgment in the amount of $132,411.22 should be entered jointly and
severally against both [defendants].” (Motion, p. 8:1-7.)
Plaintiff argues that the “new
facts” warranting that order are her “numerous allegations in [her] Complaint
that defendant Matsumura was acting at all relevant times as the Vice President
and authorized agent of defendant Spectre, and that Spectre not only authorized
Matsumura to commit fraud but actively encouraged and participated in his
efforts to defraud Plaintiff.” (Motion, p. 2:10-14.) 
Plaintiff argues that because
default was entered against Spectre, that default automatically turned her
allegations in the Complaint into “admissions” and, therefore, she did not need
to submit evidence at the Default Prove Up Hearing to obtain treble damages
against Spectre.
Plaintiff misunderstands the law. 
“The default and default judgment
are separate procedures.” (Jonson v. Weinstein (1967) 249 Cal.App.2d
954, 958.) 
“The entry of a default terminates
a defendant’s rights to take any further affirmative steps in the litigation
until either its default is set aside or a default judgment is entered. [Citations.]
‘A defendant against whom a default has been entered is out of court and is not
entitled to take any further steps in the cause affecting plaintiff’s right of
action; he cannot thereafter, until such default is set aside in a proper
proceeding, file pleadings or move for a new trial or demand notice of
subsequent proceedings.’ [Citation.]” (Devlin v. Kearny Mesa
AMC/Jeep/Renault, Inc. (1984) 155 Cal.App.3d 381, 385–386.) 
            However, “plaintiffs
in default cases must still prove their damages to obtain monetary recovery.
([Code Civ. Proc.] § 585, subd. (b) [specifying that when a plaintiff applies
to the court for a default judgment, ‘[t]he court shall hear the evidence
offered by the plaintiff, and shall render judgment ... as appears by the
evidence to be just’]; see also, e.g., [Kim v. Westmoore Partners, Inc.
(2011) 201 Cal.App.4th 267, 288] [‘“damages must be proved in the trial court
before the default judgment may be entered”’]; [Ostling v. Loring (1994)
27 Cal.App.4th 1731, 1745] [‘damages ... despite default, require proof’]; [Barragan
v. Banco BCH (1986) 188 Cal.App.3d 283, 302] [‘Plaintiffs in a default
judgment proceeding must prove they are entitled to the damages claimed’].)” (Sass
v. Cohen (2020) 10 Cal.5th 861, 880.)
Here, Plaintiff argues that treble
damages against Spectre should have been awarded at the Default Prove Up
Hearing pursuant to California Penal Code section 496, subdivision (c).
“The criminal statute for receipt
of stolen (Penal Code, § 496, subd. (a)) requires demonstrating ‘(1) that the
particular property was stolen, (2) that the accused received, concealed or
withheld it from the owner thereof, and (3) that the accused knew that the
property was stolen. [Citation.]’ [Citation.]” (Finton Construction, Inc. v.
Bidna & Keys, APLC (2015) 238 Cal.App.4th 200, 213; Pen. Code, §  496, subd. (a) [providing that a person “who
buys or receives any property that has been stolen or that has been obtained in
any manner constituting theft or extortion, knowing the property to be so
stolen or obtained, or who conceals, sells, withholds, or aids in concealing,
selling, or withholding any property from the owner, knowing the property to be
so stolen or obtained, shall be punished...”].)
Penal Code section 496, subdivision
(c) states: “Any person who has been injured by a violation of subdivision (a) …
may bring an action for three times the amount of actual damages, if any,
sustained by the plaintiff, costs of suit, and reasonable attorney’s fees.”
Here, according to the June 16,
2023 Minute Order, the Court found that Plaintiff was not entitled to treble
damages against Spectre under Penal Code section 496, subdivision (c), because
Plaintiff failed to prove the element of “intent” and fraud against that
defendant. In other words, Plaintiff failed to prove that Spectre knew that
Matsumura had “stolen” money from Plaintiff, and that Spectre still received,
concealed, or otherwise withheld that money from Plaintiff despite knowing the
money had been stolen. 
In her motion, Plaintiff does not
set forth any new or different facts, circumstances, or law that changes those
findings. Contrary to her argument, allegations in the Complaint are not “new
facts” within the meaning of the motion for reconsideration statute. 
For those reasons, the Court finds
it proper to deny the motion.

DENIED.
