b.    
Relevant Information About Vehicle
In the complaint, Plaintiff alleges
that on 12/20/21, in exchange for valuable consideration, Plaintiffs purchased
a 2022 Volkswagen Taos, manufactured and/or distributed by defendant.  During the warranty period, the vehicle
contained or developed defects including a. defective audio system and b.
defective engine.  Plaintiffs provided Defendant
and its representatives sufficient opportunity to service or repair the
vehicle.  Defendant and its representatives
were unable and/or failed to service or repair the vehicle within a reasonable
number of attempts.
 
In the motion, Plaintiff asserts
that on 4/11/22, with 2,319 miles on the odometer, Plaintiff presented the
vehicle to Defendant’s authorized repair facility for Recall 91DI to update the
infotainment system software.  The
Technician updated the infotainment system software. The vehicle was out of
service for one day.
 

On 10/10/22, with 7,169 miles on
the odometer, Plaintiff returned the vehicle to Defendant’s authorized repair
facility again for Recall 24HV to update the engine control module software, to
update the rearview camera software, and for complaints that the radio would
intermittently turn off and on while driving. The Technician updated the
software for the engine control module and the rearview camera but was unable
to duplicate the radio concern. The vehicle was out of service for a total of
one day.
 
On 1/2/23, with 9,903 miles on the
odometer, Plaintiff brought the vehicle to Defendant’s authorized repair
facility again with continued complaints that the radio would turn off and on
while driving. The Technician verified the concern and performed Technical Tip
No. 91-22-02TT for a hard reset of the infotainment system. The vehicle was at
the dealership for two days.
 
On 1/13/23, with 10,158 miles on
the odometer, Plaintiff brought the vehicle to Defendant’s authorized repair
facility for continued complaints that the radio kept going black and that the
radio would no longer turn on. The Technician verified the concern and found
that there was an internal short and Diagnostic Trouble Codes (“DTC”) U105400
and U112100. The Technician replaced the 5f control module and performed a
software configuration. The vehicle was out of service for five days.
 
On 2/6/23, with 10,423 miles on the
odometer, Plaintiff brought the vehicle to Defendant’s authorized repair
facility with complaints that the “Check Engine” light was illuminated. The
Technician verified the concern and found DTC P049100. The Technician replaced
the secondary air combi-vale. The Subject Vehicle was out of service for eight
days.
 
On 2/23/23, with only 10,573 miles
on the odometer, Plaintiff brought the Subject Vehicle to Defendant’s
authorized repair facility with continued complaints that the “Check Engine”
light was illuminated. The Technician again verified the concern and found DTC
P0491. The Technician proceeded to replace the secondary air combi valve but
the “Check Engine” light returned. The Technician noted that the return of the
“Check Engine” light was caused by a “Manufacturer Defect causing leak.” The
Technician subsequently removed the cylinder head and cleaned the secondary air
channels and ports. The vehicle was out of service for 29 days.
 
c.    
Discovery Dispute
On 4/28/23, Plaintiff served
discovery requests.  On 5/26/23, Defendant
served responses.  Plaintiff attempted to
meet and confer.  Defendant responded
that it was standing by its objections and would not supplement responses.  The parties continued to attempt to meet and
confer, but did not resolve the issues. 
 
Special Interrogatories
Plaintiff is seeking the following general
categories of information in his Special Interrogatories: (1) those related to
the identities of individuals who inspected and/or repaired the subject vehicle;
(2) the number of days that the Subject Vehicle was out of service for warranty
repairs; (3) the steps taken to permanently repair the powertrain concerns that
were presented to VWGoA’s authorized repair facilities; and (4) VWGoA’s investigation,
root cause analysis, and proposed repairs for the powertrain concerns.
 
Plaintiff argues that the information
is relevant to the lemon law claim and the objections are without merit. 
 
Defendants argue that the requests impermissibly
contain subparts and seek information about other vehicles which is irrelevant.
 
 
Request for Production of
Documents
Plaintiff is seeking the following
general categories of documents in his Request for Production of documents: (1)
the repairs performed on the subject vehicle (i.e. Nos. 5, 9, 10-12); (2) those
relating to VWGoA’s internal investigation and analysis of the Defects plaguing
Plaintiff’s vehicle and establishing that Defendant previously knew of such
Defects but nevertheless refused to repurchase the vehicle (i.e., Nos. 14-29
and 49); and (3) those relating to Defendant’s warranty and vehicle repurchase
policies, procedures, and practices (i.e. 43-45, 47-49, 53-55, and 59).
 
Plaintiff argues that Defendant has
been aware of the widespread defects in the subject automobile and that Defendant
has issued TSBs and recalls in connection with the electrical and engine issue.

 
Defendant argues that the technical
documents do not establish its awareness of defects in Plaintiff’s vehicle or
otherwise establish good cause for the requests at issue. Further, Plaintiff’s
meet and confer letters do not reference RPD Nos. 4, 5, 9, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19,
43, 44, 45, 47, 48, 49, 53, 59. As to RPD Nos. 11 and 12, it has already
produced responsive documents and as to RPD Nos. 54 and 55, it is willing to
produce policy and procedure documents subject to a stipulated protective
order. As to Nos. 14 and 20-29, materials relating to defects in other vehicles
are not relevant.
 
d.     Special
Interrogatories
Defendant argues that SROG Nos. 2,
3, 4, 14, 15, 19, 20, 27, and 31-38 are violative of the CCP because they
contain subparts. The Court has reviewed the interrogatories and does not find
that SROG Nos. 2, 3, 4, 14, 15, 19, 20, and 27 violate
the CCP by containing subparts. The interrogatories request specific
information pertaining to one thing. For example, SROG No. 14 states the
following: “Please state how many cumulative days YOUR records show that the
SUBJECT VEHICLE was out of service by reason of any ELECTRICAL DEFECT or
condition complained of by Plaintiff.” As Plaintiff points out, this interrogatory
merely seeks a number of days as an answer. Defendant takes issue with the
phrase “Electrical Defect,” however this term refers to all the electrical
defects at issue in this case. (Whitman Decl., Exh. 2, ¶7.) It would be more burdensome
and redundant to ask how many days the car was out of service for each specific
electrical defect. As to SROG Nos. 31-33 and 35-37, they clearly contain subparts
and are compound. Thus, the motion is DENIED as to SROG Nos. 31-33 and 35-37.
 
Defendant argues that SROG Nos. 2,
3, 32, 33, 36, and 38 are irrelevant because they pertain to vehicles other than
Plaintiff’s. The Court disagrees. One element of a Song-Beverly complaint is
that the defendant’s failure to buy back was not reasonable.  Clearly, a manufacturer’s knowledge that the
plaintiff’s complaint is prevalent in the car manufactured is evidence of
whether the failure to buy back was reasonable or not.  While Donlen v. Ford Motor Company
(2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 138, 143-144 was decided in a different context and not
as a discovery motion, the ultimate holding was that evidence of problems with
other vehicles is relevant and admissible in a Song-Beverly case.  The relevance objection is therefore
overruled.
            
            Defendant
has failed to justify any other objections made. The burden to justify an
objection to a discovery request is on the party asserting the objection. (See Fairmont
Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (2000) 22 Cal.4th 245, 255.) Accordingly, all
other objections are overruled.
 
Defendant also contends that it has
already responded to SROG Nos. 4, 14, 15, 19, 20, 27, 31, 33, 35, and 37 with
all information it possesses, and upon completion of additional discovery will
provide more information. The Court notes that this argument is moot as to Nos.
31, 33, 35 and 37. Defendant has responded with reference to documents which do
not appear to be complete responses and/or do not contain all relevant information
sought. Further, Defendant did not respond to No. 27 other than with objections.

 
Accordingly, the motion is GRANTED
as to SROG Nos. 2, 3, 4, 14, 15, 19, 20, 27, 34, and 38 as Defendant has not
justified its objections and/or has not provided sufficient responses. 
 
e.     Sanctions
re SROG Motion
Neither party seeks imposition of
sanctions in connection with the motion or opposition, and therefore none are imposed.
 
f.      Request
for Production of Documents
The Court CONTINUES the motion as Defendant
argues that the motion should be denied as to a significant number of requests
due to a lack of a sufficient separate statement. A separate statement by
Plaintiff as to this motion has not been filed with the Court. Accordingly, the
Court is unable to ascertain the validity of the argument by Defendant, and a
separate statement is required for this motion under CRC, Rule 3.1345(a).
Further, as to RPD Nos. 11-12, the
parties are ORDERED to meet and confer regarding the protective order such that
the rest of the documents regarding policies/procedures and training materials
pertaining to the pre-litigation handling of repurchase requests may be
produced as Plaintiff appears agreeable to a protective order. 
 
 
Plaintiff is ordered to give
notice.
