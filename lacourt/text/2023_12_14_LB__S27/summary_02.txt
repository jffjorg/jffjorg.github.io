  - Judge: (not specified)
Significant Statements:
  - The court may grant leave to amend the pleadings at any stage of the action
  - Leave to amend should be denied only where the facts are not in dispute, and the nature of the plaintiff's claim is clear, but under substantive law, no liability exists and no amendment would change the result
  - Prejudice exists where the amendment would require delaying the trial, resulting in loss of critical evidence, added costs of preparation, or an increased burden of discovery

And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's Tentative Ruling states that the Plaintiff's motion for leave to amend and to file a Third Amended Complaint is denied. The Plaintiff seeks to add a new cause of action for civil conspiracy, add a new defendant, re-add an ex-defendant, and request permission to add a claim for punitive damages. The Judge notes that the motion is untimely, as it was filed less than 16 court days before the motion hearing date. The Judge also finds that the Plaintiff's motion does not satisfy the California Rules of Court, as it does not include a proposed copy of the Third Amended Complaint and the declaration does not specify why the amendment is necessary and proper, when the facts giving rise to the amended allegations were discovered, and the reasons why the request for amendment was not made earlier. The Judge notes that the Plaintiff is essentially seeking reconsideration of a previous demurrer ruling, which was sustained without leave to amend. The Judge also finds that the Defendants will suffer prejudice if the Plaintiff is allowed to file the Third Amended Complaint, as the Defendants' motions for summary judgment/adjudication are only about one month away.
