And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is denying the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories. The plaintiff had propounded special interrogatories to the defendant, but the defendant responded with objections and stated that they did not know the information requested. The plaintiff contends that the defendant's responses are insufficient and seeks to impose sanctions of $1,000. The judge finds that the parties have failed to file a joint statement explaining which special interrogatories are still at issue, and therefore denies the motion. The judge orders the parties to meet and confer again to try to resolve the outstanding issues.
