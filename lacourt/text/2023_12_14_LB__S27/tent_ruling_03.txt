 Case Number:  22LBCV00049    Hearing Date:   December 14, 2023    Dept:  S27 1.     22LBCV00049
and 22SMCV00217
On 2/01/22, SEJ Properties, L.P.
filed 22LBCV00049 against Defendants, 1801-1899 Willow, LLC (“Willow”) and Alma
D. Barnes for specific performance and related claims arising out of
Defendants’ alleged refusal to close escrow on Plaintiff’s purchase of a
commercial property.
On 3/29/22, the Court denied
Defendants’ motion to expunge lis pendens, finding Plaintiff had established
the probable validity of its claims against Defendants.  
On 2/16/22, SEJ Properties, L.P.
filed 22SMCV00217 against Defendants, Escrow L.A., Inc. and Sharon L. Sharp for
breach of fiduciary duty and related claims arising out of Defendants’ refusal
to release the funds that were deposited into the escrow account in connection
with the transaction at issue in 22LBCV00049.
On June 22, 2022, the two cases
were related and were consolidated on December 8, 2022.
2.     23LBCV00258
            On February 10, 2023, Willow filed 23LBCV00258 against
its brokers, Defendants Muselli & Company, Inc., Vincent Cesare Muselli and
Evan Danile Pozarny (collectively referred to herein as “Defendants Muselli”)
alleging (1) professional negligence; (2) breach of contract; and (3) breach of
fiduciary duty. Williow alleges Defendants’ professional negligence and breach
of contract in connection with Williow ‘s sale of its commercial property to SEJ
Properties, L.P., the same real property transaction at issue in 22LBCV00049
and 22SMCV00217.  Willow alleges Defendants
Muselli misrepresented to SEJ Properties, L.P. that Willow agreed to $250,000
reduction in the sale price.  Willow
alleges it never authorized Defendants Muselli to make such a representation
and as a result of Defendants Muselli’s misrepresentation, litigation and
arbitration resulted.  
3.     23LBCV01460

            On
August 2, 2023, Willow filed 23LBCV01460 against First American Title Insurance
Company alleging (1) professional negligence; and (2) breach of fiduciary
duty.  Willow alleges First American
Title Insurance Company was the title company on the prospective sale of the subject
property to a new buyer, Cobby Pourtavosi. 
Willow instructed First American Title Insurance Company not to contact
SEJ Properties, L.P. regarding the pending sale of the property to
Pourtavosi.  A lis pendens was recorded
against the property by SEJ Properties, L.P. in connection with 22LBCV00049.  Willow and SEJ Properties, L.P. were on the
cusp of settling 22LBCV00049 and obtaining an agreement to remove the lis
pendens on the property.  Willow did not
want SEJ Properties, L.P. to know of the pending sale, because it believed it
would imperil the settlement of 22LBCV00049 and removal of the lis
pendens.  In violation of Willow
instructions, First American Title Insurance Company contacted SEJ Properties,
L.P. regarding the sale to Pourtavosi. 
As Willow feared, SEJ Properties, L.P. refused to execute the settlement
agreement or remove the lis pendens upon learning of the pending sale to
Pourtavosi.  
4.     Motion
to Consolidate
 
a.  Legal Standard
Pursuant to CCP §1048(a), “[w]hen
actions involving a common question of law or fact are pending before the
court, it may order a joint hearing or trial of any or all the matters in issue
in the actions; it may order all the actions consolidated and it may make such
orders concerning proceedings therein as may tend to avoid unnecessary costs or
delay.”  Pursuant to CCP §1048(b), “[t]he
court, in furtherance of convenience or to avoid prejudice, or when separate
trials will be conducive to expedition and economy, may order a separate trial
of any cause of action, including a cause of action asserted in a
cross-complaint, or of any separate issue or of any number of causes of action
or issues, preserving the right of trial by jury required by the Constitution
or a statute of this state or of the United States.”
Consolidation may be complete or
for pretrial or trial purposes.  In a
complete consolidation, the pleadings are merged, one set of findings is made
and one judgment is rendered.  (Hamilton
v. Asbestos Corp. Ltd. (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1127, 1147-1148.)  Where consolidation is limited to pretrial or
trial, the pleadings verdicts, findings and judgments are kept separate.  The actions are simply handled together for
the sake of convenience and judicial economy. 
(Sanchez v. Sup.Ct. (Martinez) (1988) 203 Cal.App.3d 1391,
1395-1399.) 
b.  Request to consolidate GRANTED as to
23LBCV00258 and 23LBCV01460
23LBCV00258 and 23LBCV01460 were
related to the instant action, 22LBCV00049, on August 21, 2023.  Defendant and Cross-Complainant Willow now
moves to consolidate 23LBCV00258 and 23LBCV01460 with 22LBCV00049, correctly
noting that they arise out of the same set of facts and circumstances, such
that consolidation is in the interest of justice.
The Court notes Willow complied
with CRC 3.350(a), which requires notice of the motion to be filed in all cases
sought to be consolidated.  The Court
finds Plaintiff gave notice to all parties in both actions.  
On December 1, 2023, Defendants
Muselli filed an opposition to the motion to consolidate.  On December 6, 2023, Defendant Escrow L.A.,
Inc. and Sharon L Sharp, named defendants in 22SMCV00217 consolidated with
22LBCV00049 (lead case), filed a joinder to Defendants Muselli’s
opposition.  
On December 7, 2023, Willow filed a
reply to Defendants Muselli’s opposition. 

Defendant First American Title
Company in 23LBCV01460 did not file an opposition to the motion to
consolidate.  
Willow argues consolidation would
be proper, because the actions all arise out of the same transaction or series
of transactions.  Willow argues the cases
involve common issues of law and fact.  Willow
argues the actions all involve the sale of the property SEJ, SEJ’s alleged
fraudulent misrepresentations regarding an all cash offer, Muselli’s knowledge
of SEJ’s attempt to secure financing without informing Willow, Musellis’
fraudulent email indicating that Willow agreed to a purchase price reduction,
the dispute over who is responsible for allegedly breaching the Agreement by
failing to close escrow and the dispute over who was responsible for escrow not
closing and the dispute over whether SEJ breached its obligation to timely
provide closing documents to Escrow LA.  Willow
argues the witnesses will also be substantially the same for this reason.  Willow argues consolidation will prevent
duplicative efforts given the overlap of evidence and legal and factual issues.  Willow argues consolidation is also necessary
to prevent inconsistent determinations.  
Defendants Muselli argue the case
against it should not be consolidated with 22LBCV00049, because the two actions
focus on different time periods and 22LBCV00049 contains tort claims that have
absolutely nothing to do with Willow’s claims against it.  Defendants Muselli argue Willow chose to sit
on its rights when it failed to name Muselli in any of the prior
cross-complaints, actions or arbitrations against other defendants.  Defendants Muselli argue Willow chose to file
23LBCV00258 for additional settlement funds to contribute at mediation.  Defendants Muselli argue Willow and SEJ
Properties, L.P. have been litigating against one another for two years.  Defendant Muselli argues it would be unfair
to ask Defendant Muselli to catch up in such a short time.   
In reply, Willow reiterates that
the actions all involve the same fundamental questions of fact and require the
same witnesses and documentary evidence. 
Willow argues dismissed actions and arbitrations have no bearing on this
motion. Willow argues the parties’ entitlement to fees is also not a
consideration on this motion to consolidate. 

The Court finds in favor of
Willow.  23LBCV00258 involves the same
facts, series of transactions, legal disputes and factual disputes as 22LBCV00049.  In fact, Willow’s action against Defendants
Muselli alleges Muselli’s direct responsibility for the disagreement and
misunderstanding between Willow and SEJ Properties, L.P. that is at the heart
of 22LBCV00049.  Litigating these cases
separately will result in judicial inefficiency and could result in
inconsistent findings of fact and law.  With
regard to 23LBCV01460, the Court notes no opposition was filed by First
American Title Insurance Company.  Muselli’s
concern that the lead action has been pending for two years while the action
against it has only been pending for approximately six months can be addressed by
way of a trial continuance.  
Because the cases arise out of the
same commercial real estate purchase transaction, the Court finds consolidation
is appropriate under CCP §1048(a).  The
motion to consolidate is granted.  The request
for joinder filed by Defendant Escrow L.A., Inc. and Sharon L. Sharp is
granted.  22LBCV00049 is the lead
case.  All future hearing dates in 23LBCV00258
and 23LBCV01460  are vacated.  The parties must file all future papers in
22LBCV00049 and must schedule all future hearing dates in 22LBCV00049.
