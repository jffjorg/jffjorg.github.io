And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for the Universal North America Insurance Company (Plaintiff in Intervention) to be discharged from the action and to recover attorney fees and costs. The judge has denied the motion, finding that the Plaintiff in Intervention is not a disinterested stakeholder and that there is a dispute regarding the amount of funds subject to the interpleader. The judge also noted that the self-represented defendant Wise was improperly served with the moving papers by electronic transmission, which does not comply with the Code of Civil Procedure. The judge has ordered that the parties who intend to submit on the tentative must send an email to the court indicating their intention to submit, and that if the parties do not submit on the tentative, they should arrange to appear remotely at the hearing.
