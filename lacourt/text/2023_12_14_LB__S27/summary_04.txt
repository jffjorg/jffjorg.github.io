And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling addresses a motion for summary judgment filed by defendant Nolan S. Desa, M.D. in a medical malpractice case brought by plaintiff Rachelle Toone against multiple defendants. The defendant argues that he complied with the standard of care and that his actions did not cause or contribute to the plaintiff's injuries or damages. The court notes that the standard of care in medical malpractice cases is a matter within the knowledge of experts, and that expert testimony is necessary to prove a breach of that standard. The court also notes that the plaintiff must prove that the defendant's negligence was a "substantial factor" in causing the plaintiff's harm. In this case, the defendant has submitted expert testimony from Harry Sax, M.D., which concludes that the defendant's care and treatment of the plaintiff complied with the standard of care. Since the plaintiff has failed to file opposition to the motion, the court grants the motion for summary judgment.
