 Case Number:  23LBCV00542    Hearing Date:   December 14, 2023    Dept:  S27 On March 27, 2023, Plaintiffs,
Elida Reyes, Javier Olmos, Dulce Reyes, David Olmo Reyes, Octavia Olmos Reyes,
and Jacob Olmos Reyes filed this action against Defendant, MA. Venaranda
Braganza.  Plaintiffs rented a
residential property owned and operated by the landlord Defendant.  Plaintiffs allege that Defendant failed to
maintain the property in a habitable condition despite numerous complaints from
Plaintiffs.  Dulce, David, Octavia, and
Jacob are minors and are appearing by and through their mother and court-appointed
GAL, Elida Reyes. 
 
At this time, the parties have
agreed to settle the entire action for the total amount of $100,000.  The settlement provides for payments to the
parties in the following amounts:
Elida Reyes:                  $32,500
Javier Olmos:                $32,500
Dulce Reyes:                $7,500
David Olmos Reyes:      $12,500
Octavia Olmos Reyes:   $7,500
Jacob Olmos Reyes:     $7,500
 
If the settlement is approved, David’s
settlement will be apportioned $10,605.87 to medical expenses, with the net
balance of $1,894.13 to be deposited in a blocked account.  Dulce, Octavia, and Jacob, have no expenses
and, thus, each is left with a net balance of $7,500 to be deposited in a
blocked account.  
 
As to each petition, in lieu of
attaching Attachment 11b(3), 11b(5), and 11b(6), Plaintiff attached one
attachment for all three.  According to
this attachment, the adult plaintiffs suffered more general damages than the
minor plaintiffs because of the stress and discomfort of living under
“deplorable conditions” with young children, the anxiety of getting defendant
to remedy the conditions, and the frustration from being ignored by
defendant.  Also, David was the only
minor plaintiff who received medical treatment because of his pre-existing
asthma.  The foregoing explains the
reasons for the apportionment of the settlement payments, however it does not
explain the circumstances and the effect that Petitioner’s claim and its
disposition has on the proposed compromise of the claim in the instant
petitions.  Therefore, this attachment does
not address what Attachment 11b(3) requires. 
 
The Court also notes the following
deficiencies.  As to David and Jacob’s
petitions, the age specified in item 2c is incorrect.  Further, as to David’s petition only, item
12(4)(a), (b), and (c) must be completed. 

 
Prior to or at the time of the
hearing, Petitioner is to submit amended petitions addressing the deficiencies
described above.  Pursuant to CRC 7.952,
unless their appearance is excused, Plaintiffs and Petitioner must appear at
the hearing and testify to the satisfaction of the Court before the petitions
can be granted.  Plaintiffs are 12, 5, 3,
and 2, and therefore the Court will excuse their appearance.  If the Court is satisfied with the amended
petitions, it will grant the petitions.
