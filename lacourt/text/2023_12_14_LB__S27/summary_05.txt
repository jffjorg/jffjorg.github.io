And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's motion for reconsideration. The motion was filed to reconsider the court's previous ruling denying treble damages against Spectre, Inc. The plaintiff argues that Spectre should be held jointly and severally liable for treble damages for fraud in the inducement under California Penal Code section 496. However, the judge finds that the plaintiff failed to prove the element of intent and fraud against Spectre and that the allegations in the complaint are not "new facts" within the meaning of the motion for reconsideration statute. The judge also notes that the plaintiff failed to provide a satisfactory explanation for failing to offer evidence in the first instance. Therefore, the motion is denied.
