  - The court cannot conclude that no reasonable jury could find clear and convincing proof of malice, fraud, or oppression.

And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for summary adjudication filed by Hajoca Corporation, the defendant, to dismiss the plaintiffs' request for punitive damages. The plaintiffs, Laverne Montano, Dennis Montano, Michael Montano, Stephen Montano, Donald Montano, and Laurie Reay, allege that Eugene Montano developed mesothelioma as a result of exposure to asbestos from Hajoca Corporation's products. The defendant argues that the plaintiffs' discovery responses and requests for production are factually deficient and do not provide specific evidence concerning the defendant's knowledge, intent to harm, malice, oppression, fraud, or conscious disregard for the safety of others. The plaintiffs argue that the defendant knew of the hazards of asbestos due to a lawsuit in 1976, but continued to sell its products without warnings, testing, or design change, and faced at least ten additional lawsuits in the 1980s for asbestos-related injuries. The court finds that there are disputed issues of material fact about the defendant's knowledge of the hazards of asbestos and its lack of action after having knowledge, and therefore denies the motion for summary adjudication.
