And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the petition for a name change and outlines the next steps. The petitioner must review the proposed decree to ensure the new name is clearly written and correctly spelled. If the name is satisfactory, no appearance is necessary at the hearing. However, if the name is not legible or spelled correctly, the petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. The judge will sign the decree, and a copy will be available in the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing date. Additionally, once the decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition to change name.
