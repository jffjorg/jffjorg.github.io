Petitioner must file written proof that the warrant has been fully addressed and resolved at least two weeks before the continued OSC and hearing on January 6, 2025. If the warrant is not cleared, the OSC and hearing will be taken off calendar without prejudice. The court clerk will run a new criminal history assessment prior to the continued OSC to verify that the bench warrant has been cleared.
