If the Petitioner is satisfied with the spelling and legibility of the new name, no appearance is necessary at the hearing. However, if the new name is not clearly written and correctly spelled, the Petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. A signed copy of the decree will be available in the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing date.
