And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case, granting the petition to change name. The petitioner must review the proposed decree to ensure that the new name is correctly spelled and legible. If the name is satisfactory, the petitioner does not need to appear at the hearing. However, if the name is not clearly written or spelled correctly, the petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. A copy of the signed decree will be available in Room 112 of the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing. Once the decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition to change name.
