The Judge's Tentative Ruling states that the petition to change name will be granted, but the Petitioner must verify the spelling and legibility of the new name on the proposed decree. If the Petitioner is satisfied with the spelling and legibility, no appearance is necessary. However, if the new name is not clearly written and correctly spelled, the Petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. Once the decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition to change name.
