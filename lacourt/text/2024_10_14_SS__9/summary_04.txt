And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the petition for name change and outlined the next steps. The Petitioner must review the proposed decree to ensure the new name is correctly spelled and legible. If the new name meets these standards, no appearance is necessary at the hearing. However, if the new name is not clearly written and correctly spelled, the Petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. A copy of the signed decree will be available in the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing. Once the decree is signed, any changes to the new name will require a new petition.
