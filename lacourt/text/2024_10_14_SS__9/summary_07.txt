The judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding a petition for a name change. The judge requires the petitioner to review the proposed decree and ensure that the new name is correctly spelled and legible. If the petitioner is satisfied with the proposed decree, they do not need to appear at the hearing. However, if the name is not correctly spelled or legible, the petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. The judge has granted the petition and will sign the decree, which will be available in the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing. Once the decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition to change name.
