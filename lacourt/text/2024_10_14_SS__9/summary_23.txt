And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a name change petition. The petitioner must review and correct the proposed decree, ensuring the new name is clearly written and correctly spelled. If the petitioner is satisfied with the proposed decree, no appearance is necessary at the hearing. However, if the decree is not legible or contains errors, the petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. The petition is granted, and a signed copy of the decree will be available at the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing. Additionally, the judge notes that once the decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition to change name.
