The Judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding a petition to change a person's name. The Judge has granted the petition, but with certain conditions. The petitioning individual, known as the Petitioner, must review the proposed decree for spelling and legibility. If the new name is not clearly written and correctly spelled, the Petitioner must appear at the upcoming hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. On the other hand, if the Petitioner is satisfied with the spelling and legibility of the new name, no appearance is necessary. After the hearing, a copy of the signed decree will be available in Room 112 of the Clerk's Office seven days later. Once the decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition.
