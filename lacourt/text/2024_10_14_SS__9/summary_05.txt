And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling in this case is to continue the petition to December 9, 2024 at 9:30 am. The continuation is based on the fact that the petitioner has failed to file proof of publication of the petition. The petitioner must file proof of publication no later than one week before the continued hearing date, or the petition will be denied and dismissed without prejudice.

Additionally, the petition is also continued due to the petitioner's failure to file proof of service on the other parent, or a declaration as to why such service cannot be made. The declaration filed on August 8, 2024 is insufficient because it does not address service of the petition on the other parent. The petitioner must file proof of service on the other parent or a declaration as to why such service cannot be made no later than November 25, 2024. If the petitioner fails to do so, the petition will be denied.
