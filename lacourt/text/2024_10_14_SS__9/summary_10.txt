This tentative ruling concerns a petition for a name change. The judge grants the petition, but with certain conditions. The petitioner must review the proposed decree and ensure that the new name is clearly written and correctly spelled. If the name is correct, the petitioner does not need to appear at the hearing. However, if the name is not correct, the petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. Once the decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition. A copy of the signed decree will be available in Room 112 of the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing.
