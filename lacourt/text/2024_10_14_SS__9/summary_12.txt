And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the petition for a new name. However, the Petitioner must ensure that the new name on the proposed decree is correctly spelled and legible. If the new name is correct, no appearance is necessary at the hearing. If the new name is not clearly written and correctly spelled, the Petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. After the decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition to change name. A copy of the signed decree will be available at the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing date.
