And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling regarding a petition to change the petitioner's name. The judge has granted the petition, but has specified that the petitioner must double-check the spelling and legibility of the new name on the proposed decree. If the new name is clearly written and correctly spelled, no appearance is necessary. However, if the new name is not legible or correctly spelled, the petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. Once the decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition to change name. The signed decree will be available in Room 112 of the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing date of October 14, 2024.
