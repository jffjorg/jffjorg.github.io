And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in a name change petition case (Case Number: 24STCP02496). The Petitioner has filed a petition to change their name, and the Judge has decided to grant the petition. However, the Judge has set a condition: the Petitioner must ensure that the new name on the proposed decree is clearly written and correctly spelled. If the Petitioner is satisfied with the spelling and legibility of the new name, they do not need to appear at the hearing. But if the new name is not correctly written or spelled, the Petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. Once the decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition to change name.
