The Petitioner must carefully review the proposed decree to ensure that the new name is correctly spelled and legible. If everything is in order, no further action is needed. However, if the name is not clearly written or spelled correctly, the Petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. Once the decree is signed, it cannot be changed without filing a new petition.
