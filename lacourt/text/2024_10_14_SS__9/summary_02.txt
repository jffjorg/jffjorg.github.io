The judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding a petition for a name change. The petitioner must review the proposed decree to ensure the new name is spelled correctly and legibly. If the petitioner is satisfied with the new name, they do not need to appear at the hearing. However, if the name is not clearly written or correctly spelled, the petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. The petition is granted, and a signed copy of the decree will be available at the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing. Once the decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition.
