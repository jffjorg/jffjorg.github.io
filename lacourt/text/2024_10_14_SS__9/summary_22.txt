And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the petition for a name change. The petitioner must review the proposed decree to ensure that the new name is clearly written and correctly spelled. If the new name meets these requirements, the petitioner does not need to appear at the scheduled hearing. However, if the new name is not legible or has spelling errors, the petitioner must attend the hearing to present a corrected proposed decree. After the decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition. A copy of the signed decree will be available at the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing.
