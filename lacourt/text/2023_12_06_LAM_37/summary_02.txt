Summary:

The court has denied Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment. The court has granted summary adjudication as to the first cause of action for Breach of Contract and denied summary adjudication as to the second cause of action for Negligent Interference with Prospective Economic Advantage. The court has found that Plaintiff's failure to present evidence that he was unlawfully induced into signing the Estoppel Certificate and his failure to identify a triable issue of fact as to the second cause of action are sufficient to deny summary adjudication.
