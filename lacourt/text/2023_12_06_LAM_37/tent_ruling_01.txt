Background
 
On September 30, 2021, Seven Lions, Inc.
(“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint against Morris Kamkar dba Kamkar Insurance
Agency (“Kamkar”); USG Insurance Services, Inc. (“USG”); AIX Specialty
Insurance Company (“AIX”); and Does 1 to 20. The operative Complaint alleges
three causes of action: (1) breach of contract; (2) breach of the implied
covenant of good faith and fair dealing (insurance bad faith); and (3)
negligence. 
 
On
November 19, 2021, Defendant/Cross-Complainant USG Insurance Services, Inc.
filed a Cross-Complaint against Roes 1 to 50 alleging: (1) equitable indemnity,
(2) contribution, (3) declaratory relief, and (4) express indemnity. 
 
On
January 19, 2022, Defendant/Cross-Complainant Kamkar filed a Cross-Complaint
against Zoes 1 to 25 alleging: (1) express indemnity, (2) equitable indemnity,
(3) contribution, (4) apportionment of fault, and (5) declaratory relief. 
 
On
January 17, 2023, Defendant AIX filed a Motion for Summary Judgment, or in the
alternative, Summary Adjudication on the two claims asserted against AIX for
breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair
dealing (insurance bad faith), and on Plaintiff’s claim for punitive damages.
Plaintiff filed opposing papers on November 22, 2023. Defendant AIX filed a
reply on December 2, 2023. The matter is now before the court. 
 
motion for
summary JUDGMENT/summary ADJUDICATION 
 
I.         Legal Standard
 
“A party may move for summary
adjudication as to one or more causes of action within an action, one or more
affirmative defenses, one or more claims for damages, or one or more issues of
duty, if that party contends that the cause of action has no merit or that
there is no affirmative defense thereto, or that there is no merit to an
affirmative defense as to any cause of action, or both, or that there is no
merit to a claim for damages . . . or that one or more defendants either owed
or did not owe a duty to the plaintiff or plaintiffs. A motion for summary
adjudication shall be granted only if it completely disposes of a cause of
action, an affirmative defense, a claim for damages, or an issue of duty.”
(CCP, § 437c(f)(1).) “Motions for summary adjudication are procedurally
identical to motions for summary judgment[.]” (Dunn v. County of Santa
Barbara (2006) 135 Cal.App.4th 1281, 1290 (Dunn); see also CCP, §
437c(f)(2).)  
 
“[T]he initial burden is always on
the moving party to make a prima facie showing that there are no triable issues
of material fact.” (Scalf v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128
Cal.App.4th 1510, 1519.) “A plaintiff or cross-complainant has met his or her
burden of showing that there is no defense to a cause of action if that party
has proved each element of the cause of action entitling the party to judgment
on the cause of action. Once the plaintiff or cross-complainant has met that
burden, the burden shifts to the defendant or cross-defendant to show that a
triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to the cause of action or
a defense thereto. The defendant or cross-defendant shall not rely upon the
allegations or denials of its pleadings to show that a triable issue of
material fact exists but, instead, shall set forth the specific facts showing
that a triable issue of material fact exists as to the cause of action or a
defense thereto.” (CCP, § 437(c)(p)(1).) 
 
“The motion shall be granted ‘if
all the papers submitted show that there is no triable issue as to any material
fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. In
determining whether the papers show that there is no triable issue as to any
material fact the court shall consider all of the evidence set forth in the
papers, except that to which objections have been made and sustained by the
court, and all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence....’
[Citation.]) The papers filed in support of the motion ‘shall include a
separate statement setting forth plainly and concisely all material facts which
the moving party contends are undisputed.’ [Citation.]” (Dunn, supra,
135 Cal.App.4th at 1290 citing CCP, § 437 subds. (c), (b)(1).) 
 
II.        Discussion
 
This
case arises out of a dispute regarding a fire and smoke loss that damaged
merchandise at Plaintiff’s property located at 1100 E. 16th St.. #A-1, Los Angeles
(the “Loss Location”), and whether the loss was covered by Plaintiff’s
insurance.   
 
Defendant
AIX asserts that before the loss, Plaintiff’s broker, Defendant Kamkar,
submitted a Policy Change Request No. 3 (“PCR No. 3.), removing the Loss
Location from Plaintiff’s Policy. Defendant USG was the “wholesale broker” which
received applications and change requests from Kamkar and submitted them to AIX
via email for processing. Defendant AIX maintains that Kamkar had the authority
to make PCR No. 3 valid without Plaintiff’s signature, thus making the denial
of coverage for the Loss Location also valid. 
 
Plaintiff
maintains that AIX acted in bad faith because Kamkar, and wholesale broker USG,
submitted PCR No. 3 to remove coverage for the Loss Location on May 14, 2021, the
day of the fire, and the request was mistakenly backdated to four days before
the fire. Moreover, Plaintiff did not sign the request, nor ask that the Loss
Location be removed from the Policy. Nevertheless, AIX acted in bad faith by
denying coverage despite knowing that Plaintiff did not make a Policy Change
Request and that the change form had not been processed by the time the fire
occurred.  
 
Defendant
AIX now moves for summary judgment on the basis that there is no triable issue
of material fact as there was no coverage for the Loss Location at the time of
the fire. In the alternative, AIX requests summary adjudication of Plaintiff’s
second cause of action for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and
fair dealing and Plaintiff’s request for punitive damages. Plaintiff opposes
the Motion. 
 
            A.        First Cause of Action – Breach of Contract
 
“To
prevail on a cause of action for breach of contract, the plaintiff must prove
(1) the contract, (2) the plaintiff’s performance of the contract or excuse for
nonperformance, (3) the defendant’s breach, and (4) the resulting damage to the
plaintiff. [Citation.]” (Richmond v. Hartley (2014) 224 Cal.App.4th
1182, 1186.)
 
Defendant
AIX argues that it properly denied coverage because the Loss Location was not
covered at the time of the fire because Plaintiff’s broker, Defendant Kamkar,
had actual or ostensible authority to act on behalf of Plaintiff with respect
to PCR No. 3. 
 
Previously,
on January 7, 2021, Defendant USG emailed AIX with Policy Change Request No. 1
(“PCR No. 1”) asking AIX to amend Plaintiff’s Policy to remove a property
located on 1375 E. 15th St. (the “15th St. property”) which was filled out by
Kamkar on Plaintiff’s behalf and was not signed by Plaintiff. (Kenney Decl. Ex.
3, Austin Decl. Ex. 4 [Kamkar Depo. at p. 186:6-14.) USG requested that AIX
backdate the effective date of the change to January 1, 2021. (Kennedy Decl.
Ex. 3.) AIX processed PCR No. 1 and removed the 15th St. property, effective
January 1, 2021. (Austin Decl. Ex. 4 [Kamkar Depo. at pp. 186:6-14; 192-8-12.].)

 
Similarly,
on February 19, 2021, USG emailed AIX with Plaintiff’s Policy Change Request
No. 2 (“PCR No. 2”). (UMF 16.) PCR No. 2 was dated February 18, 2021, and
sought to add a new property, 768 Ceres Avenue, with an effective date of
February 17, 2021, despite the form containing a typo of February 17, 2010.
(Kennedy Decl. Ex. 5; Austin Decl. Ex. 4 [Kamkar Depo. at pp. 193:11-194:2].)
PCR No. 2 was signed by Kamkar and not Plaintiff. (Austin Decl. Ex. 4 [Kamkar
Depo. at p. 193:22-194:2.].) Understanding that year listed of “2010” was a
typo, AIX issued Policy Change No. 2 and added the Ceres Ave. property to
Plaintiff’s coverage effective February 17, 2021. (Austin Decl. Ex. 4 [Kamkar
Depo. at pp 193:25-194:2, 194:11-14.) 
 
Defendant
AIX asserts that David Talasazan, Plaintiff’s owner, testified at his
deposition that Kamkar was authorized to handle Plaintiff’s insurance needs.
(Austin Decl. Ex. 2 (Talasazan Depo. at p. 19:2-9].) Defendant AIX also asserts
that Talasazan acknowledged that Kamkar was authorized to make PCR Nos. 1 and
2. (Austin Decl. Ex. 2 [Talasazan Depo. at pp. 30:24-31:7, 40:3-6, 41:14-17].) 
 
AIX
further asserts that Kamkar testified that he understood that he had approval
to sign the Policy Change Request forms for Plaintiff. (Austin Decl. Ex. 4
[Kamkar Depo. at p. 190:12-22].) 
 
Q: Did you understand
that you had the approval of Seven Lions to sign change request forms like
Exhibit 20 as you did here? 
 
A: Yes, because that
was an agreement between men and the Seven Lions. 
 
Q: Okay. And when you
say the "agreement," it’s just a verbal understanding between you and
Seven Lions? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
(Ibid.)
 
Moreover,
Kamkar also testified that there was no need for a signature from the insured
(Plaintiff) when submitting a policy change request form unless the request was
to cancel the policy altogether. (Id. at p. 190:23-191:9.)
 
Plaintiff
does not dispute the statements made by Talasazan and Kamkar regarding how PCR
Nos. 1 and 2 were handled, but instead asserts that the evidence is immaterial
because at issue is PCR No. 3. The court disagrees. “Various factors, such as
business practice or past performance will be sufficient to demonstrate the
existence of a contract and give substance to its provisions.” (Southern California Thrift and Loan v. Sylvania Elec. Products,
Inc. (1967) 248 Cal.App.2d 642, 646.) Here, how the parties
handled past Policy Change Requests is indicative of what authority Kamkar had
to make changes to the Plaintiff’s insurance policy and how those changes were
handled by Defendant AIX.
 
“Agency
‘can be established either by agreement between the agent and the principal,
that is, a true agency [citation], or it can be founded on ostensible
authority, that is, some intentional conduct or neglect on the part of the
alleged principal creating a belief in the minds of third persons that an
agency exists, and a reasonable reliance thereon by such third persons.’
[Citation.]” (Hutcheson v. Eskaton Fountainwood Lodge (2017) 17
Cal.App.5th 937, 958 (Hutcherson).) “Actual authority is such as a principal
intentionally confers upon the agent, or intentionally, or by want of ordinary
care, allows the agent to believe himself to possess.” (Civ. Code, § 2316.)
“Ostensible authority is such as a principal, intentionally or by want of
ordinary care, causes or allows a third person to believe the agent to
possess.” (Civ. Code, § 2317.) 
 
Defendant AIX maintains that Kamkar had
actual or ostensible authority to sign the Policy Change Request forms such
that PCR No. 3, removing the Loss Location from Plaintiff’s insurance coverage,
was validly signed by Kamkar. The court agrees that AIX’s evidence shows that
Plaintiff and Kamkar had an agreement wherein Kamkar would effectuate
Plaintiff’s requested policy changes, and Kamkar would sign the Policy Change
Request forms, and AIX processed the forms without Plaintiff’s signature,
making the request effective on the dates requested. However, whether Kamkar
had ostensible authority presents a question of fact. (Yanchor v. Kagan (1971) 22 Cal.App.3d 544, 550.) 
 
On May 14, 2021, a USG agent emailed AIX
requesting an insurance policy change, seeking to add a new location, 6234
Peachtree, St., and to remove the Loss Location from the Policy. (Kennedy Decl.
Ex. 6.) The request to AIX was originally made on May 11, 2021, with only the
request to remove the Loss Location, effective May 10, 2021. (Ibid.)
However, on May 12, 2021, USG’s agent requested that AIX hold off on making the
change as “[w]e need to confirm a couple of things with Agent.” (Ibid.)
On May 14, 2021, USG requested AIX proceed with the policy change with the
below changes: 
 
1st
Policy Change – Effective 5/10/2021, please add the location indicated on the
request form. (6234 Peachtree St., Commerce, CA. 90040)
 
2nd
Policy Change – Effective 5/12/2021, please remove the location indicated on the
request form. (1100 E. 6th St., A-1, Los Angeles, CA. 90021) 
 
I
understand the processing time is approximately 2 weeks. Please forward
endorsements when available. Thank you.
 
(Kennedy Decl. Ex. 6.) The PCR No. 3 was
signed by Kamkar and requested the Loss Location be removed with an effective
date of “05/10/21” due to Plaintiff’s relocation to a new address at 6234
Peachtree St. (Ibid.)
 
Per the parties' prior conduct, AIX
asserts that it recognized that USG had wrongfully listed the address in the
email of the Loss Location as “6th St.” rather than “16th St” but corrected the
error and processed the request. Given the prior conduct involving PCR Nos. 1
and 2, AIX believed that Kamkar had actual or apparent authority to sign the
Policy Change Request forms, because Plaintiff, as Kamkar’s principal, via
“some intentional conduct or neglect” by Plaintiff “create[ed] a belief in the
minds of third persons that an agency exists” such that AIX reasonably relied
on the belief that Kamkar had the authority to make insurance policy changes on
behalf of Plaintiff without Plaintiff’s signature alone.  (Hutcherson, supra, 17
Cal.App.5th at p. 958 citing Lovetro v. Steers (1965) 234 Cal.App.2d
461, 474-475.) 
 
AIX argues that USG’s cover email listing
the wrong address was a scrivener’s error because PCR No. 3 was signed by
Kamkar and clearly listed the intent to remove the Loss Location because there
was no “6th St.” property in Plaintiff’s Policy. (Kennedy Decl. Ex. 6) 
AIX addressed the scrivener’s error by
voiding PCR No 3 and issuing a new enforcement with the correct address, Policy
Change Nos. 4 and 5 on June 02, 2021. (Kennedy Decl. Ex. 1 at
SEVEN_LIONS_CP_080, Exh. 12; SEVEN_LIONS_CP_082, Exh. 12.)  It is undisputed that AIX’s Policy Changes
Nos. 4 and 5 were issued after the Loss Location suffered fire and smoke damage
at 7:26 pm on May 14, 2021. (Undisputed Material Fact “UMF” 32.) 
 
Policy Change No. 4, issued on June 2,
2021, states, in part, as follows: 
 
IT
IS AGREED AND UNDERSTOOD THAT ENDORSEMENT #3 IS NULL & VOID
 
(Kennedy Decl. Ex. 1 at
SEVEN_LIONS_CP_080, Exh. 12.)
 
Policy Change No. 5, also issued on June 2,
2021, states, in part, as follows: 
 
THE
FOLLOWING LOCATION IS DELETED FROM THE POLICY IN ITS ENTIRETY: Premises #1
located at: 1100 E. 16th St., A-1, Los Angeles, CA. 90021
 
(Kennedy Decl. Ex. 1 at
SEVEN_LIONS_CP_082, Exh. 12.)
 
It is undisputed that before issuing
Policy Change Nos 4 and 5, on May 18, 2021, AIX issued Policy Change No. 3,
which stated, in part, as follows: 
 
THE
FOLLOWING LOCATION IS DELETED FROM THE POLICY IN ITS ENTIRETY: Premises #1
located at: 1100 E. 6th St., A-1, Los Angeles, CA. 90021
 
(UMF 31 [Kennedy Decl. Ex. 1 at
SEVEN_LIONS_CP_082_078, Exh. 7].) 
 
Defendant AIX maintains that Policy
Change Nos. 4 and 5 are effective because in cases of scrivener’s error, “a
court may reform a contract to add a concept that is not present in the
contractual language.” (Alameda County Flood Control
& Water Conservation Dist. v. Department of Water Resources (2013)
213 Cal.App.4th 1163, 1195, fn. 31 citing California Pacific Title Co. v.
Moore (1964) 229 Cal.App.2d 114, 116.) 
 
Civil Code § 3399 provides: 
 
When,
through fraud or a mutual mistake of the parties, or a mistake of one party,
which the other at the time knew or suspected, a written contract does not
truly express the intention of the parties, it may be revised on the
application of a party aggrieved, so as to express that intention, so far as it
can be done without prejudice to rights acquired by third persons, in good
faith and for value.


Here, Defendant AIX fails to show that it
was a party aggrieved by error and that it has made an application with this
court to reform the insurance policy to correct the error. (Civ. Code, § 3399.)

“When only one party to the contract is
mistaken as to its provisions and his mistake is known or suspected by the
other, the contract may be reformed to express a single intention entertained
by both parties. Although a court of equity may revise a written instrument to
make it conform to the real agreement, it has no power to make a new contract
for the parties, whether the mistake be mutual or unilateral [citation].” (Shupe v. Nelson (1967) 254 Cal.App.2d 693, 700.) Here,
Defendant AIX fails to show that USG’s error of listing the property to be
deleted as “6th St.” rather than the Loss Location located at “16th St.” was an
error known or suspected by Plaintiff. 
 
“In order to reform a written instrument,
the party seeking relief must prove the true intent by clear and convincing evidence.” (Shupe, at p. 700.) Here, Defendant
AIX fails to show by clear and convincing evidence that Plaintiff intended to
remove the Loss Location effective May 10, 2021. Defendant AIX’s only evidence
of Plaintiff’s intent is the PCR No. 3 signed by Kamkar, not Plaintiff.  (Kennedy Decl. Ex. 6.)  Policy Change No. 3 shows that AIX initially
understood PCR No. 3 to mean that the property located at “1100 E. 6th
St., A-1, Los Angeles, CA. 90021” rather than the Loss Location was the
property that needed to be removed. Moreover, PCR No. 3 does not
bear the error that formed the basis for AIX issuing Policy Changes Nos. 4 and
5 and denying coverage for the Loss Location. Moreover, at the time Policy
Changes Nos. 4 and 5 were made, AIX already knew that Plaintiff had submitted a
notice of loss. (Khoshlesan Decl. Ex. 3 [KAMKAR000117, 000498- 499,
000894], Ex. 4 [USG0016-18, 0021-25, 0119-123], Ex. 5 [SevenLions_000023;
00072-74, 00084-86; 000156, 000172-174].)
 
As AIX made no application to reform Policy
Changes Nos. 4 and 5, the validity of these changes and AIX’s denial of
Plaintiff’s insurance claim present triable issues of material fact. Therefore,
AIX has failed to meet its initial burden, and its request for summary judgment
is denied. 
 
Even if AIX had met its burden of showing
it was the aggrieved party entitled to seek reformation of the insurance
policy, triable issues of fact exist as to what the intent of the parties was when
PCR No. 3 was requested. Plaintiff presents evidence that Kamkar informed USG
that removal of the Loss Location from the policy was to be effective only
after 30 days of making the request, but due to miscommunication between Kamkar
and USG, the 30 day “umbrella coverage” was not included in the policy change
request sent to AIX.  (Khoshlesan Decl.,
Ex. 3[KAMKAR000437, 000447, 000454-455, 000466]; Exh. 4 [USG 0044-0046, 0068,
0105, 0632]; Ex. 5 [SevenLions_000795-796].) Plaintiff also provides evidence
that its owner, Talasazan, only requested that Kamkar add the new location to the
policy and made no request to remove a property nor a request for a 30-day
umbrella coverage on the Loss Location. (Khoshlesan Decl. Ex. 1 [Talasazan
Depo. at p. 221:15-24], Ex. 2 [Kamkar Depo. at p. 90:1-92:19-25]; Ex.
5[SevenLions_000488, 000734-735].)
 
Although AIX on its own initiative fixed
one typo regarding the effective date of PCR No. 2, triable issues of fact
exist as to whether AIX had the authority to unilaterally fix the typo
regarding the correct address of the property that was to be removed from
Plaintiff’s Policy when the error was in the cover email USG sent AIX,
especially when the correction would be for the benefit of AIX. (Khoshlesan
Decl. Ex. 5 [SevenLions_001413].)
 
As the court finds triable issues of fact
exist, denial of Defendant AIX’s request for summary judgment is appropriate. 
B.        Second Cause of Action- Breach of the Implied Covenant of
Good Faith and Fair Dealing (Insurance Bad Faith)
Every contract contains
an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing providing that no party to
the contract will do anything that would deprive another party of the benefits
of the contract.¿The implied covenant protects the reasonable expectations of
the contracting parties based on their mutual promises.” (Digerati
Holdings, LLC v. Young Money Entertainment, LLC
(2011) 194 Cal.App.4th 873, 885.) “To establish a bad faith claim, the
insured must show that (1) benefits due under the policy were withheld and (2)
the reason for withholding the benefits was unreasonable or without proper
cause.” (Century Surety Co. v. Polisso (2006) 139 Cal.App.4th
922, 949 (Century Surety Co.).) “[F]or there to be a breach of the
implied covenant, the failure to bestow benefits must have been under
circumstances or for reasons which the law defines as tortious.” (California Shoppers, Inc. v. Royal Globe Ins. Co. (1985) 175 Cal.App.3d 1, 15 (California Shoppers, Inc.).) 
 
Defendant AIX maintains that Plaintiff’s
second cause of action is barred by the genuine dispute doctrine. The genuine
dispute “doctrine holds that an insurer does not act in bad faith when it
mistakenly withholds policy benefits, if the mistake is reasonable or is based
on a legitimate dispute as to the insurer's liability.” (Century Surety Co., supra, 139
Cal.App.4th at p. 949.) Here, AIX has shown that a genuine dispute exists as to
whether PCR No. 3 was valid and if it voided coverage of the Loss Location. 
 
“[B]efore an insured can be found to have
acted tortiously, i.e., in bad faith, in refusing to bestow policy benefits, it
must have done so ‘without proper cause.’” (California Shoppers, Inc., supra, 175 Cal.App.3d at pp. 54–55.) “Of course,
the converse of ‘without proper cause’ is that declining to perform a
contractual duty under the policy with proper cause is
not a breach of the implied covenant.” (Id.  at p. 54 [italics original].) Here, there is
no dispute that Kamkar sent and signed PCR No. 3 to remove the Loss Location
property with an effective date of May 10, 2021. (Kennedy Decl. Ex. 6.) While
it is disputed whether Kamkar had the authority to make the request and what
Plaintiff’s actual intentions were at the time the request was made, AIX had
proper cause to deny coverage for damage sustained at the Loss Location. 
 
Therefore, the burden shifts to Plaintiff
to show that AIX breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. 
 
In Mariscal v. Old Republic Life Ins.
Co. (1996) 42 Cal.App.4th 1617 (Mariscal), the appellate court stated: 
 
The
insurance company breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing because
it did not fulfill its obligation to protect the interest of its insured. When
investigating a claim, an insurance company has a duty to diligently search for
evidence which supports its insured's claim. If it seeks to discover only the
evidence that defeats the claim it holds its own interest above that of its
insured.
 
(Id. at p. 1620.) 
 
An insurer's duty to fully investigate
“does not evaporate after litigation has commenced.” (Jordan v. Allstate
Ins. Co. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 1062, 1076, fn. 7.) Here, AIX’s
investigation uncovered a miscommunication about when the Loss Location was to
be removed from the policy and the request for a 30 day coverage extension.
(UMF 36.) AIX’s investigator became aware on May 20, 2021, that Plaintiff had
only asked Kamkar to add the new location and said nothing about removing the
Loss Location from the Policy. (Khoshlesan Decl. Ex. 3 [KAMKAR000696, 000894];
Ex. 5 [SevenLions_000443, 000488, 000734-735].)
 
Despite becoming aware of the error in
PRC No. 3, AIX did not correct the error in Plaintiff’s favor and instead
proceeded to unilaterally correct the typo on USG’s cover email and issue Policy Changes Nos. 4 and 5 on June 2, 2021, in order to deny
Plaintiff’s claim.  (Khoshlesan
Decl. Ex. 3 [KAMKAR000566]; Ex. 4 [USG0619-620]; Ex. 5 [SevenLions_001413].)
 
“An insurance company may not ignore
evidence which supports coverage. If it does so, it acts unreasonably towards
its insured and breaches the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.” (Mariscal, supra, 42
Cal.App.4th at p. 1624.) Here, Plaintiff has shown that AIX ignored evidence of
the error in PCR No. 3 after uncovering the error and the fact that a 30 day
coverage extension was sought, and instead proceeded to fix the typo in USG’s
cover email and deny Plaintiff’s claim.  
 
For there to be a breach of the implied
covenant of good faith and fair dealing “[t]here must be proof the insurer
failed or refused to discharge its contractual duties not because of an honest
mistake, bad judgment, or negligence, ‘but rather by a conscious and deliberate
act, which unfairly frustrates the agreed common purposes and disappoints the
reasonable expectations of the other party thereby depriving that party of the
benefits of the agreement.’ [Citation.]” (Century Surety Co., supra,
139 Cal.App.4th at p. 949.) 
 
Plaintiff has presented sufficient
evidence to raise a triable issue of fact as to whether AIX acted in good faith
after discovering the mistake in PCR No. 3 and seeking to void Policy Change
No. 3 after it knew of Plaintiff’s honest mistake and issuing Policy Changes
Nos. 4 and 5 so as to avoid paying for damage sustained by the Loss Location. 
 
Summary adjudication is denied as to the
second cause of action. 
 
C.         Plaintiff’s
Prayer for Punitive Damages
To state a claim for punitive damages under Civil Code § 3294, a
plaintiff must allege specific facts showing that the defendant has been guilty
of malice, oppression or fraud. (Smith v. Superior Court (1992) 10 Cal.
App. 4th 1033, 1042.) “Malice” is defined in Civ. Code § 3294 (c)(1) as
“conduct which is intended by the defendant to cause injury” or “despicable
conduct which is carried on by the defendant with a willful and conscious
disregard of the rights or safety of others.” “Oppression” is as “despicable
conduct subjecting a person to cruel and unjust hardship in conscious disregard
of that person’s rights.” (Civ. Code § 3294(c)(2).) The term “despicable” has
been defined in the case law as actions that are “base,” “vile,” or
“contemptible.”  (Shade Foods, Inc. v.
Innovative Products Sales & Marketing, Inc. (2000) 78 Cal.App.4th 847,
891.) Fraud means “an intentional misrepresentation, deceit, or concealment of
a material fact known to the defendant with the intention on the part of the
defendant of thereby depriving a person of property or legal rights or otherwise
causing injury.” (Civ. Code, § 3294(c) (3).)
 
Defendant
maintains that Plaintiff’s punitive damage claim fails as a matter of law
because Plaintiff cannot show clear and convincing evidence of malice, fraud,
or oppression. (Civ. Code, § 3294.) “[A]lough the ‘clear and convincing’
evidentiary standard is a stringent one, it does not impose on a plaintiff the
obligation to ‘prove’ a case for punitive damages at summary judgment.” (American Airlines, Inc. v. Sheppard, Mullin, Richter & Hampton
(2002) 96 Cal.App.4th 1017, 1049.) 
 
AIX
offers no evidence in support of its assertion that Plaintiff cannot meet its
evidentiary burden other than stating in a conclusory fashion: 
 
Under no
circumstances could AIX’s conduct be considered sufficiently oppressive,
fraudulent, or malicious to allow Plaintiff to recover punitive damages. 
 
(Motion
at p. 17:12-13.) 
 
The court disagrees
and finds that a trier of fact could sufficiently find that AIX acted with
malice, oppression, or fraud in denying Plaintiff’s insurance claim. “[S]ummary judgment “on the issue of
punitive damages is proper’ only ‘when no reasonable jury could find the
plaintiff's evidence to be clear and convincing proof of malice, fraud or
oppression.’ [Citation].” (Spinks v. Equity Residential Briarwood Apartments (2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 1004, 1053.)
 
On
May 18, 2021, before AIX became aware of the error in PCR No. 3, AIX processed
PCR No. 3 and issued Policy Change No 3, which stated, in part:  
 
THE
FOLLOWING LOCATION IS DELETED FROM THE POLICY IN ITS ENTIRETY: Premises #1
located at: 1100 E. 6th St., A-1, Los Angeles, CA. 90021
 
(UMF 31.) At this time, Policy Change No.
3 did not fix the typo in USG’s cover email and did not officially delete
coverage for the Loss Location. After Plaintiff submitted in loss claim, and
after AIX  discovered the error in PCR
No. 3, on June 2, 2021, AIX unilaterally corrected the error in USG’s cover
email and issued Policy Change Nos. 4 and 5, effectively removing the Loss
Location from Plaintiff’s Policy, retroactively, and denying the claim.(Kenney
Decl. Ex 1 [SEVEN_LIONS_CP_080, SEVEN_LIONS_CP_082], Ex. 12; Khoshlean Decl.
Ex. 3 [KAMKAR000566]; Ex. 4 [USG0619-620], Ex. 5 [SevenLions_001413].)
 
Viewing the evidence in the light most
favorable to the nonmoving party, the court finds that a triable issue of fact exists,
and a reasonable jury could find that AIX acted with malice, oppression, or
fraud in denying Plaintiff’s insurance claim. 
 
Therefore,
the request for summary adjudication of Plaintiff’s request for punitive
damages is denied. 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant AIX’s Motion for Summary
Judgment is denied. Defendant AIX’s Motion for Summary Adjudication of the
second cause of action and claim for punitive damages is also denied. 
 
Defendant AIX to give notice.
