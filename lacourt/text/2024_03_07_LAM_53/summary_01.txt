And here is the English-text summary of the Tentative Ruling:

The Court has considered the motion to seal portions of Defendant's Cross-Complaint filed by Plaintiff and cross-defendant KBS Holdco, LLC, d/b/a Regency Outdoor Advertising, and defendant and cross-complainant Thomas M. Carlson. The Court notes that the settlement agreement between the parties may include a provision that restricts the disclosure of factual information related to Defendant's claims for workplace harassment and discrimination. However, the Court finds that this provision may not comply with Code of Civil Procedure section 1001, and therefore, the Court will not enter an order that restricts the disclosure of factual information related to Defendant's claims. The Court orders the parties to file a supplemental brief addressing the effect of Code of Civil Procedure section 1001 on their motion to seal, and continues the hearing to April 15, 2024.
