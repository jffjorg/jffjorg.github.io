MOVING PARTY:                 Plaintiff Sepideh Arghavanifard
        
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Defendant Jaguar Land Rover North America,
LLC
Motion to Compel Further Responses to Requests for Production of
Documents
The court
considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers filed in connection with
this motion. 
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff Sepideh Arghavanifard (“Plaintiff”) moves the court for an
order compelling defendant Jaguar Land Rover North America, LLC (“Defendant”)
to serve further responses to Plaintiff’s Requests for Production of Documents,
Set Two, numbers 1, 2, 4, and 6-78. 
The court grants Plaintiff’s motion to compel Defendant’s further
response to Requests for Production of Documents, number 1, limited to the
period of December 8, 2019 to the present. 
(Compl., ¶ 8 [alleging that Plaintiff leased the subject vehicle on
December 8, 2019].) 
The court grants Plaintiff’s motion to compel Defendant’s further
response to Requests for Production of Documents, number 2, because Defendant’s
representation of its inability to comply with the demand is inadequate and
incomplete.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§§ 2031.310, subd. (a)(2), 2031.230.)
The court grants Plaintiff’s motion to compel Defendant’s further
response to Requests for Production of Documents, number 4 because the
objections in the response are without merit. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a)(3).)
The court denies Plaintiff’s motion to compel Defendant’s further
responses to Requests for Production of Documents, numbers 6, 31, 54, and 77
because those demands are overbroad and unduly burdensome since they call for
information that is neither relevant to the subject matter involved in the
pending action nor reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible
evidence.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2017.010.)  
The court grants Plaintiff’s motion to compel Defendant’s further
responses to Requests for Production of Documents, numbers 7-9, limited to
documents constituting or evidencing Defendant’s policies or procedures
concerning the issuance of refunds to buyers or providing replacement vehicles
to buyers in California under the Song-Beverly Act for the period of December
8, 2019 to the present.  (Compl.,
¶ 8 [alleging that Plaintiff leased the subject vehicle on December 8,
2019].)  
The court grants Plaintiff’s motion to compel Defendant’s further
responses to Requests for Production of Documents, numbers 10, 12, 14, 17-19,
21, 23-24, 27-29, 33, 35, 37, 40-42, 44, 46-47, 50-52, 56, 58, 60, 63-65, 67,
69-70, and 73-75, but Defendant shall only be required to produce any internal
analyses or investigations regarding the defects alleged in Plaintiff’s
Complaint in vehicles for the same year, make, and model of the subject
vehicle.  This includes Recall Notices
and Technical Service Bulletins. 
Defendant is not required to do a search of emails.
The court denies Plaintiff’s motion to compel Defendant’s further
responses to Requests for Production of Documents, numbers 11, 13, 16, 25, 30,
32, 34, 36, 39, 48, 53, 55, 57, 59, 62, 71, 76, and 78 because Defendant’s representations
of its inability to comply with those demands are not inadequate, incomplete,
or evasive.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.310, subd. (a)(2).) 
The court grants Plaintiff’s motion to compel Defendant’s further
responses to Requests for Production of Documents, numbers 15, 20, 22, 26, 38,
43, 45, 49, 61, 66, 68, and 72, but Defendant shall only be required to produce
any customer complaints relating to defects alleged in Plaintiff’s Complaint in
vehicles purchased in California for the same year, make and model of the
subject vehicle.
