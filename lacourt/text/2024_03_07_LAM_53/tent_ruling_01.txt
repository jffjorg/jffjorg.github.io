MOVING PARTIES:
            Plaintiff and cross-defendant
KBS Holdco, LLC, d/b/a Regency Outdoor Advertising, and defendant and
cross-complainant Thomas M. Carlson
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       n/a
Motion to Seal
The court
considered the moving papers filed in connection with this motion.  No opposition papers were filed.
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff and cross-defendant KBS Holdco, LLC, d/b/a Regency Outdoor
Advertising (“Plaintiff”), together with defendant and cross-complainant Thomas
M. Carlson (“Defendant”) (collectively, the “Parties”) move the court for an
order sealing portions of Defendant’s Cross-Complaint.  Specifically, the Parties seek the seal the
information set forth on the following pages of the Cross-Complaint: (1) page
2, lines 8-11; (2) page 2, lines 13-16; (3) page 2, lines 17-24; (4) page 3,
lines 2-4; (5) page 3, lines 8-11; (6) page 5, lines 12-14; (7) page 5, lines
15-17; (8) page 5, lines 18-20; (9) page 6, lines 1-2; (10) page 6, lines 4-7;
(11) page 6, lines 9-14; (12) page 7, lines 13-15; (13) page 7, lines 16-17;
and (14) page 8, lines 21-23.   (Angioni
Decl., Ex. A [proposed redacted Cross-Complaint].) 
Generally,
court records are presumed to be open unless confidentiality is required by
law.¿ (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.550, subd. (c).)¿ If the presumption of
access applies, the court may order that a record be filed under seal “if it
expressly finds facts that establish: (1) There exists an overriding interest
that overcomes the right of public access to the record; (2) The overriding
interest supports sealing the record; (3) A substantial probability exists that
the overriding interest will be prejudiced if the record is not sealed; (4) The
proposed sealing is narrowly tailored; and (5) No less restrictive means exist
to achieve the overriding interest.”¿ (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.550, subd.
(d).)¿ 
The court
notes that the Parties’ settlement agreement might include a provision that
does not comply with Code of Civil Procedure section 1001. 
“[A]
provision within a settlement agreement that prevents or restricts the
disclosure of factual information related to a claim filed in a civil action or
a complaint filed in an administrative action, regarding any of the following,
is prohibited: [¶¶] (3) An act of workplace harassment or discrimination . . .
as described in subdivisions (a), (h), (i), (j), and (k) of Section 12940 of
the Government Code.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 1001, subd. (a)(3).)  In such a civil
matter, “a court shall not enter, by stipulation or otherwise, an order that
restricts the disclosure of information in a manner that conflicts with
subdivision (a).”  (Code Civ. Proc., §
1001, subd. (b).) 
Here, Defendant’s
Cross-Complaint is a civil action alleging acts of workplace harassment or
discrimination as described in Government Code section 12940, subdivisions (a)
and (j).  (Cross-Compl., ¶¶ 33
[incorporating all allegations in the second cause of action], 35-36.)  In their moving papers and supporting
declarations, the Parties have indicated that their settlement agreement
appears to include a term that restricts the disclosure of the factual
information related to Defendant’s workplace harassment or discrimination claims
by requiring the Parties to jointly file a motion to seal the portions of the
Cross-Complaint describing those claims. 
(Angioni Decl., ¶ 3; Sylla Decl., ¶ 4; Mot., p. 5:12-15 [“as
part of the settlement, the Parties jointly agreed to seek to redact
allegations in the Cross-Complaint that [Plaintiff] contends damages Plaintiff’s
(and its owners and employees’) character, business, future business
opportunities, and professional reputation”].) 
Thus, it
appears that the Parties’ settlement agreement might include a provision that does
not comply with Code of Civil Procedure section 1001, subdivision (a).  If that is the case, the court shall not
enter an order, in ruling on the Parties’ motion to seal or otherwise, that
will restrict the disclosure of factual information related to Defendant’s
claims for workplace harassment and discrimination alleged in the
Cross-Complaint, pursuant to the Parties’ settlement agreement.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1001, subd. (b).) 
The Parties
did not address this statute in their motion. 
The court therefore exercises its discretion to continue the hearing on the
Parties’ motion to seal in order to give the Parties an opportunity to file a
supplemental brief that addresses the effect of Code of Civil Procedure section
1001 on their motion. 
ORDER
            The court orders that the hearing on
plaintiff and cross-defendant KBS Holdco, LLC, d/b/a Regency Outdoor
Advertising and defendant and cross-complainant Thomas M. Carlson’s motion to
seal is continued to April 15, 2024, at 10:00 a.m., in Department 53.
            The court orders that plaintiff and
cross-defendant KBS Holdco, LLC, d/b/a Regency Outdoor Advertising, and
defendant and cross-complainant Thomas M. Carlson may file a supplemental
brief, not to exceed five pages in length, that addresses the effect of Code of Civil Procedure
section 1001 on the parties’ motion to seal, no later than April 5, 2024.
            The court orders plaintiff and cross-defendant KBS
Holdco, LLC, d/b/a Regency Outdoor Advertising to give notice of this ruling. 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
DATED:  March 7, 2024
