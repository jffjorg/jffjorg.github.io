And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings pending the outcome of arbitration. The defendant, MW Residential SoCal Corp., has submitted evidence establishing the existence of an arbitration agreement between itself and the plaintiff, Taylor Trim & Supply, Inc. The plaintiff has not filed a formal written opposition to the motion, and the judge has determined that the defendant has met its burden to show the existence of a valid arbitration clause between the parties. The judge has also determined that the plaintiff has not shown that the arbitration agreement should not be enforced. As a result, the judge has ordered the parties to proceed to arbitration, and has stayed the pending court action. An OSC re: Arbitration Status is set for a later date, and the defendant is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
