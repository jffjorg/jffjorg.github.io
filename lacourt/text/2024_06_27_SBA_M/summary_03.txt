And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has granted the defendant's demurrer to the complaint, sustaining the demurrer with 20 days leave to amend. The complaint fails to state facts sufficient to state a cause of action and is uncertain. The plaintiff's son, Ngue Mikailou, was injured at Inglewood Montessori Pre-School, and the plaintiff alleges negligence by the defendant. However, the complaint only recognizes a cause of action for negligence and fails to state facts sufficient to establish the elements of negligence, including a legal duty of care, breach of that duty, causation, and damages. The court also finds that the plaintiff has not alleged facts to support a bystander recovery theory or a direct victim theory of negligence. The plaintiff has 20 days to amend the complaint to state facts sufficient to state a cause of action.
