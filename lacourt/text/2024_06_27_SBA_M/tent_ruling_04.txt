23TRCV04151
1.     
Torrance Memorial
Medical Center’s Demurrer to Complaint  
 
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
Torrance Memorial Medical Center’s Demurrer to
Complaint is overruled. 
 
Background
 
Plaintiff’s Complaint was filed on December 15, 2023. Plaintiff
alleges the following facts. Plaintiff alleges a negligence cause of action
based on injuries suffered which were caused by Defendant on September 20,
2022. 
 
Meet and Confer
             
Defendant set forth a meet and confer declaration in
sufficient compliance with CCP § 430.41. 
(Decl. John C. Kelly.)   
 
Demurrer

A demurrer tests the sufficiency of a complaint as a
matter of law and raises only questions of law. (Schmidt v. Foundation Health
(1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 1702, 1706.)  In
testing the sufficiency of the complaint, the court must assume the truth of
(1) the properly pleaded factual allegations; (2) facts that can be reasonably
inferred from those expressly pleaded; and (3) judicially noticed matters. (Blank
v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) 
The Court may not consider contentions, deductions, or conclusions of
fact or law.  (Moore v. Conliffe
(1994) 7 Cal.App.4th 634, 638.) Because a demurrer tests the legal sufficiency
of a complaint, the plaintiff must show that the complaint alleges facts
sufficient to establish every element of each cause of action.  (Rakestraw v. California Physicians
Service (2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 39, 43.) 
Where the complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a
cause of action, courts should sustain the demurrer.  (C.C.P., § 430.10(e); Zelig v. County of
Los Angeles (2002) 27 Cal.App.4th 1112, 1126.)
 
Sufficient facts are the essential facts of the case
"with reasonable precision and with particularity sufficiently specific to
acquaint the defendant with the nature, source, and extent of his cause of
action.”  (Gressley v. Williams
(1961) 193 Cal.App.2d 636, 643-644.) 
"Whether the plaintiff will be able to prove the pleaded facts is
irrelevant to ruling upon the demurrer." 
(Stevens v. Superior Court (1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 605,
609–610.)  Under Code Civil Procedure §
430.10(f), a demurrer may also be sustained if a complaint is “uncertain.”  Uncertainty exists where a complaint’s
factual allegations are so confusing they do not sufficiently apprise a
defendant of the issues it is being asked to meet.  (Williams v. Beechnut Nutrition Corp.
(1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 135, 139, fn. 2.)
 
Defendant demurs to the Complaint pursuant to CCP § 430.10(b)
on the grounds that Plaintiff does not have the legal capacity to sue.  However, Defendant improperly relies upon
facts outside the scope of the pleading.  Namely, Defendant argues that the notice of
intent to sue letter states the name of a different patient – Charles Sandoval.
 The Court cannot consider arguments or
evidence outside the scope of the pleadings upon ruling on a demurrer. The Court
notes here the distinction between mere argument and evidence.  Thus, even if Defendant had attached the
notice of intent to sue with the demurrer, the Court could not consider this
extrinsic evidence upon ruling on a demurrer.  Additionally, Defendant argues the impropriety
of pleading punitive damages against a health care provider without first
seeking leave of court.  This argument,
however, is not a sufficient ground to sustain the demurrer since this would be
the basis for a motion to strike, not a demurrer.
 
Thus, the demurrer is overruled.
 
Defendant is ordered to file and serve an Answer
within 10 days of this date. 
 
Defendant is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
