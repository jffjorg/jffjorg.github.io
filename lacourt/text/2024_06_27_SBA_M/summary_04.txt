And here is the English text to summarize this judge's tentative ruling:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Torrance Memorial Medical Center to the Complaint filed by Merlita Q. Licaros. The demurrer was based on the argument that the plaintiff lacks legal capacity to sue and that the complaint is uncertain. However, the Court finds that the demurrer is improper because it relies on facts outside the scope of the pleadings. The Court further finds that the demurrer is not sufficient to sustain the demurrer. Therefore, the demurrer is overruled and the defendant is ordered to file and serve an Answer within 10 days.
