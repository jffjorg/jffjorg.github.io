And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying McIntosh's alternative requests for issue and evidence sanctions. The Judge found that McIntosh did not file a separate statement as required by the California Rules of Court, and even if McIntosh had filed the statement, the requested sanction would be overbroad and exceed what is required to protect McIntosh's interests. The Judge notes that the requested sanction would prevent the Plaintiff from presenting any evidence to support their conversion cause of action, which is too broad.
