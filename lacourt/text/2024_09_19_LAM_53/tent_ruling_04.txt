The court has denied McIntosh’s alternative requests for issue and evidence
sanctions on the ground that McIntosh did not file a separate statement as
required by the California Rules of Court. 
However, even if McIntosh had filed a separate statement, the court
finds that the sanction requested in connection with Plaintiff’s failure to
respond to this question (i.e., that the court “should preclude [Plaintiff]
from presenting evidence to support any allegation” in support of his
conversion cause of action) is overbroad and would exceed that which is
required to protect the interests of McIntosh as the party entitled to, but
denied, the answer to this question.
