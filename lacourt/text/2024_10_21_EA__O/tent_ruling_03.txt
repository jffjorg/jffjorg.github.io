DEFENDANTS NAVIGATOR REAL ESTATE INC. AND MINGJU ZHANG'S DEMURRER TO

Background[1]
 
This is a contracts case that arises from a lease agreement.
Plaintiffs allege that they wanted to move for a
better school for their children. Jing Pan (“Pan”) told Plaintiffs about
Mingju, who has a house for rent. Plaintiffs wrote a check to Pan, who was to
“hand it” to Mingju. “Mingju [] signed a contract with Pan [].” However, Pan
has moved into the home and will not turn the keys over to Plaintiffs. Plaintiffs
went to Pinnacle’s office wherein ‘manager Michael’ told Plaintiffs that Mingju
“bypassed the company” and signed the contract himself. 
 
On February 2, 2024, Plaintiff Zhou Chen filed suit against
Defendants NAVIGATORS REAL ESTATE INC., (“Navigators”), MINGJU ZHANG, JING PAN
(“Pan”), QINGFENG CHEN.
 
On March 15, 2024, Navigators filed a demurrer and MTS,
which the court on 5/2/24 sustained with leave to amend due to uncertainty,
rendering the MTS moot. 
 
On May 8, 2024, Plaintiff Chen and Dan Chen filed their
first amended complaint (FAC) against the same defendants.
 
On June 7, 2024, Jing Pan filed a General Denial. 
 
On June 14, 2024, Navigators and Zhang (“moving Defendants”)
filed another demurrer x MTS, which the court on July 25, 2024 sustained with
leave to amend, but struck the mental damages for $40,000 without leave to
amend. (The court did not post a tentative ruling.)
 
On August 26, 2024, Plaintiffs filed their second amended
complaint (SAC); Qingfen Chen was removed as a named defendant. 
 
On September 24, 2024, moving Defendants filed the instant
demurrer to the SAC and motion to reclassify. 
 
Discussion
To reclassify a case from unlimited to limited, a
trial court must find that the matter will necessarily result in a verdict
below the jurisdictional amount required by statute for classification as an
unlimited civil case. (Hiona v. Superior Court (2020) 48 Cal.App.5th
866, 872.) “Necessarily” means that there is “a high level of certainty that a
damage award will not exceed $25,000.” (Walker v. Superior Court (1991)
53 Cal.3d 257, 268-270.) Put simply, in making the determination to reclassify,
legal certainty is required. (Chahal v. Superior Court (1999) 73
Cal.App.4th 399, 402-403.) Per California Code of Civil Procedure section 85, the amount in controversy for purposes
of distinguishing between limited and unlimited means the amount of the demand
exclusive of attorney fees, interest and costs.
Here, Plaintiffs seek either
$16,680 or $18,690 in damages, though it is unclear. Nevertheless, as either of
those amounts is less than $35,000, the case is a limited case. Effectively,
the demurrer is MOOT.
 Conclusion
Based on the foregoing, the case is reclassified to a
limited case, which renders the demurrer moot.
