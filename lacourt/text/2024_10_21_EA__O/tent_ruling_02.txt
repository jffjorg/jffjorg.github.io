PLAINTIFF’S
NOTICE OF MOTION AND MOTION FOR APPROVAL OF PRIVATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL ACT (CAL.
LABOR CODE § 2698,  ET SEQ.) SETTLEMENT
AGREEMENT AND AWARD OF ATTORNEYS’ FEES AND COSTS, GENERAL RELEASE FEE, AND
SETTLEMENT ADMINISTRATION COSTS is GRANTED. 
 
Background
 
This is a
wage and hour action. 
 
On December
12, 2022, Plaintiff TIERRA FRANKLIN, individually, and on behalf of other
aggrieved employees pursuant to the California Private Attorneys General Act,
filed suit against Defendant POMONA HEALTHCARE & WELLNESS CENTER, LLC.  
 
On September
14, 2023, the court granted Defendant’s motion to compel arbitration of the
individual PAGA claim and stayed the non-individual/representative PAGA claims.

 
On June 12,
2024, a notice of settlement was filed.
 
On September
17, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant motion. 
 
Legal
Standard
 
Labor Code section 2699, subdivision (l)(2) states:¿“The superior court
shall review and approve any settlement of any civil action filed pursuant to
this part. The proposed settlement shall be submitted to the agency at the same
time that it is submitted to the court.”  “A copy of the superior court’s
judgment in any civil action filed pursuant to this part and any other order in
that action that either provides for or denies an award of civil penalties
under this code shall be submitted to the agency within 10 days after entry of
the judgment or order.”  (Lab. Code, §2699, subd. (l)(3).) 
 
While PAGA requires court review and approval of settlements, it does not
specify the standard or criteria for such review. (Moniz v. Adecco USA, Inc.
(2021) 72 Cal.App.5th 56, 75 (Moniz).) Thus, courts have generally
applied the same review standards used for class actions, which inquire
“independently whether a PAGA settlement is fair and reasonable.” (Id.,
at p. 77.) To determine if a PAGA settlement is fair and reasonable, courts
consider factors “including the strength of the plaintiff's case, the risk, the
stage of the proceeding, the complexity and likely duration of further
litigation, and the settlement amount.” (Ibid.) Lastly, courts will also
consider if the settlement is “adequate in view of PAGA's purposes to remediate
present labor law violations, deter future ones, and to maximize enforcement of
state labor laws.” (Ibid.)
 
Discussion
 
Plaintiff moves for court approval of PAGA settlement pursuant to Labor
Code section 2699, subdivision (l)(2). The total Settlement
amount is for $351,862.00. The Net Settlement Amount will be the Total
Settlement Amount less the following amounts: (1) Attorneys’ Fees and Costs
consisting of attorneys’ fees of $123,151.70 and reimbursement of litigation
costs and expenses of $2,929.15 to Plaintiff’s Counsel; (2) General Release Fee
of $15,000.00 to Plaintiff; and (3) Settlement Administration Costs of up to
$7,500.00 to Phoenix Settlement Administrators. Seventy-five percent (75%) of
the Net Settlement Amount (or approximately $152,460.86) will be distributed to
the LWDA (i.e., LWDA Payment) and twenty-five percent (25%) of the Net
Settlement Amount (or approximately $50,820.29) (i.e., Employees’ Portion) will
be distributed to the Aggrieved Employees on a pro rata basis, based on their
Compensable Pay Periods.
 
Here, the court finds no defects with the application.  
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the
foregoing, the motion is granted. (A proposed order has been filed.)
