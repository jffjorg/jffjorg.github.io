And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is regarding a motion to enforce a settlement agreement between the plaintiff, Rebecca Castillo, and the defendant, Uptown Koop, LLC. The settlement agreement was reached in November 2023 and provides for a payment of $11,000 to the plaintiff. However, due to the defendant's default, the plaintiff has not been able to collect the settlement amount. The Judge notes that the settlement agreement was signed by both parties and provides for enforcement pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure ยง664.6(a).

The Judge concludes that the motion is pending but likely to be granted if the defendant's default is set aside. The Judge notes that entering into a settlement agreement is tantamount to participating in litigation, and the defendant's failure to participate in the litigation has prevented the plaintiff from enforcing the settlement agreement.
