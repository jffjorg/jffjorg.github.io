And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the plaintiff's motion for approval of the Private Attorneys General Act (PAGA) settlement. The total settlement amount is $351,862.00, which will be distributed to the Labor and Workforce Development Agency (LWDA) and the aggrieved employees on a pro rata basis. The court has reviewed the settlement and finds it fair and reasonable, considering factors such as the strength of the plaintiff's case, the risk, and the complexity of the proceeding. The court has also considered whether the settlement is adequate in view of PAGA's purposes to remediate present labor law violations, deter future ones, and maximize enforcement of state labor laws. The judge has granted the motion and a proposed order has been filed.
