2.              
Plaintiff
Elinton Gramajo’s Motion for Attorney’s Fees and Costs is GRANTED in part. Fees

I.               
BACKGROUND
 
            On February 20, 2018, Plaintiff
Elinton Gramajo (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against his former employer Defendant
Joe’s Pizza On Sunset Inc.[1] (“Joe’s
Pizza”) asserting various wage and hour violations. 
 
            On March 23, 2018, Joe’s Pizza filed
an answer to Plaintiff’s complaint. 
 
            On June 17, 2019, Plaintiff filed a
First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) adding Giuseppe Vitale (“Vitale”) as a
defendant. 
 
            On November 1, 2019, Defendants Joe’s
Pizza and Vitale (“Defendants”) filed an answer to Plaintiff’s FAC. 
 
            On January 21, 2020, Defendants
filed an amended answer to Plaintiff’s FAC. 
 
            From October 12, 2021 to October 19,
2021, the court held a jury trial in this matter.
 
On February 22, 2022, the
court entered judgment in this matter. 
 
On
April 29, 2022, Defendants filed an appeal on the judgment.
            
            On May 10, 2022, the court denied Plaintiff’s
Motion for Attorney’s Fees (“First Motion for Attorney’s Fees”). 
 
            On May 12, 2022, Defendants
abandoned their appeal filed on April 29, 2022. 
 
            On June 28, 2022, the court granted Defendants’
Motion to Tax Costs against Plaintiff. 
 
            On July 7, 2022, Plaintiff filed an
appeal on the court’s May 10, 2022 order denying Plaintiff’s Motion for
Attorney’s Fees and June 28, 2022 order granting Defendants’ Motion to Tax
Costs. 
 
            On July 16, 2024, the Appellate Court
reversed the court’s orders denying Plaintiff’s Motion for Attorney’s Fees and
granting Defendants’ Motion to Tax Costs, remanding the matter to the trial
court. 
 
            On August 19, 2024, Plaintiff filed
this Motion to Set Hearing on Plaintiff’s Motion for Attorney’s Fees and Costs.
On August 28, 2024, Joe’s Pizza filed an opposition. On September 6, 2024,

II.            
MOTION TO SET HEARING ON PLAINTIFF’S MOTION
FOR ATTORNEY’S FEES AND COSTS
 
A.             
Legal Standard
 
            If a prior appellate opinion
expressly ruled upon a party’s entitlement to attorney fees, the trial court is
bound to follow the appellate court’s expressions on the subject, under
principles of law of the case. (Benson v. Greitzer (1990) 220 Cal.App.3d
11, 14; Auto Equity Sales, Inc. v. Superior Court (1962) 57 Cal.2d 450,
455; Bach v. County of Butte (1989) 215 Cal.App.3d 294, 308-309.)
 
B.             
Discussion
 
            Plaintiff appealed the court’s May 10, 2022 order denying Plaintiff’s First Motion
for Attorney’s Fees and June 28, 2022 order granting Defendants’ Motion to Tax
Costs. (Motion to Set Hearing, at p. 1.) The appellate court reversed
both orders and remanded the matter for the trial court to determine
Plaintiff’s reasonable fee and costs award. (Ibid.) Plaintiff now moves
the court to make these determinations, in one hearing, based on the full
briefing provided for the two related motions. (Id., at p. 2.) 
 
            In opposition, Defendants argue that although Plaintiff may
stand on his pleadings submitted prior to appeal, Defendants have a statutory
and due process right to file new oppositions. (Opp., 1.) 
 
            In
reply, Plaintiff argues that the appellate court did not order further briefing
on either issue. (Reply, at p.1.) Plaintiff also contends that Defendants did
not cite any authority to argue that additional briefing is required. (Ibid.)

 
            As the court must give full deference
to the Court of Appeals’ decision, the court finds that the issues remanded on
appeal must be determined through review of the fully briefed motions filed
subject to appeal. The appellate court did not instruct the court otherwise. Below
are the court’s findings regarding Plaintiff’s requested attorney’s fees and
costs.   
 
III.          
MOTION FOR ATTORNEY’S FEES AND COSTS 
 
A.             
Legal Standard
 
            A prevailing party is entitled to
recover its attorney’s fees when authorized by contract, statute, or law. (See
CCP § 1033.5(a)(10); Civ. Code § 1717(a).) “A successful party means a
prevailing party, and [a party] may be considered prevailing parties for
attorney’s fees purposes if they succeed on any significant issue in litigation
which achieves some of the benefit the parties sought in bringing suit.” (Bowman
v. City of Berkeley (2005) 131 Cal.App.4th 173, 178.)
 
B.             
Discussion
 
1.              
The Parties’ Arguments
 
            Plaintiff moves the court to award
him $323,852.84, which is comprised of $148,460.00 in attorney’s fees actually
incurred lodestar attorney time billed, $26,932.84 in costs and expenses
associated with litigation, and $148,460.00 in a lodestar multiplier of 2.0.
(First Motion for Attorney’s Fees, at p. 10; Memorandum of Costs, at p. 1.) Plaintiff
argues that Labor Code section 1194 entitles the award. (First Motion for
Attorney’s Fees, at p. 10.) 
 
            In opposition, Defendants argue that
Plaintiff’s request for attorney’s fees and costs should be denied for failure
to recover a judgment above the jurisdictional limit under Code of Civil
Procedure section 1033(a). (Opp., at p. 5; Motion to Tax Costs, at pp. 7-12.) Additionally,
Defendants argue that Plaintiff’s request is excessive in that Plaintiff’s
counsel’s hourly rate is perjured, Plaintiff’s counsel’s hours are
unreasonable, and there is no basis to award a multiplier. (Opp., at pp.
10-16.) 
 
            In reply, Plaintiff argues that receiving
a judgment less than $25,000.00 does not preempt Plaintiff from recovering
reasonable attorney’s fees and costs in an unlimited jurisdiction court as
Labor Code section 1194(a) controls over Code of Civil Procedure section
1033(a). (Reply, at pp. 4-10.) In addition, Plaintiff argues that his requested
attorney’s fees and costs are reasonable. (Id., at pp. 10-11.) 
 
            As an initial matter, on appeal, the
appellate court held that “employees who prevail in actions to recover unpaid
minimum and overtime wages are entitled to their reasonable litigation costs
under Labor Code section 1194, subdivision (a), irrespective of the amount
recovered.” (Remittitur B322697 and B323024, at p. 2.) The appellate court also
held that “Labor Code section 1194, subdivision (a), controls” over Code of
Civil Procedure section 1033. (Ibid., at p. 9.) As such, Defendants’
argument that Plaintiff’s request for attorney’s fees and costs should be
denied for failure to recover a judgment above the jurisdictional limit under
Code of Civil Procedure section 1033(a) is disregarded. The court follows the
appellate court’s instructions of reversing the trial court’s previous orders denying Plaintiff’s First Motion for
Attorney’s Fees and order granting Defendants’ Motion to Tax Costs, and
remanding the matter for the court to determine a “reasonable” award of
attorney’s fees and costs to Plaintiff. (Ibid., at p. 17.)
 
2.              
Authority for Fees & Prevailing Party
 
a.               
Legal Standard 
 
            Labor Code section 1194, subdivision
(a) provides that “[n]otwithstanding any agreement to work for a lesser wage,
any employee receiving less than the legal minimum wage or the legal overtime
compensation applicable to the employee is entitled to recover in a civil
action the unpaid balance of the full amount of this minimum wage or overtime
compensation, including interest thereon, reasonable attorney's fees, and costs
of suit.” (Cal. Lab. Code § 1194(a).) 
 
b.              
Discussion 
 
            Here, the court found that Plaintiff
prevailed in his claims for wage and
hour violations. (Judgment, filed on February 22, 2022.) Accordingly, as the
prevailing party on unpaid minimum and overtime wages, Plaintiff is entitled to
reasonable attorney’s fees. (Remittitur B322697 and B323024, at p. 2.)
 
3.              
Method of Calculation for Fees 
 
            Plaintiff uses the lodestar
adjustment method to calculate his request for attorney’s fees. (First Motion
for Attorney’s Fees, at p. 5.) 
 
            Defendants do not dispute using the
lodestar method nor propose a different method. 
 
            The court uses the lodestar
adjustment method to calculate fees.
 
4.              
Reasonableness of the Fees Claimed
 
a.               
Reasonableness of the Hourly Rates
 
                                                                            
i.                   
Legal Standard 
 
            “The courts repeatedly have stated
that the trial court is in the best position to value the services rendered by
the attorneys in his or her courtroom, and this includes the determination of
the hourly rate that will be used in the lodestar calculus. In making its
calculation, the court may rely on its own knowledge and familiarity with the
legal market, as well as the experience, skill, and reputation of the attorney
requesting fees, the difficulty or complexity of the litigation to which that
skill was applied, and affidavits from other attorneys regarding prevailing
fees in the community and rate determinations in other cases.” (569 East
County Boulevard LLC v. Backcountry Against the Dump, Inc. (2016) 6
Cal.App.5th 426, 437, citations omitted.) 
 
                                                                          
ii.                   
Discussion 
 
            Counsel for Plaintiff, Alfredo Nava (“Nava”),
has an hourly rate of $650.00 per hour. (Nava Decl., ¶ 4.) Nava graduated from
Stanford University School of Law and has practiced law as an attorney for over
10 years. (Id., ¶ 6.) Nava declares that his hourly rate is in line with
comparable hourly rates under the Laffey matrix. (Ibid.) 
 
            In opposition, Defendants argue that
Plaintiff’s counsel had previously declared that his hourly rate is $350.00 per
hour. (Opp., at pp. 11-12.) Nevertheless, Defendants still contend that a reasonable
hourly rate here should be $0 and at most $15.00 per hour due to quality of
work rendered and legal work performed by Plaintiff’s counsel. (Ibid.)
 
            In reply, Plaintiff concedes that
Nava had previously indicated that $350.00 was his billing rate, however, Nava
now requests a $650.00 hourly rate as he entitled to the market rate value for
his services. (Reply, at pp. 10-11.)
 
            After considering the information
provided, the court finds that the appropriate hourly rate for Counsel Alfredo
Nava is $350.00/hr according to Nava’s previous representations to the court of
his hourly rate. (Linde Decl., ¶ 17, Exh. 9.)  
 
b.              
Reasonableness of the Number of Hours
 
                                                                            
i.                   
Legal Standard 
 
            “Under the lodestar adjustment
methodology, the trial court must initially determine the actual time expended
and then ascertain whether under all the circumstances¿of the case the amount
of actual time expended and the monetary charge being made for the time
expended are reasonable. Factors to be considered include, but are not limited
to, the complexity of the case and procedural demands, the attorney skill
exhibited and the results achieved. The prevailing party and fee applicant
bears the burden of showing that the fees incurred were reasonably necessary
to¿the conduct of the litigation, and were reasonable in amount. It follows
that if the prevailing party fails to meet this burden, and the court finds the
time expended or amount charged is not reasonable under the circumstances, then
the court must take this into account and award attorney fees in a lesser
amount.” (Mikhaeilpoor v. BMW of N. Am., LLC (2020) 48 Cal.App.5th 240,
247 [cleaned up].) 
 
                                                                          
ii.                   
Discussion 
 
            Counsel Nava claims that 228.40
total hours were incurred in litigating this matter over four years. (First
Motion for Attorney’s Fees, at p. 6; Nava Decl., ¶ 4.) 
 
            In opposition, Defendants argue that
Plaintiff’s counsel’s hours are excessive. (Opp., at p. 12.) Defendants argue
that this case did not present any complex issues, that this case was
over-litigated, and that the judgment is disproportionate to the size of the
fees requested. (Ibid.) Defendants contend that Plaintiff’s counsel’s
hours should be reduced from 228.40 hours to 112.70 hours. (Ibid.)
 
            In reply, Plaintiff continues to
argue that the requested attorney’s fees are reasonable. (Reply, at pp. 10-11.)
 
            In this case, the declaration
provided by Plaintiff’s counsel is sufficient to meet the burden of proving the
reasonableness of the claimed fees in terms of amounts and tasks. To satisfy
this burden, evidence and descriptions of billable tasks must be presented in
sufficient detail, enabling the court to evaluate whether the case was
overstaffed, the time attorneys spent on specific claims, and the
reasonableness of the hours expended. (Lunada Biomedical v. Nunez (2014)
230 Cal.App.4th 459, 486-487.)
 
            Plaintiff’s fee recovery is based on
228.40 hours Plaintiff’s counsel spent litigating this case through the jury
trial. (Nava Decl., ¶ 4.) The fees incurred are reasonable, as captured in the
billing entries submitted. Plaintiff’s counsel’s billing records reflect the
actual time and descriptions of services performed in connection with
litigating this case. Although the submission of such detailed time records is
not necessary under California law, if submitted, such records “are entitled to
credence in the absence of a clear indication the records are erroneous.” (Horsford
v. Board of Trustees of California State University (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th
359, 396.)
 
            Defendants’ objections to
Plaintiff’s counsel’s billing entries are not sufficient to meet their burden
to challenge Plaintiff’s fee request as they provide no authority to support the
argument that Plaintiff’s counsel’s hours should be reduced. 
 
            Accordingly, the court grants
Plaintiff’s requested attorney’s fees in the reduced amount of $79,940.00 for
228.40 hours at $350.00 per hour.  
 
a.               
Reasonableness of Multiplier 
 
                                                                        
iii.                   
Legal Standard 
 
            Relevant
factors to determine whether an enhancement is appropriate include (1) the
novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in
presenting them, (3) the extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded
other employment by the attorneys, (4) the contingent nature of the fee award.
(Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1132.)
 
            The
contingent risks, preclusion of other work, skill, and difficulty counsel
assert are absorbed by counsel’s hourly rates. (Robertson v. Fleetwood
Travel Trailers of California Inc. (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 785, 822.)
 
                                                                        
iv.                   
Discussion 
 
            Plaintiff argues that since this
case was taken on a contingency fee basis without any assurances of recovery,
the fee rate requested must be adjusted to reflect such risks. (First Motion
for Attorney’s Fees, at p. 9.) As such, Plaintiff requests that a multiplier of
2.0 be applied to the combined lodestar of $148,460.00 for a total award of
attorney’s fees in the amount of $296,920.00. (Id., at p. 10.) 
 
            In opposition, Defendants argue that
there is no basis to award a multiplier as Plaintiff does not argue that any of
the factors weigh in favor of a multiplier as this case did not present any
difficult issues. (Opp., at p. 16.) 
 
            In reply, Plaintiff does not address
Defendants’ arguments against the multiplier. 
 
            The court denies Plaintiff’s request
for a 2.0 lodestar multiplier. Given the routine work done in this case and the
results obtained, a multiplier is not appropriate. Any contingency risk factor
is already accounted for in the hourly rate of $350.00 per hour, which the court
has found to be reasonable. 
 
5.              
Reasonableness of the Costs Claimed 
 
            Plaintiff lists $26,932.84 in costs
and expenses as seen evidenced in Plaintiff’s Memorandum of Costs. (Memorandum
of Costs, at p. 1.)
 
            Defendants filed a Motion to Tax
Costs against Plaintiff’s Memorandum of Costs arguing that Plaintiff has not
provided enough information to determine if his claimed costs are proper.
(Motion to Tax Costs, at p. 16.) Additionally, Defendants argue that multiple individual
costs requested by Plaintiff should be taxed under Code of Civil Procedure
section 1033.5. (Id., at pp. 16-19.) 
 
            The
court notes that as a prevailing party, Plaintiff can obtain costs pursuant to Labor
Code section 1194(a). Accordingly, the court finds that all of these costs are reasonable and allowable under at least one of the
cost statutes. 
 
            The
court will award $26,932.84 in costs and expenses.  
 
IV.          
CONCLUSION
 
Plaintiff’s Motion To
Set Hearing On Plaintiff’s Motion For Attorney’s Fees And Costs is GRANTED.  Further, Plaintiff’s Motion for Attorney’s
Fees and Costs is GRANTED in part. Fees and costs are AWARDED in favor of
Plaintiff and against Defendants, jointly and severally, in the reduced amount
of $106,872.84, comprised of $79,940.00 in attorney’s fees and $26,932.84 in costs and expenses.
