And here is a brief English summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by State Farm General Insurance Company (Defendant) to the First Amended Complaint (FAC) filed by Evelyn D. Childress (Plaintiff). The Court finds that the FAC fails to state a claim against Defendant and that Plaintiff has not shown a reasonable possibility of amendment. The demurrer is sustained without leave to amend. The Court also finds that Defendant's demurrer is not defective due to a lack of meet and confer process, and that Plaintiff's claims of breach of contract and liability are without merit.
