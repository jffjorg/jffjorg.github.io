          Plaintiff SK
& Company, Inc. (“Plaintiff”) seeks a default judgment against defendants
Devil & Angel Temple City, Inc. and Derk Cha (“Cha”) (collectively,
“Defendants”) in the amount of $67,600.71, consisting of $66,660.71 as demanded
in the complaint and $1,100 in costs. Item 6a(2) on the proposed judgment (Form
JUD-100) is checked for prejudgment interest at 7%, but no amount sought is
identified. Therefore, the Court GRANTS a default judgment in the amount of
$67,600.71, which is the sum of the identified damages and costs in Items 6a(1)
and 6a(4). If Plaintiff believes that a greater amount is warranted, Plaintiff
may request a continuance and submit supporting documents no later than 10 days
before the date of the next hearing. 
Dated
this 1st
day of November, 2023
