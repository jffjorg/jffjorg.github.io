 Case Number:  23STCV14348    Hearing Date:   January 23, 2024    Dept:  55  
NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS:
 Defendants’ Motion to Compel Arbitration
and Dismiss This Matter or, In The Alternative, Stay Proceedings Pending the
Completion of Arbitration [CCP §§ 1281.2 & 1281.4].
 
The motion is denied.
Background
Plaintiff 6524 HOLLYWOOD ASSOCIATES, LLC (“Plaintiff”)
alleges Defendants breached the 2005 lease agreement with Plaintiff by failing
to pay the agreed-upon rent starting in May 2023, and also breached the 2011 guarantee
agreement with regards to the lease.       
Defendants 1650 SCHRAEDER BLVD., LLC and SBE
RESTAURANT GROUP, LLC (“Defendants”) have filed a motion to compel arbitration
and stay this case pending the arbitration. Plaintiff opposes the motion. 
Legal Standard
Under CCP § 1281.2, the party moving to compel
arbitration bears the burden of demonstrating that “an agreement to arbitrate
the controversy exists.” “With respect to the moving party’s burden to provide
evidence of the existence of an agreement to arbitrate, it is generally
sufficient for that party to present a copy of the contract to the court.” Baker
v. Italian Maple Holdings, LLC (2017) 13 Cal.App.5th 1152, 1160. “Once such
a document is presented to the court, the burden shifts to the party opposing
the motion to compel, who may present any challenges to the enforcement of the agreement
and evidence in support of those challenges.” (Id.)
Analysis
Defendants seek to compel arbitration based on two
parts of the lease agreement. Paragraph 49 of the Lease is a form that has a
box to check in front of the word “is” and in front of the phrase “is not” in
the following statement, “[a]n addendum requiring the Mediation and/or the
Arbitration of all disputes between the Parties and/or Brokers arising out of
the Lease is/is not attached to the Lease.” (Compl., Ex. A, ¶ 49). The box next
to “is” is checked. Paragraph 58 of the Addendum to the lease, provides, in
relevant part:
ARBITRATION: IF A
CONTROVERSY OR CLAIM BETWEEN THE PARTIES ARISES OUT OF, OR AS IT RELATES TO
THE DISPOSITION OF THE LESSEE’S DEPOSIT OR A CLAIM OF MISUNDERSTANDING AGAINST
ANY PARTY TO THIS TRANSACTION … SUCH ARBITRATION SHALL BE DETERMINED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH THE RULES OF THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION… 
(Compl., Ex. A, ¶ 58 (emphasis added).)
 
The Court agrees with Plaintiff that this arbitration
agreement cannot be interpreted to cover the claims in the Complaint regarding
unpaid rent. Doubts or ambiguities regarding the scope of arbitration
provisions are not resolved in favor of arbitrability, where the provisions “do
not exist or were so poorly drafted that another party cannot be presumed to
have agreed to them.”  Thompson v.
Toll Dublin, LLC (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 1360, 1370. Such is the case here.
The lease mentions arbitration in two locations, which are seemingly
inconsistent. The form paragraph 49 is not worded as a stand-alone arbitration
agreement, because it lacks all material terms. Instead, Paragraph 49 merely
incorporates-by-reference paragraph 58 in the Addendum, which directly
contradicts Paragraph 49’s description of an arbitration agreement as to all
disputes about the transaction.  The
specific paragraph 58 references narrow and unique topics for arbitration,
i.e., claims arising out of the lessee’s deposit disposition or a claim of
misunderstanding. These topics clearly do not include an action for allegedly
unpaid rent as in this case. 
Defendants’ briefs simply ignore the specific language
in Paragraph 58 listing the specific types of claims covered in the arbitration
agreement. But the Court finds that this specific language in Paragraph 58 limits
the scope of the arbitration agreement because particular contract provisions
control over general ones where they are inconsistent.  Thompson v. Toll Dublin, LLC (2008)
165 Cal.App.4th 1360, 1370.  Accord  Brady v. Bayer Corp. (2018) 26 Cal.
App. 5th 1156, 1178  (citing Civ. C., §
3534 (as to contract and statutory interpretation, specific language controls
over the general)).
The Court therefore denies the motion.
