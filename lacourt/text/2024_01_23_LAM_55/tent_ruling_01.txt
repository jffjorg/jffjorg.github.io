  Case Number:  20STCV25574    Hearing Date:   January 23, 2024    Dept:  55  
NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS:  Motion of Defendant Ezra Ozer for Leave to
File an Amended Cross-Complaint.
 
The motion is denied. 

 
Background
Plaintiffs MAYFLOWER REMODELERS, INC. (“Mayflower”) and
BUILDERS OF AMERICA, INC. (“Builders”) (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) bring this
case against Defendants EZRA OZ OZER, SKY HIGH BUILDERS, INC., SAFE-WAY
CONSTRUCTION, INC., and VENICE 770 BH, LLC (“Defendants”) alleging Defendants fraudulently
obtained loans and additionally misappropriated funds from Plaintiffs. 
On 8/13/2020, Plaintiffs got default entered against
Defendants. On 8/25/2020, Defendant Ozer, individually and derivatively on
behalf of Builders and Mayflower (“Defendant”), filed a Cross-Complaint against
Plaintiffs as well as HILDA COMBS, alleging that Combs improperly took control
of Builders and diverted its funds to herself and asserting claims for conversion,
civil theft, and removal of Hilda Coms as director (declaratory relief). The
Cross-Complaint was never served. On 1/20/2023, the Court set aside the
defaults against Defendants and dismissed the Cross-Complaint, pursuant to the
parties’ stipulation. 
Defendant has now filed a motion requesting leave to
file an Amended Cross-Complaint against Plaintiffs and Ms. Combs with claims
for (1) Fraud; (2) Conversion; and (3) Declaratory Relief. Plaintiffs oppose
the motion. 
Legal Standard
A defendant who “fails” to plead a compulsory cross-complaint
may seek leave from the court to file or amend a cross-complaint. CCP § 426.50.
The court must grant leave to file such a compulsory cross-complaint “unless
bad faith of the moving party is demonstrated.” Silver Organizations Ltd. v.
Frank (1990) 217 Cal. App. 3d 94, 99.
Apart from the statute governing compulsory cross-complaints,
courts may allow a party to amend a pleading in the furtherance of justice. CCP
§ 473(a). “If discovery and investigation develop factual grounds justifying a
timely amendment to a pleading, leave to amend must be liberally granted.”  Mabie v. Hyatt (1998) 61 Cal.App.4th
581, 596.

The Court, however, has the discretion to deny leave
to amend if it finds the party’s delay in presenting the amendment was
unwarranted, or when it determines that the other party will be prejudiced due
to needing more discovery or delay of the trial. Miles v. City of Los
Angeles (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th 728, 739. Solit v. Tokai Bank (1999)
68 Cal. App. 4th 1435, 1448. A party filing a motion for leave to amend a
pleading must comply with California Rule of Court 3.1324, including submitting
a declaration specifying the effect of the amendment, why the amendment is
necessary and proper, when the facts giving rise to the amended allegations
were discovered, and why the request for amendment was not made earlier. CRC
3.1324(b).  
“When a trial court denies leave to amend, the
decision has been upheld on grounds such as …  the conduct of the moving party or belated
presentation of the amendment.”  Atkinson
v. Elk Corp. (2003) 109 Cal. App. 4th 739, 759.  
Analysis
Defendant seeks to file the Amended Cross-Complaint
under CCP § 426.50, arguing that the claims in the Amended Cross-Complaint are
compulsory and that Plaintiffs have not and cannot show bad faith on the part
of Defendant in seeking to amend the Cross-Complaint. The Court concludes that CCP
§ 426.50 is not the proper statute to analyze Defendant’s request because
Defendant did not “fail” to plead the related causes of action prior to the
instant request. The Amended Cross-Complaint attached to the motion changes one
cause of action from the Cross-Complaint (alleging fraud instead of civil theft)
but both pleadings allege the same conduct by Combs. Defendant chose to dismiss
the Cross-Complaint; he did not “fail” to plead related causes of action. See
Crocker Nat Bank v. Emerald (1990) 221 Cal. App. 3d 852, 863 (concluding
that defendant had not “failed” to plead related claims under section 426.50
when the claims had been dismissed in prior demurrer). 
The request to amend the Cross-Complaint therefore is
analyzed under CCP § 473(a). The declaration by Defendant’s counsel does not
state what Defendants discovered since the time of the filing of the Answer and
Cross-Complaint that would give rise to the claims alleged in the Amended
Cross-Complaint, let alone when such facts were discovered or why Defendant
waited until October 2023 to seek leave to amend. In contrast, the declaration by
Plaintiff’s counsel states that Defendant has not received any information during
the case that he did not know at the time of the filing of the Answer and
Cross-Complaint.  (Latter Decl., ¶ 9.) 
In addition, in August 2023 the Court granted Plaintiffs’
unopposed ex parte request to continue trial to 03/11/2024 (8/18/23
Minutes). Defendant did not tell the Court it intended to seek to amend the
Cross-Complaint at that time and did not oppose Plaintiffs’ request for a
six-month trial continuance. Permitting an amendment to assert claims Defendant
could have (and did) assert earlier would prejudice Plaintiffs given that trial
is in less than two months. (Latter Decl., ¶ 11.) For all these reasons, the
Court concludes that Defendant has not made a sufficient showing to warrant
relief under CCP § 473(a). The Court therefore exercises its discretion and
denies the motion.
