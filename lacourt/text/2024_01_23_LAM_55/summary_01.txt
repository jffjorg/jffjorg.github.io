And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Defendant Ezra Ozer's motion for leave to file an Amended Cross-Complaint against Plaintiffs Mayflower Remodelers, Inc. and Builders of America, Inc. The Amended Cross-Complaint alleges claims of fraud, conversion, and declaratory relief against the Plaintiffs and Hilda Combs. The judge concludes that the request to amend the Cross-Complaint is not justified under CCP § 426.50, as Defendant Ozer did not "fail" to plead related causes of action prior to the instant request. Instead, the request is analyzed under CCP § 473(a), which allows a party to amend a pleading in the furtherance of justice. However, the judge finds that Defendant Ozer has not made a sufficient showing to warrant relief under CCP § 473(a), as he has not explained what new facts he has discovered since the time of the filing of the Answer and Cross-Complaint that would give rise to the claims alleged in the Amended Cross-Complaint. Additionally, the judge notes that permitting the amendment would prejudice the Plaintiffs, who are scheduled to go to trial in less than two months.
