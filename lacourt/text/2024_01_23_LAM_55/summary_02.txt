And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting Defendant/Cross-Complainant Las Palmas Silver, LLC's motion for leave to amend its cross-complaint. The amendment seeks to add Noe Posada and Luis Posada as ROE Cross-Defendants and to add a cause of action for piercing the corporate veil against all Cross-Defendants. The Judge finds that Defendant/Cross-Complainant has met its burden of showing the effect of the proposed amendment and that it recently learned the facts giving rise to the alter ego additions through discovery in June 2023. The Judge also finds that the delay in seeking the amendment was excusable, as the attorney for Defendant/Cross-Complainant substituted into the case in November 2022 and discovery in the case proceeded slowly. The Judge further finds that the statute of limitations does not bar the claims in the proposed amended Cross-Complaint. The motion is granted, and Defendant/Cross-Complainant may serve and file the proposed amended cross-complaint as a separate document within 10 days.
