Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

On January 23, 2024, the judge issued a tentative ruling on the defendants' motion to compel arbitration and dismiss the case. The judge denied the motion, finding that the arbitration agreement in the lease agreement does not cover the plaintiff's claims for unpaid rent. The judge concluded that the language in paragraphs 49 and 58 of the lease agreement is inconsistent and ambiguous, and therefore, doubts or ambiguities regarding the scope of arbitration provisions are not resolved in favor of arbitrability. The judge found that the specific language in paragraph 58 of the addendum limits the scope of the arbitration agreement to specific topics, such as claims arising out of the lessee's deposit disposition or a claim of misunderstanding, which do not include an action for allegedly unpaid rent.
