And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the petition to approve the compromise of a disputed claim of a minor (Kimberly Gonzalez Rayo, age 6). The court finds the settlement to be reasonable, but several issues prevent the granting of the petition at this time. First, the court is unclear why the petition requests that the settlement funds be deposited into a blocked account when the claimant's parent can check off a different box to request the funds. Second, the court orders the claimant's parent to provide a declaration of written assurance if the settlement funds are to be delivered to them. Third, the court is unclear why there is an order to deposit the funds into a blocked account. As a result, the hearing is continued for 60 days, and counsel is ordered to file a new petition and proposed orders correcting the defects identified above. If the petition is not corrected, the court will set a trial date.
