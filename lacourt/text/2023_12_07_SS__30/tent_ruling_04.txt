Plaintiff Inger Lorre-Wening is ordered to provide responses without objection to Defendant’s request for form interrogatories within 20 days of this order.  Defendant’s request for sanctions is DENIED.  Moving party to give notice.DiscussionOn July 28, 2023, Defendant served Form Interrogatories, Set One on Plaintiff. (Thacker Decl., ¶ 2; Exh. A.) Responses were due on or before August 29, 2023. To date, responses have not been provided. (Id., ¶ 4.)As Defendant properly served discovery requests and Plaintiff has failed to serve responses, the Court finds Defendant is entitled to a court order directing Plaintiff to provide verified responses without objections to the discovery requests served on Plaintiffs. Therefore, the motion is granted.Defendant also requests sanctions. Code of Civil Procedure § 2030.290(c) allows for sanctions when the motion was unsuccessfully opposed. Here, as the motion was not opposed, the request for sanctions is denied.Defendant’s request for sanctions under CCP section 2023.010 for the misuse of discovery is also denied, as "sections 2023.010 and 2023.030 do not independently authorize the trial court to impose monetary sanctions for misuse of discovery.” (City of Los Angeles v. PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLC (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 466, 504.)
