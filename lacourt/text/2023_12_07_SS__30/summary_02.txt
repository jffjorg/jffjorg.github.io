And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has tentatively ruled that the Plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal of the case is denied. The case was dismissed on February 6, 2023, due to the Plaintiff's failure to appear for an Order to Show Cause. The Plaintiff has moved to set aside the dismissal, arguing that it was due to extrinsic mistake, specifically a computer crash and calendar system glitches that prevented their legal assistant from filing the motion on time. The Judge holds that the Plaintiff has not shown that they were prevented from participating in the action, and that they failed to articulate a satisfactory excuse for not presenting a defense. Additionally, the Judge finds that the Plaintiff did not demonstrate diligence in seeking to set aside the dismissal. As a result, the Judge denies the motion to set aside the dismissal.
