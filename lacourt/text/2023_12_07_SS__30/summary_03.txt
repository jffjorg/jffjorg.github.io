And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, James J. Elist, M.D., moves to compel the plaintiff, Ronald Duette, to arbitrate his claims. The defendant argues that the plaintiff signed valid and enforceable arbitration agreements on May 11, 2018, February 7, 2019, February 8, 2019, and July 22, 2019. The arbitration agreements cover all claims against the physician and provide that any disputes arising out of the medical services rendered shall be determined by submission to arbitration.

The court has reviewed the evidence and finds that the defendant has met his burden to show the existence of a valid arbitration agreement between the parties. The court also finds that the plaintiff's claims for medical malpractice, lack of informed consent, lack of consent, and negligent misrepresentation all arise out of the medical services rendered and fall within the scope of the arbitration agreement.

Therefore, the court grants the defendant's motion to compel arbitration and stays the proceedings pending the outcome of the arbitration. The moving party is ordered to give notice of the stay. The court also grants the defendant's request for judicial notice of the complaint in this matter under Evidence Code section 452(d).
