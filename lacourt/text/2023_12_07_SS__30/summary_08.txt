And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in case 23STCV13400. After reviewing the legal file, the court determined that the action was erroneously filed as a personal injury matter. As a result, the court has ordered the action to be referred to the Master Calendar Department, Department 1, for review and determination on whether the case should be reassigned to an independent calendar court. The hearing on the motion to strike, previously scheduled for December 7, 2023, has been vacated and will be reset and notified by the receiving court. The court has also ordered that all hearings currently set in Department 30 of the Spring Street Courthouse be taken off calendar and reset by the receiving court. Notice of the referral has been posted on the court's website, and the judicial assistant is directed to give notice to the plaintiff, who must then notify all parties of record.
