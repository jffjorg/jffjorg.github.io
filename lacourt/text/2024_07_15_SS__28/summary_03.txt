Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication filed by the defendants. The judge has denied the motion, finding that there are triable issues of fact on the issues of whether the parking lot was a dangerous condition and whether the allegedly dangerous condition caused the accident. The judge has also found that there is a triable issue of fact on the loss of consortium claim. The judge has ordered the moving parties to give notice of the ruling and to file proof of service with the court within five days.
