And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge rules that the plaintiff's motion to reconsider, set aside, or vacate the court's January 4, 2024 and April 9, 2024 orders is denied. The court finds that the plaintiff's counsel's mistakes and excusable neglect do not constitute grounds for relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b). The court also finds that the Discovery Act provides analogous relief for the plaintiff's failure to comply with court orders, and therefore the court's orders cannot be set aside. The court denies the motion and orders the moving party to give notice of this ruling.
