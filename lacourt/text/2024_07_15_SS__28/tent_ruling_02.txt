 Case Number:  21STCV16121    Hearing Date:   July 15, 2024    Dept:  28 Having considered the moving, opposition, and reply  papers, the Court rules as follows.  BACKGROUND  On April 28, 2021, Plaintiff Joshua Olaoniye  (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendants Goldenvoice, LLC  (“Goldenvoice”), AEG Presents, LLC (“AEG”), Apex Security Group, Inc. (“Apex”),  and Does 1-50 for negligence and battery.  On October 11, 2022, Apex filed an answer.  On October 31, 2022, Plaintiff filed a first amended  complaint against the same defendants for negligence, battery and false  imprisonment.  On February 1, 2023, the Court sustained Apex’s  demurrer to Plaintiff’s false imprisonment claim without  leave to amend and granted Apex’s motion to strike Plaintiff’s request for  attorney’s fees with leave to amend.  On March 16, 2023, Apex filed an answer.  On January 4, 2024, the Court made the following  rulings:  ·        The Court granted  the motion of Apex, AEG, and Goldenvoice to compel Plaintiff to attend his  deposition and ordered Plaintiff to appear for his deposition by February 5,  2024. ·        The Court granted  Apex’s motion to compel Plaintiff to respond to Apex’s requests for production  of documents and ordered Plaintiff to provide verified, code-compliant  responses without objections and to produce the documents, electronically  stored information, and/or other things requested without objections by  February 5, 2024. ·        The Court granted  Apex’s motion to compel Plaintiff to respond to Apex’s special interrogatories  and ordered Plaintiff to provide verified, code-compliant responses to the  special interrogatories without objections by February 5, 2024. ·        The Court granted  Apex’s motion to compel Plaintiff to respond to Apex’s form interrogatories and  ordered Plaintiff to provide verified, code-compliant responses to the form  interrogatories without objections by February 5, 2024. ·        The Court granted  Apex’s motion to deem admitted matters specified in Apex’s requests for  admission and deemed admitted the matters specified in Apex’s requests for  admission. ·        The Court granted  Apex’s request for monetary sanctions and ordered Plaintiff and his counsel,  jointly and severally, to pay Apex $2,925.60, consisting of $1,240.65 for the  motion to compel Plaintiff’s deposition, $561.65 for the motion to compel  Plaintiff’s response to requests for production of documents, $561.65 for the  motion to compel Plaintiff’s response to interrogatories, and $561.65 for the  motion to deem admitted matters specified in requests for admission.  Plaintiff did not comply with the January 4, 2024  order to provide verified code-compliant responses to the request for  production of documents, special interrogatories, and form interrogatories, and  to pay the monetary sanctions. On April  9, 2024, the Court denied Apex’s motion for terminating sanctions but imposed $1,561.65  in additional monetary sanctions on Plaintiff, to be paid along with the  previously-awarded monetary sanctions by May 3, 2024.  On May 3, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion for  reconsideration and/or to vacate and/or to set aside the January 4, 2024 and  April 9, 2024 orders.  The motion was set  for hearing on June 28, 2024.  The Court  continued the hearing to July 15, 2024.  On July 1, 2024, Apex filed an opposition.  On July 9, 2024, Plaintiff filed a reply.  Trial is currently scheduled for September 9, 2024. PARTIES’ REQUESTS  Plaintiff asks the Court to reconsider, vacate, or set  aside its January 4, 2024 and April 9, 2024 orders.  Apex asks the Court to deny the motion.LEGAL STANDARD  Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b),  provides in part:  “The court may, upon any terms as may be just, relieve  a party or his or her legal representative from a judgment, dismissal, order,  or other proceeding taken against him or her through his or her mistake,  inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. Application for this relief shall  be accompanied by a copy of the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed  therein, otherwise the application shall not be granted, and shall be made  within a reasonable time, in no case exceeding six months, after the judgment,  dismissal, order, or proceeding was taken. . . . Notwithstanding any other  requirements of this section, the court shall, whenever an application for  relief is made no more than six months after entry of judgment, is in proper  form, and is accompanied by an attorney’s sworn affidavit attesting to his or  her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect, vacate any (1) resulting  default entered by the clerk against his or her client, and which will result  in entry of a default judgment, or (2) resulting default judgment or dismissal  entered against his or her client, unless the court finds that the default or  dismissal was not in fact caused by the attorney’s mistake, inadvertence,  surprise, or neglect. The court shall, whenever relief is granted based on an  attorney’s affidavit of fault, direct the attorney to pay reasonable  compensatory legal fees and costs to opposing counsel or parties. However, this  section shall not lengthen the time within which an action shall be brought to  trial pursuant to Section 583.310.”(Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b).)DISCUSSION  Plaintiff asks the Court to reconsider, vacate, or set  aside its January 4, 2024 and April 9, 2024 orders under Code of Civil  Procedure section 473, subdivision (b), because the orders resulted from  Plaintiff’s counsel’s mistake, inadvertence, and excusable neglect.  Apex opposes the motion, arguing (among other things)  Plaintiff’s counsel’s conduct does not constitute “excusable neglect” under  Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b).  “Because the Discovery Act contains specific  provisions for relief for delayed [discovery] responses, relief cannot be  obtained under [Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b)].”  (L. Edmon & C. Karnow, Cal. Practice  Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶ 8:1038.1, p. 8F-37; see Zellerino  v. Brown (1991) 235 Cal.App.3d 1097, 1107 [“Relief under section 473 is  unavailable when the discovery act provides analogous, if more limited, relief”].)   Here, the Discovery Act provides analogous relief.  Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.300,  subdivision (a), allows a party to seek relief from the failure to serve a  timely response to a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd.  (a).)  Code of Civil Procedure section  2030.290, subdivision (a), allows a party to seek relief from the failure to  serve a timely response to interrogatories.   (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).)  Code of Civil  Procedure section 2033.280, subdivision (a), allows a party to seek relief from  the failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (a).)  Plaintiff states that the parties have resolved the dispute concerning Plaintiff’s deposition.  (See Motion  p. 3.)  Therefore, the Court's order compelling Plaintiff's deposition is no longer at issue. In addition, Plaintiff acknowledges that the Court's April 9, 2024  order “effectively piggybacked” on the January 4, 2024 order because both  orders related to the same discovery.   (Motion p. 6.)  Therefore, the Discovery Act's analogous relief prevents Plaintiff from seeking relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b), from the April 9, 2024 order as well as the January 4, 2024 order. Although Plaintiff briefly refers to “equitable” grounds  for his motion, he provides no supporting legal authority or argument explaining how equitable relief would apply.  The Court considers the issue of equitable  relief waived.  The Court denies the motion.  CONCLUSION  The Court DENIES Plaintiff Joshua Olaoniye’s motion to reconsider, set aside, or vacate the Court’s January 4, 2024 and April 9, 2024 orders.  Moving party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.  Moving party is ordered to file the proof of service  of this ruling with the Court within five days.
