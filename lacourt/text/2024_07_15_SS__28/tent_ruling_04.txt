 Case Number:  21STCV31743    Hearing Date:   July 15, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
reviewed the moving and supplemental papers, the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On
August 26, 2021, Plaintiff Malvina Mkchyan (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint
against Defendants Margaret Mary Lewis (“Defendant”) and Does 1-50 for motor
vehicle tort and general negligence. 
On
May 15, 2023, Defendant filed an answer. 
On
February 22, 2024, Defendant filed (1) a motion to compel Plaintiff’s further
responses to special interrogatories, set one, and for sanctions, and (2) a
motion to compel Plaintiff’s further responses to form interrogatories, set
one, and for sanctions.  The motions were
set to be heard on April 22, 2024. 
On
April 22, 2024, the Court continued the hearing to May 16, 2024 and ordered
Defendant to file supplemental declarations or briefs explaining whether her
motions were timely under Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.300, subdivision
(c). The Court granted Plaintiff leave to file responsive declarations or
briefs. 
On
May 2, 2024, Defendant filed supplemental briefs. The Court continued the
hearing to July 15, 2024. 
Trial
is currently scheduled for August 22, 2024. 
DISCUSSION 
A.      Informal Discovery Conference 
The Los
Angeles Superior Court’s Eighth Amended Standing Order for Procedures in the
Personal Injury Hub Courts Effective October 10, 2022 (filed September 20,
2022) (“Eighth Amended Standing Order”), ¶ 9E, provides: “PI Hub Courts will
not hear Motions to Compel Further Discovery Responses to Discovery until the
parties have engaged in an Informal Discovery Conference (IDC). PI Hub Courts
may deny or continue a Motion to Compel Further Responses to Discovery if
parties fail to schedule and complete an IDC before the scheduled hearing on a
Motion to Compel Further Responses to Discovery.” 
Defendant scheduled and attended an IDC on February
20, 2024. Plaintiff did not attend
the IDC. The Court took the IDC off calendar and ruled that Defendant could
proceed with motions to compel further discovery responses. 
B.       Timeliness 
“Unless
notice of [a motion to compel further responses to interrogatories] is given
within 45 days of the service of the verified response, or any supplemental
verified response, or on or before any specific later date to which the propounding
party and the responding party have agreed in writing, the propounding party
waives any right to compel a further response to the interrogatories.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (c).) The
statutory deadline for a motion to compel further responses to interrogatories
is mandatory and the Court lacks jurisdiction to entertain a belated motion to
compel. (See Golf & Tennis Pro Shop, Inc. v. Superior Court (2022)
84 Cal.App.5th 127, 137 (Golf & Tennis Pro Shop); Vidal Sassoon,
Inc. v. Superior Court (1983) 147 Cal.App.3d 681, 683, 685 (Vidal
Sassoon).) 
On
February 22, 2024, Defendant filed (1) a motion to compel further responses to
special interrogatories, set one, and request for sanctions, and (2) a motion to compel
further responses to form interrogatories, set one, and request for sanctions. The
motions stated that Defendant’s counsel received Plaintiff’s responses to
Defendant’s special and form interrogatories on November 3, 2023.  The motions also stated that
although Defendant’s counsel asked Plaintiff’s counsel for an extension of time
to file a motion to compel further responses to the interrogatories,
Plaintiff’s counsel did not respond to the request. 
On
April 22, 2024, the Court issued an order observing that the 45-day deadline to
file a motion to compel further responses begins to run only when verified responses
are served and it was not clear if the responses which Defendant’s counsel
received on November 3, 2023 were verified. 
The Court continued the hearing to May 16, 2024 and ordered
Defendant to file supplemental declarations or briefs explaining whether her
motions were timely under Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.300, subdivision
(c). The Court granted Plaintiff leave to file responsive declarations or
briefs. 
On
May 2, 2024, Defendant filed supplemental briefs stating that Plaintiff served
verifications to the discovery responses on November 7, 2023.  Defendant asserts that Plaintiff’s counsel agreed to
extend Defendant’s time to file motions to compel further responses to January
12, 2024 and then for an additional three weeks. (Defendant’s Supplemental
Brief p. 6.) Based on Defendant's representations, Defendant's deadline to file motions to compel further responses would have been February 2, 2024.  On January 19 and 30, 2024, Defendant’s
counsel asked Plaintiff’s counsel for a 60-day extension of time to file motions to compel further responses to the special and form interrogatories.
(Defendant’s Supplemental Brief p. 6.) Plaintiff’s counsel did not respond to
the request.  As
noted, Defendant filed motions to compel further responses on February 22, 2024,
after the February 2, 2024 deadline. 
Nonetheless, Defendant
argues that the Court “instructed” Defendant to file motions to
compel further discovery and “tolled all motion deadlines related to the
discovery at issue in doing so” at the February 20, 2024 informal discovery
conference.  (Supplement Brief pp. 2-3.)  As support for this argument, Defendant cites
the Court’s February 20, 2024 minute order, which stated that notwithstanding Plaintiff's failure to appear at the informal discovery conference, “Counsel for Defendant may move forward with filing the Motions to Compel Further Discovery Responses and the Court will rule on the Motions on their scheduled dates of 4/22 and 4/23/22024 at 1:30 p.m. in this Department.” 
The
timeliness issue was not before the Court at the February 20, 2024 informal discovery
conference and the Court did not address it. In stating that Defendant could
proceed with filing her motion, the Court meant only that Defendant had
complied with the Eighth Amended Standing Order’s requirement that a party
participate in an informal discovery conference before the Court will hear the
party’s motion to compel further discovery responses. Indeed, the Court has no
authority to waive the timeliness requirement.  (See Golf & Tennis Pro Shop, supra,
84 Cal.App.5th at p. 137; Vidal Sassoon, supra, 147 Cal.App.3d at
pp. 683, 685.)  If Defendant relied on
the language of the Court’s February 20, 2024 minute order to support a belief
that that the Court “tolled all motion deadlines related to the discovery”
(Supplemental Brief p. 3), Defendant’s reliance was misplaced. 
Defendant
also argues that “[a]t the February 20, 2024, IDC hearing, the court
necessarily tolled the applicable motion deadlines under former Code of Civil
Procedure section 2016.080(c)(2) by giving Defendant permission to file her
Motions at the Informal Discovery Conference.” 
(Supplemental Brief p. 4.) But as Defendant acknowledges, former Code of
Civil Procedure section 2016.080, subdivision (c)(2), was not in effect when the February 20, 2024 informal discovery
conference took place. 
Defendant
also relies on the Eighth Amended Standing Order’s statements that (1) “parties
are encouraged to stipulate to extend the deadline for filing a Motion to
Compel Further Discovery Responses by 60 days in order to allow time to
participate in an IDC and to informally resolve the pending discovery issues”
and (2) “[a] party’s failure to stipulate to extend the time to bring a Motion to
Compel Further Discovery Responses so that an IDC may be held may subject the
parties and/or counsel to the imposition of sanctions.”  (Eight Amended Standing Order ¶ 9 E.)  Defendant does not mention the Eighth Amended
Standing Order’s warning that “[r]eserving or scheduling an IDC does not
extend the time to file a Motion to Compel Further Discovery Responses.”  (Ibid., bold in original.)  The Eighth Amended Standing Order suggests
that “[i]f parties do not stipulate to extend the deadline(s) to file a Motion
to Compel Further Discovery Responses, the moving/propounding party may file
the motion to avoid it being deemed untimely.” 
(Ibid.)  Defendant did not
follow this suggestion. 
The
Court denies the motions as untimely. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES Defendant Margaret Mary
Lewis’s motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories, set one, and for sanctions. 
The
Court DENIES Defendant Margaret Mary Lewis’s motion to compel further responses
to form interrogatories, set one, and for sanctions.
