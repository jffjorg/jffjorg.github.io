And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving a motor vehicle accident and personal injuries. The plaintiff, Oscar Jose Rosa Garcia, and his wife, Yeny Liseth Flores Garcia, sued PRN Ambulance, LLC, and Does 1-50 for motor vehicle tort and general negligence. The defendant filed a motion for non-monetary and monetary sanctions against the plaintiffs, alleging that the case was time-barred under the Medical Injury Compensation Reform Act (MICRA). The plaintiffs opposed the motion, arguing that it was an improper attempt to obtain summary judgment without complying with the applicable evidentiary and procedural requirements. The judge denied the motion for sanctions and granted the plaintiffs' request for sanctions, ordering the defendant and its counsel to pay the plaintiffs $750.00 in sanctions. The judge also denied the defendant's motion for sanctions and ordered the defendant to pay the plaintiffs' attorney fees. The case is set for trial on October 4, 2024.
