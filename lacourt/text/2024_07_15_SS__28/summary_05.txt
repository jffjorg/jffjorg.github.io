And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the moving papers and rules as follows. Defendant Shahin Benyamin has moved to compel Plaintiff Mojgan Gharehedaghi's responses to form interrogatories, set three, and for sanctions. The Court grants this motion and orders Plaintiff to provide verified code-compliant responses to the form interrogatories without objections by August 14, 2024.

Defendant has also moved to deem admitted matters specified in requests for admission, set two, served on Plaintiff on March 19, 2024. The Court grants this motion and deems the matters admitted.

However, the Court denies Defendant's request for sanctions on the motion to compel responses to form interrogatories, set three. The Court finds that sanctions are not available under Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.290 and that no opposition was filed to the motion.

The Court also notes that while California Rules of Court, rule 3.1348(a), authorizes sanctions in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was filed, the Court may not award sanctions under this rule except as the Discovery Act authorizes. Since the Discovery Act does not authorize sanctions for Defendant's unopposed motion to compel responses to special interrogatories, the Court denies Defendant's request for sanctions.
