 Case Number:  22STCV07812    Hearing Date:   July 15, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
considered the moving papers, the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On
March 3, 2022, Plaintiff Mojgan Gharehedaghi (“Plaintiff”) filed this action
against Defendants Shahin Benyama (“Defendant”) and Does 1-50 for premises
liability and negligence. 
On
March 16, 2023, Defendant filed a general denial. 
On
August 9, 2023, Defendant filed a notice of errata stating that his correct
legal name is Shahin Benyamin. 
On March
12, 2024, the Court granted Plaintiff’s counsel’s motion to be relieved as
counsel. 
On
June 12, 2024, Defendant filed (1) a motion to compel Plaintiff’s responses to
form interrogatories, set three, and for sanctions, and (2) a motion to deem
admitted matters specified in requests for admission, set two.  The motions were set for hearing on July 15, 2024.  Plaintiff has not filed oppositions. 
Trial
is currently scheduled for January 15, 2025. 
PARTY’S REQUESTS 
Defendant
asks the Court (1) to compel Plaintiff’s responses to form interrogatories, set
three, and impose sanctions on Plaintiff, and (2) to deem admitted matters
specified in requests for admission, set two. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
A.   Interrogatories 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2030.290 provides: 
“If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails
to serve a timely response, the following rules apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the interrogatories are
directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under
Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to the interrogatories, including
one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4
(commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that
party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, and
2030.240. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The party propounding the interrogatories may
move for an order compelling response to the interrogatories. 
“(c) The court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to
interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails to obey an order compelling
answers, the court may make those orders that are just, including the imposition
of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in addition to that
sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010).” 
(Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290.) 
          B.       Requests
for admission 
          Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280 provides:           
“If a party to whom requests for admission are
directed fails to serve a timely response, the following rules apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the requests for admission are
directed waives any objection to the requests, including one based on privilege
or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section
2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its
determination that both of the following conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2033.210, 2033.220, and 2033.230. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The requesting party may move for an order that
the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the
requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010). 
“(c) The court shall make this order, unless it finds
that the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has
served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests
for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220. It is
mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to
serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280.)  
DISCUSSION 
On March
19, 2024, Defendant served form interrogatories, set three, and requests for admission,
set two, on Plaintiff.  Plaintiff did not
serve timely responses and had not served responses by the time Defendant filed
these motions. 
The Court grants Defendant’s motion to compel Plaintiff's responses to form interrogatories, set three, and orders Plaintiff to provide
verified code-compliant responses to the form interrogatories without
objections by August 14, 2024. 
The
Court grants Defendant's motion to deem admitted matters specified in requests for
admission and deems admitted the matters specified in requests for admission,
set two, served on Plaintiff on March 19, 2024. 
Defendant
requests $612.00 in sanctions on his motion to compel responses to the form interrogatories.  Under Code of Civil
Procedure section 2030.290, sanctions are available against parties, persons,
and attorneys who unsuccessfully make or oppose a motion to compel a response
to interrogatories. (See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (c).)  Plaintiff has not made or opposed a motion to
compel responses to interrogatories.  Therefore,
sanctions are not available under this statute. 
Other
statutes addressing misuse of the discovery process do not, by themselves,
authorize a sanctions award for this motion.  Code of Civil Procedure
section 2023.010 is “ ‘definitional’ and monetary sanctions may not be imposed
based solely on [the statute]. Monetary sanctions may be imposed only if
authorized by some other provision of the Discovery Act.” (L. Edmon & C.
Karnow, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶
8:1900, p. 8M-2; see Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030 [court may impose sanctions
for misuse of the discovery process “[t]o the extent authorized by the chapter
governing any particular discovery method or other provision of this title”]; City
of Los Angeles v. PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLC (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 466,
498-504, review granted Jan. 23, 2023 with order permitting citation of opinion
for its persuasive value and to establish the existence of a conflict in
authority that would “allow trial courts to exercise discretion . . . to choose
between sides of any such conflict.”) 
California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1348(a), provides: “The court may award sanctions under
the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery,
even though no opposition to the motion was filed . . . .”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 1348(a).)  Because rule 3.1348(a) authorizes sanctions
“under the Discovery Act,” the Court may not award sanctions under rule
3.1348(a) except as the Discovery Act authorizes.  As explained above, the Discovery Act does
not authorize sanctions for Defendant’s unopposed motion to compel responses to
special interrogatories.  Therefore, the
Court denies Defendant’s request for sanctions on the motion to compel Plaintiff's responses to form interrogatories. 
Sanctions
are mandatory for Defendant’s motion to deem admitted matters specified in
requests for admission.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)  However, Defendant
has not requested sanctions on this motion and has not provided information
about the amount of attorney time or expenses incurred in filing the motion.  Therefore, the Court does not impose
sanctions. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court GRANTS Defendant Shahin Benyamin’s motion to compel responses to form
interrogatories, set three, and orders Plaintiff Mojgan Gharehedaghi to provide
verified code-compliant responses to the form interrogatories without
objections by August 14, 2024. 
The
Court GRANTS Defendant Shahin Benyamin’s motion to deem admitted matters specified
in requests for admission, set two, served on Plaintiff Mojgan Gharehedaghi on March 19, 2024.  The Court deems the matters admitted. 
The
Court DENIES Defendant Shahin Benyamin’s request
for sanctions on the motion to compel responses to form interrogatories, set
three. 
Moving
party is to give notice of this ruling.
