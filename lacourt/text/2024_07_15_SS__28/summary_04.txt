And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the moving and supplemental papers and rules as follows. The plaintiff, Malvina Mkchyan, filed a complaint against the defendant, Margaret Mary Lewis, on August 26, 2021, alleging motor vehicle tort and general negligence. The defendant filed an answer on May 15, 2023, and later filed two motions to compel further responses to special and form interrogatories, which were set to be heard on April 22, 2024.

The judge denied the motions as untimely, citing Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.300, subdivision (c), which provides that unless notice of a motion to compel further responses is given within 45 days of the service of the verified response, or any supplemental verified response, or on or before any specific later date to which the propounding party and the responding party have agreed in writing, the propounding party waives any right to compel a further response to the interrogatories.

The judge noted that the defendant did not follow the suggestion in the Eighth Amended Standing Order to stipulate to extend the deadline for filing motions to avoid the motion being deemed untimely. The judge also denied the defendant's argument that the Court "tolled all motion deadlines related to the discovery" at the informal discovery conference, citing Golf & Tennis Pro Shop, Inc. v. Superior Court (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 127 and Vidal Sassoon, Inc. v. Superior Court (1983) 147 Cal.App.3d 681.

The judge ordered the defendant to give notice of this ruling and to file proof of service of this ruling within five days.
