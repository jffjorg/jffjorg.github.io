PARTIES’ REQUESTS 
Graham
asks the Court to strike portions of the second amended complaint. 
Plaintiffs
ask the Court to deny the motion. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
A.   Motion to strike 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 436 provides: 
“The court may, upon a motion made pursuant to Section
435, or at any time in its discretion, and upon terms it deems proper: 
“(a) Strike out any irrelevant, false, or improper
matter inserted in any pleading. 
“(b) Strike out all or any part of any pleading not
drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an
order of the court.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 436.) 
“The grounds for a motion to strike shall appear on
the face of the challenged pleading or from any matter of which the court is
required to take judicial notice.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437, subd. (a).)  “Where the
motion to strike is based on matter of which the court may take judicial notice
pursuant to Section 452 or 453 of the Evidence Code, such matter shall be
specified in the notice of motion, or in the supporting points and authorities,
except as the court may otherwise permit.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437, subd. (b).) 
“In
passing on the correctness of a ruling on a motion to strike, judges read
allegations of a pleading subject to a motion to strike as a whole, all parts
in their context, and assume their truth.” (Clauson v. Superior Court
(1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 1253, 1255.)  “In ruling on a motion to strike, courts do
not read allegations in isolation.”  (Ibid.) 
B.   Code of Civil Procedure section 377.34 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 377.34 provides in part: 
“(a) In an action or proceeding by a decedent’s
personal representative or successor in interest on the decedent’s cause of
action, the damages recoverable are limited to the loss or damage that the
decedent sustained or incurred before death, including any penalties or
punitive or exemplary damages that the decedent would have been entitled to
recover had the decedent lived, and do not include damages for pain, suffering,
or disfigurement. 
“(b) Notwithstanding subdivision (a), in an action or
proceeding by a decedent’s personal representative or successor in interest on
the decedent’s cause of action, the damages recoverable may include damages for
pain, suffering, or disfigurement if the action or proceeding was granted a
preference pursuant to Section 36 before January 1, 2022, or was filed on or
after January 1, 2022, and before January 1, 2026. . . .” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 377.34,
subds. (a), (b).) 
DISCUSSION 
          Graham asks the Court to strike allegations in the second
amended complaint which, according to Graham, do not support Plaintiffs’
punitive damage claim.  (Second amended
complaint ¶¶ 4-5, 36, 40, 41, 45, 46, 48, 51, 54, 55, 56, 58, 61, 62, 64.)  But the second amended complaint does not
assert a punitive damage claim.  Even if
the second amended complaint contained a punitive damage claim, the Court would
not strike allegations simply because they did not support that claim.  A complaint’s allegations may serve purposes
other than supporting a punitive damage claim.  
          Graham also asks the Court to strike paragraphs 61 and 62
of the second amended complaint under Code of Civil Procedure section 377.34.  These paragraphs allege: 
“61. On September 26, 2020, and prior to his death,
DERRICK PATRICK MORA suffered damages,
including pre-death pain and suffering from both the physical injuries suffered
by the motor vehicle versus motorcycle collision actually and proximately
caused by Defendants JOEL GRAHAM and CYNTHIA LAVARIERE upon him, who subjected
him to numerous invasive doctor’s examinations and treatments, as well as the
emotional injuries of having to suffer his own death. “62. Had DERRICK PATRICK MORA survived, he would have
been entitled to bring an action against Defendants JOEL GRAHAM and CYNTHIA
LAVARIERE, and DOE Defendants 1 through 25, Inclusive, to recover the
aforementioned damages he suffered prior to and upon his death, on September
29, 2020. DERRICK PATRICK MORA was 25 years old on the day of his death.”
           Plaintiffs filed their complaint on September 26, 2022, allowing them to pursue a claim for the decedent's pre-death pain and suffering under Code of Civil Procedure section 366.34, subdivision (b).  Paragraphs 61 and 62 plainly allege that Plaintiffs are seeking only pre-death pain and suffering damages.  The Court therefore denies Graham’s motion to strike paragraphs 61 and
62 of the second amended complaint. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES Defendant Joel Graham’s motion to strike
portions of the second amended complaint. 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
