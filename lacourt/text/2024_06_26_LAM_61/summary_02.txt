And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling denies Plaintiff Xinwu Cheng's motion to strike portions of Defendant City of Fontana's answer and for other discovery sanctions. The court finds that Plaintiff has not identified any court order violated by Defendant's interrogatory responses. The responses provided by Defendant contain more detailed information concerning the nature of the surveillance and the suspected crime, and no prior order or motion in this case has been directed towards the specific disclosure of the facts communicated by Officer Martinez to Defendant regarding the suspected criminal activities of Plaintiff. The court concludes that no sanctions are warranted and the motion is denied.
