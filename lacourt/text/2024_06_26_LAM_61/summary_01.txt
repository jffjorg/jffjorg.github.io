And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling denies the motion for attorney fees filed by Defendants Iris Au, Dream Agency, Inc., and Zort, Inc. The motion was filed in response to the voluntary dismissal of the lawsuit by Plaintiffs Kenneth Childs, et al. The lawsuit was filed based on a contract between Paramount Investigative Services, Inc. and Alex Iza, which contains an attorney fees provision allowing the client to be liable for all costs associated with collection, including attorney fees and service of process.

The court ruled that the attorney fees provision is unilateral, allowing only Plaintiffs to collect fees, and that it does not provide any avenue for the client to seek fees of their own. The court also ruled that there is no prevailing party under Civil Code § 1717 because the lawsuit was voluntarily dismissed. The court cited several cases to support its decision, including Serrano v. Priest, Serrano v. Unruh, Santisas v. Goodin, and Rosen v. Robert P. Warmington Co.
