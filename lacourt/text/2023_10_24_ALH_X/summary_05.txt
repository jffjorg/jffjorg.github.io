(Code Civ. Proc. section 2033.290, subd. (c).)
  - "A party may respond to a demand for inspection with '[a]n objection to the particular demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling.'"
  - "Because the relevant code sections allow a party responding to a discovery response to object and a party to compel further responses over those objections, the correct motion here is a motion to compel further responses."

And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling is regarding a motion to compel further responses to a discovery request. The case involves Plaintiffs Veronica Prado and Anthony Narango, who claim that Defendant TLD Transport, Inc. and Zheng Zhao negligently operated a vehicle. The Plaintiffs filed a complaint on January 11, 2023, and the Defendant served discovery requests on July 5, 2023. The Plaintiffs objected to the discovery requests on August 8, 2023. The Defendant moves to compel further responses to request for production of documents number 34, which seeks the recording of the independent medical examination of Veronica Prado. The Judge grants the motion, finding that the Plaintiffs' objections are not sufficient to waive the request. The Judge also denies the Defendant's request for sanctions.
