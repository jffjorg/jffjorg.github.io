And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled to grant the motion of the plaintiffs (Noel Jave Jimenez, Alexander Vera, Beningo Rojas, Jesse Rojas, and Julio Moreno) to file a second amended complaint. The plaintiffs claim they faced unlawful working conditions while employed by T&L Air Conditioning, Inc. and seek to amend their complaint to add a Private Attorney General claim. The judge has granted the motion, citing the liberal policy of allowing amendments to promote the judicial policy of resolving all disputed matters in one lawsuit, as long as no prejudice is shown to the adverse party. The judge has also noted that the plaintiffs' declaration did not fully comply with California Rules of Court Rule 3.1324, but found that the proposed amendments were necessary and proper.
