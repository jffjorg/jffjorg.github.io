BACKGROUND
 
             This case arises out of Plaintiffs’ claim that
they faced unlawful working conditions while employed by T&L Air
Conditioning, Inc. Plaintiffs filed their initial complaint on November 14,
2022. 
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
            Plaintiffs’ motion for leave to file a second amended
complaint is GRANTED.
 
LEGAL STANDARD
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (a)(1), provides in
relevant part:  “The court may likewise, in its discretion, after notice
to the adverse party, allow, upon any terms as may be just, an amendment to any
pleading or proceeding in other particulars; and may upon like terms allow an
answer to be made after the time limited by this code.” Trial courts have discretion to permit amendments, which
should be exercised liberally in favor of amendments to promote the judicial
policy to resolve all disputed matters in one lawsuit. (Kittredge
Sports Co. v. Superior Court (1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 1045,
1047. “But this policy applies only [w]here no prejudice is shown to
the adverse party.” (Melican v. Regents of University of California (2007)
151 Cal.App.4th 168, 175, quotation marks omitted.)
 
DISCUSSION
 
            Plaintiffs move for leave to file a second amended complaint. 
 
            California
Rules of Court Rule 3.1324 (“Rule 3.1324”), subdivision (a), provides: 
“A motion to amend a pleading before trial must: [¶] (1) Include a copy of the proposed amendment
or amended pleading, which must be serially numbered to differentiate it from
previous pleadings or amendments; [¶] (2) State what allegations in the previous
pleading are proposed to be deleted, if any, and where, by page, paragraph, and
line number, the deleted allegations are located; and [¶] (3) State what allegations
are proposed to be added to the previous pleading, if any, and where, by page,
paragraph, and line number, the additional allegations are located.
 
            Plaintiffs
attach a proposed copy of the second amended complaint with the proposed
changes indicated with bolded language. (Nevels Decl. ¶ 3, Exhibit 1.) 
 
            Rule 3.1324
subdivision (b), requires a motion to amend a pleading to include a declaration
that provides: “[¶] (1) The effect
of the amendment; [¶] (2) Why the
amendment is necessary and proper; [¶] (3) When the facts giving rise to the amended
allegations were discovered; and [¶] (4) The reasons why the request for amendment was
not made earlier.”
 
            Plaintiffs
do not expressly address the requirements of Rule 3.1324, subdivision (b), in
their declaration. However, they mentioned that the seek to amend the complaint
to allege a Private Attorney General claim (Nevel Decl. ¶ 8),
which explains the effect of the amendment and why the amendment is necessary
and proper. Further, Plaintiffs provide that they attempted to file a
stipulation for the amendment but was directed to file the present motion for
leave. (Id. ¶¶ 9-15.) 
 
            Plaintiffs’
motion for leave to file a second amended complaint is granted. 
 
CONCLUSION
 
            Plaintiffs’
motion for leave to file a second amended complaint is GRANTED.
