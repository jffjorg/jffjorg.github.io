JAGUAR LAND ROVER NORTH AMERICA, LLC, a Delaware limited  liability company; JAGUAR LAND ROVER PORTLAND; SILVER STAR A.G., LTD     CASE NO.:                 22AHCV00292       MOTION  FOR ATTORNEY’S FEES    MOVING PARTY:               Plaintiff Sara Bassiri   RESPONDING PARTY:      Jaguar  Land Rover North America, LLC, Jaguar Land Rover Portland, and Silver Star  A.G., LTD   SERVICE:                              Filed September 20, 2023   OPPOSITION:                       Filed October 11, 2023   REPLY:                                   Filed October 17, 2023   RELIEF  REQUESTED                 Plaintiff seeks fees totaling  $80,961.19.    BACKGROUND                This case arises out of Plaintiff Sara  Bassiri’s lemon law claim for a new 2021 Land Rover RR Sport SE/H, Vehicle  Identification number SALWR2SYU7MA759958 (“Subject Vehicle”), she leased on  February 2, 2022. Plaintiff filed this complaint on May 20, 2022.   TENTATIVE RULING                     3  Plaintiff’s motion for attorney’s fees is GRANTED for a  total of $31,161.19   LEGAL STANDARD               “The Song-Beverly Act  is commonly known as the automobile “lemon law.” [citation] Under the Act,  “[i]f the manufacturer ... is unable to service or repair a new motor vehicle  ... to conform to the applicable express warranties after a reasonable number  of attempts, the manufacturer shall either promptly replace the new motor  vehicle ... or promptly make restitution to the buyer” at the buyer's election.  (§ 1793.2, subd. (d)(2).)” (Reck v. FCA US LLC (2021)  64 Cal.App.5th 682, 691.) A buyer who prevails under the Act “shall be allowed  by the court to recover as part of the judgment a sum equal to the aggregate  amount of costs and expenses, including attorney's fees based on actual time  expended, determined by the court to have been reasonably incurred by the buyer  in connection with the commencement and prosecution of such action.” (Civ. Code section 1794, subd. (d).)   “The  ‘plain wording’ of section 1794, subdivision (d) requires  the trial court to ‘base’ the prevailing buyer's attorney fee award ‘upon  actual time expended on the case, as long as such fees are reasonably incurred—both from the standpoint of  time spent and the amount charged.’ “ (Warren v. Kia Motors America, Inc. (2018)  30 Cal.App.5th 24, 35 (“Warren”).)  “A prevailing buyer has the  burden of ‘showing that the fees incurred were “allowable,” were “reasonably  necessary to the conduct of the litigation,” and were “reasonable in amount.” ’  ” (Hanna v. Mercedez-Benz USA, LLC (2019) 36 Cal.App.5th 493, 507.)   DISCUSSION               Plaintiff moves for attorney’s fees  following settlement of this case by a Code of Civil Procedure section 998  offer where Defendants agreed to pay restitution, civil penalties, and  attorney’s fees. (Mot. at p. 1:16-20.)               “[T]he fee setting inquiry in  California ordinarily begins with the “lodestar,” i.e., the number of hours  reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate.” (PLCM Group  v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095.) “The reasonable hourly rate is  that prevailing in the community for similar work.” (Ibid.) Once the  lodestar figure is calculated, a court may adjust the award based on factors  such as “(1) the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, (2) the  skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the extent to which the nature of the  litigation precluded other employment by the attorneys, (4) the contingent  nature of the fee award.” (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122,  1132.) “The purpose of such adjustment is to fix a fee at the fair market value  for the particular action.” (Ibid.)                Plaintiff  requests fees totaling $80,961.19, which includes $50,900.00 in attorney’s  fees, a .50 multiplier, $1,111.19 in costs, and $4,500 for additional costs  related to the present motion. Plaintiff seeks fees for 121.1 hours worked at  rates of either $400 per hour or $450 per hour. (Ahoubim Decl. ¶ 40-45, Exhibit 2.) Plaintiff filed her  initial complaint on May 20, 2022. Since then, the parties have engaged in  discovery, case management conferences, and met and conferred regarding  discovery responses. (Id. ¶¶ 13-36.) Although Plaintiff’s counsel  provides discovery motions were drafted, no motions were filed in the present  case.                The court finds that the reasonable number of hours  worked for this case is 63 hours at a blended rate of $450 per hour. Thus, the  lodestar amount is $28,350. Further, Plaintiff fails to demonstrate that a  multiplier is warranted in a routine lemon law case where no motions were filed  nor novel issues litigated. Lastly, Plaintiff is awarded an additional $1,700  for four hours worked at $425 per hour for time expended on the present motion.   CONCLUSION               Plaintiff’s motion for attorney’s fees is GRANTED for a  total of $31,161.19 ($28,350 lodestar, $1111.19 in costs, and $1,700 for the  present motion.               Moving party to give notice.                        Dated:   October 24,  2023                                          ___________________________________                                                                                     Joel  L.
