And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for attorney's fees in the amount of $31,161.19. The plaintiff had requested fees totaling $80,961.19, but the court reduced the amount based on the reasonable number of hours worked (63 hours at a blended rate of $450 per hour) and the lack of novel or complex issues in the case. The court also denied the plaintiff's request for a multiplier and awarded an additional $1,700 for time expended on the present motion. The judge's ruling is based on the Song-Beverly Act and California Civil Code section 1794, subdivision (d), which allow prevailing buyers to recover attorney's fees as part of the judgment.
