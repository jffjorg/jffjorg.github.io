And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is in response to a demurrer and motion to strike filed by the defendants, Christ-Centered Ministries, Troy Francis Vaughn, William David Williams, and James O. Phillips. The plaintiff, Rlesia White, alleges that the defendants violated various labor laws, including FEHA and CFRA, and retaliated against her.

The court sustains the demurrer to the first, second, third, and fourth causes of action with respect to the individual defendants, Troy Francis Vaughn, William David Williams, and James O. Phillips, with leave to amend. The court sustains the demurrer to the fifth, seventh, eighth, ninth, eleventh, thirteenth, and fourteenth causes of action as to Christ-Centered Ministries without leave to amend.

The court overrules the demurrer to the sixth, tenth, and twelfth causes of action, which allege CFRA retaliation and labor code violations. The court also overrules the demurrer to the sixteenth cause of action, which alleges wrongful termination in violation of public policy.

The court denies the motion to strike, finding that the allegations against Christ-Centered Ministries are sufficient to support a claim for punitive damages. The court finds that Christ-Centered Ministries' actions, including initially approving Plaintiff's leave and later terminating her employment, suggest a malicious or oppressive intent.
