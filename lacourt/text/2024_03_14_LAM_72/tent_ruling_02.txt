Plaintiff Efrain Jimenez Cornejo (“Plaintiff”) moves for an
order approving the settlement in this PAGA case.
 
The Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion subject to the Court
reducing the attorney’s fees. The Court approves attorney’s fees in the amount of
$79,920.00 which is 33.3% of the recovery.
 
Background
 
Plaintiff filed this action on March 31, 2023. The operative
complaint is now the Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”), which alleges (1)
failure to pay overtime; (2) failure to pay minimum wages; (3) meal period
violations; (4) rest break violations; (5) failure to pay vested vacation
benefits; (6) failure to allow sick time and benefits; (7) failure to pay wages
for all time worked; (8) failure to provide accurate wage statements; (9)
failure to timely pay wages at separation; (10) failure to produce employment
records; (11) failure to pay regular rate of pay; (12) failure to maintain
accurate payroll records; (13) unfair business practices; and (14) violation of
labor laws giving rise to a PAGA action.
 
The parties agreed to a settlement on November 20, 2023.
 
            Plaintiff
filed this motion for approval of the Settlement on February 21, 2024. No party
filed an opposition.
 
Legal Standard
 
Settlement
 
The PAGA is “a procedural
statute allowing an aggrieved employee to recover civil penalties—for Labor
Code violations—that otherwise would be sought by state labor law enforcement
agencies.” (Amalgamated Transit Union, Local 1756, AFL-CIO v. Superior Court
(2009) 46 Cal.4th 993, 1003.)  The statute provides a mechanism for
private enforcement of Labor Code violations for the public benefit. (See Arias
v. Superior Court (2009) 46 Cal.4th 969, 986; Ochoa-Hernandez v. Cjaders Foods, Inc. (N.D.Cal. 2010) 2010 WL 1340777, at
p. *4.)   
 
To incentivize employees to
bring PAGA actions, the statute provides aggrieved employees 25 percent of the
recovered civil penalties. (Lab. Code § 2699, subd. (i).) The remaining 75 percent
is distributed to the Labor and Workforce Development Agency (“LWDA”) “for
enforcement of labor laws and education of employers and employees about their
rights and responsibilities under [the Labor Code].” (Id.) 
 
In reviewing the terms of a
settlement agreement, courts determine whether the settlement is fair,
reasonable, and adequate to all concerned, and not the product of fraud,
collusion, or overreaching. (Reed v. United Teachers Los Angeles (2012)
208 Cal.App.4th 322, 337; Nordstrom Commission Cases (2010) 186
Cal.App.4th 576, 581.) Although a PAGA plaintiff need not satisfy class action
requirements (see Arias v. Superior Court (2009) 46 Cal.4th 969, 975),
general principles applicable to class action settlements apply equally in this
context. 
In the context of a class
action settlement, courts consider various factors including whether (1) the
settlement is the result of arm’s length bargaining, (2) investigation and
discovery are sufficient to allow counsel and the court to act intelligently,
(3) counsel is experienced in similar litigation, and (4) the percentage of
objectors is small. (Nordstrom, supra, 186 Cal.App.4th at 581; Wershba v. Apple Computer, Inc. (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 224,
245.) The final factor is not
applicable to PAGA. (See Arias, supra 46 Cal.4th at p. 984
[rejecting the argument that representative actions under PAGA violate the due
process rights of “nonparty aggrieved employees who are not given notice of,
and an opportunity to be heard”].) “Because many of the factors used to
evaluate class action settlements bear on a settlement's fairness—including the
strength of the plaintiff's case, the risk, the stage of the proceeding, the
complexity and likely duration of further litigation, and the settlement
amount—these factors can be useful in evaluating the fairness of a PAGA
settlement.” (Moniz v. Adecco USA, Inc. (2021) 72 Cal.App.5th 56, 77.)
Furthermore, “a trial court should … determine whether [the settlement] is
fair, reasonable, and adequate in view of PAGA's purposes to remediate present
labor law violations, deter future ones, and to maximize enforcement of state
labor laws.” (Ibid.)
In considering the amount of
settlement, courts must be mindful that compromise is inherent and necessary in
the settlement process. (Wershba, supra, 91 Cal.App.4th at 250.) 
 
A proposed PAGA settlement must be submitted to LWDA
at the same time that it is submitted to the court for review and approval. 
(Lab. Code § 2699, subd. (l)(2).)
 
Attorney’s Fees Under Settlement
 
California Rules of Court, rule 3.769(b) requires that
“[a]ny agreement… with respect to the payment of attorney fees or the
submission of an application for the approval of attorney fees must be set
forth in full in any application for approval of the dismissal or settlement of
an action that has been certified as a class action.” Despite any agreement by
the parties to the contrary, “the court ha[s] an independent right and
responsibility to review the attorney fee provision of the settlement agreement
and award only so much as it determined reasonable.” (Garabedian v. Los
Angeles Cellular Telephone Co. (2004) 118 Cal.App.4th 123, 128.)
 
Discussion
 
Notice to LWDA
 
Plaintiff has shown that the proposed settlement was
submitted to LWDA. (Mooradian Decl., Ex. D.)
 
Fairness of Settlement
 
The PAGA settlement covers roughly 472 employees for the
period of March 2, 2022 through the date that the settlement becomes effective.
The PAGA settlement covers roughly 472 employees for the period of March 2,
2022 through the date that the settlement becomes effective. 
 
This is the second PAGA settlement that Defendant has
entered into. Defendant took the position in this case that the earlier
settlement resolved the alleged violations in this case. The liability in this
case is based on a set of payroll records that Defendant provided to Plaintiff,
which disclosed additional alleged violations.
 
The parties reached the settlement after a full day’s
mediation as well as follow-up negotiations. Plaintiff obtained roughly 70,000
lines of payroll records for the aggrieved employees from Defendant in
connection with the mediation.
 
The gross settlement amount is $240,000.00.
 
The settlement provides for a 35% attorney fee of $84,000.00
and litigation costs of $5,487.70. $6,500.00 is allocated to Phoenix Class
Action Administration Solutions. $5,000.00 is allocated as an enhancement
payment to Plaintiff for representing the PAGA class.
 
These computations leave $139,012.30. 75%, or $104,259.22,
will be paid to the LWDA and the remaining 25%, or $34,753.07, will be
distributed to the PAGA class. Each aggrieved employee will receive a portion
of this amount proportional to the amount of pay periods they worked during the
PAGA period out of the total number of pay periods worked by aggrieved
employees.
 
The attorney’s fees in the settlement, $84,000.00, make up 35%
of the total recovery. This portion of the recovery is unusually large. Given
the recovery and the facts of this case, the Court will not approve a
settlement in this amount.  Instead, the
Court approves the amount of $79,920.00 which is 33.3% of the recovery.
