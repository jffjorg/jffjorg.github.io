Summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling addresses the demurrer to the first, third, and fourth causes of action in the First Amended Complaint (FAC) filed by Plaintiff Irvin Smith against La Brea Rehabilitation Center, LLC, et al. The demurrer was filed by the defendants, who argue that the FAC does not state a cause of action for elder abuse, negligence, and violation of residents' rights.

The Judge rules that the demurrer to the first and third causes of action is overruled, but sustains the demurrer to the fourth cause of action with leave to amend. The Judge also denies the motion to strike Plaintiff's demands for attorney's fees, punitive damages, and injunctive relief.

The Judge's decision is based on the allegations in the FAC, which state that Plaintiff was a resident at La Brea Rehabilitation Center and suffered three falls due to the facility's chronic understaffing and lack of adequately trained staff. The Judge finds that Plaintiff has adequately pled his claims for elder abuse, negligence, and violation of residents' rights, and that the defendants' demurrer and motion to strike are without merit.
