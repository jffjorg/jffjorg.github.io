CASE
HISTORY:

02/15/19:
     Complaint filed.
01/11/22:
     First Amended Complaint filed

 
STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            Plaintiff was terminated by the
Los Angeles Police Department following a Board of Rights hearing regarding
misconduct by Plaintiff. Plaintiff alleges that her termination was in
retaliation for whistleblowing regarding misconduct of other police officers. 
 
Plaintiff moves to compel
Defendant’s compliance with its statement of production, and for sanctions. 
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Plaintiff moves to compel
Defendant’s compliance with its statement of production, and for sanctions. 
 
A motion to compel compliance is
authorized when a party responds to a request for production of documents and
thereafter fails to produce the documents. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.320.) Here,
however, Plaintiff contends that Defendant produced documents in response to
Requests for Production but thereafter asserted that a portion of the
production was subject to attorney-client privilege and demanded the return or
destruction of the privileged materials. (Declaration of Diana Wells ISO Mot.
¶¶ 4-7 Exhs. 1-2.) 
Although Plaintiff characterizes
this motion as seeking to compel production of these materials, Plaintiff is
more properly seeking to overrule Defendant’s assertion of privilege and demand
for the return or destruction of already-produced materials. Such relief is
governed not by Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.320, but by section
2031.285. Under subdivision (a) of this statute, if any electronically stored
information is produced in discovery which is subject to a claim of privilege,
the party making that claim may notify the recipient of the claim and the basis
for the claim. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.285(a).) After receiving such
notification, the recipient of the information “shall immediately sequester the
information and either return the specified information and any copies that may
exist or present the information to the court conditionally under seal
for a determination of the claim. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.285(b) [emphasis
added].) If the receiving party contests the legitimacy of the claim, the party
may seek a determination of the claim by making a motion within 30 days of
receiving the claim and presenting the information to the court
conditionally under seal. (Id. subd. (d)(1) [emphasis added].) Until the
claim is resolved, the recipient must preserve the information, keep the
information confidential, and is precluded from using it in any manner. (Code
Civ. Proc. § 2031.285(c)(1); (d)(2).) 
 
            Here,
Plaintiff admits that the claim of privileged was received on September 10,
2024. (Wells Decl. ¶ 6, Exh. 2.) Thus, Plaintiff had until October 10, 2024 to
challenge that claim under section 2031.285 subdivision (d)(1). This motion was
not made until November 18, 2024, more than a month after the deadline had
passed. Moreover, Plaintiff has not presented the information which is claimed
to be privileged to the Court conditionally under seal. Plaintiff has therefore
failed to bring a timely and procedurally proper motion to challenge an
assertion of privilege. 
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion to
Compel Compliance with Statement of Production is DENIED. 
 
Plaintiff’s request for sanctions
is DENIED. 
 
Moving Party to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.

            Any party may submit on the
tentative ruling by contacting the courtroom via email at Smcdept47@lacourt.org by no later than 4:00 p.m. the day
before the hearing. All interested parties must be copied on the email. It
should be noted that if you submit on a tentative ruling the court will still
conduct a hearing if any party appears. By submitting on the tentative you
have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you
should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an
order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
