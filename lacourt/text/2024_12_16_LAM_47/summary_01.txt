And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge, Theresa M. Traber, has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Nicole Mehringer v. City of Los Angeles, case number 19STCV05254. The case involves a motion to compel compliance with a statement of production and a request for sanctions. The plaintiff, Nicole Mehringer, was terminated by the Los Angeles Police Department after a Board of Rights hearing, and she alleges that her termination was in retaliation for whistleblowing.

The City of Los Angeles produced documents in response to the plaintiff's request for production, but then claimed attorney-client privilege and demanded the return or destruction of certain materials. The plaintiff argues that the City should be compelled to produce these materials, but the judge has ruled that the plaintiff failed to bring a timely and procedurally proper motion to challenge the City's assertion of privilege.

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to compel compliance with the statement of production and has also denied the plaintiff's request for sanctions. The judge has ordered the moving party to give notice of the ruling. Any party may submit on the tentative ruling by contacting the courtroom via email by 4:00 p.m. the day before the hearing.
