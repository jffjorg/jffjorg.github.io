And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendant's motion to tax costs claimed by the plaintiffs. The defendant, Alex Myung Cha, had moved to tax the costs claimed by the plaintiffs, Chester P. Kim, Howard Park, and Al Ilsoon Choe, in connection with their lawsuit seeking injunctive relief. The judge found that the defendant's motion was timely and that the challenged costs were reasonable and necessary to the conduct of the litigation. The judge also found that the defendant had not specifically identified the costs he sought to challenge, as required by California Rule of Court 3.1700(b). However, the judge overlooked this error and considered the motion on its merits with respect to the individual cost items being challenged. The judge found that the costs claimed by the plaintiffs were reasonable and necessary, and therefore denied the defendant's motion to tax costs.
