is DENIED. 
 
DISCUSSION:
 
Defendant Alex Myung Cha moves to
tax costs claimed in Plaintiffs’ Memorandum of Costs. 
 
Legal Standard 
 
In general, the “prevailing party” is entitled as a matter
of right to recover costs for suit in any action or proceeding. (Code Civ.
Proc. §1032(b); Santisas v. Goodin (1998) 17 Cal.4th 599, 606; Scott Co.
Of Calif. v. Blount, Inc. (1999) 20 Cal.4th 1103, 1108.)  Assuming the
“prevailing party” requirements are met, the trial court has no discretion to
order each party to bear his or her own costs of suit.  (Michell v.
Olick (1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 1194, 1198; Nelson v. Anderson (1999) 72
Cal.App.4th 111, 129.) 
 
Allowable costs under Section 1033.5 must be reasonably
necessary to the conduct of the litigation, rather than merely convenient or
beneficial to its preparation, and must be reasonable in amount.  An item
not specifically allowable under Section 1033.5(a) nor prohibited under
subdivision (b) may nevertheless be recoverable in the discretion of the court
if they meet the above requirements (i.e., reasonably necessary and reasonable
in amount).  If the items appearing in a cost bill appear to be proper
charges, the burden is on the party seeking to tax costs to show that they were
not reasonable or necessary. (Ladas v. California State Automotive Assoc.
(1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761, 773-774.)  On the other hand, if the items are
properly objected to, they are put in issue and the burden of proof is on the
party claiming them as costs.  (Ibid.) Whether a cost item was
reasonably necessary to the litigation presents a question of fact for the
trial court and its decision is reviewed for abuse of discretion.  (Ibid.) 
However, because the right to costs is governed strictly by statute, a court
has no discretion to award costs not statutorily authorized.  (Id.) 
Discretion is abused only when, in its exercise, the court “exceeds the bounds
of reason, all of the circumstances being considered.”  (Ibid.)   
 
Timeliness of Motion
 
“Any notice of motion to strike or to tax costs must be
served and filed 15 days after service of the cost memorandum. If the cost
memorandum was served by mail or email, the period is extended as provided in
Code of Civil Procedure section 1013.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1700(b)(1).) Here,
the Memorandum of Costs was served and filed on October 8, 2024. This motion
was served on October 17, 2024, nine days later. This motion is therefore
timely. 
 
Specificity of
Challenged Costs
 
            Defendant does not specifically
identify in the Notice of Motion which costs he seeks to challenge, as required
by California Rule of Court 3.1700(b). The Court would therefore be within its
discretion to deny the motion in its entirety. However, the Court observes that
Defendant’s memorandum of points and authorities refers to (1) a specific $420
charge for filing fees in the Cost Worksheet identified by page and line number;
and (2) interpreter fees listed in Item 13 of the memorandum of Costs. (See
Memorandum of Costs.) As Plaintiffs have not objected to the notice of motion
on this basis, the Court will overlook this error and consider the motion on
its merits with respect to the individual cost items being challenged.
 
Challenged
Costs
 
            Defendant challenges two sets of
costs: (1) a request for $420 in filing fees on page 4, line 23 of the
Memorandum, and (2) the request for interpreter fees in the amount of $2,820.00
in Item 13.
 
1.      Filing Fees
 
Defendant challenges a single request for $420 in filing
fees in connection with a witness list for a hearing on June 25, 2024 as
excessive. Plaintiffs state in response that the $420 amount is a typographical
error, and the proper amount should be $21.77. As Plaintiffs state, the total
costs claimed for filing fees in Item 1, amounting to $1,510.55, reflects this
reduced value. The Court therefore finds that the claimed costs need not be
taxed, the error in the cost memorandum notwithstanding. 
 
2.      Interpreter Fees
 
Defendant also challenges Plaintiffs’ request for
interpreter fees in Item 13, totaling $2,820, on the unsupported assertion that
no depositions were taken by the parties justifying $820 in interpreter fees
for depositions, and $2,000 in translation fees were not necessary. Bare
assertions are not sufficient to place the costs claimed in the memorandum of
costs at issue such that Plaintiffs are obligated to justify the costs. The
Court is therefore not persuaded that these costs should be taxed.  
 
CONCLUSION:

 
            Accordingly,
Defendant’s Motion to Tax Costs is DENIED. 
 
            Moving
Party to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.

            Any party may submit on the
tentative ruling by contacting the courtroom via email at Smcdept47@lacourt.org by no later than 4:00 p.m. the day
before the hearing. All interested parties must be copied on the email. It
should be noted that if you submit on a tentative ruling the court will still
conduct a hearing if any party appears. By submitting on the tentative you
have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you
should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an
order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
