And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the demurrer and motion to strike filed by Edge Property Management, Inc. (Edge Property) and has made the following findings.

The court has overruled Edge Property's demurrer to the sixth cause of action, which alleged private nuisance. The court found that Plaintiff Albin Pracki has sufficiently alleged facts supporting a claim for nuisance, including excessive 24-hour notices to enter the premises, which is a harassing and unreasonable interference with his use and enjoyment of the property.

The court has also denied Edge Property's motion to strike the prayer for punitive damages. The court found that Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged facts supporting a claim for punitive damages, including Edge Property's alleged harassment of Plaintiff via excessive 24-hour notices to enter.

The court's ruling is based on the pleadings and the court's own findings of fact. The court has considered the parties' arguments and has made a tentative ruling. The moving party is required to give notice of the ruling.
