BACKGROUND
On October 24, 2022, plaintiffs
Jorge Chilel and Everlido Chilel filed a complaint against Atlee George
Pollock, Mary Pollock, and Paul Carpenter for motor vehicle negligence and
general negligence based on an incident that occurred on October 30, 2020, at
Vallon Dr. and Hawthorne Blvd., Rancho Palos Verdes.
On March 29, 2023, plaintiff filed
a FAC, identifying Estate of Mary Pollock, deceased as a defendant.
On September 29, 2023, the court
granted plaintiffs’ counsel’s motion to be relieved as counsel.
On January 26, 2024, the court
granted defendants’ motions to compel discovery responses.
Trial is set for January 22, 2025.
LEGAL AUTHORITY
If a party fails to comply with a
court order compelling discovery responses or attendance at a deposition, the
court may impose monetary, issue, evidence, or terminating sanctions.  CCP § 2025.450(h) (depositions); §
2030.290(c) (interrogatories); § 2031.300(c) (demands for production of
documents).  CCP § 2023.030 provides
that, “[t]o the extent authorized by the chapter governing any particular
discovery method . . . , the court, after notice to any affected party, person,
or attorney, and after opportunity for hearing, may impose . . .  [monetary, issue, evidence, or terminating]
sanctions against anyone engaging in conduct that is a misuse of the discovery
process . . . .”  CCP § 2023.010 provides
that “[m]isuses of the discovery process include, but are not limited to, the
following: . . . (d) Failing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of
discovery. . . . (g) Disobeying a court order to provide discovery. . . .”  
“The trial court may order a
terminating sanction for discovery abuse ‘after considering the totality of the
circumstances:  [the] conduct of the
party to determine if the actions were willful; the detriment to the propounding
party; and the number of formal and informal attempts to obtain the
discovery.’”  Los Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal. App. 4th 377, 390
(quoting Lang v. Hochman (2000) 77
Cal. App. 4th 1225, 1246).  “Generally,
‘[a] decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly.  But where a violation is willful, preceded by
a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not
produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in
imposing the ultimate sanction.’”  Los Defensores, 223 Cal. App. 4th at 390
(citation omitted).
“Under this standard, trial courts
have properly imposed terminating sanctions when parties have willfully
disobeyed one or more discovery orders.” 
Los Defensores, 223 Cal. App.
4th at 390 (citing Lang, 77 Cal. App. 4th at 1244-1246 (discussing
cases)); see, e.g., Collisson &
Kaplan v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal. App. 4th 1611, 1617-1622 (terminating
sanctions imposed after defendants failed to comply with one court order to
produce discovery); Laguna Auto Body v.
Farmers Ins. Exchange (1991) 231 Cal. App. 3d 481, 491, disapproved on
other grounds in Garcia v. McCutchen
(1997) 16 Cal. 4th 469, 478, n. 4 (terminating sanctions imposed against
plaintiff for failing to comply with a discovery order and for violating
various discovery statutes).
DISCUSSION
Defendants Atlee Pollock, Estate of
Mary Pollock, deceased, and Paul Carpenter request an order imposing terminating
sanctions against plaintiffs Jorge Chilel and Everlido Chilel or, in the
alternative, imposing evidentiary sanctions.
On January 26, 2024, the court
granted defendants’ motions to compel responses to defendants’ form
interrogatories, special interrogatories, and demand for inspection and
production of documents, within twenty days. 
The court also ordered plaintiffs to pay sanctions in the amount of $380
each, within 30 days.  Plaintiffs did not
file an opposition.
Defense counsel states that to
date, defense counsel has not received responses and that plaintiffs failed to
pay sanctions.  See Catherine Walsh decl.
The court notes that a court may
not issue a terminating sanction for failure to pay a monetary discovery
sanction.  Newland v. Superior Court
(1995) 40 Cal. App. 4th 608, 610, 615.
The court rules as follows:  The court finds that plaintiffs have engaged
in conduct that is a misuse of the discovery process by disobeying the court’s January
26, 2024 order to serve responses without objections and to produce responsive
documents as directed by the court.  CCP
§§2023.010(g), 2023.030.  The court thus
finds that it is appropriate, and exercises its discretion, to impose
terminating sanctions.  CCP
§2023.030(d)(1).
Defendants also request monetary
sanctions in the amount of $560 against each plaintiff.  The court declines to impose additional
monetary sanctions as terminating sanctions are sufficient.
The motions are GRANTED.  
ORDER
The motions are GRANTED.
The First Amended Complaint is
DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.
Defendants are ordered to give
notice of the ruling.
