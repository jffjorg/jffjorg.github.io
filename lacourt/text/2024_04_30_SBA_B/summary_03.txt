And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer and motion to strike in a case involving plaintiff Paula Renee Pruitt and defendants Providence Health System – Southern California, Providence Little Company of Mary Medical Center Torrance, Kindred Hospital South Bay, Kindred Healthcare Operating, LLC, and Hosayn Khaleeli. The demurrer to the first cause of action for dependent adult abuse/neglect was sustained with leave to amend, and the motion to strike was granted with leave to amend as to the first cause of action and prayer at no. 1 for attorney's fees and prayer at no. 3 for punitive and exemplary damages. The court found that the allegations in the complaint were insufficient to meet the elements of the cause of action and did not show oppression, fraud, or malice or a conscious disregard of the high probability of such injury. The court also found that the allegations were insufficient as to ratification and did not allege the specific conduct of the moving defendant.
