Roles:
  - Judge: granted motions for terminating sanctions
  - Plaintiffs: failed to comply with court orders
  - Defendants: requested terminating sanctions
Significant Statements:
  - "Generally, a decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly. But where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction."
```

And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the defendants' motions for terminating sanctions against the plaintiffs, Jorge Chilel and Everlido Chilel. The ruling is based on the plaintiffs' failure to comply with court orders, including failing to respond to discovery requests and failing to pay previously ordered sanctions. The judge finds that the plaintiffs have engaged in conduct that is a misuse of the discovery process and concludes that terminating sanctions are appropriate. The ruling also dismisses the plaintiffs' complaint with prejudice.
