BACKGROUND
            Judgment was entered on November 3,
1987 in favor of plaintiffs Frank Wilson, Thelma Wilson, Johnnie Wilson, and
Lonnie Wilson against defendants Delta Homes, Inc., Delta Omni Corporation,
Corporate Development, Brad Handy, Joe Polifroni, Kevin Williams, Chris
Kalageris, and Theadore Kalogeris.  The
judgment was renewed on October 15, 1997 and on September 20, 2007 for
$427,670. 
On September 20, 2007, judgment
creditor filed a full satisfaction of judgment as to judgment debtor Joe
Polifroni’s pro-rata liability on the judgment. 

 
On February 25, 2015, the court
denied plaintiff Lonnie B. Wilson’s motion to revoke the acknowledgment of
assignment of judgment of the assignee of record, Attorney Collection Service,
Inc., and to revert all rights, title, and interest to the judgment to Lonnie
Wilson. 
On November 10, 2016, Lonnie Wilson
filed an application for and renewal of judgment for $721,519.  The judgment was renewed. 
In March 2017, the court denied a
similar motion as the one that was denied on February 25, 2015. 
On November 16, 2018, the court
denied a similar motion as the one filed in March 2017, except as to Acclaim
Credit Technologies.  
On November 25, 2019, plaintiff
Lonnie Wilson filed an acknowledgement of assignment of judgment, all rights
and interest to Rickie Joel Crocket, power of attorney for judgment creditor.
On January 16, 2020, the court
denied Lonnie Wilson’s order for an affidavit of identity as to Theodore
Kalogaris.
On July 24, 2020, the court denied
Lonnie Wilson’s motions for an affidavit of identity as to Theodore Kalogeris
and Chris Kalogeris. 
On April 6, 2023, Lonnie Wilson
filed a notice of renewal of judgment.
On August 28, 2023, Lonnie Wilson
filed a notice of renewal of judgment. 
On January 16, 2024, the court
granted in part Chris Kalogeris’ motion to vacate the judgment or, in the
alternative, to vacate and strike the renewals of judgment.  The court vacated and set aside the notices
of renewal of judgment filed on April 6, 2023 and August 28, 2023.
LEGAL AUTHORITY
Under CCP §1008(a), “When an
application for an order has been made to a judge, or to a court, and refused
in whole or in part, or granted, or granted conditionally, or on terms, any
party affected by the order may, within 10 days after service upon the party of
written notice of entry of the order and based upon new or different facts,
circumstances, or law, make application to the same judge or court that made
the order, to reconsider the matter and modify, amend, or revoke the prior
order.  The party making the application
shall state by affidavit what application was made before, when and to what
judge, what order or decisions were made, and what new or different facts,
circumstances, or law are claimed to be shown.” 
As stated by the court in Gilberd v. AC Transit (1995) 32 Cal.
App. 4th 1494, CCP §1008 governs reconsideration of court orders whether
initiated by a party or the court itself. 
“It is the exclusive means for modifying, amending or revoking an order.  That limitation is expressly
jurisdictional.”  Id. at 1499.    
CCP §128(a) states, “Every court
shall have the power to do all of the following: . . . (8) To amend and control
its process and orders so as to make them conform to law and justice. . . .”
DISCUSSION
            Plaintiff
Frank Wilson requests that the court reconsider its January 16, 2024 order
striking Wilson’s renewal of judgment.  
            Plaintiff
argues that the assignment to Attorney Collection Services, Inc. on August 8,
2005 was invalid.  Plaintiff contends
that it was not signed by Lonnie Wilson but purportedly by Cynthia Manning
through a power of attorney.  Manning states
in her declaration that she does not recall signing such a document and
believes that “any assignment through me as an assignee was a forgery or a
lifting of my signature from somewhere else.” 
Plaintiff argues that if this assignment never occurred, Lonnie Wilson
would be entitled to renew on his own.
            In
opposition, defendant argues that none of the “facts” offered by plaintiff are
new or warrant reconsideration by the court as he has assigned his rights to
the judgment three times to three different assignees.  Plaintiff’s attempts to revoke the
assignments were rejected by the court three times.  
            In
reply, plaintiff argue that equity weighs in favor of plaintiff.
            The
Court rules as follows:  Plaintiff has
not met its burden of showing new
or different facts, circumstances, or law that could not have been discovered
or presented earlier.  Further, plaintiff
appears to be requesting that the Court reconsider its rulings in 2015, 2017,
and 2018 denying plaintiff’s requests to revoke the assignments.  Plaintiff’s request is untimely.  
            The motion is DENIED.
ORDER
            The
motion for reconsideration is DENIED.
            Defendant
is ordered to give notice of ruling.
