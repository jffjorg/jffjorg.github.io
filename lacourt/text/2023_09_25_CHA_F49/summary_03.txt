And here is a summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants Mina Kateb's motion to compel production of tax records and denies Monocent's motion to quash the deposition subpoena. The court finds that Kateb has a right to discover tax records as a shareholder of Monocent, Inc. and that the company's objections to production were waived. The court also finds that Monocent's claims of privacy and privilege are not sufficient to bar production of the tax records. The judge orders Kateb to give notice on both orders and sets the motion to compel the deposition of Kateb for December 22, 2023.
