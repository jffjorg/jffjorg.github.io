And here is a summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants Mina Kateb's motion to compel production of tax records and denies Monocent's motion to quash the deposition subpoena. The court finds that Kateb has a right to discover tax records as a shareholder of Monocent, Inc. and that the company's objections to production were waived. The court also finds that Monocent's claims of privacy and privilege are not sufficient to bar production of the tax records. The judge orders Kateb to give notice on both orders and sets the motion to compel the deposition of Kateb for December 22, 2023.

## Tentative Ruling Summary: Case #22CHCV00236

**Case Number:** 22CHCV00236
**Plaintiff:** Monocent, Inc.
**Defendant:** Mina Kateb

**Summary:**

This case involves a dispute between Monocent, Inc. ("Plaintiff") and Mina Kateb ("Defendant") regarding alleged breach of fiduciary duty and other claims. 

**Key Points:**

* **Background:**
    * Kateb was formerly a managing director at Monocent.
    * Plaintiff alleges Kateb misappropriated trade secrets and diverted business opportunities for personal gain.
    * Defendant filed a cross-complaint alleging various claims against Plaintiff, including fraudulent representation and retaliation.
* **Discovery Dispute:** 
    * Defendant moved to compel the production of a tax report prepared for Plaintiff and to quash a subpoena for the report.
    * Plaintiff opposed the motion, arguing the subpoena was burdensome, irrelevant, and sought protected information.
* **Judge's Ruling:**
    * **Compels Production:** The judge granted Defendant's motion to compel production of the tax report, finding that Defendant, as a potential shareholder, has a right to access corporate records.
    * **Denies Protective Order:** The judge denied Plaintiff's motion for a protective order, finding insufficient grounds to protect the tax report from discovery.

* **Reasoning:**
    * The court found that Defendant waived objections to the subpoena by not formally objecting within the required timeframe.
    * While acknowledging the general privilege surrounding tax returns, the court determined that Defendant's potential shareholder status creates a compelling interest for production.
* **Further Proceedings:**
    * The court warned about potential future referral to a discovery referee due to the ongoing discovery disputes and urged parties to resolve issues collaboratively.
    * A motion to compel Kateb's deposition is scheduled for December 22, 2023.

**Case Summary: Tentative Ruling, Case Number 22CHCV00236, Hearing Date September 25, 2023, Dept. F49**

- **Parties:** Plaintiff Monocent, Inc., Defendant Mina Kateb (Cross-Complainant), Cross-Defendants Monocent, Inc., et al.
- **Dates:** April 7, 2022 (Complaint Filing), June 27, 2022 (Stipulation of Consolidation), December 30, 2022 (Clarification of Consolidation Stipulation), February 6, 2023 (Demurrer Ruling), March 8 and 15, 2023 (Answer and First Amended Answer Filing), May 10, 2022 (Cross-Complainant's Complaint Filing), June 27, 2023 (Answer to Second Amended Cross-Complaint Filing), August 21, 2023 (Nadia Taheri's Answer Filing)
- **Causes of Action:** Breach of Fiduciary Duty, Intentional Interference with Prospective Business Advantage, Negligent Interference with Prospective Economic Advantage, Intentional Interference with Contractual Relations, Violation of Business and Professions Code section 17200, Negligence, Fraud โ Intentional Misrepresentation, Fraud โ Negligent Misrepresentation, Misappropriation of Trade Secrets, Declaratory Relief, Fraudulent Representation, Unfair Competition, Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress, Defamation, Breach of Contract, Wrongful Constructive Termination, Negligence, Retaliation in Violation of Labor Code section 1102.5, Negligent Interference with Prospective Contractual Relations, Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress
- **Disputes:** Motion to Compel Compliance with the Deposition Subpoena, Motion to Quash Deposition Subpoena, Production of Daneshrad Tax & Audit Consultants report, Shareholder interest in Monocent, Inc., Scope of discovery, Privacy protections, Tax return privileges
- **Ruling:** Granted (Motion to Compel), Denied (Motion for Protective Order)
- **Significant Statements:** Kateb's waiver of objections due to the lack of formal objection, Monocent's failure to establish a privilege barring production of tax documents, Kateb's right to production of tax records as an alleged shareholder.

The tentative ruling grants the motion to compel compliance with the deposition subpoena seeking the Daneshrad Tax & Audit Consultants report prepared on behalf of Monocent, Inc. The court consolidates the motion to compel and the motion to quash into a single ruling. Kateb moves to compel based on a claim of a shareholder interest in Monocent, Inc., and the refusal to provide copies of records. Monocent declines to produce the records on grounds of denial of any shareholder interest in Monocent, Inc., and therefore a right to examination of the documents. The court finds a waiver of objections due to the lack of formal objection and rules in favor of Kateb's right to production of tax records as an alleged shareholder.
