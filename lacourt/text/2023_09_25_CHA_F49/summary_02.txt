```

And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies the Plaintiff's motion to strike the claim for punitive damages in the cross-complaint. The Plaintiff argues that a party cannot recover punitive damages in a non-insurance context without showing an independent duty, citing Freeman & Mills, Inc. v. Belcher Oil Co. (1995). The Defendant counters that the cross-complaint sufficiently alleges facts in support of a separate and independent basis for tortious conduct. The Judge declines to turn the motion into a demurrer and instead considers the unchallenged allegations to determine whether the cross-complaint sufficiently alleges a separate and independent basis for tortious conduct. The Judge concludes that the motion to strike is denied and orders the Defendant to answer within 20 days from the date of the order.

And here is the summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion to strike the claim for punitive damages in the second cause of action for breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The plaintiff, Ararat Yousefi, challenges the ability of a party to recover punitive damages on a bad faith cause in a non-insurance context. The defendant, Armen Vardanyan, argues that the cross-complaint sufficiently articulates facts in support of the claim for separate and independent conduct outside the contractual context.

The judge has considered the unchallenged allegations of the cross-complaint and has determined that the claim for punitive damages is not barred by the "general rule" precluding tort recovery in the non-insurance context. The judge has also considered the bootstrapped allegation of a fiduciary duty and has declined to make a determination regarding the validity of the claim.

The motion to strike is denied, and the cross-defendant is ordered to answer within 20 days from the date of this order. A motion for leave to amend is scheduled for January 30, 2024.
