```

And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies the Plaintiff's motion to strike the claim for punitive damages in the cross-complaint. The Plaintiff argues that a party cannot recover punitive damages in a non-insurance context without showing an independent duty, citing Freeman & Mills, Inc. v. Belcher Oil Co. (1995). The Defendant counters that the cross-complaint sufficiently alleges facts in support of a separate and independent basis for tortious conduct. The Judge declines to turn the motion into a demurrer and instead considers the unchallenged allegations to determine whether the cross-complaint sufficiently alleges a separate and independent basis for tortious conduct. The Judge concludes that the motion to strike is denied and orders the Defendant to answer within 20 days from the date of the order.
