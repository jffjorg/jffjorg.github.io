And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) moves to compel responses to form interrogatories (set one) from Evelyn Gallegos, the plaintiff. The motion is unopposed, and the court grants it. The court orders Gallegos to serve verified responses to the interrogatories without objections within ten days. The motion to compel responses to requests for production of documents is set for October 2, 2023, and LAUSD is to give notice. The court refrains from imposing sanctions due to Gallegos being a minor and her guardian parent possibly being unhoused.
