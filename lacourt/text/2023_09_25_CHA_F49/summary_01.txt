**English Summary:**

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting a motion by the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) to compel responses to interrogatories from Plaintiff, Evelyn Gallegos.  

The LAUSD served the interrogatories on Plaintiff's former counsel, and the court assumes the file was forwarded to the Plaintiff.  Since the motion is unopposed, the court has granted LAUSD's request. Plaintiff is ordered to respond to the interrogatories within ten days.

Due to Plaintiff being a minor and her guardian possibly being unhoused, the court has chosen not to impose sanctions for the late response.
