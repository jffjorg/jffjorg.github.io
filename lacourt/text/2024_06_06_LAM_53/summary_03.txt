And here is the English text summary of the tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses the defendants' motion, which includes a request to strike the original complaint. However, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint on February 2, 2024, which supersedes the original complaint. The court denies the defendants' motion to strike the original complaint as moot. Additionally, the court notes that the defendants failed to establish that IRDC Holdings, LLC is a foreign limited liability company transacting intrastate business in California. The court does not make a ruling on whether IRDC Holdings, LLC was required to pay taxes to California or whether it did pay taxes to California.
