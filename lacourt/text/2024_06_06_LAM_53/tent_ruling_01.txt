  RE:
 
defendant’s special motion to strike
  complaint (anti-slapp)
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Defendant Michelangelo Tatone        
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Plaintiff Matthew Arnold
Special Motion to Strike Complaint (Anti-SLAPP)
Defendant Michelangelo Tatone (“Defendant”) filed the pending special
motion to strike the complaint filed by Matthew Arnold (“Plaintiff”) on April
30, 2024, with a hearing date of June 6, 2024. 
For that hearing date, Plaintiff was required to file and serve opposition
papers by at least May 23, 2024.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1005, subd. (b) [“All papers opposing a motion so noticed shall
be filed with the court and a copy served on each party at least nine court
days . . . before the hearing”].) 
Plaintiff, however, filed and served an opposition on May 29, 2024, i.e.,
only six court days before the June 6, 2024 hearing on this motion.  (Opp., p. 141 [proof of service establishing
service on May 29, 2024].)  Thus,
Plaintiff’s opposition was not timely filed and served.  
The court finds that it is appropriate, and exercises its discretion,
to continue the hearing on Defendant’s motion so that (1) Defendant has an
opportunity to file substantive reply papers, and (2) the court has an
opportunity to consider Plaintiff’s opposition and Defendant’s reply papers. 
            The court orders that the hearing on defendant
Michelangelo Tatone’s special motion to strike plaintiff Matthew Arnold’s
complaint is continued from June 6, 2024, to July 3, 2024, at 10:00 a.m., in
Department 53. 
            The court orders that any reply
papers shall be filed and served at least five court days before the July 3,
2024 hearing on this motion.
            The court directs the clerk to give
notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  May 30, 2024
