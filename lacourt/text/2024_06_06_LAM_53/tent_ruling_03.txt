[1] Defendants’
motion is also directed to the initial complaint filed in this action.  However, Plaintiff filed its First Amended
Complaint on February 2, 2024.  “The
amended complaint furnishes the sole basis for the cause of action, and the
original complaint ceases to have any effect either as a pleading or a basis
for judgment.”  (State Compensation
Ins. Fund v. Superior Court (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 1124, 1131.)  The court denies Defendants’ motion to strike
the superseded complaint as moot.  (Ibid.)



[2]
Moreover, Defendants do not appear to present argument establishing that IRDC
Holdings, LLC is a foreign limited liability company “transacting intrastate
business” in California, and instead only assert that it is a foreign
limited liability company.  (Corp. Code,
§ 17708.07, subd. (a) [emphasis added].)

The court does not make a ruling as to whether (1) IRDC Holdings was required
to pay taxes to California, or         (2)
IRDC Holdings did pay taxes to California.
