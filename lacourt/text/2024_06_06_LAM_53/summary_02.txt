And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court denies the defendants' motion to strike the first amended complaint. The defendants have not met their burden to show that the complaint is not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of the state. The court also denies the defendants' motion for dismissal. The defendants have not shown that the plaintiff is an unregistered foreign limited liability company and therefore may not maintain this action. The court finds that the plaintiff, Immigrant Rights Defense Council, LLC, is a California limited liability company and not a foreign limited liability company. The court is concerned about the tone and content of the defendants' remarks, which include personal attacks and insults against the plaintiff's counsel. The court expects all parties and attorneys to govern their conduct with civility and professionalism.
