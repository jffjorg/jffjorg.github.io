COURT’S [TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE:       
Default
  Judgment 



[THE FOLLOWING IS A TENTATIVE RULING IN THE ABOVE CASE]:
 
I.               
BACKGROUND
 
Defendant
Karen C. Brown-Bakerman obtained (“Defendant”) two loans from Plaintiff Navy
Federal Credit Union (“Plaintiff”). (Complaint pp. 3-4.) On or about December
27, 2023, Defendant failed to make payments on the loans. (Complaint pp. 3-4.)
On June 12, 2024, Plaintiff filed a complaint against Defendant alleging two
causes of action for breach of contract. (Complaint pp. 2-4.)
 
On
August 26, 2024, the clerk entered default.
 
On
October 4, 2024, Plaintiff submitted a default application packet.
 
On
November 6, 2024, this court denied Plaintiff’s default application packet.
 
On
November 20, 2024, Plaintiff submitted additional documents supporting its
default application packet.
 
II.            
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1800 sets forth the requirements for default judgments.
In pertinent part, the rule dictates that a party must use form CIV-100 and
file the following documents with the clerk: (1) except in unlawful detainer
cases, a brief summary of the case identifying the parties and the nature of
plaintiff's claim; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in support of
the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4) a
memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a declaration of nonmilitary
status for each defendant against whom judgment is sought; (6) a proposed form
of judgment; (7) a dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought
or an application for separate judgment against specified parties under Code of
Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each
judgment; (8) exhibits as necessary; and (9) a request for attorney
fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.  (Cal.
Rules of Court, Rule 3.1800(a)(1)-(9).) 
 
III.          
DISCUSSION

 
Plaintiff
seeks default judgment against Defendant in the sum of $47,844.14.
 
Plaintiff’s
default judgment application is not compliant with California Rules of Court,
rule 3.1800.
 
The court
rejected Plaintiff’s default judgment application packet on November 6, 2024,
stating:
 
Plaintiff
seeks default judgment against Defendant in the sum of $47,844.14. For the
following reasons, Plaintiff’s default judgment application is not compliant
with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1800. Plaintiff has not submitted a
summary of the case. Plaintiff’s submitted exhibits do not support the damages
amount. Plaintiff seeks damages based on two loans. The first loan’s balance
totals $7,758.09. (Ex. A; Leroy Declaration ¶¶ 5, 7.) Leroy’s declaration cites
Exhibit A, which supports the damages amount sought for the first loan. (Ex. A;
Leroy Declaration ¶ 5.) The second loan balance purportedly totals $37,805.59.
(Leroy Declaration ¶¶ 6-7.) Leroy’s declaration cites Exhibit B to support the
second loan’s balance. (Leroy Declaration ¶ 6; Ex. B.) Exhibit B shows that the
second loan’s payments originally totaled $59,077.31, but Exhibit B does not
show that the current balance on the second loan is $37,805.59. (Ex. B.)
 
(Notice of
Rejection of Electronic Filing filed 11/06/24.) 
On
November 20, 2024, Plaintiff submitted an exhibit showing the outstanding loan
balance is $37,805.59. (Ex. B p. 4.) However, the declaration submitted with
that exhibit does not authenticate that document. (Leroy Declaration ¶ 6.) Moreover,
the Leroy declaration submitted on November 20, 2024, is dated October 2, 2024,
and therefore appears to be the same Leroy declaration Plaintiff submitted with
its first default judgment application packet.
 
IV.          
CONCLUSION
 
For the foregoing
reasons, Plaintiff’s default judgment application is denied.
