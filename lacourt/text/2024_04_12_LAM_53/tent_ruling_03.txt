The court
considered the moving papers, opposing declarations, and reply papers filed in
connection with each motion. 
DISCUSSION
            Plaintiff Austin Hammesfahr (“Plaintiff”)
filed, on August 16, 2023, the pending (1) motion to compel further responses
from Tiffany Summer Kjenstad, and (2) motion to compel further responses from
Luke Miller Kjenstad. 
            At
the time that Plaintiff filed these motions, defendants Tiffany Summer Kjenstad
(“T. Kjenstad”) and Luke Miller Kjenstad (“L. Kjenstad”) (collectively,
“Defendants”) were represented by attorney Peter Clinco (“Counsel”).  On April 20, 2022, Counsel filed an answer on
behalf of T. Kjenstad, which listed his address to be 1901 Avenue of the Stars,
Suite 1100, Los Angeles, California. 
(April 20, 2022 T. Kjenstad Answer, p. 1:1-5.)  On August 4, 2022, Counsel filed an answer on
behalf of L. Kjenstad, which listed his address to be 1901 Avenue of the Stars,
Suite 1100, Los Angeles, California. 
(Aug. 4, 2022 L. Kjenstad Answer, p. 1:1-5.)  Counsel did not file a Notice of Change of
Address or other documents with the court changing Counsel’s address of record
or listing a different address for Counsel. 
            Thus,
at the time that Plaintiff filed the pending motions, Counsel’s address of
record was 1901 Avenue of the Stars, Suite 1100, Los Angeles, California.  However, Plaintiff served his motions on
Defendants, through Counsel, at an address that was not Counsel’s address of
record.  (Aug. 16, 2023 POS-030 as to T.
Kjenstad, ¶ 5 [stating motion was served on Counsel at “668 North Coast
Hwy., Suite 406, Laguna Beach, CA, 92651”]; Aug. 16, 2023 POS-030 as to L.
Kjenstad, ¶ 5 [stating motion was served on Counsel at “668 North Coast
Hwy., Suite 406, Laguna Beach, CA, 92651”].)  Both Defendants have asserted that they have
not since been served with Plaintiffs’ motions to compel.  (T. Kjenstad Decl., ¶ 3; L. Kjenstad
Decl., ¶ 3.)  Thus, the court finds
that Plaintiff has not properly served Defendants with the motions to compel
their further discovery responses. 
            The
court also notes that Plaintiff filed defective proofs of service of the notice
of the court’s February 26, 2024 ruling on Defendants.  The proofs of service, although filed on
March 7, 2024, state that the notices of ruling were mailed on April 5, 2024,
and therefore are defective.  (Mar. 7,
2024 POS-030 as to T. Kjenstad, ¶ 3 and Attachment; Mar. 7, 2024 POS-030 as to
L. Kjenstad, ¶ 3 and Attachment.) 
            The
court therefore exercises its discretion to continue the hearing on Plaintiff’s
motions to ensure that Defendants are properly served with (1) the moving
papers filed in connection with the two motions, and (2) notice of the
continued hearing date on the motions. 
            The
court orders that the hearing on plaintiff Austin Hammesfahr’s motion to compel
further discovery responses from defendant Tiffany Summer Kjenstad and for a
trial continuance is continued to June 6, 2024, at 10:00 a.m., in
Department 53. 
            The
court orders that the hearing on plaintiff Austin Hammesfahr’s motion to compel
further discovery responses from defendant Luke Miller Kjenstad and for a trial
continuance is continued to June 6, 2024, at 10:00 a.m., in Department
53. 
The court orders plaintiff Austin Hammesfahr (1) to serve a notice of
this ruling on defendants Tiffany
Summer Kjenstad and Luke Miller Kjenstad, and to file a proof of service of the
notice of ruling with the court no later than May 6, 2024, and (2) to serve the
moving papers filed in connection with the motions to compel further discovery
responses on defendants Tiffany
Summer Kjenstad and Luke Miller Kjenstad, and to file a proof of service of the
moving papers with the court no later than May 6, 2024,
IT IS SO ORDERED.
