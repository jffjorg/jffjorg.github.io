Motion for Order Compelling Deposition Answers from Pamela Maxwell
The court
considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers filed in connection with
this motion.[1] 
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff DB Maple Avenue, LLC (“Plaintiff”) moves the court for an
order                      (1) compelling defendant Pamela Maxwell
(“Defendant”) to answer, at a deposition to be taken by Plaintiff’s counsel,
three questions: (i) “What did the note [passed to Defendant by her counsel]
say?[,]” (ii) “Are you being coached for this deposition?[,]” and (iii) “Are
you being told what to say at this deposition?[,]” and (2) awarding sanctions
in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant in the amount of $8,674.86.
“If a deponent fails to answer any question or to produce any
document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing under the
deponent’s control that is specified in the deposition notice or a deposition
subpoena, the party seeking discovery may move the court for an order
compelling that answer or production.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.480, subd. (a).)  “This motion shall be made no later than 60
days after the completion of the record of the deposition, and shall be
accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.480, subd.
(b).)  “A meet and confer declaration in
support of a motion shall state facts showing a reasonable and good faith
attempt at an informal resolution of each issue presented by the motion.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2016.040.) 
The court finds that Plaintiff did not submit a meet and confer
declaration that satisfies section 2016.040. 
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2025.480, subd. (b), 2016.040.) 
Plaintiff contends that its counsel met and conferred with Defendant’s
counsel prior to the filing of this motion (1) by asking Defendant’s counsel,
during the deposition, whether counsel intended to continue passing notes to
Defendant, and (2) by sending two letters dated December 18, 2023, and December
19, 2023.  (Mot., p. 13:1-15; Kashfian
Decl., ¶¶ 19-22; Kashfian Decl., Ex. 16, Maxwell Dep., pp. 25:8-13, 26:6-19,
19:2-28:16; Kashfian Decl., Exs. 17, 19.) 
First, the court finds that the conversation and statements made
between counsel during Maxwell’s deposition do not constitute a reasonable and
good faith attempt to informally resolve the issues presented in this
motion.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2016.040.) 
Second, the court finds that the December 18, 2023 letter does not
constitute a reasonable and good faith attempt to informally resolve the issues
presented in this motion.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2016.040.)  Although the
December 18, 2023 letter detailed the incident that occurred during Defendant’s
deposition (i.e., that Defendant’s counsel passed her a note and she, upon
instruction from counsel, did not answer questions related to its contents), Plaintiff’s
counsel did not attempt to informally address the issue outside of court or the
deposition.  (Kashfian Decl., Ex. 17,
Dec. 18, 2023 Letter, p. 2.)  Instead,
the letter stated that, while counsel would have “prefer[red] to find an
informal resolution[,]” counsel felt that, “under the circumstances[,]” counsel
was “left with no choice but to seek court intervention.”  (Ibid.)  The letter further advised Defendant of Plaintiff’s
intention that the letter would serve as notice that Plaintiff intended to file
a motion to compel the deposition of Defendant. 
(Id. at p. 3.)  It did not
request that Defendant again be produced for deposition voluntarily or suggest
other appropriate remedies outside of motion practice.  Thus, the court finds that this letter does
not set forth a reasonable and good faith attempt to informally resolve the
issues regarding the questioning of Defendant as to the three questions that
are the subject of this motion, and instead merely informed Defendant of the
motions (including the pending motion to compel Defendant’s answers) that
Plaintiff intended to file. 
Third, the court finds that the December 19, 2023 letter does not
constitute a reasonable and good faith attempt to informally resolve the issues
presented in this motion.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2016.040.)  As with the
December 18, 2023 letter, the December 19, 2023 letter recounted the issue
regarding Defendant’s questioning and informed Defendant of Plaintiff’s
intention to file a motion to compel answers at deposition.  (Kashfian Decl., Ex. 19, Dec. 19, 2023
Letter, pp. 2, 4, 5.)  This letter also did
not request that Defendant again be produced for deposition voluntarily or
suggest other appropriate remedies outside of motion practice.  Thus, the court finds that this letter does
not show that Plaintiff made a reasonable and good faith attempt to informally
resolve the issues regarding the questioning of Defendant as to the three
questions that are the subject of this motion. 
For the reasons set forth above, the court finds that Plaintiff has
not supported the pending motion with a meet and confer declaration that
satisfies section 2016.040 and therefore denies Plaintiff’s motion.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2025.480, subd.
(b), 2016.040.)
ORDER
            The court denies plaintiff DB Maple Avenue,
LLC’s motion for order compelling deposition answers from Pamela Maxwell and request
for monetary sanctions.  
 
 
            The court orders defendant Pamela
Maxwell to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  April 12, 2024
