  Order RE:
 
defendant’s demurrer to first amended
  complaint
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Defendant Susan Caldwell a/k/a
Caldwell Law Group            
 
RESPONDING PARTY:        Plaintiff Aaron Celious 
Demurrer to First Amended Complaint
The court considered the moving papers filed on December 8, 2023, in
connection with this demurrer.
The court did not consider the “[Amended] Demurrer to the
Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint Pursuant to CCP §430.10,” filed by
defendant Susan Caldwell aka Caldwell Law Group on March 27, 2024.  The amended demurrer was not served on
plaintiff Aaron Celious at least 16 court days (plus two court days for
electronic service) before the hearing on this demurrer in violation of Code of
Civil Procedure sections 1005, subdivision (b) and 1010.6, subdivision
(a)(3)(B).  (Amended Demurrer, p. 28
[proof of electronic service of amended demurrer on March 22, 2024, i.e., 14
court days before the hearing].)  
Although the moving defendant asserts that the amended version is
substantially identical to the original demurrer, except that it corrects the
citations to the operative complaint and removed some arguments, it appears
that the moving papers make a number of changes.  (Def. Mar. 25, 2024 Notice of Errata, p.
2:5-10.)  Specifically, it appears that
the amended demurrer makes many stylistic changes, and includes authorities not
included in the original demurrer.  For
example, the amended demurrer filed on March 27, 2024 adds footnote 1, which
was not set forth in the original demurrer. 
(Amended Demurrer, p. 7, n. 1.) 
The amended demurrer also argues that there was no lawful assignment of
claims and that the exception to California’s prohibition of assignment of
legal malpractice claims does not apply, citing White Mountains Reinsurance
Co. of Am. v. Borton Petrini, LLP (2013)
221 Cal.App.4th 890.  (Amended Demurrer,
pp. 7:19-23, 17:15-21.)  However, the
original demurrer filed on December 8, 2023 does not include this argument or
authority.  (Demurrer, pp. 7:15-21, 14:15-25.)

Thus, the court finds that
(1) the amended demurrer contains substantive changes from the original
demurrer, and (2) therefore the amended demurrer should have been filed and
served at least 16 court days (plus two court days for electronic service) on
plaintiff Aaron Celious before the hearing. 
Because the amended demurrer was not filed and served with the notice
required by Code of Civil Procedure section 1005, subdivision (b), the court
has not considered that filing. 
The court did not consider
the “Opposition to Demurrer,” filed by plaintiff Aaron Celious on April 10,
2024, because it was not filed and served at least nine court days before the
hearing as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 1005, subdivision (b).  
REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
The court grants defendant Susan
Caldwell a/k/a Caldwell Law Group’s request for judicial notice.  (Evid. Code, § 452, subd. (d).)  The court notes that it does not take judicial
notice of the truth of the matters asserted therein.  (Arce v. Kaiser Foundation Health Plan,
Inc. (2010) 181 Cal.App.4th 471, 482 [“the truth of matters asserted in
[court documents] is not subject to judicial notice”].) 
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff Aaron Celious (“Plaintiff”) filed the operative First
Amended Complaint in this action against defendants Susan L. Caldwell and
Caldwell Law Group on October 9, 2023, alleging five causes of action for (1)
professional negligence (legal malpractice); (2) breach of contract; (3) breach
of fiduciary duty; (4) constructive fraud; and (5) conversion. 
Defendant Susan Caldwell a/k/a Caldwell Law Group (“Defendant”) now
moves the court for an order sustaining her demurrer to each cause of action
alleged by Plaintiff in his First Amended Complaint.
The court overrules Defendant’s demurrer to the First Amended
Complaint in its entirety on the ground that Plaintiff does not have standing
to bring this action because (1) Plaintiff has expressly alleged—and therefore
the court must accept as true—that he entered into a representation agreement
with Defendant “that specifically named [Plaintiff] as the Client[,]” and
therefore has alleged facts to establish that he has standing to assert legal
malpractice claims against Defendant, and (2) even if Defendant had shown that
the allegations establish that Plaintiff was not a client of Defendant’s,
Defendant did not present evidence or argument showing that Plaintiff would not
have standing to allege claims other than legal malpractice against Defendant.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e); FAC ¶¶
22-23, 107 [“Plaintiff was the named client in the Contract for legal services
in the Unison matter”]; Borissoff v. Taylor & Faust (2004) 33
Cal.4th 523, 529 [“an attorney will normally be held liable for malpractice
only to the client with whom the attorney stands in privity of contract, and
not to third parties”] [emphasis added].) 
The court overrules Defendant’s demurrer to the first cause of action
for professional negligence (legal malpractice) because it states facts
sufficient to constitute a cause of action. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e).) 
As a threshold matter, the court notes that Defendant has organized the
demurrer’s arguments into three sections: (1) lack of standing (discussed
above), (2) the sufficiency of the “Unison Claims,” and (3) the sufficiency of
the “Shah Claims.”  (Demurrer, pp. 14:15
[Sec. IV, Standing], 15:2 [Sec. V, Unison Claims], 20:10 [Sec. VI, Shah
Claims].)  As to the sufficiency of the
Unison Claims, it appears that Defendant has challenged the claims insofar as
they allege legal malpractice.  Defendant
has not specifically addressed the second through fifth causes of action.  Thus, the court evaluates Defendant’s
argument regarding the Unison Claims in the context of the first cause of
action for professional negligence (legal malpractice) only. 
First, the court finds that Defendant has not shown that this cause of
action is barred by the statute of limitations. 
“An action against an attorney for a wrongful act or omission, other
than for actual fraud, arising in the performance of professional services
shall be commenced within one year after the plaintiff discovers, or through
the use of reasonable diligence should have discovered, the facts constituting
the wrongful act or omission, or four years from the date of the wrongful act
or omission, whichever occurs first.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 340.6, subd. (a).)  However, that time period “shall be tolled
during the time that any of the following exist: [¶¶] (2) The attorney
continues to represent the plaintiff regarding the subject matter in which the
wrongful act or omission occurred.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 340.6, subd. (a)(2).)  
The court acknowledges that Plaintiff has alleged that (1) he executed
a retainer agreement with Illinois counsel on August 9, 2019, (2) Illinois
counsel litigated the Unison action on Plaintiff’s behalf from August 2019 and
January 2022, and (3) Defendant “had limited involvement with the case after
August 2019.”  (FAC ¶¶ 57, 61, 58.)  However, these allegations appear to indicate
that Defendant did perform at least some work on behalf of Plaintiff after
August 2019, which would toll the one-year period beyond August 2020.  (FAC ¶ 58 [Defendant “had limited
involvement with the case after August 2019”]; Code Civ. Proc., § 340.6,
subd. (a)(2).)  Whether Defendant
performed work only tangentially related to the legal representation was not
pleaded in the First Amended Complaint. 
(Lockton v. O’Rourke (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 1051, 1064 [“‘the
limitations period is not tolled when an attorney’s subsequent role is only
tangentially related to the legal representation the attorney provided to the
plaintiff’”].)  Moreover, Defendant has
not pointed to any specific matters set forth in the judicially noticed
documents establishing that Defendant did not perform work on behalf of
Plaintiff in the Unison action after August 2019.  (Demurrer, p. 17:5-6 [referencing court
record without citation].) 
Thus, while this cause of action may be barred by the one-year statute
of limitations, the court finds that Defendant has not shown that this cause of
action is necessarily barred.  (Raja
Development Co., Inc. v. Napa Sanitary District (2022) 85 Cal.App.5th 85,
92 [“A demurrer based on a statute of limitations will not lie where the action
may be, but is not necessarily, barred”] [internal citations and quotations
omitted].) 
Second, Defendant argues that Plaintiff’s allegations that Defendant
should have argued that Maroon was a third-party beneficiary of the Unison
contract “is a fundamentally flawed argument.” 
(Demurrer, p. 17:17.)  However,
Defendant has not addressed Plaintiff’s other allegations that Defendant
breached her duty to Plaintiff to use “the skill and diligence needed to
overcome the heavy burden of ‘forum selection’” by failing to show “that
enforcing the Illinois forum selection clause of the subcontract would be
unreasonable due to fraud or undue influence, California public policy, or
prohibitive difficulty.”  (FAC
¶ 43.)  Thus, Defendant has not
shown that the entire cause of action for legal malpractice based on the
alleged failure to successfully defend against the motion to transfer fails.  (PH II, Inc. v. Superior Court (1995)
33 Cal.App.4th 1680, 1682 [“A demurrer does not lie to a portion of a cause of
action”].) 
            Third, although Defendant contends
that Plaintiff has not pleaded actual injury, the court disagrees.  Plaintiff has alleged that, as a result of
Defendant’s conduct, Plaintiff’s action was transferred to Illinois “where a
settlement was reached for far less than what Plaintiff would have been able to
secure[.]”  (FAC ¶¶ 20, 62
[Defendant knew that transferring the case to Illinois “would reduce the value
of the case from both a settlement and trial perspective”], 63 [the settlement
with Unison “left Plaintiff in a deficit of $181,218.41”], 110 [Defendant’s
conduct “was a substantial factor in Plaintiff’s exceedingly deficient
settlement with Unison” and the proper handling of the complaint and opposition
to the motion to dismiss or transfer “would have resulted in a collectible
judgment or settlement for a much higher amount”]; Namikas v. Miller (2014)
225 Cal.App.4th 1574, 1582 [“The plaintiff must prove, by a preponderance of
the evidence, that but for the attorney’s negligent acts or omissions, he would
have obtained a more favorable judgment or settlement in the action in which
the malpractice allegedly occurred”].) 
            The court overrules Defendant’s
demurrer to the second cause of action for breach of contract because it states
facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e).) 
            As a threshold matter, the court
notes that it is unclear which causes of action Defendant challenges in section
six of the demurrer, entitled “The Shah Claims (Also) Fail to State a Cause of
Action.”  Although Defendant briefly
mentions the conversion and fraud causes of action (Demurrer, p. 22:3-4),
Defendant does not mention any other cause of action.  It appears that Defendant primarily
challenges the second cause of action for breach of contract (which is based,
in part, on the alleged incompetence in performing professional duties on the
part of Defendant in the Shah action). 
The court finds that Defendant has not shown that the second cause of
action for breach of contract does not state facts sufficient to constitute a
cause of action since Defendant has not shown that this cause of action does
not allege damages.  (FAC ¶¶ 20, 63,
104.) 
Moreover, although Defendant has argued that Plaintiff’s damages fall
below the jurisdictional minimum, improper classification is not a ground for
demurrer.  (Demurrer, pp. 20:26-1,
22:5-6; Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10 [grounds for demurrer].) 
 The court overrules Defendant’s
demurrer to the fourth cause of action for constructive fraud because it states
facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action since Plaintiff has pleaded
facts with the requisite particularity in support of this cause of action.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e); FAC
pp. 5:20-6:11 [chart of alleged misrepresentations and dates thereof]; FAC
¶¶ 28, 38, 130-133; Lauckhart v. El Macero Homeowners Assn. (2023) 92 Cal.App.5th 889, 903-904
[describing particularity requirement for fraud].) 
The court overrules Defendant’s demurrer to the fifth cause of action
for conversion because it states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of
action since (1) Plaintiff has pleaded specific facts in support of this cause
of action, and (2) Defendant has not argued or shown that Plaintiff did not
plead facts establishing any particular element of this cause of action.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e); Lee
v. Hanley (2015) 61 Cal.4th 1225, 1240 [elements of conversion claim]; Demurrer,
p. 22:3-5 [arguing only that this cause of action does not meet specificity
requirement].)
