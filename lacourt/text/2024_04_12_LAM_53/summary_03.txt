This tentative ruling is issued by Judge Robert B. Broadbelt III regarding a hearing scheduled for April 12, 2024. The plaintiff, Austin Hammesfahr, filed two motions to compel further responses from defendants Tiffany Summer Kjenstad and Luke Miller Kjenstad, and for a trial continuance. The court finds that the plaintiff did not properly serve the defendants with the motions, and that the plaintiff filed defective proofs of service. The court exercises its discretion to continue the hearing to ensure that the defendants are properly served and to give the plaintiff an opportunity to correct the defects in the service. The court orders that the hearing will be continued to June 6, 2024, and that the plaintiff must serve a notice of this ruling on the defendants and file a proof of service with the court no later than May 6, 2024.
