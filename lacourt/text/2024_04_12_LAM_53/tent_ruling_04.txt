MOVING PARTY:                 Petitioner J.G. Wentworth
Originations, LLC
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Berkshire Hathaway Life Insurance Company of Nebraska
First Amended Verified Petition for Approval for Transfer of Payment
Rights
The court
considered the moving and responding papers filed in connection with the First
Amended Petition. 
BACKGROUND
Claimant Robert Hufstader
(“Hufstader”) settled a personal injury claim on or about July 15, 2021, which
entitled Hufstader to certain structured settlement payments.  (First Amended Pet. filed March 13, 2024
(“Pet.”), ¶ 3.)  Hufstader has
agreed to sell, and petitioner J.G. Wentworth Originations, LLC (“Petitioner”)
has agreed to purchase, 211 monthly payments of $2,890 each, beginning on March
1, 2024 and ending on September 1, 2041. 
(Pet., Ex. A, California Purchase Contract, ¶ 2.)  Hufstader will receive $285,000 in exchange
for transfer of the payment rights set forth above.  (Pet., Ex. A, California Purchase Contract,
¶ 10.) 
Petitioner
now seeks court approval of the transfer agreement pursuant to Insurance Code
section 10134 et seq.  
LEGAL STANDARD
“A
direct or indirect transfer of structured settlement payment rights is not
effective and a structured settlement obligor or annuity issuer is not required
to make any payment directly or indirectly to any transferee of structured
settlement payment rights” unless the court approves the transfer in advance.¿
(Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (a).)¿ To approve the settlement, the court must
make express written findings that:¿¿¿ 

The transfer is in the best interest of the payee, taking into
     account the welfare and support of the payee’s dependents.¿¿¿¿¿ 


The payee has been advised in writing by the transferee to seek
     independent professional advice regarding the transfer and has either
     received that advice or knowingly waived, in writing, the opportunity to
     receive the advice.¿¿¿¿¿ 


The transferee has complied with the notification requirements
     pursuant to paragraph (2) of subdivision (f), the transferee has provided
     the payee with a disclosure form that complies with Section 10136, and the
     transfer agreement complies with Sections 10136 and 10138.¿¿¿¿¿ 


The transfer does not contravene any applicable statute or the order
     of any court or other government authority.¿¿¿¿¿ 


The payee understands the terms of the transfer agreement, including
     the terms set forth in the disclosure statement required by Section
     10136.¿¿¿¿¿ 


The payee understands and does not wish to exercise the payee’s
     right to cancel the transfer agreement.¿¿¿¿¿ 

(Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (a)(1)-(6).)¿¿
“When
determining whether the proposed transfer should be approved, including whether
the transfer is fair, reasonable, and in the payee’s best interest, taking into
account the welfare and support of the payee’s dependents, the court shall
consider the totality of the circumstances,” including the 15 circumstances set
forth in Insurance Code § 10139.5, subdivision (b)(1)-(15).¿¿¿¿¿ 
DISCUSSION
Based on the First Amended Verified Petition, the documents submitted
in support of the petition, and the response of Berkshire Hathaway Life
Insurance Company of Nebraska (“Berkshire”), the court finds and orders as
follows. 
First, the court notes that Berkshire has asserted that the First
Amended Petition does not confirm Hufstader’s address, as required by Insurance
Code section 10139.5.  (Ins. Code,
§ 10139.5, subd. (c)(1) [every petition shall include the payee’s name,
address, and age].)  While the petition
itself does not set forth Hufstader’s address, the court finds that Petitioner
has substantially complied with section 10139.5, subdivision (c) by (1) setting
forth Hufstader’s address on the proof of service attached to the petition, and
(2) submitting Hufstader’s declaration, in which Hufstader states his
address.  (Pet., p. 41; Second
Supplemental Declaration of Payee (“Hufstader Decl.”), ¶ 1.) 
Second, Berkshire has challenged the sufficiency of Petitioner’s
notice to Hufstader’s settling attorney. 
If a payee has entered into a structured settlement “within five years
prior to the date of the transfer agreement, then the transferee shall provide
[the notice set forth by statute] to the payee’s attorney of record at the time
the structured settlement was created, if the attorney is licensed to practice
in California, at the attorney’s address on file with the State Bar of
California.”  (Ins. Code, § 10139.5,
subd. (f)(2)(L).) 
Petitioner has filed proofs of service establishing that it served
Hufstader’s settling attorney, Joseph Hekmat (“Hekmat”), with the First Amended
Verified Petition, supporting documents, and the statutory notice at the
address 9701 Wilshire Boulevard, Suite 1000, Beverly Hills, California,
90212.  (Pet., pp. 40-41 [proof of
service of Pet.], Hufstader Decl., pp. 3-4 [proof of service of Hufstader’s
declaration], First Amended Notice to Settlement Attorney, pp. 5-6 [proof of
service of notice].)  In its responding
papers, Berkshire asserts that Hekmat’s address with the State Bar of
California is 2121 Avenue of the Stars, Suite 800, Los Angeles, California
90067.  It does not appear that Berkshire
submitted a copy of the State Bar’s website setting forth this address.  However, the court (1) has conducted an
attorney search on the State Bar of California’s website and has determined
that Hekmat’s current address with the State Bar is 2121 Avenue of the Stars, Suite
800, Los Angeles, California, 90067, and (2) takes judicial notice of the
California State Bar results showing Hekmat’s address.  (People v. Vigil (2008) 169
Cal.App.4th 8, 12, n. 2 [taking judicial notice of State Bar records]; Evid.
Code, § 452, subd. (h).)  Petitioner
has not filed a reply with the court addressing this issue with service. 
Thus, the court finds that Petitioner has not complied with Insurance
Code section 10139.5, subdivision (f)(2)(L), because Petitioner has not served
the statutory notice on Hufstader’s settling attorney, Hekmat, “at the
attorney’s address on file with the State Bar of California.”
Third, the court notes that, other than the service issue regarding
Hekmat set forth above, Berkshire “does not dispute that the proofs of service
related to the immediate Petition now appear facially adequate.”  (Berkshire Response, p. 12:3-9.) 
Fourth, the court finds that the transfer is in the best interest of
Hufstader, taking into account that he (1) is unmarried and has no children,
and (2) plans to use the funds to cover his ongoing caregiving needs and to
fund litigation against his former caregiver. 
(Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (a)(1), Hufstader Decl., ¶ 3;
Declaration of Hufstader filed February 1, 2024 (“Orig. Hufstader Decl.”),
¶ 11.) 
Fifth, the court finds that Hufstader has been advised, in writing, by
Petitioner to seek independent professional advice and has knowingly waived the
opportunity to receive advice in writing. 
(Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (a)(2); Pet., Ex. D, California Statement
of Professional Representation, p. 1 [Dec. 5, 2023 signature of Hufstader
waiving opportunity to receive independent professional representation].) 
Sixth, the court finds that Petitioner has complied with the
notification requirements pursuant to paragraph (2) of subdivision (f), that
Petitioner has provided Hufstader with a disclosure form that complies with
Insurance Code section 10136, and the transfer agreement complies with sections
10136 and 10138.  (Ins.
Code, § 10139.5, subd. (a)(3).) 
Insurance
Code section 10139.5, subdivision (f)(2) requires Petitioner to file and serve,
not less than 20 days before the hearing on a petition for approval of a
transfer of payment rights, a notice of the proposed transfer and the petition
for its authorization, a copy of the proposed transfer agreement, a listing of
each of the payee’s dependents, disclosures as required by section 10136, and,
if available, copies of the annuity contract, any qualified assignment
agreement, and the underlying structured settlement agreement.¿¿ 
On March
13, 2024, Petitioner filed its operative First Amended Petition and a proof of
service attached thereto establishing that Petitioner served the amended
petition, by mail, on Hufstader, the annuity issuer (i.e.,
Berkshire), and the annuity obligor. 
(Pet., pp. 40-41 [proof of service].) 
The First
Amended Petition includes a copy of the proposed California Purchase Contract
(Pet., Ex. A), the California Disclosure Statement (Pet., Ex. B), and the
California Statement of Professional Representation (Pet., Ex. D).  Petitioner has also served those parties with
Hufstader’s second supplemental declaration, the notice to the
settlement attorney, and the second amended notice of the hearing on
Petitioner’s pending petition. 
(Hufstader Decl., pp. 3-4; Notice to Settlement Attorney, pp. 5-6;
Second Amended Notice filed Mar. 12, 2024, pp. 4-5.)  The court therefore finds that Petitioner has
substantially complied with the notification requirements. 
Section
10136 requires that the transfer agreement include certain information and comply
with certain requirements, including that it be written in 12-point type, state
it will not be effective until a court enters a final order approving it and
that payment can be delayed, and set forth certain information, including the
net amount to be paid to the payee.¿ (Ins. Code, § 10136, subd. (c).)¿ Section
10138 includes additional requirements, including that a transfer agreement
cannot waive the seller/payee’s right to sue, require the seller/payee to
indemnify the buyer, or require the seller/payee to pay the buyer’s attorneys’
fees and costs.¿¿ (Ins. Code, § 10138, subd. (a).)¿ Petitioner has submitted a
copy of the form entitled “California Disclosure Statement,” which was signed
by Hufstader.  (Pet., Ex.
B, California Disclosure Statement.)  The
court finds that this disclosure complies with Section 10136.  The court further finds that the transfer
agreement complies with Sections 10136 and 10138.  (Pet., Ex. A, California Purchase Contract.) 
Seventh, the court finds that the transfer does not contravene any
applicable statute or the order of any court or other government
authority.  (Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (a)(4).)  
Eighth, the
court finds that Hufstader understands the terms of the transfer agreement,
including the terms set forth in the disclosure statement required by Section
10136.  (Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd.
(a)(5); Hufstader Decl., ¶ 3; Orig. Hufstader Decl., ¶ 13.) 
Ninth, the
court finds that Hufstader understands and does not wish to exercise his right
to cancel the transfer agreement.  (Ins.
Code, § 10139.5, subd. (a)(6); Hufstader Decl., ¶ 3; Orig. Hufstader
Decl., ¶ 13.) 
Thus, the court finds that Petitioner has satisfied the requirements
set forth in Insurance Code section 10139.5, subdivision (a).  
However, as set forth above, the court has found that Petitioner has
not shown that it served Hufstader’s prior attorney with the notice set forth by statute “at the
attorney’s address on file with the State Bar of California” as required.  (Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (f)(2)(L).)  The court therefore exercises its discretion
to continue the hearing on Petitioner’s First Amended Petition in order to
afford Petitioner an opportunity to serve Hufstader’s prior attorney at the
address on file with the State Bar of California.[1]
ORDER
            The court orders that the hearing on
petitioner J.G. Wentworth Origination, LLC’s First Amended Verified Petition
for Approval for Transfer of Payment Rights is continued to June 3, 2024, at
10:00 a.m., in Department 53. 
            The court orders petitioner J.G.
Wentworth Originations, LLC (1) to file and serve a notice of the court’s
ruling on all interested parties, and to file the notice of ruling and a proof
of service establishing service of the notice of ruling on those parties no
later than May 6, 2024, and (2) to serve Robert Hufstader’s prior attorney with
the notice required by Insurance Code section
 
10139.5,
subdivision (f), at the correct address, and to file a proof of service of that
notice with the court no later than May 6, 2024.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
