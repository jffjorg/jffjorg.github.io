Significant Statements:

  - "An arbitration agreement may be applied retroactively to transactions which occurred prior to execution of the arbitration agreement." (Salgado v. Carrows Restaurants, Inc.)
  - "The same reasoning [that a contracting party may agree to an arbitration clause that applies retroactively if the clause explicitly applies to all claims relating to the employment] applies here, where the contracting party (Oswald's union) agreed to retroactively modify and clarify an existing arbitration clause." (Oswald v. Murray Plumbing & Heating Corp.)
```

And here is a brief English summary of the tentative ruling:

The court has ruled that the defendants' motion to compel arbitration is denied. The defendants, Hathaway Dinwiddie Construction Company and Hathaway Dinwiddie Construction Group, argued that the 2022-2026 Master Labor Agreement (MLA) requires arbitration of the plaintiff's claims, but the court found that the MLA does not apply retroactively to the plaintiff's claims, which were made before the MLA went into effect. The court also found that the defendants did not show that the Laborers Union's entry into the MLA leads to an automatic application of the MLA's terms to members who left the union prior to the execution of the MLA. As a result, the court denied the defendants' motion to compel arbitration.
