And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion to amend the judgment filed by Ibiere Seck and Seck Law, P.C. The motion seeks to correct a clerical error in the judgment entered on May 25, 2024, which incorrectly lists Brian J. Dunn as the cross-defendant. The court finds that the error is clerical in nature and can be corrected without involving judicial discretion. The court concludes that the cross-complaint was filed against The Cochran Firm California explicitly, and a judgment was granted for Ibiere Seck and against The Cochran Firm California. Therefore, the court can amend the judgment to correct the error and reflect the correct identity of the cross-defendant.
