  Case Number:  23CHCV02377    Hearing Date:   September 25, 2024    Dept:  F47 SECOND AMENDED  MOTION FOR ORDER WAIVING OBJECTIONS  &  FOR SANCTIONS    Motion filed on 8/5/24.   MOVING PARTY: Defendants Joy Weber and Weber Training  Stables RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff Alexander Griffiths NOTICE: ok   RELIEF REQUESTED: An order  pursuant to CCP 2033.280 that all objections posed by Plaintiff Alexander  Griffiths in his response to Request for Admissions be waived, and for  sanctions against Plaintiff in the amount of $3,500.00 pursuant to CCP 2033.280.    RULING: The motion is denied.   SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY   This action arises out of Plaintiff Alexander Griffiths  (Plaintiff) claim that he was attacked by a horse boarded by Defendants Weber  Training Stables and Joy Weber (collectively, Defendants) who were allegedly  aware of the vicious propensities of the horse.   On 8/8/23, Plaintiff filed this action against Defendants and Doe  Defendants (1-20) for: (1) General Negligence (against all defendants), (2) Premises  Liability (against Defendants) and (3) Strict Liability for Domestic Animal  Attack (against all defendants).   Defendants claim that Requests for Admissions were served  on Plaintiff on 6/1/24 and Plaintiff served untimely responses to the Requests  for Admission on 7/11/24 which included objections.  (See Motion, Ex.A, B).  As a result, on 8/1/24, Defendants filed and  served their initial motion for waiver of objections and for sanctions which  did not include any exhibits.  On 8/1/24,  Plaintiff filed and served another motion for waiver of objections and for  sanctions which included the discovery requests and responses thereto as an  exhibit.  On 8/2/24, Defendants served  and on 8/5/24, Defendants filed the instant second amended notice of motion and  motion seeking an order pursuant to CCP 2033.280 that all objections posed by  Plaintiff in his response to Request for Admissions be waived, and for  sanctions against Plaintiff in the amount of $3,500.00 pursuant to CCP  2033.280.  Defendants have filed and  served an opposition and Plaintiff has filed a reply to the opposition.   ANALYSIS   It is not clear which version of the motion Plaintiff is  addressing in the opposition.  The  opposition contends that the motion was served by mail on 7/25/24 and does not  include the discovery as an exhibit.  (See  Opposition, p.2:6-7, p.3:22-23; Gerome Decl. ¶¶13-14).  While the first motion filed and served by  Defendants did not include exhibits, the subsequently filed motions do include  exhibits and none of the proofs of service attached to the motions indicate  that any of them were served on 7/25/24 by mail.  This ruling addresses the Second Amended  Notice of Motion and Motion for Order Waiving Objections and for Sanctions  served on 8/2/24 and filed on 8/5/24.   There is a genuine dispute regarding when the underlying  Requests for Admissions were served.   Defendants’ counsel contends that they were served by mail on 6/1/24  making responses due on or before 7/6/24.   (Husband Decl.).  However,  Plaintiff’s counsel contends that the discovery was received in the mail on  6/11/24 without a proof of service; therefore, Plaintiff’s counsel presumed  responses were due on or before 7/11/24.   (Gerome Decl.).  Even accepting  Defendants’ claim that the responses were not timely served, the motion fails  for several reasons.   First, Defendants fail to give clear notice of the relief  requested.  See CRC  3.1110(a).  In the notice of motion,  Defendants indicate that they seek an order pursuant to CCP 2033.280 that all  objections posed by Plaintiff in his responses to Requests for Admission be  waived, and for sanctions pursuant to CCP 2033.280.  (See Second Amended Motion, p.1:24-p.2:1).  However, the proposed Order submitted with  the motion is titled as an “Order Deeming Admitted Truth of Facts and  Genuineness of Documents and Imposing Monetary Sanctions.”  (See Second Amended Motion, pdf p.32-33).  However, the body of the proposed order merely  asks that the objections be waived and that Plaintiff be ordered to pay  sanctions.  Id.    Second, Defendants base this motion on CCP 2033.280 which  provides:    “If a party to whom requests for  admission are directed fails to serve a timely response, the following rules  apply: (a) The party to whom the requests  for admission are directed waives any objection to the requests, including one  based on privilege or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4  (commencing with Section  2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on  its determination that both of the following conditions are satisfied: (1) The  party has subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance  with Sections 2033.210, 2033.220, and 2033.230. (2)  The party's failure to serve a timely response was the result of mistake,  inadvertence, or excusable neglect.  (b) The requesting party may move  for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters  specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary  sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section  2023.010). (c) The court shall make this  order, unless it finds that the party to whom the  requests for admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the  motion, a proposed response to the requests for admission that is in  substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.  It is mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7  (commencing with Section  2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a  timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion.”   Nothing in CCP 2033.280 provides authority for the Court ordering  the waiver of objections included in untimely responses.  If the statute provided for such relief, it  would seem to render the language in CCP 2033.280(c) which provides that the  Court shall deem matters admitted, “unless it finds that the party to whom the  requests for admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the  motion, a proposed response to the requests for admission that is in  substantial compliance with Section 2033.220” meaningless.    Here, Plaintiff served responses to the subject Requests  for Admissions well before Defendants filed and served any of their motions  seeking an order waiving Plaintiff’s objections to same.  As such, Defendants were required to meet and  confer regarding the responses which they deemed to be deficient and if the  matter could not be informally resolved, Defendants were required to timely  file and serve a motion to compel further responses accompanied by a separate  statement.  See CCP 2033.290; CRC  3.1345.    Further, contrary to Defendants’ assertion, if  Plaintiff’s responses are deemed untimely, Plaintiff has made a sufficient  showing that relief from waiver of objections is warranted.  Plaintiff has served responses in substantial  compliance with CCP 2033.210, 2033.220 and 2033.230 and Plaintiff’s counsel has  indicated that the failure to serve timely responses was the result of mistake,  inadvertence, or excusable neglect in believing that responses were due on  7/11/24 due to the date the discovery requests were received in the mail.  See CCP 2033.280(a); (Gerome Decl.  ¶23).   CONCLUSION   The motion is denied.      The Court notes that both Defendants’ and Plaintiff’s  counsel have failed to electronically bookmark the exhibits attached to the  motion, opposition and reply in violation of CRC 3.1110(f)(4).  Counsel for the parties are warned that  failure to comply with this rule in the future may result in matters being  continued so that papers can be resubmitted in compliance, papers not being  considered and/or the imposition of sanctions.   Additionally, with regard to the issue of electronic  service of documents in this case, counsel for the parties are advised to  review CCP 1010.6(b) and CRC 2.251(c)(3), (4).
