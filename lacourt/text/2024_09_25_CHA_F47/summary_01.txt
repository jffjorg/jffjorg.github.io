And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion for an order waiving the plaintiff's objections to the Requests for Admissions and for sanctions. The motion was filed by the defendants, Joy Weber and Weber Training Stables, seeking an order that all objections posed by the plaintiff in his response to the Requests for Admissions be waived, and for sanctions against the plaintiff in the amount of $3,500.00.

The judge found that the motion fails for several reasons. First, the defendants failed to give clear notice of the relief requested. Second, the motion is based on CCP 2033.280, which provides for relief only if the party to whom the requests for admission are directed has failed to serve a timely response, and the party has subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance with the statute. The plaintiff had previously served responses to the Requests for Admissions, and the defendants were required to meet and confer with the plaintiff regarding the responses, or to file a motion to compel further responses.

The judge also found that the plaintiff has made a sufficient showing that relief from waiver of objections is warranted, as the plaintiff's responses were in substantial compliance with the statute, and the failure to serve timely responses was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.

The judge warned both parties' counsel that failure to electronically bookmark exhibits in the future may result in continuances, exclusion of evidence, or imposition of sanctions.
