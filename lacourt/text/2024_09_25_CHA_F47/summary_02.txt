And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that U.S. Bank Trust National Association, solely as Trustee for RCF 2 Acquisition Trust (U.S. Bank), may intervene in the action to file a motion to expunge the notice of pendency of action recorded by the plaintiff. The motion was filed on February 5, 2024, after the plaintiff failed to respond to U.S. Bank's requests to withdraw the lis pendens. The judge found that U.S. Bank has an interest in the property, which is the subject of the lawsuit, and that the disposition of the action may impair or impede its ability to protect that interest. The judge granted the motion, ordering U.S. Bank to file a separate copy of the Complaint-in-Intervention.
