And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for sanctions against defendant Leng for failing to attend a deposition as ordered. The judge finds that Leng's failure to attend the deposition was willful and that the plaintiff's request for issue, evidentiary, and monetary sanctions is reasonable. The judge declines to impose issue or evidentiary sanctions, but awards the plaintiff $4,655 in monetary sanctions to compensate for the time and effort spent in preparing the motion and attending the hearing. The judge concludes that the sanctions are warranted and reasonable under the circumstances.
