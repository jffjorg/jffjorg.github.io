  Case Number:  20STCV30395    Hearing Date:   January 14, 2025    Dept:  74 Stoops v.
Lend et al. 
 
BACKGROUND  
            This
cases arises from a contract fraud complaint.
            Plaintiffs
Jackson Stoops and Guiding Hands Social Club filed complaint against defendants
Stephen Wei-Liang Leng (Leng), Jennifer Leng, Kristie Do, and Janet Lao.
            On
October 30, 2023, the Court ordered defendant Leng to sit for an additional 4
hours of deposition.
            Plaintiffs
filed a motion for sanctions after Leng failed to attend the noticed
deposition. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
A
motion lies to compel deposition attendance or document production, after
service of a deposition notice, where a deponent fails to appear at, or proceed
with, a deposition, without having served a valid objection under section
2025.410.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2025.450(a).)
No
meet and confer is required to compel initial deposition attendance, but
instead there must be a declaration showing that moving party inquired about
the nonappearance.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2025.450(b)(2).)
            The
court is authorized, after notice and an opportunity for hearing, to impose the
following sanctions against anyone engaging in conduct that is a misuse of the
discovery process: monetary sanctions, issue sanctions, evidence sanctions,
terminating sanctions, and contempt. 
(Code Civ. Proc., §¿2023.030, subds. (a)-(e).)  Code of Civil Procedure, section 2023.010,
subdivision (g) provide that a misuse of the discovery process includes evasive
responses to discovery.  (Code Civ. Proc.
§ 2023.010(f).)
“The
discovery statutes evince an incremental approach to discovery sanctions,
starting with monetary sanctions and ending with the ultimate sanction of
termination. [Citation.]”  (Doppes v.
Bentley Motors, Inc.¿(2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 967, 992; see J.W. v.
Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of New York, Inc.¿(2018) 29 Cal.App.5th
1142, 1169.)  If a lesser sanction fails
to curb misuse, a greater sanction is warranted.  (Doppes, supra, 174 Cal.App.4th at p.
992.)  “Discovery sanctions ‘should be
appropriate to the dereliction, and should not exceed what is required to
protect the interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery.’”  (Ibid.)  “But where a violation is willful, preceded
by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would
not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial court is justified
in imposing the ultimate sanction.”  (Id.,
quoting Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th
262, 279–280); Creed-21 v. City of Wildomar¿(2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 690,
702, quoting Doppes and Mileikowsky.)¿¿ 
The
court should consider the totality of the circumstances, including conduct of
the party to determine if the actions were willful, the detriment to the
propounding party, and the number of formal and informal attempts to obtain
discovery.  (Lang v. Hochman (2000)
77 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246.)  
Before
any sanctions may be imposed, the court must make an express finding that there
has been a willful failure of the party to serve the required discovery
responses.  (Fairfield v. Superior
Court for Los Angeles County (1966) 246 Cal.App.2d 113, 118.)  The party who failed to comply with discovery
obligations has the burden of showing that the failure was not willful.  (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84
Cal.App.3d 771, 788; Cornwall v. Santa Monica Dairy Co. (1977) 66
Cal.App.3d 250, 252-253.)   
Evidence
or issue sanctions may be imposed only after parties violated discovery orders
compelling further responses, except in exceptional circumstances, including
where there was sufficiently egregious misconduct regarding a failure to
respond to discovery, or another additional order to respond would be
futile.  (New Albertsons, Inc. v.
Superior Court (2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1426.)
 
DISCUSSION
            The
Court ordered Leng to sit for an additional four hours of deposition in October
30, 2023.  (Crites Decl., ¶ 3.)  After several failed attempts to procure
Leng’s deposition, Plaintiffs noticed on October 23, 2024, Leng’s deposition
for October 28, 2024,.  (Crites Decl., ¶ 8.)  Leng’s counsel confirmed on October 25, 2024,
that Leng would attend the deposition.  (Crites Decl., ¶ 10.) They were unable to
proceed on October 28th, so the Parties confirmed and rescheduled the
deposition for November 4, 2024.  (Crites
Decl., ¶ 11.)  Plaintiffs served an
amended notice on October 30, 2024.  Leng
did not object to the untimely notice, nor did Leng notify Plaintiff’s counsel
that he would be unable to attend. 
(Crites Decl., ¶¶ 13-16.) 
Plaintiffs inquired about Leng’s nonappearance and received no
response.  (Crites Decl., ¶ 17.)
            Defendant
opposes the Motion for Sanctions on the grounds that the notice of the
deposition was improper.  Defendant
waived the objection to improper notice by failing to serve a written objection.  (Code of Civil Procedure § 2025.410(a).)  
            Defendant
violated the order requiring additional time at deposition.  Plaintiffs request issue, evidentiary and
monetary sanctions against Defendant.  Sanctions
should be incremental, and Plaintiffs have not shown that monetary sanctions
would be unsuccessful in compelling Leng to complete his required Deposition. Therefore,
the Court declines to impose issue or evidentiary sanctions. 
            Plaintiffs
request $4,655 in monetary sanctions. 
The amount represents five hours in preparing the original motion, three
hours in preparing the reply brief and for the hearing, and a $400 hourly
rate.  The court finds this reasonable. 
 
CONCLUSION
            The
Court grants Plaintiffs’ motion for sanctions. The Court awards $4,655 to
Plaintiffs. 
            Plaintiffs to give notice.
