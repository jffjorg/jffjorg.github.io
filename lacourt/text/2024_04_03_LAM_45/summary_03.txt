And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling grants the motions of Counsel Timothy J. Kodani and Counsel William E. Gilg to be relieved as counsel of record for Plaintiff Richard G. Rubio. The court finds that the attorneys' withdrawal will not prejudice the client and will not disrupt the orderly process of justice. The court notes that the proposed orders filed with the court do not provide the time or place for the pending trial, but this can be easily remedied by submitting corrected proposed orders. The court grants the motions with the condition that Counsel Kodani and Counsel Gilg submit revised proposed orders providing all future hearing date information, including the date, time, and place.
