And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge grants the Plaintiffs' Motion to Enforce Settlement, as per the parties' settlement agreement. The Plaintiffs, Joe Maez, Hunter Maez, and Maez Restaurant Group LLC, entered into a series of contracts with the Defendants, Heriberto Camacho and Restaurant Design Studio Corp., to design and build out a commercial space for a restaurant. The Plaintiffs alleged that the Defendants breached the contracts, and on November 7, 2022, they filed a complaint asserting causes of action against the Defendants and Does 1-20. The parties settled the case on November 23, 2023, and filed a Stipulation providing the court with jurisdiction under California Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6.

The settlement agreement required the Defendants to pay the Plaintiffs $225,000.00 in 24 equal installments of $9,375.00, beginning on July 1, 2024. However, the Defendants failed to pay, and the Plaintiffs sent a notice to cure on July 2, 2024. The Defendants have not cured the default, and the motion is unopposed. The Judge finds the amount of attorneys' fees requested by the Plaintiffs ($1,777.50) reasonable and grants the motion.
