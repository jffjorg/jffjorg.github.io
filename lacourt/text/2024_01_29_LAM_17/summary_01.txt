Summary:

The tentative ruling grants the defendant's demurrer, dismissing the complaint without prejudice. The court finds that the plaintiff's action is premature, as it is based on an unconfirmed lien and unknown lien amount. The court requires the plaintiff to participate in mandatory fee arbitration to determine the quantum meruit value of fees and, if necessary, seek a judicial determination regarding the enforceability of the claimed lien amount and the reasonable value of the services rendered by the plaintiff to the client. The court cites several cases, including Mojtahedi v. Vargas, to support its ruling.
