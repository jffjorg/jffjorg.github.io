```

And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that Plaintiff's motion to strike or tax costs is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part. The Court taxes the costs for "Other" and denies the motion otherwise. The Judge finds that Defendant is the prevailing party and that the Memorandum of Costs was timely filed. The Judge also finds that Plaintiff failed to provide evidence to support its request to tax certain costs and that Defendant did not provide a substantive argument to counter Plaintiff's arguments. The Judge therefore denies Plaintiff's request to tax the costs for deposition fees, service of process fees, and investigator fees, and grants the request to tax the costs for the court reporter fees for the ex parte hearing on August 3, 2022.
