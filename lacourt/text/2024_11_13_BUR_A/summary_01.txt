And here is the summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is on the defendants' motion for summary judgment in a case involving a lease agreement between the plaintiffs, Gary Pantaleo and Kathleen Pantaleo, and the defendants, Christopher Valentine and Christian Tolen von Lahr. The defendants claimed financial hardship due to the COVID-19 pandemic and were unable to pay rent, and the plaintiffs issued a Three-Day Notice to Pay Rent or Quit. The defendants filed a motion for summary judgment, which the plaintiffs opposed. The judge denied the defendants' motion, finding that they failed to provide sufficient evidence of their financial hardship and ability to repay the rent. The judge also disagreed with the defendants' assertion that the Small Claims Court has jurisdiction over the COVID-19 related rental debt. The judge's ruling is based on California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) §116.223, which permits landlords to seek judicial redress for COVID-19 related rent, and CCP §11161, which requires the notice to pay rent or quit to accurately state the amount due. The judge's decision is final and binding unless one of the parties files a written objection by the date specified in the ruling.
