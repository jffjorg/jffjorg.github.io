 Case Number:  23STLC04872    Hearing Date:   April 15, 2024    Dept:  26    Clifford Johnson v. RAR2 – Villa Marina Center  CA SPE, et al.MOTION (CCP § 2023.010, 2023.030, & 2030.290)     TENTATIVE RULING: GRANTED Background             On August  7, 2023, Clifford Johnson filed a Complaint against several defendants, all  either owners or lessors of real property, for violation of the Unruh Civil  Rights Act. Plaintiff alleges that on May 6, 2023, Plaintiff experienced  difficulty with accessing the public accommodations the defendants allegedly  provide. (Complaint, ¶ 4-6.) The motion now before the Court is Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Defendant RAR2 – Villa  Marina Center CA SPE’s Answers to Interrogatories (the Motion). Defendant files  an opposition, no reply has been filed.    Discussion   Legal Standard             If a party  to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely response, the  propounding party may move for an order compelling responses and for a monetary  sanction. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subds. (b), (c).) Failure to timely  respond waives all objections, including privilege and work product, unless  “[t]he party has subsequently served a response that is in substantial  compliance” and “[t]he party’s failure to serve a timely response was the  result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.” (CCP § 2030.290, subds.  (a)(1), (a)(2).) The statute contains no time limit for a motion to compel  where no responses have been served and no meet and confer is required when a  party does not respond to discovery requests. All that need be shown in the  moving papers is that a set of interrogatories was properly served on the  opposing party, that the time to respond has expired, and that no response of  any kind has been served. (Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d  902, 905-906.)   Analysis             Plaintiff provides the Declaration of Morse Mehrban  (Mehrban Decl.) for the Motion. The declaration states that on December 1,  2023, Plaintiff’s counsel served Special Interrogatories (Set 1) on RAR2 – Villa Marina Center CA SPE (RAR2).  (Mehrban Decl., ¶ 3.) Although Plaintiff’s counsel followed up with an email on  January 16, 2024, well after the 30-day deadline, no responses were ever  received. (Mehrban Decl., ¶ 3.) Defense counsel for RAR2 argues that he informed Plaintiff’s counsel he was in trial.  However, the initial discovery was propounded on December 1, 2023, the instant  Motion was not filed until February 27, 2024. Defense counsel fails to explain  why no responses were served in the 3 months since the initial discovery was  propounded. Therefore, the Motions are granted, and sanctions warranted.  Plaintiff’s counsel provides the following calculations:   ·          Counsel’s hourly rate is $500 per hour ·          Counsel states that he spent 1 hour preparing  this Motion   Accordingly, the Court  will impose a monetary sanction of $500 on RAR2.   Conclusion               The Motion  to Compel RAR2 – Villa Marina Center CA SPE’s Answers to Special  Interrogatories is GRANTED. Monetary sanctions in the amount of  $500 will be imposed on RAR2 – Villa Marina Center CA SPE, Inc. and counsel jointly and severally and be awarded  to Plaintiff. Both the response and the monetary sanctions are to be received  by Plaintiff within 30 days of this order.        Moving party to give notice.
