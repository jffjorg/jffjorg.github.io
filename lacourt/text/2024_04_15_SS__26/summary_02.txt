And here is the English summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The Court has reviewed the Defendant's Motion to Set Aside the Default Judgment, which was filed due to the Defendant's lack of appearance in the case. The Court has found that the default judgment was properly entered due to the Defendant's lack of appearance and that the Defendant's contention that they never received the Summons and Complaint is not supported by sufficient evidence. The Court has considered the proof of service and the Declaration of Mailing, which show that the Summons and Complaint were properly served on the Defendant. The Court has also considered the Defendant's failure to demonstrate that their lack of actual notice in time to defend was not caused by their own inexcusable neglect. Therefore, the Court has denied the Defendant's Motion to Set Aside the Default Judgment.
