Discussion
 
Legal Standard
With respect to attorney fees and
costs, unless they are specifically provided for by statute (e.g., CCP §§ 1032,
et seq.), the measure and mode of compensation of attorneys and counselors at
law is left to the agreement,
express or implied, of the parties. (CCP § 1021.) The prevailing party on
a contract, which specifically
provides for attorney fees and costs incurred to enforce the agreement, is
entitled to reasonable attorney fees in addition to other costs. (Civ. Code
§ 1717(a); CCP §§ 1032, 1033.5(a)(10)(A).) The court, upon notice and
motion by a party, shall determine the prevailing party and shall fix, as an element of the costs
of suit, the reasonable attorney fees. (Civ. Code § 1717(a), (b).) Any
notice of motion to claim attorney fees as an element of costs under shall be
served and filed before or at the same time the memorandum of costs is served
and filed; if only attorney fees are claimed as costs, the notice of motion
shall be served and filed within the time specified in CRC 3.1700 for filing a
memorandum of costs. (CRC 3.1702; Gunlock Corp. v. Walk on Water, Inc.
(1993) 15 Cal.App.4th 1301, 1303, fn. 1.)
 
“It is well established that the
determination of what constitutes reasonable attorney fees is committed to the
discretion of the trial court, whose decision cannot be reversed in the absence
of an abuse of discretion. [Citation.]” (Melnyk
v. Robledo (1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 618, 623-624.) The fee setting inquiry in
California ordinarily “begins with the ‘lodestar’ [method], i.e., the number of
hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate.” (Graciano v. Robinson Ford Sales, Inc.
(2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 140, 154.) “[A] computation of time spent on a case and
the reasonable value of that time is fundamental to a determination of an
appropriate attorneys’ fee award.” (Margolin
v. Reg’l Planning Comm’n (1982) 134 Cal.App.3d 999, 1004.) The lodestar
figure may then be adjusted, based on consideration of factors specific to the
case, in order to fix the fee at the fair market value for the legal services
provided. (See Serrano v. Priest (1977)
20 Cal.3d 25, 49 [discussing factors relevant to proper attorneys’ fees
award].) 
 
 
Analysis
            Plaintiff contends in their
moving papers, that the contract on which they sued provided for attorney fees.
That provision is reproduced here:
 
“In the
event of any litigation arising out of or relating to this agreement, Surety
shall be entitled to recover its attorney’s fees incurred therein.”
(Complaint,
Exh. A.)
 
            On January 8, 2024, the Court granted summary judgment in
favor of Plaintiff for the principal sum requested in the Complaint of
$15,700.00 plus accrued interest in the amount of $8,372.60. Here, Plaintiff is
the prevailing party. 
 
            Next, Plaintiff provides the Declaration of Michael K.
Murray (Murray Decl.) which states that the attorney’s billing rates on this
matter ranged from $300.00-$375.00 per hour for a partner with fourteen years
of experience and $275.00-$325.00 per hour for an associate with seven year of
experience. (Murray Decl., ¶ 12.) Considering the nature of the case, the
questions involved, and the skill required, this appears to be fair market
value for legal services. (See Melnyk, supra, at 623-624 and Serrano,
supra, at 49.) The total fees for the matter amount to $5,294.80. Plaintiff
additionally requests that the Court award the anticipated 5 hours of time at
$375 per hour for the instant Motion, including any opposition and reply that
need be drafted. However, no opposition nor reply was filed here. Therefore,
considering that only the moving papers were filed, the Court will award $375
in addition to the requested amount. 
 
Conclusion
            Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s Motion to be Deemed Prevailing Party for an Award for Attorney’s
Fees is GRANTED. Plaintiff is deemed the prevailing party and
Attorney’s Fees are awarded in the amount of $5,669.80.
