Here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

This tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motion to compel the defendant's answers to special interrogatories and imposes a monetary sanction of $500 on the defendant. The plaintiff, Clifford Johnson, filed a complaint against several defendants, including RAR2 – Villa Marina Center CA SPE, for violating the Unruh Civil Rights Act. The plaintiff alleges that he experienced difficulty accessing public accommodations provided by the defendants. The defendant failed to respond to the plaintiff's special interrogatories, despite being served with the request in December 2023. The court finds that the defendant's failure to respond waives all objections, including privilege and work product. The court grants the motion to compel and imposes a monetary sanction of $500 on the defendant and its counsel.
