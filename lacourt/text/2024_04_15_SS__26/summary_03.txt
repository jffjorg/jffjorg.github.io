And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the defendants' motion for leave to conduct additional discovery. The defendants have demonstrated that they will be unable to effectively defend themselves without additional discovery. The plaintiff filed a complaint containing nine causes of action, including claims of illegal holding of a security deposit, retaliation, breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, and promissory estoppel. The court finds that the defendants have conducted discovery in good faith and have attempted to secure additional discovery by stipulation, but to no avail. The court grants the motion and allows the defendants to conduct additional discovery in order to properly defend themselves.
