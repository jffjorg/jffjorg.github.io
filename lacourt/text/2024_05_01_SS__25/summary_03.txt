Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants in part the plaintiff's motion to vacate the dismissal and to enforce a settlement agreement and enter judgment. The court finds that the parties entered into a valid and binding agreement, and that the defendant failed to make payments as agreed. The court orders judgment entered for the plaintiff and against the defendant in the amount of $7,321.94, which represents the settlement amount minus payments collectively received from the defendant and the defendant's insurance carrier, plus interest in the sum of $1,281.40. The court also denies the plaintiff's request for court costs and attorney's fees.
