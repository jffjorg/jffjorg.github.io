   [1] The  Court notes that Defendant Shokrian is not a cross-complainant; however, the  fifth affirmative defense in the joint answer of Defendants references and  incorporates the Cross-Complaint filed by Defendant Benbaroukh.    [2] The  Court notes that counsel’s declaration only specifically references Defendant  Benbaroukh; however, Exhibit A attached to counsel’s declaration shows that a  deposition notice with a request for production of documents was also propounded  on Defendant Shokrian. Based on a review of the declarations in support of the  Motions, Plaintiff is using the same declaration in support of both motions.
