OPPOSING PARTY


Plaintiff Milan Cvejic



 
BACKGROUND
 
On March 18, 2019, Plaintiffs Milan
Cvejic (“Plaintiff”) and Kareem Akhtar filed the instant action against
Defendants Skyview Capital, LLC, Newnet Communications Technologies, LLC,
Newnet Investment Group, Alex Soltani, and Christopher Aye (“Defendants”). The
Complaint asserts causes of action for (1) breach of contract; (2) breach of
the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; (3) willful failure to pay
wages; (4) quantum meruit; (5) promissory estoppel; (6) conversion; (7)
intentional misrepresentation; (8) violation of Labor Code section 970; (9)
wrongful termination in violation of public policy; (10) unlawful business
practices; (11) failure to reimburse; (12) breach of fiduciary duty; (13)
unjust enrichment; and (14) declaratory relief. 
 
On December 5, 2019, the Court
granted Defendants’ motion to compel arbitration and stayed the proceedings
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.4.  Arbitration fees were due by June 4, 2021.  On July 9, 2021, Defendants had still not
paid the arbitration fee.
 
Plaintiff moved to withdraw the
matter from arbitration, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.98,
which the Court granted on February 14, 2022. 
(See Feb. 14, 2022 Minute Order.) 
Defendants appealed the order, and the Court of Appeal affirmed the
order on June 28, 2023.  
 
Plaintiff filed a memorandum of
costs seeking only the $154,830.00 in attorneys’ fees Plaintiff incurred in
connection with litigating the appeal pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
sections 1281.98, subdivision (c) and 1281.99, subdivision (a)(1).  Plaintiff separately filed a motion for
attorneys’ fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 1281.98 and
1281.99, which includes the $154,830.00 incurred in connection with the
appeal.  On December 1, 2023, the Court
granted Plaintiff’s motion and awarded Plaintiff attorneys’ fees and costs,
including the $154,830 sought in connection with the appeal.  (See December 1, 2023 Minute Order.)
 
Defendants move to tax Plaintiff’s
costs in their entirety.  Plaintiff
opposes the motion and Defendants reply.
 
LEGAL STANDARDS
 
Code of Civil
Procedure section 1281.98 provides, in relevant portion:
 
(a)(1) In
an employment or consumer arbitration that requires, either expressly or
through application of state or federal law or the rules of the arbitration
provider, that the drafting party pay certain fees and costs during the
pendency of an arbitration proceeding, if the fees or costs required to
continue the arbitration proceeding are not paid within 30 days after the due
date, the drafting party is in material breach of the arbitration agreement, is
in default of the arbitration, and waives its right to compel the employee or
consumer to proceed with that arbitration as a result of the material breach.
 
[…]
 
(b) If the drafting party materially breaches the
arbitration agreement and is in default under subdivision (a), the employee or
consumer may unilaterally elect to do any of the following:  (1) Withdraw the claim from
arbitration and proceed in a court of appropriate jurisdiction. 
 
[…]
 
(c) If the employee or consumer withdraws the claim from
arbitration and proceeds in a court of appropriate jurisdiction pursuant to
paragraph (1) of subdivision (b), both of the following apply:  (1) The employee or consumer may
bring a motion, or a separate action, to recover all attorney's fees and all
costs associated with the abandoned arbitration proceeding. The recovery of
arbitration fees, interest, and related attorney's fees shall be without regard
to any findings on the merits in the underlying action or arbitration.  (2) The court shall impose
sanctions on the drafting party in accordance with Section 1281.99.
 
Section 1281.99
provides:
 
(a)  
The
court shall impose a monetary sanction against a drafting party that materially
breaches an arbitration agreement pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section
1281.97 or subdivision (a) of Section 1281.98, by ordering the
drafting party to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees and
costs, incurred by the employee or consumer as a result of the material breach.
 
(b)  
In
addition to the monetary sanction described in subdivision (a), the court may
order any of the following sanctions against a drafting party that materially
breaches an arbitration agreement pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section
1281.97 or subdivision (a) of Section 1281.98, unless the court finds
that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or
that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.
 
(1)  
An
evidence sanction by an order prohibiting the drafting party from conducting
discovery in the civil action.
 
(2)  
A
terminating sanction by one of the following orders:
 
(A) An order striking out the pleadings or
parts of the pleadings of the drafting party.
(B) An order rendering a judgment by
default against the drafting party.
 
(3) A contempt sanction by an order
treating the drafting party as in contempt of court.
 
DISCUSSION
 
            As
explained on the memorandum of costs form, attorney’ fees are only
appropriately entered as an entry on the memorandum of costs “if contractual or
statutory fees are fixed without necessity of a court determination; otherwise
a noticed motion is required[.]”  Here,
the amount of attorneys’ fees is not fixed by statute or contract without need
for a court determination.  In fact,
Plaintiff has filed a separate motion for attorneys’ fees, where the parties
briefed the issues, and the Court heard argument before ultimately granting the
motion on December 1 (but denying the requested lodestar multiplier).  
 
CONCLUSION AND
ORDER
 
Therefore, the Court grants
Defendants’ motion and taxes the requested $154,830.00 from the memorandum of
costs, as the issue is moot, having already been decided in the Court’s
December 1, 2023 Minute Order.  
 
Defendants shall provide notice of
the Court’s ruling and file a proof of service regarding the same.
