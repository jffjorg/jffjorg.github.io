**Summary**

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motion to strike the defendants' demurrer to the third amended complaint. The plaintiff alleges that the defendants induced her to invest in a third-party company, BuChew, LLC, by falsely claiming that Wayne Gretzky lost weight from using the company's product.
