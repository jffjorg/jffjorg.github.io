The Court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to tax the costs of Plaintiff Milan Cvejic, who had filed a lawsuit against Defendants Skyview Capital, LLC, NewNet Communication Technologies, LLC, NewNet Investment Group, LLC, Alex Soltani, and Christopher Aye. The motion was filed after the Court had previously granted Plaintiff's motion to withdraw from arbitration and awarded Plaintiff attorneys' fees and costs. The Court has determined that the issue of taxation of costs is moot, as it has already been decided in its previous ruling. Therefore, the Court grants the motion and taxes the requested $154,830.00 from the memorandum of costs.
