Electric Bikes, alleging causes of action for: (1) breach of written contract;
(2) common count: reasonable value of services rendered [quantum meruit]; (3)
common count: open book account; and (4) common count: account stated. 
 
            On June 30,
2023, Defendant filed and served its Answer. 
 
            On October
18, 2023, the Court granted Defendant’s counsel’s motion to be relieved.  Defendant has not retained new counsel.
            
ANALYSIS
 
CCP § 436(a) allows a court to “[s]trike
out any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading. CCP § 436(b)
allows a court to “[s]trike out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or
filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of
the court.” “The grounds for a motion to strike shall appear on the face of the
challenged pleading or from any matter of which the court is required to take
judicial notice.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437, subd. (a).) 
 
“[A] corporation, unlike a natural
person, cannot represent itself before courts of record in propria persona, nor
can it represent itself through a corporate officer, director or other employee
who is not an attorney. It must be represented by licensed counsel in
proceedings before courts of record.” (CLD Construction, Inc. v. City of San
Ramon (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 1141, 1145.) Code of Civil Procedure “Section
585 authorizes a court to enter default against a defendant that does not
answer a complaint.” (Schwab v. Rondel Homes, Inc. (1991) 53 Cal.3d 428,
431.) 
 
Counsel for Defendant was relieved several
months ago; Defendant has not retained new counsel, has not appeared in Court and
has not shown any intent to defend this lawsuit. 
 
The motion is GRANTED.
