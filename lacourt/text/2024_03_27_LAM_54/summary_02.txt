**Significant Statements**

significant_statements:
  - "A special motion to strike under section 425.16—the so-called anti-SLAPP statute—allows a defendant to seek early dismissal of a lawsuit that qualifies as a SLAPP."
  - "The anti-SLAPP statute is designed to protect ‘(1) any written or oral statement or writing made before a legislative, executive, or judicial proceeding, or any other official proceeding authorized by law, (2) any written or oral statement or writing made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a legislative, executive, or judicial body, or any other official proceeding authorized by law, (3) any written or oral statement or writing made in a place open to the public or a public forum in connection with an issue of public interest, or (4) any other conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of petition or the constitutional right of free speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest.’"
```

**Summary of the Tentative Ruling**
```
The Court denies Cross-Defendant's special motion to strike the first, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth causes of action. The Court finds that the challenged causes of action do not arise from protected activity and that Cross-Defendant has not met his burden in showing that the challenged causes of action arise from protected activity.
