BACKGROUND
 
            This action
arises from the alleged fraudulent transfer of real property located at 10803
Alta View Drive, Studio City, CA 91604. On November 30, 2022, Plaintiff Julie
Strassman, individually and as Successor in Interest on behalf of the Decedent
Harvey Strassman, sued Defendants Clara Mendoza, Jaime Mendoza, and Jennifer
Mendoza, alleging causes of action for: (1) financial elder abuse with intent
to defraud; (2) financial elder abuse by undue influence; (3) financial elder
abuse; (4) elder abuse—isolation and neglect; (5) presumptive fraud; (6)
conversion; (7) tortious interference with inheritance; (8) quiet title; (9)
cancellation of deed; (10) accounting; (11) claim of ownership; and (12)
rescission.   
 
            Plaintiff seeks
to continue the trial to a date on or after October 7, 2024, “due to a painful
medical condition requiring surgery and a lengthy period of recovery during
which [Plaintiff’s] faculties are likely to be compromised due to the surgery
and necessity of use of pain medication.” Plaintiff’s declaration is
corroborated by a declaration from her surgeon. The motion is unopposed.
 
The motion is GRANTED. The Court continues jury trial to
November 18, 2024 at 9:30. The final status conference will be November 8, 2024
at 9:30. All trial-related dates, including discovery cut-off and motion
cut-off dates, are based on the new trial date.
