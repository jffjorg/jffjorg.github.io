And here is the summary in English text:

This tentative ruling is for a hearing on March 27, 2024, in the Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles, Department 54. The case is 23STCV13576, Marion Martinez vs. West Hills Hospital, et al. The defendants, West Hills Hospital, et al., have filed a demurrer to the sixth cause of action for defamation in the plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint.

The plaintiff, Marion Martinez, alleges that the defendants made defamatory statements about him after he was terminated from West Hills Hospital. The plaintiff claims that the defendants violated labor codes and defamed him, causing him harm to his personal, business, and professional reputation.

The court has considered the moving papers, opposition, and reply and has ruled that the demurrer to the sixth cause of action for defamation is sustained without leave to amend. The plaintiff's concessions that he does not know who made the alleged defamatory statements, when, or how they were communicated show that he cannot successfully amend this cause of action.

The court has cited various laws and cases, including Labor Code sections 1102.5, 6310, and 6311, Health and Safety Code section 1278.5, Civil Code section 47c, and Code of Civil Procedure section 430.50(a).
