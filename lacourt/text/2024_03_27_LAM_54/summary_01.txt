The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to continue the trial, which was unopposed. The trial will now be held on November 18, 2024, and the final status conference will be on November 8, 2024. The motion to continue the trial was made due to the plaintiff's painful medical condition, which requires surgery and a lengthy period of recovery. The plaintiff's declaration was corroborated by a declaration from her surgeon. The Court has also continued all trial-related dates, including discovery cut-off and motion cut-off dates, to the new trial date.
