And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling on a motion to compel compliance with a deposition subpoena filed by Defendant Golden Bear Insurance Company. The motion was filed to compel non-party Alliant Insurance Services, Inc. to produce business records. However, the proof of service for the motion does not indicate that Alliant was served with the moving papers, and therefore did not have proper notice of the motion. As a result, the motion is continued to April 24, 2024 at 9:00 am to allow Defendant to serve the moving papers on Alliant and to give Alliant an opportunity to respond. The Court also notes that the parties should submit on the tentative if they wish, by emailing the courtroom before 8:00 am on the day of the hearing.
