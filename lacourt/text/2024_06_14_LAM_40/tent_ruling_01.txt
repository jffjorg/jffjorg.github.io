 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
Demurrer of
  Defendant Canton Food Co., Inc. [Res ID # 7660].



 
I. Background
Plaintiff Clean
Products Advocates LLC (CPAL) sues Defendants Canton Food Co., Inc. (CFC), and
Does 1 through 100 pursuant to a November 14, 2023, Complaint alleging a single
claim of Violation of Proposition 65 against all Defendants.
On February 13, 2024,
CFC filed a demurrer to the Complaint’s sole claim.
On May 31, 2024, CPAL
filed an opposition, and on June 3, 2024, CFC filed a reply.
CFC’s demurrer is now
before the Court.
 
II. Demurrer
A.
Requests for Judicial Notice
Per
CFC’s request, the Court takes judicial notice of the 60-day notice on which
the first cause of action is alleged as relates to the product Octomari, in
part because Plaintiff has not objected to this request and has argued the sufficient
of the certificate of merit allegations. Moreover, the Court can properly take
judicial notice of documents extensively referenced in pleadings. (Ingram v.
Flippo (1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 1280, 1285, fn. 3 [judicial notice of
documents referred to extensively in complaint is appropriate on demurrer];
accord Align Technology, Inc. v. Tran (2009) 179 Cal.App.4th 949, 956,
fn. 6.) Last, judicial notice may be taken as to the existence of a document
and the legal effects deriving therefrom. (Julian Volunteer Fire Co. Assn.
v. Julian-Cuyamaca Fire Protection Dist. (2021) 62 Cal.App.5th 583, 600.)
Per
CPAL’s request, the Court takes judicial notice of the Complaint in this
action. (Evid. Code, §§ 452, subd. (d), 453, subds. (a)-(b).)
B.
Demurrer Legal Standard
A
demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action.
(Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747; see Code Civ. Proc., §
430.10, subd. (e).)
To
sufficiently allege a cause of action, a complaint must allege all the ultimate
facts—that is, the facts needed to establish each element of the cause of
action pleaded. (Committee on Children’s Television, Inc. v. General Foods
Corp. (1983) 35 Cal.3d 197, 212, superseded by statute as stated in Branick
v. Downey Savings & Loan Assn. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 235, 242.) “[E]ach
evidentiary fact that might eventually form part of the plaintiff’s proof need
not be alleged.” (C.A. v. William S. Hart Union High School Dist. (2012)
53 Cal.4th 861, 872.)
In
testing the sufficiency of the cause of action, the demurrer admits the truth
of all material facts properly pleaded. (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist.
(1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 966-67.) Courts read the allegations liberally and in
context. (Taylor v. City of Los Angeles Dept. of Water and Power (2006)
144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228, disapproved on other grounds, Jones v. Lodge at
Torrey Pines Partnership (2008) 42 Cal.4th 1158, 1162.) A demurrer,
however, “does not admit contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or
law.” (Daar v. Yellow Cab Co. (1967) 67 Cal.2d 695, 713.) 
C.
Demurrer Analysis
1. Demurrer, Complaint, First
Cause of Action: SUSTAINED, with
leave to amend.
a. Relevant
Law
Proposition 65 is a “right to know”
statute requiring companies that expose consumers to carcinogens or
reproductive toxins to provide a reasonable and clear warning. (Health &
Saf. Code, § 25249.6.) It is a remedial law designed to protect the public
whose provisions are construed broadly to accomplish that protective purpose. (People
ex rel. Lungren v. Superior Court (1996) 14 Cal.4th 294, 314.)
Proposition 65 provides for citizen
enforcement if the enumerated public prosecutors do not initiate diligent
prosecution within 60 days of service of notice of purported violations to the
alleged violator and the public attorneys. (Health & Saf. Code, § 25249.7,
subd. (d)(1).) 
Where the notice alleges failure to
warn of exposure to chemicals known to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity,
the notice must include a certificate of merit stating that the private
enforcer “has consulted with one or more persons with relevant and appropriate
experience or expertise who has reviewed facts, studies, or other data
regarding the exposure to the listed chemical ..., and that, based on that
information, the [certifier] believes there is a reasonable and meritorious
case for the private action.” (Health & Saf. Code, § 25249.7, subd. (d)(1).)
Successful enforcement actions can
result in the assessment of serious civil penalties, up to $2,500 per day for
each violation. (Health & Saf. Code, § 25249.7, subd. (b)(1).)
A conclusive failure to provide a
compliant, 60-day notice with a certificate of merit entitles a trial court to
sustain a demurrer for failure to exhaust Prop 65’s administrative remedies. (See
Physicians Comm. for Responsible Med. v. Applebee’s Int’l, Inc. (2014)
224 Cal.App.4th 166, 180-181, 183 [Affirming trial court sustained demurrer for
failure to comply with certificate of merit requirements where trial court
relied on plaintiff’s counsel’s statements on oral argument to the effect that
the statutorily required investigation prior to filing the 60-day notice was
never conducted].)
b. Court’s
Determination
The Court finds in favor of CPAL.
The Complaint’s claim arises in
relation to CFC’s alleged failure to warn consumers of the content of cadmium
in what appear to be nine products sold and/or distributed by CFC. (See, e.g.,
Complaint, ¶ 1 [nine products listed and separated by colons]; contra. Opp’n,
p. 3 [arguing there are twelve products alleged in ¶ 1].)
The Complaint alleges that “[m]ore
than sixty days prior to the filing of this lawsuit naming each Defendant,
Plaintiff issued 60-Day Notices Of Violation (‘Notices’) as required by and in
compliance with Proposition 65. Plaintiff provided said Notices to the various
required public enforcement agencies along with Certificates Of Merit. The
Notices alleged that Defendants violated Proposition 65 by failing to
sufficiently warn consumers in California of the health hazards associated with
exposure to LEAD and/or CADMIUM contained in their Products.” (Complaint, ¶ 13.)
This allegation, however, does not allege
that CPAL “has consulted with one or more persons with relevant and appropriate
experience or expertise who has reviewed facts, studies, or other data
regarding the exposure to the listed chemical ..., and that, based on that
information, the [certifier] believes there is a reasonable and meritorious
case for the private action.” (Health & Saf. Code, § 25249.7, subd. (d)(1);
see Demurrer, p. 6 [citing this standard]; but see Demurrer, p. 8 [substantive
argument centering on lack of allegations re: visiting store to confirm no
notices were provided or that no notice was provided generally].) This
allegation is required where the Complaint alleges a violation of Health and
Safety Code section 29249.6. (Health & Saf. Code, § 25249.7, subd. (d)(1);
see Complaint, ¶¶ 1, 15.) Yet, CPAL only conclusorily alleges that it served
notices in conformity with Proposition 65 alone and that the notices “alleged
that Defendants violated Proposition 65 by failing to sufficiently warn
consumers in California of the health hazards associated with exposure to LEAD
and/or CADMIUM contained in their Products.” (Complaint, ¶ 13.) Neither did
CPAL attach the relevant certificates of merit to the Complaint as to show
statutory compliance with section 25249.7, subdivision (d)(1), in relation to
the nine or twelve products stated in paragraph 1 of the Complaint.
Under these circumstances, the
Complaint is insufficiently alleged as to the certificates of merit supporting
this private action. CFC’s demurrer is SUSTAINED on these grounds, with leave
to amend as to cure this defect, e.g., through updated pleadings sufficiently
alleging the required information through ultimate facts or attachment of the
certificates.
In reaching its ruling, the Court
does not rely on the certificate of merit attached to the demurrer’s request
for judicial notice. As correctly noted by the opposition, only one certificate
of merit is attached in connection to product Octomari, which is only one of
the nine or twelve products stated in paragraph 1 of the Complaint. Arguendo,
reliance on that certificate would only allow for an order relating to the
sufficiency of the Octomari component of the first cause of action and not the
sufficiency of the allegations as to the other products, which would result in an
order that is inappropriate on demurrer. (Kong v.
City of Hawaiian Gardens Redevelopment Agency (2002) 108 Cal.App.4th 1028,
1047 [“A demurrer cannot rightfully be sustained to part of a cause of
action or to a particular type of damage or remedy”].) 
III. Conclusion
Demurrer of Defendant Canton Food Co., Inc. [Res ID # 7660] is SUSTAINED,
with leave to amend.
