And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Canton Food Co., Inc. The demurrer was filed in response to the complaint filed by Clean Products Advocates LLC, alleging a violation of Proposition 65. The judge has sustained the demurrer, finding that the complaint is insufficiently pleaded with regard to the certificates of merit supporting the private action. The judge has granted leave to amend the complaint to cure this defect. The ruling does not rely on the certificate of merit attached to the demurrer's request for judicial notice, as it only relates to one of the nine or twelve products stated in the complaint.
