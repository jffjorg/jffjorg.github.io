And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge grants the Defendant's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings. The Plaintiff, Adriel Garcia, alleges that the Defendant, First Iemelif Church in Duarte, knew or should have known about the sexual abuse committed by a Pastor at the Church. However, the Complaint lacks sufficient facts to establish a duty of care between the Church and the Plaintiff. Additionally, the Complaint fails to establish a breach of that duty. The Judge finds that the Plaintiff has not alleged sufficient facts to establish a special relationship between the Church and the Plaintiff, and that the Church did not have a duty to protect the Plaintiff. The Judge grants the Defendant's motion and gives the Plaintiff 20 days to amend the Complaint.
