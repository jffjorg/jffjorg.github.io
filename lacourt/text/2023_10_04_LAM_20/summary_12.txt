And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case brought by Praxedes E. Running and the Praxedes E. Running Trust against various defendants, including Covina Irrigating Company, City of Azusa, and others. The dispute centers on the alleged diversion of water from an open canal on the Plaintiffs' property. The San Gabriel River Water Committee (SGRWC) has argued that the Plaintiffs lacked the capacity to file the lawsuit and that the representative who filed the suit, Patricia Beecham, did not have the authority to do so. The Judge has rejected this argument, finding it lacks merit. The Judge has ordered the defendants to notify counsel and encouraged counsel to submit on the tentative ruling or appear by LACourtConnect due to the COVID-19 pandemic, rather than in person.
