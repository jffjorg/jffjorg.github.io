## English Text Summary

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a water diversion case.  Plaintiffs Praxedes E. Running and the Praxedes E. Running Trust sued several defendants, including the San Gabriel River Water Committee (SGRWC), alleging that defendants diverted water from an open canal on their property.

SGRWC argues that the lawsuit should be dismissed because the plaintiffs lacked the capacity to file it. The judge rejects this argument, stating it has been previously addressed and lacks merit.

The judge encourages attorneys to submit on the tentative ruling virtually through LACourtConnect rather than appearing in person due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
