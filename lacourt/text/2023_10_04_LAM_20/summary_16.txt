## English Summary

The judge has reviewed a demurrer filed by Defendant Giesel L. Richmond against several claims made by Plaintiff Chauncey Richmond in a lawsuit concerning real property ownership. The judge has overruled the demurrer, finding that Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged the necessary facts for each claim.  

The dispute centers around the transfer of ownership of the property from Plaintiff to Defendant. Plaintiff alleges that he was mentally incapacitated and tricked into transferring his ownership, while Defendant argues the transfer was valid.  

The judge found that Plaintiff's allegations regarding fraud, conspiracy, and abuse of a disabled person are sufficient to proceed with the case. Defendant's arguments regarding statute of limitations, lack of specificity in certain claims, and the legal standing of the "abuse of disabled person" claim were rejected by the judge. 

Defendant is now required to file an answer to the complaint within 20 days.

And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Court will overrule the Demurrer as to the first and second causes of action, which allege breach of fiduciary duty and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The Court finds that Plaintiff's allegations of mental incapacitation and lack of knowledge of the property transfer are sufficient to establish delayed discovery and bar the statute of limitations.

The Court will overrule the Demurrer as to the eighth, tenth, thirteenth, and fourteenth causes of action, which allege conspiracy, conversion, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and abuse of disabled person. The Court finds that these claims are also sufficiently pled and that Defendant's arguments that they are deficient are unfounded.

The Court will not sustain the Demurrer without leave to amend if the plaintiff shows there is a reasonable possibility any defect identified by the defendant can be cured by amendment. An answer is to be filed within 20 days.

English summary:
On June 28, 2023, Chauncey Richmond filed a Second Amended Complaint against Giesel L. Richmond, alleging multiple causes of action related to the unlawful sale, assignment, and/or transfer of Chauncey's ownership and security interest in a real property's Deed of Trust to Giesel. The dispute arises from Chauncey claiming that he was tricked and taken advantage of by Giesel. Chauncey had a debilitating mental condition/intoxication from medication and had no idea about the transfer, which continued until April 2017. Giesel demurred to the first through tenth, thirteenth, and fourteenth causes of action, but the court overruled the demurrer for most causes of action, as the allegations were sufficient. The court held that specificity requirements are somewhat relaxed for a concealment claim and that overt and independently tortious conduct in furtherance of the conspiracy need not be alleged. General allegations of agreement have been held sufficient. Chauncey alleges that while he was mentally incapacitated, Giesel concealed the nature of the quitclaim deed and coerced him to sign it to his detriment for no consideration. Giesel's argument about California Civil Code § 1185 was rejected, as the eighth cause of action is not alleged against her. The argument about the conversion claim was also rejected, as it merely raises a factual dispute. The court believes that the necessary facts have been alleged for the IIED claim, and the claim for “abuse of disabled person” is a valid cause of action under Welf. & Inst. Code § 15600, et.
