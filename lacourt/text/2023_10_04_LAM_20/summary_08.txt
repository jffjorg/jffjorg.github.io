## English Summary

The judge is reviewing a demurrer filed by defendant Chun Ling Shum to the plaintiff's complaint. The plaintiff, PMW Consulting, LLC, alleges that Shum and another defendant fraudulently obtained a property at a foreclosure sale.

The judge finds that Shum's argument that the complaint lacks sufficient allegations of fraud has merit, as the complaint doesn't actually allege fraud as a cause of action. The judge also finds that Shum's argument that the plaintiff lacks standing to bring a claim under Civ. Code § 2924m is also valid.  The judge states that there is no private right of action under this section based on legislative history.

The judge overrules Shum's other arguments, finding that the plaintiff has adequately stated claims for intentional and negligent interference with prospective economic advantage. The judge also finds that the plaintiff has sufficiently alleged a claim for cancellation of instruments and quiet title.  

However, the judge sustains the demurrer to the plaintiff's declaratory relief claim, finding it relates to a past controversy. The plaintiff is denied leave to amend the complaint as to the first and sixth causes of action.
