And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Farnaz Khavari against Asset Commercial Lending LLC and Carol Baker Real Estate Inc. The case is about a dispute over a real estate purchase agreement and the arbitrator's award. The judge has denied the petition to vacate the arbitration award and granted the petition to confirm the arbitration award.

The arbitrator awarded Asset Commercial Lending LLC sole liability for the breach of the real estate purchase agreement and ordered the release of a $150,000 deposit as liquidated damages, as well as $50,000 in reasonable attorney fees to the petitioner. The respondent's opposition and petition to vacate the award argue that the arbitrator made an error of law in his decision.

However, the judge has ruled that the arbitrator's decision cannot be reviewed for errors of fact or law, citing the California Supreme Court case of Moncharsh v. Heily & Blase. The judge has also noted that the parties have agreed to bear the risk of an arbitrator's mistake in return for a quick, inexpensive, and conclusive resolution to their dispute.

The judge has ordered the petitioner to submit a proposed judgment in conformity with the arbitration award within five days and has scheduled a non-appearance case review for September 17, 2024.
