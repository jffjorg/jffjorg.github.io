And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the proposed settlement between Isaias Cervantes and the County of Los Angeles and has denied the amended petition to approve the compromise without prejudice. The court found that the petition did not include a proposed order approving the settlement, and the settlement agreement does not specify the amount of the claimant's own settlement. The court also found that the allocation of the settlement funds and the calculation of the balance of proceeds for the claimant were incorrect. Additionally, the court found that the reasonableness of attorney fees was not adequately supported and that the court would not approve attorney fees greater than 25%. Finally, the court noted that the establishment of a special needs trust requires approval by the Probate Department, which had not been obtained. The court ordered the parties to file any future amended petitions with a reserved hearing date and to notify the court of their intention to submit on the tentative ruling.
