  CASE NO.: 23STCV25490
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO BE RELIEVED
  AS COUNSEL
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
September 10, 2024



 
Peter
W. Ross, Charles Avrith, and Eric C. Lauritsen, counsel of record for Plaintiff
Digital Brands Group Inc., seek to be relieved as counsel.  Counsel’s declaration states that Plaintiff consents
to withdrawal, but it has not engaged substitute counsel.  No party opposed the motion.
Absent
a showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney’s request for withdrawal should be
granted.  (People v. Prince (1968)
268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406.)  Counsel’s motion
complies with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362.  Trial is not until April 14, 2025, and there is
no prejudice to Plaintiff.
The
proposed order no longer reflects the correct next hearing date.  Before signing the order, the Court will correct
this information.
The
unopposed motion to be relieved is GRANTED and effective upon filing a proof of
service showing service of the signed Form MC-053 order and this order on Digital
Brands Group Inc. and all parties who have appeared.
However,
“a corporation cannot represent itself in a court of record either in propria persona
or through an officer or agent who is not an attorney.”  (Caressa Camille, Inc. v. Alcoholic Beverage
Control Appeals Bd. (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 1094, 1101.)  Therefore, an Order to Show Cause Re: Failure
to Retain New Counsel for Digital Brands Group Inc. is scheduled for November 14,
2024 at 8:30 a.m. in Department 48 at Stanley Mosk Courthouse.
Digital
Brands Group Inc. must retain new counsel by that date or the Court may dismiss
its Complaint.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
