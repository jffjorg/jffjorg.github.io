And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied a motion by the defendant, Christina Hayek, to compel the production of communications between the plaintiff, Cameron Kaminski, and his parents. The defendant argued that these communications were relevant to enforcing the judgment against the plaintiff, as his parents may have been involved in controlling the litigation and should therefore be liable for the judgment. The plaintiff argued that the communications were privileged and not relevant to enforcing the judgment.

The judge ruled that the communications were not relevant to enforcing the judgment, as the judgment is against the plaintiff, not his parents. The judge also noted that the defendant had not shown how the plaintiff's parents could be considered alter egos or successors of the plaintiff.

The judge cited several legal precedents, including California Code of Civil Procedure sections 708.110 and 708.120, which govern post-judgment examinations and the examination of third parties. The judge also cited several court cases, including Finance Holding Co. LLC v. The American Institute of Certified Tax Coaches, Inc. (2018), Highland Springs Conference & Training Center v. City of Banning (2016), and Favila v. Pasquarella (2021).

The judge concluded that the motion to compel production of communications was denied, and that the parties who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the court indicating their intention to submit.
