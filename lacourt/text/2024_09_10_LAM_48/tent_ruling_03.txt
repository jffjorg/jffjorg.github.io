  CASE NO.: 21STCV29317
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER DENYING WITHOUT PREJUDICE
  AMENDED PETITION TO APPROVE COMPROMISE OF DISPUTED CLAIM
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
September 10, 2024



 
On
August 13, 2024, counsel for Plaintiffs filed a Petition to Approve Compromise
of Disputed Claim.  On August 22, 2024,
the Court issued an order that detailed the Petitioner’s many deficiencies and
continued the hearing so an amended petition could be filed no later than
September 3, 2024.
Plaintiffs
did not timely file an amended petition. 
Plaintiffs did file a late amended petition on September 5, 2024.  The amended petition does not include a
proposed order approving the petition. 
The amended petition also remains deficient for many of the same reasons
as the original petition.
Claimant
Isaias Cervantes, a person with disabilities, by and through his parent, guardian
ad litem, and conservator Rosa Padilla, has agreed to settle his claims against
Defendant County of Los Angeles in exchange for $25 million.  Of this amount, $105,573.75 is allocated for a
Medi-Cal lien, $9.25 million is allocated for attorney fees, and $228,601.70 is
allocated for costs and expenses, leaving a balance of $15,415,824.55 for Claimant.  (This is not the same as the $14,855,824.60 balance
calculated in Item 15 of the Petition.)  If
approved, a portion of the funds will be paid to the guardian or conservator of
the estate and a portion of the funds will be transferred to the trustee of a special
needs trust.
Court
approval is required for all settlements of the claims of people with disabilities.  (Probate Code §§ 3500, 3600, et seq.; Code
Civ. Proc., § 372.)  The Court has reviewed
the proposed settlement and cannot approve it at this time.
Items
14 and 15 do not correctly state the balance of proceeds for the Claimant.
Item
11(b)(5) states that Plaintiff Rosa Padilla will receive $500,000 and Plaintiff
Yajaira Cervantes will receive $60,000.  Item
11(b)(1) states that the total amount offered by all defendants to others is “$0.”  The settlement agreement states that Defendant
will pay $25 million “in full and final settlement of any and all claims by the
Plaintiffs against the Defendants.”  It therefore
appears that Plaintiff Rosa Padilla and Plaintiff Yajaira Cervantes will receive
a portion of the $25 million settlement, and $25 million is not the amount of Claimant’s
own settlement for approval.  (See Item 10(a).)  Counsel’s declaration clarifies that $25 million
is the gross settlement amount, to be divided (after costs) as $14,855,824.60 to
Isaias Cervantes; $500,000.00 to Rosa Padilla; and $60,000.00 to Yajaira Cervantes.  (Dove Decl. ¶ 48.)  This is not what the Petition states in Items
10 and 11.  Additionally, the settlement agreement
is not signed by a representative of Defendant.
Counsel’s
declaration in support of the reasonableness of attorney fees does not adequately
support the request for $9.25 million (37%) in attorney fees.  Although Claimant’s parent, guardian ad litem,
and conservator contracted with counsel for attorney fees of 40-percent of settlement
recovery, $9.25 million is excessive in this case.  Counsel Dove represents, without detailed information
or records, that he spent 5,115 hours on this case, and Counsel Doyle spent 250
hours.  (Dove Decl. ¶¶ 29, 41; Doyle Decl.
¶ 9.)  Only Counsel Contreras provides sufficient
information for this Court to determine whether his 393.95 hours were reasonably
spent.  (Contreras Decl. ¶¶ 3-47.)  Counsel Dove calculates, “If this Court were to
apply a reasonable multiplier of 1.8 times a reasonable average lodestar hourly
rate of $1,000, times the 5,115 hours attorneys expended spent, the total attorneys’
fees equal $9,252,000.  If the court were
to apply a 1.75 multiplier to a $1,000 per hour rate for the 5,115 hours worked,
total attorneys’ fees are $8,995,000.  If
the court applies a 1.7 multiplier to the same $1,000/hour rate for 5,115 hours
spent on this case, attorneys’ fees amount to [$]8,695,500.”  (Dove Decl. ¶ 29.)  Both the 5,115 hours and hourly rate of $1,000
are unsupported.  At this time, the Court
will not approve attorney fees greater than twenty-five percent.
A
portion of Claimant’s funds will be transferred to a special needs trust.  When a settlement proposes the establishment of
a special needs or other trust as provided in Probate Code sections 3600 to 3612,
the terms of the proposed trust must be reviewed by the Probate Department.  (L.A. County Sup. Ct. Rule 4.115(c).)  A party seeking to establish and fund a trust
as part of a Petition must, within two court days of the filing of the Petition,
lodge with the filing window of the Probate Division at Stanley Mosk Courthouse
a physical copy of the face page of the Petition, a
copy of the proposed trust instrument, and the proposed order approving the compromise
and trust.  (L.A. County Sup. Ct. Rule 4.115(c).)  This procedure was not followed.
The
Petition does attach a copy of a “Petition for Substituted Judgment to Authorize
Proposed Action to Execute a Pour Over Will and Create a Living Trust and for Order
Establishing a Special Needs Trust for the Conservatee” filed in In Re The Conservatorship
of Isaias Cervantes, Case No. BP145994. 
(Attachment 18a(3)(e).)  This petition
notices a hearing date of September 25, 2024. 
Accordingly, the transfer of settlement funds to a special needs trust has
not yet been approved, and this Court cannot yet approve this settlement and distribution.
The
Amended Petition to Approve Compromise of Disputed Claim is DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.
Any
future amended petitions must reserve a hearing date.
Moving
party give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
