The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion of Digital Brands Group, Inc.'s counsel to be relieved as counsel. The motion was unopposed, and the court finds that there is no prejudice to the plaintiff. The judge also notes that a corporation cannot represent itself in court and therefore schedules an Order to Show Cause Re: Failure to Retain New Counsel for November 14, 2024, requiring Digital Brands Group, Inc. to retain new counsel by that date or risk having its complaint dismissed. The judge further notes that the proposed order will be corrected before signing.
