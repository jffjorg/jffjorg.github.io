RELIEF
REQUESTED 
 
             Defendant moves for attorney’s
fees totaling $24,395.00.
 
BACKGROUND
 
             This case arises out of Ziming He’s
(“Plaintiff”) claim that Defendant Wing Ho (“Defendant”) breached a contract
where Defendant agreed to pay Plaintiff $211,172.74 to build an accessory
dwelling unit (“ADU”). Plaintiff filed a first amended complaint (“FAC”) on
March 21, 2023 alleging one cause of action for breach of contract. 
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
            Defendant’s
motion for attorney’s fees is GRANTED for a total of $24,395.00.
 
LEGAL STANDARD
 
            “In any action on a contract, where the contract specifically provides
that attorney's fees and costs, which are incurred to enforce that
contract, shall be awarded either to one of the parties or to the prevailing
party, then the party who is determined to be the party prevailing on the contract, whether he or she is the party specified
in the contract or not, shall be entitled to reasonable attorney's fees in
addition to other costs.” (Civ. Code section 1717, subd. (a).)
 
DISCUSSION
 
            Defendant
moves for attorney’s fees totaling $24,395.00. Court trial was held in this
case on November 14, 2023. Defendant’s motion to dismiss Plaintiff’s complaint
was granted, and judgment was awarded in Defendant’s favor. Defendant brings
this motion for attorney’s fees as the prevailing party based on a contractual
term awarding attorney’s fees.
 
Paragraph XIX of the contract
provides: “In the event of a dispute arising out of this Contract that cannot
be resolved by mutual agreement, the Parties agree to engage in mediation. If
the matter cannot be resolved through mediation, and legal action ensues, the
successful party will be entitled to its legal fees, including, but not limited
to its attorneys’ fees.” (Cross-Complaint, Exhibit A at p. 4.)
 
            “[T]he fee setting inquiry in
California ordinarily begins with the “lodestar,” i.e., the number of hours
reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate.” (PLCM Group
v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095.) “The reasonable hourly rate is
that prevailing in the community for similar work.” (Ibid.) Once the
lodestar figure is calculated, a court may adjust the award based on factors
such as “(1) the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, (2) the
skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the extent to which the nature of the
litigation precluded other employment by the attorneys, (4) the contingent
nature of the fee award.” (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122,
1132.) “The purpose of such adjustment is to fix a fee at the fair market value
for the particular action.” (Ibid.) 
 
            Defendant
seeks fees totaling 67.7 hours worked at a rate of $350 plus $3,631.89 in
costs. (Ryan Decl. ¶ 2.) Defendant also seeks an additional $700
for fees related to the present motion. (Id. ¶ 3.) Defendant’s hourly
rate and number of hours are reasonable.
 
            Defendant’s
motion for attorney’s fees is granted for a total of $24,395.00.
 
CONCLUSION
 
            Defendant’s
motion for attorney’s fees is GRANTED for a total of $24,395.00.
