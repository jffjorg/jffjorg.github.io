Elysian City Lights Limited Partnership et al., 
Motion
to Compel Further Responses to Requests for Attorney’s Fees and Costs
The Court
considered the moving papers, opposition, and reply.
            The
motion is DENIED.
 
Background
This an action regarding injuries sustained by Plaintiff Mirna Valerio
Molina (“Plaintiff”) while riding an elevator owned and operated, or otherwise
controlled by, Defendants Elysian City Lights (“Elysian”), Aperto Property Management,
Inc. (“Aperto”), TK Elevator Corporation (“TKE” collectively, “Defendants”).
The complaint alleges causes of action in (1) negligence, (2) premises
liability, (3) common carrier liability, (4) strict product liability, (5)
negligent product liability, and (6) breach of express or implied warranties by
Plaintiff.
On November 3, 2023, Plaintiff filed a motion to compel Defendant TKE to
provide further responses to Plaintiff’s Request for Production of Documents, Set
One (“RFP”, or the “Motion to Compel”).
 
Legal
Standard
Any party may
obtain discovery . . . by inspecting, copying, testing, or sampling documents,
tangible things, land or other property, and electronically stored information
in the possession, custody, or control of any other party to the action.” (CCP
§ 2031.010(a).) “Within 30 days after service of a demand for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling, the party to whom the demand is directed shall
serve the original of the response to it on the party making the demand, and a
copy of the response on all other parties who have appeared in the action,
unless on motion of the party making the demand, the court has shortened the
time for response, or unless on motion of the party to whom the demand has been
directed, the court has extended the time for response.” (CCP § 2031.260(a).)
The court is
authorized to award as sanctions the moving party's reasonable expenses
including attorney fees on the motion to compel. “Reasonable expenses” include
the time moving party's counsel spent in research and preparation of the motion
and court time in connection
with the motion. (See Ghanooni v. Super Shuttle of Los Angeles (1993) 20
CA4th 256, 262, 24 CR2d 501, 505; Cornerstone Realty Advisors, LLC v. Summit
Healthcare REIT, Inc. (2020) 56 CA5th 771, 790, “Reasonable expenses may
include attorney fees, filing fees, referee fees, and other costs incurred”.)
Lawyers or other self-represented litigants (appearing on their own behalf)
cannot recover attorney fees as discovery sanctions. (Argaman v. Ratan
(1999) 73 CA4th 1173, 1179, Kravitz v. Sup.Ct. (Milner) (2001) 91
CA4th 1015, 1021, 111 CR2d 385, 389 (involving inspection demands).)
 
Discussion
            Motion to Compel Further Responses to
Requests for Production 
Plaintiff moves
for the production of maintenance and service record documents related to the subject
elevator on the grounds that the discovery requests are not protected by
privacy or privilege, Defendant’s responses are incomplete and evasive,
Defendants’ objections are without merit, and Defendant’s statement of
compliance is defective. (Motion, p. 2:12-14.) The Court notes that the
motion’s memorandum of points and authorities is not paginated. 
Procedural
Issues
                        Meet
and Confer
Plaintiff
delivered a meet and confer letter to Defendant TKE on March 23, 2024,
requesting supplemental responses to the Requests for Production of Documents,
Set One, served on December 6, 2023. (Asobie Decl., ¶ 4.). On June 13, 2023,
the parties attended an Independent Discovery Conference (“IDC”) and were
unable to resolve the issues of the motion. (Id., ¶ 9.) Defendant argues
the IDC was unproductive because Plaintiff’s counsel did not discuss the
sufficiency of the new time frame of service records (three years prior to the
incident and six months following the incident.) (Opposition, p. 2:10-16.) Plaintiff
maintains that the IDC was attended in good faith, that no three-year timeframe
was stipulated, and that motion was necessary to receive production of
documents initially requested on December 6, 2022. (Amended Reply, p. 6:6-15.)
Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s meet and confer efforts are satisfied.
            Evidentiary Objections
Much of
Plaintiff’s motion is directed at the timeframe of service records produced by
Defendant TKE. Plaintiff’s expert witness, Joseph L. Stabler has requested
Defendant TKE to produce five years of service records (Stabler Decl., ¶ 4),
while Defendant TKE’s expert witness, Charles A. Bigler, declares that three
years of service records are sufficient to evaluate liability. (Bigler Decl. ¶
6.) Defendants submit an evidentiary objection as to portions of the
declarations of Plaintiff’s counsel and Plaintiff’s expert witness. 
Particularly,
Defendant TKE objects to Stabler’s statement that “at least five (5) years of
the repair and maintenance records” are necessary to determine the cause of the
malfunction on the service elevator, on the grounds that the opinion is
conclusory, and lacks foundation to support the request of five years of
records. (Stabler Decl., ¶ 4.) In response, Plaintiff argues that Joseph
Stabler’s opinion has laid a proper foundation, as his education, certifications
and skills are compiled in his resume, Exhibit A to the declaration. (Response
to Evidentiary Objections, p. 1:3-17, Exhibit B.).
Defendant TKE
also objects to statements in the declaration of Plaintiff’s counsel, Ugo O.
Asobie (“Abosie Decl.”). Defendant TKE points out, as irrelevant, where
Plaintiff’s counsel mis-identifies as “Plaintiff, in pro per” and refers to a
party in another, unrelated case, on the production requests at issue.
Defendant TKE also objects to Asobie’s declarations as to request for
sanctions, arguing that Asobie lacks foundation and has not proffered evidence
of the time incurred in preparing, and attending the hearing on the Motion to
Compel. (Evidentiary Objections, pp. 2:20-3:19.)
 The Court concludes that Plaintiff has not
been prejudiced by the errors deemed “irrelevant” by Defendant TKE. In
response, Plaintiff supplements an amended declaration correcting the typos at
issue. (Response to Evidentiary Objections, p. 2:21-24, 4.) Plaintiff further
alleges that the figures stated as to its counsel’s hourly fee, and time spent
preparing and hearing the Motion are admissible lay witness opinion testimony,
rationally based on Plaintiff’s counsel’s perception.  The determination of the amount of attorney's
fees to award as sanctions is within the judge's discretion, which is not bound
by the moving party's calculation of hours and fee rates. (West Coast Dev. v
Reed (1992) 2 CA4th 693, 3 CR2d 790. A judge is not required to make a
strict accounting of expenses in imposing sanctions; CCP § 128.5 requires no
more than a causal relationship between the sanctioned conduct and the expenses
the moving party incurred. On v. Cow Hollow Props. (1990) 222 CA3d 1568,
272 CR 535.) Here, the Court possess the discretion to adjust the time awarded
and consider the merits of Plaintiff’s counsel’s claims.
Therefore, the
Court denies Defendant TKE’s evidentiary objections, entirely.
 
Merits of the
Motion
In an amended
reply, dated October 22, 2024, Plaintiff has moved for an order requiring
Defendant to produce a privilege log as to RFP Nos. 13, 17, 18, 22, 26, 27, 30,
31, and 32. (Amended Reply, p. 2:2-6.) Plaintiff maintains that Defendant
should be ordered to produce verified responses to RFP Nos. 1, 4, 8-10, 13, 17,
21, 22, 26, 27, and 30-32, from November 17, 2021, to November 17, 2022. The
requests for production are stated as follows:
RFP No. 1: “A
copy or the original of any and all DOCUMENTS that relates to any preventative maintenance
that you performed on the elevator that forms the subject of this action (Elevator
number 00133254) between 11/17/2017 to 11/17/2022.” 
 
RFP No. 4: “A

RFP No. 9: “A
copy or the original of any and all DOCUMENTS that relates to any preventative maintenance
that you performed on Elevator Number 00133254 (which is located at 1370 W Allison
Street Los Angeles, California 90026) between 11/17/2017 to 11/17/2022.”
 
RFP No. 10: “A
copy or the original of any and all DOCUMENTS that relates to any general maintenance
that you performed on Elevator Number 00133254 (which is located at 1370 W Allison
Street Los Angeles, California 90026) between 11/17/2017 to 11/17/2022.”
 
RFP No. 13: “A
copy or the original of any and all DOCUMENTS (other than DOCUMENTS that are covered
by Attorney/Client Privilege) regarding any and all correspondence between YOU
and DEFENDANT, Elysian City Lights, A California Limited Partnership, from 11/17/2017
to 11/17/2022, regarding the elevator that forms the subject of this action (Elevator
number 00133254)”
 
RFP No. 17: “A
copy or the original of any and all DOCUMENTS that relates in any way to any
offer that YOU made to DEFENDANT, Elysian City Lights, A California Limited
Partnership, to upgrade, or change, Elevator Number 00133254 or any of the
parts of Elevator Number 00133254”
 
RFP No. 18: “A
copy or the original of any and all DOCUMENTS that relates in any way to any
offer that YOU made to the Defendant, Elysian City Lights, A California Limited
Partnership, to add any safety device to Elevator Number 00133254”
 
RFP No. 21: “A
copy or the original of any and all DOCUMENTS regarding YOUR preventative maintenance
log policy, that was in effect on the 18th of May, 2022”
 
RFP No. 22: “A
copy, or the original, of any and all DOCUMENTS that relates to any inspection
that was performed on Elevator Number 00133254 between 11/17/2017 to 11/17/2022”
 
RFP No. 26: “copy
or the original of any and all DOCUMENTS that relates in any way to any Notice of
Maintenance items that YOU prepared regarding Elevator Number 00133254.”
 
RFP No. 27: “A
copy or the original of any and Invoices, that relates to Elevator Number
00133254, for the period 11/17/2017 to 11/17/2022.”
 
RFP No. 30: “A
copy or the original of any and all DOCUMENTS, including invoices, that relates
to any and all work that YOU performed on Elevator Number 00133254 between
January, 2022 to November, 2022”
 
RFP No. 31: “A
copy or the original of any and all DOCUMENTS, including invoices, that relates
to any and all repairs that YOU performed on Elevator Number 00133254 between
January, 2022 to November, 2022”
 
RFP No. 32: “A
copy or the original of any and all DOCUMENTS, including invoices, that relates
to any and all maintenance that YOU performed on Elevator Number 00133254
between January, 2022 to November, 2022”
 
Defendant
objects, in part, to these requests for production on the grounds that they are
overly broad in time and scope, and has
produced preventative maintenance records, service records, repair records, and
general maintenance records between May 2019 to November 2022. (Separate
Statement, pp. 1-5, Exhibit B.) Plaintiff contends Defendant’s
production of documents requested, reduced to a three-year scope, is “not
agreeable” to Plaintiff because the documents requested are relevant, and
likely to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. (Separate Statement, p.
5:14-23.) The Court agrees with Defendant, on the grounds that the verified
responses have provided three years of records for Plaintiff’s review.
 
The court
therefore DENIES Plaintiffs’ motion to compel further responses to Requests for
Production of Documents, Set One.
            Sanctions
Plaintiff’s counsel Ugo S. Asobie, Esq., requests sanctions in the
amount of $8,560.00 in attorney’s fees and costs against Defendant TK Elevator
Corporation and their attorney of record. Plaintiff’s counsel claims to have
spent a total of 15 hours in connection with the instant motion, at an hourly
billing rate of $500.00, plus the $60.00 filing fee. (Asobie Decl., ¶ 12-17.) Plaintiff
alleges to have spent 3 hours on meet and confer efforts (preparing and
attending the IDC), 10 hours preparing the motion (5 hours preparing the motion,
plus 5 hours preparing the amended separate statement), and 2 hours reviewing
the opposition, preparing a reply and attending the upcoming hearing. (Id.) The Court finds that the parties did meet and
confer in good faith attempt to resolve the disputes, and therefore declines to
award sanctions for Plaintiff’s 3 hours spent on meeting with Defendant’s
counsel. The Court finds it reasonable to award 0.50 for the hearing attendance
on this motion. While
Plaintiff’s counsel’s hourly rate is reasonable, the number of hours Plaintiff
seeks to recover is unreasonable. The issues raised in the motion do not
justify $8,560.00 in attorney’s fees and costs. The court finds that awarding
sanctions in this case as unreasonable.
Therefore, Plaintiff’s request for sanctions is DENIED.
 
            It
is so ordered.
