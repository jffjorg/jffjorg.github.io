And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to requests for production of documents. The plaintiff had sought to compel the defendant to produce additional documents related to the subject elevator, including maintenance and service records. The defendant had produced documents in response to the requests, but the plaintiff claimed that the production was incomplete and evasive.

The judge found that the parties had met and conferred in good faith to resolve the disputes, but that the plaintiff's requests for production were overly broad in time and scope. The judge also denied the plaintiff's request for sanctions against the defendant, finding that the issues raised in the motion did not justify the requested amount of attorney's fees and costs.

The judge noted that the defendant had produced documents in response to the requests, including preventative maintenance records, service records, repair records, and general maintenance records between May 2019 to November 2022. The judge found that the defendant's production was reasonable and that the plaintiff's requests for further responses were not justified.
