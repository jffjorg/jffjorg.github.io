II.      Legal Standard 

“If
parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties
outside of
the presence of the court or orally before the court, for settlement of the
case, or part
thereof, the court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the
settlement. If requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the
parties to enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of the settlement.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6, subd. (a).)
III.     Discussion 
Plaintiff
moves the Court for an order to vacate the dismissal and for entry of judgment (i.e.,
in the amount of $15,700.58) under the terms of the stipulated settlement of
this case.
          A.       Request
for Judicial Notice 
The
Court grants Plaintiff’s Request for Judicial Notice, to the extent that
the Court takes judicial notice of the filing date and existence of the
Stipulation Agreement.
          B.       Merits
On or about December 22, 2021, Plaintiff and Defendant entered
into a “Stipulation Agreement.” (Langedyk Decl., ¶ 2, Exh. B; RJN, Exh. B.) The
“Stipulation Agreement” provides, in pertinent part, as follows:
          “1. BRYAN DANGELO
(‘Defendant’) stipulates to the entry of judgment in favor of Bank of' America,
N.A. (‘Plaintiff’) in the principal sum of $33,903.58 and court costs of
$957.00 for a total judgment in the amount of $34,860.58 (the ‘Judgment
Amount’) . . .
          2. Plaintiff
and Defendant (together, the ‘Parties’) agree that $33,903.58 is the accurate
liquidated amount owed by Defendant for the account number ending in 2837 (the
‘Account’).
          3.
Notwithstanding Defendant’s agreement to have judgment entered against him/her.
Plaintiff will not request that judgment be entered so long as Defendant is not
in default with the payment plan set forth herein.
          4. Defendant
agrees to pay to Plaintiff a minimum of $800.00 on or before the 20th day of
each and every month commencing in December, 2021 followed by a final payment
of $460.58 on or before July 20, 2025, until the Defendant has paid the Judgment
Amount. These consecutive monthly installments, totaling $34,860.58, timely received,
will constitute full satisfaction of the Judgment Amount. Time is of the
essence with respect to all payments. If Defendant fails to make full and timely
payment of any installment or if any payment reversed, then the full remaining
balance will be due and Plaintiff shall be entitled to enter judgment for the
Judgment Amount plus any motion and/or order fees required by the court, less
credit for payments made.
          5. Acceptance
of any one or more late or partial payments by Plaintiff or anyone acting on Plaintiff's
behalf shall neither constitute a waiver of, nor in any way prejudice, Plaintiff’s
right to demand and receive timely payments thereafter or to declare a default
hereunder. Plaintiff’s failure to declare a default under this Stipulation when
so entitled, shall neither constitute a waiver of, nor in any way prejudice, Plaintiff’s
s right to declare a default thereafter.
          6. Payments
due as stipulated above shall be made payable to Bank of America, N.A., notated
with Defendant's account number and sent to the following payment address:
          Hunt &
Henriques
          7017 Realm
Dr.
          San Jose CA
95119
          7. The
parties jointly request that this court retain jurisdiction under Code of Civil
Procedure § 664.6. . .To the extent that the court dismisses the case without prejudice
and pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 664.6, the court shall retain
jurisdiction. The Parties further agree that in the event of a default in payments
and upon Plaintiff’s motion served and filed in accordance with Code of Civil Procedure
§ 1005(b), the court shall reopen the case, vacate any dismissal, and enter
judgment for the Judgment Amount plus any motion and/or order fee(s) required
by the court, less credit for payments made. Notice does not give Defendant a
right to cure; notice only gives Defendant a right to appear and offer evidence
that Defendant did not default on the payment plan. . .” (Id.) 
Court records reflect that an “Order on Settlement
Agreement and Stipulation for Judgment” was entered on January 10, 2022. (See
also Langedyk Decl., ¶ 4.) 
The last payment Plaintiff received from Defendant was on
November 27, 2023. (Id., ¶ 5.) Plaintiff mail-served Defendant with a
“Notice of Intention to Request Entry of Judgment Under Stipulation” dated
February 8, 2024. (Id., ¶ 6, Exh. A.) Defendant has paid a total of
$19,200.00 and owes a principal balance of $14,703.58 plus court costs in the
sum of $997.00 for a total judgment of $15,700.58. (Id., ¶¶ 7 and 8.)
The
unopposed motion is granted.
