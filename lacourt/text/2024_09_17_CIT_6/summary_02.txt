And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the motion of Joe M. Chou and Heather Lien to file a compulsory cross-complaint. The motion was filed on August 19, 2024, and opposed by the plaintiff on September 4, 2024. The court finds that the motion was not brought in good faith and was intended to delay the trial in the case. The court notes that the facts underlying the proposed cross-complaint occurred long ago and that the defendants' counsel has been aware of these facts since they substituted into the case in January 2024. The court also notes that the defendants have failed to provide any explanation for the delay in seeking leave to file the cross-complaint. As a result, the court denies the motion and orders the plaintiff to give notice of the court's ruling within five calendar days.
