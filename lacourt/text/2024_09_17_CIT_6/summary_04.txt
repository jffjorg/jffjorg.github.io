And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has tentatively ruled that Plaintiffs' motion to compel compliance with three subpoenas duces tecum records only from Chase Bank is GRANTED. The Court finds that Plaintiffs are entitled to the documents requested, as Defendant has not established a legally protected privacy interest in the records of other persons. The Judge also finds that the subpoena is reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence and that Defendant has not met his burden of showing that production of the documents would cause him to suffer some sort of undue burden. The Court orders Chase Bank to produce all documents requested in the subject subpoenas within 30 days of this order, and orders Plaintiffs to give notice of the Court's ruling within five calendar days of this order.
