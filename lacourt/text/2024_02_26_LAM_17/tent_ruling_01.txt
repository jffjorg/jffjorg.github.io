JOHN DEERE CONSTRUCTION &
  FORESTRY COMPANY 
                           
         vs.
 
LUIS VIVAS ARIAS 
 
 


 Case No.: 
  21STCV33893
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  February 26, 2024



 
            Plaintiff’s
motion for order compelling third-party Yajaira Vivas to appear for an OSC re:
contempt is GRANTED. 
 
Vivas is
sanctioned, jointly and severally with counsel, $1,060.00. 
 
            On
9/14/2021, Plaintiff John Deere Construction Company (Plaintiff) filed suit
against Luis Vivas Arias (Defendant), alleging: (1) breach of contract—five
counts; and (2) claim and delivery—five counts. 
 
            On
2/8/2024, Plaintiff moved for an order directing third-party Yajaira Vivas to
show cause as to why she should not be held in contempt for willfully
disobeying the Court’s 4/12/2023 order for her to appear for deposition.
Plaintiff also seeks monetary sanctions. 
 
            The
motion is unopposed. 
 
Discussion 
 
            On
4/12/2023, the Court granted Defendants’ motion to compel the deposition of
third-party witness Yajaira Vivas. Subsequently, a deposition subpoena was
personally served on her to appear on 8/9/2023. She did not appear or notify
counsel that she was not going to appear for the deposition.
 
            Plaintiff
moved ex parte for an OSC re: Contempt for Vivas’s failure. The motion
was granted on 10/5/2023. An OSC was set for 12/4/2023. After a number of
continuances, at the 1/12/2023 hearing, the Court ordered counsel to refile and
reserve the motion for contempt on Vivas. 
 
            After
re-serving the motion on Vivas, Vivas has still not opposed the motion.
Accordingly, Vivas has not set forth any justification for her failure to obey
a Court order, and Plaintiff’s motion for an OSC re: contempt is granted. Vivas
is sanctioned, jointly and severally with counsel, $1,060, the full amount
requested by Plaintiff.  
 
It is so ordered.
