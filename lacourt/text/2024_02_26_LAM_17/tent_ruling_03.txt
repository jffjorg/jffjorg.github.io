motion to tax costs is DENIED.
 
On 1/24/2018,

            On
12/27/2023, Plaintiffs moved to tax the costs of Aspen Skilled Healthcare,
Inc., Arizona & 21st Corp., and Berkley West Convalescent
Hospital, Inc. 
 
Discussion 
 
            Plaintiffs
argue that Defendants’ memorandum of costs is untimely, and that they are not
the prevailing party. Plaintiff also argues that the following costs should be
taxed:
 
-        
Filing Fees: Item; 1 (a-g) and
Attachment 1 g (1-15 and Attachment 5d (1-10): $5,432. 50. 
-        
Items 3, 6, 12 Attachment 1 g: $1,305
-        
Item; 5 (a,b,c) and Attachment 5 d: $
528.00.
-        
Court Reporters Fees: $1,350.00. 
-        
Item 1 (d,e, f) and Attachment 1g
(2-14): (See Motion: 8: 10-24) 
-        
Item; 5 (a-c) and attachment 5-d:
$528.00. 
-        
Item 12c: $1,350.00. 
 
As to the
first contention of untimeliness, the prevailing party must “serve and file a memorandum
of costs within 15 days after the date of service of the notice of entry of
judgment.” (Rule of Court 3.1700.)
 
Plaintiffs
assert the “clerk filed and served by certified mail the notice of entry of
judgment of dismissal on Defendant through Their Counsel on November 13, 2023.”
(Plaintiffs’ Notice of Motion to Strike Memorandum of Costs, 2:19-21.)[1]
As such, they argue Defendant’s Memorandum of Costs is untimely. 
 
However, the
Notice of Entry of Judgment was electronically filed on November 20, 2023.
(Notice of Entry of Judgment or Order.)   Because of this, fifteen days beyond November
20, 2023 was December 5, 2023. Defendant timely served the Memorandum of Costs
on December 5, 2023.
 
As for the
second contention, the Court ordered that Plaintiffs’ SAC is dismissed as to
Defendants and that judgment is entered on behalf of Defendants and against
Plaintiffs. (Notice of Entry of Judgment or Order) Therefore, Defendants are
the prevailing parties entitled as a matter of right to recover costs in this
action. As the prevailing party, Defendants are entitled to costs set forth in
CCP section 1033.5 . 
 
After review
of Defendants’ supporting documentation and argument, the Court finds all of
Defendants claimed costs of $5,432.50 to be corroborated, and to have been
reasonably incurred. 
 
Based on the
foregoing, Plaintiffs’ motion to tax costs is denied. 
 
 
It is so ordered.
