And here is a summary in English text:

This tentative ruling by Judge Jon R. Takasugi grants the California Department of Education's (plaintiff) motion for entry of judgment against Golden Day Schools, Inc. and Clark Parker (defendants). The plaintiff filed a lawsuit on May 4, 2018, alleging breach of contract and declaratory judgment. The court granted summary adjudication on August 2, 2023, and the defendants filed a petition for bankruptcy on October 16, 2022, which was lifted by the bankruptcy court on January 8, 2024. The plaintiff's motion for entry of judgment is granted due to the lack of additional causes of action to adjudicate and the fact that all parties have agreed to the amended proposed judgment. The ruling also addresses the defendants' objections to the proposed judgment, finding them to be without merit. The judge orders that the defendants are personally liable for the debts of Golden Day Schools, Inc. due to the alter ego doctrine. The ruling is intended to be final, and parties who intend to submit on the tentative must email the court by 4 p.m. the day prior to the hearing.
