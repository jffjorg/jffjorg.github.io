 Hearing
  Date:  February 26, 2024



 
 
Plaintiff’s
motion for the entry of judgment is GRANTED. 
 
 
On 5/4/2018, Plaintiff California Department of Education
(Plaintiff) filed suit against Golden Day Schools, Inc. and Clark Parker,
alleging breach of contract and declaratory judgment. 
 
            On
8/2/2023, the Court granted CDE’s motion for summary adjudication and motion in
limine no. 1. 
 
            On
1/25/2024, Plaintiff moved for an order lifting the stay of these consolidated
civil actions and directing the clerk to enter judgment in BC705147 and 19STCV12595.
 
Discussion 
 
            On
June 16, 2023, the Court held a hearing on the motion for summary adjudication
and a related motion in limine. (Heyn Decl. ¶ 6.) It granted both motions in
their entirety by minute order entered on June 16, 2023. 
 
On September
27, 2023, the Department filed and served a proposed judgment in this matter.
(Heyn Decl. ¶ 8.) On October 10, 2023, the Parkers timely filed and served
their objections to this first proposed judgment. Based on the Parkers’
objections, on October 12, 2023, the Department filed and served an [Amended
Proposed] Judgment. (Ibid.) Prior to the Parkers’ opposition to this
motion, there had been no objections to the [Amended Proposed] Judgment. (Ibid.)
 
On October
16, 2022, Clark Parker filed a petition for bankruptcy, which automatically
stayed all action against him. On January 8, 2024, the bankruptcy court
presiding over his bankruptcy case entered its order lifting the automatic stay
so that this civil action could recommence. (Heyn Decl. ¶ 9; Ex. D.) Among the
other grounds for granting relief from the automatic stay, the bankruptcy court
found “there is no question that this [bankruptcy] case was filed as part of a scheme
to delay and hinder DOE [the Department of Education] in the State
Court action.” (Ex. D, at p. 8 of 11 [emphasis added].)
 
Because of
the significant time that has elapsed since the Department filed and served its
[Amended Proposed] Judgment in October, over $400,000 of pre-judgment interest
has accrued on the Department’s breach of contracts causes of action. (Heyn
Decl. ¶ 10.) In order to capture this significant pre-judgment interest, on
January 25, 2024, the Department served a [Second Amended Proposed] Judgment
(Ex. E.), which substantially conforms to the [Amended Proposed] Judgment (as
to which the Parkers have filed no objections), but inserts blanks for the
total amount owed as of the date the judgment is entered. (Heyn Decl. ¶ 11.)
 
Plaintiff
contends that the Court should enter judgment now because there are no
additional causes of action to adjudicate. “A judgment is the final
determination of the rights of the parties in an action or proceeding.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 577.) By its order entered August 2, 2023, the Court granted
summary adjudication on the first and second causes of action in Case No.
BC705147 and the first cause of action in Consolidated Case No. 19STCV12595.
(Ex. B & C.) By its request for dismissal filed October 4, 2023, the
Department has dismissed all other causes of action. (Heyn Decl. ¶ 7.) There is
nothing more for this Court to do as a predicate to making a final determination
of the parties’ rights (except the Department’s post-judgment rights).
 
In
opposition, Defendants raise 20 objections to the proposed judgment. However,
first, many of the objections are identical, and merely repeat the same
argument. Second, the Court finds none of the objections persuasive. For
example, Defendants repeatedly object to the language in the Proposed Judgment
that states “(i) Golden Day Schools, Inc. and (ii) Clark E. Parker, and (iii)
Clark E. Parker and Jeanette E. Parker, Trustees of the Parker Trust dated June
15, 2006 are liable to the Department for” breach of contract.” Defendants
object, arguing that the Court found that “Clark Parker, as an individual, and
Clark and Jeanette Parker, as trustees, have alter ego liability for Golden Day
debts, but did not determine personal liability for the Parkers.   However, a finding of alter-ego liability
entails a finding that there is no separation between the entity and the
individual. As such,  Clark Parker, as an
individual, and Clark and Jeanette Parker, as trustees, are personally liable
for the debts of Golden Day by virtue of the alter-ego finding, given that they
have been found to be one in the same. (“Under the standard alter ego
doctrine … an individual shareholder may be held personally liable for claims
against the corporation.”) (Postal Instant Press, Inc. v. Kaswa Corp.
(2008) 162 Cal. App. 4th 1510, 1513.) 
 
As
Plaintiff’s reply explains in detail, Defendants’ objections are without merit
and. Moreover, Defendants do not refute the calculations of amounts owed as set
forth in the First Supplemental Declaration of Matthew Heyn in support of this
motion.  
 
Based on the
foregoing, Plaintiff’s motion for the entry of judgment is granted. 
 
It is so ordered.
