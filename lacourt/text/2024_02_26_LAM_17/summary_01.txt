And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion for an order compelling third-party Yajaira Vivas to appear for an OSC re: contempt. Yajaira Vivas has failed to obey a court order to appear for a deposition, and the plaintiff has sought monetary sanctions. The motion is unopposed, and the court finds that Yajaira Vivas has not provided any justification for her failure to comply with the court's order. As a result, the court sanctions Yajaira Vivas, jointly and severally with her counsel, in the amount of $1,060.00. The court also grants the plaintiff's motion ex parte for an OSC re: Contempt.
