Motion for Leave to File First Amended Answer to Complaint 
The court considered the moving
paper.  No opposition or reply papers
were filed. 
RULING 
The motion is GRANTED. 
BACKGROUND 
 On December 23, 2022, Jane Doe
K.D. filed her complaint against Doe 1, Doe 2, and Does 3 through 60 asserting
six causes of action for (1) childhood sexual abuse; (2) intentional infliction
of emotional distress; (3) negligence based on Government Code §§ 815.2 and 820; (4)
failure to report suspected child abuse (Government Code §§ 815.2, 815.6 and
820); (5)  negligent supervision of a minor (Government
Code §§ 815.2 and 820); and
(6) negligence.  Plaintiff alleges that she was the victim of unlawful childhood sexual
assault and molestation and other misconduct by school district employee Doe 2,
in or around the 1988/1989 school year when plaintiff was approximately 15
years old at George Washington Preparatory High School. Plaintiff alleges that
Doe 2 was a weightlifting coach at the high school. 
 Plaintiff amended her complaint substituting
Doe 1 with Los Angeles Unified School District and Doe 2 with Darryl Charles
Lott. 
Now, defendant LAUSD moves for leave
to file a first amended answer to add an affirmative defense for “Due Process
as Applied” under CCP §§ 473, subdivision (a)(1) and 576, and
the California Rules of Court, rule 3.1324.  No opposition has been filed. 
LEGAL AUTHORITY 
The court may, in furtherance of justice, and on any terms as may
be proper, allow a party to amend any pleading or proceeding by adding or
striking out the name of any party, or by correcting a mistake in the name of a
party, or a mistake in any other respect.
Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (a)(1).  In addition, “any judge, at any time before or
after commencement of trial, in the furtherance of justice, and upon such terms
as may be proper, may allow the amendment of any pleading or pretrial
conference order.”  Code Civ. Proc., §
576.
“[T]he court’s discretion will
usually be exercised liberally to permit amendment of the pleadings.”  Howard v. County of San Diego (2010)
184 Cal.App.4th 1422, 1428.
If the motion to amend is timely made and the granting of the
motion will not prejudice the opposing party, it is error to refuse permission
to amend and where the refusal also results in a party being deprived of the
right to assert a meritorious cause of action or a meritorious defense, it is
not only error but an abuse of discretion.
Morgan v. Superior Court of
Cal. In and For Los Angeles County (1959) 172
Cal.App.2d 527, 530; Higgins v. Del Faro (1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 558, 564
(“Where no prejudice is shown to the adverse party, the liberal rule of
allowance prevails.”).
Absent prejudice to the
opposing party, delay in requesting the amendment is not grounds for denial of
leave to amend.  See, e.g., Arthur L.
Sachs, Inc. v. City of Oceanside (1984) 151 Cal.App.3d 315, 324 (denial of
leave to amend on eve of trial was error absent a showing a prejudice); Higgins,
123 Cal.App.3d at 565–566 (same).
A motion to amend a pleading
must:
(1) include a copy of the
proposed amendment or amended pleading;
(2) state what allegations
will be deleted; and
(3) state what allegations
will be added.
Cal. Rule of Court, rule 3.1324, subd. (a).
A separate declaration must
accompany the motion and must specify:
(1) The effect of the
amendment;
(2) Why the amendment is
necessary and proper;
(3) When the facts giving rise
to the amended allegations were discovered; and
(4) The reasons why the
request for amendment was not made earlier.
Cal. Rule of Court, rule 3.1324, subd. (b).
DISCUSSION 
Defendant LAUSD requests leave to file
a first amended answer that adds an affirmative defense.  The court grants leave to amend. 
Here, defendant LAUSD seeks to amend
its answer seven months after its original answer was filed.  The Court finds that defendant
LAUSD complied with the requirements of CRC rule 3.1324, subdivisions (a) and
(b).  Ex. “1”; Declaration of Paul V.
Carelli IV ¶¶ 2-7. Also, the court finds that, as no opposition has been filed and the trial
date is not until October 2024, there appears to be no prejudice against the
plaintiff from granting the motion.  Given
the liberal policy favoring amendments and the lack of a showing of prejudice,
the court grants defendant’s leave to file its amended answer. 
 
ORDER 
Defendant LAUSD’s motion for leave to
file first amended answer is GRANTED. 
Moving party is ordered to give notice
of ruling.
