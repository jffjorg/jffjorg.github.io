And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings is denied. The defendant, Hyundai Motor America, has moved to compel arbitration and stay proceedings based on an arbitration provision in a Retail Installment Sale Contract (RISC) between the plaintiffs, Serina Reed and Mitchell Reed, and South Bay Hyundai. However, the judge finds that Hyundai is not a third-party beneficiary to the RISC and that the plaintiffs are not estopped from refusing to arbitrate their warranty claims against Hyundai. The judge concludes that there is no valid agreement to arbitrate between the parties and therefore denies the motion.
