BACKGROUND
 
On
February 16, 2024, Plaintiff Daniel A. Crowley filed a complaint for partition
of real property against Eva Norris and Preferred Ventures Corp. (erroneously
sued as Preferred Lending Group). Plaintiff alleges Defendant has refused to
voluntarily sell the Property or buy out Plaintiff’s interest. Accordingly,
Plaintiff has filed this complaint to have the Property partitioned, thereby
ending the co-ownership relationship. Plaintiff dismissed Preferred Lending
Corp. on June 18, 2024.  
 
A
Lis Pendens on the subject property was filed February 29, 2024. 
 
[Tentative]
Ruling
 
Plaintiff’s
Motion for Interlocutory Judgment of Partition and Appointment of Referee is
GRANTED. 
 
DISCUSSION
 
Plaintiff Daniel A.
Crowly moves this court for an interlocutory judgment of partition and
appointment of referee with regard to the partition of the condominium located
at 20950 Oxnard Street, Apartment 34, Woodland Hills,  CA 91367, Assessor’s Parcel Number
2149-018-048 (the “Property”).
 
Code of Civil Procedure
section 872.720(a) provides that if the court finds that the plaintiff is
entitled to partition, it shall make an interlocutory judgment that determines
the interests of the parties in the property and orders the partition and the
manner of partition. (CCP § 872.720(a).)  
 
“A partition action
may be commenced and maintained by any of the following persons: (1) A co-owner
of personal property.  (2) An owner of an estate of inheritance, an estate
for life, or an estate for years in real property where such property or estate
therein is owned by several persons concurrently or in successive estates.” (CCP
§872.210(a).) “The court shall order that the property be divided among the
parties in accordance with their interests in the property as determined in the
interlocutory judgment.” (CCP §872.810.)  
 
Here, the court
finds the elements for partition have been met.  First, there is no
indication that Plaintiff has waived their right to petition the Property. (See
Crowley Decl. ¶6.)  Second, Plaintiff and Defendant each hold an
undisputed 50% title interest in the Property. (Talkov Decl. ¶5, Exhs. 1,
3.) Third, the manner of partition must be partition by sale since the condominium
cannot be divided.   
 
Further, Plaintiff
has nominated Matthew Taylor, Esq. as referee, and there being no objection to
the nomination, the court finds good cause to appoint Mr. Taylor as referee to
market and sell the Property. Mr. Taylor attests to being an experienced
attorney in the field and will hire a real estate broker to market the
Property. (Taylor Decl. ¶8.) There is also no objection to any of the proposed
instructions to the referee so the instructions should be
approved.   
 
Mr. Taylor is to
post a $5,000 bond within four court days as set forth in the Motion.  As referee, Mr. Taylor shall perform an
accounting to determine an equitable allocation of partition costs and
disbursement of proceeds. (See CCP 872.140; 873.820(d).) Mr. Taylor shall also
file a report with the court upon the completion of the sale in conformance
with Code of Civil Procedure section 873.710. 
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion for Interlocutory Judgment
of Partition and Appointment of Referee is GRANTED.
