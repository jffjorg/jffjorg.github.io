And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Plaintiff Daniel A. Crowley's motion for an interlocutory judgment of partition and appointment of referee with regard to the partition of a condominium located at 20950 Oxnard Street, Apartment 34, Woodland Hills, CA 91367. The judge finds that the elements for partition have been met, including that there is no indication that Plaintiff has waived their right to petition the property, that Plaintiff and Defendant each hold an undisputed 50% title interest in the property, and that the manner of partition must be partition by sale since the condominium cannot be divided. The judge has appointed Matthew Taylor, Esq. as referee to market and sell the property, and has ordered that Mr. Taylor post a $5,000 bond within four court days. The judge has also approved the proposed instructions to the referee and has directed Mr. Taylor to perform an accounting to determine an equitable allocation of partition costs and disbursement of proceeds.
