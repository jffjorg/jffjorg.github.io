DISCUSSION
 
Plaintiff
Hugo Pereyra moves the court for an order, pursuant to Section 2031.300 of the
Code of Civil Procedure, compelling The Canby Place Homeowners Association to
respond to Plaintiff’s Request for Production of Documents, Set One; Special
Interrogatories, Set One; and Form Interrogatories, Set One. Plaintiff also
seeks monetary sanctions against Defendant and their attorney for failure to
serve a timely response. 
 
Where a party fails to serve timely responses to discovery requests,
the court may make an order compelling responses. (CCP §§ 2030.290, 2031.300,
2033.280; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.) A party that fails to
serve a timely response to the discovery request waives any objection to the
request, including one based on privilege or the protection of attorney work
product. (CCP §§2030.290(a), 2031.300(a), 2033.280(a); Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc., supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at 404.)
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.010, the propounding party may
also move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of
any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a
monetary sanction. (CCP § 2033.280(b).)
 
On May 15, 2024, Plaintiff propounded discovery onto Defendant
including Plaintiff’s Request for Production of Documents, Special
Interrogatories and Form Interrogatories (all Set One). (Szabo Decl. ¶3, Exh.
1.) The deadline for responding was June 14, 2024. (Szabo Decl. ¶4.) On June
10, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel granted an extension for Defendant to respond to
the discovery requests by July 5, 2024. (Szabo Decl. ¶5, Exh. 2.) Plaintiff’s
counsel granted several more requests for extensions on July 3, 2024, July 26,
2024, and August 8, 2024. (Szabo Decl. ¶¶6-9, Exhs. 3-6.) Plaintiff never
received any discovery and on September 4, 2024, sent an e-mail to defense
counsel demanding they provide responses without objections by September 11,
2024. (Szabo Decl. ¶¶10-11, Exh. 7.) Defendant never responded to Plaintiff’s
letter and never produced any of the requested discovery. (Szabo Decl. ¶12.) 
 
Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s unopposed
motions for an order compelling Defendant Canby Place Homeowners Association to
Respond to Request for Production of Documents, Set One, Special
Interrogatories, Set One, and Form Interrogatories, Set One are GRANTED. Defendant
is ordered to produce verified discovery responses and documents, without
objection, in twenty days.
 
Sanctions
 
Plaintiff seeks monetary sanctions against Defendant and their attorney
of record for having to bring the instant motions. Plaintiff seeks $1,573.47
for their motion to compel responses to their requests for production of
documents, $879.97 for their motion to compel responses to their special
interrogatories, and $1,611.22 for their motion to compel responses to their
form interrogatories. 
 
If a propounding party moves for and
obtains a court order compelling a response, the court shall impose monetary
sanctions against the party failing to timely respond to interrogatories and
demands for inspection unless that party acted with substantial justification
or the sanction would otherwise be unjust. (CCP §§ 2030.290(c), 2031.300(c),
2033.280(c); Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc., supra, 148
Cal.App.4th at 404.) 
 
The court GRANTS the request for
sanctions in the reduced amount of $822.50 for the motion to compel requests
for production of documents, $660.00 for the motion to compel special
interrogatories, and $285.00 for the motion to compel form interrogatories.
