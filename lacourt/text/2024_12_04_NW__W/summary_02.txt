And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel the defendant to further respond to special interrogatories and form interrogatories, but only in part. The court has also granted the plaintiff's motion to compel the defendant to further respond to request for admissions, but only in part, as some of the requests are now moot.

The court has found that the defendant's supplemental responses to the discovery requests were insufficient in some respects. The defendant's responses to some of the special interrogatories were too general and did not provide sufficient detail. The court has also found that the defendant's responses to some of the form interrogatories were evasive and failed to identify the relevant documents.

The court has granted the plaintiff's request for sanctions in the reduced amount of $1660.00, $1060.00, and $860.00 for having to bring the motions to compel further responses.
