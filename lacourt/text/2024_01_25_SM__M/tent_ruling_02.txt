for Sanctions

Legal
Standard
 
If a party fails to obey a court
order compelling it to provide a discovery response, “the court may make those
orders that are just, including the imposition of an issue sanction, an
evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction . . . In lieu of or in addition to
this sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction . . ..” (CCP §§
2030.290(c), 2030.300(e), 2031.300(c), 2031.320(c).) Misuse of the discovery
process, which includes disobeying a court order to provide discovery, is
conduct subject to sanctions. (CCP § 2023.010(g).) Possible sanctions are:
 
(a) [A] monetary
sanction ordering that one engaging in the misuse of the discovery process,
or any attorney advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses,
including attorney's fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct….
 
(b) [A]n issue
sanction ordering that designated facts shall be taken as established in
the action in accordance with the claim of the party adversely affected by the
misuse of the discovery process. The court may also impose an issue sanction by
an order prohibiting any party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process
from supporting or opposing designated claims or defenses.
 
(c) [A]n evidence
sanction by an order prohibiting any party engaging in the misuse of the
discovery process from introducing designated matters in evidence.
 
(d) [A] terminating
sanction by one of the following orders:
 
(1) An order
striking out the pleadings or parts of the pleadings of any party engaging in
the misuse of the discovery process.
 
(2) An order
staying further proceedings by that party until an order for discovery is
obeyed.
 
(3) An order
dismissing the action, or any part of the action, of that party.
 
(4) An order
rendering a judgment by default against that party.
 
(e) [A] contempt
sanction by an order treating the misuse of the discovery process as a
contempt of court.
 
(CCP § 2023.030 [emphasis added].)
 
The party seeking to impose
sanctions need only show the failure to obey earlier discovery orders. (Puritan
Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1985) 171 Cal.App.3d 877, 884 [interpreting
former statute dealing with “refusal” to comply].) However, severe sanctions
(i.e., terminating or evidentiary sanctions) for failure to comply with a court
order are allowed only where the failure was willful. (See R.S.
Creative, Inc. v. Creative Cotton, Ltd. (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 486, 495; Vallbona
v. Springer (1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 1525, 1545; Biles v. Exxon Mobil Corp.
(2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1327.) The burden of proof then shifts to the
party seeking to avoid sanctions to establish a satisfactory excuse for his or
her conduct. (Corns v. Miller (1986) 181 Cal.App.3d 195, 201; Williams
v. Russ (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 1215, 1227.)
 
EVIDENTIARY ISSUES
 
Defendant’s objections to the Fine declaration are
SUSTAINED as to nos. 1-2 [foundation] and OVERRULED as to no. 3.
 
Plaintiff’s objections to the Karber declaration are
SUSTAINED as to no. 2 [hearsay as to Karber’s statements only]; 7
[speculation/lack of foundation as to other employees’ actions]; and 8-9
[hearsay] and otherwise OVERRULED.
 
Plaintiffs’ objections to the Mahbubani declaration are SUSTAINED
as to no. 2 [lacks foundation for the assertion that the surveillance cameras
are triggered by motion detection] but otherwise OVERRULED.
 
Analysis
 
Plaintiff, Edward Fine
(“Plaintiff”) moves for sanctions against Defendant Diyaco LLC (“Defendant”)
for unspecified issue, evidentiary, and/or termination sanctions.  Principally, Plaintiff contends that
Defendant engaged in the spoliation of evidence, to wit, the video surveillance
footage of the incident. Spoliation of evidence means
the destruction or significant alteration of evidence or the failure to
preserve evidence for another's use in pending or future litigation. (Willard
v. Caterpillar, Inc. (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 892, 907, overruled on
other grounds in Cedars–Sinai Medical Center v. Superior Court (1998) 18
Cal.4th 1, 18, fn. 4 (Cedars.).) Such conduct is condemned because it “can
destroy fairness and justice, for it increases the risk of an erroneous
decision on the merits of the underlying cause of action. Destroying evidence
can also increase the costs of litigation as parties attempt to reconstruct the
destroyed evidence or to develop other evidence, which may be less accessible,
less persuasive, or both.” (Id. at 8.)   
  
While there is no tort cause of action for the intentional
destruction of evidence after litigation has commenced, it is a misuse of the
discovery process that is subject to a broad range of punishment, including
monetary, issue, evidentiary, and terminating sanctions. (Williams v. Russ¿(2008)
167 Cal.App.4th 1215, 1223; see CCP §§ 2023.010(d), 2023.030(a)-(d).)
Generally, severe sanctions should not be imposed until the court has attempted
less severe alternatives and found them to be unsuccessful and/or the record
clearly shows lesser sanctions would be ineffective. (Lopez v. Watchtower
Bible and Tract Society of New York, Inc.¿(2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 566, 604
[terminating sanctions order reversed where there was no showing the court
could not have obtained compliance by using lesser sanction e.g., issue or
evidentiary].) In extreme cases, terminating sanctions as a first measure are
authorized. (New Albertsons, Inc. v. Superior Court (2008) 168
Cal.App.4th 1403, 1434 [“sufficiently egregious, misconduct committed in
connection with the failure to produce evidence in discovery may justify the
imposition of nonmonetary sanctions even absent a prior order compelling
discovery, or its equivalent. Furthermore, a prior order may not be necessary
where it is reasonably clear that obtaining such an order would be futile.”];
accord Williams, supra, 167 Cal.App.4th at 1223.) However, numerous
cases hold that severe sanctions (i.e., terminating or evidentiary sanctions)
are allowed only where the violation was willful. (See R.S. Creative, Inc.
v. Creative Cotton, Ltd. (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 486, 495; Vallbona v.
Springer (1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 1525, 1545; Biles v. Exxon Mobil Corp.
(2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1327.)  
 
The complaint alleges that
Plaintiff slipped and fell in a hallway as a result of wet and slippery surface
at Defendant’s property. There were no cones, warning signs, postings or
caution tape to warn indicating a wet floor. 
Relevant to this dispute, Plaintiff requested all surveillance video of
the incident in initial written discovery. (Fine Decl. ¶ 7.) Defendant produced
362 video files from only one camera, Camera 6. (Id.) Camera 6 did not capture
the part of the hallway where Plaintiff fell and was pointed towards the
opposite side of the hallway. (Id.) Plaintiff sent Defendant a meet and confer
letter addressing these issues and requesting footage from all cameras that
show Plaintiff’s actual fall and other relevant evidence relating to the
condition of the floor at the time of the Incident. (Fine Decl. ¶ 8.) Defense
counsel informed Plaintiff that he would request the additional surveillance
footage from Defendant. Defense counsel also assured Plaintiff’s counsel that
no other camera angle would have captured Plaintiff’s fall other than what was
produced. (Id.) On July 6, 2023, Plaintiff received a new link with additional
footage, producing 402 video files. (Fine Decl. ¶ 9.) Additional footage from
Camera 5 and 10 was produced which showed the entire length of the hallway
where Plaintiff fell with no obstruction. (Id.) 
After reviewing all the footage, Plaintiff discovered there was
surveillance footage up until approximately three minutes prior to the incident
and hours after the incident. (Fine Decl. ¶ 10.) Plaintiff explains there is
apparent missing time stamps for the time of the Incident from Camera 10. (Id.)
Defendant alleged that the camera system is not set up to constantly record but
is rather triggered to begin recording only whenever it detects motion or
activity. (Fine Decl. ¶ 11.) Plaintiff finds this hard to believe because there
are many video files of surveillance footage of the lobby with no motion or
activity occurring. (Id.)
 
The instant record is not
well-developed enough to demonstrate that Defendants willfully deleted the
surveillance footage. Plaintiff raises a reasonable suspicion that Defendants
deleted the relevant portion of the video, since that critical portion is conveniently
missing. Defendants’ best explanation is that the motion sensor somehow did not
trigger recording. However, the current record does not provide foundation to
conclude the accuracy of this contention one way or the other. Thus,
terminating sanctions would be improper at this stage.
 
If Defendants, in fact, deleted the
relevant video evidence, the Court would be inclined to provide evidentiary or
issue sanctions. However, the Court is without power to issue an appropriate
sanction at this juncture. Plaintiff did not notice any particular sanction or
provide the required separate statement for such sanctions. (CRC Rule 3.1345(a).)
  Accordingly, the motion is DENIED.
