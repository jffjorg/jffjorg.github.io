And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion for sanctions against Defendant Diyaco LLC for alleged spoliation of evidence. The Plaintiff, Edward Fine, claims that the Defendant destroyed or significantly altered video surveillance footage of the incident, which is relevant to the case. The judge has reviewed the evidence and has found that the Defendant's explanation for the missing footage, that the motion sensor did not trigger recording, is unclear and lacks foundation. While the judge is not convinced that the Defendant willfully destroyed the evidence, the judge believes that the Defendant's actions were improper and may have prejudiced the Plaintiff. Therefore, the judge is denying the motion for terminating sanctions, but is considering imposing evidentiary or issue sanctions.
