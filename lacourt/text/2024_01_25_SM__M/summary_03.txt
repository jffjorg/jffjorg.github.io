And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiff, Roya Saghafi, filed a lawsuit against Access Specialty Animal Hospitals, et al. on March 13, 2018. The case was not brought to trial within the statutory time limit of five years, and the plaintiff has failed to establish reasonable diligence in prosecuting the case. The defendant has changed counsel multiple times, but this does not excuse the plaintiff's failure to prosecute the case. The plaintiff claims that there was an oral stipulation by prior Defendants' counsel to waive the five-year rule, but this is not supported by objective evidence and is therefore insufficient to show a valid waiver. The Court finds that the plaintiff has failed to establish its own due diligence and that it was not impossible, impracticable, or futile for the plaintiff to comply with the statutory five-year constraint due to causes beyond its control. Therefore, the motion to dismiss the case is granted, and the case is dismissed pursuant to CCP section 583.360.
