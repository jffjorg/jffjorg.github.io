And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted defendant Guadalupe Inchaurregui's special motion to strike the entire complaint filed by plaintiffs Luis Macias and Maria Macias. The complaint alleges eight causes of action, including abuse of process, fraud, and defamation, against defendant and her late husband, Francisco Inchaurregui. The judge found that the complaint seeks to hold defendant liable for protected activity, including her husband's death and her subsequent lawsuit against the plaintiffs. The judge also found that the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate a probability of prevailing on the merits of their claims and that the litigation privilege bars all of their claims. As a result, the court has struck the entire complaint without leave to amend.
