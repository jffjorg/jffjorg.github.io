And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of 24STCV17292, which involves an unlawful detainer complaint filed by 10th St. Property, LLC against Yosef Cohen. Cohen has demurred to the complaint on the basis of uncertainty, arguing that the notice to quit does not cite the specific section of the rental agreement that he allegedly failed to comply with. The Judge disagrees, finding that the notice to quit is clear and unambiguous, stating that Cohen must either pay rent or vacate the premises within three days. The Judge also notes that a notice to quit does not need to cite a specific section of the rental agreement. As a result, the Judge has overruled Cohen's demurrer and ordered him to answer the complaint within five days.
