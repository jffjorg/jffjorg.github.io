And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling concerns a motion to consolidate two cases, 21STCV30629 and 21STCV34221, filed by the defendant's counsel on September 11, 2023. The motion is to be heard on November 7, 2023. However, the Judge notes that the defendant, Juan De La Cruz Gutierrez, passed away on February 2, 2023, and the plaintiff, Everilda Ruano, has not filed an amendment naming a new defendant. Additionally, the Court has not yet ruled on the request to relate the two cases. The Judge cannot consolidate the cases unless they have previously been related. Therefore, the Judge continues the hearing to address these issues and sets the new hearing date for November 20, 2023, at 1:30 p.m. in Department 28 of the Spring Street Courthouse.
