April 23, 2021, Plaintiff Helen Wang filed this action against Defendants
Chihling Wu, Sung Hao Nien, and Does 1-15 for motor vehicle and general
negligence. 
On
May 27, 2021, Defendants Chihling Wu and Sung Hao Nien filed an answer. The
same day, Defendant and Cross-Complainant Chihling Wu and Jiaxin Nien, a minor
by and through her guardian ad litem Chihling Wu, filed a cross-complaint
against Cross-Defendants Helen Wang and Does 1-50 for apportionment of fault,
indemnification, motor vehicle, and general negligence. 
On
June 25, 2021, Plaintiff and Cross-Defendant Helen Wang filed an answer.  On
July 23, 2021, the Court dismissed the cross-complaint’s first cause of action
for indemnification without prejudice based on the parties’ stipulation. 
On
March 7, 2023, the Court dismissed Plaintiff Helen Wang’s complaint without
prejudice at her request. 
On
April 26, 2023, Cross-Complainants Chihling Wu and Jiaxin Nien filed a notice of
conditional settlement. 
On
April 27, 2023, the Court dismissed the “complaint of Chihling Wu against all
defendants” “as to only Cross-complaint of Chihling Wu” with prejudice. 
On October
9, 2023, Petitioner Chihling Wu (“Petitioner”) filed an amended petition for
expedited approval of a minor’s compromise. An expedited petition without a
hearing is permitted under California Rules of Court, rule 7.950.5, as long as
Petitioner uses the required Judicial Council forms and meets the following
conditions: 
1. Petitioner is represented
by an attorney.2. The claim is not for
wrongful death.3. Settlement proceeds will
not be placed in a trust.4. There are no unresolved
liens.5. Petitioner’s attorney did
not become involved at the request of Defendant or the insurance carrier.6. Petitioner’s attorney is not
employed by or associated with a Defendant or insurance carrier in connection
with the petition.7. If an action is filed, all
Defendants have appeared and are participating in the compromise OR the court
has determined that the settlement is in good faith.8. The settlement, exclusive of
interests and costs, is $50,000 or less OR if greater than $50,000, the amount
payable is the insurance policy limits AND all proposed contributing parties
would be substantially unable to use assets other than the insurance policy limits
AND the court does not otherwise order.  
SETTLEMENT:  $6,000.00
INJURIES:  pain to neck, back, shoulders, right arms and
knees
MEDICAL
EXPENSES:  $2,902.50
COSTS:  $0.00
ATTORNEY’S
FEES:  $1,597.50, which is 26.625% of the
gross settlement
BALANCE
OF PROCEEDS: $1,597.50 
DISCUSSION: 
Section
13 of the petition states that medical expenses total $6,630.00 and that this amount
was reduced by $2,353.20 as the result of negotiated, contractual, or statutory
reductions.  This leaves $4,276.80 in
medical expenses that must be either (a) reimbursed to the medical services
providers from the settlement proceeds or (b) waived by the medical services
providers.  However, the petition states
that only $2,902.50 is to be paid or reimbursed from the settlement proceeds.  As
a result, $1,374.30 of the medical expenses have not been accounted for. 
In
addition, Section 13a(5) of the Petition states that liens total $402.50.  Section
13f(2) of the petition, however, states that lienholders have agreed to accept
$2,902.50 in full satisfaction of lien claims. 
Petitioner should clarify these conflicting statements. 
Section
14a of the petition requests attorney’s fees of $1,597.50 but Section 17c of
the petition requests attorney’s fees of $1,500.00. Petitioner should clarify
the amount of attorney's fees sought. 
The
Court denies the petition without prejudice.
