And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Defendant Jose Alberto Martinez's motion for leave to file an amended answer. Martinez seeks to add the sudden emergency doctrine as an affirmative defense, which he claims was triggered by the stopping of traffic in front of his vehicle. The judge has considered the parties' arguments and has determined that it is in the furtherance of justice to grant the motion. The judge has also found that the opposition did not show that the proposed amendment would prejudice the plaintiff, and that the delay in filing the motion was not unreasonable. As a result, Martinez is ordered to file and serve the amended answer within 10 days of the hearing.
