And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion for summary adjudication filed by Shrader & Martinez Construction USA, LLC (formerly RRAM Services) and has summarily adjudicated the claim for express indemnity in the amended cross-complaint filed by Cross-Complainants 4755 Alla LP, Marpac Company, and MF One, LP.

The judge found that Cross-Complainants have failed to raise a triable issue of fact regarding their claim for express indemnity. The Master Service Agreement between RRAM Services and Tesla, Inc. dba Tesla Motors, Inc. contains an indemnification provision that limits indemnification to "Tesla, its affiliates and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives." The judge concluded that Cross-Complainants are not entitled to indemnification under this provision because they are not Tesla's affiliates or representatives.

The judge also found that Cross-Complainants have failed to raise a triable issue of fact regarding whether Marpac is an "affiliate" of Tesla. The Master Service Agreement does not define "affiliate" and the judge found that a reasonable jury could not conclude that Cross-Complainants were intended to be "affiliates" of Tesla under the agreement.
