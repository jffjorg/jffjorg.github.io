And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This case involves a minor's compromise between Chihling Wu and Jiaxin Nien, the cross-complainants, and Helen Wang, the cross-defendant. The parties have agreed to a settlement of $6,000.00. The petition for expedited approval of the minor's compromise states that medical expenses total $6,630.00, but this amount has been reduced by $2,353.20. The petition also states that liens total $402.50, but lienholders have agreed to accept $2,902.50 in full satisfaction of their claims. The petition requests attorney's fees of $1,597.50, but this amount is inconsistent with the amount requested in another section of the petition.

Due to the conflicting statements and inconsistencies in the petition, the court denies the petition without prejudice. The court requests that the parties clarify the amount of medical expenses and liens, and the amount of attorney's fees sought.
