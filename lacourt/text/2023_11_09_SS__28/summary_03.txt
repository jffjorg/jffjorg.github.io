And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the moving papers and rules as follows. The plaintiff, Abby Ademe, filed a complaint against defendants John Yu, Uber Technologies, Inc., and others for motor vehicle tort, general negligence, intentional tort, products liability, premises liability, and emotional distress. The defendants, including Yu, have filed various motions, including a demurrer to the complaint.

The Court finds that the complaint states a cause of action for motor vehicle tort and negligence, as it alleges the elements of a negligence claim, including a legal duty of care, breach of that duty, and proximate cause resulting in injury.

However, the Court sustains the demurrer to the claims for intentional tort, products liability, and premises liability, as the complaint fails to plead facts that support these claims.

The Court also sustains the demurrer to the claim for emotional distress, as "emotional distress" is an element of potential damages, not a cause of action.

The Court overrules the demurrer to the claims for motor vehicle tort and negligence, and gives Yu 30 days to amend his demurrer to these claims. The moving party is ordered to give notice of this ruling and file proof of service with the Court within five days.
