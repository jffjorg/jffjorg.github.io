 Case Number:  21STCV30629    Hearing Date:   November 9, 2023    Dept:  28 Having
considered the moving papers, the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On
August 19, 2021, Plaintiff Everilda Ruano (“Plaintiff”) filed this action (case
number 21STCV30629) against Defendant Juan De La Cruz Gutierrez (“Defendant”) and
Does 1-100 for motor vehicle tort and negligence. 
On
October 19, 2021, Defendant filed an answer. 
On
February 2, 2023, Defendant’s counsel informed the Court that Defendant had
passed away. 
On
September 11, 2023, Defendant filed a motion to consolidate this case
(21STCV30629) and case number 21STCV34221 (Cardenas
v. Gutierrez et al.), to be heard on November 7, 2023.  Plaintiff has not filed an opposition. 
No
trial date is currently scheduled. 
PARTY’S REQUEST 
Defendant
requests that the Court consolidate this case (21STCV30629) with case number 21STCV34221. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
“When
actions involving a common question of law or fact are pending before the
court, it may order a joint hearing or trial of any or all the matters in issue
in the actions; it may order all the actions consolidated and it may make such
orders concerning proceedings therein as may tend to avoid unnecessary costs or
delay.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1048, subd.
(a).) 
Los
Angeles County Superior Court Local Rule 3.3(g) provides: “(1) Cases may not be
consolidated unless they are in the same department. A motion to consolidate
two or more cases may be noticed and heard after the cases, initially filed in
different departments, have been related into a single department, or if the
cases were already assigned to that department. (2) Upon consolidation of
cases, the first filed case will be the lead case, unless otherwise ordered by
the court. After consolidation, all future papers to be filed in the
consolidated case must be filed only in the case designated as the lead case.
(3) Before consolidation of a limited case with an unlimited case, the limited
case must be reclassified as an unlimited case and the reclassification fee paid.” 
DISCUSSION 
Although
Defendant purportedly filed this motion to consolidate, Defendant’s counsel has
informed the Court that Defendant is deceased. 
Plaintiff has not filed an amendment naming a new defendant. 
In
addition, the Court has not yet ruled on the request to relate this
case and case number 21STCV34221.  The
Court cannot consolidate cases unless they have previously been related. 
The
Court continues the hearing to address these issues. 
CONCLUSION 
The court
CONTINUES the motion to consolidate to November 20, 2023, at 1:30 p.m. in
Department 28 of the Spring Street Courthouse. 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
