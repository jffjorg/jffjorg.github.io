BACKGROUND
 
Plaintiffs Claudia Calderon and Carlos Arajo
(“Plaintiffs”) allege they entered into a month-to-month tenancy with Defendant
14600 Saticoy Street LLC (“14600 Saticoy”) through
its agent Defendant Anza Management Company (“Anza”) (collectively,
“Defendants”). Plaintiffs further allege during Plaintiffs’ tenancy at the
Subject Property, and Defendants’ ownership, management and/or operations of
the Subject Property, the building is and has been unsafe, untenantable, in a
serious state of disrepair, and in gross violation of building, health, and
safety codes.
 
On February 8, 2022, Plaintiffs filed a
complaint against Defendants for (1) Contractual and Tortious Breach of Implied
Warranty of Habitability; (2) Violation of Cal. Civ. Code §§ 1941, 1941.1
(Statutory Breach of The Implied Warranty of Habitability); 3. Contractual and
Tortious Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment; 4. Nuisance; 5. Negligence;
6. Violation of Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200 et seq. Unfair, Unlawful, and
Deceptive Business Practices; (7) Violation of Cal. Welf. & Inst. Code §
15610.30 (Financial Abuse of Elders and Disabled Persons); and (8) Negligent
Hiring, Training and Supervision. 
 
On January 5, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a First
Amended Complaint adding several new causes of action.
 
On September 20, 2024, the Court continued the
trial date from October 7, 2024 to January 27, 2025. Pre-trial deadlines were
not continued and remained based on the previous trial date. (Minute Order
9/20/24.)
 
On November 6, 2024, Plaintiffs filed the
instant motion to compel the deposition of 14600 Saticoy's Person Most
Knowledgeable (“PMK”) pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 2055.010 and
2025.450, on the grounds there is good cause to compel compliance. Plaintiffs
request $2,810.00 in monetary sanctions.
 
On December 6, 2024, Defendants filed an
opposition, arguing that the motion is untimely under Code of Civil Procedure
section 2024.020. Defendants request $1,062.50, in sanctions.
 
As of December 17, 2024, no reply was filed. Any
reply must have been filed no later than five court days before the hearing.
(CCP § 1005(b).)
 
On December 17, 2024, the Court heard
Plaintiffs’ motion to compel the deposition of Anza’s PMK. 
 
[Tentative] Ruling
 
1.  Plaintiffs’ Motion to Compel the Deposition
of 14600 Saticoy’s Person Most Knowledgeable is DENIED.
2.      Plaintiffs’ request for monetary sanctions is
DENIED.
3.      Defendants’ request for monetary sanctions is
DENIED.      
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
“If, after service of a deposition notice, a
party to the action or an officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a
party, or a person designated by an organization that is a party under Section
2025.230, without having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails
to appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for inspection
any document . . . described in the deposition notice, the party giving the
notice may move for an order compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony,
and the production for inspection of any document . . . described in the
deposition notice.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (a).)
 
“A motion under subdivision (a) [above] shall
comply with both of the following:
 
1. The motion shall set forth
specific facts showing good cause justifying the production for inspection of
any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in
the deposition notice.
 
2. The motion shall be accompanied by
a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040, or, when the deponent
fails to attend the deposition and produce the documents, electronically stored
information, or things described in the deposition notice, by a declaration
stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire about the
nonappearance.”
 
(Code Civ. Proc., §
2025.450, subd. (b).)
 
If a motion is granted, the court shall
impose a monetary sanction in favor of that party unless the court finds that
the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that
other circumstances make the sanction unjust. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2025.450 (g). 
 
MEET AND CONFER
 
The Declaration of Johnathan Nielsen,
Plaintiffs’ counsel, describes a meet and confer effort that took place to
determine if Defendants would produce the PMK for a deposition. (Nielsen Decl.
¶ 4, 6; Exhibits 3, 5.) Thus, Plaintiffs sufficiently attempted to meet and
confer with 14600 Saticoy. 
 
DISCUSSION
 
Request for Judicial Notice 
 
The request for judicial notice is granted.  
 
Motion to Compel Deposition
 
Plaintiffs seek an order compelling the appearance of 14600
Saticoy’s PMK for a deposition. The motion is made pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure Sections 2055.010 and 2025.450, on the grounds there is good cause to
compel compliance. Plaintiffs argue that they timely provided required notice
of the deposition and 14600 Saticoy’s counsel refused to produce the PMK for
deposition.
 
In support, Plaintiffs provide the declaration of counsel
Johnathan Nielsen. Attorney Neilsen declares that Plaintiffs properly noticed
the September 6, 2024, deposition by email on August 16, 2024, prior to the
discovery cutoff on September 9, 2024. (Nielsen Decl. ¶ 2, Exhibit 1.) However,
as a courtesy, Plaintiffs agreed not to go forward with the deposition on
September 6, 2024, if alternative available dates were provided. Defendants objected
to the deposition on August 30, 2024. (Nielsen Decl. ¶¶ 3-4, Exhibits 2, 3.) On
September 3, 2024, Defendants’ counsel replied that “alternative dates will be
provided.” (Nielsen Decl. ¶ 5, Exhibit 4.) Nielsen then responded:
 
“Due to discovery cut-off, I need
confirmation that you are waiving the discovery cut-off date for the purpose of
taking the depositions we noticed. If I don't have alternative dates and
confirmation of waiving discovery cut-off by 10:00 a.m. on Thursday September
5th, I will have to go forward with the deposition on September 6th to protect
our clients' rights.”
 
(Nielsen Decl. ¶ 6, Exhibit 5.)
 
Defendants’ counsel, Laura Adler, replied to the above email
that the deposition would not proceed on September 6th and requested a 90–120-day
trial continuance because attorney Ronald Whitaker was no longer with the
company and they were unable to proceed as staffed. (Nielsen Decl. ¶ 7, Exhibit
6.) Plaintiffs do not indicate that they responded to the email.
 
On October 2, 2024, Plaintiffs’ counsel sent a meet and
confer letter via email to Michael Raichelson, Counsel for Court-Appointed
Receiver of Defendants. (Nielsen Decl. ¶ 8, Exhibit 7.) Mr. Raichelson
responded that this Court ordered for discovery deadlines to be controlled by
the prior trial date. (Nielsen Decl. ¶ 10, Exhibit 9.) Plaintiffs’ counsel
responded that they properly noticed the deposition prior to the discovery
cutoff. (Nielsen Decl. ¶ 11, Exhibit 10.)
 
In opposition, Defendants argue that the instant motion is
untimely because the deadline to complete depositions of percipient witnesses
was September 9, 2024, and the corresponding deadline to hear a motion to
compel was September 23, 2024. Defendants claim that there was no agreement to
extend the discovery cutoff dates. (Opposition at p. 5.) Defendants assert that
although the Court continued the trial from October 7, 2024 to January 27,
2025, the discovery deadlines were not continued. (Minute Order 9/20/24.)
Defendants also point out that Plaintiffs did not raise this issue during the
hearing on September 20, 2024. (Opposition at p. 2.) Further, Plaintiffs stated
in their opposition to Defendants’ ex parte application to continue trial that
“Discovery and Expert Discovery are cut-off”. (Page 3, line 17 of Plaintiffs’
Opposition dated September 19, 2024).
 
Defendants further argue that Plaintiffs motion to compel is
improper because discovery has closed and Plaintiffs have made no effort to
reopen discovery before filing the instant motion, citing Pelton-Shepherd
Indus., Inc. v. Delta Packaging Prod., Inc., (2008) 165 Cal. App. 4th 1568,
1585. The Court agrees.
 
Any party shall be entitled as a matter of right to complete
discovery proceedings on or before the 30th day, and to have motions concerning
discovery heard before the 15th day, before the date initially set for the
trial of the action. (Code Civ. Proc.§ 2024.020 (a).) Here, the discovery
motion cut-off in this case is closed. The discovery cut-offs are associated
with the previous trial date, October 7, 2024. (Minute Order 9/20/24.)
Therefore, the last day to hear a discovery motion was September 23, 2024.
Since the motions to compel depositions are being heard on December 17, 2024,
they are untimely.
 
The Court cannot grant discovery motions after the cutoff
date unless the moving party has moved under Code of Civil Procedure section
2024.050 to have the motions heard closer to the trial date. (Pelton-Shepherd
Industries, Inc. v. Delta Packaging Products, Inc. (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th
1568, 1586-1587.) The Court’s discretion in allowing the motions to be heard
closer to the trial date than allowed by Code of Civil Procedure section
2024.020 is bounded by the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 2024.050,
which include the trial court’s consideration of the statutory factors. (Id.
at p. 1586-1587.) Here, Plaintiffs have not sought leave under Code of Civil
Procedure section 2024.050 to reopen discovery, nor have they discussed the
statutory factors of section 2024.050.
 
Therefore, Plaintiffs’ motion to compel the deposition of
14600 Saticoy’s PMK is denied.
 
Monetary Sanctions
 
Plaintiffs request monetary sanctions against Defendant 14600
Saticoy and its Counsel in the sum of $2,810.00 pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 2025.450(g). However, the Court has denied Plaintiffs motion
to compel, and therefore section 2025.450(g) does not apply. Plaintiffs also
argue that Defendants have refused to produce their PMK or provide alternative
dates for their PMK’s deposition, despite Plaintiffs’ Counsel’s numerous
attempts to accommodate 14600 Saticoy and their PMK’s schedule.
 
Defendants request monetary sanctions against Plaintiffs and
their Counsel in the sum of $1,062.50. Defendants argue that Plaintiffs’ act of
filing the motion to compel after the motion hearing deadline is an abuse of
the discovery process.
 
This is a text-book example of lawyers failing to cooperate
in the discovery process. Both sides are guilty, in different ways, for this
behavior. As Plaintiffs point out, Defendants did not provide alternative dates
for the deposition after indicating that alternative dates would be provided.
Also, Plaintiffs’ counsel made numerous attempts to accommodate Defendants’
schedule as a courtesy. On the other hand, Plaintiffs do not address why they
did not respond to Defense counsel Laura Adler’s email on September 3, 2024
regarding trial continuance; why they did not bring up this issue during the
hearing on September 20, 2024; why they stated in their opposition to the
motion to continue trial that discovery was closed; and why they waited until
November 6th to bring the instant motion.
 
Both parties’ requests for sanctions are denied as both
parties’ positions were substantially justified, in light of the other parties’
intransigence.
 
CONCLUSION
 
Plaintiffs’ Motion to Compel the Deposition
of 14600 Saticoy’s Person Most Knowledgeable is DENIED.
 
Plaintiffs’ request for monetary sanctions is
DENIED.
 
Defendants’ request for monetary sanctions is
DENIED.
