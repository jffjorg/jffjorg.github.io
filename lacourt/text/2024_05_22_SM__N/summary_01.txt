And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment and in the alternative Summary Adjudication is continued. The reason for this is that the separate statement supporting the motion is deficient. According to California Rules of Court 3.1350(d), a separate statement must identify each cause of action, claim for damages, issue of duty, or affirmative defense that is the subject of the motion. However, the separate statement provided by Counsel lacks this identification. As a result, the Court will continue the hearing on the motion and the trial date where required.
