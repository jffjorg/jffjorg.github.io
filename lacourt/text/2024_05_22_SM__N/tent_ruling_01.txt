  Case Number:  21SMCV01129    Hearing Date:   May 22, 2024    Dept:  N Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment and in the alternative Summary Adjudication is CONTINUED:The separate statement supporting the motion is deficient. Specifically, CRC 3.1350(d) states that a separate statement must identify each cause of action, claim for damages, issue of duty, or affirmative defense that is the subject of the motion. Counsel provides a narrative in the separate statement using headings about the general nature of the facts that follow the heading. There is no identification of causes of action or issue (statute of limitations, laches, waiver, standing) in the separate statement.  Based on the foregoing, the Court will continue the hearing on the motion and trial date where required.
