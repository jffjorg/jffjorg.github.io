I.           
INTRODUCTION 
On May 8,
2023, Plaintiff Odette Vivanco (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against
Defendants Ottimo Resources Inc., Pacific Clinics, and Does 1 to 10 alleging
causes of action for: (1) retaliation in violation of California Labor Code,
Section 1102.5; (2) retaliation in violation of California Labor Code,
Section 6310; (3) wrongful termination in violation of public policy; and (4)
breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.  
On July 31,
2023, Defendant Pacific Clinics (“Moving Defendant”) filed and served a
demurrer to the first, second, third, and fourth causes of action in the
complaint. Moving Defendant also filed and served a motion to strike punitive
damages allegations from the complaint and prayer for relief therein. The Court
will address both motions in this one ruling. 
II.         
MEET AND CONFER
The Court finds that the meet and
confer requirement has been met as to the demurer and motion to strike pursuant
to California Code of Civil Procedure, Sections 430.41 and 435.5. 
III.       
JUDICIAL NOTICE 
The Court GRANTS Moving Defendant’s
request for judicial notice in support of its demurrer and motion to strike
pursuant to California Evidence Code, Sections 452 and 453. 
IV.        
DEMURRER 
“A
demurrer tests the sufficiency of a complaint as a matter of law.”  (Durell v. Sharp Healthcare (2010) 183
Cal.App.4th 1350, 1358.) “[T]he court gives the complaint a reasonable
interpretation, and treats the demurrer as admitting all material facts
properly pleaded.”  (Ibid.)  In testing the sufficiency of the complaint,
the court must assume the truth of: (1) the properly pleaded factual
allegations; (2) facts that can be reasonably inferred from those expressly
pleaded; and (3) judicially noticed matters. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39
Cal.3d 311, 318.) A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or
other extrinsic matters. (SKF Farms v. Superior Court (1984) 153 Cal.
App. 3d 902, 905.) Accordingly, “[w]hether the plaintiff will be able to prove
the pleaded facts is irrelevant to ruling upon the demurrer.” (Stevens v.
Superior Court (1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 605, 609-10.) 
A
general demurrer may be taken to a complaint where “[t]he pleading does not
state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.” (Code Civ. Proc. §
430.10(e).) Although courts construe pleadings liberally, sufficient facts must
be alleged to support the allegations plead to survive a demurrer. (Rakestraw
v. California Physicians' Serv. (2000) 81 Cal. App. 4th 39, 43.) “Because a
demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of a complaint, the plaintiff must show
the complaint alleges facts sufficient to establish every element of each cause
of action.” (Ibid.) 
Where
a demurrer is sustained, leave to amend must be allowed where there is a
reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman
v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.) The burden is on the plaintiff
to show the court that a pleading can be amended successfully. (Ibid.)
However, “[i]f there is any reasonable possibility that the plaintiff can state
a good cause of action, it is error to sustain a demurrer without leave to
amend.” (Youngman v. Nevada Irrigation Dist. (1969) 70 Cal.2d 240, 245).

Issue No.1: First
Cause of Action
          Moving
Defendant contends that the first cause of action in the complaint fails
because there is no protected activity alleged in the complaint and there is no
causal link between Plaintiff’s non-protected activity of notifying Moving
Defendant of the need for additional toys and her termination. Plaintiff
contends that her retaliation claims are adequately pled. 
          To
state a cause of action for violation of Lab. Code § 1102.5, “a plaintiff must
show (1) she engaged in protected activity, (2) her employer subjected her to
an adverse employment action, and (3) there is a causal link between the two.”
(Mokler v. County of Orange (2007) 157 Cal.App.4th 121, 138.) “[T]emporal
proximity, by itself, may be sufficient to establish a prima face claim . . .
of retaliation.” (Artega v. Brink’s, Inc. (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 327,
334.) 
To
state a cause of action under Lab. Code § 1102.5, a complaint must allege that
there was disclosure of a violation of a statute, regulation or rule. (Patten
v. Grant Joint Union High Dist. (2005) 134 Cal.App.4th 1378, 1388.)  “An employee engages in activity protected by
[Labor Code section 1102.5] when the employee discloses reasonably based suspicions
of illegal activity.” (Ross v. County of Riverside (2019) 36 Cal.App.5th
580, 592.) “To have a reasonably based suspicion of illegal activity, the
employee must be able to point to some legal foundation for his suspicion—some statute,
rule or regulation which may have been violated by the conduct he disclosed.” (Ibid.)
Generally, statutory causes of action must be pleaded with particularity. (Perez
v. Golden Empire Transit Dist. (2012) 209 Cal.App.4th 1228, 1237, fn.3.) 
          Initially,
the Court finds that Plaintiff’s citations to Casella v. Dealer Services,
Inc. (2007) 157 Cal.App.4th 1127 and Franklin v. Monadnock Co.
(2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 252 are inapposite as such cases did not assess the
sufficiency of a claim under California Labor Code, Section 1102.5. Moreover,
Plaintiff’s citation to Gonzales v. City of Long Beach (May 12, 2016,
B249060) is violative of California Rules of Court, Rule 8.1115, which
restricts citations to unpublished opinions. 
Here,
the complaint alleges that Plaintiff notified Defendants that an adequate
supply of toys was needed for waiting areas and therapy rooms. (Complaint, ¶¶
19-23.) The complaint alleges that in February 2023, a child at one of Moving
Defendant’s facilities caused a dangerous safety incident when the child
inserted an object into an electrical outlet, which started a small fire. (Id.,
¶ 21.) Plaintiff alleges that she was fired shortly after exchanging emails “about
the lack of toys and supplies for the children clients and how that contributed
to the safety incident at the facility.” (Id., ¶¶ 22-23.) 
          The
Court finds that Plaintiff has not stated a sufficient cause of action for
violation of Lab. Code § 1102.5. The first cause of action does not allege that
Plaintiff reported a violation of a statute, regulation, or rule. (Complaint,
¶¶ 29-32.) Thus, Plaintiff has not alleged any protected activity. Plaintiff
merely disclosed the lack of an adequate supply of toys in waiting areas and
therapy rooms. The complaint does not allege that the lack of an adequate
supply of toys is a violation of a rule, regulation, or statute. Moreover, the
first cause of action is set forth in a conclusory manner and is not set forth
with particularity. 
          Therefore,
the Court SUSTAINS the demurer of Moving Defendant to the first cause of action
in the complaint with 20 days leave to amend.
Issue No.2: Second
Cause of Action
          Lab.
Code § 6310(b) provides that an employee cannot be retaliated against for
making a “bona fide oral or written complaint . . . to their employer . . . of
unsafe working conditions.” A cause of action under Lab. Code § 6310 requires a
plaintiff to show that “(1) she engaged in protected activity, (2) her employer
subjected her to an adverse employment action, and (3) a causal link between
the two.” (St. Myers v. Dignity Health (2019) 44 Cal.App.5th 301, 314.)
A cause of action under Lab. Code § 6310 has similar requirements to a cause of
action under Lab. Code § 1102.5. 
          Moving
Defendant raises the same arguments as to the insufficiency of the second cause
of action that were raised as to the first cause of action. The Court
references its analysis as the first cause of action and incorporates it herein.
Plaintiff has failed to allege that she engaged in any protected activity.
Moreover, the second cause of action is set forth in a conclusory manner.
(Complaint, ¶¶ 34-37.) The second cause of action is insufficient in its
current form. 
          The
Court therefore SUSTAINS the demurrer of Moving Defendant to the second cause
of action in the complaint with 20 days leave to amend. 
 
 
Issue No.3: Third
Cause of Action
          Moving
Defendant contends that the third cause of action for wrongful termination in
violation of public policy fails because no protected activity or causation has
been alleged. Plaintiff asserts that she has adequately stated a claim for
wrongful termination in violation of public policy. The opposition argues that
because her first and second causes of action are sufficient, it follows that
the third cause of action is sufficient. (Opposition at 6:17-24.) 
          “[W]hen
an employer’s discharge of an employee violates fundamental principles of
public policy, the discharged employee may maintain a tort action and recover
damages traditionally available in such actions.” (Mendoza v. Western
Medical Center Santa Ana (2014) 222 Cal.App.4th 1334, 1338.) To state a
cause of action for wrongful termination in violation of public policy, a
plaintiff must allege the following: (1) the plaintiff was employed by the
defendant; (2) the defendant discharged the plaintiff from employment; (3) the
alleged violation of public policy was the motivating reason for plaintiff’s
discharge; (4) the plaintiff was harmed; and (5) the discharge was a
substantial factor in causing plaintiff harm. (CACI 2430.) 
          Here,
the Court finds that the third cause of action is insufficiently alleged as
Plaintiff does not allege that: (1) the alleged violation of public policy was
a motivating reason for Plaintiff’s discharge; and (2) the discharge was a
substantial factor in Plaintiff’s harm. (Complaint, ¶¶ 39-41.) 
          Therefore,
the demurrer of Moving Defendant to the third cause of action in the complaint
is SUSTAINED with 20 days leave to amend. 
Issue No.4: Fourth
Cause of Action 
          “There
is an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in every contract that
neither party will do anything which will injure the right of the other to
receive the benefits of the agreement.” (Foley v. Interactive Data Corp. (1988)
47 Cal.3d 654, 684.) “[T]ort remedies are not available for breach of the
implied covenant in an employment contract to employees who allege they have
been wrongfully discharged in violation of the covenant.” (Id. at p.
700.) 
          Here,
the Court finds that under Foley v. Interactive Data Corp., supra,
47 Cal.3d 654, Plaintiff’s claim for breach of the implied covenant of good
faith and fair dealing fails. Such a claim is not available in the employment
context where wrongful termination is alleged. Here, Plaintiff’s wrongful
termination is the basis for her claim for breach of the implied covenant of
good faith and fair dealing. (Complaint, ¶¶ 43-48.)  
Therefore,
the Court SUSTAINS the demurer of Moving Defendant to the fourth cause of
action in the complaint WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND.       
V.          
MOTION TO STRIKE
Moving Defendant seeks to strike punitive
damages allegations from the complaint and prayer for relief therein. Due to
the Court sustaining the demurrer to each cause of action in the complaint, the
Court GRANTS Moving Defendant’s motion to strike with 20 days leave to amend. 
VI.     CONCLUSION
          The Court
SUSTAINS the demurrer of Moving Defendant to the first, second, and third
causes of action in the complaint with 20 days leave to amend. 
          The Court
SUSTAINS WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND the demurrer of Moving Defendant to the fourth
cause of action in the complaint. 
          The Court
GRANTS Moving Defendant’s motion to strike with 20 days leave to amend. 
Moving party is ordered to give
notice.
