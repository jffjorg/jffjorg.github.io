And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses the demurrer and motion to strike filed by Defendant Pacific Clinics against Plaintiff Odette Vivanco's complaint. The complaint alleges four causes of action: retaliation in violation of California Labor Code, Section 1102.5; retaliation in violation of California Labor Code, Section 6310; wrongful termination in violation of public policy; and breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.

The judge sustains the demurrer to the first, second, and third causes of action, dismissing them with 20 days leave to amend. The judge also sustains the demurrer to the fourth cause of action without leave to amend.

The judge grants the motion to strike punitive damages allegations from the complaint and prayer for relief therein.

The judge's ruling is based on the following analysis:

* The first cause of action fails to allege protected activity under Labor Code, Section 1102.5.
* The second cause of action fails to allege protected activity under Labor Code, Section 6310.
* The third cause of action fails to allege a causal link between the alleged violation of public policy and the plaintiff's discharge.
* The fourth cause of action is barred by Foley v. Interactive Data Corp., which holds that tort remedies are not available for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in an employment contract.

The judge's tentative ruling sets forth the reasoning and analysis for the dismissal of the causes of action and the granting of the motion to strike.
