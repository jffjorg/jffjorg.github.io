And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling denies, without prejudice, the defendant's motion for summary adjudication on the grounds that there is no amended complaint on file in this action. The plaintiff originally filed a complaint alleging causes of action for products liability and general negligence, but later filed a motion to amend the complaint to include a prayer for punitive damages. However, the court file indicates that the court never granted the motion to amend, and the plaintiff never filed an amended complaint. Therefore, the defendant's motion for summary adjudication is directed at a non-existent pleading and is improper.
