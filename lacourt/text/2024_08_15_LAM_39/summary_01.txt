And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the motion for summary judgment or, in the alternative, summary adjudication filed by the defendants, Sterling Jewelers, Inc. and Signet Jewelers Limited, and has denied the motion.

The judge has found that the defendants have met their burden to show that the plaintiff, Jessica Parker, cannot prevail on her cause of action for discrimination. However, the judge has also found that the plaintiff has raised triable issues of material fact as to whether she can prevail on her cause of action for discrimination.

The judge has also found that the defendants are not liable for the alleged harassment by Josh Alvarez, one of the plaintiff's coworkers, because Alvarez was not a supervisor. However, the judge has noted that the plaintiff has raised triable issues of fact as to whether Alvarez worked in a supervisory role and whether the defendants knew or should have known of his harassment.

The judge has denied the defendants' motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication on the plaintiff's third cause of action for retaliation, finding that the plaintiff has raised triable issues of material fact as to whether the defendants retaliated against her for reporting discrimination and harassment.

The judge has also denied the defendants' motion on the plaintiff's fifth and sixth causes of action for retaliation under Labor Code sections 1102.5 and 6310, finding that the plaintiff has raised triable issues of material fact as to whether the defendants retaliated against her for reporting workplace safety and health concerns.

Overall, the judge has found that there are triable issues of material fact in this case and has denied the defendants' motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication.
