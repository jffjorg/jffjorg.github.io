And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses various issues related to a case involving the misappropriation of funds from Shangri-La by a former executive, Holmes. The case was previously dismissed without prejudice on April 26, 2024. The petitioners, Medalist, Fairview, and PPRF, have prepared a supplemental chart to illustrate common legal issues among the cases, but the exhibit A attached to the sur-reply is blank. The judge notes that the case seeks to hold Holmes liable for the misappropriations.

The judge also addresses the issue of coordination of the cases, noting that BMO Bank N.A. has stated that its initial judicial foreclosure claims are now moot and that the case no longer implicates Homekey properties. Additionally, Northstar has stated that the lenders have agreed to the Attorney General's proposed use restrictions on the Homekey properties.

The judge rejects the petitioners' argument that bankruptcy stays would create common issues among the parties, stating that bankruptcy stays are standard and only pause litigation as to particular parties, not create common issues. The judge also notes that the factual and legal issues in the case are more individualized due to unique properties, loans, and contracts.

Finally, the judge suggests that Shangri-La remains free to try to relate or consolidate the cases so that the Monterey cases are heard in one courtroom in Monterey and the San Bernardino cases are heard in one courtroom in San Bernardino. The judge will seek confirmation of the representation that the lenders have agreed to the use restrictions on the Homekey properties at the hearing.
