And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the request for default judgment submitted by Sheena Pahoyo Hernandez against Shlomo Keshet. The reasons for the denial are due to a number of defects in the plaintiff's submission. Specifically, the plaintiff failed to state the name of the defendant against whom judgment is to be entered, did not checkmark "Damages" on the relevant form, and failed to dismiss all other parties against whom judgment is not being sought. Additionally, the plaintiff's declaration in support of the application for default judgment was not signed under penalty of perjury, and the evidence submitted to support the claim for damages was not authenticated and admissible. The judge has ordered the plaintiff to submit a new default judgment package correcting these defects, and failure to do so may result in the imposition of sanctions, including monetary sanctions and/or dismissal. The OSC re entry of default judgment is continued.
