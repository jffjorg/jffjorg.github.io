And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling denies Lyft's motion for a protective order to avoid the deposition of its Person Most Qualified (PMQ) without prejudice. The court finds that Lyft has not demonstrated good cause for the deposition to not be taken at all, and that the parties have not reasonably met and conferred in good faith prior to bringing the motion. The court orders the parties to further meet and confer to resolve the outstanding issues, and to submit a joint statement identifying the specific categories in dispute. If the parties are unable to resolve the issues, they are ordered to participate in an Informal Discovery Conference (IDC) to resolve the disputes.
