**English Text Summary:**

In this case, Plaintiffs Victoria Brianna Plancarte and Natalie Priscilla Barr are suing Lyft, Inc. and two drivers involved in a car accident that injured them. Lyft has filed a motion to prevent the deposition of their Person Most Qualified (PMQ), arguing that it's unnecessary because they have a $1 million insurance policy to cover any damages. Plaintiffs argue that the deposition is necessary to gather information about Lyft's driver selection, supervision, and control practices, particularly regarding the driver involved in the accident. 

The judge denied Lyft's motion for a protective order because they found that Lyft hadn't sufficiently met and conferred with Plaintiffs to try to resolve the dispute regarding the scope of the deposition. The judge ordered both parties to continue meeting and confer to try to narrow the issues. If they can't reach an agreement, they must attend an informal discovery conference to further discuss the disputed deposition topics.

The judge finds that Lyft has not demonstrated good cause for its PMQ's deposition to not be taken at all, as Lyft's $1 million automobile insurance policy is irrelevant. The judge also finds that the parties have not reasonably met and conferred in good faith prior to bringing the instant motion. Therefore, the motion is denied without prejudice. The parties are ordered to further meet and confer to resolve the outstanding issues. If the parties cannot reach an agreement, they must submit a joint statement identifying the specific categories in dispute and clearly state all objections to each category.
