And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on Plaintiff Lettrice Lawrence's motion to compel Defendant David Cotton to respond to outstanding discovery requests. The judge finds that Defendant Cotton was properly served with the discovery requests and failed to respond, and therefore grants Plaintiff's motion. The judge orders Defendant Cotton to serve verified responses to the discovery requests within 20 days.

The judge also denies Plaintiff's request for sanctions in the amount of $1,260, as the request did not comply with the requirements of the California Code of Civil Procedure.

The judge notes that Defendant Cotton's current counsel claims to have lost contact with Defendant Cotton due to his homelessness, but finds that this does not excuse Defendant Cotton's failure to respond to the discovery requests.

Finally, the judge orders Plaintiff to pay two additional filing fees for combining the discovery motions into a single motion.
