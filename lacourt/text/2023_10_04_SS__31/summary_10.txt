And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling concerns a motion to compel discovery responses from Defendant David Cotton, ET AL. The Plaintiff, Lettrice Lawrence, propounded discovery requests on April 24, 2023, but Defendant Cotton failed to respond. The Plaintiff seeks to compel Defendant Cotton to respond without objections and to pay sanctions. The Judge notes that Defendant Cotton's counsel claims they have been unsuccessful in establishing contact with Defendant Cotton due to his homelessness, but this does not excuse the failure to respond.

The Judge finds that the Plaintiff has shown that they properly served the discovery requests, that the time to respond has expired, and that Defendant Cotton failed to provide a timely response. The Judge therefore grants the motion to compel and orders Defendant Cotton to serve verified responses to the discovery requests within 20 days.

The Judge also denies the Plaintiff's request for sanctions in the amount of $1,260, as the Notice of Motion did not specifically identify the rule that was violated. The Judge notes that the Plaintiff should have filed three separate motions for the discovery requests, and orders the Plaintiff to pay two additional filing fees.

The tentative ruling will only be final upon proof of payment of the filing fees, and the parties are encouraged to meet and confer to reach an agreement. If a party intends to submit to the tentative ruling, they must send an email to the court with the subject line "SUBMIT" followed by the case number.
