## English Summary:

Judge Michelle C. Kim issued a tentative ruling denying Defendant Ethan Sweet's motion for leave to file a motion to strike punitive damages from Plaintiffs' complaint.

The Judge found that Defendant's request was untimely, as the deadline to file a motion to strike had already passed. While Defendant's counsel argued that they were unaware of the punitive damages claim due to being on vacation, the Judge ruled that this was not excusable neglect and did not meet the standard of reasonable diligence expected of legal professionals. 

The Judge also noted that Defendant had other avenues to address the punitive damages claim, such as a motion for summary judgment, and wouldn't be significantly prejudiced by not being allowed to strike the claim at this stage.

The Court finds that Defendant's counsel was not excusable in their failure to review the Complaint and notice the pleading of punitive damages, and that Defendant has other means of countering the Plaintiffs' request for punitive damages, such as a motion for summary judgment. The Court declines to exercise its discretion to contravene the time limitation set by statute and denies the motion.
