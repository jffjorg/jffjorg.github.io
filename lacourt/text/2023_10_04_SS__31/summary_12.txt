And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge, Hon. Michelle C. Kim, has made a tentative ruling denying the motion filed by Defendant Ethan Sweet to leave to file a motion to strike portions of the Plaintiff's Complaint referring to punitive damages. The motion was filed after the time allowed to respond to the pleading, and the Judge finds that the defense counsel's neglect in not reviewing the Complaint before filing an Answer was not excusable. The Judge also notes that the Defendant has other means of countering the Plaintiff's request for punitive damages, such as filing a motion for summary judgment. The Judge declines to exercise discretion to contravene the time limitation set by statute and denies the motion.
