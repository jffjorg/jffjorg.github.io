## English Summary

The tentative ruling in this case deals with Plaintiff Demetrio Montanez's request to amend his complaint for a second time. Montanez originally sued the Los Angeles Unified School District and the County of Los Angeles after being injured by a falling gate. He later dismissed the County of Los Angeles and amended the complaint to name two new defendants: A-1 Fencing and Turner Construction. This latest attempt to amend his complaint was rejected because it did not fully comply with court rules regarding formatting and explanation of the changes. As a result, the judge denied the motion without prejudice, meaning Montanez can re-file it with the necessary corrections.

The Plaintiff seeks to add causes of action applicable to private entities, as the current complaint only contains allegations relevant to public property.

Additionally, the Plaintiff's declaration does not provide adequate reasons for the delay in filing the request for amendment. As a result, the judge denies the Plaintiff's motion without prejudice. The Plaintiff is ordered to give notice of the denial.

Summary in English:
This tentative ruling is for a case titled "Demetrio Montanez vs. Los Angeles Unified School District, et al." in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Los Angeles - Central District. The plaintiff, Demetrio Montanez, filed this action against the Los Angeles Unified School District and County of Los Angeles after being injured when a gate fell on him.
