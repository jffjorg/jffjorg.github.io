 Case Number:  22STCV10978    Hearing Date:   October 4, 2023    Dept:  31 DEPT:  31 HEARING DATE: 10/04/2023 CASE NAME/NUMBER: 22STCV10978 VIVIAN MENDOZA, et al. vs SARAH LISTYO, et al. PETITION TO APPROVE COMPROMISE OF PENDING ACTION OF A MINOR Lilv Mendoza, Age 12; and Vivian Mendoza, Age 9. RECOMMENDATION: DENY  TENTATIVE¿ ¿ Plaintiffs have agreed to settle their claims against Defendants, with $63,836.66 being apportioned to Claimant Lily Mendoza (“Lily”) and $28,666.66 being apportioned to Claimant Vivian Mendoza (“Vivian”).   If the settlement is approved for Claimant Lily, $4,462.54 will be used for medical expenses, $15,959.17 for attorneys’ fees, and $410.91 will be used for costs.  The net balance of $43,0004.04 will be deposited into a blocked account.   If the settlement is approved for Claimant Vivian, $10,253.91 will be used for medical expenses, $7,166.67 for attorneys’ fees, and $256.21 will be used for costs.  The net balance of $10,989.87 will be deposited into a blocked account.   The Court has reviewed the petitions submitted on July 17, 2023, and denies both petitions. The petition for both Claimants suffer from the same defects, and therefore the following apply to both petitions:   MC-350 requests Petitioner to describe the treatment Claimants received. Referring generally to over a hundred pages of medical records, and inserting those numerous pages in between the Petition itself, not only does not fulfill the request, but also makes it difficult for the Court to review a cohesive petition when it is separated in such a manner. Petitioner must provide a brief statement of the treatments received and keep the pages of MC-350 together for the Court’s ease of review.   On MC-350, Petitioner checkmarks Items 3 and 4, indicating that the amount of $0 was paid by Medicare and Medi-Cal. If nothing was paid by Medicare or Medi-Cal, then Petitioner need not check these boxes. Otherwise, by checking these items, Petitioner must submit a Medicare demand letter or letter agreement as Attachment 12b(3).   On MC-350, Item 13, the expenses listed as “Records” three times and “Filing Fee” three times is unspecific. Petitioner must specify exactly what expense was incurred, such as by naming the type of record, and ensure that the requested fees are not duplicative between the two petitions. Again, Petitioner inserts the Attachments in between the Petition itself; this makes it difficult for the Court to evaluate the petition when done in such a manner. Petitioner is to keep all pages of MC-350 together, and place any and all Attachments at the end of the MC-350 form.   Lastly, Plaintiff’s counsels’ declaration in support of the attorneys’ fee requests do not comply with CRC 7.955(c). Counsel must review and address the factors listed in CRC 7.955(b).   Petitioner must cure the aforementioned defects and submit new petitions at Petitioner’s earliest convenience.  Moving party is ordered to give notice.
