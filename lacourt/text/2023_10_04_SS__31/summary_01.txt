And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge, Hon. Michelle C. Kim, has made a tentative ruling in the case 19STCV12152. The plaintiff, Ilan N. Rosen Janfaza, failed to respond to discovery requests from the defendants, Andres Gutierrez and Elizabeth Gutierrez, which were propounded on March 30, 2023. The defendants sent a correspondence to the plaintiff's counsel requesting responses by May 18, 2023, but the plaintiff did not respond. The defendants therefore filed a motion to compel discovery responses and request sanctions.

The Judge has granted the motion to compel discovery responses, ordering the plaintiff to serve verified responses to the discovery requests within 15 days. The Judge has also imposed sanctions on the plaintiff and the plaintiff's attorney, jointly and severally, in the amount of $380.34, which includes $320.34 in attorneys' fees and $60 in filing fees.

The Judge has given notice to the parties to meet and confer to see if they can reach an agreement. If a party intends to submit to the tentative ruling, they must send an email to the court with the subject line "SUBMIT" followed by the case number.
