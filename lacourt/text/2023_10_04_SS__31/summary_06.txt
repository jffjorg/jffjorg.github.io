Summary in English text:

The tentative ruling in this case, 22STCV02832, addresses a motion by Plaintiff's attorney, H. Dean Aynechi, to be relieved as counsel. Aynechi claims he has been unable to locate or contact Plaintiff, Peter Daniel Doss, despite his best efforts, including hiring a private investigator and serving moving papers on the plaintiff's last known address. The motion is CONDITIONALLY GRANTED if all parties agree to a trial continuance, but otherwise, it is denied without prejudice. The court also orders Aynechi to give notice and encourages parties to meet and confer to reach an agreement. If no agreement is reached, parties must submit the tentative ruling by email or appear remotely or in person for oral argument.
