## English Summary

This tentative ruling concerns a motion filed by H. Dean Aynechi, attorney for Plaintiff Peter Daniel Doss, to be relieved as counsel.  

Aynechi states he has been unable to locate or contact Doss despite his efforts, which included hiring a private investigator and conducting searches.  He declares he served Doss with the motion papers via mail at Doss's last known address, but has been unable to confirm the address or locate a more current one.  

The Judge acknowledges that attorneys don't have an absolute right to withdraw and must follow specific procedures outlined in CRPC 3.700. However, the Judge conditionally grants the motion, meaning Aynechi can withdraw if all parties agree to a continuance of the trial date. If no agreement is reached, the motion will be denied.  

The Judge encourages the parties to meet and discuss the matter before the hearing.
