The Plaintiff has moved the Court for an order compelling Defendant Cevi Med to provide further responses to form interrogatories and request for production of documents. However, the Court has ordered the parties to participate in an Informal Discovery Conference (IDC) before the hearing on the motion to compel, as required by the Eight Amended Standing Order for Procedures in the Personal Injury Hub Courts. The IDC is intended to avoid the necessity of a motion to compel or to reduce its scope. The Court has also ordered the parties to jointly submit a statement of items in dispute if they are unable to resolve all outstanding issues at the IDC. The parties are encouraged to meet and confer before the hearing to see if they can reach an agreement.
