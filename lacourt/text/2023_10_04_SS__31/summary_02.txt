## English Summary

This tentative ruling by Judge Michelle C. Kim addresses two motions to compel discovery responses filed by Defendant Nancy Rodriguez against Plaintiff Ada Mazariegos and Plaintiff Joselin Barrios.  

The judge found that Defendant Rodriguez properly served discovery requests on the Plaintiffs.  The Plaintiffs, represented by the same counsel, failed to respond to the requests within the allotted time, despite being granted an extension.  Because the Plaintiffs failed to respond, the Judge granted Defendant Rodriguez's motions to compel. 

The Plaintiffs are now ordered to serve their responses to the discovery requests within 15 days. 

Defendant Rodriguez also requested sanctions against the Plaintiffs for failing to respond to the discovery requests. However, the judge denied the request for sanctions because Defendant Rodriguez did not properly specify the applicable rule violated, the specific conduct, and the party against whom sanctions are sought.
