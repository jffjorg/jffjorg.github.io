And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Michelle C. Kim in a case between Ada Mazariegos, Joselin Barrios, and Nancy Rodriguez. The case involves a dispute over discovery requests, specifically form interrogatories and special interrogatories that were propounded by Defendant Rodriguez. The Plaintiffs failed to serve timely responses to these requests, and Defendant Rodriguez filed motions to compel discovery responses. The Court granted the motions, ordering the Plaintiffs to serve verified responses to the discovery requests without objections within 15 days. Defendant Rodriguez also requested sanctions in the amount of $374.25, but the Court denied this request because the Notice of motion did not provide the applicable statute or identify the party against whom sanctions are sought. The Court encouraged the parties to meet and confer to reach an agreement and also provided instructions for submitting to or appearing at the hearing.
