Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the petitions submitted on July 17, 2023, and denies both petitions. The petitions suffer from the same defects, including failure to provide a brief statement of treatments received, incorrect completion of MC-350 forms, and lack of specificity in expenses listed. The court orders the petitioner to cure these defects and resubmit the petitions. The petitioner must also comply with California Rules of Court 7.955(c) regarding attorneys' fee requests. The court intends to deny the petitions unless the defects are corrected.
