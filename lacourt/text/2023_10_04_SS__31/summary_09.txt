The judge specifically found issues with the way medical expenses and attorney fees were described, the lack of specific information about certain costs, and the way attachments were included in the petitions.  The judge ordered the petitioner to correct these issues and resubmit the petitions.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the petitions submitted by the parties for approval of a compromise of a minor's pending action. The court denies both petitions due to defects in the submissions. Specifically, the petitions fail to provide a brief statement of the treatments received by the minor, and the medical records are not kept together with the petition. Additionally, the expenses listed on the MC-350 form are unclear and not specific. The court also notes that the declaration in support of the attorneys' fee requests does not comply with CRC 7.955(c). The parties are ordered to cure these defects and resubmit new petitions at their earliest convenience.
