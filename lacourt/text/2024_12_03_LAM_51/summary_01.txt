And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrers filed by the Fox Defendants and Defendant Lara. The Fox Defendants' demurrer to the First and Second Causes of Action is sustained, and the court concludes that the complaint fails to state a cause of action. The demurrer is based on the fact that the complaint does not allege any violation of Civil Code § 789.3, which prohibits landlords from interrupting or terminating utility services with the intent to terminate a tenancy.

The Fox Defendants' demurrer also contends that executing on a valid writ of possession is not a violation of Civil Code § 1940.2. The court agrees with this contention and sustains the demurrer.

Defendant Lara's demurrer to the entire Complaint is also sustained. The court concludes that the complaint does not state any claim against Defendant Lara in her individual capacity.

The court denies leave to amend the complaint, as the plaintiff has not requested leave to amend and is deceased. The court is inclined to deny leave to amend because there is no indication of who will succeed the plaintiff's claims.

The ruling is effective for all purposes and constitutes a judgment as to Defendant Reddit, Inc. The Fox Defendants are required to give notice of the ruling.
