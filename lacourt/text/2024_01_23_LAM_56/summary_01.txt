And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the motion to compel further responses to discovery requests and has granted the motion. The respondent, Jadallah Youssef Saab, failed to file opposition papers in a timely manner, and therefore the court has not considered any arguments against the motion. The judge notes that the uninsured motorist law grants the superior court exclusive jurisdiction over discovery matters arising from uninsured motorist arbitrations. The court also cites relevant California Code of Civil Procedure sections and California case law to support its decision. The respondent is ordered to provide further, code-compliant responses to the discovery requests within 20 days of the date of this order.
