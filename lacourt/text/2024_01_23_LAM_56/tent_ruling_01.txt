Time: 8:30 a.m.

MOVING
PARTY: Petitioner
 
The
Court has reviewed the moving papers.  No
opposition papers were filed.  Any
opposition papers were required to have been filed and served at least nine
court days before the hearing under California Code of Civil Procedure
(“CCP”) section 1005, subdivision (b).
 
BACKGROUND
On
August 28, 2023, Petitioner filed a petition (the “Petition”) to establish the
Court’s jurisdiction over an uninsured motorist arbitration for purposes of
enforcing discovery procedures pursuant to Insurance Code section 11580.2,
subdivision (f).  
 
On
September 1, 2023, Petitioner filed: (1) a motion to compel further responses
to Form Interrogatories, Set One; and (2) a motion to compel further responses
to Special Interrogatories, Set One (collectively, the “Motions”).  
 
DISCUSSION
The uninsured motorist law grants the superior
court the exclusive jurisdiction to hear discovery matters
arising under uninsured motorist arbitrations. 
(Miranda v. 21st Century Ins. Co. (2004) 117 Cal.App.4th 913,
926.)
 
            Under
CCP section 2030.300, on receipt of a response to interrogatories, the
propounding party may move for an order compelling a further response if the
propounding party deems that any of the following apply: (1) an answer to a
particular interrogatory is evasive or incomplete; (2) an exercise of the
option to produce documents under CCP section 2030.230 is unwarranted or the
required specification of those documents is inadequate; or (3) an objection to
an interrogatory is without merit or too general.  (CCP § 2030.300, subd. (a).)  
 
Responses to
interrogatories must be as complete and straightforward as the information
reasonably available to the responding party permits.  (CCP § 2030.220, subd. (a).)  If an interrogatory cannot be answered
completely, then it must be answered to the extent possible.  (CCP § 2030.220, subd. (b).)  If the responding party does not have
personal knowledge sufficient to respond fully to an interrogatory, that party
shall so state, but shall make a reasonable and good faith effort to obtain the
information by inquiry to other natural persons or organizations, except where
the information is equally available to the propounding party.  (CCP § 2030.220, subd. (c).)  If the
responding party cannot furnish details, they should set forth the efforts made
to secure the information.  (Deyo v.
Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771, 782.) 
The responding party cannot plead ignorance to information which can be
obtained from sources under their control. 
(Id.)
 
            Petitioner served Respondent with the discovery requests
at issue in the Motions on December 2, 2022. 
(See Declaration of Michelle C. Balady (“Balady Decl.”) ¶ 7,
Exhibit A.)[1]  Respondent provided responses on July 18,
2023.  (Balady Decl. ¶ 8, Exhibit
B.)  The Separate Statements filed in
support of the Motions identify Petitioner’s arguments regarding the
sufficiency of some of Respondent’s responses.    
 
As they are unopposed, the Court GRANTS the Motions.  (Sexton v. Superior
Court (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.)  Respondent is ordered to provide further,
code-compliant responses to the discovery at issue in the Motions within 20
days of the date of this order. 
 
 
             Moving party is ordered to give notice of this
ruling.
 
 
 
Parties who intend
to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at
SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed by the instructions provided on the court
website at www.lacourt.org.  If the
department does not receive an email and there are no appearances at the
hearing, the motion will be placed off calendar.
