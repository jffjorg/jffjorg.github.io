  CASE NO.: 23STSCV02814
[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: MOTIONS TO BE
  RELIEVED AS COUNSEL
 
Date: 
  January 23, 2024
Time: 8:30 a.m.
Dept. 56
Jury Trial: August 5, 2024
 



 
MOVING PARTY: Farhad Novian and Lindsey Phipps on
behalf of Novian & Novian (“N&N”)
 
            RESPONDING
PARTY: Plaintiff
 
            The Court has considered the moving,
opposition and reply papers. 
 
BACKGROUND
Plaintiff’s complaint (the “Complaint”) alleges: (1)
action to enforce a judgment; (2) breach of contract; and (3) declaratory
judgment. 
 
 
 
N&N wishes to withdraw as counsel for Defendants
Avalon Cold Storage, LLC; American Logistics Food Processing and Packing LLC;
and American Logistics International Fulfillment, LLC (collectively,
“Defendants”).  On December 22, 2023,
N&N filed three motions to be relieved as counsel for Defendants
(collectively, the “Motions”).  The
Motions are compliant with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362. 

 
DISCUSSION
The
court has discretion on whether to allow an attorney to withdraw, and a motion
to withdraw will not be granted where withdrawal would prejudice the
client.  (Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915.)  Withdrawal is generally permitted unless
there is a compelling reason to continue the representation. (Heple v.
Kluge (1951) 104 Cal.App.2d 461, 462.)
 
            In connection with the Motions, N&N
declares that Defendants have closed their operations and ceased communicating
with counsel, making it impossible for counsel to continue carrying out the
representation.  
 
            Plaintiff’s oppositions
(collectively, the “Oppositions”) argue that the Motions represent Defendants’
attempt to stall the progression of the litigation to Plaintiff’s
detriment.  The Oppositions note that
Defendants are required to have representation because they are business
entities.  
 
 
The
Court agrees with Plaintiff’s contention that Defendants are required to be
represented by counsel due to their status as LLCs.  (See Caressa Camille, Inc. v. Alcoholic
Beverage Control Appeals Bd. (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 1094, 1101.)  This requirement, however, does not preclude
Defendants’ current counsel from withdrawing where, as here, the
attorney-client relationship has broken down. 
Given that the trial is not scheduled to begin for over six months, the
Court finds that the Motions set forth an adequate basis for withdrawal.  The Court therefore GRANTS the Motions.  The Court will hold an OSC regarding
Defendants’ representation on February 13, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. in this
department.
 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If
the department does not receive an email and there are no appearances at the
hearing, the motion will be placed off calendar. 
 
             Dated this 23rd day of January 2024
