And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has reviewed the motions filed by Novian & Novian (N&N) to withdraw as counsel for defendants Avalon Cold Storage, LLC, American Logistics Food Processing and Packing LLC, and American Logistics International Fulfillment, LLC. The court finds that the defendants are required to be represented by counsel due to their status as limited liability companies (LLCs). However, the court also notes that the attorney-client relationship has broken down, making it impossible for N&N to continue representing the defendants. Given that the trial is not scheduled to begin for over six months, the court grants the motions and allows N&N to withdraw as counsel. The court will hold an order to show cause (OSC) on February 13, 2024, to address the defendants' representation.
