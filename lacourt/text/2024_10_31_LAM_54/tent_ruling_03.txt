When timely responses to
interrogatories are not received, “[t]he party propounding the interrogatories
may move for an order compelling response to the interrogatories.”  (CCP § 2030.290(b).) “If a party to whom a demand
for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a
timely response to it. . .  [t]he party
to whom the demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed
waives any objection to the demand, including one based on privilege or on the
protection for work product. . . .  The
party making the demand may move for an order compelling response to the
demand.”  (CCP § 2031.300(a)–(b).)
 
Plaintiff moves to compel responses to
FIs, set one, SIs, set two, and RPDs, set two, from Defendant. Plaintiff served
the discovery on August 6, 2024. Responses were due on September 9, 2024. In
opposition, Defendant asserts that Defendant recently obtained new counsel who
requested an extension to serve responses and Plaintiff’s counsel refused to
grant the extension.
 
The Court will continue the hearing on
the motions to November 25, 2024 to allow Defendant to serve responses.
Defendant to serve responses and file a declaration no later than November 20,
2024 stating responses have been served.
