And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling in a case involving IRP Fund II Trust 1A (the plaintiff) and Yizhak Malka (the defendant). The plaintiff is seeking to compel the defendant to respond to discovery requests, including Financial Institution (FI) sets one and two, Set One Inspection (SI) sets two, and Request for Production of Documents (RPD) sets two. The defendant has not yet served responses to these discovery requests, despite being required to do so by September 9, 2024. The defendant claims that new counsel was recently obtained and requested an extension to serve responses, but the plaintiff's counsel refused to grant the extension.

The judge has continued the hearing on the motions to November 25, 2024, to allow the defendant to serve responses. The defendant is required to serve responses and file a declaration stating that responses have been served no later than November 20, 2024. The plaintiff is required to notify the court of any changes to the tentative ruling. The court will reconsider the tentative ruling based on any submissions made by the parties prior to the hearing.
