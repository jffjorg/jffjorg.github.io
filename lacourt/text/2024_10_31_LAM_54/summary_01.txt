And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case 24STCP02772. The petition to vacate the arbitration award filed by Carl Rinsch, et al. has been denied. The petition to confirm the arbitration award filed by Ice Cream Fridge, LLC, et al. has been granted.

The judge found that the comments made by the arbitrator during the trial, which referred to Carl Rinsch's autism diagnosis, did not show bias against him. The arbitrator's award was within her discretion, and the petition to vacate the award on the grounds of bias was denied.

Additionally, the judge found that the arbitrator did not exceed her powers by rewriting the terms of the parties' agreements. The arbitrator's interpretation of the contracts and the evidence considered in reaching that interpretation were within her discretion, and the petition to vacate the award on this ground was also denied.

The judge noted that the arbitrator's comments were made in a concern for the parties' privacy and careers outside of the arbitration process, and that Carl Rinsch's arguments to the contrary were undermined by his failure to timely raise the issue during arbitration and by his expression of gratitude and praise for the arbitrator's integrity.

The judge's tentative ruling is subject to change based on any further submissions or arguments made by the parties.
