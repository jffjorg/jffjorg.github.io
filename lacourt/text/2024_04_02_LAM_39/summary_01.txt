And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for reconsideration in a case involving a breach of contract and conversion claim. The case revolves around a referral agreement between plaintiff Marvin Kay and defendant Gregory A. Yates, and the settlement of a case called the Lime Grove case. The agreement included a sliding scale up to $4 million, and Yates was supposed to pay Kay a portion of the attorney's fees earned. However, Yates did not pay Kay, and the dispute centers around whether Yates worked on the Lime Grove case and whether the settlement proceeds were part of his referral agreement with Kay.

The Court previously granted a motion for judgment on the pleadings by Steve Vartazarian and his practice, dismissing the conversion claim. However, the Court has reconsidered its ruling and has granted leave to amend the complaint with a new cause of action for conversion against Vartazarian and his practice. The Court has also converted the dismissal with prejudice to a dismissal without prejudice. The Court has authorized plaintiff's counsel to file an amended complaint with additional facts within 30 days. The Yates defendants do not need to re-file their motion for summary judgment, but the Vartazarian defendants may file their own joinder to the Yates defendants' motion for summary judgment and their own motion for summary judgment.
