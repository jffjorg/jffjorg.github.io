OF MATTERS ADMITTED IN PLAINTIFF’S REQUESTS FOR ADMISSIONS (SET ONE)
MOVING PARTIES: Plaintiff HERNANDEZ JOSE DE JESUS
RESPONDING PARTY: Unopposed
The court considered the moving papers.
BACKGROUND
Plaintiff Hernandez Jose de Jesus filed the complaint
against defendant FCA US LLC on January 24, 2023. Plaintiff alleges the
following causes of action: (1) violation of Song-Beverly Act – Breach of
Express Warranty; (2) violation of Song-Beverly Act – Breach of Implied
Warranty; and (3) violation of the Song-Beverly Act section 1793.2.
Plaintiff alleges that on December 11, 2019, plaintiff
purchased a 2019 Ram 2500 (subject vehicle). Plaintiff alleges that the subject
vehicle was delivered to plaintiff with serious defects and nonconformities to
warranty and developed other serious defects and nonconformities to warranty
including, but not limited to, engine, electrical, emission, and transmission
system defects.
Plaintiff filed the instant motion on April 17, 2024. No
opposition has been filed.
LEGAL STANDARD
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280,
subdivision (b), a “party may move for an order that the genuineness of any
documents and the truth of any matters specified in the requests be deemed
admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
section 2023.010).” The court “shall” grant the motion to deem requests for
admission admitted “unless it finds that the party to whom the requests for
admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed
response to the requests for admission that is in substantial compliance with
Section 2033.220.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280(c).)
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff served Requests for Admissions to Defendant, Set
One on defendant on March 20, 2023. (Decl. of Gregory Sogoyan, ¶ 8, Exh. 1.)
Defendant’s response was due on April 21, 2023; however, to date, defendant has
not responded. The court finds that plaintiff properly served the requests for
admissions and defendant failed to serve verified responses. Because defendant
failed to respond, the court finds plaintiff is entitled to an order deeming
the truth of matters admitted in plaintiff’s Requests for Admissions, Set One.
Based on the foregoing, the court GRANTS the motion and
deems the matters within plaintiffs’ Requests for Admissions, Set One as true
against defendant FCA US LLC
