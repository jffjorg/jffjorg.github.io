BACKGROUND
This action arises out of a
motor vehicle accident. Plaintiff Marine Amirkhanyan alleges that defendants
Eden Malul and Trig Builder, Inc. were the owners and/or operators of the 2018
Toyota Tundra vehicle that was involved in the incident that is the subject of
this lawsuit. Plaintiff alleges that on March 2, 2023, plaintiff was the driver
of a 2015 BMW 328i traveling eastbound on Erwin Street approaching the
intersection of Whitsett Avenue in the City of Los Angeles. Plaintiff alleges
defendant Eden Malul was driving southbound on Whitsett Avenue approaching Ewin
Street, at the same time. Plaintiff alleges that as she accelerated from a full
stop at the flashing red traffic lights at the intersection, the vehicle driven
by defendant Eden Malul failed to stop for the traffic signals, entered the
intersection at a high speed, and caused a collision with the front driver’s
side of plaintiff’s vehicle.
Plaintiff filed the complaint against defendants on August
28, 2023, alleging negligence. Plaintiff alleges that as a result of defendant
Malul’s failure to obey a traffic control device, his failure to yield the
right of way, his high speed, and his failure to pay attention to the roadway,
plaintiff suffered injuries and damages.
Plaintiff filed the instant motion on April 27, 2024. No
opposition has been filed.
LEGAL STANDARD
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280,
subdivision (b), a “party may move for an order that the genuineness of any
documents and the truth of any matters specified in the requests be deemed
admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
section 2023.010).” The court “shall” grant the motion to deem requests for
admission admitted “unless it finds that the party to whom the requests for
admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed
response to the requests for admission that is in substantial compliance with
Section 2033.220.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280(c).)
DISCUSSION
A. Request for Admission
Plaintiff served Plaintiff’s Requests for Admission, Set
One on defendant Trig Builders, Inc. (defendant) on September 26, 2023, by
email. (Decl. of Narek Vardanyan, Esq. ¶ 2; Exh. A.) Defendant’s response was
due on October 30, 2023. The parties agreed upon an extension for discovery
responses first until January 5, 2024, then until January 12, 2024, and finally
until February 29, 2024. (Decl. of Narek Vardanyan, Esq. Exh. B.) To date, Defendant
has not provided a response.
The court finds that plaintiff properly served the requests
for admissions and defendant failed to serve verified responses. Because
defendant failed to respond, the court finds plaintiff is entitled to an order
deeming the truth of matters admitted in plaintiff’s Requests for Admissions,
Set One.
B. Sanctions
Plaintiff requests the court award monetary sanctions
against defendant. “It is mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction .
. . on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely response
to requests for admission necessitated this motion.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2033.280(c).) The court finds that because defendant has failed to serve a
timely response to requests for admission and thus necessitated the instant
motion, plaintiff is entitled to monetary sanctions pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 2033.280(c). The court finds that the requested $811.65 is
unreasonable given there is no opposition to the motion. Accordingly, the court
awards sanctions in the amount of $561.65 (2 hours at $250/hour plus $61.65 in
filing fees) against defendant Trig Builders, Inc. and its attorney of record,
Angelina R. Lane, Esq.
 
Based on the foregoing, the court GRANTS the motion and
deems the matters within plaintiffs’ Requests for Admissions, Set One as true
against defendant Trig Builders, Inc.
The court awards sanctions against Defendant and its
counsel of record, Angelina R. Lane, Esq., in the amount of $561.65.
