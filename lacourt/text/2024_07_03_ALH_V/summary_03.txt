Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion to deem the truth of matters admitted in the plaintiff's Requests for Admissions, Set One. The plaintiff served the requests on the defendant on March 20, 2023, and the defendant failed to respond. As a result, the court finds that the plaintiff is entitled to an order deeming the truth of the matters admitted in the requests. The judge relies on Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280, which allows a party to move for an order deeming the genuineness of documents and the truth of matters specified in requests for admission admitted. The court finds that the plaintiff properly served the requests and the defendant failed to serve verified responses, and therefore grants the motion.
