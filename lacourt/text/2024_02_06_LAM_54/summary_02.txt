Here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge, Maurice A. Leiter, has issued a tentative ruling in the case 23STCV17413. The case involves a default judgment entered against defendants Lin Yang and Kundi Li, who have moved to set it aside. The defendants argue that they were not properly served with the summons and complaint, while the plaintiff, Yi Ping Lu, asserts that the proofs of service and declaration of the registered process server create a presumption of proper service. However, the defendants have rebutted this presumption by showing that the process server could not have personally served Defendant Yang, as Yang is not a 5'6" 130lb female. The judge has granted the defendants' motion to set aside the default, ordering them to respond to the complaint within 30 days.
