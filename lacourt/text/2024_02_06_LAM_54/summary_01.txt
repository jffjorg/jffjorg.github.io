And here is the English-text summary:

Judge Maurice Leiter has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Evike.com Inc. and Matrix Airsoft, Inc. v. 2801 Mission Road Properties, LLC. The case involves a dispute over a commercial lease and allegations of breach of contract, intentional interference with contractual relations, and punitive damages.

The Judge has OVERRULED the defendant's demurrer to the third, fourth, and fifth causes of action, which argued that the lease barred liability for these claims. The Judge also DENIED the defendant's motion to strike the punitive damages from the complaint, finding that the allegations of intentional and bad faith misrepresentation by the defendant were sufficient to support a claim for punitive damages.

The Judge has ordered the defendant to file and serve an answer to the second amended complaint within 30 days of notice of the ruling.
