And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Defendant/Cross-defendant Stephen Spencer Morris to the Cross-Complaint filed by Defendant and Cross-Complainant Standard Fire Insurance Company (SFI). The Judge sustains the demurrer without leave to amend, finding that Morris was improperly joined as a Cross-defendant in the Cross-Complaint. The Judge concludes that Morris and SFI are not joint tortfeasors in this case, and that there is no contractual privity between Morris and SFI, or between Morris and the Plaintiffs. The Judge also finds that the Complaint and Cross-Complaint do not allege that Morris caused or contributed to the breach of insurance contracts between the Plaintiffs and SFI. As a result, the Judge finds that Morris is not an indispensable or conditionally necessary party to the Cross-Complaint.
