And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the Plaintiff's Motion for Trial Preference, which was opposed by the Defendant. The Plaintiff, Mary Garcia, brings this action against the Defendant, Specialized Realty, Inc., after tripping and falling on the Defendant's property on July 19, 2022, and sustaining serious bodily injuries. The Plaintiff, who is now 81 years old, has chronic health conditions, including end-stage chronic heart disease, and has undergone surgical procedures.

The Plaintiff's counsel declares that the Plaintiff's health is failing and that a preference is necessary to prevent prejudicing her interest in the litigation. The judge finds that the Plaintiff has a substantial interest in the litigation and that her health is such that a preference is necessary to prevent prejudicing her interest.

The Defendant opposes the Motion, citing lack of evidence of the Plaintiff's failing health and concerns about due process. However, the judge finds that the Defendant's due process concerns must yield to the Plaintiff's right to a trial preference under Code of Civil Procedure section 36(a). The Plaintiff has made a showing under Code of Civil Procedure section 36(a) that a trial preference is warranted.
