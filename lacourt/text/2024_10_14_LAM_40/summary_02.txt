**Case Information**

* Case Number: 24STCV17331
* Hearing Date: October 14, 2024
* Department: 40 Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles, Department 40

**Parties**

* Plaintiff: Joshua Lorne Rogers
* Defendants: Carlson Industries LLC, Natasha Teresa Skidmore, Nicholas Kanter, and Does 1-100

**Facts**

* Rogers sued Carlson Industries, Skidmore, Kanter, and others for breach of contract, inducing breach of contract, intentional interference with contractual relations, breach of covenant of good faith, and breach of covenant of quiet enjoyment.
* Rogers alleges that Skidmore made one payment under a sublease agreement and made no payments thereafter, and that Carlson Industries and Kanter caused Skidmore to discontinue payments.
* Rogers also alleges that Carlson Industries denied his request to sublease and barred him from hosting an event at the 660 Property.

**Motion**

* Carlson Industries filed a special motion to strike (anti-SLAPP motion) against the Complaint's third and fourth causes of action, alleging that they arise from protected settlement communications.

**Anti-SLAPP Analysis**

* The court finds that the third and fourth causes of action arise from protected activity, as the communication related to the proposed Settlement Agreement is protected under the litigation privilege.
* The court concludes that Carlson Industries has satisfied its burden to show that the allegations supporting the third and fourth causes of action fall within the definition of protected activity.

**Second-Prong Analysis**

* The court finds that Rogers has not met his burden to demonstrate a probability of prevailing on the merits of the third and fourth causes of action.
* The court concludes that the litigation privilege applies to the settlement communications, and that Rogers has not shown a probability of success on the merits of the third and fourth causes of action.

**Ruling**

* The court grants Carlson Industries' special motion to strike under Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16, and strikes the third cause of action for Inducing Breach of Contract and the fourth cause of action for Intentional Interference with Contractual Relations.
