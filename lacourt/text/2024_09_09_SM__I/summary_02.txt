And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for reconsideration or to set aside a default judgment. The motion is denied. The judge believes that the default judgment is not void, but rather voidable at most, and that there are time limits for bringing motions to vacate. The defendant was aware of the default for two years before filing the motion, but did nothing during that time. The judge finds that the defendant's decision to delay was a tactical one, rather than an accident. The defendant failed to appear at a previous hearing and did not provide a satisfactory explanation for the default or the failure to move to vacate. The judge will hear arguments from the parties, but the tentative ruling remains in effect.
