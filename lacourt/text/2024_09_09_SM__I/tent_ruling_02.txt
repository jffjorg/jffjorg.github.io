 Case Number:  21SMCV01421    Hearing Date:   September 9, 2024    Dept:  I The court issued its tentative ruling on May 21, 2024.  That remains the court’s tentative
ruling.  The court will hear argument
from the parties, but tentatively the motion for reconsideration or to set
aside the default is DENIED.  The court
believes that the judgment is not void—it is voidable at most.  Therefore, there are time limits to bring
motions to vacate, all of which doom the instant motion.  Further, it is plain from the record here
that defendant was aware for about two years before filing the motion to set
aside the default that there was a default, yet defendant did nothing.  That gives rise to the inescapable conclusion
that the decision to delay was a tactical one, not an inadvertent one.  Nothing in any of the papers persuasively
demonstrates anything to the contrary. 
The court understands why defendant did not appear at the last hearing,
and there appears to have been a good reason for that.  But there is still no explanation for the
default in the first place or the failure to move in a timely manner to vacate
the default.
