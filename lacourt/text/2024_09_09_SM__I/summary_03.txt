```

And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for terminating sanctions. The case involves a dispute between neighbors, and the Defendant has brought the motion after the Plaintiff failed to respond to discovery and ignored the court's orders. The Judge notes that the motion is brought in good faith, but the court has seen similar cases before and wants to ensure that the Plaintiff is given a chance to comply with the court's orders. The Judge denies the motion, but gives the Plaintiff one more chance to provide verified responses to all outstanding discovery within 30 days. If the Plaintiff fails to do so, the Defendant is invited to bring a new motion, which the court intends to grant unless the Plaintiff can provide a good justification for the failure to respond. The Judge also suggests that the parties may want to consider resolving the dispute amicably, as they will continue to be neighbors regardless of the outcome of the case.
