 Case Number:  23SMCV02809    Hearing Date:   September 9, 2024    Dept:  I The matter is here for a final status conference.  The court gave the FSC order on December 19,
2023.  Although compliant FSC materials
were not filed, the court is in receipt of a Notice of Settlement, which, of
course, is an excellent reason not to go forward with the FSC.  In light of the Notice of Settlement, the
trial date is VACATED.  The court will
set an OSC re: Dismissal (Settlement) with no appearances necessary if the
matter has been dismissed prior to that time.
