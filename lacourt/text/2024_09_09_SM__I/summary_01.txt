And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is unhappy with the parties' lack of preparation for the final status conference (FSC) and has vacated the trial date. The parties failed to follow the court's FSC order, which required joint filings and meeting and conferring on FSC materials. The judge received the parties' materials, including jury instructions, exhibit lists, witness lists, and verdict forms, but notes that the parties did not provide stipulations on authenticity and admissibility where possible.

The judge is particularly upset with plaintiffs' counsel for filing materials without giving the defense meaningful time to respond. The judge has struck the plaintiffs' materials and will hold a trial setting conference and an OSC re: sanctions to discuss the appropriate sanctions for the parties' unreadiness for trial and unwillingness to cooperate. The judge warns that the parties' failure to prepare may lead to a 5-year delay in the trial date. The judge also notes that the parties' failure to follow the court's rules is unacceptable and may lead to sanctions against the parties and their attorneys.
