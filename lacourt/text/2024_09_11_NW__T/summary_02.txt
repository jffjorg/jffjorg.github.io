And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendant's motion for a protective order, denying the motion. The Judge finds that the discovery submitted by the plaintiff is relevant and reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence, and that the defendant's entity status does not justify a protective order. The Judge also notes that seeking the same information through deposition would be problematic and that written discovery is more efficient. The Judge awards monetary sanctions of $1,000 against the City of Los Angeles for failing to meet in good faith and for failing to act with substantial justification. The City must pay the sanctions to the Client Trust Account of CHEREN AND ASSOCIATES by September 25, 2024.
