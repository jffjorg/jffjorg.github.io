Introduction 
Defendant Karapet Arakelyan,
individually and as dba Gary’s Trucking (Defendant), filed separate motions to
compel initial responses to form interrogatories, set one (FI), special
interrogatories, set one (SI), request for production of documents, set one
(RPD), and to deem requests for admissions, set one (RFA), admitted.   
With each motion, Defendant
requested monetary sanctions against Plaintiff and his counsel.  The FI motion requested $1,863.00.  The SI motion requested $498.00.  The RFP motion requested $708.00.  The RFA motion requested $1,863.00.
Opposition was due August 28,
2024 but none was filed.  No declaration
was filed by plaintiff's counsel to explain why the responses were never
served.
Discussion 
A party that has not received
timely responses to written interrogatories, requests for production, and
requests for admissions is entitled to an order compelling responses without
objections and an order deeming the matters specified in the requests as admitted.  (Code Civ. Proc. secs. 2030.290, 2031.300,
and 2033.280.)  A motion to compel
initial discovery responses need not show good cause, meeting and conferring,
or timely filing, and need not be accompanied by a separate statement.  (Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pac.
Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 404.)  Defendant served the four discovery demands
upon Plaintiff.  (Austin Stenberg
(Stenberg) Decl. par. 3, Exh. A.) 
Despite multiple attempts to meet and confer and Plaintiff’s agreement
to respond, Plaintiff failed to respond. 
(Stenberg Decl. pars. 4-8, Exhs. B and C.)  Because responses have not been served,
Defendant met his burden on all four motions.
Defendant’s motions to compel
responses to FI, SI, and RPD are GRANTED. 
Defendant’s motion to deem RFAs admitted is GRANTED.
Under Code of Civil Procedure
secs. 2030.290(c) and 2031.300(c), sanctions shall be imposed unless the Court
finds that the responding party acted with substantial justification or that
other circumstances make the imposition of a sanction unjust.  Sanctions under section Code of Civil
Procedure sec. 2033.280(c) are mandatory. 
Without any opposition or even an explanation, Plaintiff failed to show
substantial justification or circumstances making sanctions unjust.  
Defendant asserted that their
cost for filing was $60 for each motion plus an electronic filing fee of
$9.00.  Defendant was charged an hourly
rate of $210.00.  (Stenberg Decl. par.
9.)  The hourly rate is reasonable.  The time expended for each motion is
excessive and unreasonable, especially because no opposition or reply was filed
as to any motion.  The Court reduced the
hours expended to about 3 hours for each motion.  The Court awards Defendant $650.00 on each of
the four motions.  The sanctions are
levied against Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s Counsel, jointly and severally.
Defendant’s Requests for
Sanctions in all four Motions are GRANTED at the reduced amount of $650.00
each.   Total sanctions ordered are $2,600.
IT IS SO ORDERED, CLERK TO GIVE NOTICE.
