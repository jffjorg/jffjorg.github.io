The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of 24VECV00646. The Defendant, Karapet Arakelyan, has filed motions to compel the Plaintiff, Rudolph Kinney, to respond to discovery demands. The Plaintiff has failed to respond to these demands, despite multiple attempts by the Defendant to meet and confer. As a result, the Judge is granting the Defendant's motions to compel initial responses to form interrogatories, special interrogatories, request for production of documents, and deem requests for admissions. The Judge is also granting the Defendant's requests for monetary sanctions against the Plaintiff and his counsel in the amount of $650.00. This amount is reduced from the original amount requested by the Defendant, which was $1,863.00. The sanctions are levied against the Plaintiff and his counsel, jointly and severally. The Judge orders the Plaintiff to serve verified responses to the discovery demands without objections within 10 days.
