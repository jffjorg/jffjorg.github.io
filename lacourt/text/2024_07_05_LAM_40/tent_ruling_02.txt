I. Background
On February 12, 2024, Defendant
Union Mutualista De San Jose (Union Mutualista) served a first set of
production requests and request for admission on Plaintiff Rafael Davila
Madrigal (RPDs, Set One; RFAs, Set One) and a first set of form interrogatories
and requests for admission on Plaintiff Alicia Brisila Davila (FROGs, Set One;
RFAs, Set One).
Based on Plaintiffs’ nonresponse to
this discovery, on March 27, 2024, Union Mutualista filed motions to (1) compel
initial responses to FROGs Set One, from Alicia Brisila Davila, (2) compel
initial responses to RPDs, Set One, from Rafael Davila Madrigal, and (3)-(4)
deem the truth of RFAs, Set One, admitted as against both Plaintiffs. All four
motions request monetary sanctions. The motions attach proofs of service
showing service of the four motions on Plaintiffs in pro per at their
Wilmington, California residence.
No oppositions, replies, or notices
of non-opposition appear in the record.
Union Mutualista’s motions are now
before the Court.
 
II. Motions
to Compel Initial Discovery Responses or Deem Admitted and Requests and
Requests for Sanctions
A. Motions to Compel Initial
Discovery Responses or Deem Admitted: GRANTED.
1. Legal
Standard
A motion to compel an initial
response can be made on the ground that a party did not serve a timely response
to interrogatories or a demand to produce. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd.
(a) [interrogatories], 2031.300, subd. (a) [demand to produce]; see Sinaiko Healthcare
Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th
390, 404 (Sinaiko).) To establish this ground, a movant must show:
(1) Proper service (see Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 2030.080, subd. (a) [interrogatories], 2031.040 [demand to produce], 2033.070
[admission requests]);
(2) Expiration of the deadline for
the initial response 30 days after service or on date agreed to by parties (see
Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.260, subds. (a), (b) [interrogatories], 2031.260,
subds. (a), (b) [demand to produce], 2033.250, subds. (a), (b) [admission
requests]); and
(3) No timely response (see Code
Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290 [interrogatories], 2031.300 [demand to produce],
2033.280, subd. (b) [admission requests]).
A court must deny a motion to
compel initial discovery where the discovery sought is outside the scope of
discovery. (See CBS, Inc. v. Superior Court (1968) 263 Cal.App.2d 12,
19; see also Code. Civ. Proc., § 2017.010 [scope of discovery].) 
2. Analysis
The Court finds in favor of Union
Mutualista.
Union Mutualista provides proof of
service of RPDs, Set One, and RFAs, Set One, on Rafael Davila Madrigal, and proof
of service of FROGs, Set One, and RFAs, Set One, on Alicia Brisila Davila, with
service occurring on February 12, 2024. (All Motions, Schiller Decl., Exs. 1
[discovery and proof of service], 2 [printout of USPS delivery confirmation].)
Union Mutualista provides evidence
that the deadline for initial responses has passed—which, by the Court’s
estimate, occurred Friday, March 15, 2024, 30 days after service by mail, plus
two court days for service by certified mail. (All Motions, Schiller Decl., ¶¶ 2-5.)
Union Mutualista provides evidence
that Plaintiffs never responded to the discovery that Union Mutualista served
on them on February 12, 2022. (All Motions, Schiller Decl., ¶ 6.)
Last, a brief review shows that the
first set of discovery contains requests within the scope of discovery for this
action because the interrogatories, production requests, and admission requests
at issue involve issues germane to the claims before the Court.
Union Mutualista’s motions are thus
GRANTED as to (1) compelling initial responses to RPDs, Set One, from Rafael
Davila Madrigal, (2) compelling initial responses to FROGs, Set One, from
Alicia Brisila Davila, and (3)-(4) deeming the truth of the matters set forth
in RFAs, Set One, as admitted against Rafael Davila Madrigal and Alicia Brisila
Davila.
B. Requests for Sanctions: GRANTED.
1. Legal
Standard
The Court must impose monetary
sanctions against anyone—party, nonparty, or attorney—who unsuccessfully makes
or opposes the motion. As relates to interrogatories and production requests,
the Court can deny sanctions if it finds that the person to be sanctioned acted
with substantial justification or other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanctions unjust, a standard not applicable to admission requests. (See
Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (c) [interrogatories], 2031.300, subd. (c)
[demand to produce], 2033.280, subd. (c); see Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting,
Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants, supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at p.
404 [interrogatories and demand to produce]; Appleton v. Superior Court
(1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 632, 636 [admission request sanctions are mandatory; no
discretion].)
The court may award sanctions under
the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery,
even though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion
was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party
after the motion was filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1348, subd. (a).)
2. Analysis
The Court finds in favor of Union
Mutualista.
The failure to respond to
authorized methods of discovery is a sanctionable discovery abuse. (Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 2023.010, subd. (d), 2023.030, subd. (a).)
Here, such an abuse has occurred
through Plaintiffs’ non-response to FROGs, Set One, RPDs, Set One, and/or RFAs,
Set One.
These abuses justify an award of
sanctions equal to the amounts requested by Union Mutualista, which seeks
compensation for the reasonable time spent on these motions by counsel.
Sanctions are thus GRANTED in the
amount of (1) $1,060 in relation to FROGs, Set One, as against Alicia Brisila
Davila, (2) $1,110 in relation to RPDs, Set One, as against Rafael Davila
Madrigal, (3) $810 in relation to RFAs, Set One, as against Alicia Brisila
Davila, and (4) $1,260 in relation to RFAs, Set One, as against Rafael Davila
Madrigal.
