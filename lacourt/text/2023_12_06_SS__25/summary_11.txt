And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in this case, which is a motion for relief from waiver of objections to discovery propounded by the Respondent. The Petitioner, State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company, argues that it did not waive its objections because the discovery requests were improperly served by email and before it had appeared in the arbitration. The Judge agrees with the Petitioner, finding that the discovery requests were prematurely served and that the Petitioner was not obligated to respond. As a result, the Petitioner's motion for relief from waiver of objections is denied as moot.
