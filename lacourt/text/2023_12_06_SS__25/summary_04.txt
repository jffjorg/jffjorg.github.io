And here is a summary in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for attorney's fees without prejudice. The plaintiff is seeking an award of $316,638 for alleged Labor Code violations, including meal and rest break violations, overtime payment violations, wage payment violations, waiting time penalties, and failure to issue accurate itemized wage statements. The defendants argue that the fee request is patently unreasonable and grossly inflated, and that the plaintiff should apportion her fees among the wage and hour claims she purportedly prevailed on and the remaining claims. The judge finds that the motion is premature, as not all issues have been resolved in the action, and that the parties did not stipulate to having attorney's fees resolved prejudgment by motion. The judge also notes that the plaintiff failed to identify causes of action on which she prevailed, and that the fee request is unreasonable given the benefits received.
