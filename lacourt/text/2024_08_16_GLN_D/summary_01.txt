As for the summary of the judge's tentative ruling, here is a brief summary:

The judge is denying the plaintiff's motion for sanctions against the defendant, Hudson Insurance Company. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant filed a motion for summary judgment while a stay was in place and failed to provide sufficient notice of the motion. The judge finds that the plaintiff has failed to establish that relief is available under CCP sections 128 and 128.5, and that the motion for sanctions was not properly filed. The judge also notes that the plaintiff has failed to establish that the defendant has violated any rules or orders of the court, and that the defendant's conduct, while improper, does not warrant the imposition of sanctions.
