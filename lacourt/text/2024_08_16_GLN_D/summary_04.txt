And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the demurrer filed by the defendants (Hala Grovier, Samer Kanso, Healthcare Clinical, and Mario A. Kohan, M.D.) is moot due to the filing of an Amended Complaint by the plaintiff (Alexis Palacio) on July 9, 2024. The Amended Complaint was filed in accordance with CCP § 472, which allows amendments to be made without leave of the court at any time before the answer, demurrer, or motion to strike is filed, or after a demurrer or motion to strike is filed but before it is heard. The judge reminds the parties of their obligations under CCP § 430.41 (a) to meet and confer again before filing a demurrer to the amended pleading.
