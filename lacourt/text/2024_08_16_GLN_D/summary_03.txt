And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has tentatively ruled that the demurrer filed by Farmers Specialty Insurance Company (defendant) to the complaint brought by Khachik Salamyan and Seryozha Poghosyan (plaintiffs) is overruled. The defendant had argued that the plaintiffs failed to allege compliance with Insurance Code section 11580.2, which requires the insured to take certain steps within two years of the accident to preserve their right to bring a claim against the uninsured motorist. The court found that the plaintiffs' allegations were sufficient to state a cause of action and that the defendant's argument was based on a misinterpretation of the statute.

The court also noted that the defendant's argument that the plaintiffs' cause of action for breach of contract failed and that they were time-barred from pursuing any claim to policy benefits was not persuasive. The court found that the plaintiffs' allegations were sufficient to state a cause of action for breach of contract and that the defendant's argument was based on a misinterpretation of the statute.

The court's ruling is tentative and is subject to change after the parties have an opportunity to file opposition and reply briefs. The court also encouraged the parties to make arrangements for audio or video appearances, as Department D is continuing to conduct and encourage remote appearances.
