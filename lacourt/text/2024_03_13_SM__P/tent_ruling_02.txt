Gradney v. Kirakosian,
Case No. 23SMCV04092
Hearing Date March

Defendant
Kirakosian’s Motion to Strike Punitive Damages from FAC
 
Plaintiff
purchased defendant’s business, a congregate care facility, and leased space
from defendant. Plaintiff alleges via the first amended complaint that
defendant tried to terminate the lease, gave plaintiff insufficient notice of
abandonment of the property and sold plaintiff’s personal property valued at
over $100,000. Defendant moves to strike plaintiff’s request for punitive
damages on the grounds that the allegations supporting the request are
impermissibly vague and do not state sufficient facts to support the claim.
 
Punitive damages
are allowable only when plaintiff proves defendant has been guilty of
oppression, fraud or malice. Cal. Civ. Code §3294(a). Facts giving rise to a
claim for punitive damages must be pleaded specifically – vague or conclusory
allegations are insufficient. G.D. Searle & Company v. Superior Court (1975)
49 Cal.App.3d 22, 29. Punitive damages must be pleaded specifically, and
conclusory requests for punitive damages without factual support are subject to
a motion to strike. E.g., Cyrus v. Haveson (1976) 65 Cal.App.3d 306,
316-317; Grieves v. Superior Court (1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 159, 164.
Recklessness or negligence, even gross negligence, are insufficient to support
an award of punitive damage – carelessness or ignorance are not enough. Dawes
v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 82, 88. On a motion to strike, the
allegations in a pleading must be treated as true. E.g., Clauson v. Sup. Ct.
(1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 1253, 1255. 
 
Plaintiff alleges
“as Defendant was aware, Plaintiff was not always present at the property.”
FAC, para. 13. Plaintiff further alleges “Defendant knew that Plaintiff was not
always present at the Property. Defendant knew to send notices regarding the
Lease to Plaintiff’s personal address, and/or her counsel, rather than the
Property.” FAC, para. 20. Plaintiff also alleges “Defendant removed Plaintiff’s
personal property…” FAC, para. 23.
 
The FAC alleges
the notice of abandonment was groundless, Kirakosian knew the property had not
been abandoned, and the process of delivering the notice of abandonment was
defective. FAC paras. 42-45. For purposes of pleading, these allegations must
be treated as true. If proven, they would demonstrate the eviction was
conducted in bad-faith, based on a knowingly false allegation that the property
was abandoned.
 
A reasonable
fact-finder could conclude this constitutes malice or an intent to injure. The
claim is supported not just by a conclusory allegation of malice, oppression,
or fraud, but specific facts. 
DENIED.
