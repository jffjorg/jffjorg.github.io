And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is denying the defendant's motion to strike the plaintiff's request for punitive damages. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant tried to terminate the lease, gave insufficient notice of abandonment, and sold the plaintiff's personal property valued at over $100,000. The judge finds that the allegations supporting the request for punitive damages are not impermissibly vague and do provide sufficient facts to support the claim. The judge notes that the plaintiff's allegations demonstrate the eviction was conducted in bad faith, based on a knowingly false allegation that the property was abandoned, and that a reasonable fact-finder could conclude this constitutes malice or an intent to injure.
