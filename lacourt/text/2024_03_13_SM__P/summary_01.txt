And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of United Brands Worldwide, LLC v. D&K Worldwide, LLC et al. The case involves a dispute over a 2013 written agreement and its 2015 oral modification. The Plaintiff, United Brands Worldwide (UB), claims that it is entitled to 20% of the net profits from the property's rental income, while the Defendant, D&K Worldwide, LLC and Danny Suleminian, claim that UB is only entitled to a $300 monthly fee.

The Judge has ruled that the breach of contract claims are time-barred, except for the claims based on the alleged refusal to provide partnership documents and to recognize the existence of a partnership, which are still pending. The Judge has also ruled that the fraud claim is time-barred, but the breach of fiduciary duty and accounting claims are still pending.

The Judge has also ruled that the property has not yet been sold, and therefore the claim for a failure to remit 20% of the profits after sale is unripe. The Judge has also noted that the parties have not presented evidence that the building has been sold yet.

The Judge has granted the motion for summary judgment as to the fraud claim, and denied it as to the breach of fiduciary duty and accounting claims. The case is set for hearing on March 13, 2024.
