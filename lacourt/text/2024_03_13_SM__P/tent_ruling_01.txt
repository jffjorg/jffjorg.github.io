United
Brands Worldwide, LLC v. D&K Worldwide, LLC et al., Case No. 22SMCV00951
Hearing
Date March 13, 2024 
D&K
Worldwide, LLC and Danny Suleminian’s Motion for Summary Judgment 
 
Plaintiff
United Brands Worldwide (UB) entered into a written agreement in 2013 with
defendant D&K Worldwide, under which UB agreed to upgrade property owned by
D&K in exchange for 20% of the net profit after the property was sold. UB alleges
the written agreement was orally modified in 2015, with UB to receive a monthly
$300 fee. UB alleges 20% of net profits from the property’s rental income would
be calculated at the end of each year, with UB receiving the difference between
that percentage and the $3,600 received in monthly payments. 
 
Defendants
dispute the terms of the 2015 agreement, arguing UB is entitled only to a
monthly $300 fee, not 20% of each year’s net rent profits. UB alleges D&K
failed to provide the net profits payment due under the 2015 oral agreement, never
intended to honor the agreement and repudiated the entire partnership. D&K
and its principal Suleminian move for summary judgment on the breach of
contract, fraud, breach of fiduciary duty and accounting claims. 
 
UB
Evidentiary Objections:
Objection
to Fact 1 OVERRULED, 2 OVERRULED, 4 SUSTAINED (irrelevant and prejudicial), 5
SUSTAINED (speculation, opinion), 6 – 11 OVERRULED.
 
Breach
of Contract 
An
action for breach of an oral contract is subject to a two-year statute of
limitations. Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. §339(1). An action for breach of a
contract “founded upon an instrument in writing” is subject to a four-year
statute of limitations. Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. §337. 
 
Under
the continuous accrual doctrine, when a contract calls for a series of payments,
the statute of limitations begins to run for each payment when it becomes due
and payable. White v. Moriarty (1993) 15 Cal.App.4th 1290, 1299. In
other words, “where performance of contractual obligations is severed into
intervals, as in installment contracts, the courts have found that an action
attacking the performance for any particular interval must be brought within
the period of limitations after the particular performance was due.” Armstrong
Petroleum Corp. v. Tri-Valley Oil & Gas Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th
1375, 1388-89. 
 
A
cause of action accrues “upon the occurrence of the last element essential to
the cause of action.” Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Ass’n. v. City of La Habra (2001)
25 Cal.4th 809, 815. The statute of limitations for contract claims is subject
to the discovery rule, under which the statute of limitations does not begin to
run until plaintiff discovers or should have discovered with reasonable
diligence, all facts essential to the cause of action. Prudential Home
Mortgage Co., Inc. v. Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1236, 1246. 
 
Defendants
argue that under the continuous accrual doctrine, the statute of limitations
has already passed for all breaches alleged. They also argue UB’s cause of
action for breach of contract is based on an oral agreement, subject to a
two-year statute of limitations. 
 
UB
argues the breach of contract claim arises out of a 2015 oral modification of
the 2013 written contract, not a new, separate oral contract. Therefore, they
argue the four-year statute of limitations for a written contract, not the
two-year statute of limitations for an oral contract, applies. This misstates
the law. 
 
“[A]
claim is founded upon a writing only when it ‘relies upon the language within a
written instrument or contract.’” JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. v. Ward (2019)
33 Cal.App.5th 678, 686. UB does not argue the 20% yearly net profits
obligation arose out of the written language of the parties’ 2013 agreement.
Regardless of whether the 2015 modification was a new agreement or a
modification of an earlier agreement, it did not “rely upon the language
within” the written 2013 agreement. A claim founded upon the alleged 2015 oral
agreement is subject to a two-year statute of limitations.
 
UB
argues there is a triable issue of fact as to whether the contract is divisible,
arguing it may wait until the entire contract is breached before filing its
claim, rather than being held to a series of limitations periods accruing with
each individual default. UB admits, however, that its claim for breach is based
on an installment contract. UB’s Response to Defendants’ Separate Statement no.
11, FAC ¶15. Therefore, the 2015 oral modification created a contract where
“performance of contractual obligations is severed into intervals[,]” in this
case, monthly and yearly intervals. This is the definition of a divisible
contract -- one under which performance is due at specified intervals. There is
no triable issue of fact as to divisibility—UB clearly alleged a divisible
contract founded on installment payments.
 
Since
the contract UB alleges is divisible, the two-year statute of limitations has
already run for claims based on payments due in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019.
The action was filed June 2022, and payments alleged to be due in those years would
fall outside the two-year statute of limitations for breach of oral agreement.
 
UB
does not present evidence creating a triable issue of fact as to delayed
discovery of any of the breaches of contract. In January 2017 UB and Suleminian
exchanged emails regarding UB’s alleged entitlement to 20% of net rental
profits. Suleminian decl., exh. C. In the initial email, UB requested “a copy
of the books and records” for the property “to view the true profits and to
determine what is the actual 20% due to United Brands.” Suleminian repudiated UB’s
interpretation of the 2015 agreement, stating he was entitled to “$300 a month
between me an [SIC] you,” and “20% of the profit when we sell it,” not 20% of
the total rental profits from the property. Id.
 
Via
this exchange, UB was placed on notice that Suleminian and D&K would not
adhere to the terms of the 2015 agreement as UB allegedly understood it. UB’s argument
that it was not on notice of the breaches until 2020 is insufficient to create
a triable issue of fact as to delayed discovery, given that it does not dispute
receiving the January 2017 emails, which are unequivocal in their repudiation.
 
UB
provides evidence via the Abramov declaration that Suleminian never repudiated
– and in fact affirmed – UB’s right to 20% profits from the property’s eventual
sale in emails and other communications after January 25, 2017. UB Separate
Statement of Additional Material Facts 23-24. This would be sufficient to show
a triable issue of fact as to delayed discovery but for the fact that neither
party presents evidence that the building has been sold yet. A claim for a
failure to remit 20% of the profits after sale is unripe. GRANTED
 
Breach
of Fiduciary Duty/Fraud/Accounting
The
statute of limitations for a cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty is
based on the “gravamen” of the claim – the nature of the right sued upon and/or
the principal purpose of the action. E.g., Davies v. Krasna (1975) 14
Cal.3d 502, 515. Fraud is subject to a three-year statute of limitations. Cal.
Code of Civ. Proc. §338(d). An action or an accounting is subject to a two-year
statute of limitations if the contract was oral and a four-year statute of
limitations. E.g., Jefferson v. J.E. French Co. (1960) 54 Cal.2d 717. 
 
As
stated, UB was on notice by January 21, 2017 that Suleminian and D&K
rejected UB’s contention that it was entitled to 20% of the property’s yearly
rental profits. Suleminian decl. exhibit C. Failure to pay the balance of
profits each year is the gravamen of the claim for fraud. FAC ¶50-51. The fraud
cause of action is time-barred, given that UB discovered it by January 2017 at
the latest. As with the breach of contract claims, the fraud claim is unripe to
the extent it is based on defendants’ alleged repudiation of their agreement to
pay 20% of the sale profits, since the property has not yet been sold. 
 
UB’s
of action for breach of fiduciary duty and accounting, however, are based not
just on failure to pay 20% of rental profits under the 2015 agreement, but also
on the refusal to provide partnership documents and to recognize existence of a
partnership. FAC ¶¶46, 66. UB provided evidence indicating it did not discover
those alleged breaches until 2020. UB Separate Statement nos. 23-24. That
creates a triable issue of fact, allowing the breach of fiduciary duty and accounting
causes of action to proceed. 
 
GRANTED
as to fraud; DENIED as to breach of fiduciary duty and accounting.
