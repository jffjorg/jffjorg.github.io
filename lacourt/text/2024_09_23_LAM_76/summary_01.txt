And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling in a case where the petitioner is seeking to release a mechanic's lien on a property. The lien was placed by the respondent, who failed to execute and record a release of the lien claim. The petition was served by certified mail with return receipt requested, but the judge rules that this is insufficient as it does not include a signed notice of acknowledgment, as required by law. As a result, the petition to release the mechanic's lien is denied without prejudice, and the petitioner must serve the petition and notice of new hearing date in the manner of a summons and complaint, as required by code.
