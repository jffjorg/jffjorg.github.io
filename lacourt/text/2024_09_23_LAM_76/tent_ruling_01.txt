  Case Number:  24STCP02341    Hearing Date:   September 23, 2024    Dept:  76             Petitioner filed a petition to
release mechanic’s lien on the subject property after respondent failed to
execute and record a release of the lien claim.
TENTATIVE RULING
            The petition was served by certified
mail with return receipt requested on August 14, 2024. However, service by mail
is insufficient as to a petition which institutes an action, unless a signed notice
of acknowledgment is returned. (Civ. Proc. Code, § 415.30.) There is no
indication that this occurred.
            As such, the petition to release
mechanic’s lien is DENIED without prejudice. Petitioner is to serve the
petition and notice of new hearing date in the manner of a summons and
complaint pursuant to code.
