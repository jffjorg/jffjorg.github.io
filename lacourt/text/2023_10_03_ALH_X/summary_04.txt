And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the Plaintiff's application for an order for sale of a dwelling located at 617 N. Almansor Street, Alhambra, California. The Plaintiff, Western Sages Foundation, seeks to sell the property to obtain the amount owed to them by Defendant Lan Hua Ku, who operates a day care center at the property. The Defendant opposed the application, arguing that it is procedurally deficient and untimely.

The Judge found that the Plaintiff's initial application did not comply with the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 704.760, and that the Plaintiff's amended application was filed too late, as it was filed on August 11, 2023, after the 20-day deadline set by section 704.750. The Judge also cited California homestead laws and a previous court case, Wells Fargo Financial Leasing, Inc. v. D & M Cabinets (2009) 177 Cal.App.4th 59, in support of their decision.
