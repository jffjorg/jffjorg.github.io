And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling on a motion for summary adjudication filed by defendants in a case brought by plaintiff Johnny Trang against the City of Pasadena, Varoojan Avedian, and Suzanne Stone. The plaintiff alleges that he was subjected to harassment and discrimination while employed by the City of Pasadena. The defendants argue that the plaintiff's claims are based on actions that fall within their duties and authorities as supervisors, and therefore do not rise to the level of harassment.

The court has granted the defendants' motion for summary adjudication as to the plaintiff's second cause of action for harassment. The court finds that the plaintiff has failed to raise a triable issue of fact as to whether the defendants' conduct constitutes harassment under the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA). The court also finds that the plaintiff's claims against the City of Pasadena fail because he has failed to raise a triable issue of fact as to whether the City's employees harassed him.

The court notes that the plaintiff's opposition to the defendants' statement of facts and his statement of additional facts are deficient, and that the plaintiff has failed to properly comply with the requirements of a separate statement. The court strikes the plaintiff's separate statement of additional material facts and finds that the plaintiff has failed to raise a triable issue of fact as to whether the defendants' conduct rises to the level of actionable harassment.
