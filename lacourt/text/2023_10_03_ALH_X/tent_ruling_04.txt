RELIEF
REQUESTED 
 
             Plaintiff moves for an order for
the sale of a dwelling located at 617 N. Almansor Street, Alhambra, California
91801 (“Subject Property”). 
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
            Plaintiff’s
application for order for sale of the Subject Property is DENIED.
 
DISCUSSION
 
            This
case arises out of a dispute regarding back rent. On February 24, 2023, this
court entered judgment in favor of Plaintiff for a total principal amount of
$16,150. Plaintiff now seeks an order for the sale of the Subject Property to
obtain the amount owed by Defendant. Plaintiff filed their initial application
on July 26, 2023, and filed an amended application on August 11, 2023. 
 
            “Section 704.740 is part of
the homestead laws. ‘Homestead laws are designed to protect the sanctity of the
family home against a loss caused by a forced sale by creditors .... The
homestead exemption ensures that insolvent debtors and their families are not
rendered homeless by virtue of an involuntary sale of the residential property
they occupy.’ ” (Wells Fargo Financial Leasing, Inc. v. D & M Cabinets (2009)
177 Cal.App.4th 59, 67.) 
 
            In
opposition, Defendant asserts that Plaintiff’s applications are procedurally
deficient. First, Code of Civil Procedure section 704.760 provides several
requirements for an application for sale, which are to be stated under oath.
Plaintiff’s July 26, 2023, application is deficient because it fails to address
the requirements of section 704.760. Plaintiff’s amended application provides a
declaration that purports to satisfy the missing requirements. 
 
            However,
Defendant argues that Plaintiff’s amended application is untimely. On July 20,
2023, the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department issues a “Notice to Creditor
of Levy on Dwelling.” (Tatone Decl. ¶ 6.) Code of
Civil Procedure section 704.750, subdivision (a), provides:  “Promptly
after a dwelling is levied upon (other than a dwelling described in subdivision (b) of Section 704.740), the levying officer
shall serve notice on the judgment creditor that the levy has been made and
that the property will be released unless the judgment creditor complies with
the requirements of this section. Service shall be made personally or by mail.
Within 20 days after service of the notice, the judgment creditor shall apply
to the court for an order for sale of the dwelling and shall file a copy of the
application with the levying officer. If the judgment creditor does not file
the copy of the application for an order for sale of the dwelling within the
allowed time, the levying officer shall release the dwelling.”
 
            Section
704.750 requires that the application be filed within 20 days of service of the
notice, which in this case would be August 9, 2023. However, Plaintiff did not
file its amended application until August 11, 2023. Because Plaintiff’s first
application failed to comply with section 704.760 and its second application
was untimely pursuant to section 704.750, subdivision (a), Plaintiff’s
application for order for sale of a dwelling is deficient.
 
            Plaintiff’s
application for order for sale of the Subject Property is denied. 
                                                                 
CONCLUSION
 
            Plaintiff’s
application for order for sale of the Subject Property is DENIED.
 
            Moving
Party to give notice.
