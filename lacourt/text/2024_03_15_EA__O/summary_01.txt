Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion by the plaintiffs (Shelsey Mora, Kathryn Reece-Mcneil, and Monique McNeil) to add Andrew Faour, Zain Diab, and Liquorama as alter egos of the defendant. The motion was denied because the plaintiffs failed to provide an adequate showing of alter ego and did not comply with the requirements of the California Rules of Court and the California Code of Civil Procedure. The judge noted that the plaintiffs' analysis was limited to restating the rules of the alter ego doctrine without providing any specific evidence or proposed amendments. The motion was denied without prejudice, meaning that the plaintiffs may re-file the motion in the future.
