 Case Number:  22STCV05079    Hearing Date:   April 17, 2024    Dept:  55 NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS:  Motion of Plaintiff Niki Alexander Shetty to Vacate
Order Granting Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment.
 
BACKGROUND
Plaintiffs NIKI-ALEXANDER SHETTY and ADINA ZAHARESCU
(“Plaintiffs”) bring this case against Defendants Thomas Block and Sue Emrek
(“Defendants”) related to Defendants’ involvement with a loan and deed of trust
for the property at 4351 La Barca Drive, Tarzana, California (the “Property”).
Plaintiffs’ causes of action in the First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) against
Defendant Block are: (1) Wrongful Foreclosure; (7) Accounting; and (8) Unfair
Business Practices. Plaintiffs’ causes of action against both Defendants are: (2)
Quiet Title; (3) Cancellation of Instrument; (4) Declaratory Relief; (5) Violation
of Regulation Z of the Truth in Lending Act; and (6) Fraud. 
On 2/6/24, the Court denied Plaintiffs’ ex parte application
to continue the hearing on Defendants’ summary judgment motion. This ruling
left the 2/5/24 opposition deadline intact for Plaintiffs, who did not file an
opposition to the motion. On 2/20/24, the Court granted Defendants’ unopposed
motion for summary judgment. Plaintiffs now bring a motion requesting an order
vacating the granting of summary judgment, based upon counsel’s admission of
fault for the opposition filed late on 2/16/24. The motion is made pursuant to
Code of Civil Procedure, section 473. Defendants oppose the motion on grounds
including that the Court lost jurisdiction due to a notice of appeal, mandatory
relief does not apply to granting summary judgment, and Plaintiffs
intentionally served and file their opposing documents very late. Also,
Defendant SUE EMREK requests that, if relief is granted under section 473, then
Plaintiffs' counsel be ordered to reimburse for fees and costs in the sum of
$2,384.52.
EVIDENTIARY RULINGS
The Court sustains all evidentiary objections to the declaration
of Mainak D’Attaray, except number 3 that is overruled.
ANALYSIS
Plaintiffs’ notice of appeal of the judgment, filed
4/2/24, caused an automatic stay as to this motion, which seeks to affect the
appeal by vacating the judgment. “[W]hether a matter is ‘embraced’ in or ‘affected’
by a judgment within the meaning of section 916 depends upon whether
postjudgment trial court proceedings on the particular matter would have any
impact on the ‘effectiveness’ of the appeal. If so, the proceedings are
stayed….” Franklin & Franklin v. 7-Eleven Owners for Fair Franchising
(2000) 85 Cal.App.4th 1168, 1173 (citing Code Civ. Proc., §916).
Additionally, Plaintiffs’ late opposition to the
summary judgment motion was part of an intentional strategy to assert the
75-day rule and to request a continuance for discovery, as shown by Plaintiffs’
ex parte application filed 2/5/24, which the Court denied 2/6/24. See, e.g., Jerry's Shell v. Equilon Ent., LLC (2005) 134 Cal. App.
4th 1058, 1074 (mandatory relief unavailable as to counsel’s intentional strategy).
Further, the order granting summary judgment, entered
2/20/24, addressed the merits of the parties’ proof, such that a motion to
vacate does not apply. Section 473 does not permit an escape hatch from a
judgment based upon evaluations of factors. E.g., Henderson v. Pacific Gas
and Elec. Co. (2010) 187 Cal.App.4th 215, 228-29 (Section 473 “does not
include relief for mistakes an attorney makes in opposing, or not opposing, a
summary judgment motion (or not timely requesting a continuance of a hearing on
a summary judgment motion)….”).
Also, counsel’s admitted failing to audit staff’s work
is not a ground to vacate. Discretionary relief under Code of Civil Procedure
Section 473 is not available for attorneys’ negligence in failing to act like a
reasonably prudent person in supervising their employees who err. Id.,
at pp. 228-231.
Next, counsel’s being busy as a sole practitioner does
not justify lateness. Being
busy and experiencing stress in meeting deadlines in the practice of law alone
is not excusable neglect.  Ambrose v.
Michelin North America, Inc. (2005) 134 Cal.App.4th 1350, 1355
Moreover, the excuses for staff filing the opposition
late on 2/16/24, does not explain an opposing declaration filed even later on 2/20/24.
See Declaration Objections, 4:23-26. Determinations
whether defaults were caused by attorney mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or
neglect, involve a credibility issue for the fact finder, which is conclusive
on appeal, when the evidence gives rise to conflicting, reasonable inferences. Cowan
v. Krayzman (2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 907, 915.
As to motions made under Code of Civil Procedure
Section 473, moving parties have the initial burden to prove excusable neglect
by a preponderance of competent evidence. 
Kendall v. Barker (1988) 197 Cal.App.3d 619, 624. Here, there is
no evidentiary support for the motion, because the initial declaration of
Mainak D’Attaray has not been filed separately as referenced on the first page
of the subject motion, and only is referenced in opposing evidentiary
objections. 
CONCLUSION
The motion is denied.
