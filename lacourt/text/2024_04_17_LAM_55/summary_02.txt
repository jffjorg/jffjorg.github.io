And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to vacate the order granting summary judgment to the defendants. The plaintiff's counsel admitted fault for the late opposition to the summary judgment motion, which was part of an intentional strategy to assert the 75-day rule and request a continuance for discovery. The judge ruled that the plaintiff's late opposition was not excusable neglect and that the order granting summary judgment was valid. The judge also noted that the plaintiff's counsel's failure to audit staff's work and being busy and experiencing stress in meeting deadlines in the practice of law alone were not excusable neglect. The judge further ruled that the plaintiff's motion did not meet the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure Section 473 and that the plaintiff's counsel was not entitled to relief under this section.
