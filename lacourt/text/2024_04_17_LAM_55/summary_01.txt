And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment and ordered a continuance to permit further discovery and to file a deposition transcript in opposition to the motion. The court found that there is a triable issue of material fact regarding the validity of the lease and that the plaintiff's evidence is insufficiently competent to shift the burden of proof. The court also found that the defendant's objections to the plaintiff's evidence are well-taken and that the plaintiff's declaration is mostly inadmissible. The court noted that the defendant's declarations contain admissible evidence of admissions against the interests of the declarant.
