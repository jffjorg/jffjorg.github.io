And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The motions to compel compliance with discovery responses and to compel further discovery responses are continued. The parties' counsel are ordered to meet and further confer within 60 days to resolve and/or narrow all outstanding discovery issues. The motion to compel compliance with discovery responses seeks an order compelling Defendant's compliance with its responses to Plaintiff's Requests for Production of Documents, Set One, and seeking monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,860.00. The motion to compel further discovery responses seeks orders compelling Defendant's further responses to various discovery requests, including special interrogatories, form interrogatories, requests for admission, and requests for production of documents, and seeking monetary sanctions in the amount of $11,100.00. The Court finds that the parties have not made a reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal resolution of the issues presented by the motions and therefore orders the parties to meet and confer again. The motions are continued pending further meet and confer.
