RESPONDING PARTY: Defendant General Motors, LLC
(“Defendant”)
NOTICE: OK
 
RELIEF REQUESTED: An order granting Plaintiff attorney fees,
costs, and expenses in the amount of $43,756.73.
 
TENTATIVE RULING: The motion is granted in part.

BACKGROUND
 
Plaintiff
brings this action under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act (Civil Code §
1790 et seq.) for a vehicle she purchased on or around 11/13/20, which was
manufactured and distributed by Defendant. (Compl. ¶¶ 6, 10.) Plaintiff alleges
that defects and nonconformities to warranty manifested themselves within the
applicable express warranty period, including but not limited to defective
audio, body, braking, connectivity, and transmission systems, yet “Defendant
and its representatives in this state were unable and/or failed to service or
repair the Vehicle within a reasonable number of attempts. (Id. at ¶¶
12–15.)
 
On 10/24/22, Plaintiff filed her complaint, alleging
against Defendant the following causes of action: (1) Violation of Civil Code
section 1793.2(d); (2) Violation of Civil Code section 1793.2(b); (3) Violation
of Civil Code section 1793.2(a)(3); (4) Breach of Express Written Warranty; and
(5) Breach of the Implied Warranty of Merchantability. On 11/28/22, Defendant
filed its answer.
 
On 12/12/23, the parties executed a
settlement offer pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 998, settling
entire lawsuit by Defendant paying Plaintiff $64,195.21, plus reasonable attorney
fees, costs, and expenses either by written stipulation or by noticed motion.
(Decl. of Iraida Gonzalez, ¶¶
23–24.) On 1/5/24, Plaintiff filed a Notice of Conditional Settlement of the
entire case.
 
On 6/14/24, Plaintiff filed the
instant motion. On 10/14/24, Defendant filed its opposition. On 10/18/24,
Plaintiff filed her reply.
 
ANALYSIS
 
1.     
Right to Recovery
 
An award of
attorney fees is proper when authorized by contract, statute, or law. (Code
Civ. Proc. §§ 1032, subd. (b); 1033.5, subd. (a)(10).) Here, the Song-Beverly Act
authorizes a buyer “to recover as part of the judgment a sum equal to the
aggregate amount of costs and expenses, including attorney’s fees based on
actual time expended, determined by the court to have been reasonably incurred
by the buyer in connection with the commencement and prosecution of such
action.” (Civ. Code § 1794, subd. (d).)
 
Moreover,
Plaintiff bases the instant motion on the parties’ 12/12/23 settlement
agreement, wherein Defendants agreed that “Plaintiff’s attorney’s fees,
expenses and costs that have been reasonably incurred pursuant to California
Civil Code § 1794(d) may be determined by the Court via noticed motion. For
purposes of any such motion, GM will agree that Plaintiff is the prevailing
party.” (Ex. 2 to Gonzalez Decl., ¶ 3.)
 
Based on
the foregoing, the Court finds that the instant motion is authorized both by
contract and statute.
 
2.     
Attorney Fees Incurred
 
A buyer prevailing
under the Song-Beverly Act may recover “reasonable” attorney fees and costs as
determined by the Court. (Civ. Code § 1794, subd. (d).) “The burden is on the
party seeking attorney fees to prove that the fees it seeks are reasonable.” (Gonzalez
v. Santa Clara County Dept. of Social Services (2017) 9 Cal.App.5th 162,
169.) In determining a reasonable fee award, the Court begins with the lodestar
method of calculation, i.e., the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied
by the reasonable hourly rate.¿(Karton v. Ari Design & Construction,
Inc. (2021) 61 Cal.App.5th 734, 744; PLCM Group, Inc. v. Drexler
(2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095–1096.) 
 
Here, Plaintiff
seeks to recover $40,135.00 in attorney fees, encompassing 98.2 hours of her
attorneys’ time, billed at the following rates:

a.       Counsel’s
Hourly Rate
 
When
determining a reasonable hourly rate, courts consider whether the stated rates
“are within the range of reasonable rates charged by and judicially awarded
[to] comparable attorneys for comparable work.” (Children’s Hosp. & Med.
Ctr. v. Bonta (2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 740, 783.)
 
Here,
Plaintiff asserts that the rates charged by her attorneys are commensurate with
the experience and skill of the attorneys involved, and similar rates have been
approved by courts in the past. (Pl.’s Mot. 8:18–10:6; Gonzalez Decl. ¶¶ 25–48.)
In opposition, Defendant argues that Plaintiff has failed to show the
reasonableness of her counsel’s hourly rates, and that courts have actually
reduced the rates for these timekeepers in prior cases. (Def.’s Opp. 11:18–12:25.)
Defendants therefore assert that Plaintiff’s attorneys’ hourly rates should be
reduced to an attorney rate of $525.00. $510.00, and $400.00 per hour, and legal
assistant rate at $175.00 per hour. (Id. at 14:6–12.) As Plaintiff
argues in reply, “that Plaintiff provided no orders specific to each timekeeper
is of no consequence because the test is whether the hourly rates are
comparable to those prevailing for the same type of services rendered in that
community, not what may have been awarded to one of the timekeepers at a
different time when said timekeeper had a different level of experience.”
(Pl.’s Reply 5:20–24.)
 
Based on
the foregoing, the Court finds that Plaintiff has sufficiently shown that her
attorneys’ hourly billing rates are commensurate with their experience and fall
within the range of reasonable rates charged by attorneys and judicially
awarded in similar cases. Accordingly, the Court declines to reduce Plaintiff’s
counsel’s hourly billing rate.
 
b.      Hours
Expended
 
Plaintiff
seeks to recover attorney fees for the 98.2 hours expended by her attorneys on
this matter, totaling $40,135.00. Plaintiff proffers an itemized list of time
entries detailing her attorneys’ work on this matter. (Ex. 23 to Gonzalez
Decl.)
 
In addition
to the attorney hourly billing rate, Defendant challenges the following
specific entries in Plaintiff’s attorneys’ proffered time log: (1) paralegal
work; (2) time spent on communications; (3) pre-engagement work; (4) time incurred
reviewing Defendant’s answer; (5) time spent reviewing repair orders; (6) time
spent on discovery requests and responses; (7) clerical tasks; (8) time spent
on discovery motions; (9) time incurred relating to the settlement conference;
and (10) time spent on the instant fee motion.
 
i.                   
Paralegal Work
 
Defendant
argues that 3.5 hours incurred by Plaintiff’s paralegals for “ministerial tasks
performed by the paralegal here, such calendaring deadlines and serving/filing
documents” is not recoverable. (Def.’s Opp. 8:7–13.) While Defendant provides some
examples of these contested fees, Defendant has failed to specify all of the
billing entries at issue with respect to this work, therefore the Court is
unable to ascertain whether the time incurred was reasonable. Accordingly, the
Court declines to reduce the attorney fees recoverable for paralegal work.
 
ii.                 
Communications
 
Defendant
argues that 2.5 hours incurred by Plaintiff’s counsel for “routine
communications” should be reduced by 50%. (Def.’s Opp. 8:14–20.) Similar to its
argument regarding Plaintiff’s paralegal work, Defendant has failed to specify
all of the billing entries at issue with respect to these “routine
communications,” and the Court is therefore unable to ascertain which contested
communications were reasonably billed. Accordingly, the Court declines to
reduce the attorney fees recoverable for such work.
 
iii.               
Pre-Engagement Work
 
Defendant
argues that the attorney fees incurred by attorney Anvar prior to Plaintiff’s
engagement as a client are not recoverable “because it appears to be
pre-representation investigation.” (Def.’s Opp. 8:21–26.) Plaintiff’s billing
statement reflects that 0.6 hours were incurred in these tasks. (Ex. 23 to
Gonzalez Decl., p. 1.)
 
The
Song-Beverly act authorizes a buyer “to recover as part of the judgment a sum
equal to the aggregate amount of costs and expenses, including attorney’s fees
based on actual time expended, determined by the court to have been reasonably
incurred by the buyer in connection with the commencement and
prosecution of such action.” (Civ. Code § 1794, subd. (d) [emphasis added].)
Accordingly, the Court declines to reduce the attorney fees recoverable for
such work.
 
iv.               
Reviewing Defendant’s Answer
 
Defendant
argues that the attorney fees incurred by attorney Gonzalez for reviewing
Defendant’s answer should be reduced to 0.2 hours “because GM files essentially
the same answer in all of its Song-Beverly case. [sic] Counsel has seen it
before, and therefore does not require 54 minutes to read it.” (Def.’s Opp.
8:27–9:1.) Plaintiff’s billing statement reflects that 0.9 hours were incurred
in reviewing Defendant’s complaint. (Ex. 23 to Gonzalez Decl., p. 2.) The Court
reduces the hours incurred for these tasks by 0.4 hours, for a total reduction
of $166.00.
 
 
v.                  
Repair Orders
 
Defendant
argues that the attorney fees incurred by Ms. Gonzalez for reviewing individual
repair orders should be stricken as duplicative “since Counsel had already
billed for ‘review of case file in preparation of drafting plaintiff’s written
discovery set one’ as a separate entry on the same day. … These repair orders
are part of plaintiff’s case file. Also, presumably, Counsel had already read
these documents before filing suit in October 2022. Reviewing them again and ‘billing’
an entry for the same work completed, especially when Counsel should be aware
of their contents, serves only to pad the bill.” (Def.’s Opp. 9:4–6.)
Plaintiff’s billing statement reflects that 2.0 hours were incurred in
reviewing these repair orders in depth. (Ex. 23 to Gonzalez Decl., pp. 3–4.)
The Court reduces the hours incurred for these tasks by 1.0 hour, for a total reduction
of $415.00.
 
 
vi.               
Discovery
 
Defendant argues
that the attorney fees incurred by Ms. Gonzalez in drafting discovery requests
and responses to Defendant, meet and confer correspondence, and reviewing
Defendant’s discovery responses, should be significantly reduced because they
are essentially the same as other requests and responses served by Plaintiff’s
counsel in similar matters. (Def.’s Opp. 9:8–10:23.) Plaintiff’s billing
statement reflects that 19.4 hours were incurred in these tasks. (Ex. 23 to Gonzalez
Decl.) The Court reduces the hours incurred for these tasks by 9.7 hours, for a
total reduction of $4,025.50.
 
 
vii.             
Clerical Tasks
 
Defendant
argues that throughout the billing records, there are entries for clerical
tasks billed at attorney rates, and that such tasks should be reduced to the
paralegal rate. (Def.’s Opp. 9:13–15.) Defendant challenges a total of 1.7
hours of Plaintiff’s attorney’s time spent on these tasks. (Id. at
6:7–7:4.) Once again, Defendant has failed to specify each of the billing
entries at issue with respect to these clerical tasks, therefore the Court is
therefore unable to ascertain which contested entries were reasonably billed.
Accordingly, the Court declines to reduce the attorney fees recoverable for
such work.
 
viii.           
Discovery Motions
 
Defendant moves
to reduce the attorney fees incurred by Ms. Gonzalez in drafting Plaintiff’s
motion to compel Defendant’s further responses to Plaintiff’s Requests for
Production, Set One, reviewing Defendant’s supplemental document production, reviewing
Defendant’s opposition to the motion, drafting a reply, attending the hearing
on the motion, and reviewing the court-ordered document production. (Def.’s
Opp. 10:6–23.) Plaintiff’s billing statement reflects that 33.6 hours were
incurred in these tasks. (Ex. 23 to Gonzalez Decl.) The Court reduces the hours
incurred for these tasks by 16.8 hours, for a total reduction of $6,972.00.
 
ix.               
Settlement Conference
 
Defendant
argues that the time incurred by Plaintiff’s counsel in preparing for,
traveling to and from the courthouse, and attending the settlement conference
together was excessive, “as there is no indication that both Mr. Cohen and Mr.
[sic] Gonzalez were required and/or necessary for them to appear at the
conference.” (Def.’s Opp. 10:24–28.) “GM requests that the time for commute be
eliminated completely.” (Id. at 10:27.) Plaintiff’s billing statement
reflects that 13.2 hours were incurred in these tasks, with 7.7 of those hours
billed for commuting to and from the courthouse. (Ex. 23 to Gonzalez Decl., pp.
26–27 [4.9 hours for JC and 8.3 hours for IG; 1.7 hours for JC and 6.0 hours
for IG, respectively].) The Court reduces the hours incurred for these tasks by
7.7 hours (1.7 hours for JC and 6.0 hours for IG), for a total reduction of $3,382.50.
 
 
x.                  
Fee Motion
 
Defendant further
argues that the 6.9 hours incurred by Ms. Gonzalez in bringing the instant
motion, and the anticipated $2,490.00 she expects to incur (approximately
6.0 hours at Ms. Gonzales’ hourly billing rate) in reviewing Defendant’s
opposition, drafting a reply, and preparing for and attending the instant
hearing are unreasonable. (Def.’s Opp. 11:1–7.) The Court reduces the hours
incurred for these tasks by 6.45 hours, for a total reduction of $2,676.75.
 
3.     
Costs Incurred
 
Plaintiff asserts
that she incurred costs and expenses totaling $1,131.73. Plaintiff has filed a
memorandum of costs stating that the cost total encompasses: (1) $523.34 in
filing and motion fees; (2) $150.00 in jury fees; (3) $30.00 in process server
fees; (4) $150.08 in electronic filing/service fees; and (5) $278.31 in other
fees. (4/12/24 Memo. of Costs.) Defendant does not challenge the costs and
expenses in its opposition. As such, the Court declines to reduce the cost
award.
 
Based on
the foregoing, the Court finds it reasonable to award Plaintiff $26,118.98 in
attorney fees and costs, as outlined below:
