And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in plain English:

The Judge has granted the Plaintiff's motion for attorney fees and costs in part. The Plaintiff, Jaime Mata, brought a lawsuit against General Motors, LLC, alleging that the company failed to repair defects in a vehicle he purchased. The parties agreed to settle the case, with General Motors paying Plaintiff $64,195.21. Plaintiff is now seeking an additional $43,756.73 in attorney fees and costs.

The Judge found that Plaintiff is entitled to some, but not all, of the requested fees and costs. The Judge awarded Plaintiff $26,118.98 in attorney fees and costs, which includes $23,742.25 in attorney fees and $1,131.73 in costs. The Judge also reduced the amount of time spent by Plaintiff's attorneys on certain tasks, such as reviewing documents and preparing for a settlement conference.

The Judge applied the "lodestar" method to calculate the reasonable hourly rate for Plaintiff's attorneys, which is the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate. The Judge also considered the experience and skill of the attorneys, as well as the rates charged by similar attorneys in similar cases.

The Judge denied some of General Motors' challenges to the fees and costs, such as the reasonableness of Plaintiff's paralegal work and the time spent by Plaintiff's attorneys on certain tasks. The Judge also reduced the amount of time spent by Plaintiff's attorneys on certain tasks, such as reviewing documents and preparing for a settlement conference.

Overall, the Judge's tentative ruling is a mixed decision, granting some of the requested fees and costs, but denying others. The ruling is subject to change based on further submissions from the parties.
