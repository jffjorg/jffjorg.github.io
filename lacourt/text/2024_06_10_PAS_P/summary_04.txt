And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The tentative ruling sustains Defendant Hsiao's demurrer with leave to amend, dismissing the first and second causes of action against her. The court finds that the complaint fails to state a cause of action, as it does not adequately allege that Defendant Hsiao knew of Defendant Ma's violent tendencies. The court also finds that the complaint does not meet the meet and confer requirement, as Defense Counsel's correspondence was sent to an incorrect email address. The court gives Plaintiff Xu 30 days to amend and file a First Amended Complaint.
