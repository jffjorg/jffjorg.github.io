 Case Number:  23AHCV02369    Hearing Date:   June 10, 2024    Dept:  P [TENTATIVE]
ORDER SUSTAINING DEMURRER WITH LEAVE TO AMENDI.        INTRODUCTION
          In this premises liability action, Plaintiff Jing Yun Xu
alleges that Defendants Anita J. Hsiao and Kuo Hua Ma negligently maintained
9415-9417 Las Tunas Drive, Temple City, CA so as to create an opportunity for
Defendant Kuo Hua Ma to assault her.
          The complaint contains three causes of action: (1) general
negligence, (2) premises liability and (3) intentional tort. The third cause of
action is alleged as to Defendant Kuo Hua Ma only. 
          Defendant Anita J. Hsiao filed a demurrer on February 15,
2024. Plaintiff filed an opposition on May 28, 2024. Hsiao filed a reply on
June 3, 2024. Before the Court are Defendant’s challenges to the first and
second causes of action. Hsiao alleges that both causes of action against her
fail to state sufficient facts.  The
demurrer is sustained with leave to amend.
II.      DEMURRER
A. Legal Standard
Code
Civ. Proc. Section 430.10(e) provides for a demurrer on the basis that a
complaint fails to state a cause of action. (CCP § 430.10(e).) A demurrer tests
the legal sufficiency of a complaint. (Donabedian
v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)  A demurrer is treated as “admitting all
material facts properly pleaded,” but not the truth of “contentions, deductions
or conclusions of law.” (Aubry v. Tri-Defendants Hospital Dist. (1992) 2
Cal.4th 962, 966-967.) The general rule on demurrer is that the pleadings are
“deemed to be true, however improbable they may be.” (Del E. Webb Corp. v.
Structural Materials Co. (1981) 123 Cal.App.4th 593, 604.) 
Questions
of plaintiff’s ability to prove unlikely allegations are of no concern. (Committee
on Children’s Television, Inc. v. General Foods Corp. (1983) 35 Cal.3d 197,
213-214.)
Allegations
need not be accepted as true if they are contradicted by judicially noticeable
facts. (Cansino v. Bank of America (2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 1462,
1474.) 
“We
treat the demurrer as admitting all the properly pleaded material facts and
consider matters which may be judicially noticed, but we do not treat as
admitted contentions, deductions, or conclusions of fact or law. (Align
Technology, Inc. v. Tran (2009) 179 Cal.App.4th 949, 958 [102 Cal.Rptr.3d
343].) Further, ‘ “ ‘we give the complaint a reasonable interpretation, reading
it as a whole and its parts in their context.’ ”’ (Ibid.) Because a
demurrer tests only the legal sufficiency of the pleading, we accept as true
even the most improbable alleged facts, and we do not concern ourselves with
the plaintiff's ability to prove its factual allegations. (Ibid.)
‘“Facts appearing in exhibits attached to the first amended complaint also are
accepted as true and are given precedence, to the extent they contradict the
allegations.”’ (Paul v. Patton (2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 1088, 1091.)
Although a demurrer does not ordinarily reach affirmative defenses, it ‘“will
lie where the complaint ‘has included allegations that clearly disclose some
defense or bar to recovery.’ ”’ (Casterson v. Superior Court (2002) 101
Cal.App.4th 177, 183, Nolte v. Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (2015) 236
Cal.App.4th 1401, 1406. )
          B. Meet and Confer Requirement Has Not Been Met
          The Declaration of David D. Samani is offered in support of
Hsiao’s compliance with the meet and confer requirement. Samani declares that
he met and conferred with Plaintiff’s counsel on February 8, 2024. (Samani
Decl. ¶ 2.)
          However, in her opposition, Plaintiff alerts the Court to
the fact that Defense Counsel’s correspondence was sent to an incorrect email
address not listed for service. (Opposition p. 4: 1-7.) As such, Counsel did
not receive the purported meet and confer until after the demurrer was filed. (Id.)
Consequently,
the meet and confer requirement has not been met. Notwithstanding this
conclusion, the Court considers the arguments raised.
          C. Analysis
          1. General Negligence
A negligence cause of action requires duty, breach
of the duty, causation, and damages. (Antiglio v. Corning, Inc. (1998)
Cal.4th 604,614.) “A landlord generally owes a tenant the duty, arising out of their
special relationship, to take reasonable measures to secure areas under the
landlord’s control against foreseeable criminal acts of third parties.” (Castaneda
v. Olsher (2007) 41 Cal.4th 1205, 1213, internal citations omitted.) Hsiao
argues that Plaintiff has not alleged that Defendant Ma’s criminal act was
foreseeable. The Court agrees, there is no allegation that Hsiao knew of Ma’s
violent tendencies to make the resulting assault of Plaintiff by Ma
foreseeable. (See id. at 1220.) 
Secondly, Hsiao argues that this cause of action has
also failed to adequately allege that she was the proximate cause of
Plaintiff’s assault. The Court agrees; the Complaint is void of any allegation
that Hsiao was the but-for cause of Plaintiff’s injuries. These issues are not
solved by the opposition.
          
2.
Premises Liability
Premises
Liability is a special form of negligence alleged as to property owners.  “To impose liability for injuries suffered by
an invitee due to the defective condition of the premises, the owner or
occupier ‘must have either actual or constructive knowledge of the dangerous
condition or have been able by the exercise of ordinary care to discover the
condition, which if known to him, he should realize as involving an
unreasonable risk to invitees on his premises.’” (Girvetz v. Boys’ Market
(1949) 91 Cal.App.2d 827, 829-830.) 
          Defendant raises the same arguments here as discussed above.
The Court agrees that the complaint fails to allege any facts suggesting that Hsaio
had either actual or constructive knowledge of Ma’s violent tendencies.  
          III.     CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 Defendant Hsiao’ demurrer is sustained as to
both causes of action with leave to amend.
Plaintiff
Jing Yun Xu is given thirty (30) days’ notice of this order to amend and file a
First Amended Complaint. 
          Counsel for Defendant Hsiao to give notice of this order.
