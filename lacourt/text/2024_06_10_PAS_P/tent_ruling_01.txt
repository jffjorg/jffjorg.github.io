ORDER GRANTING DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO COMPEL RESPONSE TO REQUESTS FOR PRODUCTION
I.        INTRODUCTION
This is a personal injury case arising from a car
accident.
 On
March 20, 2024, Defendant Karun Mao filed these two motions to compel. Before the Court are Mao’s unopposed
motions for an order compelling responses from both Plaintiffs to Requests for
Production of Documents, Set One. The motions are granted.II.      LEGAL
STANDARD
“Any
party may obtain discovery by inspecting, copying, testing, or sampling
documents, tangible things, land or other property, and electronically stored
information in the possession, custody, or control of any other party to the
action.” (CCP § 2031.010.) “If a
deponent fails to answer any question or to produce any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing under the deponent’s
control that is specified in the deposition notice or a deposition subpoena,
the party seeking discovery may move the court for an order compelling that
answer or production.” (CCP § 2025.480(a).)
“The court may impose a monetary sanction ordering
that one engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney
advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses, including
attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.” (CCP §
2023.030(a).) Misuse of the discovery process includes: “(d) failing to respond
or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.” (CCP § 2023.010(d).)
Reasonable expenses under CCP section 2023.030(a) include the time spent in
researching and preparing the motion, as well as court time and travel time
spent in connection with the motion. (Ghanooni
v. Super Shuttle (1993) 20
Cal.App.4th 256, 262.) “The court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel an answer or
production, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust. (CCP § 2025.480(j).)III.     ANALYSIS
          Defendant served Plaintiffs with Requests for Production,
Set One on January 8, 2024, via email. (See Borgeson Decl. Exh. 1.) Responses
were due February 9, 2024. Counsel for Defendant sent a meet and confer letter
on March 1, 2024, inquiring after the missing responses. (Borgeson Decl. Exh.
2.) Counsel sent a follow-up email on March 15, 2024, requesting responses.
(Borgeson Decl. Exh. 3.) Counsel for Plaintiff responded saying the matter was
being transferred to another attorney. (Id.) No responses have been
received as of the date of filing this motion. The motions are granted.
          Sanctions[1]
Based on the Declaration of Defendant’s attorney, Jay
M. Borgeson, the Court awards sanctions as follows: 1.25 hours per motion (1.25
hours x 6 at $200 per hour = $1,500) plus 1 hour for the court appearance on
all motions ($200).  Since no oppositions
were filed, there is no basis for awarding additional hours.  The Court finds the hourly rate and time
requested to be reasonable. Defendant also incurred filing fees of $360 ($60 x
6 motions). Therefore, the total award is $2,060 or $1,030 per Plaintiff for
all six motions.IV.     CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
          Defendant’s motions for an order compelling response to
Requests for Production, Set One are granted. 
          Plaintiffs Lisa Zahra and Joshua Sheppard are to provide
code-compliant responses to Requests for Production, Set One within thirty (30)
days’ notice of this ruling.
          Plaintiffs are each ordered to pay monetary sanctions of $1,030
to Defendant within that same time period. 
          Defendant Mao to give notice.
