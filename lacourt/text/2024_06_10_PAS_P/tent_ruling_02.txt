[TENTATIVE]
ORDER GRANTING DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO COMPEL RESPONSE TO SPECIAL INTERROGATORIES
AND FORM INTERROGATORIESI.        INTRODUCTION
This is a personal injury case arising from a car
accident.
On March 20, 2024, Defendant Karun Mao filed
these four motions to compel. 
          Before the Court are Defendant’s unopposed
motions for an order compelling response to Special Interrogatories, Set One and Form
Interrogatories, Set One from both Plaintiffs. The motions are granted. II.      LEGAL
STANDARD
Code
Civ. Proc. Section 2030.290 provides that when a party to whom interrogatories
has been propounded fails to serve a timely response, that party waives any
objection to the interrogatories; it further provides that the propounding
party may move for an order compelling a response to the interrogatory.
Subdivision (c) provides for monetary sanctions in connection with such motion.
(CCP § 2030.290.)
“The court may impose a monetary sanction ordering
that one engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney
advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses, including
attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.” (CCP §
2023.030(a).) Misuse of the discovery process includes: “(d) failing to respond
or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.” (CCP § 2023.010(d).)
Reasonable expenses under CCP section 2023.030(a) include the time spent in
researching and preparing the motion, as well as court time and travel time
spent in connection with the motion. (Ghanooni
v. Super Shuttle (1993) 20
Cal.App.4th 256, 262.)III.     ANALYSIS
          Defendant served Plaintiffs with Form and Special
Interrogatories, Set One on January 8, 2024, via email. (See Borgeson Decl.
Exh. 1.) Responses were due February 9, 2024. Counsel for Defendant sent a meet
and confer letter on March 1, 2024, inquiring after the missing responses.
(Borgeson Decl. Exh. 2.) Counsel sent a follow-up email on March 15, 2024,
requesting responses. (Borgeson Decl. Exh. 3.) Counsel for Plaintiff responded
saying the matter was being transferred to another attorney. (Id.) No
responses have been received as of the date of filing this motion.
          The motions are granted. 
                    Sanctions[1]
Based on the Declaration of Defendant’s attorney, Jay
M. Borgeson, the Court awards sanctions as follows: 1.25 hours per motion (1.25
hours x 6 at $200 per hour = $1,500) plus 1 hour for the court appearance on
all motions ($200).  Since no oppositions
were filed, there is no basis for awarding additional hours.  The Court finds the hourly rate and time
requested to be reasonable. Defendant also incurred filing fees of $360 ($60 x
6 motions). Therefore, the total award is $2,060 or $1,030 per Plaintiff for
all six motions.IV.     CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
          Defendant’s motions for an order compelling response to Special
Interrogatories, Set One and Form Interrogatories, Set One are granted. 
          Plaintiffs Lisa Zahra and Joshua Sheppard are to provide
code-compliant responses to Form and Special Interrogatories, Set One within
thirty (30) days’ notice of this ruling.
          Plaintiffs are each ordered to pay monetary sanctions of
$1,030 to Defendant within that same time period. 
          Defendant Mao to give notice.
