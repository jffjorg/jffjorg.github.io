[2] The court notes that
despite its 2/28/24 ruling sustaining Bo’s demurrer in that Plaintiff’s
allegation that Bo was to pay 50% of the purchase price is contradicted by the
Operating Agreement and that though Bo filed an answer to the FAC, Plaintiff,
perhaps inadvertently, maintains to assert that Bo has failed “to pay his
one-half of the Property's purchase price.” (FAC ¶¶8, 20.)

filed an answer to the cross-complaint.
