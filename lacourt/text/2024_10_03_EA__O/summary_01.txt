The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to quash deposition subpoenas for production of business records. The motion was filed by Wendy Lin, the plaintiff, to protect her personal financial information from being disclosed. The judge has granted the motion in part and denied it in part.

The judge has quashed the subpoenas as to Wendy Lin's personal financial information, finding that individuals have a legally recognized privacy interest in their personal financial information. However, the judge has denied the motion as to the financial records of the various corporations under Wendy Lin's control, finding that the burden is on the party asserting a privacy interest to establish its extent and the seriousness of the prospective invasion.

The judge has ordered Wendy Lin to produce documents as to the financial records of the various corporations, while also protecting her personal financial information. The ruling is subject to change based on further briefing and argument at the hearing.
