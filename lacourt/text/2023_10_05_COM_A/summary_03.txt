And here is a brief summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The court has ruled that the demurrer to the complaint is overruled, and the defendant's motion to strike the claim for punitive damages is denied. The court found that the plaintiff's allegations of fraudulent concealment and concealment of defects were sufficient to support a claim for punitive damages. The court also held that the defendant's argument that the plaintiff's claims were barred by the economic loss rule was without merit. The court concluded that the plaintiff's claims for breach of warranty and fraudulent concealment were not clearly barred by the statute of limitations, and that the plaintiff was entitled to recover punitive damages. The defendant is ordered to answer the complaint within 10 days.
