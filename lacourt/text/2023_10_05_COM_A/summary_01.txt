And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion by the receiver, Ryan C. Baker, to terminate the receivership and approve his final report. The receiver was appointed on September 14, 2022, to abate a nuisance created by the defendants' operation of a business distributing illegal narcotics. The receiver has completed all of his duties and requests an order terminating the receivership.

The defendant, Nora Natarajan, contends that she holds a first priority lien against the property to secure a debt of $330,000. However, the receiver took the property subject to the lien, and any other fees and costs should be allocated as direct liabilities of the parties who created the conditions.

The judge is continuing the hearing to November 3, 2023, to allow the receiver to provide further evidence and declarations to substantiate his request for attorney's fees. The judge is also requiring the receiver to provide information about the reasonableness of the attorney's fees sought by Buchalter, the receiver's counsel.

Overall, the judge is considering the receiver's request to terminate the receivership and approve his final report, while also addressing the disputes over the priority of liens and the reasonableness of attorney's fees.
