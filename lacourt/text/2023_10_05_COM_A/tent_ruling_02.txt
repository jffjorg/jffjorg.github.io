[TENTATIVE] ORDER
SUSTAINING DEMURRER WITH LEAVE TO AMEND
 
I.       
BACKGROUND
      The complaint alleges that Plaintiffs and
Defendant, Bonnie Joyce, are siblings and were co-trustees and co-beneficiaries
of their mother’s trust, the Joyce Living Trust U.D.T 1/1/2002 (the “Trust”). Plaintiffs
told Defendant Bonnie of their intent to sell the real property. Plaintiffs
allege that Defendant Bonnie conspired with the realtor, T. LaRoche, and the
buyers, Alvaro Zavala and 9GP Industries (collectively, “the Buyers”), to
deceive Plaintiffs by selling the property for significantly less than the
property was worth without consulting Plaintiffs. The complaint alleges claims
for unfair business practices, fraud, and conspiracy to commit fraud. 
 
II.     
ARGUMENTS
      The buyer Defendants argue that the fraud
claim arises from misrepresentations made by Bonnie Joyce but no actionable
facts against the Buyer Defendants are alleged. 
      Plaintiffs
explain that their opposition was filed late because of a clerical error.
Plaintiffs are not opposed to a continuance to permit Defendants time to file a
reply. Defendants did not meet and confer with Plaintiffs prior to filing this
demurrer. Plaintiffs argue the complaint is well pleaded. 
      Defendants
did not file a reply brief.
III.   
LEGAL STANDARDS
      The bases for demurrer are limited by
statute and may be sustained for reasons including failure to state facts
sufficient to state a cause of action and uncertainty. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 430.10.) A demurrer “tests the sufficiency
of a complaint as a matter of law and raises only questions of law.” (Schmidt
v. Foundation Health (1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 1702, 1706.)
The court must assume the truth of (1) the properly pleaded factual
allegations; (2) facts that can be reasonably inferred from those expressly
pleaded; and (3) judicially noticed matters. (Blank
v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) The court may not
consider contentions, deductions, or conclusions of fact or law. (Moore
v. Conliffe (1994) 7 Cal.4th 634, 638.) 
IV.   
DISCUSSION
      Demurring parties met and conferred with
Plaintiffs' counsel by letter dated July 31, 2023. (Roy Jimenez declaration,
Ex. A). Defense counsel states Plaintiffs’ counsel advised that he disagreed
with Defendants’ demurrer. (Id. ¶ 4.)  
      While the Court would ordinarily consider
Plaintiffs’ late opposition in the interest of deciding the issue on the
merits, the opposition is nonresponsive to Defendants’ demurrer.  Plaintiffs’ opposition refers to a different matter,
Defendants who are not parties in this matter and involves real property located
at 1952 W. 74th Street in Los Angeles.   The action here concerns real property
located at 13918 South Hillford Avenue. 
 
 A. Demurrer to the second
cause of action for fraud is SUSTAINED. 
      A claim for fraud requires facts
to support the following elements: (1) a misrepresentation, (2) made with
knowledge of its falsity, (3) Defendant intended to defraud Plaintiff, i.e.,
induce Plaintiff’s reliance, (4) Plaintiff justifiably relied on the misrepresentation,
(5) causing damage. (Nagy v. Nagy (1989) 210 Cal.App.3d 1262,
1268. Fraud claims are subject to strict requirements of particularity in
pleading. (Id.) The particularity requirements necessitate pleading
facts showing “how, when, where, to whom, and by what means the representations
were tendered." (Stansfield v. Starkey (1990) 220 Cal.App.3d
59, 73.) The requirement “applies not only to the alleged misrepresentation,
but also to the elements of causation and damage." (Moncada v. West Coast Quartz Corp.
(2013) 221 Cal.App.4th 768, 776.)
      Where fraud is alleged against a
corporation, the pleading standards are even greater. Plaintiff must allege
“the names of the persons who made the allegedly fraudulent representations,
their authority to speak, to whom they spoke, what they said or wrote, and when
it was said or written." (Lazar
v. Superior Court (1996)
12 Cal. 4th 631, 645.)
      The complaint alleges that Defendant
Bonnie affirmatively represented in March of 2023 that she and Plaintiffs would
act as co-trustees, sell the real property, and share the profits equally.
(Complaint, ¶ 30.) Plaintiffs do not allege that the buyer Defendants
misrepresented any material facts. 
 
 
B.  Demurrer to the third
cause of action for conspiracy to commit fraud is SUSTAINED. 
      Civil
conspiracy is a legal doctrine that imposes liability on persons who did not
actually commit a tort but acted in concert with another tortfeasor. To support
this claim, Plaintiffs must allege "1) the formation and operation of the
conspiracy, (2) wrongful conduct in furtherance of the conspiracy, and (3)
damages arising from the wrongful conduct.” (AREI II Cases (2013) 216
Cal.App.4th 1004, 1022.) A conspiracy “must be activated by the
commission of an actual tort." (Applied Equipment Corp. v. Litton
Saudi Arabia Ltd. (1994) 7 Cal.4th 503, 511.) Where
fraud is alleged to be the object of the conspiracy, the claim must be pleaded
with particularity. " (Favila v. Katten Muchin Rosenman LLP (2010) 188
Cal.App.4th 189, 211.) 
      Plaintiffs
do not allege facts to support the formation and operation of a conspiracy
between the Buyers and Bonnie. The fraud claim is based on misrepresentations
by Bonnie to sell the property and equally share in the net profits from sale
of the property with Plaintiffs. (Complaint ¶ 41). Plaintiffs then conclude
that all Defendants “conspired” to deceive Plaintiffs. (Complaint, ¶ 42.)
 
C.   Demurrer
to the first cause of action for unfair competition is SUSTAINED.
      As defined by statute, “unfair competition”
includes “any unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business act or practice.” (Bus. & Prof. Code, § 17200 “UCL”). Its purpose is to protect both consumers and
competitors by promoting fair competition in commercial markets for goods and services.”
(Gutierrez v. Carmax Auto
Superstores California (2018)
19 Cal.App.5th 1234, 1265). 
      The UCL is construed broadly to include "any
unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business act or practice. (§ 17200.) Its
coverage is ‘sweeping, embracing’ anything that can properly be called a
business practice and that at the same time is forbidden by law." (Cel-Tech
Communications, Inc. v. Los Angeles Cellular
Telephone Co. (1999) 20 Cal.4th 163, 180). Because the practices embraced by the statute is
in the disjunctive, “a practice may be deemed unfair even if not specifically
proscribed by some other law.” (Cel-Tech at 181).

      Plaintiffs have not alleged that the Buyer
defendants engaged in an underlying unlawful, unfair, or fraudulent activity. 
 
V.     
CONCLUSION
 
      Based on the foregoing, demurrer to the
entire complaint is SUSTAINED. Leave to amend is proper
where the pleader has not had a fair opportunity to amend, and the defect is
capable of being cured. (Colvig v. RKO
General, Inc. (1965) 232 Cal.App.2d 56, 69–70). Since Plaintiffs have not had an
opportunity to amend the Complaint, the Court grants 10 days leave to amend. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1320.)
