And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The Court has sustained the demurrer to the entire complaint filed by Ronda Joyce, et al against Bonnie Renee Joyce, et al. The demurrer was filed by the Buyer Defendants, Alvaro Zavala and 9GP Industries, and was based on the argument that the fraud claim arises from misrepresentations made by Bonnie Joyce, but no actionable facts against the Buyer Defendants are alleged.

The Court has also sustained the demurrer to the third cause of action for conspiracy to commit fraud, as Plaintiffs do not allege facts to support the formation and operation of a conspiracy between the Buyers and Bonnie. The fraud claim is based on misrepresentations by Bonnie to sell the property and equally share in the net profits from sale of the property with Plaintiffs.

The Court has granted leave to amend to the Plaintiffs, who have 10 days to file an amended complaint.
