And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion to deem the requests for admission (RFAs) admitted against the defendant, Cross-Complainant Tuyen Kim Nguyen. The cross-defendant, Giselle Rodriguez, had served the RFAs on January 5, 2024, and responses were due on February 9, 2024. However, as of the filing of the motion, Rodriguez had not received responses. The cross-complainant claimed not to have knowledge of Rodriguez's underlying claims and did not receive the RFAs. The judge continued the motion to allow the cross-complainant to serve responses. Rodriguez later declared that responses were served on September 16, 2024, but many responses were inadequate. Since responses have been served, the motion is denied. The judge notes that the adequacy of responses is not at issue in a motion to compel initial responses.
