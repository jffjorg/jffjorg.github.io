And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the petitions filed by Hi Point Neighbors Association and Andrea Grano against the City of Los Angeles should be dismissed as moot. The development approvals that were the subject of the petitions were abandoned and voided by the City on September 16, 2024, making the petitions no longer relevant. The judge has considered the moving, opposing, and reply briefs and has determined that the petitions should be dismissed, as there is no longer a controversy to be decided and any ruling would be purely advisory and limited to the facts of these petitions. The judge has also noted that the petitioner has not adequately shown that the issues at hand are likely to recur generally, and that any decision in these cases would be purely theoretical.
