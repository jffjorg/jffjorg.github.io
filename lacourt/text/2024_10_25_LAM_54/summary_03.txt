And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the petitions filed by Hi Point Neighbors Association against the City of Los Angeles should be dismissed as moot. The City had previously abandoned and voided the development approvals that the petitions challenged. The judge noted that the City's practices complained of may not recur and do not involve a broad public interest. The judge found that any decision in the case would be purely advisory and limited to the facts of the petitions, and therefore dismissed the petitions. The judge also rejected the argument that the Court should decide the petitions despite their mootness, finding that the issues in the case do not meet the criteria for deciding moot cases.
