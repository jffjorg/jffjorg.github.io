And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendants' motion to sever the trial of the cross-complaint from the trial of the complaint. The cross-complaint seeks indemnity from Defendant Aspland, who is a tenant of the defendants, while the complaint asserts a claim for nuisance against the same defendant. The Judge finds that the complaint and cross-complaint contain distinct issues that do not need to be tried together, and therefore grants the motion to sever. The parties are notified that they may submit on the tentative by emailing the courtroom before 8:00 am on the day of the hearing.
