English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion to quash the subpoena to Victorian Care Medical Group, a primary care physician of the plaintiff, Sharon L. Anderson. The plaintiff had objected to the subpoena, arguing that it was overly broad and sought constitutionally protected information. The judge agreed, finding that the subpoena was too broad and that the defendant had not shown direct relevancy for the plaintiff's entire medical history or a countervailing or compelling public need for the medical records. The judge also noted that the plaintiff's medical records are protected by the right to privacy and that the defendant had not shown that the least intrusive means of obtaining the information had been exhausted. The ruling is subject to change after further consideration.
