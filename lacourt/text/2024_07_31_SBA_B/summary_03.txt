And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court will order the deposition to take place on a date certain, to be stated in the Court's Order. The parties should work together diligently to schedule the deposition and provide a mutually acceptable date. If they are unable to agree, the Court will select a date and require strict compliance with the Court's Order.

The Court has denied the request for sanctions in the amount of $625, as the Notice of Motion did not identify the person against whom the sanction is sought, as required by Code of Civil Procedure ยง 2023.040.

The Court notes that the parties have taken too long to schedule the deposition and expects them to cooperate in good faith to schedule discovery events. Defense counsel is urged to act diligently in obtaining an acceptable date for the PMK deposition.
