Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to compel defendants to provide complete responses to their second set of discovery requests. The motion is procedurally improper because it does not identify the specific requests at issue and combines six sets of discovery as to three different defendants. Additionally, the motion is untimely as to several of the requests. The respondents have served proper code-compliant responses, and the Court finds that the plaintiff has failed to show good cause to compel further responses. The Court also denies each party's request for sanctions.
