And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on the demurrer filed by Cross-Defendant Janae Nelson to the cross-complaint filed by Cross-Complainants Jayelan Richardson and Aspire General Insurance Company. The demurrer is sustained without leave to amend as to the first and second causes of action, which seek declaratory relief and comparative indemnity. The judge finds that these causes of action are comprised almost entirely of contentions, deductions, or conclusions of fact or law, and fail to actually identify the tortious conduct by which Cross-Defendant contributed to Cross-Complainants' harm.

The third cause of action, which seeks subrogation, is sustained with 20 days' leave to amend. The judge notes that this cause of action has already been accounted for in Cross-Complainant Richardson's answer to the complaint, and that Cross-Complainants should be allowed to amend the third cause of action to provide sufficient facts to state a cause of action.

The judge also rejects the argument that the apportionment of loss sought by Cross-Complainants via the first and second causes of action is improper, citing Jaffe v. Huxley Architecture (1988) and Tech-Bilt, Inc. v. Woodward-Clyde & Associates (1985). The judge finds that the relationship between the parties does not justify the application of this doctrine, and that it would be unfair to require one tortfeasor to bear a loss disproportionate to their relative culpability.
