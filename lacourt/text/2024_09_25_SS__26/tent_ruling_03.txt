ANALYSIS:
 
On November 14, 2022,
Plaintiff Upgrade Grantor Certificate Trust 2019 1 (“Plaintiff”) filed this
action for breach of contract against Defendant Karen Luthart (“Defendant”).
Defendant, in propria persona, filed an answer on February 26, 2024. On June
27, 2024, the Court granted Plaintiff’s Motion to Deem Requests for Admission
Admitted and Request for Monetary Sanctions against Defendant. (Minute Order, 06/27/24.)

 
Plaintiff filed the instant
Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings against Defendant on July 10, 2024. No
opposition to the Motion has been filed to date. 
 
Discussion
 
The standard for ruling on a
motion for judgment on the pleadings is essentially the same as that applicable
to a general demurrer, that is, under the state of the pleadings, together with
matters that may be judicially noticed, it appears that a party is entitled to
judgment as a matter of law.  (Bezirdjian
v. O'Reilly (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 316, 321-322, citing Schabarum v.
California Legislature (1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 1205, 1216.)  Matters which are subject to mandatory
judicial notice may be treated as part of the complaint and may be considered
without notice to the parties. Matters which are subject to permissive judicial
notice must be specified in the notice of motion, the supporting points and
authorities, or as the court otherwise permits. (Id.)  The motion may not be supported by extrinsic
evidence. (Barker v. Hull (1987) 191 Cal.App.3d 221, 236.)
 
While a statutory motion for
judgment on the pleadings brought pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
438, et seq. must be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration, there is no
such requirement for a motion for judgment on the pleadings brought pursuant to
the common law. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 439 [moving party must file declaration
demonstrating an attempt to meet and confer in person or by telephone, at least
five days before the date a motion for judgment on the pleadings is filed].) 
 
Plaintiff’s Motion is accompanied
by a request for judicial notice of the matters deemed admitted in Plaintiff’s
Motion to Deem Requests for Admission, Set One, Admitted, pursuant to this
Court’s June 27, 2024 order. The Court takes judicial notice of these facts
pursuant to Cal. Evidence Code section 452, subdivision (d). (Cal. Evid. Code,
§ 452, subd. (d); Cloud v. Northrop Grumman Corp. (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th
995, 999; Evans v. California Trailer Court, Inc. (1994) 28 Cal.App.4th
540, 549) [holding that the court may take judicial notice of matters that
cannot be reasonably controverted, including “admissions and concessions.”].) 
 
The admissions in the Request for
Admissions directly contradict the denials and affirmative defenses asserted in
Defendant’s Answer. The admissions admit that Defendant registered online as a
borrower member of the WebBank platform for the purpose of obtaining a loan and
as a member singed its Terms of Use. (RJN, Exh. 1, Request for Admission Nos. 1-2.)
They also admit that Defendant entered into a loan agreement with Plaintiff in
the principal amount of $22,504.30. (Id. at Request for Admission No. 4.)
The admissions admit that Defendant received the loan funds and is in default
on the subject loan by failing to pay Plaintiff pursuant to the terms of the
loan agreement. (Id. at Request for Admission Nos. 5, 9.) Finally,
Defendant admits that the Plaintiff has performed all obligations required of
it under the loan agreement and the principal amount due, as set forth in the
Complaint in the amount of $22,504.30, is correct. (Id. at Request for
Admission Nos. 9.)
 
By this Motion, Plaintiff has demonstrated that it served
Defendant with Requests for Admissions that effectively establish the truth of
the allegations in the Complaint, as detailed above. The admissions establish
the facts upon which Plaintiff based its Complaint and that Defendant has not
alleged a defense to Plaintiff’s Complaint in the Answer. Therefore, judgment
on the pleadings is appropriate against Defendant. 
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff Upgrade Grantor
Certificate Trust 2019 1’s Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings against
Defendant Karen Luthart is
GRANTED. WITHIN 20 DAYS OF THIS ORDER, PLAINTIFF IS TO FILE AND SERVE A
PROPOSED JUDGMENT.
