And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the Motion to Vacate Dismissal and Appoint Successor filed by Winston St. Julian, Jr. and Corey St. Julian, the biological sons of the original plaintiff, Winston St. Julian. The motion was filed on April 3, 2024, seeking to reinstate the action that was dismissed without prejudice on March 8, 2024, due to the plaintiff's failure to appear at trial. The moving parties submitted supporting declarations and a certified copy of the decedent's death certificate, which showed that there was no administration of the decedent's estate and that the moving parties are the decedent's successors in interest.

The judge found that the motion was timely filed and was supported by an attorney affidavit of fault, which stated that the attorney inadvertently failed to calendar the trial date. The judge also found that the moving parties met the requirements for reinstating the action under Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b), and that they were entitled to be appointed as the plaintiff's successor-in-interest under Code of Civil Procedure section 377.3.

As a result, the case has been reinstated, and the moving parties have been appointed as the plaintiff's successor-in-interest. The court clerk is directed to give notice of the ruling.
