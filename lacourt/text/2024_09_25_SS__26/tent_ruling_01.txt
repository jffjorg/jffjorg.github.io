Krain v. Grygoryshyna, et al.RENEWED
MOTION TO COMPEL THIRD PARTY TO PRODUCE DOCUMENTS
(CCP
§ 1008)
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Judgment Creditor Andrew Krain’s Second Renewed Motion to
Compel Third Party Production of Documents is DENIED. 
 
 
 
 
ANALYSIS:
 
Judgment Creditor Andrew Krain (“Judgment Creditor”), in pro
per, filed the instant action for fraud against Alina Grygoryshyna (“Judgment
Debtor”), also in pro per, on July 6, 2020. Following Judgment Debtor’s failure
to appear, the Court entered default judgment in Judgment Creditor’s favor on
January 4, 2021. Judgment Creditor filed a Motion to Compel Third Parties to
Produce Documents (“first Motion”) to on September 25, 2023. Third-party Bank
of Hope filed an opposition on November 13, 2023 and third-party Sammy Hakim
(“Hakim”) filed a “Response to Subpoena for Production”, which partially
opposed the first Motion, on December 11, 2023. 

 
The first Motion initially came for hearing on December 14,
2023, at which time the Court granted the Motion in part and continued it in
part. Specifically, the Court granted Judgment Creditor’s request for
production of Judgment Debtor and Hakim’s confidential marriage license and
continued the request for production of documents from third-party financial
entities to March 14, 2024. (Minute Order, 12/14/23, pp. 1-2.) The request for
production of documents by third-party financial entities was continued to
allow for clarity on the question of the marriage of Judgment Debtor and Hakim.
(Id. at p. 3.) On February 9, 2024, the Court granted Judgment
Creditor’s Motion for In Camera Examination with respect to the confidential
marriage license of Judgment Debtor and Hakim. (Minute Order, 02/09/24.) Hakim
also filed an Objection to Third Party Subpoena on March 7, 2024.
 
Following the in-camera hearing on March 25, 2024, the Court
found that “there is a Confidential Marriage License. Date of marriage is
3/5/22 which is after the judgment date of 1/4/21.” (Minute Order, 03/25/24.)
The first Motion was set to be heard on April 8, 2024, but on the day before,
Judgment Creditor continued the matter to May 16, 2024. (Registrar of Actions,
04/07/24.) On May 16, 2024, the Court denied the first Motion. (Minute Order,
05/16/24.) Also on that date, the Court struck Judgment Creditor’s “Amended
Motion to Compel Third Parties to Produce Documents” which purported to
supplant the original Motion to Compel Third Parties to Produce Documents. (Ibid.)

 
Judgment Creditor filed a renewed Motion to Compel Third
Parties to Produce Documents (“the Renewed Motion”) on May 20, 2024. Bank of
Hope filed an opposition on May 30, 2024. On June 12, 2024, the Court heard
oral argument from both parties and then denied the Renewed Motion to Compel
Third Parties to Produce Documents.
 
On August 20, 2024, Judgment Creditor filed the instant
second, renewed Motion to Compel Third Parties to Produce Documents (“the
Second Renewed Motion”). Third party Bank of Hope filed an opposition on
September 11, 2024. 
 
Discussion
 
The instant Second Renewed Motion to Compel seeks the same
relief previously sought and denied in the first Motion to Compel Third Parties
to Produce Documents, the Amended Motion to Compel Third Parties to Produce
Documents, and the Renewed Motion. (Second Renewed Motion, pp. 5:10-6:13.) 
 
When a party
seeks the same relief that was previously denied, it must bring a renewed
motion pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1008, subdivision (b). (California
Correctional Peace Officers Ass’n v. Virga (2010) 181 Cal.App.4th 30, 43,
fn. 11; see also Tate v. Wilburn (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 150, 156-157.)
When a motion has been denied in whole or in part, the moving party may apply
again for the same relief at a later time only upon “new or different facts,
circumstances or law.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1008, subd. (b); see Graham v.
Hansen (1982) 128 Cal.App.3d 965, 969-970.) 
 
Despite
being a renewed motion, as with the first Renewed Motion, Judgment Creditor has
not filed a supporting declaration as required by Code of Civil Procedure
section 1008. The Court lacks the jurisdiction to reconsider a prior ruling, on
motion of a party, where the motion does not comply with the requirements of Code
of Civil Procedure section 1008. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1008, subd. (e); Le
Francois v. Goel (2005) 35 Cal.4th 1094, 1106.) The purpose of this
jurisdictional bar is to protect the Court from repetitive motions. (Ibid.)
Also, the statute requires the moving party “to show a satisfactory explanation
for failing to provide the evidence earlier, which can only be described as a
strict requirement of diligence” the purpose of which is to incentivize parties
“to efficiently marshall their evidence.” (Baldwin v. Home Sav. of America
(1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 1192, 1199 [citing Garcia v. Hejmadi (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th
674, 689-690].) Therefore, the Court lacks the jurisdiction to reconsider its
prior ruling pursuant to Judgment Creditor’s Second Renewed Motion. 
 
Conclusion
 
Judgment Creditor Andrew Krain’s Second Renewed Motion to
Compel Third Party Production of Documents is DENIED. 
 
 
Court clerk to give notice.
