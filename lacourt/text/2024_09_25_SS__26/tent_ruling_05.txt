Martha Delia Anda (“Plaintiff”) filed this premises
liability action against Defendants City of Whittier (“Defendant
Whitter”), Cappo Management XLI LLC dba Ocean Honda of Whittier (“Defendant
Cappo”), Victory Automotive Group, LLC, and Victory Automotive Group, Inc.
(“the Victory Defendants”). Defendant Cappo filed its Answer on December 15,

One, Request for Sanctions and Motion to Compel Responses to Special
Interrogatories, Set One, Request for Sanctions. (Minute Order, 06/10/24.) On

to Request for Production of Documents, Set One, Request for Sanctions. (Minute
Order, 06/11/24.) Plaintiff was ordered to serve verified responses to the
discovery within 20 days’ service of the orders. (Minute Orders, 06/10/24 and
06/11/24.) 
 
Defendant Cappo

opposition on September 10, 2024 and Defendant Cappo replied on September 18,
2024. 
 
Discussion
 
Where a party willfully disobeys a discovery order, courts
have discretion to impose terminating, issue, evidence or monetary sanctions.
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2023.010, subds. (d), (g); R.S. Creative, Inc. v.
Creative Cotton, Ltd. (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 486, 495.) The court should
look to the totality of the circumstances in determining whether terminating
sanctions are appropriate. (Lang v. Hochman (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1225,
1246.) Ultimate discovery sanctions are justified where there is a willful
discovery order violation, a history of abuse, and evidence showing that less
severe sanctions would not produce compliance with discovery rules. (Van
Sickle v. Gilbert (2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 1495, 1516.) “[A] penalty as
severe as dismissal or default is not authorized where noncompliance with
discovery is caused by an inability to comply rather than willfulness or bad
faith.” (Brown v. Sup. Ct. (1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 701, 707.) “The court
may impose a terminating sanction by one of the following orders: 
 
(1)   An
order striking out the pleadings or parts of the pleadings of any party
engaging in the misuse of the discovery process.
 
(2)   An
order staying further proceedings by that party until an order for discovery is
obeyed.
 
(3)   An
order dismissing the action, or any part of the action, of that party.
 
(4)   An
order rendering a judgment by default against that party.”
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (d).)
 
Discussion
 
The Court granted Defendant Cappo’s (1)
Motion to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, Request for
Sanctions; (2) Motion to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One,
Request for Sanctions; and (3) Motion to Compel Responses to Request for
Production of Documents, Set One, Request for Sanctions, on June 10 and 11,
2024. (Minute Orders, 06/10/24 and 06/11/24.) Defendant Cappo served
Plaintiff with notice of the orders on June 12, 2024. (Motion, Sawyer Decl., ¶9
and Exh. C.) As of the filing of the instant Motion, Plaintiff has not complied
with the order to serve responses or pay sanctions. (Id. at ¶¶10-11.) Plaintiff’s
opposition contends that verified responses to the discovery requests were
served on July 12, 2024, however, the opposition exhibits pertain solely to
discovery propounded by Defendant Whittier. (Opp., Labat Decl., Exhs. B-C.) 
 
The Court finds that terminating sanctions are warranted for
Plaintiffs’ non-compliance with the discovery orders. Despite notice of the
Court’s ruling, Plaintiffs failed to serve responses or pay sanctions as
ordered by the 20-day deadline, which passed on July 2, 2024. No explanation is
provided for failing to comply with the Court’s orders. (See Opp., Labat Decl.,
¶7.) This demonstrates that Plaintiff’s compliance with the Court’s orders
cannot be achieved through lesser sanctions. Although terminating sanctions are
a harsh penalty, “[t]he court [is] not required to allow a pattern of abuse to
continue ad infinitum.” (Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128
Cal.App.4th 262, 280.) 
 
However, to the extent Defendant Cappo asks that the
terminating sanctions order also be applied to the Victory Defendants because they
“share an interest with regards to the matters at issue,” with Defendant Cappo,
the request is denied. No explanation or evidence is offered of this “shared
interest” other than that they share the same counsel, and no authority is
cited that any such “shared interest” is grounds to apply the discovery
sanctions order on behalf of the non-moving parties.

Cappo Management XLI LLC dba Ocean Honda of Whittier’s Motion for Terminating
Sanctions is GRANTED. PLAINTIFF MARTHA
DELIA ANDA’S COMPLAINT, FILED ON
