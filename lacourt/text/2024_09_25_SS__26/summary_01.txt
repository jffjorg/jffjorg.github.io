And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied Judgment Creditor Andrew Krain's Second Renewed Motion to Compel Third Parties to Produce Documents. The motion seeks the same relief as previously denied motions, but Judgment Creditor has not filed a supporting declaration as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 1008. The Court lacks jurisdiction to reconsider a prior ruling due to the lack of compliance with the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 1008. The purpose of this jurisdictional bar is to protect the Court from repetitive motions and to incentivize parties to efficiently marshal their evidence.
