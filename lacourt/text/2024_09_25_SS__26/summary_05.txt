And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling grants Defendant Cappo Management XLI LLC dba Ocean Honda of Whittier's motion for terminating sanctions and dismisses Plaintiff Martha Delia Anda's complaint with prejudice as to Defendant Cappo. The Court found that Plaintiff failed to comply with discovery orders and did not serve verified responses or pay sanctions as ordered. The Court held that terminating sanctions are warranted due to Plaintiff's willful disobedience of discovery orders and lack of explanation for non-compliance. The Court also denied Defendant Cappo's request to apply the terminating sanctions to the Victory Defendants, as no evidence was presented to show a shared interest with Defendant Cappo.
