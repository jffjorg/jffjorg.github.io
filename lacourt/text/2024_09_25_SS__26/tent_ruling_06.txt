ANALYSIS:
 
Plaintiff MX3
Glass & Surfaces, Inc. (“Plaintiff”), in propria persona, filed the instant
action against Defendant John E. Andraos (“Defendant”) on April 25, 2024.
Defendant filed the instant Demurrer to the Complaint on June 20, 2024. No
opposition has been filed to date.
 
Discussion
 
The Demurrer must be accompanied
by a meet and confer declaration as required by Code of Civil Procedure section
430.41. “Before filing a demurrer pursuant to this chapter, the demurring party
shall meet and confer in person or by telephone with the party who filed the
pleading that is subject to demurrer for the purpose of determining whether an
agreement can be reached that would resolve the objections to be raised in the
demurrer.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41(a).) The parties are to meet and confer
at least five days before the date the responsive pleading is due. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 430.41(a)(2).) Thereafter, the demurring party shall file and serve a
declaration detailing their meet and confer efforts. (Code Civ. Proc., §
430.41(a)(3).) 
 
The Demurrer is not accompanied
by any declaration, let alone a declaration evidencing a meet-and-confer
effort. Since a meet-and-confer effort is a pre-condition to filing a demurrer,
the Court will not rule on the merits of the Demurrer until the necessary
declaration is filed. 
 
That being said, the Court
recognizes that the Complaint was improperly filed on behalf of a corporation,
MX3 Glass & Surfaces, Inc., by a non-attorney, Mariano Shulman. It is black
letter law that a corporation cannot represent itself in court. (Clean Air
Transport Systems v. San Mateo County Transit Dist. (1988) 198 Cal.App.3d
576, 578 (citing Merco Constr. Engineers, Inc. v. Municipal Court (1978)
21 Cal.3d 724, 729-730).) This rule applies to all entities regarded as
separate from their owners, including partnerships and unincorporated
associations. (See Clean Air Transport Systems, supra, 19 Cal.App.3d at
578.) Accordingly, the Court sets an order to show cause regarding the legal
representation of MX3 Glass & Surfaces, Inc.
 
Conclusion
 
Therefore, Defendant
John E. Andraos’ Demurrer to the Complaint is CONTINUED TO DECEMBER 4, 2024 AT
10:30 AM IN DEPARTMENT 26 IN THE SPRING STREET COURTHOUSE. BY NOVEMBER 12,
2024, DEFENDANT IS TO FILE AND SERVE A MEET AND CONFER DECLARATION IN
ACCORDANCE WITH THE STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS. FAILURE TO DO SO MAY RESULT IN THE
DEMURRER BEING PLACED OFF CALENDAR.
