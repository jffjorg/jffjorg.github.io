I.             
BACKGROUND 
This is a claim
and delivery of personal property action between Plaintiff Financial Services
Vehicle Trust, by and through its servicer, BMW Financial Services NA, LLC
(“Plaintiff”), and Defendants K & K Consulting Group (“K & K”) and Karo
Kaladjiyan (“Kaladjiyan”). Plaintiff alleges Defendants stopped making payments
on a 2023 BMW 1760X, VIN WBY53EJ03PCM73665 (“Vehicle”), and, as the owner and
holder of a first priority security interest in the Vehicle, Plaintiff now has
a right to take possession of the Vehicle. (See Complaint, pg. 3 ¶ 8.) Plaintiff seeks a writ
of possession.
II.          
PROCEDURAL
HISTORY
On July 29,
2024, Plaintiff filed a Complaint, alleging (1) Breach of Contract (2) Breach
of Guaranty (3) Common Count (4) Claim & Delivery and (5) Conversion. 
On August 26,
2024, Plaintiff filed the instant Application for Pre-Trial Writ of Possession
against K & K (“Application”) as well as another against Kalaydjiyan which
is currently set for hearing on November 6, 2024
Defendant has
filed neither a responsive pleading in the action nor an opposition to this
Application.  
III.       
LEGAL STANDARD
“Upon the filing of the complaint
or at any time thereafter, the plaintiff may apply pursuant to this chapter for
a writ of possession by filing a written application for the writ with the
court in which the action is brought.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 512.010(a).)[1] 
Pursuant
to Code Civ. Proc. § 512.010(b), the application must be submitted under oath
and include: 
“(1) A
showing of the basis of the plaintiff's claim and that the plaintiff is
entitled to possession of the property claimed. If the basis of the plaintiff's
claim is a written instrument, a copy of the instrument shall be
attached. 
(2) A
showing that the property is wrongfully detained by the defendant, of the
manner in which the defendant came into possession of the property, and,
according to the best knowledge, information, and belief of the plaintiff, of
the reason for the detention. 
(3) A
particular description of the property and a statement of its value. 
(4) A
statement, according to the best knowledge, information, and belief of the
plaintiff, of the location of the property and, if the property, or some part
of it, is within a private place which may have to be entered to take
possession, a showing that there is probable cause to believe that such
property is located there. 
(5) A
statement that the property has not been taken for a tax, assessment, or fine,
pursuant to a statute; or seized under an execution against the property of the
plaintiff; or, if so seized, that it is by statute exempt from such seizure.” 
(Code
Civ. Proc. § 512.010(b).)
Before
the hearing on the Writ of Possession, the Defendant must be served with (1) a
copy of the summons and complaint; (2) a Notice of Application and Hearing; and
(3) a copy of the application and any affidavit in support thereof. (See
Code Civ. Proc. § 512.030.) 
“The
writ will be issued if the court finds that the plaintiff's claim is probably
valid and the other requirements for issuing the writ are established.” (Code
Civ. Proc. § 512.040(b).) “A claim has ‘probable validity’ where it is
more likely than not that the plaintiff will obtain a judgment against the
defendant on that claim.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 511.090.)   
Prior to
the issuance of a writ of possession, the Plaintiff must file an undertaking
“in an amount not less than twice the value of the defendant's interest in the
property or in a greater amount,” unless the court finds the defendant has no
interest in the property. (Code Civ. Proc. § 515.010(a), (b).) 
IV.        
ANALYSIS
Plaintiff
seeks a writ of possession for the Vehicle based on Defendant’s alleged breach
of the Vehicle’s lease agreement (“Lease”). (See Application, ¶ 14; Declaration
of Donald Skeen filed August 26, 2024 (“Skeen Decl.”).) 
The Court
finds Plaintiff has established probable validity of the Plaintiff’s claim to
possession of the Vehicle. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 512.040(b), § 511.090.)
Plaintiff has presented the Lease, indicating Plaintiff’s right to immediate
possession upon Defendant’s default, including the right to electronically
track the vehicle through the device equipped on the Vehicle, and evidence that
Plaintiff is the lienholder. (See Application, ¶¶ 12, 16-17; Skeen
Decl., ¶¶ 12, 16-17, Ex. 2.) Plaintiff has included a description of the
vehicle and its value. (See Application, ¶¶ 8, 22; Skeen Decl., ¶¶ 8, 22,
Exs. 1, 4.) Plaintiff has also included the required statements regarding the
Vehicle’s location and status. (See Application, ¶¶ 18, 21; Skeen Decl.,
¶¶ 18, 21.) Effective September 27, 2024, Defendant was served as required by
Code of Civil Procedure § 512.030. (See Proof of Service filed September
19, 2024.) 
The Court
further finds Plaintiff’s claim is probably valid and the Vehicle is located at
78 N. Coolwater Rd., Bell Canyon, CA 91307. (See Application, ¶ 21; Skeen
Decl., ¶ 21.) 
Plaintiff has
not filed an undertaking, but the Court finds an undertaking unnecessary. Per
Code of Civil Procedure § 515.010(a), Defendant has no interest in the Vehicle
because the amount Defendant owes under the Lease exceeds the market value of
the Vehicle. (See Application, ¶¶ 15, 22; Skeen Decl., ¶¶ 15, 22, Exs. 3,
4.) Further, Defendant has no interest because they have no equity or ownership
interest in the Vehicle as it is a true lease. (See Application ¶ 23; Skeen
Decl., ¶ 23.)
Based on the
foregoing, the Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s Application.
///
V.           
CONCLUSION
Based on the
foregoing, the Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s Application for Writ of Pre-Trial
Possession. 
         IT
IS SO ORDERED.
DATED:     October 31, 2024
