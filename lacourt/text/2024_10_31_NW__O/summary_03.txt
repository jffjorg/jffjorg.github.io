And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling grants plaintiff Financial Services Vehicle Trust's application for a pre-trial writ of possession against defendant K & K Consulting Corp, Inc. and Karo Kaladjiyan. The plaintiff alleges that the defendants breached the lease agreement and stopped making payments on a 2023 BMW 1760X, and the plaintiff has a right to take possession of the vehicle. The court finds that the plaintiff has established probable validity of the claim to possession and that the vehicle is located at 78 N. Coolwater Rd., Bell Canyon, CA 91307. The court also finds that defendant has no interest in the vehicle because the amount defendant owes under the lease exceeds the market value of the vehicle. The court grants the plaintiff's application for a writ of possession.
