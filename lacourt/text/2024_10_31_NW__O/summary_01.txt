Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the defendant's motion for summary judgment in a personal injury action brought by the plaintiff, Aznive Sarkissian, against Don Chava Foods, Inc. dba La Corona Bar & Grill. The plaintiff alleges that she slipped and fell in the defendant's restroom due to a liquid on the floor, while the defendant claims that there was no liquid present and that the plaintiff's fall was not caused by any negligence on its part. The court has found that there are triable issues of material fact that prevent the court from granting summary judgment in favor of the defendant. Specifically, the court has found that the plaintiff's granddaughter, Christine Sarkissian, has submitted admissible evidence that disputes the defendant's account of the events leading up to the plaintiff's fall, and that the plaintiff has raised a triable issue of material fact regarding whether there was liquid on the floor at the time of the fall. As a result, the court has denied the defendant's motion for summary judgment and the case will proceed to trial.
