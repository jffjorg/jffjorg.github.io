  Case Number:  22PSCV00196    Hearing Date:   July 25, 2024    Dept:  6 CASE  NAME:  Langer  Juice Company, Inc. v. Silly Brands, Inc., et al.  Plaintiff  Langer Juice Company, Inc. and Cross-Defendants Bruce Langer and David Langer’s  Motion for Summary Judgment and/or in the Alternative Summary Adjudication  TENTATIVE  RULING  The Court DENIES Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant Langer Juice Company,  Inc. and Cross-Defendants Bruce Langer and David Langer’s motion for summary  judgment and/or in the alternative summary adjudication, without prejudice.               Moving parties are ordered to give  notice of the Court’s ruling within five calendar days of this order.  BACKGROUND  This is a breach of contract case. On March 2, 2022, plaintiff Langer  Juice Company, Inc. (Plaintiff) filed this action against defendants Silly  Brands, Inc. (Silly Brands) and Keith Davis (Davis), alleging causes of action  for breach of contract and common counts.  On May 4, 2022, Silly Brands filed a cross-complaint against  Plaintiff, Bruce Langer, and David Langer, alleging causes of action for breach  of contract (Co-Packing Agreement), breach of implied duty to perform with  reasonable care, breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,  unjust enrichment, breach of contract (Operating Agreement), and breach of  fiduciary duty.  On June 10, 2022, Bruce Langer and David Langer (Langer Parties)  filed a cross-complaint against Silly Brands and Davis, alleging causes of  action for breach of Silly Brands Inc. operating agreement (against Davis only)  and breach of fiduciary duty.                On May 8, 2024, Plaintiff and Langer  Cross-Defendants (collectively, Moving Parties) moved for summary judgment  and/or in the alternative summary adjudication. On July 11, 2024, Defendant  Davis opposed the motion, and Defendant Silly joined. On July 18, 2024, Moving  Parties replied.  LEGAL  STANDARD  The  purpose of a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication “is to provide  courts with a mechanism to cut through the parties’ pleadings in order to  determine whether, despite their allegations, trial is in fact necessary to  resolve their dispute.” (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25  Cal.4th 826, 843.) “Code of Civil Procedure section 437c, subdivision (c), requires  the trial judge to grant summary judgment if all the evidence submitted, and  ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence’ and uncontradicted by  other inferences or evidence, show that there is no triable issue as to any  material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of  law.” (Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119,  italics in original and quoting Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (c).) “The  function of the pleadings in a motion for summary judgment is to delimit the  scope of the issues; the function of the affidavits or declarations is to  disclose whether there is any triable issue of fact within the issues delimited  by the pleadings.” (Juge v. County of Sacramento (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th  59, 67, citing FPI Development, Inc. v. Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d  367, 381-382.)  DISCUSSION  Procedural  Defects  The Court notes the motion contains  multiple procedural defects that render it defective. First, Moving Parties  combined multiple pleadings into one summary judgment motion, which is  improper. “A party may move for summary  judgment in an action or proceeding if it is  contended that the action has no merit or that there is no defense to the  action or proceeding.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (a), italics added.) “A  party may move for summary adjudication as to one or more causes of action within  an action…” (Id., § 437c, subd. (a), italics added.) Plaintiff’s complaint  and Silly Brands’ cross-complaint are separate actions. (Metro. Transit Sys. v. Superior Ct. (2007) 153  Cal.App.4th 293, 302 [a cross-complaint is to be treated as an independent action];  Westamerica Bank v. MBG Indus., Inc. (2007) 158  Cal.App.4th 109, 132 [“A complaint and cross-complaint are treated as  independent actions for most purposes, except with respect to the requirement  of one final judgment. [Citation.]”) Moving Parties should have filed two  separate motions for summary judgment, one directed at the complaint and  another directed at Silly Brands’ cross-complaint, and paid the separate filing  fees. (See Govt. Code, § 70617, subd. (d).)  Second, Moving Parties’ separate statement fails to  comply with the requirements of Rule 3.1350 of the California Rules of Court. “The  separate statement should include only material facts and not any facts that  are not pertinent to the disposition of the motion.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule  3.1350, subd. (d)(2).) Moving Parties’ separate statement is 134 pages long.  This is grossly excessive, even if many causes of action and affirmative  defenses are at issue. “It is difficult to conceive of a properly drafted  Separate Statement that includes over 600 paragraphs of undisputed material  facts…. Trial courts should not hesitate to deny summary judgment motions when  the moving party fails to draft a compliant separate statement – and an  inappropriate separate statement includes an overly long document that includes  multiple nonmaterial facts in violation of the Rules of Court.” (Beltran v. Hard Rock Hotel Licensing, Inc. (2024) 97 Cal.App.5th 865, 876 (Beltran), footnote  omitted.) The Court does not have the time or resources to read through 134  pages of purported statements of material fact.  Third, the separate statement is rife with immaterial  facts. For example, paragraph 3 reads:  Silly Brands, Inc. has breached the terms of the  verbal agreement for co-packing services with Langer Juice Company by failing  to pay the sum due of $316,821.80 due and owing to the series of invoices  issued by Langer Juice Company, and storage charges invoice of $14,310.00 for  total damages of $331,131.80.  The following further damages are claimed and may be  determined on this summary judgment and or by summary adjudication as not being  subject to any issue of material fact: The invoices of Langer Juice (Decl. of  Bruce Langer, Exhibits C and E) contain a requirement that:  “If this invoice is not paid within 30- days of  the billing date, the invoice amounts will be subject to a finance charge of  1.5% per month (annual percentage rate 18%)”  The interest accrued since the date of breach  [October 10, 2020] until April 2024 is calculated as follows: $316,821.80 x 1.5  % per month for the period from the date of breach [October 10, 2020] until the  present, a period of 42 months would total $199,597.23.  Thus, the damages complained of and to be  adjudicated by this motion for summary judgment and summary adjudication  includes this amount of accrued interest of $199,597.23.  Further damages for which there are no disputed  material facts and that should be allowed and ordered in this motion for  summary judgment and/or summary adjudication are rental amounts assessed by  Langer Juice Company, because of Silly Brands left-over bottle caps (which have  the Silly Juice tradename on them, and thus cannot be used by Langer Juice  Company on its other products), and Silly Juice labels is requested, and was  invoiced back in April 27, 2022 [see invoice submitted as part of Langer Juice Company’s  response to request for bill of particulars, the Excerpts of which is attached  as Exhibit N to the Declaration of Bruce Langer, the invoice is found at  Exhibit C of that Response. The invoice was calculated based on the amount of  space occupied by Silly Brands in the Langer Juice Company warehouse, and  applying that space as a proportion of the total space in the warehouse, and  allocating a matching proportion of the total rent of the Langer Juice Company  warehouse, to arrive at a figure of $14,310.00. No objection to that invoice  was ever received by Langer Juice Company. Bringing the rental forward from the  date of that invoice results in the following calculation of further rental  amounts due: $540 per month times two because my rent doubled to $1080/month  times 48 months equals $51,840.00. This calculation is described at paragraphs  10-12 of the Declaration of Bruce Langer and results in $51,840.00 further  rental amounts due and owing, for total rental amounts due and owing of  $14,310.00 + $51,840.00 = $66,150.00  Total damages requested and not subject to any  material dispute of fact are: $316,821.80 + $199,597.23 + $66,150.00 rental  total = $582,569.03 in total damages.  (Moving Parties’ Separate  Statement, ¶ 3.)              This is far from the only example of such a purported  statement of material fact. The Court of Appeal in Beltran stated that:  Code of Civil Procedure section 437c, subdivision  (b)(1), requires each motion for summary judgment to be accompanied by a  separate statement “setting forth plainly and concisely all material facts that  the moving party contends are undisputed. Each of the material facts stated  shall be followed by a reference to the supporting evidence.” (Italics added.)  California Rules of Court, rule 3.1350(d)(2) states: “The separate statement  should include only material facts and not any facts that are not pertinent to  the disposition of the motion.” Under the Rules of Court, “ ‘Material facts’  are facts that relate to the cause of action, claim for damages, issue of duty,  or affirmative defense that is the subject of the motion and that could make a  difference in the disposition of the motion.” (Rule 3.1350(a)(2).)  What neither the rule nor the statute states is that  the moving party must include in the separate statement every fact they  intend to include in their motion, regardless of its materiality.  (Beltran, supra, 97  Cal.App.5th at pp. 874-875, italics in original and footnote omitted.)  Fourth, Moving Parties’ separate statement fails to  comply with the formatting requirements set forth in subdivision (h) of Rule  3.1350 of the California Rules of Court. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1350,  subd. (h).)  Fifth, the separate statement fails to comply with  subdivision (b) of Rule 3.1350 of the California Rules of Court, which provides  that, “[i]f summary adjudication is sought, whether separately or as an  alternative to the motion for summary judgment, the specific cause of action,  affirmative defense, claims for damages, or issues of duty must be stated  specifically in the notice of motion and be repeated, verbatim, in the separate  statement of undisputed material facts.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1350,  subd. (b), italics added.) Moving Parties’ separate statement does not repeat  verbatim the issues listed in the notice.  Sixth,  Issue Number 29 is not directed towards a cause of action, an affirmative  defense, a claim for damages, or an issue of duty. (See Notice, p. 44; Code  Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (f).) Any lesser issues sought to be addressed on a  motion for summary adjudication require a joint stipulation of the parties and  the court’s approval. (Id., § 437c, subd. (t).) Nothing in the record  indicates any such stipulation or court approval, and therefore this issue was  improperly included in the motion.  Finally,  the notice of motion is 50 pages, due in large part to it containing arguments  throughout regarding each purported issue. This is also grossly excessive and improper,  as it is effectively an attempt to evade the 20-page limit of a motion for  summary judgment or summary adjudication. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule  3.1113, subd. (d).) Moving Parties are also reminded that new evidence filed  with a reply is not generally considered by the Court.  The Court  declines to address any other procedural defects in Moving Parties’ separate  statement or in their motion at this time. For the foregoing reasons, the Court  DENIES the motion without prejudice. (See Beltran, supra, 97  Cal.App.5th at p. 876 fn. 5 [trial courts may permit parties an opportunity to  correct deficiencies in separate statements].) The Court admonishes the parties  to comply with the requirements of the California Rules of Court and Code of  Civil Procedure going forward, and to otherwise be mindful of the Court’s  limited time and resources.  CONCLUSION  The Court DENIES Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant Langer Juice Company,  Inc. and Cross-Defendants Bruce Langer and David Langer’s motion for summary  judgment and/or in the alternative summary adjudication, without prejudice.               Moving parties are ordered to give  notice of the Court’s ruling within five calendar days of this order.
