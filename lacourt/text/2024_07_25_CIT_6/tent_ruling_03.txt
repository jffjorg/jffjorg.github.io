 Case Number:  23PSCV01547    Hearing Date:   July 25, 2024    Dept:  6 Plaintiff
Orlando Garcia’s Request for Entry of Default Judgment 
Defendants:  Wayne Lee and Rayed
Abdulnour 
TENTATIVE RULING 
            Plaintiff’s
request for entry of default judgment is DENIED without prejudice.           
BACKGROUND           
            This
is an ADA/Unruh Civil Rights Act case. On May 22, 2023, plaintiff Orlando
Garcia (Plaintiff) filed this action against defendants Wayne Lee (Wayne),[1] Rayed Abdulnour (Rayed),
and Does 1 through 50, alleging one cause of action for violation of the Unruh
Civil Rights Act. Default was entered against Rayed on August 10, 2023. On May
2, 2024, the Court granted Plaintiff’s motion to strike Wayne’s answer. On May
28, 2024, default was entered against Wayne.           
LEGAL
STANDARD 
Code of
Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a party
has failed to timely respond or appear. (Code Civ. Proc., § 585.) A party
seeking judgment on the default by the court must file a Request for Court
Judgment, and: (1) a brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other
admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested; (3) interest
computations as necessary; (4) a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) declaration
of nonmilitary status; (6) a proposed form of judgment; (7) a dismissal of all
parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application for separate
judgment under Code of Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of
grounds for each judgment; (8) exhibits as necessary; and (9) a request for
attorneys’ fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties. (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1800.)
ANALYSIS 
Plaintiff
seeks default judgment against Defendants in the total amount of $14,524.09,
including $4,000.00 in damages, $8,600.00 in attorney fees, and $1,924.09 in
costs. The Court notes a few issues with the default judgment package. First, Plaintiff’s
memorandum of costs includes $200.00 in investigation fees, which are not
recoverable as costs. (CIV-100, ¶ 7, subd. (c); see Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5,
subd. (b)(2) [pretrial investigation costs not recoverable].) Second, the Court
also notes that Plaintiff improperly included the high frequency litigation
filing fees with the process server fees in the memorandum of costs. (CIV-100,
¶ 7, subd. (b); Reddy Decl., Ex. 2, p. 50.) 
Third,
the Court finds Plaintiff’s request for attorney’s fees in the amount of
$8,600.00 to be excessive. Plaintiff is a high frequency litigant. (Compl., ¶
28.) All this case has involved thus far is the filing and service of the
complaint, a single unopposed motion to strike, and requests for entry of
default and default judgment. While the Court is not necessarily bound by the
limits of the fee schedule for default judgments under Local Rule 3.214, the
Court is not inclined to award the amount Plaintiff requests here. The Court
will not include amounts billed for administrative work such as filing
documents and will not allow for more than 1 hour for appearances for court
conferences and OSC hearings.   
CONCLUSION           
            Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s request
for entry of default judgment is DENIED without prejudice.
