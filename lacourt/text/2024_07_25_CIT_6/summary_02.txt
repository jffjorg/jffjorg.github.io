And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motion to compel responses to Form Interrogatories, Set No. 2, from Defendant Joe Mun Yen Chou. The defendant must provide complete verified responses, without objection, within 20 days of the order. The Judge also grants the plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions in the amount of $585.00, which must be paid by the defendant and his counsel of record within 20 days. The Judge notes that the plaintiff attempted to meet and confer with the defendant, but recommends that future attempts be made by telephone, videoconference, or in person.

The case is a construction dispute between the plaintiff, Yanmin Han, and the defendants, including Heather Lien, Joe Mun Yen Chou, and others. The plaintiff filed a lawsuit alleging causes of action for breach of contract, intentional misrepresentation, and other claims. The defendant failed to respond to the plaintiff's interrogatories, and the plaintiff moved to compel responses. The Judge finds the motion to be well-taken and grants the plaintiff's request.
