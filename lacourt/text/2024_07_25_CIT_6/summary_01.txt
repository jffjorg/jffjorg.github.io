And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment without prejudice. The plaintiff sought a total of $14,524.09, including damages, attorney fees, and costs. However, the judge noted several issues with the default judgment package, including the inclusion of non-recoverable investigation fees and excessive attorney fees. The judge also found that the plaintiff's request for attorney fees was excessive, citing the plaintiff's status as a high-frequency litigant. The judge will not award the full amount of attorney fees requested and will not include amounts billed for administrative work or more than 1 hour for appearances for court conferences and OSC hearings.
