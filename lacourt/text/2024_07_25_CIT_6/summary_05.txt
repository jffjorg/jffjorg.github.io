And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiff, Rebecca Castillo, is seeking a default judgment against Big Al's LLC for violating the Unruh Civil Rights Act. The court has reviewed the plaintiff's request and finds that the damage request is excessive. The plaintiff is seeking $8,000.00 in damages, but the court only finds evidence of one violation on November 8, 2023, which supports a damage award of $4,000.00. The court also reduces the plaintiff's request for attorney fees to $330.00. Additionally, the court notes that the plaintiff did not complete certain requirements for seeking a default judgment. Therefore, the court denies the plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment without prejudice.
