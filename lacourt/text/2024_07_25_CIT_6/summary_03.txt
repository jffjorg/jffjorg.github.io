And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment without prejudice. The plaintiff filed a complaint against the defendants, Wayne Lee and Rayed Abdulnour, alleging a violation of the Unruh Civil Rights Act. Default was entered against both defendants, and the plaintiff is seeking a default judgment in the amount of $14,524.09. However, the judge notes several issues with the default judgment package, including unrecoverable investigation fees and improper inclusion of high frequency litigation filing fees in the memorandum of costs. Additionally, the judge finds the plaintiff's request for attorney's fees in the amount of $8,600.00 to be excessive, given the limited nature of the case. The judge will not include amounts billed for administrative work in the attorney's fees and will not allow for more than 1 hour for appearances for court conferences and OSC hearings.
