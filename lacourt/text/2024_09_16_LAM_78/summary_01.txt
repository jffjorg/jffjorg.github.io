And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the defendants' motion for summary judgment/summary adjudication. The defendants, Los Angeles Unified School District, County of Los Angeles, Los Angeles County Probation Department, and Defendant Does 6 through 100, inclusive, have moved for summary judgment/summary adjudication on the grounds that there are no triable issues of material fact as to one or more essential elements of each of the plaintiff's causes of action.

The court has denied the motion as to causes of action 2, 3, and 5, and granted summary adjudication as to causes of action 1, 4, 6, and 7. The court has found that the defendants' separate statement is deficient and fails to comply with California Rules of Court rule 3.1350.

The plaintiff, LL John Doe MB, has accused the defendants of negligence, negligent supervision/failure to warn, negligent retention/hiring, negligent failure to warn, train, or educate, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and sexual harassment. The defendants have argued that they are entitled to summary judgment/summary adjudication because the plaintiff cannot demonstrate a triable issue of material fact as to one or more essential elements of each of the causes of action.

The court has scheduled an immediate determination conference (IDC) to be held immediately after the hearing on this motion, on September 16, 2024, to discuss the discovery dispute.
