And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Defendant 1460 35th St, LLC's Motion to Strike, which sought to strike portions of the Complaint alleging punitive damages. The judge found that the Complaint states specific facts sufficient to support the Plaintiffs' claim for punitive damages. The Plaintiffs alleged that they experienced multiple instances of substandard conditions, including cockroaches and rats, and that Defendant had actual notice of these issues but failed to respond to their complaints. The judge held that a reasonable jury could infer that Defendant acted with a conscious disregard for the Plaintiffs' tenant rights, which is a necessary element for a claim of punitive damages. The judge also admonished Defendant for failing to meet and confer with the Plaintiffs prior to filing the Motion to Strike.
