 Case Number:  21SMCV01532    Hearing Date:   January 19, 2024    Dept:  I The court will inquire as to why more discovery is necessary
given that the case is over two years old. 
The court will also inquire as to whether the parties firmly believe
that a third mediation session will settle the case or whether the parties
remain far apart.  The court does not
want to know anything about any of the substantive settlement proposals. 
Generally, given the court’s crowded trial docket, the court
does not grant continuances absent a good showing of cause, even on
stipulation.  The court is trying to find
out why this case has extraordinary features that would make a continuance
appropriate.
