Summary in English text:

The Judge is considering a motion by HVC and Cornejo to amend their cross-complaint to name the architect (ROE 6) and the contractor who completed the work after HCV was terminated (ROE 7). HVC opposes the motion, claiming that the cross-complainants were not diligent and that there will be prejudice. The Judge is inclined to grant the motion as to the architect if a declaration from the expert is filed, confirming that no certificate of merit could be given until after the physical inspection. However, the Judge is more troubled by the motion as to ROE 7, the new contractor, and will deny the motion. The Judge believes that the liability would be several, not joint, and that HVC is fully entitled to argue that the new contractor is responsible for the faulty work. The Judge will grant the motion for leave to amend as to the architect, but deny the motion as to AMF, and will allow the parties to proceed with the trial as scheduled.
