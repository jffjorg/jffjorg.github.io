 Case Number:  23SMCV04453    Hearing Date:   January 19, 2024    Dept:  I The unopposed motion to compel is GRANTED.  The request for sanctions of $920 is
GRANTED.  There is no basis for the
defense to have ignored plaintiff’s request for production of documents.  There is good cause for the documents sought
on their face.  Defendant should produce
them.
Verified, code-compliant responses without objection will be
produced within 3 court days and the documents will be produced at the same
time.  Sanctions of $920 are awarded
against defendant (not counsel), payable within 15 calendar days.  The court notes that plaintiff sought no time
for a reply and thus no reduction in fees would be appropriate.
