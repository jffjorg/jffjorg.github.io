 Case Number:  23SMCV03513    Hearing Date:   January 19, 2024    Dept:  I DENIED.  The proper
procedure for this sort of interpleader is 386(b), which requires a
cross-complaint and that all claimants be named and served.  Here, Trosclair, who defendant contends has a
claim, is not a party.  That is fatal to
the motion.  Defendant ought to name
Trosclair and then implead the money by way of cross-action.  Trosclair might elect to forego the fund,
which will end the litigation.  This
ought not be construed as an indication that plaintiff is entitled to the
funds.  The court is not required to make
any such finding and does not do so.
The objections are OVERRULED.
