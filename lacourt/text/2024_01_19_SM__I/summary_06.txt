Summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses a motion to compel, which has been partially mooted by agreements between the parties. The remaining issues concern the production of documents related to Topic 3 of the PMK deposition and RFP 2, and RFP 21-24, which are requests for policies and procedures. The judge agrees with the plaintiff that defendant has not made a sufficient showing to justify the refusal to produce these documents, which are not confidential. The judge also rules on two other categories of documents: Incident Reports and Unusual Occurrence Reports, which are protected by Evidence Code section 1157. The judge allows defendant to assert the privilege and log the documents, but notes that the dominant purpose test must be applied to determine whether the documents are privileged. The judge also denies defendant's claim of attorney-client work product material, pending further deposition testimony. The judge orders that all promised documents and the log be produced in 2 court days, and allows a further motion to compel based on the deposition.
