And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge is reviewing a motion to file allegedly confidential material under seal. The material includes personnel information and personal contact information, as well as employment terms. The defendants argue that the material was properly filed on October 27, 2023, while the plaintiff claims that it was not. The Judge is requiring a further supporting declaration to establish the factual bases for the McGuan test, which requires a showing of an overriding interest that overcomes the public's interest in access. The Judge is also requesting a courtesy copy of the unredacted materials with the redactions clearly marked, and will set a hearing date to allow the parties to argue the matter.
