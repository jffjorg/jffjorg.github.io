Defendant 1516
  Hobart Investments, LP’s Demurrer to Complaint; and
Defendant 1516
  Hobart Investments, LP’s Motion to Strike Portions of Complaint.



 
Background
Plaintiff Samantha Chapman sues
Defendants 1516 Hobart Investments, LP, Concord Real Estate, and Does 1 through
50 pursuant to a May 1, 2023 Complaint alleging claims of (1) Breach of
Warranty of Habitability (Violation of Civil Code § 1941.1), (2) Breach of
Warranty of Habitability (Health & Safety Code § 17920.3), (3) Breach of
Warranty of Habitability (Violation of Civil Code § 1942.4), (4) Negligence -
Premises Liability, (5) Nuisance, (6) Intentional Infliction of Emotional
Distress, (7) Breach of Contract, (8) Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment,
and (9) Fraud/Deceit/Intentional Misrepresentations of Fact.
The claims arise from allegations
that Plaintiff Chapman leased residential premises from Defendants—1516 N.
Hobart Blvd., Unit 301, Los Angeles, CA 90027 (Premises)—and that during her
tenancy, Plaintiff has experienced various uninhabitable conditions, which
Defendants have failed to remediate despite notice. The conditions include but
are not limited to mold infestations, vermin infestations, massive water
intrusions that caused damage to Plaintiff’s unit, and defects relating to waterproofing,
weather protection, window sealing, gas facilities, electrical systems, toilet
and bath, and smoke and carbon monoxide detectors. Plaintiff has alleged varied
forms of physical and emotional harm as a result.
On August 2, 2023, Defendant 1516
Hobart Investments, LP (1516 Hobart) demurred to the Complaint’s first to third
and fifth to ninth causes of action.
That same day, 1516 Hobart moved to
strike punitive damages and attorney’s fees from the Complaint.
On October 20, 2023, Plaintiff
Chapman opposed the demurrer and motion to strike.
On October 26, 2023, 1516 Hobart
replied to the oppositions.
The demurrer and motion to strike
are now before the Court.
 
Demurrer
Demurrer Sufficiency Standard
A demurrer for sufficiency tests
whether the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007)
147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747; see Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e).) This
device can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the
pleading under attack or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially
noticeable. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) To sufficiently allege a cause of action, a complaint must
allege all the ultimate facts—that is, the facts needed to establish each element
of the cause of action pleaded. (Committee on Children’s Television, Inc. v.
General Foods Corp. (1983) 35 Cal.3d 197, 212, superseded by statute as
stated in Branick v. Downey Savings & Loan Assn. (2006) 39 Cal.4th
235, 242.) Thus, “[t]o survive a [general] demurrer, the complaint need
only allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action; each evidentiary fact
that might eventually form part of the plaintiff’s proof need not be alleged.”
(C.A. v. William S. Hart Union High School Dist. (2012) 53 Cal.4th 861,
872.) In testing the sufficiency of the cause of action, the demurrer admits
the truth of all material facts properly pleaded. (Aubry v. Tri-City
Hospital Dist. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 966-67.) A demurrer, however, “does
not admit contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law.” (Daar v.
Yellow Cab Co. (1967) 67 Cal.2d 695, 713.) When considering demurrers,
courts read the allegations liberally and in context. (Taylor v. City of Los
Angeles Dept. of Water and Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228,
disapproved on other grounds, Jones v. Lodge at Torrey Pines Partnership
(2008) 42 Cal.4th 1158, 1162.) The face of the complaint includes exhibits
attached to the complaint. (Frantz v. Blackwell (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d
91, 94.) If facts appearing in the exhibits contradict those alleged, the facts
in the exhibits take precedence. (Holland v. Morse Diesel Intern., Inc.
(2001) 86 Cal.App.4th 1443, 1447, superseded by statute on other grounds as
stated in White v. Cridlebaugh (2009) 178 Cal.App.4th 506, 521.)
Uncertainty Legal Standard 
A demurrer to a pleading lies where
the pleading is uncertain, ambiguous, or unintelligible. (Code Civ. Proc. §
430.10, subd. (f).) “A demurrer for uncertainty is strictly construed, even
where a complaint is in some respects uncertain, because ambiguities can be
clarified under modern discovery procedures.” (Khoury v. Maly’s of
California, Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616, disapproved on other
grounds in Quelimane Co. v. Stewart Title Guar. Co. (1998) 19 Cal.4th
26, 46 [holding claims for unfair business practices need not be pled
specifically, impliedly disapproving Khoury].) As a result, a special
demurrer for uncertainty is not intended to reach failure to incorporate
sufficient facts in the pleading but is directed only at uncertainty existing
in the allegations already made. (People v. Taliaferro (1957) 149
Cal.App.2d 822, 825, disapproved on other grounds in Jefferson v. J.E.
French Co. (1960) 54 Cal.2d 717, 719-720 [statute of limitations question].)
Where complaint is sufficient to state a cause of action and to apprise
defendant of issues he is to meet, it is not properly subject to a special
demurrer for uncertainty. (See ibid.; see also Gressley v. Williams
(1961) 193 Cal.App.2d 636, 643 [“A special demurrer [for uncertainty] should be
overruled where the allegations of the complaint are sufficiently clear to
apprise the defendant of the issues which he is to meet”].)
I.
Complaint,
First to Third Causes of Action [Breach of Warranty of Habitability (Violation
of Civil Code § 1941.1), Breach of Warranty of Habitability (Health &
Safety Code § 17920.3), Breach of Warranty of Habitability (Violation of Civil
Code § 1942.4)]: OVERRULED.
The
Complaint’s first to third causes of action allege Breach of Warranty of
Habitability under three different statutory sections. (Complaint, ¶¶ 67-89,
90-94, 95-105.)
 In its demurrer, 1516 Hobart argues that the
Complaint insufficiently alleges the existence of a landlord-tenant
relationship pursuant to a residential lease, which is a necessary component of
the first to third causes of action. In one instance, 1516 Hobart argues that
there is no “evidence” of a lease agreement. 1516 generally seeks “the exact
date the alleged leasehold began, the actual parties to the agreement, or the
terms governing Plaintiff’s tenancy.” (Demurrer, pp. 6-7.)
In
opposition, Plaintiff argues that she has alleged sufficient ultimate facts to
support the existence of a landlord-tenant relationship and that the Complaint
specifically alleges that Plaintiff executed a multi-page, written standard
residential lease agreements for Plaintiff’s tenancy at the Premises. Plaintiff
also argues that she has sufficiently alleged the statutory prerequisites for
violations of the three statutes from which the first to third causes of action
arise. (Demurrer Opp’n, pp. 4-6.)
In
reply, 1516 Hobart Investments reiterates its position on demurrer. (Demurrer Reply,
p. 4.)

The Court finds in favor of
Plaintiff Chapman.
Plaintiff Chapman points at a
paragraph in the Complaint that explicitly alleges the execution of a
residential lease agreement. (See FAC, ¶ 22.) Plaintiff otherwise establishes a
landlord-tenant relationship through its allegations relating to the
relationship between the parties. The Complaint alleges causes of action
arising from statutes dealing with landlord-tenant relationships, as well as
allegations that Plaintiff informed Defendants of uninhabitable conditions in
the Premises.
1516 Hobart appears to instead want
a copy of the lease agreement attached to the pleadings or the allegation of
specific terms in the lease agreement. However, the Court notes that the breach
of habitability claims advanced by Plaintiff arise from statutes involving a
landlord-tenant relationship. The specific terms of the agreement are not an
element of these causes of action. Instead, sufficient facts supporting the
existence of a landlord-tenant relationship are what must be alleged, which the
Complaint successfully does.
It is true that a contract must be
pled verbatim in the body of the complaint, be attached to the complaint and
incorporated by reference, or be pleaded according to its legal effect. (Construction
Protective Services, Inc. v. TIG Specialty Ins. Co. (2002) 29 Cal.4th 189,
198-99 [“In an action based on a written contract, a plaintiff may plead the
legal effect of the contract rather than its precise language.”]; Bowden v.
Robinson (1977) 67 Cal.App.3d 705, 718.) “In order to plead a contract by
its legal effect, plaintiff must ‘allege the substance of its relevant terms.’”
(Heritage Pacific Financial, LLC v. Monroy (2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 972,
993.)
However, the first three causes of
action are not claims of breach of contract. They are instead premised on
violations of the Civil Code and the Health and Safety Code. Even if they were,
the Court finds below that the Plaintiff has adequately pled the legal effect
of the contract in its discussion of the seventh cause of action for breach of
contract. While the actual document is of course relevant, it can be sought in
discovery and need not be attached.
1516 Hobart’s demurrer is thus
OVERRULED as to the Complaint’s first to third causes of action.
II.
Complaint, Fifth Cause of
Action, Nuisance: OVERRULED.
“Anything
which is injurious to health, including, but not limited to, the illegal sale
of controlled substances, or is indecent or offensive to the senses, or an
obstruction to the free use of property, so as to interfere with the
comfortable enjoyment of life or property, or unlawfully obstructs the free
passage or use, in the customary manner, of any navigable lake, or river, bay,
stream, canal, or basin, or any public park, square, street, or highway, is a
nuisance.” (Civ.
Code § 3479.)

The Complaint’s fifth cause of
action alleges nuisance against Defendants based on the uninhabitable
conditions on the Premises discussed above violating Civil Code section 3479. (Complaint,
¶¶ 117-128.)
In its demurrer, 1516 Hobart argues
that the nuisance claim is duplicative of the fourth cause of action for
negligence. (Demurrer, p. 8.)
In opposition, Plaintiff argues
that the fifth cause of action has an intent element to it, which makes it
stands separate and apart from the fourth cause of action. Plaintiff also
argues that nuisance is not duplicative of negligence here. (Demurrer Opp’n,
pp. 6-7.)
In reply, 1516 Hobart Investments
reiterates its position on demurrer. (Demurrer Reply, pp. 4-5.)
The Court finds in favor of
Plaintiff Chapman.
“Given ‘the broad definition of
nuisance,’ the independent viability of a nuisance cause of action ‘depends on
the facts of each case.’ (El Escorial Owners’ Assn. v. DLC Plastering, Inc.
(2007) 154 Cal.App.4th 1337, 1348[] ….) ‘Where negligence and nuisance causes
of action rely on the same facts about lack of due care, the nuisance claim is
a negligence claim.’ (Id. at p. 1349[] ….) The nuisance claim ‘stands or
falls with the determination of the negligence cause of action’ in such cases.
(Pamela W. v. Millsom [(1994)] 25 Cal.App.4th [950,] 954, fn. 1[] ….)” (Melton
v. Boustred (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 521, 542.)
Here, the fifth cause of action
alleges nuisance based on what could be negligent or intentional behavior on
the part of 1516 Hobart. (See, e.g., Complaint, ¶¶ 127 [willful conduct
allegation, which supports not only punitive damages, but also intentional
nuisance]; Stoiber v. Honeychuck (1980) 101 Cal.App.3d 903, 920 [“A
nuisance may be either a negligent or an intentional tort”].) Because the
nuisance claim has an intentional nuisance component to it, the claim goes
beyond the same facts supporting the fourth cause of action for negligence.
Facts relating to negligence are necessarily different from facts relating to
intentional conduct, which has a state of mind component to it. The nuisance
claim is therefore not duplicative of the negligence claim alleged as the
fourth cause of action. 
Moreover, to the extent the fourth
cause of action also involves a negligence component through incorporation of
prior allegations in the Complaint, a demurrer cannot be sustained to that
component because a demurrer must dispose of a cause of action in its entirety.
(Kong v. City of Hawaiian Gardens Redevelopment
Agency (2002) 108 Cal.App.4th 1028, 1047.) Here, the intentional
nuisance component of the fifth cause of action survives a duplicative pleading
challenge on demurrer. The negligence portion therefore survives as well.
Instead, a motion to strike was the proper procedural vehicle for such relief
because motions to strike reach defects in a pleading that are not subject to
demurrer. (Pierson v. Sharp Memorial Hospital, Inc. (1989) 216
Cal.App.3d 340, 342.)
1516 Hobart’s demurrer is thus
OVERRULED as to the Complaint’s fifth cause of action.
III.
Complaint, Sixth Cause of
Action, Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress: OVERRULED.
“A cause of action for intentional
infliction of emotional distress exists when there is ‘(1) extreme and
outrageous conduct by the defendant with the intention of causing, or reckless
disregard of the probability of causing, emotional distress; (2) the plaintiff’s
suffering severe or extreme emotional distress; and (3) actual and proximate
causation of the emotional distress by the defendant’s outrageous conduct.’ A
defendant’s conduct is ‘outrageous’ when it is so ‘extreme as to exceed all
bounds of that usually tolerated in a civilized community.’ And the defendant’s
conduct must be ‘intended to inflict injury or engaged in with the realization
that injury will result.’” (Hughes v. Pair (2009) 46 Cal.4th 1035,
1050-1051.)
The Complaint’s sixth cause of
action alleges that “Defendants’ conduct in dealing with Plaintiff, in their
failure to take reasonable measures to eliminate all sewage backup,
contaminated waste water, mold contamination, and to remediate the toxic mold
contamination, was so extreme and outrageous as to go beyond all bounds of
decency.” (Complaint, ¶ 130; see also Complaint, ¶¶ 129-134.) The Complaint
also incorporates prior defective condition allegations in the Complaint.
(Complaint, ¶ 129.)
In its demurrer, 1516 Hobart argues
that Plaintiff Chapman makes a mere allegation that she suffered severe
emotional distress, without facts indicating the nature or extent of any mental
suffering resulting from the defendant’s alleged outrageous conduct. 1516
Hobart also argues that the alleged conduct is not outrageous because this is a
simple habitability action sounding in negligence, and that its conduct is not
severe, as based on boilerplate allegations and buzzwords of emotional
distress. (Demurrer, pp. 8-10.)
In opposition, Plaintiff Chapman
argues that 1516 Hobart’s conduct, as alleged in the Complaint, is extreme and
outrageous beyond the bounds of decency, citing to paragraphs 130 and 132 of
the Complaint in support. Plaintiff also argues that the Complaint alleges
emotional distress, discomfort, and annoyance resulting from 1516 Hobart’s
conduct. (Demurrer Opp’n, pp. 7-8.)
In reply, 1516 Hobart Investments
reiterates its position on demurrer. (Demurrer Reply, p. 5.)
The Court finds in favor of
Plaintiff Chapman.
In Stoiber v. Honeychuck, supra,
101 Cal.App.3d at p. 922, the Court held that a tenant had stated sufficient
facts to allege a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress in a sufficiently
similar case. There, the tenant alleged a defendant’s knowing, intentional and
willful failure to correct defective conditions of the premises. The conditions
were not merely inconvenient, but unhealthy and unsafe: leaking of sewage,
defective and dangerous electrical wiring, structural weaknesses in the wall,
deteriorated flooring, falling ceiling, leaking roof, dilapidated doors, broken
windows. (Id. at p. 912.) In the face of such allegations, the Court
said that whether these met the standard of extreme and outrageous conduct
sufficient for an IIED claim was a factual question for the trier of fact. (Id.
at p. 922.) 
Here, the Complaint sufficiently
alleges the knowing and willful failure to correct defective conditions on the
Premises, including failure to remediate sewage backup, contaminated wastewater,
and mold contamination. (See, e.g., Complaint, ¶¶ 123 [defective conditions],
127 [willfulness], 129 [incorporation into sixth cause of action], 130
[defective conditions redux].)
Moreover, the Complaint sufficiently
alleges emotional distress. (Complaint, ¶¶ 12, 129.)
1516 Hobart’s demurrer is thus
OVERRULED as to the Complaint’s sixth cause of action.
IV.
Complaint, Seventh Cause of
Action, Breach of Contract: OVERRULED.
“A contract is a voluntary and
lawful agreement, by competent parties, for a good consideration, to do or not
to do a specified thing.” (Robinson v. Magee (1858) 9 Cal. 81, 83.) “To
prevail on a cause of action for breach of contract, the plaintiff must prove
(1) the contract, (2) the plaintiff’s performance of the contract or excuse for
nonperformance, (3) the defendant’s breach, and (4) the resulting damage to the
plaintiff.” (Richman v. Hartley (2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 1182, 1186.) Implicit in the element of damage is that the defendant’s
breach caused the plaintiff’s damage.” (Troyk v. Farmers Group, Inc.
(2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 1305, 1352, italics omitted.)
The Complaint alleges breach of a
lease agreement between the parties based on Defendants’ failure to provide
habitable premises and failure to repair, maintain, and remediate uninhabitable
conditions. (Complaint, ¶¶ 139-140; see Complaint, ¶¶ 135-143.)
In its demurrer, 1516 Hobart argues
that the breach of contract claim fails to comply with the pleading conventions
applicable to contract claims, e.g., fails to allege the exact date the alleged
leasehold began, the actual parties to the agreement, or the terms governing
Plaintiff’s tenancy. (Demurrer, pp. 6-7.)
In opposition, Plaintiff Chapman
argues that she has alleged all the elements of a breach of contract claim,
including the statutory duty to keep Premises habitable. (Demurrer Opp’n, pp.
8-9.)
In reply, 1516 Hobart Investments
reiterates its position on demurrer. (Demurrer Reply, pp. 2-4.)
The Court finds in favor of
Plaintiff Chapman.
The Complaint alleges entry into a
contract, Plaintiff’s timely payment of rent, Defendants’ failure to “provide
Plaintiff with a habitable residence that was compliant with legal
requirements, and failing to repair, maintain, and remediate the non-compliant
aspects of the Premises,” and damages. (Complaint, ¶¶ 98 [Plaintiff timely paid
rent], 135 [incorporation of prior allegations], 139 [quoted language], 142-143
[damages].) Even though the lease agreement itself is not attached to the
Complaint, its legal effect is, including the term that Defendants were provide
habitable Premises in relation to Plaintiff’s lease. (Heritage Pacific
Financial, LLC v. Monroy, supra, 215 Cal.App.4th at p. 993 [“In
order to plead a contract by its legal effect, plaintiff must ‘allege the
substance of its relevant terms’”].)
1516 Hobart’s demurrer is thus
OVERRULED as to the Complaint’s seventh cause of action.
V.
Complaint, Eighth Cause of
Action, Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment: OVERRULED.
The implied covenant of quiet
enjoyment implies a term in a contract, and breach of the covenant gives rise
to an action in contract. (Ginsberg v. Gamson (2012) 205 Cal.App.4th
873, 896.) The implied covenant of quiet enjoyment is breached when there is an
eviction, actual or constructive, of the tenant. (Marchese v. Standard
Realty & Dev. Co. (1977) 74 Cal.App.3d 142, 148.) Actual eviction
occurs when there is an expulsion or ouster of the tenant by the landlord. (Giraud
v. Milovich (1938) 29 Cal.App.2d 543.) Constructive eviction occurs when
there is a substantial and material interference with the tenant’s beneficial
use and enjoyment of the premises, causing the tenant to either vacate the
premises (Stoiber v. Honeychuck, supra, 101 Cal.App.3d at p. 926),
or elect to stand upon the lease, remain in possession, and sue for breach of
contract damages as well as injunctive relief (Andrews v. Mobile Aire
Estates (2005) 125 Cal.App.4th 578, 590). Minor inconveniences and
annoyances are not actionable. (Id. at pp. 589-90.) 
The Complaint’s eighth cause of
action incorporates prior allegations to support breach of covenant of quiet
enjoyment. (Complaint, ¶¶ 144-150.)
In its demurrer, 1516 Hobart makes
the same argument directed to the first to third and seventh causes of action:
Plaintiff did not plead sufficient allegations relating to a lease agreement
between the parties or a specific term breached, for which reason this claim fails
on demurrer. (Demurrer, p. 7.)
In opposition, Plaintiff Chapman
argues that the allegations from which the prior claims arise support a breach
of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. (Demurrer Opp’n, p. 9.)
In reply, 1516 Hobart Investments
reiterates its position on demurrer. (Demurrer Reply, p. 4.)
The Court finds in favor of
Plaintiff Chapman.
The Court has already found that
the Complaint sufficiently pleads a contract in relation to the first to third
and seventh causes of action. (See §§ I, IV discussions supra.) Moreover, the
Complaint sufficiently alleges various uninhabitable conditions in the Premises
and Defendants’ failure to remediate despite notice. (See, e.g., Complaint, ¶¶
3 [vermin], 6 [vermin and mold], 8 [notice], 123 [sewage backup, contaminated
wastewater, and mold contamination], 127 [willfulness], 130 [failure to remedy
mold], 144 [incorporation of prior allegations].)
1516 Hobart’s demurrer is thus
OVERRULED as to the Complaint’s eighth cause of action.
VI.
Complaint, Ninth Cause of
Action, Fraud/Deceit/Intentional Misrepresentations of Fact: OVERRULED.
“[T]he elements of an action for
fraud and deceit based on a concealment are: (1) the defendant must have
concealed or suppressed a material fact, (2) the defendant must have been under
a duty to disclose the fact to the plaintiff, (3) the defendant must have
intentionally concealed or suppressed the fact with the intent to defraud the
plaintiff, (4) the plaintiff must have been unaware of the fact and would not
have acted as he did if he had known of the concealed or suppressed fact, and
(5) as a result of the concealment or suppression of the fact, the plaintiff
must have sustained damage.” (Boschma v. Home Loan Center, Inc. (2011)
198 Cal.App.4th 230, 248; see also Roddenberry v. Roddenberry (1996) 44
Cal.App.4th 634, 665-666.)
Allegations of fraud “must be pled
with more detail than other causes of action.” (Apollo Capital Fund, LLC v.
Roth Capital Partners, LLC (2007) 158 Cal.App.4th 226, 240.) “Every element
of the cause of action for fraud must be alleged … factually and
specifically[,] and the policy of liberal construction of the pleadings … will
not ordinarily be invoked to sustain a pleading defective in any material
respect. [Citations.]” (Committee on Children’s Television, Inc. v. General
Foods Corp. (1983) 35 Cal.3d 197, 216, superseded by statute as stated in Branick
v. Downey Savings & Loan Assn. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 235, 242.) “[G]eneral
and conclusory allegations do not suffice.” (Small v. Fritz Cos., Inc.
(2003) 30 Cal.4th 167, 184 [citations omitted].) Fittingly, a plaintiff
pleading fraud must plead facts showing “how, when, where, to whom, and by what
means” the allegedly fraudulent representations were tendered. (Lazar v.
Superior Court (1996) 12 Cal.4th 631, 645.)
The Complaint alleges fraud based
on intentional misrepresentations and omissions by a manager of 1516 Hobart, Alyssa
Silva, who concealed toxic mold conditions in the Subject Premises from
Plaintiff Chapman despite knowledge thereof. (Complaint, ¶¶ 152(a), 152(b)
[concealments in October 2020 and May 2021]; see Complaint, ¶¶ 151-161.)
In its demurrer, 1516 Hobart argues
that the Complaint is devoid of any specificity regarding how, where, and by
what means the purported misrepresentations/concealment were made to Plaintiff
and of any alleged misrepresentation made by Ms. Silva. 1516 Hobart also argues
that Plaintiff has likewise failed to plead the reliance or causation elements
with particularity. (Demurrer, pp. 10-11.)
In opposition, Plaintiff argues
that she has pleaded all the elements of this claim based on intentional
misrepresentation. Plaintiff relies on the concealment portion of the ninth
cause of action, as well as other paragraphs of this claim in support. (Demurrer
Opp’n, pp. 9-10, citing Complaint, ¶¶ 157-158 [supporting intent and
reliance].)
In reply, 1516 Hobart Investments
reiterates its position on demurrer. (Demurrer Reply, pp. 5-6.)
The Court finds in favor of
Plaintiff Chapman.
Here, the Complaint pleads
concealments by a manager of 1516 Hobart, Alyssa Silva, the dates of the
concealment (October 1, 2021 and May 1, 2021), and the nature of the material
fact concealed (mold). The Complaint alleges duty through the landlord-tenant
relationship. The Complaint alleges intent through knowledge of the mold
problem and its concealment and through the profit motive for the concealment,
i.e., payment of rent. The Complaint alleges Plaintiff’s lack of awareness of
the concealment and that Plaintiff would have prosecuted her rights had she
known of the presence of mold. The Complaint also pleads damages. (Complaint,
¶¶ 12 [harm suffered by Plaintiff], 98 [Plaintiff timely paid rent], 151
[incorporation], 152(a), 152(b) [knowing concealment, and lack of awareness by
Plaintiff], 156-158 [Plaintiff would have acted differently, i.e., reliance],
159-160 [damages].) These allegations were made with sufficient particularity
to survive demurrer.
1516 Hobart’s demurrer is thus
OVERRULED as to the Complaint’s ninth cause of action.
 
Motion to Strike
Legal
Standard
The
court may, upon a motion or at any time in its discretion and upon terms it
deems proper: (a) strike out any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted
in any pleading; or (b) strike out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or
filed in conformity with the laws of California, a court rule, or an order of
the court. (Code Civ. Proc. § 436, subds. (a), (b); Stafford v. Shultz
(1954) 42 Cal.2d 767, 782 [“Matter in a pleading which is not essential to the
claim is surplusage; probative facts are surplusage and may be stricken out or
disregarded”].)
For
the purposes of a motion to strike pursuant to Sections 435 to 437 of the Code
of Civil Procedure, the term “pleading” generally means a demurrer, answer,
complaint, or cross-complaint, (Code Civ. Proc., § 435, subd. (a)), and an
immaterial allegation or irrelevant matter in a pleading entails (1) an
allegation that is not essential to the statement of a claim or defense, (2) an
allegation that is neither pertinent to nor supported by an otherwise
sufficient claim or defense, or (3) a demand for judgment requesting relief not
supported by the allegations of the complaint or cross-complaint (Code Civ.
Proc., § 431.10, subds. (b)(1)-(3), (c)).
Order
Striking Punitive Damages: DENIED.
“In
an action for the breach of an obligation not arising from contract, where it
is proven by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant has been guilty
of oppression, fraud, or malice, the plaintiff, in addition to the actual
damages, may recover damages for the sake of example and by way of punishing
the defendant.” (Civ. Code, § 3294, subd. (a).) 
When
the defendant is a corporation, ‘[a]n award of punitive damages … must rest on
the malice of the corporation’s employees’” specifically, “the oppression,
fraud, or malice perpetrated, authorized, or knowingly ratified by an officer,
director, or managing agent of the corporation,” where a managing agent
“include[s] only those corporate employees who exercise substantial independent
authority and judgment in their corporate decisionmaking so that their
decisions ultimately determine corporate policy.’” (Wilson v. Southern
California Edison Co. (2015) 234 Cal.App.4th 123, 164, citations
omitted.) 
In
its motion, 1516 Hobart argues that Plaintiff Chapman has only conclusorily
alleged conduct supporting punitive damages pursuant to Civil Code section
3294, that the Complaint only rises to the level of negligent not malicious
conduct, and that punitive damages cannot arise from breach of contract. (MTS,
pp. 5-9.)
In
opposition, Plaintiff Chapman argues that she has alleged sufficient factual
grounds for punitive damages and that the claims for breach of quiet enjoyment,
IIED, and fraud justify punitive damages. (MTS Opp’n, pp. 5-7.)
In
reply, 1516 Hobart reiterates its points in the motion to strike and goes into
detail as to why the above claims cannot support punitive damages here. (MTS
Reply, pp. 2-5.)
The
Court finds in favor of Plaintiff Chapman.
Punitive
damages stand based on allegations of uninhabitable conditions in the Premises,
Plaintiff Chapman’s notice of the same to Defendants, and Defendants’ failure
to remediate the conditions. These allegations, discussed at length above,
support outrageous conduct that amounts to oppression and perhaps malice if
intent is shown. (See Stoiber v. Honeychuck,
supra, 101 Cal.App.3d at p. 920 [where a tenant alleged that defendant had
actual notice of defective conditions in the premises including leaking sewage
and other unsafe and dangerous conditions, the tenant had “pleaded sufficient
facts to support her prayer for exemplary damages”].) Moreover, these
allegations support the inference that despite complaints by Plaintiff Chapman
relating to the uninhabitable conditions, a person or person amounting to an officer,
director, or managing agent of Defendants failed to act or intentionally did
not act to remediate these conditions. In addition, the Complaint pleads
actions by a “manager,” i.e., Alyssa Silva, in failing to remediate known
conditions. (Complaint, ¶ 152.)
Moreover,
the Court notes that all the Complaint’s claims survived demurrer and that some
of those claims do not sound in contract, but rather, sound in tort, i.e., IIED
and fraud (concealment).
The
motion to strike is thus DENIED as to striking punitive damages.
Order
Striking Attorney’s Fees: DENIED.
In
its motion, 1516 Hobart argues that the Complaint does not plead a contractual
basis for the fees, nor a statute under which Plaintiff is entitled to attorney’s
fees. The motion appears to attempt distinguishing Civil Code section 1021.5
but not Civil Code section 1942.4. (MTS, pp. 9-10.)
In
opposition, Plaintiff Chapman argues that fees are proper pursuant to Civil
Code sections 1021.5 and 1942.4. Plaintiff also argues that the Complaint
alleges that the lease agreement had an attorney’s fees clause, pointing to
paragraph 143 of the Complaint. (MTS Opp’n, pp. 2-4.)
In
reply, 1516 Hobart argues that the first and third causes of action are not
sufficiently pleaded and thus cannot support recovery of fees. 1516 Hobart also
argues that the contract is not sufficiently pleaded or attached to the
Complaint to support recovery of fees as part of any lease agreement. (MTS
Reply, pp. 1-2.)
The
Court finds in favor of Plaintiff Chapman.
Attorney’s
fees are properly supported by the Complaint’s allegations, which include
reference to Civil Code sections 1021.5 and 1942.4, subdivision (b)(2), and to
the existence of an attorney’s fees clause in the Complaint. (Complaint, ¶¶ 84
[statutory basis for fees—Civ. Code, § 1021.5—alleged in the surviving first
cause of action for statutory breach of warranty of habitability], 96, 104 [statutory
basis for fees—Civ. Code, § 1942.4—alleged in the surviving first cause of
action for statutory breach of warranty of habitability], 143 [contractual
basis for fees in the surviving breach of contract claim, i.e., the seventh
cause of action].)
The
motion to strike is thus DENIED as to striking attorney’s fees.
