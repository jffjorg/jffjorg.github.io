And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses a motion for summary judgment or, in the alternative, summary adjudication filed by Volkswagen Group of America, Inc. The plaintiff, John Villanueva Jr., alleges that Volkswagen failed to comply with the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act (lemon law) and is seeking damages and attorney's fees.

The judge finds that there are triable issues of fact regarding whether Volkswagen's repurchase offer was prompt and whether the plaintiff is entitled to damages and attorney's fees. Therefore, the judge denies Volkswagen's motion for summary judgment and summary adjudication of damages and attorney's fees.

The judge grants summary adjudication of damages pursuant to Civil Code section 1794, subdivision (e)(1) in favor of Volkswagen, finding that there is no triable issue of fact regarding damages for express warranty violations.

The judge also denies Volkswagen's motion for summary adjudication of damages and attorney's fees based on willful violation of the SBA, finding that there is a triable issue of fact regarding whether Volkswagen willfully refused to make a repurchase offer sooner.

The case will proceed to trial on December 5, 2023.
