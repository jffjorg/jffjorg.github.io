 Case No.: 
  BC643861
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  September 26, 2024



 
Plaintiff A.C.A.
LLC’s motion for leave to file a third amended complaint is granted.  Plaintiff may file the proposed third amended
complaint with the Court.
Cross-Complainants
Paola Caldera’s, Jessica Caldera’s, Jia Shen’s, Mian Guo’s, Min Zhou’s, Yunying
Li’s, Nadia Saban’s, and Lebiba Saban’s motion for protective order is granted.  Plaintiffs must seek leave of Court to redepose
any defendant/cross-complainant.
 
          Plaintiff A.C.A.
LLC (“ACA”) (“Plaintiff”) moves for an order granting leave to file a
third amended complaint (“TAC”) on the basis the proposed change deletes causes
of action and allegations that were summarily adjudicated against Plaintiff and
adds allegations to state a breach of contract claim against the Defendants who
vacated Plaintiff’s apartment buildings prior to the bench trial of the 6th cause
of action (Mian Guo (“Guo”), Jia Shen (“Shen”), Yunying Li (“Li”), Yavuz Ertas
(“Ertas”), Ali Razfar (“A. Razfar”), and Ganchimeg Oyunchimeg (“Oyunchimeg”)).  (Notice of Motion Amend, pgs. 2-4;
C.C.P. §576.)  Plaintiff
also adds a cause of action for unjust enrichment.  (Notice of Motion Amend, pg. 4.)
          Cross-Complainants
Paola Caldera (“P. Caldera”), Jessica Caldera (“J. Caldera”), Shen, Guo, Min
Zhou (“Zhou”), Li, Nadia Saban (“N. Saban”), and Lebiba Saban (“L. Saban”)
(collectively “Moving Cross-Complainants”) move for a protective order related
to Notices of Deposition and requests for production of documents served on
July 29, 2024 (“Deposition Notices”). 
(Notice PO, pg. 2; C.C.P. §§2019.020(b), 2025.420, 2025.610.)  Moving Cross-Complainants request that this Court
issue a protective order directing that: (1) the noticed depositions not be
taken; (2) the deponent’s testimony be taken by written interrogatories,
instead of oral examination; (3) discovery be limited to the identification of
specific violations of the Los Angeles Tenant Harassment Ordinance (LAMC
§45.33) (“Tenant Harassment Ordinance”) alleged in the cause of action after
August 2021 and any damages/penalties associated with that specific conduct;
and (4) production of all or some of the documents demanded in the deposition
notices be limited to documents directly relevant to the penalties associated
with the Tenant Harassment Ordinance or barred entirely.  (Notice PO, pg. 2.)
          
          Procedural
Background
          On December
15, 2016, Plaintiff filed its original Complaint against Defendant Myron Holmstrom
(“Holstrom”) and DOES 1-200, alleging causes of action for (1) declaratory
relief, (2) rescission and restitution, (3) ejectment, (4) trespass, (5) breach
of fiduciary duty, (6) false promise, (7) concealment, (8) intentional
misrepresentation, (9) intentional interference with contractual relations,
(10) breach of contract, (11) professional negligence, and (12) violation of
Business and Professions Code §17200.
          On April 19,
2018, Doe Defendants 101-105 (P. Caldera, Guo, Shen, Li, and Zhou) filed a
cross-complaint (“CC”) against ACA and Damian Akhavi (“Akhavi”) (collectively,
“Cross-Defendants”). On April 20, 2018, those same Defendants filed a First
Amended Cross-Complaint (“FACC”) against ACA and Akhavi containing four causes
of action: alleging four causes of action: (1) intentional influence to vacate;
(2) retaliatory eviction; (3) violation of Civil Code §789.3; and (4) violation
of Los Angeles Municipal Code §§151.04(A), 151.05(C), and 151.06.
          On August 9,
2018, Doe Defendants 112-118 and 121 (Ertas, Nima Razfar (“N. Razfar”), A. Razfar,
J. Caldera, N. Saban, L. Saban, Paul Luigi (“Luigi”), and Arnaud Larousse
(“Larousse”)) filed a complaint against ACA and Akhavi in a separate action
styled as Jessica Caldera, et al. v. A.C.A. LLC et al. (LASC Case No.
BC717036), alleging the same four causes of action as the FACC filed by the
other Doe Defendants.  On February 11,
2020, the Court consolidated Caldera v. A.C.A. LLC with the
above-captioned action.
          On March 27,
2020, the Cross-Complainants filed a Second Amended Cross-Complaint (“SACC”) alleging
the same four causes of action against ACA and Akhavi, but adding a new Cross-Complainant,
Defendant Daniel Sacilotto (“Sacilotto”). On September 14, 2020, the Court
granted Defendants’ ex parte application for leave to file a Third Amended
Cross-Complaint (“TACC”) to add Oyunchimeg, who was inadvertently omitted from the
SACC.  The TACC was filed on September
15, 2020.
          In August
2018, Defendants filed a motion for summary adjudication as to the 1st, 2nd,
3rd, 4th, 5th, 9th, 11th, and 12th causes of action in Plaintiff’s Complaint.
This Court granted summary adjudication as to Plaintiff’s 1st, 3rd, 4th, 9th, 11th,
and 12th causes of action, but subsequently granted Plaintiff leave to amend as
to the 1st, 4th, 5th, 6th, 11th, and 12th causes of action (declaratory relief,
trespass, breach of fiduciary duty, false promise, professional negligence, and
violation of Bus. & Prof. Code §17200), in part to remedy the pleading
deficiencies that led to the summary adjudication ruling.  (See 9/11/20 Final Ruling on MSA; 12/10/20
Minute Order.)  This Court denied summary
adjudication as to
Plaintiff’s 2nd and 5th Causes of Action
(rescission/restitution and breach of fiduciary duty, respectively).  (See 9/11/20 Final Ruling on MSA.)
          On January
7, 2021, Plaintiff filed its first amended complaint (“FAC”) alleging causes of
action for: (1) declaratory relief [as to all Defendants except DOES 1-100];
(2) ejectment [as to all Defendants except DOES 101-105], (3) trespass [as to
all Defendants except DOES 101-105], (4) breach of fiduciary duty [as to all
Defendants], (5) intentional interference with contractual relations
[as to all Defendants except DOES 101-105], (6) declaratory
relief (in the alternative) [as to all Defendants], (7) breach of contract (in
the alternative) [as to all Defendants], and (8) declaratory relief (in the
alternative) [as to all Defendants].
          On May 13,
2021, the Court overruled Defendants’ demurrer to the FAC’s 1st and 6th causes
of action and sustained the demurrer as to the 7th cause of action (with leave
to amend) and 8th Cause of Action (without leave to amend).
          On June 2,
2021, Plaintiff filed the currently operative SAC alleging causes of action
for: (1) declaratory relief [as to all Defendants except DOES 1-100]; (2)
ejectment [as to all Defendants except DOES 101-105], (3) trespass [as to all
Defendants except DOES 101-105], (4) aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary
duty [as to all Defendants], (5) intentional interference with contractual
relations [as to all Defendants except DOES 101-105], (6)
declaratory relief (in the alternative) [as to all Defendants], and (7) breach
of contract (in the alternative) [as to all Defendants].
          On October
24, 2022, this Court granted Defendants’ motion for summary adjudication as to the
1st through 5th Causes of Action in Plaintiff’s SAC, but denied summary
adjudication as to the 6th and 7th causes of action (declaratory relief and
breach of contract, respectively).
          On November
1, 2022, Defendants filed a motion for reconsideration of the Court’s ruling denying
summary adjudication as to Plaintiff’s 6th and 7th Causes of Action.  Then, on November 3, 2022, Defendants filed a
motion for judgment on the pleadings as to Plaintiff’s 6th and 7th causes of action
that survived summary adjudication.
          On January
6, 2023, this Court denied Defendants’ motion for reconsideration, in part because
there were no cognizable “new or different facts, circumstances, or law” to
support the motion.  (1/6/23 Minute
Order.)
          On February
15, 2023, this Court denied Defendants’ motion for judgment on the pleadings.
          On August 7,
2023, this Court began the bench trial on Plaintiff’s 6th Cause of Action for declaratory
relief.  Prior to the commencement of the
bench trial, Plaintiff dismissed its 6th cause of action (and only its 6th cause
of action) against Guo, Shen, Li, Ertas, A. Razfar, and Oyunchimeg
(collectively, “Vacated Defendants”) because they had vacated Plaintiff’s
apartment buildings, which mooted Plaintiff’s declaratory relief claim against
them as a matter of law because declaratory relief is available only to guide
the parties’ future conduct where there is an ongoing contractual relationship.
 On December 1, 2023, this Court issued
its final Statement of Decision as to Plaintiff’s 6th Cause of Action.  In view of the dismissals described above, this
Court made no findings as to the nature of the Vacated Defendants’ tenancies.
          Defendants
filed a second motion for judgment on the pleadings as to the SAC on September
27, 2023. At this point, only the 7th cause of action remained, as the 6th cause
of action had already been tried.
          On December
1, 2023, this Court partially granted Defendants second motion for judgment on
the pleadings as to the Vacated Defendants (Guo, Shen, Li, Ertas, A. Razfar, and
Oyunchimeg), but denied the motion as to the remainder of the Defendants.  This Court found that because it had made no
findings as to the terms of the Vacated Defendants’ tenancies in the trial of
Plaintiff’s 6th cause of action for declaratory relief, the pleading of
Plaintiff’s 7th cause of action in the SAC as to the Vacated Defendants was
defective because it was premised on factual findings by the Court in the trial
of the 6th Cause of Action.  This Court
did not grant Plaintiff leave to amend the SAC to address the pleading
deficiency the Court found as to the Vacated Defendants.
          On March 19,
2024, Cross-Complainants filed a motion to amend their Cross-Complaint to add a
new cause of action based on the Tenant Harassment Ordinance, which this Court
granted on May 31, 2024.
          Plaintiff
filed the instant motion for leave to file a TAC on July 12, 2024.  Cross-Complainants filed their opposition on September
13, 2024.  Plaintiff filed its reply on September
19, 2024.
          On July 29,
2024, Plaintiff served Notices of Deposition on Moving Cross-Complainants.  (Decl. of Riley ¶6, Exhs. 1-8.)  The Deposition Notices contain 31 requests for
production of documents.  (Decl. of Riley
¶6, Exhs. 1-8.)
          Cross-Complainants
filed an initial motion for protective order on August 8, 2024, and the instant
amended motion for protective order on August 30, 2024.  Plaintiff filed its opposition on September
13, 2024.  Cross-Complainants filed their
reply on September 19, 2024.
 
1.     Plaintiff’s Motion for Leave to
Amend
Legal
Standard
“The
court may, in furtherance of justice, and on any terms as may be proper, allow
a party to amend any pleading or proceeding by adding or striking out the name
of any party, or by correcting a mistake in the name of a party, or a mistake
in any other respect; and may, upon like terms, enlarge the time for answer or
demurrer. The court may likewise, in its discretion, after notice to the
adverse party, allow, upon any terms as may be just, an amendment to any
pleading or proceeding in other particulars; and may upon like terms allow an
answer to be made after the time limited by this code.”  (C.C.P.
§473(a)(1).) 
“Trial
courts are vested with the discretion to allow amendments to pleadings ‘in
furtherance of justice.’ That trial courts are to liberally permit such
amendments, at any stage of the proceeding, has been established policy in this
state since 1901.”  (Hirsa v. Superior Court (1981) 118 Cal.App.3d
486, 488-489.) 
CRC
Rule 3.1321(a) requires that a motion to amend must: “[i]nclude a copy of the
proposed . . . amended pleading . . . [and] state what allegations in the
previous pleading are proposed to be [deleted and/or added], if any, and where,
by page, paragraph, and line number, the [deleted and/or additional]
allegations are located.” 
CRC
Rule 3.1324(b) provides, as follows: “[a] separate declaration must accompany
the motion and must specify: (1) [t]he effect of the amendment; (2) [w]hy the
amendment is necessary and proper; (3) [w]hen the facts giving rise to the
amended allegations were discovered; and (4) [t]he reasons why the request for
amendment was not made earlier.” 
 
Discussion
Plaintiff’s
motion substantially complies with CRC Rule 3.1324(a).  The motion
includes a copy of the proposed TAC.  (Decl. of Correll ¶2, Exh. 2.)   Plaintiff’s
counsel’s declaration sets forth the allegations proposed to be added and
deleted, and where, by page, paragraph, and line number.  (Decl. of Correll
¶4.) 
Plaintiff’s
motion substantially complies with CRC Rule 3.1324(b).  Plaintiff submitted a separate declaration of
its counsel that specifies the effect of the amendments and explains why the
amendments are necessary and proper.  (Decl. of Correll ¶6.)  Plaintiff
asserts the amendments are necessary to ensure the complete and fair
adjudication on the merits of all related claims and controversies between the parties.
 (Decl. of Correll ¶6.)  Plaintiff asserts its motion for leave to
amend was not brought earlier because the trial schedule precluded the
amendment.  (Decl. of Correll ¶6.)  This Court recently granted Defendants’
motion for leave to amend their operative Cross-Complaint, postponed the trial
from July 2024 to February 2025, and reopened discovery. Given the extension of
the trial date and reopening of discovery, Defendants will suffer no prejudice
by the proposed TAC.
Plaintiff’s
counsel fails to state when the facts giving rise of the amended allegations
were discovered and why the request for amendment was not made earlier.  However, in view of the liberal policy of
allowing amendments, mere delay in seeking amendment is not sufficient to deny
leave to amend.  (See Kittredge Sports v. Superior Court (1989)
213 Cal.App.3d 1045, 1048 [holding denial of allegedly delayed motion to amend
was “an abuse of discretion . . . where the opposing party was not misled or
prejudiced by the amendment”].)  The key
inquiry is whether Defendants were misled or prejudiced.  (See id.)  It is an abuse of discretion to deny leave to
amend where Defendants were not misled or prejudiced.  (See id.)  Therefore, Plaintiff’s failure to state when
the facts giving rise of the amended allegations were discovered and why the
request for amendment was not made earlier is not an appropriate ground to deny
Plaintiff’s motion.
Defendants’
arguments that Plaintiff’s proposed amendment is a sham pleading, does not
relate back to the original complaint, is barred by the statute of limitations,
and the 7th cause of action is not within the Court’s jurisdiction are
unavailing and have largely been addressed and rejected in prior motions.  The policy favoring amendment is so strong
that denial of leave to amend can rarely be justified: “If the motion to amend
is timely made and the granting of the motion will not prejudice the opposing
party, it is error to refuse permission to amend and where the refusal also
results in a party being deprived of the right to assert a meritorious cause of
action or a meritorious defense, it is not only error but an abuse of
discretion.”  (Morgan v. Superior Court
(1959) 172 Cal.App.2d 527, 530.)
Further,
it is improper for this Court to consider the validity of the proposed amended
pleading on the instant motion; after leave to amend is granted, Defendants
will have the opportunity to attack the validity of the amended pleading.  (See Kittredge,
213 Cal.App.3d at pg. 1048; Atkinson v. Elk
Corp. (2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 739, 760 [“[T]he
better course of action would have been to allow [plaintiff] to amend the
complaint and then let the parties test its legal sufficiency in other
appropriate proceedings”].)
Defendant’s
argument that it will be prejudiced if this Court grants the instant motion is
noted, but not sufficient to overcome the policy of liberality in permitting
amendments to the complaint at “any stage of the proceedings, up to and
including trial,” absent prejudice to the adverse party.  (Atkinson, 109
Cal.App.4th at pg. 761.)  Prejudice
exists where the amendment would result in a delay of trial, along with loss of
critical evidence, added costs of preparation, increased burden of discovery,
etc.  (Magpali v. Farmers Group, Inc.
(1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 471, 486-488; see P & D Consultants, Inc. v. City
of Carlsbad (2010) 190 Cal.App.4th 1332, 1345; Fisher v. Larsen
(1982) 138 Cal.App.3d 627, 649, [leave to amend properly denied where P knew
for over five months claims had not been properly pleaded and took no action to
amend until after summary judgment granted against it].)   
Defendants’
arguments that it will be prejudiced because (1) Plaintiff will be permitted to
avoid contrary admissions of fact that Defendants are entitled to use at trial
to defeat the claim and prove Cross-Complainants’ claims; (2) Defendants will
be forced to defend against a wholly new claim based on different facts and a
different contract without the benefit of proper discovery and pretrial
motions; (3) Plaintiff will be permitted to avoid statutes of limitation for
the new claim that on its face does not relate back to any of the former
complaints filed by Plaintiff; (4) Plaintiff will be permitted to revive a
claim as to Defendants in whose favor a judgment has already been entered; and
(5) Plaintiff will be permitted to avoid the pending motion for summary
judgment do not outweigh the abovementioned policy of liberality.  (Opposition, pgs. 17-18.)
Here, the
issue of unpaid rent has always been part of Plaintiff’s offset defense to
Defendants’ crossclaims, and all Defendants will therefore have to address the
unpaid rent issue in their crossclaims regardless of whether Plaintiff is
granted leave to file its TAC, and further, the trial date was continued, and
discovery has been reopened.
 
Based
on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s motion for leave to amend its SAC and file the
proposed TAC is granted.  
 
          Conclusion
Plaintiff’s
motion for leave to amend its SAC is granted. 
Plaintiff may file the proposed TAC with the Court.
          Moving Party to give notice.
 
2.    
Cross-Complainants’ Motion
for Protective Order
Meet
and Confer
          C.C.P. §2025.420 provides, in part:
Before, during, or after a
deposition, any party, any deponent, or any other affected natural person or
organization may promptly move for a protective order. The motion shall be
accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040.
 
(C.C.P.
§2025.420(a), emphasis added.)
Cross-Complainants’
counsel declares that on August 5, 2024, he met and conferred with Plaintiff’s
counsel by email concerning the Notices of Deposition and related document
requests.  (See Decl. of Riley ¶7,
Exh. 9.)   Cross-Complainants’ counsel declares that on
August 8, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel responded to the meet and confer email.  (See Decl. of Riley ¶8, Exh. 10.)  Cross-Complainants’ counsel’s declaration
states facts showing a “reasonable and good faith
attempt” to resolve the matter outside of court.  (C.C.P. §§2016.040, 2025.420(a).)  Therefore,
the Court will consider the instant motion.
 
Legal Standard 
C.C.P. §2025.420(b) provides that “[t]he court, for good cause
shown, may make any order that justice requires to protect any party or other
person from unwarranted annoyance, embarrassment, or oppression, or undue
burden and expense.”  (C.C.P. §2025.420(b).)
The decision upon whether to enter a protective order lies within
the sound discretion of the court.  (Raymond
Handling Concepts Corp. v. Superior Court (1995) 39
Cal.App.4th 584, 588, 591; Meritplan Insurance Co. v. Superior Court (1981)
124 Cal.App.3d 237, 242.)  Moving parties have the burden to show good
cause for protective order.  (Emerson Electric Co. v. Superior Court (1997)
16 Cal.4th 1101, 1110.)   
 
          Discussion
Moving Cross-Complainants’
motion for a protective order is granted.  
Under C.C.P. §2025.610(a), “[o]nce
any party has taken the deposition of any natural person, including that of a
party to the action, neither the party who gave, nor any other party who has
been served with a deposition notice pursuant to Section 2025.240 may take a
subsequent deposition of that deponent.” 
(C.C.P. §2025.610(a); see Fairmont Insurance Co. v. Superior
Court (2000) 22 Cal.4th 245, 254.)
However, under C.C.P.
§2025.610(b) “[n]otwithstanding
subdivision (a), for good cause shown, the court may grant leave to take a
subsequent deposition . . ..”  (C.C.P.
§2025.610(b).)
          Here, Moving Cross-Complainants were
all previously deposed in this matter as follows: (1) P. Caldera was deposed by
Plaintiff on February 23, 2018, and deposed again by Cross-Complainants on
March 3, 2022; (2) J. Caldera was deposed by Cross-Complainants on March 3,
2022; (3) Shen was deposed by Plaintiff on March 16, 2018, and deposed again by
Cross-Complainants on March 4, 2022; (4) Guo was deposed by Plaintiff on
September 20, 2018; (5) Li was deposed by Plaintiff on May 14, 2018; (6) Zhou
was deposed by Plaintiff on February 23, 2018, and deposed again by Cross-Complainants
on March 4, 2022; (7) N. Saban was deposed by Cross-Complainants on March 11,
2022; and (8) L. Saban was deposed by Cross-Complainants on March 11, 2022.
(Decl.
of Riley ¶10.)
          Moving Cross-Complainants were all
previously deposed in this matter.  Plaintiff
has failed to request leave to take a subsequent deposition.  (C.C.P. §2025.610(b).) 
Therefore, Moving Cross-Complainants’ request for a protective order directing
that the Noticed Depositions not be taken is granted.
Based on the foregoing, Moving
Cross-Complainants’ motion for protective order is granted; if Plaintiff wish
to redepose defendants/cross-complainants, Plaintiffs must seek leave of Court.
 
Conclusion
Moving Cross-Complainants’
motion for protective order is granted as to the Noticed Depositions.  The Noticed Depositions cannot be taken at this juncture,
including the attached document demand, without leave of Court.
Moving
Party to give notice.
