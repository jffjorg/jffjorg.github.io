         vs.
 
BEN WILKINS, et al.


 Case No.:  24STCV00029
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  September 26, 2024



 
Plaintiff Bel Esprit Builders, Inc.’s unopposed motion to
compel Defendant Karen Wilkins to provide responses to its Form Interrogatories
(Set One) is granted.  Defendant is ordered to provide verified
responses to Plaintiff’s FROGs compliant with C.C.P. §§2030.210(a) and 2030.220
without objections within 20 days.

Plaintiff Bel
Esprit Builders, Inc.’s request for
monetary sanctions for its Form Interrogatories (Set One) is granted in the reduced amount of $922.50
against Defendant Karen Wilkins.  Sanctions are payable within 20 days.

          
          Plaintiff Bel
Esprit Builders, Inc. (“Bel Esprit”) (“Plaintiff”) moves unopposed to
compel Defendant Karen Wilkins (“Karen”) (“Defendant”) to provide responses to its Form
Interrogatories (“FROG”).  (Notice of
Motion, pg. 2; C.C.P. §2023.290.) 
Plaintiff also requests an award of sanctions against Karen in the
amount of $1,860.00.  (Notice of Motion,
pg. 2; C.C.P. §§2023.030(a), 2030.290(c).)
Having reviewed Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Responses to Plaintiff’s FROG,
the Court rules as follows.
          On May 10, 2024,
Plaintiff served FROG on Karen.  (Decl.
of Brault ¶3, Exh. 1.)  Defendant’s
deadline to respond was June 14, 2024.  (Decl. of Brault ¶6.) Defendant did not
provide responses nor request an extension to respond to FROG.  (Decl. of Brault ¶6.)  Plaintiff’s counsel wrote letters to
Defendant’s counsel on June 17 and 28, 2024, asking for responses to FROG,
which were not responded to.  (Decl. of Brault
¶8, Exhs. 2, 3.)  As of the date of this
hearing no responses were served on Plaintiff. 
(See Decl. of Brault ¶¶8, 9.)  Plaintiff now moves to compel responses.  
          Plaintiff’s motion to
compel responses is granted pursuant to C.C.P. §2030.290(b).  Karen
is ordered to provide verified responses to Plaintiff’s FROG compliant with
C.C.P. §§2030.210(a) and 2030.220 without objections within 20 days.
Plaintiff requests monetary sanctions totaling $1,860.00 against Karen. 
          The
Court awards sanctions pursuant to C.C.P. §2030.290(c) in the amount of $922.50,
in light of the fact that the motion is unopposed, calculated as follows:
(1.5 hours to prepare instant motion x $575.00) + $60.00 filing fee = $922.50

The sanctions are payable by
Karen within 20 days of this order.
Moving Party is to give
notice of this ruling.
