Judge Theresa M. Traber has issued a tentative ruling granting Defendant Joy Freiberg's Special Motion to Strike the Complaint in its entirety. The motion was filed under California Code of Civil Procedure ยง 425.16 (Anti-SLAPP statute), which allows a defendant to strike a complaint that arises from protected speech or activity. The court found that Defendant's statements on social media were protected activity, as they related to matters of public concern and were made in connection with a public issue. The court also found that Plaintiff Larry Gross failed to demonstrate a probability of success on his defamation claims, as he did not provide evidence that Defendant acted with actual malice in making the statements. As a result, the court granted Defendant's motion to strike the complaint and ordered it stricken in its entirety.
