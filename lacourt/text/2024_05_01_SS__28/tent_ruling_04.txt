PARTY’S REQUESTS 
Plaintiff
asks the Court to enter a default judgment against Bionicos, Rodriguez, and
Quezada, jointly and severally, for $418,320.00, consisting of $116,540.00 in
special damages, $300,000.00 in general damages, and $1,780.00 in costs. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
A.      Default judgment 
“[With exceptions that do not apply here,] [a] party
seeking a default judgment on declarations must use mandatory Request for Entry
of Default (Application to Enter Default) (form CIV-100) . . . The following
must be included in the documents filed with the clerk: 
“(1)  Except in
unlawful detainer cases, a brief summary of the case identifying the parties
and the nature of plaintiff's claim; 
“(2) 
Declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment
requested; 
“(3)  Interest
computations as necessary; 
“(4)  A
memorandum of costs and disbursements; 
“(5)  A
declaration of nonmilitary status for each defendant against whom judgment is
sought; 
“(6)  A proposed
form of judgment; 
“(7)  A
dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application
for separate judgment against specified parties under Code of Civil Procedure
section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; 
“(8)  Exhibits
as necessary; and 
“(9)  A request
for attorney fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.” 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1800(a).) 
B.       Damages 
 On a request for default judgment, “[w]here a
cause of action is stated in the complaint, plaintiff merely needs to introduce
evidence establishing a prima facie case for damages.”  (L. Edmon & C. Karnow, Cal. Practice
Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶ 5:213.1, p. 5-56, citing Johnson
v. Stanhiser (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 357, 361 [trial court erred in applying
preponderance of the evidence standard].) 
 The relief granted to a plaintiff upon entry
of a defendant's default cannot exceed the amount demanded in the complaint or,
for personal injury cases where damages may not be stated in the complaint, the
amount listed in the statement of damages. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 580, subd. (a),
585, subd. (b).) “The notice requirement of section 580 was designed to insure
fundamental fairness.” (Becker v. S.P.V. Construction Co. (1980) 27
Cal.3d 489, 494.) The statute insures that “defendants in cases which involve a
default judgment have adequate notice of the judgments that may be taken
against them. [Citation.] ‘If a judgment other than that which is demanded is
taken against him, [the defendant] has been deprived of his day in court—a
right to a hearing on the matter adjudicated.’ ’’ (Id. at p. 493.) A
trial court exceeds its jurisdiction if it awards damages in excess of the
amount specified in the complaint or statement of damages. (Id. at p.
494.) 
DISCUSSION 
A.   Quezada 
In
the Court’s March 6, 2024 order, the Court asked Plaintiff to submit a copy of
the statement of damages served on Quezada. 
Plaintiff has submitted a “Statement of Damages” directed to “Defendants”
which is prepared on pleading paper and dated May 28, 2019.  However, Plaintiff has not submitted a
statement of damages sought against Quezada which uses the mandatory Judicial
Council statement of damages form. 
The
Court cannot confirm that Plaintiff put Quezada on notice of the amount of damages
which Plaintiff is now requesting.  Therefore,
the Court denies Plaintiff’s request to enter judgment against Quezada. 
B.   Medical expenses 
Plaintiff
states that Justin D. Paquette, M.D. charged $134,405.00 for medical services
but this amount was adjusted by “$122,171.9” [sic] and Plaintiff’s health
insurance paid $12,233.00 of the remaining expenses.  (Moore dec. ¶ 25.)  Plaintiff asks to include the $12,233.00
which his health insurance paid in his special damages.  The Court will not award Plaintiff damages
for an amount that his health insurance has paid. 
Plaintiff
should explain whether his health insurance has paid, or will pay, some or all
of the remaining medical expenses included in his request for special damages. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES without prejudice Plaintiff Walter
Moore’s application for default judgment against Defendants Bionicos Genesis, Inc., Jesus
Rodriguez, and Rosie Quezada filed on April 5, 2024. 
Plaintiff
is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
