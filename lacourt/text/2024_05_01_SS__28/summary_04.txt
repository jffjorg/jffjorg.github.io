And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied, without prejudice, Plaintiff Walter Moore's application for default judgment against Defendants Bionicos Genesis, Inc., Jesus Rodriguez, and Rosie Quezada. The judge's decision is based on the court's March 6, 2024 order, which asked Plaintiff to submit a copy of the statement of damages served on Quezada. Since Plaintiff failed to provide a statement of damages sought against Quezada in the mandatory Judicial Council format, the court cannot confirm that Quezada was put on notice of the amount of damages requested. Additionally, the court will not award Plaintiff damages for an amount that his health insurance has paid. The court has ordered Plaintiff to give notice of this ruling.
