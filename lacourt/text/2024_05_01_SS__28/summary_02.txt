And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has denied Neiman's motion to compel AWE's person most qualified to comply with a deposition subpoena and for sanctions. The court found that AWE is not a registered corporation and is merely a trade name used by Plaintiff for personal projects. The court also granted Plaintiff's request for sanctions in the amount of $500.00 due to Neiman's failure to take its motion off calendar after learning that AWE is not a corporate entity. The court ordered Neiman to pay the sanctions within 30 days of the hearing on the motion.
