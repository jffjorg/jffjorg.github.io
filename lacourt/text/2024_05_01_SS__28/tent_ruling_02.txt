Proc., § 2025.480,  subds. (a), (b), (c), (h), (i), (j).)              DISCUSSION  On  November 15, 2022, Plaintiff stated in responses to Neiman’s interrogatories  that (1) she is “self-employed at [AWE],” (2) she attributes loss of income or  loss of earning capacity to the accident, and (3) she “has been unable to  return to full time work in the manner she was previously prior to her injury.”   On July 26, 2023, Neiman examined Plaintiff  about her loss of income claim at her deposition.  On  January 3, 2024, Neiman served a deposition subpoena on AWE for a deposition of  its person most qualified about Plaintiff's loss of income claim.  The subpoena  asked that AWE’s person most qualified attend a remote video deposition on  January 25, 2024 starting at 10:00 a.m. and produce documents listed in the  subpoena.  On  January 22, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel served objections to the deposition  notice.  On January 24, 2024, Plaintiff’s  counsel informed Neiman’s counsel that Plaintiff would not appear for the  deposition.  On January  25, 2024, a person most qualified did not appear for the remote video  deposition.  On  February 28, 2024, Defendant The Neiman Marcus Group, Inc. (“Neiman”) filed a  motion to compel AWE’s person most qualified to comply with the deposition  subpoena and for sanctions.  The motion  was set to be heard on May 1, 2024.  On  April 5, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel informed Neiman’s counsel that AWE “is simply  an informal fictitious business name of plaintiff and is not an independent  entity . . . .”  (Exh. B to Plaintiff’s  opposition.)  Plaintiff’s counsel  explained that AWE “is not a registered corporation, but is a trade name used  by Plaintiff for certain projects in her personal capacity.”  Plaintiff’s counsel stated: “If you would  like to re-depose Plaintiff regarding her work under the Awe Film name we are  happy to work with you to determine availability for such a deposition.”  Plaintiff’s counsel asked Neiman’s counsel to  take the motion to compel off calendar.  On  April 18, 2024, Neiman’s counsel responded, “We will agree to take the motion  off calendar only if you agree to pay the filing fees. We were forced to  bring this motion.”  (Emphasis in  original.)   Plaintiff’s  counsel declined to pay Neiman’s filing fees, asserting Neiman could have  avoided filing the motion if its counsel had met and conferred with Plaintiff’s  counsel before filing it.  The same day,  Plaintiff filed an opposition to the motion to compel which argued that AWE is not  and never has been a registered corporation and is merely a stage name that  Plaintiff uses in her personal capacity for music and film projects.  The  Court denies Neiman's motion.  Neiman does not  dispute Plaintiff’s assertion that AWE is not a corporate entity and does not  have a person most qualified.  After  learning on April 5, 2024 that AWE is not a separate entity, Neiman failed to  take its motion off calendar, requiring Plaintiff to file an opposition.  Plaintiff requests sanctions of $2,037.00  based on 2.1 hours of attorney’s time at a rate of $970.00 per hour. The Court  grants sanctions of $500.00 based on two hours of attorney’s time at a  reasonable rate of $250.00 per hour.  CONCLUSION  The  Court DENIES Defendant The Neiman Marcus Group, Inc.’s motion to compel the  person most qualified of AWE Film/Music  Experience to comply with a deposition subpoena and for sanctions.  The  Court GRANTS IN PART Plaintiff Ebony Tay’s request for sanctions and orders  Defendant The Neiman Marcus Group, Inc. and its counsel to pay Plaintiff Ebony  Tay $500.00 within 30 days of the hearing on the motion.  Moving  party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.  Moving  party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court  within five days.
