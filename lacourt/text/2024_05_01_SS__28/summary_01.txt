And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling concerns a motion by Hertz Corporation (Hertz) to compel the Center for Integrated Care (Center) to produce certain medical records and to compel Brendan Trainotti (Trainotti) to authorize the release of those records. Hertz also seeks sanctions against Trainotti. Trainotti opposes the motion, arguing that Hertz failed to comply with a court rule requiring personal service of the motion. The judge finds that while Hertz's failure to comply with the rule is not material, it will continue the hearing to allow Trainotti to brief the issue of privacy. The judge also defers Hertz's request to compel Trainotti to authorize the release of records and the request for sanctions to the continued hearing date.
