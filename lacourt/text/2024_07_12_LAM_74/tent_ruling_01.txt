(PROPOSED) ORDER
I.                  
BACKGROUND
Defendants
New Regency Productions, Inc., PK Prods, Inc., and Yariv Milchan’s to Seal
Confidential Information in connection with Plaintiffs’ Complaint came on for
hearing before this Court on July 12, 2024, at 8:30 a.m..  Pursuant to the Court’s full consideration of
the matter, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that this Motion is GRANTED; and that
therefore Plaintiffs’ Complaint shall remain under seal.
II.               
LEGAL STANDARD
Unless
confidentiality is required by law, court records are presumed to be open to
the public.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
2.550, subd. (c).)  Consequently,
pleadings, motions, evidence, and other papers may not be filed under seal
merely by stipulation of the parties; rather, a prior court order is necessary.
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.551, subd. (a).)
To grant such an
order, the court must expressly find that ... “an overriding interest exists
that overcomes the right of public access to the record, an overriding interest
supports sealing the records, a substantial probability exists that the
overriding interest will be prejudiced if the record is not sealed, the
proposed sealing is narrowly tailored, and no less restrictive means exist to
achieve the overriding interest.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.550, subd. (d).)
If the court fails
to make the required findings, the order is deficient and cannot support
sealing. (Overstock.com, Inc. v. Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (2014) 231
Cal.App.4th 471, 487.)
III.            
DISCUSSION
In
support of their motion to seal, Defendants cite potentially overriding
interests. First, the Complaint contains information that the parties contractually
agreed to keep confidential. (See NBC Subsidiary (KNBC-TV), Inc. v.
Super. Ct. (Locke) (1999) 20 Cal.4th 1178, 1222.) Under the
contract, the parties cannot disclose any information related directly or
indirectly to their agreement and project. (Complaint, ¶ 40; Ex. A-l, ¶ 11.) Second,
the Complaint discloses the parties’ private financial and proprietary
information. Defendants’ interests would be compromised if the information were
open to the public. Additionally, the information which Defendants seek to seal
is virtually identical to the information which this Court previously ordered
sealed in its order of March 26, 2024.  
Moreover, the parties have lodged
unredacted papers that highlight the proposed redactions.  The court has reviewed the papers, and the
following proposed redactions are narrowly tailored to protect Defendants’
overriding interests:
