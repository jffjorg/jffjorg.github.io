And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Bankruptcy Law Firm, PC filed a motion to enter default and default judgment against Vitamins Online, Inc. and Osman Khan. The motion is granted, pending the submission of a proposed judgment. The court previously rejected the request for entry of default due to incomplete information, including the name of the defendant on the complaint and the absence of service on the "Authorize Agent." The plaintiff filed a new proof of personal service on September 13, 2023, and the motion is supported by the declaration of Kathleen P. March, the principal of the Bankruptcy Law Firm, PC. The declaration attaches copies of the contracts between the parties and true and correct copies of bills itemizing work completed, but not paid. The plaintiff seeks $13,261.34 in fees, $2,461.43 in interest, and $795.00 in costs and disbursements. The motion is granted, but the plaintiff must provide a proposed judgment by the time of the hearing.
