And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by defendants Amparo Chavez and Pak Properties. The demurrer has been denied, and the court has found that the complaint sufficiently alleges facts to support the claims of intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED) and fraud.

The court has also denied the defendants' motion to strike the prayer for punitive damages, finding that the allegations of malice, oppression, and fraud in the complaint are sufficient to support an award of punitive damages.

The court has accepted the allegations in the complaint as true for the purposes of this demurrer, including the allegations that the defendants knew of the defects in the premises prior to the plaintiff's entry and failed to disclose them. The court has also found that the allegations of concealment of defects and failure to remediate them, even as they caused injury to the health of the plaintiff and other tenants, suffice to state a claim for punitive damages.

The court's decision is subject to reconsideration at the hearing on August 7, 2024.
