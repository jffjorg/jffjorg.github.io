I.       Factual
Background
 
            The
Court adopts the Court of Appeal’s summary of the case.
 
“In November 2020, the voters of Los Angeles County
(County) amended the County charter by enacting Measure J. The charter
amendment adopted by Measure J requires the County Board of Supervisors (Board)
to annually allocate at least 10 percent of the County’s locally generated
unrestricted revenues in the general fund to direct community investment (such
as youth programs, job training, rental assistance, and affordable housing) and
alternatives to incarceration (including health, mental health, and substance
use disorder programs). The charter amendment also specifically prohibits
Measure J funds from being allocated to any carceral system or law enforcement
agency.” (Coalition of County Unions v. Los Angeles County Bd. of
Supervisors (2023) 93 Cal.App.5th 1367, 1376 (Coalition).)
 
            “Immediately
after Measure J’s enactment, a coalition of County employee unions and two
individuals filed a petition for a peremptory writ of mandate prohibiting the
Board, the Los Angeles County Auditor (auditor), and the Los Angeles County
Chief Executive Officer (CEO) from enforcing the charter amendment. The trial
court granted the petition, concluding that the amendment would severely impair
the County’s ability to exercise essential government functions, including
managing the County’s budget and protecting public safety, which were matters
of statewide concern.” (Id. at 1376-77.) 
 
            The
Court of Appeal reversed the grant of the writ petition, stating: “Article XI,
section 4, subdivision (g) of the California Constitution provides that if a
county has adopted a charter for its own governance, ‘the general laws adopted
by the Legislature in pursuance of Section 1(b) of this article, shall, as
to such county, be superseded by said charter as to matters for which,
under this section it is competent to make provision in such charter, and for
which provision is made therein, except as herein otherwise expressly provided.’
(Italics added.) Such matters include ‘[t]he performance of functions required
by statute’ (id. art. XI, § 4, subd. (d) (§ 4(d))) and ‘[t]he powers and
duties of governing bodies and all other county officers’ (id., art. XI,
§ 4, subd. (e) (§ 4(e))). Because the charter amendment enacted by Measure J
defines a ‘power’ (allocating locally generated unrestricted revenues) and a ‘duty’
(directing 10 percent of such revenues to particular purposes) of the County’s ‘governing
bod[y]’ (the Board)—and because it concerns ‘[t]he performance of functions
required by statute’ (adopting a budget)—it is a permissible exercise of the
County’s authority to amend its charter. Further, contrary to petitioners’
contentions, the amendment neither impairs the exercise of essential government
functions nor violates state law. Measure J thus is enforceable….” (Coalition,
93 Cal.App.5th at 1376.) 
 
II.      Procedural History
 
On
December 8, 2020, petitioners Coalition of County Unions, Miguel A. Ortega, and
Ron Hernandez filed the operative Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Request
for Declaratory Relief. On January 27, 2021, respondents Los Angeles County Board
of Supervisors; Arlene Barerra, in her official capacity as Los Angeles County
Auditor; and Fesia Davenport, in her official capacity as Los Angeles County
Chief Executive Officer (collectively, “County”) filed an Answer.  
 
On
June 17, 2021, the Court (Hon. Mary H. Strobel) issued and adopted its
tentative ruling  as its proposed
statement of decision. 
 
On
July 7, 2021, the Court granted Re-Imagine Los Angeles County Coalition and
Thomas Newman’s ex parte application for leave to intervene. The Court granted
discretionary, as opposed to compulsory, intervention. On the same date,
intervenors[1]
filed an Answer in Intervention. 
 
On
July 14, 2021, after receiving objections and responses to the proposed
statement of decision, the Court issued its Final Statement of Decision:
Petition for Writ of Mandate, which granted the petition for writ of mandate
and ordered petitioner to lodge and serve a proposed form of judgment and writ.

 
On
July 30, 2021, pursuant to petitioners’ request, the second cause of action for
declaratory relief was dismissed without prejudice. 
 
On
August 16, 2021, the Court entered judgment in favor of petitioners and issued
a writ prohibiting respondents from enforcing Measure J.
 
On
July 28, 2023, the Court of Appeal issued its opinion reversing the grant of
the writ petition and directing the trial court to enter a new judgment denying
the petition, and, on July 31, 2023, modified that opinion. (Coalition,
93 Cal.App.5th at 1407.)   On October 27, 2023, having reversed the judgment
and directed entry of judgment denying the petition, the Court of Appeal issued
a remittitur. 
 
III.     Analysis
 
A.          
Entitlement
to Fees under Code of Civil Procedure § 1021.5
 
Intervenors seek an award of attorney fees pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure § 1021.5. “Upon motion, a court may award attorneys’
fees to a successful party against one or more opposing parties in any action
which has resulted in the enforcement of an important right affecting the
public interest….” (CCP § 1021.5.) “[E]ligibility for section 1021.5 attorney
fees is established when ‘(1) plaintiffs’ action “has resulted in the
enforcement of an important right affecting the public interest,” (2) “a
significant benefit, whether pecuniary or nonpecuniary has been conferred on
the general public or a large class of persons” and (3) “the necessity and
financial burden of private enforcement are such as to make the award
appropriate.”’” (Conservatorship of Whitley (2010) 50 Cal.4th 1206,
1214.)
 
1.           
Successful Party
 
A party “may be
considered successful if they succeed on any significant issue in the
litigation that achieves some of the benefit they sought in bringing suit.” (Ebbetts
Pass Forest Watch v. Department of Forestry & Fire Protection (2010)
187 Cal.App.4th 376, 382.) In determining whether the issue upon which a party
prevailed is significant, “the court must critically analyze the surrounding
circumstances of the litigation and pragmatically assess the gains achieved by
the action.” (Ibid.)
 
Here, intervenors
succeeded in obtaining a reversal of the judgment in favor of petitioners,
thereby obtaining a denial of the petition and upholding the legality of
Measure J. (See Answer in Intervention, Prayer for Relief at ¶ 1.) Because
intervenors prevailed on a significant issue in the litigation, intervenors are
successful parties under section 1021.5. Petitioners do not argue otherwise.
 
2.           
Enforcement of Important
Right Affecting the Public Interest
 
“In assessing whether an
action has enforced an important right, courts should generally realistically
assess the significance of that right in terms of its relationship to the
achievement of fundamental legislative goals. As to the benefit, it may be
conceptual or doctrinal and need not be actual and concrete; further, the
effectuation of a statutory or constitutional purpose may be sufficient ...
[However,] [t]he benefit must inure primarily to the public. Thus, the statute
directs the judiciary to exercise judgment in attempting to ascertain the
‘strength’ or ‘societal importance’ of the right involved.” (Sandlin v.
McLaughlin (2020) 50 Cal.App.5th 805, 829, quoting Choi v. Orange County
Great Park Corp. (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 524, 531, internal quotations and
citations omitted.)
 
Petitioners do not directly address or dispute
whether the “important right” element of a fee award under CCP § 1021.5 is
satisfied.
 
Through their appeal, intervenors enforced the
County’s “home rule” authority over budgeting under the California
Constitution. (Int. Decl. Ex. U at 22-33; Coalition, 93 Cal.App.5th at
1388-90.) Consequently, intervenors have enforced an important right – the vindication
of constitutional powers. (See Harbor v. Deukmejian (1987) 43 Cal.3d
1078, 1103 [holding that the vindication of the principle that “the Governor’s
power to veto legislation cannot be exercised to invalidate part of a bill
which is not part of an appropriation bill” under state constitution results in
enforcement of important right affecting public interest].) 
 
Further, proponents of Measure J asserted that “the
measure would ‘address the root causes of crime’ through restorative justice
programs, counseling and mental health services, job training, and supportive
housing, thus reducing crime.” (Coalition, 93 Cal.App.5th at 1392,
italics in original quoting L.A. County Official Sample Ballot, Gen. Elec.
(Nov. 3, 2020) argument in favor of Measure J, p. 35.) By approving Measure J,
voters in Los Angeles County appear to have agreed that the measure would advance
public safety. (Coalition, 93 Cal.App.5th at 1392.) Accordingly,
intervenors’ appeal has benefitted the public. 
 
Thus, for the foregoing reasons, by succeeding on
appeal, intervenors enforced an important right affecting the public interest
by stabilizing the funding of “certain categories of expenditures that are
priorities for County voters.” (Id. at 1391.) 
 
3.           
Significant Benefit
Conferred on General Public or Large Class of Persons
 
“Whether a successful
party’s lawsuit confers a ‘significant benefit’ on the general public or a
large class of persons is a function of (1) ‘the significance of the benefit,’
and (2) ‘the size of the class receiving [the] benefit.’ [Citation.] In
evaluating these factors, courts are to ‘realistic[ally] assess[ ]’ the
lawsuit’s ‘gains’ ‘in light of all the pertinent circumstances.’ [Citation.]” (La
Mirada Avenue Neighborhood Assn. of Hollywood v. City of Los Angeles (2018)
22 Cal.App.5th 1149, 1158.)  A
significant benefit can be found “simply from the effectuation of a fundamental
constitutional or statutory policy” “from a realistic assessment, in light of
all the pertinent circumstances, of the gains which have resulted in a
particular case.” (Woodland Hills Residents Assn., Inc. v. City Council
(1979) 23 Cal.3d 917, 939-40.)
 
Petitioners do not
directly address or dispute whether the “general public” element of a fee award
under CCP § 1021.5 is satisfied.
 
For the reasons stated
above with respect to enforcement of an important right, petitioner
demonstrates that a significant benefit was conferred on the general public. (La
Mirada, 22 Cal.App.5th at 1158 [finding when proper enforcement of law is
the public benefit, “the significant benefit and important right requirements
of section 1021.5 to some extent dovetail”].) 
 
4.           
Necessity and Financial
Burden of Private Enforcement
 
“[T]he necessity and
financial burden requirement really examines two issues: whether private
enforcement was necessary and whether the financial burden of private
enforcement warrants subsidizing the successful party’s attorneys.” (Whitley,
50 Cal.4th at 1214.) 
                        
a.           
Necessity
 
In the Petition, petitioners
named the County Board of Supervisors, auditor, and CEO as respondents.
Intervenors subsequently obtained leave to appear in this proceeding. “Where…private
parties have voluntarily joined in cases that government entities are required
to prosecute or defend, the trial court must exercise its discretion to
determine ‘the necessity, significance, and value of private counsel's services’
and is not bound by the characterizations or tactical decisions of private
counsel.” (San Diego Municipal Employees Assn. v. City of San Diego
(2016) 244 Cal.App.4th 906, 915, quoting Committee to Defend Reproductive
Rights v. A Free Pregnancy Center (1991) 229 Cal.App.3d 633, 642-43.) 
 
“In the circumstances of
this case, an attorney fee award is dependent upon an ultimate finding of the
trial court that the colitigating private party rendered necessary and
significant services of value to the public or to a large class of persons
benefited by the result of the litigation. [¶] Important factors the trial
court should address in determining if the services of the private party were
necessary, so as to support that ultimate finding, are these: (1) Did the
private party advance significant factual or legal theories adopted by the
court, thereby providing a material non de minimis contribution to its
judgment, which were nonduplicative of those advanced by the governmental
entity? (2) Did the private party produce substantial evidence significantly
contributing to the court's judgment which was not produced by the governmental
entity, and which was neither duplicative of nor merely cumulative to the
evidence produced by the governmental entity?” (Committee to Defend
Reproductive Rights, 229 Cal.App.3d at 642-43.) The Court should assess
whether the private party’s “contribution to the…action was more than merely
helpful or even substantial” and whether “it was necessary to the ultimate
success of the [action].” (Lyons v. Chinese Hospital Assn. (2006) 136
Cal.App.4th 1331, 1350; see also Ciani v. San Diego Trust & Savings Bank
(1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 563, 573-74 [moving party must show more than mere “helpful
activity”].)
 
With respect to the
instant matter, the Court of Appeal addressed “whether a county may adopt a
charter provision that restricts its board of supervisors’ discretion over the
county’s budget.” (Coalition, 93 Cal.App.5th at 1383.) In holding that
the county may do so, the Court of Appeal made three principle findings.  First, the Court of Appeal found that Measure
J, through which the County charter was amended, was a proper exercise of the
County’s “home rule” of its local affairs. (Id. at 1389.)  Second, the Court of Appeal found that Measure
J does not impair the County’s exercise of essential government functions, namely,
managing the County’s budget, particularly with respect to public safety. (Id.
at 1390-91.)  Third, the Court of Appeal
found that state statutes governing county budgets do not exclude voters from adopting
binding budget priorities, notwithstanding reference in those statutes to
duties of the board of supervisors. (Id. at 1392-1400.) The Court of
Appeal further noted that, even if an exclusive delegation to the board of
supervisors were implied from the statutes, “Measure J neither purports to
delegate to the voters the task of adopting a budget nor seeks to prevent the
Board from doing so.” (Id. at 1399.) 
 
            At the very least, with respect to the third finding by
the Court of Appeal concerning exclusive delegation, this Court finds that
intervenors made necessary contribution toward the success of the appeal.  The Final Statement of Decision concluded
that certain state statutes (specifically the County Budget Act, Government
Codes sections 30603-30608, and Government Code section 26227) delegate
exclusive authority over the County budget to the Board of Supervisors.
(7/14/21 Statement of Decision at 13-21.) On appeal from that decision, intervenors
argued that two “paramount factors” concerning exclusive delegation weighed in
favor of finding that these state statutes do not exclusively delegate
budgeting to the Board of Supervisors. (Int. Ex. U at 39-49.)  The first factor is whether the statute used
“legislative body” or “governing body, as opposed to “city council” or “board
of supervisors,” the latter of which leads to a stronger inference of exclusive
delegation.  The second factor is whether
the subject at issue was a “statewide concern” or a “municipal affair.” 
 
            With respect to the first paramount factor, intervenors
argued that the County Budget Act used the term “board” not because the
Legislature intended to delegate budgeting exclusively to the Board of
Supervisors, but because the statute pertained to counties. (Int. Ex. U at
41-42.) The Court of Appeal adopted this argument and specifically attributed
it to intervenors, stating: “As intervenors correctly note, unlike many
state laws that apply equally to city and county governments, the County Budget
Act applies only to counties, specifying the procedures that county boards of
supervisors must follow in adopting a budget. [Citation.] In light of the
County Budget Act's scope and purpose, it is unsurprising that the Legislature
uses the term “board” since there is no other local legislative or governing
body that could enact a county budget…. We therefore do not perceive the
references to the “board of supervisors” in the County Budget Act to be a
useful indicator of the Legislature's intent with regard to exclusive
delegation.” (Coalition, 93 Cal.App.5th at 1398.) 
 
            In addition, the Court of Appeal cited California
Cannabis Coalition v. City of Upland (2017) 3 Cal.5th 924, 945-46, for the
proposition that an “unambiguous indication” to constrain initiative power was
required before limiting budgeting governance to the Board of Supervisors. (Coalition,
93 Cal.App.5th at 1398.) Intervenors discussed this case in their opening and
reply briefs. (Int. Ex. U at 37, 60-62.) The County did not. (Int. Exs. W, X.) 
 
            As for the second paramount factor (i.e., whether
the subject at issue was a “statewide concern” or a “municipal affair”), intervenors
argued that the presence of some state interests in a state statute is not
conclusive of a legislative intent to bar the right of initiative. (Int. Ex. U
at 44-45.) Intervenors cited Pettye v. City and County of San Francisco
(2004) 118 Cal.App.4th 233 and Empire Waste Management v. Town of Windsor
(1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 714 for the assertion that statutes asserting state
interests can leave room for local decision making. (Int. Ex. U at 44, 47, Ex.
V at 27.) The County, by contrast, cited Pettye for a different reason (i.e.,
as an example of preemption) in its opening brief. (Int. Ex. W at 69-70.) The
County did not cite Empire Waste at all. (Int. Exs. W, X.)
 
Citing both Pettye
and Empire Waste, the Court of Appeal adopted intervenors’ reasoning and
found that the County Budget Act governed the timing and reporting of budgets
but left the decisions concerning substantive budget allocations to counties. (Coalition,
93 Cal.App.5th at 1401-02.) This finding further parallels intervenors’ framing
of the state statutes as ones of procedure, not substance. (Int. Ex. U at 35 [“[T]he
state statutes mainly detail a timeline and procedures by which a county budget
must be adopted. By contrast, Measure J regulates the authority of the Board of
Supervisors to make certain substantive budgetary decisions”].) 
 
Having compared
intervenors’ and the County’s briefs to the Coalition opinion, this
Court finds that intervenors’ arguments were necessary for the Court of Appeal
to have found that state statutes do not exclusively delegate budgeting to the
Board of Supervisors—a finding necessary to reverse the trial court’s ruling
and to uphold Measure J. 
 
b.           
Financial Burden
 
Petitioners argue that intervenors
have a disqualifying pecuniary interest in the matter because intervenors stand
to receive funding as a result of Measure J. (Opp. at 11:11-20.) “Section
1021.5 was not designed as a method for rewarding litigants motivated by their
own pecuniary interests who only coincidentally protect the public interest.” (Austin
v. Board of Retirement (1989) 209 Cal.App.3d 1528, 1535.)
 
However, the fact that
intervenors may potentially avail themselves of additional funding as a result
of Measure J does not mean that intervenors’ financial interest is
disqualifying. “Where personal benefits are a step removed from the results of
the litigation, the potential financial benefit is indirect and speculative,
and thus, a trial court does not abuse its discretion in concluding that the
financial burden criterion is satisfied for purposes of section 1021.5.” (People
v. Investco Management & Development LLC (2018) 22 Cal.App.5th 443, 470.)

 
Here, intervenors are not
assured of receiving funding as a result of the upholding of Measure J. “[W]hile
Measure J directs a percentage of Los Angeles County’s budgets to broad
categories of programs, it does not require the Board to fund any particular
programs, nor does it direct the levels at which new or existing programs must
be funded.” (Coalition, 93 Cal.App.5th at 1405.) Because the Board has
discretion within the confines of Measure J to determine which programs receive
funding, any financial interest intervenors may have is merely speculative and
insufficient to defeat their claim for attorney fees under CCP § 1021.5. Accordingly,
given the uncertainty of receiving funding under Measure J, the financial
burden of intervenors in litigating this writ proceeding warrant a fee award
under CCP § 1021.5. 
 
B.          
Reasonableness
of Fees Requested
 
Intervenors move for $503,094.63
in fees and expenses. The request is comprised of the fees on the merits, the
fees incurred in connection with the fee motion, and out-of-pocket expenses. 
 
1.           
Merits
 
With respect to the fees
incurred in obtaining reversal of the judgment on appeal, petitioner seeks a
total of $130,515, calculated as follows:
 



Timekeeper

Additional
  Multiplier for Merits


154,711.00




TOTAL
  FOR MERITS:


$464,133.00



 
            The Court finds the asserted hourly rates are reasonable,
and petitioners do not meaningfully advance any reasons why the Court should
find otherwise. 
 
            Intervenors
seek a 1.5 multiplier. Courts look to the following factors, among others, in
determining whether a multiplier is appropriate: “(1) the novelty and
difficulty of the questions involved, and the skill displayed in presenting
them; (2) the extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded other
employment by the attorneys; (3) the contingent nature of the fee award, both
from the point of view of eventual victory on the merits and the point of view
of establishing eligibility for an award; (4) the fact that an award against
the state would ultimately fall upon the taxpayers ….” (See Serrano v.
Priest (1977) 20 Cal.3d 25, 48.)
 
            Here, the Court finds that a
multiplier is potentially warranted. The appeal involved complex issues
concerning constitutional separation of powers between the State and charter
counties. To the extent that the Court of Appeal did not adopt intervenors’
arguments (e.g., their preemption argument), the Court has discretion to compensate intervenors
for time spent on the unsuccessful legal theories. “Attorneys generally must
pursue all available legal avenues and theories in pursuit of their clients'
objectives; it is impossible, as a practical matter, for an attorney to know in
advance whether or not his or her work on a potentially meritorious legal
theory will ultimately prevail.” (Greene v. Dillingham Construction, N.A.,
Inc. (2002) 101 Cal.App.4th 418, 424, quoting Sokolow v. County of San
Mateo (1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 231, 250.) Considering the complexity of the
issues, intervenors were entitled to assert the arguments they thought were best
suited to address why the statement of decision was in error. 
 
Counsel
for petitioner also agreed to represent petitioner on a partially contingent
basis with significantly reduced rates. (Larson Decl. ¶ 3.) A multiplier is
designed to address the risk that counsel bears of not receiving payment. (Graham
v. DaimlerChrysler Corp. (2004) 34 Cal.4th 553, 580 [“The contingent fee
compensates the lawyer not only for the legal services he renders but for the
loan of those services”].) 
 
However,
while there may be good reasons for the Court to apply the 1.5 multiplier
requested by intervenors, the need for any such multiplier is counterbalanced
in equal measure by certain excessive billing evidenced by intervenors’ time
sheets. Intervenors double-, triple-, and quadrupled-billed for discussing the case.
(Int. Ex. A; see also Hildreth Decl. ¶¶ 2-5 & Ex. A.) Further, as
calculated by petitioners and not denied by intervenors, counsel spent 99 hours
researching before beginning drafting their appellate brief, 157 hours drafting
the opening brief, 95 hours drafting the reply brief, and 60.2 hours preparing
for 12 minutes of oral argument. (Opp. at 13:14-14:2.) Despite the complexity
of the issues presented by the appeal, these hours are still plainly excessive.
The Court notes that, while attorney Salvador Pérez, as the junior associate, appears
to have gained considerable experience in litigating this appeal, any
inefficiencies during the learning process are not reasonably compensable. (Larson
Reply Decl. ¶ 3.)
 
Based
on the foregoing, the Court awards intervenors the asserted $309,422.00
lodestar without a multiplier. 
 
2.           
Fee Motion
 
With respect to the fees
incurred in obtaining fees, petitioner seeks a total of $29,256.50, calculated
as follows:
 



Timekeeper


Hours


Rate


Lodestar




Fredric D. Woocher


2


$900


$1,800.00




Dale K. Larson


11.2


$800


$8,960.00




Salvador E. Pérez


23.7


$495


$11,731.50




Fees for Fee Motion Reply and Argument 


$6,765.00




TOTAL FOR FEE MOTION:


$29,256.50




 
            The Court finds the asserted hourly rates are reasonable, and petitioners
do not meaningfully advance any reasons why the Court should find otherwise.
 
            The
Court finds that the hours billed for the motion and reply are excessive. The
Court finds that a 30 percent reduction is appropriate. Accordingly, the fees
for the fee motion to be recovered are $20,479.20.
 
C.          
Out-of-Pocket Expenses
 
Intervenors
seek to recover $9,705.13 in costs. (Larson Decl. ¶ 7 & Ex. B.) Petitioners
object to inventors’ breakdown of the computer research costs as vague. Intervenors
provided a compilation of the total Westlaw charges by month. (Larson Decl. ¶ 7
& Ex. B.) Given the complexity of the legal issues presented in the appeal,
the charges are reasonable on their face. Intervenors may recover the total
costs requested in the amount of $9,705.13. 
 


IV.     Conclusion
 
            The
motion is GRANTED IN PART. Using the
appropriate lodestar approach, and based on the foregoing findings and in view
of the totality of the circumstances, the total and reasonable amount of
attorney fees incurred for the work performed in connection with the appeal of
the judgment in the Petition for Writ of Mandate is $339,606.33 ($309,422.00 merits + $20,479.20 fee motion
+ $9,705.13 costs). Such fees are awarded to intervenors Re-Imagine Los Angeles County
Coalition and Thomas Newman and against petitioners Coalition of County Unions,
Miguel A. Ortega, and Ron Hernandez.
