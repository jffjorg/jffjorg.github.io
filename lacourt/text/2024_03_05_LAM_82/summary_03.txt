And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the applications for writ of possession and writ of mandate filed by Americredit Financial Services against defendants Damien R. Escalante, Richard Dertinger, and K.O. Towing and Recovery. The judge has denied the application for writ of possession filed against K.O. Towing and Recovery, as there is no showing that the company has possession of the vehicle. The judge has also denied the application for writ of possession filed against Richard Dertinger, as the plaintiff failed to provide proof of service of the necessary documents to the defendant.

The judge has granted the application for writ of mandate filed against Damien R. Escalante, finding that the plaintiff has established the probable validity of its claim to possession of the property, a 2020 Ford Super Duty F-25. The writ of possession will issue only as to the address listed in the Retail Installment Sales Contract, which is 3601 W 5th St, Santa Ana, CA. The judge has also determined that an undertaking is not required, as the amount owed ($59,494.93) exceeds the market value of the vehicle ($33,334.00).
