 Case Number:  24STCV00979    Hearing Date:   March 5, 2024    Dept:  82 APPLICATION FOR WRIT OF POSSESSION
 
Date:               3/5/24 (1:30 PM) 
Case:               Americredit Financial Services v. Damien R. Escalante et
al. (24STCV00979) 
  
TENTATIVE
RULING:
 
With respect to defendant K.O. Towing and Recovery, the UNOPPOSED
Application for Writ of Possession by petitioner Americredit Financial Services
is DENIED. There is no showing as to why K.O. Towing and Recovery would have
possession of the vehicle. The Retail Installment Sales Contract shows that the
subject vehicle was purchased by defendants Damien R. Escalante and Richard
Dertinger. (Williams Decl. ¶ 5 & Ex. A.) 
 
With respect to defendant Richard Dertinger, the UNOPPOSED
Application for Writ of Possession by petitioner Americredit Financial Services
is DENIED. Under CCP § 512.030, prior to the hearing on an application for a
writ of possession, the defendant “shall be served” with specific documents,
including the Summons and Complaint, the Notice of Application and Hearing, and
a copy of the application and any affidavits. Plaintiff has neither filed any
proofs of service of the foregoing with the Court nor attached proofs of
service to the filed document. Because plaintiff has failed to provide proof of
service on defendant Richard Dertinger as required, the application cannot be
granted.
 
With respect to defendant Damien R. Escalante, the UNOPPOSED
Application for Writ of Mandate is GRANTED. The Court finds that plaintiff has
established the probable validity of its claim to possession of the property,
namely, a 2020 Ford Super Duty F-25 (VIN 1FT8W2BT4LEC64673). Because the Retail
Installment Sales Contract lists 3601 W 5th St., Santa Ana, CA 92703
as the address for defendant Escalante, the writ of possession shall issue only
as to this address. 
 
No undertaking is required. The amount owed ($59,494.93)
exceeds the market value of the vehicle ($33,334.00). (CCP § 515.010; Williams
Decl. ¶ 9 & Ex. C.)
