23TRCV01750

1.     
Ajay Handa, et
al.’s Motion to Compel Plaintiff’s Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One,
and Request for Monetary Sanctions 
 
 
TENTATIVE RULING

Ajay Handa, et al.’s Motion to Compel Plaintiff’s
Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for Monetary Sanctions is
moot, in part, and granted, in part. 
 
Background
 
Plaintiff’s Complaint was filed on June 2, 2023.
Plaintiff alleges the following facts. Plaintiff slipped and fell at premises
owned or controlled by Defendants. 
 
Motion to
Compel
 
CCP § 2030.290 states: “If a party to whom
interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely response, the following
rules apply…The party propounding the interrogatories may move for an order
compelling response to the interrogatories.” (CCP § 2030.290(b).)  
 
Defendants served upon Plaintiff Form Interrogatories,
Set One, on December 5, 2023. (Decl., Jay M. Borgensen, ¶¶ 2-3). Defendant contends
that responses were served to the form interrogatories but that the responses
were not verified. (Id. at 4.) Because the responses did not consist solely of
objections, the responses must be verified. CCP § 2030.250. Unverified
responses are tantamount to no responses at all. Appleton v. Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 632, 636.
 
On February 29, 2024, Plaintiff filed and served a
response to the motion which he called a “Request for Withdrawel (sic) of
Defendnant’s (sic) Motion[. . . ]” With this request, Plaintiff attached the
verification which was purportedly served on February 13, 2024.
 
Therefore, the motion to compel responses to Form
Interrogatories, Set One, is now deemed moot. 
 
Sanctions
 
Defendants’ request for monetary sanctions is granted.
 
Proper
verified responses were only served after Defendants incurred the time and
expense to file the motion to compel. Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1348(a)
states: “The court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a
party who files a motion to compel discovery, even though no opposition to the
motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was withdrawn, or the requested
discovery was provided to the moving party after the motion was filed.”
 
Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel are sanctioned the
total amount of $1,060.00 which is the amount set forth in the declaration of
counsel. The Court determines that this amount is reasonable. Sanctions are
payable within 30 days of this date.  
 
Defendants are ordered to give notice of this ruling.
