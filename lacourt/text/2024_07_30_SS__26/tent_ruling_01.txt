  Case Number:  18STCV10177    Hearing Date:   July 30, 2024    Dept:  26  Dai v. Paul P. Cheng & Associates, et al.MOTION FOR
LEAVE
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Plaintiff Young Chow Dai’s Motion for Leave is DENIED.
 
 
ANALYSIS:  
 
On December 31, 2018,
Plaintiff Young Chow Dai (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant action against
Defendants Paul P. Cheng & Associates and Marsha S. Mao. Plaintiff filed
the operative Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”) on October 4, 2019 against
Defendants Paul P. Cheng (“Defendant Cheng”), Marsha S. Mao (“Defendant Mao”),
and Law Offices of Paul P. Cheng & Associates (“Defendant Cheng &
Associates”). The SAC, which arises from alleged wrongful actions in connection
with a settlement agreement, alleges causes of action for: (1) accounting; and
(2) fraud.  
 
On February 7, 2023,
Defendant Cheng filed a motion for summary judgment (“MSJ”). On March 1, 2023,
Defendant Cheng filed a motion to deem the truth of the matters in Defendant’s
Requests for Admission, Set One, served on Plaintiff, admitted and for monetary
sanctions. On April 12, 2023, Plaintiff filed a motion to transfer venue to the
Santa Monica Courthouse. 
 
On July 24, 2023, after
hearing and oral argument, the Court: (1) granted the MSJ filed by Defendant
Cheng; (2) granted Defendant Cheng’s motion to deem the truth of the matters in
Defendant’s Requests for Admission, Set One, as admitted and awarded Defendant
monetary sanctions; and (3) denied Plaintiff’s motion to transfer and change
venue. (Minute Order, 07/24/23.) On August 4, 2023, Defendant Cheng filed and
served Notice of Entry of Judgment or Order as to the Court’s July 24, 2023
order. 
 
On August 7, 2023,
Plaintiff filed a Motion to Vacate Judgment and Enter a
New and Different Judgment. On August 8, 2023, the Court entered judgment
in favor of Defendant Cheng and against Plaintiff. The Court’s order for entry
of summary judgment provides that “Plaintiff’s case against Defendant Paul P.
Cheng is therefore dismissed with prejudice.” (Minute Order, 08/08/23, p.
3:1-4.) Plaintiff filed an Amended Motion to Vacate Judgment and Enter a New
and Different Judgment on August 11, 2023. Plaintiff filed similar motions to
vacate on August 25, 2023 and September 29, 2023. 
 
In a ruling considering
all three Motions to Vacate, the Court denied the request to vacate the
judgment on January 17, 2024. (Minute Order, 01/17/24.) Plaintiff then filed a
Motion for Reconsideration on January 23, 2024. The Motion for Reconsideration was
denied on March 26, 2024. (Minute Order, 03/26/24.) On April 16, 2024, the
Court granted Defendant’s Motion to Deem Plaintiff a Vexatious Litigant.
(Minute Order, 04/16/24.) Plaintiff sought to challenge that ruling via a
motion in Department 1, which was denied on June 27, 2024. (Minute Order,
06/27/24.) 
 
The instant Motion for
Leave was filed by Plaintiff on May 2, 2024. The Motion was originally set for
hearing on July 3, 2024 and then continued to July 30, 2024. Defendant filed an
opposition on July 24, 2024. The instant Motion does not explain what relief is sought or
on what basis. “The memorandum must contain a statement of facts, a
concise statement of the law, evidence and arguments relied on, and a
discussion of the statutes, cases, and textbooks cited in support of the
position advanced.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1113(b).) Indeed, Plaintiff’s
failure to provide a memorandum as required by the Rule is an “admission that
the [request] is without merit and cause for its denial.” (Cal. Rules of Court,
Rule 3.1113(a), (b); In re Marriage of Falcone & Fyke (2012) 203
Cal.App.4th 964, 976.) As the Court cannot discern what relief Plaintiff seeks
or the legal basis for any relief, the Motion for Leave is denied.
 
Conclusion

Young Chow Dai’s Motion for Leave is DENIED.
