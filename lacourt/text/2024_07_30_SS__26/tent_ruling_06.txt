 Case Number:  LAM15K08385    Hearing Date:   July 30, 2024    Dept:  26   Hines  v. 7219-7225 West Sunset, LLC, et al.MOTION TO VACATE  JUDGMENT(CCP §§ 580, 585, 594) TENTATIVE RULING:   Defendant 7219-7225  West Sunset, LLC’s Motion to Vacate Judgment is DENIED.     ANALYSIS:   On July 6, 2015, Plaintiff Darnell Hines (“Plaintiff”) filed  this action for violation of civil rights against Defendant 7219-7225 West  Sunset, LLC (“Defendant”) Following Defendant’s failure to file a responsive  pleading, the Court entered default judgment in Plaintiff’s favor on April 28,  2016. Plaintiff filed an Acknowledgment of Satisfaction of Judgment on December  15, 2023.   Defendant filed the instant Motion to Vacate Judgment on  June 14, 2024. Plaintiff filed an opposition on July 10, 2024 and Defendant  replied on July 17, 2024.   Discussion   Request for  Judicial Notice and Evidentiary Objections   Defendant moves for  judicial notice of the following documents: (1) Verified Complaint for  Damages, filed 07/06/2015 in this case; (2) Entry of default judgment for money  damages, filed 04/28/2016 in this case; (3) Writ of execution issued by  plaintiff Darnell Hines on 11/23/2022 in this case; (4) Sheriffs Deed of Sale of  Real Property executed on October 13, 2023; (5) Article in the online  publication "The Legal Advocate" reporting that one Darnell Hines was  killed in a motor vehicle accident while driving a motorcycle on October 18,  2023; (6) Photograph purported to be that of plaintiff Darnell Hines riding a large, red motorcycle  appearing in an online fundraiser for his seven children created October 23,  2023; (7) the Court’s registrar of actions in this case; (8) The Sheriffs Deed  of Sale of (defendant's) Real Property recorded on November 3 6, 2023; (9)  Acknowledgement of Satisfaction of Judgment as to 7219-7225 West Sunset LLC  filed by judgment creditor Darnell Hines on 12/15/2023; (10) article in the  online publication www.avpress.com reporting that Darnell Hines was killed in a  motor vehicle accident while driving a motorcycle on October 18, 2023; and (11)  Los Angeles County Medical Examiner's Report, Case No. 202314229, in which the  Medical Examiner states the medical details and death of decedent Darnell Kina  Hines that occurred in Lancaster, CA on October 18, 2023.   The request broadly cites Evidence Code sections 452 and 453  without specifying how those statutes apply to the attached documents. The  request for judicial notice of the documents filed with the Court is granted  only as to the filing of those documents but not as to the truth of the  contents therein. (Evid. Code, § 452, sudb. (d); Sosinsky v. Grant  (1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 1548, 1560-1570.) The request for judicial notice of the  articles in the online publications “The Legal Advocate” and www.avpress.com,  and the following photograph are denied. No provision of Evidence Code sections  452 or 453 allows the Court to take judicial notice of facts in newspaper  articles and case law specifically holds that such content does not qualify as  “[f]acts and propositions that are not reasonably subject to dispute and are  capable of immediate and accurate determination by resort to sources of  reasonably indisputable accuracy.” (See People v. Ramos (1997) 15  Cal.4th 1133, 1167.) Finally, Defendant’s request for judicial notice of the certified  copy of the investigative report into the death of Darnell Kina Hines by the  Los Angeles County Medical Examiner is also denied. Defendant has not  demonstrated that Darnell Kina Hines is the same person as the named plaintiff  in this action such that the investigative report is relevant.    Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s objections to the  requests for judicial notice are sustained.    Death of Darnell Kina Hines   Defendant moves to vacate the writ of execution and  Sheriff’s sale of property on the grounds that Plaintiff passed away on October  18, 2023. For the reasons discussed above, Defendant has not demonstrated that  Plaintiff is deceased. Defendant has not provided an evidentiary basis for the Court to find  that Darnell Kina Hines, who purportedly passed away on October 18, 2023, is  the same person as the plaintiff in this action. Nor does Plaintiff’s lack of  direct argument against this evidence operate as an admission of its truth.  Defendant cites no authority for such a ruling. (See Reply, pp. 2:22-3:17.) Defendant  also moves to vacate the judgment in this action on the grounds that Darnell  Kina Hines was not disabled. Again, as there is no evidence that Darnell Kina  Hines is the same person as the Plaintiff, the judgment shall not be vacated on this basis.    Code of Civil Procedure sections 580(a), 585(c), and  594(a)   Defendant alternatively moves to vacate the judgment and  subsequent enforcement proceedings on the grounds that the Complaint fails to  allege a specific amount of monetary damages. In the Complaint, “Plaintiff  prays for no less than $4,000 in damages.” (Compl., p. 2:12-13.) Code of Civil  Procedure section 580 states in relevant part: “The relief granted to the  plaintiff, if there is no answer, cannot exceed that demanded in the complaint  . . . .” (Code Civ. Proc., § 580, subd (a).) Defendant does not explain how the  prayer for damages violates this language. The Complaint seeks damages of at  least $4,000.00 and the default judgment was for $4,000.00. The relief granted  to Plaintiff, therefore, did not exceed the demand of the Complaint.    Defendant also cites Code of Civil Procedure section 585,  subdivision (c) but that subdivision pertains to actions where the Summons and  Complaint were served by publication. In any event, Defendant does not set  forth or analyze the language from this statute or Code of Civil Procedure  section 594. In opposition, Plaintiff cites cases involving the same language  in the prayer for damages. In People ex rel. Lockyer v. Brar (2005) 134  Cal.App.4th 659, the complaint requested “no less than” $1 million in civil  penalties, and judgment was awarded in the amount of $1,787,500.00. (People  ex rel. Lockyer v. Brar (2005) 134 Cal.App.4th 659, 666.) The Court of  Appeals ruled that the complaint gave fair warning of the extent of the  defendant’s exposure in compliance with Code of Civil Procedure section 580. (Id.  at 666-668.) Defendant’s reply does not address this case law. The Court of  Appeals affirmed that due to the language in section 580, “in all default  judgments the demand sets a ceiling on recovery.” (Finney v. Gomez  (2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 527, 534.) Defendant misreads the case holding to  require the demand of the complaint to set a ceiling on recovery. This is not required  by either section 580 or case law.    Conclusion   Based on the foregoing, Defendant 7219-7225 West Sunset, LLC’s  Motion to Vacate Judgment is DENIED.     Court clerk to give notice.
