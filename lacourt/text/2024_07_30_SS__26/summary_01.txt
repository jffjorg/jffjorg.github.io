And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the plaintiff's motion for leave, which was filed on May 2, 2024. The motion did not provide a statement of facts, a concise statement of the law, evidence, and arguments relied on, and a discussion of the statutes, cases, and textbooks cited in support of the position advanced. The court cannot discern what relief the plaintiff seeks or the legal basis for any relief. The plaintiff's failure to provide a memorandum as required by the rule is an admission that the request is without merit and cause for its denial.
