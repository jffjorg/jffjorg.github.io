And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge denies the defendant's motion to vacate the judgment. The defendant claimed that the plaintiff, Darnell Hines, had passed away on October 18, 2023, and therefore the judgment should be vacated. However, the Court finds that the defendant has not provided sufficient evidence to prove that Darnell Kina Hines, the person who allegedly passed away, is the same person as the plaintiff in this action.

The defendant also claimed that the complaint fails to allege a specific amount of monetary damages, citing Code of Civil Procedure sections 580, 585, and 594. However, the Court finds that the complaint does specify a minimum amount of damages, $4,000, and that the default judgment was for the same amount.

The Judge also denies the defendant's request for judicial notice of certain documents, including articles from online publications and a photograph. The Judge finds that these documents do not qualify as "facts and propositions that are not reasonably subject to dispute and are capable of immediate and accurate determination by resort to sources of reasonably indisputable accuracy".

Overall, the Court finds that the defendant has not demonstrated sufficient grounds to vacate the judgment, and therefore the motion is denied.
