The judge has granted the petition for release of mechanic's lien filed by Julie Oates against Hi-Tech Builders, Inc. The petition was filed on December 28, 2023, and the hearing was continued to allow for proper notice to the respondent. The respondent has not filed a response to the petition. The judge has reviewed the petition and found that it contains all the required information, including the date of recordation of the claim of lien, the county where it was recorded, and the legal description of the property subject to the lien. The judge has also reviewed the proof of service filed by the petitioner, which shows that the papers were served on the respondent by delivery to its receptionist at its office. Therefore, the judge has granted the petition and ordered the petitioner to file and serve a proposed order within 20 days of the ruling.
