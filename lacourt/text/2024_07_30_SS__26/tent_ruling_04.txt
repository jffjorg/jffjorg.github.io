v. City of Whittier, et al.MOTION
TO DEEM REQUESTS FOR ADMISSION ADMITTED; 
REQUEST
FOR SANCTIONS(CCP § 2033.280)
TENTATIVE RULING:

Admission, Set One, Admitted; and Request for Sanctions is GRANTED. PLAINTIFF MARTHA DELIA ANDA AND
COUNSEL OF RECORD ARE ORDERED TO PAY SANCTIONS OF $245.00 TO DEFENSE COUNSEL

ANALYSIS:
 
On April 11, 2024, Defendant City of Whittier (“Defendant
Whittier”) served Requests for Admission, Set One, on Plaintiff Martha Delia
Anda (“Plaintiff”). (Motion, Verska Decl.,
Exh. A.) Despite a meet and confer effort, Plaintiff has not served responses
to the discovery. (Id. at ¶¶4-9.) Defendant Whittier filed the instant Motion
to Deem Requests for Admission, Set One, Admitted; and Request for Sanctions,
on May 30, 2024. No opposition has been filed to date. 
 
Discussion
 
There is no requirement for a prior meet and confer effort
before a motion to deem requests for admission can be filed. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2033.280.) Further, the motion can be brought at any time after the
responding party fails to provide the responses. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280.)
Due to Plaintiff’s failure to timely serve verified responses and resultant
waiver of objections, Defendant Whittier is entitled to an order deeming the
Requests for Admission admitted. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280.) 
 
The Court is required to award sanctions under the moving
statute. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).) While properly noticed, the
sanctions sought are excessive for a simple and unopposed motion. Pursuant to a
lodestar calculation, sanctions are awarded against Plaintiff in the amount of
$245.00 based on one hour of attorney time billed at $245.00 per hour. (Motion,
Verska Decl.,
¶11.) 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant City of Whittier’s Motion to Deem Requests for
Admission, Set One, Admitted; and Request for Sanctions is GRANTED. PLAINTIFF MARTHA DELIA ANDA AND
COUNSEL OF RECORD ARE ORDERED TO PAY SANCTIONS OF $245.00 TO DEFENSE COUNSEL
WITHIN 20 DAYS’ SERVICE OF THIS ORDER.
