Additionally, “If  a monetary sanction is authorized by any provision of this title, the court  shall impose that sanction unless it finds that one subject to the sanction  acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the  imposition of sanction unjust.” (Ibid.)   As the motion to  compel is granted, Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions is also granted.
