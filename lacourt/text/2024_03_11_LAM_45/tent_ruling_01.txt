Motion for Attorneys’ Fees
 
The court has considered
the moving, opposition, and reply papers.
The court GRANTS Plaintiffs’ motion for
attorney’s fees. The court awards Plaintiffs attorneys’ fees in the reduced
amount of $119,760.
 
Background
On March 8, 2021,
Plaintiffs Victor Burga and Adrienee Han (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) submitted
a written offer to purchase 119 N. Manhattan Place, Los Angeles CA from Defendant
Hoangtram Tong (“Seller”). On March 11, 2021, Defendant accepted the written
offer subject to the counteroffer of $1,082,000, and a legally binding
agreement between the parties was allegedly formed (the “Agreement”).
Plaintiffs were
served with three Notices of Buyer to Perform to clear three contingencies on
March 19, 2023 (the investigation contingency) and March 26, 2021 (the loan and
appraisal contingency) (collectively, the “Contingencies”). Plaintiffs allege
they timely cleared all contingencies identified in the Notices by March 29,
2021. However, on April 2, 2021, Defendant cancelled the escrow, representing
that the Agreement was void. Defendant claimed the Contingencies had not been
timely removed.
Thereafter,
Plaintiffs served a Demand to Close Escrow on Defendant on April 15, 2021,
designating April 19, 2021 as the escrow close date. Defendant ignored the
demand. Consequently, Plaintiffs initiated this action on April 22, 2021. On
April 26, 2021, Plaintiffs filed a Notice of Pendency of Action relating to the
subject property. On July 29, 2021, Plaintiffs filed the operative First
Amended Complaint, alleging the following causes of action: (1) breach of
contract and specific performance; and (2) declaratory judgment.
 On August 22, 2023, Defendant filed the
operative Second Amended Cross-Complaint alleging (1) breach of contract; (2)
interference with contractual relationship; (3) intentional misrepresentation;
and (4) negligent misrepresentation.
On November 16,
2023, the court granted Plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment and sustained
their demurrer to the Second Amended Cross-Complaint without leave to amend.
On December 22,
2023, the court entered judgment in favor of Plaintiffs and against Defendant with
respect to the First Amended Complaint for damages of $113,115.73 and with
respect as to the Second Amended Cross-Complaint. Per the judgment, Plaintiffs
would be awarded attorneys’ fees in an amount to be determined by motion. 
On February 15,
2024, Plaintiffs filed the instant motion for attorney’s fees, seeking $123,200
in fees. Defendant filed an opposition on February 27, 2024 and Plaintiff
replied on March 4, 2024.
 
Legal Standard
 
“As a general
rule, the prevailing party may recover certain statutory costs incurred in the
litigation up to and including entry of judgment. [Citations.] These costs may
include attorney fees, if authorized by contract, statute . . . or law.
[Citation.] . . . attorney fees require a separate noticed motion.
[Citations.]” (Lucky United Props. Inv., Inc. v. Lee (2010) 185
Cal.App.4th 125, 137.) This motion may be brought: (1) after judgment or
dismissal, for fees incurred “up to and including the rendition of judgment in
the trial court--including attorney’s fees on an appeal before the rendition of
judgment…”; and (2) on an interim basis, upon remittitur of appeal, of only
fees incurred on appeal. (CRC, Rule 3.1702(b)-(c).)
In determining
what fees are reasonable, California courts apply the “lodestar” approach. (See,
e.g., Holguin v. DISH Network LLC (2014) 229 Cal.App.4th 1310, 1332.)
This inquiry “begins with the ‘lodestar,’ i.e., the number of hours reasonably
expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate.” (See PLCM Group v.
Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095.) From there, the “[t]he lodestar
figure may then be adjusted, based on consideration of factors specific to the
case, in order to fix the fee at the fair market value for the legal services
provided.” (Id.) Relevant factors include: “(1) the novelty and
difficulty of the questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting
them, (3) the extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded other
employment by the attorneys, [and] (4) the contingent nature of the fee award.”
(Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th
1122, 1132.)
 
Discussion
Entitlement to Attorneys’ Fees
Plaintiffs move
for attorney’s fees pursuant to the attorney’s fees provision at Paragraph 25
of the Agreement and CCP § 1717. 
Paragraph 25 of the
Agreement states: “In any action, proceeding, or arbitration between Buyer and
Seller arising out of this Agreement, the prevailing Buyer or Seller shall be
entitled to reasonable attorney fees and costs from the non-prevailing Buyer or
Seller, except as provided in paragraph 22A.” (Motion at pg. 5; Goldberg Decl.
¶21, Exh. 5 FAC, Exh. B at ¶ 25.) As provided under Paragraph 22A, the parties
agreed to mediate any dispute before pursuing arbitration or litigation, and
failure to abide by this requirement would preclude an award for attorney fees.
(Id. at ¶ 22A.) However, under Paragraph 22C, certain exclusions
applied; for instance, a party could file a court action in order to enable the
recording of a notice of pending action. (Id. at ¶ 22C(2)(ii).)
Plaintiffs assert
that they had first filed this action in order to record a notice of pending
action in order to prevent the subject property from being sold before relief
could be granted, and after initiated this action, the parties engaged in
mediation before mediator Barbara Reeves of JAMS. (Goldberg Decl. ¶¶ 18-19.)
In opposition,
Defendant contends that there was no pre-litigation mediation, and therefore
under Paragraph 22A of the Agreement, Plaintiffs are not entitled to an award
of attorneys’ fees. (Opposition at pg. 5.) However, the court does not find
this argument persuasive. While the parties did not engaged in mediation prior
to initiating this action, the Agreement under Paragraph 22C affords the
parties the ability to initiate litigation in order to preserve their rights
without waiving their entitlement to attorney fees. As shown in the court’s
records, a Notice of Pendency of Action was filed days after the Complaint had
been filed on April 22, 2021. (See Notice of Pendency of Action, filed on April
26, 2021.) Furthermore, Defendant does not contend that the parties did not
participate in mediation with JAMS. 
Furthermore, as
set forth above, on December 22, 2023, the court entered judgment in this
matter in favor of Plaintiffs and against Defendant with respect to the First
Amended Complaint for a total amount of $117,723.42. Thus, because they are the
prevailing parties under the Agreement and had not waived their ability to
recover attorneys’ fees, the court finds Plaintiffs have met their burden in
establishing that they are entitled to attorney’s fees in this matter.
 
Reasonableness of Attorneys’ Fees
Plaintiffs seek to
recover $123,200 in attorney’s fees. (Goldberg Decl., ¶¶ 2-3, 5.) Plaintiffs’
counsels’ hourly rate is $400 per hour and Plaintiff seeks to recover 305 hours
expended on this action. (Id. at ¶¶
1, 6.) Additionally, Plaintiff’s counsel anticipates an additional 3 hours in
order to review any opposition, draft any reply papers, and prepare and attend
the hearing, amounting to $1,200. (Id.at ¶5.)
Plaintiff’s
counsel attests to over 32 years of experience, with experience in real
property disputes and commercial litigation. (Goldberg Decl., ¶ 6.) Additionally,
he further attests that his partner, Counsel Janson Cirlin, has 20 years of
experience, with experience in real estate and commercial litigation. Based on the
experience of Plaintiffs’ counsels, the court finds the claimed hourly rate of
$400 is reasonable. 
In opposition,
Defendant first argues that Plaintiffs’ counsels have engaged in block billing.
(Opposition at pp. 8-10.) However, the court disagrees with this contention. “Block billing is not objectionable ‘per se,’
though it certainly does increase the risk that the trial court, in a
reasonable exercise of its discretion, will discount a fee request. Block
billing is particularly problematic in cases where there is a need to separate
out work that qualifies for compensation…from work that does not. (Jaramillo
v. County of Orange (2011) 200 Cal.App.4th 811, 830 [citations
omitted].) Even though the submitted billing entries have grouped certain tasks
together, the descriptions provided for each block sufficiently apprises the court about the
tasks that were conducted. Therefore, in this instance, the usage of
block-billing is not objectionable because the entries are not vague.
Next, Defendant argues that
Plaintiffs’ counsel has engaged in duplicative billing relating to preparation
of Vadim Khabyuk’s declaration. (Opposition at pp. 10-11.) Under the
circumstances, the court does not find it unreasonable that several days were
spent preparing Vadim Khabyuk’s declaration. As shown within the court’s
record, this declaration comprised of 18 exhibits, and they were necessary for
Plaintiffs to meet their burden on summary judgment. Thus, the fees incurred in
preparing Vadim Khabyuk’s declaration were reasonable.
Defendant also asserts that
it is questionable that Plaintiffs’ counsel was able to bill over 8 hours in a
single day on September 19, 2022, and he reasons that Counsel Goldberg is
seeking recovery of work that is normally conducted by clerical staff.
(Opposition at pp. 11-12.) However, Defendant fails to submit any prove that Counsel
Goldberg engaged in clerical work. Instead, Defendant merely points to billing
entries relating to preparation of Plaintiffs’ demurrer to the First Amended
Cross-Complaint. 
Lastly, Defendant’s argues
that it is unreasonable for Plaintiffs to recovery attorney fees associated
with the motion to dismiss pursuant to CCP 128.7, which the court denied. In
this regard, the court finds that the it would be unreasonable to award costs
associated with the motion to dismiss because the court found that Plaintiffs
failed to abide by the 21-day safe harbor requirement, and as a result, the
court did not reach a decision on the merits of that motion. (See November 16,
2023 Order at pp. 7-9.) Thus, the court reduces the total fee award by $3,440
to represent the time expended on the motion to dismiss. 
Based on the
foregoing, the court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion for attorney’s fees. The court
awards Plaintiff the reduced amount of his attorney’s fees, $119,760.
 
It is so ordered.
