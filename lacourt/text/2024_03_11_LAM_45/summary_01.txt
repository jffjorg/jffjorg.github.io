And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion for attorney's fees filed by the Plaintiffs, Victor Burga and Adrienee Han. The Plaintiffs are seeking $123,200 in attorney's fees for their representation in this matter. The judge has reduced the requested amount to $119,760 after considering the reasonableness of the fees claimed by the Plaintiffs' counsel.

The Plaintiffs had entered into a written agreement with the Defendant, Hoangtram Tong, for the sale of a property. The agreement included a provision for attorney's fees in the event of litigation. The Plaintiffs cleared all contingencies and demanded the escrow to close, but the Defendant cancelled the escrow and the parties engaged in mediation. The Plaintiffs then filed a lawsuit and obtained summary judgment and damages.

The judge has considered the Defendant's arguments that the Plaintiffs are not entitled to attorney's fees due to lack of pre-litigation mediation and that the Plaintiffs' counsels engaged in block billing and duplicative billing. The judge has found that the Plaintiffs have met their burden in establishing their entitlement to attorney's fees and that the claimed hourly rate of $400 is reasonable. The judge has also reduced the total fee award by $3,440 to represent the time expended on the motion to dismiss which was denied.
