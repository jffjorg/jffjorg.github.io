And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the motion to compel initial responses to form interrogatories – employment (set one) filed by the plaintiff, Francisco Javier Cervantes Manriquez. The defendant, Kristina Rozina Bonhomme, failed to respond to the interrogatories despite being properly served and given the opportunity to do so. The court finds that the plaintiff's form interrogatories were properly served and that the defendant's failure to respond constitutes a misuse of the discovery process. The court grants the motion to compel and orders the defendant to serve responses to the interrogatories within 30 days.

The court also grants the plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,410.00, which represents the reasonable expenses incurred by the plaintiff as a result of the defendant's failure to respond. The sanctions are imposed against the defendant, Kristina Rozina Bonhomme, and must be paid within 30 days of this order.

The court's ruling is based on California Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.260(a), 1010.6(a)(3)(B), 2030.290(a), and 2023.030(a), as well as Government Code sections 12940 et seq, 12940(m), and 12940(n). The court's decision is in line with the precedent set in Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 404.
