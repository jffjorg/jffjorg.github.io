Significant Statements:
  - "To state a cause of action for legal malpractice, a plaintiff must plead (1) the duty of the attorney to use such skill, prudence, and diligence as members of his or her profession commonly possess and exercise; (2) a breach of that duty; (3) a proximate causal connection between the breach and the resulting injury; and (4) actual loss or damage resulting from the attorney's negligence." (Kumaraperu v. Feldsted)
  - "Whether an attorney owes a duty to a nonclient beneficiary is a question of law and a matter of policy that involves the balancing of six factors, which are known as the Biakanja/Lucas factors." (Chang v. Lederman)
  - "The Court disagrees for two reasons. First, the Biakanja/Lucas factors weigh against a determination of Plaintiff being a non-client potential beneficiary. Second, the Complaint itself states that it was the Trustee that informed Plaintiff that Plaintiff would not be engaged as the Trust's realtor to sell the properties, and the Complaint fails to show that this was caused by Defendant's actions."

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge rules that the defendant's demurrer to the plaintiff's complaint is sustained, with 20 days leave to amend. The plaintiff, Chelle Johnson, filed a complaint against the defendant, Klapach & Klapach, P.C., for legal malpractice. The defendant demurred to the complaint, arguing that the plaintiff was not a client of the defendant and therefore had no claim against them.

The judge agrees with the defendant, citing the Biakanja/Lucas factors, which weigh against the plaintiff's claim. The judge also finds that the complaint fails to show a proximate causal connection between the defendant's conduct and the plaintiff's alleged harm.

The judge grants leave to amend, acknowledging that there may be a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. The defendant's demurrer is sustained, and the plaintiff has 20 days to amend the complaint.
