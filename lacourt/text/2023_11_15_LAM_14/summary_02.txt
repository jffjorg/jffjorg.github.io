And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the Plaintiffs' motion for terminating, issue, and monetary sanctions against Defendant Ryan for failure to comply with discovery orders. The judge has also denied Defendant Ryan's request for monetary sanctions against the Plaintiffs for bringing the motion. The judge found that Defendant Ryan did not intentionally destroy or conceal any evidence, but rather made mistakes in his responses to the discovery requests. The judge noted that Plaintiffs' reaction to the sequence of events was understandable, but that it would be unjust to sanction them for bringing the motion.
