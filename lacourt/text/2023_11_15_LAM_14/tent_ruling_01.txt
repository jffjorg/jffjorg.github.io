  Case Number:  19STCV43419    Hearing Date:   November 15, 2023    Dept:  14 Instant Motion
 
Defendants District and Matthews now move this court for an
order continuing trial for four months.
 
Decision
 
            The motion
is DENIED.
 
Discussion
 
            California
Rules of Court Rule 3.1332(a) provides that trial dates are to be treated as
firm. However, Rule 3.1332(c) provides that, although continuances are “disfavored,”
requests should be considered on an individual basis. That subsection also
includes a non-exhaustive list of possible grounds for a continuance.
 
            The sole
ground for this motion is the parties’ desire to mediate the case. At the time
this motion was filed, trial was a mere 10 days away. However, subsequent to
the filing of this motion and for unrelated reasons, the trial was continued
for two months. Court staff have repeatedly inquired from both counsel as to
whether a mediation date has been scheduled. No definite answer has been given.
 
            This court
ordered the parties to participate in the court’s Resolve Law LA mediation
program on October 10, 2022. They have had a year to obtain a date and hold a
mediation session. This case is now four years old. It is time to try this case.
 
Conclusion
 
            Because the
parties have had years to arrange mediation and have received an additional two
months since the filing of this motion, the motion is DENIED.
