And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion to continue the trial for four months. The defendants, District and Matthews, had requested a continuance to allow for mediation, but the judge found that they had had ample time to arrange a mediation session, having been ordered to participate in the Resolve Law LA mediation program over a year ago. Despite receiving an additional two-month continuance since the filing of the motion, the judge determined that it was time to try the case, which is now four years old. The judge cited California Rules of Court Rule 3.1332(a) and (c) in support of their decision.
