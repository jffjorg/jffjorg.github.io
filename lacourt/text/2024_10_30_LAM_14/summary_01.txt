And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion filed by Plaintiff William Wade to engage in limited and expedited discovery against non-party Verizon Wireless. The plaintiff seeks to obtain information from Verizon to identify and locate the Doe Defendants, who are unnamed in the complaint. The judge finds that the plaintiff has demonstrated good cause for expedited discovery, as Verizon has information that is necessary to identify and locate the Doe Defendants. The judge orders that the plaintiff may serve or conduct discovery against Verizon to obtain the necessary information, but only to the extent necessary to identify and locate the Doe Defendants. The judge notes that Verizon may object to any subpoenas served after this motion is granted and may file a motion to quash the subpoena. The judge declines to grant any relief on the plaintiff's request to compel Verizon to comply with a previously served subpoena.
