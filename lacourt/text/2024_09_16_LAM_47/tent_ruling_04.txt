CASE:                         Amrit Sigh, et al. v. Kristina Jones, et
al.
 
CASE NO.:                 24STCV06818            
 
MOTION
TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL

 
MOVING PARTY:               Atorney Tom R. Normandin, Counsel for Plaintiffs Amrit
Singh and Isatnamwaheguru, LLC
 
RESPONDING PARTY(S): No response on
eCourt as of 09/11/24
 
STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is an action for fraud, breach of contract, and judicial foreclosure
that was filed on March 29, 2024. Plaintiffs allege that Defendants solicited investments
from Plaintiff in exchange as part of a fraud scheme. 
 
Attorney Tom R. Normandin, counsel
for Plaintiffs, moves to be relieved as counsel. 
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Attorney Tom R. Normandin, counsel
for Plaintiffs, moves to be relieved as counsel for both Plaintiffs. However,
rather than filing a motion to be relieved as counsel for the individual and
corporate Plaintiffs separately, Moving Counsel filed one motion, one
declaration, and one proposed order for both. Moving Counsel should have filed
one motion for each client. (See Cal. Rules of Court Rule 3.1362(a) [“notice of
motion and motion to be relieved as counsel under Code of Civil Procedure
section 284(2) must be directed to the client”].) 
 
Accordingly, Attorney Tom R.
Normandin’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel for Plaintiffs is DENIED. This
ruling is without prejudice to procedurally compliant motions to be relieved as
counsel for each client individually. 
 
This ruling is conditioned on Moving Counsel giving notice to
all parties who have appeared in this action and filing proof of service with
the Court. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.

            Any party may submit on the
tentative ruling by contacting the courtroom via email at Smcdept47@lacourt.org by no later than 4:00 p.m. the day
before the hearing. All interested parties must be copied on the email. It
should be noted that if you submit on a tentative ruling the court will still
conduct a hearing if any party appears. By submitting on the tentative you
have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you
should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an
order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
