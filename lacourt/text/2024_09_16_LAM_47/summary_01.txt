And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the Plaintiff's Motion to Compel Further Responses to Requests for Production and request for sanctions. The motion is DENIED because the Plaintiff has not demonstrated good cause for the discovery requests in the form in which they have been made. The judge finds that the proper method for seeking disclosure of transcripts of in-camera hearings on a Pitchess motion is not through ordinary requests for production, but through a Pitchess motion pursuant to Evidence Code section 1043. The judge also DENIES the Plaintiff's request for sanctions because the Plaintiff is not the prevailing party on this motion.
