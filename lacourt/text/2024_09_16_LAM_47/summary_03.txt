And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The City of Los Angeles moves for judgment on the pleadings, alleging that the plaintiff, Daimon McGuire, has failed to comply with the Government Tort Claims Act. The Judge grants the motion, finding that the plaintiff has not alleged compliance with the claim presentation requirement, nor a basis to be excused from that requirement.

The Judge notes that the parties have had a meet-and-confer process, and that the defendant has satisfied its statutory obligation to attempt to resolve the dispute with the plaintiff. However, the Judge finds that the plaintiff has not presented a timely Government Claim, and that the defendant is entitled to judgment on the pleadings.

The Judge grants the defendant's motion and orders the plaintiff to have 30 days to file a first amended complaint, alleging compliance with the claim presentation requirement or a basis to be excused from that requirement.

The Judge's ruling is based on the following legal standards: a motion for judgment on the pleadings is the functional equivalent of a general demurrer, and must be based on the legal sufficiency of the allegations, not their veracity. The Judge must accept the allegations of the complaint and answer as true, but will not do so for "conclusions of law or fact, opinions, speculation, or allegations contrary to law or [judicially noticed] facts..."
