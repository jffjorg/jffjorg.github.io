Legal Standard
 
A motion for judgment on the
pleadings is the functional equivalent of a general demurrer.  (Lance Camper Mfg. Corp. v. Republic
Indemnity Co. of Am. (1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 194, 198).  Like demurrers, motions for judgment on the
pleadings challenge the legal sufficiency of the allegations, not their
veracity.  (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins.
Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994). Any defects must either appear on the
face of the pleading, or else be taken by judicial notice.  (Bezirdjian v. O'Reilly (2010) 183
Cal.App.4th 316, 321-22).  The parties’
ability to prove their respective claims is of no concern.  (Cloud v. Northrop Grumman Corp.
(1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 995, 99.)  Though
the Court must accept the allegations of the complaint and answer as true (Gerawan
Farming, Inc. v. Lyons (2000) 24 Cal.4th 468, 515), it will not do so for
“conclusions of law or fact, opinions, speculation, or allegations contrary to
law or [judicially noticed] facts…” (Stevenson Real Estate Servs., Inc. v.
CB Richard Ellis Real Estate Servs., Inc. (2006) 138 Cal.App.4th 1215,
1219-20).
 
Meet and Confer
 
Before filing a motion for judgment
on the pleadings, the moving party shall meet and confer in person or by
telephone with the party who has filed the pleading subject to the motion for
judgment on the pleadings and file a declaration detailing their meet and
confer efforts.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 439(a).) However, an insufficient
meet-and-confer process is not grounds to grant or deny a motion for
judgment on the pleadings. (Code Civ. Proc., § 439(a)(4).)
 
The Declaration of Rebecca E.
Hunter in support of the Motion states that she wrote a meet-and-confer letter
to Plaintiff on February 5, 2024, and conferred with him telephonically on
February 12, 2024, but that the parties were not able to resolve this dispute.
(Declaration of Rebecca E. Hunter ISO Mot. ¶¶ 2-3; Exh. A.) Defendant has
therefore satisfied its statutory meet-and-confer obligation.
 
Analysis
 
            Defendant
moves for judgment on the pleadings on the basis that Plaintiff does not and
cannot allege compliance with the Government Tort Claims Act. 
 
The California Tort Claims Act
states that no person may sue a public entity or public employee for money or
damages unless a timely written claim has been presented to and denied by the
public entity. (Gov. Code § 945.4.) A claim must be presented to the public
entity within six months after the accrual of the cause of action. (Gov. Code.
§ 911.2.)
 
Although Defendant characterizes
the claim presentation requirement as a jurisdictional limitation, it is more
accurately construed as an element of a claim asserted against a public entity.
(See, e.g., City of San Jose v. Superior Court (1974) 12 Cal.3d 447, 454
[failure to present a claim “is fatal to the cause of action”].) In any event,
Defendant accurately states that Plaintiff has not alleged compliance with the
claim presentation requirement nor a basis to be excused from that requirement.
Defendant is therefore entitled to judgment on the pleadings.

Leave
to Amend
 
When a demurrer is sustained, the
Court determines whether there is a reasonable possibility that the defect can
be cured by amendment. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311,
318).  When a plaintiff “has pleaded the general set of facts upon
which his cause of action is based,” the court should give the plaintiff an
opportunity to amend his complaint, since plaintiff should not “be deprived of his
right to maintain his action on the ground that his pleadings were defective
for lack of particulars.” (Reed v. Norman (1957) 152 Cal.App.2d 892,
900.) Accordingly, California law imposes the burden on the plaintiffs to
demonstrate the manner in which they can amend their pleadings to state their
claims against a defendant.  (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18
Cal.3d 335, 349.) “Denial of leave to amend constitutes an abuse of discretion
unless the complaint shows on its face it is incapable of amendment. 
[Citation.]  Liberality in permitting amendment is the rule, if a fair
opportunity to correct any defect has not been given." (Angie M. v.
Superior Court (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1217, 1227.)
 
Defendant argues that amendment is
not possible because Plaintiff has not presented a timely Government Claim
relating to his alleged arrest. Although Defendant asserts that Plaintiff was
arrested on November 12, 2022, that information is not apparent from the face
of the Complaint. Defendant also contends, based on a Declaration of Michael
Valdivia, Deputy City Clerk for the City of Los Angeles, that Plaintiff did not
present a Government claim on or before November 15, 2023. Defendant did not
request judicial notice of this extrinsic document. Moreover, it would not be
proper to take judicial notice of that letter, as it does not fall within an
enumerated category under Evidence Code section 452, nor is it a statement of information
which is not reasonably subject to dispute and capable of immediate and
accurate determination by resort to sources of reasonably indisputable
accuracy. (See Evid. Code § 452.) As nothing on the face of the pleadings
demonstrates the impossibility of amendment, the Court is obligated to grant
leave to amend to provide Plaintiff a fair opportunity to correct the defects
in the Complaint, if possible.
 
CONCLUSION:

 
Accordingly, Defendant’s Motion for Judgment
on the Pleadings is GRANTED.
 
Plaintiff shall have 30 days leave
from the date of this order to file a First Amended Complaint, alleging compliance
with the claim presentation requirement or a basis to be excused from that
requirement.
 
Moving Party to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
