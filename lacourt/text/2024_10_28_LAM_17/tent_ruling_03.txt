 Hearing Date:  October 28, 2024



 
 
Defendants’ motion for attorney fees is DENIED.
 
            On 8/29/2019, Plaintiffs 8e6, George
Shih, Rodney Miller, Frank Wood, and Mahendra Vora (collectively, Plaintiffs)
filed suit against David Max (Max) and Ralph Rogari (Rogari) (collectively,
Defendants), alleging malicious prosecution. 
 
            On 10/18/2019, Defendants filed
special motions to strike. 
 
            On 12/31/2019, Plaintiffs
voluntarily dismissed their action without prejudice. As a result, the trial
court ruled that the anti-SLAPP motions were moot, and denied the request for
attorney fees without consideration.
 
            Defendants appealed the trial
court’s denial of attorney fees. The Court of Appeal reversed, writing “[f]ollowing
remand, the trial court is instructed to conduct further proceedings
adjudicating Max’s and Rogari’s entitlement to fees under section 425.16,
subdivision (c) and issue a new order ruling on the fee motion.”
 
            Defendants filed a preemptory challenge
pursuant to CCP section 170.6, and this case was reassigned to Department 17.
 
            Now, in keeping with the Court of
Appeal’s ruling, the Court takes up the question of Defendants’ attorney fees
pursuant to its motion refiled 9/3/2024, and originally filed 8/8/2022. 
 
Discussion

 
            In order to be entitled to attorney
fees, Defendants must establish that they would have prevailed on their
anti-SLAPP motion.
 
            As for their anti-SLAPP motion, “[t]o
survive anti-SLAPP scrutiny, a plaintiff need only establish their cause of
action has ‘minimal merit.’ ” (Cuevas-Martinez v. Sun Salt Sand, Inc.
(2019) 35 Cal.App.5th 1109, 1117.)
 
Here, Plaintiffs assert a single cause
of action for malicious prosecution. “ ‘To establish a cause of action for the
malicious prosecution of a civil proceeding, a plaintiff must plead and prove
that the prior action (1) was commenced by or at the direction of the defendant
and was pursued to a legal termination in his, plaintiff’s, favor [citations];
(2) was brought without probable cause [citations]; and (3) was initiated with
malice [citations].’ ” (Lanz v. Goldstone (2015) 243 Cal.App.4th 441,
458 (quoting Bertero v. National General Corp. (1974) 13 Cal.3d 43,
50).)  
 
            Defendants argue that Plaintiffs could
not have satisfied the second prong[1] of the anti-SLAPP analysis because: (1) none of the
Plaintiffs timely opposed Rogari’s motion; (2) Plaintiffs did not allege any
facts which could show that the prior claim—Max I—resolved in
Plaintiffs’ favor; (2) Plaintiffs did not allege any facts which could show
that Defendants did not have probable cause to bring the claim; (3) Plaintiffs’
claims were time-barred.
 
            After review, the Court disagrees
with Defendants. 
 
            As to the first contention, the
Court located two substantive oppositions filed in response to both Defendants’
anti-SLAPP motions. The opposition to Defendant Rogari’s motion was filed on
12/24/2019, and the opposition to Defendant Max’s motion was filed on 12/23/2019.

 
            As for the second contention, “[a] voluntary dismissal, even one without
prejudice, may be a favorable termination which will support an action for
malicious prosecution. [Citation.] ‘In most cases, a voluntary unilateral
dismissal is considered a termination in favor of the defendant in the
underlying action; the same is true of a dismissal for failure to prosecute.
[Citations.]’ [Citation.]” (Fuentes v. Berry (1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 1800,
1808.) Here, Plaintiffs alleged that “on June 27,
2019, the Court entered final judgment in favor of [Plaintiffs] “on all claims
asserted by [] David Max against them.” (Complaint ¶ 64.) Plaintiffs further
alleged:
 
Hence, the
UNDERLYING ACTION, having been commenced and prosecuted by MAX, through ROGARI
and/or DOES 1 through 25, inclusive, and each of them, was pursued to a legal
termination on the merits in total and complete favor of 8e6, SHIH, WOOD, VORA
and MILLER (along with the other NON-8e6 FORMER DEFENDANTS). The manner of
disposition of all three causes of action necessarily reflects the opinion of
the Court, MAX, ROGARI and/or DOES 1 through 25, inclusive, and each of them,
that the UNDERLYING ACTION lacked merit or otherwise would not succeed. (Ross
v. Kish (2006) 145 Cal.App.4th 188, 198.)
            
(Complaint
¶ 72.) 
 
As noted by Defendants, “where a proceeding is
terminated other than on the merits, the reasons underlying the termination
must be examined to see if it reflects the opinion of the court or the
prosecuting party that the action would not succeed.” (Fuentes, supra,
38
Cal.App.4th at p. 1808.) 
 
            Thus,
while Plaintiff is correct that a voluntary dismissal can support a malicious
prosecution case, the Court must still evaluate the specifics of the dismissal
to ensure the dismissal reflected “the opinion of the court or the prosecuting
party that the action would not succeed.” (Id.) Here, the Court
concludes there is at the very least a triable issue as to whether or not the
claim was dismissed for purely technical reasons, or for substantive reasons.
This is because there is nothing in the record that would clearly indicate that
the claim was terminated purely for technical reasons. 
 
            As for the third contention,
Plaintiffs’ Complaint alleges a lack of probable cause. (Complaint ¶ 73.) In
their opposition, Plaintiffs submitted declarations and excerpts of deposition
testimony to support their contention that Defendants lacked probable cause. (See
Opps. 6: 22-15:28.)  The Court finds
this evidence at least could indicate that Plaintiffs’ claim of lack of
probable cause has ‘minimal merit.’ (Cuevas-Martinez, supra,
35 Cal.App.5th at p. 1117.) 
 
            Finally, Defendants argue that
Plaintiffs’ claims would be time-barred because the statute of limitations for
a malicious prosecution action is two years. (CCP § 335.1.) Defendants voluntarily
dismissed the original action against Plaintiff 8e6 on 7/5/2017, yet Plaintiffs
did not file this action until 8/29/2019. However, in opposition, Plaintiff 8e6
contended that Max voluntarily dismissed 8e6 from the underlying action
twice—once on 7/5/2017, and then again on 3/16/2018. (RJN ¶¶ 1, 44, Exhs. 27
and 72 to the AOE.) Accepted as true, the second dismissal would be less than
two years from filing this lawsuit (RJN ¶40, Ex. 68 to the AOE), making it
timely. (CCP § 335.1.)
 
The
Court found the evidence and argument from both sides on this issue to be
confusing and difficult to follow. For example, Defendants do not appear to
dispute that there was a second dismissal (in fact, they do not discuss the 3/16/2018
second dismissal date in reply), but no explanation has been offered as to why
such a dismissal would (or could) have been necessary. While there seems to be
considerable disagreement between the parties as to the purpose and effect of
these two dismissals, the Court must conclude at least a triable issue exists
as to when the statute of limitations began to run for purposes of Plaintiffs’
claim here.   
            
            Taken together, the Court finds that
Plaintiffs’ claim had at least minimal merit. As such, Defendants have not
established an entitlement to attorney fees incurred in connection with their
anti-SLAPP motions. (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1131.)
 
            Based on the foregoing, Defendants’
motion for attorney fees is denied. 
 
It is so
ordered.
