And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to compel compliance with a court order. The plaintiff, ISSA AL-BAYATI, had failed to comply with the order by refusing to allow his expert witness, Dr. Eskenazi, to appear for a deposition. The defendant had incurred costs of $1,030.00 due to Dr. Eskenazi's non-appearance. The judge found that Dr. Eskenazi had been paid before the deposition, but still refused to appear. The judge ruled that the defendant was within its rights to take a notice of non-appearance and that the plaintiff was responsible for the costs incurred. The judge sanctioned the plaintiff, jointly and severally with counsel, in the amount of $1,030.00.
