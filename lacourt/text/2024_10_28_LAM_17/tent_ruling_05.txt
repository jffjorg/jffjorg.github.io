         vs.
 
CALIFORNIA
  AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE COMPANY aka 
MERCURY
  INSURANCE    

 


 Case No.: 
  23STCV02710
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  October 28, 2024




 
Defendant’s motion for terminating sanctions is GRANTED Plaintiff
is sanctioned, jointly and severally with counsel, $2,100, due within 30 days
of entry of this order. 
 
On 2/3/2023, Plaintiffs Gal Moshe Faigel (Faigel) and Ronit Malmud
(Malmud) (collectively, Plaintiffs) filed suit against California Automobile
Insurance Company aka Mercury Insurance (Defendant), alleging: (1) breach of
insurance contract; and (2) breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing. 
 
            Now, Defendant moves for terminating
sanctions. 
 
            The motion is unopposed. 
 
Discussion

 
            Defendant seeks terminating
sanctions, on the grounds that Plaintiff has not complied with the Court’s
5/22/2024 order compelling Plaintiff to provide discovery responses to
Defendant’s Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories and Demand for Production
of Documents. 
            
            “[T]here is no question of the power
of the court to apply the ultimate sanction of default against a litigant who
persists in an outright refusal to comply with his discovery obligations.” (Deyo
v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal. App. 3d 771, 787, superseded on other grounds, Guzman
v. General Motors Corp. (1984) 154 Cal. App. 3d 438, 445.)
 
            Here, Plaintiff has failed to comply
with his discovery obligations, failed to comply with a Court Order, and failed
to oppose a motion seeking termination of this action. Accordingly, Plaintiff’s
actions indicate that he is either unwilling or unable to litigate this
action.  The Court sanctions Plaintiff,
jointly and severally with counsel, $2,100, due within 30 days of entry of this
order ($350/hr x 6.) 
 
            Based on the foregoing, Defendant’s
motion for terminating sanctions is granted. Plaintiff is sanctioned, jointly
and severally with counsel, $2,100, due within 30 days of entry of this order. 
 
 
It is so
ordered.
