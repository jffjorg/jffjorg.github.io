And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendants' motion for attorney fees. The defendants had filed anti-SLAPP motions and special motions to strike, and the plaintiffs had voluntarily dismissed the lawsuit without prejudice. The defendants appealed the trial court's denial of attorney fees, and the Court of Appeal reversed, instructing the trial court to conduct further proceedings to adjudicate the defendants' entitlement to fees.

The judge has reviewed the evidence and arguments presented by both sides and has concluded that the plaintiffs' claim had at least minimal merit. The judge has denied the defendants' motion for attorney fees, finding that the defendants have not established an entitlement to fees incurred in connection with their anti-SLAPP motions.

The judge has also addressed several disputes and issues raised by the parties, including the timing of the statute of limitations and the effect of the voluntary dismissal of the lawsuit. The judge has concluded that there is at least a triable issue as to whether the claim was dismissed for purely technical reasons or for substantive reasons, and has also found that the evidence and arguments presented by the parties on this issue are confusing and difficult to follow.

The judge has ordered that the defendants' motion for attorney fees be denied, and has directed the parties to submit any further written submissions on this issue by a certain deadline.
