The Plaintiff's failure to comply with discovery obligations and a Court Order, as well as their failure to oppose a motion seeking termination of the action, indicate that they are either unwilling or unable to litigate the action. The Judge cites Deyo v. Kilbourne and Guzman v. General Motors Corp. to support the grant of terminating sanctions.
