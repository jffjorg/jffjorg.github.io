And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge granted the defendant's motion to compel the plaintiff's deposition. The plaintiff had failed to appear for deposition on multiple occasions, citing objections to the deposition dates. The defendant had requested alternative dates, but the plaintiff's counsel did not respond. The judge found that the plaintiff's objections were not valid and that the plaintiff had attempted to evade being deposed. The judge ordered the plaintiff to appear for deposition and to produce documents responsive to the requests.

The judge also granted the defendant's request for sanctions, imposing a sanction of $1,000 on the plaintiff and her counsel. The judge found that the plaintiff's counsel had not advised the plaintiff on the discovery process and had failed to meet the burden of showing that they did not counsel the discovery abuse. The judge denied the plaintiff's request for sanctions.

The judge's ruling was based on California Code of Civil Procedure sections 2025.010, 2025.210, 2025.450, and 2023.030, which govern deposition notices, objections, and sanctions. The judge's decision was intended to compel the plaintiff's deposition and to impose sanctions on the plaintiff and her counsel for their failure to comply with the discovery process.
