And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has denied the Motion for Leave to Seal, which sought to seal documents containing Azealia Banks' email address. The judge found that the email address could be redacted, rather than the entire document being sealed. The judge also granted the unopposed Motions to be Relieved as Counsel, which were filed by Paymon John Vafa, counsel for the defendants. The motions were granted because there was no showing of resulting prejudice, and the attorney-client relationship was not compromised.
