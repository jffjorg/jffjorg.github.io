The attorneys have shown sufficient reasons for withdrawal, including a complete breakdown in the relationship with the client. The judge finds that the breakdown in the relationship is a valid reason for the attorneys to bring a motion under California Code of Civil Procedure § 284(2) instead of filing a consent under section 284(1). The motions are granted, and the attorneys are relieved as counsel of record for the client effective upon the filing of the proof of service of the signed orders upon the client.
