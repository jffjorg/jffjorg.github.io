And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to dismiss the case and granted the plaintiff's motion for leave to file a first amended complaint. The plaintiff's original complaint was filed on March 7, 2023, and alleges general negligence and premises liability. The defendant filed a motion to strike portions of the complaint, which was granted on July 17, 2023, with 20 days' leave to amend. However, the plaintiff did not file an amended complaint within the time allotted and instead attempted to obtain a stipulation from the defendant's counsel and then filed a motion for leave to amend on August 2, 2023. The judge found that the delay in filing the amended complaint was due to mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect and that the proposed amended complaint was served within the time allotted. Therefore, the judge denied the motion to dismiss and granted the motion for leave to amend. The plaintiff is ordered to file and serve a copy of the proposed first amended complaint within 3 days of the ruling.
