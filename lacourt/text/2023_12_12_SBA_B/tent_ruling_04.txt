YC072813
1.      Carlos Esqueda, et al.’s
Motion for Post Judgment Attorneys’ Fees and Costs   
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
Carlos Esqueda, et al.’s Motion
for Post Judgment Attorneys’ Fees and Costs is granted. 
 
Background
 
Plaintiffs filed this action
on April 16, 2018. This is an action related to alleged construction defects
from services provided by Defendants to Plaintiffs on a home improvement
project. The matter proceeded to arbitration and Plaintiffs prevailed at
arbitration. The arbitration award was confirmed, and judgment was entered on
December 10, 2020. On May 18, 2023, the Court granted Plaintiffs’ motion to amend the
judgment to add alter ego judgment debtors. The Court ordered that attorneys’
fees and costs may be recoverable pursuant to a separate motion. 
 
Motion for Post Judgment Attorneys’ Fees and Costs
 
Code Civ. Proc., § 685.040
states:
“The judgment creditor is
entitled to the reasonable and necessary costs of enforcing a judgment.
Attorney's fees incurred in enforcing a judgment are not included in costs
collectible under this title unless otherwise provided by law. Attorney's fees
incurred in enforcing a judgment are included as costs collectible under this
title if the underlying judgment includes an award of attorney's fees to the
judgment creditor pursuant to subparagraph (A) of paragraph (10) of subdivision
(a) of Section 1033.5.”
 
Code Civ. Proc., § 685.080
states:
“(a) The judgment creditor
may claim costs authorized by Section 685.040 by noticed motion. The motion
shall be made before the judgment is satisfied in full, but not later than two
years after the costs have been incurred. The costs claimed under this section
may include, but are not limited to, costs that may be claimed under Section
685.070 and costs incurred but not approved by the court or referee in a
proceeding under Chapter 6 (commencing with Section 708.010) of Division 2.
(b) The notice of motion
shall describe the costs claimed, shall state their amount, and shall be
supported by an affidavit of a person who has knowledge of the facts stating
that to the person's best knowledge and belief the costs are correct, are reasonable
and necessary, and have not been satisfied. The notice of motion shall be
served on the judgment debtor. Service shall be made personally or by mail.
(c) The court shall make an
order allowing or disallowing the costs to the extent justified under the
circumstances of the case.”
 
Thus, pursuant to CCP §
685.040, a judgment creditor may recover reasonable costs incurred in enforcing
the judgment.  CCP § 685.040 states, in
relevant part: “Attorney’s fees incurred in enforcing a judgment are included
as costs collectible under this title if the underlying judgment includes an
award of attorney’s fees to the judgment creditor pursuant to subparagraph (A)
of paragraph (10) of subdivision (a) of Section 1033.5.” The underlying
judgment did include attorneys’ fees and costs. Therefore, judgment creditors
may properly seek an award of post-judgment attorneys’ fees.
 
“The trial court has “broad
authority” to determine the amount of a reasonable attorneys’ fees.  PLCM
Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095.  “[T]he fee setting inquiry in California
ordinarily begins with the ‘lodestar,’ i.e., the number of hours reasonably
expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate.”  Id.
[“California courts have consistently held that a computation of time spent on
a case and the reasonable value of that time is fundamental to a determination
of an appropriate attorneys' fee award.”]. 
“The experienced trial judge is the best judge of the value of
professional services rendered in his court, and while his judgment is of
course subject to review, it will not be disturbed unless the appellate court
is convinced that it is clearly wrong.”  Ketchum
v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1132 (internal quotation omitted.)  
 
“The judgment creditor is
entitled to the reasonable and necessary costs of enforcing a judgment.”  Code Civ. Proc., § 685.040.  Specified costs incurred to enforce a
judgment may be recovered by filing a memorandum of costs.  Code Civ. Proc. § 685.070(a).  However, if the judgment creditor seeks to
recover costs other than those itemized in Section 685.070, creditor must do so
by a noticed motion.  Code Civ. Proc. §
685.080(a).
 
Plaintiffs move, pursuant to
Code Civ. Proc. §§ 685.040 and 1033.5(a)(10), for reasonable attorneys’ fees
and costs incurred in enforcing the judgment.  Plaintiffs request an award of reasonable
post-judgment attorneys’ fees in the amount of $76,680.67 and costs in the
amount of $25,645.76, for a total of $102,326.43.
 
Thus, Plaintiff is entitled
to attorneys’ fees under the lodestar method based on the reasonable amount of
time the attorney spent multiplied by a reasonable rate.  The Court finds that the time spent in
post-judgment collection efforts was reasonable.  Post-judgment collection efforts involved the
time spent on preparation and completion of judgment debtor examinations
including efforts to obtain financial statements and information regarding other
litigation activity in which the parties were involved.  Post-judgment legal work also involved dealing
with numerous unresolved issues concerning arbitration fees and the California
Contractors State Licensing Board. Counsel also prepared the post-judgment
motion to amend judgment. The number of hours worked, which was approximately
256 hours, was reasonable.
 
The Court finds that the
hourly rates charged ranging from $245 to $545 for attorneys and $132 to $165
for paralegals were reasonable based on the nature of the litigation, the
experience of the attorneys and other staff, and the efforts expended by the
firm. 
 
Thus, the Court awards
post-judgment attorneys’ fees in the amount of $76,680.67 in favor of
Plaintiffs/Judgment Creditors and against Defendants/Judgment Debtors.  
 
As to the motion for costs,
the motion is granted.  Here, the
additional costs incurred were reasonable and necessary.  The costs include costs associated with
service of process attempts, judgment debtor examinations and transcripts, and
filing fees.  In addition, the costs
requested include $13,114.98 in arbitration fees that were unpaid by Defendant
CBI. Therefore, the Court awards post-judgment costs in the amount of $25,645.76.
 
Thus, the Court awards
post-judgment attorneys’ fees and costs in the amount of $102,326.43 in favor
of Plaintiffs/Judgment Creditors and against Defendants/Judgment Debtors.  
 
Plaintiffs are ordered to
give notice of this ruling.
