 Case Number:  24PSCV02095    Hearing Date:   September 30, 2024    Dept:  O Tentative Ruling
 
DEFENDANTS’
DEMURRER TO THE COMPLAINT is OVERRULED; this is a UD 
    COA pertaining
to commercial property, not breach of contract. 
 
 Background
 
This is an unlawful detainer action. 
 
On June 28, 2024, Plaintiff 1301 EAST GLADSTONE STREET
INVESTORS, LLC filed suit against Defendant Pink Sponge for unpaid rent of
$34,443 (minus other costs).
 
On July 15, 2024, Defendant filed the instant demurrer. 
 
On September 16, 2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition. 
 
To date, as of Wed., 9/25, no reply has been filed (due 9
court days before hearing [Fri. 9/20]. 
 
Discussion
 
Defendant demurs to the complaint because “Plaintiff neither
attaches a copy of the lease agreement with defendant to the Complaint nor
alleges all material terms of the lease agreement.” (Demurrer p. 3:22-24.)
 
However, as noted in opposition, this is not a breach
of contract COA. As for the requirement that the complaint provide the written
lease, that applies to residential property. (See Code of Civ. Proc., §1166(c)(d)(1)(B).)
Otherwise, the complaint need only (1) be verified, (2) “set forth the facts on
which the plaintiff seeks to recover,” (3) describe the premises, (4) state the
amount of rent in default, and (5) specifically state the method used to serve
defendant with the required notice. (Demurrer p. 2, citing § 1166, subd. (a).)  
 
Here, the lease involves commercial property. Accordingly,
the complaint adequately states a (statutory COA) for unlawful detainer as it
complies with section 1166. Defendant has not filed a reply to address the
foregoing. 
 
Merits aside, the court notes that the parties did not
adequately meet and confer. Defense Counsel sent Plaintiff’s Counsel a letter
on July 11, 2024 laying out the arguments set forth in the demurrer; that is
four days before the demurrer was filed, which does not provide opposing
counsel with sufficient time to respond. For any future motions, the parties
are to meaningfully meet and confer and provide a detailed declaration as to
what was discussed and why the issue(s) could not be resolved. 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, the demurrer is overruled.
