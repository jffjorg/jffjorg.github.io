And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on the demurrer filed by the defendant, Pink Sponge, to the complaint filed by the plaintiff, 1301 EAST GLADSTONE STREET INVESTORS, LLC. The defendant argued that the complaint did not adequately state a claim for breach of contract and that the lease agreement was not attached to the complaint. However, the judge has ruled that this is an unlawful detainer action, which is governed by a different set of rules than a breach of contract action. Specifically, the judge noted that under Code of Civil Procedure §1166, a complaint in an unlawful detainer action need only set forth the facts on which the plaintiff seeks to recover, describe the premises, state the amount of rent in default, and specifically state the method used to serve the defendant with the required notice. Since the complaint in this case complies with these requirements, the judge has overruled the demurrer. Additionally, the judge noted that the parties did not adequately meet and confer before filing their motions, and has encouraged them to do so in the future.
