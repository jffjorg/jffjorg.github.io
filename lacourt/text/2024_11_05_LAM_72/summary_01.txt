And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Ibiere N. Seck and Seck Law, P.C. v. Brian T. Dunn, A Professional Law Corporation. The case involves a dispute over a fee sharing agreement between the parties. The Court has ruled that the demurrer filed by the defendant to the second and third claims in the Second Amended Cross-Complaint (SACC) is overruled.

The Court found that the SACC alleges sufficient facts to support claims of intentional and negligent interference with prospective economic advantage. The Court concluded that the alleged misrepresentations by Seck and the association of Taylor & King on the Doe Matter could reasonably give rise to an inference that the Cochran Firm was deceived into entering a settlement agreement that gave it only a 7% share of the fee.

The Court also found that the SACC alleges sufficient facts to support a claim of negligent interference with prospective economic advantage. The Court concluded that the defendant's failure to act with reasonable care could have disrupted the relationship between the Cochran Firm and the Doe plaintiff, resulting in economic harm to the Cochran Firm.

The Court's tentative ruling is subject to change and will be discussed further at the hearing on November 5, 2024.
