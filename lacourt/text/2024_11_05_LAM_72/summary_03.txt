```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the demurrer filed by Plaintiff Jeffrey Aaron Cohen is sustained, meaning that the cross-complaint filed by Defendant Mordchai Brafman is dismissed. The judge has found that Brafman's claims are barred by the doctrine of res judicata, which means that a former judgment has conclusive effect in subsequent litigation involving the same controversy. The judge has also found that the claims against Cohen in the underlying lawsuit were litigated to a final judgment, and the Court's ruling in the anti-SLAPP motion that Cohen's conduct was protected by the litigation privilege is therefore binding. As a result, Brafman's claims are barred and the demurrer is sustained without leave to amend.
