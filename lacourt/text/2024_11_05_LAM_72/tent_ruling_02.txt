Plaintiff Rashanee Y. Guest (“Guest”) petitions the Court
for approval of the compromise of the claims of Plaintiff Ra’nala Skye
Williams, a minor, by and through her Guardian Ad Litem Rashanee Y. Guest
(“Williams”).
 
The Court GRANTS the petition.
 
Background
 
This is a landlord-tenant action. The following facts are
taken from the allegations of the Complaint.
 
Plaintiffs Guest, Williams, and Renee Turner (“Turner”) were
tenants at 23930 Ocean Ave., Apt. 104, Torrance, California 90505 (the
“Property”). Plaintiffs allege that Defendants 23930 Copa Pacific Apts LLC
(“Copa”) and Defendant GGE Management LLC (“GGE”) (collectively, “Defendants”)
owned and managed the Property.
 
Plaintiffs allege a number of defects in the Property,
including rat infestations, water leaks, mold, and inoperable stoves, ovens,
and smoke alarms.
 
Plaintiffs filed this action on January 2, 2024, raising
claims for (1) breach of implied warranty of habitability; (2) negligence; and
(3) nuisance.
 
Guest filed this petition on September 30, 2024. No party
has filed an opposition.
 
Legal Standard
 
Pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure section 372,
any settlement of a claim made by a minor or adult with a disability must be
approved by the court. If the court is satisfied that the settlement is in
the best interest of the claimant, then the court shall approve the
settlement. (See Pearson v. Superior Court (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th
1333, 1338.)   
 
A petition for court approval of a compromise or covenant
not to sue under Code of Civil Procedure section 372 must comply with
California Rules of Court, Rules 7.950, 7.951, and 7.952. The petition must be
verified by the petitioner and contain a full disclosure of all information
that has “any bearing upon the reasonableness” of the compromise or the
covenant. (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 7.950.)  The person compromising
the claim on behalf of the minor or person who lacks capacity, and the
represented person, must attend the hearing on compromise of the claim unless
the court for good cause dispenses with their personal appearance. (Cal. Rules
of Court, Rule 7.952.)   
 
Discussion
 
Guest has properly verified the petition.
 
The total amount of Williams’ settlement is $5,000.00. $1,250.00,
or 25 percent of the settlement, will be deducted for attorney’s fees. $351.21
will be deducted for medical and other expenses. The remaining balance will be
$3,388.79. (See Petition at pp. 4-6.)
 
The total amount offered to other plaintiffs by Defendants
is $60,000.00. $25,000.00 is offered to Turner and $30,000.00 is offered to
Guest.
 
Plaintiff’s primary injury in this case was exposure to
mold, resulting in cold-like symptoms. (Ohn Decl. ¶ 5.)
 
Counsel for Plaintiffs indicates that the adult plaintiffs
are receiving a higher settlement because the settlement accounts for the rent
that they paid for the Property and because the adult plaintiffs experienced a
greater degree of emotional distress.
 
The Court finds that the settlement is in Williams’ best
interests and approves the settlement.
