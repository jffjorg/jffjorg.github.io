CROSS-DEFENDANT

ADJUDICATION OF ISSUES



 
 
I.          INTRODUCTION


            This case concerns ownership of,
title to, and loans against 8940 Kramerwood Place, Los Angeles, California
90034 (the Property).  For the purposes
of these proceedings, the Property was originally owned by William Anthony
Vaughn and Luerendia Vaughn (collectively, the Vaughns).  The
Vaughns transferred title to the Property to the Vaughn Family Trust in
1998.  In 2011, defendant and
cross-complainant Sannette Gite (Gite or Cross-Complainant) was named as
Trustee of the Vaughn Family Trust. 
Since then, the Property has been the subject of numerous conveyances
and quiet title actions.  Here, plaintiffs
and cross-defendants U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee for Velocity
Commercial Capital Loan Trust 2019-3 (US Bank), and Mara Enterprises (Mara) each
allege an ownership interest in the Property. 
To that end, US Bank and Mara filed separate actions against Gite, in
her capacity as Trustee of the Vaughn Family Trust, and others, to quiet title
to the Property.

            Procedural
Background
 
            On December
6, 2021, US Bank initiated its action for quiet title and declaratory relief (the
US Bank Action) against Gite, and others, in Case No. 21STCV44465.  
 
            On January
14, 2022, Mara initiated its action for quiet title and declaratory relief (the
Mara Action) against Gite, and others, in Case No. 22STCV01686.  
 
            On January
13, 2023, in the US Bank Action, Gite filed the operative First Amended
Cross-Complaint (FAXC) against US Bank, Mara, and Velocity, among others.  On the same day, in the Mara action, Gite
filed the operative Second Amended Cross-Complaint (SAXC) against US Bank,
Mara, and Velocity, among others.  The
allegations against US Bank and Mara in Gite’s operative cross-complaints are
identical.  
 
            As relevant
here, Gite’s cross-complaint alleges the following causes of action against US
Bank and Mara: (1) quiet title, (2) declaratory relief, and (3) slander of
title.[6]
 
            On February
8, 2024, Case Nos. 21STCV44465 and 22STCV01686 were consolidated in this
department.  Case No. 21STCV44465 is the
lead case.
 
On June 28, 2024, US Bank filed a motion for summary
judgment, or in the alternative, summary adjudication of issues on Gite’s
FAXC.  
 
On July 8, 2024, Mara filed a motion for summary judgment,
or in the alternative, summary adjudication of issues on Gite’s SAXC.  
 
On October 18, 2024, Gite filed oppositions.
 
On October 25, 2024, US Bank and Mara replied.
 
Because US Bank’s and Mara’s motions are substantively
identical, as are Gite’s oppositions to the pending motions, the court
addresses US Bank’s and Mara’s motions together.
 
II.        LEGAL
STANDARD
 
When reviewing a motion for summary judgment or summary
adjudication, courts must apply a three-step analysis: “(1) identify the issues
framed by the pleadings; (2) determine whether the moving party has negated the
opponent’s claims; and (3) determine whether the opposition has demonstrated
the existence of a triable, material factual issue.”¿ (Hinesley v. Oakshade
Town Center (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 289, 294.)¿¿A motion for summary judgment must be granted “if all the papers submitted
show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving
party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c,
subd. (c).)   
 
“[T]he initial burden is always on the moving party to make
a prima facia showing that there are no triable issues of material fact.”¿ (Scalf
v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1519.)¿ A defendant seeking summary judgment “bears the burden of
persuasion that there is no triable issue of material fact and that he is
entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”  (Aguilar v. Atlantic
Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 850 (Aguilar).) 
A defendant moving for summary judgment or summary adjudication “has met
his or her burden of showing that a cause of action has no merit if the party
has shown that one or more elements of the cause of action . . . cannot be
established, or that there is a complete defense to the cause of action.”¿
(Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2).)¿ A moving defendant need not
conclusively negate an element of plaintiff’s cause of action.¿ (Aguilar,
supra, 25 Cal.4th at p. 854.)¿¿ 
 
To meet this burden of showing a cause of action cannot be
established, a defendant must show not only “that the plaintiff does not
possess needed evidence” but also that “the plaintiff cannot reasonably
obtain needed evidence.”¿ (Aguilar, supra, 25 Cal.4th at p.
854.)¿ It is insufficient for the defendant to merely point out the absence of
evidence.¿ (Gaggero v. Yura (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 884, 891.)¿ The
defendant “must also produce evidence that the plaintiff cannot reasonably
obtain evidence to support his or her claim.”¿ (Ibid.)¿ The supporting
evidence can be in the form of affidavits, declarations, admissions,
depositions, answers to interrogatories, and matters of which judicial notice
may be taken.¿ (Aguilar, supra, 25 Cal.4th at p. 855.)¿¿ 
 
“Once the defendant … has met that burden, the burden
shifts to the plaintiff … to show that a triable issue of one or more material
facts exists as to the cause of action or a defense thereto.” (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 437c, subd. (p)(2).)¿The plaintiff may not merely rely on allegations or
denials of its pleadings to show that a triable issue of material fact exists,
but instead, “shall set forth the specific facts showing that a triable issue
of material fact exists as to the cause of action.”¿(Ibid.)¿ A plaintiff
opposing summary judgment defeats the motion by showing one or more triable
issues of material fact exist as to the challenged element. (Aguilar, supra,
25 Cal.4th at p. 849.)  “If the plaintiff cannot do so, summary judgment
should be granted.” (Avivi v. Centro Medico Urgente Medical Center
(2008) 159 Cal.App.4th 463, 467.)¿¿ 
 
The court must “liberally construe the evidence in support
of the party opposing summary judgment and resolve all doubts concerning the
evidence in favor of that party,” including “all inferences reasonably drawn
therefrom.” (Yanowitz v. L’Oreal USA, Inc. (2005) 36 Cal.4th 1028, 1037;
Aguilar, supra, 25 Cal.4th at pp. 844-45.)¿ “On a summary
judgment motion, the court must therefore consider what inferences favoring the
opposing party a factfinder could reasonably draw from the evidence.¿ While
viewing the evidence in this manner, the court must bear in mind that its
primary function is to identify issues rather than to determine issues.¿
[Citation.] Only when the inferences are indisputable may the court decide the
issues as a matter of law.¿ If the evidence is in conflict, the factual issues
must be resolved by trial.” (Binder v. Aetna Life Ins. Co. (1999) 75
Cal.App.4th 832, 839.)¿ “Put another way, have defendants conclusively negated
a necessary element of the [plaintiff’s] case or demonstrated that under no
hypothesis is there a material issue of fact that requires the process of
trial?”¿ (Jeld-Wen, Inc. v. Superior Court (2005) 131 Cal.App.4th 853,
860, internal citation omitted.)¿Further, “the trial court may not weigh the
evidence in the manner of a factfinder to determine whose version is more
likely true.¿ [Citation.]¿ Nor may the trial court grant summary judgment based
on the court’s evaluation of credibility.¿ [Citation.]” ¿(Id. at p. 840;
see also Weiss v. People ex rel. Department of Transportation (2020) 9
Cal.5th 840, 864 [“Courts deciding motions for summary judgment or summary
adjudication may not weigh the evidence but must instead view it in the light
most favorable to the opposing party and draw all reasonable inferences in
favor of that party”].)¿¿

V.        DISCUSSION
            
US Bank and Mara (hereafter, Cross-Defendants) move for
summary judgment, or summary adjudication, on Gite’s crossclaims for quiet
title, declaratory relief, and slander of title.  Cross-Defendants do so on the following
grounds: (1) Gite lacks standing to bring any crossclaims against Cross-Defendants,
and (2) the slander of title claim separately fails because the recording of
the deeds granting US Bank and Mara their respective interests in the Property
are privileged and Gite cannot demonstrate that the Cross-Defendants acted with
malice.[8]  For the reasons stated herein, Cross-Defendants
are not entitled to summary judgment or summary adjudication.
 
1.  Gite
does not lack standing.
 
Cross-Defendants argue Gite lacks standing to prosecute her
crossclaims.  In support, Cross-Defendants
point to the language of the Vaughn Family Trust which expressly provides that
upon the death of Luerendia Vaughn the trustee (Gite) is to distribute the entire
trust estate, including any assets subsequently added to the trust estate to
Mark Lawson (Lawson).[9]
 (See Vaughn Family Trust, Art. 2.2.)  Relying on this language, Cross-Defendants argue
Gite lacks standing because any purported right to the Property is held by
Lawson.  Cross-Defendants further point
out that Lawson has not challenged Cross-Defendants’ interests in the Property.

 
The argument lacks merit. 
The trust language merely directs Gite, in her capacity as trustee, to
distribute the trust assets to Lawson.  Cross-Defendants
do not provide any evidence showing Gite transferred the Property to
Lawson.  Gite admits as much in her
opposition.  In an apparent concession, Cross-Defendants
argue in reply that it is unreasonable for Gite to have failed to transfer the
Property to Lawson since Luerendia Vaughn passed away twelve (now thirteen)
years ago.  However, Gite’s inaction as
trustee is not an issue relevant to this action, let alone, to these
motions.  Essentially, Cross-Defendants
ask this court to imply that the Property is no longer an asset of the Vaughn
Family Trust.  In the absence of any
supporting evidence, the court declines to do so.  The Property is an asset of the Trust.  Therefore, Gite, as trustee, has standing to
bring these claims.  “In general, the
person who has the right to file suit under the substantive law is the real
party in interest. [Citation.] At common law, where a cause of action is
prosecuted on behalf of an express trust, the trustee is the real party in
interest because the trustee has legal title to the cause.”  (Saks v. Damon Raike & Co. (1992) 7
Cal.App.4th 419, 427.)  Further, Gite has
standing to press her claims because the terms of the Family Vaughn Trust entrust
Gite with discretion to sell the Property.[10]
 Quieting title directly serves that end.
 
Cross-Defendants fail to meet their initial burden.  Summary judgment is not warranted for
purported lack of standing.
 
2.  There are triable issues regarding the
slander of title claim.
 
Cross-Defendants argue their publications were privileged
because they are rival claimants to the Property and are entitled to protect
their interests.  Further, because the
publications are privileged, Cross-Defendants argue Gite must establish malice to
prevail on her claim for slander of title, which, according to Cross-Defendants,
she cannot do.  
 
Gite disagrees and points to triable issues; namely, that the
deeds and assignments granting Cross-Defendants their purported interests in
the Property were void ab initio and Cross-Defendants were on notice of the
defects in the title before they made their loans. 
 
The elements of a cause of action for slander of title are:
“(1) a publication, (2) which is without privilege or justification, (3) which
is false, and (4) which causes direct and immediate pecuniary loss.” (Alpha
and Omega Development, LP v. Whillock Contracting, Inc. (2011) 200
Cal.App.4th 656, 664; see also CACI No. 1730.)  
 
“Civil Code section 47 extends a conditional privilege
against defamation to statements made without malice on subjects of mutual
interests.” (Hui v. Sturbaum (2014)
222 Cal.App.4th 1109, 1118; see also CAC No. 1723.)  “For the purposes of section 47’s qualified
privilege, ‘malice’ means that the defendant (1) ‘ “was motivated by hatred or
ill will towards the plaintiff,” ’ or (2) ‘ “lacked reasonable grounds for
[its] belief in the truth of the publication and therefore acted in reckless
disregard of the plaintiff’s rights.” ’ ” (Schep v. Capital One, N.A.
(2017) 12 Cal.App.5th 1331, 1337.)  Under
the common-interest privilege of Civil Code section 47(c), the defendant bears
the initial burden of showing facts to bring the communication within the privilege.
 The plaintiff (or cross-complainant)
then must prove that the statement was made with malice.  (Lundquist v. Reusser (1994) 7 Cal.4th
1193, 1203.)
 
Here, Cross-Defendants meet their burden to show the publications
fall within the privilege.  US Bank is a
rival claimant of the Property by and through the July 18, 2019 Velocity Deed
of Trust and the Assignment of Deed of Trust. 
(US Bank’s Undisputed Material Facts Nos. 11, 12, 36, 37, 57, 58, 78, 79.)  Mara is a rival claimant of the Property by
and through the December 30, 2019 Deed of Trust.  (Mara’s Undisputed Material Facts Nos. 11, 12,
36, 37, 57, 58, 78, 79). 
 
The burden shifts.  Gite argues the deeds of trust are void ab
initio because the deed from which they were derived was forged.  “A forged document is void ab initio
and constitutes a nullity; as such it cannot provide the basis for a superior
title as against the original grantor.”
(WFG Nat'l Title Ins. Co. v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. as Tr. for Park Place
Sec., Inc. Asset-Backed Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2005-WCW2 (2020) 51
Cal.App.5th 881, 891, citing Wutzke v. Bill Reid Painting Service (1984)
151 Cal.App.3d 36, 43.)
 
The heart of Gite’s argument is that Cross-Defendants were
on notice of Gite’s claims to title.  In
support, Gite offers the opinion of experts Robert Brown (Brown) and Don Ector
(Ector) to establish Cross-Defendants’ reckless disregard of Gite’s title
claims.  Brown states, 
 
“It
is my informed opinion that in entering their transactions, facts and
circumstances were made known or constructively known to the Defendants
Velocity, US Bank and Mara Enterprises which constituted bright “red flags”
putting the lenders and assignee on notice that the potential for fraud and illegal
activity were highly in evidence.” 
(Brown Decl., ¶ 4.)
 
“The
Site X report, which was possessed by Velocity and US Bank before their
respective transactions, contains a litany of unusual “back and forth”
transfers of the property between various individuals and entities, which
should have raised serious concerns to a reasonable lender regarding the validity
of the borrower/grantor’s legal title to the property. It is curious that the
preliminary title reports only references conveyances for the prior 24 months
from the lending date of July 2019. This seems highly unusual, and it does not
appear that the lender discussed or shared the Site X report with the title company.
Nonetheless, lenders and assignees have constructive notice of pertinent
matters in the public record.”  (Brown
Decl., ¶ 5.)
 
Regarding
Velocity, there are many atypical and uncharacteristic elements in the file which
place the bona fides of the lender and the legitimacy of the overall loan in
dire question, i.e., the prior loan that was paid off with the proceeds of the
subject loan had matured and was past due for over seven months. It had only
been on the property for a little less than two years. It is very questionable why
the defendant would make a loan allowing the borrower to “cash out” an
additional $100,000, especially based on what purported to be a “month to
month’ rental agreement on the subject property. In my view, the underwriting
analysis and rationale for the loan are dubious.  (Brown Decl., ¶ 6.)
 
I
am also of the opinion that turning a blind eye to all the red flags, not
investigating the title, recording the deed of trust and making no inquiry
about the Sannette Gite; The Vaughn Family Trust interest in the property was
reckless. I doubt that any conventional lenders would have engaged in this
transaction with this borrower and property. One could only infer that Velocity
just didn’t want to know, which is why they sought no explanation to explain
the litany of unusual “back and forth” transfers of the property which
conflicted with the borrowers claim of ownership.  (Brown Decl., ¶ 7.)
 
Given
that there was a recorded Judgement for possession, litigation occurring and ongoing
just preceding the making of the loan, the lender by exercising due diligence
could have easily examined the court records which would have disclosed the
litigation between the borrower and Sannette Gite, trustee of the Vaughn Family
Trust, and contacted her or her counsel to discuss her interest in the property.
Conducting this brief inquiry would have taken minimal effort by the lender and
firmly informed them of the circumstances regarding title to the property that
they were relying on and encumbering to make an approximately
one-million-dollar loan transaction. This is especially important given that
the Borrower did not exhibit the individual income to support repayment of the
Loan and the alleged rental income from the property was very speculative. This
was a very dubious underwriting position, at best, in my opinion, based upon my
experience as a former lender’s counsel and as a current bank director.  (Brown Decl., ¶ 8.)
 
In short, Brown opines that a reasonable lender would have investigated
the information contained in the Site X report or made an inquiry to determine
the nature and extent of the Vaughn Family Trust’s interest in the Property;
not to do so was reckless.  Indeed, a
cursory review of the History of Title Transfers listed above amply supports Brown’s
“red flag” assessment.  (See Brown Decl.,
¶ 5.)  
 
            Ector
provides a similar opinion.  In his
declaration, Ector states:
 
In
this case, I reviewed pertinent aspects of the file including deposition
testimony from the parties, reviewed the public record regarding the property,
the preliminary title report issued by Chicago Title Company and the Site X
report obtained by Velocity Commercial Capital. A preliminary title report customarily
reports all transfers, liens, judgements or burdens in the public record on or
related to the property from inception. Here, the report only indicates that
there have been no transfers of title for two years from the date of the
report.  For reasons that are unknown to
me, it does not disclose the entire history of transactions regarding the
property.  However, The (sic) Site X
report shows transfers on the property commencing in 1998.  (Ector Decl., ¶ 4.)
 
The
Site X report shows that Lion’s Proof (sic) transferred the property to both
M&R Bookkeeping Tax Services LLC and to Sannette Gite: Vaughn Family Trust
in 2011. Subsequently, there are numerous independent, uninsured transfers of
the property by Sannette Gite: Vaughn Family Trust and transfers of the
property by Yong Chung.  These transfers
raise red flags for any reasonable lender, broker or title officer because they
conflict with exclusive title ownership of the property.  In my opinion, Velocity, US Bank and Mara
enterprises (entities) should have investigated or at a minimum inquired about
the interest of Sannette Gite: Vaughn Family Trust before proceeding with a
loan to Yong Chung and recording a deed of trust or the assignment obtained
from him on the property.  Failing to
investigate to make an inquiring after obtaining knowledge of these conflicting
transfers of the property or failing to review the public record was reckless
in my opinion.  (Ector Decl., ¶ 5.)
 
In sum, Gite submits evidence of Mara and Velocity’s
reckless disregard of Gite’s title claims. 
And because US Bank stands in the shoes of Velocity as Velocity’s
assignee, the court’s conclusion regarding Velocity likewise extends to US Bank.
 Gite’s arguments raise triable issues of
material fact sufficient to defeat Cross-Defendants’ motions.  
 
VI.       CONCLUSION
 
            The motions for summary judgment, or in the alternative,
summary adjudication, filed by U.S. Bank National Association and Mara
Enterprises are DENIED.

I.          INTRODUCTION


            This case concerns ownership of, title to, and loans against
8940 Kramerwood Place, Los Angeles, California 90034 (the Property).  For the purposes of these proceedings, the
Property was originally owned by William Anthony Vaughn and Luerendia Vaughn
(collectively, the Vaughns).  The Vaughns
transferred title to the Property to the Vaughn Family Trust in 1998.  Defendant and cross-complainant Sannette Gite
(Gite or Cross-Complainant) was named as Trustee of the Vaughn Family Trust
(Gite) in 2011.  Since then, the Property
has been the subject of numerous conveyances and quiet title actions.  Here, U.S. Bank National Association (US Bank),
as assignee of Velocity Commercial Capital LLC (Velocity), and Mara Enterprises
(Mara) each allege an ownership interest in the Property.  To that end, US Bank and Mara filed separate
actions against Gite, in her capacity as Trustee of the Vaughn Family Trust,
and others, to quiet title to the Property.

            Procedural
Background
 
            On December
6, 2021, US Bank initiated its action for quiet title and declaratory relief
(the US Bank Action) against Gite, and others, in Case No. 21STCV44465.  
 
            On January
14, 2022, Mara initiated its action for quiet title and declaratory relief (the
Mara Action) against Gite, and others, in Case No. 22STCV01686.  
 
            As relevant
here, on January 13, 2023, in the US Bank Action, Gite filed the operative
First Amended Cross-Complaint (FAXC) against Velocity, among others.  
 
            In the
FAXC, Gite alleges the following causes of action against Velocity: (1)
declaratory relief, and (2) slander of title.[16]
 
On July 12, 2024, Velocity filed a motion for summary
judgment, or in the alternative, summary adjudication of issues on Gite’s
SAXC.  
 
On October 18, 2024, Gite filed an opposition.[17]
 
On October 25, 2024, Velocity replied.
 
II.        LEGAL
STANDARD
 
When reviewing a motion for summary judgment or summary
adjudication, courts must apply a three-step analysis: “(1) identify the issues
framed by the pleadings; (2) determine whether the moving party has negated the
opponent’s claims; and (3) determine whether the opposition has demonstrated
the existence of a triable, material factual issue.”¿ (Hinesley v. Oakshade
Town Center (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 289, 294.)¿¿A motion for summary judgment must be granted “if all the papers submitted
show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving
party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c,
subd. (c).)   
 
“[T]he initial burden is always on the moving party to make
a prima facia showing that there are no triable issues of material fact.”¿ (Scalf
v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1519.)¿ A defendant seeking summary judgment “bears the burden of
persuasion that there is no triable issue of material fact and that he is
entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”  (Aguilar v. Atlantic
Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 850 (Aguilar).) 
A defendant moving for summary judgment or summary adjudication “has met
his or her burden of showing that a cause of action has no merit if the party
has shown that one or more elements of the cause of action . . . cannot be
established, or that there is a complete defense to the cause of action.”¿
(Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2).)¿ A moving defendant need not
conclusively negate an element of plaintiff’s cause of action.¿ (Aguilar,
supra, 25 Cal.4th at p. 854.)¿¿ 
 
To meet this burden of showing a cause of action cannot be
established, a defendant must show not only “that the plaintiff does not
possess needed evidence” but also that “the plaintiff cannot reasonably
obtain needed evidence.”¿ (Aguilar, supra, 25 Cal.4th at p.
854.)¿ It is insufficient for the defendant to merely point out the absence of
evidence.¿ (Gaggero v. Yura (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 884, 891.)¿ The
defendant “must also produce evidence that the plaintiff cannot reasonably
obtain evidence to support his or her claim.”¿ (Ibid.)¿ The supporting
evidence can be in the form of affidavits, declarations, admissions,
depositions, answers to interrogatories, and matters of which judicial notice
may be taken.¿ (Aguilar, supra, 25 Cal.4th at p. 855.)¿¿ 
 
“Once the defendant … has met that burden, the burden
shifts to the plaintiff … to show that a triable issue of one or more material
facts exists as to the cause of action or a defense thereto.” (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 437c, subd. (p)(2).)¿The plaintiff may not merely rely on allegations or
denials of its pleadings to show that a triable issue of material fact exists,
but instead, “shall set forth the specific facts showing that a triable issue
of material fact exists as to the cause of action.”¿(Ibid.)¿ A plaintiff
opposing summary judgment defeats the motion by showing one or more triable
issues of material fact exist as to the challenged element. (Aguilar, supra,
25 Cal.4th at p. 849.)  “If the plaintiff cannot do so, summary judgment
should be granted.” (Avivi v. Centro Medico Urgente Medical Center
(2008) 159 Cal.App.4th 463, 467.)¿¿ 
 
The court must “liberally construe the evidence in support
of the party opposing summary judgment and resolve all doubts concerning the
evidence in favor of that party,” including “all inferences reasonably drawn
therefrom.” (Yanowitz v. L’Oreal USA, Inc. (2005) 36 Cal.4th 1028, 1037;
Aguilar, supra, 25 Cal.4th at pp. 844-45.)¿ “On a summary
judgment motion, the court must therefore consider what inferences favoring the
opposing party a factfinder could reasonably draw from the evidence.¿ While
viewing the evidence in this manner, the court must bear in mind that its
primary function is to identify issues rather than to determine issues.¿
[Citation.] Only when the inferences are indisputable may the court decide the
issues as a matter of law.¿ If the evidence is in conflict, the factual issues
must be resolved by trial.” (Binder v. Aetna Life Ins. Co. (1999) 75
Cal.App.4th 832, 839.)¿ “Put another way, have defendants conclusively negated
a necessary element of the [plaintiff’s] case or demonstrated that under no
hypothesis is there a material issue of fact that requires the process of
trial?”¿ (Jeld-Wen, Inc. v. Superior Court (2005) 131 Cal.App.4th 853,
860, internal citation omitted.)¿Further, “the trial court may not weigh the
evidence in the manner of a factfinder to determine whose version is more
likely true.¿ [Citation.]¿ Nor may the trial court grant summary judgment based
on the court’s evaluation of credibility.¿ [Citation.]” ¿(Id. at p. 840;
see also Weiss v. People ex rel. Department of Transportation (2020) 9
Cal.5th 840, 864 [“Courts deciding motions for summary judgment or summary
adjudication may not weigh the evidence but must instead view it in the light
most favorable to the opposing party and draw all reasonable inferences in
favor of that party”].)¿¿ 
 
III.       DISCUSSION
 
            Velocity raises three arguments in support of its motion:
(1) Gite cannot prevail on her claims against Velocity because Velocity
assigned its interest in the Property to US Bank; (2) Gite cannot prevail on
her Third Cause of Action for Slander of Title because Velocity recorded the
challenged Deed of Trust without knowledge of Gite’s claim to title, and (3) Velocity
incorporates by reference US Bank and Mara’s assertion that Gite lacks standing
to bring any crossclaims.  Because the court
has considered and rejected the challenge to Gite’s standing (see Tentative
Order re: US Bank’s and Mara’s Motions for Summary Judgment), the court
considers Velocity’s first and second arguments.[18]
 
A.   
Whether
Velocity’s Assignment Defeats Gite’s Claims.
 
Velocity argues it is entitled to summary judgment because
Velocity assigned its claims and liabilities to US Bank.  In support, Velocity submits the Deed of
Trust whereby Velocity assigned its rights in the Property to US Bank.  Velocity also cites two cases: Professional
Collection Consultants v. Hanada (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 1016 (Professional
Collection) and Truck Ins. Exchange v. Bennett (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th
75 (Truck Ins.).  Velocity relies
on Professional Collection for the general proposition that the assignee
acquires all the rights and liabilities of the assignor and Truck Ins. for
the proposition that liability from a slander of title action is
assignable.  
 
Velocity’s arguments lack merit.  First, the December 2019 Deed of Trust does
not convey Velocity’s liabilities to
US Bank.  The Deed of Trust states, in
relevant part, that Velocity, as assignor “does hereby grant, assign transfer
and convey, without recourse unto U.S. Bank National Association, …., assignee,
the described deed of trust with all interest, all liens, and any rights due or
to become due thereon.”  (Lawrence Decl.,
¶ 8, Ex. D.)  The assignment merely
transfers Velocity’s rights and interests in the Property to US Bank.  “The burden of proving an assignment falls
upon the party asserting rights thereunder. An assignment agreement must
describe the subject matter of the assignment with sufficient particularity to
identify the rights assigned.”  (Heritage
Pac. Fin., LLC v. Monroy (2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 972, 988 (cleaned
up).)  Here, there is no language which assigns
with sufficient particularity Velocity’s tortious liabilities to US Bank.  Velocity did not submit any evidence to
support its interpretation of the assignment.
 
Second, Professional Collection is inapposite.  That case concerned the applicable statute of
limitations for contract actions brought by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation.  Further, Professional
Collection has no application here because it merely states the general
rule that an “assignee stands in the shoes of the assignor, acquiring all of
its rights and liabilities.”  (Professional
Collection, 53 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1018-1019.)  It does not stand for the proposition that an
assignor is absolved of liability after an assignment of rights.  Indeed, as discussed above, the lynchpin of
the argument turns on the language of the assignment.  Under Professional Collection, an
assignee (here, US Bank) acquires the rights and liabilities of the
assignor.  Here, the assignment is silent
with respect to the transfer of Velocity’s tortious liabilities, if any.
 
Third, Velocity misreads Truck Ins.  That case states “a slander or disparagement
of title action is assignable, as it arises from the violation of a property
right; a defamation cause of action, as arising from the purely personal right
of the reputation of the one injured, is not assignable.”  (Truck Ins., 53 Cal.App.4th 75, 85,
fn. 4.)  As Gite correctly points out, Truck
Ins. concerns whether a plaintiff may assign the right to pursue a cause of
action for slander, not whether a defendant avoids liability for the wrongful
act by assigning the property.  
 
            However, Velocity’s
assignment impacts Gite’s declaratory relief cause of action.[19]  If Velocity lacks any present right or
interest in the Property, there is no actual controversy between Gite and
Velocity upon which declaratory relief may be granted.  “To qualify for declaratory relief, a party
would have to demonstrate its action presented two essential elements: (1) a
proper subject of declaratory relief, and (2) an actual controversy involving
justiciable questions relating to the party’s rights or obligations.”¿ (Jolley
v. Chase Home Finance, LLC (2013) 213 Cal.App.4th 872, 909 (cleaned up).) 
“[T]here is no basis for declaratory relief where only past wrongs are
involved.”¿ (Osseous Technologies of America, Inc. v. DiscoveryOrtho
Partners LLC (2010) 191 Cal.App.4th 357, 366, quotation marks omitted.)  
 
Gite argues a controversy still exists “as to who has legal
ownership over the subject property, and whether the assignment by defendant
Velocity conveyed any rights to defendant U.S. Bank.”  (Opposition, p. 9:12-13.)  But Gite merely points to past conduct (here,
Velocity’s assignment).  Further, Gite
seeks a declaration which would merely reflect Velocity’s current lack of rights
or interests in the Property.  In the
FAXC, Gite alleges:
 
“Cross-Complainant
desires a judicial declaration that SANNETTE GITE was the owner of the Property
as of September 2, 2011, pursuant to the grant deed and judgment recorded in the
Official Records of the County of Los Angeles (Exhibits 1 and 10); that the
grant deed and judgment recorded in the Official Records of the County of Los
Angeles (Exhibits 1 and 10) secured Cross-Complainant’s rights and interest in
the Property as of September 2, 2011; that December 30, 2019 Deed of Trust
(Exhibit 9), July 18, 2019 Deed of Trust (Exhibit 7) and October 19, 2020
Assignment of Deed of Trust (Exhibit 8) did not secure Cross-Defendants MARA ENTERPRISES’
and U.S. NATIONAL BANK ASSOCIATION’S, as Trustee of Velocity Commercial Capital
Loan Trust, interest in the Property as of December 30, 2019, and had not been valid
liens secured against the Property; that Cross-Defendants U.S. NATIONAL BANK ASSOCIATION
and MARA ENTERPRISES are not bona fide encumbrancers for value based on the
December 30, 2019 Deed of Trust (Exhibit 9), July 18, 2019 Deed of Trust
(Exhibit 7) and October 19, 2020 Assignment of Deed of Trust (Exhibit 8); and
that the claims of Cross-Defendants, and each of them against the Property are
without any rights whatsoever such that Cross-Defendants have no right, title,
estate, or interest in the Property or any part thereof.”
 
(FAXC, ¶ 43, emphasis in original.)  In other words, the declaration Gite seeks would
achieve the same result as Velocity’s assignment: leaving Velocity without any
right or interest in the Property.[20]
 Given there is no dispute of Velocity’s
present disinterest in the Property, summary adjudication of Gite’s
declaratory relief claim is warranted. 
 
B.    
Gite Raises
Triable Issues Re: Malice on the Slander of Title Claim.
 
Velocity argues the slander of title claim fails because it
recorded the Deed of Trust without knowledge or notice of Gite’s actual or
potential claim to title.  The elements
of a cause of action for slander of title are: “(1) a publication, (2) which is
without privilege or justification, (3) which is false, and (4) which causes
direct and immediate pecuniary loss.” (Alpha and Omega Development, LP v.
Whillock Contracting, Inc. (2011) 200 Cal.App.4th 656, 664; see also CACI
No. 1730.)  
 
In support, Velocity submits the declaration of Sandie
Lawrence to establish the following: in 2019, Velocity was approached by Yong
Hwa Chung (Chung) regarding a loan.  Lawrence
Decl., ¶ 5.)  Prior to approving a loan,
Velocity investigated Chung’s title interest and obtained a preliminary title
report from Chicago Title.  (Lawrence
Decl., ¶ 5, Ex. A.)  Velocity obtained a
title policy based on the preliminary title report.  (Lawrence Decl., ¶ 6, Ex. B.) Neither the
report nor the policy indicated an actual or potential claim to title by Gite
or any other third party.  (Lawrence
Decl., ¶ 6, Exs. A, B.) In reliance on the title report and policy, Velocity
extended and funded a loan to Chung, and thereafter recorded the Chung Deed of
Trust (DOT).  (Lawrence Decl., ¶¶ 6, 7,
Ex. C.)  Velocity assigned its interest
in the Chung DOT to US Bank and recorded and Assignment of Deed of Trust on
October 19, 2020, which ended Velocity’s interest in the Chung DOT.  (Lawrence Decl., ¶ 8, Ex. D.)  Velocity meets its initial burden.
 
The burden shifts.  Gite
argues Velocity acted with reckless disregard when it recorded its title and
liens against the Property.  In support,
Gite states that Velocity obtained a “Site X” report which showed all the
conveyances on the Property since it was initially conveyed to the Vaughn
Family Trust.  The report clearly showed
Gite, as trustee, had a continuing interest in the Property which was
inconsistent with Chung’s purported ownership of the Property.  Yet, Velocity did not investigate the
information, nor did it discuss the information with the title company who
provided the preliminary report.  Gite
also points out that the preliminary report showed title transactions on the
Property for only two years prior to the report.  
 
Further, Gite offers the opinion of experts Robert Brown (Brown)
and Don Ector (Ector) to establish the element of reckless disregard.  Brown states, 
 
“It
is my informed opinion that in entering their transactions, facts and
circumstances were made known or constructively known to the Defendants
Velocity, US Bank and Mara Enterprises which constituted bright “red flags”
putting the lenders and assignee on notice that the potential for fraud and illegal
activity were highly in evidence.” 
(Brown Decl., ¶ 4.)
 
“The
Site X report, which was possessed by Velocity and US Bank before their
respective transactions, contains a litany of unusual “back and forth”
transfers of the property between various individuals and entities, which
should have raised serious concerns to a reasonable lender regarding the validity
of the borrower/grantor’s legal title to the property. It is curious that the
preliminary title reports only references conveyances for the prior 24 months
from the lending date of July 2019. This seems highly unusual, and it does not
appear that the lender discussed or shared the Site X report with the title company.
Nonetheless, lenders and assignees have constructive notice of pertinent
matters in the public record.”  (Brown
Decl., ¶ 5.)
 
Regarding
Velocity, there are many atypical and uncharacteristic elements in the file which
place the bona fides of the lender and the legitimacy of the overall loan in
dire question, i.e., the prior loan that was paid off with the proceeds of the
subject loan had matured and was past due for over seven months. It had only
been on the property for a little less than two years. It is very questionable why
the defendant would make a loan allowing the borrower to “cash out” an
additional $100,000, especially based on what purported to be a “month to
month’ rental agreement on the subject property. In my view, the underwriting
analysis and rationale for the loan are dubious.  (Brown Decl., ¶ 6.)
 
I
am also of the opinion that turning a blind eye to all the red flags, not
investigating the title, recording the deed of trust and making no inquiry
about the Sannette Gite; The Vaughn Family Trust interest in the property was
reckless. I doubt that any conventional lenders would have engaged in this
transaction with this borrower and property. One could only infer that Velocity
just didn’t want to know, which is why they sought no explanation to explain
the litany of unusual “back and forth” transfers of the property which
conflicted with the borrowers claim of ownership.  (Brown Decl., ¶ 7.)
 
Given
that there was a recorded Judgement for possession, litigation occurring and ongoing
just preceding the making of the loan, the lender by exercising due diligence
could have easily examined the court records which would have disclosed the
litigation between the borrower and Sannette Gite, trustee of the Vaughn Family
Trust, and contacted her or her counsel to discuss her interest in the property.
Conducting this brief inquiry would have taken minimal effort by the lender and
firmly informed them of the circumstances regarding title to the property that
they were relying on and encumbering to make an approximately
one-million-dollar loan transaction. This is especially important given that
the Borrower did not exhibit the individual income to support repayment of the
Loan and the alleged rental income from the property was very speculative. This
was a very dubious underwriting position, at best, in my opinion, based upon my
experience as a former lender’s counsel and as a current bank director.  
(Brown
Decl., ¶ 8.)
 
In short, Brown opines that a reasonable lender would have investigated
the information contained in the Site X report or made an inquiry to determine
the nature and extent of the Vaughn Family Trust’s interest in the Property;
not to do so was reckless.  Indeed, a
cursory review of the History of Title Transfers listed above amply supports
Brown’s “red flag” assessment.  (See
Brown Decl., ¶ 5.)  Brown further opines
that it was reckless for defendant Velocity not to make an inquiry or
investigation of the information it obtained as well as the information in the
public record.
 
            Ector
provides a similar opinion.  In his
declaration, Ector states:
 
In
this case, I reviewed pertinent aspects of the file including deposition
testimony from the parties, reviewed the public record regarding the property,
the preliminary title report issued by Chicago Title Company and the Site X
report obtained by Velocity Commercial Capital. A preliminary title report customarily
reports all transfers, liens, judgements or burdens in the public record on or
related to the property from inception. Here, the report only indicates that
there have been no transfers of title for two years from the date of the
report.  For reasons that are unknown to
me, it does not disclose the entire history of transactions regarding the
property.  However, The (sic) Site X
report shows transfers on the property commencing in 1998.  (Ector Decl., ¶ 4.)
 
The
Site X report shows that Lion’s Proof (sic) transferred the property to both
M&R Bookkeeping Tax Services LLC and to Sannette Gite: Vaughn Family Trust
in 2011. Subsequently, there are numerous independent, uninsured transfers of
the property by Sannette Gite: Vaughn Family Trust and transfers of the
property by Yong Chung.  These transfers
raise red flags for any reasonable lender, broker or title officer because they
conflict with exclusive title ownership of the property.  In my opinion, Velocity, US Bank and Mara
enterprises (entities) should have investigated or at a minimum inquired about
the interest of Sannette Gite: Vaughn Family Trust before proceeding with a
loan to Yong Chung and recording a deed of trust or the assignment obtained
from him on the property.  Failing to
investigate to make an inquiring after obtaining knowledge of these conflicting
transfers of the property or failing to review the public record was reckless
in my opinion.  (Ector Decl., ¶ 5.)
 
In reply, Velocity argues Gite’s expert declarations do not
establish the element of reckless disregard because they merely posit Velocity
was constructively aware of Gite’s claim. 
Velocity’s summary of Gite’s expert declarations is reductive.  Velocity ignores the Site X report.  Brown and Ector each opine that Velocity was
reckless in failing to investigate the information contained in the Site X
report.  Velocity does not dispute having
obtained the report. Velocity’s custodian of records, Sandie Lawrence, does not
mention or discuss the Site X report.  Velocity
does not dispute its failure to discussing the Site X report with the title
company.  
 
Velocity argues it was not reckless because Velocity investigated
the title, as demonstrated by obtaining a preliminary report and thereafter, a
title policy.  Velocity points out that
Gite never recorded a lis pendens in her quiet title action.  However, at best, Velocity points to triable
issues of fact: whether Velocity exercised reasonable diligence in
investigating title by relying on a two-year preliminary title report and
whether ignoring the information in the Site X report was reckless, among other
issues.  Gite’s arguments raise triable
issues of material fact sufficient to defeat Velocity’s motion for summary
adjudication of the Third Cause of Action.
  
IV.       CONCLUSION
 
Velocity’s Motion for Summary Adjudication of the Second
Cause of Action for Declaratory Relief is GRANTED.
 
Velocity’s Motion for Summary Adjudication of the Third
Cause of Action for Slander of Title is DENIED. 
 
Gite to give notice.
