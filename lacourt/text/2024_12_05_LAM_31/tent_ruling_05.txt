Peterson Enterprises LLC dba Geoffreys Malibu
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     Plaintiff Maria
Abkarian
 
 
I.          FACTUAL AND
PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND
 
As
alleged in the complaint, in June 2023, Plaintiff Maria Abkaria (“Abkarian” or
“Plaintiff”) began her employment with Peterson Enterprises LLC d/b/a Geoffreys
Malibu (“Geoffreys”) as a Kitchen Manager.  Geoffreys is a restaurant business.  In August and September 2023, Abkarian made
complaints to supervisors and the owner of Geoffreys about experiencing unwelcome sexual
overtures, sexual advances, sexual touching, sexual assault and unwanted verbal
conduct by a line cook at Geoffreys named Domingo (last name unknown).  Abkarian also reported a complaint made by another
female employee about Domingo’s unwanted sexual touching as well.  Despite complaining about Domingo, no action
was taken.  Later, in October 2023,
Abkarian observed the presence of cockroaches and rats in the Geoffreys kitchen.  Concerned the pest issues were serious health
and safety code violations, Abkarian informed management.  Her concerns were not taken seriously or
flat-out denied.  On December 6, 2023,
Abkarian was terminated from her employment.
            On April 8, 2024, Plaintiff
filed a complaint against Geoffreys and Domingo for: 
1.     
Hostile Work Environment Sexual harassment in Violation
of the Fair Employment and Housing Act;
2.     
Failure to Prevent Hostile Work Environment Harassment
in Violation of Fair Employment and Housing Act;
3.     
Sex and Gender Discrimination in Violation of Fair
Employment and Housing Act; 
4.     
Retaliation in Violation of Fair Employment and Housing
Act;
5.     
Failure to Prevent Discrimination and Retaliation in
Violation of Fair Employment and Housing Act; 
6.     
Violation of the Ralph Civil Rights Act, Civil Code §
51.7; 
7.     
Violation of the Bane Civil Rights Act, Civil Code § 52.1;
8.     
Assault; 
9.     
Battery; 
10.  Violation
of Whistleblower Protection Pursuant to California Labor Code § 1102.5; 
11.  Retaliation
and Discrimination in Violation of California Labor Code §§ 6310 and 6311;
12. 
Wrongful Termination in Violation of Public
Policy.
            On June 28, 2024, Geoffreys (hereafter,
“Defendant”) filed A Motion to Compel Arbitration and Stay the Action.  Domingo concurrently filed a Joinder to the
Motion.
            On August 29, 2024, the court denied
Defendant’s motion. 
            On September 17, 2024, Defendant
filed a Notice of Appeal of the court’s August 29, 2024, order.
            On October 8, 2024, Defendant filed
this Motion to Stay Case Pending Appeal.
            On November 20, 2024, Plaintiff
filed an opposition.
            No reply was filed.
II.        DISCUSSION
& LEGAL STANDARD
Defendant filed this motion pursuant to the Federal
Arbitration Act (FAA) and Code of Civil Procedure section 1294.  Defendant argues a stay of proceedings is
mandatory under the FAA and discretionary under Section 1294.
In Coinbase, Inc. v. Bielski (2023) 599 U.S. 736, the High Court determined
that federal district courts are required to stay
proceedings where an appeal is made from an order denying a motion to compel arbitration. The court acknowledged that
§16(a) of the FAA does not say whether the district court proceedings must be
stayed. Nevertheless, the court determined that what it characterizes as the “Griggs principle” resolves
the case.  As explained by the Supreme
Court, the Griggs principle holds that the entire case essentially is
involved in the appeal and therefore there is no residual jurisdiction
maintained by the district court over which proceedings could proceed.   
This
court need not resolve the question whether Coinbase applies because the
court exercises its
discretion under Code of Civil Procedure section 1294 to stay the proceedings.  “Notwithstanding [C.C.P.] Section 916, the
perfecting of such an appeal shall not automatically stay any proceedings in
the trial court during the pendency of the appeal” concerning the denial or
dismissal of a petition to compel arbitration.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1294(a).)  
Further, every court is empowered to “provide for the orderly conduct of
proceedings before it.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 128(a)(3); see also Code Civ. Proc. § 187 [conferring on courts and judicial
officers “all the means necessary” to carry out their jurisdiction].)  The
court’s power to stay proceedings is inherent, and may be exercised in its
discretion when such a stay will accommodate the ends of justice.  (See
St. Paul Fire and Marine Insurance Company v. AmerisourceBergen Corp.
(2022) 80 Cal.App.5th 1, 6-7.)
Here, if Defendant’s appeal is meritorious, a stay will prevent
costly litigation and conserve judicial resources.  Accordingly, the court finds a stay will
accommodate the ends of justice.  
IV.       CONCLUSION
 
            The Motion
to Stay Case Pending Appeal is GRANTED. 
The court sets a Status Conference Re: Appeal for March 4, 2025, at 9:00
a.m.
 
            Defendant
to give notice.
