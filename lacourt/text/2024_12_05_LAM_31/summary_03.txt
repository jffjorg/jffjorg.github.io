Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving a dispute over the ownership of a property. The plaintiff, Gite, claims that she never transferred the property to any of the defendants and that the signature on a grant deed purporting to transfer the property to Lions Proof is a forgery. The judge has found that Gite's testimony is credible and that the signature on the grant deed is indeed a forgery. The judge has also found that each subsequent transaction derived from the grant deed is illegitimate.

The defendants, including Lions Proof, Velocity, Mara, and US Bank, have filed motions for summary judgment, which the judge has considered. The judge has denied some of the motions and granted others. The judge has also sustained demurrers to some of Gite's claims, including her quiet title claim against Velocity and Mara.

The judge's tentative ruling suggests that Gite's claims may be stronger than those of the defendants, but the judge has not yet made a final ruling. The case will likely proceed to trial or a settlement conference.

The significant statements in the judge's tentative ruling include:

* Gite's quiet title action established her right to the Property
* Lions Proof's grant deed was a forgery
* Each subsequent transaction derived from Lions Proof's grant deed was illegitimate
* Gite's declaratory relief claim is a proxy for her quiet title claim
