MOTION
FOR ATTORNEY FEES



 
MOVING PARTY:                   Plaintiffs
Hannah Park, as Trustee of the Gyoung Jae Park and Yoon Hee Choe Life Estate
Trust, et al.
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     Defendant Beverly
OB & GYN Medical Center, Inc.
 
 
 
            On June 30, 2020, Plaintiff, Plaintiffs Hannah Park and
David park, as Trustees of the Gyoung Jae Park and Yoon Hee Choe Life Estate
Trust, filed this declaratory relief action against Defendant, Beverly OB &
GYN Medical Center, Inc.  On January 20,
2023, Plaintiff filed the operative First Amended Complaint (FAC).
 
            On September
15, 2021, the court granted Plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment.  Judgment was entered on October 4, 2021.
 
            On November
17, 2021, Defendant filed a Notice of Appeal.
 
            On July 25,
2023, the Court of Appeal issued a Remittitur affirming the judgment.
 
            On September
15, 2023, Plaintiffs filed this motion for attorney fees incurred from the
appeal.  Defendants filed an opposition
and Plaintiffs replied.
 
            On November
30, 2023, the parties filed a stipulation to continue the hearing for
Plaintiffs’ motion for attorney’s fees. The basis for the stipulation was
three-fold: (1) Plaintiffs have been sued by prior counsel for fees arising out
of this instant matter including legal services rendered for the appeal; (2) Plaintiffs
disputed the amount claimed and timely demanded arbitration, and (3) the result
or resolution of that pending fee dispute may impact the award to be considered
by this court.
            On February
21, 2024, the court continued the hearing for the motion to March 29, 2024 and
directed the parties to notify the court of the status of arbitration no later
than 5 court days before the hearing.
 
            On March
25, 2024, the parties filed a joint status report.  The report states that the related fee
arbitration was continued to April 2, 2024. 
As such, the parties agree to continue the hearing for this motion for
another 45 days or as soon thereafter to allow the arbitrator to issue a
written decision and findings.
 
            On May 17,
2024, the parties filed a stipulated to continue the hearing for this motion to
September 5, 2024.
 
            On
September 4, 2024, the parties filed a stipulation to continue the hearing for
this motion to December 5, 2024.  In the
stipulation, the parties state the “amount of fees to be determined by this
court cannot be made until the Haney fee dispute is settled or tried in the
related action entitled HANEY & SHAH LLP, LIMITED LIABILITY PARTNERSHIP vs.
GYOUNG JAE PARK, et al. – LASC Case No. 23STCV14293.”  The stipulation further states, “The parties
hereto continue to make best efforts to reach an agreement on a fee award so as
to not have a stay imposed pending resolution of the action filed by Mr. Haney.”
 
            The parties
have not filed an update regarding the fee motion.  Further, Case No. 23STCV14293 has not settled
nor has a trial been set.
 
            Accordingly,
the court will hear from the parties whether to continue the hearing for this
motion or to stay the proceedings pending resolution of Case No. 23STCV14293.  
 
Clerk of the court to give notice.
