BACKGROUND           
            This
is an ADA/Unruh Civil Rights Act case. On October 3, 2024, plaintiff Orlando
Garcia (Plaintiff) filed this action against Haat Investments, LLC (Defendant)
and Does 1 through 50, alleging causes of action for violation of the Unruh
Civil Rights Act and violation of the California Disabled Persons Act. 
            On
November 20, 2024, default was entered against Defendant. 
            On
December 17, 2024, Plaintiff requested entry of default judgment. 
LEGAL
STANDARD 
Code of
Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a party
has failed to timely respond or appear. (Code Civ. Proc., § 585.) A party
seeking judgment on the default by the court must file a Request for Court
Judgment, and: (1) a brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other
admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested; (3) interest
computations as necessary; (4) a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) declaration
of nonmilitary status; (6) a proposed form of judgment; (7) a dismissal of all
parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application for separate
judgment under Code of Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of
grounds for each judgment; (8) exhibits as necessary; and (9) a request for
attorneys’ fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties. (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1800.) 
ANALYSIS 
Plaintiff
seeks default judgment against Defendants in the total amount of $7,203.08,
including $4,000.00 in damages, $2,425.00 in attorney fees, and $778.08 in
costs. The Court finds Plaintiff submitted sufficient evidence to support the
amount of damages requested, but finds Plaintiff’s request for attorney fees
excessive and that Plaintiff included improper items in the request for costs. 
The Court finds Plaintiff’s counsel’s hourly rate of $450.00 reasonable. (Price
Decl., ¶ 9.) “The courts repeatedly have stated that the trial court is
in the best position to value the services rendered by the attorneys in his or
her courtroom [citation], and this includes the determination of the hourly
rate that will be used in the lodestar calculus. [Citation.]” (569 E. Cnty.
Boulevard LLC v. Backcountry Against the Dump, Inc. (2016) 6 Cal.App.5th
426, 436–437.) However, the Court takes
issue with the following entries on Plaintiff’s counsel’s fee bill: 
-         
12/3/24 – Drafting default judgment,
5.00 hours; and
-         
12/4/24 – Reviewed and finalized Default
Judgement documents, 1.00 hour. 
Plaintiff
indicates that he is a high-frequency filer of ADA/Unruh Civil Rights Act
cases. (Compl., ¶ 28; Code Civ. Proc., § 425.50, subd. (a)(4)(ii).) Given the
high volume of such cases and the extensive repetition of work product therein,
the Court finds the above-referenced entries excessive. The Court will
therefore reduce them to 2.00 hours for drafting the default judgment and 0.5
hours for reviewing and finalizing the default judgment documents, which
results in a reduction of $1,575.00. Plaintiff’s revised total of attorney fees
is $850.00. 
With
respect to costs, Plaintiff improperly included items of postage. (Price Decl.,
Ex. 2, p. 14 of pdf; Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (b)(3).) The Court
therefore deducts $3.50 in postage costs. Plaintiff also included $200.00 in
“Investigator fees.” (Price Decl., Ex. 2, p. 14 of pdf.) Presumably, this
refers to the inspection of the subject property for purposes of ADA compliance,
but investigation expenses are generally excluded as recoverable costs. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subds. (b)(2), (b)(4).) The Court therefore deducts
$200.00 in costs as well. Plaintiff’s revised total of costs is $574.58. 
The
Court therefore GRANTS Plaintiff’s default judgment request in the reduced
amount of $5,424.58. 
CONCLUSION           
                Based on the
foregoing, Plaintiff’s
request for entry of default judgment is GRANTED in the reduced amount of $5,424.58. If Plaintiff submits on the
Tentative Ruling, the Court directs Plaintiff to submit a revised proposed
judgment consistent with the Court’s ruling herein for the Court’s review and
signature. If the new proposed default judgment is signed, no appearance is necessary.
