**English Summary:**

The judge has tentatively ruled to grant the Plaintiff, Orlando Garcia, a default judgment against the Defendant, Haat Investments, LLC, in the amount of $5,424.58. This is a reduced amount from the Plaintiff's initial request of $7,203.08. The reduction is due to the judge finding the Plaintiff's requested attorney fees and costs excessive. Specifically, the judge reduced the attorney fees by $1,575.00 and the costs by $203.58.  
  
The judge found the Plaintiff's evidence sufficient to support the damage claim of $4,000.00 but deemed portions of the attorney fee request excessive given the Plaintiff's high volume of similar cases. The judge also excluded certain costs, such as postage and investigator fees, that are not typically recoverable under California law.

The Plaintiff must submit a revised proposed judgment reflecting this reduced amount for the judge's final signature.  If the Plaintiff accepts the tentative ruling, no further court appearance will be necessary.

## English Summary 

This tentative ruling addresses a request by Plaintiff Orlando Garcia for a default judgment against Defendant Haat Investments, LLC in a case alleging violations of the Unruh Civil Rights Act and the California Disabled Persons Act.

The Court granted the default judgment, but reduced the amount from the Plaintiff's requested $7,203.08 to $5,424.58. The reduction stemmed from the Court finding the Plaintiff's requested attorney fees excessive and improper costs included in the request.  The Court found the $450.00 hourly rate reasonable but reduced the hours billed for drafting and reviewing the default judgment, deeming them excessive given the Plaintiff's frequent filing of similar cases. The Court also deducted postage and investigator fees from the requested costs. 

If the Plaintiff agrees to the Court's ruling, they must submit a revised proposed judgment for the Court's signature. If the revised judgment is signed, no further court appearance will be necessary.
