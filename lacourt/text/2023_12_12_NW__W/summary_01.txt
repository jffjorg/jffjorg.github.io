And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the motions filed by Defendant Abba Bail Bonds, Inc. and Gotham Bail Bonds, Inc.

Defendant Abba Bail Bonds, Inc. seeks to have the money judgment entered against it satisfied, arguing that it has paid the full amount due and that Plaintiff Gotham Bail Bonds, Inc. has refused to acknowledge this satisfaction. The court, however, agrees with Plaintiff that Abba has not shown full satisfaction of the judgment and therefore denies Abba's motion.

Gotham Bail Bonds, Inc. seeks to object to the undertaking on appeal by personal surety posted on behalf of judgment debtors, arguing that the undertaking does not meet the statutory requirements for an appeal bond. The court agrees with Gotham, finding that the undertaking was filed by a single purported surety, Teton Financial Membership Series, LLC, which is not an admitted surety insurer and therefore does not comply with the code. The court also finds that the undertaking does not demonstrate that the personal surety is worth the amount of the bond in real or personal property.

Gotham also seeks clarification of amounts subject to suretyship and enforcement, arguing that the court's previous minute order stated that there was a slight overstatement of the amount of the judgment. The court agrees with Gotham, finding that the amount subject to suretyship and enforcement would be the amounts of judgment plus costs, or $52,328.71 as to Abba and Un, and $125,648.36 as to Un and ICA.
