BACKGROUND
 
On August 6, 2019, Plaintiff filed a complaint against ABBA
Bail Bonds, Inc., Jane Un, Ruth Soto, and International Capital Alliance
asserting causes of action for 1) Breach of Written Contract; 2) Common Count –
Account Stated; 3) Quantum Meruit; 4) Breach of Written Contract; 5) Common
Count – Account Stated; and 6) Quantum Meruit. 
 
On March 9, 2020, default judgment was entered against
Defendants ABBA Bail Bonds, Inc., Jane Un, Ruth Soto and International Capital
Alliance. On May 23, 2022, this court granted the motion to set aside brought
by Ruth Soto, but denied it as to the three other defendants, finding that they
had been properly served. The court order the judgment vacated “as to Soto
only.” Judgment Debtors did not appeal the May 23, 2022 Order of this court. 
 
On October 20, 2022, this court entered an amended judgment
just as to those three defendants. In its February 24, 2023,
Order, this court declared that Gotham’s October 20, 2022 Corrected Default
Judgment to be “void ab initio”. A new judgment was entered on April 20, 2023.
That judgment was for $125,013.36 against Un and ICA and $51,693.71 against Un
and Abba. The court struck the language that interest would accrue as of March
9, 2020, but did leave in language that the judgment was issued “nunc pro
tunc.”

DISCUSSION
 
I.                   
DEFENDANT ABBA BAIL BONDS, INC.’S MOTION FOR ORDER ENTERING
SATISFACTION OF THE MONEY JUDGMENT ENTERED AGAINST IT ON APRIL 20, 2023
 
Defendant ABBA Bail Bonds, Inc. moves this court for an
Order entering a Full Satisfaction of the Judgment, as entered against ABBA on
April 20, 2023, on the grounds its portion of the money judgment, including all
of the costs awarded, have been paid in full, that Plaintiff Gotham Bail Bonds,
Inc. and its attorneys have refused to enter satisfaction of judgment, and have
further failed and refused to refund the excess payments. Defendant ABBA
further seeks damages and an award of attorney fees and costs against Gotham. 
 
Code of Civil Procedure § 724.010(a) provides, “[a] money
judgment may be satisfied by payment of the full amount required to satisfy the
judgment or by acceptance by the judgment creditor of a lesser sum in full
satisfaction of the judgment.”   
 
Where a judgment has been satisfied, but the judgment
creditor refuses to file an acknowledgment of this satisfaction, CCP § 724.050
provides the relevant procedure for obtaining such an acknowledgement by court
order.  The judgment debtor must first make a demand on the judgment
creditor. (CCP § 724.050(a)-(b).) If the judgment creditor continues to refuse
to file the acknowledgement, the judgment debtor may thereafter “apply to the
court on noticed motion for an order requiring the judgment creditor to comply
with the demand. . . .  If the court determines that the judgment has been
satisfied and that the judgment creditor has not complied with the demand, the
court shall either (1) order the judgment creditor to comply with the demand or
(2) order the court clerk to enter satisfaction of the judgment.” (CCP §
724.050(d).)
 
Defendant ABBA Bail Bonds, Inc. claims since the April 20,
2023 judgment was entered against ABBA, the total amount due thereunder was
only "$52,430.46 [principal, costs & accrued interest]. Despite this
mathematical fact, Gotham caused a notice of involuntary lien to be recorded,
which gave notice to the entire world that ABBA owed more than three times that
amount, $177,342.07. Abba contends the amounts received by Gotham are as
follows: $30,000 from the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department which was obtained
from Abba during its “Gatekeeping activities”; attorney Matthews personally
tendered a check, drawn on our firm's Client Trust Account for $15,000.00 to Gotham's
counsel; and $804.04 received from the Ventura County Sheriff for a bank levy
on Chase Bank. 
 
In opposition, Gotham argues the motion should be denied
because Abba Bail Bonds, Inc. still owes $38,739.11 on the Judgment against it
and an additional $616.19 on the Cost Bill against it. Gotham contends there
have been only two payments for which ABBA is entitled to credit on the
judgment against it. One is for the amount of $804.04 received from the Ventura
County Sheriff for a bank levy on Chase Bank. The other credit is for the
amount of $15,000.00 which was paid by check handed over in court on or about
May 5, 2023. However, as to the $30,000 Abba refers to, Gotham contends it is simply
untrue that those funds were ABBA’s. The $30,000 was from a levy on funds held
by an escrow holder for the benefit of Jane Un, not ABBA. Gotham contends the
"$30,000" came from a levy of the escrow in which Jane Un was the
Buyer on the levy date.  As a result, Abba
still owes $38,739.11 on the Judgment against it and an additional $616.19 on
the Cost Bill against it. Gotham notes Jane Un and ICA, as of November 20, 2023
still owe $95,618.24 on the judgment against them and as of November 20, 2023
all judgment debtors still owe $616.19 on the cost bill against them. 
 
The court agrees Abba has not shown full satisfaction of the
judgment. Exhibit 4, the Notice of Motion for Order Authorizing Trustee to Sell
Real Property and Trust Deeds, filed December 16, 2022, describes Jane Un as
the Buyer in the actual signed signature block of the Purchase Agreement. In
Exhibit 5, Jane Un’s Declarations in Support of Motion for Order Authorizing
Trustee to Sell Real Property and Trust Deeds, Un confirmed her status as a
party to the transaction levied upon. As such, it is unclear that the $30,000
received from the Ventura County Sheriff for a bank levy on Chase Bank came
from Abba. The court also notes Gotham disputes that the $30,000 was actually $29,988.00
paid by the L.A. County Sheriff on Jun 30, 2023. (Exh. 3.) 
 
Accordingly, Defendant
Abba Bail Bonds, Inc.’s Motion for Order Entering Satisfaction of the Money
Judgment Entered Against it on April 20, 2023 is DENIED. 
 
II.                
GOTHAM BAIL BONDS, INC.’S MOTION OBJECTING TO THE
UNDERTAKING ON APPEAL BY PERSONAL SURETY POSTED HEREIN ON BEHALF OF JUDGMENT
DEBTORS AND REQUESTING CLARIFICATION OF AMOUNTS SUBJECT TO ANY UNDERTAKING
 
Gotham Bail Bonds, Inc. objects to the Undertaking on Appeal
by Personal Surety posted herein on October 10, 2023 on behalf of Judgment
Debtors and Requesting Clarification of Minute Order of October 10, 2023. 
 
Gotham objects to the contends the Undertaking on Appeal by
Personal Surety on the following basis: (1) Undertaking on Appeal by Personal
Surety filed by a single purported surety on behalf of Judgment Debtors does
not comply with the Code. A single personal surety cannot bond a judgment on
appeal. (CCP § 995.310.) Instead, at least two personal sureties, or one
personal surety and one admitted surety are required; (2) Moreover, a personal
surety has to be an individual person, not a corporation nor an LLC. (CCP
§955.510.); and (3) Lastly, the purported undertaking has not demonstrated that
the personal surety "is worth the amount of the bond in real or personal
property, or both, situated in this state, over and above all debts and
liabilities, exclusive of property exempt from enforcement of a money judgment"
as required by Code of Civil Procedure § 995.510 (a)(3). Gotham also requests
Clarification of Minute Order of October 10, 2023.
 
Single Personal Surety
 
Gotham argues Code of Civil Procedure § 995.310 is very
clear - "Unless the statute providing for the bond requires execution by
an admitted surety insurer, a bond shall be executed by two or more sufficient
personal sureties or by one sufficient admitted surety insurer or by any
combination of sufficient personal sureties and admitted surety insurers."
Here, the undertaking was filed by Teton Financial Membership Series, LLC, a
single purported surety and does not meet the statutory requirements for an appeal
bond.
 
The court agrees. The bond has not been executed by two or more
sufficient personal sureties or by one sufficient admitted surety insurer. No
where does Teton provide that it is an admitted surety insurer. “Admitted
surety insurer" means a corporate insurer or a reciprocal or
interinsurance exchange to which the Insurance Commissioner has issued a
certificate of authority to transact surety insurance in this state, as defined
in Section 105 of the Insurance Code.” (CCP § 995.120.) 
 
Individual 
 
Gotham next argues the reference in § 995.510(a)(2)
requiring a surety to be a resident, and either an owner of real property or
householder, within the state, makes it clear that LLCs cannot be personal
sureties. Gotham contends LLCs are certainly not "householders" and
while they may have principal places of business in the state, that does not
make them "a resident" of the state.
 
The court agrees. Teton is not an admitted surety insurer.
As such, personal sureties must be individuals. 
 
Inadequate Description
 
Lastly, Gotham argues in addition to the other requirements
of the code, it has to be demonstrated that “[t]he surety is worth the amount
of the bond in real or personal property.” (CCP § 995.510(a)(3).) Here,
however, the declaration of the purported surety is woefully inadequate. The
sole asset listed is something described as a 15% interest’ of “Teton Financial
Membership Series – Concierge Risk Retention Management – Series 9", with
no description of where or what that is. 
 
The court agrees. There has been no reasonable demonstration
that "[t]he surety is worth the amount of the bond in real or personal
property."
 
Clarification
 
Gotham requests a clarification as to the amounts subject to
suretyship and enforcement. Gotham contends the court in its first Minute Order
of October 10, 2023 stated that there was " . .. a slight overstatement of
the amount of the judgment. Plaintiff stated that the total judgment against
Abba and Un was $52,328.71 when it was $51,693.71 and against Un and ICA in the
amount of $125,648.36 when it should have been $125,013.36." (page 3, 1st
Minute Order, bottom). However, this "overstatement" in each case of
$635 consists of the costs awarded at P.2, line 17, of the judgment filed April
20,2023, which as the court noted at page 5 of that same Minute Order would
have been a ". . . . cost award is incorporated into the judgment".
 
To clarify, the amount subject to suretyship and enforcement
would be the amounts of judgment plus costs, or $52,328.71 as to Abba and Un,
and $125,648.36 as to Un and ICA.
