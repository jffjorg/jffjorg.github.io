And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling confirms the arbitration award of $107,950 in favor of 8912 W Pico Blvd LLC against Kosher Foods Unlimited, Inc. The arbitrator's authority to order joint and several liability for Alain Cohen was challenged, but the court finds no evidence of duress in the execution of the separate arbitration agreement. The court also denies the request for attorney's fees and costs, finding that the parties' underlying lease and the separate arbitration agreement do not provide a basis for awarding such fees. The court issues a proposed judgment and sets no future dates, as no further action is required.
