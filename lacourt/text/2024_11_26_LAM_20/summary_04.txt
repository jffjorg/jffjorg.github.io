The case involves a breach of settlement, and the Plaintiff argues that the Defendant failed to provide proper notice before filing a motion to enforce the settlement. The Defendant, on the other hand, argues that the settlement from a previous case (23STLC03519) bars this lawsuit. The Judge has ruled that the cases will not be related, as the previous case has already been settled and the issues presented in this case are separate and distinct. The Judge has also stated that the benefit of relating the cases is not apparent.
