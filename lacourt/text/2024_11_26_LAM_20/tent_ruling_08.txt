On August 19, 2024, BBTEX USA, Inc. filed a Complaint against its landlord, Sieroty Company, Inc., for (1) breach of contract, (2) anticipatory breach, and (3) violation of Civ. Code § 1950.7.  BBTEX contends that Sieroty failed to return its $120,000 security deposit.On October 17, 2024, Sieroty filed an unlawful detainer complaint against BBTEX.  This is case no. 24STCV27222.BBTEX now seeks to relate 24STCV27222 to the instant matter.The inquiry on a notice of related cases is whether the cases at issue (1) involve the same parties and are based on the same or similar claims; (2) arise from the same or substantially identical transactions, incidents, or events requiring the determination of the same or substantially identical questions of law or fact; (3) involve claims against, title to, possession of, or damages to the same property; or (4) are likely for other reasons to require substantial duplication of judicial resources if heard by different judges.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.300(a).)The cases will not be related.  The summary procedures of the unlawful detainer action would be inhibited by relating such a matter to the instant breach of contract action.
