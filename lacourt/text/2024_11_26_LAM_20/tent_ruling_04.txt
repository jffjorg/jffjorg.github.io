On October 21, 2024, Plaintiff Jason Alan filed the operative Second Amended Complaint against Logix Federal Credit Union.  Plaintiff alleges that Defendant breached a settlement from case no. 23STLC03519.Defendant argues that the settlement from 23STLC03519 bars this lawsuit because Plaintiff failed to provide proper notice prior to filing suit.  Defendant now seeks to relate 23STLC03519 to the instant matter.The inquiry on a notice of related cases is whether the cases at issue (1) involve the same parties and are based on the same or similar claims; (2) arise from the same or substantially identical transactions, incidents, or events requiring the determination of the same or substantially identical questions of law or fact; (3) involve claims against, title to, possession of, or damages to the same property; or (4) are likely for other reasons to require substantial duplication of judicial resources if heard by different judges.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.300(a).)The cases will not be related.  23STLC03519 has already settled, and the motion to enforce settlement therein is a separate and distinct concept from the issues presented herein.  The benefit of relation is not apparent.
