And here is the English-text summary:

The Court has reviewed the Expedited Petition to Approve Minor's Compromise, but declines to approve it as requested. The Court has identified several defects in the petition, including an incorrect box being checked, a lack of proof of service, and incomplete information regarding the net settlement and attorney fees. To correct these defects, the Court has scheduled a hearing for October 2, 2024, and ordered counsel to file a corrected regular minor's compromise petition. The petition must include a declaration of written assurance by the Petitioner and indicate the amount of attorney fees to be received from the Petitioner's and other plaintiff's settlements.
