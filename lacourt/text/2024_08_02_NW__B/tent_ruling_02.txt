      CASE NO: 22STCV04326
 
[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE: MOTION TO QUASH SUBPOENAS
 
Dept. B
8:30 a.m.
August 2, 2024



 
I.                  
BACKGROUND
 
On February 3, 2022, Plaintiff
Lizza Schlumbrecht (“Plaintiff”)
filed a complaint against Defendant Karen Solomon (“Defendant”), alleging causes of action for motor vehicle and general negligence,
arising out of a vehicle collision that occurred on May 11, 2021.
 
On June 5, 2024, Plaintiff filed this motion to quash Defendant’s subpoena
for Plaintiff’s insurance records. On July 23, 2024, Defendant filed an
opposition. No reply has been filed.
 
II.               
LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
When a subpoena has been issued requiring the attendance of
a witness or the production of documents, electronically stored information, or
other things before a court or at the taking of a deposition, the court, upon
motion “reasonably made” by the party, the witness, or any consumer whose
personal records are sought, or upon the court's own motion after giving
counsel notice and an opportunity to be heard, may make an order quashing the
subpoena entirely, modifying it, or directing compliance with it upon those
terms and conditions as the court may specify.  (See Code Civ. Proc. §
1987.1; Southern Pac. Co. v. Superior Court (1940) 15
Cal.2d 206.) 
 
The court
can make an order quashing or modifying a subpoena as necessary to protect a
person from “unreasonable or oppressive demands, including unreasonable
violations of the right of privacy of the person.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §
1987.1, subd. (a).)
 
For discovery purposes, information is relevant if it might
reasonably assist a party in evaluating the case, preparing for trial, or
facilitating settlement.  (Gonzalez v. Superior Court (1995) 33
Cal.App.4th 1539, 1546.)  Generally, all unprivileged information that is relevant to
the subject matter of the action is discoverable if it would itself be
admissible evidence at trial or if it appears reasonably calculated to lead to
the discovery of admissible evidence.  (Code Civ.
Proc. § 2017.010; Schnabel v. Superior Court (1993)
5 Cal.4th 704, 711.)   
 
III.            
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff
moves to quash or modify Defendant’s subpoenas issued on May 10, 2024 for
health insurance records from Aetna, Cigna and Blue Shield, asking for
“[a]ny and all documents and records pertaining to the insurance and claim
file” of Plaintiff (Habbas Decl., Exh. 1), on the grounds that records are protected under the right to privacy,
and the subpoenas are overbroad as to scope and time.
California’s Constitutional right
to privacy protects against the unwarranted, compelled disclosure of various
private or sensitive information regarding one’s personal life.¿ (Britt
v. Superior Court (1978) 20 Cal.3d 844, 855-856.)
Plaintiff has a right to privacy with
respect to her medical records. (See Board of Medical Quality Assurance v.
Gherardini (1979) 93 Cal.App.3d 669, 678-679, and Davis v. Superior
Court (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1008, 1019.)
 
Under Hill v. Nat'l Collegiate
Athletic Assn. (1994) 7 Cal. 4th 1, 35-37, the party asserting a privacy
right must establish a legally protected privacy interest, an objectively
reasonable expectation of privacy in the given circumstances, and a threatened
intrusion that is serious. (Id.) The party seeking the information may
raise in response whatever legitimate and important countervailing interests
disclosure serves, while the party seeking protection may identify feasible
alternatives that serve the same interests or protective measures that would
diminish the loss of privacy. A court must then balance these competing
considerations. (Id. at 37–40.) 
Here, Plaintiff has raised an objectively reasonable
expectation of privacy in her medical records.  However, as previously noted, Plaintiff’s privacy
interests must be balanced against Defendant’s right to obtain discovery. 
While Plaintiff has put her injuries relating to the collision at issue in this
case by filing a lawsuit against Defendant, the subpoenas seeking Plaintiff’s
entire medical records are overbroad. 
In opposition, Defendant argues that the health
insurance records are relevant to investigating alternative causation of
Plaintiff’s injuries. Defendant argues she cannot rely solely on the medical
providers identified in discovery, because Plaintiff may have treated with
other medical providers who she does not remember. Further, Defendant argues
that Plaintiff received similar medical treatment before the accident.
Plaintiff testified she had neck surgery in 2018. (Radusic Decl. ¶ 3; Exh. B,
at 22, 87.) The surgery was covered by Plaintiff’s medical insurance. (Id.,
Exh. B, at 91- 92.) Plaintiff first started having neck pain after an accident
in between 2015 and 2016. (Id., Exh. B, at 82- 83.) Plaintiff’s insurance
records would have complete information about Plaintiff’s medical treatment and
prior injuries. 
Defendant cannot go on a fishing expedition into
Plaintiff’s private medical records based on speculation as to where
Plaintiff’s injuries may originate. “Mere speculation as to the possibility that some portion of the records
might be relevant to some substantive issue does not suffice” for showing
direct relevance as to private information sought in discovery. (Davis v.
Superior Court (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1008, 1017-1020.) Defendant has failed to articulate
any important
countervailing interest disclosure would serve.
Therefore, the subpoenas will be modified to only
information relating to the body parts at issue in this case limited to a
5-year period. Defendant will still be able to explore the medical records and
information it seeks with a narrowed subpoena limited to the body parts at
issue.
Sanctions
Plaintiff
requests sanctions against Defendant under § 1987.2(a).
The
court may award the amount of the reasonable expenses incurred in making or
opposing a motion to quash, including reasonable attorney's fees, if the court
finds the motion was opposed in bad faith or without substantial justification
or that one or more of the requirements of the subpoena was oppressive. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1987.2(a).)
Plaintiff
did not seek sanctions in the notice of its opposition. CCP section 2023.040 states: “A request for a sanction shall, in
the notice of motion, identify every person, party, and attorney against whom
the sanction is sought, and specify the type of sanction sought.” Thus,
the request for sanctions is denied.
 
IV.            
CONCLUSION 
Based
on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s motion to quash subpoenas for health
insurance records is
GRANTED in part. The subpoenas are limited to the body parts at issue and to a
5-year period. Plaintiff’s request for sanctions is DENIED.
 
Defendant is ORDERED to give
notice.
