 On May 30, 2023, Michelle Chen Frost filed a Cross-Complaint for defamation. On October 20, 2023, Michelle Frost dismissed her Cross-Complaint without prejudice.On October 24, 2023, despite the dismissal, the Court granted a special motion to strike Michelle Frost’s Cross-Complaint pursuant to Code Civ. Proc. § 425.16.  Defendant Michelle Frost now seeks leave to file a first amended cross-complaint adding causes of action for (1) conversion, (2) nuisance, (3) trespass, (4) assault, and (5) intentional infliction of emotional distress.No oppositions were filed.Given that the Cross-Complaint was dismissed, the anti-SLAPP motion should have merely decided the propriety of fees.  Had the anti-SLAPP motion have actually stricken the Cross-Complaint, the Court would deny the Motion: “[a]llowing a SLAPP plaintiff leave to amend the complaint once the court finds the prima facie showing has been met would completely undermine the statute by providing the pleader a ready escape from section 425.16's quick dismissal remedy.”  (Simmons v. Allstate Ins. Co. (2001) 92 Cal.App.4th 1068, 1073; see also Mobile Med. Servs., etc. v. Rajaram (2015) 241 Cal.App.4th 164, 172 [“there was no basis for the court to grant leave to amend the complaint. The order granting the motion to strike the original complaint found all the speech was protected and there was no probability plaintiffs would prevail on the complaint as alleged. The original motion to strike should have been granted in its entirety without allowing leave to amend.”].)But, here, the Cross-Complaint was dismissed without having to grant the anti-SLAPP motion.  Therefore, there is seemingly nothing precluding a request to file a new cross-complaint.  Cross-complaints fall into two categories—permissive and compulsory.  Compulsory cross-complaints consist of those causes of action existing at the time of service of the answer that the defendant must bring against the plaintiff, or else forfeit the right to bring them in any other action.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 426.30(a).)  Specifically, compulsory cross-complaints consist of those causes of action that “arise out of the same transaction, occurrence, or series of transactions or occurrences as the cause of action which the plaintiff alleges in his complaint.”  (Id. § 426.10(c).)  To avoid piecemeal litigation, courts liberally construe the term “transaction”—it is “ ‘not confined to a single, isolated act or occurrence . . . but may embrace a series of acts or occurrences logically interrelated.’ ” (Align Technology, Inc. v. Tran (2009) 179 Cal.App.4th 949, 960.)  Parties seeking to file untimely compulsory cross-complaints may file with the Court for leave to do so, even though the failure to timely file resulted from oversight, inadvertence, mistake, neglect, or other cause.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 426.50.)  In such a case, after notice to the adverse party, the Court must grant leave to file the cross-complaint if the party acted in good faith.  Unrelated claims and those claims arising after service of the answer are permissive, not compulsory.  (Crocker Nat. Bank v. Emerald (1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 852, 864.)  Permissive cross-complaints are governed by Code of Civil Procedure § 428.50(c), which provides, “A party shall obtain leave of court to file any cross-complaint except one filed within the time specified in subdivision (a) or (b).  Leave may be granted in the interest of justice at any time during the course of the action.”  The decision to grant permission to file a permissive cross-complaint rests within the sound discretion of the trial court.  (Orient Handel v. United States Fid. & Guar. Co. (1987) 192 Cal.App.3d 684, 701.)As there is no opposition, the Motion is granted.  (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 8.54(c); Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.) Moving party to give notice.If counsel do not submit on the tentative, they are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
