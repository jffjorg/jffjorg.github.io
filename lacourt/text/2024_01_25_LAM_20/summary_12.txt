And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the defendant's request to file a first amended cross-complaint, adding new causes of action for conversion, nuisance, trespass, assault, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The Cross-Complaint was previously dismissed without prejudice, and the anti-SLAPP motion was granted, but the Judge finds that the anti-SLAPP motion should have only decided the propriety of fees, not struck the Cross-Complaint. The Judge notes that the defendant is seeking to add new causes of action that arise out of the same transaction or occurrence as the original cause of action, and that the failure to timely file the cross-complaint was due to oversight or mistake. The Judge grants the motion, citing various court decisions and statutes, including Code of Civil Procedure sections 425.16, 426.10(c), 426.30(a), 426.50, and 428.50(c).
