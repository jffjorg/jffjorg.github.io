And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed the case and has made a tentative ruling. The Plaintiff, East West Bank (EWB), has filed a Complaint in interpleader against the Defendants, seeking to be discharged of liability for the disputed funds. EWB deposited the funds with the Court and requests attorneys' fees and costs. The Court finds that EWB properly initiated the interpleader and will be discharged of liability.

Regarding the request for attorneys' fees and costs, the Court finds that the hours expended are excessive. However, the Court awards a total of $10,000 in fees and costs only, as allowed by law.

The Motion is granted in part as set forth herein. The parties are directed to give notice.
