And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling on a motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings in a case between Whittwood, LLC and 14 West, LP (the "Plaintiffs") and West Coast Dental Administrative Services, LLC, d/b/a West Coast Services, Inc., f/k/a Frontier Dental Management (the "Defendant"). The Plaintiffs are seeking to compel arbitration of certain claims and stay the proceedings pending arbitration. The Defendant opposes the motion.

The Court notes that the lease agreement between the parties contains an arbitration agreement that excludes certain matters from arbitration. The Plaintiffs have repeatedly stated that they are only seeking to compel into arbitration those claims that do not fall into the exclusions.

The Court concludes that since the complaint's two contractual claims, as well as the cross-complaint's claim for breach of contract, facially arise out of the contract containing the arbitration agreement, it is appropriate to compel such claims into arbitration. The remaining causes of action will be stayed pending arbitration.

The Court grants the Plaintiffs' motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings. The Court orders that the instant proceedings be stayed "until an arbitration is had in accordance with the order to arbitrate or until such earlier time as the court specifies," and will set an OSC re: completion of arbitration in approximately 12 months.
