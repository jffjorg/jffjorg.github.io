On November 9, 2022, plaintiff Frances  Gundlach (Plaintiff) filed this action against defendants Frank Flores (Frank),  Lydia Flores and Does 1 through 100 (collectively, Defendants). On October 18,  2023, Plaintiffs filed the operative First Amended Complaint (FAC) against the  same Defendants, alleging causes of action for strict liability, negligence,  premises liability, and negligence per se. On January 3, 2024, the Court  sustained Defendants’ demurrer to the Fourth Cause of Action for negligence per  se with leave to amend. Plaintiff did not amend the FAC. On February 2, 2024,  Defendants filed an answer to the remaining causes of action in the FAC.  On July 15, 2024, an Informal Discovery Conference was held, and  pursuant to the parties’ agreement, Plaintiff was ordered to serve verified  supplemental responses to Defendant Frank’s Form Interrogatories and Special  Interrogatories by the close of business on August 5, 2024, and gave Frank  until August 12, 2024, to file motions to compel further responses to those  discovery requests. On August 9, 2024, Defendant Frank moved to compel further  responses to Form Interrogatories and Special Interrogatories. The motions are  unopposed.  LEGAL  STANDARD  Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.300(a)  provides that on receipt of a response to interrogatories, the propounding  party may move for an order compelling a further response if the propounding  party deems that any of the following apply:              (1) An answer to a particular  interrogatory is evasive or incomplete. (2) An exercise of the option to produce  documents under Section 2030.230 is unwarranted or the required  specification of those documents is inadequate. (3) An objection to an interrogatory is  without merit or too general.  (Code Civ.  Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (a).)              Code of Civil Procedure section  2030.300(d) further provides that “[t]he court shall impose a monetary sanction  under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person,  or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a further  response to interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the  sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make  the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ.  Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (d).)            DISCUSSION  Meet and Confer  The Court finds Defendant Frank’s efforts to meet and confer  sufficient. (Kraft Decls., ¶¶ 4-8; Dept. 6 Courtroom Information.)              Analysis  Defendant  Frank moves to compel further responses to Form Interrogatories and Special  Interrogatories. Frank indicates having served these discovery requests on  November 21, 2023, and on April 30, 2024, the Court granted Frank’s motions to  compel responses to these discovery requests. Frank indicates that Plaintiff  served responses the day before the hearing on the motions to compel responses,  i.e., on April 29, 2024. After receiving the initial responses, Frank indicates  having attempted to meet and confer regarding the deficiencies of these responses,  but to no avail. Frank indicates the parties attend an Informal Discovery  Conference on July 15, 2024, in which Plaintiff agreed to serve verified  supplemental responses on or before August 5, 2024, and if Plaintiff failed to  do so, Defendant had until August 12, 2024 to file these motions. Frank  indicates having received no responses from Plaintiff as of the filing date of  these motions.  The  Court finds Frank’s motions well taken. Having reviewed the Separate Statements  for each motion, the Court finds the vast majority of Plaintiff’s responses to the  subject Form Interrogatories and Special Interrogatories evasive, incomplete,  or non-responsive. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (a)(1).) Also, although  not mentioned in Frank’s moving papers, the Court notes that some responses  improperly exercised the option to produce documents, which right was waived  when Plaintiff failed to provide timely initial responses. (Id., §  2030.300, subd. (a)(2).) Additionally, the Court construes Plaintiff’s lack of  opposition to these motions as a tacit admission that they are meritorious. (Sexton  v. Superior Court (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410; C. Opposing the  Motion—and Rebutting the Opposition, Cal. Prac. Guide Civ. Pro. Before Trial  Ch. 9(I)-C, ¶ 9:105.10; see also Moulton Niguel Water Dist. v.  Colombo (2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 1210, 1215 [“Contentions are waived  when a party fails to support them with reasoned argument and citations to  authority. [Citation.]”])  The  Court notes, however, a small handful of responses in which Plaintiff  sufficiently responded, namely Form Interrogatory Numbers 2.12, 4.1, 10.1,  11.1, 12.2, 12.6, 12.7, 13.1, and 14.2, and Special Interrogatory Numbers 18,  53, 54, 55, and 98. The Court therefore declines to grant the motions as to  those responses.  Accordingly,  the Court GRANTS Frank’s motion to compel further responses to Form Interrogatories. The Court  ORDERS Plaintiff Frances Gundlach to provide further code-compliant responses,  without objections, to Form Interrogatory Numbers 2.1, 2.3, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7,  2.13, 3.6, 3.7, 6.2, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, 6.7, 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5, 8.6, 8.7,  8.8, 10.2, 10.3, 11.2, 12.1, 12.3, 12.4, 12.5, 13.2, 14.1, 20.1, 20.3, and  20.4, within 20 days of the Court’s order. The Court otherwise DENIES the  motion.  The Court also GRANTS Frank’s motion to compel further responses  to Special Interrogatories. The Court ORDERS Plaintiff Frances Gundlach to  provide further code-compliant responses, without objections, to Special  Interrogatory Numbers 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20,  21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40,  41, 42, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 59, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 75,  76, 77, 78, 79, 81, 82, 84, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 99, 100, within 20  days of the Court’s order. The Court otherwise DENIES the motion.  The Court also finds Frank is entitled to monetary sanctions, and  GRANTS Frank’s requests in the amount of $811.65 for each motion, comprised of 3.0  hours preparing each motion and appearing at the hearing on each motion,  multiplied by the hourly rate of $250.00, plus the $61.65 filing fees.  Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s attorney of record must pay said monetary sanctions  to counsel for Frank within 20 days of the Court’s order.  CONCLUSION  The Court GRANTS Defendant Frank Flores’ motion to compel further  responses to Form Interrogatories. The Court ORDERS Plaintiff Frances Gundlach  to provide further code-compliant responses, without objections, to Form  Interrogatory Numbers 2.1, 2.3, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 2.13, 3.6, 3.7, 6.2, 6.4, 6.5,  6.6, 6.7, 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5, 8.6, 8.7, 8.8, 10.2, 10.3, 11.2, 12.1, 12.3,  12.4, 12.5, 13.2, 14.1, 20.1, 20.3, and 20.4, within 20 days of the Court’s  order.
