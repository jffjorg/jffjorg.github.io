Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to compel the defendant to provide further verified responses to special interrogatories. The motion was filed by the plaintiff after the defendant provided responses to the special interrogatories that the plaintiff deemed to be improper and incomplete. The defendant had previously objected to the special interrogatories, claiming that they were overly broad and required the defendant to provide answers to scientific matters on which expert testimony would be required at trial.

The judge found that the plaintiff had adequately met and conferred with the defendant before filing the motion, but that the special interrogatories at issue were improperly designed to require the defendant to provide answers to scientific matters. The judge cited California Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.300(a) and the case of Bockrath (1999) 21 C4th 71, 84, which hold that an interrogatory is not objectionable because an answer to it involves an opinion or contention that relates to fact or the application of law to fact.

The judge also noted that the defendant's objections to the special interrogatories were proper, as they required answers to matter on which expert testimony would be required at trial. The judge warned the parties' counsel that failure to comply with the rules of court in the future may result in matters being continued, papers not being considered, or the imposition of sanctions.
