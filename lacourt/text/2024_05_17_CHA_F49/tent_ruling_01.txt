  Case Number:  23CHCP00486    Hearing Date:   May 17, 2024    Dept:  F49    Dept.    F49      Date:    5/17/24     Case    Name: State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company v. Jeffrey Anthony     Case    # 23CHCP00486      LOS  ANGELES SUPERIOR COURT NORTH  VALLEY DISTRICT DEPARTMENT  F49    MAY 17, 2024    MOTION TO COMPEL RESPONSES TO FORM  INTERROGATORIES, SET ONE  Los Angeles Superior Court Case # 23CHCP00486    Motion  filed: 12/19/23   MOVING PARTY: Petitioner State Farm Automobile  Insurance Company (“State Farm” or “Petitioner”) RESPONDING PARTY: None NOTICE: OK   RELIEF  REQUESTED: An  order from this Court to compel Respondent Jeffrey Anthony’s verified responses  to Petitioner’s Form Interrogatories, Set One.    TENTATIVE  RULING: The  motion is GRANTED.   BACKGROUND   On December 13, 2023, State Farm filed a Petition to Open  Unlimited Civil Court File to Establish Jurisdiction over  Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist Arbitration Matters (the “Petition”). The  purpose of the Petition is to have this Court exercise jurisdiction over  discovery matters with Respondent, in accordance with Insurance Code section  11580.2(f). (Pet. ¶ 6.)   On December 14, 2023, State Farm filed its Proof of  Service, establishing that papers were served upon Respondent’s counsel by mail  on the same day.   On December 19, 2023, State Farm filed the instant Motion to Compel  responses to its Form Interrogatories, Set One.    No opposition has been received by the Court.    ANALYSIS   If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to  serve a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order compelling  responses and for a monetary sanction.  (Code Civ. Proc., §  2030.290(b).)  The statute contains no time limit for a motion to compel  where no responses have been served.  All that needs to be shown in the  moving papers is that a set of interrogatories was properly served on the  opposing party, that the time to respond has expired, and that no response of  any kind has been served.  (Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111  Cal.App.3d 902, 905-06.)    A.     Motion to  Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One   Petitioner’s counsel attests that on February 2, 2023,  State Farm served Respondent with the first set of Form Interrogatories,  Special Interrogatories, and Demand for Inspection and Production of Documents.  (Grant Decl., ¶ 4, Ex. “B.”) Subsequently, State Farm granted an extension of  the deadline to respond from March 8 to March 31, 2023. (Id., ¶ 5, Ex.  “C.”) Petitioner further presents that a second extension was granted by it on  May 2, 2023, moving Respondent’s deadline to respond to June 1, 2023. (Id.,  ¶ 7, Ex. “E.”) Furthermore, two additional extensions were provided by State  Farm, extending the deadlines to June 23, and November 3, 2023, respectively. (Id.,  ¶¶ 8-9.) Despite these efforts by Petitioner and indications from Respondent of  intent to meet the deadlines, no responses were received by Petitioner at the  filing of the instant Motion. (Id., ¶ 11.)     Given the absence of any opposition from the Respondent and  the records above, the Court finds that Respondent has failed to serve a timely  response, thereby waiving any objection to the interrogatories, including those  based on privilege or the protection for work product, pursuant to Code of  Civil Procedure section 2030.290, subdivision (a).     Therefore, the Court GRANTS the Motion to Compel  Respondent’s Responses to Petitioner’s Form Interrogatories, Set One.   CONCLUSION   Petitioner’s Motion to Compel Respondent’s Responses to Form  Interrogatories, Set One, is GRANTED.   Respondent Jeffrey Anthony is ordered to serve verified  responses without objections to Petitioner’s Form Interrogatories, Set One,  within 20 days.   Moving  party is ordered to give notice
