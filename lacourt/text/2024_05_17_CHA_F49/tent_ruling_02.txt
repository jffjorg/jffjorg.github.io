 Case Number:  23CHCV03144    Hearing Date:   May 17, 2024    Dept:  F49 Dept. F49  Date: 5/17/24 Case  Name: BMO Bank  N.A.  v. Medina Truck &  Transportation;  Salvador Medina;  and Does 1-20 Case #23CHCV03144   LOS ANGELES SUPERIOR COURT NORTH VALLEY DISTRICT DEPARTMENT F49    MAY 17, 2024    MOTION TO QUASH SERVICE OF SUMMONS  AND COMPLAINT  Los Angeles Superior  Court Case # 23CHCV03144    Motion  filed: 12/13/23   MOVING PARTY: Defendant Medina Truck & Transport  (“MT&T” or the “Moving Defendant”) RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff BMO Bank, N.A. (“Plaintiff”)  NOTICE: OK    RELIEF  REQUESTED: An  order to quash the service of summons and complaint upon Defendant MT&T.   TENTATIVE  RULING: The  motion is DENIED.   BACKGROUND   This action arises from an alleged breach of contract.    On October 18, 2023, Plaintiff initiated the action against  Defendants MT&T, Salvador Medina (collectively, “Defendants”), and Does  1-20. The Complaint alleges: (1) Breach of Written Agreement; (2) Breach of  Continuing Guaranty; (3) Claim and Delivery; and (4) Conversion.   On October 23, 2023, Plaintiff filed two applications for writ of possession  against Defendants MT&T and Salvador Medina, respectively.   On November 20, 2023, Plaintiff filed two separate  documents of Proof of Substituted Service, demonstrating substituted service of  the summons, complaint, applications for writ of possession, and supporting  documents on Defendants by leaving the papers with Christina Medina,  co-occupant, on October 30, 2023, and mailing a copy of papers to Defendants on  November 3, 2023.    On December 13, 2023, MT&T filed the instant Motion to  Quash Summons and Complaint (the “Motion”). Subsequently, on December 20, 2023,  Plaintiff filed an Amended Proof of Substituted Service as to Defendant  MT&T.   On May 1, 2023, Plaintiff filed its Opposition to the  Motion.               No  replying papers have been received by the Court.   ANALYSIS   “A defendant, on or before the last day or his or her time  to plead or within any further time that the court may for good cause allow,  may serve and file a notice of motion. . . (1) To quash service of summons on  the ground of lack of jurisdiction of the court over him or her. . .” (Code  Civ. Proc., § 418.10.)    “A motion to quash service of summons lies on the ground  that the court lacks personal, not subject matter, jurisdiction over the moving  party.” (Greener v. Workers’ Comp. Appeals Bd. (1993) 6 Cal.4th 1028,  1036.)                 “When  a defendant challenges the court’s personal jurisdiction on the ground of  improper service of process, ‘the burden is on the plaintiff to prove the  existence of jurisdiction by proving, inter alia, the facts requisite to an  effective service.’” (Summers v. McClanahan (2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 403,  413.)   Filing proof of service that complies  with the applicable statutory requirements creates a rebuttable presumption of  proper service. (Floveyor Internat., Ltd. v. Superior Court (1997) 59  Cal.App.4th 789, 795.)   The reliability of a service declaration  from a registered process server is set by statute. The return of a process  server registered pursuant to Chapter 16 (commencing with §22350) of Division 8  of the Business and Professions Code upon process or notice establishes a  presumption, affecting the burden of producing evidence, of the facts stated in  the return. (Evid. Code § 647.)             A.     Request for  Judicial Notice   Plaintiff requests the Court to take judicial notice of the  following records pursuant to authorities under Evidence Code §§ 451(a), 452(c), (d)(2) and (h),  and 453, and case law interpreting the same, including  but not limited to Yvanova v. New Century Mortgage Corp., (2016) 62  Cal.4th 919, 924, fn. 1, Poseidon Development, Inc. v. Woodland Lane  Estates, LLC, (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 1106, 1116-1118, Fontenot v. Wells  Fargo Bank, N.A., (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 256, 264-265 (disapproved on  other grounds by Yvanova, 62 Cal.4th at 939, fn. 13) and Scott v.  JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., (2013) 214 Cal.App.4th 743, 752-754.   (1)   Proof  of Service of Summon – Substituted Service – filed in the present case on  November 20, 2023 (Pl.’s Request for Judicial Notice, Ex. “1”)   (2)   Amended  Proof of Service of Summons – Substituted Service – filed in the present case  on December 20, 2023 (Pl.’s Request for Judicial Notice, Ex. “2”)   (3)   Statement  of Information Corporation published by the State of California Office of the Secretary  of State, filed by MT&T on August 4, 2023 (Pl.’s Request for Judicial  Notice, Ex. “3”)   The Court GRANTS the Request for Judicial Notice.    B.      Motion to  Quash Service of Summons and Complaint   The Moving Defendant,  MT&T, argues that Plaintiff failed to serve its registered agent for  service of process, as the Proof of Service filed by Plaintiff indicates the  substituted service was made on “Christian Medina -Cooccupant,” and does not adhere  to the requirements outlined in Code of Civil Procedure section 415.20  subdivision (a), notably omitting the checking of two boxes intended to  signifying compliance (Mot., at p. 4-5.)   In response, Plaintiff contends  that MT&T registers its principal business address as the same as the home  address of its registered agent for service of process, arguing that  substituted service at the residence of its registered agent is sufficient and  effective. (Opp’n., at p. 2.)               To address these contentions, the  Court examines whether Plaintiff’s service complies with statutory procedures  for service of process on a corporation.    1)      Service  of Process on MT&T   i.                     Correct Address for Service   A corporation, like MT&T, may be served by  personally delivering a summons and complaint to its registered agent,  corporate officers, managers, and employees identified in Code of Civil  Procedure section 416.10.    Additionally, Code of Civil Procedure section 415.20  authorizes substituted service on a corporation, by leaving a copy of the  summons and complaint with someone other than the individual identified in Code  of Civil Procedure section 416.10, at the individual’s physical address or  usual mailing address, and then mailing a copy to the person at the same  address where the summons and complaint were left. (Code Civ. Proc., § 415.20,  subd. (a).)               Here, it is uncontradicted that MT&T’s  principal business address and mailing address are the same: 14661 Chatsworth  Dr. Mission Hills, California 91345 (the “Chatsworth Dr. Address”). (12/20/23  Amended Proof of Service, at p. 4, Pl.’s Request for Judicial Notice, Ex. “3.”)  Moreover, the contact address for MT&T’s registered agent for service of  process, Salvador Medina, is the same Chatsworth Dr. Address as listed in  MT&T’s Statement of Information. (Ibid.) Furthermore, MT&T’s  Statement of Information indicates that its registered agent, Salvador Medina,  is also the Officer and Director of MT&T (Pl.’s Request for Judicial  Notice, Ex. “3.”)               Consequently, the Court finds that Salvador  Medina qualifies as an individual identified under Code of Civil Procedure  section 416.10, and the Chatsworth Dr. Address is the correct address for substituted  service.    ii.                   Substantial Compliance with the Statutory Requirements   It is  axiomatic that strict compliance with the code's provisions  for service of process is not required. (Pasadena Medi–Center Associates  v. Superior Court (1973) 9 Cal.3d 773, 778 (Pasadena Medi-Center);  Dill v. Berquist Construction Co., (1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 1441,1436 (Dill); Espindola v. Nunez (1988) 199 Cal.App.3d 1389, 1391.)  The service of process statutes should be “liberally  construed to effectuate service and uphold the jurisdiction of the court  if actual notice has been received by the defendant.” (Pasadena Medi-Center,  supra, at p. 778.) “The liberal construction  rule, it is anticipated, will eliminate unnecessary, time-consuming, and costly  disputes over legal technicalities, without prejudicing the right of defendants  to proper notice of court proceedings.” (Ibid.) “Thus,  substantial compliance is sufficient.” (Dill, supra, at p.  1437.)   “[A] finding of substantial compliance can only be  sustained where (1) the record shows partial or colorable compliance  with the requirement on which the objection is predicated; (2) the service  relied upon by the plaintiff imparted actual notice to the defendant that the  suit was pending and that he was bound to defend; and (3) the manner and  objective circumstances of service were such as to make it highly likely that  it would impart such notice.” (Carol Gilbert, Inc. v. Haller  (2009) 179 Cal.App.4th 852, 855, 101 (Haller).)   Here,  Plaintiff’s process server declares that “on 10/30/2023 at (time): 7:58 AM I  left the documents listed in item 2 with or in the presence of ... CHRISTINA  MEDINA – CO OCCUPANT.” (12/20/23 Amended Proof of Service, ¶ 5.b.) It is  further stated that “[Christina Medina is] a competent member of the household  (at least 18 years of age) at the dwelling house or usual place of abode of the  party. I informed him or her of the general nature of the papers. (Address  designated by defendant as business address. Please see attached.)” (Id.,  ¶ b.(2).) (Underlines added.) Additionally, Plaintiff’s Proof of Service by  Mail demonstrates that a copy of documents was mailed to MT&T’s registered  agent on November 3, 2023, meeting the requirement under Code of Civil  Procedure section 415.20.   The Court determines  that the service of process is valid as it substantially complies with the  statutory requirements, drawing on the criteria outlined in the Haller  case.   Firstly, the  Proof of Service identifies a specific individual, Christina Medina, for substituted  service purposes. Additionally, although the process server marked the box for  home address, the declaration explicitly indicates that the designated home address  is also the business address. The Moving Defendant does not contest the  identity or competence of Christina Medina. Rather, its objection to the  service’s validity is predicated on the absence of a checked box, which should  indicate the address as a business address.   Secondly, the  case record indicates that both Defendants have filed objections to the  pleading, including the instant Motion filed by MT&T and a demurrer filed  by individual Defendant Salvador Medina, demonstrating that they have had  actual notice of the pending suit and that they are bound to defend.    Thirdly, given  the objective circumstances that MT&T’s registered business address is also  its agent’s home address, it is highly likely that the manner of the  substituted service on an identified co-occupant of the address effectively imparts  actual notice to MT&T.   Consequently,  the Court concludes that MT&T’s argument, centered on an unchecked box on  the Proof of Service, fails to sufficiently rebut the presumption of valid  service established by the registered process server’s declaration.   Based on the  foregoing, the Court DENIES the Motion to Quash Service of Summons and  Complaint.    CONCLUSION   Defendant  Medina Truck & Transport’s Motion to Quash  Service of Summons and Complaint is hereby DENIED.   Moving  party is ordered to give notice of this order.  _________________________________________________________________________________________________________     Dept.

(“BMO Bank” or  “Plaintiff”) RESPONDING PARTY: None NOTICE: OK    RELIEF  REQUESTED: An  order granting Plaintiff’s application for writ of possession against Defendant  Salvador Medina.    TENTATIVE  RULING: The hearing  on the application is CONTINUED.   BACKGROUND   This action arises from an alleged breach of contract.  Plaintiff BMO Bank seeks a writ of possession against Defendants Medina Truck  & Transportation, Inc. (“MT&T”) and personal guarantor Salvador Medina  (“Medina”) (collectively, “Defendants”) for one 2023 Peterbilt tractor.    On October 18, 2023, Plaintiff initiated the action against  Defendants, and Does 1-20. The Complaint alleges: (1) Breach of Written  Agreement; (2) Breach of Continuing Guaranty; (3) Claim and Delivery; and (4)  Conversion.   On October 23, 2023, Plaintiff filed the instant Application for Writ  of Possession against Defendant Medina (the “Application”), and a separate  Application for Writ of Possession against MT&T.     On November 20, 2023, Plaintiff filed two separate  documents of Proof of Substituted Service, demonstrating substituted service of  the summons, complaint, applications for writ of possession, and supporting  documents on Defendants by leaving the papers with Christina Medina,  co-occupant, on October 30, 2023, and mailing a copy of papers to Defendants on  November 3, 2023.    On December 13, 2023, MT&T filed its Motion to Quash  Summons and Complaint. Subsequently, on December 20, 2023, Plaintiff filed an  Amended Proof of Substituted Service as to Defendant MT&T.               On  December 26, 2023, Defendant Medina filed his Demurrer to the Complaint.    No Oppositions to the Application for Writ of Possession have  been received by the Court.    ANALYSIS   “Upon the filing of the complaint or at any time  thereafter, the plaintiff may apply pursuant to this chapter for a writ of  possession by filing a written application for the writ with the court in which  the action is brought.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 512.010, subd. (a).)    Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 512.010(b), the  application must be submitted under oath and include:    (1) A  showing of the basis of the plaintiff's claim and that the plaintiff is  entitled to possession of the property claimed. If the basis of the plaintiff's  claim is a written instrument, a copy of the instrument shall be attached.    (2) A  showing that the property is wrongfully detained by the defendant, of the  manner in which the defendant came into possession of the property, and,  according to the best knowledge, information, and belief of the plaintiff, of  the reason for the detention.    (3) A  particular description of the property and a statement of its value.    (4) A statement,  according to the best knowledge, information, and belief of the plaintiff, of  the location of the property and, if the property, or some part of it, is  within a private place which may have to be entered to take possession, a  showing that there is probable cause to believe that such property is located  there.    (5) A  statement that the property has not been taken for a tax, assessment, or fine,  pursuant to a statute; or seized under an execution against the property of the  plaintiff; or, if so seized, that it is by statute exempt from such seizure.    Before the hearing on the  Writ of Possession, the Defendant must be served with (1) a copy of the summons  and complaint; (2) a Notice of Application and Hearing; and (3) a copy of the application  and any affidavit in support thereof.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 512.030.) If the defendant has not appeared in the action, the  writ and other papers must be served in the same manner as is acceptable for a  service of summons. (Id. § 512.030, subd. (b).)   “The writ will be issued if the court finds that the  plaintiff's claim is probably valid and the other requirements for issuing the  writ are established.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 512.040, subd. (b).)  “A  claim has ‘probable validity’ where it is more likely than not that the  plaintiff will obtain a judgment against the defendant on that claim.”   (Code Civ. Proc., § 511.090.)      Prior to the issuance of a writ of possession, the  Plaintiff must file an undertaking “in an amount not less than twice the value  of the defendant's interest in the property or in a greater amount.”   (Code Civ. Proc., § 515.010, subd. (a).)      A.     Application  for Writ of Possession   The Court’s April 4, 2024 Minute Order states that despite  Medina’s lack of opposition to the instant Application, he has invoked the  choice of law provision in the Continuing Guaranty agreement through the filing  of his Demurrer to the Complaint on December 26, 2023. (2024/4/4 Minute Order.)   The establishment of the basis of Plaintiff’s claim is  necessary for issuing the writ under Code of Civil Procedure section 512.040,  subdivision (b). Therefore, as this determination relies on the analysis and  ruling on the Demurrer, the Court CONTINUES the hearing on the instant  Application to May 30, 2024, to be heard concurrently with the Demurrer.    CONCLUSION   The Application  for Writ of Possession and a turnover order against Salvador Medina is  CONTINUED to May 30, 2024.   Moving party is ordered to give notice________________________________________________________________________________________________   Dept.

(“BMO Bank” or  “Plaintiff”) RESPONDING PARTY: None NOTICE: OK     RELIEF  REQUESTED: An  order granting Plaintiff’s application for writ of possession against Defendant  Medina Truck and Transport, Inc.    TENTATIVE  RULING: The  motion is GRANTED.   BACKGROUND   This action arises from an alleged breach of contract.  Plaintiff BMO Bank seeks a writ of possession against Defendants Medina Truck  & Transportation, Inc. (“MT&T”) and personal guarantor Salvador Medina  (“Medina”) (collectively, “Defendants”) for one 2023 Peterbilt tractor.    On October 18, 2023, Plaintiff initiated the action against  Defendants, and Does 1-20. The Complaint alleges: (1) Breach of Written  Agreement; (2) Breach of Continuing Guaranty; (3) Claim and Delivery; and (4)  Conversion.   On October 23, 2023, Plaintiff filed the instant Application for Writ  of Possession against Defendant MT&T (the “Application”), and a separate  Application for Writ of Possession against Medina.   On November 20, 2023, Plaintiff filed two separate  documents of Proof of Substituted Service, demonstrating substituted service of  the summons, complaint, applications for writ of possession, and supporting  documents on Defendants by leaving the papers with Christina Medina,  co-occupant, on October 30, 2023, and mailing a copy of papers to Defendants on  November 3, 2023.    On December 13, 2023, MT&T filed its Motion to Quash  Summons and Complaint. Subsequently, on December 20, 2023, Plaintiff filed an  Amended Proof of Substituted Service as to Defendant MT&T.               On  December 26, 2023, Defendant Medina filed his Demurrer to the Complaint.    No Opposition to the Application has been received by the  Court.    ANALYSIS   “Upon the filing of the complaint or at any time  thereafter, the plaintiff may apply pursuant to this chapter for a writ of  possession by filing a written application for the writ with the court in which  the action is brought.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 512.010, subd.

If the basis of the plaintiff's  claim is a written instrument, a copy of the instrument shall be attached.    (2) A  showing that the property is wrongfully detained by the defendant, of the  manner in which the defendant came into possession of the property, and,  according to the best knowledge, information, and belief of the plaintiff, of  the reason for the detention.    (3) A  particular description of the property and a statement of its value.    (4) A  statement, according to the best knowledge, information, and belief of the  plaintiff, of the location of the property and, if the property, or some part  of it, is within a private place which may have to be entered to take  possession, a showing that there is probable cause to believe that such  property is located there.    (5) A  statement that the property has not been taken for a tax, assessment, or fine,  pursuant to a statute; or seized under an execution against the property of the  plaintiff; or, if so seized, that it is by statute exempt from such seizure.    Before the hearing on the  Writ of Possession, the Defendant must be served with (1) a copy of the summons  and complaint; (2) a Notice of Application and Hearing; and (3) a copy of the  application and any affidavit in support thereof.  (Code Civ. Proc., §  512.030.) If the defendant has not appeared  in the action, the writ and other papers must be served in the same manner as  is acceptable for a service of summons. (Code Civ. Proc.. § 512.030,  subd. (b).)   “The writ will be issued if the court finds that the  plaintiff's claim is probably valid and the other requirements for issuing the  writ are established.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 512.040, subd. (b).)  “A  claim has ‘probable validity’ where it is more likely than not that the  plaintiff will obtain a judgment against the defendant on that claim.”   (Code Civ. Proc., § 511.090.)      Prior to the issuance of a writ of possession, the  Plaintiff must file an undertaking “in an amount not less than twice the value  of the defendant's interest in the property or in a greater amount.”   (Code Civ. Proc., § 515.010, subd. (a).)      A.     Notice   As a preliminary issue,  Plaintiff must demonstrate that the Court has jurisdiction over Defendant  MT&T in this case. Records indicate that MT&T filed a Motion to Quash  Service on December 13, 2023, challenging that service was not properly effected  upon defendant MT&T.   “[O]nce a defendant files a  motion to quash the burden is on the plaintiff to prove by a preponderance of  the evidence the validity of the service and the court’s jurisdiction over the  defendant.” (Bolkiah v. Superior Court of L.A. County (1999) 74  Cal.App.4th 984, 991.)   Here, in response to  Defendants’ Motion to Quash, Plaintiff submitted an Amended Proof of Service on  December 20, 2023. This document explicitly states that the substituted service  was made to MT&T’s registered agent for service at the address located at  14661 Chatsworth Dr., Mission Hills, CA 91345 (2023/12/20 Proof of Service). This  address matches Defendant MT&T’s principal business address and mailing  address (Id. at p. 4.)   As analyzed in detail in the  Court’s separate ruling on the Motion to Quash, the Court has concluded that  Plaintiff’s service of process, including the Application, is effective and  valid.   Consequently, the Court determines  that the notice requirements under Code of Civil Procedure section 512.030 have been satisfied.    B.      Basis of  Plaintiff’s Claim   Plaintiff submits evidence  that on January 24, 2023, Defendant MT&T and BMO Bank entered into a loan  and security agreement to obtain a loan for one 2023 Peterbilt tractor at issue.  (Schrepel Decl. ¶ 6, Ex. “1.”) Schrepel demonstrates sufficient personal  knowledge of BMO Bank’s records as a custodian of these records. (Id. ¶  1.) Here, Plaintiff presents copies of Loan and Security Agreement and the  Continuing Guaranty, as exhibits to the declaration. (Id. Ex. “1.”)               Schrepel asserts  that Defendants have defaulted under the terms of the agreements, with the accelerated  balances now including a principal of $222,511.88 (Schrepel Decl. ¶ 12), unpaid  interest of $4,693.92 based on non-default rate of 8.63% per annum through the  date of acceleration on June 29, 2023 (Id. ¶ 14), and interest continue  to accrue at the default rate of 18% per annum until the date of judgment. (Id.  ¶ 15.) Pursuant to the terms of the Loan and Security Agreement, Plaintiff is  entitled to immediate possession of the equipment described therein. (Id.  ¶ 18.)               Defendant MT&T does not oppose  the instant Application. The only objection to the pleading from MT&T is  its Motion to Quash Service of Summons and Complaint (the “Motion”). The Court  has rendered a separate ruling denying its Motion. As a result, Plaintiff’s  factual allegations are uncontested and uncontradicted.               Based on  the above records, the Court concludes that Plaintiff has sufficiently  demonstrated the basis of its claim.   C.     Wrongful  Detention   In accordance with Code of Civil  Procedure section 512.010(b)(2), the Application must include “a showing that  the property is wrongfully detained by the defendant, of the manner in which  the defendant came into possession of the property, and, according to the best  knowledge, information, and belief of the plaintiff, of the reason for the  detention.”   Plaintiff presents that MT&T  breached the terms of the Loan and Security Agreement on April 1, 2023, by  failing to make monthly loan payments. (Schrepel Decl. ¶ 10.) Additionally,  MT&T has failed and continues to fail to make any subsequent payments. (Ibid.)  Under the terms of the Loan and Security Agreement and Continuing Guaranty,  Plaintiff has the right to repossess the equipment in the event of default.  (Schrepel Decl. ¶ 19, Ex. “1.”) Plaintiff asserts that Defendant MT&T  wrongfully detained the equipment after defaulting on the agreement. (Id.  ¶ 20.)   Consequently, the Court finds  that Plaintiff has met its burden in establishing MT&T’s wrongful  detention.   D.     Description  and Value of Property   Pursuant to Code of Civil  Procedure section 512.010, subdivision (b)(3), the Application must include a  particular description of the property and a statement of its value.   Plaintiff has fulfilled this  requirement by providing an explicit description of the equipment, including  its make, model, model year, and VIN number, along with its value. (Schrepel  Decl. ¶¶ 6, 29).    Consequently, Plaintiff adheres  to the mandates of Code of Civil Procedure section 512.010 subdivision (b)(3).   E.      Statutory  Statements   Pursuant to Code of Civil  Procedure section 512.010 subdivisions (b)(4) and (5), the application must  include:    “(4) A statement, according to  the best knowledge, information, and belief of the plaintiff, of the location  of the property and, if the property, or some part of it, is within a private  place which may have to be entered to take possession, a showing that there is  probable cause to believe that such property is located there.   (5) A statement that the property  has not been taken for a tax, assessment, or fine, pursuant to a statute; or  seized under an execution against the property of the plaintiff; or, if so  seized, that it is by statute exempt from such seizure.”   Here,  Plaintiff has provided a statement that the equipment has not been taken for a  tax, assessment, or fine, pursuant to statute and has not been seized under an  execution against the Plaintiff’s property. (Schrepel Decl. ¶ 25.)   Furthermore,  Plaintiff states that “Plaintiff is informed and believes that the COLLATERAL  is currently located at: a. 12000 Paxton St., Sylmar, CA 91342; b. 14661  Chatsworth Dr., Mission Hills, CA 91345; or Such other location known to  Defendants.” (Id. ¶ 22.)    Notably,  records indicate that the address at 14661 Chatsworth Dr. serves as both the  principal business address of MT&T and the residential address of Defendant  Medina. (12/20/23 Proof of Service.) Consequently, the Court finds that the  objective circumstances support the probable cause of the current location of  the equipment.    Therefore,  the requirements for statutory statements are satisfied.   F.      Undertaking   According to Code of Civil  Procedure section 515.010, an undertaking must be filed before the writ issues  in the amount of “not less than twice the value of the defendant’s interest in  the property.”  However, if “the court  finds that the defendant has no interest in the property, the court “shall  waive the requirement of ... undertaking[.]” (Code Civ. Proc., § 515.010, subd.  (b).)    Here, Plaintiff provides evidence  showing that the amount owing on the equipment surpasses its market value, indicating  that Defendants possess no equity in the equipment. (Schrepel Decl. ¶¶ 29, 30.)     Accordingly, based on this  specific circumstance, the requirement for undertaking should be waived  pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 515.010 subdivision (b).   Based on the foregoing, the Court  GRANTS the Application for Writ of Possession against Defendant MT&T.   G.    Turn  Over Order   Plaintiff also seeks an  order directing the Defendants to turn over the equipment to Plaintiff,  pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 512.070. (Mem. at p. 7.) Additionally,  Plaintiff’s Notice of Application on Form CD-110 gave notice that the court may  issue a turnover order.    Code of Civil Procedure  section 512.070 provides, “If a writ of possession is issued, the court may also issue  an order directing the defendant to transfer possession of the property to the  plaintiff. Such order shall contain a notice to the defendant that failure to  turn over possession of such property to plaintiff may subject the defendant to  being held in contempt of court.”               Given that  the requirements for issuance of the writ of possession are satisfied as to  MT&T, the Court GRANTS the request to issue a turnover order as to  MT&T.    CONCLUSION   The Application  for Writ of Possession and a Turnover Order against Medina Truck and Transport,  Inc. is GRANTED.   Moving  party is ordered to give notice.
