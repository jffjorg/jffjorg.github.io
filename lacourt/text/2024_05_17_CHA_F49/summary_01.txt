The Petitioner, State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company, served the Respondent, Jeffrey Anthony, with Form Interrogatories on February 2, 2023. Despite multiple extensions granted by the Petitioner, no response was received from the Respondent.

The Court orders the Respondent to serve verified responses to the Form Interrogatories within 20 days.
