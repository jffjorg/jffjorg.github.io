And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling sustaining the demurrer filed by the defendants (Anschutz Entertainment Group and LA Arena Company, LLC) to the second amended complaint filed by the plaintiff (Lawrence Harris). The plaintiff did not oppose the motion, and the judge found that the second amended complaint fails to state a legally cognizable cause of action. The complaint alleges that the defendants' failure to require basketball players to wear eye protection is harassment against the plaintiff, but the judge found that this is confusing and does not support a legally cognizable cause of action. The judge granted the demurrer without leave to amend, meaning that the plaintiff cannot refile the complaint or make further changes to it.
