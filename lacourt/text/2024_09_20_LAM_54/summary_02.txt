```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Cross-Defendants' motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication of the cross-complaint. The court found that there is a triable issue of fact as to whether Cross-Defendants breached the standard of care in their treatment of Cross-Complainant. Cross-Defendants' own evidence is contradictory and shows both that they believed Cross-Complainant was not fit to drive and that they believed she was fit to drive. Additionally, the court found that Cross-Complainant presented an opposing expert opinion in opposition to Cross-Defendants' motion for summary judgment of Plaintiff's complaint. The judge's ruling means that the case will proceed to trial, rather than being decided based on summary judgment.
