And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants in part the plaintiff's motion to continue the trial date and all related dates. The current trial date of April 23, 2024 and the Final Status Conference for April 9, 2024 are advanced and vacated. The judge will set new trial and Final Status Conference dates at the hearing on this motion. The plaintiff is ordered to give notice of the court's ruling within five calendar days of this order. The judge's decision is based on the parties' arguments and the facts of the case. The plaintiff seeks a continuance to allow for further discovery and preparation, while the defendants argue that the motion is untimely and that the plaintiff has not clarified how she intends to address outstanding depositions and discovery. The judge finds that there is good cause to continue the trial, but agrees with the defendants that a shorter continuance would be more appropriate.
