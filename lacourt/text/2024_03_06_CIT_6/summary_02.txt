And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on Defendant Cardenas Markets LLC's motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication. The Court denies the motion for summary judgment but grants the motion for summary adjudication as to the Second and Third Causes of Action.

The Court found that Cardenas did not own or control the property where the accident occurred and did not create a hazardous condition that led to the accident. The Court also found that Plaintiffs failed to establish the existence of a triable issue of material fact.

The Court ordered Cardenas to give notice of the Court's ruling within five calendar days of this order.
