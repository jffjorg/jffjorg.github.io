And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The Court DENIES the motion for refund of moneys paid by Defendants to Plaintiffs in the amount of $75,836.88. The Court finds that the motion is untimely and that the judgment entered on February 20, 2024, cannot be changed. The Court also finds that specific performance does not put the parties back in the same positions and that Plaintiffs are entitled to accounting and damages. The Court rejects the Defendants' argument that the Plaintiffs cannot obtain both specific performance and damages for breach of contract. The Court also refuses to vacate the Court's order regarding expenses to be paid by Hardika in accordance with the specific performance decree.
