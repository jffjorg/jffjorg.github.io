Summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Dipu Haque, et al. v. Michael Ball, et al. The judge has granted the Plaintiffs' Motion for Terminating Sanctions, striking Defendant's Answer for unexcused failure to comply with a Court order compelling discovery, including his failure to appear for and attend his deposition as ordered July 5, 2023. The judge has also denied the Plaintiffs' Motion for Order of Contempt, but without prejudice to being renewed depending on future developments.

The judge has awarded monetary sanctions to Plaintiffs in the amount of $1,913.77, which includes $1,500.00 in sanctions ordered by the Court on July 5, 2023, and $413.77 in additional sanctions for Defendant's misuse of the discovery process. The judge has also reduced the hours claimed by Plaintiffs' counsel for the contempt proceeding from 5 hours to 3 hours and awarded an additional $511.65 in sanctions.

The judge has noted that Defendant claimed he lacks the financial ability to pay the monetary sanctions, and has taken this into consideration in reaching its decision. The judge has also granted a "doomsday" discovery sanction by striking Defendant's Answer.

  Case Number: 21TRCV00625
  Hearing Date: September 21, 2023
  Case Name: Dipu Haque, et al v. Michael Ball, et al.
  Moving Party: Plaintiffs, Dipu Haque, et al.
  Responding Party: None
  Trial Date: February 13, 2024
  Motion: (1) Motion for Terminating Sanctions, (2) Motion for Order of Contempt

  - The court grants the motion for terminating sanctions and strikes defendant's answer for failure to comply with a court order compelling discovery.
  - The court denies the motion for order of contempt but without prejudice to being renewed depending on future developments.

  Background:
  - This case involves a self-represented defendant, Michael Ball, who was appointed manager of plaintiffs' investments in various businesses.
  - Plaintiffs allege that defendant has breached his agreements with plaintiffs by refusing to grant them access to all of the businesses' financial records.
  - Plaintiffs have sought discovery from defendant but he has failed to comply with court orders compelling further discovery.

  Analysis:
  - The court has the authority to impose monetary, issue, evidence, or terminating sanctions if a party fails to comply with a court order compelling discovery responses.
  - The court finds that defendant has abused the discovery process and disobeyed a court order to provide discovery, which warrants a terminating sanction in the form of striking defendant's answer to the complaint and his answer to the first amended complaint.
  - Plaintiffs are entitled to monetary sanctions for defendant's misuse of the discovery process in the amount of $1,913.77.

  - Plaintiffs move for an order finding defendant in contempt for disobeying court orders by failing to participate in discovery and pay monetary sanctions.
  - Plaintiffs request the imposition of a fine of $1,000 on defendant payable to the court or imprisonment of five days for his contempt of court or both.
  - Plaintiffs also request the imposition of monetary sanctions totaling $811.65 to reimburse plaintiffs' attorney fees and costs incurred in pursuing the motion.
  - The court finds that plaintiffs are entitled to an award of additional sanctions for fees and costs incurred with the contempt proceeding.
  - The court awards additional monetary sanctions in the amount of $511.65.
  - The court does not find defendant in contempt and will not impose a fine or jail for his failure to pay money that he may have an inability to pay, but without prejudice to a later contempt motion depending on future developments.
