Summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Dipu Haque, et al. v. Michael Ball, et al. The judge has granted the Plaintiffs' Motion for Terminating Sanctions, striking Defendant's Answer for unexcused failure to comply with a Court order compelling discovery, including his failure to appear for and attend his deposition as ordered July 5, 2023. The judge has also denied the Plaintiffs' Motion for Order of Contempt, but without prejudice to being renewed depending on future developments.

The judge has awarded monetary sanctions to Plaintiffs in the amount of $1,913.77, which includes $1,500.00 in sanctions ordered by the Court on July 5, 2023, and $413.77 in additional sanctions for Defendant's misuse of the discovery process. The judge has also reduced the hours claimed by Plaintiffs' counsel for the contempt proceeding from 5 hours to 3 hours and awarded an additional $511.65 in sanctions.

The judge has noted that Defendant claimed he lacks the financial ability to pay the monetary sanctions, and has taken this into consideration in reaching its decision. The judge has also granted a "doomsday" discovery sanction by striking Defendant's Answer.
