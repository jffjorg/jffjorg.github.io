I. BACKGROUND¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿ 
A. Factual¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿ 
This action involves a
self-represented defendant, Michael Ball. Plaintiffs are investors in various
businesses established by Mr. Ball (“Defendant”) memorialized in written
contracts, wherein Defendant was appointed manager of plaintiffs’ investments.  In those contracts, Defendant granted Plaintiffs
unfettered access to the businesses’ financial records so that Plaintiffs could
monitor their investments at any time. Plaintiffs allege that since 2014, they
have invested approximately $20 million in the aforesaid business. However,
Plaintiffs argue that Defendant has breached his agreements with Plaintiffs by
refusing to grant them access to all of the businesses’ financial records and
by taking various steps causing Plaintiffs insecurity about the soundness of
their investments. 
 
B. Procedural¿¿¿ 
¿¿ 
Plaintiffs have sought discovery from Defendant about their
investments, the businesses, Defendant’s relationship with some of the invested
businesses, and otherwise.  The Court has
been faced with multiple discovery motions by Plaintiffs against Defendant, all
or nearly all of which have been granted. 
Defendant fails to provide any opposition to these motions.  The Court has issued multiple orders
compelling further discovery and ordering payment of monetary sanctions.  On August 9, 2023, after failing to receive
any of the monetary sanctions payment, and after Defendant failed to comply
with one or more orders compelling further discovery, Plaintiffs filed a Motion
for Terminating Sanctions. On August 25, 2023,
Plaintiffs filed a Motion for
Order of Contempt. To date, no
responses by Defendant to either pending motion have been filed. Defendant once
again did not file an opposition.

¿II. ANALYSIS¿¿ 
¿¿ 
A.   
Motion for
Terminating Sanctions
If a
party fails to comply with a court order compelling discovery responses or
attendance at a deposition, the court may impose monetary, issue, evidence, or
terminating sanctions. Code Civ. Proc. § 2025.450, subd. (h) (depositions); §
2030.290, subd. (c) (interrogatories); § 2031.300, subd. (c) (demands for
production of documents); § 2033.290, subd. (e) (requests for admission). Code
of Civil Procedure section 2023.030 provides that, “[t]o the extent authorized
by the chapter governing any particular discovery method . . . , the court,
after notice to any affected party, person, or attorney, and after opportunity
for hearing, may impose . . .¿ [monetary, issue, evidence, or terminating]
sanctions against anyone engaging in conduct that is a misuse of the discovery
process . . .” Section 2023.010 provides that “[m]isuses of the discovery
process include, but are not limited to, the following: . . . (d) Failing to
respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery. . . (g) Disobeying a
court order to provide discovery. . .”¿¿ 
“The
trial court may order a terminating sanction for discovery abuse ‘after
considering the totality of the circumstances: [the] conduct of the party to
determine if the actions were willful; the detriment to the propounding party;
and the number of formal and informal attempts to obtain the discovery.’” (Los
Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 377, 390, quoting Lang
v. Hochman (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246.) “Generally, ‘[a] decision to
order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly. But where a violation
is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less
severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the
trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.’” (Los
Defensores, supra, 223 Cal.App.4th at p. 390 [citation
omitted].)¿¿¿¿ 
“Under
this standard, trial courts have properly imposed terminating sanctions when
parties have willfully disobeyed one or more discovery orders.” (Id.,
citing Lang, supra, 77 Cal. App. 4th at pp. 1244-1246 [discussing
cases]; see, e.g., Collisson & Kaplan v. Hartunian (1994) 21
Cal.App.4th 1611, 1617-1622 [terminating sanctions imposed after defendants
failed to comply with one court order to produce discovery]; Laguna Auto
Body v. Farmers Ins. Exchange (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 481, 491, disapproved
on other grounds in Garcia v. McCutchen (1997) 16 Cal.4th 469, 478, n. 4
[terminating sanctions imposed against plaintiff for failing to comply with a
discovery order and for violating various discovery statutes].)¿¿ 
Plaintiffs request that the Court impose monetary sanctions in the
amount of $1,913.77 on Defendant Michael Ball. Plaintiffs assert that this
instant motion is triggered by Defendant’s refusal to appear for his
court-ordered deposition on August 7, 2023. Plaintiffs first noticed
Defendant’s deposition for August 22, 2022, however, he failed to appear.
Plaintiffs state that they did not seek an Order compelling his appearance
since Defendant was pro per, but rather re-noticed the deposition for June 5, 2023.
Upon Defendant’s steadfast refusal to appear, Plaintiffs sought and obtained an
Order that he do so. The Court’s Order, dated July 5, 2023, compelled Defendant
to submit to his deposition no later than August 7, 2023. (Kwong Decl., Exhib.
1.)  Thereafter, Plaintiffs served
Defendant with another notice for his deposition, to be conducted remotely via
Zoom on August 7, 2023. 
Defendant did not object or otherwise respond to the Notice. On
August 4, 2023, Plaintiffs’ counsel forwarded to Defendant the log-in
instructions for the deposition. (Kwong Decl., Exhib. 3.) On August 7, 2023,
Plaintiffs’ counsel and Veritext Court Reporter Jahmy Alvarez signed on to the
deposition at about 10:00 A.M. and waited for Defendant to appear. Not hearing
from Defendant, Plaintiffs emailed him a reminder. Defendant never responded.
At around 10:30 A.M., Plaintiffs recorded Defendant's non-appearance. (Kwong
Decl., Exhib. 2.)
Defendant has not filed an opposition. The Court finds that
Plaintiffs have sufficiently demonstrated that Defendant abused the discovery
process and is entitled to sanctions as he disobeyed a court order to provide
discovery, which was attendance at his deposition. Defendant’s continued
failure to attend the scheduled deposition warrants a terminating sanction in
the form of striking Defendant’s answer to the Complaint and his answer to the
First Amended Complaint.
The Court also finds that Plaintiffs are entitled to monetary
sanctions for Defendant’s misuse of the discovery process. Plaintiffs’ counsel
claims an hourly rate of $150 with 6 hours regarding this instant motion.
Plaintiffs also request Court Reporter’s fees in the amount of $952.12 and the
$61.65 filing fee with respect to the motion. The Court finds this reasonable
and awards $1,913.77 in additional monetary sanctions.
B.     Motion
for Order of Contempt 
Plaintiffs move
for an Order finding Defendant in contempt for disobeying six court orders by
failing to: (1) participate in discovery; and (2) pay monetary sanctions
totaling the cumulative total of $10,496.65. Plaintiffs further request the
imposition of a fine of $1,000 on Defendant payable to the Court or
imprisonment of five days for his contempt of court or both. Plaintiffs also request
the imposition of monetary sanctions totaling $ 811.65 to reimburse Plaintiffs’
attorney fees and costs incurred in pursuing the herein Motion.
To establish a prima facie case of contempt, it is
necessary to establish the following: (1) a lawful order of the court was made;
(2) the citee had knowledge of the order; (3) the citee had the ability to
comply with the order; and (4) the citee willfully disobeyed the order. (See
In re Liu (1969) 273 CA2d 135, 140-141; Board of Supervisors v. Superior
Court (1995) 33 CA4th 1724, 1736.)
 
Plaintiff must prepare the OSC, accompanied by an
affidavit, for the Court to review. (Code of Civ. Proc., § 1211, subd. (a) [“an
affidavit shall be presented to the court or judge of the facts constituting
the contempt”].) “A contempt proceeding is commenced by the filing of an
affidavit and a request for an order to show cause. [Citation.] After notice to
the opposing party’s lawyer, the court (if satisfied with the sufficiency of
the affidavit) must sign an order to show cause re contempt in which the date
and time for a hearing are set forth.” (Cedars-Sinai Imaging Medical Group
v. Superior Court (2000) 83 Cal.App.4th
1281, 1286.) The OSC acts as a summons to appear in court on a certain day and
to show cause why a contempt order should not be issued. (Ibid.) 
 
Here, Defendant was ordered to pay the fees and costs
regarding motion to compel responses to discovery. Defendant failed to oppose
any of those motions. (Kwong Decl. ¶¶ 1-7.) Plaintiffs’ counsel gave notice of
the court-ordered sanctions and emailed Defendant reminding him of his failure
to pay said sanctions. Defendant responded by claiming that he lacks funds to
pay the sanctions. The court order for December 1, 2022, stated that monetary
sanctions in the amount of $1,500.00 were to be paid within 30 days. (Id.,
Exhib. 1.) The court order for July 5, 2023 set a date of August 4, 2023 by
which sanctions in the amount of $1,500.00 were to be paid. (Kwong Decl.,
Exhib. 7.) However, the remaining court orders of 12/8/22, 1/5/23, 1/12/23,
4/25/23, and 6/15/23 did not set forth a date by which the fees and costs had
to be paid. As such, there is no evidence that Defendant willfully disobeyed the
following court orders: 12/8/22, 1/5/23, 1/12/23, 4/25/23, and 6/15/23 for
payment of monetary sanctions, so those orders do not provide a basis for civil
contempt. However, since the 12/1/22 and 7/5/23 court orders did provide a
deadline, Plaintiffs sufficiently show that Defendant willfully disobeyed those
orders. 
Pursuant to
Code of Civil Procedure 1218(a), the Court finds that Plaintiffs are entitled
to an award of additional sanctions for fees and costs incurred with the contempt
proceeding. Since Plaintiffs have sufficiently shown Defendant’s willful
disobedience of the court orders, the Court awards additional monetary sanctions.
Plaintiffs’ counsel claims an hourly rate of $150 and claims 5 hours with
respect to this motion. The Court reduces the hours to 3, and awards in the
amount of $511.65 ($150/hr x 3 hrs + $61.65 filing fee).
In
mitigation, the Court notes that Ms. Kwong’s declaration shows that Defendant
claimed he lacks the financial ability to pay the monetary sanctions.  Further, the Court is granting a “doomsday”
discovery sanction by striking Defendant’s Answer.  On this record, the Court does not find
Defendant in contempt and will not impose a fine or jail for his failure to pay
money that he may have an inability to pay, but without prejudice to a later
contempt motion depending on future developments if any in the case.
