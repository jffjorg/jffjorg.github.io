[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: 
PETITION TO WITHDRAW FUNDS FROM A
  BLOCKED ACCOUNT
 
Date: December 13, 2024
Time: 8:30 a.m.
Dept. 56
 
 



 
MOVING PARTY:  Plaintiff Gianna Melody Guzman (“Plaintiff”)
RESPONDING PARTY: None

 
            The Court has considered the moving
papers. No opposition was filed. 
 
DISCUSSION
             On November 15, 2024, Plaintiff filed an
amended petition (the “Petition”) seeking to withdraw the balance of $3,642.38
from a blocked account established on her behalf by her guardian ad litem during
her minority. Plaintiff turned 18 on October 21, 2024. 
 
            This Court’s  December 19, 2019 Order to Deposit Money into
Blocked Account states as follows: “When the minor attains the age of 18 years,
the depository, without further order of this Court, is authorized and directed
to pay by check or draft directly to the former minor, upon proper demand, all
moneys including interest deposited under this order.” (See 12/19/2019 Form MC-351
and 12/19/2019 Form MC-355.) 
 
            Accordingly, no Court order is
necessary for Plaintiff to withdraw the funds. 
 
            The Court nevertheless orders for
clarity that the depository is authorized and directed to pay by check or draft
directly to Gianna Melody Guzman, upon demand, all moneys including interest
deposited pursuant to the original order.
