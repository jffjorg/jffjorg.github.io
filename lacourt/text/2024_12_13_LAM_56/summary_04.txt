And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is in response to a petition filed by Gianna Melody Guzman, who seeks to withdraw $3,642.38 from a blocked account established by her guardian ad litem during her minority. The account was established in accordance with a December 19, 2019 court order, which stated that the funds would be paid to the minor upon demand once she turned 18. Since Gianna turned 18 on October 21, 2024, no court order is necessary for her to withdraw the funds. The judge orders that the depository is authorized to pay the funds to Gianna upon demand, and notes that the original order from 2019 remains in effect.
