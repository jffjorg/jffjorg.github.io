As for the summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted Plaintiff RankLogic's Motion for Protective Order. The Plaintiff seeks to protect its trade secrets, including a proprietary process to connect consumers with professionals, source code, and operational logic. The Court finds that there is good cause to adopt a protective order as the Plaintiff's trade secrets are sensitive information that should be subject to additional protection. The Defendant has not opposed the Motion. The Plaintiff is ordered to submit a proposed order within ten days of the date of this order in the form of the Los Angeles Superior Court's model Protective Order - Confidential Designation Only.
