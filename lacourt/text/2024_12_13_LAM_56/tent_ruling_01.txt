MOVING PARTY: Petitioner
J.G. Wentworth Originations, LLC (“Petitioner”) 
RESPONDING PARTY: None.

 
            The Court has considered the moving papers.
No opposition has been filed. 
 
BACKGROUND
             Petitioner has filed a petition for approval
of transfer of certain structured settlement payment rights (the “Petition”) belonging
to Real Party-in-Interest/Transferor Harvey Robertson (“Transferor”).
Specifically, Petitioner seeks the transfer of $94,560.00 in future annuity
payments belonging to Transferor which span payments to be paid between January
1, 2025 and July 1, 2035, the present discounted value of which is $74,356.25,
to be transferred in exchange for a $50,000.00 lump sum payment to Transferor. 
            
            The Petition was filed on September 23,
2024. On September 24, 2024, Petitioner filed a notice of hearing for December
13, 2024. 
 
The amended petition (the “Amended
Petition”) was filed on November 19, 2024 along with the Declaration of Payee
in Support of Petitioner’s Petition (the “Payee Decl.”) That same day, Petitioner
filed a proof of service via mail and email. The filing shows service of the
notice of hearing, verified Petition, notice of case assignment, declaration of
payee and proof of service on Transferor, the annuity issuer and the annuity
obligor. 
 
DISCUSSION
            A transfer of structured settlement payment rights is void unless a court
reviews and approves the transfer and finds that (a) the transfer of the
structured settlement payment rights is fair and reasonable and in the best
interest of the payee, taking into account the welfare and support of his or
her dependents, and (b) the transfer complies with the requirements of
Insurance Code (“Ins. Code”) sections 10134 to 10139.5, will not contravene
other applicable law, and that the court has reviewed and approved the transfer
as provided in Section 10139.5. (See Ins. Code, § 10137, subds. (a)-(b).)
 
Section 10136
Requirements
            No direct or indirect transfer of
structured settlement payment rights by a payee to which Section 10136 applies
shall be effective, and no structured settlement obligor or annuity issuer
shall be required to make any payment directly or indirectly to a transferee,
unless all of the provisions of Section 10136 of the Insurance Code are
satisfied. (Ins. Code, § 10136, subd. (a).)
 
            The petition satisfies the
requirements of Section 10136 as follows (Ins. Code, § 10136, subds. (b)-(e)): 
            
            First, the transfer agreement
satisfies the disclosure form requirements set out in Insurance Code section
10136, subdivision (b) because the transfer agreement is accompanied by a
disclosure addressed to Transferor and the disclosure contains all the statutorily
required language of section 10136, subdivision (b).) (Ins. Code, § 10136, subd. (b); Amended Petition, Ex. A, California
Purchase Contract, § 10.)
 
Second, the
transfer agreement satisfies the transfer-agreement requirements set out in
Insurance Code section 10136, subdivision (c) because the transfer agreement
contains all the necessary language required from this statutory subdivision.
(Ins. Code, § 10136, subd. (c); Amended Petition, Ex. A, California Purchase
Contract, §§ 2 [amount and due date of payment rights to be sold], 10
[remaining requirements].)
 
Third, the
transfer agreement does not violate Section 10138 as none of the contents
prohibited by this statutory section are contained in the transfer agreement.
(Ins. Code, § 10136, subd. (d); Amended Petition, Ex. A, California Purchase
Contract.)
 
Fourth, Transferor
has not sought cancellation of the transfer agreement as of the date of this
hearing. (Ins. Code, § 10136, subd. (e); Payee Decl., ¶ 13.)
 
Accordingly, the
Court finds that Petitioner’s proposed transfer of Transferor’s settlement
rights satisfies the requirements of Insurance Code section 10136, subdivisions
(a) through (e).
 
Section 10139.5
Requirements
A direct or indirect transfer of
structured settlement payment rights is not effective and a structured
settlement obligor or annuity issuer is not required to make any payment
directly or indirectly to any transferee of structured settlement payment rights
unless the transfer has been approved in advance in a final court order based
on express written findings by the court subject to Section 10139.5. (Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (a).)
 
            Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (a)
The petition
satisfies the entirety of the findings requirement set out in Insurance Code
section 10139.5, subdivisions (a)(1) to (a)(6). These findings, which the Court
expressly makes by the following language, are that: 
 
(1) The transfer
is fair and reasonable in the best interests of the payee, taking into account
the welfare and support of the payee’s dependents. Transferor is collecting $50,000.00
for future payment of $94,560.00, the discounted present value of which is $74,356.25.
Transferor is an unmarried, unemployed forty-three-year-old with no minor
children, is experiencing financial hardship and would use the transfer funds
to purchase a property. (Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (a)(1) [framed by Ins.
Code, § 10139.5, subds. (b)(1)-(15)]; see also Amended Petition, Ex. A, California
Purchase Contract, ¶ 10; Payee Decl., ¶¶ 8, 11.)
 
(2) The payee has been advised in writing
to seek independent professional advice
regarding the transfer and has either received that advice or knowingly waived,
in writing, the opportunity to receive the advice.  (Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (a)(2); Amended Petition,
Ex. A, California Purchase Contract [Transferor was advised to obtain
independent legal advice and professional tax advice about the sale of the
Purchased Payments]; Payee Decl., ¶ 12 [“I did not receive independent legal or
financial advice regarding the proposed transaction. A copy of the waiver is
attached to Exhibit ‘E’ of the petition.”].)
 
            (3) Petitioner has complied with the
notification requirements pursuant to paragraph (2) of subdivision (f), has
provided payee with a disclosure form that complies with Section 10136 and the
transfer agreement complies with Sections 10136 and 10138. (Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (a)(3); Ins.
Code, § 10136, subds. (b)-(e) discussion supra & Ins. Code, §
10139.5, subd. (f) discussion infra at “Second, …” & Amended
Petition Ex. A, California Purchase Contract.)
 
            (4) The transfer does not contravene
any applicable statute or the order of any court or other government authority.
(Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (a)(4).)
 
            (5)
The payee understands the terms of the transfer agreement, including the terms
set forth in the disclosure statement required by Section 10136. (Ins. Code, §
10139.5, subd. (a)(5); Payee Decl., ¶ 13 [“I understand the terms of the
transfer agreement, including the terms set forth in the disclosure statement
…”].)
 
(6) Payee
understands and does not wish to exercise the right to cancel the transfer
agreement. (Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (a)(6); Payee Decl., ¶ 13 [“I … do not
wish to exercise my right to cancel the agreement”].)
 
Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (c)
            Except
as noted below, the Amended Petition satisfies all the payee information
required from Section 10139.5, subdivision (c) as follows ((Ins. Code, §
10139.5, subd. (c)):
 
(1) Included the
payee’s name and age. (Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (c)(1); Payee Decl., p. 1:19
[Harvey Robertson] & ¶ 8 [43 years old].)
 
(2) Included the
payee’s marital status, and, if married or separated, the name of payee’s
spouse. (Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (c)(2); Payee Decl., ¶ 8 [“I am not married.”].)
 
(3) Included the
names, ages, and place or places of residence of payee’s minor children or
other dependents, if any. (Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (c)(3); Payee Decl., ¶ 8
[“I have 0 minor children.”].)
 
(4) Included the
amounts and sources of the payee’s monthly income and financial resources. (Ins.
Code, § 10139.5, subd. (c)(4); Payee Decl., ¶ 8 [“I am currently unemployed due
to my injury. I am currently receiving payments of $2,218.37 per month from my
annuity”].) 
 
(5) Included
information permitting the determination of whether payee is currently
obligated under any child support or spousal support order, and, if so, the
names, addresses, and telephone numbers of any individual, entity, or agency
that is receiving child or spousal support from the payee under that order or
that has jurisdiction over the order or the payments in question. (Ins. Code, §
10139.5, subd. (c)(5); Payee Decl., ¶ 8 [“I am not married.”; “I do not have
any court-ordered child support obligations”].) The Court notes that there is nothing in the declaration specifying that Transferor
has no obligation for spousal support. The Court would accept sworn testimony
to that effect at the time of the hearing. 
 
(6) Included
information regarding previous transfers or attempted transfers, as described
in paragraph (11), (12), or (13) of subdivision (b). (Ins. Code, § 10139.5,
subd. (c)(6) [framed by Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subds. (b)(11)-(13), requiring
information only for petitions in last five years]; Payee
Decl., ¶¶ 9-10 [Transferor has not completed or attempted any previous
transactions].)

 
Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (f)
            The
amended petition satisfies the requirements of Section 10139.5, subdivision (f)
as follows (Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (f)):
 
First, the
transfer agreement satisfies the requirements of Section 10139.5, subdivision
(f)(1), because Petitioner made the instant Petition and the Petition was
brought in the county in which the Payee resides. (Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (f)(1); Amended Petition, p. 1 [showing
Petitioner J.G. Wentworth brings
this Petition]; Payee Decl., ¶ 1 [“I reside in Los Angeles County, California”].)
 
            Second,
except as noted below, the Petition satisfies the requirements of Section 10139.5,
subdivision (f)(2).
 
            Formal notice of this transfer and a
copy of the Amended Petition itself was filed by Petitioner with the Court and
served on all interested parties no later than November 23, 2024—i.e., original
Petition, notice, Amended Petition, declaration in support of Petitioner’s
Petition, notice of case assignment, and proof of service were served on
Transferor, the annuity issuer, and the annuity obligor. (See Ins. Code, §
10139.5, subd. (f)(2) [notice of the proposed transfer and the petition for its
authorization to be filed with the court and served on all interested parties
within 20 days of hearing]; see also 11/19/24 Proof of Service.) 
 
Further, except as noted below, the notice
and Petition have attached all the necessary documents required from this
subdivision. (Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subds. (f)(2)(A)-(L).) The notice and
petition: 
 
(A) Include a
copy of the instant petition and need not attach prior petitions made outside
of five years from the date of this petition. (Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd.
(f)(2)(A) [framed by Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (c)(6), which in turn is
framed by Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subds. (b)(11)-(13), requiring information
about petitions in last five years]; Payee Decl., ¶¶ 9-10 [Transferor has not
completed or attempted any previous transactions].)
 
(B) Include a
copy of the proposed transfer agreement and disclosure form required by
paragraph (3) of subdivision (a). (Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (f)(2)(B);
Amended Petition, Ex. A, California Purchase Contract &, Ex. B, California
Disclosure Statement.)
 
(C) Include
information regarding Transferor’s dependents and their ages. (See Ins. Code, §
10139.5, subd. (f)(2)(C); Payee Decl. ¶ 8 [not married; no minor children].)
 
(D) Include a
copy of the disclosure required in subdivision (b) of Section 10136. (See Ins.
Code, § 10139.5, subd. (f)(2)(D); Amended Petition, Ex. B, California
Disclosure Statement.)
 
(E) Include
copies of the annuity contract, any qualified assignment agreement, and
underlying structured settlement agreement, if available, and if not available,
a showing of reasonable efforts to locate and secure a copy of the document
have been made, including making inquiry with Payee. (See Ins. Code, § 10139.5,
subds. (f)(2)(E)-(H); Amended Petition, Exs. C [Qualified Assignment and
Release Agreement] & D, ¶ 9 [“have attempted to locate the Settlement
Agreement and have been unsuccessful.”].)
 
(F) Include
copies of the proofs of service made for notice of this petition. (Ins. Code, §
10139.5, subd. (f)(2)(I); 11/19/24 Proof of Service.)
 
(G) Include a
notification that any interested party is entitled to support, oppose, or
otherwise respond to the transferee’s petition, either in person or by counsel,
by submitting written comments to the court or by participating in the hearing.
(Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (f)(2)(J); see Notice of Hearing; 11/19/24 Proof
of Service.)
 
(H) Include a
notification of the time and place of the hearing and notification of the
manner in which and the time by which written responses to the petition must be
filed, which may not be less than 15 days after service of the transferee’s
notice, in order to be considered by the court. (See Ins. Code, § 10139.5,
subd. (f)(2)(K); see Notice of Hearing; 11/19/24 Proof of Service.)
 
(I) If the payee
entered into the structured settlement at issue within five years prior to the
date of the transfer agreement, then the transferee shall provide notice to the
payee’s attorney of record at the time the structured settlement was created,
if the attorney is licensed to practice in California, at the attorney’s
address on file with the State Bar of California. (See Ins. Code, § 10139.5,
subd. (f)(2)(L).) The Court notes that Transferor entered into “the original
structured settlement agreement on or about 2023…” (Payee Decl., ¶ 4.) However, proofs of
service on file with the Court do not indicate that notice has been provided to
Transferor’s attorney of record at the time the structured settlement agreement
was created. 
Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (g)
The Amended Petition satisfies the
requirements of Section 10139.5, subdivision (g) requiring that transferees
bear the costs of transfer petitions of structured settlement rights. (Ins.
Code, § 10139.5, subd. (g); Amended Petition,
Ex. A, California Purchase Contract [“We have charged [Harvey Robertson]
for the following expenses: [¶] … $0.00 [¶] for a total of $0.00 in expenses”] & Ex. B, California Disclosure
Statement, p. 1 [same].)
 
Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (h)
The Amended Petition satisfies the
requirements of Section 10139.5, subdivision (h) because, when it was filed,
Petitioner advised Transferor of his right to seek independent counsel and
financial advice in connection with this transfer petition and advised Transferor
of his right to a reimbursement of $1,500 for incurring such costs. (See Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (h); Amended Petition,
Ex. A, California Purchase Contract [Harvey Robertson was advised to receive independent
representation and elected not to seek out such independent professional
representation]; Payee Decl., ¶ 12 [“I did not receive independent legal or
financial advice regarding the proposed transaction. A copy of the waiver is
attached to Exhibit ‘E’ of the petition.”].)
 
Requirements
Conclusion
            The
Court requires the presence of Transferor at the hearing so that the Court can
take sworn testimony from him to (1) confirm that there are no spousal support
obligations, (2) discuss how he intends to pay his living expenses if he will
use these funds for the purchase of property and he is unemployed.  Further, counsel will be required to answer
the Court’s concerns as to why notice to counsel pursuant to section 10139.5, subd. (f)(2)(L) was not
provided or is not required. The Court will take sworn testimony from
Transferor and will hear from counsel on these issues at the hearing, and based
on that testimony will determine whether or not to grant this Amended Petition.
