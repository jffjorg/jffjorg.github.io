And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendant's motion to stay the case, but only on the condition that the Ohio court applies the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act in its entirety. The judge strikes the waiver provision in the limited warranty that requires Ohio law to apply, as this would conflict with the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act. The judge finds that the forum selection clause is reasonable, as it has a logical connection to the defendant's business of manufacturing vehicles in Ohio. The judge also rejects the plaintiff's arguments that the forum selection clause is unconscionable, finding that the plaintiff did not prove that he did not freely and voluntarily agree to the clause. The judge orders the case to be stayed and sets a hearing date for May 13, 2024, at which the case may be dismissed if the plaintiff's counsel fails to file a status report and appear at the hearing.
