And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling of the Court orders the summary denial of Sunwest Bank's third-party claim. The Court has previously ruled in Outsource, LLC v. Horizon Communications Technologies, Inc. (Cal. Ct. App., Mar. 23, 2023, No. B314438) 2023 WL 2605405 that Sunwest Bank's third-party claim to funds in a bank deposit account is not entitled to priority over Outsource, LLC's interest. Sunwest Bank argues that this decision does not preclude them from filing a new third-party claim, but the Court finds this argument to be incorrect. The Court orders that the funds being held by the Santa Clara County Sheriff's Department shall be released and disbursed to Outsource, LLC, and that a proposed order shall be signed.
