  Case Number:  20STCV20862    Hearing Date:   October 12, 2023    Dept:  39 Outsource, LLC v.
Horizon Communications Technologies, Inc., et al.
Case No.
20STCV20862
Petition for
Denial of Third-Party Claim
 
            Petitioner
Outsource, LLC (“Petitioner”) petitions the Court for summary denial of the
third-party claim by Sunwest Bank.  A
judgment creditor may direct a levying officer to satisfy a writ of execution
on property in which a third party holds an interest.  (Associated Oil Co. v. Mullin (1930)
110 Cal.App. 385, 392.)  The Court may
determine the rights of the third party before the property is applied to
satisfaction of the judgment.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 720.010.)  The third-party claim
constitutes the claimant’s pleading, and the judgment creditor's statement
opposing a claim constitutes the creditor's pleading.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 720.350, subd. (a).)  The third party must submit a copy of any
writing on which a claim is based, including any security agreement and any
financing statement.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
720.130, subd. (b), 720.230, subd. (b).) 
The third party has the burden of proof at the hearing.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 720.360.)
 
In Outsource, LLC v. Horizon
Communications Technologies, Inc. (Cal. Ct. App., Mar. 23, 2023, No.
B314438) 2023 WL 2605405, the Court of Appeal found that Sunwest Bank’s
third-party claim to funds in a bank deposit account is not entitled to
priority over Petitioner’s interest. 
Thus, Sunwest Bank’s third-party claim has been adjudicated.  
 
In opposition, Sunwest Bank argues
that the Court of Appeal’s decision does not preclude Sunwest Bank from filing
a new third-party claim.  Sunwest Bank is
incorrect.  As the Court of Appeal
stated, “Sunwest asserts that the appropriate remedy is to remand the matter to
give Sunwest an opportunity to conduct discovery to obtain evidence
establishing that governing local law. 
But Sunwest is not entitled to that second bite at the apple.”  (Outsource, LLC v. Horizon Communications
Technologies, Inc. (Cal. Ct. App., Mar. 23, 2023, No. B314438) 2023 WL
2605405, at *6.)  This statement by the
Court of Appeal, which is binding on this Court, resolves the issue.
 
Based upon the foregoing, the Court
orders as follows:
 
1.         The
Court grants Petitioner’s petition and denies Sunwest Bank’s third-party
claim.  Judgment shall be entered in
favor of Petitioner and the funds being held by the Santa Clara County Sheriff’s
Department shall be released and disbursed to Petitioner.
 
2.         The
Court signs the proposed order, lodged on September 18, 2023.
 
3.         Petitioner’s
counsel shall provide notice and file proof of such with the Court.
