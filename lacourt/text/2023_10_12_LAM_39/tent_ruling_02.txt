NOTICE
 
            The Court

BACKGROUND
 
            Plaintiff
Darren Fuller (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Jimmy Lee and Ida Hampton
(collectively, “Defendants”), asserting causes of action for quiet title,
declaratory relief, unjust enrichment, and quantum meruit.  This action relates to two properties: (1) A
property located at 15724 Brayton Street in Paramount, California 90723 (the
“Brayton Property”); and (2) A property located at 137 West 111th Place in Los
Angeles, California 90061 (the “111th Place Property”).  Defendants demur to each cause of action and
move to strike the prayer for attorney’s fees. 
The Court sustains the demurrer to the first and fourth causes of action
(quiet title) without leave to amend. 
The Court sustains the demurrer to the third, sixth, and seventh causes
of action with leave to amend.  The Court
overrules the demurrer to the second and fifth causes of action without
prejudice to Defendants demurring to these causes of action in any amended
complaint.  The Court grants the motion
to strike with leave to amend.     
 
PLAINTIFF’S ALLEGATIONS 
 
In 2000, Plaintiff wanted to
purchase the Brayton Property but could not qualify for a loan.  (Complaint, ¶ 11.)  Therefore, Defendants, who are Plaintiff’s
in-laws, purchased the property in their names. 
(Complaint, ¶ 13.)  Plaintiff made
the down payment and paid all closing costs, commissions, and fees for the
Brayton Property.  (Complaint, ¶
14.)  Since 2000, Plaintiff has paid all
of the mortgage payments, taxes, insurance, utilities, and maintenance/repair
costs for the Brayton Property. 
(Complaint, ¶ 15.)  Plaintiff has
his family have resided at the Brayton Property since 2000.  (Complaint, ¶ 16.)  Plaintiff alleges that Defendants agreed to
deed the Brayton Property to him when he would be eligible to hold title in his
own name, but failed to do so. 
(Complaint, ¶¶ 13, 30.)      
 
Plaintiff also alleges as follows:
In or about 1989, Defendant Jimmy Lee Hampton inherited the 111th Place
Property, and in 2005, he conveyed the property to himself and his wife.  (Complaint, ¶ 39.)  Shortly thereafter, Plaintiff made an oral
agreement with Defendants that he would rehabilitate the property, and in
return, Defendants would sell him the property for $450,000.  (Complaint, ¶ 40.)  Plaintiff spent over $200,000 rehabilitating
the property, and secured tenants, so the property produces income.  (Complaint, ¶ 42.)  Plaintiff also paid $5,000 as a
down-payment.  (Complaint, ¶ 40.)  However, Defendants have not honored their
agreement.  (Complaint, ¶ 43.)
 
LEGAL STANDARD
 
A.        Demurrer
 
A
demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action.
(Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)  When considering demurrers, courts read the
allegations liberally and in context.  (Taylor v.
City of Los Angeles Dept. of Water and Power (2006) 144
Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228.)  “A demurrer
tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters.  Therefore, it lies only where the defects
appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed.”  (SKF Farms v. Superior Court (1984)
153 Cal.App.3d 902, 905.)  “The only
issue involved in a demurrer hearing is whether the complaint, as it stands,
unconnected with extraneous matters, states a cause of action.” (Hahn, supra, 147
Cal.App.4th at p. 747.)  However, courts
do not accept as true deductions, contentions, or conclusions of law or
fact.  (Stonehouse Homes LLC v. City
of Sierra Madre (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 531, 538.)  The general rule is that the plaintiff need
only allege ultimate facts, not evidentiary facts.  (Doe v. City of Los
Angeles (2007) 42 Cal.4th 531, 550.)  “[D]emurrers for
uncertainty are disfavored, and are granted only if the pleading is so
incomprehensible that a defendant cannot reasonably respond.”  (Lickiss v.
Fin. Indus. Regulatory Auth. (2012) 208 Cal.App.4th 1125, 1135.) 
In addition, even where a complaint is in some respects uncertain, courts
strictly construe a demurrer for uncertainty “because ambiguities can be
clarified under modern discovery procedures.” 
(Khoury v. Maly’s of California, Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612,
616.)  Demurrers do not lie as to only
parts of causes of action, where some valid claim is alleged but “must dispose
of an entire cause of action to be sustained.” (Poizner v.
Fremont General Corp. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97, 119.)  
 
            B.        Motion to Strike 
 
Courts may, upon a motion, or at any time in
their discretion, and upon terms they deem proper, strike any
irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 436, subd. (a).) Courts may also strike all or any
part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of this
state, a court rule, or an order of the court. (Id., §
436, subd. (b).)  The grounds for a motion
to strike are that the pleading has irrelevant, false or improper
matter, or has not been drawn or filed in conformity with laws. (Id., §
436.) The grounds for moving to strike must appear on the face
of the pleading or by way of judicial notice. (Id.,
§¿437.)  
 
DISCUSSION 
 
            A.        Quiet Title Claims – First and Fourth
Causes of Action 
 
            Plaintiff
cannot maintain a cause of action for quiet title because he concedes he is not
a legal owner of the property.  (Lewis
v. Superior Court (1994) 30 Cal.App.4th 1850, 1866.)  “[W]hatever interest [Plaintiff] might have
is only equitable, and the holder of equitable title cannot maintain a quiet
title action against the legal owner.” 
(Ibid., citing Stafford v. Ballinger (1962) 199 Cal.App.2d 289,
294-295.)  Therefore, the Court sustains
Defendants’ demurrer to the first and fourth causes of action.  The Court denies leave to amend, as no
amendment would be successful.
 
            B.        Unjust Enrichment Claims – Third and
Sixth Causes of Action 
 
            Plaintiff
asserts unjust enrichment claims. 
However, there is no independent cause of action for “unjust enrichment”
in California.  (See, e.g., McBride v.
Boughton (2004) 123 Cal.App.4th 379, 387-388.) 
Rather, it appears that Plaintiff is asserting causes of action for an
oral breach of contract, and the Court will analyze these causes of action
accordingly.
 
            1.         The Brayton Property
 
            Defendant
argues that the statute of fraud bars claims with respect to the Brayton
Property.  The statute of frauds provides
that a contract that falls under it is invalid unless memorialized in writing,
and signed by the party against whom the contract is to be enforced.  (Civ. Code, § 1624.)  In this case, Plaintiff alleges that
Defendants agreed to hold title for the benefit of Plaintiff until Plaintiff
qualified to hold title on his own.  In
essence, Plaintiff alleges he had an option to purchase the property from
Defendants.  Such an agreement is subject
to the statute of frauds.  (See Robert
T. Miner, M.D., Inc. v. Tustin Avenue Investors, LLC (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th
264, 270.)  However, Plaintiff alleges
that he paid the entire down payment to the home, the closing costs, all
mortgage payments, property taxes, property insurance premiums, all and
maintenance and repair costs.  Plaintiff
also alleges that he was in possession of the property at all times.  Partial performance of an oral real property
sale contract takes the contract out of the statute of frauds.  (See Code Civ. Proc., § 1972, subd. (a).) 
            
            Defendants
also argue that the statute of limitations bars this cause of action.  Under the delayed discovery rule, a claim does
not accrue until “a plaintiff knew or should have known of the wrongful conduct
at issue.”  (April Enterprises, Inc.
v. KTTV (1983) 147 Cal.App.3d 805, 832.) 
In this case, Plaintiff alleges that Defendants agreed to deed the
property to him when he would be eligible to hold title in his own name, so the
statute of limitations would begin to run once Plaintiff knew or should have
known that he was eligible to hold title in his own name.  The complaint does not allege any facts on
this issue.  
 
            Based upon
the foregoing, the Court sustains the demurrer to the third cause of
action.  The Court grants leave to amend
so Plaintiff may assert a breach of contract claim based upon the Brayton
property and allege sufficient facts to demonstrate that the action is
timely.    
 
            2.         The 111th Place Property 
 
Defendants argue that the statute
of fraud bars claims with respect to the 111th Place Property.  The statute of frauds provides that a
contract that falls under it is invalid unless memorialized in writing, and
signed by the party against whom the contract is to be enforced.  (Civ. Code, § 1624.)  In this case, Plaintiff alleges that
Defendants agreed to sell him the 111th Place Property after he rehabilitated
it.  In essence, Plaintiff alleges he had
an option to purchase the property from Defendants upon completion of the work.  Such an agreement is subject to the statute
of frauds.  (See Robert T. Miner,
M.D., Inc. v. Tustin Avenue Investors, LLC (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 264,
270.)  However, Plaintiff alleges that he
paid $5,000 as a down-payment and spent over $200,000 rehabilitating the
property.  Partial performance of an oral
real property sale contract takes the contract out of the statute of
frauds.  (See Code Civ. Proc., § 1972,
subd. (a).)
 
            Defendants
also argue that the statute of limitations bars this cause of action.  Under the delayed discovery rule, a claim
does not accrue until “a plaintiff knew or should have known of the wrongful
conduct at issue.”  (April
Enterprises, Inc. v. KTTV (1983) 147 Cal.App.3d 805, 832.)  In this case, Plaintiff alleges that
Defendants agreed to sell him the property once the rehabilitation work was
completed.  However, the complaint does
not allege any facts on that issue.  
 
            Based upon
the foregoing, the Court sustains the demurrer to the sixth cause of
action.  The Court grants leave to amend
so Plaintiff may assert a breach of contract claim based upon the Brayton
property and allege sufficient facts to demonstrate that the action is timely.    
 
C.        Declaratory
Relief Claims – Second and Fifth Causes of Action 
 
Plaintiff’s second and fifth causes
of action seek a declaratory judgment concerning Plaintiff’s rights and duties
with respect to the two properties under Code of Civil Procedure section
1060.  The Court agrees with Defendants:
A declaratory relief action is inappropriate when a plaintiff has an adequate
remedy on other causes of action at trial. 
(See Hood v. Superior Court (1995) 33 Cal.App.4th
319, 324; California Ins. Guarantee Assn. v. Superior Court (1991) 231
Cal.App.3d 1617, 1624.)  
 
            The declaratory relief statute
should not be used for the purpose of anticipating and determining an issue
which can be determined in the main action. 
The object of the statute is to afford a new form of relief where needed
and not to furnish a litigant with a second cause of action for the
determination of identical issues.
 
(General of America Ins. Co.
v. Lilly (1968) 258 Cal.App.2d 465, 470.) 
The Court has discretion to decline to issue a declaratory judgment
under these circumstances.  (See AICCO,
Inc. v. Insurance Company of North America (2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 579,
590.)  
 
            However,
at this point, the Court overrules the demurrer because it is unclear whether
Plaintiff’s breach of contract claims will survive the next demurrer.  This order is without prejudice to Defendant
demurring to these causes of action in the context of the first amended
complaint.  
 
            D.        Quantum Meruit – Seventh Cause of Action

 
            Plaintiff’s
seventh cause of action is for quantum meruit, which seeks recovery of the
reasonable value of services rendered. 
(See Pacific Bay Recovery, Inc. v. California Physicians’ Services, Inc.
(2017) 12 Cal.App.5th 200, 214.)  The
statute of limitations for the claim is two years.  (See Iverson, Yoakum, Papiano & Hatch v.
Berwald (1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 990, 996.) 
Plaintiff does not allege that he provided any services in connection
with the 111th Place Property in the two years preceding the complaint.  Nor does he allege facts suggesting that the
seventh cause of action is otherwise timely. 
Therefore, the demurrer to the seventh cause of action is sustained with
leave to amend.
 
            E.         Motion to Strike 
 
            Defendants
seek to strike the prayer for attorney’s fees. 
Plaintiff alleges no basis for attorney’s fees in the complaint.  Therefore, the motion to strike is granted
with leave to amend.

2.         The
Court sustains the demurrer to the first and fourth causes of action without
leave to amend.  
 
3.         The
Court sustains the demurrer to the third, sixth, and seventh causes of action
with leave to amend.  The Court prohibits
Plaintiff from re-asserting causes of action for unjust enrichment but

4.         The
Court overrules the demurrer to the second and fifth causes of action without
prejudice to Defendants demurring to these causes of action in any amended

for hearing on that date/time.  
 
8.         Defendants’
counsel shall provide notice and file proof of such with the Court.
