And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The court grants the motion to compel arbitration brought by the defendants, Broadway Typewriter Company, Inc. and Arey Jones Company. The court finds that the plaintiff, Juan Antonio Espitia, signed an arbitration agreement as a condition of his employment with the defendants. The court also finds that the arbitration agreement covers the claims alleged in the complaint and that the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) applies. The court rejects the plaintiff's claims of fraud in the execution and lack of mutual assent, finding that the plaintiff had a reasonable opportunity to acquaint himself with the terms of the arbitration agreement and that the defendants had no duty to explain the terms of the agreement. The court also finds that the arbitration agreement is not substantively unconscionable. The court therefore grants the motion to compel arbitration and stays the court proceedings pending the completion of the arbitration.
