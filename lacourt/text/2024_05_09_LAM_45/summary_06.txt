Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the defendant's motion to quash the service of summons and dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and/or stay or dismiss for inconvenient forum. The defendant had argued that there were insufficient contacts between him and California to justify the exercise of personal jurisdiction. The Judge found that the defendant was physically present in California at the time of service and that the court has jurisdiction over the defendant based on his physical presence in the state. The Judge also found that California is the convenient forum for the parties to litigate the action.
