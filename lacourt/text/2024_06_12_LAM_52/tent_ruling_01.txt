  Case Number:  21STCV31654    Hearing Date:   June 12, 2024    Dept:  52 Plaintiff
Alexis Mitchell’s Motion to Quash Defendant’s Notice of Deposition of Plaintiff
and Request for Production of Documents
Plaintiff
Alexis Mitchell moves to quash the notice of her deposition served by defendant
Quantum Environmental Testing, Inc. 
(Khan Decl., Ex. A.)  A party may
“move for an order staying the taking of [her] deposition and quashing the
deposition notice.”  (CCP §
2025.410(c).)  
Plaintiff’s
motion is untimely.  “[A]ny party shall
be entitled as a matter of right to complete discovery proceedings on or before
the 30th day, and to have motions concerning discovery heard on or before the
15th day, before the date initially set for the trial of the action.”  (CCP § 2024.020(a).)  At latest, the deadline to hear this
discovery motion was 15 days before the current trial date of June 20,
2024.  This hearing is only eight days
before trial.  The court therefore must
deny the motion.  
Disposition
Plaintiff
Alexis Mitchell’s motion to quash the notice of her deposition is denied.
