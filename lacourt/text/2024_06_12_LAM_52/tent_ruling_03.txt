 Case Number:  23STCV17249    Hearing Date:   June 12, 2024    Dept:  52 Defendant GR0.com, LLC’s Demurrer and
Motion to Strike Portions of Complaint 
Demurrer
            Defendant GR0.com, LLC demurs to the
second, third, and fourth causes of action alleged by plaintiff Aaron Friedman.
Uncertainty
            Defendant argues these causes of
action are uncertain because the complaint asserts the claims against “All
Defendants,” but there is only one defendant. 
“Demurrers for uncertainty are
disfavored, and are granted only if the pleading is so incomprehensible that a
defendant cannot reasonably respond.”  (A.J.
Fistes Corp. v. GDL Best Contractors, Inc. (2019) 38 Cal.App.5th 677,
695, internal quotes and alterations omitted.) 
The complaint must sufficiently apprise defendants of the claims against
them.  (Ibid.)  The complaint meets this standard.  That the complaint only specifically names
one defendant (in addition to Does 1 to 20) does not make it uncertain.  Every reference to plural “defendants”
necessarily includes GR0.com, LLC.    
2nd
Cause of Action for Whistleblower Retaliation
            Plaintiff alleges sufficient facts
for this cause of action.  Labor Code
section 1102.5(b) prohibits an employer from retaliating against an employee
for reporting information that “the employee has reasonable cause to believe …
discloses a violation of state or federal statute, or a violation of or
noncompliance with a local, state, or federal rule or regulation.”  This statute “
‘reflects the broad public policy interest in encouraging workplace
whistle-blowers to report unlawful acts without fearing retaliation.’ ”  (Lawson v. PPG Architectural Finishes,
Inc. (2022) 12 Cal.5th 703, 709.)       
The
complaint alleges, “Plaintiff notified his employer that GR0 was engaged in
unlawful employment practices, including violation of the labor code, and
misclassifying employees.”  (¶ 131.)  This allegation may not suffice on its own,
but elsewhere the complaint alleges he “inform[ed] Defendants of GR0’s unlawful
employment practices which violated FEHA, including, but not limited to, sexual
harassment of at least five female employees by control persons, harassing
conduct and language toward an employee with a mental disability, and retaliation
by loss of privileges by reporting the same.” 
(¶ 119.)  
FEHA
is a state statute.  Plaintiff alleges he
disclosed FEHA violations to defendant.  “[T]he FEHA
employment retaliation provision protects the disclosure of a specific legal
violation (antidiscrimination laws; Gov.Code, § 12940, subd. (h)), while
section 1102.5(b) protects the disclosure of violations of statutes,
regulations or rules generally.”  (Patten
v. Grant Joint Union High School Dist. (2005) 134 Cal.App.4th 1378, 1388.)  Defendant provides no authority that section
1102.5 does not apply to disclosing FEHA violations.
Defendant
relies on federal authority about protected activity under Title VII.  “The opposition must be directed at an
unlawful employment practice of an employer, not an act of discrimination by a
private individual.”  (Silver v. KCA,
Inc. (9th Cir. 1978) 586 F.2d 138, 141.) 
There, the court held that complaining of a coworker’s racist comment was
not protected activity.  (Ibid.)  Assuming this authority applies to
whistleblower retaliation, it is distinguishable.  Here, plaintiff alleges he complained about
“retaliation by loss of privileges” against other employees for “reporting”
FEHA violations.  (Comp., ¶ 119.)  He further alleges he complained about
retaliation against himself.  (Comp., ¶¶ 94,
96, 103.)  Retaliating against employees
is not private discrimination.  It is an employer’s
act in controlling employees’ terms and conditions of employment.   
Defendant
also relies on outdated authority that the disclosure must be made to someone
who did not know about the violation. 
(Reply, pp. 5-6.)  “[A] protected
disclosure under section 1102.5(b) encompasses reports or complaints of a
violation made to an employer or agency even if the recipient already knows of
the violation.”  (People ex rel.
Garcia-Brower v. Kolla's, Inc. (2023) 14 Cal.5th 719, 734.)  The California Supreme Court overruled prior
authority that reporting a violation directly to the wrongdoer was not a
protected disclosure.  (Id. at pp.
722-724.)  Disclosing wrongdoing by the
company’s founders to the founders themselves constitutes protected
whistleblowing.    
3rd
Cause of Action for Wrongful Termination in Violation of Public Policy
            Plaintiff alleges sufficient facts
for this cause of action.  Defendant argues
plaintiff failed to identify the statute, constitutional provision, or
regulation establishing the public policy defendant violated.  “ ‘ “[T]ermination of an employee most
clearly violates public policy when it contravenes the provision of a statute
forbidding termination for a specified reason.” ’ ”  (Diego v. Pilgrim United Church of Christ
(2014) 231 Cal.App.4th 913, 926.)  Courts
have held that violating Labor Code section 1102.5 (id. at p. 929; Ferrick v. Santa Clara University (2014) 231 Cal.App.4th 1337, 1347) or FEHA (City of Moorpark v. Superior Court (1998) 18 Cal.4th 1143, 1159
[disability discrimination] Stevenson v. Superior
Court (1997) 16 Cal.4th 880, 885 [sex
discrimination]) also constitutes termination in violation of public policy.  Plaintiff alleges defendant terminated him in
violation of those statutes.  Those
allegations suffice for wrongful termination in violation of public policy.  
            Defendant also argues plaintiff has
not alleged sufficient facts to show causation. 
He alleges defendants terminated him “based on his complaints” (¶ 121),
that his “requests regarding compliance with the law [were] a substantial motivating
reason for Defendants’ decisions to engage in adverse employment actions” (¶
134), and “Defendants’ termination of Plaintiff’s employment was motivated by
their bias against Plaintiff because of his complaints to management about
GR0’s illegal employment practices” (¶ 144). 
These allegations of intent are ultimate facts and are sufficient to
withstand challenge by demurrer.  (See,
e.g., Perkins v. Superior Court
(1981) 117 Cal.App.3d 1, 6 [allegations that defendants acted “wrongfully and
intentionally” and “in retaliation” sufficient to support prayer for punitive
damages]; Johnson v. Casetta (1961)
197 Cal.App.2d 272, 276 [“an allegation of knowledge of incompetency is an
allegation of ultimate fact”]; Rosin v.
Superior Court (1960) 181 Cal.App.2d 486, 490 [“It has been suggested that
the allegation of petitioner’s intent in removing the children from the
jurisdiction is only a conclusion. . . . 
This is an allegation of fact, not a mere conclusion.”].)
4th
Cause of Action for Unfair Business Practices
            Plaintiff does not allege sufficient
facts for this cause of action.  In a
cause of action for unfair business practices, a private plaintiff only has
standing if he or she “has suffered injury in fact and has lost money or
property as a result of the unfair competition.”  (Bus. & Prof. Code, § 17204; accord Clayworth
v. Pfizer, Inc. (2010) 49 Cal.4th 758, 788.)  “There are innumerable ways in which economic
injury from unfair competition may be shown. 
A plaintiff may (1) surrender in a transaction more, or acquire in a
transaction less, than he or she otherwise would have; (2) have a present or
future property interest diminished; (3) be deprived of money or property
to which he or she has a cognizable claim; or (4) be required to enter into a
transaction, costing money or property, that would otherwise have been
unnecessary.”  (Kwikset Corp. v.
Superior Court (2011) 51 Cal.4th 310, 323 (Kwikset).)
            Plaintiff’s complaint alleges no facts constituting
losing money or property as a result of unfair competition.  The complaint makes only the conclusory
allegation that “Plaintiff has suffered injury in fact and
was deprived of property as a result of Defendants’ unfair business practices,
and Defendants have reaped unfair benefits at Plaintiff’s expense.”  (¶ 153.) 
Plaintiff argues this allegation suffices as an ultimate fact, and his “damage
is an issue of fact still to be determined.” 
(Opp., p. 11.)  Regardless of the
“quantum of lost money or property,” a plaintiff must “ ‘ “allege[] some specific, ‘identifiable
trifle’ of injury.” ’ ”  (Kwikset,
supra, 51 Cal.4th at p. 324.)  He
alleges no identifiable injury of losing money or property.  He does not allege he paid defendant anything,
suffered diminution of a property interest, was deprived of money he earned, or
was required to enter any transaction. 
Motion
to Strike
Defendant moves
to strike several portions of the complaint regarding punitive damages.  Courts may strike allegations related to
punitive damages where the facts alleged “do not rise to the level of malice,
oppression or fraud necessary” to recover punitive damages under Civil Code
section 3294.  (Turman v. Turning
Point of Central California, Inc. (2010) 191 Cal.App.4th 53, 64.)  Conclusory allegations are not enough.  (Smith v. Superior Court (1992)
10 Cal.App.4th 1033, 1042.)  The
complaint must make “factual assertions supporting a conclusion [defendants]
acted with oppression, fraud or malice.” 
(Ibid.) 
Plaintiff
alleges sufficient facts to recover punitive damages.  “[W]illfully and consciously retaliat[ing]
against” employees for exercising their rights can constitute malicious or
oppressive conduct sufficient for punitive damages.  (Colucci v. T-Mobile USA, Inc. (2020)
48 Cal.App.5th 442, 455.)  That an
employer “intentionally discriminated against” an employee can suffice for
malice.  (Cloud v. Casey (1999) 76
Cal.App.4th 895, 911.)  As discussed
above, plaintiff adequately alleges defendant intentionally terminated him because
he opposed FEHA violations.  At this
stage, those allegations suffice for punitive damages.  Whether the alleged conduct rises to the
level of malice, oppression, or fraud is a question of fact.  
Plaintiff also
alleges sufficient facts for punitive damages against a corporation.  For a corporate employer to be liable for
punitive damages, “the advance knowledge and conscious disregard [of an employee’s
unfitness], authorization, ratification or act of oppression, fraud, or malice
must be on the part of an officer, director, or managing agent of the
corporation.”  (Civ. Code, § 3294(b).)  “[M]anaging agents are employees who
‘exercise substantial independent authority and judgment in their corporate
decisionmaking so that their decisions ultimately determine corporate policy.’
”  (Mazik v. Geico General Ins. Co.
(2019) 35 Cal.App.5th 455, 464.) 
 Plaintiff alleges he was terminated by Kevin
Miller and Joe Zacharias.  (Comp., ¶ 107.)
 He further alleges they were the
“Co-Founders of GR0,” Miller was the “CEO”, and Zacharias was the “President”
of the company.  (¶ 15.)  Plaintiff’s factual allegations (¶¶ 29,
33-37, 39, 43, 48-49, 64-65, 68-74, 77-89, 91, 93-107) support the conclusion
that Miller and Zacharias exercised substantial authority over the company.  The complaint alleges sufficient facts to
show Miller and Zacharias were officers, directors, or managing agents of
GR0.com, LLC and that their acts were oppressive or malicious.  
Disposition
Defendant GR0.com, LLC’s demurrer to plaintiff Aaron
Friedman’s second and third causes of action is overruled.  Defendant’s
demurrer to the fourth cause of action is sustained with 20 days’ leave to amend.  Defendant’s motion to strike is denied.
