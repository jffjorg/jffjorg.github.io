The tentative ruling by the judge in this case concerns three motions filed by the plaintiff, Abbas Torabian, against American Honda Motor Co., Inc. The first motion seeks to set aside the ruling on defendant's motion in limine No. 20, which excluded testimony by the plaintiff's expert, Randall Bounds. The court finds good cause to reconsider this ruling and grants the motion.

The second motion seeks to reopen discovery and compel the deposition of defendant's expert, James Jongkind. The court grants this motion, finding that deposing Jongkind is necessary for the trial and that plaintiff failed to depose him at the agreed-upon time.

The third motion seeks to strike defendant's answer to the fourth amended complaint. The court denies this motion, finding that defendant's delay in answering did not cause prejudice to the plaintiff and that striking the answer would accomplish nothing.

In summary, the court grants plaintiff's motion to reconsider the ruling on defendant's motion in limine No. 20 and grants plaintiff's motion to reopen discovery and compel deposition of defendant's expert. The court denies plaintiff's motion to strike defendant's answer.
