 Case Number:  22STCV32721    Hearing Date:   January 10, 2024    Dept:  74 Narine Sargsyan v. Kan Di Ki, LLC,
et al.
 
Motion to Compel Arbitration.
 
The
court considered the moving papers and opposition, and reply.
In
2014, Plaintiff Narine Sargysan (Plaintiff) entered an arbitration agreement
with Defendant Kan Di Ki, LLC (Defendant). 
            In
2018, Plaintiff allegedly entered into an arbitration agreement with Trident
USA Health Services, Defendant’s parent company.
            On
October 5, 2022, Plaintiff filed a complaint against Grigor Galadzhyan and
Defendant. In the complaint, Plaintiff alleged causes of action for wrongful
termination, age discrimination, disability discrimination, failure to
accommodate, failure to engage in the interactive process, retaliation,
harassment, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and adverse
employment actions in violation of public policy.
            On
December 20, 2022, Defendant filed this motion to compel arbitration and stay
proceedings.
The
court grants Defendant’s motion to compel because none of Plaintiff’s arguments
resting on Defendant’s entry into and later emergence from a Chapter 11
corporate reorganization under the Bankruptcy Code, during which Defendant
assumed its pre-bankruptcy “employment related” agreements, persuades the court
that Defendant’s reorganization renders the arbitration agreement
unenforceable.
Defendant shall give notice.
