  Case Number:  21STCV06652    Hearing Date:   January 10, 2024    Dept:  74 Keith Fox,
et al. v. Equity Residential Properties, LLC, et al.
Motion for Leave to File First
Amended Complaint
BACKGROUND 
            This
action arises from an apartment fire.
            On
April 16, 2021, Plaintiff Joyce Eisman (Plaintiff) filed a complaint against
Defendants Equity Residential Management, LLC and Equity Residential Services,
LLC (Defendants).
            On
October 12, 2023, Plaintiff filed this motion for leave to file a first amended
complaint.
LEGAL STANDARD          
Under
Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (a)(1), “[t]he court may, in
furtherance of justice, and on any terms as may be proper, allow a party to
amend any pleading.”  Amendment may be
allowed at any time before or after commencement of trial. (Code Civ. Proc., §
576.) “[T]he court’s discretion will usually be exercised liberally to permit
amendment of the pleadings. The policy favoring amendment is so strong that it
is a rare case in which denial of leave to amend can be justified.” (Howard
v. County of San Diego (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 1422, 1428 (internal
citations omitted).) “If the motion to amend is timely made and the granting of
the motion will not prejudice the opposing party, it is error to refuse
permission to amend . . .”  (Morgan v.
Sup. Ct. (1959) 172 Cal.App.2d 527, 530.) Prejudice includes “delay in
trial, loss of critical evidence, or added costs of preparation.” (Solit v.
Tokai Bank, Ltd. New York Branch (1999) 68 Cal.App.4th 1435, 1448.) 
A
motion to amend a pleading before trial must include a copy of the proposed
amendment or amended pleading, which must be serially numbered to differentiate
it from previous pleadings or amendments. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1324(a).) The motion must also state what allegations
are proposed to be deleted or added, by page, paragraph, and line number.  (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1324(a).) Finally, a separate supporting declaration
specifying the effect of the amendment, why the amendment is necessary and
proper, when the facts giving rise to the amended allegations were discovered,
and the reason the request for amendment was not made earlier must also
accompany the motion. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.134(b).) 
DISCUSSION 
            As
a preliminary matter, the court finds that Plaintiff has substantially complied
with the applicable Rules of Court. Defendants argue in opposition that
Plaintiff’s delay in bringing this motion is unreasonable. But absent
prejudice, delay alone is not ground for denial of a motion for leave to amend.
(Higgins v. Del Faro (1981) 123 Cal.3d 558, 564-565.) Moreover, courts must
apply a policy of great liberality in permitting amendments “at any stage of
the proceedings, up to and including trial.” (Atkinson v. Elk Corp (2003)
109 Cal.App.4th 739, 761.) Defendant also contends that prejudice will result
because the amended pleading will jeopardize the trial date. But when this
motion was originally set to be heard on November 8, 2023 – which the parties
continued by stipulation to today, January 10, 2024 – trial was over five
months away. In addition, Defendant argues the proposed amendment has no merit.
But the court will address the amendment’s sufficiency in a demurrer or motion
to strike.
CONCLUSION 
The court grants Plaintiff’s motion for leave to file a first
amended complaint.
Plaintiff shall give notice.
