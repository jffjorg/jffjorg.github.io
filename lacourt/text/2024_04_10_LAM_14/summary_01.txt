The court granted the plaintiff's motion to compel the defendant to serve further responses to special interrogatories Nos. 40 and 42-45. The plaintiff asked the defendant to identify the individual(s) responsible for supervising the investigation into whether the vehicle qualified or was eligible for repurchase or replacement. The defendant objected to the interrogatory, claiming that it is too broad and seeks information protected by the attorney-client privilege and/or work product doctrine. The court held that the interrogatory is not too broad and that the defendant can answer the question without waiving any valid privilege objections they may have.
