"The Judge's tentative ruling states that the court cannot enter the stipulation and judgment submitted by the plaintiff on February 5, 2024. The court finds that the stipulation and judgment contains terms that appear to have been altered after signature and cannot be entered by the clerk. The court sets an OSC re: Dismissal for May 8, 2024 at 8:30 am, directing the clerk to reject the document submitted on February 5, 2024. The court also directs the plaintiff to either move to enforce the settlement or dismiss the case."
