And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings, holding that the plaintiff's complaint is not clearly pled and fails to identify the real party in interest. The judge also noted that the complaint attempts to combine separate legal theories, including breach of contract, promissory estoppel, and promissory fraud, which is improper. The judge has given the plaintiff 20 days to amend the complaint.
