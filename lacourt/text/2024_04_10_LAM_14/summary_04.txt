And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has taken under submission the demurrer filed by Defendants Curtis and Richardson. The demurrer is based on the grounds that the Complaint was filed prematurely and there is another action pending. The court has stayed the case pending the outcome of Case No. 22 STCV 15940. The court sets a Status Conference for July 10, 2024 at 8:30 am. The court also sets an OSC re: Reclassification for May 3, 2024, at 8:30 am. Responses to the OSC, if any, are due by April 24, 2024. The court has also taken into account the jurisdictional limitations of the court and the damages claimed by the plaintiff, which are below the court's jurisdictional limitations.
