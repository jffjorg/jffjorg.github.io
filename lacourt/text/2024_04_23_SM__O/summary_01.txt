And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted Defendant Jay Levine's Special Motion to Strike Pursuant to CCP § 425.16 (Anti-SLAPP) as to all causes of action in the Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint. The Judge finds that the Plaintiff's claims arise from constitutionally protected speech, specifically within CCP § 425.16(e)(4), which applies to "conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right... of free speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest." The Judge also finds that the Plaintiff has not met his burden to show a probability of prevailing on his claims, as the Program is an undisputed "expressive work" protected by the First Amendment. The Judge further finds that the Plaintiff's claims lack merit and are stricken as to the Defendant.
