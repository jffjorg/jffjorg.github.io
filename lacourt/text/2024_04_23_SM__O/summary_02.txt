And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendant's motion to strike portions of the plaintiff's complaint, specifically paragraphs 31, 38, 40:13–15, and 51, which relate to the plaintiff's claim for punitive damages. The plaintiff's complaint does not contain specific factual allegations to support the claim, and instead relies on conclusory language. The judge cites a previous court decision, Smith v. Superior Court (1992), which held that a plaintiff must plead specific factual assertions to support a claim for punitive damages. The plaintiff is given the opportunity to amend the complaint if it discovers specific facts to support its claim.
