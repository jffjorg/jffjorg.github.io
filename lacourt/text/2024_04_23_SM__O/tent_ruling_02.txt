Defendant UDR Marina Pointe LLC's Motion to Strike Portions of
Plaintiff Pnina Gillette's FAC is GRANTED. Defendant filed the motion on
2-20-24, Plaintiff filed an opposition on 4-10-24. and Defendant filed a reply
on 4-16-24. Plaintiff fails to plead specific facts in the Complaint to support
a claim for punitive damages. Specifically, Plaintiff only pleads conclusory
language and not particular facts to allege Defendant acted with malice,
oppression or fraud. (See Smith v. Superior Court (1992)
10 Cal.App.4th 1033 [holding that plaintiff was not entitled to
punitive damages, as her complaint was devoid of factual assertions to support
her conclusory allegations that defendants acted with oppression, fraud, or
malice].) The Court orders FAC ¶¶ 31, 38, 40:13–15, and 51 stricken from
the FAC. The Court notes that if Plaintiff discovers specific facts to allege
malice, oppression or fraud as to Defendant than Plaintiff may file for leave
to amend FAC.
