TENTATIVE
RULING
            Defendant
Jay Levine’s Special Motion to Strike Pursuant to CCP § 425.16 (Anti-SLAPP) is
GRANTED. All causes of action within Plaintiff Adam J. Tenser’s First Amended
Complaint are stricken as to Defendant Jay Levine. Defendant Jay Levine meets his
burden to prove the Plaintiff Adam J. Tensor’s claims arises from
constitutionally protected speech. Plaintiff Adam J. Tensor does not meet his
burden of proving the probability of prevailing on all claims in the FAC as to
Defendant Jay Levine. 
 
            Defendants
RJN are GRANTED as to the existence of articles, court documents, and the administrative
ruling documents, but not to the “truth of the hearsay statements in the
documents.” (In re Vicks (2013) 56 Cal.4th 274, 314.)
 
            “Litigation of an anti-SLAPP motion involves a two-step
process. First, the moving defendant bears the burden of establishing that the
challenged allegations or claims arise from protected activity in which the
defendant has engaged.  Second, for each claim that does arise from
protected activity, the plaintiff must show the claim has “at least ‘minimal
merit.  If the plaintiff cannot make this showing, the court will strike
the claim.”  (Bonni v. St. Joseph Health System (2021) 11 Cal.5th
995, 1009 [where moving party seeks to strike an entire cause of action
alleging multiple factual bases, court does not determine whether 1st
step is met based on “gravamen” test; but rather must determine whether each
factual bases supplies the element of claim or merely provides
context].)  
 
 
I.               
1st
Step of Anti-SLAPP Analysis – Defendants burden that claim arises from
Defendants Constitutionally Protected Speech.
 
            On the first step of
the anti-SLAPP analysis , “courts are to consider the elements of the
challenged claim and what actions by the defendant supply those elements and
consequently form the basis for liability.  The defendant’s burden is to
identify what acts each challenged claim rests on and to show how those acts
are protected under a statutorily defined category of protected
activity.”  (Bonni, supra, 11 Cal.5th at p. 1009.)
 
            “First, the moving defendant must
show that the challenged claim or claims arise from the defendant's
constitutionally protected free speech or petition rights. (Ojjeh v. Brown
(2019) 43 Cal.App.5th 1027, 1035.) A defendant has the “burden of identifying
all allegations of protected activity” on the 1st prong of
SLAPP.”  (Bel Air Internet, LLC v. Morales (2018) 20 Cal.App.5th
924, 936-937.)  Defendant only meets this burden by demonstrating that the
act underlying the plaintiff’s cause of action “fits one of the categories
spelled out in section 425.16, subdivision (e).”  (Sprengel v. Zbylut
(2015) 241 Cal.App.4th 140, 150.)
 
            Defendant Jay Levine (“Levine”) shows
that Plaintiff Adam J. Tenser’s (“Tenser”) claims arise from the content and
dissemination of the Program, thus the claims arise from constitutionally protected
speech within the broad scope of CCP § 425.16. (Motion, p. 16.) 
Specifically,
the Court finds that Tenser’s claims the arise from constitutionally protected
speech, specifically within CCP § 425.16(e)(4), the subsection which applies to
“conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right … of free
speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 425.16, subs., (e)(4).)
 
            Within each of the causes of action
in FAC, Tenser alleges the claims specifically arise from the creation and distribution
of the Program. (See FAC, ¶ 25 [privacy claim based on “us[e] and authorizing
use of [Plaintiff’s] identity” in the Program]; FAC, ¶ 38 [fraud claim
purporting to arise from posting of Program on YouTube, and for “assigning or licensing”
the Program]; FAC,  ¶ 47 [alleging
Defendants engaged in unfair competition by using Plaintiff’s “name, voice and
photograph” in the Program “for commercial exploitation”].) The Program’s
content focused on the reporting of a high-profile criminal case including
comments made by Tenser, a long-time friend and legal representative of the
accused. (FAC, ¶ 12, 14; Exh., 1–5.) “[N]ews reporting is free speech,”
for the purposes of the SLAPP statute. (Sipple v. Found. For Nat’l Progress
(1999) 71 Cal. App. 4th 226, 240; see also Lieberman v. KCOP Television,
Inc. (2003) 110 Cal.App.4th 156, 164 [“News reports concerning current
criminal activity serve important public interests.”].) 
 
            Tenser’s status as a non-celebrity,
or not holding himself out as a public figure as claimed in the FAC ¶¶ 13 and
17 is irrelevant, since Levine is “not required to show a specific public
interest” in Tenser. (Doe v. Gangland Productions, Inc. (9th Cir. 2013)
730 F.3d 946, 955; see also Tamkin v. CBS Broadcasting, Inc. (2011) 193
Cal.App.4th 133, 144 [finding “no requirement in the anti-SLAPP statute that
the plaintiff's persona be a matter of public interest.”] Furthermore, the high-profile
criminal was extensively covered by the media, including new reports about
Tenser, thus demonstrating public interest in the matter. (See Exhs. 4–5; Cross
v. Cooper (2011) 197 Cal.App.4th 357, 378 fn. 13, as modified on denial
of reh'g (Aug. 4, 2011) [“extensive media coverage” of speech established
public interest]; Sipple, supra, 71 Cal. App. 4th at 238–39 [“public
interest can be ‘evidenced by media coverage’”].)
 
            Thus, Levine has met the SLAPP
statute first prong burden of establishing Tenser’s claims arise from
constitutionally protected speech.
 
II.            
2nd
Step of Anti-SLAPP Analysis – Plaintiff’s Burden to probability of prevailing
on the claims
 
            Once defendant demonstrates that a
cause of action arises from protected conduct, the plaintiff must demonstrate
that the complaint is both legally sufficient and supported by a sufficient
prima facie showing of facts to sustain a favorable judgment if the evidence
submitted by the plaintiff is credited.  (Navellier v. Sletten
(2002) 29 Cal.4th 82, 88–89.)  “Precisely because the statute (1) permits
early intervention in lawsuits alleging unmeritorious causes of action that
implicate free speech concerns, and (2) limits opportunity to conduct
discovery, the plaintiff's burden of establishing a probability of prevailing
is not high: We do not weigh credibility, nor do we evaluate the weight of the
evidence. Instead, we accept as true all evidence favorable to the plaintiff
and assess the defendant's evidence only to determine if it defeats the
plaintiff's submission as a matter of law.  Only a cause of action that
lacks ‘even minimal merit' constitutes SLAPP.”  (Overstock.com, Inc. v.
Gradient Analytics, Inc. (2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 688, 699.)
 
            “The second prong of the statute
deals with whether the plaintiff has “demonstrated a probability of prevailing
on the claim.  Under section 425.16, subdivision (b)(2), the superior
court, in making these determinations, considers ‘the pleadings, and supporting
and opposing affidavits stating the facts upon which the liability or defense
is based.’ For purposes of an anti-SLAPP motion, the court considers the
pleadings and evidence submitted by both sides, but does not weigh credibility
or compare the weight of the evidence. Rather, the court's responsibility is to
accept as true the evidence favorable to the plaintiff.  A plaintiff need
only establish that his or her claim has minimal merit to avoid being stricken
as a SLAPP.  With these descriptions in mind, we will not strike a cause
of action under the anti-SLAPP statute unless it lacks even minimal
merit.”  (Ralphs Grocery Co. v. Victory Consultants, Inc. (2017) 17
Cal.App.5th 245, 261.)
 
            The “probability of prevailing” is
tested by the same standard governing a motion for summary judgment, nonsuit,
or directed verdict.  Thus, in opposing a SLAPP motion, it is plaintiff's
burden to make a prima facie showing of facts that would support a judgment in
plaintiff's favor.  (Crossroads Investors, L.P. v. Federal National
Mortgage Assn. (2017) 13 Cal.App.5th 757, 785; Taus v. Loftus
(2007) 40 Cal.4th 683, 714 [a “summary-judgment-like
procedure”].)     
 
            To meet the burden of the SLAPP’s
second prong, Tenser is statutorily required to show “competent and admissible
evidence, that [he] would probably prevail on,” on his claims. (Macias v.
Hartwell (1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 669, 675; see CCP § 425.16, subd. (b).)  Tenser did not file an opposition and thus does
not supply any admissible evidence to substantiate any his claims. 
 
            Regardless, from the pleadings alone
to determine whether Tenser has failed to show a probability of prevailing on
his claims. (see CCP § 425.16, subd., (b)(2).) The Court finds that since the
Program is an undisputed “expressive work” the First Amendment bars all
Tenser’s claims. “Under the First Amendment, a cause of action for
appropriation of another's “name and likeness may not be maintained” against
“expressive works, whether factual or fictional.” (Daly v. Viacom, Inc.
(N.D. Cal. 2002) 238 F.Supp.2d 1118, 1123; see Guglielmi v.
Spelling-Goldberg Prods. (1979) 25 Cal. 3d. 860, 871–72 (Bird, J.
concurring) [“Whether the publication involved was factual and biographical or
fictional, the right of publicity has not been held to outweigh the value of
free expression.”] Tenser’s claims arise from the
alleged appropriation and distribution of his name and likeness within the
Program, and thus all claims have no probability of prevailing. Furthermore, Levine
had no duty to obtain a written clearance from Tensor as claimed by Tensor in
the FAC. (See De Havilland v. FX Networks, LLC (2018) 21 Cal.App.5th
845, 861 [“First Amendment simply does not require such acquisition agreements”].)
 
 
            In
addition, Tenser does not allege any specific wrongful conduct or facts as to
Levine in relation to the causes of action in the FAC. Thus, the FACs claims fail
as to Levine without any evidence or specific factual allegations supplied by
Tenser to show a substantial probability of prevailing on the claims. (See United
States Liab. Ins. Co. v. Haidinger-Hayes, Inc. (1970) 1 Cal.3d 586, 594 [“Directors
or officers of a corporation do not incur personal liability for torts of the
corporation merely by reason of their official position, unless they
participate in the wrong or authorize or direct that it be done”].) Tenser’s conclusory
allegations that Levine “ratified” the companies’ alleged tortious conduct by
“failing to correct” it, is not enough to reach a substantial probability of
prevailing. (FAC, ¶¶ 16, 32, 44.)
 
            The
Court finds Tensor has not met his burden to prove the probability of
prevailing on his claims. Thus, Levine’s SLAPP motion is GRANTED on all claims
in the FAC as to Levine. 4-23-24
22SMCV01153 Tenser Motion for Choice of Law Plaintiff Adam J. Tenser's Motion for Choice of
Law as to the 3rd Cause of Action in the Complaint is DENIED and MOOT.
Plaintiff filed the motion on 1-29-24, and Defendants GNH Productions Inc.,
Telepictures Productions Inc., Warner Horizon Television Inc., and Warner Bros.
Home Entertainment Inc. (collectively, “Warner Defendants”) filed an opposition
on 4-10-24. Plaintiff's third cause of action was brought only against Warner
Defendants. (See FAC, pp. 14–15.) The Warner Defendants SLAPP motion was granted
on 1-25-24, with a judgement in favor of Warner Defendants signed and filed on
2-20-24, dismissing the Warner Defendants from the FAC with prejudice. (See
1-25-24 Minute Order; 2-20-24 Judgment.) Thus, Plaintiff's Motion for choice of
law is untimely and moot, as the Court has ordered the claims dismissed as to
the Warner Defendants and the third cause of action is not named against any
remaining Defendants.
