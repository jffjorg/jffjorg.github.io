```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has sustained the defendants' demurrer to the plaintiff's entire complaint without leave to amend. The plaintiff has failed to provide sufficient proof of abandonment of her bankruptcy claims, as required by the court's previous order. The plaintiff's attempt to rely on an email as evidence of abandonment is insufficient, as it is hearsay and has not been authenticated. The plaintiff has also failed to take the necessary procedural steps to demonstrate abandonment, as required by Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 6007. As a result, the plaintiff lacks standing to pursue her claims. The motion to strike is moot, as the demurrer has been sustained. The defendants are ordered to give notice of the ruling.
