Minor’s
Compromise
 
RULING: Petition for
minor’s compromise is approved.
 
SUMMARY
OF ACTION
This
is a wrongful death case wherein the father of Plaintiff Brayan Antunez was
killed in an automobile accident. On December 4, 2023, Plaintiff, through his
guardian ad litem Griselda Cabrera Gonzalez, filed his complaint.
 
On July 5, 2024, Petitioner submitted an amended petition
for approval of minor’s compromise on behalf of Brayan Antunez (15) for a settlement
with Defendant Outdoor Go Construction for a total of $250,000.00. Petitioner
represents total deductions of $88,447.34 as follows: $62,500.00 in attorney
fees, and $25,947.34 for expenses; thereby leaving a net balance of $161,552.66.
 
The settlement exceeds $5,000 and the payment will therefore
be deposited into a blocked account. (Probate Code §§ 3610, 3611(b).)
 
The Minor’s Compromise can be
approved. The petition was filed on the MC-350 form. However, no proposed order
form MC-351 was filed, so the Court will order Petitioner to submit this form
before the compromise is finalized. The petition also complies with CCP § 372;
Probate Code §§ 3500, 3600-3613; and Cal. Rules of Court Rules 3.1384, 7.101,
7.950-7.952.
 
CONCLUSION
The Court approves the Petition to
Confirm Minor’s Compromise filed on behalf of Brayan Antunez. The Court orders the
Petitioner to submit a proposed order on form MC-351.
 
The Court will also set a hearing to verify the deposit of
funds into the blocked account.
