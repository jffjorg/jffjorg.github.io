**English Summary:**

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the Plaintiff's motion to deem the Defendant's answers to Requests for Admissions (RFAs) as admitted.  The Defendant failed to provide timely, verified responses to the RFAs, despite extensions granted by the Plaintiff.  Because the Defendant's responses were unsworn and unverified, the Judge considers them as no response at all.

As a result, the Court will rule that the matters contained in the RFAs are deemed admitted, meaning the Defendant cannot dispute those facts in court. The Judge also awards the Plaintiff $460.00 in sanctions for the Defendant's failure to comply with the discovery process.
