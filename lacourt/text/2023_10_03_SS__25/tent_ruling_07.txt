I.               
Background
 
On February 14, 2022, Plaintiff
Western Surety Company (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint for interpleader against
Defendants Marleen Navarro, Melita Montgomery, Miguel Llaneras, Mark Lanie, and
Does 1 through 50. 
 
Defendant Melita Montgomery filed
an Answer to the Complaint on May 16, 2023 and Defendant Marleen Navarro filed
an Answer to the Complaint on May 30, 2023 respectively. 
 
On July 12, 2023, Plaintiff filed
the instant Motion to Deposit Funds, Exoneration of Surety Bond, and for
Attorney’s Fees (“Motion”). On September 26, 2023, Plaintiff filed a
Notice of Non-Opposition to its Motion to Deposit Funds, Exoneration of Surety
Bond, and for Attorney’s Fees and Costs.
 
II.             
Legal Standard 
 
Interpleader is a procedure
whereby a person holding money or personal property to which conflicting claims
are being made by others, can join the adverse claimants and force them to
litigate their claims among themselves.  (See Code of Civ. Proc. §
386; Hancock Oil Co. v. Hopkins (1944) 24 Cal. 2d 497, 508; City of
Morgan Hill v. Brown (1999) 71 Cal.App.4th 1114, 1122-23.) 
 
Once
the stakeholder’s right to interplead is established, and he or she deposits
the money or personal property in court, he or she may be discharged from
liability to any of the claimants.  This enables the stakeholder to avoid
a multiplicity of actions, and the risk of inconsistent results if each of the
claimants were to sue him or her separately.  (Cantu v. Resolution
Trust Corp. (1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 857, 874; City of Morgan Hill, supra,
71 Cal.App.4th at 1122.) 
 
“An interpleader action is
traditionally viewed as two suits: one between the stakeholder and the
claimants to determine the stakeholder's right to interplead, and the other
among the claimants to determine who shall receive the funds interpleaded ...
As against the stakeholder, claimants may raise only matters which go to
whether the suit is properly one for interpleader; i.e., whether the elements
of an interpleader action are present.”  (State Farm Fire & Cas.
Co. v. Pietak (2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 600, 612.) 
 
If the defendant stakeholder
claims no interest in the funds or property held, he or she need not file an
interpleader cross-complaint.  He or she may simply apply to the court for
permission to deposit the money or property with the court clerk, and for an
order discharging him or her from further liability to the adverse
claimants.  Such order will also substitute the adverse claimants as
parties to the action; or, if only money is involved, simply dismiss the
stakeholder.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 386(a), 386.5.)  The motion must
be supported by an affidavit by the stakeholder establishing the ground for
interpleader.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 386(a).)  The supporting
affidavit must also state that the moving party is “a mere stakeholder with no
interest in the amount or any portion thereof and that conflicting demands have
been made upon him for the amount by parties to the action…” (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 386.5.)  Notice of the motion must be served on each of the adverse
claimants to the funds or property.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 386(a), 386.5.) 
“Where a deposit has been made pursuant to Section 386, the court shall, upon
the application of any party to the action, order such deposit to be invested
in an insured interest-bearing account.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 386.1.) 
 
Pursuant to § 386(f), the court “may enter its order
restraining all parties to the action from instituting or further prosecuting
any other proceeding in any court in this state affecting the rights and
obligations as between the parties to the interpleader until further order of
the court.”  (Cal. Civ. Proc. § 386(f).) 
 
The stakeholder may seek
reimbursement for its costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 386.6; UAPColumbus JV 326132 v. Nesbitt (1991) 234
Cal.App.3d 1028, 1036.)  The court may order payment thereof out of the
funds deposited by the stakeholder. (Code Civ. Proc., § 386.6.) 
 
III.           
Discussion 
 
The subject matter of the instant
Motion is a $25,000 bond issued to Blue Line Construction Pros Inc. as
principal and the Contractors State License Board as obligee. (Complaint ¶ 7.)
 
Plaintiff filed a verified
Complaint in Interpleader naming the claimants to the bond – Marleen Navarro, Melita
Montgomery, Miguel Llaneras, Mark Lanie, and Does 1 through 50. (Complaint
at ¶8.)
Plaintiff contends that it “cannot determine which claim or claims take
priority, and is exposed to liability in excess of the penal sum of the bond.” (Dibashi
Decl. ¶6.) Defendants have made claims in excess of the bond funds. (Id.
at ¶5.) Plaintiff is a stakeholder with no interest in the amount or any
portion of the bond. (Id. at ¶6.) With no other alternative, Plaintiff
filed its Complaint for Interpleader. (Complaint, Lee Decl. ¶3.) Plaintiff
requests permission from the Court to deposit the subject bond funds to allow
the Court to determine their proper distribution. (Dibashi Decl. ¶7.) Plaintiff
also requests the Court to exonerate the bond and prevent Plaintiff from
continuing to incur further unnecessary attorneys’ fees and costs in connection
to the Interpleader of these funds. (Id.)
 
The Court finds that Plaintiff has
satisfied all requirements for the instant Motion. Thus, Plaintiff is
entitled to be dismissed once it deposits the funds with the clerk of the
Court.  Furthermore, Plaintiff is entitled to an order restraining all
parties “from instituting or further prosecuting any other proceeding” related
to Plaintiff’s rights and obligations under the bond. Plaintiff’s unopposed motion for an order exonerating the
bond and directing release of the bond to Plaintiff is also granted. The bond
is no longer necessary and/or warranted. 
 
B.             
Attorney’s
Fees and Costs 
 
The stakeholder may seek
reimbursement for its costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred. 
(Code Civ. Proc. § 386.6; UAPColumbus JV 326132 v. Nesbitt (1991) 234
Cal.App.3d 1028, 1036.)  The court may order payment thereof out of the
funds deposited by the stakeholder.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 386.6.) 
 
Plaintiff requests $4,484.67 in
attorney’s fees and costs related to the interpleader.  Plaintiff has
incurred attorney fees in the amount of $3,952.00 in connection to the filing
of the Interpleader action. (Dibashi Decl. ¶6.) The costs are as follows: $532.67
in filing fees, $0 in service fees. (Dibashi Decl. ¶8., Lee
Decl. ¶5.) Plaintiff’s counsel’s billing rate is $245 per hour. (Lee Decl. ¶6.)
Plaintiff’s counsel services
included 14.2 hours of attorney time related to the Interpleader. (Dibashi
Decl. ¶6.) Plaintiff anticipates incurring an additional 2 hours, $490.00 to
review the opposition, draft a reply, appear at the hearing and complete the
deposit of the bond funds. (Lee Decl. ¶6.) However, no opposition is filed so a reduction of attorney’s fees for Counsel is warranted. As such, the Court is inclined to find that Plainitff’s
counsel will spend one hour attending the hearing on this motion and completing
the deposit of the bond funds. Accordingly,
the reward is reduced by 1 hour or $4,239.67.
 
The Court finds the request to be
reasonable and awards attorney’s fees and costs of $4,239.67, to be
deducted from the interpleader funds prior to their deposit with the Court,
resulting in a net deposit of $20,760.33. 
 
IV.           
Conclusion & Order
 
Plaintiff’s Motion to Deposit Funds, Exoneration of Surety Bond, and
for Attorney’s Fees and Costs is GRANTED,
contingent on Plaintiff’s deposit of funds with the Court in the amount of
$20,760.33.  Interpleader funds of $20,760.33 are to be deposited within
ten (10) days of receipt of this order. 
 
Moving party is
ordered to give notice.
