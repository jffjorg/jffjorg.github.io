  Case Number:  20STLC02682    Hearing Date:   October 3, 2023    Dept:  25  Toby Lee Jones v. Maya Kim Kuriel, et al.  20STLC02682ANALYSIS:
 
I.               
Background
 
On March 18, 2020, Plaintiff Toby
Lee Jones (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Defendants Maya Kim Kuriel,
Yaacov Kuriel and Jee Kuriel (“Defendants”) arising out of a motor vehicle
accident between Plaintiff and Defendants.
 
On May 16, 2023, Defendants served
Form Interrogatories (Set One) on Plaintiff. Plaintiff did not respond to
Defendants’ Form Interrogatories (Set One). 
 
On July 31, 2023, Defendants filed
this motion to compel Plaintiff’s responses to Form Interrogatories (Set One)
and request for sanctions. 
 
II.             
Legal Standard 
If
a party to whom interrogatories or an inspection demand were directed fails to
serve a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order compelling
responses without objections. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (b),
2031.300, subd. (b).) Moreover, failure to timely serve responses waives
objections to the requests. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (a), 2031.300,
subd. (a).) Failure to verify a response is equivalent to no response at all.
(Appleton v. Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 632, 636.) If the court finds
that a party has unsuccessfully made or opposed such a motion, the court “shall
impose a monetary sanction . . . unless it finds that the one subject to the
sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make
the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd.
(c), 2031.300, subd. (c).)
Further,
CCP § 2033.280(b) states that if a party to who request for admissions are
directed fails to serve a timely response, “[t]he requesting party may move for
an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters
specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction
under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010).” The court shall issue this
order unless the party to whom the request was made serves a response in
substantial compliance prior to the hearing on the motion. CCP § 2033.280(c).

Discussion 
 
Form Interrogatories 
The
Court notes that Plaintiff’s failure to respond to the Form Interrogatories
waives all objections. (C.C.P. §§2030.290.) Plaintiff did not timely serve
responses to the Form Interrogatories served on May 16, 2023. (Motion, Ex. A.) Although
not required, on June 26, 2023, Defendant sent Plaintiff a meet and confer
letter requesting responses to Defendant’s Form Interrogatories. (Motion, Ex. B,
Rickett Decl. ¶3.)
Because
Plaintiff was properly served with the Form Interrogatories and failed to respond
or oppose this motion, the motion to compel Plaintiff’s responses to the Form
Interrogatories without objections is granted.
Sanctions
 
The Court
shall issue monetary sanctions for reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred in
connection with bringing the motions. (C.C.P. §§2030.290(c), 2031.300(c).)
Regardless if Defendants served responses to Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatories
(Set One) well before the hearing date, Plaintiff is entitled to monetary
sanctions. See Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 407; CRC 3.1348(a) (holding that
the court may award sanctions despite that the requested discovery was provided
after the filing of the motion).)
Defendants
request a total sanctions award of $572.00 based on the attorney’s fees of
$532.00 and filing fee in the amount of $40.00. Defendants’ counsel claims he
spent 2 hours in preparing the motion and anticipates spending another 2 hours
in travel and attendance at the hearing. Defendants’ counsel charges an hourly
rate of $133.00 per hour. Counsel’s billable rate of $133.00 per hour is
reasonable. The Court finds that Defendants’ counsel’s
attorney fees are reasonably incurred. Accordingly,
The Court will impose monetary sanctions against Plaintiff in the total amount
of $572.00.
 
IV.           
Conclusion & Order
 
Defendants
Motion to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, is granted. Plaintiff is ordered to serve code-compliant responses to
the Form Interrogatory without objections.
Defendants’
request for monetary sanctions against Plaintiff is granted in the total amount
of $572.00. Plaintiff is to pay $572.00 to Defendants, by and through counsel
for Defendant, within 20 days of notice of the Court’s order.
Defendants
are ordered to provide notice of the Court’s order and file a proof of service
of such.
