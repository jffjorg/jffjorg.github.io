English text: 

The tentative ruling is for case number 20STLC03019, with a hearing date of October 3, 2023, in Department 25 at the Spring Street Courthouse. The case involves Manhattan Floor Covering, Inc. dba SERVPRO of Redondo Beach (the plaintiff or MFC) and Maureen McCool (the defendant). 

The plaintiff filed a complaint against the defendant on April 3, 2020, alleging breach of contract, open book account, and account stated. The defendant filed an Answer to the Complaint on May 21, 2020. The defendant was granted leave to file a Cross-Complaint against MFC and Interinsurance Exchange on July 1, 2021. The Cross-Complaint was filed on April 22, 2021, asserting eight causes of action. The case was reclassified as a civil unlimited matter on March 30, 2023. 

MFC seeks sanctions against the defendant in the amount of $2,500.00 for abusive and intolerable conduct. However, MFC did not provide a declaration supporting the amount of sanctions sought, and the Court finds that MFC is not seeking sanctions because of actions involving motions or pleadings filed by the defendant. Moreover, the plaintiff's claims that the defendant attempted to re-open discovery are unfounded. 

The Court finds that the defendant has failed to show that the defendant engaged in frivolous tactics and denies MFC's request for sanctions against the defendant.
