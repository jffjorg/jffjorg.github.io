English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for sanctions filed by Manhattan Floor Covering, Inc. (MFC) against Maureen McCool. MFC alleges that McCool engaged in frivolous and abusive conduct, including sending offensive emails to counsel for MFC and Cross-Defendant, threatening to file complaints with the California State Bar and contact the media, and directing her conduct towards the wife of counsel for Cross-Defendant and stalking Cross-Defendant's family on social media. The Court finds that MFC's claims are not supported by evidence and that MFC has not filed any motions or responsive pleadings that relate to the alleged bad faith actions. Therefore, the Court denies MFC's motion for sanctions.
