Legal Standard 
 
Deem Requests for Admissions Admitted 
 
Where there has been no timely response to requests for admissions,
a “requesting party may move for an order that the genuineness of any documents
and the truth of any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as
well as for a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with section
2023.010).”  The court “shall” grant the motion to deem requests for
admission admitted “unless it finds that the party to whom the requests for
admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a
proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial
compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280(c).) 
 
Sanctions 
 
Sanctions may be imposed for
misuse of discovery process. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (a). ) Failing to
respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery constitutes a misuse
of the discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d).) Sanctions
are mandatory in connection with a motion to deem matters specified in a
request for admissions as true and motions to compel responses to
interrogatories and requests for production of documents against any party,
person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel
unless the court “finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290(c), 2031.300(c),
2033.280(c).)¿ 
 
Discussion 
 
Plaintiff moves to deem its Request for Admissions admitted
as to Defendant.  
 
Plaintiff
is entitled to an order deeming its Request for Admissions admitted. Plaintiff
supports its claims with a declaration from Counsel. On
December 20, 2022, Plaintiff served Defendant with Request for Admissions, Set
One, by email.  (Espinosa Decl., ¶
1.)  The parties talked and multiple
extensions were granted, with responses being ultimately due on May 10, 2023.
(Espinosa Decl., ¶ 3.)
On May 10,
2023, Defendant served unverified responses. (Espinosa Decl., ¶ 4; Exh. B.)
Unsworn and unverified responses are tantamount to no responses at all.  (Appleton v. Superior Court (1988) 206
Cal.App.3d 632, 636.) On June 6, 2023, Plaintiff sent a meet and confer letter
in an attempt to get verified responses. 
(Espinosa Decl., ¶ 5; Exh. C.) An extension was granted making responses
due on July 5, 2023.  (Espinosa Decl., ¶ 6.) However, no verified responses were sent to
Plaintiff. (Espinosa Decl., ¶ 7.)
Because Defendant has not sent verified responses to Plaintiff’s
Request for Admissions, Plaintiff’s motion is granted. The genuineness of any
documents and the truth of any matters specified in Plaintiff’s motion is
admitted.   
 
Sanctions with
respect to motions to deem requests for admissions admitted are mandatory if a
party to whom the requests for admissions have been directed failed to serve a
timely response to the request for admission. (Code Civ. Proc., §2033.280(c).)
Here, sanctions are mandatory because Defendant failed to serve timely
responses to Plaintiff’s RFAs.  Plaintiff
seeks $460.00 in sanctions for two hours of attorney time at $200.00/per hour
and filing fees of $60.00. 
 
The Court finds
the requested sanctions reasonable and awards the full amount of $460.00
requested.
 
Conclusion 
 
The Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion to deem Request for
Admissions admitted as to Defendant. 
 
The Court GRANTS sanctions in the total amount of $460.00.  
 
Moving party is
to give notice of this ruling.¿¿
