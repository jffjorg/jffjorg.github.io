Summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is to continue the Petition to Confirm Contractual Arbitration Award filed by Keith Simpson (Petitioner) against Sharon Valk (Respondent) to a future date due to several issues. The Petitioner failed to comply with the filing requirements of Section 1285.4, service requirements of Section 1290.4, and requirements of Sections 1283.6, 1288, and 1288.4. The Judge orders the Petitioner to file and serve supplemental papers addressing the issues noted within 16 court days before the next scheduled hearing. Failure to do so may result in the Petition being placed off calendar or denied.
