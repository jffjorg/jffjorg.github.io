The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Keith Simpson v. Sharon Valk, regarding a petition to confirm an arbitration award. The arbitrator awarded Petitioner damages of $14,643.21 to be paid by Respondent. However, the Petitioner failed to satisfy the filing requirements of Section 1285.4, as they did not set forth the substance of the agreement to arbitrate or attach a copy of the agreement. Additionally, the service requirements of Section 1290.4 were not satisfied, as the Petitioner did not demonstrate proper service via mail and acknowledgment. Finally, the arbitration award was not properly served, as the arbitrator did not provide proof of service or any other indication demonstrating the award was served on the parties.

As a result, the judge has ordered the Petition to be continued to November 7, 2023, and requires the Petitioner to file and serve supplemental papers addressing the issues noted herein. Failure to do so may result in the Petition being placed off calendar or denied.
