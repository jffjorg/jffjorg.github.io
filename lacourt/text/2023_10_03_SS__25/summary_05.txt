And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Keith Simpson v. Sharon Valk, case number 23STCP01874. The case concerns the confirmation of an arbitration award issued by Tamila C. Jenson, the arbitrator, on April 6, 2023. The award awarded damages of $14,643.21 to be paid by Respondent Sharon Valk.

The court has determined that the petition to confirm the arbitration award has not been properly filed, as the petitioner failed to provide a copy of the agreement to arbitrate and did not demonstrate proper service of the petition and notice of hearing. The court has also determined that the arbitrator did not properly serve the award on the parties, and therefore, the service requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 1283.6 have not been satisfied.

The court has continued the hearing to November 7, 2023, at 10:00 a.m. in Department 25 of the Spring Street Courthouse. The petitioner must file and serve supplemental papers addressing the issues noted herein at least 16 court days before the next scheduled hearing. Failure to do so may result in the petition being placed off calendar or denied.
