 Case Number:  21STCV30090    Hearing Date:   October 31, 2023    Dept:  31 DEPT:  31 HEARING DATE: 10/31/2023 CASE NAME/NUMBER: 21STCV30090 PETER YORCK, et al. vs SHAHRAD MIZRAHI, et al. PETITION TO APPROVE COMPROMISE OF PENDING ACTION OF A MINOR Lillian Yorck, Age 3 RECOMMENDATION: DENY  TENTATIVE¿ ¿ The Court excuses the personal appearance of Claimant and the guardian ad litem. Counsel may appear by telephone or video conference call.¿  The Court previously reviewed the Petition to Approve Compromise for the settlement between Plaintiffs and Defendants and found it fair and reasonable. The Court also found the attorney’s fees in the amount of 25% for Claimant’s settlement to be fair and reasonable.  Thereafter, Claimant demanded payment from Claimant’s Underinsured Motorist (UIM) Carrier, USAA, for the difference between the coverage limit and the previously approved settlement. If the UIM settlement is approved, $15,000 will be used for attorney’s fees, and $3,500 will be used for medical expenses. The net balance of $41,500 will be deposited into a blocked account.  Petitioner again files an expedited Petition to Approve Compromise of Pending Action of a Minor pertaining to the settlement with Claimant’s Underinsured Motorist (“UIM”) claim with the insurance carrier, USAA. The Court previously rejected the petition because an expedited petition is permissible only if the total settlement is less than $50,000 or represents the insurance policy limits. (Min. Order, July 17, 2023.) Petitioner must either show the settlement represents the insurance policy limits, or not use an expedited petition form. (Ibid.)  Petitioner has not demonstrated that the $60,000 settlement amount is the policy limit. Rather, Petitioner provides that the UIM coverage limit is $100,000. Therefore, the use of MC-350EX is improper. Petitioner was informed of the limits of an expedited petition form both on July 17, 2023 and on October 25, 2023, yet persists on using a MC-350EX form, arguing that because this is a UIM settlement for the difference between the policy limit and what was paid in the underlying settlement, that therefore the settlement meets the criteria for MC-350EX filing.  CRC, Rule 7.950.5(a)(8) and (9) provide, in relevant part, that to meet the authorized use of a petition for expedited approval:   “The judgment for the minor or claimant with a disability (exclusive of interest and costs) or the total amount payable to the minor or claimant with a disability and all other parties under the proposed compromise or settlement is $50,000 or less or, if greater:   (A)  The total amount payable to the minor or claimant with a disability represents payment of the individual-person policy limits of all liability insurance policies covering all proposed contributing parties; and  (B)  All proposed contributing parties would be substantially unable to discharge an adverse judgment on the claim from assets other than the proceeds of their liability insurance policies; and  (9)  The court does not otherwise order.”   As previously stated, since the proposed settlement is greater than $50,000, the total payable to the minor must represent the policy limits for use of MC-350EX to be proper. Nowhere in CRC, Rule 7.950.5 does it provide an additional exception because this is a UIM settlement related to an underlying claim previously approved, or an exception based on funds available from the ultimate policy limit cap. Petitioner is not being paid the UIM policy limit of $100,000 nor did the parties settle for the full $100,000 policy coverage limit. Rather, claimant is being paid the difference between the UIM policy limit and what was paid on the underlying settlement.   At the October 25, 2023 hearing on this matter, Counsel asserted that the use of MC-350EX was in fact proper, and that only minor changes were needed to the form. However, the Court now comes to the same conclusion as it did previously. Court instructs Petitioner to file a new petition by making use MC-350 [Rev. January 1, 2021], instead of on MC-350EX.  Furthermore, the Court notes that on Item 19b, Petitioner indicates that the net balance of $41,500 will be delivered directly to both the guardian of the estate of the minor and $41,500 will be deposited into a blocked account. This is clearly erroneous. Either $41,500, which represents the net settlement amount, is going to the guardian or to a blocked account, not both. It appears that the intention is for the net settlement to be deposited into a blocked account with financial institution JP Morgan Chase Bank. Petitioner must checkmark the single box that applies on the appropriate form.   Moving party is ordered to give notice.
