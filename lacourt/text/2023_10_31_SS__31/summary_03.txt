And here is the English-text summary:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling denying the expedited petition to approve the compromise of the pending action of a minor, Lillian Yorck. The Court previously reviewed the petition and found the settlement between the Plaintiffs and Defendants to be fair and reasonable. However, the Court finds that the expedited petition is not proper because the settlement amount of $60,000 is greater than the $50,000 limit for an expedited petition. The Court instructs the Petitioner to file a new petition using the correct form, MC-350 [Rev. January 1, 2021]. Additionally, the Court notes that the Petitioner must correct Item 19b of the petition to indicate that the net settlement amount will be deposited into a blocked account with JP Morgan Chase Bank, rather than split between the guardian of the estate and a blocked account.
