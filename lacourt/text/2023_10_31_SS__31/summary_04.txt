And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to compel responses to discovery requests propounded on December 9, 2022. The defendant had requested verified responses without objections, but the plaintiff served objection responses instead. The judge finds that the defendant should have brought a motion to compel further after engaging in an informal discovery conference, rather than a motion to compel. The judge also denies the defendant's request for sanctions. The parties are encouraged to meet and confer to reach an agreement, and if a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling, they must send an email to the court with the case number, hearing date and time, counsel's contact information, and the identity of the party submitting.
