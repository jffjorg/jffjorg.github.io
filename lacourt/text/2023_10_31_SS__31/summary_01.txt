The plaintiff had reached a settlement with the defendant for $47,500 in April 2023, but has not received the settlement check. The judge ruled that there was no evidence of a written settlement agreement signed by both parties, as required by CCP § 664.6. The judge noted that strict compliance with the statutory requirements is necessary to enforce a settlement agreement under this statute. The court will give notice to the parties and will consider whether to take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the court.
