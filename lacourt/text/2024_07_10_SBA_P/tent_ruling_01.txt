Minor went to the emergency room for treatment and stayed in the hospital for three days. Minor will have a permanent scar on her right arm, where the dog bit her, but there is no nerve damage. Petitioner Michael Shao, minor claimant’s father and guardian ad litem, petitions for approval of a prelitigation compromise of minor claimant’s claim in the amount of $300,000 from Samuel T. Baker via Safeco Insurance. Of the settlement amount, $1,750 will go to reimbursement or payment of medical expenses, $60,000 will go to attorney’s fees and $1,250 will go to costs. The balance of the proceeds($237,000) will be invested in a single-premium deferred annuity, subject to withdrawal only on authorization of the court. There are no medical liens outstanding.LEGAL AUTHORITYCourt approval is required for all settlements of a minor’s claim. (Prob. Code §§ 3500, 3600, et seq.; CCP § 372.) “[W]ithout trial court approval of the proposed compromise of the ward’s claim, the settlement cannot be valid. Nor is the settlement binding [on the minor] until it is endorsed by the trial court.” (Pearson v. Superior Court (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th 1333, 1338.) A minor, “shall appear either by a guardian or conservator of the estate or by guardian ad litem appointed by the court in which the action or proceeding is pending, or by a judge thereof, in each case.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 372, subd. (a)(1).) Alternatively, the petitioner may file a declaration demonstrating that he or she has a right to compromise the minor’s claim under Cal. Probate Code Section 3500.CCP § 372 and CRC 7.950 and 7.952 do not require a noticed motion and adversary hearing on a petition to approve compromise of a minor's claim. It would thus “appear that a petition to approve or disapprove a minor's compromise may be decided by the superior court, ex parte, in chambers.” (Pearson v. Sup.Ct. (Nicholson) (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th 1333, 1337-1338, fn. 2.)Regarding the substance of the Petition, to obtain court approval of the settlement of a minor’s claims, the petitioner must file a complete and “verified petition for approval of the settlement and must disclose ‘all information that has any bearing upon the reasonableness of the compromise.’” (Barnes v. Western Heritage Ins. Co. (2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 249, 256); (CRC 7.950.)A petition for court approval of a compromise or covenant not to sue under Code of Civil Procedure section 372 must comply with California Rules of Court, rules 7.950, 7.951 and 7.952. The petition must be verified by the petitioner and contain a full disclosure of all information that has “any bearing upon the reasonableness” of the compromise, covenant, settlement, or disposition. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.950.) The person compromising the claim on behalf of the minor or person who lacks capacity, and the represented person, must attend the hearing on compromise of the claim unless the court for good cause dispenses with their personal appearance. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.952.) An order for deposit of funds of a minor or person lacking decision making capacity and a petition for the withdrawal of such funds must complywith California Rules of Court, rules 7.953 and 7.954. (Cal. Rules of Court 3.1384; see also Super. Ct. L.A. County, Local Rules, rules 4.115-4.118.)DISCUSSIONPetitioner Michael Shao submits the required Mandatory Judicial Counsel Forms MC-350 (Petition), MC-251 (Order Approving Minor’s Compromise) and MC-355 (Order to Deposit Funds into Blocked Account) on behalf of his minor child, Shiyu Shao.

However, Counsel fails to submit a declaration explaining the basis for the request for fees, including a discussion of applicable factors listed in California Rules of Court Rule 7.955(b).
