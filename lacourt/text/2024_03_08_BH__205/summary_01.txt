And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the plaintiff, TRAVEL, ENTERTAINMENT, MARKETING LLC, in its motion for terminating sanctions and monetary sanctions against the defendant, BRIAN DELINO, et al. The defendant had failed to respond to discovery requests and disobeyed a court order, which the judge found to be willful and in bad faith.

The judge has struck the defendant's answer and cross-complaint, and the plaintiff is ordered to submit default prove up papers by March 29, 2024. The judge has also awarded the plaintiff monetary sanctions in the amount of $5,820, to be paid within 20 days of the order.

The judge found that the defendant's failure to respond to discovery requests and disobey court orders was a misuse of the discovery process, and that the plaintiff had made reasonable efforts to obtain the discovery. The judge also found that the plaintiff's hourly rate of $475 and the hours spent on each motion (6 hours) were reasonable.

The judge noted that the defendant had argued that they had not complied with the court order because they had not received notice, but the judge found that the defendant had been aware of the order and had willfully disobeyed it. The judge also noted that the defendant had argued that the plaintiff had given them an extension to produce documents, but the judge found that the parties had agreed to produce the documents before the mediation, and that the defendant's interpretation of the extension was belied by their own stipulation.
