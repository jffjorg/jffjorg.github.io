```

And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge denies the Plaintiff's request for default judgment against the Defendant due to the Plaintiff's failure to properly comply with the requirements for a default judgment. The Plaintiff has not submitted a declaration showing personal service was attempted at least twice before serving the complaint by substitute service. The Judge notes that the Plaintiff's proof of service indicates the complaint was served by substitute service, but there is no declaration of reasonable diligence. As a result, the Judge finds that the Plaintiff has not met the requirements for a default judgment and denies the request.
