And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has granted Defendant Tesla, Inc.'s motion to compel binding arbitration in this case. The motion was unopposed, and the judge found that Defendant had met its burden of producing prima facie evidence of an agreement to arbitrate claims arising from the Motor Vehicle Order Agreement. The agreement includes a provision for binding arbitration of disputes between the parties, and the judge found that it encompasses the claims alleged in the Plaintiff's Complaint. The judge also found that Plaintiff has not met its burden of producing evidence to challenge the authenticity of the arbitration agreement. As a result, the judge has ordered that this action is stayed pending completion of arbitration, and has set a hearing for August 22, 2024, to review the completion of the arbitration.
