[Tentative]
  Order RE:
 
defendants’ motion to expunge notice of
  pendency of action
 



 
MOVING PARTIES:
            Defendants Fernando Gaytan and
Angie Coello
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Unopposed
Motion to Expunge Notice of Pendency of Action
The court
considered the moving papers filed in connection with this motion.  No opposition papers were filed.
DISCUSSION
Plaintiffs Dennis Luna and Vanessa Luna Bishop (“Plaintiffs”) filed on
August 2, 2022 and recorded on August 23, 2022, a Notice of Pendency of Action,
stating that their action concerns the real property located at 700 Keenan
Street, Montebello, California. 
Defendants Fernando Gaytan and Angie Coello (“Defendants”) now move the
court for an order expunging Plaintiffs’ Notice of Pendency of Action. 
“‘A
lis pendens is a recorded document giving constructive notice that an action
has been filed affecting title or right to possession of the real property
described in the notice.’”  (Kirkeby v. Superior Court (2004) 33
Cal.4th 642, 647.)  Any time after a notice of pendency of action has been
recorded, any party or nonparty with an interest in the real property affected
thereby may move the court in which the action is pending to expunge the
notice.  (Code Civ. Pro., § 405.30.) The court must order the notice
expunged if the court finds any of the following: the pleading on which the
notice is based does not contain a real property claim; the claimant has not
established by preponderance of the evidence the probable validity of the real
property claim; or the real property claim has probable validity, but adequate
relief can be secured by the giving of an undertaking.  (Code Civ. Pro.,
§§ 405.31-405.33.) 
Plaintiffs
filed their operative Third Amended Complaint on July 23, 2021, alleging four
causes of action for (1) breach of contract, (2) intentional misrepresentation,
(3) unjust enrichment, and (4) constructive eviction.  On September 2, 2021, the court sustained
Defendants’ demurrer to the fourth cause of action without leave to amend.  (Sep. 2, 2021 Order, p. 1.)  On March 6, 2023, the court granted
Defendants’ motion for summary judgment.[1] 
(Mar. 6, 2023 Order, p. 1.)  Thereafter,
on May 1, 2023, the court entered judgment in favor of Defendants and against
Plaintiffs. 
Because
judgment has been entered in favor of Defendants, there are no remaining causes
of action alleged against them.  Although
the court notes that Defendants contend that the Third Amended Complaint does
not allege real property claims, the court finds, given that judgment has been
entered in their favor, that Plaintiffs cannot show the probable validity of
their claims and therefore does not address that argument.[2]  (Mot., p. 6:6-10.) 
The court
finds that Plaintiffs have not met their burden to show the probable validity
of their claims in the Third Amended Complaint because (1) Plaintiffs did not
file an opposition to this motion, and (2) the court has entered judgment in
favor of Defendants and against Plaintiffs, as set forth above.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 405.32 [“the court shall
order that the notice be expunged if the court finds that the claimant has not
established by a preponderance of the evidence the probable validity of the real
property claim”], 405.30; J & A Mash & Barrell, LLC v. Superior
Court of Fresno County (2022) 74 Cal.App.5th 1, 33 [“section 405.30
explicitly places the burden of proving the probable validity of the real
property claim” on the claimant]; Amalgamated Bank v. Superior Court (2007)
149 Cal.App.4th 1003, 1013 [“a trial court confronted with an expungement
motion after judgment against the claimant may deny the motion only if the
court believes that its own decision will be reversed on appeal”].) 
The court therefore grants
Defendants’ motion.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 405.32.) 
ORDER
The court grants defendants Fernando Gaytan and Angie Coello’s motion
to expunge notice of pendency of action. 
The court orders that the Notice of Pendency of Action recorded on
August 23, 2022 against the real property located at 700 Keenan Street,
Montebello, California, Assessor’s Parcel Number 5249-004-038, as attached as
Exhibit C to the declaration of Angie Coello, is expunged. 
The court orders defendants Fernando Gaytan and Angie Coello to give
notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
