And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on two motions: defense motion in limine No. 10 and Plaintiff's motion to augment opinion of Roberto Contreras, II, M.D. The judge is concerned about the foundation for Dr. Contreras' economic analysis and has ordered an Evid. Code sec. 402 hearing to determine the reliability of his opinions on likely future medical costs.

The judge is also considering a defense motion to exclude the opinion of Dr. Ammar Chaudry, a radiologist, on the use of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in diagnosis of traumatic brain injury (TBI). The judge has granted the request for judicial notice of recent California state trial court decisions and has set a date for an Evid. Code sec. 402 hearing on the challenge to the reliability of DTI as a new medical technique.

The judge has not ruled on the admissibility of Dr. Chaudry's opinion, but has expressed concerns about the lack of consensus regarding the utility of DTI and the need for further evidence on the level of cognitive impairment of the three plaintiffs. The judge has also noted that the parties have not shown any court ruling where DTI has been excluded and that the use of DTI is already the subject of considerable professional literature.
