And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge, Hon. Thomas D. Long, has issued a tentative ruling granting in part the Defendant's motion to strike the first amended complaint (FAC) filed by the Plaintiff, DeLois Jacobs. The motion to strike the entire FAC is denied, but the motion to strike paragraphs 21, 42, 54, 60, 72, 80, 88, 109, and the prayer for punitive damages is granted. The Judge finds that the late filing of the FAC does not prejudice the Defendant, and that the amendment relates only to punitive damages and not the substantive claims. The Judge also notes that the Plaintiff's minimal amendments do not cure the deficiencies identified in the Court's prior order. The motion to strike is granted on the ground that the allegations of punitive damages are deficient. The Judge has also advanced the trial dates and scheduled a new Final Status Conference and trial.
