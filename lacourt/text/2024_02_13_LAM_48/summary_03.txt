And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English:

The Judge grants Plaintiff Timothy Philips' motion for leave to file a fourth amended complaint, despite Defendants Seizmic, Inc. and Sal Fateen's objections. The Plaintiff had previously filed a third amended complaint and a motion for leave to file a fourth amended complaint. The Court notes that the Plaintiff's proposed fourth amended complaint cures a defect in the third amended complaint by correctly identifying a cause of action under Labor Code section 226, subdivision (c). The Court also finds that the Defendants' arguments about the merits of the proposed amended pleading are not relevant to the issue of whether to grant leave to amend. The Court grants the motion and orders the Plaintiff to file and serve the fourth amended complaint within ten days.
