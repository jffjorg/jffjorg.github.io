 Case Number:  22STCV12696    Hearing Date:   January 22, 2024    Dept:  15 [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE MOTION IN LIMINE
Defendants’ MIL No. 7
Defendant Union Carbide
filed a motion to exclude all references to any fiber suppliers other than
Hamilton because Plaintiffs did not designate any testimony or experts on any
other suppliers.  Defendant argues that
Plaintiffs did not list any former testimony about it supplying fiber to Amcord,
Vanderbilt, Kelly-Moore or Kaiser Gypsum. 
Plaintiffs argue it has evidence that Defendant sold to Kelly-Moore,
Kaiser Gypsum, and Amcord, including invoices, purchase contracts, and sales
reports, as well as Defendant’s discovery responses about sales to various
manufacturers.
The court cannot predict
what documents will come into evidence and whether Plaintiffs will be able to
prove that Defendant sold asbestos to various manufacturers.  That Plaintiffs did not designate certain
deposition testimony from former cases does not mean as a matter of law they
cannot prove their claims through some other evidence.  It is not the place of a motion in limine to
conclude that Plaintiffs have no evidence of a particular fact.  The court has no business on a motion in
limine to review all of the evidence that could potentially be admitted at
trial and decide whether the evidence is sufficient for Plaintiffs to prove
their case.
            The
motion is denied without prejudice to objections at trial.
            The
moving party is to give notice.
