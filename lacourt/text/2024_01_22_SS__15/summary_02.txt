And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on Defendant Union Carbide's motion to exclude all references to non-Hamilton fiber suppliers, which was filed as Motion in Limine No. 7. The plaintiff argues that they have evidence showing Union Carbide sold asbestos to various manufacturers, including Kelly-Moore, Kaiser Gypsum, and Amcord, and that this evidence should be admissible at trial. The judge has denied the motion, stating that it is not the role of a motion in limine to determine whether the plaintiff has sufficient evidence to prove their claims. The judge notes that the plaintiff may still be able to prove their claims through other evidence, even if they did not designate specific testimony or experts. The motion is denied without prejudice to objections at trial.
