And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

In this tentative ruling, the judge addresses two motions in limine filed by Colgate-Palmolive Company. The first motion seeks to exclude testimony from Sean Fitzgerald that the plaintiff's use of Cashmere Bouquet exposed her to asbestos due to Fitzgerald's invalid testing. The court notes that this issue was already addressed in its prior ruling on Defendant's MIL No. 6 and defers the motion to the trial court. The court suggests that the trial court can choose to hold an evidentiary hearing during the trial or strike Fitzgerald's testimony if it is not established.

The second motion seeks to exclude expert testimony about cleavage and mineral fragments based on unreliable and unaccepted methods. The court finds that the definition of "asbestos" is a disputed issue for the trier of fact and that the defendant has not shown that the plaintiffs' experts' opinions have no foundation or are based on unreliable matters. The court denies the motion without prejudice to objections at trial.
