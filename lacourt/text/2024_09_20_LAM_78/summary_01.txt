The Judge grants Plaintiff Bernal's motion to compel the deposition of Guy Mack, ordering him to appear for deposition at a date and time to be noticed by Plaintiff Bernal. The Judge also awards sanctions against FPA and its attorney of record in the amount of $3,112.00 for their refusal to produce Guy Mack for deposition.
