And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Danielle Palivos vs. State Farm Insurance Co, et al, denying Petitioner's petition to compel arbitration and appoint a neutral arbitrator. The petition was filed on April 18, 2024, and is unopposed. The Court notes that Insurance Code section 11580.2 requires insurers to provide coverage for bodily injury or wrongful death caused by uninsured motorists, and that if the insured and the insurer cannot agree on the amount of damages, the issue shall be determined by arbitration. However, the Court finds that Petitioner has not provided sufficient evidence to demonstrate good cause for the Court to compel arbitration and appoint a neutral arbitrator. The Court orders Petitioner to provide notice of this ruling.
