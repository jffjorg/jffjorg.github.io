And here is the English text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses the motions filed by David, including the "Notice of Intention to Move for New Trial" and Motion #2. David seeks a new trial due to insufficient evidence to justify the verdict or other decision, and the verdict or other decision being against law. However, the court notes that the motion does not specify the ground for new trial as required by law. Additionally, the judge raises concerns about the failure to mention prejudgment interest in the notice. The court will consider these issues at the hearing on June 13, 2024.
