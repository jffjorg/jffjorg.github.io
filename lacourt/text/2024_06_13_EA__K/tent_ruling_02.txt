 Case Number:  BC649025    Hearing Date:   June 13, 2024    Dept:  K 1.         Defendant Alkiviades David’s Motion for
New Trial is DENIED.
2.         The
hearing on Plaintiff Elizabeth Taylor’s Motion for Attorneys’ Fees is CONTINUED
to August 6, 2024 at 9:00 a.m.
Background[1]
Plaintiffs Elizabeth Taylor (“Taylor”) and Chasity Jones (“Jones”)
(together, “Plaintiffs”) allege as follows:
Defendant Alkiviades David (“David”) was, at
all relevant times, the President, CEO and managing agent of Defendants
Hologram USA, Inc. (“Hologram”), Hologram USA Entertainment, Inc. (“Hologram
Entertainment”), FilmOn Media Holdings, Inc. (“FilmOn”), FilmOn.TV, Inc.
(“FilmOn TV”), FilmOn.TV Networks, Inc. (“FilmOn Networks”), Alki David
Productions, Inc. (“Alki David Productions”) and Anakando Media Group USA
(“Anakando”). In January 2015, Plaintiffs were hired by Defendants as account
executives on the company’s sales team. Throughout the duration of their
employment, Plaintiffs worked in a hostile, misogynistic workplace rife with
sexual innuendo and degrading behavior to women. David also sexually harassed,
assaulted and imprisoned Taylor and sexually harassed and assaulted Jones. In
May 2015, Defendants directed Taylor to falsify health insurance paperwork to
indicate a later hire date. On June 1, 2015, Taylor was terminated, which was
the same day she complained about sexual harassment and insurance fraud. In
October 2015, Defendants ordered Jones to sign a declaration against Taylor. On
November 15, 2016, Jones was terminated in retaliation for rebuffing David’s
sexual assault.
On February 2, 2017, Plaintiffs filed a complaint, asserting causes of
action against David, Hologram, Hologram Entertainment, FilmOn, FilmOn TV,
FilmOn Networks, Alki David Productions, Anakando (together, “Defendants”) and

by Jones only.
On July 11, 2017, the court granted Defendants’ “Motion for Separate
Trials.”
On January 30, 2018, Plaintiffs filed two “Amendment[s] to Complaint,”

entered on the FACC as follows: David to take nothing by virtue of the
cross-complaint.

On August 26, 2020, the court sustained FilmOn’s, FilmOn Network’s, Alki
David Production’s and Anakando’s demurrer to Taylor’s Supplemental Complaint
for Damages without leave to amend; on September 24, 2020, an “Order of
Dismissal” was entered as to same.
On March 18, 2022, remittitur was filed, affirming the court’s September
26, 2019 amended judgment as to Jones.
On November 9, 2022, the court granted Jones’ Motion to Amend Judgment to
Add Harmonia Malibu, LLC (“HML”), as a Judgment Debtor. On December 5, 2022,
HML filed a “Notice of Appeal.”

1.         Motion
for New Trial
Legal Standard
Under Code of Civil Procedure, section 657:
The verdict may be vacated and any other decision
may be modified or vacated, in whole or in part, and a new or further trial
granted on all or part of the issues, on the application of the party
aggrieved, for any of the following causes, materially affecting the
substantial rights of such party: . . .

1.         Irregularity in the proceedings of the
court, jury or adverse party, or any order of the court or abuse of discretion
by which either party was prevented from having a fair trial. . .
5.         Excessive. . . damages. . .
7.         Error in law, occurring at the trial and
excepted to by the party making the application. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 657).
Discussion
David moves the court for a new trial on the following
grounds: (1) the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to justify the
verdict, resulting in excessive damages and (2) the court abused its discretion
by admitting unauthenticated and unduly prejudicial evidence at the punitive
damages phase of trial.
At the outset, the court notes that David’s “Notice of
Intention to Move for New Trial” filed April 18, 2024 identified the following
grounds for new trial:
1.         Irregularity in the proceedings of the
court, jury or adverse party, or any order of the court or abuse of discretion
by which either party was prevented from having a fair trial; 
2.         Misconduct
of the jury; 
3.         Excessive
damages; 
4.         Errors in law, occurring at the time of
trial and excepted to by the moving party.
The above grounds are based on Code of Civil Procedure §
657(1), (2), (5) and (7). A notice of intention to move for a new trial is deemed to be a
motion for a new trial on all the grounds stated in the notice. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 659, subd. (b).) The instant motion does not articulate any argument
based on jury misconduct; as such, the grounds for the instant motion are based
on § 657(1),(5) and (7).[2]
These grounds are discussed separately below:
1.                 
Irregularity in the Proceedings of the Cour, Jury, or Adverse
Party/Court Orders or Abuse of Discretion (i.e., Code of Civ. Proc., § 657(1))
A new trial motion made on this ground must be supported by
affidavits (or declarations). (See Code Civ. Proc., § 658). David’s motion is
accompanied by a declaration from attorney Matthew Huzaineh (“Huzaineh”);
however, said declaration merely attaches a copy of portions of the Reporter’s
Transcript for December 12, 2023. The court, then, summarily denies the motion
made on this ground.
2.                 
Excessive Damages (i.e., Code of Civ. Proc., §
657(1))
“A new trial shall not be granted . . . upon the ground of
excessive. . . damages, unless after weighing the evidence the court is
convinced from the entire record, including reasonable inferences therefrom,
that the court or jury clearly should have reached a different verdict or
decision.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 657 [emphasis added]). “The judge is not
permitted to substitute his judgment for that of the jury on the question of
damages unless it appears from the record the jury verdict was improper.” (Bigboy
v. County of San Diego (1984) 154 Cal.App.3d 397, 406). A new trial motion
made on this ground must be supported by the minutes of the court. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 658).
While David has attached what he argues to be “relevant
pages” from the reporter’s transcript of December 12, 2023 proceedings, he has
failed to provide the court with the entire record. The court, then, cannot
make a determination that “the jury clearly should have reached a different
verdict or decision.” The motion is summarily denied on this ground.
3.                 
Error in Law
A new trial may be granted upon the ground of “[e]rror in
law, occurring at the trial and excepted to by the party making the
application.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 657(7).) A new trial motion made on
this ground must be supported by the minutes of the court. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 658).
David asserts that the court’s admission of trial exhibit 114
(i.e., a video clip of David) was an error of law which denied him a fair
trial. David first argues that the video is irrelevant, because it did not
constitute “malice,” “oppression” and “despicable conduct” towards Plaintiff,
but towards third parties at a debtor’s examination or to third party judgment
creditors. (Motion, 8:13-9:13). Plaintiff, however, did not use the video to
prove those elements, inasmuch as the jury had already decided in Phase I that
David engaged in wrongful conduct with either malice or oppression (See Special
Verdict entered Dec. 12, 2023); rather, Plaintiff’s counsel Arick Fudali
explained that “[t]he entire point of my presentation is that Mr. David keeps
getting judgments against him and monetary amounts against him and this is how
he responds to them and how he reacts to them. And I’m going to ask this jury
to give an even larger amount than the ones that precipitate this type of
behavior. It is relevant to show how Mr. David responds to judgments against
him which is the entire testimony of this punitive damages.” (Huzaineh Decl., ¶
2, Exh. A, 16:27-17:7). Indeed, “[t]he degree of reprehensibility of the
defendant’s conduct is the most important indicator of the reasonableness of a
punitive damage award, and one relevant factor in this analysis is the extent
to which the defendant’s alleged wrongful conduct involved repeated actions . .
. By placing the defendant’s wrongful conduct into the context of a continuing
pattern and practice, an individual plaintiff can demonstrate that the conduct
toward him or her was more blameworthy and warrants a stronger penalty to deter
continued or repeated conduct of the same nature.” (Lopez v. Watchtower
Bible & Tract Society of New York, Inc. (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 566, 592
[quotations and citations omitted].)
David next argues that trial exhibit 114 was not adequately
authenticated. (Motion, 9:21-22). “A photograph or video recording is typically
authenticated by showing it is a fair and accurate representation of the scene
depicted. This foundation may, but need not be, supplied by the person
taking the photograph or by a person who witnessed the event being recorded. It
may be supplied by other witness testimony, circumstantial evidence, content
and location.” (People v. Goldsmith (2014) 59 Cal.4th 258, 267-268)
[citations omitted; italics added]. David contends that the authentication of a
video requires that the authenticating witness was physically present while
filming. (Id., 9:26-10:8). David’s citation to Jones v. City of Los
Angeles (1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 436 in support of his position is not
convincing. In Jones, the court of appeal held that the trial court did
not abuse its discretion by concluding that the probative value of a “day in the life”
videotape outweighed any prejudicial effect and, thus, admitting it in
evidence. Defendant, in fact, made no objection to the aforesaid video on
the grounds of a lack of foundation or failure to authenticate. (Id. at
440). Additionally, as Plaintiff points out, although Jones discussed
authenticity issues in a footnote, “this 1993 pre-YouTube case was silent on
the purported evidentiary issue of presenting and testifying to a publicly
accessible video.” (Opp., 7:2-3).
David asserts that “a party offering a video clip that had
been edited bears the burden of showing the editing did not distort the meaning
of the activities depicted in the tape” (Motion, 10:3-5). David, however, has
not provided the court with any evidence of editing, whether at the time of
trial or now.
“In making the initial authenticity determination, the court
need only conclude that a prima facie showing has been made that the photograph
is an accurate representation of what it purports to depict.” (In re K.B.
(2015) 238 Cal.App.4th 989, 997.) “The ultimate determination of the
authenticity of the evidence is for the trier of fact, who must consider any
rebuttal evidence and balance it against the authenticating evidence in order
to arrive at a final determination on whether the photograph, in fact, is
authentic.” (Id.) Here, Joseph Chora testified that he personally
accessed the video from David’s own YouTube channel and that the video appeared
to be in the same condition it was when he first viewed it on David’s YouTube
channel. (Huzaineh Decl., ¶ 2, Exh. A, 17:15-18:4).
The motion is denied on this ground.
Conclusion
The motion is denied.
2.         Motion
for Attorneys’ Fees
Plaintiff moves the court, per Government Code § 12965, for
an award of $2,236,084.00 in attorney’s fees, plus $70,859.10 in costs.[3]
The court will continue the hearing on the motion to August
6, 2024 at 9:00 a.m.
Prior to the continued hearing, the “Judgment on Special
Verdict” entered on April 4, 2024 needs to be amended, specifically with
respect to Page 4, Lines 22-24 (i.e., as to prejudgment interest, attorney’s
fees and costs). Plaintiff filed her memorandum of costs on January 24, 2024
$70,859.10, which was premature under California Rules of Court rule
3.1700, subdivision (a)(1) [i.e., “[a] prevailing party who claims costs must serve and
file a memorandum of costs within 15 days after the date of service of the
notice of entry of judgment or dismissal by the clerk under Code of Civil
Procedure section 664.5 or the date of service of written notice of entry of
judgment or dismissal, or within 180 days after entry of judgment, whichever is
first. . .”].
When Plaintiff filed her “Notice of Entry of Judgment” (mail-served
April 4, 2024) on April 5, 2024, she also filed her “Motion for Attorney’s
Fees” (seeking $2,236,084.00, the same figure erroneously included in the
“Judgment on Special Verdict,” as well as $70,859.10 in costs, the same figure
erroneously included in the “Judgment on Special Verdict”) six days AFTER the
“Judgment on Special Verdict” was entered. The instant motion also seeks[4]
prejudgment interest in the amount of $1,775,250.00, the same figure
erroneously included in the “Judgment on Special Verdict.” As a result, the
court will provide David an opportunity to oppose the Motion for Attorney’s
Fees and whether prejudgment interest is appropriate in this case.
