The Judge grants Plaintiff Beverly Nelson's motion for preference and trial setting. The Plaintiff, who is 88 years old, alleges that she sustained injuries on June 20, 2023, after encountering a large depression in the parking area of Kohl's. The Plaintiff filed a complaint and subsequently amended it to name L.F.R. Landscape, Inc. as a defendant. The defendants, including Kohl's, Inc., Divisions Maintenance Group, and L.F.R. Landscape, Inc., filed cross-complaints. The Plaintiff's counsel submitted a declaration attesting to the Plaintiff's health and medical condition, which is sufficient to grant the motion. The court grants trial preference and will set the trial date at a later time.
