electronically served) a “Notice of Intention to Move for New Trial. On April
24, 2024, a “Notice of Hearing of Motion for New Trial” was filed by the court,
which advised that the motion had been set for hearing on May 15, 2024; notice
was given to counsel. On April 26, 2024, the court filed another “Notice of
Hearing of Motion for New Trial,” advising therein that the “Hearing on Motion
for New Trial” had been reset to May 29, 2024; notice was given to counsel.
Motion #1 was filed (and mail served) April 29, 2024 and listed a June 13, 2024
hearing date. Ecourt notes indicate that on May 14, 2024, the court rescheduled
the May 29, 2024 hearing on Motion #1 to June 13, 2024.
 
On April 10, 2024, Plaintiff filed (and electronically
served) Motion #2, which was originally set for hearing on May 7, 2024. On
April 26, 2024, a “Notice Re: Continuance of Hearing and Order” was filed by
the court, which advised that the May 7, 2024 scheduled hearing on Motion #2
had been continued to May 29, 2024; notice was given to counsel. Ecourt notes
indicate that on May 17, 2024, the court rescheduled the May 29, 2024 hearing on
Motion #2 to June 13, 2024.


[2]              David contends that “the evidence
presented at trial was insufficient to justify the verdict resulting in
excessive damages” (Motion, 2:14-15, 3:9-10, 3:19, 4:23-24, 7:17-18). The court
notes that, while “[i]nsufficiency of the evidence to justify the verdict or
other decision, or the verdict or other decision is against law” is a basis for
new trial (See Code Civ. Proc., § 657(6)), David’s “Notice of Intent to Move
for New Trial” does not mention this ground. “A new trial order can be granted
only on a ground specified in the motion. The right to move for a new trial is
a creature of statute and the procedure prescribed by law must be closely
followed.” (Collins v. Sutter Memorial Hospital (2011) 196 Cal.App.4th
1, 16-17 [internal quotations and citations omitted].)


[3]           The instant motion also
seeks prejudgment interest in the amount of $1,775,250.00. This is not set
forth in the notice.

11:14-26 of the motion.
