And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to consolidate two lawsuits, one filed by Sandro D. Villalobos against Jorge Anibal Lopez Martinez (Case No. 23CHCV00569) and the other filed by Lopez against Villalobos and others (Case No. 24VECV00592). Both cases arise from the same automobile collision on February 8, 2022, and involve the same parties. The judge believes consolidation is appropriate, but notes that the cases are pending in different departments and must be related and transferred to the same department before consolidation can occur. The judge also identifies an issue with the service of the motion, which was served electronically but may not have reached Villalobos' counsel at the correct email address. The judge proposes two options: if Villalobos' counsel appears and waives any defect in notice, the cases will be related and consolidated. If not, the hearing will be continued so that the motion can be served on Villalobos' counsel at the correct email address and an opposition can be filed, if desired.
