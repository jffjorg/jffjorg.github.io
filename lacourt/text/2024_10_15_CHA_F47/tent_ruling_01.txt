Case #23CHCV00569
 
MOTION TO
CONSOLIDATE
 
Motion filed on 8/2/24.
 
MOVING PARTY: Defendant Jorge
Anibal Lopez Martinez
RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff Sandro D. Villalobos
 
RELIEF REQUESTED: An order
consolidating this action with the case Jorge Anibel Lopez v. Sandro Douglas
Villalobos Maldonado, et al. LASC Case No. 24VECV00592.

 
RULING: 
 
SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
The instant case, Sandro D. Villalobos v. Jorge Anibal
Lopez (23CHCV00569) and the case, Jorge Anibel Lopez v. Sandro Douglas
Villalobos Maldonado, et al. (24VECV00592), pending in Department A of the
Van Nuys Courthouse, arise out of the same automobile collision that occurred
on 2/8/22 on the 118 Freeway.  The
parties dispute liability.  
 
Sandro D. Villalobos filed the instant action on 2/27/23
and Jorge Anibel Lopez filed the action pending in the Van Nuys Courthouse on
2/8/24.  On 6/13/24 and 6/20/24, Jorge
Anibel Lopez filed Notices of Related Case in this case.  Both notices were rejected because they
included an incorrect case number for the Van Nuys case (24ECV00592 v.
24VECV0592).
 
On 8/2/24, Defendant Jorge Anibal Lopez Martinez filed
and served the instant motion seeking an order consolidating this action with
the case Jorge Anibel Lopez v. Sandro Douglas Villalobos Maldonado, et al.
LASC Case No. 24VECV00592.  The proof of
service attached to the motion indicates that it was served on Sandro D.
Villalobos’ counsel, Javaheri & Yahoudai, by electronic transmission at the
following email addresses: alex@jnylaw.com,
aaron@jnylaw.com and teamab@jnylaw.com.  However, the email address of record for
Villalobos’ counsel in eCourt is yosi@jnylaw.com.  No opposition or other response to the motion
has been filed to cure the foregoing defect in notice.  
 
ANALYSIS
 
Since both cases arise out of the same occurrence and
involve the same parties, consolidation appears to be appropriate.  See CCP 1048(a).  However, because the cases are pending in
different departments, they must be related and transferred to the same
department before they may be consolidated. 
See LASC Local Rule 3.3(g)(1). 
As noted above, there is also an issue with the service of the motion.
 
CONCLUSION
 
If Villalobos’ counsel appears and waives any defect in
notice, the Court will relate the cases and thereafter grant the instant motion
to consolidate.  
 
If not, the hearing will be continued so that the motion
can be served on Villalobos’ counsel at the email address of record and an
opposition can be filed, if desired.
