  Case Number:  22STCV01760    Hearing Date:   July 8, 2024    Dept:  57 The demurrer of Cross-Defendants Maggie Bell and Bradley Bell ("the Bells") to the causes of action asserted against them in the First Amended Cross-Complaint ("FAC") of Steve Donovan and Catherine Stroud-Donovan ("the Donovans") is overruled as to the first cause of action for reformation of deeds, seventh cause of action for equitable easement and ninth cause of action for declaratory relief.   In the Court's view, the allegations in the FAC are sufficient to establish those causes of action.  The demurrer is sustained with leave to amend as to the sixth cause of action for adverse possession and seventh cause of action for prescriptive easement.  That is because the asserted possession of property for a claim of adverse possession and the asserted use of property for a claim of prescriptive easement must be hostile to the rights of the true owner of the property.  In some portions of the FAC, the Donovans allege that their possession and use of the property in question was with the Bells' consent, which, is the opposite of hostile.   Elsewhere, the FAC alleges that the possession and use was hostile.  These inconsistencies in the FAC are fatal to the claims for adverse possession and prescriptive.  The adverse possession claim fails for an additional reason.  A person asserting a claim for adverse possession of the  property of another person must show that he or she paid taxes on the other person's property.  In the FAC, the Donovans allege that they paid taxes on their own property, not on the property of the Bells.\The demurrer also is sustained with leave to amend as to the eighth cause of action for damages for loss of use because the Donovans failed in their opposition to the Bells' demurrer to address the Bells' arguments in support of the demurrer as to this cause of action.
