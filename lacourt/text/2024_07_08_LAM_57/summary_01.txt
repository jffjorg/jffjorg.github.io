And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer of Cross-Defendants Maggie Bell and Bradley Bell to the First Amended Cross-Complaint (FAC) of Steve Donovan and Catherine Stroud-Donovan. The demurrer is overruled as to the first, seventh, and ninth causes of action, which seek reformation of deeds, equitable easement, and declaratory relief, respectively. The Court finds that the allegations in the FAC are sufficient to establish these causes of action.

However, the demurrer is sustained with leave to amend as to the sixth, seventh, and eighth causes of action, which seek adverse possession, prescriptive easement, and damages for loss of use, respectively. The Court finds that the Donovans' allegations of hostile possession and use are inconsistent and fatal to these claims. Additionally, the Donovans failed to address the Bells' arguments in support of the demurrer as to the eighth cause of action, and therefore the demurrer is sustained. The Court gives the Donovans leave to amend their FAC to address these deficiencies.
