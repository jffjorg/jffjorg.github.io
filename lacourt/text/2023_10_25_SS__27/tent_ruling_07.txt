MOTION
FOR CONTEMPT



 
MOVING PARTY:               Plaintiff
Sandra Martinez Basurto
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     Defendant Bodega
Latina Corporation
 
 
I.          INTRODUCTION
 
On October 1, 2021, Plaintiff, Sandra Martinez Basurto, filed
this action against Defendant, Bodega Latina Corporation dba El Super for
injuries arising from a slip and fall incident.  
 
            Relevant
Procedural Background      
 
·        
On July 7, 2023, Plaintiff filed
motions to compel Defendant’s further discovery responses to Plaintiff’s Special
Interrogatories, Set Two, and Requests for Production of Documents, Set Two.  Defendant served untimely further responses
prior to the hearing.  The Court found
Defendant’s responses to be code-compliant. 
As such, the Court denied the motions on August 8, 2023.  However, the Court granted Plaintiff’s
request for sanctions against Defendant and its counsel because it was not
clear that Defendant would have provide the responses absent the motion.  Sanctions were to be paid within 10 days of
the order.  As such, the deadline to pay
the sanctions was August 18, 2023.  
 
·        
On August 9, 2023, Plaintiff filed
proofs of service of the Court’s August 8, 2023 ruling.
 
·        
On August 22, 2023, after Defendant
and defense counsel had yet to pay the sanctions, Plaintiff’s counsel inquired
as to the status of the sanctions payment. 
Defense counsel did not indicate when the sanctions would be paid.
 
·        
On August 25, 2023, Plaintiff filed
this motion for contempt after Defendant and its counsel failed to pay
sanctions within the court-ordered period. 
Plaintiff also requests additional monetary sanctions against Defendant
and its counsel.
 
·        
On August 29, 2023, Defendant and
its counsel paid the sanctions.
 
·        
On October 12, 2023, Defendant filed
an opposition, arguing in part that the motion was moot because sanctions had
been paid.  
 
·        
Plaintiff replied on October 18,
2023.
 
            As a
threshold issue, Plaintiff’s motion for contempt concerns only the violation of
the Court’s August 8, 2023 order imposing monetary sanctions.  The Court’s ruling is based solely on that alleged
violation.
 
II.        LEGAL
STANDARDS
 
            Contempt is
any act, in or out of court, “which tends to impede, embarrass or obstruct the
court in the discharge of its duties.”  (In re Shortridge (1893) 99
Cal. 526, 532.)  Particular acts constituting contempt are enumerated by
statute, including:¿ “(d)isobedience of any lawful ... order, or process of the
court”;¿ “(d)isobedience of a subpoena duly served”; “refusing to ... answer as
a witness”;¿ “(d)isorderly, contemptuous, or insolent behavior toward the judge
while holding the court, tending to interrupt the due course of ...
trial.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1209(a); see also Code Civ. Proc., § 1991
[disobedience of subpoena]; and Pen. Code, § 166 [misdemeanor].)  
 
            In this
case involving the disobedience of a prior court order, the contempt at issue
is “indirect,” which requires a more elaborate procedure to notify the
person(s) sought to be charged and to allow him or her an opportunity to be
heard.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1211–1218; see also Hanson v. Superior
Court (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 75, 81.)  “An affidavit must be presented
to the court stating the facts constituting the contempt, an order to show
cause must be issued, and hearing on the facts must be held by the
judge.”  (Arthur v. Superior Court (1965) 62 Cal.2d 404,
407-08.)  Since the acts involved did not occur in the court’s presence,
the affidavit (declaration) must cover each element of the commission of the
contempt.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1211.5.)  These elements are: (1) the
rendition of a valid court order; (2) actual knowledge of the order; (3)
ability to comply; and (4) willful disobedience of the order.  (Conn v.
Superior Court (1987) 196 Cal.App.3d 774, 784 [repeated failures to turn
over documents as ordered].)  Such proceedings are criminal in nature because
of the penalties that a judge may impose. 
(People v. Gonzalez (1996) 12 Cal.4th 804, 816.)  The constitutional rights of the accused must
be observed.  “The burden of proof is on
the moving party to prove the respondent’s ability to comply (rather than on
the respondent to prove inability.).” (Weil
& Brown, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before trial (The Rutter
Group) Paragraph 9:724.1.)
            Upon
receipt of the affidavit, the court may issue an order to show cause (OSC) why
the person should not be held in contempt.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1212.)  Subsequently, upon review of the answer and
evidence, “the court or judge shall determine whether the person proceeded
against is guilty of the contempt charged, and if it be adjudged that he or she
is guilty of the contempt, a fine may be imposed on him or her not exceeding
one thousand dollars ($1,000), payable to the court, or he or she may be
imprisoned not exceeding five days, or both.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1218, subd. (a).) 
 
            As noted by
the appellate court in McCann v. Municipal Cour t(1990) 221 Cal.App.3d
527, 536-37:  “The contempt power is a
court’s ‘ultimate weapon.’ [Citation.] In the first case by the California
Supreme Court to consider the contempt power, the Court cautioned that the
power to adjudicate direct contempt is necessarily arbitrary and should be used
with great prudence, the judge bearing in mind that the exercise of that power
is not so much to vindicate the judge’s character as to promote the respect due
the administration of the laws.”  While
this matter involves indirect contempt, the same principles apply. 
 
III.       DISCUSSION
 
            Plaintiff argues that the motion should be granted because the
elements are met: (1) the Court issued a valid order on August 8, 2023 imposing
sanctions against Defendant and defense counsel, (2) Defendant and his counsel had
actual knowledge of that order, (3) Defendants have the able to comply (i.e.,
pay the sanctions in the specified time), and (4) Defendant and its counsel willfully
disobeyed the Court’s order by failing to pay the sanctions to date.  In support, Plaintiff submits the declaration
of counsel, Katherine Lipel.  Ms. Lipel states
that counsel for Defendant, Tiffany Schneider, was present at the August 8,
2023 hearing and argued against the Court’s tentative ruling imposing sanctions.  Further, Ms. Lipel inquired from Ms.
Schneider as to the status of the sanctions payment.  Ms. Schneider did not directly respond or
otherwise indicate when sanctions would be paid.  (Lipel Decl., ¶¶ 2-6.)
 
            Plaintiff
does not meet its evidentiary burden to show Defendant willfully disobeyed the
August 8, 2023 order.  Defendant and its
counsel paid the court-ordered sanctions on August 29, 2023.  Being slow to make payment does not amount to
willful disobedience.  (Schneider Decl., ¶
7.)  There may be a host of reasons for
the delayed payment.  Plaintiff fails to affirmatively
establish ability to pay on time.  Moreover,
delayed payment does not warrant use of the court’s “ultimate weapon.”  (McCann, supra, 221 Cal.App.3d at
p. 536; see also Gallagher v. Municipal Court (1948) 31 Cal.2d 784, 788
[“[A] mere mistaken act by counsel cannot render him in contempt of court.”].)  This is doubly so when a litigant may enforce
payment of a monetary sanctions under the Enforcements of Judgments Law.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 680.010, et seq.)  Nor does Plaintiff demonstrate that untimely
payment of discovery sanctions alone “impede[s], embarrass[es] or obstruct[s]
the court in the discharge of its duties.”  (In re Shortridge
(1893) 99 Cal. 526, 532.)  The circumstances herein do not warrant use of
the Court’s contempt power.  Moreover,
consideration should have been given to taking the motion off calendar after
the sanctions were paid.  
 
IV.       CONCLUSION
 
            The motion
is denied.  
 
            The
requests for sanctions are denied. 
 
            Moving
party to give notice, unless waived.
