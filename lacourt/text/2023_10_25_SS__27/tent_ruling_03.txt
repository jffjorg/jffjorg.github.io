PETITION
TO APPROVE MINOR’S COMPROMISE

Stephanie Kor
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     No opposition 
 
 
            Claimant,
Kordell Kor Trevino, a minor, by and through his parent and guardian ad litem,
Petitioner Stephanie Kor, has agreed to settle his claims against Defendant, Universal
City Studios, LLC, in exchange for a lump sum of $160,000.  If approved, $16,182.34 will be used for
medical expenses, $53,333.33 will be used for attorney’s fees, and $24,336.40 will
be used for other expenses, leaving a balance of $66,147.93 for Claimant to be
deposited at Bank of America in Ventura, California, subject to withdrawal only
upon authorization of the court.
 
            Court
approval is required for all settlements of a minor’s claim.  (Probate Code §§ 3500, 3600, et seq.; Code Civ. Proc. § 372.)  The petition must be verified and “must
contain a full disclosure of all information that has any bearing on the reasonableness
of the compromise, covenant, settlement, or disposition.”¿ (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 7.950.)¿¿
 
            Upon
review, the Court finds the settlement amount and request for attorney’s fees
are fair and reasonable.  Further, the
medical expenses are supported by documentation and the other expenses are set
forth in the memorandum of costs.  The
motion complies with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362.
            
            Accordingly,
the Petition is GRANTED.  The Court sets
an OSC re: Proof of Deposit (minor – Kordell Kor Trevino) for December 15, 2023
at 8:30 a.m.¿ (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 7.953, subd. (a).)¿ If an
acknowledgement of receipt by the financial institution is filed before that
date, no appearance will be required.¿¿
 
            Moving
party to give notice.
