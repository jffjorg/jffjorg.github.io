MOTIONS
TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TO DISCOVERY 



 
MOVING PARTY:               Defendant
Katharine Aiton
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     Plaintiff Carlos
Johnson
 
 
I.          INTRODUCTION
 
On February 5, 2020, Plaintiff, Carlos Johnson, initiated this
action against Defendant, Katharine Aiton, for injuries arising from a motor
vehicle collision. 
 
On September 29, 2023, Defendant filed these motions to
compel Plaintiff’s further responses to Special Interrogatories, Set Two, and
Request for Production of Documents, Set Two. 
Defendant seeks sanctions against Plaintiff and his counsel.
 
Plaintiff filed an opposition.  Defendant replied.
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARD TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES
TO DISCOVERY
 
            Under Code
of Civil Procedure sections 2030.300 and 2031.310 parties may move for a further
response to interrogatories and requests for production of documents, where an
answer to the requests are evasive or incomplete or where an objection is
without merit or too general.  
 
            Notice of
the motions must be given within 45 days of service of the verified response,
otherwise, the propounding party waives any right to compel a further
response.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300, subd. (c); 2031.310, subd. (c).) 
The motions must also be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300, subd. (b)(1);
2031.310, subd. (b)(2).)
 
            Finally,
Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1345 requires that all motions or responses
involving further discovery contain a separate statement with the text of each
request, the response, and a statement of factual and legal reasons for
compelling further responses.  (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1345, subd.
(a)(3).) 
 
III.       DISCUSSION
 
Defendant moves for an order compelling Plaintiff’s further
responses to Special Interrogatories, Set Two, Nos. 37-50, 55-58, and 61-67 and
Request for Production of Documents, Set Two, Nos. 6-10 and 12.  The Court addresses each discovery set in
turn.
 
Special Interrogatories, Nos. 37-50, 55-58, and 61-67
 
These discovery requests seek information on Plaintiff’s
sources of income and total income from 2013 to 2023.  Plaintiff interposed a number of objections based
on overbreadth, ambiguity, privacy, and privileged financial information.  The objections lack merit.  The discovery requests are not overbroad or
ambiguous.  Further, they seek relevant
information to Plaintiff’s ability to perform occupational activities prior to
and after the incident. For this reason, Plaintiff’s withdrawal of his loss of
earnings claim does not moot the discovery. 
Plaintiff’s privacy and privilege concerns do not overcome Defendant’s
need for the discovery.  
 
Plaintiff also submitted evasive substantive responses.  Plaintiff responded to Nos. 37, 38, 39, 48,
49, 50 that he was engaged in employment that was materially different in
2013-2015.  As such, these discovery
requests are not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible
evidence.  However, as discussed, these
requests are directly relevant to the range of Plaintiff’s occupational
activities.  
 
Plaintiff provided supplemental responses to Nos. 61-67.  Plaintiff interposed an additional objection on
the basis that these discovery requests seek information equally available to
Defendant.  Not so.  Nos. 61-67 seek information within
Plaintiff’s personal knowledge.  
 
Request for Production of Documents, Nos. 6-10, and 12
 
            Nos. 6-12
seek income tax returns and W-2 forms, documents relating to Plaintiff’s
sources of income from 2013 to present, documents related to Plaintiff’s
business, Networkingz, and documents related to any communications Plaintiff
had with anyone regarding the incident.  
 
            In
response, Plaintiff interposed meritless objections based on overbreadth, not
reasonably calculated to lead to discovery of admissible evidence, privilege.  The discovery requests are not overbroad and are
relevant to Plaintiff’s claims.  To the
extent Plaintiff asserts privilege, Plaintiff must provide a privilege
log.  To the extent the discovery
requests seek confidential information, Defendant has offered to sign a
protective order. 
 
            Monetary
Sanctions 
 
Defendant seeks sanctions against Plaintiff and his
counsel.  Given that Plaintiff has
withdrawn his loss of earnings claim and the general recognition in case law of
the privacy and privilege interests at issue with income tax returns and W-2
documents, the Court finds Plaintiff had substantial justification to oppose
these motions.  Accordingly, the Court
declines to impose sanctions. 
 
IV.       CONCLUSION
 
            The motions
are granted.  Plaintiff is ordered to
provide responses to Special Interrogatories, Set Two, Nos. 37-50, 55-58, and
61-67 and Request for Production of Documents, Set Two, Nos. 6-10 and 12 within
30 days of this order.
            
            The request
for sanctions is denied.
 
 
Moving parties to give notice, unless waived.
