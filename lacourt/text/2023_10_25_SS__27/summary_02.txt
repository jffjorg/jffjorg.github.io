And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Katharine Aiton, has filed motions to compel the plaintiff, Carlos Johnson, to provide further responses to special interrogatories and a request for production of documents. The defendant seeks sanctions against the plaintiff and his counsel. The court has considered the parties' arguments and finds that the plaintiff's objections to the discovery requests lack merit. The court grants the motions and orders the plaintiff to provide responses to the discovery requests within 30 days. The court also declines to impose sanctions on the plaintiff and his counsel. The parties are notified to give notice of this tentative ruling, and any party who intends to submit on the tentative must send an email to the court indicating their intention to do so.
