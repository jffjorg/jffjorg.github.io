**Significant Statements**
```
The Court agrees that the Complaint is deficient in its allegations supporting punitive damages.
The allegations must be alleged with specificity; conclusory allegations without sufficient facts are not enough.
The Complaint is deficient in its allegations describing the "history of violence" or the prior events that demonstrate the "dangerous propensity".
