[1] MTA also argues the motion should
be denied because MTA does not own or control the subject sidewalk.  Therefore, MTA cannot produce a PMQ for
deposition or produce documents regarding the subject sidewalk.  In support, MTA has pled lack of ownership or
control as an affirmative defense (see MTA’s Answer, ¶ 6) and a Notice of
Non-Jurisdiction (See 0/14/21 Notice of Non-Jurisdiction).  However, even if MTA lacks ownership or
control of the subject sidewalk, MTA does not provide authority that it can
resist a deposition notice by not appearing at all.  Presumably, MTA’s PMQ would provide testimony
supporting the position that MTA does not own or control the subject sidewalk.
