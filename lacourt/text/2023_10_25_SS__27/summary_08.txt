And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Roberto Miranda, et al. v. Marilin Ruiz, et al. (Case No. 23STCV00888). The case involves a motion by the plaintiffs to compel the defendants to provide responses to their discovery requests, as well as a request for sanctions against the defendants and their counsel.

The judge finds that the plaintiffs properly served the defendants with the discovery requests, but the defendants have not provided timely responses. As a result, the judge grants the motions to compel responses to the discovery requests and deems the requests for admissions admitted against the defendants.

The judge also imposes sanctions against the defense counsel in the amount of $3,460, consisting of 5 hours of plaintiffs' counsel's hourly rate and $960 in filing fees.

The judge orders the defendants to provide verified, objection-free responses to the plaintiffs' discovery requests within 30 days of the date of the order. The judge also orders the defense counsel to pay the sanctions within 30 days.

The parties who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the court indicating their intention to submit on the tentative. If a party submits on the tentative and does not appear at the hearing, the opposing party may still appear and argue the matter.
