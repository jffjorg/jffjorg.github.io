And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court is reviewing a petition to approve a minor's compromise, where Penelop Tran, a minor, has agreed to settle her claims against Israel Tapia for $12,000. The settlement amount is fair and reasonable, and the request for attorney's fees is also reasonable. However, the petition cannot be approved due to inconsistencies in Form MC-355, which indicates that Magdalena Guillen, the petitioner and parent of Penelop Tran, is acting as guardian ad litem without providing sufficient evidence of the appointment. The court has continued the hearing to November 29, 2023, and the petitioner is required to file an amended Form MC-355 consistent with this order.
