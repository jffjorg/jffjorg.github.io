MOTION
TO STRIKE PUNITIVE DAMAGES



 
MOVING PARTY:               Defendant
Shianti Louise Lavette Lee
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     Plaintiff Araceli
Castelan
 
 
I.          BACKGROUND
 
            On July 31, 2023, Plaintiff, Araceli Castelan, filed a
complaint against Defendant, Shianti Louise Lavette Lee, for injuries arising
from an attack by Defendant’s two dogs. 
Plaintiff alleges Defendant owned, kept, possessed, harbored, and
controlled two violent canines with a history of attacks of other individuals
in the neighborhood.  Plaintiff seeks punitive
damages.
 
On September 21, 2023, Defendant filed this motion to strike
punitive damages from the Complaint. 
Plaintiff filed an opposition and Defendant replied. 
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARD FOR MOTION TO STRIKE  
            Any
party, within the time allowed to respond to a pleading, may serve and file a
motion to strike the whole pleading or any part thereof.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 435, subd. (b)(1); Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1322, subd. (b).)¿ On a
motion to strike, the court may: (1) strike out any irrelevant, false, or
improper matter inserted in any pleading; or (2) strike out all or any part of
any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of California, a
court rule, or an order of the court.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 436, subds.
(a)-(b); Stafford v. Shultz (1954) 42 Cal.2d 767, 782.)¿ 
            “The
grounds for a motion to strike are limited to matters appearing on the face of
the challenged pleading or matters which must or may be judicially noticed. (§
437, subd. (a); Evid. Code, §§ 451, 452.).” (Garcia v. Sterling (1985)
176 Cal.App.3d 17, 20.) 
A
failure to oppose a motion may be deemed a consent to the granting of the
motion.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.54,
subd. (c).)
 
III.      DISCUSSION
 
A.   
Meet
and Confer¿ 
 
Defense counsel has satisfied this the meet and
confer requirement.¿ (Declaration of Leon A. Victor, ¶ 6.)¿¿¿ 
 
B.  Analysis
 
            Defendant moves for an order to
strike punitive damages allegations from the Complaint.  The allegations appear at Paragraphs 38, 39, and
46, and Paragraph B of the Prayer.
            Punitive damages may be imposed
where it is proven by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant has been
guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice.  (Civ.
Code § 3294, subd. (a).) “Malice” is conduct intended by the defendant to cause
injury to the plaintiff or despicable conduct which is carried on with a
willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.  (Civ. Code § 3294, subd. (c)(1).) “‘Punitive
damages are proper only when the tortious conduct rises to levels of extreme
indifference to the plaintiff’s rights, a level which decent citizens should
not have to tolerate.’ [Citation.]”  (Lackner
v. North (2006) 135 Cal.App.4th 1188, 1210.)  “As amended to include [despicable], the
[Civil Code section 3294] plainly indicates that absent an intent to injure the
plaintiff, ‘malice’ requires more than a ‘willful and conscious’ disregard of
the plaintiffs’ interests.  The
additional component of ‘despicable conduct’ must be found.”  (College Hospital Inc. v. Superior Court (1994)
8 Cal.4th 704, 725.) The statute’s reference to despicable conduct represents a
“new substantive limitation on punitive damage awards.”  (Id.)  Despicable conduct is “conduct which is so
vile, base, contemptible, miserable, wretched or loathsome that it would be
looked down upon and despised by ordinary decent people.  Such conduct has been described as ‘having the
character of outrage frequently associated with crime.’”  (Tomaselli v. Transamerica Ins. Co. (1994)
25 Cal.App.4th 1269, 1287.)  Further,
“[t]here must be evidence that defendant acted with knowledge of the probable
dangerous consequences to plaintiff’s interests and deliberately failed to
avoid these consequences.”  (Flyer’s
Body Shop Profit Sharing Plan v. Ticor Title Ins. Co. (1986) 185 Cal.App.3d
1149, 1155; see also Angie M. v. Superior Court (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th
1217, 1228 [“Conscious disregard for the safety of another may be sufficient
where the defendant is aware of the probably dangerous consequences of his or
her conduct and he or she willfully fails to avoid such consequences”].)
            A motion to strike punitive damages
is properly granted where a plaintiff does not state a prima facie claim for
punitive damages, including allegations that defendant is guilty of oppression,
fraud or malice.  (Turman v. Turning
Point of Cent. California, Inc. (2010) 191 Cal.App.4th 53, 63.)  “Mere negligence, even gross negligence, is
not sufficient to justify such an award” for punitive damages.  (Kendall Yacht Corp. v. United California
Bank (1975) 50 Cal.App.3d 949, 958.)  The allegations supporting a request for
punitive damages must be alleged with specificity; conclusory allegations
without sufficient facts are not enough.  (Smith v. Superior Court (1992) 10 Cal.App.4th
1033, 1041-1042.)
Defendant argues the Court should strike the
punitive damages allegations from the Complaint because there are no specific
factual allegations to show that Defendant acted with oppression, fraud, or
malice within the meaning of Civil Code section 3294.  The Court agrees. The Complaint states in
conclusory fashion that the two violent canines had “a history of attacks of
other individuals in the neighborhood” (Complaint, ¶ 4, 14), that the canines
“have unusually dangerous propensities” (Complaint, ¶ 13, 22, 40, 41), and that
the Defendant knowingly left them unleased and unrestrained in a public place
(Complaint, ¶ 13.)  However, there are no
factual allegations describing the “history of violence” or the prior events
that demonstrate the “dangerous propensity.” 
The allegations are vague and lacking in the specificity required under
the punitive damages statute.  The
allegations supporting a request for punitive damages must be alleged with
specificity; conclusory allegations without sufficient facts are not
enough.  (Smith, supra, 10
Cal.App.4th at pp. 1041-1042.)
 
Plaintiff contends the Complaint sets forth sufficient
allegations to support punitive damages. 
In support, Plaintiff points to Paragraphs 9, 12, 42, and 44, among
others.  However, these allegations describe
either the attack itself or Defendant’s state of mind on the day of the
attack.  None of these allegations, or
others to which Plaintiff points, set forth with specificity the canines’
history of violence and dangerous propensities. 
The Complaint is deficient.       
 
            IV.        CONCLUSION

            
Based on the foregoing, the motion to strike punitive
damages from the Complaint is GRANTED. 
Leave to amend is GRANTED.  
 
Plaintiff is to file and serve a First Amended Complaint consistent
with this order within 10 days of the date of this order.
 
Defendant is to file and serve a responsive pleading to the First
Amended Complaint within 20 days of service of the amended pleading.
 
Moving party to give notice, unless waived.
