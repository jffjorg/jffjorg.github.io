CASE:                                Magdalena Guillen, et al. v. Israel Tapia, et al.
 
CASE NO.:                 21STCV17846
 





















 
PETITION
TO APPROVE MINOR’S COMPROMISE
 


 
MOVING PARTY:               Petitioner
Magdalena Guillen
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     No opposition 
 
 
            Claimant,
Penelop Tran, a minor, by and through her parent, Petitioner Magdalena Guillen,
has agreed to settle her claims against Defendant, Israel Tapia, in exchange
for a lump sum of $12,000.  If approved,
$3,075 will be used for medical expenses, and $4,000 will be used for
attorney’s fees, leaving a balance of $4,925 for Claimant to be deposited at
Bank of America in Glendale, California, subject to withdrawal only on
authorization of the court.
 
            Court
approval is required for all settlements of a minor’s claim.  (Probate Code §§ 3500, 3600, et seq.; Code Civ. Proc. § 372.)  The petition must be verified and “must
contain a full disclosure of all information that has any bearing on the
reasonableness of the compromise, covenant, settlement, or disposition.”¿ (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 7.950.)¿¿
 
            Upon
review, the Court finds the settlement amount is fair and reasonable, as is the
request for attorney’s fees.  The Court
further finds that the medical expenses are supported by documentation.  However, the Petition cannot be approved.  Forms MC-350 and MC-351 each indicate Petitioner
is the parent of the claimant.  Yet Form
MC-355 indicates Petitioner is acting as Claimant’s guardian ad litem.  There is no evidence showing Petitioner has
been appointed guardian ad litem for Claimant. 
Item 3 of Form MC-355 additionally indicates that each account is to be
opened in the legal name of the petitioner as guardian.  There is no evidence submitted showing a
guardianship for Claimant’s estate exists or that Petitioner is the guardian of
Claimant’s estate. Petitioner should select “parent” at Item 3 of Form MC-355
or provide proof that she is Claimant’s guardian ad litem.
            
            Accordingly,
the hearing for the Petition is CONTINUED to November 29, 2023 at 8:30 AM in
Department 27 of Spring Street Courthouse. 
Petitioner is to file an amended Form MC-355 consistent with this order
no later than 5 court days before the hearing. 
            Moving
party to give notice.
