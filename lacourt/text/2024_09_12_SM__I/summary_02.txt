And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on an ex parte application to vacate an order dismissing a cross-complaint. The court initially set the motion to dismiss for July 23, 2024, but continued it for one week due to a cyberattack. Notice was mailed to other counsel, but not to Ashkar's current counsel, Mr. Malone. The court has determined that it failed to give notice to Ashkar's counsel at all, and therefore, the application is well taken and will be granted. The order granting the motion to dismiss is vacated, and the court will not entertain the motion for fees today. However, the court will allow further briefing on the fee question and will discuss a new hearing date for the motion to dismiss. The court apologizes to both parties for its error in service, which has delayed the resolution of the case and required unnecessary appearances.
