RESPONDING
PARTY: Plaintiff ABC Wholesale (“Plaintiff”)
 
            The Court has considered the moving
and opposition papers. No reply brief has been filed.  Any reply brief was due five court days before
the hearing.  (Code of Civil Procedure (“CCP”)
§ 1005(b).)
 
BACKGROUND        
            This action
arises from an insurance coverage dispute. On July 10, 2024, Plaintiff filed a
complaint against Defendants Kinsale Insurance Company (“Kinsale”), Van Long
Silk & Crafts, LLC, AEG and Does 1 through 50 (collectively, “Defendants”).
On September 6, 2024, Plaintiff filed the operative first amended complaint
(the “FAC”) alleging causes of action for: (1) breach of contract; (2) breach
of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; (3) negligence; (4)
professional negligence; and (5) negligent misrepresentation. 
 
            On October
8, 2024, AEG filed the instant demurrer (the “Demurrer”). Plaintiff filed an
opposition (the “Opposition”) to the Demurrer on December 16, 2024. 
 
MEET AND CONFER 
            The
parties have satisfied the meet and confer requirement.  
 
DISCUSSION
            A demurrer for sufficiency tests
whether the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007)
147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747; see CCP § 430.10, subd. (e).) 
 
To sufficiently allege a cause of action,
a complaint must allege all the ultimate facts—that is, the facts needed to
establish each element of the cause of action pleaded. (Committee on
Children’s Television, Inc. v. General Foods Corp. (1983) 35 Cal.3d 197,
212, superseded by statute as stated in Branick v. Downey Savings & Loan
Assn. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 235, 242.) “[E]ach evidentiary fact that might
eventually form part of the plaintiff’s proof need not be alleged.” (C.A. v.
William S. Hart Union High School Dist. (2012) 53 Cal.4th 861, 872.) 
 
In testing the sufficiency of the cause of
action, the demurrer admits the truth of all material facts properly pleaded. (Aubry
v. Tri-City Hospital Dist. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 966-67.) Courts read the
allegations liberally and in context. (Taylor v. City of Los Angeles Dept.
of Water and Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228, disapproved on other
grounds, Jones v. Lodge at Torrey Pines Partnership (2008) 42 Cal.4th
1158, 1162.) A demurrer, however, “does not admit contentions, deductions or
conclusions of fact or law.” (Daar v. Yellow Cab Co. (1967) 67 Cal.2d
695, 713.)  
 
Fourth Cause of
Action – Professional Negligence 
            In order to state a claim for
negligence, a plaintiff must allege the elements of (1) “the existence of a
legal duty of care,” (2) “breach of that duty,” and (3) “proximate cause
resulting in an injury.” (McIntyre v. Colonies-Pacific, LLC (2014) 228
Cal.App.4th 664, 671.) Professional negligence is defined as “a negligent
action or omission . . . in the rendering of professional services.”  (CCP,
§ 340.5)  In Biakanja v. Irving, the California Supreme Court
discusses that an action for negligence may be maintained against one not in
privity with a plaintiff under certain circumstances. (see Biakanja v.
Irving (1958) 49 Cal.2d 647) Factors to balance include: “the extent to
which the transaction was intended to affect the plaintiff, the foreseeability
of harm to him, the degree of certainty that the
plaintiff suffered injury, the closeness of the connection between the
defendant's conduct and the injury suffered, the moral blame attached to
the defendant's conduct, and the policy of preventing future harm (Biakanja,
supra (1958) 49 Cal.2d at 650.) 
 
            In this case, Plaintiff filed an
insurance claim with its insurance company, Kinsale, for smoke damage resulting
from a fire at a neighboring business. (FAC, ¶ 69.) Kinsale hired AEG to
prepare an environmental assessment report to determine the extent of the smoke
contamination. (FAC, ¶ 70.) Plaintiff argues that AEG owes Plaintiff a duty of
care because the assessment report was intended to affect Plaintiff and it was
foreseeable that Kinsale would rely on the findings in the report in
determining whether Plaintiff’s insurance claim was covered. (Opp., pp. 4:15-5:11;
FAC, ¶¶ 79-80.)  
            In the Demurrer, AEG argues that they
do not owe a duty of care to Plaintiff because the assessment report was
prepared solely to benefit Kinsale, not Plaintiff, and that Kinsale’s denying
coverage for Plaintiff’s claim was not reasonably foreseeable. (Demurrer, pp. 7:10-8:23)

 
            Based on the duty factors in Biakanja
set forth above, Plaintiff has not established that AEG owes Plaintiff a
duty of care. For groups of information-supplying professionals, liability is
limited to those persons the information is intended to benefit. (see Bily
v. Arthur Young & Co. (1992) 3 Cal.4th 370, 408) Kinsale hired AEG to
perform an environmental assessment to aid Kinsale in evaluating Plaintiff’s
insurance claim. Plaintiff’s argument that AEG “knew Plaintiff would rely on
the contamination assessment for inventory management and insurance-related
decisions” is unavailing because the report was plainly intended to benefit
Kinsale, not Plaintiff. (Opp. p. 7:13-15.) Plaintiff’s argument that the AEG assessment
was meant to benefit Plaintiff is further undermined by the fact that Plaintiff
could have, and in fact did, hire its own expert to perform an assessment. (FAC
¶ 27) “A broad rule of liability is of dubious benefit when an efficient means
of self-protection is available.” (Bily, supra, 3 Cal.4th at 409) 
 
The ‘foreseeability of harm’ and ‘degree
of certainty’ Biakanja factors weigh in AEG’s favor as well. AEG was neither
responsible for interpreting Plaintiff’s insurance policy nor determining the type
of damage covered under the policy. In addition, the FAC alleges that Plaintiff’s
insurance claim was denied not solely based on the environmental assessment report
but also based on a pollution exclusion in the insurance contract. (FAC ¶ 32) Thus,
there was not a ‘high degree of certainty’ that the outcome of the assessment
report would cause Plaintiff’s injury. Accordingly, Plaintiff has not alleged
facts that show that AEG owes Plaintiff a legal duty. 
 
Thus, AEG’s Demurrer to the fourth cause
of action is SUSTAINED, with leave to amend. 
 
Fifth Cause of
Action – Negligent Misrepresentation
            A negligent misrepresentation cause
of action requires a plaintiff to allege that the defendant misrepresented a
material fact that the plaintiff justifiably relied upon resulting in damage. (Bily
v. Arthur Young & Co. (1992) 3 Cal.4th 370, 407-408; Borba v. Thomas
(1977) 70 Cal.App.3d 144, 152.) 
 
            Plaintiff alleges that AEG
misrepresented the extent of smoke contamination in the assessment report to
Kinsale which Kinsale then relied upon in denying Plaintiff’s insurance claim.
(FAC ¶¶ 90-93). This is insufficient to establish a cause of action for
negligent misrepresentation because, although Plaintiff alleges harm resulting
from a misrepresentation, the cause of action requires that Plaintiff—not a
third party—justifiably relied on said misrepresentation. Whereas here, Plaintiff
asserts that AEG misrepresented a material fact, and that Kinsale justifiably
relied upon that fact. Thus, Plaintiff has not stated facts sufficient to establish
a negligent misrepresentation cause of action against AEG. 
 
Thus, AEG’s Demurrer to the fifth cause of
action is SUSTAINED, with leave to amend. 
 
            AEG’s Demurrer to the FAC is SUSTAINED,
with 30 days leave to amend. 
 
Moving
