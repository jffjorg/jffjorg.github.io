MOVING PARTY:  Defendant Lori C. Murphy (“Defendant”)
RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff
Grayson Marshall (“Plaintiff”)
 
            The Court has considered the moving,
opposition and reply papers. 
 
BACKGROUND
             This action arises from alleged habitability
issues that occurred at a property located at 3714 Fletcher Drive, Los Angeles,
CA 90065 (the “Property”). On December 4, 2023, Plaintiff filed a complaint (the
“Complaint”) against Defendant and Does 1 through 100, inclusive, alleging
causes of action for: (1) negligence, (2) breach of implied warranty of
habitability; (3) violation of Los Angeles Municipal Code § 151.10 et seq.;
and (4) civil penalties for violation of Los Angeles Anti-Harassment Ordinance
§ 45.30 et seq.   
 
            On October 1, 2024, Defendant filed
three motions: (1) motion to compel further responses to form interrogatories
(FIs); (2) motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories (SIs);
and (3) motion to compel further responses to requests for production of
documents (RFPs) (collectively, the “Motions”). 
 
            On December 16, 2024, Plaintiff filed
a consolidated opposition (the “Opposition”) to the Motions. On December 18,
2024, Defendant filed three replies (the “Replies”) to the Opposition. 
 
MEET AND CONFER 
            The
parties have satisfied the meet and confer requirement.   
 
DISCUSSION
A motion to compel a further response is
used when a party gives unsatisfactory answers or makes untenable objections to
interrogatories, demands to produce, or requests for admission. (Code of Civil
Procedure (“CCP”), § 2031.310, subd. (a); Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting,
Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.)
 
To compel a further response to
interrogatories, the movant can show that: (1) the responding party’s answer to
a particular interrogatory is evasive or incomplete (CCP, § 2030.300, subd.
(a)(1)); (2) the responding party’s exercise of the option to produce documents
in response to an interrogatory was unwarranted or the required specification
of those documents was inadequate (CCP, § 2030.300, subd. (a)(2)); and (3) the
responding party’s objection to an interrogatory is without merit or too
general (CCP, § 2030.300, subd. (a)(3); see, e.g., Williams v. Superior
Court (2017) 3 Cal.5th 531, 550 [defendant’s argument that plaintiff was
required to establish good cause or prove merits of underlying claim before
propounding interrogatories without merit]).
 
To request further production, a movant
must establish: (1) good cause for the production (CCP, § 2031.310, subd.
(b)(1); Sinaiko, supra, at p. 403); and (2) that a further
response is needed because (a) the responding party’s statement of compliance
with the demand to produce is incomplete CCP, § 2031.310, subd. (a)(1)), (b)
the responding party’s representation that it is unable to comply is
inadequate, incomplete, or evasive (CCP, § 2031.310, subd. (a)(2)), (c) the
responding party’s objection in the response is without merit or is too general
(CCP, § 2031.310, subd. (a)(3); Catalina Island Yacht Club v. Superior Court
(2015) 242 Cal.App.4th 1116, 1127), or (d) if the responding party objected to
the production of ESI on the ground that it is not reasonably accessible the
movant can show that the (i) ESI is reasonably accessible or (ii) there is good
cause for production of the ESI regardless of its accessibility (CCP, §
2031.310, subd. (e)).
 
            Defendant
argues that further responses are needed because Plaintiff responded to the
discovery requests with only minimally substantive responses and mostly
objections and has not produced any documents in response to the RFPs. (All
Mots., pp. 5-6.) In the Opposition, Plaintiff argues that the Motions should be
denied because Defendants did not conduct an informal discovery conference
(“IDC”) as required by the parties’ joint discovery resolution stipulation (see
9/12/24 Stipulation) and because Plaintiff did not file separate statements.
(Opp. p. 1:3-11.) In the Replies, Defendant states that he submitted a stipulation
regarding an IDC to the Court and did not receive a response within ten days,
thus allowing him to proceed to file the instant Motions. (Replies, p. 3) 
 
            Upon
review, the Court finds that Plaintiff’s objections to the discovery requests
are without merit. The discovery resolution stipulation between the parties
permits a party to file a motion to compel if the Court has not granted or
denied a submitted request for IDC within ten days of filing the request. (9/12/24
Stipulation, ¶¶ 3(d), 4) Further, Plaintiff has not provided any substantive
argument as to why the objections are meritorious, or why he has not produced
any documents in response to the RFPs. Thus, the Motions are GRANTED.  
 
ORDER
The Motion to Compel Further Response to
Form Interrogatories is GRANTED. 
The Motion to Compel Further Response to
Special Interrogatories is GRANTED. 
The Motion to Compel Further Response to
Requests for Production is GRANTED. 
Plaintiff is ordered to provide further Code-compliant,
verified responses to the subject discovery within 20 days of this order.  With regard to the RFPs, Plaintiff is ordered
to state which documents, by Bates number, are responsive to each individual
RFP.  Plaintiff is further ordered to
produce all responsive documents, properly Bates-stamped, to the RFPs within 20
days of this order and to provide a Privilege Log as to any documents properly
withheld based upon privilege only.
 
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
