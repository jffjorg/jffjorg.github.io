MOVING PARTY:  Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant Walter Cuevas
(“Plaintiff”)
RESPONDING PARTY: None
 
            The Court has considered the moving
papers. No opposition has been filed. 
 
BACKGROUND
            This action arises out of an
employment relationship.  Plaintiff filed the operative first amended
complaint (the “FAC”) against defendants Centurion Protection Services
(“Centurion”), Richard Ray Dudgeon (“Dudgeon”), Tom Rogers, and Does 1 through
5 (collectively, “Defendants”) alleging: (1) Private Attorneys General Act; (2)
failure to pay overtime wages in violation of Labor Code section 510; (3)
failure to reimburse and indemnify for expenditures; (4) failure to provide
meal and rest periods or compensation in lieu thereof in violation of Labor
Code section 226.7; (5) Labor Code section 203 waiting time penalties; (6)
Labor Code section 1198.5, subdivision (k) penalty; (7) Labor Code section 226,
subdivision (f) penalty; (8) intentional infliction of emotional distress; (9)
violation of Penal Code section 637.7; and (10) negligent infliction of
emotional distress. 
 
Centurion and Dudgeon (collectively,
“Cross-Complainants”) filed a second amended cross-complaint (the “SAXC”) against
Plaintiff and Roes 1 through 5 alleging: (1) breach of contract; (2)
intentional interference with contractual relations; (3) intentional
interference with prospective economic relations; (4) intentional
misrepresentation; (5) defamation; and (6) libel. 
            
On September 12, 2023, Plaintiff filed a special
motion to strike (the “Anti-SLAPP Motion”). On October 10, 2023, the Court granted
the Anti-SLAPP motion. On October 18, 2023, Cross-Complainants filed a Notice
of Appeal of the October 10 order. On July 24, 2024, the Court of Appeal affirmed
the ruling. 
 
            On
October 28, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant motion for attorney’s fees (the
“Motion”). No opposition has been filed.  
DISCUSSION
      Pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure (“CCP”) section 425.16 subdivision (c)(1), “a
prevailing defendant on a special motion to strike shall be entitled to recover
his or her attorney's fees and costs.” (See also Ketchum v. Moses (2001)
24 Cal.4th 1122, 1141-1142.) Parties may seek attorney fees and costs in
connection with a special motion to strike (1) in the moving papers, (2) in a
subsequently filed motion, or (3) as part of a cost memorandum. (Melbostad
v. Fisher (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 987, 992.)¿The moving party has the burden
of proof in a motion for attorney’s fees. (ComputerXpress, Inc. v. Jackson
(2001) 93 Cal.App.4th 993, 1020.) ¿ 
 
Prevailing Party
      “[A]
party who partially prevails on an anti-SLAPP motion must generally be
considered a prevailing party unless the results of the motion were so
insignificant that the party did not achieve any practical benefit from
bringing the motion.” (Mann v. Quality Old Time Serv. Inc. (2006) 139
Cal.App.4th 328, 344-345, overruled on other grounds in Baral v. Schnitt
(2016) 1 Cal.5th 376, 392-396 [disapproving Mann in its “refusal to
permit anti-SLAPP motions to reach distinct claims within pleaded counts”];
accord. Moran v. Endres (2006) 135 Cal.App.4th 952, 956 [defendants were
not entitled to fees, where their partial success on their anti-SLAPP motion
“in every practical sense meant nothing”].) This no-practical-benefit doctrine
does not apply where the defendant “successfully narrowed the scope of the
lawsuit, limiting discovery, reducing potential recoverable damages, and
altering the settlement posture of the case.” (Mann, supra, 139
Cal.App.4th at 340.) The no-practical-benefit doctrine is a “narrow” exception
to the general rule mandating a fee award to a partially successful defendant.
(Morrow v. Los Angeles Unified School Dist. (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 1424,
1446.) Except with limited types of claims, a prevailing defendant on a special
motion to strike shall be entitled to recover that defendant’s attorney’s fees
and costs.” (CCP, § 425.16, subd. (c)(1).) Whether a partially successful
defendant achieved sufficient benefit to be a “prevailing party” is left to the
discretion of the trial court and reviewed accordingly. (Mann, supra,
139 Cal.App.4th at 340.)
 
            Plaintiff argues that he is the
prevailing party on the Anti-SLAPP Motion and thus is entitled to recover
attorney’s fees. (Memo. of Points and Auths., pp. 2:23-3:4.) In ruling on the
Anti-SLAPP Motion, this Court issued a ruling striking certain paragraphs of Cross-Complainants’
claims after concluding that the text message at issue in those paragraphs
constituted “protected activity” under Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16
and that Cross-Complainants’ had not made a showing that the claims had minimal
merit. (10/10/2023 Minute Order.) On July 24, 2024, the Court of Appeal
affirmed the ruling. (10/18/2024 Appeal-Remittitur-Affirmed NOA 10/13/2023
B333621) 
 
Plaintiff is thus the prevailing party for
anti-SLAPP fee recovery purposes. (CCP, § 425.16, subd. (c)(1).)
 
Reasonableness of
Fees 
In determining whether the attorneys’ fees
requested under Section 425.16 are “reasonable,” the Court “may and should
consider the nature of the litigation, its difficulty, the amount involved, the
skill required and the skill employed in handling the litigation, the attention
given, the success of the attorney’s efforts, his learning, his age, and his
experience in the particular type of work demanded . . . [,] the intricacies
and importance of the litigation, the labor and necessity for skilled legal training
and ability in trying the cause, and the time consumed.” (Church of
Scientology v. Wollersheim (1996) 42 Cal.App.4th 628, 659, disapproved
on other grounds by Equilon Enters. v. Consumer Cause, Inc. (2002)
29 Cal.4th 53, 68, fn. 5, quotation marks omitted, emphasis omitted.) 
 
This approach “concentrates on the
practical impact of a partially successful motion on the overall litigation[.]”
(Id. at p. 347.) To that end, in adjusting the lodestar for overlapping
work, the court considers such factors as (1) the extent to which the
defendants’ litigation posture was advanced by the anti-SLAPP motion and
appeal; (2) whether the same factual allegations remain to be litigated; (3)
whether discovery and motion practice have been narrowed; (4) the extent to
which future litigation expenses and strategy were impacted by the motion; and
(5) any other applicable relevant factors, such as the experience and abilities
of the attorneys and the novelty and difficulty of the issues. (Id. at
p. 345.) 
 
The successful party is also entitled to
fees incurred in filing the motion for anti-SLAPP fees, also referred to as
“fees on fees.” (Ketchum, supra, 24 Cal.4th at p. 1141 [in
anti-SLAPP, CCP § 425.16 context].)
 
            Plaintiff’s counsel asserts that the
requested fees are reasonable because the hourly rate is reasonable for this
type of employment litigation based upon counsel’s educational background, legal
experience and comparable rates in the legal community. (Gutierrez Decl. ¶ 11) Plaintiff
requests fees and costs in the total amount of $32,608.20 based upon counsel’s
rate of $650/hour for: (1) 39.5 hours preparing and
researching the Anti-SLAPP Motion as well as researching case law and preparing
the respondent’s brief on appeal; (2) 7.0 hours preparing this Motion; (3) 2.5
hours replying to the opposition; (4) 0.5 hours attending the hearing; (5)
$412.20 in court costs for the appeal; and (6) $21.00 for the filing
transaction costs. (Gutierrez Decl. ¶¶ 11-13)
 
            The Court finds that the fee rates
sought by Plaintiff are reasonable based on fee rates in the Los Angeles County
area and based on the declaration of counsel supporting those rates.  (Gutierrez Decl. ¶¶ 6-11) Upon review of the time
entries submitted with this Motion, the Court notes that there are three
entries which pertain to work on motions other than the Anti-SLAPP Motion and
the instant Motion. (Ex. D [9/8/23 entry for 0.3 hours; 9/26/23 entry for 0.1
hours; 10/10/23 entry for 0.4 hours].) The time entries provided add up 38.8
hours for the Anti-SLAPP Motion and 6.9 hours for the instant Motion. In
addition, as no opposition was filed, a 2.5 hour reduction is appropriate. 
 
Accordingly, the Court will GRANT
Plaintiff attorney’s fees and costs for the Anti-SLAPP Motion and the instant
Motion for attorney’s fees in the reduced amount of $30,463.20 based upon
counsel’s rate of $650/hour for: (1) 38.8 hours for the Anti-SLAPP Motion and
appeal; (2) 6.9 hours for this Motion; (3) 0.5 hours attending the hearing; (4)
$412.20 in court costs for the appeal; and (5) $21.00 for the filing
transaction costs.
 
 
            Thus, Plaintiff’s Motion is GRANTED,
in part. Cross-Complainants are ordered to pay $30,463.20 to Plaintiff within
20 days of this order. 
 
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.

tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
