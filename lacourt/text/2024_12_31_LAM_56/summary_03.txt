Significant Statements:
  - "Plaintiff has not established that AEG owes Plaintiff a duty of care."
  - "Plaintiff’s argument that AEG ‘knew Plaintiff would rely on the contamination assessment for inventory management and insurance-related decisions’ is unavailing because the report was plainly intended to benefit Kinsale, not Plaintiff."
  - "Plaintiff’s argument that the AEG assessment was meant to benefit Plaintiff is further undermined by the fact that Plaintiff could have, and in fact did, hire its own expert to perform an assessment."
  - "A broad rule of liability is of dubious benefit when an efficient means of self-protection is available."

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the demurrer filed by AEG, American Environmental Group, Inc., and AEG Holco LLC, and the opposition filed by ABC Wholesale, Inc. The dispute revolves around whether AEG owes a duty of care to ABC Wholesale, Inc. due to an environmental assessment report prepared by AEG.

The judge finds that ABC Wholesale, Inc. has not established that AEG owes a duty of care. The report was intended to benefit Kinsale Insurance Company, not ABC Wholesale, Inc., and ABC Wholesale, Inc. could have hired its own expert to perform an assessment. The judge also finds that the "foreseeability of harm" and "degree of certainty" factors weigh in favor of AEG.

The judge sustains AEG's demurrer to the fourth cause of action for professional negligence and the fifth cause of action for negligent misrepresentation, with leave to amend. The judge also sustains AEG's demurrer to the operative first amended complaint, with 30 days leave to amend.

The parties are ordered to give notice of this ruling, and any party intending to submit on this tentative must send an email to the court as directed by the instructions on the court's website.
