REASONING
 
Plaintiff
has the initial burden of demonstrating good cause on a motion to compel
further responses to Requests by making a facts specific showing of relevance. (See
Code Civ. Proc. §2031.310, subd., (b)(1); Kirkland v. Supr. Ct. (2002)
95 Cal.App.4th 92, 98 [“Once good cause was shown, the burden shifted to
Kirkland to justify his objection.”].) It is only after Plaintiff  demonstrates good cause to the satisfaction of
the Court that the burden shifts to GM to justify its objections. This burden
is no different in an action under the Song Beverly Act, and Plaintiff fails to
cite any authority to the contrary.
 
Plaintiff
has met its burden to show good cause to compel production of documents
relating to other customer complaints involving vehicles of the same make,
model and year. Such information would be relevant to GM’s knowledge of the
particular defect in the plaintiff’s vehicle and its good faith or bad faith
attempts at compliance with the Act. Plaintiff establishes the relevance of
these complaints GM’s alleged willful violation of the Song-Beverly Act. The
nature of other complaints regarding the same vehicle type is also relevant to
what constitutes a “reasonable” number of repair attempts.
 
GM
fails to demonstrate that production in response to these Requests would be
unduly burdensome. Counsel’s declaration does not set forth specific facts
regarding what production in response to these Requests would entail, or how
production in response to these Requests would be unduly burdensome. “The
objection based upon burden must be sustained by evidence showing the quantum
of work required, while to support an objection of oppression there must be
some showing either of an intent to create an unreasonable burden or that the
ultimate effect of the burden is incommensurate with the result sought.” (West
Pico Furniture Co. of Los Angeles v. Supr. Ct. (1961) 56 Cal.2d 407, 417 [discussing
such objections asserted to interrogatories].) 
Further, GM fails to demonstrate that production in response to these
Requests would include trade secret information or why such information could
not be protected by a confidentiality protective order. 
 
Defendant
is ordered to serve further responses to request nos _______________________ in
full compliance with CCP §§ 2031.220, 2031.230 and 2031.240 in ______ days.  Defendant’s objections, except for privilege
are OVERRULED.  The parties are to submit
a stipulated confidentiality protective order relating to any documents or
information requested that GM believes are confidential and provide a
supplemental response confirming those documents will be produced. Any other
documents withheld based on privilege shall be sufficiently identified in a privilege
log to be served with the supplemental response.
