Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has ruled that Philip M. Horowitz's motion to quash service of summons for lack of personal jurisdiction is GRANTED. The Judge finds that Marvin Weiss has not met his burden to show that Horowitz purposefully availed himself to the specific jurisdiction of California through the email communication. The Judge also finds that Weiss has not provided sufficient evidence to support his claims of defamation.

The Judge also denied Weiss's request for jurisdictional discovery, finding that Weiss failed to identify specific areas of inquiry he would pursue in a jurisdictional discovery inquiry as to Horowitz specifically.
