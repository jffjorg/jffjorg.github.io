And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiff, Guillermo Castellanos, has moved to compel further responses to requests for production (RFPs) from the defendant, General Motors, LLC (GM). The plaintiff seeks documents related to other customer complaints involving vehicles of the same make, model, and year, as well as internal analysis or investigation by GM regarding the defect at issue. The defendant objects to the production of these documents, claiming that it would be unduly burdensome and that the documents contain confidential information.

The court finds that the plaintiff has met its burden to show good cause to compel production of the documents. The court orders GM to produce the documents and pay sanctions in the amount of $3,750.00. The court also orders the parties to meet and confer to prepare a proposed order to identify the requested documents that GM has and will produce. If the parties are unable to agree, they are to file a joint statement identifying their proposed order and alternative terms. The hearing is continued to a later date for the court's review of the order.
