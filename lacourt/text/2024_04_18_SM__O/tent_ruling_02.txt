RESP.
PARTY:         Plaintiff Sara Scott
 
TENTATIVE
RULING
            Defendant
Kevin Sands, D.D.S.’s Motion for Undertaking pursuant to CCP § 1030 is GRANTED.
Plaintiff is ordered to post a bond for $__________________ [to be determined
at the hearing]. Defendant establishes that Plaintiff resides out of state.
Defendant established that he has a reasonable possibility of prevailing on the
claims through expert declarations. 
  
            CCP §1030(a) states “When the
plaintiff in an action or special proceeding resides out of the state, or is a
foreign corporation, the defendant may at any time apply to the court by
noticed motion for an order requiring the plaintiff to file an undertaking to
secure an award of costs and attorney's fees which may be awarded in the action
or special proceeding. For the purposes of this section, “attorney's fees”
means reasonable attorney's fees a party may be authorized to recover by a
statute apart from this section or by contract.” (Code Civ. Pro. § 1030, subd.
(a).) 
 
            CCP §1030(b) states “The motion
shall be made on the grounds that the plaintiff resides out of the state or is
a foreign corporation and that there is a reasonable possibility that the
moving defendant will obtain judgment in the action or special proceeding. The
motion shall be accompanied by an affidavit in support of the grounds for the
motion and by a memorandum of points and authorities. The affidavit shall set
forth the nature and amount of the costs and attorney's fees the defendant has
incurred and expects to incur by the conclusion of the action or special
proceeding.” (Code Civ. Pro. § 1030, subd. (b).)
 
            “Code of Civil Procedure section
1030 provides that upon a defendant's motion, the trial court is required to
order an out-of-state plaintiff to file an undertaking to secure recoverable
costs and attorney's fees if the defendant shows a reasonable possibility that
it will obtain judgment in the action.” (See Baltayan v. Estate of Getemyan
(2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 1427, 1430.) The moving defendant is not required to show
that the out-of-state plaintiff has no possibility of prevailing, but only that
moving defendant has a “reasonable possibility” of prevailing. (Id. at
1432 [finding that moving defendants' sufficiently sustained their burden by
directing court to arbitrator's award and police report]; Shannon v. Sims
Service Center, Inc. (1985) 164 Cal.App.3d 907, 914 [reasonable probability
of prevailing established by prior arbitration award in defendant’s favor on
plaintiff’s claims].)
 
            “Expert evidence in a malpractice suit is conclusive
as to the proof of the prevailing standard of skill and learning in the
locality and of the propriety of particular conduct by the practitioner in
particular instances because such standard and skill is not a matter of general
knowledge and can only be supplied by expert testimony.” (Willard v.
Hagemeister (1981) 121 Cal.App.3d 406, 412.)
 
            It is undisputed that Plaintiff Sara
Scott (“Scott”) is not a resident of California. (See De Heras Decl., ¶¶ 2, 3,
Ex. B “Plaintiff RFA Responses” No. 2, C “Plaintiff FROG Responses No. 2.5.) 
 
            Defendant Kevin Sands, D.D.S
(“Sands”) provides an admissible expert declaration from Mark Exler, D.D.S, a
licensed dentist in the state of California, and a “Diplomate of the American
Board of Prosthodontics.” stating that Sands met the applicable standard of
care in the treatment of Scott, thus demonstrating there is a reasonable possibility
Sands will prevail on the action. (See Motjon, Ex. D, Exler Decl., ¶¶ 1–2, 5,
6.) Mark Exler D.D.S specifically declares:
 
5.
I have reviewed Dr. Sands’ dental records and radiology for patient Sara Scott.
I relied on these materials as well as my education, training and experience in
forming my opinions. 
 
6.
Based on my review of the available materials, I found no evidence that the
restorative treatment performed by Dr. Sands for Ms. Scott was performed below
the standard of care or caused her harm based on a reasonable medical
probability.
 
(Ibid.)
 
            Scott submits expert testimony to
refute Sands expert testimony but Scott’s expert testimony does not show that there
is no reasonable possibility that Scott will prevail on the claims. (See Code
Civ. Pro. § 1030; see also Baltayan, supra, 90 Cal.App.4th at p.1430
[“the trial court is required to order an out-of-state plaintiff to file an
undertaking to secure recoverable costs and attorney's fees if the defendant
shows a reasonable possibility that it will obtain judgment in the action”.)  The Court finds that Sands expert testimony is
enough to reach a reasonable possibility that he will prevail on the action
through negating the negligence element of duty or standard of care. 
 
            Sands submits an affidavit stating
the nature and amount of reasonable attorney’s fees, and expert costs Sands has
incurred and expects to incur pursuant to CCP § 1030(b), totaling $33,095.00. Specifically,
Sands declares the following costs:
 
First
Appearance Fee - incurred cost $435.00 
Motion
for Summary Judgment - projected cost $500.00 
Motion
for Undertaking Fee - projected cost $60.00 
Deposition
of Plaintiff - projected cost $3,500.00 
Deposition
of Sands - projected cost $3,500.00 
Deposition
of Expert - projected cost $3,500.00 
Expert
Witness Fees - projected cost $15,000.00
Jury
Fees - two week trial, one half cost – projected cost $1,750.00 
Court
Reporting Fees - two week trial, one half - projected cost $3,850.00 
Trial
Exhibits and Blow Ups - projected cost $1,000.00 
Total
$33,095.00
 
(Motion,
p. 6, De Heras Decl., ¶ 5.)
 
            Scott argues in the alternative that
the $15,000 in expert witness fees, and the $3500 for deposition costs
requested by Sands is excessive and the total award should be lowered to
$15,000.  Sands argues that pursuant to
CCP § 1032 and 1033.5(8) the prevailing party is entitled as matter of
right to the opposing party’s costs of the suit and payment of expert fees is
up to the discretion of the Court. The Court finds that the estimated fees in
the amount of ____________________ are reasonable.
 
            Thus,
Defendant Sands’ Motion for Undertaking is GRANTED.
