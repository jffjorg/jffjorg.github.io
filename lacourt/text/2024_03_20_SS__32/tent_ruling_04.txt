the memorandum seeks to move for reconsideration under Code of Civil Procedure
section 1008, this was not included in the Notice of Motion. As a result, the

v. Greenwald¿(2003) 107 Cal.App.4th 1119, 1125 [“As a general rule, the
trial court may consider only the grounds stated in the notice of motion.”].)
