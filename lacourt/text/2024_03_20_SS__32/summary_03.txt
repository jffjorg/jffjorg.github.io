And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Plaintiff Ken Robinson's motion to set aside the order imposing $250 in monetary sanctions. The motion was filed on December 4, 2023, in response to the Court's order on September 20, 2023, imposing sanctions for Plaintiff's failure to serve defendant Lanika Beard within 60 days of filing the complaint. The Judge finds that the mistake made by Plaintiff's counsel was not excusable, and therefore, the motion is denied. The Judge notes that even if counsel had mistakenly believed that the answer filed by defendant Bright Path Center pertained to both defendants, counsel failed to show excusable neglect since there is no stated reason why counsel believed the answer pertained to both defendants. The Judge also finds that counsel's reliance on a prior judge's "practice" does not constitute excusable neglect. As a result, the Court denies the motion to set aside the order imposing monetary sanctions.
