And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the petition filed by Jesus Sanchez to approve a compromise of the pending action of his 12-year-old daughter, Jayleen Sanchez. The judge denies the petition without prejudice due to several issues. The petitioner must include medical records or a medical report to confirm that the minor is fully recovered. The petition must also state the terms of the settlement, select certain boxes and checkboxes, and include certain forms and attachments. Additionally, the petitioner's counsel declaration indicates that counsel is representing all plaintiffs, which conflicts with information provided in the petition. The judge orders the petitioner to complete and file the required forms and attachments and to give notice and file proof of service.
