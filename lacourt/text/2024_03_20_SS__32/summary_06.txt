And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Respondent's motion to quash Petitioner's subpoena seeking the deposition of Wendy Parton. The judge found that the subpoena is reasonably calculated to lead to discoverable evidence, and that the attorney-client privilege and work product doctrine do not protect all of the communications and documents sought. The judge noted that Petitioner seeks to depose Ms. Parton to discover the process by which discovery responses were prepared, and to discover facts to challenge claims of privilege. The judge declined to award monetary sanctions, as there was no evidence that the motion was made in bad faith.
