And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the moving, opposing, and reply papers in this case and has ruled as follows. The case is about a claim for damages filed by Yola Moreno against the City of Los Angeles. The City has moved for judgment on the pleadings, arguing that the claim is insufficient and that Moreno did not comply with the claim presentation requirement. Moreno argues that the City waived any insufficiency in the claim.

The judge has determined that the City waived its objection to any defect in Moreno's claim under Government Code section 911, which requires notice of insufficiency to be given within 20 days after submission of the claim. Since the City did not give notice of insufficiency until 27 days after submission of the claim, the judge concludes that the City waived its objection.

Therefore, the judge denies the City's motion for judgment on the pleadings. The judge orders the moving party to give notice of this ruling and to file proof of service of this ruling with the court within five days.
