BACKGROUND 
On

filed this action against Defendants Anargyros Lazaridis (“Defendant”) and
Does 1-50 for motor vehicle tort, general negligence, violation of Vehicle Code
section 20001, subdivision (a), and intentional infliction of emotional
distress. 
On
March 1, 2023, Plaintiff filed a proof of service showing personal service on
Defendant of the summons, complaint, statement of damages, and other documents
on February 24, 2023. 
On
April 17, 2023, Plaintiff filed a statement of damages which listed “general
damages” “in excess of” $1 million and “special damages” “in excess of” $1
million. 
Also
on April 17, 2023, the clerk entered Defendant’s default. 
On
January 19, 2024, the Court dismissed the Doe defendants without prejudice at
Plaintiff’s request. 
On
May 1, 2024, Plaintiff filed a request for Court judgment to be heard on June
11, 2024.  On June 11, 2024, the Court
issued an order and continued the hearing to August 30, 2024 to allow Plaintiff to file a declaration and evidence supporting
his damage claims.  The Court
subsequently continued the hearing to October 24, 2024. 
PARTY’S REQUEST 
Plaintiff
asks the Court to enter a default judgment against Defendant Anargyros
Lazaridis and award Plaintiff $73,307.94, consisting of $46,401.12 in special
damages, $25,000.00 in general damages, and $1,906.82 in costs. 

LEGAL STANDARD 
A.      Default judgment 
          California Rules of Court, rule
3.1800(a), provides: 
“[With exceptions that do not apply here,] [a] party
seeking a default judgment on declarations must use mandatory Request for Entry
of Default (Application to Enter Default) (form CIV-100) . . . The following
must be included in the documents filed with the clerk: 
“(1)  Except in
unlawful detainer cases, a brief summary of the case identifying the parties
and the nature of plaintiff's claim; 
“(2) 
Declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment
requested; 
“(3)  Interest
computations as necessary; 
“(4)  A
memorandum of costs and disbursements; 
“(5)  A
declaration of nonmilitary status for each defendant against whom judgment is
sought; 
“(6)  A proposed
form of judgment; 
“(7)  A dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not
sought or an application for separate judgment against specified parties under
Code of Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each
judgment; 
“(8)  Exhibits
as necessary; and 
“(9)  A request
for attorney fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.” 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1800(a).) 
B.       Damages 
 The relief granted to a plaintiff upon entry
of a defendant's default cannot exceed the amount demanded in the complaint or,
for personal injury cases where damages may not be stated in the complaint, the
amount listed in the statement of damages. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 580, subd. (a),
585, subd. (b).) “The notice requirement of section 580 was designed to insure
fundamental fairness.” (Becker v. S.P.V. Construction Co. (1980) 27
Cal.3d 489, 494.) The statute insures that “defendants in cases which involve a
default judgment have adequate notice of the judgments that may be taken
against them. [Citation.] ‘If a judgment other than that which is demanded is
taken against him, [the defendant] has been deprived of his day in court—a
right to a hearing on the matter adjudicated.’ ’’ (Id. at p. 493.) A
trial court exceeds its jurisdiction if it awards damages in excess of the
amount specified in the complaint or statement of damages. (Id. at p.
494.) 
DISCUSSION 
          Plaintiff has submitted a complete default judgment application with
all required information.  The Court
grants the application and awards Plaintiff $73,307.94. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court GRANTS the application for default judgment filed by Plaintiff Jacob Ali against
Defendant Anargyros Lazaridis on May 1,
2024.  The Court awards Plaintiff Jacob
Ali $73,307.94. 
Plaintiff
is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
