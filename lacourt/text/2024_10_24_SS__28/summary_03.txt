And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is in response to the West Covina Unified School District's motion for summary judgment and/or summary adjudication of issues. The District seeks to dismiss the Plaintiff's claims, while the Plaintiff seeks to deny the motion.

The judge denies the District's motion for summary adjudication of the Plaintiff's claims for negligence under Government Code sections 815.2 and 820, subdivision (a), as well as the claim for dangerous condition of public property. The judge also denies the motion for summary adjudication of the claim for negligent supervision.

The judge grants the District's motion for summary adjudication of the claim for negligent hiring, training, supervision, or retention, as the Plaintiff has agreed to dismiss this claim.

The judge notes that the District has not carried its initial burden on summary judgment on the Plaintiff's claims for negligence under Government Code sections 815.2 and 820, subdivision (a), and for dangerous condition of public property.

The judge also notes that the District has not presented evidence to support its claims that the Plaintiff's injuries were caused by a "waiver/release" or that the Plaintiff assumed the risk of injury. The judge concludes that the District has not carried its initial burden on summary judgment and/or summary adjudication of issues.
