and SPR Trucking. Plaintiff filed proofs of service showing service of the

and April 25, 2024. The amended statements of damages listed general damages of
$25,000.00 (consisting of $15,000.00 for pain, suffering, and inconvenience and

(consisting of $6,685.00 for past medical expenses and $68,315.00 for future

On May

On

On
August 22, 2024, Plaintiff filed an application for default judgment against
Maldonado and SPR Trucking. 
PARTY’S REQUEST 
Plaintiff’s CIV-100 form asks the Court to enter a
default judgment against Defendants Rafael Maldonado and SPR Trucking, Inc.,
and award Plaintiff $107,696.07. 

LEGAL STANDARD 
A.      Default judgment 
          California Rules of Court, rule
3.1800(a), provides: 
“[With exceptions that do not apply here,] [a] party
seeking a default judgment on declarations must use mandatory Request for Entry
of Default (Application to Enter Default) (form CIV-100) . . . The following
must be included in the documents filed with the clerk: 
“(1)  Except in
unlawful detainer cases, a brief summary of the case identifying the parties
and the nature of plaintiff's claim; 
“(2) 
Declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment
requested; 
“(3)  Interest
computations as necessary; 
“(4)  A
memorandum of costs and disbursements; 
“(5)  A
declaration of nonmilitary status for each defendant against whom judgment is
sought; 
“(6)  A proposed
form of judgment; 
“(7)  A dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not
sought or an application for separate judgment against specified parties under
Code of Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each
judgment; 
“(8)  Exhibits
as necessary; and 
“(9)  A request
for attorney fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.” 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1800(a).) 
B.       Damages 
 The relief granted to a plaintiff upon entry
of a defendant's default cannot exceed the amount demanded in the complaint or,
for personal injury cases where damages may not be stated in the complaint, the
amount listed in the statement of damages. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 580, subd. (a),
585, subd. (b).) “The notice requirement of section 580 was designed to insure
fundamental fairness.” (Becker v. S.P.V. Construction Co. (1980) 27
Cal.3d 489, 494.) The statute insures that “defendants in cases which involve a
default judgment have adequate notice of the judgments that may be taken
against them. [Citation.] ‘If a judgment other than that which is demanded is
taken against him, [the defendant] has been deprived of his day in court—a
right to a hearing on the matter adjudicated.’ ’’ (Id. at p. 493.) A
trial court exceeds its jurisdiction if it awards damages in excess of the
amount specified in the complaint or statement of damages. (Id. at p.
494.) 
DISCUSSION 
          Plaintiff’s CIV-100 and JUD-100 forms ask the Court to
enter a default judgment against Defendants Rafael Maldonado and SPR Trucking,
Inc., and award Plaintiff $107,696.07. 
However, Plaintiff’s supporting documentation supports an award of only
$101,011.07, consisting of $6,685.00 for past medical expenses, $68,315.00 for
future medical expenses, $25,000.00 in general damages, and $1,011.07 in costs.  The Court denies the application. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES without prejudice Plaintiff Navid Nourmand’s application for
default judgment against Defendants Rafael Maldonado and SPR Trucking, Inc.
filed on August 22, 2024. 
Plaintiff
is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
