```

And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling grants the defendant's motion to compel the plaintiff to respond to Form Interrogatories (Set One) and denies the request for sanctions. The plaintiff failed to respond to the discovery requests, and the defendant need show nothing more to grant the motion. The court notes that the statutes governing motions to compel initial responses to interrogatories do not provide an independent basis to award sanctions. The court also references a recent Court of Appeal opinion that states that sections 2023.010 and 2023.030 do not independently authorize the trial court to impose monetary sanctions for misuse of discovery.
