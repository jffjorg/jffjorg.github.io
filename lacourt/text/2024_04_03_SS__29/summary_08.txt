And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal of the case is granted. The plaintiff's counsel states that the mailed notice of the final status conference and trial dates were lost or mis-filed, leading to counsel's nonappearance at the trial date. The judge finds that the dismissal occurred due to counsel's mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect, and that the plaintiff has acted diligently in seeking relief. As a result, the judge grants the plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal. The plaintiff is ordered to serve the defendant within 30 days, and a hearing is scheduled for June 3, 2024, to consider the proof of service.
