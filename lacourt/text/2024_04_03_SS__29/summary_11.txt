And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court grants the petition to approve the compromise of Jesse Contreras, an adult with a disability, with one modification to the proposed order. The settlement amount of $500,000 is fair and reasonable, as are the requested attorney's fees of 25%. The proposed trust instrument meets all applicable requirements. However, the court cannot approve the amended petition at this time due to issues relating to the creation of the special needs trust (SNT). The proposed trust instrument is approved, and the court strikes language related to the effect of the SNT on claimant's eligibility for benefits. The court sets the OSC in approximately 70 days.
