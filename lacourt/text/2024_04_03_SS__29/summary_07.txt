And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting Defendant Hooman Madyoon M.D.'s motion for summary judgment. The motion was filed on January 11, 2024, and no opposition was filed. The case involves a medical negligence claim brought by Plaintiff Randy Morales against the Defendant and others. The Plaintiff alleges that the Defendant committed professional medical negligence during the treatment of the Plaintiff's right great saphens venous insufficiency. The Defendant claims that its care and treatment of the Plaintiff complied with the standard of care and did not cause any harm or injury to the Plaintiff. The Defendant presented expert testimony from Patricia E. Horpe, M.D., who opined that the Defendant's care and treatment complied with the standard of care and did not cause the Plaintiff's alleged injuries. The Judge found that the Defendant has satisfied the initial burden of showing that one or more elements of the professional negligence cause of action in the complaint cannot be established, and therefore granted the motion for summary judgment. The Plaintiff has not filed an opposition or other evidence making this showing.
