And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has reviewed the motion for a good faith settlement determination filed by Defendant Luis Rodriguez. This is the third attempt by Defendant Rodriguez to obtain a determination, and the court recognizes that the prior attempts failed due to lack of proof. This time, Defendant Rodriguez has provided additional information, including that Plaintiff Smith has not received treatment since approximately 2019 and that the total medical special damages are in the range of $15,000. The court finds this new information significant and is considering it in its analysis of the Tech-Bilt factors. The court also notes that Defendant Diaz has requested a continuance to conduct additional discovery, and the court would like to hear from counsel regarding the need for this discovery, why it was not propounded earlier, and the length of time requested for the continuance.
