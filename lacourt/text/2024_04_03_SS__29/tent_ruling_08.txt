 Case Number:  21STCV44737    Hearing Date:   April 3, 2024    Dept:  29 Motion to Set Aside Dismissal filed by Plaintiff  Rosalinda M. Lopez.   Tentative The motion is granted. Background On December 6, 2021, Rosalinda M. Lopez  (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Manual Gonzalez (“Defendant”) asserting  motor vehicle negligence and general negligence causes of action arising out of  an automobile accident occurring on December 31, 2019. On June 7, 2023, no one appeared on the date  of trial, and the case was dismissed without prejudice. On December 6, 2023, Plaintiff  filed this motion to set aside the dismissal. No opposition has been filed. Legal Standard “The court may, upon any terms as may be  just, relieve a party or his or her legal representative from a judgment,  dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against him or her through his or  her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. Application for this  relief shall be accompanied by a copy of the answer or other pleading proposed  to be filed therein, otherwise the application shall not be granted, and shall  be made within a reasonable time, in no case exceeding six months, after the judgment,  dismissal, order, or proceeding was taken…” (Code Civ. Pro., §473, subd. (b).)  To qualify for relief under section 473,  the moving party must act diligently in seeking relief and must submit  affidavits or testimony demonstrating a reasonable cause for the  default. (Elston v. City of Turlock (1985) 38 Cal.3d 227, 234.)  “In a motion under section 473 the initial  burden is on the moving party to prove excusable neglect by a “preponderance of  the evidence. [Citations]”” (Kendall v. Barker (1988) 197 Cal.App.3d  619, 624.) “The moving party has a double burden: He must show a satisfactory  excuse for his default, and he must show diligence in making the motion after  discovery of the default.” (Id. at 625.) Discussion Plaintiff’s counsel  Michael T. Martin states that the mailed notice of the final status conference  and trial dates were lost or mis-filed and led to counsel’s nonappearance. (Martin  Decl., ¶¶ 3, 4.) This motion was filed within 6 months of the dismissal.  Counsel further attests that Plaintiff has a current address for Defendant and  can serve him as soon as the case is returned to an active calendar. (Id.,  ¶ 9.)   No opposition  has been filed.   The Court finds  Plaintiff has established the dismissal occurred due to counsel’s mistake,  inadvertence, surprise or neglect due to the noncalendaring of the June 7, 2023  trial date causing counsel’s nonappearance and subsequent dismissal.   Therefore, Plaintiff’s motion to set aside the dismissal is  GRANTED.      Conclusion   Plaintiff’s motion to set aside the dismissal is GRANTED.   Plaintiff is ordered to serve Defendant within 30 days.   The Court sets an OSC re dismissal for failure to file proof  of service in approximately 60 days.  Any  response to the OSC must be by written declaration filed at least five calendar  days before the hearing.   The Court sets a TSC at the same date and time.Order to Show Cause Re: Dismissal for Failure to File Proof of Service is scheduled for   06/03/2024 at 08:30 AM in Department 29 at Spring Street Courthouse. Trial Setting Conference is scheduled for 06/03/2024 at 08:30 AM in Department 29 at Spring   Street Courthouse.   Plaintiff is ordered to give notice.
