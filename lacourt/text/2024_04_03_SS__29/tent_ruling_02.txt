 Case Number:  20STCV15518    Hearing Date:   April 3, 2024    Dept:  29 Defendant’s Motion to Compel Plaintiff to Respond to Form
Interrogatories (Set One)
Defendant’s Motion to Compel Plaintiff to Respond to Special Interrogatories (Set
One)
 
Tentative
The motions to compel are denied without
prejudice.
Background
This action arises from an automobile
accident that occurred on April 25, 2018, involving Plaintiff Brad Bello
(“Plaintiff”) and Defendant Francisco Jose Maisch (“Defendant”).  Plaintiff filed the complaint in this action
on April 23, 2020 against Defendant and Does 1 through 30, asserting one cause
of action for motor vehicle negligence. 
Defendant filed his answer on November 19, 2021.
 
On January 14, 2022, Defendant served
Plaintiff with discovery, including Form Interrogatories (Set One) and Special Interrogatories
(Set One).  (Mittskus Decls., ¶ 2 &
Exhs. A.)  Plaintiff did not
respond.  (Id., ¶ 6.)
 
On April 28, 2023, the Court granted
the motion of Plaintiff’s counsel to be relieved.  The proof of service of the order was filed
on May 4, 2023.
 
On May 9, 2023, Defendant filed these
two motions to compel initial responses. 
The motions were served by electronic transmission.  No opposition has been filed.
 
Legal Standard
 
A party must respond to interrogatories within 30 days
after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom
interrogatories are directed does not provide a timely response, the
propounding party may move for an order compelling response to the
interrogatories. (Id., § 2030.290, subd. (b).) There is no time limit
for a motion to compel initial responses, and no meet and confer efforts are
required. (See id., § 2030.290; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc.
v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor
must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who fails to provide a
timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).) 
When a party moves to compel initial responses to
interrogatories, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the motion], unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd.
(c).)
In Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery
Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision (d), defines
“[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to respond to or to
submit to an authorized method of discovery.” 
Where a party or attorney has engaged in misuse of the discovery
process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in the amount of “the reasonable
expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that
conduct.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2023.020, subd. (a).)
Discussion
On January 14, 2022, Defendant served
Form Interrogatories and Special Interrogatories on Plaintiff. (Mittskus
Decls., ¶ 2 & Exhs. A.)  Plaintiff
has not responded. (Id., ¶ 6.)
 
Defendant
is entitled to responses.  For this
motion, however, Defendant served the Plaintiff, who is representing himself in
pro per, electronically. Although electronic service may be mandatory for
represented parties, litigants who are in pro per are not subject to mandatory
email service, and Defendant has presented no evidence that Plaintiff has
consented to email service. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 1010.6, subd. (c)(2); Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 2.251(c)(3)(B).) Notice
of these motions were not properly served on Plaintiff.
 
Therefore,
the motions to compel are DENIED without prejudice.
 
Conclusion
 
The Court DENIES the motions to compel without
prejudice.
 
Moving party
is ORDERED to give notice.
