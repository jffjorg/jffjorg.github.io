  Case Number:  20STCV09528    Hearing Date:   April 3, 2024    Dept:  29 Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings filed by Defendant City
of Compton.
 
Tentative
The motion is denied.
Background
On March 6, 2020, Arturio Denise Halloway (“Plaintiff”)
filed a complaint against City of Compton (“Defendant”) and Does 1 through 100
for damages arising from a trip and fall on October 1, 2018.
 
Defendant filed its answer on May 25, 2021.
 
On February 22, 2024, Defendant filed a motion for
judgment on the pleadings. Plaintiff filed an opposition on March 18, 2024.
Defendant filed a reply on March 26, 2024.
 
Legal Standard
A defendant may move for judgment
on the pleadings when the “complaint does not state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action against that defendant.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §438,
subds. (b)(1) & (c)(1)(B)(ii).) 
 
“A motion for judgment on the
pleadings may be made at any time either prior to the trial or at the trial
itself.”  (Ion Equipment Corp. v. Nelson (1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 868,
877.)  “A motion for judgment on the pleadings performs the same function
as a general demurrer, and hence attacks only defects disclosed on the face of
the pleadings or by matters that can be judicially noticed. Presentation of
extrinsic evidence is therefore not proper on a motion for judgment on the
pleadings.”  (Cloud v. Northrop Grumman Corp. (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th
995, 999.)  The standard for ruling on a motion for judgment on the
pleadings is essentially the same as that applicable to a general demurrer,
that is, whether the pleading states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of
action, considering only the matters appearing on the face of the pleading plus
matters subject to judicial notice..  (Bezirdjian v. O'Reilly
(2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 316, 321-322 (citing Schabarum v. California
Legislature (1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 1205, 1216).)   
 
Meet and Confer
Requirement
 
The Court finds that the meet and
confer requirement of Code of Civil Procedure section 439 has been
satisfied.  (Westmoreland Decl., ¶ 3;
Reply, at 2:16-23.)
 
Discussion
Plaintiff presented a claim to Defendant for damages, alleging that she
tripped and fell on an uneven sidewalk near the corner of Poinsettia and Myrrh
in Compton. (Complaint, Exh. A.) Defendant rejected the claim. (Id., Exh. B.)
Plaintiff then filed her complaint, alleging (among other things) that the
sidewalk was in a dangerous condition; that Defendant knew or should have known
that the sidewalk was in a dangerous condition; that Plaintiff tripped and fell
on the dangerous condition of the sidewalk, causing injury to her.  (Id., ¶¶
8-11.) 
That is sufficient to state a cause of action against Defendant for a
dangerous condition of public property under Government Code section 835.  (See, e.g., Tansavatdi
v. City of Rancho Palos Verdes (2023) 14
Cal.5th 639, 653.)
Defendant
claims that the complaint is nonetheless defective because there is no label of
the cause of action as required by California Rules of Court, rule 2.112, and therefore the complaint is
uncertain. (Motion, at pp. 5-6.)  But
demurrers for uncertainty are disfavored and will be sustained only where a complaint
is so unclear that the defendant cannot reasonably determine what causes of
action are being asserted against it. 
(See A.J. Fistes Corp. v. GDL Best Contractors, Inc. (2019) 38 Cal.App.5th 677,
695.)  Here, there is no doubt that
Plaintiff is asserting a claim under Government Code section 835, and, indeed,
it is clear from Defendant’s answer that Defendant understood that Plaintiff is
asserting such a claim. (See Answer.)  
Notwithstanding the technical deficiency of the complaint under Rule
2.112, the complaint states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action
under Government Code section 835, puts Defendant on notice of the cause of
action asserted against it, and is not uncertain.  The motion is denied.
Conclusion
The Court DENIES
Defendant’s motion for judgment on the pleadings.
Moving Party is
ORDERED to give notice.
