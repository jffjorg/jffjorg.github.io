And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling states that the motion for judgment on the pleadings filed by the Defendant, City of Compton, is denied. The motion was filed in response to a complaint filed by the Plaintiff, Arturio Denise Halloway, alleging a trip and fall on an uneven sidewalk in Compton on October 1, 2018. The Plaintiff claims that the sidewalk was in a dangerous condition and that the Defendant knew or should have known about the condition. The Defendant rejected the claim, and the Plaintiff filed a complaint alleging a dangerous condition of public property under Government Code section 835. The Defendant claims that the complaint is defective because it does not label the cause of action as required by California Rules of Court, rule 2.112. However, the Court finds that the complaint states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action under Government Code section 835 and is not uncertain. The motion is denied.
