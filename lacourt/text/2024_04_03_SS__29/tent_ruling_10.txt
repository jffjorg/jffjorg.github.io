 Case Number:  22STCV14690    Hearing Date:   April 3, 2024    Dept:  29 Defendant’s motion to compel Plaintiff to
respond to Form Interrogatories (Set One)
 
Tentative
 
The motion is granted.
The request for sanctions is denied.
Background 
On May 3, 2022, Plaintiff Estefania Bates
(“Plaintiff”) filed the complaint in this action against Defendants Joshua A.
Ghiam, DDS (“Defendant”) and Does 1 through 30, asserting a single cause of
action for dental malpractice.  On November
2, 2023, Defendant filed an answer to the complaint.
On November 9, 2023, Defendant served
Plaintiff with discovery, including Form Interrogatories (Set One).  (Ahdoot Decl., ¶ 4 & Exh. A.)  Plaintiff did not respond.  (Id., ¶ 6.)
On February 13, 2024, Defendant filed this
motion to compel.  Defendant also seeks
sanctions.  No opposition has been filed.

Legal Standard 
A party must respond to interrogatories within 30 days
after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom
interrogatories are directed does not provide a timely response, the propounding
party may move for an order compelling response to the interrogatories. (Id.,
§ 2030.290, subd. (b).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial
responses, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2030.290;
Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants
(2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In
addition, a party who fails to provide a timely response generally waives all
objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290, subd. (a).) 
When a party moves to compel initial responses to
interrogatories, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the motion], unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd.
(c).)
In
Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.030 provides
that the court may impose sanctions “[t]o the extent authorized by the chapter
governing any particular discovery method or any other provision of this title.”  Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010,
subdivision (d), defines “[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include
“[f]ailing to respond to or to submit to an authorized method of
discovery.”  Where a party or attorney
has engaged in misuse of the discovery process, the court may impose a monetary
sanction in the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees,
incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.020, subd.
(a).)
Discussion
Defendant served Plaintiff with Form
Interrogatories (Set One) on November 9, 2023. 
(Ahdoot Decl., ¶ 4 & Exh. A.) 
Plaintiff did not respond.  (Id.,
¶ 6.)
Defendant need show nothing more.  His motions to compel are GRANTED.
Defendant’s requests for sanctions are DENIED.  Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030 does
not provide an independent basis to award sanctions; to the contrary, the
statute expressly states that a sanctions award must be “authorized by the
chapter governing any particular discovery method or any other provision of
this title.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030.)  The statutes governing motions to compel
initial responses to interrogatories authorizes an award of sanctions “against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes” the motion to compel.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (c).)  Here, Plaintiff did not file any opposition,
and so there is no authority under the Civil Discovery Act to award sanctions
against Plaintiff or Plaintiff’s counsel.
The
Court of Appeal, in an opinion by Justice Moor, recently made this very point
in City of Los Angeles v. PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLC (2022) 84
Cal.App.5th 466, 504 (“sections 2023.010 and 2023.030 do not independently
authorize the trial court to impose monetary sanctions for misuse of discovery
… without regard to any other provision of the Discovery Act”).  The Court is aware that the California
Supreme Court has granted review of the City of Los Angeles case, but the Court
notes that the order granting review, filed on January 25, 2023, states that
pending review, the appellate opinion “may be cited,” including “for its
persuasive value.”  The Court finds the
reasoning of Justice Moor to be persuasive. 
Conclusion 
The Court GRANTS Defendant’s motion to
compel.
The Court ORDERS Plaintiff to provide
verified, code-compliant, written responses, without objection, to Defendant’s Form
Interrogatories (Set One) within 21 days of notice.
The Court DENIES Defendant’s request for
monetary sanctions. 
Moving party is ordered to give notice.
