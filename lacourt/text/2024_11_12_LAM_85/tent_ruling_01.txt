Daniel H. Lawrie, Christen Lawrie, 24STCV13312


Tentative decision on applications
for right to attach orders: granted




 
 



Plaintiff Bouquet Plaza SDS, LLC (“Bouquet Plaza” or
“Landlord”) apply for right to attach orders against Defendants LA Kids Couture
Inc. (“LA Kids”), 4’s A Charm LLC (“Charm”), Janell Costello (“Costello”),
Daniel H. Lawrie (“Daniel”), and Christen Lawrie (“Christen”) in the amount of
$242,158.08.
The court has read and considered the moving papers (no
opposition was filed) and renders the following tentative decision. 
 
A. Statement of
the Case
1. Complaint 
Landlord filed the Complaint against Defendants LA Kids,
Charm, Costello, Daniel, and Christen on May 29, 2024 alleging claims for
breach of lease and breach of guaranty. 
The Complaint alleges in pertinent part as follows.  
a. The Lease
On or about February 14, 2017, Plaintiff Bouquet Plaza, as
landlord, and LA Kids, as tenant, entered into a written Standard
Industrial/Commercial Multi-Tenant Lease - Net (the “Lease”) (a) for an initial
term of six years and five months, (b) for real property located at 26063
Bouquet Canyon Road, Santa Clarita, CA 91350, in an approximately 3,100 square
foot retail space in a shopping center (the “Premises”).  
In connection with the execution of the Lease, to induce
Landlord to enter into the Lease, on or about March 7, 2017, Defendant Costello
executed a written Guaranty of Lease (the “First Guaranty"), whereby Costello
agreed to guarantee Tenant’s prompt payment of all sums payable by Tenant and
the full performance of Tenant’s obligations under the Lease.  
As more fully set forth in the Lease, Tenant is required to
pay rent under the Lease every month.  The
Lease, at Section 1.5 provides, “Base Rent: $5,735.00 per month (‘Base Rent’),
payable on the 1st day of each month commencing Sept. 1, 2017…”.  Pursuant to Section 50 of the Addendum the
monthly Base Rent was increased to $6,647.68 for Months 54-65, and increased to
$6,665.83 for Months 66-77.  
On or about May 7, 2019, LA Kids, as assignor, and Charm, as
assignee, entered into the Assignment of Lease with Consent of Landlord (the
“Assignment”), whereby the Lease was assigned from LA Kids to A Charm. 
In connection with the execution of the Assignment, in order
to induce Landlord to enter into the Assignment, on or about May 7, 2019,
Defendant Christen agreed to guarantee Tenant’s prompt payment of all sums
payable by Tenant and the full performance of Tenant’s obligations under the
Lease. 
 
b. Default 
As of March 2024, Tenant has failed to pay the Base Rent for
the months of December 2021 to August 2023 in the amount of $119,854.34.  
On or about September 18, 2024, Landlord served on Tenant a demand
for payment of rent pursuant to the Lease. 
On or about March 22, 2024, Landlord’s counsel served on
Tenant a second demand for payment of rent.  
Notwithstanding the requirements of the Lease, and despite
written demand, Tenant failed to deliver the Rent to Plaintiff and continues to
fail to pay all of the Rent due thereafter. 

 
2. Course of Proceedings
On June 28, 2024, Defendants Charm, Daniel, and Christen
answered the Complaint.  
On July 9, 2024, Defendants LA Kids and Costello answered
the Complaint.  On July 12, 2024 they
filed a Cross-Complaint against Cross-Defendants Charm, Daniel, and Christen.
On August 20, 2024, Defendants Charm, Daniel, and Christen
answered the Cross-Complaint.  
Proof of service on file show that defense counsel were
electronically served with the instant applications on October 4, 2024.
 
B. Applicable Law
1. Attachment
Attachment is a
prejudgment remedy providing for the seizure of one or more of the defendant’s
assets to aid in the collection of a money demand pending the outcome of the
trial of the action.  See Whitehouse
v. Six Corporation, (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 527, 533.  In 1972, and in a 1977 comprehensive
revision, the Legislature enacted attachment legislation (CCP §481.010 et seq.)
that meets the due process requirements set forth in Randone v. Appellate
Department, (1971) 5 Cal.3d 536.  See
Western Steel & Ship Repair v. RMI, (12986) 176 Cal.App.3d 1108,
1115.  As the attachment statutes are
purely the creation of the Legislature, they are strictly construed.  Vershbow v. Reiner, (1991) 231
Cal.App.3d 879, 882.
A writ of attachment
may be issued only in an action on a claim or claims for money, each of which
is based upon a contract, express or implied, where the total amount of the
claim or claims is a fixed or readily ascertainable amount not less than five hundred
dollars ($500).  CCP §483.010(a).  A claim is “readily ascertainable” where the
amount due may be clearly ascertained from the contract and calculated by
evidence; the fact that damages are unliquidated is not determinative.  CIT Group/Equipment Financing, Inc. v.
Super DVD, Inc., (“CIT”) (2004) 115 Cal.App.4th 537, 540-41
(attachment appropriate for claim based on rent calculation for lease of
commercial equipment).
All property within
California of a corporation, association, or partnership is subject to
attachment if there is a method of levy for the property.  CCP §487.010(a), (b).  While a trustee is a natural person, a trust
is not.  Therefore, a trust’s property is
subject to attachment on the same basis as a corporation or partnership.  Kadison, Pfaelzer, Woodard, Quinn &
Rossi v. Wilson, supra, 197 Cal.App.3d at 4.
The plaintiff may
apply for a right to attach order by noticing a hearing for the order and
serving the defendant with summons and complaint, notice of the application,
and supporting papers any time after filing the complaint.  CCP §484.010. 
Notice of the application must be given pursuant to CCP section 1005,
sixteen court days before the hearing.  See
ibid.
The notice of the
application and the application may be made on Judicial Council forms (Optional
Forms AT-105, 115).  The application must
be supported by an affidavit showing that the plaintiff on the facts presented
would be entitled to a judgment on the claim upon which the attachment is
based.  CCP §484.030.  
Where the defendant
is a corporation, a general reference to “all corporate property which is
subject to attachment pursuant to subdivision (a) of Code of Civil Procedure
Section 487.010” is sufficient.  CCP
§484.020(e).  Where the defendant is a
partnership or other unincorporated association, a reference to “all property
of the partnership or other unincorporated association which is subject to
attachment pursuant to subdivision (b) of Code of Civil Procedure Section 487.010”
is sufficient.  CCP §484.020(e).  A specific description of property is not
required for corporations and partnerships as they generally have no exempt
property.  Bank of America v. Salinas
Nissan, Inc., (“Bank of America”) (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 260, 268.
A defendant who
opposes issuance of the order must file and serve a notice of opposition and
supporting affidavit as required by CCP section 484.060 not later than five
court days prior to the date set for hearing. 
CCP §484.050(e).  The notice of
opposition may be made on a Judicial Council form (Optional Form AT-155).  
The plaintiff may
file and serve a reply two court days prior to the date set for the
hearing.  CCP §484.060(c). 
At the hearing, the
court determines whether the plaintiff should receive a right to attach order
and whether any property which the plaintiff seeks to attach is exempt from
attachment.  The defendant may appear the
hearing.  CCP §484.050(h).  The court generally will evaluate the
attachment application based solely on the pleadings and supporting affidavits
without taking additional evidence.  Bank
of America, supra, 207 Cal.App.3d at 273.  A verified complaint may be used in lieu of
or in addition to an affidavit if it states evidentiary facts.  CCP §482.040. 
The plaintiff has the burden of proof, and the court is not required to
accept as true any affidavit even if it is undisputed.  See Bank of America, supra, at
271, 273.
The court may issue
a right to attach order (Optional Form AT-120) if the plaintiff shows all of
the following: (1) the claim on which the attachment is based is one on which
an attachment may be issued (CCP §484.090(a)(1)); (2) the plaintiff has established
the probable validity of the claim (CCP §484.090(a)(2)); (3) attachment is
sought for no purpose other than the recovery on the subject claim (CCP
§484.090(a)(3); and (4) the amount to be secured by the attachment is greater
than zero (CCP §484.090(a)(4)). 
A claim has
“probable validity” where it is more likely than not that the plaintiff will
recover on that claim.  CCP §481.190.  In determining this issue, the court must
consider the relative merits of the positions of the respective parties.  Kemp Bros. Construction, Inc. v. Titan
Electric Corp., (2007) 146 Cal.App.4th 1474, 1484.  The court does not determine whether the
claim is actually valid; that determination will be made at trial and is not
affected by the decision on the application for the order.  CCP §484.050(b).
Except in unlawful
detainer actions, the amount to be secured by the attachment is the sum of (1)
the amount of the defendant’s indebtedness claimed by the plaintiff, and (2)
any additional amount included by the court for estimate of costs and any allowable
attorneys’ fees under CCP section 482.110. 
CCP §483.015(a); Goldstein v. Barak Construction, (2008) 164
Cal.App.4th 845, 852.  This amount must
be reduced by the sum of (1) the amount of indebtedness that the defendant has
in a money judgment against plaintiff, (2) the amount claimed in a
cross-complaint or affirmative defense and shown would be subject to attachment
against the plaintiff, and (3) the value of any security interest held by the
plaintiff in the defendant’s property, together with the amount by which the
acts of the plaintiff (or a prior holder of the security interest) have
decreased that security interest’s value. 
CCP §483.015(b); see also CCP §483.010(b) (“an attachment may not be
issued on a claim which is secured by any interest in real property arising
from agreement, statute, or other rule of law…However, an attachment may be
issued where the claim was originally so secured but, without any act of the
plaintiff or the person to whom the security was given, the security has become
valueless or has decreased in value to less than the amount then owing on the
claim).  A defendant claiming that the
amount to be secured should be reduced because of a cross-claim or affirmative
defense must make a prima facie showing that the claim would result in an
attachment against the plaintiff.
Before the issuance
of a writ of attachment, the plaintiff is required to file an undertaking to
pay the defendant any amount the defendant may recover for any wrongful
attachment by the plaintiff in the action. 
CCP §489.210.  The undertaking
ordinarily is $10,000. CCP §489.220.  If
the defendant objects, the court may increase the amount of undertaking to the
amount determined as the probable recovery for wrongful attachment.  CCP §489.220. 
The court also has inherent authority to increase the amount of the
undertaking sua sponte.  North
Hollywood Marble Co. v. Superior Court, (1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 683, 691.

Lease, Tenant is required to pay rent under the Lease every month.  Goodman Decl., ¶7.  Specifically, pursuant to Section 4.3, the
“Lessee shall cause payment of Rent to be received by Lessor in lawful money of
the United States, without offset or deduction.”  Goodman Decl., ¶7; Goodman Decl., Ex. A.  Section 1.5 provides: “Base Rent: $5,735.00
per month, payable on the 1st day of each month commencing Sept. 1, 2017…”  Goodman Decl., ¶8; Goodman Decl., Ex. A.  Section 50 of the Addendum increased the
monthly Base Rent to $6,647.68 for Months 54-65, and thereafter increased to
$6,665.83 for Months 66-77.  Goodman
Decl., ¶9.  
As of March 2024,
Tenant has failed to pay the Base Rent for the months of January 2022 to August
2023 in the total amount of $89,419.69. 
Goodman Decl., ¶10.  
            The Lease at Section 4.2
states that “Lessee shall pay to Lessor during the term hereof, in addition to
the Base Rent, Lessee's Share of all Common Area Operating Expense…”  Goodman Decl., ¶11.  The Tenant has failed to pay the Common Area
Operating Expenses for charges for the months of January 2022 to August 2023 in
the total amount of $30,434.66.  Goodman
Decl., ¶12.  
            Pursuant to Paragraph 4
of the Lease, “[a]ll monetary obligations of Lessee to Lessor under the terms
of this Lease (except for the Security Deposit) are deemed to be rent (“Rent”).”  Goodman Decl., ¶13, Ex. A.  
Tenant has been
delinquent on Rent payments since December 2021.  Goodman Decl., ¶14.  For the months of December 2021 to August
2023, Tenant owes unpaid Rent in the amount of $119,854.24.  Goodman Decl., ¶15.  
            On or about September

pay Rent for the months of December 2021 to August 2023 in the aggregate amount
of $119,854.34 and that, if Tenant did not pay the amount due within ten
business days, Tenant would be in default on the Lease, and Landlord would be
entitled to proceed against Tenant for all unpaid Rent, late fees, and
attorneys’ fees and costs incurred.  Goodman
Decl., ¶16, Ex. E.  
            On or about March 22,
2024, Landlord’s counsel served on Tenant the second demand notice pursuant to
the Lease.  Goodman Decl., ¶17.  The notice advised that Tenant had failed to  pay Rent for the months of January 2022 to
August 2023 in the aggregate amount of $119,854.34 and that if Tenant did not
pay the amount due within ten business days, Tenant would be in default of the
Lease and Landlord would be entitled to proceed against Tenant for all unpaid Rent,
late fees, and attorneys’ fees and costs incurred.  Goodman Decl., ¶17, Ex. F.  
            Notwithstanding the
written demands, Tenant failed to deliver, and continues to fail to pay, the
Rent due.  Goodman Decl., ¶18.  
 
            5. Late Charges
            Section 13.4 of the
Lease states: 
            
“Lessee hereby acknowledges that late payment by Lessee of Rent will
cause Lessor to incur costs not contemplated by this Lease, the exact amount of
which will be extremely difficult to ascertain. Such costs include, but are not
limited to, processing and accounting charges, and late charges which may be
imposed upon Lessor by any Lender. Accordingly, if any Rent shall not be
received by Lessor within 5 days after such amount shall be due, then, without
any requirement for notice to Lessee, Lessee shall immediately pay to Lessor a
one-time late charge equal to 10% of each such overdue amount or $100,
whichever is greater. The parties hereby agree that such late charge represents
a fair and reasonable estimate of the costs Lessor will incur by reason of such
late payment. Acceptance of such late charge by Lessor shall in no event
constitute a waiver of Lessee's Default or Breach with respect to such overdue
amount, nor prevent the exercise of any of the other rights and remedies
granted hereunder. In the event that a late charge is payable hereunder,
whether or not collected, for 3 consecutive installments of Base Rent, then
notwithstanding any provision of this Lease to the contrary, Base Rent shall,
at Lessor's option, become due and payable quarterly in advance.”  Goodman Decl., ¶19, Ex. A.  
 
As Tenant failed to
remit Rent from December 2021 to August 2023, Tenant has been assessed late
charges in the total amount $22,303.74. 
Goodman Decl., ¶20.  
 
6. Attorney’s Fees

            Section 31 of the Lease
states: 
 
“If any Party or Broker brings an action or proceeding involving the
Premises whether founded in tort, contract or equity, or to declare rights
hereunder, the Prevailing Party (as hereafter defined) in any such proceeding,
action, or appeal thereon, shall be entitled to reasonable attorneys' fees.
Such fees may be awarded in the same suit or recovered in a separate suit,
whether or not such action or proceeding is pursued to decision or judgment.
The term, "Prevailing Party" shall include, without limitation, a
Party or Broker who substantially obtains or defeats the relief sought, as the
case may be, whether by compromise, settlement, judgment, or the abandonment by
the other Party or Broker of its claim or defense. The attorneys' fees award
shall not be computed in accordance with any court fee schedule but shall be
such as to fully reimburse all attorneys' fees reasonably incurred. In
addition, Lessor shall be entitled to attorneys' fees, costs and expenses
incurred in the preparation and service of notices of Default and consultations
in connection therewith, whether or not a legal action is subsequently
commenced in connection with such Default or resulting Breach ($200 is a
reasonable minimum per occurrence for such services and consultation).”  Goodman Decl., ¶21, Ex. A.  
 
Landlord’s law firm charges competitive rates at $450 per hour for
partners, $225-400 per hour for associates, and $95 per hour for
paralegals.  Shakouri Decl., ¶4.  Landlord’s attorney estimates attorney fees
in this case of $90,000 and costs of $10,000, which includes filing fees, fees
for the writ of attachment, and costs to serve Defendants.  Shakouri Decl., ¶5.
 
D. Analysis
Plaintiff
Landlord seeks right to attach orders against Defendants LA KIDS, Charm, Daniel, Christen,
and Costello in the amount of $242,158.08,
which consists of $119,854.34 in Rent, $22,303.74
in late charges, $10,000 in estimated costs, and $90,000 in estimated
attorney fees.  
1. A Claim Based on a Contract and on Which Attachment
May Be Based 
            A writ of attachment may be issued
only in an action on a claim or claims for money, each of which is based upon a
contract, express or implied, where the total amount of the claim or claims is
a fixed or readily ascertainable amount not less than five hundred dollars
($500).  CCP §483.010(a).  
            Plaintiff Landlord’s claim is a
claim for money based upon a debt arising out of express contract in the Lease
and Guaranties and it exceeds $500.
             
            2. An Amount Due That is Fixed
and Readily Ascertainable  
            A claim is “readily ascertainable”
where the damages may be readily ascertained by reference to the contract and
the basis of the calculation appears to be reasonable and definite.  CIT
Group/Equipment Financing, Inc. v. Super DVD, Inc., (“CIT”) (2004)
115 Cal.App.4th 537, 540-41.  The fact that the damages are unliquidated
is not determinative.  Id.  But the contract must furnish a
standard by which the amount may be ascertained and there must be a basis by
which the damages can be determined by proof.  Id. (citations
omitted). 
The amount sought for attachment is $242,158.08, which consists of $119,854.34 in Rent, $22,303.74 in late
charges, $10,000 in estimated costs, and $90,000 in estimated attorney
fees.  The Rent and late charges are
calculated in a September 18, 2023 demand notice with an Open Receivables
attachment and a 2023 Operating Expense Reconciliation.  The estimated attorney fees and costs are
supported by attorney declaration.  The $242,158.08 sought is fixed and readily
ascertainable from the Lease.
            3. Probability of Success 
            A claim has “probable validity”
where it is more likely than not that the plaintiff will recover on that
claim.  CCP §481.190.  In determining this issue, the court must
consider the relative merits of the positions of the respective parties.  Kemp
Bros. Construction, Inc. v. Titan Electric Corp., (2007) 146 Cal.App.4th
1474, 1484.  The court does not determine whether the claim is actually
valid; that determination will be made at trial and is not affected by the
decision on the application for the order.  CCP §484.050(b).
On or about February
14, 2017, Plaintiff Bouquet Plaza, as landlord, and LA KIDS, as tenant, entered
into the Lease.  Goodman Decl., ¶2, Ex.
A.  On or about May 7, 2019, LA Kids,
assignor, and Charm, as assignee, entered into the Assignment of Lease with
Consent of Landlord, whereby the Lease was assigned from LA Kids to Charm.  Goodman Decl., ¶3, Ex. B.  
On or about March 7,
2017, Defendant Costello executed a guaranty of Tenant’s prompt payment under
the Lease.  Goodman Decl., ¶4, Ex.
C.  On or about May 7, 2019, Defendants
Daniel and Christen executed guaranties whereby they agreed to guarantee the
Tenant’s prompt payment of all sums payable by Tenant under the Lease.  Goodman Decl., ¶¶ 5-6; Ex. D. 
            As set forth in the
Lease, Tenant is required to pay rent under the Lease every month.  Goodman Decl., ¶7.  Tenant has been delinquent on Rent payments
since December 2021.  Goodman Decl.,
¶14.  For the months of December 2021 to
August 2023, Tenant owes unpaid Rent in the amount of $119,854.24.  Goodman Decl., ¶15.  
            Notwithstanding the
written demands, Tenant failed to deliver, and continues to fail to pay, the
Rent due.  Goodman Decl., ¶18.  As Tenant failed to remit Rent from December
2021 to August 2023, Tenant has been assessed late charges in the total amount
$22,303.74.  Goodman Decl., ¶20.
            Defendants provide no
opposition to this evidence and Landlord has shown a probability of success.
            
4. Attachment Sought for a Proper Purpose¿ 
            Attachment must not be sought for a
purpose other than the recovery on the claim upon which attachment is based.¿
CCP §484.090(a)(3).  Landlord seeks only
to attach Rent, late charges, and attorney fees and costs that will be due and
seeks attachment for  a proper purpose.
 
5. Attachment Is
Based on a Commercial Claim
If the action is against a defendant who is a natural
person, an attachment may be issued only on a commercial claim which arises out
of the defendant’s conduct of a trade, business, or profession.  CCP §483.010(c).  Consumer transactions cannot form a basis for
attachment.   CCP §483.010(c); Kadison,
Pfaelzer, Woodard, Quinn & Rossi v. Wilson, (1987) 197 Cal.App.3d 1, 4
(action involving trust property was a commercial, not a consumer,
transaction).
Although Landlord’s memorandum does not address this issue,
Guarantors are officers of the entity Defendants.  Costello is President of LA Kids, Daniell is
owner of Charm, and Christen is a member of Charm.  Thus, each Guarantor entered into their
Guaranty as part of their business and the attachment against him or her is a
commercial claim.
 
6. Property Is
Adequately Described
Where the defendant is a natural person, the description of
the property must be reasonably adequate to permit the defendant to identify
the specific property sought to be attached. 
CCP §484.020(e).  Although the
property must be specifically described, the plaintiff may target for
attachment everything the individual defendant owns.  Bank of America v. Salinas Nissan, Inc.,
(1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 260, 268.
Landlord seeks attachment of the individual Defendants’
identified property in compliance with this authority.  
 
E. Conclusion
The applications for right
to attach orders are granted.  No writ
shall issue against any Defendant until a $10,000 bond has been posted for that
Defendant.
