And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Honorable Teresa A. Beaudet, judge of the Los Angeles Superior Court, has issued a tentative ruling in the case of JAVIER LOPEZ v. FORD MOTOR COMPANY, et al (Case No. 24STCV07570). The judge has disclosed that she and her husband purchased a pickup truck approximately 24 years ago, which developed electrical problems. The judge's husband took the truck to the dealer multiple times for the same issue, and eventually, the manufacturer and dealer agreed to take the truck back and refund the purchase price. The judge believes that her experience will not cause her to be biased for or against either party, but she has given the parties until September 30, 2024, to file a verified statement of disqualification if they believe otherwise. The judge has continued the Case Management Conference to November 12, 2024, unless both parties waive their right to file a statement.
