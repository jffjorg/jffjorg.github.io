I.          INTRODUCTION
 
On October 14, 2022, Plaintiff, Guillermo Rodriguez, filed
this action against Defendant, Kristie Smith, in her capacity as an individual,
as successor trustee of the Lou Cutell Trust, and as sole successor in interest
to the Estate of Lou Cutell.  Plaintiff
alleges that Defendant unduly influenced decedent Lou Cutell to remove
Plaintiff from receiving his inheritance under decedent’s trust.  Plaintiff is currently self-represented.[1]
 
Relevant Background 
 
On December 6, 2023, Defendant filed a motion to compel
Plaintiff’s further responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One.  Defendant requested sanctions against Plaintiff.
 
On December 12, 2023, Defendant filed a motion to compel
Plaintiff’s compliance with his agreement to produce documents in response to
Defendant’s Request for Production of Documents, Set One.
 
On January 4, 2024, the court granted Plaintiff’s counsel’s
motion to be relieved as counsel. 
Plaintiff did not appear at the hearing. 
On the same day, Plaintiff was served with Notice of the Ruling.  The court also set an OSC re: Status of
Plaintiff’s Counsel for January 22, 2024. 

 
On January 22, 2024, the court held the OSC re: Status of
Plaintiff’s Counsel.  Plaintiff did not
appear at the hearing.  The court
continued the OSC to January 31, 2024. 
 
On January 31, 2024, the court held the OSC re: Status of
Plaintiff’s counsel and heard Defendant’s motions to compel (filed December 6
and 12).  The court granted Defendant’s
motions to compel.  Plaintiff did not
appear at the hearing.  The court set an
OSC re: Dismissal for Failure to Prosecute for February 27, 2024.
 
On February 27, 2024, the court held the OSC re: Dismissal
for Failure to Prosecute. Plaintiff did not appear at the hearing.  The court continued the OSC to April 8, 2024,
stating, “If … Plaintiff fails to appear on the next hearing date, the Court
will dismiss the matter pursuant to CCP 581(b)(5) and 581(g).”
 
On March 7, 2024, Defendant filed this motion for
terminating sanctions.  
 
The motion is unopposed.[2]

 
II.        LEGAL
STANDARDS
      
Terminating Sanctions 
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030 gives the court the
discretion to impose sanctions against anyone engaging in a misuse of the
discovery process.¿ Misuse of the discovery process includes failure to respond
to an authorized method of discovery or disobeying a court order to provide
discovery.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subds. (d), (g).)¿ A court may impose
terminating sanctions by striking pleadings of the party engaged in misuse of
discovery or entering default judgment.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd.
(d).)¿ A violation of a discovery order is sufficient for the imposition of
terminating sanctions.¿ (Collison & Kaplan v. Hartunian (1994) 21
Cal.App.4th 1611, 1620.)¿ Terminating sanctions are appropriate when a party
persists in disobeying the court’s orders.¿ (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84
Cal.App.3d 771, 795-796 (Deyo).)¿¿¿¿¿ 
 
The court should consider the totality of the circumstances,
including conduct of the party to determine if the actions were willful, the
detriment to the propounding party, and the number of formal and informal
attempts to obtain discovery.¿ (Lang v. Hochman (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th
1225, 1246.)¿ If a lesser sanction fails to curb abuse, a greater sanction is
warranted.¿ (Van Sickle v. Gilbert (2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 1495, 1516.)¿
However, “the unsuccessful imposition of a lesser sanction is not an absolute
prerequisite to the utilization of the ultimate sanction.”¿ (Deyo,
supra, 84 Cal.App.3d at p. 787.)         ¿ 
 
Before any sanctions may be imposed the court must make an
express finding that there has been a willful failure of the party to serve the
required answers.¿ (Fairfield v. Superior Court for Los Angeles County (1966)
246 Cal.App.2d 113, 118.)¿ Lack of diligence may be deemed willful where the
party understood its obligation, had the ability to comply, and failed to
comply.¿ (Deyo, supra, 84 Cal.App.3d at p. 787; Fred Howland Co. v.
Superior Court of Los Angeles County (1966) 244 Cal.App.2d 605, 610-611.)¿
The party who failed to comply with discovery obligations has the burden of
showing that the failure was not willful.¿ (Deyo, supra, 84 Cal.App.3d
at p. 788; Cornwall v. Santa Monica Dairy Co. (1977) 66 Cal.App.3d 250;
Evid. Code, §§ 500, 605.)¿¿¿ 
 
A terminating sanction is a “drastic measure which should be
employed with caution.”¿ (Deyo, 84 Cal.App.3d at p. 793.)¿ “A decision
to order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly.¿ But where a
violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows
that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery
rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.”¿ (Mileikowsky
v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 262, 279-280.)¿ While the
court has discretion to impose terminating sanctions, these sanctions “should
be appropriate to the dereliction and should not exceed that which is required
to protect the interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery.”¿ (Deyo,
84 Cal.App.3d at p. 793.)¿ “[A] court is empowered to apply the ultimate
sanction against a litigant who persists in the outright refusal to comply with
his discovery obligations.”¿ (Ibid.)¿ Discovery sanctions are not
to be imposed for punishment, but instead are used to encourage fair disclosure
of discovery to prevent unfairness resulting for the lack of information.¿ (See
Midwife v. Bernal (1988) 203 Cal.App.3d 57, 64 [superseded on other
grounds as stated in Kohan v. Cohan (1991) 229 Cal.App.3d 967,
971].)¿¿¿ 
 
Dismissal of the Action
 
The court may dismiss an action without prejudice when
either party fails to appear on the trial and the other party appears and asks
for dismissal. (Code Civ. Proc., §¿581, subd. (b)(5).)
 
III.       DISCUSSION
 
Terminating Sanctions
 
As the Second District Court of Appeal stated in Deyo,
supra, 84 Cal.App.3d at pp. 795-796, “[t]erminating sanctions are
appropriate when a party persists in disobeying the court’s orders.”¿
Terminating sanctions are appropriate here for that very reason.¿ Plaintiff did
not provide Defendant with responsive documents to her production requests
despite agreeing to do so and disobeyed a Court Order compelling him to comply
with his agreement.¿¿¿Plaintiff also did not provide further discovery
responses to Defendant’s special interrogatories and disobeyed a Court order
compelling him to provide further responses. 
Further, Plaintiff did not file oppositions to Defendant’s motions to
compel and, in a familiar pattern, has failed to oppose this motion for
terminating sanctions as well.  
 
Terminating sanctions are further appropriate for
Plaintiff’s chronic failure to appear for proceedings in this matter.  For instance, Plaintiff did not appear for
the hearing on Plaintiff’s counsel’s motion to be relieved on January 4, 2024.  Plaintiff did not appear at OSCs on January
22, 2024 and February 27, 2024.  Plaintiff
again did not appear for the hearing on Defendant’s motions to compel and OSC
re: Status of Plaintiff’s Counsel on January 31, 2024.  Plaintiff was served with notice of the
court’s orders from the foregoing hearings. 
Plaintiff’s unwillingness to advance his claims is palpable. 
 
The court finds Plaintiff knew of his discovery obligations
and knew of the Court Orders compelling his compliance and noting his absence
at hearings.  The court finds Plaintiff’s
failure to respond to discovery and to appear in hearings beginning from
January 4, 2024 to the present was willful, as was his disobedience to the
Court’s Orders.¿ Given Plaintiff’s apparent disinterest in prosecuting this
action, the court finds lesser sanctions would not curb the abuse.¿¿ 
 
Dismissal for Failure to Prosecute
 
Alternatively, dismissal of the action is proper if
Plaintiff does not appear at trial.  The
court may dismiss an action without prejudice when either party fails to appear
on the trial and the other party appears and asks for dismissal. (Code
Civ. Proc., §¿581, subd. (b)(5).)
 
Here, on February 27, 2024, the court issued an order
advancing the trial date to April 8, 2024 and stated, “If … Plaintiff fails to
appear on the next hearing date, the Court will dismiss the matter pursuant to
CCP 581(b)(5) and 581(g).”  (Minute
Order, 2/27/24.)  April 8, 2024, is the
next hearing date contemplated by the February 27, 2024, order.  Defendant served Plaintiff with notice of the
order.  (See Notice of Ruling,
3/1/24.)  Plaintiff has failed to appear
at the past several hearings.  If Plaintiff
fails to appear on April 8, 2024, and defendant makes a motion to dismiss, the
court will alternatively dismiss this case for failure to appear at trial.  
 
IV.       CONCLUSION
 
            The unopposed
motion for terminating sanctions is GRANTED.  Plaintiff Guillermo
Rodriguez’s Complaint against Defendant Kristie Smith is dismissed without
prejudice.¿ 
 
            Alternatively,
if Plaintiff fails to appear and Defendant makes a motion to dismiss, the motion
to dismiss is GRANTED without prejudice.
 
Defendant to give notice.
