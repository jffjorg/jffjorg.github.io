And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by General Motors LLC (Defendant). The case involves allegations that Defendant failed to repair a vehicle to conform to warranties and concealed information about the transmission.

The judge has overruled the demurrer to the third cause of action (fraudulent inducement) and sustained the demurrer to the fourth cause of action (violation of CLRA) with leave to amend. The judge has also denied the motion to strike Prayer for Relief E at 36:10 (punitive damages).

The judge has found that the allegations in the complaint are sufficient to plead fraud by concealment, and that the defendant's representations about the vehicle's quality and grade were material and known to be false. However, the judge has also found that the plaintiff has not pled the element of actual reliance upon the misrepresentation causing her harm.

The judge has given the plaintiff 30 days' leave to amend the complaint to cure the defects identified in the demurrer.
