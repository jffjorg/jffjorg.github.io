And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants Plaintiffs' Motion for Leave to Amend the Complaint. The Plaintiffs, Alfonso Cardenas and Sandra Cardenas, are seeking to add further factual allegations and claims for Trespass and Elder Abuse to their original complaint against their neighbors, John Yadegar and Stephanie Louise Samuel-Yadegar. The Plaintiffs allege that the Defendants have improperly maintained multiple fences, walls, hedges, and other vegetation along the property line, installed video cameras that record Plaintiffs and their property, and made recent changes to their property. The Judge finds that the Plaintiffs have complied with the requirements for amending the complaint and that the proposed amendment does not demonstrate any prejudice to the Defendants. The Judge therefore grants the Plaintiffs' motion and orders them to file and serve the First Amended and Supplemental Complaint (FASC) within 10 days.
