 Case Number:  24VECV03115    Hearing Date:   July 3, 2024    Dept:  T 24VECV03115 Lange v Scenic Bison
Counsel for moving party alleges that: “On May 24, 2024, the United States District Court for the Central District of California entered an order which charged in favor of Katofsky’s judgment creditor in the Georgia case all of Katofsky’s economic and transferrable interests in eight California LLCs, including defendant Gapper, LLC, which shares a checking account with defendant SBOC.”
Given that the account of SBOC is jointly owned by Gapper and is already subject to an order in the Federal court action, the court declines to issue the writ of attachment on that account on an ex parte basis.  Any further request shall be by noticed motion.
Moving party is reminded of the requirement under CRC 3.300 to file a Notice of Related Cases in every related California case (open or closed) and under each case number forthwith.
