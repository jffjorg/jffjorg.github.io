And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on two motions to compel deposition filed by the defendant, Sky World. The motions are granted, and the depositions of the two plaintiffs, Matthew Wade Buser and Laina Deni Caltagirone, will take place via Zoom. The depositions will be held on July 23, 2024, with Buser's deposition scheduled for 9 a.m. and Caltagirone's deposition scheduled for 11 a.m. Both plaintiffs are required to produce identification at the deposition. The Judge notes that there was no opposition filed by the plaintiffs and no explanation from their counsel as to why the depositions have not taken place. As a result, the Judge has assessed monetary sanctions against both plaintiffs in the sum of $500.46, payable to the defendant by July 30, 2024. The Judge finds that the delay in deposing the plaintiffs is a result of discovery abuse without substantial justification.
