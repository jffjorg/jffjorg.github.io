And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

Judge Theresa M. Traber has issued a tentative ruling on Ford Motor Company's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings. The motion seeks judgment on the pleadings as to the first four causes of action under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act and the seventh cause of action under the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act.

The judge grants the motion as to the first four causes of action, finding that the plaintiff, Moayed Harb, has conclusively admitted that the vehicle was purchased outside of California and is therefore not subject to the refund-or-replace provision of the Song-Beverly Act. The judge also denies the motion as to the seventh cause of action, finding that the plaintiff did not engage in the informal dispute settlement procedure mandated under the Magnuson-Moss Act.

The judge does not grant leave to amend the complaint, finding that the plaintiff has not demonstrated how the complaint might be amended to cure the deficiencies identified in the motion. The motion is therefore granted without leave to amend as to the first four causes of action and otherwise denied.
