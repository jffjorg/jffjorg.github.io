And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Plaintiff Bruce Dwain Copeland's motion to deem the truth of matters stated in two sets of requests for admissions as admitted. The Plaintiff had propounded the requests for admissions on September 19, 2024, but the Defendant, Amy Pham, did not receive a full copy of the discovery and was not served with a copy of the motion. The judge found that the Plaintiff did not provide the Defendant with a fair opportunity to respond to the requests for admissions, as required by statute. The judge also denied the Defendant's request for sanctions against the Plaintiff, finding the request to be unreasonably inflated.
