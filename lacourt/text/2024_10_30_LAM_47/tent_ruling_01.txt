STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is an action for quiet
title and injunctive relief. Plaintiff contends that Defendant is fraudulently
claiming ownership of the property in which Plaintiff resides and which he
contends that he owns.
 
Plaintiff moves to deem the truth
of matters stated in two sets of requests for admissions as admitted. 
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Plaintiff’s Motion to Deem the
Truth of Matters in Requests for Admissions is DENIED. 
 
Defendant Pham’s request for
sanctions is DENIED.
 
//
 
//
DISCUSSION:
 
Plaintiff moves to deem the truth
of matters stated in two sets of requests for admissions as admitted. 
 
Request for Judicial Notice
 
            Defendant
requests that the Court take judicial notice of (1) a deed to Defendant Pham
from the now-dismissed Defendant US Bank; (2) an unlawful detainer judgment
against Plaintiff in favor of Defendant Pham; and (3) the dismissal of
Defendant US Bank. 
 
These materials are not relevant to
the Court’s ruling on this motion and Defendant’s request is therefore DENIED. (Gbur v. Cohen (1979) 93 Cal.App.3d 296, 301
(“[J]udicial notice . . . is always confined to those matters which are
relevant to the issue at hand.”].) 
 
Legal
Standard
 
When a party to
whom requests for admission are directed fails to respond, the party propounding
the requests may move for an order that the truth of any matters specified in
the requests be deemed admitted. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280(b).) “The court
shall make this order [deem the requests admitted], unless it finds that the
party to whom the request for admissions have been directed has served, before
the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests for admission
that is in substantial compliance with section 2033.220.” (Code Civ. Proc. §
2033.280(c).)
 
Analysis
 
Plaintiff seeks an order deeming
the truth of matters stated in two sets of requests for admissions which were
purportedly served on Defendant Pham on September 19, 2024. Defendant claims
that she did not receive a full copy of the discovery that is the subject of
the motion. Further, Defendant contends that she was never served with a copy
of the motion, and the included proof of service is undated. Even if service
were properly made, the instant motion was filed on September 30, 2024, only 11
days after the requests for admissions were purportedly propounded. Pursuant to
Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.250 subdivision (a), a party has 30 days
to respond to requests for admissions. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.250(a).)
Plaintiff may not simply propound requests for admissions and then move to have
those requests deemed admitted without first providing Defendant a fair
opportunity to respond as provided by statute. 
 
Plaintiff is therefore not entitled
to an order deeming the truth of the matters stated in these requests for
admissions.

Sanctions
 
            Defendant
requests sanctions against Plaintiff for prematurely bringing this motion. 
 
            The
Court may impose a monetary sanction on a party engaging in a misuse of the
discovery process to pay the reasonable expenses incurred by anyone because of
that conduct. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.030(a).) Use of a discovery method in a
manner that does not comply with its specified procedures is a misuse of the
discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.010(b).) Persisting, over objection
and without substantial justification, in an attempt to obtain information or
materials that are outside the scope of permissible discovery is also a misuse
of the discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.010(a).) 
 
            Here, Defendant requests a total of $2,496
in sanctions against Plaintiff based on 3 hours of attorney time at $495 per
hour, plus 2 additional anticipated hours, plus $21.00 in costs. (Declaration
of Larry Rothman ISO Opp. ¶ 4.) The Court finds this request unreasonably
inflated. It should not take five hours of attorney time to address a routine
discovery motion. The
Court therefore exercises its discretion to deny this request. (Chavez v. City of Los
Angeles (2010) 47 Cal.
4th 970, 989-991.) 
 
CONCLUSION
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion
to Deem the Truth of Matters in Requests for Admissions is DENIED. 
 
Defendant Pham’s request for
sanctions is DENIED.
 
            Moving
Party to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.

            Any party may submit on the
tentative ruling by contacting the courtroom via email at Smcdept47@lacourt.org by no later than 4:00 p.m. the day
before the hearing. All interested parties must be copied on the email. It
should be noted that if you submit on a tentative ruling the court will still
conduct a hearing if any party appears. By submitting on the tentative you
have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you
should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an
order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
