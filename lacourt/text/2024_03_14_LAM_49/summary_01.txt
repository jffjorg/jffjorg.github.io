And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling denies the defendants' motion to tax the post-judgment costs of $5,274.00 filed by the plaintiff, Immigrant Rights Defense Counsel. The defendants argued that the memorandum of costs was untimely, but the court found that it was filed within two years of incurring the costs, as required by statute. The defendants also argued that the underlying judgment was stayed pending appeal, but the court noted that the stay does not apply to post-judgment matters involving the amount of the judgment. Finally, the defendants claimed that the attorney's fees sought were not recoverable as costs, but the court found that the Immigration Consultants Act allows for the recovery of reasonable attorney's fees and costs. The court also rejected the defendants' contention that the costs and interest sought were excessive and unsupported by evidence, noting that the burden is on the party seeking to tax costs to show that the costs were not reasonable or necessary.
