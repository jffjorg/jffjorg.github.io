And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling is that the demurrer filed by the California Unemployment Insurance Board (CUIAB) is sustained without leave to amend. The petition filed by Inyong Okon is untimely under Unemployment Insurance Code (UIC) section 410, which sets a six-month deadline for seeking judicial review from an appeals board decision. The CUIAB's decision, which was final on or before December 22, 2022, was not challenged within the statutory time frame. Okon's remedy lies with a new application to the Employment Development Department (EDD) for benefits, rather than seeking judicial review. The court sets an order to show cause re: dismissal under CCP section 581(f)(1) for June 6, 2024.
