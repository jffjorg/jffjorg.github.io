City relies on Weber
v. Bd. of Ret. of Los Angeles Cnty. Ret. Ass'n., (“Weber”)
(1998) 62 Cal.App.4th 1440, in which a class action on behalf of county
disability retirees sought interest from the date of the administrative
determination of an entitlement to the benefits.  Id. at 1445.  As in this case, the petitioners were seeking
interest on a retroactive benefit payment. Id. The court refused to
award pre-judgment interest because the retroactive lump sum payments were paid
as promised and thus the petitioners were not denied any benefits and did not
suffer damage.  Id. at 1446-47.  Reply at 4.
            The City’s reliance on Weber
is misplaced.  The Weber court
held that a retirement board was not statutorily authorized to award
pre-judgment interest when granting retroactive benefits.   Id. at 1446.  Conversely, a trial court could award
pre-judgment interest following a successful administrative mandamus action to
recover benefits wrongfully withheld by the retirement board.  Id. 
That is the situation here.
