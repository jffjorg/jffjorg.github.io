```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a case where the City is arguing that it should not be required to pay pre-judgment interest on a retroactive benefit payment. The City is relying on a previous case, Weber v. Bd. of Ret. of Los Angeles Cnty. Ret. Ass'n., which held that a retirement board is not statutorily authorized to award pre-judgment interest when granting retroactive benefits. However, the judge finds this reliance misplaced, as the Weber court's ruling was specific to a retirement board, whereas the current case involves a trial court. The judge concludes that a trial court could award pre-judgment interest following a successful administrative mandamus action to recover benefits wrongfully withheld by the retirement board, which is the situation in this case.
