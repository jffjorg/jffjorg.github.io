  Case Number:  23STCP04135    Hearing Date:   June 25, 2024    Dept:  85 
Los Angeles Police Protective
League v. Szabo, et al., 23STCP04135

Tentative decision on motion for
judgment on petition: denied




 



 
Respondents City of Los Angeles and Kenneth Mejia (“Mejia”),
City Controller for the City (collectively, “City”) move for judgment on the
Petition and Complaint (collectively, “Petition”) of Petitioner Los Angeles
Police Protective League (“LAPPL”). 
The court has read and considered the moving papers,
opposition, and reply, and renders the following tentative decision. 
 
A. Statement of
the Case
1. Petition and Complaint
On November 15, 2023, Petitioner LAPPL filed the Petition against
Respondents City, Kenneth Mejia, and Matt Szabo (“Szabo”), and City
Administrative Officer for the City for (1) writ of mandate pursuant to CCP section
1085, (2) breach of contract, (3) declaratory relief, and (4) breach of implied
covenant of good faith and fair dealing. 
The Petition alleges in pertinent as follows.
LAPPL is a recognized organization within the meaning of
Government Code section 3501(b) of the Meyers-Milias Brown Act (“MMBA”) for all
employees in the classifications of Police Officer, Police Detective, Police
Sergeant and Police Lieutenant employed by the Los Angeles Police Department
(“LAPD”) with regard to all matters concerning wages, hours, and working
conditions.  Pet., ¶1.
From January to July 2023, authorized representatives of the
City and LAPPL met and conferred pursuant to Government Code section 3505 of
the MMBA regarding the terms of a successor Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”)
to the MOU expiring on June 30, 2023 for represented employees of the LAPPL
bargaining unit.  Pet., ¶6.  Negotiations concluded in late July 2023 until
a tentative agreement was reached on the new terms to be included in the
successor MOU.  Pet., ¶6.
On or about August 9, 2023, the Executive Employee Relations
Committee (“EERC”) of the City Council instructed the Office of the City
Administrator to transmit the tentative agreement between the parties to the
City Council for its consideration pending ratification by the LAPPL
membership,.  Pet., ¶7.  The following day, LAPPL notified the City
that the tentative agreement had been ratified by its membership.  Pet., ¶8.
On August 23, 2023, at a public meeting, the City Council
voted 12-3 to approve the tentative agreement culminating in a successor MOU
No. 24 (the “MOU”) with a term commencing July 2, 2023 and expiring on June 26,
2027.  Pet., ¶9, Ex. A.
Under the MOU, LAPPL represented employees were entitled,
effective July 16, 2023, inter alia, to a 6% wage increase (comprised of base
wage and retention/longevity pay increase), patrol incentive pay (Geographic
Patrol and Traffic Division Crime Suppression Incentive) and weekday
standby compensation for employees in LAPD assignments including Homicide
Units, Officer Representation Section, Force Investigation Division, and
Juvenile Division/Abuse Child Unit. 
Pet., ¶10.
The City has failed to provide the requisite wage and
compensation increases required by the MOU, as well as failed to provide such
monetary increases retroactive to the contractually agreed effective date of
July 16, 2023.  Pet., ¶11.  Szabo and Mejia, respectively, had advised
authorized representatives of LAPPL that the reason for the delay in
implementing the contractually agreed wages/compensation was attributable to
each other’s office.  Pet., ¶11.
On September 29, 2023, LAPPL, by letter to Szabo and Mejia,
made a final demand for a date certain by which LAPPL’s represented employees
would receive their compensation increases due under the MOU.  Pet., ¶12, Ex. B.
On October 3, 2023, Szabo and Mejia responded by letter and contended
that delay in implementing the compensation increases due under the MOU was
occasioned by the “complexity of the contract terms and the citywide payroll
system transition”.  Pet., ¶13, Ex.
C.  While acknowledging the City’s
“responsibility to implement the new contract terms and retroactive adjustments
as quickly as possible”, Szabo and Mejia advised that they “should be able to
implement the new MOU successfully starting with the pay period commencing
October 22, 2023”.  However “if testing
identifies issues, additional time may be required to correct them.”  Pet., ¶13, Ex. C.  
The increases still have not been implemented by the City to
date, despite several subsequent reminders by LAPPL and corresponding assurance
by the City of imminent implementation. 
Pet., ¶14.
LAPPL seeks (1) a writ of mandate commanding the City to
immediately provide to LAPPL’s represented employees wage increases and/or
newly created and/or increased specialty pays and special compensation, and/or
increased overtime inclusive of the increased base rate of pay, payable
effective from July 16, 2023, as required under the MOU; (2) monetary damages
in excess of $25,000; (3) damages resulting from breach of implied promise of
good faith and fair dealing; (4) pre-judgment interest; (5) post-judgment
interest; (6) declaration that the City has engaged in improper conduct and/or
actions constituting breach and violation of the MOU by failing to timely
provide LAPPL’s represented employees  increases
of wages and/or newly created and/or increased specialty pays and special
compensation, and/or increased overtime inclusive of the increased base rate of
pay, payable effective from July 16, 2023; (7) costs of suit; (8) reasonable
attorney fees pursuant to CCP section 1021.5; and (9) such other relief as the
court deems just and proper.  Pet. at 9-10.
 
2. Course of Proceedings
On November 14, 2023, LAPPL served the City with the
Petition and Summons via personal service.
On November 20, 2023, Szabo was dismissed without prejudice
from this action. 
On December 8, 2023, LAPPL served Mejia, City Controller for
the City with the Petition and Summons via substituted service. 
On February 22, 2024, Respondents filed their Answer. 
 
B. Applicable Law
A motion for judgment under CCP section 1094 may be made
where the petition for a writ of mandate (1) presents no triable issue of fact
or (2) is based solely on the administrative record. The CCP section 1094 motion for judgment is a mechanism to obtain a streamlined
review on a particular undisputed issue based on undisputed facts or the
administrative record.  Dunn v. County
of Santa Barbara, (2006) 135 Cal.App.4th 1281, 1293.  See also 2 CEB California Administrative Mandamus §13.23 (3d ed. 2007).  
When a question of fact is raised by the respondent’s
answer, the petitioner has the right to countervail it with proof.  CCP §1091; Lassen v. City of Alameda,
(“Lassen”) (1957) 150 Cal.App.2d 44, 47. 
If the facts are undisputed or only a question of law is raised, the
court may hear the matter upon the papers filed and argument.  Lassen, supra, 150 Cal.App.2d
at 47.  The petitioner also may waive the
right to present evidence, and the matter still may be heard under CCP section
1094.  Ibid.  If a question of fact is raised by the
answer, a CCP section 1094 motion is not appropriate, and the matter must be
heard at trial.  See id. at
48.  In denying a
CCP section 1094 motion, the court may decide that the facts are disputed and
hence the motion is procedurally defective, or it may decide that the
undisputed facts/record show the moving party cannot prevail on that
issue.  
 
C. Statement of Facts
1. City’s Evidence
In the days after City Council ratified the MOU, Mejia and Szabo
began extensive and substantial efforts to implement salary increases to more
than 8,900 individual LAPD employees and union members.  Quach Decl., ¶2.  The efforts were initially hampered as Szabo
and Mejia discovered technical errors in the wage amounts negotiated by LAPPL
and Szabo in the MOU.  Quach Decl., ¶2.
Mejia informed LAPPL on September 13, 2023 concerning issues
with “the way the MOU was written in Appendix B-2 page taking effect July 16,
2023”.  Mejia understood the terms as a “COLA
increase (which is pensionable),” but Szabo clarified “the CAO ERD's intent for
the following schedules were...[to] keep the base wage alone and apply a 3% nonpensionable
bonus” for “Police Officers” and an increase in “base wage and non-pensionable
bonus” for “Detectives and above”.  Quach
Decl., ¶3, Ex. A.
On September 28, 2023, Szabo issued a memorandum addressing
the “technical errors” in “MOU-24, Article 5.1, Appendices B-1 through D-3”
directing Mejia to recalculate the wage increases under a 3% non-pensionable “bonus”
rate.  Quach Decl., ¶4, Ex. B.  After issuance of Szabo’s directive,
implementation of the increased wages under the MOU required herculean efforts
through individualized assessments of both yearly salary and specific incentive
payments based on an officer’s particular deployment periods and assignments.  Quach Decl., ¶5.  Such individualized assessments were
complicated by the technical corrections that required a split between pension
and non-pension-based wage increases to employees’ salaries.  Quach Decl., ¶5.
Bob Hess, an outside consultant, was hired to strategize and
implement testing protocols for the wage increases to ensure their
accuracy.  Quach Decl., ¶6.  Specialty payments including patrol bonuses
or other bonuses were also to be determined at the LAPD level through
individualized approvals.  Quach Decl.,
¶6.  Mejia’s office thus required the
input of LAPD’s sub-groups to verify eligibility dates and amounts for these
specialty payments before any retroactive payment could be calculated, which
took several months of continuous calculation and testing by dozens of City
employees and consultants.  Quach Decl.,
¶7.  
These efforts culminated in the City’s issuance of a
$25,798,226.56 payment to all 8,909 LAPD employees and LAPPL union-members on
December 27, 2023.  Quach Decl., ¶8.  The December 27, 2023 payment was a
retroactive salary increase calculated based on the MOU’s effective date of
July 16, 2023 and matched the amounts agreed to in Appendices B-1 through 3 of
the MOU but did not include any payment of pre-judgment interest to any LAPD
employee or LAPPL member.  Quach Decl.,
¶¶8-9.
 
2. LAPPL’s Evidence
Following the adoption of the MOU by the City Council, LAPPL
initiated multiple verbal and written communications to the office of Szabo and
Mejia inquiring as to the date the City would be implementing the compensation
increases pursuant to the terms of the MOU. 
Joint Statement of Facts (“JSF”), ¶7. 
In response to the inquiries by LAPPL, Szabo and Mejia, each advised
authorized representatives of LAPPL that the reason for the delay in
implementation of the compensation increases due was attributable to the other’s
office.  JSF, ¶9. 
On September 29, 2023, LAPPL, by letter to Szabo and Mejia,
made a final demand for a date certain by which the LAPPL’s represented
employees would receive their compensation increases due under the MOU.  JSF ¶8; Levine Decl., ¶3, Ex.1 (Pet., ¶12,
Ex. B).
On October 3, 2023, Szabo and Mejia advised LAPPL by letter
that “[t]he City recognizes the responsibility to implement the new contract
terms and retroactive adjustments as quickly as possible. The Controller and
the CAO are in close coordination and believe that we should be able to
implement the new MOU successfully starting with the pay period commencing
October 22, 2023.”  JSF, ¶10; Levine
Decl., ¶3, Ex.1 (Pet., ¶13, Ex. C).
On November 9, 2023 the Petition was filed.  Levine Decl., ¶3, Ex.1.  On November 14, 2023, the lawsuit was served
on the City.  Levine Decl., ¶4, Ex. 2.  On December 8, 2023, the lawsuit was served
on Mejia.  Levine Decl., ¶5, Ex. 3.
On or about December 27, 2023, the City issued a payment to
certain LAPPL represented employees.  JSF,
¶11.  The December 27, 2023 payment was a
retroactive payment calculated based on an effective date of July 16, 2023.  JSF, ¶12. 
The City’s retroactive payment did not include any pre-judgment interest
to any LAPD represented employees.  JSF,
¶13.
 
D. Analysis
The City moves for judgment under CCP section 1094 on the grounds that
(1) it has no duty to pay pre-judgment interest, (2) pre-judgment interest
cannot be enforced by mandamus in this case, and (3) LAPPL fails to state a
claim because it seeks an unlawful double recovery and the issue is moot.
 
1. Pre-Judgment Interest Is Available to LAAPL’s Members in an
Action for Damages
The right to pre-judgment interest against the debtor under Civil Code
section 3287 (“section 3287”) flows from the date a person had the right to
recover damages upon a particular date:
 
“A person who is entitled to recover
damages certain, or capable of being made certain by calculation, and the right
to recover which is vested in the person upon a particular day, is entitled
also to recover interest thereon from that day, except when the debtor is
prevented by law, or by the act of the creditor from paying the debt. This
section is applicable to recovery of damages and interest from any debtor,
including the state or any county, city, city and county, municipal
corporation, public district, public agency, or any political subdivision of
the state.”  Civil Code §3287(a)
(emphasis added).
 
An action to recover wrongfully withheld pay increases or past due
pension payments from public entities is an action for damages within the
meaning of section 3287.  See Sanders
v. City of Los Angeles, (“Sanders”) (1970) 3 Cal.3d 252, 262-63
(pre-judgment interest awarded for retroactive fireman pay increase); Olson
v. Cory, (1983) 35 Cal.3d 390, 402.  Interest
is recoverable on each salary or pension payment from the date it fell due.  Currie v. Workers Compensation Appeal Board,
(2001) 24 Cal.4th 1109, 1115 (pre-judgment interest awarded on backpay when
employee reinstated).
The elements required to obtain pre-judgment interest under section 3287
are as follows: (1) an underlying monetary obligation, (2) damages which are
certain or capable of being made certain by calculation, and (3) a right to
recovery that vests on a particular day.” Flethez v. San Bernardino County
Employees Retirement Assn., (2017) 2 Cal.5th 630, 640.
For the first element – an underlying monetary obligation -- “[i]n
applying the Meyers-Milias-Brown Act, the courts have uniformly held that a
memorandum of understanding, once adopted by the governing body of a public
agency, becomes a binding agreement."  Glendale City Employees' Ass'n v. Glendale,
(“Glendale”) (1975) 15 Cal.3d 328, 337. 
Article 1.4 of the MOU provides that “[t]his MOU shall become effective
when: A. The agreement has been ratified by the employees of the Unit; and B.
The agreement has been approved by the City Council in the manner required by
law.”  JSF, ¶5.  It is undisputed that LAPPL ratified the MOU
and that the City Council approved it on August 23, 2023.  JSF, ¶¶ 3-5. 
Therefore, following the City Council’s approval, the City had a legal monetary
obligation under the MOU.  
For the second element -- damages which are certain or capable of being
made certain by calculation -- the MOU includes certainty by means of detailed
appendices/spreadsheets/charts regarding the amount of increased base wages and
special compensation corresponding to the employees’ job classification and
salary step which were to be effective on July 16, 2023.  JSF ¶4. 
According to the City’s supporting declaration, on December 27, 2023 the
City quantified the amount of retroactive salary increases and specific
incentive payments payable to LAPPL’s represented employees in the total sum of
$25,798,226.56 based on the MOU's effective date of July 16, 2023, which
matched the amounts agreed to in Appendices B-1 thru 3 of the MOU.  Quach Decl., ¶¶ 5-8.  Accordingly, the MOU’s compensation increases
and new specific incentive payments were capable of being made certain by
calculation.
For the third element -- a right to recovery that vests on a particular
day -- in Olson v. Cory, (1983) 35 Cal.3d 390, the California
Supreme Court held that judges and judicial pensioners were entitled to pre-judgment
interest pursuant to Civil Code section 3287 on salary and pension increases.  Id. at 402.  In response to the defendant state and county
controllers’ argument that the salary and pension claims were not damages
capable of being made certain by calculation under section 3287(a), the court
answered that generally the certainty required is absent when the amount turns
on disputed facts, but not when the dispute is confined to the rules governing
liability.  Id.  The court stated:
 
“Here, the amount due each member of the
plaintiff class -- judges of courts of record and judicial pensioners -- at any
point in time between January 1, 1977, and June 27, 1980…was either of two
readily calculable amounts: (1) the salary or pension due under section 68203
as it read before the 1976 amendment or (2) that due under the section as
amended. The question whether to pay any judge or pensioner under one
version of the statute or the other did not depend on any factual uncertainty
or dispute but solely on the proper answers to the questions of law ultimately
resolved. Uncertainty over those legal issues did not prevent the amounts due
from being “certain or capable of being made certain by calculation” (Civ.
Code, § 3287, subd. (a)).”  Id.
(emphasis added).
 
LAPPL argues that it is undisputed that the right to recovery for all
LAPPL’s represented employees to salary increase and certain special
compensation vested on a particular day, to wit: “effective July 16, 2023.”  JSF, ¶6.  Indeed, in December 2023 the City
retroactively compensated LAPPL’s represented employees to that date,
conclusively proving that their right to recovery vested on a particular day.  Opp. at 12.
The City acknowledges that it had a contractual duty to pay wage
increases effective from July 16, 2023. 
It argues that LAPPL can point to no contractual provision in the MOU
requiring it City to disburse the wage increases on July 16, 2023.  MOU Articles 5.1, 5.4, and 6.5 state that the
increased “salaries and longevity payments shown in the Appendices [B-1 thru 3]
will be operative” or “effective on the following dates: July 16, 2023.”  Pet. Ex. A, pp. 37, 54.  But the terms “operative” or “effective” are
not defined in MOU-24.  LAPPL’s position
contradicts MOU Articles 1.2 and 1.4 that state “[t]his MOU shall
become effective” only after ratification by both parties.  JSF
¶4; Pet. Ex. A, pp. 1-2 (emphasis added). 
Ratification is a condition precedent that did not occur until
the City approved the MOU on Aug. 23, 2024. Pet. ¶ 9.  See Platt Pac. v. Andelson, (1993)
6 Cal. 4th 307, 313 (non-occurrence of condition precedent precludes emergence
of further contractual duties).  Thus,
LAPPL’s contention that the City owed a contractual duty to disburse wages
weeks before such contract was even enforceable is unsupported by the plain
language of the MOU.  Mot. at 11-12;
Reply at 3.
            The City concludes that the only
reasonable interpretation of the MOU is that it imposed a ministerial duty for
the City to calculate salary increases with the “effective” or “operative” date
of July 16, 2023.  See Employers
Reinsurance Co. v. Superior Court, (2008) 161 Cal. App. 4th 906, 919 (“In
determining if a provision is ambiguous, we consider not only the face of the
contract but also any extrinsic evidence”). The City could not even conduct
such calculation until September 28, 2024 when the Chief Administrative Officer
issued technical directives to address the inconsistencies in the MOU wage
increase provisions.  Quach Decl., ¶4,
Ex. B.  Mot. at 12. 
            The City argues that resolution of
this issue is a factual claim not capable of certainty.  A duty to calculate is not the same as a duty
to disburse.  The MOU does not set any date
by which the City had a legal duty to disburse the salary increases.  It at most references the “effective” and
“operative,” dates of July 16, 2024 pertaining to the calculation of
salary increases, not their disbursement. 
The contract was not even enforceable until City Council approved
the MOU on August 23, 2024, five weeks after the July 16 effective date.  LAPPL cannot point to any provision in the
MOU mandating that the City disburse the wage increases by a specific date.  At most, Article 6.1.3 of the MOU, governing
“Timely Payment of Overtime,” suggests that the City has a duty to pay
“overtime compensation [] as soon after the regular pay period as is
practicable,” but not to “be delayed for a period longer than is reasonably
necessary for the employer to compute and arrange for payment of the amount
due.”  JSF ¶4; Pet. Ex. A, p. 48.  This says nothing about the increased base
wages owed under Article 5.1.  Nor do
the Appendices B-1 through 3 provide any clarity; they merely set forth the
amounts of salary increases by rank and salary step, not the deadline to
disburse such wages.  JSF ¶4; Pet. Ex. A, pp. 37, 109-14.  Mot. at 12.
            This contractual
ambiguity requires resort to disputed facts and contractual analyses.  See
Suffolk Constr. Co., Inc.
v. Los Angeles Unified Sch. Dist., (2023)0 90 Cal. App. 5th 849, 878 (“We agree with the trial court that
Fisk’s claim [for prejudgment interest] was uncertain” as “the jury was
required to determine the amount owed to Fisk based on the varied evidence
presented at trial.”); see also Mass v. Bd. of Ed. of San
Francisco Unified Sch. Dist., (1964) 61 Cal. 2d 612, 625 (prejudgment
interest permissible only where “the salary payments became vested as of the
dates they accrued” based on a specific “contractual monetary
obligation”).  Mot. at 10, 12.
            Adjudication of the
issue would require a review of facts dating back decades reflecting the
parties’ course of dealings in disbursing wage increases under prior iterations
of the MOU. See Code Civ. Proc., § 1856(c) (“The terms set forth in a
writing described in subdivision (a) may be explained or supplemented by course
of dealing or usage of trade or by course of performance.”). See Magic Carpet
Ride LLC, 41 Cal. App. 5th at 366 (triable issues of fact precluded summary
judgment because court could not determine “such a cryptic provision” without
considering “[w]hat performance at what time is a condition of what party’s
duty to do what?”).  For example, “[t]he general rule in equity is that time
is not of the essence unless it has been made so by its express terms or is
necessarily so from the nature of the contract.” Katemis v. Westerlind, (1953)
120 Cal. App. 2d 537, 543.  Because there
are no disbursement deadlines in the MOU, a fact-finding jury would need to
exercise its judgment whether the City made the salary payments within a
reasonable time under the contract. See Magic Carpet Ride LLC v.
Rugger Inv. Grp., L.L.C., (2019) 41 Cal. App. 5th 357, 364 (2019) (“[W]here
time is not of the essence of a contract, payment made within a reasonable time
after the due date stated in the contract constitutes compliance therewith.”)
(citations omitted).  Mot. at 10,
12, 14.
            Under LAPPL’s theory,
the City would always be liable for interest on negotiated salary increases
made effective retroactively because of the procedural hurdles inherent in the
process: The City would accrue interest (1) during the time in which it took
the LAPPL membership to ratify the agreement, (2) during the time in which it
took the City Council to approve the agreement, and (3) during the tine in
which it took the City to modify its computer programmed payroll systems in
order to accurately implement the retroactive pay increase with all applicable
withholdings for each, uniquely situated employee.  It goes without saying that the City would
never agree to such terms, nor did it do so in this case. Reply at 3.    
            LAPPL responds that the
parties engaged in good faith negotiations and adopted an effective date for
compensation increases of July 16, 2023. 
Irrespective of any claimed contractual ambiguity respecting the timing
of the City’s payment of the wage increases under the MOU, the City has an
explicit contractual obligation to increase the specified wage increases and
implement new incentive pay “effective July 16, 2023”.  Specifically, under the MOU, LAPPL
represented employees were entitled, effective July 16, 2023, to, inter alia,
a 6% wage increase comprised of base wage and retention/longevity pay increase
(see Pet., Ex. A, Article 5.1, p. 53 and Appendices B1-3, pp.  109-114) and a Geographic Patrol and Traffic
Division Crime Suppression Incentive (Pet., Ex. A, Section 5.4, pp. 53-55.  
            Whether the City delayed
disbursement of the MOU salary and benefit increases/new incentive pays for a
period of two months or six months, it nevertheless had a ministerial and
contractual duty to make such payment of compensation increases retroactive to
the effective date of July 16, 2023. 
Therefore, pre-judgment interest under section 3287(a) accrued on the
underlying monetary obligation commencing with the effective date of July 16,
2023 specified with certainty in the MOU. 
If the City did not intend to create a contractual obligation to pay as
of July 16, 2023, it should have bargained for a later effective date, such as
the date of adoption of the MOU by the City Council.  It did not do so, which shows the City
understood that its obligations would include the requirement to pay back
wages, and that, as a matter of law, the delay in payment of those wages and
benefits would lead to the accrual of interest. 
Opp. at 12, 16.
            The City is correct that
the MOU creates a conditional ministerial duty to make salary and longevity
payments, effective on July 16, 2023, only after it has been ratified by LAPPL
and approved by the City Council.  But
the mere fact that the MOU does not become effective until these events occur
does not affect this ministerial duty. 
Ratification is a condition precedent to the effective date of the MOU (see Platt Pac. v.
Andelson,
(1993) 6 Cal. 4th 307, 313), but once the condition precedent is satisfied the
City’s duties springs into existence. 
This is true for the duty to pay wage increases and incentive pay as
well as the duty to pay any pre-judgment interest.
            The City also is correct
that extrinsic evidence is admissible in determining if a contract is ambiguous
(Employers
Reinsurance Co. v. Superior Court, supra, 161 Cal. App. 4th at 919)
and that the parties’ course of dealing
in disbursing wage increases under prior iterations of the MOU could be such
relevant extrinsic evidence.  See CCP
§1856(c).  But the City points to no
course of dealing or other extrinsic evidence required to determine if the MOU
is ambiguous.  The court does not find
any ambiguity without such evidence.  The
MOU clearly states that LAPPL members are entitled to the salary and longevity
payments as of July 16, 2023.  As a
result, based on the evidence presented, the third element of section 3287(a)
is satisfied and LAPPL’s members are entitled to pre-judgment interest from
that date until paid.
 
            2. The City’s Duty to Pay Pre-Judgment Interest Is
Enforceable by Mandamus
            The City suggests that LAPPL’s claim for pre-judgment interest flows from
its damages in its breach of contract causes of action.  Those money damages require resort to an
action at law and jury and may not be adjudicated by this court of equity.  Mot. at 17.
            Under California
law, damages are not awardable on a mandamus cause of action. While “the [ordinary
mandamus] action has the practical effect of awarding plaintiffs money (which
has routinely been referred to as “damages” by all parties), in law it is
simply an action in mandamus to compel by ministerial act the release of funds,
not one for damages from the sovereign.” 
County of Sacramento v. Lackner, (1979) 97 Cal. App. 3d
576, 588.  See Pomona Police Officers' Ass'n v. City of
Pomona, (“City of Pomona”)
(1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 578 (denial of mandamus petition proper as
“[t]he City should not be denied procedural safeguards, such as claim statutes
and the right to a jury trial, which it would enjoy in an ordinary action at
law.”).  
            “In proceedings involving claims for wages by municipal employees or by
parties to a contract with a municipality,” such as this case, “it is generally
held that an ordinary action at law for damages is adequate, and a writ of
mandate will be denied.” Tevis v. City & Cnty. of San Francisco, (1954)
43 Cal. 2d 190, 198.  However, an
exception exists where “the payment of the wages of a public employee requires
certain preliminary steps by public officials”, such as appropriating funds or
approving a payroll.  Glendale City
Employees' Assn., Inc. v. City of Glendale, (“City of Glendale”)
(1975) 15 Cal. 3d 328, 343.  A court may
thus grant a mandamus petition to direct a respondent city to compute and pay
the salaries as fixed by a MOU.  Id.
at 344.  A court may also grant
prejudgment interest if “precise mathematical standards which, applied to the
survey data, yield the exact sums due.”  Id.
at 344-45 (mandate for payment of
public employee wages under MOU, including pre-judgment interest).
            In Tripp v. Swoap,
(1976) 17 Cal.3d 671, the California Supreme Court reiterated that pre-judgment
interest under section 3287(a) is properly awarded in mandamus proceedings
based upon an underlying statutory monetary obligation of the public
entity.  Id. at 681.  In the case of the welfare statute at issue,
the elements of section 3287(a) were satisfied for pre-judgment interest on
retroactive payments, including that the right to receive welfare benefits
vests in the recipient on the first day of his entitlement.  Id. at 683.  The statute was not intended to deny
pre-judgment interest and an award of such interest conformed with the
statutory mandate that public assistance programs be liberally construed.  Id. at 685.  See also Sanders, supra,
3 Cal.3d at 262-63 (mandate requiring city to pay employees retroactive salary
and wage increases required by ordinance, with pre-judgment interest); Squire
v. City and County of San Francisco, (“Squire”) (1970) 12
Cal.App.3d 974, 982 (mandamus ordering city to comply with trial court’s
interpretation of charter regarding salary for union employees, including
pre-judgment interest); City and County of San Francisco v. Cooper,
(1975) 13 Cal.3d 898, 932 (mandate compelling controller to issue warrants
reflecting salary increases with pre-judgment interest for school district
employees after adoption of the city's salary standardization ordinance).
            In the instant case, at
a duly noticed public meeting on August 23, 2023, the City Council adopted the
MOU between the City and LAPPL which as a matter of law became the monetary
obligation for the City to pay the contractually required salary increases and
new incentive pays effective July 16, 2023. 
It
is undisputed that the City had to “take preliminary steps by public officials” with respect to these payment
obligations, including the Chief Administrative Officer’s technical
directives to address the inconsistencies in the MOU wage increase
provisions.  Quach Decl., ¶4, Ex. B.  Mandamus therefore is an appropriate means
for LAPPL to compel the payment.  City of Glendale, supra, 15 Cal. 3d at 343.  The City’s contractual obligation to pay as
of July 16, 2023 supports mandamus both to pay the salary increases and
incentives and any pre-judgment interest under section 3287(a) that accrued on
any delayed disbursement.  Because the
salary increases and incentives were owed as of July 16, 2023, it is clear that
“precise mathematical standards” applied to the City’s calculations will yield
the exact sums due for the pre-judgment interest owed to LAPPL’s members.  See City of Glendale, supra,
15 Cal. 3d at 344-45.
            The City argues that in
all the mandamus cases relied upon by LAPPL, either a statute or a contract creating
the obligation to pay clearly established both the method of calculating the
amount due and a date certain by which the payment must be made by the
governmental entity.  Olson v. Cory,
supra, 35 Cal.3d at 401 (awarding pre-judgment interest in dispute about
the statutory requirements of original and amended statute where payment was
not made within either deadline); Sanders, supra, 3 Cal.3d at 252
(awarding pre-judgment interest base on failure to meet fixed payment
date);  Squire, supra, 12
Cal. App. 3d at 982 (pre-judgment interest awarded based on due date in salary
ordinance).  Reply at 2-3.
            This is true.  The case law establishes that there must be a
statutory or contractual obligation to pay as of a date certain for
pre-judgment interest to be awarded in mandamus.  But the MOU establishes a July 16, 2023 date
for the pay increases and incentive pay.  

            The City argues that the
contractual ambiguity warrants dismissal of LAPPL’s mandamus claim.  In Pomona Police Officers' Ass'n v. City
of Pomona, (“City of Pomona”) (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 578,
the Second District affirmed dismissal of a plaintiff police union’s mandamus
claim where the terms of the parties’ “collective bargaining agreement” failed
to show a clear “official duty” to provide plaintiff’s requested salary
adjustments.  Id. at 590.
            In Crestwood Behav.
Health, Inc. v. Baass, (“Crestwood”) (2023) 91 Cal. App. 5th 1, 18-19,
the appellate court affirmed the denial of a mandamus claim where the
plaintiff’s cited statute “does not prescribe any ‘act’ the Department must
take” or any “ministerial duty on the Department’s part to act in a particular
way[.]”  Mot. at 12-13.
            The court in Bull
Field, LLC v. Merced Irrigation Dist., (“Bull Field”) (2022) 85 Cal.
App. 5th 442, 455, similarly affirmed the dismissal of a mandamus petition
where the applicable statute “cannot reasonably be interpreted to impose a
mandatory duty on the District” under plaintiff’s proposed theory.  Mot. at 13.
            In Asante v.
California Dep't of Health Care Servs., (“Asante”) (N.D. Cal. Apr. 12,
2016) 2016 WL 1427495, at *1, a plaintiff filed a mandamus claim challenging
the respondent agency’s disbursement of “payments to out-of-state hospitals” on
grounds that such payments violated its constitutional duties.  The court noted that plaintiff’s “calculation
of damages . . . was subject to extensive debate” and that “[u]nlike in writ of
mandate cases [], th[is] court must undertake a close and somewhat complex
analysis that involves judgment” as to “the clarity of the duty breached . . . rather
than a simple ministerial determination.” 
Id. at *4-5. Such complexity meant “there is no clear,
ministerial duty in this case, [and] Plaintiffs cannot rely on writ of mandate
under § 1085 to recover retroactive damages.” Id. at *6. Just as Asante
held that complex determinations of fact and law precluded relief by
mandamus, so too should the court dismiss LAPPL’s mandamus claim.  Mot. at 13.
            None of these cases
involved a public agency’s ministerial duty to pay retroactive benefits.  In City of Pomona, the petitioner
sought mandamus to compel the city to amend its contract with PERS to validate
a retirement conversion option or otherwise cause the retirement allowance of
the union’s members to be increased by the agreed upon amount in the MOU.  58 Cal.App.4th at 583.  The court found that that city did not have a
duty to implement the MOU provision regarding conversion of employer-paid employee
retirement contributions to salary after the date that the city discovered that
the MOU’s retirement conversion option violated the Public Employees’
Retirement Law.  Id. at
589-90.  
            In Crestwood the
court concluded that the Department of Health Care Services had no ministerial
duty under Welf. & Inst. Code to include unaudited special treatment
program days in Skilled Nursing Facility Quality and Accountability
Supplemental Payment System calculations. 

            In the present case, it
is undisputed that the City had a ministerial duty to pay the salary and
incentive increases and there is no claim of illegality which would excuse the
City from performing its contractual MOU obligation to do so.  
            LAPPL distinguishes Bull
Field and Asante as not involving mandate to compel a public
employer to implement a MOU provision with a union.  Opp. at 17. 
More important and unlike Bull Field and Asante, the
City’s ministerial duty to make retroactive payments is clear and undisputed;
the only issue is pre-judgment interest. 
Neither Bull Field nor Asante addressed the issue of
pre-judgment interest where there was a ministerial duty to make retroactive
payments.[1]
            LAPPL may use mandamus
to enforce the City’s ministerial duty to pay the salary and incentive
increases, and pre-judgment interest.
 
            3. Double Recovery
                The City argues
that LAPPL’s demand for pre-judgment interest contravenes basic due process
principles.  An award of prejudgment
interest would constitute a double recovery because the December 27, 2024 wage
disbursements to LAPPL’s members were calculated based on a retroactive date of
July 16, 2024.  Given that LAPPL’s
members already received the benefit of their contractual bargain, an award of
interest would place them in a position superior to what was promised under the
MOU.  Mot. at 14-15.
            Under Civil Code section 3358 “no
person can recover a greater amount in damages for the breach of an obligation,
than he could have gained by the full performance thereof on both sides.” This
is because “the breaching party is only responsible to give the nonbreaching
party the benefit of the bargain to the extent the specific breach deprived
that party of its bargain.” Postal Instant Press v. Sealy, (1996) 43
Cal. App. 4th 1704, 1709 (citations omitted). 
The MOU promised LAPPL’s members an increase in wages to be calculated
with an effective date of July 16, 2024. 
Any award of pre-judgment interest violates basic contract and due
process principles because it would award LAPPL’s 8,909 members a recovery
greater than the City promised in the MOU. 
Mot. at 15.
            Courts have denied pre-judgment
interest in similar contexts where the award would constitute excess or
duplicative recovery.  See Lewis
Jorge Constr. Mgmt., Inc. v. Pomona Unified Sch. Dist., (2004) 34 Cal. 4th
960, 973 (reversing award of pre-judgment interest because “[f]ull performance
by the District would have provided Lewis Jorge with full payment of the
contract price.”); Burnett & Doty Dev. Co. v. Phillips, (1978) 84
Cal. App. 3d 384, 391 (affirming denial of pre-judgment interest based on
“offset” and denying claim for costs because “[t]o award the plaintiff not only
lost profit but also the cost of producing the profit causes a double
recovery.”) (citations omitted).  The
City argues that the same logic applies here. 
This is particularly true given the LAPPL is required to elect one
remedy—either specific performance through mandamus, or damages on its contract
claim. See Darbun
Enterprises, Inc. v. San Fernando Cmty. Hosp., (2015) 239 Cal. App. 4th 399, 409 (“A plaintiff may seek specific performance,
an equitable remedy, as an alternative to damages, but a plaintiff may not
receive both for breach of contract to the extent such an award would
constitute a double recovery.”).  Mot.
at 15-16.
            The court agrees with LAPPL (Opp. at
18) that this argument ignores the purpose of pre-judgment interest, which is to compensate the plaintiff for the loss
of use of his or her property.  Lewis
C. Nelson & Sons, Inc. v. Clovis Unified School Dist., (2001) 90
Cal.App.4th 64, 71–72.  The award of
pre-judgment interest compensates LAPPL’s represented employees for the loss of
use of the unpaid salary increases commencing from the contractually agreed
effective date of July 16, 2023 until the December 27, 2023 date on which the
retroactive salary increases were paid. 
The award of pre-judgment interest does not place these employees in a
position superior to that promised in the MOU and only makes them whole.  As LAPPL argues, the City’s position would
permit it to delay payment indefinitely without remedy.  When finally compelled to pay the back wages
owed, it then would owe nothing beyond back pay.  That position is not consistent with the
parties’ intent in the MOU or the law.
 
            4. Mootness
            If the evidence demonstrates the
respondent’s willingness to perform without coercion, a writ of mandate may be
denied as unnecessary, and if the respondent shows actual compliance, the
proceeding will be dismissed as moot.  No
purpose would be served in directing the [respondent] to do what has already
been done.” TransparentGov Novato v. City of Novato, (2019) 34 Cal. App.
5th 140, 147. 
            The City notes that paid $25 million
in increases wages in accordance with the MOU on December 27, 2024.  JSF ¶11; Quach Decl., ¶8.  The City argues that the Petition is both unnecessary
and moot. It is unnecessary because there are no facts showing that the City
ever refused to disburse the increased salary payments without coercion.  The Petition concedes as much as the incorporated exhibits show the City acknowledged its “responsibility to
implement the new contract terms” requiring increased wage payments.  JSF ¶ 10; Pet. ¶¶ 13-14, Ex. C (“The CAO . .
. [and Controller] have moved as quickly as possible to accomplish the
objective of successfully implementing the updated and new terms and conditions
in MOU 24 with little to no errors so as to avoid further consternation of your
members.”).  The City provides additional
facts that dozens of City employees and consultants worked to implement the
wage increases in the MOU.  Quach Decl.,
¶¶ 2-8.  The mandamus claim is
unnecessary because the facts reflect a willingness to perform without
coercion.  The Petition is also moot
given the City “issued a [retroactive] payment of $25,798,226.56 to all 8,909
LAPD employees and LAPPL union-members” based on the MOU’s effective date of
“July 16, 2023. JSF ¶¶ 11-12; Quach Decl., ¶8. 
This moots the LAPPL’s central mandamus remedy of the payment of
“represented employees increases of wages.” 
Pet. ¶24.  Mot. at 16-17.
            LAPPL presents the history of the
parties’ communications.  Following the City Council’s August 23, 2023
adoption of the MOU, LAPPL contacted the office of the City Administrative
Officer and City Controller to inquire when the City would be implementing the
compensation increases.  JSF ¶7.  On September 29, 2023, LAPPL made a final
written demand as to the date by which its represented employees would receive
their compensation increases due under the MOU. 
JSF ¶ 8; Pet., Ex. B.  On October
3, 2023, the City Administrative Officer and City Controller advised LAPPL by
letter that “[t]he City recognizes the responsibility to implement the new
contract terms and retroactive adjustments as quickly as possible. The
Controller and the CAO are in close coordination and believe that we should be
able to implement the new MOU successfully starting with the pay period
commencing October 22, 2023”.  JSF ¶10;
Pet. ¶13, Ex. C.  Opp. at 13.
            On November 9, 2023,
after there still was no disbursement of the required retroactive
salary/benefit increases, LAPPL filed the Petition.  LAPPL served the City on November 14, 2023
and served the Controller on December 8, 2023. 
Levine Decl., Ex.2.  The City
failed to pay to the contractually required retroactive salary increases and
new special incentives/pays until December 27, 2023.  JSF ¶ 11. 
Opp. at 13.
            LAPPL argues that,
irrespective of any complexity claimed by the City in timely disbursing the
contractually required retroactive salary increases and new special incentives,
and notwithstanding the City eventual payment of retroactive salary increases
five months after the contractually agreed effective date of such increases,
the court remains vested with jurisdiction to award pre-judgment interest
commencing July 16, 2023 until the City’s date of payment of such salary
increases on December 27, 2023.  Opp. at
13-14.
            The case is not
moot.  The City’s $25 million
disbursement of wage increases on December 27, 2023 mooted only part of the
Petition.  The Petition seeks mandamus to
compel the City to pay the required retroactive salary/benefit increases and
pre-judgment interest.  Pet., ¶¶
20-21.  Opp. at 14.
 
            E. Conclusion
            The City’s motion for judgment under CCP section 1094 is denied.
