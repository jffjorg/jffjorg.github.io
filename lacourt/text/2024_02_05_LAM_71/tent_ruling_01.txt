Request for Judicial Notice
Defendants’ 10/5/23 request for judicial notice of the 8/23/23
Minute Order in LASC Case No. 18STCV05596, Alvarez et al. v. Ruskin et al.,
is granted.  (D-RJN, Exh. A.)
 
Background
Plaintiff filed his initial Complaint on May 1, 2023.  Plaintiff filed the operative FAC on June 22,
2023, against Defendants alleging two causes of action: (1) professional
negligence- legal malpractice; and (2) breach of fiduciary duty.
Plaintiff alleges on or about November 26, 2016,
he and Defendants entered into an attorney client retainer agreement contract
and Defendants agreed to represent Plaintiff for personal injuries received in
an auto accident that occurred November 26, 2016.  (FAC ¶4.)  Plaintiff alleges Defendants also represented
two other people, Jose Luiz Flores (“Flores”) and Miguel Carmona (“Carmona”),
who were also passengers injured in the same vehicle that Plaintiff was injured
in.  (FAC ¶4.)
Plaintiff alleges on November 26, 2016, he was severely injured as
a passenger by Jorge Favela (“Favela”), a driver who was under the influence of
alcohol at the time of the crash.  (FAC
¶5.)  Plaintiff alleges Favela left
the scene of the accident and hid from the police.  (FAC ¶5.) 
Plaintiff alleges he accompanied the police to Favela’s home
and on the way, the police found Favela and arrested him for DUI.  (FAC ¶5.)  Plaintiff alleges Favela was convicted of
DUI.  (FAC ¶5.)  Plaintiff alleges Aaron Ruskin
(“Ruskin”) was the owner of the vehicle who consented to Favela driving the
vehicle and using the vehicle that injured Plaintiff.  (FAC ¶5.)  
Plaintiff alleges Defendants
represented Plaintiff, Flores, and Carmona in a lawsuit against Favela and
Ruskin in LASC Case No. 18STCV05596.  (FAC
¶6.)  Plaintiff alleges he has
a meritorious case against Favela and Ruskin because he was severely injured
and has incurred $267,416.46 in medical bills and future medical costs for knee
surgery rehabilitation and rehabilitation of $150,000.00 for total medical
damages of $417,416.46.  (FAC ¶7.)  
Plaintiff alleges prior to May 19, 2022, Plaintiff substituted
Behrouz Shafie in place of Defendants in his lawsuit against Favela and Ruskin,
and as of May 19, 2022, Plaintiff was no longer represented by Defendants.  (FAC ¶¶8-9.) 
Plaintiff alleges on May 19, 2022, Koshkaryan signed and filed a request
for dismissal to dismiss the entire action. 
(FAC ¶10, Exh. 1.)
On October 5, 2023, Defendants filed the instant demurrer.  On December 26, 2023, Plaintiff filed his
opposition.  As of the date of this
hearing no reply has been filed.
 
Summary of Demurrer
Defendants demur to Plaintiff’s 1st and 2nd causes of action on
the basis they fail to state facts sufficient to constitute causes of action.  (Demurrer, pg. 2; C.C.P. §430.10(e).)
 
          Meet and Confer
Before filing a demurrer pursuant to this chapter, the demurring
party shall meet and confer in person or by telephone with the party who
filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the purpose of determining
whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the objections to be
raised in the demurrer.  (C.C.P.
§430.41(a), emphasis added.)  A
declaration must be filed with a demurrer regarding the results of the meet and
confer process.  (C.C.P. §430.41(a)(3).)
Defendant Saroian’s declaration states that on June 21, 2023, he
sent a meet and confer correspondence to Plaintiff’s counsel via email pointing
out the legal deficiencies in Plaintiff’s operative complaint.  (Decl. of Saroian ¶7.)  Defendant Saroian
declares he sent one final email on September 21, 2023, requesting Plaintiff
dismiss the FAC on the basis that his causes of action were no longer viable.  (Decl. of Saroian ¶7.)  Saroian’s declaration is insufficient under C.C.P.
§430.41(a)(3) because he does not indicate parties met and conferred in person
or by telephone, as required by the statute. 
However, failure to sufficiently meet and confer is not grounds to
overrule or sustain a demurrer.  (C.C.P.
§430.41(a)(4).)  Accordingly, the Court
will consider the instant demurrer.

 
Legal Standard
“[A] demurrer tests the legal
sufficiency of the allegations in a complaint.” (Lewis v. Safeway, Inc.
(2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 385, 388.)  A
demurrer can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the
pleading under attack or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially
noticeable.  (See Donabedian v.
Mercury Insurance Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994 [in ruling on a
demurrer, a court may not consider declarations, matters not subject to
judicial notice, or documents not accepted for the truth of their
contents].)  For purposes of ruling on a
demurrer, all facts pleaded in a complaint are assumed to be true, but the
reviewing court does not assume the truth of conclusions of law.  (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital District
(1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 967.)
 
Failure to State a Claim
Professional
Negligence- Legal Malpractice & Breach of Fiduciary Duty (1st & 2nd COAs)
“The elements of a cause of action in tort for professional
negligence are (1) the duty of the professional to use such skill, prudence,
and diligence as other members of his profession commonly possess and exercise;
(2) a breach of that duty; (3) a proximate causal connection between the
negligent conduct and the resulting injury; and (4) actual loss or damage
resulting from the professional’s negligence.”  (Budd v. Nixen (1971) 6 Cal.3d 195,
200.)  “[I]f the allegedly negligent
conduct does not cause damage, it generates no cause of action in tort.” (Moua
v. Pittullo, Howington, Barker, Abernathy, LLP (2014) 228 Cal.App.4th 107,
112-113.)
“‘The breach of fiduciary duty can be based upon either negligence
or fraud depending on the circumstances. It has been referred to as a species
of tort distinct from causes of action for professional negligence [citation]
and from fraud [citation].’ ‘The elements of a cause of action for breach of
fiduciary duty are the existence of a fiduciary relationship, breach of
fiduciary duty, and damages.’”  (Knutson
v. Foster (2018) 25 Cal.App.5th 1075, 1093-1094, internal citations
omitted.)
          Plaintiff alleges
Defendants negligently rendered legal services because, without Plaintiff’s
knowledge or consent and without any authority, Defendants dismissed
Plaintiff’s personal injury case.  (FAC
¶22.)  Plaintiff alleges he has lost the
opportunity to recover on his meritorious case against Favela and Ruskin as
Plaintiff was severely injured and has incurred $267,416.46 in medical bills
and future medical costs for knee surgery rehabilitation of $150,000.00 for
total medical damages of $417,416.46 and $1,000,000 in pain and suffering.  (FAC ¶23.)
          Plaintiff alleges
Defendants failed to file a valid motion to set aside judgment based upon
attorney excusable neglect.  (FAC
¶24.)  Plaintiff alleges Defendants
failed to properly prosecute an appeal to preserve Plaintiff’s claims.  (FAC ¶25.) 
Plaintiff alleges Defendants failed to exercise reasonable care and
skill in conducting the post dismissal motion to set aside and file and appeal,
which would have been sufficient to reinstate Plaintiff’s case.  (FAC ¶26.) 
Plaintiff alleges Defendants failed to exercise reasonable care and
skill in conducting the post dismissal motion to set aside and appeal, and
neglected to present available evidence that was competent and relevant to the
issues therein, and that the additional evidence, together with other evidence
presented would have been sufficient to prove Plaintiff’s cause of action for
the applicable burden of proof.  (FAC ¶27.)
          Plaintiff alleges
on information and belief that had such evidence been presented to the Court by
Defendants, set aside the dismissal, and filed an appeal, Plaintiff would have
been awarded a judgment.  (FAC ¶28.)
          Plaintiff alleges
Defendants and Plaintiff were in an attorney-client relationship and Plaintiff
was in a vulnerable fragile condition and was unable to understand the
proceedings.  (FAC ¶¶37-38.)  Plaintiff alleges Defendant knew of
Plaintiff’s disability and took advantage of Plaintiff.  (FAC ¶38.) 
Plaintiff alleges by virtue of the attorney-client relationship that
existed between Defendants and Plaintiff, and by virtue of Plaintiff having
placed confidence in the fidelity and integrity of Defendants and in entrusting
Defendants with representation of his personal injury case, and a confidential
relationship existed at all times herein mentioned between Plaintiff and
Defendants, Defendants owed to Plaintiff a fiduciary duty even after the
attorney-client relationship was terminated. 
(FAC ¶39.)

          Plaintiff alleges despite
having voluntarily accepted the trust and confidence of Plaintiff with regard to
Defendants’ representation of the Plaintiff before discharge of their
employment by Plaintiff, and in violation of this relationship of trust and
confidence, Defendants abused the trust and confidence of Plaintiff during the
attorney-client relationship by dismissing the Plaintiff’s case without his
consent.  (FAC ¶40.)  Plaintiff alleges that Defendants would benefit
and collect their attorneys’ fees on the co-plaintiffs’ case and put Defendants’
interests ahead of the interests of Plaintiff in this case.  (FAC ¶41.) Plaintiff
alleges Defendants did this just so they would be paid their
attorneys’ fees due from Plaintiff in complete disregard of the fact that
Defendants were no longer the Plaintiff’s attorney.  (FAC ¶41.) 
Plaintiff alleges Defendants failed to advise him of the conflict of
interest and the severe damage it would cause and did cause to Plaintiff.  (FAC ¶41.) 
Plaintiff alleges because of Defendant’ breach of fiduciary duties
to him, Defendants were paid more than $150,000.00 in attorneys’ fees and the
Plaintiff received no money.  (FAC ¶42.)
Plaintiff filed a motion to set aside and vacate the May 2022
dismissal in the underlying case, which was heard on August 23, 2023, and
granted in full, restoring the underlying case to active status.  (D-RJN, Exh. A.)  Because Plaintiff’s underlying case is
allowed to go forward, he can no longer allege damages he sustained from
Defendants’ conduct.  (Moua, 228
Cal.App.4th at pgs. 112-113.)
Plaintiff argues he should be granted leave to amend his damages
based on the legal fees incurred in correcting Defendants’ erroneous dismissal
of Plaintiff’s case and the upset, worry, and emotional distress he felt for a
year when his case was dismissed.  The
Court agrees.
Defendants’ demurrer to Plaintiff’s 1st and 2nd causes of action
is sustained with 20 days leave to amend.
 
Conclusion
Defendants’ demurrer to Plaintiffs’ 1st and 2nd causes of action
is sustained with 20 days leave to amend. 
Moving Party to give notice.
