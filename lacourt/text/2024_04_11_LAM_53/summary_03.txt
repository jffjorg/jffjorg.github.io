And here is a summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is regarding a motion by John Andrew Wright, the counsel for defendants Mark Lovequist and LTPW Developers, LLC, to be relieved as their counsel. The court's discussion is based on the papers filed by John Andrew Wright, which include a motion to be relieved as counsel for defendant Mark Lovequist and a separate motion for defendant LTPW Developers, LLC. The court finds that John Andrew Wright has shown sufficient reasons why the motions should be granted, but notes that he failed to serve the moving papers on all other parties who have appeared in the case, including the plaintiff Sarah Lulloff. The court therefore exercises its discretion to continue the hearing on the motions to be relieved as counsel to May 15, 2024, and orders John Andrew Wright to serve a notice of the ruling on all parties and to file a proof of service with the court.
