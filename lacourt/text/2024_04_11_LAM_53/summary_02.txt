And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the hearing on the defendant City of Los Angeles's motion to strike paragraphs 119, 122, and 142 of the Fourth Amended Complaint will be continued to May 6, 2024. The judge has also allowed the defendant to file an amended reply brief by April 29, 2024. The judge's decision comes after the plaintiffs failed to file their opposition papers within the required time frame, citing a mistake in understanding the court's earlier continuance of the hearing. The judge has given the parties an opportunity to file and serve their opposition and reply briefs, respectively, before the continued hearing date.
