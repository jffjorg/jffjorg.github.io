  Order RE:
 
defendant’s motion to reclassify case to
  limited jurisdiction
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Defendant Josefina Campos (sued
as Doe 1)
 
RESPONDING PARTY:        Plaintiff Angela Rios Miranda
Motion to Reclassify Case to Limited Jurisdiction
The court
considered the moving and non-opposition papers filed in connection with this
motion.  No reply papers were filed.
DISCUSSION
Defendant Josefina Campos (“Defendant”) moves the court for an order reclassifying
this action, filed by plaintiff Angela Rios Miranda (“Plaintiff”), as a limited
civil case. 
“If a party files a motion for reclassification after the time for
that party . . . to respond to a complaint, cross-complaint, or other initial
pleading, the court shall grant the motion and enter an order for
reclassification only if both the following conditions are satisfied: [¶] (1)
The case is incorrectly classified[, and] [¶] (2) The moving party shows good
cause for not seeking reclassification earlier.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 403.040, subd. (b).)
 “A party seeking to reclassify a case
from unlimited to limited faces a ‘high threshold.’  [Citation.] 
The trial court must conclude ‘that the verdict will “necessarily” fall
short of the superior court jurisdictional requirement of a claim exceeding
$25,000.’  [Citation.]”  (Hiona v. Superior Court of City and
County of San Francisco (2020) 48 Cal.App.5th 866, 872; Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 85, subd. (a) [a limited civil case is one in which the amount of
controversy does not exceed $35,000].) 
The court finds that Defendant (1) has not shown that Plaintiff’s
action is incorrectly classified, and (2) has not addressed the requirement establishing
“good cause for not seeking reclassification earlier.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 403.040, subd. (b).)
 The court therefore denies Defendant’s
motion.  (Ibid.) 
First, the court finds that Defendant has not shown that Corporations
Code section 17707.07 limits Plaintiff’s recovery to an amount below the
jurisdictional limit. 
“In general, members of a limited liability company are not liable for
the ‘debts, obligations, or other liabilities of the limited liability
company.  [Citations.]”  (CB Richard Ellis, Inc. v. Terra Nostra
Consultants (2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 405, 411.)  However, under section 17707.07, “[c]auses of
action against a dissolved limited liability company . . . may be enforced
against any of the following: [¶¶]  (B)
If any of the assets of the dissolved limited liability company have been
distributed to members, against members of the dissolved limited liability
company to the extent of the limited liability company assets distributed to
them upon dissolution of the limited liability company.”  (Corp. Code, § 17707.07, subd. (a)(1)(B).) 
Here, Plaintiff has not alleged her remaining causes of action against
Defendant based on her claims against the dissolved limited liability company
WVP Precious Metals, LLC.  Instead,
Plaintiff (1) has alleged that Defendant (sued and identified as Doe 1 on
November 9, 2022) was Plaintiff’s employer, joint employer, and/or special
employer (Compl., ¶¶ 5-6, 15), and (2) has therefore alleged her causes of
action against Defendant separately, as Plaintiff’s employer (Compl.,
¶¶ 99-100, 106, 114-115, 123-124, 130, 132, 139, 141, 145).  Thus, Corporations Code section 17707.07,
which governs “[c]auses of action against a dissolved limited liability company,”
does not apply to the causes of action alleged by Plaintiff against Defendant
and therefore does not limit Plaintiff’s recovery to the $5,545 in
distributions received by Defendant upon dissolution of WVP Precious Metals,
LLC.  (Campos Decl., ¶ 4.)
Second, the court finds that Defendant has not shown that all of
Plaintiff’s remaining causes of action plead damages less than the
jurisdictional amount. 
While Defendant contends that “the claims which will remain after this
Court grants judgment on the pleadings on the 7th Cause of Action for Wrongful
Termination in Violation of Public Policy plead damages of no more than
$9,338.17[,]” the court has not yet ruled on Defendant’s motion for judgment on
the pleadings.  Thus, the seventh cause
of action for wrongful termination remains pending against Defendant.  However, Defendant has not shown that a
verdict in favor of Plaintiff on the seventh through 13th causes of action
“‘will “necessarily”’” fall short of the jurisdictional requirement.  (Mot., p. 7:16-18 [“this case must be
reclassified to limited jurisdiction because the amount in controversy in the 8th
through 13th Causes of Action is far below the jurisdictional limit”]
[emphasis added]; Hiona, supra, 48 Cal.App.5th at p. 872.) 
Third, even if Defendant had shown that this case is incorrectly
classified, Defendant did not set forth argument establishing “good cause for
not seeking reclassification earlier[,]” therefore requiring denial of this
motion.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 403.040, subds. (b), (b)(2) [“the court shall grant the motion and enter
an order for reclassification only if both” statutory conditions,
including good cause for not seeking reclassification earlier, are satisfied]
[emphasis added].) 
ORDER
            The court denies defendant Josefina Campos’s
motion to reclassify case to limited jurisdiction.
            The court orders plaintiff Angela
Rios Miranda to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
