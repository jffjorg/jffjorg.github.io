Here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The defendant, Josefina Campos, has moved the court to reclassify the case to limited jurisdiction. However, the court finds that the defendant has not shown that the case is incorrectly classified and has not addressed the requirement establishing "good cause for not seeking reclassification earlier." The court also finds that the defendant has not shown that the amount of controversy in the case is limited to an amount below the jurisdictional limit. Therefore, the court denies the defendant's motion.
