MOVING PARTY:                 Defendant City of Los Angeles          
 
RESPONDING PARTIES:    Plaintiffs Alejandra Garcia, Chance Brown,
Stephen Thompson, Erick Herrera, Diana Salazar, Christopher Pearl, Brandon
Gaviria, Amanda Flores, Osvaldo Perez, Mark Escalante, Katherine Gerbasi,
Danyelle Leah Sims, Kevin Jesus Ruiz, Elver Hernandez, Paris Washington, Aaron

Motion to Strike Paragraphs 119, 122, and 142 of Fourth Amended
Complaint
On November 30, 2023, defendant
City of Los Angeles (“Defendant”) filed the pending motion to strike paragraphs
119, 122, and 142 of the Fourth Amended Complaint filed by plaintiffs Alejandra
Garcia, Chance Brown, Stephen Thompson, Erick Herrera, Diana Salazar,
Christopher Pearl, Brandon Gaviria, Amanda Flores, Osvaldo Perez, Mark
Escalante, Katherine Gerbasi, Danyelle Leah Sims, Kevin Jesus Ruiz, Elver
Hernandez, Paris Washington, Aaron Walker Matis, Lacramiora Muntean, Kent
Villa, Jasmin Rincon, Elizabeth Tooley, Alicia Reyna, Samantha De Leon, Morgan
Fangue, Leslye Alaniz, Katherine Gray, Katelynn Rhoads, and Grace Evelyn
Bowland (“Plaintiffs”).  
Plaintiffs filed with the court and served on Defendant their
opposition papers on April 5, 2024, i.e., four court days before the hearing on
Defendant’s motion in violation of Code of Civil Procedure section 1005,
subdivision (b).  Plaintiffs have
submitted the declaration of their counsel, in which counsel states that
counsel mistakenly understood the court’s earlier continuance of the hearing on
defendant County of Los Angeles’s demurrer to be a continuance of the hearing
on Defendant’s pending motion to strike. 
(Eaton Decl., ¶¶ 4, 7.)  Thus, Plaintiffs
did not prepare, file, and serve an opposition within the time required by
section 1005.  (Ibid.) 
The court exercises its discretion to continue the hearing on
Defendant’s motion to strike so that (1) the court has an opportunity to
consider the opposition papers filed by Plaintiffs, and (2) Defendant has an
opportunity to file an amended reply brief that addresses the merits of
Plaintiffs’ opposition. 
ORDER
            The court orders that the hearing on
defendant City of Los Angeles’s motion to strike paragraphs 119, 122, and 142
is continued to May 6, 2024, at 10:00 a.m., in Department 53. 
            The court orders that defendant City
of Los Angeles may file an amended reply in support of its motion to strike no
later than April 29, 2024.
            The court orders defendant City of
Los Angeles to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
DATED:  April 11, 2024
