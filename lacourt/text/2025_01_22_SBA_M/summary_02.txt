And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiffs' motion to compel arbitration, selection of arbitrator, and schedule a return date. The judge found that the defendant, Interinsurance Exchange of the Automobile Club (AAA), does not refuse to arbitrate the controversy, as AAA has agreed to arbitrate the matter. The judge also noted that the plaintiffs' motion did not follow the proper procedure for selecting an arbitrator, as set forth in California Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.6. The judge encourages the parties to meet and confer to come to an agreement on the name of the arbitrator and to avoid the need for a subsequent petition or motion to appoint an arbitrator.
