**English Summary:**


The judge has denied the attorney's motion to withdraw from the case without prejudice, meaning the attorney can re-file the motion if necessary. This denial is due to the attorney not properly serving the motion on the defendant. The judge has also continued the hearing on the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment. This continuation is due to the plaintiff's failure to adequately address applicable federal and Utah law, as well as their incomplete Separate Statement.


The judge wants the plaintiff to provide a revised Separate Statement that meets the court's requirements and address the applicable law governing the case. The defendant will have a chance to respond to the revised arguments before the case proceeds to a final decision.
