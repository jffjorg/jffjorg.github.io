Moving
Party:             Defendant
Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC
Responding
Party:       Plaintiff Wala Ali Khalaf
 
 
RELIEF REQUESTED:
 
            Defendant
Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC moves for summary judgment on the ground that there are
no triable issues of material fact to support any of Plaintiff’s causes of
actions because Plaintiff did not receive a new warranty in connection with the
sale of the subject vehicle. 
 
BACKGROUND:
 
Plaintiff, Wala Ali Khalaf
(“Plaintiff”) initiated this action on July 26, 2022 against Defendant
Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC (“Defendant”). Following the Court’s ruling on
Defendant’s motion for judgment on the pleading, Plaintiff filed the operative
First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) alleging three causes of action: (1) Violation
of Song-Beverly Act – Breach of Express Warranty, (2) Violation of Song-Beverly
Act – Breach of Implied Warranty, and (3) Violation of the Song-Beverly Act
Section 1793.2 The instant action surrounds allegations pertaining to a 2021
Mercedes-Benz GLB250W that Plaintiff leased on March 27, 2021.
 
On July 12, 2023, Defendant filed
the instant motion for summary judgment.
 
TENTATIVE
RULING:
 
            Defendant’s
motion for summary judgment is continued to November 17, 2023. Trial is
continued from November 13, 2023 to December 18, 2023.
 
ANALYSIS:
 
Legal Standard
 
“Code of Civil Procedure § 437c,
subdivision (c), requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment if all the
evidence submitted, and all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence
and uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that there is no
triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to
judgment as a matter of law.”  (Adler
v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal. App. 4th 1110, 1119.)  “[A] party may not defeat summary judgment by
means of declarations or affidavits which contradict that party’s deposition
testimony or sworn discovery responses.” 
(Minish v. Hanuman Fellowship (2013) 214 Cal.App.4th 437, 459;
see also D’Amico v. Board of Medical Examiners (1974) 11 Cal.3d 1, 25.)
A plaintiff cannot “rely upon the allegations or denials of its pleadings to
show that a triable issue of material fact exists.”  (Code Civ. Proc. § 437c(p)(2).)  
 
“[T]he party moving for summary
judgment bears the burden of persuasion that there is no triable issue of
material fact and that he or she is entitled to judgment as a matter of
law.”  (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield
Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 828.) 
Once the moving party has met its burden, the burden then shifts to the
non-moving party to show that there is a triable issue as to any material
fact.  (Id. at 849.)  With respect to a motion for summary judgment
“the moving party’s affidavits are strictly construed while those of the
opposing party are liberally construed.” 
(Walker v. Blue Cross of California (1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 985,
990.) With respect to a motion for summary judgment “if it is not set forth in
the separate statement, it does not exist.” 
(San Diego Watercrafts, Inc. v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2002) 102
Cal.App.4th 308, 313.)  
 
Discussion
 
            In lieu of
a formal opposition, Plaintiff requests the Court to continue the instant
motion pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 437c(h). 
 
Here, Plaintiff’s counsel attests
that additional discovery is needed regarding the subject vehicle’s prior
commercial ownership history as well as Defendant’s policies and procedures for
use, maintenance, and warranty start date entries and recordings for MBUSA
dealer-owned service loaner. . . .” (Serrano Decl. ¶ 18.) 
 
Plaintiff’s counsel suspects that
this evidence would show that Defendant is not in compliance with its own
policies. (Ibid.) Thus, it is asserted that Plaintiff was the first
retail purchaser of the subject vehicle, and as a result, the warranty period
started at the time of Plaintiff’s purchase. (Id. at ¶ 17.) 
 
Plaintiff’s counsel states that Defendant
has not complied yet with the Court’s August 4, 2023 Minute Order to provide
further verified responses and response documents regarding Defendant’s
internal warranty policies and procedures, which would be necessary to support
Plaintiff’s opposition. (Id. at ¶¶ 23-28.) 
 
Additionally, Plaintiff’s counsel seeks
to depose Defendant’s person most knowledgeable on the topics of the subject
vehicle’s prior commercial ownership history, MBUSA’s warranty administration,
policies, and procedures for use, maintenance, recording, and entry for
warranty start dates for “dealer-owned” service loaner vehicles.” (Id.
at ¶¶ 22, 37.)
 
Under the circumstances, the Court
finds it appropriate to continue the hearing on Defendant’s motion for summary
judgment because Plaintiff’s counsel’s affidavit supports “that facts essential
to justify opposition may exist but cannot. . . be presented” at this time due
to Defendant’s delay in complying with the Court’s August 4, 2023 Minute Order
as well as Plaintiff’s need to depose Defendant’s PMK. (Code Civ. Proc. §
437c(h).) Without this continuance, it appears Plaintiff would be unduly
prejudiced.
 
            Defendant’s
motion for summary judgment is continued to November 17, 2023. Trial is
continued from November 13, 2023 to December 18, 2023. Plaintiff’s request for
sanctions pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 128.5(a) are not considered
because proper notice has not been provided and the safe-harbor provision has
not been followed. (Code Civ. Proc. § 128.5(f).)
