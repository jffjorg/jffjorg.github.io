And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in response to the Defendant's motion for summary judgment. The motion was filed on July 12, 2023, and the hearing was scheduled for October 12, 2023. The Defendant is seeking summary judgment, arguing that there are no triable issues of material fact to support the Plaintiff's causes of action. The Plaintiff, Wala Ali Khalaf, is seeking to establish a triable issue of material fact, claiming that the Defendant did not provide a new warranty in connection with the sale of the subject vehicle.

The Judge has continued the hearing on the Defendant's motion for summary judgment to November 17, 2023, and has also continued the trial from November 13, 2023 to December 18, 2023. The Judge has denied the Plaintiff's request for sanctions, citing lack of proper notice and failure to follow the safe-harbor provision.

The Judge has concluded that the Plaintiff's counsel has presented sufficient evidence to support the need for additional discovery, including the subject vehicle's prior commercial ownership history and the Defendant's policies and procedures. The Judge has also noted that the Defendant has not complied with the Court's August 4, 2023 Minute Order to provide further verified responses and response documents regarding its internal warranty policies and procedures.
