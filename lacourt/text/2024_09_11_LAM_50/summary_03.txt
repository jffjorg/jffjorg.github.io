Judge Beaudet discloses her personal experience with a pickup truck that developed electrical problems 24 years ago. She and her husband purchased the truck, which was eventually taken back and refunded by the manufacturer and dealer. Judge Beaudet does not believe this experience will affect her impartiality, but if any party disagrees, they may file and serve a verified statement of disqualification by October 8, 2024. The case management conference is continued to November 14, 2024, unless both parties waive their right to file the statement. The plaintiff is ordered to notify any new parties of this disclosure and file proof of service.
