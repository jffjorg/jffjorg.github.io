BACKGROUND Plaintiff Jade Carrasco, by and through her Guardian Ad Litem Jesse Ronald Carrasco, (“Plaintiff Carrasco”) propounded set one of form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and request for production of documents on defendant Becky Radgowski (“Defendant Becky”) on December 27, 2023. To date, Defendant Becky has not served responses. Plaintiff Carrasco therefore seeks an order compelling Defendant Becky to respond, without objections, to the outstanding discovery and to pay sanctions.  Defendant Becky is in pro per. As of April 23, 2024, no opposition has been filed.  II. MOTIONS TO COMPEL Legal Standard  For a motion to compel initial discovery responses, all a propounding party must show is that it properly served its discovery requests, that the time to respond has expired, and that the party to whom the requests were directed failed to provide a timely response. (See Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902, 905 906.) Where a party fails to serve timely responses to discovery requests, the court may make an order compelling responses. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, 2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.) A party that fails to serve timely responses waives any objections to the request, including ones based on privilege or the protection of attorney work product. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (a), 2031.300, subd. (a).)  Discussion & Conclusion  Therefore, because the evidence shows Defendant Becky was properly served with discovery and failed to timely respond, any objections have been waived. Plaintiff Carrasco’s motions are GRANTED.  Defendant Becky is ordered to serve verified responses to Plaintiff’s Carrasco’s (1) form interrogatories, set one, (2) special interrogatories, set one, and (2) request for production of documents, set one, without objections, within thirty (30) days. (CCP §§ 2030.290(a),(b), 2031.300(a),(b).)  III. MOTIONS TO DEEM REQUEST FOR ADMISSIONS ADMITTED Legal Standard Where there has been no timely response to a request for admission under CCP § 2033.010, the propounding party may move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction. (Code of Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).)  The party who failed to respond waives any objections to the demand, unless the court grants that party relief from the waiver, upon a showing that the party (1) has subsequently served a substantially compliant response, and (2) that the party’s failure to respond was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. (Code of Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subds. (a)(1)-(2).) The court “shall” grant a motion to deem admitted requests for admissions, “unless it finds that the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.” (Code of Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).) Discussion & Conclusion The evidence demonstrates that Plaintiff Carrasco served her requests for admission, set one, on Defendant Becky on December 27, 2023. Plaintiff Carrasco avers that no responses have been provided to date. Defendant Becky has not filed any opposition to the motion, nor has she otherwise demonstrated that responses to the RFAs were served in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220 prior to the hearing.  Accordingly, the unopposed motion is GRANTED. Plaintiff Carrasco’s RFAs, set one, is deemed admitted against Defendant Becky. (CCP §2033.280(b).)      IV. SANCTIONS Sanctions are mandatory against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response, unless a court makes certain findings.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290(c), 2031.300(c).)¿Defendant Becky did not file any opposition. However, sanctions may be awarded, even though no opposition was filed, pursuant to CRC 3.1348(a). Additionally, where a party fails to provide a timely response to requests for admission, “[i]t is mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).) Plaintiff Carrasco seeks $1,710 in monetary sanctions for each motion.  A court has discretion to award sanctions that are “suitable and necessary to enable the party seeking discovery to obtain the objects of the discovery he seeks” but they should not be punitive in nature or levied for the purposes of punishing an offending party. (Vallbona v. Springer (1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 1525, 1545.)        Plaintiff Carrasco is awarded $200 for each motion as attorney’s fees. Further, Plaintiff is awarded four motion filing fees of $60, for a total of $240 as costs.   Sanctions are imposed against Defendant Becky. Defendant Becky is ordered to pay sanctions to Plaintiff Carrasco, by and through counsel of record, in the total amount of $1,040, within thirty (30) days.  Moving party is ordered to give notice.    PLEASE TAKE NOTICE: Parties are encouraged to meet and confer after reading this tentative ruling to see if they can reach an agreement. If a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling,¿the party must send an email to the court at¿sscdept31@lacourt.org¿with the Subject line “SUBMIT” followed by the case number.¿ The body of the email must include the hearing date and time, counsel’s contact information, and the identity of the party submitting.¿¿ Unless¿all¿parties submit by email to this tentative ruling, the parties should arrange to appear remotely (encouraged) or in person for oral argument.¿ You should assume that others may appear at the hearing to argue.¿¿ If the parties neither submit nor appear at hearing, the Court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the Court.¿ After the Court has issued a tentative ruling, the Court may prohibit the withdrawal of the subject motion without leave.¿  Dated this 3rd day of May 2024      Hon.
