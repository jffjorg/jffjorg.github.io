            This is a habitability case. Plaintiffs Daisy Nwosu, Douglas Havens,
Angele Taylor, Taj Taylor (a minor), Preston Taylor (a
minor), Rick Lopez (a minor), and Rigberto Lopez (a minor) sued Defendants Daniel
Braum and David Hekmat, for (1.) breach of implied warranty of habitability, (2.)
breach of statutory warranty of habitability (3.) quiet enjoyment, (4.)
negligence, (5.) violation of Civil Code section 1942.4, (6.) nuisance, and (7.)
violation of tenant anti-harassment ordinance. 
            
            Plaintiffs have settled this case
with Defendants for $630,000. Plaintiffs/Petitioners
now seeks approval of a compromise of the claims on behalf of minors, Plaintiffs Taj Taylor, Preston Taylor, Rick Lopez, and Rigberto Lopez.

 
Discussion
 
            Court approval is
required for all settlements of a minor’s claim. (Prob. Code, §§ 3500, 3600, et
seq.; Code Civ. Proc., § 372.) California Rules of Court, rule 7.950
provides that a petition “must be verified by the petitioner and must contain a
full disclosure of all information that has any bearing upon the reasonableness
of the compromise.” The Petition must be filed on Judicial Council Form
MC-350 and must be fully completed. 
 
            The Petition is properly filed on the Judicial Council form
and is verified. Petitioners have also submitted the requisite attachments with
the Petition.  
            
            Of
the $630,000 in settlement funds, Adult
Plaintiffs will each receive $81,428.56. $40,000.08
will be allocated for the claims of minor Plaintiffs Taj Taylor, Preston Taylor, Rick Lopez, and Rigberto Lopez
($10,000.02 for each minor). This amount compensates minor
Plaintiffs for their bodily injury from the uninhabitable living conditions, including
insect bites and allergy type symptoms.
            Plaintiffs’
counsel seeks attorney fees in the amount of $2,479.14 from each minor
Plaintiff claimant, which is approximately 25% of the settlement amount. (See Pets.,
¶¶ 13-16; Chapman Decl., ¶ 9.) Counsel’s declaration supports the
factors of reasonableness under California Rules of Court, rule 7.955(b). In
support, he provides a declaration of tasks and services rendered during the
course of this case and the risks inherent in this litigation. (Chapman Decl.,
¶¶ 9-11.) Upon consideration of those facts, the Court finds that the amount of
$2,479.14 is reasonable.
            Petitioner
also seeks to deposit the funds in a blocked account. (Proposed Orders, ¶ 5(b);
Attach., 18(b)2.) 
Petitioners
have satisfied all of procedural and substantive requirements.
Therefore, the petitions are granted.
