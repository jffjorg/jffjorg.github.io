Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court's tentative ruling is as follows:

* The demurrer to the second amended complaint is overruled as to the seventh and fifteenth causes of action.
* The demurrer is sustained with leave to amend as to the tenth cause of action.
* The demurrer is sustained without leave to amend as to the eighth, ninth, eleventh, and fourteenth causes of action, and those counts are dismissed.
* The motion to strike claims for punitive damages is denied.

The court finds that the allegations in the second amended complaint are sufficient to state a claim for disability discrimination. The court also finds that the allegations of failure to provide meal periods, overtime compensation, and accurate wage statements are not sufficient to state a claim.

The court notes that the plaintiff has not alleged specific facts showing any communication by the plaintiff of his "reasonable belief that the employer's action or practice is unlawful" prior to his termination, which is an element of FEHA retaliation.

The court also notes that the plaintiff has not alleged any facts showing that the defendants failed to provide a reasonable accommodation for the plaintiff's disability, which is an element of FEHA failure to accommodate.

The court's ruling is based on the California Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA), the Labor Code, and the Code of Civil Procedure.
