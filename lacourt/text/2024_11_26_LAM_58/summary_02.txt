And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering the petitions to approve the compromise of pending actions on behalf of minors in a habitability case. The plaintiffs, including Angele Taylor, Rigoberto Lopez, Daisy Nwosu, Douglas Havens, Taj Taylor, Preston Taylor, and Rick Lopez, sued the defendants, Daniel Braum and David Hekmat, for various claims including breach of implied warranty of habitability, breach of statutory warranty of habitability, quiet enjoyment, negligence, and violation of tenant anti-harassment ordinance. The case has been settled for $630,000, and the plaintiffs are seeking approval of the compromise of the claims on behalf of the minors.

The judge notes that court approval is required for all settlements of a minor's claim, and that the petition must be verified and contain a full disclosure of all information that has any bearing upon the reasonableness of the compromise. The petition is properly filed and verified, and the requisite attachments have been submitted.

The judge finds that the allocation of the settlement funds is reasonable, with adult plaintiffs receiving $81,428.56 each, and minors receiving $40,000.08 each. The judge also finds that the request for attorney fees in the amount of $2,479.14 is reasonable.

Based on the information presented, the judge grants the petitions to approve the compromise of the pending actions on behalf of the minors.
