And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the Defendant's motion to strike the Plaintiff's request for punitive damages. The Plaintiff sued the Defendant for strict liability and negligence due to a dog bite incident. The Defendant argued that the Plaintiff's complaint does not contain specific allegations of oppression, fraud, or malice to support a claim for punitive damages. The Judge agreed, noting that the complaint only contains vague and conclusory allegations regarding the Defendant's alleged negligence and lack of control over his dogs. The Judge found that the allegations do not show the Defendant engaged in conduct demonstrating "willful and conscious disregard" to the rights and safety of others, and therefore the complaint fails to allege facts sufficient to support a request for punitive damages. The Plaintiff is granted leave to amend the complaint and must file and serve an amended complaint by December 26, 2024.
