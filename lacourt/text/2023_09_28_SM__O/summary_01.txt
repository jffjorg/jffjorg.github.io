And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has tentatively ruled on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the defendants Rand Shalabi, Elvis A. Ortiz-Wayland, and Housekey Real Estate Corp. The defendants' demurrer to the second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth causes of action is sustained with 20 days leave to amend. The motion to strike punitive damages from the complaint is denied without prejudice.

The judge found that the defendants failed to articulate how the plaintiff's admission in paragraph 22 of the second amended complaint proves, as a matter of law, that the plaintiff has not alleged any claim. The defendants' demurrers on the grounds that the plaintiff's claims fail to state a cause of action are therefore overruled.

However, the judge found that the factual allegations regarding the existence or lack thereof of any contractual relationship between the plaintiff and the broker defendants are inconsistent. As a result, the defendants' special demurrer to each cause of action against the broker defendants is sustained with 20 days leave to amend.

The judge noted that from these inconsistencies, it is uncertain what duty, if any, the broker defendants owed to the plaintiff, and whether such duty was created by agreement or imposed by law.

**English Text Summary:**


The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer and motion to strike filed by Defendants Shalabi, Ortiz-Wayland, and Housekey Real Estate Corp.  The core of the ruling focuses on inconsistencies in Plaintiff's claims regarding the existence and nature of an agency relationship with the Broker Defendants. While Plaintiff alleges Defendant Shalabi acted as his agent, Plaintiff also states he never met with Shalabi or entered an agency agreement. This creates uncertainty about the legal basis for Plaintiff's claims against the Broker Defendants. 

The judge has therefore sustained the demurrer to the 2nd through 9th causes of action, giving Plaintiff 20 days to amend his complaint and clarify these inconsistencies. The motion to strike punitive damages was denied without prejudice.

And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has ruled on the demurrer with motion to strike filed by the defendants. The Judge has sustained the demurrer to the second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth causes of action of the second amended complaint, but has given the plaintiff 20 days to amend. The Judge has also denied the defendants' motion to strike punitive damages from the complaint, without prejudice.

The Judge found that the defendants' demurrer was based on the plaintiff's admission that they never met with the defendants or entered into an agency agreement with them, but the defendants failed to articulate how this admission proves that the plaintiff has not alleged any claim. However, the Judge found that the defendants' demurrer on the grounds of uncertainty did have merit, as the factual allegations regarding the existence or lack thereof of any contractual relationship between the plaintiff and the broker defendants were inconsistent.

The Judge sustained the demurrer to each cause of action against the broker defendants, but gave the plaintiff 20 days to amend. The Judge also noted that the defendants' special demurrer to each cause of action against the broker defendants was sustained, with 20 days leave to amend.

Defendant does not identify any element of any cause of action that is defeated by this admission. Nor does Defendant otherwise explain how this admission is a complete defense to Plaintiff’s claims. Defendant’s demurrers on the grounds that the Plaintiff’s claims fail to state a cause of action, therefore, are OVERRULLED."
