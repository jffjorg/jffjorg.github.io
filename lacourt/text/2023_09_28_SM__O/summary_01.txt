And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has tentatively ruled on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the defendants Rand Shalabi, Elvis A. Ortiz-Wayland, and Housekey Real Estate Corp. The defendants' demurrer to the second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth causes of action is sustained with 20 days leave to amend. The motion to strike punitive damages from the complaint is denied without prejudice.

The judge found that the defendants failed to articulate how the plaintiff's admission in paragraph 22 of the second amended complaint proves, as a matter of law, that the plaintiff has not alleged any claim. The defendants' demurrers on the grounds that the plaintiff's claims fail to state a cause of action are therefore overruled.

However, the judge found that the factual allegations regarding the existence or lack thereof of any contractual relationship between the plaintiff and the broker defendants are inconsistent. As a result, the defendants' special demurrer to each cause of action against the broker defendants is sustained with 20 days leave to amend.

The judge noted that from these inconsistencies, it is uncertain what duty, if any, the broker defendants owed to the plaintiff, and whether such duty was created by agreement or imposed by law.
