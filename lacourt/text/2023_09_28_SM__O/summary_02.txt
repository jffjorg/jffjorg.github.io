**Case Number:** 23SMCV00817
**Hearing Date:** September 28, 2023

**Parties:**
* **Plaintiff:** Karissa Delaunay
* **Defendant:** K & H Care, LLC and Joes Hernandez

**Summary:**

The judge granted the Defendant's motion to compel arbitration and stayed the court proceedings pending the outcome of the arbitration. 

**Key Points:**

* **Arbitration Agreement:** An applicable arbitration agreement exists between the parties. This agreement covers any controversy arising out of the employment relationship, except for specific exceptions like unlawful detainer actions or wage disputes.
* **Scope of Arbitration:** The judge found that the Plaintiff's claims fall within the scope of the arbitration agreement.
* **Unconscionability:** The Plaintiff argued the agreement was unconscionable, but the judge found no evidence of procedural or substantive unconscionability. 

**Reasons for Ruling:**

* The agreement was a "take it or leave it" contract of adhesion, but this alone doesn't render it unenforceable.
* The Defendant agreed to pay for the arbitrator and both parties are allowed to conduct discovery.
* The arbitration clause does not significantly disadvantage either party.


**Judge's Conclusion:**

The Judge determined that the arbitration agreement is valid, enforceable, and covers the Plaintiff's claims. As a result, the case is stayed while arbitration proceeds.
