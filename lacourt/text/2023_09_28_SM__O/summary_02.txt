Summary:
The court grants the defendant's motion to compel arbitration and stays the proceedings pending arbitration. The defendant argues that the dispute falls within the scope of the arbitration agreement, which is broad and applies to disputes arising out of or related to the employment agreement. The plaintiff opposes the motion, arguing that the agreement is unconscionable, but the court finds that the agreement is not unconscionable as it provides for bilateral discovery and the employer pays for the cost of the arbitrator.
