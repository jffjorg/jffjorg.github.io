And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The defendants, Ryder Truck Rental Inc., Vitco Distributors Inc., and Vladimir Gonzalez, have moved to compel the plaintiff, Inger Lorre-Wening, to provide responses to special interrogatories and request for production of documents. The motion is denied without prejudice because the discovery was not properly served on the plaintiff. The plaintiff failed to provide responses to the discovery, which was served on July 28, 2023, and the responses were due on or before August 29, 2023. The court cannot grant the motion without determining whether the discovery was properly served on the plaintiff. As a result, the motion is denied, and the request for sanctions is also denied.
