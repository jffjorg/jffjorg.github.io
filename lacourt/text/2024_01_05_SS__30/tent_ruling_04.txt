Plaintiff Wilson Banegas is ordered to provide responses without objection to the request for production of documents, set two, within 20 days of this order.Defendant’s request for sanctions is DENIED.Moving party is ordered to give notice.DiscussionOn February 20, 2023, Defendant served Request for Production of Documents, Set Two, on Plaintiff. (Leon Decl., ¶ 2; Exh. A.) Response were due on or before March 24, 2023. Plaintiff did not serve responses. (Leon Decl., ¶ 4.)As Defendant properly served discovery requests and Plaintiff has failed to serve responses, the Court finds Defendant is entitled to a court order directing Plaintiff to provide verified responses without objections to the discovery requests served on Plaintiff. Therefore, the motion is granted.Defendant also requests sanctions. Code of Civil Procedure § 2031.300(c) allows for sanctions when the motion was unsuccessfully opposed. Here, as the motion was not opposed, the request for sanctions is denied.Defendant’s request for sanctions under CCP section 2023.010 for the misuse of discovery is also denied, as "sections 2023.010 and 2023.030 do not independently authorize the trial court to impose monetary sanctions for misuse of discovery.” (City of Los Angeles v. PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLC (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 466, 504.)
