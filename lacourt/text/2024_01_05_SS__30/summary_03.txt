And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is a summary of the Court's thinking on the case "A Minor, by and through his Guardian ad Litem, Cristyn Martin vs The Help Group West, et al." The Judge has decided to continue the petition for 60 days in Department 30 at Spring Street, pending the filing of an amended petition with corrections and a proposed order. The original petition was denied due to trust issues, and the Plaintiff has since submitted a supplemental declaration addressing these issues. However, the Judge notes that there is no amended petition filed on November 6, 2023, as previously mentioned, and that the proposed order has issues that need to be corrected. The Plaintiff is ordered to file the amended petition with corrections and a proposed order in accordance with the Court's prior ruling.
