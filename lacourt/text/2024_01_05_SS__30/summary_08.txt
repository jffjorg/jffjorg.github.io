And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on a plaintiff's motion for leave to amend the complaint to add allegations for punitive damages. The motion is denied, but without prejudice to the plaintiff filing another motion if they discover more facts that would support a claim for punitive damages.

The judge has considered the proposed amended complaint and finds that it does not state a claim for punitive damages. The facts alleged in the complaint, including the defendant's history of drinking and driving, do not demonstrate a probable risk of harm to others.

The judge notes that the case is similar to Dawes v. Superior Court, but the circumstances in this case are different. In Dawes, the defendant had a history of driving while intoxicated and had been arrested and convicted for drunken driving on numerous prior occasions. In this case, the defendant has admitted to drinking and driving in the past, but there is no evidence that he was aware of the probable consequences of his conduct.

The judge also notes that the proposed amended complaint fails to state a claim for punitive damages under California Code of Civil Procedure section 3294, which requires a plaintiff to allege specific facts showing that the defendant has been guilty of malice, oppression or fraud.
