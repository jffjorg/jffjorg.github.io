Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted a motion for attorney's fees in the amount of $89,260 to defendant Zane Consulting, Inc. as the prevailing party against plaintiff The Roosk Group, Inc. The judge found that the defendant is entitled to attorney's fees under Civil Code ยง1717 because the contract between TelcoLynx and Zane Consulting allows the prevailing party to recover their attorney's fees.

The judge also denied motions for judgment on the pleadings as to the seventh and eighth causes of action, which alleged breach of contract and unjust enrichment respectively. The judge found that the allegations were sufficient to meet the elements for breach of oral contract and unjust enrichment.

The judge noted that the parties had an enforceable express contract, and therefore, the unjust enrichment claim did not lie. However, the judge allowed the alternative claim for unjust enrichment to proceed.

The judge also noted that the plaintiff's claims were not barred by the Labor Code, and that the defendant's argument that the plaintiff's claims were based on an at-will employment relationship was not persuasive.
