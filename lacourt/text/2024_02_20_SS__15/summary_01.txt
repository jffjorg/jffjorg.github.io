And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the motions in limine filed by the defendants and has made the following tentative rulings:

* Defendant Pneumo Abex LLC's motion to exclude evidence from the Saranac experiments is granted, as the plaintiffs did not show good cause to depart from the July 8, 2022 CMO.
* Honeywell's motion to exclude references to foreign bans on chrysotile asbestos is granted, as the evidence would consume an undue amount of trial time and have little probative value.
* Honeywell's motion to exclude reference to a 1989 proposed EPA ban is denied without prejudice, as the evidence may be relevant to notice or knowledge.
* Honeywell's motion to exclude an article by Laura S. Welch is denied, as the motion is too vague and the article may be relevant to the case.
* Honeywell's motion to exclude evidence relating to the Friction Materials Standard Institute is denied without prejudice, as the motion is too vague and the evidence may be relevant to the case.
* Honeywell's motion to exclude a letter and a memo from E.A. Martin is granted in part and denied in part, as the documents may be relevant to notice or knowledge but cannot be authenticated.
* Honeywell's motion to exclude evidence of working conditions at its facilities is denied without prejudice, as the evidence may be relevant to notice or knowledge.
* Honeywell's motion to exclude a 1986 EPA document is denied without prejudice, as the document may be relevant to notice or knowledge.
* Honeywell's motion to exclude testimony and videos about William Longo and Richard Hatfield's work simulations is denied without prejudice, as the evidence may be relevant to the case.
* Honeywell's motion to exclude evidence of the publication "Doubt is Their Product" is granted unless and until proper foundation is established with the trial court.
* Honeywell's motion to exclude evidence of workers' compensation actions is granted in part and denied in part, as the evidence may be relevant to notice or knowledge but may be unduly prejudicial.
* Honeywell's motion to exclude evidence of Bendix's conduct and knowledge after the last exposure is denied without prejudice, as the evidence may be relevant to the case.
* Honeywell's motion to exclude evidence of statements of and proceedings of OSHA, the EPA, and any other governmental agency is denied without prejudice, as the evidence may be relevant to notice or knowledge.
* Honeywell's motion to exclude arguments that any exposure is a "substantial factor" is denied without prejudice, as the motion is too vague.
* Morse Tec's motion to exclude evidence of a proposed 1971 Illinois ban is denied without prejudice, as the evidence may be relevant to notice or knowledge.
* Morse Tec's motion to exclude reference to a 1989 proposed EPA ban is denied without prejudice, as the evidence may be relevant to notice or knowledge.
