Summary:
The judge has denied the defendant's petition to compel arbitration and stay discovery. The defendant sought to compel arbitration and stay the civil action based on an arbitration agreement signed by Ollie Roberts, the plaintiff's purported agent. However, the defendant failed to provide competent evidence to establish that Ollie Roberts was the plaintiff's agent or that the plaintiff had authorized Ollie Roberts to sign the arbitration agreement. Therefore, the petition was denied.
