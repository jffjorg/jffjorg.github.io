And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to declare the plaintiff a vexatious litigant without prejudice. The court found that the plaintiff had not met the criteria for being considered a vexatious litigant under California Code of Civil Procedure section 391, as she had only two lawsuits commenced within the past seven years, and neither of those lawsuits had been finally determined against her. The court also found that the plaintiff's motions to compel discovery responses were not frivolous, as they were based on a legitimate argument about the proper verification of discovery responses. The court denied the defendant's request for an order requiring the plaintiff to furnish security and for a pre-filing order prohibiting the filing of new litigation, as these requests were dependent on a finding that the plaintiff was a vexatious litigant.
