#1 
Tentative Ruling 
Plaintiff FC Marketplace’s
unopposed motion to enforce settlement and for entry of judgment is GRANTED.
Plaintiff to give notice.
 
Background 
This lawsuit involves a loan made by Plaintiff FC
Marketplace, LLC (“Plaintiff”) to Defendants HKS Food Inc. (“HKS”) and David
Park as Guarantor (“Park”) (collectively “Defendants”). The operative Complaint,
filed on November 6, 2019, brings causes of action for: (1) Open Book Account;
(2) Account Stated; (3) Reasonable Value of Goods/Services Received/Funds
Provided; (4) Agreement; (5) Promissory Note; (6) Personal Guarantee; and (7)
Unjust Enrichment.
On January 14, 2022, the parties entered into a stipulated
judgment which provides in relevant part: 
·       
A one-time payment of $30,000.00 on February
10, 2022
·       
Monthly payments of $1,445.62 from March 10,
2022 to January 10, 2027. 
·       
“If any payment is not made timely, this
stipulation will be treated as being in default. Upon default, Plaintiff shall
give written notice of the default by email to Frederick Lee, esq. Defendant
has ten (10) days from the date written notice was given to cure any said
default. If the default is not cured after 10 days, Plaintiff is entitled to
enter judgment in the amount of $147,983.57 minus any payments made by the
Defendant, and may thereafter enforce said judgment for the full balance due.”
·       
The Court will retain jurisdiction of the
action until the judgment is fully complied with or until further order of the
Court.
Plaintiff moves to enforce settlement pursuant to CCP §
664.6 based upon Defendants’ failure to make payments under the agreement.  
As of July 12, 2024, the motion is unopposed.
 
Legal Standard 
“If
parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties
outside the presence of the court or orally before the court, for settlement of
the case, or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant
to the terms of the settlement.  If requested by the parties, the court
may retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the settlement until
performance in full of the terms of the settlement.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §
664.6.)   
 
In
hearing a section 664.6 motion, the trial court may receive evidence, determine
disputed facts, and enter terms of a settlement agreement as a judgment. 
(Bowers v. Raymond J. Lucia Companies, Inc. (2012) 206 Cal.App.4th 724,
732.)  The court may interpret the terms and conditions to settlement (Fiore
v. Alvord (1985) 182 Cal.App.3d 561, 566), but the court may not create
material terms of a settlement, as opposed to deciding what terms the parties
themselves have previously agreed upon (Weddington Productions, Inc. v.
Flick (1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 793, 810.)
 
Strict
compliance with the statutory requirements is necessary before a court can
enforce a settlement agreement under this statute.  (Sully-Miller
Contracting Co. v. Gledson/Cashman Construction, Inc. (2002) 103
Cal.App.4th 30, 37.)  The party seeking to enforce a settlement “must
first establish the agreement at issue was set forth ‘in a writing signed by
the parties’ (§ 664.6) or was made orally before the court. 
[Citation.]”  (Harris v. Rudin, Richman & Appel (1999) 74
Cal.App.4th 299, 304 [holding that a letter confirming the essential terms of a
settlement agreement was not a “writing signed by the parties” sufficient to
satisfy the requirements of Section 664.6].) 
 
Discussion 
Plaintiff contends that Defendants have failed to comply
with specific provisions of the settlement agreement that require them to make
monthly payments of $1,445.62. Plaintiff contends that Defendants failed to
make the September 10, 2022 payment. 
They also failed to pay within 10 days of receiving notice of late
payment.  
The Court finds that Defendants have breached the terms of
the Stipulated Judgment by failing to make the requisite monthly payments. 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s motion to enforce
settlement pursuant to C.C.P § 664.6 is GRANTED.  Judgment is to be entered against Defendants
and in favor of Plaintiff in the amount of $147,983.57, less any payments made
by Defendants.
