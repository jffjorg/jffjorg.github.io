Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Steven Sanchez vs. Ford Motor Company, et al., a lemon law action. The Defendant Ford Motor Company demurred to the first, second, and third causes of action, arguing that the Song-Beverly Act does not extend warranties for used vehicles to original manufacturers. The Judge has sustained the demurrer, meaning that these causes of action will be dismissed unless the Plaintiff amends them within 20 days.

The Defendant Ken Grody Ford demurred to the fourth cause of action, arguing that the Plaintiff fails to allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action. The Judge has sustained this demurrer as well, meaning that the fourth cause of action will be dismissed.

The Judge's ruling is based on legal precedent, including the case of Rodriguez v. FCA US LLC, which held that the Song-Beverly Act does not apply to used vehicles. The Judge also considered the case of Stiles v. Kia Motors America, Inc., which held that a previously owned motor vehicle purchased with the manufacturer's new car warranty still in effect is a "new motor vehicle" eligible for the replace and refund remedy under the Song-Beverly Act. However, the Judge noted that the Plaintiff's complaint does not allege that the vehicle had remaining miles on the manufacturer's written warranty, so the Song-Beverly Act does not apply in this case.
