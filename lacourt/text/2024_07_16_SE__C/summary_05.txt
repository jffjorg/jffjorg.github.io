And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the County of Los Angeles' motion for judgment on the pleadings as to the second and third causes of action (negligence and negligent hiring, training, and supervision) with 30 days leave to amend. The judge finds that the plaintiff's complaint fails to meet the heightened pleading standard in actions involving public entities under the Tort Claims Act. The plaintiff's allegations are conclusory and insufficient to establish specific conduct by any County employees to meet the pleading requirements, and the complaint fails to allege what Defendant John Doe did to cause the plaintiff's injuries. The judge notes that the defendant's motion was properly made and that the parties did not meet and confer as required by statute.
