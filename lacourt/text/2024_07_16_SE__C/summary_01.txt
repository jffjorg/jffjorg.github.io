Here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's unopposed motion to enforce the settlement agreement and for entry of judgment. The plaintiff, FC Marketplace, LLC, had entered into a stipulated judgment with the defendants, HKS Food Inc. and David Park, on January 14, 2022, which provided for a one-time payment of $30,000 and monthly payments of $1,445.62. The defendants failed to make the required payments, and the plaintiff has moved to enforce the settlement agreement. The court finds that the defendants have breached the terms of the settlement agreement and grants the plaintiff's motion to enforce the settlement. Judgment will be entered against the defendants and in favor of the plaintiff in the amount of $147,983.57, less any payments made by the defendants.
