And here is a summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the motion to compel deposition and production of documents filed by Plaintiffs Matthew Luon and Lisa Kim Luon against Defendant American Honda Motor Co., Inc. The Defendant is ordered to produce its Person Most Knowledgeable (PMK) for deposition within 45 days, absent an agreement by the parties to a later date.

The Plaintiffs had previously noticed three depositions of the Defendant's PMK, but the Defendant objected to each one. The Defendant offered the Plaintiffs two deposition dates in January 2024, but the Plaintiffs did not respond. The judge finds that the Defendant's actions were not unreasonable and that no sanctions are warranted.

The judge also denies the request for sanctions filed by the Plaintiffs, finding that the Defendant's failure to produce the PMK for deposition was due to a lack of response from the Plaintiffs rather than any intentional wrongdoing.
