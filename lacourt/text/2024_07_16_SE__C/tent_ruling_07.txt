Background
This lemon law action was filed on September 13, 2023 by Plaintiff
Steven Sanchez (“Plaintiff”) against Defendants Ford Motor Company and Ken
Grody Ford Buena Park (collectively “Defendants”) alleging four causes of
action: (1) Violation of Song-Beverly Act-Breach of Express Warranty; (2)
Violation of Song-Beverly Act- Breach of Implied Warranty; (3) Violation of
Song-Beverly Act Section 1793.2; (4) Negligent Repair. 
Defendant Ford Motor Company demurs to the First through
Third Causes of Action on the grounds that the Song-Beverly Act does not extend
warranties for used vehicles to original manufacturers.
Defendant Ken Grody demurs to the Fourth Cause of Action on
the grounds that Plaintiff fails to allege facts sufficient to state a cause of
action. 
Legal
Standard 
 
A
demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the pleading states facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action. (CCP § 430.10(e); Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147
Cal. App. 4th 740, 747.) When considering demurrers, courts read the
allegations liberally and in context. (Taylor v. City of Los Angeles Dept.
of Water and Power (2006) 144 Cal. App. 4th 1216, 1228.) A demurrer
tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters. (SKF
Farms v. Superior Court (1984) 153 Cal. App. 3d 902, 905.)¿ 
 
The
only issue involved in a demurrer hearing is whether the complaint, as it
stands, unconnected with extraneous matters, states a cause of action. (Hahn,
147 Cal.App.4th at 747.) The court treats the demurrer as admitting all
material facts properly pleaded, but not the truth of contentions, deductions
or conclusions of law. (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist. (1992) 2
Cal.4th 962, 967.) 
 
The Song-Beverly Causes of Action 
Ford
argues that the first through third causes of action fail because Plaintiff bought
a used car, not a new car. Civ. Code §1793.22 (e) defines what “New Motor
Vehicle” means for purposes of the Song-Beverly Act, including “a dealer-owned
vehicle and a “demonstrator” or other motor vehicle sold with a manufacturer’s
new car warranty.” (CCP § 1793.22(e)(2).)¿Ford cites Rodriguez v.  FCA US LLC (2022) 77
Cal.App.5th 209, 218, review granted July 13, 2022, S274625. Rodriguez
is cited here for its persuasive value.¿¿ 
 
Rodriguez
parses the meaning of the words, “or other motor vehicle sold with a
manufacturer’s new car warranty,” to determine whether this covers the sale of
previously owned vehicles with some balance remaining on the manufacturer’s
express warranty. In a well-reasoned and persuasive opinion, Rodriguez
concludes it does not. Instead, it holds that “demonstrators and dealer-owned
vehicles” are a narrow class of “basically new vehicles” that “have
never been previously sold to a consumer and they come with full express
warranties.” Rodriguez, supra, 77 Cal.App.5th 209 at 220, bolding
added. “[W]e conclude the phrase “other motor vehicle sold with a
manufacturer’s new car warranty” unambiguously refers to cars that come with a
new or full express warranty.” (Id. at 222.)¿ 
 
Rodriguez
distinguishes Jensen v. BMW of North America, Inc. (1995) 35 Cal.App.4th
112, a case where the consumer was provided with the manufacturer’s full new
car warranty. While the holding of Jensen is that cars sold with a
balance remaining on the manufacturer’s new motor vehicle warranty are “new
motor vehicles” within the meaning of Civ. Code §1793.22, Rodriguez notes
that Jensen was not required to decide the issue since the subject
vehicle there was sold with a full new car warranty. It notes that other cases,
including Dagher v. Ford Motor Co. (2015) 238 Cal.App.4th 905, have also
found it appropriate to limit Jensen to the facts before it. For
example, Kiluk v. Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC (2019) 43 Cal.App.5th 334, 340,
expressed having reservations about applying Jensen but found it did not
have to under the particular facts before it. 
 
Here,
Plaintiff’s 2019 Ford F-150 was purchased used with 30,031 miles on it. (Lally
Decl., ¶ 2, Ex. A) Plaintiff does not allege he purchased this car with a new
car warranty. (Complaint ¶ 9.) 
 
In
his opposition, Plaintiff urges the Court to follow the recently decided case
of Stiles v. Kia Motors America, Inc. (2024) 101 Cal.App.5th
913.  Stiles held that a
previously owned motor vehicle purchased with the manufacturer’s new car
warranty still in effect is a “new motor vehicle” eligible for the replace and
refund remedy under the Song-Beverly Act. Stiles v. Kia Motors, Inc, supra,
at 919.  However, Plaintiff cannot rely
upon Stiles because the Complaint, as currently pled, does not allege that
Plaintiff’s vehicle had remaining miles on the manufacturer’s written warranty.

 
Because
the car at issue is a used car and there is no allegation of any remaining
miles on the manufacture’s written warranty the Demurrer to the First, Second
and Third Causes of Action is SUSTAINED with 20 days leave to amend. 
 
Negligent Repair Cause
of Action
 
Defendant
Ken Grody Ford demurs to the fourth cause of action on grounds that the cause
of action is barred by the economic loss rule, and that Plaintiffs fail to
plead damages. Plaintiff’s lack of opposition
to this argument is deemed to be a concession.   
 
Accordingly, the
Demurrer to the Fourth Cause of Action is SUSTAINED without leave to
amend.
