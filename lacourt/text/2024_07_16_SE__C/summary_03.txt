And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has set a hearing for September 12, 2024, to consider Defendant GUADALUPE MEAVE's Ex Parte Motion for Entry of Judgment in Favor of Defendant GUADALUPE MEAVE and/or to Dismiss Defendant GUADALUPE MEAVE for Plaintiff's Failure to Amend. The motion was granted with 30 days' leave to amend, but the deadline has expired and no Fourth Amended Complaint has been filed. The judge notes that CCP 438 sets forth the rules governing motions for judgment on the pleadings, and that entry of judgment in favor of a party after a motion for judgment on the pleadings is granted with leave to amend but no amended complaint is filed can only be done after a party moves for entry of judgment. The judge has not entered judgment on an ex parte basis. The hearing is set for 9:30 a.m. in Dept. SE-C, and the moving party must give notice.
