Here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling in the case of Javier Ortegon vs. Carolina Cortazar, et al. (Case No. 21NWCV00227) grants Plaintiff's motions for terminating sanctions against Defendant Carolina Cortazar and to compel response to form interrogatories against Defendants Steven Mitchell and Carlos Sandoval.

The Judge grants Plaintiff's motion for terminating sanctions against Defendant Cortazar, striking her answer and entering default judgment against her. The Judge finds that Defendant Cortazar has failed to comply with discovery orders and has a history of abuse, justifying the imposition of the ultimate sanction.

The Judge also grants Plaintiff's motions to compel response to form interrogatories against Defendants Mitchell and Sandoval, imposing sanctions of $1050.00 on them and their counsel, payable within 60 days. The Judge finds that the fees requested by counsel are excessive and reduces the amount of sanctions.

The case involves a landlord-tenant dispute between Plaintiff Ortegon and Defendants Cortazar, Mitchell, and Sandoval, who allegedly entered the leased property without permission, threatened Plaintiff, removed Plaintiff's personal property, and wrongfully evicted Plaintiff.
