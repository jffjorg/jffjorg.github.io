21STCV43258
Defendant GUADALUPE MEAVE's Ex Parte Motion for
Entry of Judgment in Favor of Defendant GUADALUPE MEAVE and/or to Dismiss
Defendant GUADALUPE MEAVE for Plaintiff's Failure to Amend is Specially Set for
Hearing on Thursday, September 12, 2024 at 9:30 a.m. in Dept. SE-C. The
Ex Parte Application will be deemed the Moving Papers. Opposition and Reply to
be filed and served per Code in accordance with this hearing date. 
 
This personal injury action was filed on
November 23, 2021. On September 26, 2023, the operative Third Amended Complaint
("TAC") was filed. On June 11, 2024, this Court granted Defendant
Guadalupe Meave's motion for Judgment on the Pleadings with 30 days leave to
amend. The Notice of Ruling was served electronically by Defendant Guadalupe
Mead on June 12, 2024. So, taking into account 30 days per CCP 438(h)(2), plus
2 days for mailing, the deadline to amend the pleadings expired on July 15, 2024.
As of 7:00 a.m. on July 16, 2024, no Fourth Amended Complaint has been
filed. 
 
If a motion for judgment on the pleadings is
granted with leave to file an amended complaint "but an amended
complaint... is not filed, then after the time to file an amended complaint or
answer has expired, judgment shall be entered forthwith in favor of the moving
party." (CCP 438(h)(4)(C).) 
 
However, "[w]here a motion for judgment on
the pleadings is granted with leave to amend, the court shall not enter a
judgment in favor of a party until the following proceedings are had... (B) If
no amended pleading is filed, then the party shall move for entry of judgment
in its favor." (CCP 438(i)(1)(B).) CCP 438 sets forth the rules governing
motions for judgment on the pleadings. Unlike CCP 581(f)(2) (which only relates
to demurrers), CCP 438 does not state that entry of judgment in favor of a
party after a motion for judgment on the pleadings is granted with leave to
amend but no amended complaint is filed, can be entered on an ex parte basis.
This matter is set for hearing as a regularly noticed motion as indicated
above. 
 
Moving Party to give notice.
