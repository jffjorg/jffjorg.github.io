TENTATIVE RULING
Partition Referee Matthew L. Taylor’s Motion for
Discharge and for Instructions and Orders Regarding Disposition of Remaining
Money and Referee’s Fees is GRANTED IN PART. Partition costs are assessed

Carr (33.3%).
BACKGROUND
This
is an action for partition of a piece of real estate at 19722 Cameron Avenue in
Covina. Plaintiff Kelli Scott, a trustee of The Ronald Earl Wheeler Living
Trust, UA dated March 12, 2021 (Wheeler Trust), alleges the Wheeler Trust holds
an undivided 66.7% interest in the Covina property along with Defendant Dale
Carr who allegedly holds a 33.3% interest in the Covina property and currently
resides at the Covina property. Scott alleges Scott and Carr both hold their
interests as tenants-in-common. Defendant Quality Loan Service Corporation
(Quality Loan) serves as the current trustee for a July 24, 2006 deed of trust
that was recorded against the Covina property on July 31. Defendant Deutsche
Bank National Trust Company (Deutsche Bank) is the beneficiary of a mortgage
secured by the 2006 deed of trust.
On
May 11, 2023, Scott filed a complaint against Carr, Quality Loan, Deutsche
Bank, all persons unknown claiming any interest in the real property, and Does
1-20, alleging the following causes of action: (1) partition by sale of real
property and (2) ouster.
On September
6, 2023, Scott filed a motion for interlocutory judgment of partition and
appointment of referee. On October 4, 2023, the court granted Scott’s motion
and appointed Matthew M. Taylor as partition referee.
On September
19, 2024, Taylor filed a notice of completion of sale of real property by
partition.
On December
11, 2024, Taylor filed the present motion. A hearing on the present motion is
set for January 17, 2025.
REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL
NOTICE
Deutsche Bank’s request for
judicial notice of this court’s records is GRANTED.
ANALYSIS
Taylor
moves the court for discharge and approval of referee’s fees as well as an
order compelling Deutsche Bank to pay Taylor’s fees. While Deutsche Bank does
not oppose Taylor’s discharge as referee, Deutsche Bank opposes the issuance of
any order requiring them to pay Taylor’s referee fees. For the following
reasons, the court GRANTS Taylor’s motion in part.
Here,
Taylor requests a total award of $32,092.00 in referee fees. (Motion, p. 2:19-21.)
Based upon a review of Taylor’s supporting declaration and exhibits, the court
determines that Taylor’s requested fees are reasonable. (Taylor Decl., ¶ 4, Ex.
3.) While $4,745.60 remains in the referee’s account, Taylor requests the
remaining $27,346.40 be satisfied by Deutsche Bank who received the proceeds
from the sale of the Covina property.
Pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure section 873.820, “[t]he proceeds of sale for any
property sold shall be applied in the following order:
“(a) Payment of the expenses of sale.
(b) Payment of the other costs of partition in whole
or in part or to secure any cost of partition later allowed.
(c) Payment of any liens on the property in their
order of priority except liens which under the terms of sale are to remain on
the property.
(d) Distribution of the residue among the parties in
proportion to their shares as determined by the court.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
873.820.)
In
arguing Taylor is entitled to payment from Deutsche Bank, Taylor points to Code
of Civil Procedure section 874.010, subdivision (b) which defines “costs of
partition” to include the referee’s fees and expenses. Taylor also notes that payment
of such fees has priority over Deutsche Bank’s payment as a lienholder.
Deutsche
Bank notes in its opposition, however, this provision appears inapplicable here
as the proceeds of the Covina property’s sale have already been distributed.
Taylor does not provide any authority that authorizes the court to essentially
undo a prior distribution of sale proceeds to remedy the referee’s failure to
deduct the costs of partition as authorized by Code of Civil Procedure section
873.820.
Furthermore,
in a stipulation filed September 29, 2023, between Scott and Deutsche Bank, the
parties agreed that “any and all amounts secured by the Trust’s Note and Deed
of Trust shall be paid in full from any sale proceeds.” (RJN, Ex. 1, ¶ 14.)
Taylor did not address this stipulation in his motion.
Because
the costs of partition were not deducted from the sale proceeds, the court
finds the costs of partition must be assessed against the parties. Pursuant to
Code of Civil Procedure section 874.040, “[e]xcept as otherwise provided in
this article, the court shall apportion the costs of partition among the
parties in proportion to their interests or make such other apportionment as
may be equitable.” Thus, the remaining $27,346.40 in referee fees is to be
apportioned among Scott and Carr according to the ownership interests they had held
in the Covina property. (RJN, Ex. 3, p. 3:9-12.)
Accordingly,
the court GRANTS Taylor’s motion and calculates the apportionment of all remaining
partition costs as $18,240.05 from Scott (66.7%) and $9,106.35 from Carr
(33.3%).
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, Taylor’s
motion for discharge is GRANTED IN PART. Partition costs are assessed
against Scott and Carr in the amount of $18,240.05
from Scott (66.7%) and $9,106.35 from Carr (33.3%).
