 Case Number:  24PSCV01828    Hearing Date:   January 17, 2025    Dept:  G Petitioner Stephanie Guzman’s Petition for Approval of  Compromise of Claim or Action or Disposition of Proceeds of Judgment for Plaintiff  Cataleya Guzman, a Minor Respondent: NO OPPOSITION TENTATIVE RULING Petitioner Stephanie Guzman’s Petition for Approval of  Compromise of Claim or Action or Disposition of Proceeds of Judgment for  Plaintiff Cataleya Guzman, a Minor, is GRANTED. BACKGROUND This  is a wrongful death action. In June 2022, Defendant Eggleston Youth Centers,  Inc. (Eggleston) admitted Frankie Avila into a residential drug treatment  program in Baldwin Park. Avila subsequently died from a fentanyl overdose at  Eggleston’s Baldwin Park facility. Frankie Avila was survived by a minor  daughter, Plaintiff Cataleya Guzman. On  June 6, 2024, Cataleya Guzman, through guardian ad litem Stephanie Guzman,  filed a complaint against Eggleston, Clarence Brown, Daniel Ojeda, Don  Gutierrez, Omar Ortiz, and Does 1-50, alleging the following causes of action:  (1) wrongful death, (2) general negligence, (3) fraud/misrepresentation, and  (4) breach of contract. On  August 16, 2024, Cataleya Guzman filed a First Amended Complaint (FAC) against  the same defendants alleging the following causes of action: (1) wrongful  death, (2) premises liability, (3) general negligence, (4) violation of  Business and Professions Code section 17200, and (5) breach of contract. On  October 28, 2024, Stephanie Guzman filed the present petition on Cataleya  Guzman’s behalf.  A hearing on the  petition is set for January 17, 2025, along with an OSC Re: Dismissal. ANALYSIS Stephanie  Guzman petitions for the court’s approval of a $500,000.00 settlement reached between  Cataleya Guzman and all Defendants. For the following reasons, the court GRANTS the petition. Legal Standard An  enforceable settlement of a minor’s or incompetent’s claim can only be  consummated with court approval. (Prob. Code, §§ 2504, 3500, 3600 et seq.; Code  Civ. Proc., § 372.) For this purpose, a petition for approval must be presented  to the court and until it is granted, there is no final settlement. (Scruton  v. Korean Air Lines Co. (1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 1596, 1603-1606.) Any  settlement agreement therefore is voidable by the minor’s guardian ad litem. (Id.,  at p. 1606.) Probate  Code section 3600, et seq., governs how the settlement proceeds are to be paid.  Pursuant to Probate Code section 3601, the order shall approve payment of  reasonable expenses from the settlement as follows: The  court making the order or giving the judgment referred to in Section 3600, as a  part thereof, shall make a further order authorizing and directing that such  reasonable expenses (medical or otherwise and including reimbursement to a  parent, guardian, or conservator), costs, and attorney’s fees, as the court  shall approve and allow therein, shall be paid from the money or other property  to be paid or delivered for the benefit of the minor or incompetent person.  (Prob. Code, § 3601, subd. (a).) In  cases pursuant to Probate Code section 3601, “unless the court has approved the  fee agreement in advance, the court must use a reasonable fee standard when  approving and allowing the amount of attorney’s fees payable from money or  property paid or to be paid for the benefit of a minor or a person with a  disability.” (Cal. Rules of Court 7.955, subd. (a)(1).) In doing so, “[t]he  court must give consideration to the terms of any representation agreement made  between the attorney and the representative of the minor or person with a  disability and must evaluate the agreement based on the facts and circumstances  existing at the time the agreement was made, except where the attorney and the  representative of the minor or person with a disability contemplated that the  attorney's fee would be affected by later events.” (Cal. Rules of Court 7.955,  subd. (a)(2).) Discussion Pursuant  to the settlement agreement reached between the parties, Defendants agree to  pay a total of $500,000.00 to Cataleya Guzman. (Petition, ¶ 10.) With regards to attorney  fees, a retainer agreement is attached to the declaration of counsel. In it,  the attorney fees for Cataleya Guzman will be  42% of the net recovery. (Sterling Decl., Ex. A, § 3.) Here, Cataleya Guzman’s counsel requests $185,000.00 in  attorney fees which is only 37.79% of Cataleya Guzman’s  net recovery.[1]  (Petition, ¶ 13.) In a declaration, Cataleya Guzman’s  counsel estimates counsel spent an estimated 150 hours on the present case over  a period of two and one-half years. (Sterling Suppl. Decl., ¶ 56.) Based on the  court’s own experience, the court finds this to be a reasonable award of  attorney fees. The  Petition also requests $10,422.50 in litigation costs. Thus, Cataleya Guzman  will receive a total net amount of $304,577.50. The  Petition requests the funds be invested in a single-premium deferred annuity  subject to withdrawal only upon authorization of the court. Upon review the  court finds the amount awarded to Cataleya Guzman to be reasonable and finds  the disposition of the funds is proper. Accordingly, the court GRANTS Stephanie Guzman’s petition. CONCLUSION Based  upon the foregoing, Stephanie Guzman’s petition for approval of a minor’s compromise is GRANTED.  The court will set an OSC re: Proof of Deposit  of Funds into Minor’s Account at the hearing on January 17, 2025.__________________________________________________    [1] Cataleya Guzman’s net recovery after the deduction of  $10,422.50 in litigation costs and before the deduction of attorney fees is $489,577.50.
