SUMMARY
OF ACTION 
Plaintiff
Luis Sanchez alleges a purchased 2019 GMC Sierra vehicle came equipped with a
defective Hydra-Matic 8L90 transmission. Plaintiff maintains GMC never
disclosed the known defects in the transmission.
 
On
June 7, 2023, Plaintiff filed a complaint for Song Beverly Act Violations and
Fraud. On October 16, 2023, Plaintiff filed a complaint for Violation of
Song-Beverly Act – Breach of Express Warranty, Violation of Song-Beverly Act –
Breach of Implied Warranty, Violation of Song-Beverly Act – Beverly Act Section
1793.2, and Fraud – Fraudulent Inducement – Concealment.
 
RULING:
Moot/Off-Calendar.
Defendant
General Motors, LLC scheduled a demurrer and motion to strike on the complaint.
The court electronic filing system shows no actual demurrer filed. Regardless,
on October 16, 2023, Plaintiff filed a first amended complaint before the
opposition due date. The first amended complaint was therefore timely filed. The
scheduled demurrer and filed motion to strike are therefore moot. The court
takes the items off-calendar. 
 
General Motors, LLC to serve notice.
