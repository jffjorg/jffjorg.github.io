Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied Plaintiff Kent Tran's motion for a preferential trial date. The motion was based on Plaintiff's age, health, and interest in the action. However, the Judge found that Plaintiff failed to support his motion with a declaration that all essential parties have been served with process or have appeared as required by CCP § 36(c)(1). Additionally, Plaintiff's declaration did not conform with California Code of Civil Procedure Section 185 because it appeared to include a foreign language. Furthermore, the Judge found that Plaintiff did not show that his health is such that a preference is necessary to avoid prejudicing his interest in the litigation. The Judge cited Fox v. Superior Court (2018) 21 Cal.App.5th 529 as an example of a case where a preferential trial date should have been granted, but distinguished the present case from that one. The Judge concluded that Plaintiff's motion for a preferential trial date is denied.
