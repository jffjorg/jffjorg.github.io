Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the defendants' demurrer is overruled, and they must file their answer to the plaintiff's complaint within 30 days. The plaintiff, the County of Los Angeles, brought an action against the defendants, Janet Gomez, Ezequiel Vazquez, and GV Trucking Services, Inc., alleging that they have maintained public nuisance conditions at the subject property and have violated various County Codes. The defendants demurred to the entire complaint, arguing that it is uncertain and lacks specific allegations. The judge has determined that the complaint is not uncertain and has sufficiently alleged facts to support each of the causes of action. The court has also found that the defendants have failed to demonstrate that the plaintiff lacks standing or capacity to bring the action. As a result, the demurrer is overruled, and the defendants must respond to the complaint within the specified timeframe.
