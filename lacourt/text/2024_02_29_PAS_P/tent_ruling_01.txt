[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION
 
 
Date:   February
  29, 2024
Time:  8:30 a.m.
Dept.:  P



 
          
I.        INTRODUCTION
          This is a contractual dispute action. Plaintiff E1011 Labs
LLC (E1011) alleges that its former employees, Kevin Wang (Wang) and Daniel
Hwang (Hwang) are in violation of their Confidential Information and Inventions
Agreements, having started a project with Defendant Salvatore Di Benedetto
(Benedetto) to develop a competing product without Plaintiff. E1011 is in the
business of creating, marketing and selling electronic vaporization products to
smoke cannabis. Plaintiff alleges that Benedetto initially approached Plaintiff
to create one such device, Plaintiff then assigned Wang and Hwang to the
project and subsequently, Wang and Hwang allegedly diverted the project from
Plaintiff for themselves. Defendant Shenzhen Vizi Technology Co. Ltd. is
believed to be the corporation Defendants formed in order to make, manufacture
and sell the product they allegedly misappropriated from Plaintiff.
          The complaint alleges six causes of action: (1) Breach of
Contract (2) Breach of Contract, (3) Conversion, (4) Violation of Comprehensive
Computer Data Access and Fraud Act, (5) Violation of BPC § 17200 and (6) Intentional
interference with prospective economic advantage. 
          Plaintiff filed an ex parte application for TRO and OSC re preliminary
injunction on January 26, 2024. In ruling on the ex parte (TRO granted
1/31/24), the Court deemed the application to be Plaintiff’s moving papers on the
motion for preliminary injunction. Defendants Salvatore Di Benedetto and Daniel
Hwang filed declarations in response on February 8, 2024 and February 13, 2024,
respectively. Kevin Wang also responded on February 13, 2023 but did not file
his response with the Court. E1011 filed its reply on February 23, 2024. E1011
also filed an additional declaration of Timothey J. Daley in reply. The Court
declines to consider evidence submitted for the first time on reply. 
          E1011 seeks an injunction preventing Defendants from (1)
using or disclosing, or authorizing others to do so, any property of E1011
including, but not limited to, any of the electronic files described as the
“Dropbox Files”, (2) destroying or modifying any paper or electronic
information, files that reference E1011’s actual or potential customers,
business histories with such customers, and contact information for such
customers. 
E1011
also seeks a mandatory preliminary injunction requiring Defendants to deliver
to E1011 all of the 16,492 files uploaded to Dropbox on or about October 2,
2023, together with all copies.
Having
read and considered all papers, the motion is GRANTED.   
II.       LEGAL
STANDARD
A.
Law Governing Injunctions
Code
Civ. Proc. §526 (a) provides grounds on which an injunction may issue:
(1)
When it appears by the complaint that the plaintiff is entitled to the relief
demanded, and the relief, or any part thereof, consists in restraining the
commission or continuance of the act complained of, either for a limited period
or perpetually.
(2)
When it appears by the complaint or affidavits that the commission or
continuance of some act during the litigation would produce waste, or great or
irreparable injury, to a party to the action.
(3)
When it appears, during the litigation, that a party to the action is doing, or
threatens, or is about to do, or is procuring or suffering to be done, some act
in violation of the rights of another party to the action respecting the
subject of the action, and tending to render the judgment ineffectual.
(4)
When pecuniary compensation would not afford adequate relief.
(5)
Where it would be extremely difficult to ascertain the amount of compensation
which would afford adequate relief.
(6)
Where the restraint is necessary to prevent a multiplicity of judicial
proceedings.
(7)
Where the obligation arises from a trust.
 
          III.     EVIDENCE
          In support of its motion, E1011 offers the following: 
          A. Declaration of Bruce Pixley
          In support of its
motion for preliminary injunction, E1011 offers the declaration of Bruce
Pixley. (Pixley Declaration) He declares that he was retained by plaintiff’s
counsel to analyze Kevin Wang’s work computer’s hard drive, which was obtained
by Plaintiff on or about October 2, 2023. (Pixley Decl. ¶ 2.) Pixley is a
computer forensics expert with over 20 years of experience. (Pixley Decl. ¶¶ 3-8,
see Exh. 1: Curriculum Vitae.) He declares that he received the subject
computer on October 30, 2023 and it has remained in his possession ever since
and that he conducted a forensic analysis of the data on it. (Pixley Decl. ¶¶
9-11.) He declares he found tens of thousands of texts between Wang, Sal and
Hwang. (Pixley Decl. ¶14.) Pertinent messages included a request for a
vizismoke email (Pixley Decl. ¶ 15), messages about business rollout (Pixley
Decl. ¶ 16) and most importantly, a conversation implicating deletion of E1011
files. (Pixley Decl. ¶ 17.) Pixley declares that he found a message string from
Wang to Hwang on September 26, 2023 at 8:50 PM (PST), that “Btw may need your
help scraping all my shit from El0 tmrw and Thursday. Gotta leverage whatever
time I have left with the database before its gone.” (Pixley Decl. ¶ 17.)
          Pixley also declares that he found messages of Wang sending
a password to Daniel for “...can I grab your sIO login for hubspot though? I
wanna try pulling something.” (Pixley Decl. ¶ 18.) This conversation implicates
Wang sending a E1011 login and password for the purpose of “pulling something” aka
taking something with that access. (Pixley Decl. ¶¶ 18, 19.)
          Lastly, Pixley declares that he found that Dropbox, an
online cloud storage server application, was downloaded onto the computer hard
drive on October 2, 2023. Subsequently, 16,492 files were moved into the
encrypted Dropbox folder on the computer, which would be accessible to anyone from
any other device who had the login and password to the Dropbox account. Pixley
Decl. ¶ 21-23.)
          B. Declaration of Timothy J. Daley
          In support of its motion for preliminary injunction, E1011
offers the declaration of Timothy J. Daley. (Daley Declaration) Daley is
counsel of record for E1011. He attaches the articles of incorporation for
Defendant Shenzhen Vizi Corp., which he obtained through the Illinois Secretary
of State’s website. (Daley Decl. ¶ 2, see Exh. 9.) The articles of
incorporation reflect an incorporation date of March 29, 2023. (Daley Decl. ¶
2.) The initial registered agent for the corporation was Defendant Di Benedetto.
(Exh. 9.)
 
 
          C. Declaration of Mackenzie Whalen
In
support of its motion for preliminary injunction, E1011 also offers the
declaration of Mackenzie Whalen, an employee of E1011. (Whalen Declaration)
Whalen declares that Defendant Kevin Wang was hired by E1011 on July 12, 2021
as a manager and signed a Confidential Information and Inventions Agreement.
(Whalen Decl. ¶ 4, See Exh. 1: Copy of the Agreement.) Whalen declares that
Defendant Daniel Hwang was hired by E1011 on June 12, 2020 as the director of
new business development. (Whalen Decl. ¶4.) She declares he also signed a
Confidential Information and Inventions Agreement. (Exh 2.) She declares the
Defendant Benedetto was a customer of plaintiff who approached Plaintiff with a
business opportunity, to which Defendant Wang was assigned to work on, in his
capacity as an employee of E1011. (Whalen Decl. ¶¶ 6-8.)
Pertinently,
she declares Wang was issued a company laptop, the one Pixley examined, in
connection with his work for E1011. (Whalen Decl. ¶ 9.) She declares Wang was
also given access to proprietary information of E1011, including access to
HubSpot, E1011’s searchable customer database. (Whalen Decl. ¶ 10.) She
attaches a screenshot of Wang’s HubSpot activity for the 2023 year, with
additional more detailed screenshots of suspect dates. (Whalen Decl. ¶¶ 11-12,
see Exh. 3, 4, 5.) This computer was then given to Pixley for forensic
examination. (Whalen Decl. ¶ 13.)
She
reviewed Pixley’s report and provides her take on the text messages, confirming
that it is, in her opinion, the individual defendants involved, and that the
text messages refer to relevant issues in this action. (Whalen Decl. ¶¶ 14-17,
see Exhs. 6, 7.) 
She
also declares that the Dropbox files “consist largely of property of E1011,
including financial records, payroll records, personal income tax information
of E10ll employees (including my own) and contact information for E1011
customers which appears to have been downloaded from HubSpot.”(Whalen Decl. ¶
18.) She also declares that she discovered a suspect google document (Whalen
Decl. ¶¶ 19, 20, see Exh. 8.)
She
declares the employees of E1011 all sign confidentiality agreements,
Defendant-employees conduct is in violation of their agreements and that such
violation is hurting E1011’s business. (Whalen Decl. ¶¶ 21, 22.) 
          In response, Defendants proffer the following evidence:
          A. Response of Salvatore Di Benedetto
          Defendant Di Benedetto declares that he “regret[s] to
inform you that I do not possess or have knowledge of the files being
requested.” (Di Benedetto Resp. p. 1.) However, he declares that “any relevant
files or information pertinent to this matter are in the possession of KEVIN
WANG, and I have not been involved in or have access to the ‘Dropbox Files’ in
question.” (Id.) He further declares that he “do[es] not have and never
had in my possession any of the 16,492 files [in question in this motion]” (Id.)
He indicates that he is willing to cooperate to the extent he can to resolve
the lawsuit.
          In addition, Di Benedetto filed his own declaration,
wherein he declares he will not contribute towards the attorney fees of the
other named individual defendants. (Di Benedetto Decl. ¶¶ 1-3.)
          B. Response of Daniel Hwang
Defendant
Hwang declares that he “regret[s] to inform you that I do not possess or have
knowledge of the files being requested.” (Hwang Resp. p. 1.) However, he
declares that “[i]t has come to my attention that the plaintiff’s specified
files are in the possession of one of the defendants, KEVIN WANG.” (Id.)
He further declares that he “do[es] not currently possess, nor have I ever
possessed, any of the 16,492 files that are [in question in this motion]” (Id.)
He indicates that he is willing to cooperate to the extent he can to resolve
the lawsuit. 
          C. Response of Kevin Wang
          Defendant Kevin Wang also responded, though his response
was not properly filed with the Court. His response is an improperly noticed
motion to compel arbitration and to dismiss for improper venue. (Wang Response
p. 1.) To the extent that this is a motion to dismiss, the notice requirements
and the standard for motions to dismiss are not met here. (CCP § 581.) To the
extent that this is a motion to compel arbitration, the notice requirement and
the motion to compel arbitration requirements are also not met by this
document. (CCP § 1281.)
          The Court also notes that the motion to dismiss component
is made with respect to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(3). This is a
California state court, so the California Code of Civil Procedure governs
motions to dismiss.
          On review of the document, the Court finds that it is
unresponsive to the instant motion for preliminary injunction.
 
          IV.      DISCUSSION
          A. Prohibitory Injunction versus Mandatory Injunction
          A prohibitory
injunction requests the Court intervene to maintain the status quo. Here, E1011
is asking for a prohibitory injunction preventing Defendants from using E1011’s
proprietary information as well preventing Defendants from destroying such
information.
          The burden is higher for a mandatory injunction because the
moving party is asking the Court to disturb the status quo. (See Shoemaker
v. County of Los Angeles (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 618, 625.) Here, E1011 is
also requesting a mandatory injunction ordering the handing over of the Dropbox
files as well as any copies or duplicates in Defendants’ possession. 
B.  Balancing
the Equities
“ ‘[A] preliminary injunction is an order that is
sought by a plaintiff prior to a full adjudication of the merits of its claim.’
(White
v. Davis
(2003) 30 Cal.4th 528, 554, 133 Cal.Rptr.2d 648, 68 P.3d 74, italics omitted.)
‘To obtain a preliminary injunction, a plaintiff ordinarily is required to
present evidence of the irreparable injury or interim harm that it will suffer
if an injunction is not issued pending an adjudication of the merits.’ (Ibid.)
“Trial courts ‘ “ ‘evaluate two interrelated
factors when deciding whether or not to issue a preliminary injunction. The
first is the likelihood that the plaintiff will prevail on the merits at trial.
The second is the interim harm that the plaintiff is likely to sustain if the
injunction were denied as compared to the harm that the defendant is likely to
suffer if the preliminary injunction were issued.’ ” ’ (ITV Gurney
Holding Inc. v. Gurney (2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 22, 28–29.)” Amgen, Inc. v. Health Care Services (2020) 47 Cal.App.5th 716,
731.)
          1. Likelihood
of Prevailing on the Merits
a.
Breach of Contract as to Defendants Wang and Hwang
E1011 urges that it is likely to prevail on the
merits as it has evidence that Defendant Wang and Hwang breached their
confidentiality and intellectual property agreements and stole company
information to create a new rival business, Vizi, with defendant Benedetto.
(Motion Memorandum of Points and Authorities, p. 12: 19-20.) In support, E1011
cites CCP § 526 for the proposition that for a contractual obligation to be
enforced by the court, it must be capable of specific performance. E1011
provides excerpts of the agreements Wang and Hwang signed, pertinently, that “I
also understand that any breach of this Agreement will cause irreparable harm
to Company for which damages would not be an adequate remedy, and, therefore,
Company will be entitled to injunctive relief with respect thereto in addition
to any other remedies and without any requirement to post bond.” (Exhs. 1 and 2
to Whalen Decl.) 
In response, Defendants Hwang and Di Benedetto
filed responses that they do not have access to the files at issue nor did they
ever have access. (Di Benedetto Resp. p. 1; Hwang Resp. p. 1.) In fact, they
urge that Defendant Kevin Wang took the Dropbox files, had sole control of the
DropBox files and continues to have control. (Id.) These responses do not really debate the
likelihood of Plaintiff prevailing on the merits on this cause of action. In fact,
the responses bolster Plaintiff’s likelihood of prevailing, as both Hwang and
Benedetto declared that Kevin Wang took the files in question. Defendant Kevin
Wang’s response does not debate that he signed a confidentiality and
intellectual property agreement or that his actions are in violation of said
agreement, but rather that there is an arbitration agreement between E1011 and
Hwang. It is not clear how this is responsive as to likelihood of prevailing on
the merits.
On reply, E1011 argues that even if by assumption
that there was an arbitration agreement between Wang and E1011, this would not prohibit
the Court from granting a preliminary injunction. (See Reply p. 5: 23-28.) To
the extent that the Court considers this argument, the Court notes it rests on
a wholly unsupported assertion that there exists an identical arbitration
agreement between Kevin Wang and E1011 as compared to the one attached, between
Daniel Hwang and E1011. (Exh. 1 to Wang Resp.) As the Court has no evidence of
such an agreement, the Court declines to evaluate the merits of an argument
premised on such a hypothetical agreement.
On reply, E1011 urges that even if Hwang and Di
Benedetto did not take the files themselves, the preliminary injunction should
also apply to them to foreclose Wang acting through them to use or retain the
files. (See Ross v. Superior Court (1977) 19 Cal.3d 899, 906,
internal citations omitted.) This argument is well-taken. 
Consequently, Plaintiff E1011 has demonstrated a
likelihood of prevailing on the merits.
 
b. Violation of BPC § 17200
E1011 urges that it is likely to prevail on the
merits of its BPC Section 17200 cause of action against all defendants, as it
has demonstrated unfair or unlawful business practices on part of Defendants.
(Motion Memorandum of Points and Authorities, p. 13: 13-15.) Citing Cel-Tech
Communications, Inc. v. Los Angeles Cellular Telephone Co. and  McKell v.
Washington Mutual, Inc., E1011 urges that the standard of prohibited
conduct under the statute is broad. (Cel-Tech Communications, Inc. v. Los
Angeles Cellular Telephone Co. (1999) 20 Cal.4th 163, 180; McKell v.
Washington Mutual, Inc. (2006) 142 Cal.App.4th 1457, 1474.) Additionally,
E1011 cites Hewlett v. Squaw Valley Ski Corp. (1997) 54 Cal.App.4th 499,
539-540 for the proposition that injunctive relief is available as a remedy
under the code section. Further, E1011 cites a case where the taking of a
business’s customer list, similar to the facts alleged here, was determined to
be in violation of BPC § 17200 and a preliminary injunction was issued. (Courtesy
Temporary Service, Inc. v. Camacho (1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 1278, 1291-1292.)
This argument is well taken.
In response, Defendants Hwang and Di Benedetto
filed responses that they do not have access to the files at issue nor did they
ever have access. (Di Benedetto Resp. p. 1; Hwang Resp. p. 1.) In fact, they
urge that Defendant Kevin Wang took the Dropbox files. Defendant Kevin Wang’s
response does not debate that he took the files, but rather that there is an
arbitration agreement between E1011 and Hwang. It is not clear how this is
responsive as to likelihood of prevailing on the merits as to this cause of
action.
Consequently, Plaintiff E1011 has demonstrated a
likelihood of prevailing on the merits.
c. Conversion
E1011 urges that it is likely to prevail on the
merits of its conversion cause of action against all defendants because it has
demonstrated stealing of proprietary information. Citing Hernandez v.
Lopez
(2009) 180 Cal.App.4th 932, 939, E1011 urges that the elements of conversion
are: (1) plaintiff’s ownership of the property at issue, (2) defendant’s
conversion by wrongful act and (3) plaintiff was harmed as a result. E1011 also
cites Labor Code 2860 for the proposition that “[e]verything which an employee acquires
by virtue of his employment, except the compensation which is due to him from
his employer, belongs to the employer.” (LC § 2860.) Citing relevant case law,
E1011 urges that conversion has been pursued for the purloining of intangibles
such as electronic lists. (See Welco Electronics, Inc. v. Mora (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 202, 213, internal
citations omitted.) E1011 also cites case law to the effect that things taken
need not be trade secret in order to prevail as an employer on a conversion
claim against an employee. (Pillsbury,
Madison & Sutro v. Schectman
(1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 1279, 1288-1289.) Preliminary injunctions are possible remedies
to conversion. (Gladstone v.
Hillel (1988) 203 Cal.App.3d 977,
989-990.)
In response, Defendants Hwang and Di Benedetto
filed responses that they do not have access to the files at issue nor did they
ever have access. (Di Benedetto Resp. p. 1; Hwang Resp. p. 1.) In fact, they
urge that Defendant Kevin Wang took the Dropbox files. Defendant Kevin Wang’s
response does not debate that he took the files, but rather that there is an
arbitration agreement between E1011 and Hwang. It is not clear how this is
responsive.
In sum, E1011 has presented sufficient evidence of
a likelihood of prevailing on the merits of its claims. E1011 has presented
evidence that 16,492 Dropbox files were exported from a company laptop, that
the Defendants wanted to take/considered taking certain company data, did take
the data and schemed to build a competing vape shop and product. 
 
          2.
Interim Harm or Irreparable Injury
E1011 urges that irreparable harm will occur if the
preliminary injunction does not issue, as the use of its customer list and the
other information in the Dropbox files is not quantifiable in damages. (Motion
Memorandum of Points and Authorities, p.18: 16.) E1011 would lose customers,
potential revenue streams, potential projects and indeed has. (Whalen Decl. ¶
22.) 
          On response, Defendants Di
Benedetto and Hwang do not refute that E1011 would suffer irreparable injury
should a preliminary injunction not be issued. Neither does Defendant Kevin
Wang debate that E1011 will suffer irreparable harm should it not be granted a
preliminary injunction as requested.
          As such, E1011 has adequately
demonstrated that it would suffer irreparable harm.
 
 
 
 
 
V.       ORDER
           E1011’s motion for a
preliminary injunction is granted. 
Defendants
Kevin Wang, Daniel Hwang and Salvatore Di Benedetto are to remit the DropBox
files to E1011, along with any copies thereof. Defendants are also ordered to
cease their use of the DropBox files. 
Counsel
for E1011, Timothy Daley, is ordered to give notice of ruling.
