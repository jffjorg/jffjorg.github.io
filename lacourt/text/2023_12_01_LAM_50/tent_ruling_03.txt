TENTATIVE RULING
  RE:  
 
MOTION TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL
 



 
Law
Office of Ball & Yorke, Brett Yorke, and Joseph Jones (collectively, “Counsel”)
move to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiffs Leslie Chavarria, Juan Pina
Gonzalez aka Manual Padilla Gonzalez, and Josue Alvarado Perez. 
As
an initial matter, the Court notes that the August 4, 2023 minute order in this
action provides, inter alia, that “[t]he Stipulation and Order to stay
the action is signed and filed this date. Pursuant to written stipulation, the
Final Status Conference scheduled for 08/04/2023, and Jury Trial scheduled for
08/16/2023 are advanced to this date and vacated. The case is stayed until
January 11, 2023 for the reasons discussed in the Order signed and filed this
date and incorporated herein by reference.”[1]
Counsel
has not provided any legal authority demonstrating that the Court may consider
the instant motion to be relieved as counsel notwithstanding the August 4, 2023
stay order. 
            For the
foregoing, reasons, Counsel’s motion to be relieved as counsel is taken off calendar.
Counsel
is ordered to give notice of this order.¿
