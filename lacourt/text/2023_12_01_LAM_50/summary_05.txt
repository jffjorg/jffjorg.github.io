And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge, Hon. Rolf M. Treu, issued a tentative ruling on December 1, 2023, in the case of Eddie Morgado vs. Giannina Vanessa Salazar et al. (Case No. 22STCV25974). The case involves a motion for trial preference filed by Morgado, who is seeking a preferential trial date due to his health condition. The motion is opposed by Salazar. The Judge denied Morgado's motion, finding that he has not provided "clear and convincing medical documentation" to support his claim. The Judge noted that Morgado's diagnosis of Squamous Cell Carcinoma in October 2021 and his subsequent treatment do not support his claim that his life expectancy is less than six months. The Judge also noted that the motion relies on an old "Work Status Report" dated November 22, 2022, which does not provide sufficient evidence to support Morgado's claim. The Judge granted Salazar's opposition and denied Morgado's motion for trial preference without prejudice.
