TENTATIVE RULING
  RE:  
 
PETITION TO
  CONFIRM MINOR’S COMPROMISE



            
            Background
            On May 10, 2018,
Plaintiffs Elizabeth Noemy Zetino, Jessica Ivonne Zetino Morales, and
Harlynn Amerylise Zetino Lopez, a minor, by and through her Guardian ad Litem,
Elizabeth Noemy Zetino (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) filed the instant action
against Defendants 15025 Saticoy Street, Inc., J.K. Residential Services, Inc.,
and Anza Management Company. 
Plaintiffs filed the
operative First Amended Habitability Complaint on September 11, 2019, alleging
causes of action for (1)
violation of Civil Code section 1942.4, (2) tortious breach of the warranty of
habitability, (3) private nuisance, (4) Business & Professions Code § 17200
et seq., and (5) negligence.
The parties have
reached a settlement in this matter. Elizabeth Noemy Zetino as Petitioner for Claimant Harlynn
Amerylise Zetino Lopez now petitions for the Court’s
approval of the settlement on behalf of the Claimant.  
 
            Discussion
An
enforceable settlement of a minor’s claim can only be consummated with court
approval. (Prob. Code, § 3500.) The petition must be verified by the petitioner,
must contain a full disclosure of all information that has any bearing upon the
reasonableness of the compromise, and must be prepared on judicial council form
MC-350. (California
Rules of Court, rule 7.950.)  
Here,
the petition is prepared on form MC-350 and is verified by the Petitioner. However,
the Court notes that Item 14 of the petition
(Form MC-350) is blank. 
            Conclusion
Based
on the foregoing, the Court intends to grant the
petition and approve the compromise, subject to Petitioner filing a corrected Form
MC-350 prior to the hearing that corrects the defect
identified above, and subject to Plaintiffs’ examination of Petitioner at the
hearing.  
Petitioner is to
give notice of this ruling.
