            Background
Plaintiff Marlene
Cornejo (“Plaintiff”) filed this action on May 24, 2023 against Defendants
Atlantic Solutions Group Inc., doing business as Empire Workforce Solutions and
Adam Kidan. The Complaint alleges causes of action for (1) declaratory
relief-arbitration, (2) declaratory relief – recusal of counsel, (3)
declaratory relief – profit share, (4) accounting, (5) wages, (6) wrongful
termination, (7) vacation pay, and (8) unfair business practices. 
Plaintiff now moves “to
disqualify Damion Robinson, Esq., and his law firm, Diamond McCarthy, LLP as
counsel for Defendants Atlantic
Solutions Group Inc., doing business as Empire Workforce Solutions; and Adam
Kidan.” No opposition to the motion was filed.

Court issued an Order granting the motion. The Court’s October 13, 2023 minute
order provides, inter alia, that “[t]he Motion to Compel
Arbitration filed by Adam Kidan, Atlantic Solutions Group, Inc., a Delaware
corporation on 08/07/2023 is Granted. The Court hereby stays the case in its
entirety.” 
Conclusion

foregoing, Plaintiff’s motion to disqualify defense counsel is taken off
calendar.

notice of this order.¿
