And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied Counsel's motion to be relieved as counsel for the plaintiffs, citing the August 4, 2023 minute order that stayed the action until January 11, 2023. Counsel had not provided any legal authority to demonstrate that the Court could consider the motion despite the stay order. As a result, the motion is taken off calendar, and Counsel is ordered to give notice of this order.
