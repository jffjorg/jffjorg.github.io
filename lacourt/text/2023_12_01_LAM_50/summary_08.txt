And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the petition to confirm the minor's compromise and has tentatively ruled to approve the settlement, subject to the Petitioner filing a corrected Form MC-350 prior to the hearing and subject to Plaintiffs' examination of the Petitioner at the hearing. The parties had reached a settlement in the matter, and the Petitioner is requesting court approval of the settlement on behalf of the Claimant. The judge notes that the petition is incomplete, but is willing to grant the petition if the defect is corrected.
