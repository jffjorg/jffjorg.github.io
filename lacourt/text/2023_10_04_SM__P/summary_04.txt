And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on VST 2020-NPL1's motion for summary judgment. Initially, the Judge denied the motion, citing a declaration by William McCaffrey that raised triable issues of fact regarding the chain of title. However, VST 2020-NPL1 filed a reply brief that adequately addresses and disposes of the issue raised by McCaffrey's declaration. Specifically, VST 2020-NPL1 presented a judicially noticeable document from the Delaware Secretary of State Entity Registry, which shows that Verus Securitization Trust 2020-NPL1 was formed on September 16, 2020, and therefore existed when the deed of trust was transferred. Additionally, VST 2020-NPL1 presented legal authority that refutes McCaffrey's suggestion that the trust did not exist at the time of the deed transfer. The Judge has also considered all evidence presented by Ashley Aarons et al. against VST 2020-NPL1's motion, and has determined that the evidence is insufficient to create a triable issue of material fact. Therefore, the Judge grants summary judgment for VST 2020-NPL1.

## English Summary:

However, VST 2020 provided evidence from the Delaware Secretary of State showing the trust was formed before the transfer, effectively refuting McCaffrey's claim. 

The judge also found McCaffrey's declaration inadmissible due to a lack of oath and insufficient qualifications to be an expert witness.  

Ultimately, the judge granted VST 2020's motion for summary judgment, finding that there were no genuine disputes of material fact and VST 2020 was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reconsidered the motion for summary judgment filed by VST 2020-NPL1 REO and has granted the motion. The dispute is over the existence of Verus Securitization Trust 2020-NPL1 at the time the deed of trust was transferred to the property. VST 2020 presented evidence, including a judicially noticeable document from the Delaware Secretary of State Entity Registry, which shows that the trust was formed on September 16, 2020, and therefore existed when the deed was transferred. The judge found that the declaration of William McCaffrey, who claimed to be an expert witness, is inadmissible and would not raise a triable issue even if considered. The judge concluded that the evidence presented by Aarons, the defendant, is insufficient to create a triable issue of material fact and therefore granted summary judgment to VST 2020.
