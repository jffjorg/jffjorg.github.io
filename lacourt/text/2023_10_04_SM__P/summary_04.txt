And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on VST 2020-NPL1's motion for summary judgment. Initially, the Judge denied the motion, citing a declaration by William McCaffrey that raised triable issues of fact regarding the chain of title. However, VST 2020-NPL1 filed a reply brief that adequately addresses and disposes of the issue raised by McCaffrey's declaration. Specifically, VST 2020-NPL1 presented a judicially noticeable document from the Delaware Secretary of State Entity Registry, which shows that Verus Securitization Trust 2020-NPL1 was formed on September 16, 2020, and therefore existed when the deed of trust was transferred. Additionally, VST 2020-NPL1 presented legal authority that refutes McCaffrey's suggestion that the trust did not exist at the time of the deed transfer. The Judge has also considered all evidence presented by Ashley Aarons et al. against VST 2020-NPL1's motion, and has determined that the evidence is insufficient to create a triable issue of material fact. Therefore, the Judge grants summary judgment for VST 2020-NPL1.
