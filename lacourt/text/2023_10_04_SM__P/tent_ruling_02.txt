CHC Builders, Inc.
v. Shafighi et al., Case No.22SMCV01524
Hearing Date
October 4, 2023 
Defendant’s Motion
to Expunge Mechanic’s Lien 
 
Defendant Shafighi
moves to expunge a mechanic’s lien recorded by plaintiff CHC Builders.
 
A claimant on a
mechanic’s lien must commence a claim to enforce it within ninety days after
recordation. Cal. Civ. Code §8460. If a claimant brought an action to enforce a
mechanic’s lien, the owner of the property affected by the lien may file a
motion to remove it. Lambert v. Superior Court (1991) 228 Cal.App.3d
383. 
 
Defendant Shafighi
argues the action to enforce the lien is improper because the parties to the
construction contract were himself and Abraham Gottlieb, not CHC. Under Cal.
Civ. Code §8400, any “person that provides work authorized for a work of
improvement,” can record a mechanic’s lien. The statute does not limit
mechanic’s lien enforcement to contracting parties. Since CHC performed work,
it may record a mechanic’s lien. 
 
Shafighi argues
the lien is invalid because it was recorded by “CHC Builders,” not “CHC
Builders, Inc.” This discrepancy is immaterial, as both refer to the same
business, and there is no confusion or prejudice. See, e.g., Handyman
Connection of Sacramento, Inc. v. Sands (2004) 123 Cal.App.4th 867, 887. 
 
Finally, Shafighi
argues the lien was not commenced within ninety days of recordation. An action
was timely commenced by CHC Builders. Shafighi argues CHC Builders, Inc. is the
proper claimant, and that entity did not timely seek to enforce the lien. As CHC’s
omission of “Inc.” is de minimis and immaterial, CHC Builders timely commenced
this action. DENIED.
