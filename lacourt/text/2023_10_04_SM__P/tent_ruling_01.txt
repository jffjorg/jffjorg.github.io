Aimco Venezia LLC
v. Huesca, et al., Case No. 20SMCV00130
Hearing Date
October 4, 2023 
Plaintiff Aimco
Venezia LLC’s Motion to Tax Costs (UNOPPOSED) 
 
After trial, the
court’s proposed statement of decision awarded contractual prevailing party
attorney’s fees to defendants Huesca and Luske, who filed a memorandum of costs
on August 16, 2023. Plaintiff Aimco moves to tax, arguing the amount sought
exceeds the amount allowed in the proposed SOD. Defendants did not file an
opposition.
 
The proposed SOD
states “[d]efendants may seek to recover attorney’s fees (limited to $5,000,
per the lease.)” 8/1/2023 minute order pg. 7. The memorandum of costs seeks
$20,113.53 in attorney’s fees. See memorandum of costs 8/16/2023. The
amount awarded was based on the lease, which capped attorney’s fees at $5,000. The
motion is granted, and defendants are awarded $5,000 in fees; the remainder is
taxed. 
 
Aimco argues the fee
award should be offset because defendants have not paid $4,470 in attorney’s
fees the court awarded to plaintiff on March 29, 2023 after prevailing on an
anti-SLAPP motion against defendants’ cross-complaint. Aimco’s counsel Jina
Yoon states the anti-SLAPP award is still outstanding, and defendants provide
no evidence to the contrary. 
 
Defendants are
awarded the contractual limit of $5,000 in fees, plus $90.85 in court costs. The
unpaid prior award of $4,470 to plaintiff is to be offset from that amount, for
a net of $530, plus $90.85 in court costs, a total of $620.85 due to defendants
from plaintiff.
