The cross-complainants, Ronald Byers and Mari Sharon Harris, are seeking attorney's fees after the court denied the anti-SLAPP motion filed by Bailey Care Homes, Inc. and Shawn Bailey. The anti-SLAPP motion claimed that Bailey's statement accusing Byers and Harris of embezzlement was protected litigation activity, but the court found that the communication was not protected.

The court has determined that the anti-SLAPP motion was not frivolous, as there was a connection between the communication and protected settlement negotiations. However, the court concluded that the connection was too remote to support an anti-SLAPP motion. The court has denied the motion for attorney's fees, as sanctions are not warranted under Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. §425.16(c)(1). The judge has taken the matter under submission to reconsider plaintiff's declaration, reflecting that the arguments raised were not frivolous.

## English Text Summary:

In this case, Bailey Care Homes and Shawn Bailey (the defendants) filed an anti-SLAPP motion against Ronald Byers and Mari Sharon Harris (the cross-complainants). The court denied this motion, finding that Bailey's communication with James Williams (who was involved in settlement negotiations) was not protected litigation activity. 

Although the defendants' arguments were ultimately unsuccessful, the court determined they were not frivolous. The connection between the communication and settlement negotiations was considered too remote to justify the anti-SLAPP motion.  

As a result, the cross-complainants' motion for attorney's fees was denied because the court found that the defendants' anti-SLAPP motion was not frivolous or intended to cause unnecessary delay.
