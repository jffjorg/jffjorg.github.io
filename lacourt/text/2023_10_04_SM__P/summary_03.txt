And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendants' and cross-complainants' motion for attorney's fees, which was unopposed. The cross-complainants, Ronald Byers and Mari Sharon Harris, are seeking attorney's fees after the court denied the anti-SLAPP motion filed by Bailey Care Homes, Inc. and Shawn Bailey. The anti-SLAPP motion claimed that Bailey's statement accusing Byers and Harris of embezzlement was protected litigation activity, but the court found that the communication was not protected.

The court has determined that the anti-SLAPP motion was not frivolous, as there was a connection between the communication and protected settlement negotiations. However, the court concluded that the connection was too remote to support an anti-SLAPP motion. The court has denied the motion for attorney's fees, as sanctions are not warranted under Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. ยง425.16(c)(1). The judge has taken the matter under submission to reconsider plaintiff's declaration, reflecting that the arguments raised were not frivolous.
