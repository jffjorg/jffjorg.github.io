Bailey Care Homes,
Inc. v. Byers et. al., Case No. 22SMCV01690 
Hearing Date
October 4, 2023
Defendants and
Cross-Complainants’ Motion for Attorney’s Fees (UNOPPOSED)
 
On May 23, 2023,
after taking the matter under submission, the court denied cross-defendants
Bailey Care Homes and Shawn Bailey’s anti-SLAPP motion. Cross-complainants
Ronald Byers and Mari Sharon Harris seek attorney’s fees, arguing the
anti-SLAPP motion was frivolous.
 
Under Cal. Code of
Civ. Proc. §425.16(c)(1), if a court finds an anti-SLAPP motion is “frivolous
or is solely intended to cause unnecessary delay, the court shall award costs
and reasonable attorney’s fees to a plaintiff prevailing on the motion[.]”
 
The
cross-complaint alleged Bailey falsely told third party James Williams that Byers
and Harris embezzled money from Bailey Care Homes. The anti-SLAPP motion argued
Bailey’s statement was protected litigation activity, as Williams arranged
settlement negotiations between the parties. The court found the communication
was not protected.
 
Although the
argument was unsuccessful, it was not frivolous. There was a connection between
the communication and protected settlement negotiations, but the court
concluded the connection was too remote to support an anti-SLAPP motion. The
decision to take the matter under submission to reconsider plaintiff’s
declaration reflects that the arguments raised were not frivolous. It was not
unreasonable to bring the motion. Sanctions are not warranted under
§425.16(c)(1). DENIED.
