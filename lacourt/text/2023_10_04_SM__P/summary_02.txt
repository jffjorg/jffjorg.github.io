And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the matter of CHC Builders, Inc. v. Shafighi et al., Case No. 22SMCV01524. The defendant, Shafighi, has moved to expunge a mechanic's lien recorded by the plaintiff, CHC Builders. The Judge has denied the motion.

The issue at hand is whether the mechanic's lien is valid and whether it was timely commenced. Shafighi argues that the lien is invalid because the parties to the construction contract were himself and Abraham Gottlieb, not CHC. However, the Judge finds that under California Civil Code Section 8400, any person who provides work authorized for a work of improvement can record a mechanic's lien, regardless of whether they are a party to the contract.

Shafighi also argues that the lien is invalid because it was recorded by "CHC Builders" instead of "CHC Builders, Inc." However, the Judge finds that this discrepancy is immaterial, as both names refer to the same business and there is no confusion or prejudice.

Finally, Shafighi argues that the lien was not commenced within ninety days of recordation. However, the Judge finds that an action was timely commenced by CHC Builders, and that CHC's omission of "Inc." is de minimis and immaterial.
