Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' anti-SLAPP motion without prejudice. The motion argued that the posts made by the defendants on social media were protected speech and sought to strike the complaint alleging defamation. The judge found that the complaint did not provide sufficient specificity to determine whether the alleged conduct was based on protected activity. The judge also ruled that the defendants' motion went beyond providing evidentiary context and asked the court to consider new facts, which is improper in an anti-SLAPP motion. The judge followed the two-step process outlined in California Civil Code §425.16 and Cal. Civ. Code §425.16, and found that the first prong of the anti-SLAPP motion was not fulfilled.

## English Summary

The judge is considering a motion filed by the defendants, Martinez, Crespo, and Enamorado, to dismiss the plaintiff's Ammari's defamation lawsuit.  The defendants argue that their online posts calling Ammari a criminal are protected speech under California's anti-SLAPP statute.

The judge explains that to win an anti-SLAPP motion, the defendants must first show that their conduct was protected by the First Amendment. However, the judge finds that the complaint does not provide enough detail about the specific content of the defendants' posts to determine if they were protected speech. 

The judge is concerned that the defendants are asking the court to "redraft" the plaintiff's complaint by introducing new facts and arguments not presented in the original filing. This is improper, according to the judge, and the defendants' motion fails on the first prong.

Therefore, the judge denies the defendants' motion without prejudice, meaning they can refile it if they provide more specific information in their complaint.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendants' special motion to strike (anti-SLAPP motion) in the case of Ammari v. Martinez, et al. The defendants argue that the posts on social media were protected speech and seek to strike the complaint under California's anti-SLAPP statute. The court must determine whether the conduct underlying the cause of action arises from the defendant's constitutional rights of free speech or petition.

The court analyzes the pleadings and finds that the allegations are not specific enough to determine whether they are based on protected activity. The court cannot "redraft" the pleading to determine whether it could survive an anti-SLAPP motion. The defendants' motion goes beyond providing evidentiary context for the plaintiff's allegations and asks the court to consider new facts, which is improper.

Therefore, the court denies the anti-SLAPP motion without prejudice.

The Judge's tentative ruling in the case of Ammari v. Martinez et al., case number 23SMCV01442, is denying the defendants' special motion to strike (Anti-SLAPP Motion) without prejudice. The plaintiff alleges that the defendants defamed him publicly by calling him a criminal on social media, while the defendants argue that the posts were protected speech under California's anti-SLAPP statute. The court follows a two-step process in resolving anti-SLAPP motions, and the court determines that the complaint does not include specific enough allegations regarding the dispute between Martinez and Ammari or the specific language used in the social media posts. Therefore, the first prong of the anti-SLAPP motion is not fulfilled, and the motion fails.
