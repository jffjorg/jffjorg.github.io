Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' anti-SLAPP motion without prejudice. The motion argued that the posts made by the defendants on social media were protected speech and sought to strike the complaint alleging defamation. The judge found that the complaint did not provide sufficient specificity to determine whether the alleged conduct was based on protected activity. The judge also ruled that the defendants' motion went beyond providing evidentiary context and asked the court to consider new facts, which is improper in an anti-SLAPP motion. The judge followed the two-step process outlined in California Civil Code ยง425.16 and Cal. Civ. Code ยง425.16, and found that the first prong of the anti-SLAPP motion was not fulfilled.
