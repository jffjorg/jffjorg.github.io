VST 2020-NPL1 REO,
LLC v. Ashley Aarons et al., Case No. 22SMCV02549
Hearing Date October
4, 2023  
Plaintiff VST
2020’s Motion for Summary Judgment – Reply Brief 
 
On September 5, 2023,
the court heard plaintiff VST 2020’s motion for summary judgment. The court
took the matter under submission and issued a tentative ruling on September 21,
2023, denying the motion on the grounds that the declaration of William McCaffrey
raised triable issues of fact regarding chain of title. The court granted VST
2020-NPL1’s request to file a reply brief refuting McCaffrey’s opinions.
 
VST 2020’s reply
adequately addresses and disposes of the issue the court identified in its
prior tentative, that the McCaffrey declaration suggests Verus Securitization
Trust 2020-NPL1 did not exist when the deed of trust to the property was
transferred. 
 
VST 2020 presents
a judicially noticeable document from the Delaware Secretary of State Entity
Registry, showing Verus Securitization Trust 2020-NPL1 was formed on September
16, 2020, so was in existence when the deed of trust was transferred. This establishes
McCaffrey’s opinion regarding Verus Security’s existence is without merit. 
 
Additionally, VST 2020
presents legal authority for the rule that “whether a mortgage-backed security
trust is registered with the SEC has nothing at all to do with its legal
existence,” further refuting McCaffrey’s suggestion that VST did not exist when
the deed transfer occurred. VST 2020 also correctly notes McCaffrey’s claim he
has worked as a “business development manager” in the “banking industry” is
insufficient to qualify him as an expert witness, and his declaration is not signed
under oath. For these reasons, McCaffrey’s declaration is inadmissible and
would not raise a triable issue for the reasons stated, even if it were to be
considered. 
 
The court has
considered all evidence Aarons sought to present against VST’s MSJ, including the
evidence not included in Aarons’ initial opposition. The evidence is
insufficient to create a triable issue of material fact, and summary judgment
for VST is GRANTED.
