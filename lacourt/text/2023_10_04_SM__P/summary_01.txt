And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on Aimco Venezia LLC's motion to tax costs. After trial, the court's proposed statement of decision awarded contractual prevailing party attorney's fees to defendants Huesca and Luske. The defendants filed a memorandum of costs seeking $20,113.53 in attorney's fees, but the court found that this amount exceeds the amount allowed in the proposed statement of decision. The court granted the motion and awarded defendants the contractual limit of $5,000 in fees, plus $90.85 in court costs. However, the court also ordered that the unpaid prior award of $4,470 in attorney's fees awarded to plaintiff Aimco be offset from this amount, resulting in a net of $530, plus $90.85 in court costs, a total of $620.85 due to defendants from plaintiff.
