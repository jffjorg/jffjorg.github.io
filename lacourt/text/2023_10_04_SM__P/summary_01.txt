## English Summary

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Aimco Venezia LLC v. Huesca, et al.  The Judge will grant Aimco's motion to tax costs, meaning the amount of attorney's fees awarded to defendants Huesca and Luske will be reduced.

The Judge found that the lease agreement limits attorney's fees to $5,000, regardless of the amount claimed by defendants.  Although defendants initially sought $20,113.53 in fees, the Judge will only award them $5,000.

Additionally, the Judge will offset the $5,000 award by the $4,470 in attorney's fees that defendants still owe to Aimco from a prior court ruling. This means defendants will receive a net amount of $530 plus $90.85 in court costs, for a total of $620.85.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on Aimco Venezia LLC's motion to tax costs. The motion is related to a trial, where the court's proposed statement of decision awarded contractual prevailing party attorney's fees to defendants Huesca and Luske. The defendants had filed a memorandum of costs seeking $20,113.53 in attorney's fees, but the lease capped attorney's fees at $5,000. The court has granted the motion and awarded the defendants $5,000 in fees, with the remainder being taxed.

Additionally, Aimco argues that the fee award should be offset because the defendants have not paid $4,470 in attorney's fees that the court awarded to Aimco after prevailing on an anti-SLAPP motion against the defendants' cross-complaint. The court has agreed to offset the fee award by the unpaid prior award, resulting in a net amount of $530, plus $90.85 in court costs, being due to the defendants from Aimco.

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's motion to tax costs in the case of Aimco Venezia LLC vs. Huesca, et al.

The defendants' memorandum of costs sought $20,113.53 in attorney's fees, but the judge reduces this amount to $5,000 based on the lease agreement.
