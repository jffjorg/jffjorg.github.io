Background
 
On October 3, 2022, Joseph Daneshard and
Daneshard Law Firm, APC (collectively “Plaintiffs”) filed a Complaint against
Daniel Davidovitz; D and M General Constructor, Inc. (collectively
“Defendants”); and Does 1 to 100. 
 
The Complaint asserts five causes of
action: (1) fraud by false promise, (2) fraud in the concealment, (3) fraud by
intentional misrepresentation; (4) negligent misrepresentation, and (5) quantum
meruit. The claims arise out of the legal services the Plaintiffs previously
performed in representing Defendants. 
 
On February 5, 2024, Defendants filed a
Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings (“MJOP”). Plaintiffs oppose the Motion.
The matter is now before the court. 
motion for judgment on the pleadings[1]
 
I.         Legal
Standard
 
“A motion for judgment on the pleadings performs the same
function as a general demurrer, and hence attacks only defects disclosed on the
face of the pleadings or by matters that can be judicially noticed.” (Burnett
v. Chimney Sweep (2004) 123 Cal.App.4th 1057, 1064.) “In deciding or
reviewing a judgment on the pleadings, all properly pleaded material facts are
deemed to be true, as well as all facts that may be implied or inferred from
those expressly alleged.” (Fire Ins. Exchange v. Superior Court (2004)
116 Cal.App.4th 446, 452.) When considering demurrers and judgment on the
pleadings, courts read the allegations liberally and in context. (Wilson v.
Transit Authority of City of Sacramento (1962) 199 Cal.App.2d 716, 720-21.)
A motion for judgment on the pleadings does not lie as to a portion of a cause
of action. (Id.) “In the case of either a demurrer or a motion for
judgment on the pleadings, leave to amend should be granted if there is any
reasonable possibility that the plaintiff can state a good cause of action.” (Gami
v. Mullikin Medical Ctr. (1993) 18 Cal.App.4th 870, 876.) A non-statutory
motion for judgment on the pleadings may be made any time before or during
trial. (Stoops v. Abbassi (2002) 100 Cal.App.4th 644, 650.)¿¿ 
 
II.        Request for
Judicial Notice
 
The
Court may take judicial notice of records of any court of record of the United
States. (Evid. Code, § 452(d)(2).) However, the court may only judicially
notice the existence of the record, not that its contents are the truth. (Sosinsky
v. Grant (1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 1548, 1565.)

filed the following day.
 
4)

Defendants’ request for judicial notice is granted. 
 
III.      Discussion
 
In
the underlying action, entitled D and M General Contractor, Inc. v. Joseph
Daneshard (LASC Case No. 21STCV18885), Defendant D and M General
Contractor, Inc. filed a Complaint against Plaintiff Joseph Daneshard for (1)
professional negligence, (2) breach of contract, and (3) declaratory relief. 
 
On
May 30, 2023, Plaintiff Joseph Daneshard filed an Answer to the Complaint in
the underlying action and filed a Cross-Complaint against Steven A. Morris,
Jonathan M. Deer; Quantum Law Group, LLC, and Roes 1 to 10. The Cross-Complaint
was dismissed on June 1, 2023. (RJN Ex. 2.)  
 
Defendants assert that on October 3, 2022, Plaintiffs filed
this action. On February 24, 2023, Judge Stephen Goorvitch ruled that the cases
were related within the meaning of CRC, rule 3.3000(a), with the underlying
action being the lead case. (RJN Ex. 6.) However, Plaintiff Daneshard filed a
Peremptory Challenge of Judge Goorvitch. On March 22, 2023, Judge Michelle
Williams found that the cases were not related and that the interests of
justice were not served by reassigning the underlying action to a new Judicial
Officer, such that the court determined that the underlying action should no
longer be related. (RJN Ex. 7.) 
 
Defendants maintain that this action is related to the
underlying action because the dispute is related to the alleged legal fees owed
to Plaintiffs in the underlying action. Accordingly, Defendants assert that
this action is barred by the compulsory cross-complaint statute because
Plaintiffs failed to assert their current claims by failing a cross-complaint
in the underlying action. 
 
CCP § 426.30 states: 
 
(a)
Except as otherwise provided by statute, if a party against whom a complaint
has been filed and served fails to allege in a cross-complaint any related
cause of action which (at the time of serving his answer to the complaint) he
has against the plaintiff, such party may not thereafter in any other action
assert against the plaintiff the related cause of action not pleaded.
 
(b)
This section does not apply if either of the following are established:
 
(1)
The court in which the action is pending does not have jurisdiction to render a
personal judgment against the person who failed to plead the related cause of
action.
(2)
The person who failed to plead the related cause of action did not file an
answer to the complaint against him.
 
“The compulsory cross-complaint statute
is designed to prevent ‘piecemeal litigation.’” (Wittenberg v. Bornstein
(2020) 51 Cal.App.5th 556, 564.) “Thus, a party cannot by negligence or design
withhold issues and litigate them in successive actions; he may not split his
demands or defenses; he may not submit his case in piecemeal fashion.” (Id.
at p. 564.) “The statute is to be liberally construed to advance its purpose.”
(Heshejin v. Rostami (2020) 54 Cal.App.5th 984, 993.) 

Plaintiffs assert that they could not file a cross-complaint in the underlying
action because Plaintiff Daneshard’s professional corporation, Plaintiff
Daneshard Law Firm, APC was not named as a Defendant in the underlying action,
only Plaintiff Daneshard individually. Defendants do not dispute this assertion
but instead assert that Plaintiff Daneshard Law Firm, APC could have filed a
Cross-Complaint. 
 
The
court finds that the language of CCP § 426.30 is clear in that the compulsory
cross-complaint statute “does not apply” when the “person who failed to plead
the related cause of action did not file an answer to the complaint against
him.” (CCP § 426.30(b)(2).) The CCP defines “Person” to include “a corporation
as well as a natural person.” (CCP § 17(b)(6).) Therefore, for section 426.30
to apply, Plaintiff Daneshard Law Firm, APC had to have been a person who filed
an answer in the underlying action but failed to allege a cross-complaint at
the time the answer was filed. (See Align Technology, Inc. v. Tran
(2009) 179 Cal.App.4th 949, 970 [“‘Only related causes of action that exist at the time of
service of the answer to the complaint on the particular plaintiff are affected
by Section 426.30’”]; see also AL Holding Co. v. O'Brien &
Hicks, Inc. (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 1310,
1313–1314 [accord].) 
 
“Section 426.30 does not apply if the
court in which the action is pending does not have jurisdiction to enter a
personal judgment against the person who failed to plead the cause of action (§
426.30, subd. (b)(1)) or the person who failed to plead the related cause of
action did not answer the complaint (id. subd.(b)(2)).” (Chao Fu, Inc. v. Chen (2012) 206 Cal.App.4th 48, 56
[italics added].) While section 426.30 bars Plaintiff Joseph
Daneshard’s claims because he filed an answer in the underlying action but
failed to plead this related action, it does not bar Plaintiff Daneshard
Law Firm, APC claims because the latter was not a party against whom a
complaint was filed in the underlying action.  
 
Defendants
fail to show that the exception to section 426.30 does not apply to Plaintiff
Daneshard Law Firm, APC such that its claims against Defendants are barred.
Accordingly, the Motion is granted in part as to Plaintiff Joseph Daneshard
without leave to amend and denied as to Plaintiff Daneshard Law Firm, APC. 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendants’ motion for judgment on the pleadings is granted
in part. The motion is granted as to Plaintiff Joseph Daneshard
without leave to amend and denied as to Plaintiff Daneshard Law Firm, APC.
Defendants to give notice.
