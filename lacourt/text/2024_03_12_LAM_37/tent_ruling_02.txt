CCP § 439 requires the moving party to meet and confer
in person or by telephone with the party who filed the pleading before filing a
motion for judgment on the pleadings. Defense counsel asserts he tried to meet
and confer with Plaintiffs before filing this action, therefore the meet and
confer requirement has been met. (Morris Decl. ¶ 10.)
