**Significant Statements:**

* "A motion for judgment on the pleadings performs the same function as a general demurrer, and hence attacks only defects disclosed on the face of the pleadings or by matters that can be judicially noticed." (Burnett v. Chimney Sweep (2004) 123 Cal.App.4th 1057, 1064)
* "In deciding or reviewing a judgment on the pleadings, all properly pleaded material facts are deemed to be true, as well as all facts that may be implied or inferred from those expressly alleged." (Fire Ins. Exchange v. Superior Court (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 446, 452)
* "The compulsory cross-complaint statute is designed to prevent 'piecemeal litigation.' Thus, a party cannot by negligence or design withhold issues and litigate them in successive actions; he may not split his demands or defenses; he may not submit his case in piecemeal fashion." (Wittenberg v. Bornstein (2020) 51 Cal.App.5th 556, 564)
