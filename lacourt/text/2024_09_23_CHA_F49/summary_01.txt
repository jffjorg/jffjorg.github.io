And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion to compel deposition attendance of the Person Most Qualified (PMQ) of Defendant American Honda Motor Co., Inc. The PMQ is required to attend and testify in the deposition. The judge has also granted the request for monetary sanctions against AHM and its attorney, awarding $1,350.00 to Plaintiffs' Counsel.

The case involves a lawsuit filed by Plaintiffs Manuel Rangel Quintero and Miriam Mayoral Hernandez against AHM under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act, alleging defects in their 2018 Honda Odyssey. The judge has previously sustained AHM's demurrer and granted AHM's motion to strike punitive damages.

The judge found that AHM's objections to the deposition notice were not valid and that AHM failed to make a good faith attempt to resolve the issues. The judge concluded that Plaintiffs have made good faith attempts to reschedule and resolve the issues.

The judge ordered AHM to produce its PMQ for deposition within 30 days and awarded $1,350.00 in favor of Plaintiffs' Counsel for reasonable attorney's fees and costs incurred in preparing the motion.
