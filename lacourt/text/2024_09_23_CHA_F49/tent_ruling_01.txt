RESPONDING PARTY: Defendant American Honda Motor Co.,
Inc. (“Defendant” or “AHM”)
NOTICE: OK.
 
RELIEF
REQUESTED: An
order from this Court to compel the attendance of Defendant AHM’s Person Most Qualified
(“PMQ”). Plaintiffs also request the Court to impose monetary sanctions against

TENTATIVE
RULING: The

BACKGROUND
 
Plaintiffs filed this Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act (“Song-Beverly
Act”) lawsuit over alleged defects in their 2018 Honda Odyssey with VIN:
5FNRL6H74JB103086 (the “Subject Vehicle”), which was manufactured by Defendant AHM.
Plaintiff purchased the Subject Vehicle on August 30, 2021, entering into an
express warranty agreement with AHM. (Compl. ¶¶ 8-9.)
 
On January 13, 2023, Plaintiffs initiated the action against
AHM and Does 1 through 10. The Complaint alleges two causes of action: (1) Violation
of Song-Beverly Act – Breach of Express Warranty, and (2) Fraudulent Inducement
– Concealment.
 
On June 29, 2023, the Court sustained AHM’s demurrer with 30
days to amend as to the Complaint’s second cause of action and granted AHM’s
motion to strike any claim for punitive damages in the Complaint’s first cause
of action. (6/29/23 Minute Order.)
 
On August 10, 2023, Plaintiffs filed their operative First
Amended Complaint (“FAC”), alleging against AHM and Does 1 through 10: (1)
Violation of Song-Beverly Act – Breach of Express Warranty; and (2) Fraudulent
Inducement – Concealment. 
 
Subsequently, on January 24, 2024, the Court sustained without
leave to amend AHM’s second demurrer, filed on September 14, 2023, to the FAC’s
second cause of action. The Court further granted AHM’s motion to strike
Plaintiffs’ request for punitive damages in the FAC. (1/24/24 Minute Order.)
Following this, on February 23, 2024, AHM filed its Answer to the FAC.
 
On June 4, 2024, Plaintiffs filed the instant Motion to
Compel Deposition Attendance of AHM’s PMQ and custodian of records (the
“Motion”).
 
Subsequently, on July 12, 2024, Plaintiffs filed their
Notice of Defendant’s Non-Opposition to the Motion.
 
On July 15, 2024, AHM filed its Opposition, to which
Plaintiffs replied on September 16, 2024.
 
ANALYSIS
 
To compel the deposition of a
party to an action or its officer, director, managing agent, or employee, the
deposing party need only serve a notice in compliance with Code of Civil
Procedure section 2025.240. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.280, subd. (a).) Nothing
further is needed. If, after service of the deposition notice, the deponent
fails to appear “without having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410
...” the deposing party may move for an order compelling the deponent’s
attendance and testimony. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (a).)
 
A.   
Procedural
Requirements
 
1.     
Meet and Confer
 
"Implicit in the requirement
that counsel contact the deponent to inquire about the nonappearance is a
requirement that counsel listen to the reasons offered and make a good faith
attempt to resolve the issue," including by rescheduling.¿(Leko v.
Cornerstone Bldg. Inspection Serv. (2001) 86 Cal. App. 4th 1109, 1124.)
 
Here, on April 3, 2024, Plaintiffs
served AHM with an Amended Notice of Deposition for the deposition of AHM’s PMQ
and custodian of records, for a deposition date of May 1, 2024. (Lupinek Decl.,
¶ 4, Ex. “A.”) On April 16, 2024, AHM served its written objection to the
deposition notice. (Id. ¶ 7, Ex. “C.”) In response, Plaintiffs sent AHM
a meet and confer letter discussing the issues raised in AHM’s objection. (Id.
¶ 8.)
 
On May 1, 2024, after AHM’s
PMQ failed to appear at the deposition, Plaintiffs’ counsel sent AHM an email
offering an additional three business days to provide dates for the deposition.
(Id. ¶ 10.)  On May 21, 2024, Plaintiffs
sent a follow up email to AHM, seeking dates for the deposition. However, they
have not heard responses from AHM. (Id. ¶ 11.)
 
Based on these records, the
Court concludes that Plaintiffs have made good faith attempts to reschedule and
resolve the issues.
 
2.     
Separate
Statement
 
The California Rules of Court
rule 3.1345 (a)(5) explicitly states that “Any motion involving the content of a discovery request or
the responses to such a request must be accompanied by a separate statement.
The motions that require a separate statement include a motion: ... (5) To compel or to quash the
production of documents or tangible things at a deposition[.]”
 
Here, Plaintiffs have fulfilled the
requirement by concurrently filing a separate statement with the Motion.
 
B.    
Motion to
Compel Deposition of AHM’s PMQ 
 
Code of Civil Procedure
section 2025.280 subdivision (a) provides that service of a deposition notice
“is effective to require any deponent who is a party to the action [] to attend
and to testify, as well as to produce any document, electronically stored
information, or tangible thing for inspection and copying.”
 
An
objection under Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.410 must be written and served
“at least three calendar days prior to the date for which the deposition is
scheduled,” and pertains to an “error or irregularity” with the notice itself.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.410, subd. (a).) The procedure for a deponent who
seeks to narrow the scope of a discovery request is to move for a protective
order. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.420, subd. (a).)
 
It is important
to note that objections alone do not stay the taking of the deposition. To
do so, the objecting party should move to quash the deposition notice and stay
the taking of the deposition. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.410 (c), [“In
addition to serving this written objection, a party may also move for an order
staying the taking of the deposition and quashing the deposition notice. The
motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section
2016.040. The taking of the deposition is stayed pending the determination of
this motion.”])
 
Here, AHM’s objections are not rooted in any “error or
irregularity” within the deposition notice itself. Furthermore, AHM has not filed a motion to stay the taking of the
deposition or to quash the deposition notice. Although AHM claims that it is
not refusing to provide a PMQ for the deposition, its inability to promptly
respond or schedule a date acceptable to Plaintiffs’ counsel – attributed to
AHM’s logistical challenges, while notable (Opp’n. at pp. 3-4, Dowling Decl. ¶
14) – does not suffice as a valid legal basis to override Plaintiffs’ rights to
conduct necessary discovery under the statute. 
 
Accordingly, Plaintiffs are entitled to the deposition of AHM’s
PMQ upon serving AHM with the valid Amended Notice of Deposition on April 3,
2024. 
 
Therefore, the Court GRANTS the Motion to Compel Deposition
Attendance of AHM’s PMQ.
 
C.   
Request for
Monetary Sanctions
 
If
a motion to compel a party deponent to appear for a deposition is granted, the
court must impose a monetary sanction "in favor of the party who noticed
the deposition and against the deponent . . . unless the court finds that the
one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust." (Code Civ
Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (g)(1).)
 
Utilizing
a lodestar approach, and in view of the totality of the circumstances, the
Court finds that the total and reasonable amount of attorney’s fees and costs
incurred for the work in preparing the Motion is $1,350.50, calculated at a
reasonable hourly rate of $450.00 for 3 hours reasonably spent.
 
Therefore, the Court GRANTS
IN PART Plaintiffs’ request for monetary sanction, awarding $1,350.00 in favor
of Plaintiffs.

Court GRANTS Plaintiffs’ Motion to Compel Deposition
Attendance of Person
Most Qualified of Defendant American Honda Motor Co., Inc.
