  Case Number:  21STCV31760    Hearing Date:   December 4, 2024    Dept:  29 Jimenez v. AMF Beverly Lanes
21STCV31760
Motion for Terminating Sanctions and Monetary Sanctions filed by Defendant AMF
Bowling Centers, Inc.
Tentative
The motion is granted as to monetary
sanctions and denied as to terminating sanctions.
Background
On August 27, 2021, Plaintiff Jonathan M.
Jimenez (“Plaintiff”), representing himself in pro per, filed a complaint
against Defendants AMF Beverly Lanes, Bowlero Corporation, AMF Bowling Centers,
Inc. and Does 1 through 10, asserting causes of action for negligence and
premises liability arising out of a physical altercation occurring on August
30, 2019, at a bowling alley on West Beverly Boulevard in
Montebello.  
On October 22, 2021, Defendant AMF Bowling
Centers, Inc. (erroneously sued as AMF Beverly Lanes and Bowlero Corporation)
(“Defendant”) filed an answer to the complaint.
On April 23, 2024, the Court granted
Defendant’s motion to compel and ordered Plaintiff to respond to Defendant’s
Special Interrogatories (Set Two), Supplemental Interrogatories (Set One), and
Supplemental Requests for Production (Set One).  Plaintiff did not
comply or respond to follow up communications from Defendant’s
counsel.  (Buckner Decl., ¶¶ 3-5, 8-10.)
On July 29, 2024, the Court denied Defendant’s
prior motion to dismiss the case as a terminating sanction. The dismissal was
based on a defect in service and was without prejudice.  In the Minute Order, the Court stated:
“The Court also notes, but does not decide,
that the notice of ruling on the motion to compel was given electronically (and
therefore may not be adequate). 
The Court also observes, but does not decide.
that the violation of one court order, although a serious matter that commonly
merits sanctions, may not be a sufficient basis for a terminating sanction.”
(Minute Order, at p. 4.)
On August 29, 2024, Defendant served
Plaintiff by overnight delivery with a number of documents, including the
Notice of Ruling.  (Buckner Decl., ¶ 8
& Exhs. 4-6.)  On October 16, 2024,
Defendant against served Plaintiff by overnight delivery with a number of
documents, including the Notice of Ruling. 
(Id., ¶ 9 & Exhs. 7-9.)
On November 1, 2024, Defendant filed this
motion for terminating sanctions and monetary sanctions.  Plaintiff was served by overnight delivery.
No opposition has been filed.
Legal Standard
When a plaintiff fails to obey an order
compelling answers to interrogatories, “the court may make those orders that
are just, including the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction,
or a terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010).  In lieu of or in addition to, that sanction, the court
may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290, subd. (c).)
When a plaintiff fails to obey an order
compelling responses to requests for production, “the court may make those
orders that are just, including the imposition of an issue sanction, an
evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010).  In lieu of or in addition to, that sanction, the court
may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.300, subd. (c).)
In Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery Act,
section 2023.030 provides for monetary, evidence, issue, and terminating
sanctions for any “misuse of the discovery process,” “[t]o the extent
authorized by the chapter governing any particular discovery method or any
other provision of this title.”  A “misuse of the discovery process”
is defined to include (among other things) failing to respond or to submit to
an authorized method of discovery; making, without substantial justification,
an unmeritorious objection to discovery; making an evasive response to a
discovery request; disobeying a court order to provide discovery; and making or
opposing, unsuccessfully, a motion to compel without substantial justification.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subds. (d)-(h).)
The Civil Discovery Act provides for an
escalating and “incremental approach to discovery sanctions, starting with
monetary sanctions and ending with the ultimate sanction of termination.” (Lopez
v. Watchtower Bible & Tract Society of New York, Inc. (2016) 246
Cal.App.4th 566, 604.) Discovery sanctions should be appropriate to and
commensurate with the misconduct, and they “should not exceed that which is
required to protect the interests of the party entitled to but denied
discovery.” (Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th
967, 992.) “If a lesser sanction fails to curb misuse, a greater sanction is
warranted: continuing misuses of the discovery process warrant incrementally
harsher sanctions until the sanction is reached that will curb the abuse.” (Ibid.;
see also, e.g., Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128
Cal.App.4th 262, 279-280.) 
Terminating sanctions should be used
sparingly. (Doppes, supra, 174 Cal.App.4th at p. 992; R.S.
Creative, Inc. v. Creative Cotton, Ltd. (1999) 75 Cal. App. 4th 486,
496.) “Although in extreme cases a court has the authority to order a
terminating sanction as a first measure, a terminating sanction should
generally not be imposed until the court has attempted less severe alternatives
and found them to be unsuccessful and/or the record clearly shows lesser
sanctions would be ineffective.” (Lopez, supra, 246 Cal.App.4th at
p. 604.)  But where discovery violations are “willful, preceded
by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would
not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial court is justified
in imposing the ultimate sanction.” (Doppes, supra, 174 Cal.App.4th
at p. 992.) Repeated and willful violations of discovery orders that prejudice
the opposing party may warrant a terminating sanction. (Creed-21 v. City of
Wildomar (2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 690, 702; Los Defensores, Inc.
v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 377, 390; Biles v. Exxon Mobil
Corp. (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1327; Lang v. Hachman (2000)
77 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246; Collisson X Kaplan v. Hartunian (1994)
21 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1617-1622.)
The primary purpose of discovery sanctions is
to obtain compliance with the Civil Discovery Act and the Court’s orders. It is
not to punish. (Newland v. Super. Ct. (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 608,
613; Ghanooni v. Super Shuttle of Los Angeles (1993) 20
Cal.App.4th 256, 262.) A discovery sanction should not create a “windfall” for
a party or place a party in a better position than it would have been if the
opposing party had simply complied with its obligations under the Court’s
orders and the Civil Discovery Act. (Rutledge v. Hewlett-Packard Co. (2015)
238 Cal.App.4th 1164, 1194; see also 2 Weil & Brown, California Practice
Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2023),
¶¶ 8:2214-2220.)
It is “never justified” for a court to impose
a terminating sanction “solely because of a failure to pay a monetary discovery
sanction.”  (Newland, supra, 40 Cal.App.4th at p.
615.)  
Discussion
Defendant seeks terminating sanctions and
monetary sanctions for Plaintiff’s violation of a court order requiring
Plaintiff to provide responses to interrogatories and requests for production.
Plaintiff has violated a court order and has
refused to comply with his obligations under the Civil Discovery Act.  This is serious discovery abuse warranting
serious sanctions.
For terminating sanctions, however, a party
must generally present evidence of repeated and/or willful misuse of the
discovery process, as well as evidence that less severe sanctions have
not (or likely will not) lead to compliance with the discovery rules.  Defendant has not, on this record at this
time, made such a showing.  There has not been a showing of a history or pattern of
willful abuse or repeated violations that have not been (or cannot be) cured by
lesser sanctions. 
Moreover, a discovery sanction should not
create a “windfall” for a party or place a party in a better position than it
would have been if the opposing party had simply complied with its obligations
under the Court’s orders and the Civil Discovery Act. (Rutledge, supra, 238
Cal.App.4th at p. 1194.)  
Here, at this time, a terminating sanction
would create such a windfall for Defendant.  
Defendant does not seek other nonmonetary
sanctions. 
Defendant also requests monetary sanctions in
the amount of $250.  That request is
granted.  Plaintiff has committed serious
discovery abuse, including violation of a court order.  This conduct warrants monetary
sanctions.  (See Buckner Decl., ¶ 11.) 
Conclusion
The Court DENIES IN PART and GRANTS IN PART the
motion of Defendant AMF Bowling Centers, Inc. for sanctions.
The Court
DENIES Defendant’s request for terminating sanctions. 
The
Court GRANTS Defendant’s request for monetary sanctions.
The
Court ORDERS Plaintiff Jonathan Jimenez to pay monetary sanctions under the
Civil Discovery Act in the amount of $250 to Defendant AMF Bowling Centers,
Inc. within 30 days of notice of this order.
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice.
