And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Defendant Jaylen Whitt's motion to strike the requests for punitive damages and attorney's fees from the prayer for relief in the complaint. The judge found that the complaint does not contain sufficient factual allegations to support a claim for punitive damages against Defendant Jaylen Whitt, as it does not allege facts demonstrating that the defendant intended to cause harm or acted with malice, fraud, or oppression. Additionally, the judge found that the complaint does not plead a sufficient basis for recovery of attorney's fees. The judge granted the motion to strike with leave to amend, allowing the plaintiff to revise the complaint to plead sufficient facts to support a claim for punitive damages and attorney's fees.
