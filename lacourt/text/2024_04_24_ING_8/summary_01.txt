And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings with 20 days' leave to amend. The court found that the plaintiffs failed to name the proper defendant in the First Amended Complaint, which renders the complaint uncertain. The court noted that the plaintiffs' failure to name the proper defendant is not merely a clerical error that can be overlooked, but rather it is a defect that makes the complaint demurrable. The court granted the motion and gave the plaintiffs 20 days to amend their pleading.
