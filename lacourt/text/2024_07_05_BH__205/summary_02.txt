And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

This is a tentative ruling in an unlawful detainer action brought by RAR2-Marina Marketplace LLC against PHENIX SALON SUITES, et al. The plaintiff leased the Premises to the defendants and alleged that they failed to pay rent in the amount of $49,252.06. The defendants, including Joseph Haalberg, demurred to the Complaint on various grounds, including that the Complaint is devoid of facts and that the cause of action for unlawful detainer fails to state any facts evincing all requisite requirements for an unlawful detainer.

The Court finds that the demurrer is procedurally defective because a default judgment was already entered on May 23, 2024, and the only proper motion a defendant may file is a motion to set aside the default judgment. The Court also finds that the demurrer is not a motion to set aside and is, therefore, procedurally improper.

The Court overrules the demurrer and denies leave to amend the Complaint. The Court notes that the burden is on the complainant to show the Court that a pleading can be amended successfully.
