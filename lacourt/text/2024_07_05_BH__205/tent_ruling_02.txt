 Case Number:  24SMCV00933    Hearing Date:   July 5, 2024    Dept:  205    Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles – West District  Beverly Hills Courthouse / Department 205  RAR2-MARINA MARKETPLACE, LLC,   Plaintiff, v.  PHENIX SALON SUITES, et al.,    Defendants.    Case No.:  24SMCV00933     Hearing Date:  July 5, 2024   [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE:   DEFENDANT JOSEPH HAALBERG’S    DEMURRER TO THE COMPLAINT       BACKGROUND  This is an unlawful detainer action.  The real property at issue is located at 13455 Maxella Avenue, Space No. 206-260 also known as Space No. 260B, located in Marina Del Rey in the County of Los Angeles (the “Premises”).  (Compl. ¶ 7.)  Plaintiff RAR2-Marina Marketplace LLC leased the Premises to Phenix Salon Suites, Marina Del Rey, LLC and Doe Defendants (collectively “Defendants”) pursuant to a written commercial lease agreement (“Lease”).  (Id. ¶ 8.)  Under the Lease, Defendants were obligated to pay rent as well as common area operating costs, taxes and other expenses (collectively “Rent”).  (Id. ¶ 10.)  Plaintiff alleges that as of February 14, 2024, Defendants have failed to pay Rent in the amount of $49,252.06.  (Id. ¶ 12.)   On February 15, 2024, Plaintiff caused to be served upon Defendants a written Notice to Pay Rent or Surrender Possession (the “Notice”) by sending the notice to Defendants via FEDEX.  The Notice sets forth the nature of Defendants’ default, requires Defendants to pay the Rent due or deliver possession of the Premises within five days, and states Plaintiff’s election to declare a forfeiture of the Lease.  (Id. ¶ 13.)  More than five days have elapsed since the service of the Notice, but Defendants have not paid the full amount of Rent due nor have they vacated the Premises.  (Id. ¶14.) This action ensued.  Plaintiff filed an unlawful detainer complaint on February 29, 2024.  On March 4, 2024, Plaintiff effected substitute service of the summons and complaint on all unknown occupants and prejudgment claim of right to possession of the Premises by posting and leaving a copy at the Premises with the person in charge.   Defendant Joseph Haalberg, an unknown occupant, filed a motion to quash service of summons which this Court denied.  On May 23, 2024, default judgment was entered against Phenix Salon Suites and all named and unnamed occupants.        This hearing is on Haalberg’s demurrer to the Complaint.  Haalberg demurs to the complaint on the following grounds: (1) the “entire complaint is devoid of any facts or factual allegations, and all of the causes of action are uncertain, unintelligible and ambiguous”, (2) the cause of action for unlawful detainer “fails to state any facts evincing all requisite requirements for an unlawful detainer,” and (3) the unlawful detainer allegations “fail to state and/or is unintelligible and ambiguous as to what constitutes a duly perfected title.”  Haalberg is appearing in pro per.   MEET AND CONFER   In¿unlawful detainer proceedings, there is¿no requirement that a demurring defendant¿meet and confer with the party who filed the pleading being demurred to.  (Code Civ. Proc., §430.41 (d),¿(d)(2)).  Accordingly, there is no consequence to Defendant not having sought to meet and confer with Plaintiff.     LEGAL STANDARD “[A] demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the allegations in a complaint.” (Lewis v. Safeway, Inc. (2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 385, 388.)  A demurrer can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the pleading under attack or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable.  (See Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994 (in ruling on a demurrer, a court may not consider declarations, matters not subject to judicial notice, or documents not accepted for the truth of their contents).)  For purposes of ruling on a demurrer, all facts pleaded in a complaint are assumed to be true, but the reviewing court does not assume the truth of conclusions of law. (Aubry v. Tri-City Hosp. Dist. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 967.)   Leave to amend must be allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (See Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349 (court shall not “sustain a demurrer without leave to amend if there is any reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment”); Kong v. City of Hawaiian Gardens Redevelopment Agency (2002) 108 Cal.App.4th 1028, 1037 (“A demurrer should not be sustained without leave to amend if the complaint, liberally construed, can state a cause of action under any theory or if there is a reasonable possibility the defect can be cured by amendment.”).)  The burden is on the complainant to show the Court that a pleading can be amended successfully. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) DISCUSSION Haalberg’s demurrer is procedurally defective.  A default judgment was already entered on May 23, 2024.  Once a default judgment is entered, the only proper motion a defendant may file is a motion to set aside the default judgment pursuant to Code Civ. Proc. § 473.  (Devlin v. Kearny Mesa AMC/Jeep/Renault, Inc. (1984) 155 Cal.App.3d 381, 385-386¿(defaulted defendant “is out of court and is not entitled to take any further steps in the cause¿affecting plaintiff’s right of action; he cannot thereafter, until such¿default is set aside in a proper proceeding, file pleadings or move for a new trial or demand notice of subsequent proceedings”).)  Haalberg’s demurrer is not a motion to set aside and is, therefore, procedurally improper.   CONCLUSION For the foregoing reasons, the Court OVERRULES Defendant Joseph Haalberg’s demurrer to the Complaint.      IT IS SO ORDERED.  DATED: July 5, 2024    ___________________________ Edward B.
