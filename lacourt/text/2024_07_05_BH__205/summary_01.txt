The Judge, Edward B. Moreton, Jr., has issued a tentative ruling on the Plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to the Defendant's requests for production of documents and for sanctions. The Plaintiff, Camilo Collazos Vallecilla, filed the motion but failed to file a joint statement as required by the court's rules. The Defendant, Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A., Inc., also failed to file the joint statement. As a result, the Judge has denied the Plaintiff's motion to compel further responses without prejudice. The Judge's decision is based on the fact that the Plaintiff did not provide the required information and that the Defendant did not provide a response. The next step is for the parties to re-file the required joint statement and for the Judge to reconsider the motion.
