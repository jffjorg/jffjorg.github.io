The Judge notes that the Board's decision on the administrative appeal is not relevant to the current writ petition. The Judge also addresses the Housing Accountability Act (HAA) and section 65589.5(j)(2), noting that the findings of non-compliance with objective LIP standards for some of the residences are sufficient to disapprove the Project under the HAA. The Judge requests that counsel address the issue of compliance with objective LIP standards at the upcoming hearing.
