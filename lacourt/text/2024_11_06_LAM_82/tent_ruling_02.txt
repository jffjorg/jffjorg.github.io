[1] A previous
development application was denied after a project opponent successfully
appealed the County’s issuance of a mitigated negative declaration under the
California Environmental Quality Act. 
(Opening Brief 3:2-9; AR 8313-8325.) 
The Board’s decision on that administrative appeal is not at issue in
this writ petition.  


[2] Respondents confusingly
cite subdivision (d) of section 65589.5, but the reference to “objective
general plan, zoning and subdivision standards” suggests that Respondents meant
to cite subdivision (j).  Also, subdivision
(d) only applies to a housing development project “for very low, low-, or moderate-income households” or to an
“emergency shelter,” neither of which pertains to the Project.  
 


[3] Petitioners do not argue that Respondents failed to comply
with section 65589.5(j)(2).


[4] Since the HAA applies to the entire
15-residence development and since Petitioner applied to build the entire
Project, it stands to reason that the findings of non-compliance with objective
LIP standards for some of the residences are sufficient to disapprove the
Project under the HAA.  However, Counsel
should address that issue at the hearing, as neither party has briefed it.
