 Case Number:  24STCV13470    Hearing Date:   November 6, 2024    Dept:  82 Texmark
Land, Inc. v. Eloges, Inc., et al.
Case No. 24STCV13470
[Tentative] Order Granting Application for
Writ of Attachment
 
            Plaintiff Texmark Land, Inc. (“Plaintiff”) moves for a writ of attachment
against Defendant Eloges, Inc. (“Defendant”) in the amount of $48,953.70.  Defendant has not filed an opposition.  Plaintiff has satisfied all of the statutory
requirements.  In particular, Plaintiff
has established probable validity of its claim. 
The application is based on
Plaintiff’s cause of action for breach of contract.  To establish a claim for breach of
contract or breach of guaranty, a plaintiff must prove: (1) the existence of a
contract; (2) plaintiff’s performance or excuse for nonperformance; (3)
defendant’s breach of the contract; and (4) damages incurred by plaintiff as a
result of the breach.  (Durell v. Sharp Healthcare (2010) 183
Cal.App.4th 1350, 1367.)  
 
Plaintiff sells
fabrics throughout California, and Defendant is a clothing manufacturing
company located in Los Angeles.  (Soo Mi
Ko Decl. ¶¶ 2, 6.)  From October 2021 to
August 2022, Plaintiff sold fabrics to Defendant through a series of purchase
orders and invoices.  Plaintiff has made
delivery of the goods and thereby performed its obligations under the purchase
orders.   Defendant made a partial
payment of $1,555.80 for one of the invoices. 
However, Defendant has failed to timely pay the remaining balance due of
$43,853.70 pursuant to the terms of the purchase orders.  (Id. ¶¶ 1-15, Exh. 1-13.)  Plaintiff is also entitled to attorney’s fees
and costs in an enforcement action pursuant to the terms of the purchase
orders.  (Id. Exh. 1-13.)  This evidence shows that Plaintiff probably
has a valid contract claim in the amount of $48,953.70.  Plaintiff
reasonably estimates that it has or will incur at least $5,000 in attorney’s
fees and $100 in costs in this action. 
(Application ¶ 8.)  However, the
application and proposed order seek to attach only $48,953.70.      
 
Based upon the foregoing, the court orders as
follows:
 
1.         The
court grants Plaintiff’s application for a writ of attachment in the amount of $48,953.70.
 
2.         The
court orders Plaintiff to post an undertaking of $10,000.
 
3.         Plaintiff’s
counsel shall provide notice and file proof of service with the court.
