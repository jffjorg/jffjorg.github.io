Association v. Susanna X. Kirakosyan, et al.
Case No.
24STCV20268
[Tentative]
Preliminary Injunction
 
            LC Acres
Residents Association (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Susana X.
Kirakosyan (“Defendant”), among others, asserting a breach of applicable
Covenants, Conditions, and Restrictions (“CC&Rs”).  Defendant obtained title to Lot 30 of Tract
12843, commonly known as 826 Green Lane, La Canada Flintridge, California 91011
(the “Property”) on or about April 11, 2022. 
(Declaration of Susanne Whatley-Miller, ¶ 5; see also Request for
Judicial Notice, Exh. 2.)  The applicable
CC&Rs limited houses to one story. 
(See Request for Judicial Notice, Exh. 1.)  On or about March 28, 2023, the Planning
Commission for the City of La Canada Flintridge (the “City”) reviewed
Defendant’s application to demolish the existing house and construct a 6,745
square-foot two-story residence with an exposed lower/third level.   (See id.,
Exh. 3.)  The Planning Commission
approved the project but noted that it would still be subject to the
CC&Rs.  (Ibid.)  This action follows.  Previously, the court granted a temporary
restraining order preventing construction until this lawsuit is resolved.  Now, the court issues a preliminary
injunction on the same terms.
            
The purpose of a preliminary
injunction is to preserve the status quo pending a decision on the
merits.  (Major v. Miraverde Homeowners Ass’n. (1992) 7 Cal. App.
4th 618, 623.)  In deciding whether to grant relief, the court looks to
two factors, including “(1) the likelihood that the plaintiff will prevail on
the merits, and (2) the relative balance of harms that is likely to result from
the granting or denial of interim injunctive relief.”  (White v. Davis
(2003) 30 Cal.4th 528, 553-54.)  The factors are interrelated, with a
greater showing on one permitting a lesser showing on the other.  (Dodge,
Warren & Peters Ins. Services, Inc. v. Riley (2003) 105 Cal.App.4th
1414, 1420.)  However, the party seeking an injunction must demonstrate at
least a reasonable probability of success on the merits.  (IT Corp. v.
County of Imperial (1983) 35 Cal.3d 63, 73-74.)  The party seeking the
injunction bears the burden of demonstrating both a likelihood of success on
the merits and the occurrence of irreparable harm.  (Savage v. Trammell
Crow Co. (1990) 223 Cal.App.3d 1562, 1571.) 
      
            The court
finds that the balance of harms favors Plaintiff.  Once construction commences, it will be
difficult to reverse course should Plaintiff prevail in this action.  Defendant would have incurred all of the
construction costs, and Plaintiff would have endured the effects of the
construction.  Moreover, once Defendant
demolishes the existing house, she cannot easily restore the status quo;
she would have to construct an new house with new approvals.  By contrast, Defendant does not demonstrate
sufficient harm in waiting until this action is resolved to begin the
demolition and construction.
 
            Defendant
does not demonstrate a sufficient likelihood of success on the merits.  The CC&Rs are clear: Defendant cannot build
a second story on a house in Tract 12843. 
Defendant should have received notice of the CC&Rs when she acquired
the property.  Defendant argues that five
other houses in Tract 12843 have second stories, but this evidence does not
persuade the court that Defendant probably will establish a waiver of the
CC&Rs for multiple reasons. 
Plaintiff disputes the actual number, arguing that it is less than five
houses.  Defendant concedes that
Plaintiff was only formed and incorporated on May 8, 2024; Defendant provides
no evidence that any of the second stores was added within the past six months;
and, therefore, Defendant does not establish that “Plaintiff is in breach of
the very CC&Rs which it purports to enforce.”  Finally, five houses is not enough to
demonstrate a sufficient likelihood of success on the merits, given that the
balance of harms favors Plaintiff.
 
            Defendant makes
a series of other arguments which are not persuasive.  Defendant argues that there are 13 houses
with second stories within 800 feet of Defendant’s property, but the CC&Rs
are limited to Track 12843.  Defendant
argues that Plaintiff has not complied with the Davis-Stirling Act (the
“Act”).  The Act regulates common
interest developments, such as a community apartment project, a condominium
project, a planned development, or a cooperative.  (See Committee to Save Beverly Highlands
Homes Ass’n v. Beverly Highlands Homes Ass’n (2001) 92 Cal.App.4th 1247,
1262; see also Civ. Code §§ 4100, 4201.) 
Defendant does not establish that the Act governs this case.    
 
            Based upon
the foregoing, the court orders as follows:
 
            1.         The court issues a preliminary
injunction ordering that the construction may not commence until this lawsuit
is resolved.
 
            2.         Plaintiff’s counsel shall lodge a
proposed preliminary injunction for the court’s signature forthwith.
 
            3.         Plaintiff’s counsel shall provide
notice and file proof of service with the court.
