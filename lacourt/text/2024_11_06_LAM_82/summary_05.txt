And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Santander Consumer USA's application for a writ of possession against Christopher Coiro. The Judge finds that the Plaintiff failed to file proof of service demonstrating that it served the summons and complaint, as well as the application for writ of possession and supporting pleadings, on the Defendant. As a result, the Judge orders that the application for writ of possession be denied without prejudice, and that the court's clerk serve a copy of the order on the Plaintiff's counsel. Since the Defendant was never served, further notice is not required.
