[Tentative] Order Denying Petition for
Writ of Mandate
 
[Tentative]
Order Transferring Case to Department One for Reassignment
            
INTRODUCTION 
 
Petitioner
California Pacific Homes, Inc. (“Petitioner”) filed a verified petition and
complaint against the County of Los Angeles (the “County”) and the Board of
Supervisors (the “Board”) (collectively, “Respondent”).  Petitioner submitted an application to the
County to construct 15 new single-family residences on 18 lots within the Santa
Monica Mountains Coastal Zone.  The
project would encroach into the protected zones of 119 oaks and nine other
native trees.  Petitioner’s project
required 12 variances falling within six categories: (1) Construction of an
onsite wastewater treatment system (“OWTS”) less than 50 feet from a protected
tree and less than 150 feet from a riparian canopy of streambed; (2)
Construction of guest houses within a protected zone; (3) Construction of guest
houses that would share the OWTS with primary residences; (4) Construction of
structures with less than the required buffer from parkland; (5) Construction
of structures that occupy more than 50 percent of the linear frontage of a
parcel fronting a scenic route; and (6) Construction of driveways or access
roads greater than 300 feet in length.  Petitioner’s
representatives met with the County’s planning staff on 11 occasions between
2019 and 2021.  Eventually, the County
requested that Petitioner change the proposed project as follows: (1) Remove
the guest houses planned for each single-family residence; (2) Reduce the size
and/or change the location of several residences; (3) Relocate several of the
onsite wastewater treatment systems; and (4) Build fewer than 15 residences and
merge certain lots.  Petitioner refused
to do so.  
 
The case proceeded
before a hearing officer, who denied the project because: (1) Petitioner did
not satisfy the required burden of proof for the variances; (2) Several
proposed residences did not comply with design requirements; and (3) The
project conflicted with the goals and policies of preserving habitats and
scenic resources and was not compatible with rural surroundings.  Petitioner appealed this decision to the
Regional Planning Commission and then the Board, which upheld the hearing
officer’s decision.  Now, Petitioner
asserts four causes of action: (1) Writ of mandate for violation of the Housing
Accountability Act, Government Code section 65589.5; (2) Writ of mandate for
violation of Code of Civil Procedure sections 1094.5 and/or 1085; (3) Inverse
condemnation; and (4) Declaratory judgment. 
The court denies the petition for writs of mandate because the Board
made sufficient findings, supported by substantial evidence, that Petitioner
did not comply with the requirements. 
The court declines to issue a declaratory judgment and transfers the
inverse condemnation claim to Department One for reassignment to an independent
calendar court.
BACKGROUND 
 
A.        The
Project Site
 
The
Project site is located on Piuma Road in Monte Nido, an unincorporated
community in the Santa Monica Mountains. 
(AR 5145, 8224, 8921-27.)  In
January 1983, the County approved Tentative Tract Map 38931 (“TTM 38931”)
creating 22 residential lots on the Project site.  (AR 8238-8256.)  The California Coastal Commission (the “Coastal
Commission”) issued Coastal Development Permit 5-83-4 in July 1983, ratifying
the County approval of TTM 38931 and allowing grading.  (AR 8224-8237.)  The Coastal Commission later approved a
coastal development permit for construction of a single-family residence on one
of the lots of TTM 38931 on November 13, 2008.  (AR 5402-5434.)  The remaining lots on the Project sites have
been graded but are not developed.  (See
AR 8921-27, 5315.)  
 
Vintage
Pacific at Monte Nido LLC acquired the Project site in or about 2011.  (See AR 2-6, 464.)  Petitioner states that it is “an authorized
representative for CDB Investments, L.P., which is the managing member of
Vintage Pacific at Monte Nido LLC, owner of the Property.” (Petition for Writ
of Mandate (“Pet.”) ¶ 4.)  
 
B.        The
Santa Monica Mountains Local Coastal Program
 
On
or around August 26, 2014, the County adopted the Santa Monica Mountains Local
Coastal Program (the “LCP”) through the amendment of the Santa Monica Mountains
Local Implementation Program (the “LIP”) and the Santa Monica Mountains Land
Use Plan (the “LUP”). (AR 5450-5456, 8335-8494, 8495-8887.)  The LCP was established to implement the
Coastal Act within the Santa Monica Mountains Coastal Zone, pursuant to
California Public Resources Code section 30500. (AR 5450-5456.)  Pursuant to Los Angeles County Ordinance
section 22.44.620, “[p]rotection of Significant Environmental Resource Areas
(SERAs) (H1 and H2 Habitats) and public access shall take priority over other
LIP development standards.” (AR 8496 [County of Los Angeles County Ordinance
[“LACC”], 22.44.620].)
 
C.        Petitioner’s
Proposed Project 
 
On
or about April 3, 2019, Petitioner submitted an application to the County
Department of Regional Planning (“Regional Planning”) for 15 coastal
development permits (“CDPs”) to construct 15 new single-family residences on the
Project site.  (AR 5314, 5317.)[1]  The lots that Petitioner seeks to develop
are numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 13, 14, 15/16, and 17 through 21.  (AR 5314.) 
The Project proposed encroachments
into the protected zones of 119 oaks and nine other native trees.  (AR 5314.) 

 
Petitioner
requested 12 variances for the following: (1) construction of an onsite
wastewater treatment system (“OWTS”) less than 50 feet from an oak or other
protected native tree or less than 150 feet from a riparian canopy or streambed;
(2) construction of habitable accessory structures (guest houses) within the H1
Habitat Buffer or H1 Habitat Quiet Zone; (3) construction of habitable
accessory structures (guest houses) that share an OWTS
with the primary residence; (4) construction
of new structures with less than the required 100-foot buffers from parkland;
(5) construction of new structures that occupy more than 50 percent of the linear
frontage of a parcel fronting a scenic route (Piuma Road); and (6) construction
of driveways or access roads greater than 300 feet in length.  (AR 5314-5315.)  
 
The total Project site is 18.2 acres.  Each lot
contains a graded pad of approximately 12,000 square feet.  One single-family residence, attached garage,
and OWTS is proposed for each lot, except for one single-family residence,
attached garage, and OWTS that would span Lots 15 and 16.  Four of the lots (Lots 1, 2, 4, and 18) would
also contain detached habitable
accessory structures (guest houses).  The average residential square footage for
each residence is 5,386 square feet.  (AR
5315.)
 
D.        The
County Requests Changes to the Project
 
The
County’s Regional Planning Staff (the “Staff”) met with Petitioner approximately
11 times from 2019 to 2021 to discuss the Project.  During these meetings, the Staff requested that
Petitioner redesign the Project to eliminate most variances and inconsistencies
with the LIP standards.  (AR 5317.) 
 
In August
2021, the County Environmental Review Board (“ERB”) reviewed the Project and did
not make a motion regarding consistency with the LCP.  Instead, the ERB indicated that it “would like the project
to come back presented as a complete project, better defined, and with efforts
to be consistent with LIP.”  (Ibid.; see also AR 2013-2018
[ERB minutes].)
 
On April
14, 2022, Amy Bodek, Director of Regional Planning, sent a letter to Petitioner
requesting several specific changes to the Project and providing notice that
failure to incorporate changes would result in a denial of the Project.  (AR 8131-8143.)  These changes included the following: (1) removing
the guest houses, (2) reducing the size and/or changing the location of several
residences, (3) relocating several of the OWTS, and (4) proposing fewer
residences by merging lots.  (Ibid.;
see also AR 5317.) 
 
In a
letter dated May 13, 2022, Petitioner’s attorney stated that Petitioner
declined to incorporate the changes requested by Regional Planning.  (AR 8144-8148, 5317.)  As relevant to this writ petition,
Petitioner’s attorney also stated the following:
 
[T]he
Project came to a screeching halt when Staff released its report for the August
16, 2021, ERB hearing. The Staff Report revealed Staff’s position that no
viable project could be constructed due to unavoidable fuel modification
impacts to H1 habitat. (Biological Resources Description and Recommendations,
Oaks at Monte Nido, 2019-00686-(3) (Aug. 16, 2021).) …. 
 
After the ERB hearing, [Petitioner]
requested an urgent meeting with Staff and the
representatives of the LACFD Fuel
Modification Unit to attempt to confirm the change in
the collective understanding of the fuel
modification zones for the Project. That meeting
occurred on October 25, 2021, and included
Staff and certain members of the LACFD
Fuel
Modification Unit. The meeting further revealed to [Petitioner] that neither
Staff nor LACFD intended to honor what [Petitioner] had considered to be a
settled interpretation of Zones B and C that avoids fuel modification thinning
impacts in H1 Habitat.
 
…. In subsequent
meetings with [Petitioner], after being pressed, Staff definitively confirmed
to [Petitioner] that avoidance of H1 was not possible, and that, therefore nothing
could be constructed on any of [Petitioner’s] approved and graded lots.
 
(AR
8145-8146 [bold italics in original].)
 
E.         Administrative
Hearings and Decision 
 
After Petitioner refused to make the
recommended changes, the Staff scheduled the Project for a hearing before a
hearing officer.  After a hearing held on
October 4, 2022, November 1, 2022, and February 7, 2023, the hearing officer
denied the Project application with findings. 
(AR 5317, 3191-3356.)  
 
On February 13, 2023, Petitioner
appealed the hearing officer’s decision to the Regional Planning Commission (the
“Commission”).  (AR 5317, 5310-5311, 5572.)
 On April 26, 2023, after a public
hearing, the Commission denied Petitioner’s appeal and Petitioner’s application
for a CDP for each of the 15 single-family residences in the Project.  The Commission issued detailed findings in
support of its decision.  (AR 5142-5309, 5572,
5317.)
 
On April 28, 2023, Petitioner
appealed the Commission’s decision to the Board.  (AR 5318; see also AR 5310-5313
[Petitioner’s appeal] and AR 5328-5343 [Petitioner’s counsel letter to Board].)  The Board held a public hearing on the appeal
on September 19, 2023.  (AR 5318, 5546-5547.)  After hearing from Regional Planning staff,
Petitioner, and members of the public, the Board unanimously voted to deny the
appeal.  (AR 7947-7971
[transcript].)  Because the County
Counsel did not prepare new findings for the Board within the time permitted by
County ordinance, the decision and findings of the Commission were affirmed by
operation of law.  (See Opening
Brief (“OB”) 6:23-26 and Pet. ¶ 38; LACC § 22.44.1040.E.5, 6; and AR 8204-8205,
8586-85887.)  
 
STANDARD OF REVIEW
 
The petition
includes two causes of action for writ of administrative mandate pursuant to
Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5.  The first cause of action seeks to enforce the Housing
Accountability Act (the “HAA”).  (See Pet.
¶¶ 39-47.)  The HAA requires that, “[a]ny
action brought to enforce the provisions of this section shall be brought
pursuant to Section 1094.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure. . . .”  (Gov. Code § 65589.5(m)(1).)  Under the HAA, the court’s task “is therefore
to determine whether the [County] ‘proceeded in the manner required by law,’
with a decision supported by the findings, and findings supported by the
evidence; if not, the [County] abused its discretion.”  (Cal. Renters Legal Advocacy and Education
Fund v. City of San Mateo (2021) 68 Cal.App.5th
820, 837.)  The County “bear[s] the burden of proof that
its decision has conformed to all of the conditions specified in Section
65589.5.” 
(Gov. Code § 65589.6.)  
 
The second cause of action contends that the Board’s decision to deny
the Project under the LCP and the County’s zoning laws was an abuse of
discretion.  (Pet. ¶¶ 49-50.)  “Where, as here, a land use decision is challenged by administrative
mandamus, courts are to apply the substantial evidence standard of review.” (Toigo v. Town of Ross (1998) 70
Cal.App.4th 309, 317.)  Substantial evidence is relevant evidence that a reasonable mind might
accept as adequate to support a conclusion (California
Youth Authority v. State Personnel Board (2002) 104 Cal. App. 4th 575,
584-85), or evidence of ponderable legal significance which is reasonable in
nature, credible and of solid value. (Mohilef
v. Janovici (1996) 51 Cal. App. 4th 267, 305 n. 28.)  Under this standard of review, “[c]ourts may
reverse an [administrative] decision only if, based on the evidence …, a
reasonable person could not reach the conclusion reached by the agency.”  (Sierra
Club v. California Coastal Com. (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 602, 610.)   Petitioner bears the burden of proof on the
second cause of action and must demonstrate, by citation to the administrative
record, that the evidence does not support the administrative findings.  (Strumsky
v. San Diego County Employees Retirement Assn. (1974) 11 Cal.3d 28, 32; Shenouda v. Veterinary Medical Bd. (2018) 27 Cal.App.5th 500, 513; Toigo, supra, 70 Cal.App.4th at
317.)  
 
DISCUSSION  
 
A.        Respondent Complied with
the Housing Accountability Act 
 
Petitioner
contends that the Board failed to make the findings required by section
65589.5(j) of the HAA in order to disapprove of the Project.  (OB 13-15.) 
Respondent makes two arguments. 
First, Respondent argues that the HAA does not apply to single-family
residential units.  Second, Respondent
argues that “the County has met the obligations under the HAA by determining
that the Project is not consistent with the City’s objective general plan,
zoning and subdivision standards, or that the Project will have a specific
adverse impact to public health and safety that cannot be mitigated.”  (Oppo. 21-22.)[2]
 
Assuming
the HAA applies to the Project, Respondent complied with its requirements.  Petitioner contends that the County failed
to comply with section 65589.5(j)(1)(A) and (B) of the HAA.[3]  The statute states in relevant part as
follows: 
 
(j)(1) When a proposed
housing development project complies with applicable, objective
general plan, zoning, and subdivision standards and criteria, including
design review standards, in effect at the time that the application was
deemed complete, but the local agency proposes to disapprove the project or to
impose a condition that the project be developed at a lower density, the local
agency shall base its decision regarding the proposed housing development
project upon written findings supported by a preponderance of the evidence on
the record that both of the following conditions exist:
 
(A)  The housing development
project would have a specific, adverse impact upon the public health or safety
unless the project is disapproved or approved upon the condition that the
project be developed at a lower density….
 
(B)  There is no feasible
method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the adverse impact identified
pursuant to paragraph (1) ….
 
(emphasis
added.)  The HAA defines “objective” as “involving
no personal or subjective judgment by a public official and being uniformly
verifiable by reference to an external and uniform benchmark or criterion
available and knowable by both the development applicant or proponent and the
public official.”  (Gov. Code §
65589.5(h)(9).) 
 
            Respondent has the burden of
establishing compliance with the HAA.
 
[I]nstead of asking, as
is common in administrative mandamus actions, whether the City’s findings are
supported by substantial evidence, we inquire whether there is substantial
evidence that would allow a reasonable person to conclude that the housing development
project complies with pertinent standards. 
As the public entity that disapproved the project, the City bears the
burden of proof that its decision conformed to the HAA.
 
(California Renters Legal Advocacy and Education Fund
v. City of San Mateo (2021) 68 Cal.App.5th 820, 837
[hereafter, “CARLA”], internal quotations and citations omitted.)  Here, the Board found that certain residences in the Project
did not comply with objective design standards of the LIP, including: (1) maximum building site area of 10,000 square
feet (County Code Section 22.44.1910 I); (2) maximum structural height of 18
feet in a Scenic Resource Area (County Code Section 22.44.1250); and (3)
maximum height of six feet for retaining walls within a Scenic Resource Area
(County Code 22.44.1240).  (See AR
5316, 5142-5309.)[4]  These design standards are objective because
they involve “no personal or subjective judgment by a public official” and are
“uniformly verifiable by reference to an external and uniform benchmark or
criterion available and knowable by both the development applicant or proponent
and the 


 
public
official.”  (Gov. Code §
65589.5(h)(9).)  For certain of the proposed residences, the Board
also found as follows:
 
·      
“[T]he Project design is not compatible
with surrounding environmental resources, as it would result in development of
H1 Habitat”
 
·      
“[T]he development is not the minimum
necessary development for the site, as required within an H1 Quiet Zone or H1
Habitat Buffer by the LIP” 
 
·      
“[T]he LIP specifically prohibits OWTS
seepage pits or leach fields to be placed within 50 feet of the canopy of an
oak tree or within 150 feet of a riparian canopy or streambed.” 
 
 (See
e.g. AR 5161-5163, 5172-5174, 5286-5287.) 
These development standards from the LCP also appear to be
objective.  The parties have not cited,
and the court has not found, substantial that would allow a reasonable person to conclude that
the housing development project complies with the pertinent, objective standards.  (Gov. Code §
65589.5(f)(4).)  Accordingly,
because the Project did not satisfy applicable, objective zoning and design standards from the
LIP and LCP, Respondents were not required to
make the additional findings of section 65589.5(j)(1) to
deny the Project.  (See CARLA, supra, 68 Cal.App.5th at 838.)  
 
In
reply, Petitioner argues that the “variances [requested] in this case are a
normalized, codified channel for relief under the LCP” and that the County has
discretion to approve or conditionally approve the variances requested by
Petitioner.  (Reply 8-9.)  As Petitioner implicitly acknowledges,
variances are not “objective general plan, zoning, and
subdivision standards and criteria” subject to subdivision (j)(1).  Petitioner seems to contend that the availability of
a discretionary exception to an objective zoning standard renders the standard
non-objective under the HAA.  Petitioner cites no authority for this position,
which conflicts with the plain language and purpose of the HAA. 
If a project does not comply with an applicable, objective
standard, section 65589.5(j)(1) does not impose additional
duties on the County with respect to its discretionary decision to grant or
deny a variance.   
 
Based
on the foregoing, Respondent has proven compliance the HAA.  Because Respondent complied with the HAA, the
court does not reach Petitioner’s contention that the County acted in bad faith
within the meaning of the HAA.  (OB 15.)  The first cause of action is denied.  
 
B.        Petitioner Has Not Shown an Abuse of
Discretion by the Board  
 
            Petitioner’s second
cause of action alleges that the Board’s decision to deny the Project
constituted an abuse of discretion.  (See
Pet. ¶¶ 49-50.)  For this cause of action, Petitioner “must
identify (with citations to the record) the factual findings made by the board
that he or she is challenging and demonstrate (with citations to the record)
why those factual findings were [not supported by] the evidence.”  (Shenouda
v. Veterinary Medical Bd. (2018)
27 Cal.App.5th 500, 513.)  When the
petitioner challenges “the sufficiency of the evidence, all material evidence
on the point must be set forth and not merely [its] own evidence.” (Toigo v.
Town of Ross (1998) 70 Cal.App.4th 309, 317.)  “Failure to do so amounts to waiver of the
alleged error and we may presume that the record contains evidence to sustain
every finding of fact.”  (Ibid.; accord
Desmond v. County of Contra
Costa (1993) 21 Cal.App.4th 330,
335-336 [“it is presumed that the findings and actions of the administrative
agency were supported by substantial evidence”].)  
 
Here, the
Commission made detailed findings explaining why Petitioner did not satisfy the
requirements of the LCP and County zoning laws for each of the 15 single-family
residences for which Petitioner applied for CDPs and other land use
entitlements.  (AR 5142-5309.)  As
Petitioner acknowledges, the Board adopted the Commission’s findings and
decision by operation of law.  (See OB
6:23-26 and Pet. ¶ 38; LACC § 22.44.1040.E.5, 6.)  
 
In its writ
briefing, Petitioner does not identify the administrative findings that it
challenges or to explain why those findings are not supported by substantial
evidence in the record.  Nor has
Petitioner identified all material evidence that supports the Board’s findings,
as required for a petition of this nature. 
Rather than discuss the Commission and the Board’s detailed decisions
and findings with respect to each of the 15 CDPs and proposed residences,
Petitioner’s writ briefing focuses on certain issues (including, whether denial
of the Project was a takings) that were not decided by the Commission or the
Board.  (See OB 7-13.)  Accordingly, Petitioner has not met its
initial burden to show a prejudicial abuse of discretion in the administrative
findings and decision.  (See CCP §
1094.5(b); Shenouda, supra, 27 Cal.App.5th at 513; Toigo, supra, 70 Cal.App.4th at
317.)  
 
Nor could
Petitioner successfully do so.  Because
Petitioner is challenging a denial, it has a high burden:    
 
Because [the court is]
reviewing a denial of a requested land
use permit, it is not necessary to determine that each finding by the Board was supported by
substantial evidence.  As long as the
Board made a finding that any one of the necessary elements enumerated in the
ordinances was lacking, and this finding was itself supported by substantial
evidence, the Board’s denial of appellant’s application must be upheld. 
 
(Desmond, supra, 21 Cal.App.4th at 336-337, emphasis in original.)  Staff reports, staff opinions, and
statements made by area residents that are based on relevant personal
observations or that involve nontechnical issues may constitute substantial
evidence sufficient to support a finding. 
(See e.g. Young v. City of Coronado (2017) 10 Cal.App.5th 408,
428; Bowman v. City of Berkeley (2004) 122 Cal.App.4th 572, 583.)
 
Here, the Board made findings, supported by substantial evidence, that the
necessary elements for approval of the Project were lacking, including the following:
 
1.         Design
Standards and the LIP
 
The Board found
that many of the proposed residences do not comply with the design standards of
the Santa Monica Mountains Local Implementation Program (“LIP”), including: (1)
maximum building site area of 10,000 square feet (County Code Section
22.44.1910 I); (2) maximum structural height of 18 feet in a Scenic Resource
Area (County Code Section 22.44.1250); (3) maximum height of six feet for
retaining walls within a Scenic Resource Area (County Code 22.44.1240); and (4)
development within 100 feet of riparian vegetation is only allowed when it is
the minimum amount of development necessary to provide a reasonable economic
use of the property and there is no feasible alternative (County Code Section
22.44.1340 A.1).  (See AR 5316, 5142-5309.)  Specifically,
lots 1,
4, 6, 7, 13, 14, 15/16, and 17-21 do not conform with one or more of the
foregoing design standards.  (AR 5316.)  
 
These findings are
supported by substantial evidence in the record, including Project design plans,
staff reports, and testimony by Regional Planning staff.  (See e.g. AR 3497-4831 [staff report,
which includes design plans], 5314-5316 [summary staff report], 7948-7950
[testimony of Bodek].)  Petitioner has
not addressed these findings or the supporting evidence.  Accordingly, Petitioner has not shown a
prejudicial abuse of discretion.    
 
2.         The
Santa Monica Mountains Local Coastal Program 
 
The Board found
that the Project conflicts with goals and policies of the LCP, including
sensitive habitat preservation, preservation of scenic resources, and
compatibility with rural surroundings. 
(AR 5316, 5142-5309.)  As examples, for certain of the proposed
residences, the Board found that:
 
·       “[T]he Project
design is not compatible with surrounding environmental resources, as it would
result in development of H1 Habitat” 
 
·       “[T]he development
is not the minimum necessary development for the site, as required within an H1
Quiet Zone or H1 Habitat Buffer by the LIP” 
 
·       “[T]he LIP
specifically prohibits OWTS seepage pits or leach fields to be placed within 50
feet of the canopy of an oak tree or within 150 feet of a riparian canopy or
streambed.” 
 
(See e.g. AR
5161-5163, 5172-5174, 5286-5287.)  These
findings are supported by substantial evidence in the record, including Project
design plans, staff reports, testimony by Regional Planning staff, and written
comments and oral testimony of members of the community.  (See e.g. AR 3497-4831, 5314-5316, 7947-7971.)  Petitioner
has not addressed these findings or the supporting evidence.  Accordingly, Petitioner has not shown a
prejudicial abuse of discretion.    
 
3.         Variance
Findings 
 
The Board also
found that Petitioner did not meet the burden of proof for the variances
requested because: (1) Petitioner did not demonstrate that there were unique
circumstances or special characteristics of the lots that required variances to
preserve substantial property rights; and (2) Petitioner did not demonstrate
that it was infeasible to redesign the Project to eliminate many, if not all,
of the variances.  (AR 5316, 5142-5309.)  As examples, the Board found: “It has not
been demonstrated that OWTS seepage pits cannot be placed in a location more
than 50 feet from the dripline of an oak tree.” 
(AR 5174.)  For certain
residences, the Board also found:  
 
The Commission finds that the LIP specifically
prohibits habitable accessory structures within H1 Habitat Buffers and H1 Quiet
Zones, as development within these zones is only allowed when it is required to
provide the landowner a minimum reasonable economic use of the property (County
Code Sections 22.44.1370 D.10 and 22.44.1890 D and E). Habitable accessory
structures are also required to have an OWTS separate from the primary
residence (County Code Section 22.44.1370 D.8). The Department of Public Health’s
Environmental Health Division, which is responsible for the review of OWTS, has
not approved any arrangements for the sharing of an OWTS by both structures. It
has also not been demonstrated that the placement of two separate OWTS on the
Project Site is infeasible, nor would it be necessary to allow reasonable
economic use of the property. As stated above, because a single-family
residence alone would provide a reasonable economic use, it cannot be
demonstrated that a variance is necessary to preserve a substantial property
right (see “Variance Findings” below)….
 
[¶¶]
 
The proposed habitable accessory structure is not
necessary to allow for a reasonable economic use of the property. The design of
the residence could be modified to reduce the building site area. It has also
not been demonstrated that this structure cannot be proposed in a location
outside of the H1 Quiet Zone or designed to utilize a separate OWTS.
 
(AR 5152-5153.)  The Board’s variance findings are supported
by substantial evidence in the record, including Project design plans, staff
reports, and testimony by Regional Planning staff.  (See e.g. (See e.g. AR
3497-4831, 5314-5316, 7947-7971.)  Petitioner has not addressed these findings
or the supporting evidence.  Accordingly,
Petitioner has not shown a prejudicial abuse of discretion.    
 
            C.        The
Court Declines to Issue a Declaratory Judgment 
 
In the fourth cause of action, Petitioner seeks declaratory relief.  (Pet. ¶¶ 60-63.)  This court declines to issue a declaratory judgment
because Petitioner has an adequate remedies by virtue of the other causes of
action.  “The object of the
statute is to afford a new form of relief where needed and not to furnish a
litigant with a second cause of action for the determination of identical
issues.”  (General of America Ins. Co.
v. Lilly (1968) 258 Cal.App.2d 465, 470.) 
A
declaratory relief action is
inappropriate when a plaintiff has an adequate remedy on other causes of action
at trial.  (See Hood v. Superior Court (1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 319, 324; California
Ins. Guarantee Assn. v. Superior Court (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 1617,
1624.)  
 
D.        The Inverse Condemnation Claim Is Not
Properly Before this Court 
 
            Petitioner’s third cause of
action—for inverse condemnation—alleges that “[b]y improperly denying the
Project, Respondents have refused to allow any economically viable or
beneficial use of the Property,” which constitutes a regulatory taking.  (See Pet. ¶¶ 54-55.)  In its 


 
opening brief,
Petitioner argues that the LCP forecloses development of any habitable
structures on the lots, depriving Petitioner of all economically beneficial use
of its land.  Petitioner argues: 
 
[T]here is no point on any of the CPH Lots far enough
from H1 Habitat boundaries to allow avoidance of fuel modification thinning in
H1 Habitat or buffer.  Not even a
structure as small as a broom closet could have been installed on any of the
CPH Lots without fuel modification zones emanating into H1 Habitat areas.  
 
(OB: 10-11.)  Petitioner argues that the County has
transformed its private property into public property without compensation,
citing Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council, 505 U.S. 1031 (1992).  In the alternative, Petitioner argues that
land use restrictions, as those in this case, may constitute a taking even if
they do not deprive Petitioner of all economically beneficial or productive
uses, citing Penn Central Transportation Co. v. City of New York, 438
U.S. 104 (1978).
 
            Per Local Rules 2.8(d) and 2.9, Department
82 handles only writs of mandate and other “special proceedings,” which do not
include inverse condemnation claims.  Such
claims involve discovery, pretrial litigation, and trials with witnesses and exhibits,
all of which are handled in the independent calendar courts.  At the trial setting conference, the court
only set trial on the petition for writ of mandate.  (See Court’s Minute Order, dated May 17,
2024.)  Having decided those claims, the
court now transfers the case to Department One for reassignment to an
independent calendar court for the only remaining cause of action: The inverse
condemnation claim.   
 
CONCLUSION AND
ORDER     
 
            Based upon
the foregoing, the court orders as follows:
 
            1.         The court denies the first and second
causes of action, which seek a writ of administrative mandate.  
 
            2.         The court declines to issue a
declaratory judgment on the fourth cause of action.  
 
            3.         The court transfers the case to Department
One for reassignment to an independent calendar court for the only remaining
cause of action: The third cause of action, which asserts an inverse
condemnation claim.  
 
            4.         The
court’s clerk shall provide notice. 
 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED
