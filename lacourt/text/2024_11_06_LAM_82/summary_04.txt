And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of LC Acres Residents Association v. Susanna X. Kirakosyan, et al. The plaintiff, LC Acres Residents Association, is seeking a preliminary injunction to prevent the defendant, Susanna X. Kirakosyan, from demolishing the existing house and constructing a two-story residence on Lot 30 of Tract 12843.

The judge has found that the balance of harms favors the plaintiff. If the defendant is allowed to proceed with the construction, it will be difficult to reverse course should the plaintiff prevail in the action. On the other hand, if the plaintiff is allowed to prevail, the defendant will have incurred all of the construction costs and the plaintiff will have endured the effects of the construction.

The judge has also found that the defendant does not demonstrate a sufficient likelihood of success on the merits. The CC&Rs are clear that a second story cannot be built on a house in Tract 12843. The defendant argues that five other houses in the tract have second stories, but the judge finds this evidence unpersuasive. The judge notes that the defendant provides no evidence that any of the second stories was added within the past six months and that the CC&Rs are limited to Tract 12843, not the surrounding area.

The judge has ordered a preliminary injunction prohibiting the defendant from commencing construction until the lawsuit is resolved.
