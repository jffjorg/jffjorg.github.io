English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has granted the motion of Juan and Samantha for leave to file a First Amended Cross-Complaint (FACC). The proposed FACC adds a cause of action against Firestone for violating the Resolution of the Board of Supervisors of the County of Los Angeles, which prohibited Firestone from enforcing against Juan the guaranty for rent for Unit F during the period in which Juan was on the hook for that rent. Firestone opposed the motion, contending that it would be prejudiced if leave was granted, but the court disagreed, citing the policy in favor of allowing leave to amend pleadings. The court also rejected Firestone's contention that the proposed amendment was futile, as the facts bearing on the claim under the Resolution are not undisputed in Firestone's favor. The court has directed Juan and Samantha to serve and file the proposed FACC by April 30, 2024.
