Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge rules in favor of the plaintiffs, Jesus Argueta and Daisy Argueta, and grants their motion to compel the deposition of General Motors, LLC's Person Most Qualified (PMQ) with production of documents. The PMQ is ordered to appear for deposition and to give testimony on a mutually convenient date and time. The PMQ is also ordered to produce for inspection at the deposition any and all materials described in the subject notice.

The judge finds that General Motors, LLC failed to comply with the warrants and failed to provide mutually agreeable dates for deposition. The judge also finds that General Motors, LLC failed to show substantial justification for its actions.

The judge awards monetary sanctions in the amount of $3,000.00 to the plaintiffs, payable within 30 days. The judge also orders General Motors, LLC to pay the costs and attorney's fees incurred by the plaintiffs in connection with the pending motion.

The judge notes that General Motors, LLC's objections to the deposition notices were without merit and that the company failed to respond to the plaintiffs' discovery requests in a timely manner. The judge also notes that General Motors, LLC failed to provide a reasonable explanation for its failure to provide a date for the PMQ deposition.
