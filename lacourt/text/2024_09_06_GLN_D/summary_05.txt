The Court has issued a Tentative Ruling in the case of Petrosyan v. Trader Joe's Company. The case involves a motion by the defendant to compel the plaintiff to comply with a Demand for IME (Independent Medical Examination) that was originally set for April 16, 2024, but was rescheduled to June 12, 2024.

The Court has determined that the motion is moot because the IME was conducted as rescheduled prior to the hearing on this motion. The defendant sought monetary sanctions under CCP section 2032.250(b) and 2023.010 for the plaintiff's alleged failure to attend the IME, but the Court has denied these requests.

The Court has also denied the plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions related to the cost of having a nurse appear twice ($700) and the expense of opposing this motion ($1,050).

The ruling states that the defendant's Motion to Compel Compliance of IME is MOOT, and that no sanctions are awarded. The Court continues to encourage audio or video appearances, and parties are encouraged to make arrangements in advance through LACourtConnect.
