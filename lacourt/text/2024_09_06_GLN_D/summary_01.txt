And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the defendant's motion to compel the deposition of the plaintiffs, Davin Lamont Stovell and Roshaun Carlise Stovell, in the case of Stovell, et al. v. Kia America, Inc. The plaintiffs had objected to the deposition notice, but the court finds that they have failed to appear for deposition and have failed to respond to requests for alternate deposition dates.

The court orders the plaintiffs to appear for depositions and give testimony in this matter by no later than October 4, 2024, at the law offices of plaintiff's counsel. The court also orders the plaintiffs to produce for inspection at the depositions any and all materials described in the Notice of Taking Deposition of Plaintiffs and Request for Production of Documents at Time of Deposition served on February 28, 2023.

The court notes that the parties must comply with the Order and Notice regarding document production and depositions, and that the parties must meet and confer in good faith concerning any outstanding discovery disputes. The court also notes that the parties are subject to the Addendum to Case Management Conference Order (Song-Beverly Litigation) and the Notice to All Counsel Re: Lemon Law Cases for Department D.

The court's ruling is based on the defendant's motion to compel deposition, which was unopposed, and the court's review of the parties' actions regarding the deposition notice. The court finds that the defendant has made a reasonable and good faith attempt to resolve the discovery disputes informally, and that the plaintiffs have failed to meet their burden to justify their objections to the deposition notice.
