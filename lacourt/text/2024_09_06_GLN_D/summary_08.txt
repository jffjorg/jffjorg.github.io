**Case Information**

* Case Number: 24NNCV00708
* Hearing Date: September 6, 2024
* Department: D

**Parties**

* Plaintiff: Cheryl L. Raner
* Defendant: John K. Stumpus

**Facts**

* The plaintiff brings a case for partition of a real property, an apartment building in Pasadena, alleging that she is the owner of an undivided one-fourth (25%) tenant-in-common interest in the property, and that the defendant is an owner of an undivided three-fourths (75%) tenant-in-common interest in the property.
* The plaintiff alleges that the parties are cousins who acquired their interests in the property through common relatives, and that after the defendant acquired his interest, the plaintiff entrusted him with the management of the property.
* The verified complaint alleges that the defendant has failed to properly manage the property, failing to collect rents at fair market value for several units and neglecting to accurately record the property's income and expenses, and not providing information on accounting related to the property to the plaintiff.

**Disputes**

* The defendant has filed a verified answer to the complaint, responding to each paragraph of the complaint and alleging thirteen affirmative defenses.
* The plaintiff argues that the defendant's answer does not state facts sufficient to constitute a defense, and that the affirmative defenses are invalid as a matter of law.

**Laws**

* CCP section 430.30: an objection may be taken by demurrer to a pleading when any ground for objection to the answer appears on the face thereof, or from any matter of which the court is required to or may take judicial notice.
* CCP section 430.20: a party against whom an answer has been filed may object, by demurrer as provided in Section 430.30, to the answer upon any one or more of the following grounds.
* CCP section 872.410: the answer shall set forth any interest the defendant has or claims in the property.
* CCP section 872.710(b): except as provided in Section 872.730, partition as to concurrent interests in the property shall be as of right unless barred by a valid waiver.
* LEG Investments v. Boxler (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 484: a co-owner of property has an absolute right to partition unless barred by a valid waiver.

**Intentions**

* The plaintiff intends to partition the property and seeks allowance, accounting, contribution or any compensatory adjustments among the parties according to equity, an interlocutory judgment, appointment of a partition referee and receiver, an order of disbursement, a writ of possession, and attorneys' fees and experts' and referees' expenses.

**Significant Statements**

* The demurrer is overruled in its entirety.
* The court finds that the defendant's answer is sufficient to allege that the trust is the 100% owner of the property, with the plaintiff having no interest at all.
* The court does not find the specificity argument under FPI Development persuasive, as the case stands for the generic proposition that mere allegations in a pleading are insufficient to withstand summary judgment, and does not stand for the proposition of a heightened pleading standard for affirmative defenses in an answer.
