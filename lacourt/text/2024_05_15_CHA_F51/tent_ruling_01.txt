BACKGROUND
 
This is a personal injury action in which Plaintiff alleges
that on 1/16/21, he was injured as a result of an automobile collision between
the vehicle he was driving and the one driven by Defendant. (Compl. p. 5.)
 
On 1/6/23, Plaintiff filed his complaint, alleging against
Defendant the following causes of action: (1) Motor Vehicle Negligence; and (2)
General Negligence. On 6/20/23, Defendant filed her answer.
 
On 7/21/23, Plaintiff served Defendant with his Form
Interrogatories, Set One. (Decl. of Khachatur Chris Ayvazyan ¶ 3.) On 10/9/23,
Defendant served her responses thereto. (Id. at ¶ 4.)
 
On 12/12/23, Plaintiff filed the instant motion to compel further
responses to Form Interrogatory Nos. 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6 and 6.7. No opposition
has been filed to date.
On 5/6/24, Plaintiff filed a notice of non-opposition.
 
ANALYSIS
 
Plaintiff seeks to compel
additional responses to his first set of Form Interrogatories, specifically Interrogatory
Nos. 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6 and 6.7, which seek: “whether
Defendant still has any complaints of injury that she attributes to the motor
vehicle incident giving rise to this lawsuit (6.3); whether treatment has been
received for those injuries (6.4); whether Defendant has taken any medication
as a result of the injures (6.5); whether any other medical services
necessitated by the injuries (6.6); and whether any future treatment is
required for the injuries attributed to the subject motor vehicle incident
(6.7).” (Pl.’s Mot 5:3–7.) 
 
A.   
Meet and Confer
 
Plaintiff’s counsel declares
that on 10/12/23, he sent Defendant’s counsel a met and confer letter regarding
the issues raised in the instant motion. (Ayvazyan Decl. ¶¶ 6–7.) Plaintiff’s counsel followed up on
10/20/23, 10/24/23, 10/25/23, 11/9/23, 11/13/23, 11/20/23, 12/1/23, and
12/12/23, but received no response to the letter. (Ex. 3 to Ayvazyan
Decl.) Based on the foregoing, the Court finds
that counsel has satisfied the meet of confer requirements under Code of Civil
Procedure section 2031.310, subdivision (b)(2).
 
B.     Evasive
and Incomplete
 
Defendant responded to the subject
interrogatories as follows: “Defendant is not asserting any injury claim
in this action, thus details of her medical care are not reasonably calculated
to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence and inquiry invades her privacy
rights.” (Ex. 2 to Pl.’s Mot.) Plaintiff argues that “these interrogatories do
not ask whether Defendant is asserting an injury claim. Rather they are asking
if Defendant attribute any injury to the incident and what treatment was sought
for those injuries.” (Pl.’s Mot. 5:11–13.)
 
In her response to Form Interrogatory No. 6.2, which
asked Defendant to identify bodily injuries attributed to the subject incident,
Defendant stated that “she injured her right shoulder, right forearm and her
face.” (Ex. 2 to Pl.’s Mot. 7:25–26.) Plaintiff maintains that therefore, “the
medical care that Defendant received for injuries caused from this accident are
highly relevant to the facts of the case and are reasonably calculated to lead
to discovery of admissible evidence. The accident that has caused Defendant’s
injuries, is the one that has also caused Plaintiff’s injuries, which Defendant
is trying to undermine in her contentions.” (Pl.’s Mot. 5:19–22.) The Court
agrees, and notes that Defendant has failed to present any opposition to the
instant motion.
 
Based on the foregoing, the Court finds Defendant’s
responses to the subject interrogatories as evasive and incomplete.
Accordingly, the Court grants Plaintiff’s motion to compel Defendant’s further
responses to Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatories, Set One, Nos. 6.3 – 6.7.
 
C.    Monetary
Sanctions
 
“The court shall impose a monetary sanction … against
any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to
compel a response to interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to
the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances
make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.290, subd.
(c).) Additionally, “the court may impose a monetary sanction ordering that one
engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney advising that
conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees,
incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.030,
subd. (a).)
 
In granting the instant unopposed motion, the Court
finds it reasonable to impose $250.00 in monetary sanctions against Defendant
and/or her counsel.
 
CONCLUSION
 
The unopposed motion is granted. Defendant is ordered to
serve further responses to Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatories, Set One, Nos. 6.3,
6.4, 6.5, 6.6 and 6.7, within 20 days. The Court imposes sanctions against Defendant
and/or her counsel in the amount of $250.00.
