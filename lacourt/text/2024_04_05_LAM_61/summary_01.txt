Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of John Gross v. Jaguar Land Rover North America, LLC. The plaintiff, John Gross, has moved to compel the deposition of Brandon Sangster, a witness who is a Customer Satisfaction Senior Technical Specialist for the defendant. The defendant has objected to the deposition, claiming that Sangster is unavailable and that the deposition notice was served too late.

The judge has granted the motion to compel the deposition of Brandon Sangster, with the deposition to take place on or before August 8, 2024.

The judge has also granted the motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories and requests for production, with certain exceptions. The judge has ordered the defendant to redact personal identifying consumer information from its responses.

The judge has ruled that the defendant may be properly directed to provide responses to the document requests at issue, and that good cause supports the categories of examination and documents sought in the deposition notice. The judge has also noted that the defendant failed to respond in any substantive way to the plaintiff's meet-and-confer declaration.

The judge has denied the motion as to form interrogatories and the remaining requests for production, finding that the defendant's objections were without merit or too general. The judge has also denied the motion as to certain requests for production, finding that the requests were not relevant or were too broad.

The judge has cited various cases and statutes in support of the ruling, including Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants, Oregel v. Am. Isuzu Motors, Inc., Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc., and Santana v. FCA US, LLC.
