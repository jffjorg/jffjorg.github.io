And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for leave to file a First Amended Complaint. The plaintiff, Antonia Guzman Franco, worked for the defendant, The Perfect Bite, LLC, as a Research Development Technician, and alleges that her employment was terminated based on her age and disability. The plaintiff also alleges that the defendant committed wage and hour violations and failed to provide meal and rest periods. The plaintiff seeks to add three new individual defendants to the complaint. The defendant has not opposed the amendment and is willing to stipulate to it. The court finds that the amendment is appropriate and grants the motion. The plaintiff must file and serve a stand-alone First Amended Complaint within 10 days, and the defendant must be served in a timely manner as provided by law. The moving party must also give notice, unless waived.
