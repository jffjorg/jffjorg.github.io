And here is the English text summary:

The Court's tentative ruling is that the motion to be relieved as counsel by Logan Quirk, Esq. is granted. The court notes that the parties have had a breakdown in communication, and counsel has been unable to render representation on the client's behalf. The court delays the effective date of the order relieving counsel until proof of service of a copy of the signed order on the client and proof that the client has been properly served with notice of the next trial date have been filed with the Court.
