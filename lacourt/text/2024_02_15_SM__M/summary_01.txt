Summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies the Plaintiff's motion for attorneys' fees without prejudice. The Plaintiff seeks to recover reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with the action, alleging that the Defendants ceased indoor activities in violation of COVID-19 stay-at-home orders. The Judge concludes that the Plaintiff has not demonstrated the catalytic effect to be the "successful" party entitled to fees without a favorable judgment. The Judge notes that the Plaintiff has not provided sufficient evidence to establish that the lawsuit had a causal connection with the Defendants' cessation of activities and that the lawsuit was mooted early in its prosecution. The Judge also finds that some facts weigh against a finding that the Defendants ceased operation because of this lawsuit, including the fact that the Defendants filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy.
