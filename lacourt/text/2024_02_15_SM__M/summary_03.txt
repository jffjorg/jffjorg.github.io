And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion for stipulated judgment filed by the parties, Hermosa Capital Management and Marina Caregivers Cooperative. The parties have entered into a settlement agreement on September 24, 2023, in which the defendant agreed to a $500,000.00 judgment, subject to certain set-offs. The parties' representatives have signed the settlement documents, and the judge has found that they have complied with Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6. As a result, the judge has ordered that the case be dismissed without prejudice, with the court retaining jurisdiction to enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of the settlement. The dismissal will automatically convert to a dismissal with prejudice on May 21, 2025, unless a motion is filed prior to that date requesting the dismissal be vacated.
