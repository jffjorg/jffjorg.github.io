And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion for relief from deemed admissions filed by defendant Mansour Zakhor, D.D.S. The defendant was served with requests for admission on March 23, 2023, but his prior counsel failed to respond. The court granted the plaintiff's motion to compel and deemed all admissions as admitted on July 12, 2023. The defendant is seeking relief from these deemed admissions, claiming that his prior counsel's failure to respond was due to mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. However, the court finds that the defendant has not provided sufficient evidence to support this claim and that his current counsel was also served with the motions to deem admissions admitted but failed to file admission responses prior to the hearing. The court denies the motion for relief from deemed admissions without prejudice and orders the defendant to answer the requests for admissions at issue without objection prior to potentially granting any such motion.
