  Case Number:  19STCV30239    Hearing Date:   April 10, 2024    Dept:  74 The Wonderful Company, LLC v. Anthem
Blue Cross Life and Health Insurance Company, et al.
 
Defendant Lucile Packard Children’s
Hospital at Stanford’s Motion to Seal Motion for Summary Judgment and
Supporting Documents
 
BACKGROUND 
            This
action arises from a contractual dispute.
            On
August 22, 2019, Plaintiff The Wonderful Company, LLC (Plaintiff) filed a
complaint against Anthem Blue Cross Life and Health Insurance Company and
Defendant Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital Stanford (Defendant).
            On
January 17, 2020, Plaintiff filed a first amended complaint (FAC).
            With
leave of the court, Plaintiff filed a second amended complaint (SAC) on May 5,
2023. In the SAC, Plaintiff alleges (1) breach of contract, (2) breach of
implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, (3) breach of fiduciary duty,
(4) intentional misrepresentation, (5) negligent misrepresentation, (6)
concealment, (7) violation of California Business and Professions Code section
17200, and (8) negligence.
            On
January 5, 2024, Defendant filed a motion for summary judgment. That same day,
Defendant filed this motion to seal the motion for summary judgment and
supporting papers.
LEGAL STANDARD
            Unless confidentiality is required
by law, court records are presumed to be open to the public. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 2.550, subd. (c).) Consequently, pleadings, motions, evidence, and
other papers may not be filed under seal merely by stipulation of the parties;
rather, a prior court order is necessary. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.551,
subd. (a).) 
            To
grant such an order, the court must expressly find that . . . “an overriding
interest exists that overcomes the right of public access to the record, an
overriding interest supports sealing the records, a substantial probability
exists that the overriding interest will be prejudiced if the record is not
sealed, the proposed sealing is narrowly tailored, and no less restrictive
means exist to achieve the overriding interest.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
2.550, subd. (d).) 
            If
the court fails to make the required findings, the order is deficient and
cannot support sealing. (Overstock.com, Inc. v. Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (2014)
231 Cal.App.4th 471, 487.) 
DISCUSSION  
            In
support of its motion to seal, Defendant cites potentially overriding
interests. First, the proposed redactions would protect private medical
information regarding two patients’ treatment. (Grafilo v. Wolfsohn (2019)
33 Cal.App.5th 1024, 1034.) Second, the proposed redactions would protect
sensitive information about how Defendant structured and priced its medical services.
Financial information whose disclosure would cause competitive harm to a party
can be an overriding interest. (See Universal City Studios, Inc. v. Superior
Court (2003) 110 Cal.App.4th 1273, 1285-1286; Whyte v. Schlage Lock Co. (2002)
101 Cal.App.4th 1443, 1455-1456.) However, the court notes that hospitals like
Defendant are required to make public a list of their charges for the items and
services they provide. (See Naranjo v. Doctors Medical Center of Modesto,
Inc. (2023) 90 Cal.App.5th 1193, 1207-1208.) Accordingly, Defendant has
agreed to leave unredacted the dollar amount charged for its services, in
addition to the number of charges. (Reply, p. 6.) 
            In
light of the foregoing, the court has reviewed Defendant’s papers and finds
that the following proposed redactions are narrowly tailored to protect
Defendant’s overriding interests:

themselves. Thus, sealing is appropriate.

            However,
the court denies Defendant’s motion to seal the following portions of the
memorandum of points and authorities: the proposed redactions on pages 4-6;
page 16, lines 3-5; and page 16, lines 14-16. That is, Defendant’s cited
overriding interests do not support sealing of this information. For the same
reason, the court denies Defendant’s motion to seal the following portions of
the separate statement: page 3, lines 12-13, 18-19, 23-25; page 3, line 27
through page 4, line 2; page 4, lines 5-7, 9-10, 11-14, 16-19; page 9 lines
3-8; and page 15, lines 11-20. In addition, the court denies Defendant’s motion
to seal Exhibit A to the Declaration of Laura C. Hurtado because the proposed
sealing is not narrowly tailored: Defendant aims to seal the entirety of the
discovery responses. 
CONCLUSION 
The
court grants Defendant’s motion to seal in part.
Defendant
shall give notice.
