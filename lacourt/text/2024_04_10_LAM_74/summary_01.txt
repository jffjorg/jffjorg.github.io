And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

"The court grants Defendant's motion to seal in part, finding that some information can be sealed due to overriding interests. Specifically, the court allows the sealing of private medical information and commercially sensitive business information. However, the court denies Defendant's motion to seal certain portions of the memorandum of points and authorities and separate statement, finding that the proposed sealing is not narrowly tailored. The court also denies Defendant's motion to seal Exhibit A to the Declaration of Laura C. Hurtado, as the proposed sealing is not narrowly tailored. The court's ruling will be finalized after Defendant gives notice."
