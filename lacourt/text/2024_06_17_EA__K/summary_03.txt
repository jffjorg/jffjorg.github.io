English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has considered the motion filed on April 19, 2024, which was not accompanied by a proof of service. Despite the lack of proof of service, the plaintiff's counsel filed a "Proof of Service of Motion" on May 20, 2024, reflecting email service on defendants' counsel and email and mail service to the client. The court has continued the hearing date to June 13, 2024, and provided notice to counsel of the change. The plaintiff has also filed a "Notice of Continuance of Motion to be Relieved as Counsel," advising of the scheduled hearing date.
