Background[1]  
Case
No. 22PSCV01040
Plaintiff Moore Sweeping (“Plaintiff”) alleges as follows:
Plaintiff and Defendant Guy F. Atkinson
Construction, LLC (“Atkinson”) entered into a contract dated July 19, 2019
(“Contract”), whereby Plaintiff was to perform street sweeping services for
Atkinson on State Route 60 pavement rehabilitation project in Los Angeles
County (the “Project”). The Contract was subject to the Federal Disadvantaged
Business Enterprise (“DBE”) program requirements and the State of California
Department of Transportation’s (“CalTrans”) Disadvantaged Business Enterprise
Policy. 
 
Plaintiff began work on the Project on
December 29, 2019. At the outset, Atkinson did not request more than one DBE
street sweeper for the Project. Plaintiff then became aware that Atkinson was
using another company, Century Sweeping, Inc. (“Century”), for street sweeping
on the Project in violation of the Contract terms. Plaintiff also became aware
that Atkinson had engaged in two separate DBE violations: the illegal
replacement of a DBE subcontractor and prompt payment violations. CalTrans
investigated Atkinson’s alleged violations and, in or about April 2020, found
that Atkinson had indeed committed same. Atkinson terminated the Contract
without notice and without a justifiable reason immediately following the
investigation, on the basis that Plaintiff had not obtained the required
special shift letter from Atkinson’s union, the International Union of
Operating Engineers, Local 12 (“Union”), to begin work at the time it was
instructed to by Atkinson. Plaintiff was the only subcontractor out of several that
had this special shift letter requirement. Atkinson and Union were complicit in
preventing this letter from being obtained by Plaintiff. 
 
At the time of termination of the Contract,
there remained outstanding to Plaintiff $759,739.23 left on the Contract price.
Plaintiff filed a complaint with CalTrans regarding Atkinson’s termination of
the Contract and filed a Stop Notice, but CalTrans found that Atkinson had good
cause to replace Plaintiff.
On October 21, 2022 (i.e., while the action was pending in the
United States District Court, Central District, Case No.
2:22-cv-07496-JFW-AGR), Atkinson filed its “Answer and Counterclaims.”
On April 20, 2023, Plaintiff filed a “Amended Verified
Complaint,” asserting causes of action against Atkinson, Union, Joseph Pacheco
(“Pacheco”) and Does 1-10 for:
1.                 
Breach of Contract
2.                 
Breach of the Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing
3.                 
Unfair Business Practices (Bus. & Prof. Code §
17204)
4.                 
Intentional Interference with Contractual Relations
5.                 
Intentional Misrepresentation
6.                 
Intentional Interference with Prospective Economic
Advantage
On April 25, 2023, Plaintiff dismissed Union and Pacheco,
without prejudice.
On November 16, 2023, the court related Case
Nos. 22PSCV01040 and 23PSCV00962; Case No. 22PSCV01040 was designated as the
lead case.
The Final Status
Conference is set for September 24, 2024. Trial is set for October 8, 2024.
Case No. 23PSCV00962
Plaintiff Moore Sweeping (“Plaintiff”)
alleges as follows:
In July 2019, Plaintiff was hired as a subcontractor
by Atkinson to perform street sweeping services for Atkinson on the Project. Pursuant
to its subcontract with Atkinson, Plaintiff was required to hire only Union
employees to work on the Project and to enter into a contract with the Union to
procure the employees needed to perform Plaintiff’s contracted-for work on the
Project. Plaintiff and the Union then entered into a Short-Form Collective
Bargaining Agreement (“CBA”) which was subject to the terms of a Master Labor
Agreement (“MLA”) incorporated therein. In October 2019, Plaintiff contacted the
Union to procure operators to perform work on the Project and was put in
contact with business representative Pacheco. Pacheco made discriminatory
requests of Plaintiff, asking for documents that were not required for
Plaintiff to perform its work on the Project which delayed Plaintiff’s start
time on the Project. Pacheco required only Plaintiff to obtain a bona fide
special shift letter, intimidated one of Plaintiff’s employees into filing a
baseless grievance, failed to follow grievance resolution procedures and
stopped Plaintiff’s work on the Project. Perry Hawkins (“Hawkins”) was the
district representative and/or treasurer for the Union and Pacheco’s superior
and assisted Pacheco’s violations. Carl Mendenhall (“Mendenhall”) was the treasurer
for the Union and assisted Pacheco’s violations. 
On November 16, 2023, the court related Case
Nos. 22PSCV01040 and 23PSCV00962; Case No. 22PSCV01040 was designated as the
lead case.
On December 21,
2023, Plaintiff filed its Second Amended Verified Complaint (“SAC”), asserting
causes of action against Union, Pacheco, Hawkins, Mendenhall (collectively,
“Defendants”) and Does 1-10 for:
1.                 
Breach of Contract 
2.                 
Unfair Business Practices (Bus. & Prof. C. §17200,
Et Seq.)
3.                 
Fraud/Intentional Misrepresentation
4.                 
Intentional Interference with Contractual Relations
5.                 
Intentional Interference with Prospective Economic
Advantage
6.                 
Conspiracy to Commit Fraud
On April 2, 2024, an
“Order on Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Adjudication” was entered.
The Final Status
Conference is set for September 24, 2024. Trial is set for October 8, 2024.

Discussion
The Rowan Firm (“Firm”)
seeks to be relieved as counsel of record for Plaintiff (“Client”).
The court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw,
and such a motion should be granted provided that there is no prejudice to the
client and it does not disrupt the orderly process of justice. (See
Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21
Cal.App.4th 904, 915; People v. Prince
(1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398.)
California
Rules of Court (“CRC”) Rule 3.1362 requires (1) a notice of motion and motion
directed to the client (made on the Notice
of Motion and Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-051)); (2) a
declaration stating in general terms and without compromising the
confidentiality of the attorney-client relationship why a motion under Code of
Civil Procedure § 284(2) is brought instead of filing a consent under section
284(1) (made on the Declaration in
Support of Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form
(MC-052)); (3) service of the notice of motion and motion, the declaration, and
the proposed order on the client and on all other parties who have appeared in
the case; and (4) a proposed order relieving counsel (prepared on the Order Granting Attorney's Motion to Be
Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-053)). The court may
delay the effective date of the order relieving counsel until proof of service
of a copy of the signed order on the client has been filed with the court.
Attorney Dan Rowan Cortright (“Cortright”) attests only that the Client
is a corporation and may not consent under Code of Civil Procedure § 284(1). 
Cortright states that he has served the Client by mail at the Client’s
last known address with copies of the motion papers served with this
declaration and that he has confirmed, within the past 30 days, that the
address is current, by email.
The motion is not
opposed. The court determines that the requirements of Rules of Court Rule 3.1362 enumerated
above have been sufficiently met.
Accordingly, the
motions are granted, effective upon the filing of a proof
of service showing service of the signed order upon
the Client at the Client’s last known address.
The court will set an
Order to Show Cause Re: Representation of Corporation for July 19, 2024
at 9:00 a.m.
