And here is the English text summarizing the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the motion filed on April 19, 2024, without a proof of service, does not comply with California Rules of Court rule 3.1300. As a result, the hearing date was continued to June 13, 2024, and notice was provided to counsel. The Judge notes that a proof of service was filed on May 20, 2024, but the motion was still not accompanied by a proof of service at the time the Judge made this ruling.
