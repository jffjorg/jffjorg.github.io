The court grants the plaintiff's motion for preferential trial setting. The plaintiff, Brenda Limbrick, is over 70 years old and has a deteriorating health condition. The court finds that the plaintiff has a substantial interest in the action and that her health is such that a preference is necessary to prevent prejudicing her interest in the litigation. The court also finds that all essential parties have been served with process and have appeared in the action. The court sets a trial date not more than 120 days from the date the motion is granted.
