Legal Standard
“To the extent authorized by the chapter governing any
particular discovery method. . ., the court, after notice to any affected
party, person, or attorney, and after opportunity for hearing, may impose the
following sanctions against anyone engaging in conduct that is a misuse of the
discovery process:. . .
(d) The court may impose a terminating sanction by one of
the following orders: . . .
(3) An order dismissing the action, or any part of the
action, of that party. . .” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (d).) 
“Misuses of
the discovery process include, but are not limited to, the following: . . . (g)
Disobeying a court order to provide discovery . . .” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2023.010.)
Discussion
County and Heckers (together, “Defendants”) move the court
for an order imposing terminating sanctions against Plaintiff on the grounds
that Plaintiff has failed to comply with the court’s February 6, 2024 order
compelling his further responses to Defendants’ discovery requests, as well as
the payment of monetary sanctions to Defendants.
At the outset, the court notes that while the instant motion
is brought by Defendants, the court’s February 6, 2024 order pertained to
motions brought by County only. The court summarily denies the motion as it
pertains to Heckers on this basis.
The court further notes that Defendants appear to
alternatively seek the imposition of evidentiary and monetary sanctions in the
event the court declines to impose terminating sanctions. (See Motion, 5:3-6).
The court summarily denies this request, inasmuch as it is not set forth in the
notice of motion. Additionally, a request for evidentiary sanctions must be
accompanied by a California Rules of Court rule 3.1345 separate statement.
Defendants have not provided the court with a separate statement.
The motion is otherwise denied. “A decision to order terminating
sanctions should not be made lightly. But where a violation is willful,
preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe
sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial
court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction. (Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005)
128 Cal.App.4th 262, 279-280). Further, “a terminating sanction issued solely
because of a failure to pay a monetary discovery sanction is never justified.”
(Newland v. Superior Court (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 608, 615.)
“Discovery sanctions should be appropriate to the
dereliction, and should not exceed that which is required to protect the
interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery.” (Young v. Rosenthal (1989) 212 Cal.App.3d 96, 118 [internal
quotations and citation omitted].) “Preventing parties from presenting their
cases on the merits is a drastic measure; terminating sanctions should only be
ordered when there has been previous noncompliance with a rule or order and it
appears a less severe sanction would not be effective.”  (Link
v. Cater (1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1326 [quotation marks and citation
omitted].) 
Defendants’ counsel Ali Ziai
(“Ziai”) represents, and/or the accompanying exhibits reflect, as follows: On
February 6, 2024, the court (after taking the matter under submission on
January 9, 2024) granted County’s (1) Motion
to Compel Further Responses and to Compel Production to Requests for Production
(Set One) [“RTP”] and (2) Motion to Compel Further Responses to Form
Interrogatories (Set One) [“FROGS”], ordered Plaintiff to provide
further, Code-compliant responses to RTP Nos. 10-12 (and compliant docs) and
FROGS Nos. 2.6, 2.7, 2.13, 6.5,
8.1-8.8., 10.1, 10.2, 20.2, 20.3, 20.4 within 20 days from the date of
the notice of ruling and awarded sanctions in the amount of $2,250.00, which
were payable within 30 days of the date of the hearing. (Ziai Decl., ¶ 5, Exh.
C.) Plaintiff has not complied with the court’s February 6, 2024 order, as of
the filing date of the motion. (Id., ¶ 2).
Defendants concede that Plaintiff
became self-represented following the court’s order, as evidenced by the
Substitution of Attorney filed with the court on February 22, 2024. Defendants
have attached a letter dated March 5, 2024 to Plaintiff (Ziai Decl., ¶ 3, Exh.
A), but this letter pertains to mediation, not the court’s February 6, 2024
order. Ziai represents that on March 7, 2024, Plaintiff contacted his office
via email and “sent a vague and confusing message re: settlement and documents
sought by Defendants as part of discovery.” (Id., ¶ 4). It is unclear to
the court from the foregoing language whether or not Plaintiff was specifically
aware of the court’s February 6, 2024 order. Ziai also represents that
“Plaintiff has also made contact with [his] office several times via phone, but
has never addressed his failure to comply with the Court’s February 6, 2024
Order, or indicated that his compliance with the Court’s Order was
forthcoming.” (Id.) Again, it is unclear to the court from the foregoing
language whether or not Plaintiff communicated his awareness of the court’s
February 6, 2024 order on these occasions. Ziai represents that on March 11,
2024, his office sent a letter to Plaintiff; this letter, however, does not
specifically reference the court’s February 6, 2024 order. (Id., ¶ 4,
Exh. B.) Ziai represents that on April 2, 2024, he sent another letter to
Plaintiff, in which he enclosed a copy of the court’s February 6, 2024 order. (Id.,
¶ 5, Exh. C.) Plaintiff, then, was put on notice of his failure to comply with
the court’s February 6, 2024 order at least as of this date.
With that said, it appears to the
court that terminating sanctions would be too harsh of a penalty at this
juncture. Defendants have not provided the court with any information
reflecting a “history of abuse.” The court believes that terminating sanctions
may be warranted if the imposition of less severe sanctions is first imposed
and shown to be ineffective.
