[1]              The demurrer was filed (and served
via email) on May 22, 2024 and set for hearing on June 17, 2024. Code of Civil
Procedure § 1005, subdivision (b) requires that moving papers be served and
filed at least 16 court days before the hearing. Code of Civil Procedure §
1010.6, subdivision (a)(3)(B) requires an additional two court days’ notice for
motions served electronically. May 31, 2024 was a court holiday and was thus
excluded for purposes of calculating notice. Although the motion was timely
filed, it should have been served via email no later than May 21, 2024.
