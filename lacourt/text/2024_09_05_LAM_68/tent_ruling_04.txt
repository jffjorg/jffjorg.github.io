RULING
Demurrer:
Overruled.
Defendant,
Caesarstone USA submits a demurrer to the for fourth cause of action for
fraudulent concealment in the first amended complaint. Defendant challenges the
operative complaint on lack of sufficient facts. Defendant in opposition
contends the operative complaint sufficient articulates the claim. Defendant in
reply reiterates the insufficient identification of the subject products
thereby establishing a nexus of liability. Defendant introduces new argument on
toxic tort liability. (See Bockrath v. Aldrich Chemical Co., Inc. (1999) 21 Cal.4th 71, 78-79.) Defendant challenges the
reliance on fraudulent concealment case law on the basis of factual
distinction.
 
A demurrer is an objection to a pleading, the grounds for
which are apparent from either the face of the complaint or a matter of which
the court may take judicial notice. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.30, subd. (a); see
also Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d
311, 318.) The purpose of a demurrer is to challenge the sufficiency of a
pleading “by raising questions of law.” (Postley
v. Harvey (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 280, 286.) “In the construction of a
pleading, for the purpose of determining its effect, its allegations must be
liberally construed, with a view to substantial justice between the parties.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 452.) The court “ ‘ “treat[s] the demurrer as admitting all
material facts properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions
of fact or law . . . .” ’ ” (Berkley v.
Dowds (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 518, 525.) In applying these standards, the
court liberally construes the complaint to determine whether a cause of action
has been stated.  (Picton v. Anderson Union High School Dist. (1996) 50 Cal.App.4th
726, 733.)
 
“A demurrer for
uncertainty is strictly construed, even where a complaint is in some respects
uncertain, because ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery
procedures.” (Khoury v. Maly's of California, Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616; Williams v. Beechnut Nutrition Corp. (1986) 185 Cal.App.3d
135, 139 [“[U]nder our liberal pleading rules,
where the complaint contains substantive factual allegations sufficiently
apprising defendant of the issues it is being asked to meet, a demurrer for
uncertainty should be overruled or plaintiff given leave to amend.] 
 
“[T]he
elements of a cause of action for fraud based on concealment are: ‘(1) the
defendant must have concealed or suppressed a material fact, (2) the defendant
must have been under a duty to disclose the fact to the plaintiff, (3) the
defendant must have intentionally concealed or suppressed the fact with the
intent to defraud the plaintiff, (4) the plaintiff must have been unaware of
the fact and would not have acted as he did if he had known of the concealed or
suppressed fact, and (5) as a result of the concealment or suppression of the
fact, the plaintiff must have sustained damage. [Citation.]’” (Kaldenbach v.
Mutual of Omaha Life Ins. Co. (2009) 178 Cal.App.4th 830, 850 (internal
quotation marks omitted.) 
 
Defendant
specifically challenges the lack of any preexisting, transactional relationship
establishing a basis for the duty to disclose. (Bigler-Engler v. Breg, Inc.
(2017) 7 Cal.App.5th 276, 311.) “There are ‘four circumstances in which nondisclosure or
concealment may constitute actionable fraud: (1) when the defendant is in a
fiduciary relationship with the plaintiff; (2) when the defendant had exclusive
knowledge of material facts not known to the plaintiff; (3) when the defendant
actively conceals a material fact from the plaintiff; and (4) when the
defendant makes partial representations but also suppresses some material
facts. [Citation.]’” (LiMandri v. Judkins (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 326,
336.) “Each of the other three circumstances in which nondisclosure may be
actionable presupposes the existence of some other relationship between the
plaintiff and defendant in which a duty to disclose can arise. … As a matter of
common sense, such a relationship can only come into being as a result of some
sort of transaction between the parties.” (Id.
at pp. 336–337.) 
 
Plaintiff cites to a broader standard for
fraudulent concealment arising in the toxic tort context, whereby a
manufacturer fails to warn consumers of hazards inherent in a product. “The requirement's purpose is to inform consumers about a product's
hazards and faults of which they are unaware, so that they can refrain from
using the product altogether or evade the danger by careful use.” (Jones v.
ConocoPhillips Co. (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 1187, 1198.) Users include
persons responsible for processing materials not privy to information regarding
necessary safety protocols. The withholding of said information subjects a
defendant to potential fraudulent concealment liability. (Id. at pp.
1199-1200.)
 
Plaintiff proceeds to cite extensive portions of
the operative complaint regarding knowledge of the allegedly toxic substance,
crystalline silica, and provision of “false and misleading information”
identifying the product as “non-hazardous.” The allegations acknowledge
awareness and concern for exposure levels, but were downplayed or outright
concealed. Said risks included known risks from the cutting and finishing of
the product through dust exposure. [First Amend. Comp., 393-404, 408-423,
1140-1162, and 1178-1182.] 
 
The court also declines to consider any and all
new arguments in the reply in that said arguments deprive Plaintiff of the
opportunity respond. The court finds the standard for fraudulent concealment
presented by Plaintiff applicable for purposes of ruling on the demurrer, and Plaintiffs
sufficiently articulate the claim for fraudulent concealment under the
standard. 
 
The demurrer is OVERRULED.
 
 
Motion to Strike:
Denied.
Defendant Caesarstone USA moves to strike paragraphs 1088, 1106, and 1128, and prayer for punitive
damages. Defendant moves to strike on grounds the cited paragraphs fail to
sufficiently articulate the claim for punitive damages. Plaintiff maintains the
complaint sufficiently articulates the claim for punitive damages. The
court electronic filing system shows no reply on file at the time of the
tentative ruling publication cutoff.
 
Motions to strike
are used to challenge defects in the pleadings not subject to demurrer.  Any party may move to strike the whole or any
part of a pleading within the time allotted to respond to the pleading.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 435, subd. (b)(1).) The
grounds for a motion to strike shall appear on the face of the challenged
pleading or from any matter of which the Court is required to take judicial
notice.  (Id. § 437, subd. (a).)  The
Court may strike out any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any
pleading, and strike out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in
conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of the
court.  (Id. § 436.)  An “irrelevant”
matter includes any “demand for judgment requesting relief not supported by the
allegations of the complaint or cross-complaint.”  (Id.
§ 431.10, subds. (b)(3), (c); see also Smith
v. Superior Court (1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 1033, 1036-1042.)
 
The court agrees
that the subject allegations in isolation lack a sufficient nexus to the toxic
tort basis of the subject action. (See Bockrath
v. Aldrich Chemical Co., Inc. (1999) 21
Cal.4th 71, 78-79.) Plaintiff acknowledges as much. Nevertheless, Plaintiffs
raise a valid argument regarding the need for further discovery. (Id. at
p. 82.)
 
On punitive damages, Civil
Code section 3294, subdivision (c) authorizes punitive damages upon a showing
of malice, oppression, or fraud, which are defined as follows:
 
(1) “Malice” means
conduct which is intended by the defendant to cause injury to the plaintiff or
despicable conduct which is carried on by the defendant with a willful and
conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.
(2) “Oppression”
means despicable conduct that subjects a person to cruel and unjust hardship in
conscious disregard of that person’s rights.
(3) “Fraud” means an
intentional misrepresentation, deceit, or concealment of a material fact known
to the defendant with the intention on the part of the defendant of thereby
depriving a person of property or legal rights or otherwise causing injury.
 
The challenged paragraphs
support both recovery on the fraud standard, but also find support under the
malice standard as part of a course and conduct of decision making
demonstrating a conscious disregard for the rights and safety of workers like
decedent. The allegations also allege corporate ratification. (White v. Ultramar,
Inc. (1999) 21 Cal.4th 563, 576–577; Cruz v. HomeBase (2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 160, 168.)
 
The motion to strike
is DENIED. 
 
 
In summary, the
demurrer is overruled and the motion to strike is denied. Defendant Caesarstone
USA to answer the first amended
complaint within 10 days of this order.
