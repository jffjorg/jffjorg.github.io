MOVING PARTY: Defendant, Gilbert Insurance Services, Inc.

RESPONDING PARTY: Unopposed/ Plaintiff, Matthew Garza
 
RELIEF REQUESTED
Application to Seal Documents 
 
SUMMARY OF ACTION
Plaintiff Matthew S. Garza was a Major League Baseball
(MLB) pitcher for 12 years. Plaintiff’s career 
with a MLB team ended after the the 2017 season, due to a pitching arm
shoulder injury, which was not successfully repaired following surgery well
enough to return to MLB pitching form. 
 
Prior to the injury causing event, Plaintiff procured a
ten million disability insurance policy from defendant Certain Underwriters at
Lloyd’s of London Subscribing to the Policy (Lloyd’s). Plaintiff maintains the
policy was procured and submitted by defendant International Specialty
Insurance Services, Inc. (ISI), Nigro Karlin Segal & Feldstein, LLP and
NKSFB, LLC (collectively NKSFB). Defendants Paradigm - Gilbert Insurance Group,
LLC, and Gilbert Insurance Services, Inc. (Paradigm and Gilbert) assisted Plaintiff
in providing information in support of the application, though the application
admittedly omitted certain information at the time of submission. Following
submission of the claim to Lloyd’s, the claim was denied based at least in part
on the provision of an incomplete application. 
 
On Jul 1, 2021, Plaintiff filed a complaint for Breach of
Contract, Breach of Implied Duty of Good Faith and Fair Dealing, and Breach of
Duties as an Insurance Broker. The case was initially filed in Fresno County,
and transferred to Los Angeles County on April 5, 2022, following a successful
motion to change venue. Lloyd’s also previously filed a cross-complaint against
Paradigm and Gilbert for Fraud, Negligence, Negligent Misrepresentation, and
Comparative Fault/Contribution. 
 
On May 11, 2022, the case was reassigned from complex
court to Department 68, and independent calendar court. On July 26, 2022, the
court granted the motion to strike the cross-complaint with leave to amend.
Lloyd’s filed its first amended cross-complaint on August 11, 2022. On December
6, 2022, the court denied the motion to strike the first amended
cross-complaint. 
 
On December 21, 2022, the court granted Plaintiff leave
to file a first amended complaint. The amended pleading added in defendants
NKSFB and new causes of action. On the same date, the first amended complaint
for Breach of Contract (first and fourth causes of action), Breach of Implied
Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing, Breach of Duties as an Insurance
Brokers, Intentional Misrepresentation, Negligent Misrepresentation, and Breach
of Fiduciary Duties, was filed. 
 
On March 23, 2023, the court denied the motion to compel
arbitration. On March 29, 2203, the court overruled the demurrer to the first
amended complaint, and a motion for sanctions, both brought by Gilbert
Insurance Services. 
 
On December 14, 2023, the court granted the motion of
International Specialty Insurance Services, Inc. to interplead $133,624.68 in
funds with the court.

A party
requesting that a record be filed under seal must file a motion or an
application for an order sealing the record. The motion or application must be
accompanied by a memorandum and a declaration containing facts sufficient to
justify the sealing. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.551(b)(1).) Unless
confidentiality is required by law, court records are presumed to be open. (Id.
at 2.550(c).) To grant an order sealing records, the court must expressly find
that Defendant has presented facts that establish: (1) There exists an
overriding interest that overcomes the right of public access to the record;
(2) The overriding interest supports sealing the record; (3) A substantial
probability exists that the overriding interest will be prejudiced if the
record is not sealed; (4) The proposed sealing is narrowly tailored; and (5) No
less restrictive means exist to achieve the overriding interest. Id. at
2.550(d). To establish that an overriding interest is sufficient, plaintiff
must clearly identify the interest and demonstrate “a substantial probability
that it will be prejudiced absent sealing or closure.” (Universal City
Studios, Inc. v. Superior Court (2003) 110 Cal.App.4th 1273, 1283.) 
 
The subject records were provided by Plaintiff pursuant to
the August 30, 2022, Stipulated Protective Order, whereby the records were
deemed confidential. Defendant both represents the records are protected by
state and federal laws against disclosure of medical information.
Alternatively, Defendant contends protection of Plaintiff’s medical information
constitutes a compelling interest, disclosure would cause prejudice to
Plaintiff, the request is narrowly tailored, and no less restrictive means
exist. 
 
The records appear integral to the adjudication of the
motion, and the medical records are indisputably protected from disclosure
barring a waiver by Plaintiff. The confidentiality imposed as a matter of law
justifies the application to seal the identified records. (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 2.551(c).) The court additionally finds the records specific and narrowly
tailored with no less restrictive means available for protection. 
The motion is GRANTED.
 
Motion for determination of Good Faith Settlement and
concurrent motion to seal references to settlement amounts set for September 9.
Trial currently scheduled for November 4, 2024.
