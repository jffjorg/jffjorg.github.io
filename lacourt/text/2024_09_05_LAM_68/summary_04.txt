And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by Defendant Caesarstone USA. The demurrer was filed in response to the fourth cause of action for fraudulent concealment in the first amended complaint. The judge has overruled the demurrer, finding that the complaint sufficiently articulates the claim for fraudulent concealment.

The motion to strike was filed to strike paragraphs 1088, 1106, and 1128, and the prayer for punitive damages. The judge has denied the motion to strike, finding that the challenged paragraphs support both recovery on the fraud standard and the malice standard.

The judge has ordered Defendant Caesarstone USA to answer the first amended complaint within 10 days of the order. The case management conference and two OSCs are scheduled for December 11, 2024.
