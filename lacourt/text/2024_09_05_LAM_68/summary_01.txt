And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling grants in part and denies in part the application by Defendant Gilbert Insurance Services, Inc. to seal certain documents presented in support of the motion for summary judgment. The documents include medical records and reports related to Plaintiff Matthew S. Garza's shoulder injury and disability insurance claim. The court finds that the records are protected from disclosure under state and federal laws and that the confidentiality imposed as a matter of law justifies the application to seal the records. The court also finds that the records are specific and narrowly tailored with no less restrictive means available for protection. The motion is granted, and the parties are directed to give notice.
