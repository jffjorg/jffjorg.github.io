And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on the application for a writ of possession filed by PNC Bank against Sarbjit Singh and Isaura Singh. The Bank is seeking a writ of possession for a 2018 Great Dane Reefer Trailer, which was purchased by Sarbjit under an agreement with the Bank. Sarbjit defaulted on the loan and the Bank has accelerated the remaining contract balance. The Bank is seeking to recover the unpaid balance of $6,114.32, including late charges, site visit/repossession fees, and interest.

The court finds that the Bank has established the probable validity of its claim to possession of the Equipment and grants the application for a writ of possession and turnover order. The court orders the Bank's undertaking to be $27,771, which is twice the value of the Equipment's fair market value of $20,000. The court also orders the re-delivery bond to be $27,771.

The Bank has failed to provide sufficient evidence to support the amount owed, which is a defect that will be waived since no opposition was filed. The court notes that the Bank's declaration supporting the application for a writ of possession must be set forth with particularity and must show evidentiary facts rather than ultimate facts.
