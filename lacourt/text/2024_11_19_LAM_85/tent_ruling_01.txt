  Case Number:  23STCP04662    Hearing Date:   November 19, 2024    Dept:  85 
Jerome Bennett Bey v. City of Los Angeles and Los
Angeles Police Department, 
23STCP04662 


Decision on petition for mandamus: granted in
part



 
Petitioner Jerome
Bennett Bey (“Bey”) seeks mandamus to enforce the California Public Records Act
(“CPRA”) (Govt. Code., §7920.005 et seq.) against the City of Los
Angeles (“City”) and the Los Angeles Police Department (“LAPD” or “Department”).  
            The
court has read and considered the moving papers,[1] opposition,
and reply, and renders the following decision. 
 
            A. Statement of the Case
1. The Petition
a. Background 
On December 28, 2023, Petitioner Bey filed his Petition
against the City and LAPD alleging causes of action for traditional mandate and
declaratory relief.  The Petition alleges
in pertinent part as follows. 
             On November 12, 2022, Bey sustained injuries
while working as a security guard for the Los Angeles Police Museum’s Fall Carnival
(“Carnival”), after a vehicle drove through safety barriers in attempt to evade
pursuing LAPD officers (the “Incident”). 

Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges,
that LAPD approved a special event permit for the Carnival and was responsible
in part for overseeing security and safety measures for the Carnival, including
ensuring that the Carnival complied with Los Angeles Municipal Code (“LAMC”)
section 41.20(d), which requires that “adequate barricades, lights and warning
devices . . . other traffic control measures…” be “provided and maintained
during a street closure.”   
 
b. February 23, 2023 CPRA Request 
            On
or around February 23, 2023, Petitioner submitted a CPRA request to multiple
City agencies, including the City Administrative Officer, the Police Commission’s
Investigation Division (“CID”), and LAPD. 
The February 23 CPRA request sought the following categories of records
relating to the Carnival and Incident: (1) All contracts, permits, and
applications for the Carnival; (2) All policies and procedures applicable to
the Carnival; (3) All records relating to Carnival safety measures; (4) Records
relating to any company approved to work at the Carnival or hire staff for the
Carnival; (5) All insurance policies taken out for the Carnival or that provide
coverage for Carnival claims; (6) All incident reports, witness statements, and
records relating to the Incident at the Carnival; (7) All contracts for
security at the Carnival; (8) Records that identify City employees,
contractors, or staff responsible for managing the Carnival; (9) Records that
identify City employees, contractors, or staff working at the Carnival; (10)
All communications regarding the Incident; (11) All communications regarding
security at the Carnival; (12) All communications regarding safety measures at
the Carnival; (13) All communications relating to requests one through nine.  
            On
March 3, 2023, LAPD sent Petitioner a message advising that it required a
14-day extension “due to the need to search for, collect, and review the
requested records from other Department entities which are separate from the
office processing the request.”
            LAPD
provided its response to Petitioner’s February 23 Request 25 days later, on
March 20, 2023.  On April 5, 2023, LAPD advised
Petitioner that it identified witness statements responsive to the February 23
Request but could not disclose them unless Bey’s representative provided
evidence that it represented him by April 11, 2023.  
Petitioner could not respond to the requests by LAPD’s
arbitrary deadline.  On April 18, 2023,
LAPD provided notice to Petitioner that it was closing the February 23 Request.
 LAPD did not produce any responsive
records.  
 
            c.
September 27, 2023 CPRA Request 
            On
September 27, 2023, Petitioner submitted a CPRA request to LAPD that requested
the same records as the February 23 Request. 
On October 10, 2023, LAPD responded to Petitioner’s September 27 CPRA
request, and advised that it was closing the request because it was a duplicate
of the February 23 Request.  LAPD advised:
“Should you have inquiries on current or future requests, please do not
re-submit the same request.  Rather,
please use the external message feature to inquire about status to communicate
with us.”  
That same day, Petitioner sent a message to LAPD requesting
that it reopen the February 23 Request.  Petitioner
did not receive a response.  On November
2, 2023, Petitioner sent another request that LAPD re-open the February 23
Request.  
On November 3, 2023, the LAPD responded to Petitioner’s
request as follows:
 
We have received your correspondence,
dated October 10, 2023, and November 2, 2023, requesting to reopen this
request. If you wish to proceed with items 10-13 of your request, we ask that
you narrow the scope of your request by providing a date range and keywords so
that a more focused search can be conducted. Please respond by November 10,
2023; we will reopen your request upon receipt of your response.
 
            d.
Petitioner’s November 9, 2023 Response 

            On
November 9, 2023, Petitioner’s counsel sent LAPD a copy of Petitioner’s
authorization form and responded to LAPD’s request that Petitioner narrow items
10-13 of the February 23 Request, by providing keywords for LAPD to search.  LAPD did not respond.  
            On
December 7, 2023, Petitioner sent LAPD an email requesting a status update.  LAPD again failed to respond.  
 
2. Course of
Proceedings
Petitioner filed the
Petition On December 28, 2023. 
On February 1, 2024,
the City filed its Answer. 
 
B. Standard
of Review 
            A party may seek to set aside an agency decision by
petitioning for either a writ of administrative mandamus (CCP §1094.5) or of
traditional mandamus.  CCP §1085.  A petition for traditional
mandamus is appropriate in all actions “to compel the performance of an act
which the law specially enjoins as a duty resulting from an office, trust, or
station....”  CCP §1085.   
            A traditional writ of mandate under CCP section 1085 is
the method of compelling the performance of a legal, ministerial duty.  Pomona
Police Officers’ Assn. v. City of Pomona, (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 578,
583-84.  Generally, mandamus will lie when (1) there is no plain, speedy,
and adequate alternative remedy, (2) the respondent has a duty to perform, and
(3) the petitioner has a clear and beneficial right to performance.  Id.
at 584 (internal citations omitted).  Whether a statute imposes a
ministerial duty for which mandamus is available, or a mere obligation to
perform a discretionary function, is a question of statutory
interpretation.  AIDS Healthcare Foundation v. Los Angeles County Dept.
of Public Health, (2011) 197 Cal.App.4th 693, 701. 
            No administrative record is required for traditional
mandamus to compel performance of a ministerial duty.  
 
            C. Governing Law 
            1.
The California Constitution
            The
people have the constitutional right of access to information concerning the
conduct of the people's business, and, therefore, the meetings of public bodies
and the writings of public officials and agencies shall be open to public
scrutiny.  Cal. Const. Art. 1
§3(b)(1).  A statute, court rule, or
other authority shall be broadly construed if it furthers the people's right of
access, and narrowly construed if it limits the right of access.  Cal. Const. Art. 1 §3(b)(2).  If a statute, court rule, or other authority
adopted after the effective date of this subdivision of the constitution limits
the right of access, it shall be adopted with findings demonstrating the
interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest.  Cal. Const. Art. 1 §3(b)(2).  
 
            2.
The CPRA 
The CPRA,
located at Government Code (“Govt. Code”)[2]
section 7920 et seq.
(formerly 6250 et seq.)[3],
was enacted in 1968 to safeguard the accountability of government to the
public.  San Gabriel Tribune v.
Superior Court, (1983) 143 Cal.App.3d 762, 771-72.  Section 7921 declares that “access to
information concerning the conduct of the people’s business is a fundamental
and necessary right of every person in this state.”  The CPRA’s purpose is to increase
freedom of information by giving the public access to information in the
possession of public agencies. CBS. Inc. v. Block, (1986) 42 Cal.3d 646,
651. The CPRA was intended to safeguard the accountability of government to the
public, and it makes public access to governmental records a fundamental right
of citizenship. Wilson v. Superior Court, (1996) 51 Cal.App.4th 1136,
1141. This requires maximum disclosure of the conduct of government operations.
California State University Fresno Assn., Inc. v. Superior Court (“California
State University”), (2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 810, 823. 
The CPRA makes clear that “every person” has a right to
inspect any public record. §7922.525(a) (former §6253(a)). The term “public
record” is broadly defined to include “any writing containing information
relating to the conduct of the people’s business prepared, owned, used or
retained by any state or local agency regardless of physical form or
characteristics. §7920.530 (former §6252(e)). 
The right to inspect is subject to certain exemptions, which
are narrowly construed. California State University, supra, 90 Cal.App.4th at 831. The pertinent
exemptions for this case are found in sections 7923.600, 7923.610, and 7923.615.
Upon receiving a request for a copy of public records, the agency
shall determine within ten days whether the request seeks public records in the
possession of the agency that are subject to disclosure, though that deadline
may be extended up to 14 days for “unusual circumstances.” §7922.535(a), (b).  If the agency determines that the request for records
is denied in whole or in part, the agency must respond in writing and justify
withholding any record by demonstrating that the record is exempt or that the
facts of the case the public interest served by not disclosing clearly
outweighs the public interest in disclosure. 
§§ 7922.540, 7922.000.[4]
If the agency determines that the requested records are
subject to disclosure, it shall make the records promptly available upon
payment of fees for direct costs of duplication or any applicable statutory
fee.  §7911.530.  There is no deadline expressed in a number of
days for producing the records.  Rather, section
7911.530 says the agency “shall make the records promptly available.” Section
7922.500 provides that nothing in the CPRA “shall be construed to permit an
agency to delay or obstruct the inspection or copying of public records.”
“Records requests . . . inevitably impose some burden on
government agencies. An agency is obliged to comply so long as the record can
be located with reasonable effort.” California First Amendment Coalition v.
Superior Court, (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 159, 165-66.  “Reasonable efforts do not require that
agencies undertake extraordinarily extensive or intrusive searches, however.
[Citation.] In general, the scope of an agency’s search for public records ‘need
only be reasonably calculated to locate responsive documents.’” City of San
Jose v. Superior Court, (“City of San Jose”) (2017) 2 Cal.5th 608,
627. The “CPRA does not prescribe specific methods of searching for those
documents. Agencies may develop their own internal policies for conducting
searches.  Some general principles have
emerged, however.  Once an agency
receives a CPRA request, it must ‘communicate the scope of the information
requested to the custodians of its records,’ although it need not use the
precise language of the request. [Citation.].” Ibid.
 
2. Section 7923.600 
Section 7923.600(a) exempts from
disclosure “[r]ecords of complaints to, or investigations conducted by any
state or local police agency….[and] investigatory…files complied by any…local
agency for correctional, law enforcement, or licensing purposes….”  This provision protects both records of
investigation and investigatory files.  Williams
v. Superior Court, (“Williams”) (1993) 5 Cal.4th 337,
341. The exemption protects witnesses, victims, and investigators,
secures evidence and investigative techniques, encourages candor, recognizes
the rawness and sensitivity of information in criminal investigations, and
effectively makes such investigations possible. 
Dixon v. Superior Court, (2009) 170 Cal.App.4th 1271,
1276 (coroner and autopsy reports in investigative file are exempt).[5]
 
a. Investigatory
Files
The exemption for investigatory files serves an important
purpose and is broad in nature.  Williams,
supra, 5 Cal.4th at 349, 356. 
Even though a document does not on its face purport to be an
investigatory record, it may have extraordinary significance to the
investigation warranting exemption.  Id.  Instead of adopting the federal Freedom of
Information Act’s (“FOIA”) case-by-case approach with specific criteria to
determine the exemption, the Legislature provided for the complete exemption of
such files, with disclosure of information derived from the records.  Id. at 350, 353 (criminal
investigatory file of two deputy sheriffs). 

Information in a file is investigatory material only when
the prospect of enforcement proceedings becomes “concrete and definite”.  Williams, supra, 5 Cal.4th at
355 (citing Uribe v. Howie, (“Uribe”) (1971) 19 Cal.App.3d
194).  The investigatory file exemption
does not terminate when the investigation ends; documents properly in the file
remain exempt.  Rackauckas v. Superior
Court, (“Rackauckas”) (2002) 104 Cal.App.4th 169, 174.
The California Supreme Court
addressed the distinction between former section 6254(f)’s investigatory file
and records of investigation exemptions in Haynie v. Superior Court, (“Haynie”)
(2001) 26 Cal.4th 1061.  Plaintiff
Haynie, a black male, was stopped by LASD, handcuffed, and questioned without
charges filed based on a citizen complaint. 
Id.  Haynie filed a tort
claim and separately sought and writings concerning the incident.  Id. 
LASD invoked section 6254(f) and refused to comply.  Id. 

The Hayne court noted that
case law had held that section 6254(f)’s exemption for investigatory files
applies only when the prospect of enforcement is concrete and definite.  Once this is shown, and that a record was
created for the purpose of investigation, Haynie rejected any
requirement that the agency show a valid need to withhold records, such as
evidence that the disclosure would endanger a witness or the investigation
itself.  Id. at 1071.  Haynie cautioned
that this does not mean that everything law enforcement does is shielded from
disclosure.  Officers have citizen
contacts for purposes of crime prevention and public safety that are unrelated
to either civil or criminal investigations, and records are exempt under
section 6254(f)’s protection of records of investigation only for
investigations taken for purposes of whether a violation of law has or may
occur.  Id. at 1071.
Not every file is an investigatory file for purposes of
section 7923.600(a).  The law does not provide[] that a public
agency may shield a record from public disclosure, regardless of its nature,
simply by placing it in a file labeled “investigatory.”  Uribe supra, 19 Cal.App.3d at 212-13 (routine farmer reports of pesticide
spraying were not investigatory files for licensing purposes).  So, if a document in the investigatory file
is publicly filed in a court, it is not exempt under section 7923.600(a).  See
Weaver v. Superior Court, (2014) 224 Cal. App. 4th 746, 751
("Because they were publicly filed, the charging documents Weaver seeks
are not investigatory files exempt from disclosure under the CPRA.").  Furthermore, it is the nature of a document,
and not where it is kept, that is the basis for whether it is exempt from
disclosure under the investigatory file exemption. See Comm'n on Peace Officer Standards & Training v. Superior
Court, (“POST”) (2007) 42 Cal. 4th 278, 291 (analogizing personnel
files to investigatory files and citing Williams, supra, 5 Ca1.4th at 355 for the proposition that 'the law does not
provide... that a public agency may shield a record from public disclosure,
regardless of its nature, simply by placing it in a file labelled
"investigatory’”).
In sum, a file is investigatory only
if the prospect of law enforcement is “definite and concrete” and the record
properly belongs in the file because it relates to the investigation.  Copley Press, Inc. v. Superior Court,
(“Copley”) (2006) 39 Cal.4th 1272, 1293. 
 
b.
Records of Investigation 
In contrast to investigatory files,
the Haynie court concluded that the concrete and definite
prospect of enforcement standard only applies to section 6254(f)’s exemption
for investigatory files, and “records of investigation”
are exempt on their face whether or not they are included in an investigatory
file.  Haynie, supra¸ 26 Cal.4th at 1068-69 (citing Uribe,
supra, 19 Cal.App.3d at 213 and Williams, supra, 5 Cal.4th at
356).  Any interpretation that limited records
of investigations only to those where the likelihood of enforcement has ripened
would expose the public to “the very sensitive investigative stages of
determining whether a crime has been committed or who has committed it.” Id.
at 1070.  Documents independently exempt
-- Black Panther Party v. Kehoe, (1974) 42 Cal.App.3d 645, 654 (records
of complaints), American Civil Liberties Union v. Deukmejian, (1982) 32
Cal.3d 440, 449 (intelligence information) – have been held not to be part of
the concrete and definite investigatory file requirement, and no less is true
for investigatory records.  Id. 
These records of investigation do
not lose their exempt status based on the prospect of enforcement.  Law enforcement officers may not know whether
a crime has been committed when they undertake an investigation, and the
results may be inconclusive.  For
example, a fire may be suspicious but found to be accidental after
investigation.  Id. at 1070.  Even reports from routine investigations such
as the traffic stop involving Haynie are protected.  Id. at 1070-71.  
The California Supreme Court subsequently emphasized that Haynie‘s
statement that “records of
investigation exempted under section 6254(f) encompass only those
investigations undertaken for the purpose
of determining whether a violation of law may occur or has occurred.  If a violation or potential violation is
detected, the exemption also extends to records of investigations
conducted for the purpose of uncovering information
surrounding the commission of the violation and its agency.”  American Civil Liberties Union Foundation
of Southern California v. Superior Court, (“ACLU”) (2017) 3 Cal.5th
1032, 1040.  The ACLU court then
held that LAPD’s records from scanning license plates to look for stolen cars
through automated license plate reader technology were not records of
investigation because they were not part of targeted inquiry into particular
crime.  Id. at 1042.
 
c. Exception for Complaints and Requests for
Assistance
Despite the exemptions for investigatory records and files,
state and local law enforcement agencies are required to disclose to a victim,
the victim’s authorized representative, and a covering insurance carrier
information, inter alia, a description of the property, date, time and
place of the incident, the names and addresses of involved persons and
witnesses, diagrams, and witness statements, unless the disclosure would
endanger a witness or involved person or any investigation.  §7923.605(a).
Additionally, state and local law enforcement shall
disclose, except to the extent that disclosure would endanger the safety of a
person involved in the investigation or a successful completion of the
investigation or a related investigation, the full name and occupation of every
person arrested by the agency, the person’s physical description, the time and
date of arrest and booking, the location of the arrest, the factual
circumstances surrounding the arrest, the amount of bail, the time and manner
of release or the location where the arrestee is being held, and all charges on
which he or she is being held. 
§7923.610.
Finally, subject to the same limitation that disclosure
would endanger the safety of a person involved in the investigation or a
successful completion of the investigation or a related investigation, and
subject to the restrictions of Penal Code section 841.5,[6] a
state or local law enforcement shall disclose the time, substance, and location
of all complaints or requests for assistance received by the agency and the
time and nature of the response thereto including, to the extent the
information regarding the crimes or incident investigated is recorded, the
time, date, and location of occurrence, the time and date of the report, the
name and age of the victim, the factual circumstances surrounding the crime or
incident, and a general description of any injuries, property, or weapons
involved.  §7923.615; Haynie, supra,
26 Cal.4th at 1072.
            
            d. Exemption
Based on Federal or State Law 
            Former
section 6254(k) provided in relevant part: “[N]othing in this chapter shall be
construed to require disclosure of records that are any of the following:...(k)
[r]ecords, the disclosure of which is exempted or prohibited pursuant to
federal or state law....”  This exemption
“is not an independent exemption.  It
merely incorporates other prohibitions established by law.  CBS, Inc. v. Block (1986) 42 Cal.3d
646, 656.  “In 1998, the Legislature added an article to the PRA
specifically ‘list[ing] and describ[ing]’ over 500 statutes that provide
disclosure exemptions through Government Code section 6254, subdivision (k)….”  Copley, supra, 39 Cal.4th
at 1283.
The
CPRA now provides a non-exhaustive list of all laws that may restrict
disclosure.  §§ 7930.000-7930.215.
 
3.
Enforcement
A CPRA claim to compliance with a public records request may
proceed through mandamus or declaratory relief. §7923.000. A petition for
traditional mandamus is appropriate in actions “to compel the performance of an
act which the law specially enjoins as a duty resulting from an office, trust,
or station.” CCP §1085.  Because the
petitioner may proceed through either mandamus or declaratory relief, the trial
court independently decides whether disclosure is required. See City of San Jose v. Superior
Court, (1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 1008, 1018 (appellate court independently
reviews trial court CPRA decision). No administrative record is required, and
the parties must submit admissible evidence. 
 
D. Statement of Facts[7]
            1. Background           
            On November 12, 2022, Petitioner was
working as a security guard for the Police Museum’s Fall Carnival.  Petitioner sustained injuries when third
party Steven Lamar Weems, II (“Weems”) drove his SUV through safety barriers in
attempt to evade LAPD officers (the “Incident”).  Gleizer Decl., ¶1.  
Between January and
February 2023, Petitioner’s counsel submitted identical CPRA requests to
multiple City Departments -- LAPD, Los Angeles Fire Department, Board of
Building and Safety Commissioners, Planning Commission, Bureau of Street
Services, and City Planning -- seeking records related to the Carnival and the Incident.

 
            2. Petitioner’s February 23,
2023 CPRA Request
            Petitioner’s February 23, 2023
Request to LAPD sought the following records related to the Carnival and the Incident:

(1) All contracts,
permits, and applications for the Carnival; 
(2) All policies and
procedures applicable to the Carnival; 
(3) All records relating
to Carnival safety measures; 
(4) Records relating to
any company approved to work at the Carnival or hire staff for the Carnival; 
(5) All insurance
policies taken out for the Carnival or that provide coverage for Carnival
claims; 
(6) All incident
reports, witness statements, and records relating to the Incident at the
Carnival; 
(7) All contracts for
security at the Carnival; 
(8) Records that
identify City employees, contractors, or staff responsible for managing the
Carnival; 
(9) Records that
identify City employees, contractors, or staff working at the Carnival; 
(10) All communications
regarding the Incident; 
(11) All communications
regarding security at the Carnival; 
(12) All communications
regarding safety measures at the Carnival; 
(13) All communications
relating to requests one through nine.  Gleizer
Decl., ¶1, Ex. A. 
            Broadly speaking, the Request sought
three categories of records: (1) LAPD’s investigatory records and files
relating to the Incident; (2) records relating to the Carnival event, which was
organized by a private non-profit organization, the Los Angeles Police Museum
(“Police Museum”); and (3) all communications regarding the Incident or the
Carnival event.  Orocio Decl., ¶3.
On February 24, 2023,
LAPD’s Legal Affairs Division in charge of CPRA responses (“Discovery Section”)
sent a message to Petitioner that his February 23 Request had been received and
would be assigned to a CPRA Analyst.  Orocio
Decl., Ex. B, p. 187.  
On March 2, 2023, an
analyst created a task for LAPD’s Information Technology Bureau (“ITB”) to
search for emails with the keyword “Carnival” dated between November 12, 2022,
to February 23, 2023.  Orocio Decl., Ex.
B, p. 186.  
On March 3, 2023, Petitioner
sent a message to “clarify that [his] request includes incident reports, CAD
notes, bodycam and vehicle footage.”  Orocio
Decl., Ex. B, p. 186.  That day, LAPD
notified Petitioner that it required a 14-day extension pursuant to section
7922.535 because “unusual circumstances” exist with respect to the request due
to the need to search for, collect, and review the requested records from other
Department entities which are separate from the office processing the request.”  Orocio Decl., Ex. B, p. 186.  
Four Discovery Section
analysts at one time or another were responsible for the Department’s search
for records responsive to the CPRA Request: Diego Rocha, Aminah Williams, Katherine
Reyes Moore, and Leticia Barnes.  Orocio
Decl., ¶4.  A total of 19 custodians were
contacted for the search.  Orocio Decl.,
¶4, Ex. A.
On or about March 3,
2023, Mr. Rocha submitted an email search request to ITB for any emails to or
from an LAPD email address that hit on the search term “Carnival” dated between
November 12, 2022 (the date of the Incident) to February 23, 2023 (the date of
the Request).  Orocio Delc., ¶42, Ex. B, p.
185.  That search returned 15,133 hits,
or over 30 gigabytes of data.  Id.
 ITB’s eDiscovery system, which relies on
Microsoft Purview, has a size limitation of ten gigabytes for the maximize size
of a file that is exportable.  Ex.
G.  The search was not limited to the
relevant custodians, who had not been identified by that point.  Given the large number of results returned,
the search for the general term “Carnival” was insufficiently tailored and thus
likely to contain numerous irrelevant emails.  Orocio Decl., ¶42.
The Carnival event was
organized by a private non-profit organization, the Police Museum.  As a private non-profit, the Police Museum is
run independently from LAPD.  LAPD did
not plan the Carnival, employ workers for the event, provide security, or
negotiate vendor contracts on behalf of the Police Museum.  Thus, LAPD did not have officers assigned to
assist with security at the Carnival since it was a private event.  Orocio Decl., ¶13, Ex. C.  The Discovery Section determined that Items
1–5 and 7 of the CPRA Request seek records that are not in the possession of
LAPD.  Orocio Decl., ¶13.  For similar reasons, LAPD did not have
documents responsive to Items 8 and 9.  
Orocio Decl., ¶38.
CID is the custodian for
event permits and applications.  CID “is
the regulatory arm of the Board of Police Commissioners” and includes a Permit
Processing Section that is responsible for processing and issuing permits for
businesses requiring regulation, including those that provide services at
“carnivals.”  Orocio Decl., ¶14.  Ex. D. 
The Discovery Section determined that CID might have records responsive
to the CPRA Request, such as records relating to permits and applications for
the Carnival. The Discovery Section affirmatively reached out to CID and
confirmed that such records had been provided by CID to Petitioner in February
2023. Orocio Decl., ¶15.  On or about
March 20, 2023, LAPD responded to Petitioner that CID “has already provided
records responsive to your request.”  Orocio
Decl., ¶16, Ex. B, p. 174.
 
            3. LAPD’s March 20, 2023 Response

            LAPD responded to Petitioner’s February
23 Request on March 20, 2023.  Gleizer
Decl., ¶3, Ex. C.  LAPD advised that
records responsive to Items 1-5, & 7 were previously produced by CID in
response to a separate request.  Gleizer
Decl., ¶3, Ex. C.  LAPD asserted that it
did not possess responsive records for Items 8 and 9.  Ex. C.  LAPD asserted that any records identified for
Item 6 were investigatory and denied Petitioner’s request on that basis.  Ex. C. 
LAPD further advised that it was continuing to search for witness
statements and would produce responsive nonexempt records.  Ex. C. 

LAPD’s response also informed
Petitioner that the “requested records may be available in response to a
subpoena or court order” and provided the service address for LAPD’s Risk
Management and Legal Affairs Division.  Id.
 It is the Discovery Section’s practice
to so inform requesters who seek investigatory records because, even though
investigatory records are exempt from disclosure vis-à-vis the general public
in response to a CPRA request pursuant to section 7923.600, such records might
otherwise be available through discovery requests or a court order in a civil
action or criminal proceeding.  Orocio
Decl., ¶20.  LAPD added: “Should any
records be located, to the extent the information is recorded, a summary
including the time, date, and location of occurrence, the time and date of the
call, the name and age of the victim, and a brief statement of the
circumstances can be made available to you upon request.”  Ex. C.  In
so stating, LAPD was informing Petitioner that, if responsive records were
located, the Department would provide him with disclosable information from
those records as specified in section 7923.615.  Orocio Decl., ¶20.
With respect to Items
10–13, the Discovery Section noted that ITB had “conducted an email query for
your request,” which yielded more than 15,000 Department-wide email hits for
the search term “Carnival,” but that the scope of the search would need to be
narrowed and more focused given ITB’s search export system limitations.  Ex. C. 
Thus, the Discovery Section asked Petitioner to respond by March 26,
2023 to “narrow the scope of [the] request so that a more focused search can be
conducted” as to Items 10 through 13 of the February 23 Request.  Ex. C. 
Petitioner did not respond.  Orocio
Decl., ¶23. 
            On April 5, 2023, the Discovery
Section contacted Petitioner to notify him that witness statements had been
located and were in review and requested a “signed representation agreement or
affidavit acknowledging that you represent the victim as an authorized
representative or an insurance carrier so that we may proceed with your request
pursuant to Government [Code] Section 7923.605[(a)]. In order to ensure an
accurate and timely response to your request, please respond by April 11,
2023.”  Orocio Decl., ¶22, Ex. B, p. 171.

            Petitioner failed to respond to the
Discovery Section’s April 5, 2023, email. 
Orocio Decl., ¶24.  Nor did he
provide a signed representation agreement or affidavit of his counsel’s relationship
to him as requested to release witness statements.  Orocio Decl., ¶23.  Thus, on April 18, 2023, the LAPD closed
Petitioner’s February 23 Request.  Gleizer
Decl., ¶4, Ex. D; Orocio Decl., ¶23, Ex. B, pp. 169-70.  The Discovery Section emphasized: “Should you
wish to provide us with the required information, please respond to this email
and we will reopen your request.”  Id.

Petitioner made no
additional contact with the Discovery Section for approximately six months.  Orocio Decl., ¶24.  
 
4. The Re-Opened Request
            On September 27, 2023, Petitioner
submitted a new Request that duplicated the original February 23 Request.  Orocio Decl., ¶25, Ex. E.  As is its practice whenever it receives a
duplicative CPRA request, the Discovery Section informed Petitioner that it had
closed the September 27 Request but invited him to reopen his original February
23 Request.  Orocio Decl., ¶26.  
            On October 10 and November 2, 2023,
Petitioner sent the Discovery Section emails requesting that LAPD reopen the February
23 Request.  Gleizer Decl., ¶¶ 5-8, Exs.
E-H.  The Discovery Section responded on
November 3, 2023, and advised that, in order to proceed with the Request,
Petitioner needed to narrow the scope of Items 10-13 by providing a date range
and keywords.  Gleizer Decl., ¶9, Ex. I.
            On November 9, 2023, Petitioner
submitted proof of representation to LAPD and addressed its request to narrow
the scope of Items 10-13.  Gleizer Decl.,
¶10, Ex. J; Orocio Decl., ¶28, Ex. B, p. 163. 
Petitioner’s counsel stated he was “not willing” to narrow Items 10
through 12.  Orocio Decl., ¶45, Ex. B, p.
163.  For Item 13, he proposed 22 search
terms and phrases: “(1) barricades; (2) vehicle / vehicular access; (3)
barriers; (4) sand bags; (5) safety; (6) security; (7) witness; (8) street
access; (9) risk(s); (10) pedestrians; (11) cement; (12) rail(s); (13)
concrete; (14) safety inspection; (15) safety check; (16) incident report; (17)
Weems; (18) hit-and-run; (19) crash; (20) Porsche; (21)
injured/injuring/injury; and (22) arrest.” Ex. B, p. 163.  
Terms such as “safety,”
“witness,” and “vehicle” are used with very high frequency within a law
enforcement agency.  Orocio Decl.,
¶45.  Petitioner did not provide a date
range or the names of custodians he proposed to search.  Orocio Decl., ¶45.  
Petitioner sent a follow
up email on December 7, 2023 and did not receive a response.  Gleizer Decl., ¶¶ 11-12, Exs. I, K.  Petitioner filed the Petition on December 28,
2023.  Gleizer Decl., ¶12, Ex. L.
 
            5. Post-Petition
Meet-and-Confer 
            LAPD had not produced any records in
response to the Request when it filed its Answer to the Petition on February 1,
2024.  Gleizer Decl., ¶13, Ex. M.  
On March 27 and 29,
2024, the parties’ counsel met and conferred via phone and email regarding the February
23 Request.  Gleizer Decl., ¶¶ 14-17, Exs.
N-O.  LAPD confirmed that it did not
possess records responsive to Items 1-5 and 7 beyond the records previously produced
by CID.  Gleizer Decl., ¶14, Ex. N.  LAPD confirmed that its search identified
records responsive to Item 6, which it would produce, subject to redactions.  Gleizer Decl., ¶¶ 15.  
            Petitioner’s counsel argued that it
would not be an undue burden for LAPD to review and identify responsive records
from the 15,000 emails.  Gleizer Decl.,
¶16.  However, if it was, counsel provided
a list of search terms for LAPD to use. 
Gleizer Decl., ¶16.  Counsel proposed
using a date range of November 11, 2021, to November 2, 2023, for all searches
with the exception of the terms “Weems,” “Bennett,” “Bey,” and “November 12
Incident/accident” which Petitioner proposed limiting to a range of November
11, 2022 to November 2, 2023.  Gleizer
Decl., ¶16; Gleizer Decl., Ex. N.  
LAPD rejected both the
search terms and date ranges proposed by Petitioner, asserting that the search
proposed would require “approximately 30 separate searches” and was
“infeasible.”  Gleizer Decl., ¶17, Ex. O.
 On March 29, 2024, Petitioner objected
to LAPD’s attempt to limit the scope of search. 
Gleizer Decl., ¶18, Ex. P.
 
            6. The April 25, 2025
Production
Despite the lack of
agreement, LAPD informed Petitioner on April 19, 2024 that it planned to
disclose a batch of records the following week. 
Gleizer Decl., ¶21, Ex. Ex. S.  After
Petitioner raised concerns about the scope of the search in light of the failed
agreement, LAPD advised that if, after the production, Petitioner believed “there
may be further responsive records in the LAPD's possession, we can have that
discussion at our meet and confer.”  Gleizer
Decl., ¶21, Ex. S. 
In April 2024, the
Discovery Section requested that ITB run an email search for the keywords
“Carnival” or “security” or “Police Museum” between October 1, 2022 to November
12, 2022, sent to or from two Police Museum contacts, Erica Arias and Cynthia
Jimenez.  Orocio Decl., ¶46.  This search returned 49 emails plus their
attachments. 
            On approximately April 12, 2024, the
Discovery Section requested that ITB run two separate email searches across the
17 relevant custodians who had been identified. The first search was for the
keyword “LA Police Museum” within 20 words of any of the following keywords:
“incident report” or “Weems” or “hit-and-run” or “crash” or “Porsche Cayenne”
or injur* or “Bennett” or “Bey”, for the date range from November 11, 2022 to
November 2, 2023.  Orocio Decl., ¶48, Ex.
B, pp. 152-53.  A second search was requested
for the keyword “Carnival” within 20 words of any of the following keywords
“incident report” or “Weems” or “hit-and-run” or “crash” or “Porsche Cayenne”
or injur* or “Bennett” or “Bey”, for the date range from November 11, 2022 to
November 2, 2023.  Orocio Decl., ¶48, pp.
149-50. 
On April 25, 2024, LAPD
made its first production of 11 documents in response to Petitioner’s February
23 Request.  Gleizer Decl., ¶22, Ex. T.  The documents produced were emails and
attachments and the majority included some redactions.  Gleizer Decl., ¶¶ 22-23, Ex. T.   LAPD advised that records responsive to Items
1 through 5 and 7 already had been produced by CID.  Gleizer Decl., ¶23; see Ex. U.
 
7. The May 2024
Searches
            On May 1, 2024, Petitioner met and
conferred with LAPD regarding the April 25 Production.  Gleizer Decl., ¶¶ 24-25.  During the meeting, LAPD advised it conducted
several email searches “and all responsive, nonprivileged records from those
searches have been produced.”  Gleizer
Decl., ¶24.  LAPD advised that its search
used the terms originally proposed by LAPD in its March 27, 2024 email and that
the search was limited to emails of LAPD custodians involved in investigating
the Incident.  Gleizer Decl., ¶24.  Petitioner raised concerns regarding the
failure to include custodians who were involved in planning and security for
the Carnival and the failure to search for non-email records.  Gleizer Decl., ¶25.  
            Following the May 1, 2024 meeting, LAPD
informed Petitioner that it would expand its search based on the terms proposed
in Petitioner’s March 27 email and would add custodians related to planning and
security for the Carnival.  Gleizer Decl.,
¶26, Ex. V.  The email also stated that
LAPD “agreed to do some digging into whether there are any responsive non-email
records in the Department’s possession.” 
Gleizer Decl., ¶26, Ex. V.  Petitioner
took issue with LAPD’s resistance to searching for non-email records.  Gleizer Decl., ¶27, Ex. W.
On approximately May 9,
2024, the Discovery Section requested two more email searches across 19
custodians, consisting of the 17 custodians who had previously been searched
plus two custodians identified by Petitioner. 
The first search was for emails in the date range from November 11, 2022
to November 2, 2023 and hitting on the keyword “Carnival” and any of the
following keywords: “barricades” or “vehicle” or “vehicular access” or
“barriers” or “sand bags” or “safety” or “security” or “witness” or “street
access” or “risk” or “pedestrians” or “cement” or “rail” or “concrete” or
“safety inspection” or “safety check” or “incident report” or “Weems” or
“hit-and-run” or “crash” or “Porsche” or “injured” or “injury” or “arrest” or
“MLK” or “Trinity” or “South Central”, for the date range from November 11,
2022 to November 2, 2023.  Orocio Decl., Ex.
B, pp. 147-48.  The second search was for
emails hitting on the keywords “Police Museum” and any of the following
keywords: “barricades” or “vehicle” or “vehicular access” or “barriers” or
“sand bags” or “safety” or “security” or “witness” or “street access” or “risk”
or “pedestrians” or “cement” or “rail” or “concrete” or “safety inspection” or
“safety check” or “incident report” or “Weems” or “hit-and-run” or “crash” or
“Porsche” or “injured” or “injury” or “arrest” or “MLK” or “Trinity” or “South
Central”. Ex. B, pp. 145-46. 
The first search
returned approximately ten email hits, although only one was determined to be
responsive and it had been previously produced. The second search returned
approximately 104 email hits, of which two were determined to be responsive and
were queued for production.  Orocio
Decl., ¶51.
On approximately May 22,
2024, the Discovery Section requested an email search across 19 custodians for
the date range from October 1 to November 12, 2022 and the keyword “Carnival”
and any of the following keywords: “barricades” or “vehicle” or “vehicular
access” or “barriers” or “sand bags” or “safety” or “security” or “witness” or
“street access” or “risk” or “pedestrians” or “cement” or “rail” or “concrete”
or “safety inspection” or “safety check” or “incident report” or “Weems” or
“hit-and-run” or “crash” or “Porsche” or “injured” or “injury” or “arrest” or
“MLK” or “Trinity” or “South Central”. 
Orocio Decl., ¶53, Ex. B, pp. 135-37.
In early June 2024, ITB
completed this request. This search returned approximately nine emails, of
which five were responsive. Most of the responsive emails had been previously
produced, but the remaining were queued for production.  Orocio Decl., ¶55.
It is not true that the
Discovery Section failed to include all key terms proposed by Petitioner,
failed to include terms such as “LA Police Museum”, and only conducted two
searches for email records. The Discovery Section conducted three searches
containing the search terms “Police Museum” or “LA Police Museum”, and
conducted a total of six email searches.  Orocio Decl., ¶57.  
It also is not true that
the search was almost exclusively limited to emails.  The Discovery Section searched for, reviewed,
and made redactions to investigatory records and files, searched for witness
statements, staff lists, and permits for the Carnival, and asked all relevant
custodians whether they had sent or received any texts related to the Incident
on their personal or any Department-issued cell phone, and whether they had any
handwritten notes or drawings concerning the Incident.  None of the relevant custodians reported
having texts, handwritten notes, or drawings concerning the Incident.  Orocio Decl., ¶58.
 
8. The June 10,
2024 Production
On June 10, 2024,
Petitioner received LAPD’s second record production, which totaled 121 pages
and was heavily redacted.  Gleizer Decl.,
¶28, Ex. X.  LAPD’s document production
included (i) a small number of email records between LAPD and the Police Museum
regarding the Carnival, and (ii) certain investigatory records that were
redacted in a manner to disclose just the items of information to which Petitioner
was entitled under sections 7923.605, 7923.610, and 7923.615.  Orocio Decl., ¶¶ 56, 59.  The June 10 production included redacted copies
of the arrest and Traffic Crash Reports for the Incident.  Gleizer Decl., ¶28, Ex. Y.  The June 10 production cited to exemptions
which appeared on the slip sheets for records withheld in their entirety.  Gleizer Decl., ¶30.  No additional context was provided.  Gleizer Decl., ¶30.  
            Petitioner asked LAPD to provide the
specific grounds for its redactions and also asked LAPD to confirm that pages
withheld in their entirety did not contain relevant, non-exempt material that
could be reasonably segregated.  Gleizer
Decl., ¶¶ 30-32, Ex. Z.  LAPD responded
that the exemptions were identified on the slip sheets of the June 10 production.  Gleizer Decl., ¶33, Ex. AA.  LAPD advised that signatures and initials
were redacted as a precaution against forgery and were exempt under sections 7927.700
and 7922.000 on the basis that “disclosure would constitute an unwarranted
invasion of personal privacy and/or would not serve the public interest.”  Gleizer Decl., ¶¶ 30-33.  LAPD also advised that “[p]ersonal
information such as cell phone numbers and personal email addresses were also
redacted per 7927.700 and 7922.000.”  Gleizer
Decl., ¶33.  Petitioner requested a
privilege log, which LAPD denied.  Gleizer
Decl., ¶33, Ex. AA. 
            On July 1, 2024, Petitioner and LAPD
met and conferred on the adequacy of the search.  Petitioner noted that photographs and videos were
referenced in the police reports produced on June 10 that were never produced.  Gleizer Decl., ¶35.  LAPD responded that it had not obtained those
records, but they were privileged and not subject to disclosure.  Gleizer Decl., ¶35.  Petitioner further noted that the June 10
production referred to additional communications between the Police Museum and
LAPD, an ICS Form, and personnel accounting that had not been produced.  Gleizer Decl., ¶35, Ex. AB. 
The parties also
discussed the unredacted copy of the Traffic Crash Report that Petitioner
obtained from a LAPD detective in or around December of 2022.  Bennett Decl., ¶¶ 2-5, Ex C; Gleizer Decl.,
¶36.  The unredacted report called into
question LAPD’s redactions to the police and arrest report.  LAPD represented that its version of the police
report was different from the unredacted report and that its objections were
valid.  Gleizer Decl., ¶35.  
On June 24, 2024, Orocio
was deposed as LAPD’s PMQ.  Orocio Decl., ¶11.  Gordon Decl., Ex. G.  Other than the registrar of actions
for the PMQ deposition, no further records were produced by LAPD.  Gleizer Decl., ¶¶ 37-38.
The Discovery Section
reached out to the appropriate LAPD personnel to ascertain whether ICS form
2.14 or personnel accounting form exist. 
Neither was created because the Carnival was an in-house event.  Orocio Decl., ¶60.  
The Discovery Section
does not access evidentiary records uploaded to evidence.com in connection with
CPRA requests.  Evidence.com is LAPD’s
platform that houses evidence for criminal investigations.  Evidence collected at crime scenes and stored
at evidence.com by the Department is, by definition, investigatory in nature
and is never disclosed in response to CPRA requests.   Orocio Decl., ¶61.
As for the redaction of
personal emails, phone numbers, and other personal information, the Discovery
Section's policy and practice is to redact the contact information of private
individuals or businesses (while disclosing the identities of such individuals
or businesses) because the invasion of an individual's privacy must be
counterbalanced against the public's need for the information. The Discovery
Section does not believe there is a public interest in the contact information
of a private individual or business, as the disclosure of such contact
information does not reveal anything about the public agency's conduct of its
duties.  Orocio Decl., ¶62.
The Incident involved a
violation of the law that led to a police investigation and a pending criminal
trial against the suspect. The Discovery Section does not produce investigatory
records in response to CPRA requests because such records are exempt from
disclosure under the CPRA. Thus, LAPD’s investigation records regarding the Incident,
including police reports, photographs, videos, and other evidence, are
categorically exempt, in their entirety, pursuant to the investigatory records
exemption of section 7923.600.  Orocio
Decl., ¶7.
Petitioner is not
entitled to the investigatory records themselves, but rather to certain items
of information from the records, as specified in sections 7923.605, 7923.610,
and/or 7923.615.  Orocio Decl., ¶8.  The Discovery Section provided Petitioner a
one-page sheet containing the information that is required to be disclosed
pursuant to section 7923.610.  Orocio
Decl., ¶32, Ex. F.  LAPD also provided
certain items of information pursuant to section 7923.605(a), which provides
for limited disclosure of specified information only “to the victims of an
incident, or an authorized representative thereof”.  Orocio Decl., ¶33.  Finally, LAPD provided redacted investigatory
records containing information pursuant to section 7923.615.  Orocio Decl., ¶34.
 
9. Reply Evidence
During his
deposition, PMQ Orocio testified that he did not know if the City searched for
text messages, photographs, videos, or personal cell phones.  Gordon Decl., Ex. G (Orocio
Depo), pp. 70 (texts and handwritten
notes), 90–91 (texts or cell phones), 115–16 (handwritten notes, photographs,
videos, faxes, personal cell phones).  The
following exchange took place during Orocio’s deposition:
 
“Q: Okay.…. And your testimony is anything
outside of emails, you do not know, correct? 
A: Correct. 
Q: And you understand that you’re binding the
City with that response? 
A: Yes.”  Ex. G, pp. 100–01.
 
On August 15, 2024,
LAPD served a set of Special Interrogatories on Petitioner seeking information about
CPRA requests Petitioner sent to other City agencies regarding the Incident.  As part of Petitioner’s search for responsive
information, Petitioner identified emails exchanged directly between Petitioner
and LAPD detectives in December of 2022 which LAPD failed to identify and
produce as part of its record search.  Supp. Gleizer Decl., ¶2.  Petitioner produced the emails along with his
discovery responses in a September 22, 2024 email to LAPD’s counsel.  Id., ¶3.  
After receiving the
records, LAPD’s counsel responded on September 23, 2024:
 
“I can only speculate that
they were not identified previously because they did not hit on the search
terms that you or I proposed, notably ‘Carnival’ or ‘Police Museum.’  As
you should know, now is well past the time to be bringing up new search
terms.  The proper time to do so was months ago, when we were meeting and
conferring about the Request, search terms, custodians, etc. If you had
at any point informed us, during discovery, of Mr. Bennett's email address or
the fact that he had apparently communicated with someone at the LAPD, on his
own accord, we could have included his email address in our searches, but it
seems you were just made aware of those communications by your client as well.”  Supp. Gleizer Decl., ¶5, Ex. AG.
 
Petitioner’s counsel responded that same day that LAPD did
not run the search terms Petitioner had proposed, which included the term
“Bennett.”  Supp. Gleizer Decl., ¶6, Ex.
AH.
Petitioner filed a civil lawsuit for his injuries stemming
from the Incident (LASC Case No. 23STCV22661), which named, among others, the
City and the Police Museum as defendants. On July 2, 2024, Petitioner sent the
Police Museum a request for production of documents in that case.  Supp. Gleizer Decl., ¶8, Ex. AI.  Petitioner received the Police Museum’s
response on September 5, 2024, which produced a number of documents submitted
to the City as part of the Carnival’s planning and permitting process.  Supp. Gleizer Decl., ¶9, Ex. AJ.
The production included an Indemnification and Hold
Harmless Agreement in favor of the City, a Petition signed by local property
owners in the area affected by the Carnival street closure, and the final
invoice from the City issued to the Police Museum, a LAFD Division 5 permit application,
and a different version of the Carnival Event Agreement than CID produced.  Supp. Gleizer Decl., ¶10, Ex. AJ.
The production also included various records from the
City’s Special Events Portal for the Carnival. Ex. AJ.  LAPD also produced records reflecting the
Special Events Portal as part of its April 25, 2024 production.  Gleizer Decl., Ex. T, p. 9.  However, the variations produced by the Police
Museum include messages exchanged between the Police Museum and the City
regarding street closure requirements and barricades, identified various
documents submitted by the Police Museum to the City, and discussed status of
the permit process.  Supp. Gleizer Decl.,
¶12.
 
D. Analysis
Petitioner seeks mandamus to compel the City to conduct a
reasonable search and produce additional unredacted records.[8]  
 
1.
Exempted Records
a.
The Police Reports
Petitioner seeks unredacted copies of a
“Police and Arrest Report”.  Pet.  Op. Br. at 10.  Item 6 of the Request expressly sought law
enforcement records of the LAPD’s investigation into the Hit and Run Incident,
including “incident reports, witness statements, and records relating to the
Incident[.]”  Orocio Decl., ¶¶
18-19.  The Incident involved a violation
of the law that led to a police investigation and a pending criminal trial
against the suspect.  Orocio Decl., ¶7.  The redacted investigatory records and/or
information produced by LAPD include (1) a Follow-Up Investigation Report for a
Felony Hit and Run (Ex. B, p. 81); (2) an Arrest Report for a Felony Hit and
Run (Ex. B, pp. 82-102); (3) a Traffic Collision and Arrest Status Report (Ex.
B, pp. 103-04); (4) a Traffic Crash Report (Ex. B, pp. 105-19);  (5) a Vehicle Report for an impounded vehicle
(“Impound Report”) (Ex. B, p. 120-21), and (6) a one-page sheet containing the
information disclosed pursuant to section 7923.610 (requiring
disclosure of arrest information to the public) (Ex. B, p. 66).  
Petitioner
first notes that LAPD asserted that pages withheld from the Police and Arrest
Report are exempt from disclosure pursuant to sections 7922.000 (catch-all
balancing),[9] 7923.600 (law enforcement investigatory
records and files), 7927.700 (personnel and medical files based on invasion of
privacy), and 7927.705 (exemption based on federal or state law
privilege).  Gleizer Decl., ¶¶ 29-30, Ex.
Y, pp. 81-121.  Yet, LAPD failed to
provide any justification supporting its redactions to the police reports
beyond its references to the CPRA statute. “Conclusory or boilerplate assertions that merely recite the statutory
standards are not sufficient.” Golden Door Properties, LLC v.
Superior Court of San Diego County, (“Golden Door”) (2020) 53
Cal.App.5th 733, 790.  Pet.
Op. Br. at 7.
This is an issue of
timing.  Although Petitioner complains
that LAPD did not explain why an exemption applies (e.g., Pet. Op. Br.
at 8), it is not obligated to do so until trial.  Only then does LAPD have the burden of
proving its exemptions.  During the pre-litigation
process, the agency must respond in writing and justify withholding any record
by demonstrating that the record is exempt. 
§§ 7922.540, 7922.000.  Where an
agency withholds responsive records on the basis of a statutory exemption, “the
agency . . . must disclose that fact.”  Haynie,
supra, 26 Cal.4th at 1072 (citing section 7922.000).  This task may be performed by citing the
exemptions relied upon for each request in the agency’s written response.  At trial, the agency bears the burden of proving
exemption.  §7922.000.  
The City relies on
the investigatory record exemption, not the investigatory file exemption, in section 7923.600(a). 
It is the nature of a document, and not where it is kept, that is the
basis for whether it is exempt from disclosure. See POST, supra,
42 Cal. 4th 291.  “Records of investigation” are exempt on their face whether or
not they are located in an investigatory file. 
Haynie, supra¸ 26
Cal.4th at 1068-69 (citing Uribe, supra,
19 Cal.App.3d at 213 and Williams,
supra, 5 Cal.4th at
356).  Records of investigation also do
not lose their exempt status based on the prospect of enforcement.  Id. at 1070.  Even reports from routine investigations such
as the traffic stop involving Haynie are protected.  Id. at 1070-71.  Records of investigation encompass
only investigations undertaken for the
purpose of determining whether a violation of law may occur or has
occurred.  If a violation or potential
violation is detected, the exemption also extends to records of investigations
conducted for the purpose of uncovering information surrounding the
commission of the violation.  ACLU,
supra, 3 Cal.5th at 1040.
The City contends
that LAPD does not need to do more to prove that the records of investigation exemption
applies because it is undisputed that the sought-after records are law
enforcement records of a felony criminal investigation.  See Bennett Decl., ¶6; Williams, supra, 5
Cal.4th at 353-55; Castanares v. Superior
Court, (“Castanares”)
(2023) 98 Cal.App.5th 295, 305-06; Haynie, supra 26
Cal.4th at 1068.  
Petitioner
criticize LAPD’s lumping together the five different reports as investigatory
records without attempting to distinguish them. 
Reply at 3.  LAPD makes an unsubstantiated
claim that it is “undisputed that the sought-after records are law enforcement
records of a felony criminal investigation.”  But this issue is disputed.  The fact that the incident involved a crime
does not mean each of the police reports is an investigatory record exempt from
disclosure under the CPRA.  See Pasadena
Police Officers Assn. v. Superior Court, (2015) 240 Cal.App.4th 268,
289 (“The mere fact that the Report contains privileged information does not
bestow protected status on the entire document”); Williams, supra,
5 Cal.4th at 357 (“[a] public agency may not shield a document from disclosure
with the bare assertion that it relates to an investigation).  Reply at 3-4.
While the City could have done a better job
of evaluating the police reports, most are exempt investigatory records on
their face.  The Incident involved a
violation of the law that led to a police investigation and a pending criminal
trial against the suspect.  Orocio Decl.,
¶7.  The redacted investigatory records
produced by LAPD include (1) a Follow-Up Investigation Report for a Felony Hit
and Run (Ex. B, p. 81); (2) an Arrest Report for a Felony Hit and Run (Ex. B,
pp. 82-102); (3) a Traffic Collision and Arrest Status Report (Ex. B, pp.
103-04); (4) a Traffic Crash Report (Ex. B, pp. 105-19);  and (5) a vehicle Impound Report (Ex. B, p.
120-21).  The first three directly relate
to a criminal investigation and the Traffic Crash Report also is investigatory,
albeit administrative in nature.  However, the Impound Report appears to be
clerical only and is not an investigation undertaken for the purpose of determining whether a
violation of law may occur or has occurred. 
As such, it is not a protected record of investigation and must be
produced. 
 
b. Required Disclosure of Information
Pursuant to Sections 7923.605, 7923.610, and 7923.615
Despite the
exemptions for investigatory records and files in section 7923.600, state and
local law enforcement agencies are required to disclose to a victim, the
victim’s authorized representative, and a covering insurance carrier
information, inter alia, a description of the property, date, time
and place of the incident, the names and addresses of involved persons and
witnesses, diagrams, and witness statements, unless the disclosure would
endanger a witness or involved person or any investigation.  §7923.605(a).
Additionally, state
and local law enforcement shall disclose, except to the extent that disclosure
would endanger the safety of a person involved in the investigation or a
successful completion of the investigation or a related investigation, the
full name and occupation of every person arrested by the agency, the person’s
physical description, the time and date of arrest and booking, the location of
the arrest, the factual circumstances surrounding the arrest, the amount of
bail, the time and manner of release or the location where the arrestee is
being held, and all charges on which he or she is being held.  §7923.610.
Finally, subject to
the same limitation that disclosure would endanger the safety of a person
involved in the investigation or a successful completion of the investigation
or a related investigation, and subject to the restrictions of Penal Code
section 841.5,[10] a state or local law enforcement shall
disclose the time, substance, and location of all complaints or requests for
assistance received by the agency and the time and nature of the response
thereto including, to the extent the information regarding the crimes or
incident investigated is recorded, the time, date, and location of occurrence,
the time and date of the report, the name and age of the victim, the factual
circumstances surrounding the crime or incident, and a general description of
any injuries, property, or weapons involved. 
§7923.615; Haynie, supra, 26 Cal.4th at 1072.
Petitioner argues
that he is a victim and the police reports contain facts and other related
information expressly disclosable under sections 7923.605, 7923.610,
7923.615.   Reply at 3-4.
The City responds
that the CPRA’s investigatory records exemption is a “broad exemption from
disclosure” that “requires law enforcement agencies to provide certain
information derived from the records about the incidents under
investigation….”  Williams, supra,
5 Cal.4th at 349 (italics added). 
The CPRA only requires that the agency disclose the specified information
from the investigatory records, not the records themselves.  Haynie, supra, 26
Cal.4th at 1072.  Opp. at 11.  The City has disclosed a one-page sheet
containing the information required by section 7923.610 concerning the arrestee
(Ex. B, p. 66) and also has provided the information required by section 7923.605
and 7923.615.  Opp. at 12.
Assuming
the redactions are appropriate, LAPD has complied with its obligations under sections
7923.605, 7923.610, 7923.615.  See
post.
 
c.
Vehicle Code Sections 20012 and 20014[11]
All
required accident reports, and supplemental reports, shall be without prejudice
to the person reporting and shall be for the confidential use of the DMV and
CHP, except that the law enforcement agency to which an accident was reported
shall disclose the entire contents of the reports to any person who may have a
proper interest, including the drivers involved or any person injured, and any
attorney who declares under penalty of perjury that he represents any of these
persons.  §20012.
All
required accident reports and supplemental reports made to the CHP by any peace
officer shall immediately be made available for the confidential use of any
division in the DMV, the confidential use of the Department of Transportation,
and, for accidents on highways other than state highways, for the confidential
use of the local authority having jurisdiction over that highway.  §20014.
Petitioner
argues that section 20012 obligates law enforcement agencies to disclose the
entire contents of “[a]ll required accident reports, and supplemental reports”
to any injured person named in the report or their representative.  See State of California ex rel. Dept
of Transportation v. Superior Court, (“Hall”) (1985) 37
Cal.3d 847, 853 (section 20012 requires disclosure of an entire report to all
persons involved in the reported accident). 
Courts have further held that investigative reports prepared by law
enforcement officials are subject to disclosure under section 20014.  State ex rel. Department of Transportation
v. Superior Court of Ventura County, (“Paniagua”) (2022) 77
Cal.App.5th 998, 1003-04 (traffic accident reports disclosable to proper person
of interest).  Based on sections 20012
and 20014, Petitioner contends that he is entitled to an unredacted copy of the
police reports as a matter of law.  Pet.
Op. Br. at 8.
The
City responds that section
20012 does not specify what “required accident reports” must be disclosed, much
less require the disclosure of the different law enforcement investigatory
records at issue here, including arrest records.  Similarly, section 20014 is wholly
inapposite, as it pertains to the disclosure of accident reports and related
reports to other government entities identified in the statute, not to members
of the public or even to injured persons. 
Opp. at 12.
The
City contends that Petitioner’s argument should thus be rejected because LAPD
properly disclosed, inter alia, the names and addresses of all parties
or witnesses to the Incident as specified under section 7923.605(a).  See Williams, supra at
353 (law enforcement agencies must “disclose . . . the names and addresses
of witnesses and persons involved in the incidents under investigation”, while remaining
free to “preserv[e] the exemption for the records themselves”); Haynie, supra 26
Cal.4th at 1072 (same); 65
Ops. Cal. Atty. Gen. 563, at *4 (1982) (“We are aware of no statute which
provides special access to complaint and arrest records by the victim. . .
providing information to the agency contained in such report. An informant’s
right of access to complaint and arrest records is the same as that of any
other member of the public.”).  Opp. at
13.
The
City argues that Petitioner’s two cited cases arose in entirely different
contexts from this proceeding and neither case involved the CPRA’s
investigatory records exemption.  Hall
concerned a criminal defendant’s subpoena duces tecum to an agency for records.  37 Cal.3d at 850.  The court held that a “person charged with a
crime arising from an automobile accident may establish a ‘proper interest’” under
section 20012 in
discovering accident records that could lead to relevant and admissible
evidence in the defendant’s defense. Id. at 855.  Unlike Petitioner, the defendant requested
reports “with names, addresses, or other [identifying] information
deleted”.  See id. at 852.  Paniagua involved a motion to compel
discovery responses to interrogatories that requested the names, addresses, and
phone numbers for parties or witnesses to certain traffic accidents, in a civil
litigation proceeding.  77 Cal.App.5th at
1003-04.  Opp. at 12-13.
Petitioner replies that Vallejos v. California Highway
Patrol, (1979) 89 Cal.App.3d 781, analyzed the application of section
20012 to records claimed to be exempt under the investigatory records
privilege.  The petitioners claimed they
were illegally charged for copies of traffic accident reports in violation of
section 783.6257.  Id. at
782-83.  The court held that the CPRA and
section 20012 created an exemption for parties involved in an incident and
persons of interest: “While the general public is denied access to this
information such is not true with respect to parties involved in the incident .
. .” Id. at 786.  Reply at 4.
Petitioner contends that the City’s argument
that section 20014 is limited to government entities ignores Paniagua,
which ordered the disclosure of unredacted accident reports to plaintiff after
determining they had a proper interest in the reports.  77 Cal.App.5th at 1004–05.  Paniagua explained that reports subject
to disclosure under section 20014, including investigative reports, are
disclosable “‘on the same showing which requires disclosure of section 20012
reports.”  77 Cal.App.5th at 1003–04 (quoting
Hall, supra, 37 Cal.3d at 857–58). 
Reply at 5.
Petitioner adds that LAPD’s argument that “section
20012 does not specify what ‘required accident reports’ must be disclosed” is
not well taken.  LAPD’s own website
provides, “Traffic Collision Reports may be released to authorized persons such
as victims . . . as provided in Section 20012 of the Vehicle Code.”  See Pet. RJN Ex. A.  LAPD’s website further states Traffic Crash
Reports involving an arrest can be ordered by mail.  Ibid.  Thus,
according to LAPD, “required accident reports” include, at a minimum, Traffic
Crash Reports, including those involving an arrest.  Additionally, required accident reports under
sections 20012 and 20014 include reports that must be filed by persons involved
in an incident that results in injuries or death (§§ 20008, 20009), along with
accident and investigative reports prepared by law enforcement.  Accordingly, the express provisions of the
Vehicle Code and supporting case law demonstrate that LAPD is required to
provide Petitioner unredacted copies of each of the police reports.  Reply at 5-6.
Both sides are wrong.  As stated, the police reports include (1) a Follow-Up
Investigation Report for a Felony Hit and Run, (2) an Arrest Report for a
Felony Hit and Run, (3) a Traffic Collision and Arrest Status Report, (4) a
Traffic Crash Report, and (5) an Impound Report.  The first three directly relate to a criminal
investigation.  They are not accident
reports or supplemental accident reports governed by section 20012 and 20014,
and they remain exempt under section 7923.600(a).
The Impound
Report is clerical and not an investigation undertaken for the purpose of determining whether a
violation of law may occur or has occurred. 
As such, it is not a protected record of investigation, and the court
already has ordered its production. 
The Traffic Crash Report also is
investigatory.  Its purpose is to investigate
the traffic crash for administrative and civil liability purposes, but not
criminal purposes.  As a record of
investigation undertaken for  the purpose
of determining whether a violation of law has occurred, it is a protected
record of investigation under section 7923.600(a).  However, that exemption is overcome by
section 20012, which clearly requires its production to Petitioner as a person
injured, and to any attorney who declares under penalty of perjury that he
represents Petitioner.  As required by
section 20012, the entire unredacted Traffic Crash Report must be produced to
Petitioner.
 
d. Waiver of Exemption for the Traffic
Crash Report
Petitioner notes
that the police reports include a copy of the Traffic Crash Report for the
Incident.  LAPD was informed Petitioner
had an unredacted copy of the Traffic Crash Report after the LAPD disclosed the
redacted police reports in its June 10 production.  LAPD continued to maintain its objections
were valid and asserted that its unredacted Traffic Crash Report differs from
the version produced.  Gleizer Decl., ¶
36.  Assuming the two copies of the Traffic
Crash Report are the same, Petitioner contends that the prior disclosure of the
report constitutes a waiver of LAPD’s exemption.  §7921.505.  Pet. Op. Br. at 8.
The City replies
that, prior to submitting the CPRA Request, Petitioner apparently obtained an
unredacted copy of a Traffic Crash Report from an LAPD employee in December
2022.  Bennett Decl., ¶5.  As Petitioner acknowledges, the record he
obtained was different than the redacted record produced by LAPD because they
are documents of different length.  Any
waiver of the report disclosed in December 2022 should be narrowly construed
and not deemed as a waiver the other record.  §7921.505(b).  Opp. at 13.
This issue is mooted by the fact that
Petitioner is entitled to the unredacted Traffic Crash Report.  As the City must produce this unredacted
report, Petitioner’s request for an in-camera review is denied.  See Pet. Op. Br. at 10; Reply at 4.
 
2. The Redactions
When an agency refuses to disclose a public
record, it must justify its decision by demonstrating that the record is exempt
under specific provisions of the CPRA or that withholding the record serves a
greater public interest than disclosure.  Copley, supra, 39 Cal.4th at
1282.  The agency’s justification “must
be specific enough to give the requester a meaningful opportunity to contest
the withholding of the documents and the court to determine whether the
exemption applies.”  Golden Door,
supra, 53 Cal.App.5th at p. 790.) 
Reply at 6.
Petitioner argues that many of LAPD’s
redactions are simply based on LAPD’s internal policies.  During his PMQ deposition, Orocio indicated
that LAPD would continue to follow its internal policies even if a record was
not exempt or lost exemption process.  Gordon
Decl., Ex. G (Orocio Depo), pp. 93, 159.  LAPD’s internal policies do not trump the CPRA
and do not justify the LAPD’s record redactions. Reply at 6.  The court agrees.
 
a. Redactions
to the Police Reports
Petitioner argues
that LAPD’s redactions to the police reports are improper under the CPRA.  LAPD asserts that the withheld portions of
the police reports were exempt from disclosure pursuant to sections 7922.000
(catch-all), 7923.600 (records of investigation/investigatory files), 7927.700
(personal privacy in medical/personnel and other files), and 7927.705 (exempt
by federal or state privilege).  Pet. Op.
Br. at 8.
With regard to the
catch-all exemption, at no point did LAPD describe, explain, or justify the grounds
for its exemptions, despite Petitioner explicitly requesting additional
context.  LAPD simply referenced the
CPRA’s catch-all provision.  §7922.000.   Conclusory
or boilerplate assertions that merely recite the statutory standards are not
sufficient.” Golden Door, supra. 53 Cal.App.5th
733, 790.  LAPD fails to meet its burden justifying application of the catch-all
exemption to the police reports.  Pet.
Op. Br. at 8.
LAPD also asserts
the redacted portions of the police report are exempt under the investigatory
exemption and personal privacy exemption.  §§ 7923.600, 7927.700.  Although portions of the police reports may
be deemed investigatory – the court has found that they are -- the investigatory exemption does not provide
a blanket exclusion for entire documents. 
Instead, it is designed to protect specific aspects of investigatory
files that, if disclosed, would jeopardize effective law enforcement or
individual privacy.  §§ 7923.600-7923.630.   Pet. Op. Br. at 8-9.
The unredacted
Traffic Crash Report provides evidence that the redactions applied by the LAPD
are improper.  Bennett Decl., Ex. C.  Under section 7923.605, law enforcement
agencies are obligated to disclose to a victim of an incident or their
authorized representative “the names and addresses of persons involved in, or
witnesses . . . all diagrams, statements of the parties involved in the
incident, the statements of all witnesses, other than confidential informants.”  Similarly, section 7923.610 obligates law
enforcement agencies to make specific information regarding an arrestee public,
including their name, physical description, facts surrounding their arrest, and
the charges brought against them.  Pet.
Op. Br. at 9.
The redacted police
reports produced by LAPD redact information that is subject to disclosure under
both sections 7923.605 and 7923.610. 
This includes Weems physical description (Geizler Decl., ¶¶ 29-30, Ex.
Y, p. 105, but see p. 82 (physical description left unredacted), the
SUV’s VIN and registered owner (Ex. Y, p. 106), the collision summary (Ex. Y, p.
116), witness statements (Ex. Y, p. 116), and facts surrounding Weems’ arrest
and charges brought against him (Ex. Y, pp. 81, 116-18, 121).   Pet. Op. Br. at 9.
With regard to
LAPD’s claim that the records are exempt under the privacy exemption, courts
have held that the exemption applies only to “sensitive personal information
which individuals must submit to government.”  Register Div. of Freedom Newspapers, Inc.
v. County of Orange, (1984) 158 Cal. App. 3d 893, 902.   The police reports contain information
concerning persons involved in the Incident either as a victim, witness,
involved party/arrestee, or police officer. 
The personal nature of the information provided is limited.  Moreover, witnesses had the option to remain
anonymous as demonstrated by witness “W3” in the unredacted Traffic Crash
Report.  Bennett Decl., Ex. C, p. 12.  The public has a substantial interest in the
Incident that far exceeds privacy concerns in light of the serious nature of
the offense and injuries and the fact that it took place at a community
Carnival open to the public.  Pet. Op.
Br. at 9.
Petitioner misunderstands section 7923.600(a), which exempts
records of investigation from disclosure on their face.  Haynie, supra¸ 26 Cal.4th at 1068-69 (citing Uribe, supra, 19 Cal.App.3d at 213 and Williams, supra, 5 Cal.4th at
356).  The three criminal investigation
police reports are exempt under section 7923.600(a) and LAPD need not provide
those reports at all.  LAPD does have an obligation
to provide information to Petitioner pursuant to sections 7923.605,
7923.610, 7923.615 and it has chosen to do so by disclosing a one-page sheet
containing the information required by section 7923.610 concerning the arrestee
(Ex. B, p. 66) and by providing the information required by section 7923.605
and 7923.615 through the redacted police reports.  Opp. at 12. 
LAPD need not provide the same information more than once.  So long as the information required by sections
7923.605, 7923.610, 7923.615 is provided somewhere, that is all that is
required.
Therefore, the
issue is not whether the redactions are appropriate – LAPD could have withheld the
criminal police reports in their entirety – but rather whether the redacted
reports provide the information required by sections 7923.605 and
7923.615.  Petitioner argues that LAPD’s
disclosure improperly redacted the suspect’s (Weems) physical description,
collision summary (Ex. Y, p. 116), witness statements (Ex. Y, p. 116), and
facts surrounding Weems’ arrest and charges brought against him (Ex. Y, pp. 81,
116-18, 121), which are required by sections 7923.605, 7923.610, and
7923.615.  Pet. Op. Br. at 9.
The City responds
that all this information was disclosed by the Department.  The one-page sheet contains a physical
description of the arrestee as required under section 7923.610.  Orocio Decl., ¶32.  The redacted police reports include witness
statements and facts surrounding the arrest as specified under sections 7923.605, 7923.610, and
7923.615.  LAPD did not redact
witness statements.  Rather, the analysis
and conclusions of the investigating officer, which are not disclosable, were
redacted from the “COLLISION SUMMARY” and the “UPON ARRIVAL (AT SCENE
INVESTIGATIONS)” sections of the Traffic Crash Report. §7923.605(b) (expressly
exempting the disclosure of the “analysis or conclusions of the investigating
officer”).   Opp. at 14.
Petitioner replies
that the City’s argument that LAPD generally disclosed this information is
unsupported by citation to the evidence. 
LAPD’s redaction of information subject to disclosure violates its
duties and obligations under the CPRA.  See
§7922.525.  Reply at 6-7.
The court does not
agree.  Petitioner has a burden which has
not been met.  His burden was not to
point out what information was redacted but rather what information is missing
that is required by sections 7923.605, 7923.610, and 7923.615. Particularly
since the unredacted Traffic Crash Report must be produced, Petitioner has not
shown that any required disclosure is missing.[12]
No further review
of the redacted police reports is required (although, as stated, the unredacted
Traffic Crash Report and Impound Report must be produced for other reasons).
 
b. Signatures and Initials 
LAPD’s record
production includes redacted signature blocks on several records.  LAPD asserted that “signatures and initials signatures
and initials are redacted as a precaution against forgery and because…[sections]
7927.700 and 7922.000 exempt records the disclosure of which would constitute
an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy and/or would not serve the public
interest.”  Pet. Op. Br. at 10.
LAPD redacted LAFD’s
signed approval of the Police Museum’s plot plan.  Ex. Y, pp. 10, 77 [duplicate copy).  LAPD also redacted multiple signatures on the
police reports.  Ex. Y, pp. 81, 82, 88,
90, 120.  As an initial matter, CID
previously produced an unredacted copy of the signed plot plan which waives
LAPD’s asserted privileges.  Compare Geizler
Decl., ¶23, Ex. U (CID production) and Ex. Y, pp. 10, 77 (LAPD June 10 production).[13]  Pet.
Op. Br. at 11.
Notwithstanding this
waiver, the signatures do not constitute “personnel, or similar files.”
§7927.700.  The redacted records do not
concern the signatories job performance or any grievance; they are ordinary
business records concerning the affairs of the City.  Associated Chino Teachers v. Chino Valley
Unified School Dist., (2018) 30 Cal.App.5th 530, 539; Labor
Code §1198.5.  Pet. Op. Br. at 11.
Even if the
records constitute personnel files, LAPD does not explain how disclosure of a
public agency employee’s signature on an official government form constitutes
an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. 
Nor does it address the public interest in nondisclosure.  The only support offered by LAPD is its
assertion that signatures are exempt as a precaution against forgery.  Geizler Decl., ¶33.  LAPD’s forgery argument is sheer speculation,
and LAPD provides nothing to substantiate its forgery concern.  See CBS Broadcasting Inc. v.
Superior Court, (2001) 91 Cal. App. 4th 892, 908 (burden of proof is on the
proponent of nondisclosure).  This
speculative concern is greatly outweighed by the strong public interest in the
conduct of law enforcement and other public employees engaged in government
business.  New York Times Co. v.
Superior Court, (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 97, 104-05.  The signatures appear on official government
forms and confirm that the necessary government approval was approval from a
public employee with proper authority was obtained. See Long Beach
Police Officers Assn. v. City of Long Beach, (2014) 59 Cal.4th
59, 71-72 (officer’s name is part of factual information that must be disclosed).
 Pet. Op. Br. at 11.
The City responds
that LAPD applies such redactions as a precaution against forgery.  §§ 7927.700 (unwarranted
invasion of personal privacy), 7922.000 (public interest in not disclosing
outweighs the public interest in disclosing).) 
Petitioner offers no argument or case law to support the disclosure of
signatures or initials, as opposed to the names of employees, which the
Department did not redact.  Opp. at 14.
As Petitioner argues (Reply at 7), LAPD
redacted signatures based on Department policy, not evidence.  The City makes no attempt to substantiate LAPD’s
forgery claim and its concern is speculative. 
LAPD carries the burden to justify its redactions and has failed to do
so.  See California State
University v. Superior Court, (2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 810, 887 (“The
unsupported statements constitute nothing more than speculative, self-serving
opinions designed to preclude the dissemination of information”).  Reply at 7. 
The signatures must be produced.
 
c. Redactions
to Email Addresses and Phone Numbers of LAPD Employees and Third Parties

LAPD redacted the
email and telephone number of a third-party Carnival contractor, Ron Waldman,
who was involved in planning the Carnival, the phone number of Police Museum
employees communicating with LAPD, and the work phone number of LAPD
employees.  LAPD asserted this
information was exempt from disclosure pursuant to sections 7927.700 and
7922.000.  Pet. Op. Br. at 11-12.
Petitioner argues
that LAPD did not provide justification for withholding this contact
information under the catch-all exemption in section 7922.000.  See Michaelis, Montanari & Johnson v. Superior Court, (2006) 38 Cal. 4th 1065, 1071 (“burden on
proponent of nondisclosure to prove a clear overbalance”).  The phone numbers and email addresses
are used for business purposes and are listed on forms submitted to the City.  Gleizer Decl., Ex Y, pp. 1-7, 11 (emails), 68
(Carnival event details in City’s special events portal).  See San Gabriel Tribune v. Superior
Court, (1983) 143 Cal.App.3d 762,
775, 780-81 (information about those who voluntarily contract with the
government is disclosable under the CPRA).  Pet. Op. Br. at 12.
For the contact information of Waldman
and the Police Museum employees, there is a strong public interest in third
parties engaging in business with or on behalf of the City.  Contact information can also provide useful
information for purposes of searching and identifying relevant documents.  For
the telephone numbers of LAPD employees, the phone numbers appear in the
employee’s LAPD email signature line, which also includes the department and
unit the employee works in.   Ex Y, pp. 73-76.  The phone number is being used for business
purposes and is thereby subject to disclosure. See §7928.300 (employee personal
phone numbers are not public records and generally not subject to disclosure).  Pet. Op. Br. at 12.
The City argues
that these individuals’ identities are disclosed in the records and there is no
further public interest in knowing their contact information.  Thus, the information is exempt under sections 7927.700 and 7922.000.  In the analogous FOIA context, courts have
held that such information is exempt from disclosure as an “unwarranted
invasion of personal privacy.”  See Gov.
Accountability Proj. v. U.S.
Dep’t of State,
(2010) 699 F.Supp.2d 97, 106; see also Bader Fam. Found. v. U.S.
Dep’t of Ed., (2022) 630 F.Supp.3d 36, 46.  Opp. at 14.
Petitioner correctly responds that LAPD failed
to substantiate any public interest or personal privacy concerns in the
redacted business emails and phone numbers of third parties responsible for
planning and organizing the Carnival.  See
California State University v. Superior Court, (2001) 90
Cal.App.4th 810, 834 (individuals who bought suites in public facility entered
into public sphere and “[b]y doing so, they voluntarily diminished their own
privacy interests”).    Reply at 7-8.
The business contact information of third
parties must be disclosed but not the business phone numbers of LAPD
employees.  
d. Redactions to VIN and Registered Owner
Information
Petitioner
contends that the redacted police reports produced by LAPD redact the SUV’s VIN
and registered owner (Ex. Y, p. 106), information that is subject to disclosure
under both sections 7923.605 and 7923.610.  Pet. Op. Br. at 9.
The City merely responds
that such redactions are proper because that information is not
disclosable.  See generally §§ 7923.605, 7923.610, and
7923.615.  Opp. at 13-14.
As Petitioner
replies (Reply at 6), this argument fails to satisfy LAPD’s burden, and this
information must be disclosed. 
3. Reasonableness of the Search
To determine if a
search was adequate under the CPRA, California courts apply the standard used
in FOIA cases, which provides that a search "need only be reasonably
calculated to locate responsive documents" given the circumstances.  ACLU v. Superior Court, (2011) 202
Cal.App.4th 55, 85 (citing Meerepol v. Meese, (“Meerepol”) (D.C.
Cir. 1986) 790 F.2d 942, 951-56. 
"[T]he issue to be resolved is not whether there might exist any
other documents possibly responsive to the request, but rather whether the search
for those documents was adequate" in light of the relevant
circumstances.  Meerepol, supra, 790 F.2d at 951.  An agency's search must be "reasonably
calculated to locate responsive documents." Community Youth Athletic
Center v. City of National City, ("CYAC"), (2013) 220
Cal.App.4th 1385, 1420 (citation omitted). 

The scope of the
search is dictated by the scope of the request. 
Id.  "An agency is...
obliged to search for records based on criteria set forth in the search
request." California First Amendment Coalition v. Superior Court,
("CFAC"), (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 159, 166.  Based on the language of the request, an
agency must "determine whether it has such writings under its control and
the applicability of any exemption." Id. at 166. The agency's
search "should be broad enough to account for the problem that the
requester may not know what documents or information of interest an agency
possesses."  CYAC, supra, 220 Cal.App.4th at 1425 (citation
omitted).  
An agency need only
search files reasonably likely to contain responsive records.  Jenkins v. United States, (D.D.C. July
12, 2017) 2017 U.S.Dist.LEXIS 107363 at *7. 
It "is not required to expend its limited resources on searches for
which it is clear at the outset that no search will produce the records sought."  Reyes v. EPA, (“Reyes”) (D.D.C.
2014) 991 F.Supp.2d 20, 27; Earle v. United States, (“Earle”)
(D.D.C. 2016) 217 F.Supp.3d 117, 123. 
Moreover, if an agency shows it never had or no longer possesses the
records requested, "the reasonable search required... may be no search at
all."  Reyes, supra, 991 F.Supp.2d at 27; Earle,
supra, 217 F.Supp.3d at 124 (search
would be futile where agency declaration showed records in question did not
exist); Amnesty Int'l v. CIA, (S.D.N.Y. June 19, 2008) 2008
U.S.Dist.LEXIS 47822 at *34 (agency not required to search at all where it
would be futile). 
A clearly framed
request which requires an agency to search an enormous volume of data for a
‘needle in a haystack” or a request which compels the production of a large
volume of material may be objectionable as unduly burdensome.  CFAC, supra, 67 Cal.App.4th at 166.  However, records requests impose some burden
on agencies, and the agency is required to comply so long as the record can be
recovered with reasonable effort.  Id.  
An agency can show
its search was adequate with affidavits showing where and how it searched for
the records.  Citizens Comm. on Human
Rights v. FDA, ((9th Cir. 1995) 45 F.3d 1325, 1328.  In evaluating the agency's evidence on this
issue, courts should consider "such relevant factors as the amount of time
and staff devoted to the request and whether the agency attempted to limit its
search to one or more places when other sources likely would have contained
[the] information requested." Landmark Legal Foundation v. E.P.A.,
(D.D.C. 2003) 272 F.Supp.2d 59, 62. 
Even significant
expense to the agency will not excuse an agency from conducting a thorough
search for responsive records unless it constitutes an undue burden.  See, e.g., CBS Broadcasting Inc. v.
Superior Ct., (2001) 91 Cal. App. 4th 892, 909 ($43,000 cost to agency to
compile responsive public records was not valid reason to deny CPRA
request).  “Reasonable efforts do not
require that agencies undertake extraordinarily extensive or intrusive
searches, however.  In general, the scope
of an agency’s search for public records ‘need only be reasonably calculated to
locate responsive documents.’” City of San Jose v. Superior Court,
(2017) 2 Cal.5th 608, 627 (citation omitted). The “CPRA does not prescribe
specific methods of searching for those documents and agencies may develop
their own internal policies for conducting searches.  Some general principles have emerged,
however. Once an agency receives a CPRA request, it must “‘communicate the
scope of the information requested to the custodians of its records,’ although
it need not use the precise language of the request...” Ibid. (citation
omitted).
 
a. Delay
Petitioner
argues that LAPD failed to conduct an adequate search for records responsive to
the CPRA Request, resulting in a delayed and grossly deficient production of records.
 Section 7922.600 mandates that a public
agency assist the requestor to overcome “any practical basis for denying access
to the records or information sought.”  A
public agency satisfies this duty by making a reasonable effort to
elicit additional clarifying information from the requester that will help
identify the record or records.”  Id.  LAPD has impeded and refused to make any real
effort to work with Petitioner for purposes of identifying records responsive
to the CPRA Request.  LAPD’s conduct
should be deemed by the court as an outright denial of Petitioner’s
Request.  See CYAC, supra,
 220 Cal.App.4th at 1425 (“the
effect of the [agency’s] inability or unwillingness to locate the records had
the same effect as withholding requested information from the public”).   Pet. Op. Br. at 14.
As the City correctly
argues (Opp. at 19, n.3), this allegation is baseless.  Petitioner made the Request in February
2023.  LAPD assigned a CPRA analyst and
asked ITB to look for emails using the word “Carnival”.  The Discovery Section also determined that
CID had already produced Items 1—5 and 7 to Petitioner.  LAPD responded to the Request on March 20,
2023, noting that Items 10-13 had to be narrowed because there were more than
15,000 email hits.  On April 5, 2023, the
Discovery Section contacted Petitioner to inform him that witness statements
would be provided upon receipt of a signed authorization.  Petitioner failed to respond until he
submitted a new Request almost six months later, on September 27, 2023.
By November 9,
2023, Petitioner asked that the initial Request be re-opened as required, provided
the required authorization, and addressed the Discovery Section’s request to
narrow Items 11-13 by narrowing Item 13 only. 
He sent a follow-up email and peremptorily filed the Petition on
December 28, 2023.  Thereafter, the
parties met and conferred several times, sometimes at the court’s prompting,
resulting in the April 25 and June 10 productions.  These facts show that the City attempted to
work with Petitioner and endeavored to search for records within the parameters
it deemed feasible.  Petitioner bears
almost all the fault for delay.
This leads to the
scope of LAPD’s search, which must be "reasonably calculated to locate
responsive documents."  CYAC,
supra, 220 Cal.App.4th at 1420.  
 
b. Search Terms
As a threshold
matter, Petitioner challenges the adequacy of LAPD’s search because he believes
that “[c]ommon sense dictates that LAPD’s involvement would coincide with a
substantial paper trail.”  He also
speculates that LAPD has “intimate” ties to the Carnival, but it was a private
event.  LAPD did not plan the Carnival,
employ workers for the event, or provide event security.  Orocio Decl., ¶13.
Petitioner
contends that LAPD’s search parameters were overly narrow and the LAPD
repeatedly rejected Petitioner’s request to expand the search terms and date
ranges.  LAPD agreed to expand its search
to include the terms proposed in Petitioner’s March 27, 2023 email.  However, the register of actions reveals that
LAPD failed to include all key terms proposed by Petitioner.  Glazier Decl., ¶¶ 25-27, Exs. V-W.  Pet. Op. Br. at 13-14.
The City responds
that Petitioner proposed that LAPD search terms including, among other things,
“vehicle,” “safety,” “security,” and “arrest”, that are facially unreasonable
and overbroad.  Orocio Decl., ¶45.  LAPD’s search parameters -- set forth in
detail in Orocio’s declaration (Orocio Decl. ¶¶ 46–56), were reasonably
calculated to locate responsive documents. 
Opp. at 15.
One key difference
between LAPD’s search parameters versus those proposed by Petitioner is that
most of LAPD’s email searches included a limiter for the term “Police Museum”
or “Carnival.”  Zhang Decl., ¶16.  Thus, for example, an email that included the
keyword “vehicle” would also need to include “Police Museum” or “Carnival”
somewhere in the email chain to be included in the search results.  Id.  Running Petitioner’s proposed terms would
have dramatically broadened the scope of the Request.  They also were not targeted to the Request,
which concerned a single Incident at a Carnival organized by the Police
Museum.  Opp. at 15.
Petitioner replies that the City’s argument
is disingenuous.  In response to meet-and-confer
efforts ordered by the court, Petitioner proposed (1) terms to search
independently and (2) terms to run in pairs. 
Gleizer Decl., ¶16, Ex. N.  The
terms Petitioner proposed to run independently were: “Weems, “LA Police
Museum”, “Bennett”, “Bey”, “Street Carnival”, “November 12 Carnival”, “November
12 Incident/accident”, “Fall Carnival” “LAPD Carnival”, “Street Festival”, and
“Porsche Cayenne.” The independent terms were specifically tailored to the Incident.
 Petitioner proposed limiting the date
range for its search of the terms “Weems,” “Bennett,” “Bey,” and “November 12
Incident/accident” to November 11, 2022 to November 2, 2023, and the remaining
terms to November 11, 2021 to November 2, 2023. 
Gleizer Decl., Ex. N.  LAPD cannot
support its argument that the proposed terms were facially unreasonable and
overbroad. Reply at 8.
The search terms
used by LAPD were reasonable.  The issue is
not whether there might exist any other documents possibly responsive to the
request, but rather whether the search for those documents was adequate"
in light of the relevant circumstances.  Meerepol,
supra, 790 F.2d at 951.  It was.
c. Date Ranges
Petitioner alleges
that LAPD limited the date range of almost all of its searches to November 11,
2022 to November 2, 2023, which stifles the ability to identify and produce
planning and permitting records.  Despite
Petitioner’s request to expand the date range, LAPD continued to use its
limited date range and applied an alternative date range of October 1 to
November 11, 2022, to only two searches. 
Glazier Decl., ¶¶ 25-27, Exs. V-W. 
Pet. Op. Br. at 13-14.
The City argues
that the date ranges used by the LAPD’s email searches were reasonable.  Four of the email searches used a date range
of November 11, 2022 to November 2, 2023, in order to target email records from
just before the date of the Incident until approximately one year later.  Orocio Decl., ¶¶ 47–52.  The other email searches used a date range of
October 1 to November 12, 2022, and were targeted to email communications
between LAPD and the Police Museum regarding the Carnival.  Orocio Decl., ¶54.  LAPD believes the date ranges used were
reasonable and adequate to locate email communications related to the Incident
and the Carnival, respectively.  (Id. ¶¶
52, 54.)  Opp. at 16.
The Incident occurred on November 12, 2022.
The court agrees with Petitioner that limiting the earliest range to October 1,
2022 stifled the ability to identify and produce planning and permitting
records.  LAPD refused to expand
its search for a date range beginning November 11, 2021, which Petitioner
proposed, and did not explain why the expanded date range would be overly
burdensome.  Reply at 8.  The search must be expanded to include
planning and permitting documents by using a range starting on November 11,
2021.
 
d. The Custodians
Petitioner raised
concerns regarding LAPD’s custodian list, which the LAPD confirmed was limited
to officers involved in the Incident.  Glazier
Decl., ¶¶ 24-27.  Petitioner requested
that the LAPD expand its search beyond custodians involved in investigating the
Incident to include custodians involved in the planning and security for the
Carnival.  LAPD agreed, but the register
of actions reveals that LAPD failed to expand the list and made no effort to
identify additional custodians.  Glazier
Decl., Ex. AC.  Pet. Op. Br. at 13.
The City responds
that LAPD’s search for email and non-email records included 19 officers who
communicated with the Police Museum or were involved in the investigation of
the Incident.  Petitioner’s assertion
that LAPD failed to include custodians involved in planning and security for
the Incident” is untrue.  LAPD produced
email records that hit on the terms “Carnival” or “security” or “Police Museum”
that were sent to or from a Police Museum contact for the Carnival.  Orocio Decl., ¶46.  Opp. at 16.
Petitioner bases
his assertions about planning and security custodians on attorney
correspondence that occurred before LAPD finished its search for records.  See Gleizer Decl., Ex. V.  Following this meet-and-confer, LAPD agreed
to add two custodians to its search parameters. 
Zhang Decl., ¶¶ 15-16.  It is
unclear which custodians Petitioner is claiming should have been included in
LAPD’s search, because LAPD did not deny any request to include
custodians.  Zhang Decl., ¶16.  Opp. at 16-17.
Petitioner does not
reply to this argument.  LAPD reasonably
identified and used 19 custodians for the search.
e. Search for
More Than Emails
Petitioner argues that LAPD’s search for records was almost
exclusively limited to emails, both before and after the Petition was filed.  See Gleizer Decl., Ex. AC (register of
actions).  The only attempt by LAPD to
obtain non-email records took place on March 6, 2024, when the CPRA analyst
requested witness statements, staff list, and obtained a permit for the
Carnival. There is no evidence that any other efforts to search for additional
non-email records was undertaken. 
Despite Petitioner’s request for cell phone records, records were not
requested from custodians.  See City of San
Jose, supra, 2 Cal. 5th at 627-28.  Pet. Op. Br. at 13.
Petitioner repeatedly raised concerns regarding LAPD’s failure
to search for non-email records.  Glazier
Decl., ¶¶ 25-27, Exs. V-W.   LAPD’s
counsel advised that it would look into the issue but never followed up with
Petitioner.  Id.   There is no evidence that LAPD expanded its
search following Petitioner’s request.  The
PMQ confirmed in his June 24, 2024 deposition that LAPD ran email searches but represented
that he was not aware of searches for any other record types.  Gordon Decl., Ex. G, pp. 71, 101-102, 115-17.
The City responds that it is untrue that LAPD’s search was
limited almost exclusively to emails. 
The Discovery Section searched for, reviewed, and made redactions to
non-email investigatory records and files that could contain information
subject to disclosure to a crime victim or his authorized representative
pursuant to section 7923.605.  Orocio Decl., ¶57.  The Discovery Section also asked the relevant
custodians whether they had sent or received any text messages related to the
Incident on their personal cell phone, or any Department-issued cell phone, and
whether they had any handwritten notes or drawings concerning the
Incident.  Orocio Decl., ¶58.  None reported having texts, handwritten
notes, or drawings concerning the Incident. 
Id.  Opp. at 16.[14]
Petitioner correctly replies (Reply at 9) that
LAPD has materially changed its position regarding its search for non-email records.  Orocio testified that he did not know if LAPD
searched for text messages, photographs, videos, personal cell phones,
etc.  Gordon Decl., Ex. G (Orocio
Depo), pp. 70 (texts and handwritten notes), 90–91
(texts or cell phones), 115–16 (handwritten notes, photographs, videos, faxes,
personal cell phones).  The City is bound
by this testimony.  See Ex.
G, pp. 100–01.  
Yet, Orocio now declares that LAPD searched
for non-email records, including personal and Department-issued cell
phones, for texts, handwritten notes, and drawings concerning the
Incident.  Orocio Decl., ¶58.  No explanation has been made how Ocorico learned
this information between June 24 and his declaration.  Orocio’s contradictory declaration is
disregarded on this point.  
LAPD must search
the custodians’ personal and Department-issued cell phones for texts,
handwritten notes, and drawings concerning the Incident.
 
f.
Records Uploaded to Evidence.com
The unredacted Traffic Crash
Report reveals that an officer “used a city cell phone to take and upload
photos to evidnce.com [sic.]”, and that the interviews of Weems and two
witnesses were captured on body cam video.  Bennet Decl., Ex. C, p. 13.  During the parties’ meet-and-confer, LAPD
confirmed that it had not requested or obtained copies of these records, asserting
they were privileged.  Gleizer Decl., ¶35,
Ex. AB.)  Pet. Op. Br. at 14.
Petitioner argues that LAPD’s
blanket privilege claim is improper.  It
is improper to assert objections to requests
for production of documents that do not exist or are not in their possession,
custody, or control.  See Bihun v. AT&T Information
Systems, Inc., (1993) 13 Cal.App.4th 976, 991.  The Traffic Crash Report does not identify the content of the uploaded
photographs, and LAPD has provided no factual basis to confirm they solely
concern the investigation of the Incident.  Castanares, supra, 98
Cal.App.5th at 309 (rejecting blanket privilege for drone footage in favor of content-based
analysis).  LAPD’s wrongly failed to
obtain and evaluate the photographs and video footage.  Further, to the extent the body cam footage
is limited to statements by Weems and the witnesses, such footage constitutes
party and witness statements subject to disclosure under section
7923.605.  The court should order the
LAPD to obtain the records and assess them for purposes of disclosure under the
CPRA.  Pet. Op. Br. at 14.
The City responds
that Petitioner’s argument is frivolous. 
Any photograph or video recording made by an officer at a crime scene is,
by definition, a record of a criminal investigation which is exempt from
disclosure under section
7923.600.  Orocio Decl., ¶61.  Because the disclosure of such evidence could
jeopardize an ongoing criminal investigation or prosecution, or threaten the
safety of a party or witness, it is categorically exempt from disclosure under
the investigatory records exemption.  As
a result, the Discovery Section does not disclose evidence from evidence.com in
response to CPRA requests.  Orocio Decl.,
¶61.  Opp. at 17.
The City argues
that Castanares, relied on by Petitioner, supports the Department’s
position.  That case held that drone video
footage from calls for service that resulted in a law enforcement investigation
(i.e., a case number was assigned) was exempt from public disclosure
under section 7923.600(a)).  98 Cal.App.5th at 305.  The court need not review investigatory
records that are exempt on their face.  Id.  The City adds that LAPD already provided
witness statements, which were left unredacted from the records provided.  Opp. at 17.
            Petitioner replies that the City cannot
claim that records LAPD did not review are exempt from disclosure under the
CPRA.  This would create a blanket
privilege for any record uploaded by LAPD.  Courts have explicitly rejected the notion
that a record’s location, rather than its content, determines its
confidentiality.  Becerra v. Superior
Court, (2020) 44 Cal.App.5th 897, 923.) 
Moreover, the LAPD failed to address Petitioner’s argument that the body
worn camera footage of Weems and witnesses constitute witness statements
subject to disclosure under section 7923.605. 
Reply at 9.
            Petitioner misses the point on his
first argument.  It is not just the fact
that a record was uploaded to evidnce.com that
creates an exemption.  It is the fact
that the records are crime scene photos and video that makes them exempt.  LAPD need not search such records uploaded
to evidnce.com before deeming them to be exempt.
On his second
argument, Petitioner is wrong that the City fails to address the witness
statement issue.  The City’s opposition expressly
states that LAPD provided unredacted witness statements.  Opp. at 17. 
Nonetheless, section 7923.605 states that a victim shall be provided
“all diagrams, statements of the parties involved in the incident, the
statements of all witnesses”.  This
language appears to state that all witness statements must be provided.  At a minimum, it requires that all statements
of the parties must be provided, including Weems.
The City must provide the interviews of Weems and two witnesses that were
captured on body cam video and uploaded to evidence.com.
 
g.
Records Responsive to Items 1-5 and 7-9  
The City argues that Petitioner’s assertion
that this litigation prompted LAPD to turn over “records responsive to Items
1-4, and 8” is inaccurate.  See Pet.
Op. Br. at 15.  LAPD does not have in its
possession records responsive to Items 1-4, and 8 and never produced such
records.  Orocio Decl. ¶¶ 12–17,
37–39.  The only documents responsive to
Items 1–5 and 7 were provided to Petitioner by CID in February 2023.  Orocio Decl., ¶17.  Opp. at 17.
Petitioner responds that LAPD cannot make
this argument because it did not search for records responsive to Items 1–5 and
never obtained copies of the CID’s records prior to receiving them from
Petitioner.  Gordon Decl., Ex. G (Orocio
Depo), pp. 167–68; CYAC, supra, 220 Cal.App.4th at 1425 (“[agency’s]
inability or unwillingness to locate the records had the same effect as
withholding requested information from the public”).  Reply at 8-9.
On March 20, 2023, LAPD advised Petitioner that records
responsive to Items 1-5, & 7 were previously produced by CID in response to
a separate request.  Gleizer Decl., ¶3, Ex.
C.  On March 27, 2024, LAPD’s counsel confirmed
that it did not possess records responsive to Items 1-5 and 7 beyond the
records previously produced by CID.  Gleizer
Decl., ¶14, Ex. N.  On April 25, 2024,
LAPD made its first production of documents in response to Petitioner’s February
23 Request.  Gleizer Decl., ¶22, Ex. T.  LAPD advised that records responsive to Items
1 through 5 and 7 already had been produced by CID.  Gleizer Decl., ¶23; see Ex. U.
It appears that LAPD never separately searched for these records
and relied solely on CID’s production. 
Petitioner is entitled to a separate search.
 
4. Attorney
Fees
The City argues
that the court should decline to opine on the prevailing party issue because it
is premature.  Opp. at 18.  The court disagrees.  The appellate court has indicated that
entitlement to attorney fees should be decided before judgment where
feasible.  In any event, there is no
judgment in a CPRA case and it is appropriate for the court to determine the
entitlement issue.
A petitioner who prevails in a
CPRA case is entitled to court costs and attorney fees. §7923.115(a).   An award is mandatory if the plaintiff
prevails.  Filarsky v. Superior Court,
(2002) 28 Cal.4th 419, 427.  A
plaintiff prevails in litigation under the CPRA if the litigation motivated the
defendant to release the requested documents or was the catalyst for the
release. Motorola Commun. & Electronics v. Dep’t of General Servs., (1997)
55 Cal.App.4th 1340, 1344.
It is not enough
that the defendant in a CPRA proceeding disclosed records after the action was
filed.  Valenti v. City of San Diego,
(“Valenti”) (2023) 94 Cal.App.5th 218, 228 (denying fees where
agency tried to work with requester to focus the request, and requester refused
to assist and instead filed a petition); Sukumar v. City of San Diego,
(2017) 14 Cal.App.5th 451, 464 (“[t]here must be more than a mere temporal
connection” between the filing of a petition and production of records”).  Courts have denied attorney’s fees in CPRA
actions where the agency never denied a voluminous request, tried to work with
the requester to narrow a request, and produced records after the petition was
filed.  See Crews v. Willows Unif. Sch. Dist.,
(2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 1368, 1382; Rogers v. Super. Ct., (1993)
19 Cal.App.4th 469, 482-83; Valenti, supra, 94
Cal.App.5th at 228, 232-33.  Opp. at
18-19.
Petitioner initially argues
that LAPD delayed production.  It failed
to provide a single responsive record until four months after the Petition was
filed.  PMQ Orocio testified that
CPRA analysts assign deadlines in their system which dictate tasks regarding a
request, including whether a response will be submitted.  Orocio confirmed that, following Petitioner’s
November 9, 2023, there was no deadline set in the system for the Requests email
until March 6, 2024.  Gordon Decl., Ex. G
(Orocio Depo.), pp. 130, 135-37. 
Orocio testified that there was no evidence of the LAPD conducting any
search for emails before the Petition was filed.  Ex. G, pp. 147-40, 142.  Orocio also confirms that LAPD used search
terms provided by Petitioner, leading to the identification and production of
records.  Orocio Decl., ¶¶ 57–59.  Reply at 10. 
Petitioner concludes that the Petition prompted LAPD to search
for and disclose records.  Pet. Op. Br.
at 15.
The City responds
that the Petition did not play a sufficient role in facilitating LAPD’s
production of documents.  Petitioner
created his own problem by serving an unreasonably broad CPRA Request and
refusing to limit that Request until long after the litigation commenced.  Despite Petitioner’s continued insistence on
overbroad search terms, the City made the eventual decision to limit the
Request by using its own reasonable search terms that resulted in LAPD’s
completion of the document production.  
Opp. at 18-19.
As discussed ante,
Petitioner’s delay argument is unsupported.  Any delay in production is mostly attributable
to Petitioner.  He also filed the
Petition peremptorily without exhausting further discussion.  The delay between his November 9, 2023 communication
of Petitioner’s authorization form and response to LAPD’s request to narrow Items
10-13, his December 7, 2023 status update request, and the filing of his December
28, 2023 Petition is immaterial.  LAPD
had demonstrated its willingness to produce documents and the failure to
continue the dialogue is Petitioner’s alone.
Petitioner next
argues that the Petition compelled LAPD to produce responsive records.  Pet. Op. Br. at 15.  
After the Petition
was filed, LAPD identified relevant custodians for the Request, promptly added
the two additional custodians that Petitioner requested, formulated and ran several
email searches, made redactions to exempt investigatory records while producing
responsive, non-exempt information.  See
generally Orocio Decl; Zhang Decl. ¶¶ 13, 16.  This effort was responsive and adequate.  Because of Petitioner’s delay and peremptory
filing of the Petition, the court will not award Petitioner any attorney fees
for the records produced during the meet-and-confer process after the Petition
was filed, including the release of records in the June 10, 2024
production.  LAPD was always willing to
search for and produce these records and Petitioner was not a catalyst for
their production.
However,
Petitioner is the prevailing party and entitled to his costs, as well as his attorney
fees solely for the instant briefing that resulted in compelling LAPD to produce
unredacted documents and conduct an additional search.  This includes production of the Impound Report
and the unredacted Traffic Crash Report, and the interviews of Weems and two witnesses captured on body cam
video and uploaded to evidence.com.  It also includes the removal of redactions on
the signature blocks, the business contact information of third
parties, and the SUV’s VIN and registered owner for produced records.  Finally, it includes an additional search for
records responsive to Items 1 through 5 and 7, expansion of the email
search to include planning and permitting documents by using a range starting
on November 11, 2021, and a search the custodians’ personal and
Department-issued cell phones for texts, handwritten notes, and drawings
concerning the Incident.
Petitioner is
entitled to attorney fees only for this briefing effort and the portion of any attorney
communications directing addressing these issues.  The parties are ordered to meet and confer to
reach agreement on the reasonable fees for this briefing effort.  If they fail to agree, Petitioner may file a
motion for that determination.
 
E. Conclusion
The Petition is granted
in part.  The City is ordered (a) to
produce the Vehicle Report for
an impounded vehicle and the unredacted Traffic Crash Report, and the interviews of Weems and two
witnesses that were captured on body cam video and uploaded to evidence.com, (b) remove the redactions on the signature blocks for
produced records, the business contact
information of third parties, and the SUV’s VIN and registered owner,
and (c) conduct an additional search for records responsive to Items 1 through
5 and 7, expand the email search to
include planning and permitting documents by using a range starting on November
11, 2021, and search the custodians’ personal and Department-issued cell
phones for texts, handwritten notes, and drawings concerning the Incident.  Petitioner is entitled to his costs and
attorney fees for his briefing and portion of any communications directing
addressing these issues.
