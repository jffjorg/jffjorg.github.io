The City notes that Petitioner untimely filed and served his brief on August
19, 2024 in violation of the court’s order that it be filed and served by
August 16, 2024.  Opp. at 10.  Petitioner fails to reply.  As the City suffered no prejudice, the court
has elected to consider Petitioner’s brief.

further statutory references are to the Government Code unless otherwise
stated.


            [3] The
Legislature confirmed that the 2023 changes in recodifying the CPRA were not
intended to substantively change the law relating to inspection of public
records.  §7920.100.


[4] Section
7922.000 is the CPRA’s catch-all provision and “contemplates a case-by-case
balancing process, with the burden of proof on the proponent of nondisclosure
to demonstrate a clear overbalance on the side of confidentiality.”  Michaelis
v. Superior Court, (2006) 38 Cal.4th 1066, 1071.  The court must
balance the public interest in disclosure against the privacy interests,
evaluating the weight of the public interest by the gravity of the public tasks
sought to be illuminated and the directness with which the disclosure will
illuminate those tasks.  See Humane Society of the United States
v. Superior Court, (2013) 214 Cal.App.4th 12133, 1267-68.   


[5] Section 7923.600(a) does not involve a public interest
balancing test.  The courts have
consistently refused to apply additional criteria to CPRA exemptions that are
not explicitly provided in the statute.  See Williams, supra, (1993) 5 Cal.4th 337, 354 (“The
Legislature has carefully limited the exemption for law enforcement
investigatory records … It is not our task to rewrite the statute.”).  


[6] Except as otherwise required by Penal
Code section 1054 et seq. or the U.S. or California Constitution, no law
enforcement officer or employee of a law enforcement agency shall disclose to
any arrested person, or to any person who may be a defendant in a criminal
action, the address or telephone number of any person who is a victim or
witness in the alleged offense.  Penal
Code §841.5(a).


[7] The
City asks the court to judicially notice (1) CID’s webpage (Resp. RJN Ex. A)
and (2) a September 8, 2024 Department 82 order denying attorney fees in Three
Group, Inc. v. City of Los Angeles, 23STCP0988 (Resp. RJN Ex. B).  Petitioner objects to judicial notice of
Exhibit B, which cannot be cited under CRC 8.1115.  Exhibit A is judicially noticed.   Evid. Code §452(c).  Exhibit B is irrelevant to this case and the
request is denied.
In support of his reply, Petitioner asks the court to
judicially notice LAPD’s website (Pet. RJN Ex. A).  The request is granted.  Evid. Code §452(c).
The City’s evidence refers to a Declaration of Grace
Zhang, but none is in the court file or the evidence binders.  As both parties refer to the Zhang
declaration, the court has included cites to it without verifying the
citations.
The court also has ruled on the parties’ evidentiary
objections.  The City’s evidentiary
objections are overruled, including its objection that Petitioner improperly
filed the redacted investigatory records with his opening brief.  Opp. at 10, n.2.  Once a document is produced in a CPRA
response, it is in the public domain. 
Petitioner’s written evidentiary objections have almost all been overruled,
although the court will not consider evidence in direct conflict with the PMQ
deposition.  The clerk is ordered to scan
and electronically file the court’s rulings.


[8] In
reply, Petitioner presents evidence that he identified emails between himself
and LAPD detectives when responding to LAPD’s interrogatories that LAPD did not
produce for his records request, and the Police Museum recently provided
records in discovery in the related civil suit that were not produced by LAPD.  Each of the latter records was responsive to
Items 1-5 of the CPRA Request and were not produced.  Opp. at 2-3. 
This evidence and argument is not properly presented in reply and has
not been considered.  See Regency Outdoor Advertising v. Carolina Lances, Inc.,
(1995) 31 Cal.App.4th 1323, 1333 (new evidence/issues raised for the first time
in a reply brief are not properly presented to a trial court and may be
disregarded).


[9] Section
7922.000 is the CPRA’s catch-all provision and “contemplates a case-by-case
balancing process, with the burden of proof on the proponent of nondisclosure
to demonstrate a clear overbalance on the side of confidentiality.”  Michaelis
v. Superior Court, (2006) 38 Cal.4th 1066, 1071.  The court must

Code section 1054 et seq. or the U.S. or California Constitution, no law
enforcement officer or employee of a law enforcement agency shall disclose to
any arrested person, or to any person who may be a defendant in a criminal
action, the address or telephone number of any person who is a victim or
witness in the alleged offense.  Penal
Code §841.5(a).

[12]
For this reason, Petitioner’s request for in camera review of the
redacted police reports is not well taken. 
See Pet. Op. Br. at 10.


[13]
The City argues that it is unclear what Petitioner means by “CID’s previous
production waives LAPD’s asserted privileges,” since Exhibit Y does not include
the bates number Petitioner cites.  Opp.  at 14. 
Petitioner clarifies its
position that the unredacted plot plan produced by CID (Gleizer Decl., Ex. U,
p. 17), waives LAPD’s claimed privileges for redactions it made to copies of
the same record.  Gleizer Decl., Ex. T,
p. 10, Ex. Y, p. 77.  Reply at 7.


[14]
Petitioner provided evidence that the June 10 production referred to additional
communications between the Police Museum and LAPD, an ICS Form, and personnel
accounting that had not been produced.  Gleizer
Decl., ¶35, Ex. AB.  However, the
Discovery Section reached out to the appropriate LAPD personnel to ascertain
whether such records were created and was told that they were not.  Orocio Decl., ¶60.  Opp. at 16. 
Petitioner does not address this point, and it is waived.
