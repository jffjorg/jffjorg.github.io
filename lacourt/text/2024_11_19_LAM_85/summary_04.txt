And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering whether to allow the action to proceed without Real Party Moshfegh, who was served on August 18, 2024 but has not appeared in the action. Under CCP section 389(b), the judge must determine whether Real Party Moshfegh is an indispensable party. The judge notes that Real Party Moshfegh has not been served, and that service by publication would require a showing that the party to be served "cannot with reasonable diligence be served in another manner." The judge is weighing the factors listed in CCP section 389(b) to determine whether the action should proceed without Real Party Moshfegh, or whether it should be dismissed without prejudice.
