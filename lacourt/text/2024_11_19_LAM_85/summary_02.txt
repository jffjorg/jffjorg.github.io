And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has considered Petitioner's brief, despite it being filed late. The Judge notes that LAPD produced some documents, but not all requested, and that Petitioner identified emails and records not produced by LAPD. The Judge will balance the public interest in disclosure against privacy interests in determining whether LAPD's asserted privileges are waived. The Judge has overruled the City's evidentiary objections and granted Petitioner's request for judicial notice of LAPD's website. The Judge has also ruled that the City's evidence refers to a declaration that is not in the court file or evidence binders. The Judge has directed the clerk to scan and electronically file the court's rulings.
