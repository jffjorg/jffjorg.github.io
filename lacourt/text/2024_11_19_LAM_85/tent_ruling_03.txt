 Case Number:  24STCP02168    Hearing Date:   November 19, 2024    Dept:  85 
United Neighborhoods for Los
Angeles v. City of Los Angeles, et al., 24STCP02168 
Tentative
decision on demurrer:   sustained without leave




 



 
 
Respondents City of Los Angeles and its City Council and Planning
Department (collectively, “City”), jointly with Real Party-in-Interest Whitley
Apartments, LLC (“Whitley”), demur to the Petition filed by Petitioner United
Neighborhoods for Los Angeles (“United Neighborhoods”). 
The court has read and considered the moving papers,
opposition, and reply and renders the following tentative decision. 
 
A. Statement of
the Case
1. Petition 
On July 8, 2024, Petitioner United Neighborhoods filed the Petition
against Respondents City and Real Parties Whitley and Fariborz Moshfegh (“Mosfegh”)
alleging violations of General Plan policies, failure to comply with the City’s
2021-2029 Housing Element, abuse of discretion, violation of the California Environmental
Quality Act (“CEQA”) (Public Resources Code §21000 et seq.), and violation
of Government Code section 66300.6. 
 
The Project
Petitioner challenges a luxury hotel development project (“Whitley
Hotel Project” or “Project”) proposed by Real Parties Moshfegh and Whitley at
1719-1731 North Whitley Avenue, Case No. DIR2016-4920-SPR-1A; ENV-2016-4921-CE
(the “Property”).  As part of the
Project, Real Parties plan to remove 40 existing affordable housing units, all
of which are regulated and protected under the City’s Rent Stabilization
Ordinance.  The City refused to conduct
any CEQA review on the Project in violation of law.  The City also erred in failing to require
replacement of all 40 existing affordable housing units as required by state
law. 
As approved, the Project would demolish six multi-family
residential buildings, comprised of 40 affordable housing units, to develop a
10-story, 156-room luxury hotel.  The Property’s
improvements, developed in 1920, not only currently serves as a vital source of
affordable housing but also has potential value to the preservation of Hollywood
history, given its age, architecture, and location within the boundaries of a
proposed Multi-Family Residential Historic District. 
On August 1, 2019, a planner in the City’s Planning
Department (“Planning”) issued a determination that the Whitley Hotel Project
is exempt from CEQA pursuant to CEQA Guidelines section 15322.  Petitioner timely appealed.
 
The Administrative Appeals
At its October 22, 2019, meeting, the Central Los Angeles
Planning Commission (“APC”) determined that the Project is exempt from CEQA
pursuant to CEQA Guidelines section 15322.  The APC also denied Petitioner United
Neighborhood’s appeal, sustained the Planning Director’s determination to
approve a Site Plan Review for the Project and adopted the Planning Director’s
findings, thereby approving the Project. 
On November 15, 2019, Petitioner timely appealed the APC’s CEQA
determination to the City Council.  
On October 1, 2020, the City Council’s Planning and Land Use
Management (“PLUM”) Committee considered Petitioner’s appeal, along with a
separate appeal.  After public comment
and presentations from the Real Parties and the Petitioner, the PLUM Committee
recommended denial of the appeals and approval of the CEQA categorical exemption
for the Whitley Hotel Project.  On
October 20, 2020, the City Council adopted the PLUM Committee report, approved
the CEQA categorical exemption, and approved the Project.  
 
The Previous Mandate Petition
United Neighborhoods filed a mandate petition against
Respondents in LASC  20STCP03844. The petition
sought to overturn the Project approvals, claiming violations of CEQA and abuse
of discretion under the City’s Site Plan Review requirements.
On June 22, 2022, Department 86, the Honorable Mitchell L.
Beckloff presiding, ruled in favor of Petitioner and issued a writ of mandate requiring
the City to set aside its approvals and CEQA exemption determination on the
2020 Project.
Respondents and Real Parties appealed the trial court’s
decision to the Court of Appeal.  On or
around June 28, 2023, the Second District Court of Appeal, Division Five,
affirmed the trial court’s judgment in a published decision.
On or around December 8, 2023, Planning issued a “Letter to
Rescind Determination”, which referred to the trial court writ ordering the
City to set aside the City’s approvals of the Project.  The Letter to Rescind Determination states:
“As such, the August 1, 2019, determination letter and the [CEQA] Categorical
Exemption are hereby set aside and rescinded.”
 
The December 2023 Determination Letter and 2024 Administrative
Appeals
On or around December 20, 2023, the Director of Planning
issued a Determination Letter approving a Site Plan Review as required under
the Los Angeles Municipal Code (“LAMC”) on the Project application for the
Whitley Hotel Project, further finding that the Project qualifies for the Class
32 CEQA Guideline exemption.  
On or around December 28, 2023, United Neighborhoods timely
filed an administrative appeal from the Director of Planning’s Determination
Letter.  
On March 12, 2024, Planning issued a Staff Report
recommending denial of United Neighborhoods’ appeal.  The City primarily relied on its previous
findings for the Project but added findings that the Project “does not meet or
fulfill several goals, objectives and policies, including Objective 2.1 and
2.3, in the 2021-2029 Housing Element, which call for the preservation of
housing and strengthening renter protections.”  The Staff Report reasoned that because the
City found that the Project is consistent with other General Plan policies, the
CEQA exemption is justified.
At its meeting on April 9, 2024, the APC denied the appeal
in part and granted the appeal in part, sustaining the Director of Planning’s
Determination Letter and conditionally approving a Site Plan Review for the
Project pursuant to LAMC section 16.05.
On or around April 24, 2024, United Neighborhoods timely
administratively appealed the APC’s decision.  United Neighborhoods argued that approving the
Project would be an abuse of discretion and that the revised Project is not
eligible for a CEQA exemption because it is not consistent with all General
Plan policies and further would result in a number of significant impacts.  The appeal also argued exceptions to the CEQA
exemption made it inapplicable. 
On or around June 18, 2024, the PLUM Committee recommended
denial of United Neighborhoods’ appeal and sustaining the APC decision. 
On or around July 2, 2024, City Council, on consent and
taking no public comment, summarily affirmed the PLUM Committee’s recommendation
to deny United Neighborhoods’ administrative appeal. 
 
b. Causes of Action
The Petition’s first cause of action alleges violations of the
City’s General Plan policies, failure to act consistently with the City’s
2021-2029 Housing Element, and abuse of discretion.  
The second cause of action alleges violation of CEQA and the
Code of Civil Procedure.
The third cause of action alleges violation of Government
Code section 66300.6. 
 
c. Prayer for Relief
Plaintiff seeks (1) a peremptory writ of mandate commanding the
City to rescind its issuance of the CEQA categorical exemption and revoke all
approvals, permits, and entitlements issued for the Whitley Hotel Project; (2) injunctive
relief enjoining the City and Real Parties from taking any action to construct
and implement the Whitley Hotel Project, (3) declaratory relief that the City’s
finding that the Whitley Hotel Project categorically exempt from CEQA violates the
substantive and/or procedural requirements of CEQA and that the City’s approval
of the Project violated the City’s General Plan and Government Code section
66300.6, (4) litigation expenses and costs of suit, and (5) such other and
further relief as the court may deem just and proper. 
 
2. Course of Proceedings
A proof of service on file shows that Petitioner served the
City with summons and the Petition on July 11, 2024.  
Proofs of service on file show that Petitioner served Real
Party Whitley by substituted service on August 19, 2024 and served Real Party
Moshfegh on August 18, 2024. 
On October 3, 2024, the court denied Petitioner’s ex parte
application for a temporary restraining order and order to show cause to
prevent demolition of the existing rent stabilized multi-family residential
buildings on the Property.
 
B. Demurrer
1. Applicable Law
            Demurrers
are permitted in administrative mandate proceedings.  CCP §§1108,
1109.  A demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the pleading alone and
will be sustained where the pleading is defective on its face. 
            Where
pleadings are defective, a party may raise the defect by way of a demurrer or
motion to strike or by motion for judgment on the pleadings.  CCP
§430.30(a); Coyne v. Krempels, (1950) The party against whom a complaint
or cross-complaint has been filed may object by demurrer or answer to the
pleading.  CCP §430.10.  A demurrer is timely filed within the 30-day
period after service of the complaint.  CCP §430.40; Skrbina v.
Fleming Companies, (1996) 45 Cal.App.4th 1353, 1364. 
            A demurrer may be asserted on any one or more of the
following grounds: (a) The court has no jurisdiction of the subject of the
cause of action alleged in the pleading; (b) The person who filed the pleading
does not have legal capacity to sue; (c) There is another action pending
between the same parties on the same cause of action; (d) There is a defect or
misjoinder of parties; (e) The pleading does not state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action; (f) The pleading is uncertain (“uncertain” includes
ambiguous and unintelligible); (g) In an action founded upon a contract, it
cannot be ascertained from the pleading whether the contract is written, is
oral, or is implied by conduct; (h) No certificate was filed as required by CCP
section 411.35 or (i) by CCP section 411.36.  CCP §430.10. 
Accordingly, a demurrer tests the sufficiency of a pleading, and the grounds
for a demurrer must appear on the face of the pleading or from judicially
noticeable matters.  CCP §430.30(a); Blank v. Kirwan, (1985) 39 Cal.3d
311, 318.  The face of the pleading includes attachments and
incorporations by reference (Frantz v. Blackwell, (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d
91, 94); it does not include inadmissible hearsay.  Day v. Sharp,
(1975) 50 Cal.App.3d 904, 914.   
            The sole
issue on demurrer for failure to state a cause of action is whether the facts
pleaded, if true, would entitle the plaintiff to relief.  Garcetti v.
Superior Court, (1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 1533, 1547; Limandri v. Judkins,
(1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 326, 339.  The question of plaintiff’s ability to
prove the allegations of the complaint or the possible difficulty in making
such proof does not concern the reviewing court.  Quelimane Co. v.
Stewart Title Guaranty Co., (1998) 19 Cal.4th 26, 47.  The ultimate
facts alleged in the complaint must be deemed true, as well as all facts that
may be implied or inferred from those expressly alleged.  Marshall v.
Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1397, 1403. 
Nevertheless, this rule does not apply to allegations expressing mere
conclusions of law, or allegations contradicted by the exhibits to the
complaint or by matters of which judicial notice may be taken.  Vance
v. Villa Park Mobilehome Estates, (1995) 36 Cal.App.4th 698, 709. 
            For all
demurrers filed after January 1, 2016, the demurring party must meet and confer
in person or by telephone with the party who filed the pleading for the purpose
of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the
objections to be raised in the demurrer.  CCP §430.31(a).  As part of
the meet and confer process, the demurring party must identify all of the
specific causes of action that it believes are subject to demurrer and provide
legal support for the claimed deficiencies.  CCP §430.31(a)(1).  The
party who filed the pleading must in turn provide legal support for its
position that the pleading is legally sufficient or, in the alternative, how
the complaint, cross-complaint, or answer could be amended to cure any legal
insufficiency.  Id.  The demurring party is responsible for
filing and serving a declaration that the meet and confer requirement has been
met.  CCP §430.31(a)(3).   
            If a demurrer is sustained, the court may
grant leave to amend the pleading upon any terms as may be just and shall fix
the time within which the amendment or amended pleading shall be filed.  CCP
§472a(c).  It is an abuse of discretion to grant a motion for judgment
on the pleadings without leave to amend if there is any reasonable possibility
that the plaintiff can state a good cause of action.  Dudley v.
Department of Transportation (“Dudley”) (2001), 90 Cal. App. 4th
255, 260.  However, in response
to a demurrer and prior to the case being at issue, a complaint or
cross-complaint shall not be amended more than three times, absent an offer to
the trial court as to such additional facts to be pleaded that there is a
reasonable possibility the defect can be cured to state a cause of action.  CCP §430.41(e)(1).
 
C. Analysis[1]
            Respondents
City and Real Party Whitley[2] jointly demur to the Petition’s first and third causes of
action on the ground they are barred by the applicable statute of limitations.
 
1. Meet and Confer
On September 16, 2024,
counsel for Real Party, the City, and Petitioner held a meet and confer
and did not resolve the issues raised.  The
City and Real Party have satisfied their requirement to meet
and confer.  
 
2. Section
65009(c)(1) 
Except as inapplicable, no action or proceeding shall be
maintained to attack, review, set aside, void, or annul any decision on the
matters listed in sections 65901 and 65903, or to determine the reasonableness,
legality, or validity of any condition attached to a variance, conditional use
permit, or any other permit “unless the action or proceeding is commenced and
services is made on the legislative body within 90 days after the legislative
body’s decision.” §65009(c)(1)(E).  Section
65009(a)(3) provides in part that “[t]he purpose of this section is to provide
certainty for property owners and local governments regarding decisions made
pursuant to this division.” 
The legislative intent for this provision “is to establish a
short limitations period in order to give governmental zoning decisions
certainty, permitting them to take effect quickly and giving property owners
the necessary confidence to proceed with approved projects.”  Wagner v. City of South Pasadena,
(2000) 78 Cal.App.4th 943, 948-49. 
Strict compliance with the limitations period is required.  Id., at 950; see
§65009(e).  This short limitation period
serves the important legislative purpose of permitting the rapid resolution of
legal challenges to local land use decisions and to provide certainty to local
agencies and property owners alike.  Honig v. San Francisco Planning Dept., (“Honig”)
(2005) 127 Cal. App. 4th 520, 528. The intent is for permit decisions to take
effect quickly and give property owners the confidence to proceed with approved
projects.  Wagner v. City of S. Pasadena, (2000) 78
Cal. App. 4th 943, 948–49. 
To avoid keeping projects in “a state of perpetual limbo,” a
challenger must file and serve the action within 90 days of the challenged
decision.  1305 Ingraham, LLC v. City
of Los Angeles, (“1305 Ingraham”) (2019) 32 Cal. App. 5th 1253, 1262-63.
The term “legislative body” is interpreted broadly to include decisions by City
zoning administrator, director, and/or boards of appeals.  Id. at 1263-65.  After expiration of the statute of
limitations, “all persons are barred from any further action or proceeding”,
and there are no exceptions.  Travis v. County of Santa Cruz, (2004) 33
Cal. 4th 757, 768.   A demurrer is properly sustained on
statute of limitations grounds when the pleading discloses on its face, or on
facts subject to judicial notice, that it is barred by the applicable statute
of limitations.  Honig, supra,
127 Cal.App.4th at 524.
Even if a petition is timely filed, the petition must be
dismissed if it is not timely served.  Wagner v. City of South Pasadena, supra,
78 Cal. App. 4th at 948-51.  The
service deadline is important to achieving the statutory objectives because
“[r]equiring an aggrieved citizen to file an action within 90 days but
permitting him or her to withhold service for months or even years would
effectively suspend the effective date of local land use and development
decisions and leave such matters at the mercy of the complainant.” Honig, supra, 127 Cal. App. 4th at
526 (citation omitted). 
Additionally, CCP section 389(a) provides for the compulsory
joinder of necessary parties and CCP section 389(b) provides for the dismissal
of the action if a necessary party is also indispensable and cannot be joined.[3]  Failure to join an indispensable party is not
a jurisdictional defect in the fundamental sense of jurisdiction.  The court has the power to render a decision
as to the parties before it in the absence of an indispensable party.  It is for reasons of equity and convenience
only that a court will not proceed with a case where it determines that an
indispensable party is absent and cannot be joined.  Save Our Bay, Inc. v. San Diego Unified
Port District, (1996) 42 Cal.App.4th 686, 693.  The controlling test for whether a necessary
party is also indispensable under CCP section 389(b) is whether “the plaintiff
seeks some type of affirmative relief which, if granted, would injure or affect
the interest of a third person not joined. 
Id. at 692.
The City and Real Party Whitley argue that Whitley owns the
Property and the relief sought in this action would impair its ability to
protect its interests.  They contend that Whitley is an indispensable
party that Petitioner United Neighborhoods was required to serve within the 90-day
limitations period.  The Director of
Planning issued a Determination Letter approving the Project’s Site Plan Review
application and adopting a Class 32 exemption from CEQA on December 23,
2023.  Pet., ¶26.  Petitioner appealed and the APC issued its decision
granting the appeal in part and denying it in part on April 9, 2024.  Pet.,
¶27.  The APC specified that its decision
is not further appealable and shall become final upon the mailing of this
determination letter.  Pet., ¶¶ 29, 30;
RJN Ex. B.  
Thus, to be timely, any challenge to the APC’s decision must
have been filed and served on all required parties by July 23, 2024.  Petitioner United Neighborhoods filed the
Petition containing the first and third causes of action -- which section
65009(c)(1) governs for limitation purposes -- on July 8, 2024.  Petitioner then timely served the City on July
8, 2024.  Petitioner did not serve Real
Party Whitley until August 19, 2024, 117 days after the APC’s decision was
final.   RJN Ex. D.   Thus, the Petition is time-barred if Whitley
was required to be served within the time limits of section 65009(c)(1)(E).  
The City and Real Party rely on Templeton Action Committee v. Cnty. of San
Luis Obispo, (“Templeton”) (2014) 228 Cal. App. 4th 427, 431-32. In Templeton, the governing statute, section 66499.37, required that an action or
proceeding to set aside the decision of an appeal board or legislative body
concerning a subdivision shall not be maintained unless the action or
proceeding is commenced, and service of summons effected, within 90 days after
the date of decision.  Id. at 429.  The petitioner timely filed a petition and
served the respondent agency, but failed to timely join a developer whose
rights could have been affected by the action.  Id.
The court held that the developer was an indispensable party and ordered
dismissal of the case for failure to serve an indispensable party within the 90-day
statutory period.  Id. See also, Sierra Club, Inc. v. Cal. Coastal Comm’n, (“Sierra
Club”) (1979) 95 Cal. App. 3d 495, 499-505; County of Imperial v. Sup. Ct., (“County
of Imperial”) (2007) 152 Cal. App. 4th 13, 40.  Dem. at 15-16.
Petitioner United Neighborhoods does not dispute that Real
Party Whitley is an indispensable party. 
Nor can it.  See Beresford
Neighborhood Assn. v. City of San Mateo, (“Beresford”) (1989)
207 Cal.App.3d 1180, 1188 (where plaintiff seeks to set aside
developer’s permit, developer is indispensable party).  Petitioner argues that the City and Real
Party gloss over the language in section 65009(c)(1),
which expressly provides for dismissal “unless the action or proceeding is
commenced and service is made on the legislative body within 90 days
after the legislative body’s decision…” (emphasis added).  The statute refers to service on the
legislative body only.  Nowhere in the
statute did the Legislature require service on a real party-in-interest in the
90-day period.  The Legislature could
have easily written the statute to include service on real parties and elected
not to do so.  Opp. at 7-8.
Petitioner notes that a court
first looks to the plain language of the statute in interpreting at statute.  When the language is clear and unambiguous,
there is no need for further construction. 
Wells Fargo Bank v. Goldzband,
(1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 596, 614.  To
interpret section 65009(c)(1) any
differently would be to ignore its express language and lead to unintended and
perverse consequences.  Any developer who
obtained a permit that would result in illegal development could get away
scot-free so long as the developer evaded service of process for 90 days.  The Legislature did not create such an easy
loophole.  Opp. at 6, 10.
Petitioner argues that Templeton, supra, 228 Cal.App.4th at
431-32, is inapposite because the governing statute in that case was Subdivision
Map Act section 66499.37, not Planning and Land Use Code section 65009(c)(1).  Unlike section
65009(c)(1), section 66499.37 contains no express limitation for service on the
“legislative body.”  Rather, it states
that an action “shall not be maintained by any person unless the action or
proceeding is commenced and service of summons effected within 90 days after
the date of the decision.”  Thus, section
66499.37 requires “service of summons to be effected” whereas section
65009(c)(1) requires service only on the legislative body.  Opp. at 8.
Additionally, both Sierra Club, supra, 95
Cal.App.3d at 495 (developer was indispensable party to permit challenge under
the Coastal Act), and County of
Imperial, supra, 152 Cal.App.4th at 13 (water districts were
indispensable parties to county’s challenge to state water board’s approval of
water transfer agreement), are distinguishable because the petitioner sought to
amend the pleading to add the indispensable party after the statute of
limitations had run and neither case involved a legal challenge governed by section 65009(c)(1).  Opp. at 9.
The City and Real Party also
cite Salmon Protection & Watershed Network v. County of Marin, (“SPAWN”)
(2012) 205 Cal.App.4th 195, 208.  In SPAWN,
at issue was intervenor landowners’ argument that the county and challenging
petitioner could not enter into a statute of limitations tolling agreement
without them for a CEQA challenge to the adoption of an amendment to the
county’s general plan.   Id. at
199-200.  Therefore, the CEQA challenge
must be dismissed.  Id. at
200.  The court stated that the
intervenors were only incidentally affected by the general plan amendment, and
the tolling agreement was effective to prevent running of the CEQA statute of
limitations.  Id. at 206.  The intervenors argued that the action
nonetheless was time-barred by section 65009(c)(1).  Id.  The court stated that it need not decide
whether section 65009 could apply to an action based solely on CEQA because
there was no reason the directly affected parties could not agree to toll that
statute as well.  Id. at 208.  Section 65009 applies to suits challenging
adoption of general plans and is intended to provide certainty to property
owners as well as local governments.  Id.  Nonetheless, the general public (property
owners) are only an incidental beneficiary of section 65009(c)(1) and the local
government can waive or extend the limitation period without them.  Id. 
“The 90-day time limit in Government
Code section 65009, subdivision (c)(1)(A) requires service of a complaint only
on ’the legislative body’ and the public body is the only party necessary to
the suit challenging the adoption of the plan.” 
Id.  
Petitioner United Neighborhoods
argues that SPAWN undercuts the demurrer’s argument.  There is no tolling agreement at issue here
and SPAWN’s only mention on the service requirements of section
65009(c)(1) supports its position.  Opp.
at 9.
Petitioner makes a substantial
argument about section 65009(c)(1)’s plain meaning.  It expressly provides for dismissal unless service
is made on the legislative body within 90 days after the legislative body’s
decision and does not make any reference to real parties.  This is distinct from section 66499.37, which
concerns subdivisions and refers to service of summons within 90 days after the
date of decision without reference to service on the legislative body.  In interpreting a statute, the court first looks
to the language of the statute, attempting to give effect to the usual,
ordinary import of the language and seeking to avoid making any language mere
surplusage.  Brown v. Kelly
Broadcasting Co., (1989) 48 Cal 3d 711, 724.  “’The
statute's words generally provide the most reliable indicator of legislative
intent; if they are clear and unambiguous, ‘[t]here is no need for judicial
construction and a court may not indulge in it. [Citation.]’” MCI
Communications Services, Inc. v. California Dept. of Tax & Fee
Administration, (“MCI”) (2018) 28 Cal. App. 5th 635, 643.
However, in construing a
statute, the court always must ascertain the intent of the Legislature to
effectuate the purpose of the law.  Brown
v. Kelly Broadcasting Co., (1989) 48 Cal.3d 711, 724.  Additionally, where
ambiguity remains, the court should consider “reason, practicality, and common
sense.”  This requires consideration of
the statute’s purpose, the evils to be remedied, public policy, and contemporaneous
administrative construction.  MCI,
supra, 28 Cal.App.5th at
643.  The enactment must be given a
reasonable and commonsense interpretation consistent with the apparent purpose
and intent of the lawmakers, practical rather than technical in nature, and
which, when applied, will result in wise policy rather than mischief or
absurdity.  Lungren v. Deukmejian,
(1988) 45 Cal. 3d 727, 735.
Petitioner’s
argument ignores the fact that there must be some statute of limitations for
naming and serving a real party developer that is indispensable to a permit
challenge.  The only viable limitations
period besides the 90-day period in section 65009(c)(1) is the three-year
period of CCP section 338(a) for action on liability created by statute.  Similarly, CCP sections 583.210(a) and
583.250 are the only alternate service provisions and they only require that
summons and complaint be served within three years after the action is
commenced or be subject to mandatory dismissal. 

Yet,
a three-year limitation period to name and serve an indispensable real party
would be directly contrary to the purpose of section 65009.  The short limitations period in section
65009(c)(1) was adopted by the Legislature to (i) “reduce delays and restraints
upon expeditiously completing housing projects…” (ii) avoid a “chilling effect
on the confidence with which property owners and local governments can
proceed with projects…” and, (iii) provide certainty for property owners
and local governments.” §65009(a) (emphases added). “The clear legislative
intent of this statute is to establish a short limitations period in order to
give governmental zoning decisions certainty, permitting them to take effect
quickly and giving property owners the necessary confidence to proceed
with approved projects.” Ching v. San Francisco Bd. of Permit Appeals,
(1988) 60 Cal.App.4th 888, 893 (emphasis added).  
Thus,
the express intent of section 65009 is to bring cases to a speedy resolution
for local governments and property owners alike. The only interpretation of
section 65009(c)(1) that effectuates this purpose is to require service on
indispensable real parties in addition to “service…on the legislative body”.  This interpretation does not rewrite or do
violence to the plain language of section 65009(c)(1) because real parties are
not respondents; they are interested parties who must be added as indispensable
under CCP section 389.  When they are
added, real parties stand in the shoes of a respondent.  It makes sense, therefore, that section
65009(c)(1) would not address them directly and that its 90-day period for
commencement and service should apply to them as a matter of consequence.
SPAWN helps to explain
why section 65009(c)(1) refers only to service on the legislative body.  Some claims subject to section 65009(c)(1),
including the general plan amendment at issue in SPAWN, will not have
indispensable parties.  For those claims,
there is no need for service on any party other than the legislative body.  Hence, the specific language of section 65009(c)(1)
requires only service on the legislative body. 
Where there is an indispensable real party, however, section 65009(c)(1)
requires service on both the legislative body and indispensable party within
the 90-day period.
This
interpretation is consistent with Beresford, supra, 207 Cal.App.3d
at 1180, which dismissed a petitioner’s zoning claim under the 120-day
limitations period in section 65009(c)(2) because the petitioner failed to name
a real party-in-interest developer who was indispensable to the action.  Id. at 1188.  The developer could not be joined because the
limitations period had run, and the action had to be dismissed.  Id. at 119-90.  See also Sierra Club, supra,
95 Cal.App.3d at 501 (same).  
Real
Party Whitley is the Property owner and an indispensable party.  Under Bersesford and Sierra Club,
it must be timely named and served.  Petitioner
United Neighborhoods distinguishes Sierra Club, and therefore Beresford,
on the basis that the Petition does name Whitley as Real Party; Whitley simply
was not served within the 90-day period. 
Opp. at 9.  But partial compliance
with section 65009(c)(1) by naming Real Party in the Petition is
inadequate.  It must also be timely
served, and Petitioner served Whitley too late.[4]
Petitioner
notes that “[a]nother ‘fundamental rule[] of statutory construction is that a
law should not be applied in a manner producing absurd results…”  San Jose Unified School Dist. v. Santa
Clara County Office of Education, (2017) 7 Cal.App.5th 967, 982.  A requirement that a petitioner must file and
serve the real parties-in-interest within the 90-day abbreviated time limit of
section 65009 puts all petitioners at the real risk of their lawsuits being
dismissed from the outset by a real party who evades service. While a
legislative body has a publicly accessible agent for service of process, a real
party, particularly a private individual, can be exceedingly difficult to
locate and serve.  Taken to its extreme,
even a petitioner who files their lawsuit one day after an agency’s final
project approval may be deprived of their right to redress by a
difficult-to-serve real party.  Opp. at
10.[5]
Petitioner’s
service efforts in this case are illustrative of this difficulty.  Real Parties were aware of this lawsuit and
actively avoided service.  On July 9,
2024, Petitioner’s counsel contacted counsel for both Respondent and Real
Parties, attached a copy of the filed Petition, and asked whether each would
accept service electronically.  Venskus
Decl., ¶2, Ex. A.  Real Parties’ counsel
ignored the request.  Ibid.  Petitioner’s counsel reached out again, and
Real Parties’ counsel only responded weeks later on July 24—the day of the
expiration of the 90-day period to serve the legislative body—stating that he
was unable to accept service on behalf of his clients.  Venskus Decl., ¶3, Ex. B.  Petitioner’s counsel immediately commenced
formal efforts to personally serve Real Parties.  Venskus Decl., ¶¶ 3-5, Ex. B.  Petitioner’s counsel sent a notice and
acknowledgment to each Real Party. 
Venskus Decl. ¶4, Ex. C.  These
also were ignored.  Petitioner then
personally served each Real Party in mid-August.  It took three separate attempts over the
course of three days to serve individual Real Party Moshfegh.  Venskus Decl., ¶5.   Opp. at 11.
The
City and Real Party replies that Petitioner’s concern is unwarranted given that
it had various methods of service available, including service on Real Party
Whitley’s agent for service of process or substituted service upon the exercise
of due diligence.  Petitioner should not
be allowed to wait until the 89th day to file and then complain
about missing the service deadline. 
Reply at 7.
The
court agrees, also noting that Petitioner’s action would not be untimely if
only Real Party Whitley was served because Moshfegh would not then be
indispensable.
Finally,
Petitioner argues that the court could have ordered service on Real Parties at
the initial trial setting conference and Real Party Whitley waived any claim of
tardy service by making a general appearance at the September 17, 2024 trial
setting conference.   Opp. at 11-12.  An indispensable property owner should not
have to rely on court-ordered service as the only means of ensuring inclusion
in the lawsuit before mandatory dismissal is required after three years of
non-service under CCP sections 583.210(a) and 583.250.  The City and Real Party also correctly reply
that a general appearance has no bearing on passage of the statute of
limitations.  Reply at 6-7. The pertinent
section 65009(c)(1) requires naming and service within 90 days.
 
D. Conclusion
Real
Party Whitley is an indispensable party and Petitioner was required to serve it
within the 90-day period of section 65009(c)(1).  The demurrer to the first and third causes of
action is sustained without leave to amend.
