 Case Number:  24STLC06493    Hearing Date:   November 19, 2024    Dept:  85 
PNC Bank v. Sarbjit Singh and
Isaura Singh, 24STLC06493 

Tentative decision on application for
writ of possession:   




 



PNC Bank (“Bank”) seeks a writ of possession against
Defendants Sarbjit Singh (“Sarbjit”) and Isaura Singh (“Isaura”).   
The court has read and considered the moving papers (no
opposition was filed) and renders the following tentative decision. 
 
A. Statement of
the Case
On September 9, 2024, Plaintiff filed the Complaint against
Defendants Sarbjit and Isaura alleging claims for breach of contract, claim and
delivery, conversion, account stated, and breach of guaranty. 
On or about December 26, 2017, Plaintiff Bank and Defendant
Sarbjit entered into a written Loan and Security (“Agreement”) for the purchase
of a 2018 Great Dane Reefer Trailer, VIN 1GRAA062XJW122251 (“Equipment”).  Thereafter, Bank performed all the terms and
conditions of the Agreement required of it.  
To induce Bank to furnish the Equipment, Sarbjit and Isaura
each executed a Personal Guaranty (“Guaranty”) of all of Sarbjit’s obligations,
including those under the Agreement in favor of Bank.  
Bank obtained a Certificate of Title and filed a UCC
Financing Statement with the California Secretary of State, thereby perfecting
its security interest in the Equipment. 
On or about October 1, 2023, Sarbjit failed to make the
payment due under the Agreement and has failed to make any further payments due
thereafter.  Pursuant to the Agreement,
Plaintiff has elected to accelerate the remaining contract balance.  The contract balance at the time of default
was $5,103.92.  Additionally, pursuant to
the terms of Agreement, Sarbjit is liable for late charges of $510.40 and a
site visit/repossession fee of $500 in a total amount to be determined at
trial.  Additionally, default interest
accrues at the rate of 18% per annum.  
The unpaid total balance now due, owing, and unpaid from Sarbjit
under the Agreement is $6,114.32, together with interest thereon at the rate
set forth in Agreement in a total according to proof at the time of trial.   
 
2. Course of Proceedings 
On September 9, 2024, Plaintiff filed the Complaint. 
Defendants were served by substitute service on October 29,
2024, with service effective on November 8, 2024.
On September 10, 2024, Plaintiff filed the Application for
Writ of Possession.  
Defendants’ default was entered on November 12, 2024.
 
B. Applicable Law
A writ of possession is issued as a provisional remedy in a
cause of action for claim and delivery, also known as replevin.  See
Pillsbury, Madison & Sutro v. Schectman, (1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 1279,
1288.  As a provisional remedy, the right
to possession is only temporary, and title and the right to possess are
determined in the final judgment.  
            A
writ of possession is available in any pending action.  It also is available where an action has been
stayed pending arbitration, so long as the arbitration award may be ineffectual
without provisional relief.  See CCP §1281.7. 
 
            1. Procedure
            Upon
the filing of the complaint or at any time thereafter, a plaintiff may apply
for an order for a writ of possession. 
Unlike attachment, where Judicial Council forms are optional, the
parties must use the mandatory approved Judicial Council forms in a claim and
delivery proceeding.  (Judicial Council
Forms CD-100 et seq.).
            A
plaintiff must make a written application for a writ of possession.  CCP §512.010(a), (b); (Mandatory Form
CD-100); CCP §512.010(a).  A verified
complaint alone is insufficient.  6
Witkin, California Procedure, (5th ed. 2008) §255, p.203.  The application may be supported by
declarations and/or a verified complaint. 
CCP §516.030.  The declarations or
complaint must set forth admissible evidence except where expressly permitted
to be shown on information and belief.  Id.
            The
application must be executed under oath and include: (1) A showing of the basis
of the plaintiff's claim and that the plaintiff is entitled to possession of
the property claimed.  If the plaintiff's
claim is based on a written instrument, a copy of it must be attached; (2) A
showing that the property is wrongfully detained by the defendant, how the
defendant came into possession of it, and, the reasons for the detention based
on the plaintiff’s best knowledge, information, and belief; (3) A specific description
of the property and statement of its value; (4) The location of the property
according to the plaintiff’s best knowledge, information, and belief.  If the property, or some part of it, is
within a private place which may have to be entered to take possession, a
showing of probable cause to believe that the property is located there; and
(5) A statement that the property has not been taken for (a) a tax, assessment,
or fine, pursuant to a statute, or (b) an execution against the plaintiff’s
property.  Alternatively, a statement
that if the property was seized for one of these purposes, it is by statute
exempt from such seizure.  CCP
§512.010(b).
 
            2. The Hearing
            Before
noticing a hearing, the plaintiff must serve the defendant with all of the
following: (1) A copy of the summons and complaint; (2) A Notice of Application
and Hearing; and (3) A copy of the application and any supporting declaration.  CCP §512.030(a).  If the defendant has not appeared in the
action, service must be made in the same manner as service of summons and
complaint.  CCP §512.030(b).
            Each
party shall file with the court and serve upon the other party any declarations
and points and authorities intended to be relied upon at the hearing.  CCP §512.050. 
At the hearing, the court decides the merits of the application based on
the pleadings and declarations.   Id.  Upon a showing of good cause, the court may
receive and consider additional evidence and authority presented at the
hearing, or may continue the hearing for the production of such additional
evidence, oral or documentary, or the filing of other affidavits or points and
authorities.  Id.  
            The
court may order issuance of a writ of possession if both of the following are
found: (1) The plaintiff has established the probable validity of the
plaintiff’s claim to possession of the property; and (2) The undertaking
requirements of CCP section 515.010 are satisfied.  CCP §512.060(a).  “A claim has ‘probable validity’ where it is
more likely than not that the plaintiff will obtain a judgment against the
defendant on that claim.”  CCP
§511.090.  This requires that the
plaintiff establish a prima facie case; the writ shall not issue if the
defendant shows a reasonable probability of a successful defense to the claim
and delivery cause of action.  Witkin,
California Procedure, (5th ed. 2008) §261, p.208.  A defendant’s claim of defect in the property
is not a defense to the plaintiff’s right to possess it.  RCA Service Co. v. Superior Court,
(1982) 137 Cal.App.3d 1, 3.
            No
writ directing the levying officer to enter a private place to take possession
of any property may be issued unless the plaintiff has established that there
is probable cause to believe that the property is located there.  CCP §512.060(b).  
            The
successful plaintiff may obtain a preliminary injunction containing the same
provisions as a TRO that remains in effect until the property is seized by the
levying officer.[1]  CCP §513.010(c).  
            The
court may also issue a “turnover order” directing the defendant to transfer
possession of the property to the plaintiff (See Mandatory Form CD-120). 
The order must notify the defendant that failure to comply may subject
him or her to contempt of court.  CCP
§512.070.  The turnover remedy is not
issued in lieu of a writ, but in conjunction with it to provide the plaintiff
with a less expensive means of obtaining possession.  See
Edwards v Superior Court, (“Edwards”) (1991) 230 Cal.App.3d 173,
178.
 
            3. The Plaintiff’s Undertaking
            Generally,
the court cannot issue an order for a writ of possession until the plaintiff
has filed an undertaking with the court (Mandatory Form CD-140 for personal
sureties).  CCP §515.010(a).  The undertaking shall provide that the
sureties are bound to the defendant for the return of the property to the
defendant, if return of the property is ordered, and for the payment to the
defendant of any sum recovered against the plaintiff.  Id. 
The undertaking shall be in an amount not less than twice the value of
the defendant's interest in the property or in a greater amount.  Id. 
The value of the defendant's interest in the property is determined by
the market value of the property less the amount due and owing on any
conditional sales contract or security agreement and all liens and encumbrances
on the property, and any other factors necessary to determine the defendant’s
interest in the property.  Id.
            However,
where the defendant has no interest in the property, the court must waive the requirement
of the plaintiff’s undertaking and include in the order for issuance of the
writ the amount of the defendant’s undertaking sufficient to satisfy the
requirements of CCP section 515.020(b).  CCP
§515.010(b).

D. Analysis
Plaintiff Bank seeks
a writ of possession for the Equipment against Defendants.  No opposition is on file.
 
1. Probable Validity
On or about December 26, 2017, Defendant Sarbjit entered
into the Agreement with Bank for the purchase of the Equipment.  McGinley Decl., ¶5, Ex. 1.  Thereafter, Bank performed all the terms and
conditions of the Agreement required to be performed by it.  McGinley Decl., ¶6.       
Bank obtained a Certificate of Title and filed a UCC
Financing Statement with the California Secretary of State, thereby perfecting
its security interest in the subject. 
McGinley Decl., ¶6, Ex. 2.  
            On
or about October 1, 2023, Defendant Sarbjit failed to make the payment due
under the Agreement and has failed to make any further payments due thereafter.  McGinley Decl., ¶7.  Pursuant to the terms of Agreement, Bank has
elected to accelerate the remaining contract balance due under Agreement.  McGinley Decl., ¶8.  The contract balance at the time of default
was $5,103.92.  McGinley Decl., ¶8.  Additionally, pursuant to the terms of
Agreement, Defendant Sarbjit is liable for late charges of $510.40 and a site
visit/repossession fee of $500 in a total amount to be determined at the time
of trial.  McGinley Decl., ¶9.  The unpaid total balance now due, owing, and
unpaid from Defendant Sarbjit under the Agreement is currently $6,114.32,
together with interest thereon in a total according to proof at the time of
trial.  McGinley Decl., ¶10.  
The declaration supporting an application for a writ of
possession must be set forth with particularity.  CCP §516.030. 
This means that the plaintiff must show evidentiary facts rather than
the ultimate facts commonly found in pleadings. 
A recitation of conclusions without a foundation of evidentiary facts is
insufficient.  See Rodes v.
Shannon, (1961) 194 Cal.App.2d 743, 749 (declaration containing conclusions
inadequate for summary judgment); Schessler v. Keck, (1956) 138
Cal.App.2d 663, 669 (same).  The
declaration must also affirmatively show the declarant’s competency to
testify to the facts.  CCP §516.030.  At a minimum, the declaration must show how
the declarant knows the facts; boilerplate recitations that the declarant has
personal knowledge are inadequate.  See
Snider v. Snider, (1962) 200 Cal.App.2d 741, 754 (boilerplate recitation
of personal knowledge insufficient without additional foundation showing how he
or she knew). 
Plaintiff Bank fails to meet this particularity requirement
to support the amount owed as $6,114.32. 
No loan history or evidentiary detail is provided to show the accuracy
of this amount, which is important for the issue of undertaking.  As no opposition is on file, this defect is
waived.
Plaintiff Bank has established the probable validity of its claim
to possession of the Vehicle.  CCP §§
511.090, 512.060(a).  
 
2. Undertaking
            The
undertaking required by CCP section 515.010(a) is an amount not less than twice
the value of the defendant's interest in the property or in a greater
amount.  Id.  The value of the defendant's interest in the
property is determined by the market value of the property less the amount due
and owing on any conditional sales contract or security agreement and all liens
and encumbrances on the property.  Id.  
The Equipment’s fair market value is $20,000.  McGinley Decl., ¶24.  The unpaid principal balance is currently $6,114.32.  McGinley Decl., ¶10.
The market value exceeds the amount owed by $13,886.  Bank’s undertaking shall be $27,771.  The re-delivery bond also shall be $27,771.  CCP §515.020(a).
 
3. Location of the Vehicle
There is probable cause to believe the Equipment is
currently located at 2726 Chicory Lane, Palmdale, CA 93551.  McGinley Decl., ¶19.  This is the address for Defendants on the
Agreement.  Ex. A.  The levying officer may enter this location
to recover the Vehicle.  CCP
§512.060(b).  
 
E. Conclusion
The applications for order for a writ of possession and
turnover order against Defendants Sarbjit
and Isaura are granted.  Bank’s undertaking shall be $27,771.  The re-delivery bond also shall be
$27,771.  Plaintiff has provided proposed
orders stamped “Courtesy Copy” and must provide clean versions with the correct
undertaking numbers within two court days or they will be deemed as waived.
