And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to continue the trial date from August 12, 2024, to a later date. The defendants argue that they have not had a chance to depose the plaintiff and need additional time to complete discovery. The plaintiff argues that the deposition is already scheduled for June 14, 2024. The judge is unclear whether the deposition took place and is granting the motion to continue the trial date to September _, 2024. The judge is requiring the moving party to give notice of the new trial date. The judge's decision will be based on California Rules of Court, rule 3.1332, subdivision (c), which outlines the factors to consider when granting a continuance.
