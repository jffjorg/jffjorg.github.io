And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the pleadings and supplements filed by the parties and has tentatively ruled as follows.

The court notes that the plaintiff claims that documents dating back to 2014 exist pertaining to claims of sexual harassment by Badger, and that the plaintiff was not the first to make complaints about Badger.

The court also notes that the departmental review is a significant step in the tenure review process, and that the plaintiff argues that the defendant would not terminate her without a reason.

However, the court finds that the plaintiff's supplemental brief does not address the case, and that the plaintiff's arguments are circular.

The court also finds that the defendant's arguments that the amendments to the complaint will require additional depositions and discovery, and that the added costs of preparation are a reason to deny leave to amend, are unpersuasive.

Finally, the court notes that the plaintiff's claims of sexual harassment are based on allegations of harassment by someone else, and that the court's review of the FEHA complaint does not provide details as to any alleged harassment based on sex or gender.

The court will consider these matters further and will issue a final ruling at a later date.
