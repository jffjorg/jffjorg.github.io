[1] According to
Plaintiff, documents dating back to 2014 exist pertaining to claims of sexual
harassment by Badger. (Supp. Reply Brief p. 4:23-24.) Thus, Plaintiff was not
the first to make complaints about Badger. 
 


[2]  “Each stage
of the tenure review process is not compartmentalized. In practical terms, the
most significant step in the entire process appears to be the departmental
review, which lays the groundwork for subsequent levels of review.” (Clark,
infra, 6 Cal.App.4th at p. 669, emphasis added.) 
 


[3] Defendant does
not address this point nor the case. 
 


[4] Because Clark dealt
with racial discrimination, the court’s analysis focused on the criteria set
forth in McDonnell Douglas test. 
 


[5] To this,
Plaintiff responds with a somewhat circular argument. “It is clear that where
an employee has a known decision point for hire or termination after five
years, there is less reason and motivation to undertake any hasty retaliation
or termination against that employee sooner than natural break point in the
relationship.” (Plaintiff’s Supp. Reply p. 9:9-12.) 
 


[6] To this,
Plaintiff argues that had Helou “do[ne] otherwise would constitute more
conspicuous or obvious retaliation that an employer like Defendant can be
expected to avoid.” (Plaintiff’s Supp. Brief p. 9:5-6.) That is also a circular
argument. 
 


[7] Plaintiff’s
Supplemental Brief does not address this case. 

 


[8] See Greyhound
Corp. v. Superior Court (1961) 56 Cal.2d 355, 377; see also Williams v.
Superior Court (2017) 3 Cal.5th 531, 542.) 


[9] An employee must
exhaust her administrative remedies with DFEH before filing a civil suit
alleging FEHA violations. “Exhaustion includes the timely filing of administrative
complaints addressing the claims and parties at issue….” (Kim, supra,
226 Cal.App.4th at p. 1345, emphasis added.)
 


[10] For context, Dean
Helou met with Plaintiff on 12/4/2019 advising her that she would be terminated
for plagiarism. That next day, on 12/5/2019, Plaintiff went on a medical leave
of absence. On 1/21/2020, Plaintiff filed a workers’ compensation claim. On 8/31/2020,
Plaintiff was deposed in the workers’ compensation matter. On 1/3/2022,
Plaintiff filed a complaint with the DFEH complaint (Opp. p. 7.) On 12/29/22,
Plaintiff filed the instant action. 
 


[11] For clarity,
the court’s review of the FEHA complaint does not provide details as to any
allege harassment based upon sex or gender. While the FEHA complaint may
state that “Complainant was harassed because of complainant's sex/gender,
gender identity or expression, disability (physical or mental), medical
condition (cancer or genetic characteristic), age (40 and over), other, sexual
harassment- hostile environment, sexual harassment- quid pro quo, family care
or medical leave (cfra)” the “additional complaint details” do not reference
any purported sexual harassment Plaintiff experienced but the sexual
harassment that someone else (a student) experienced. (See 9/9/24 Filing
[‘Amended Complaint’] pp. 41-42 of 44 of PDF.) 
 


[12] Defendant also
argues that the amendments will require additional depositions and discovery,
thereby extending the trial date. As for added costs of preparation being a
reason to deny leave to amend, it is unclear whether another deposition,
written discovery and factual investigations amounts to the cost contemplated
by the courts. Defendant cites to Solit v. Tokai Bank, Ltd. New York Branch (1999)
68 Cal.App.4th 1435, 1448, but that opinion in passing notes that added
costs of preparation is a consideration as to prejudice without an application
of the rule. Lastly, to the extent that Defendant argues it is “preparing its
summary judgment motion,” (Opp. p. 12:15-16), that does not necessarily mean
Defendant has written its summary judgment motion. (Plus, the court had
not yet issued its ruling on the discovery motion above such that writing a
motion that turns on evidence would be premature.)
 


[13] The other theory
is predicated upon alleged medical discrimination.
