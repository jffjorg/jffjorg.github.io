SUMMARY OF ACTION AND ANALYSIS
This is unlawful detainer action filed by Plaintiff
Shirley Uy (Plaintiff) on February 23, 2024, against Defendants Antonio and
Falisha Jackson (Defendants). Plaintiff has alleged that the past due rent on
the property is $35,700.00.
 
On March 11, 2024, Defendants filed a demurrer to
Plaintiff’s entire complaint in pro per. Defendants demurred to the complaint
on the basis that Plaintiff did not verify the complaint pursuant to CCP §
1166(a)(1). However, as far as the Court can tell based on the copy of the
complaint filed with the Court, Plaintiff did verify the complaint at the
bottom of page 4 of the complaint. The complaint is also signed by Plaintiff’s
attorney. It is unclear, based on this, why Defendants have demurred to the
complaint on this basis.
 
Defendants’ demurrer to the entire complaint is overruled.
 
Moving party to give notice.
