And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

"The court has ruled on the demurrer filed by the defendants, Antonio Jackson and Falisha Jackson, to the entire complaint filed by the plaintiff, Shirley Uy. The defendants' demurrer was based on the alleged failure of the plaintiff to verify the complaint, as required by CCP ยง 1166(a)(1). However, the court found that the complaint was indeed verified at the bottom of page 4 and signed by the plaintiff's attorney. Therefore, the court has overruled the demurrer and the case will proceed. The moving party is ordered to give notice of the ruling."
