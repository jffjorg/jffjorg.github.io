Summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is regarding a demurrer to a cross-complaint filed by Anthony Martinez against Montebello Unified School District. The court has sustained the demurrer with leave to amend, requiring Martinez to file and serve a first amended cross-complaint within 30 days of notice of the ruling. The court has also overruled the demurrer to the eighth cause of action, which alleges a violation of Education Code § 220.

The court has determined that the plaintiff, Walther Medina, has sufficiently alleged vicarious liability against Montebello Unified School District for the actions of defendant Martinez, who was the superintendent and chief of police of the school district. The court has also determined that the demurrer to the third and fourth causes of action, which allege gender violence and Unruh Act violations, is sustained without leave to amend, meaning the claims cannot be remedied by amendment.

The court has ordered Montebello Unified School District to file and serve an answer to the second amended complaint within 30 days of notice of the ruling. The parties may submit on the tentative ruling by emailing the courtroom before 8:30 am on the day of the hearing.
