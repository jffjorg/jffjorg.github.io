And here is the English text summary:

The Court has reviewed the petition filed by Petitioner Sheryl Tan on behalf of Claimant Imogen Tan-Ching, who is 10 years old. The Court denies the petition without prejudice due to several reasons. Firstly, Petitioner failed to provide a medical report or records demonstrating Claimant's full recovery from asbestos exposure. Secondly, Petitioner did not explain the $5,000 apportionment to Claimant. Thirdly, the petition contradicts the $112.40 in medical liens and unclear medical expenses. Furthermore, Petitioner's request for $2,385.52 in attorney fees is unreasonable and not supported by the declaration. The Court also notes that Petitioner's counsel represents other parties in the matter. Finally, the Court orders Petitioner to revise the petition to include a guardian ad litem and provide clear medical expenses and attorney fees.
