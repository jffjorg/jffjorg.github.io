RULING

HEARING DATE:


April
  17, 2024




CASE NUMBER:


21STCV03346




MOTIONS:  


Motion
  to Deem the Truth of Matters 




MOVING PARTY:


Defendant Levons Edgars Isajans  




OPPOSING PARTY:


Unopposed



 
 
BACKGROUND
 
            Defendant Levons Edgars Isajans (Defendant)
moves to deem admitted matters in the Requests for Admissions, Set One served
on Plaintiff Daniel Cedillos (Plaintiff, in pro per). Defendant also seeks
monetary sanctions. No opposition has been filed. 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
Where
there has been no timely response to a request for admission under Code of
Civil Procedure section 2033.010, the propounding party may move for an order
that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in
the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction. 
(Code of Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).)  The party who failed to
respond waives any objections to the demand, unless the court grants that party
relief from the waiver, upon a showing that the party (1) has subsequently
served a substantially compliant response, and (2) that the party’s failure to
respond was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
(Code of Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subds. (a)(1)-(2).)  The court “shall”
grant a motion to deem admitted requests for admissions, “unless it finds that
the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has served,
before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests for
admission that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (Code
of Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).) 
 
The
Discovery Act does not define “substantial compliance” in the context of
service of a proposed response that complies with Code Civ. Proc., section
2033.220. The courts have ruled that “substantial compliance” means actual
compliance with all matters of substance and that technical deviations are not
to be given the stature of noncompliance. (St. Mary v. Superior Court (2014)
223 Cal.App.4th 762, 779.) For example, unverified responses are not in
substantial compliance. (Appleton v. Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 632,
636.) Additionally, RFA responses must be examined in their entirety. (St. Mary
v. Superior Court (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 762, 780.) 
 
Unverified
discovery responses are tantamount to no response at all, and are subject to a
motion to compel responses (rather than a motion to compel further responses).¿
(Appleton v. Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal. App. 3d 632, 635-36.)¿
However, objections to discovery responses do not require a verification. (See Food 4 Less Supermarkets, Inc. v. Superior Court (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 651, 656.) 
 
Where
a party fails to provide a timely response to requests for admission, “[i]t is mandatory
that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a
timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)
 
DISCUSSION
 
On July 24, 2023, the Court granted Plaintiff’s then-counsel’s motion
to be relieved. Plaintiff is currently self-represented. 
 
Here, Defendant asserts that he electronically served Requests for
Admissions, Set One on Plaintiff on January 18, 2024. (Clark Decl. ¶ 2, Exh.
A.) The proof of service of the Request for Admissions shows it was also served
by mail. (See Exh. A.) The responses were due February 22, 2024. As of the date
of filing this motion, no responses have been served. (Id. ¶ 3.) 
 
However, the address in the proof of service of the discovery and this
motion, do not match the address for Plaintiff provided in the Order Granting
Attorney’s Motion to be Relieved. (Order, 7/24/23.) Code of Civil Procedure section 1005
requires “written notice” of a motion including the date, time and location of
the hearing on a motion. A moving party’s failure to serve the notice of motion
and moving papers on a non-moving party violates the basic principles of
procedural due process under the federal and state constitutions – notice and
an opportunity to be heard.¿ (Logan v. Zimmerman Brush Co. (1982) 455
U.S. 422, 428 [minimum due process requires notice and opportunity for hearing
appropriate to the nature of the case]; Horn v. County of Ventura (1979)
24 Cal.3d 605, 612 [due process principles require reasonable notice and
opportunity to be heard].)
 
Based on the face of the proof of service, it does not appear
Plaintiff has received notice of the discovery request or this motion.
Therefore, the motion to deem the truth of matters in Defendant’s Request for
Admissions, is denied as procedurally defective. The Court accordingly denies
the request for monetary sanctions. To the extent Defendant argues that he also
provided electronic notice, there is no evidence that Plaintiff has
affirmatively consented to electronic service. (See Cal. R. Ct. 2.251; Code Civ. Proc. §
1010.6(c).)
 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
 
Accordingly, Defendant’s Motion to deem the truth of matters in
Request for Admissions, Set One, is DENIED on procedural grounds.  
 
Defendant
shall provide notice of the Court’s order and file a proof of
service of such.
