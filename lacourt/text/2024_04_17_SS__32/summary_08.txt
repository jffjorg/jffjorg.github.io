And here is the English text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants Defendant Michelle D. Minott's motion to compel Plaintiff Alejandro Hernandez Ignacio's deposition. The motion was filed on September 14, 2023, and Plaintiff failed to appear for the deposition on October 16, 2023. Defendant obtained a certificate of non-appearance and served notice of the motion on Plaintiff by mail. Since Plaintiff did not object to the deposition, the motion is granted. Defendant requests $860 in monetary sanctions, but the Court declines to award sanctions since Defendant did not meet and confer prior to bringing the motion. The Court orders Plaintiff to appear for a deposition within 15 days' notice of this order, accounting for extra time under Code of Civil Procedure section 1013 if applicable.
