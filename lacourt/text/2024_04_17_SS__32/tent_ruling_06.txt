Petition
  for Minors Compromise

OPPOSING PARTY:


Unopposed
  



 
 
The Court has reviewed the petition
filed on February 29, 2024 by Petitioner Sheryl Tan (Petitioner) on behalf of
Claimant Imogen Tan-Ching, age 10.
The Court denies the petition without prejudice for the following reasons: 
 
Petitioner asserts Claimant is fully recovered after
receiving a consultation for exposure to asbestos. Petitioner must provide a
medical report, records, or other evidence in attachment 8, demonstrating that
Claimant is fully recovered.  
 
In attachment 11b(3) and 11b(6), Petitioner states that
out of the $67.689.00 settlement to Plaintiffs Peter Ching, Sheryl Tan, and
Claimant, Claimant will receive $5,000. Petitioner must explain the reason for
the $5,000 apportionment to Claimant in attachment 11b(6). 
 
In item 12a(4), Petitioner states that $0 in medical
expenses is sought to be reimbursed. However, this in contradicted by the
$112.40 in medical liens shown in 12b(2) and 12b(5). It is also unclear whether
Petitioner is seeking reimbursement to a private health insurance or directly
to the provider Meritain Health. Additionally, in 12b(5)(b), it is unclear why
$112.40 is sought, given the $130 in medical expenses and no indication of a
reduction. 
 
Petitioner requests $2,385.52 in attorney fees which
represents 47.7% of the gross settlement. The Court finds this amount is
unreasonable and not supported by the attachment 13a declaration separately
filed on April 10, 2024. Based on item 13b, it appears Petitioner actually
seeks $2,000 in attorney fees, which represents 40% of the gross settlement. If
this is correct, the Court still finds this amount is not supported by the
declaration. Also, the amount of fees and costs stated in the declaration does
not match the amount in the petition. In a future petition, Petitioner must
only put the value for attorney fees in item 13a and include the remaining
expenses ($385.52) in 13b. Also, attachment 13a and the fee agreement must be
attached to the petition.  
 
It appears Petitioner’s counsel is representing other
parties in this matter. The response in item 17e must be changed and the applicable
attachment must be provided. 
 
 
In the proposed Order (MC-351), Petitioner must also mark
“guardian ad litem” in item 2. The gross amount ($5,000) must be in item 6. The
other expenses in item 8a(4), totaling $385.52, must be placed in item 8a(2),
instead. 
 
Accordingly, the Court denies the petition without
prejudice.
 
Petitioner shall give notice and file a
proof of service of such.
