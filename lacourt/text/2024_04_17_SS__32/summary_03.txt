Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has denied the motion to relieve counsel, Nathan S. Miller, from representing plaintiff Esmeralda Espinoza due to diminished attorney-client communication. Counsel failed to provide sufficient proof of service, listed the incorrect Court address on the moving papers, and did not complete item 1 of the MC-051 form. The Court finds that counsel did not take reasonable steps to avoid reasonably foreseeable prejudice to the client's interests. The Court orders counsel to provide notice of the Court's ruling and file proofs of service of such.
