TENTATIVE
RULING
 



DEPT:


32




HEARING DATE:


April
  17, 2024




CASE NUMBER:


22STCV30841




MOTIONS:  


Motion
  to Compel Plaintiff’s Deposition




MOVING PARTY:


Defendant Michelle D. Minott 




OPPOSING PARTY:


None



 
 
BACKGROUND
 
            Defendant
Michelle D. Minott (“Defendant”) moves to compel Plaintiff Alejandro Hernandez
Ignacio’s (“Plaintiff” in pro per) deposition. No opposition has been filed. 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
“If, after service of a deposition notice, a party to the
action . . . , without having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410,
fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for
inspection any document . . . described in the deposition notice, the party
giving the notice may move for an order compelling the deponent’s attendance
and testimony, and the production for inspection of any document . . .
described in the deposition notice.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (a).) 
 
“A motion under subdivision (a) [above] shall comply with
both of the following: 
 
1. The motion
shall set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the production for
inspection of any document, electronically stored information, or tangible
thing described in the deposition notice. 
2. The motion
shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040,
or, when the deponent fails to attend the deposition and produce the documents,
electronically stored information, or things described in the deposition
notice, by a declaration stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent
to inquire about the nonappearance.” 
 
(Code Civ.
Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (b).) 
 
If a motion is granted, the court shall impose a monetary
sanction in favor of that party unless the court finds that the one subject to
the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances
make the sanction unjust. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2025.450 (g).)
 
MEET
AND CONFER
 
The Declaration of Denise A. Smith-Mars does not state that counsel attempted
to contact Plaintiff regarding the non-appearance. Therefore, the meet and
confer requirement has not been met. 
 
DISCUSSION
 
On July 25, 2023, the Court granted Plaintiff’s former counsel’s
motion to be relieved as counsel. Plaintiff is currently self-represented. 
 
Here, on September 14, 2023, Defendant mailed notice of Plaintiff’s
deposition, set for October 16, 2023. (Smith-Mars Decl. ¶ 2, Exh. A.) On the
date of the deposition, Plaintiff failed to appear, and Defendant obtained a
certificate of non-appearance. (Id. ¶ 3, Exh. B.) Notice of this motion was
served on Plaintiff by mail. Therefore, because it does not appear that
Plaintiff timely objected to the deposition, and does not oppose this motion,
the motion to compel is granted. 
 
Defendant requests $860 in monetary sanctions. However, the Court declines
to award sanctions since Defendant did not meet and confer prior to bringing
this motion. 
 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
 
Accordingly, Defendant’s
motion to compel Plaintiff’s deposition is GRANTED. Plaintiff Alejandro
Hernandez Ignacio shall appear within 15 days’ notice of this order for a deposition,
accounting for extra time under Code of Civil Procedure section 1013 if
applicable.
 
Defendant shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file a proof
of service of such.
