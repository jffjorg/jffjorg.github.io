The judge has denied the defendant's motions to compel responses to special interrogatories, request for production of documents, and supplemental production of documents as moot.

However, the defendant recently received verified responses to the discovery requests. The judge has granted the defendant's request for sanctions against the plaintiff and her counsel, ordering them to pay $530, jointly and severally, within 30 days of the order. The judge found that the plaintiff's counsel did not provide substantial justification for the failure to provide responses and that the circumstances do not make the imposition of sanctions unjust.

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Jocelyn Newman (Plaintiff) vs. the Defendant. The Defendant had served Special Interrogatories, Request for Production of Documents, and Supplemental Request for Production of Documents on the Plaintiff, but the Plaintiff failed to produce responses. The Defendant's motions to compel responses to these discovery requests are denied as moot, since the Plaintiff finally provided responses on September 7, 2023. However, the Court has granted the Defendant's request for sanctions against the Plaintiff and her counsel, Martin Stanley, in the amount of $530, to be paid within 30 days of the order. The Court found that the Plaintiff and her counsel did not provide substantial justification for their failure to respond to the discovery requests, and therefore imposed sanctions. The moving party is ordered to give notice of the ruling.
