And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling is a denial of the defendant's motions to compel responses to special interrogatories, request for production of documents, and supplemental production of documents, as they are now moot due to the receipt of responses on September 7, 2023. The ruling also grants the defendant's request for sanctions against the plaintiff and her counsel, ordering them to pay $530 within 30 days. The sanctions are imposed for failing to respond to discovery requests in a timely manner, despite being given notice and an opportunity to respond.
