## English Summary

The Judge has ruled that the Defendant's motions to compel the Plaintiff to answer discovery requests are **MOOT**, meaning they are no longer relevant because the Plaintiff eventually provided the answers. 

However, the Judge has also ruled that the Defendant is entitled to **sanctions** against both the Plaintiff and her attorney for failing to answer the discovery requests on time. The sanctions amount to $530.

The Judge found that the Plaintiff and her attorney did not have a valid reason for the delay in responding to the discovery requests.

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motions to compel responses to special interrogatories, request for production of documents, and supplemental production of documents as moot. The defendant had served these requests on March 9, 2023, and the plaintiff failed to provide responses by the deadline of April 10, 2023. However, the defendant recently received verified responses to the discovery requests. The judge has granted the defendant's request for sanctions against the plaintiff and her counsel, ordering them to pay $530, jointly and severally, within 30 days of the order. The judge found that the plaintiff's counsel did not provide substantial justification for the failure to provide responses and that the circumstances do not make the imposition of sanctions unjust.

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Jocelyn Newman (Plaintiff) vs. the Defendant. The Defendant had served Special Interrogatories, Request for Production of Documents, and Supplemental Request for Production of Documents on the Plaintiff, but the Plaintiff failed to produce responses. The Defendant's motions to compel responses to these discovery requests are denied as moot, since the Plaintiff finally provided responses on September 7, 2023. However, the Court has granted the Defendant's request for sanctions against the Plaintiff and her counsel, Martin Stanley, in the amount of $530, to be paid within 30 days of the order. The Court found that the Plaintiff and her counsel did not provide substantial justification for their failure to respond to the discovery requests, and therefore imposed sanctions. The moving party is ordered to give notice of the ruling.

**Summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling:**

The Judge's tentative ruling addresses the Defendant's motions to compel the Plaintiff, Jocelyn Newman, to provide responses to discovery requests (special interrogatories, request for production of documents, and supplemental request for production of documents). Since the Plaintiff provided the responses on September 7, 2023, after the motions were filed, the Judge denies the motions to compel as moot. However, the Judge grants the Defendant's request for sanctions against Plaintiff Jocelyn Newman and her counsel, Martin Stanley, for the initial failure to timely respond. The sanctions are set at $530, to be paid jointly and severally within 30 days, a reduced amount reflecting the simplicity of the motions. The moving party (Defendant) is ordered to give notice.

**Summary in English:**

The Judge denied the Defendant's motions to compel the Plaintiff to answer questions and provide documents because the Plaintiff finally provided those answers, making the motions unnecessary ("moot").  However, because the Plaintiff was very late in responding, and offered no good reason for the delay, the Judge granted the Defendant's request for monetary sanctions. The Plaintiff, Jocelyn Newman, and her lawyer, Martin Stanley, must jointly pay $530 to the Defendant within 30 days. The $530 represents $175/hour * 2 hours, and $180 for filing fees. The moving party (Defendant) must notify the other parties about the court order.
