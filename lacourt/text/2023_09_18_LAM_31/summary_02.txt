And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the plaintiff's motion for attorney fees in part, awarding $44,038.35 in attorney fees and $4,807.42 in costs to Strategic Legal Practices, APC (SLP). The plaintiff had requested $103,242.35 in attorney fees, but the court found that some of the requested fees were excessive or duplicative. The court also found that the plaintiff's requested costs were reasonable, except for $61.65 in filing costs for a motion to compel that was never drafted or filed. The defendant had opposed the plaintiff's motion for attorney fees, arguing that the requested fees were excessive and that the plaintiff's costs should be taxed. However, the court found that the defendant's arguments were without merit, except for the issue of the filing costs. The court's decision is based on the Song-Beverly Act and the Code of Civil Procedure, and takes into account the reasonableness of the plaintiff's requested fees and costs.
