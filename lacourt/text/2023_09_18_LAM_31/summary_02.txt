And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the plaintiff's motion for attorney fees in part, awarding $44,038.35 in attorney fees and $4,807.42 in costs to Strategic Legal Practices, APC (SLP). The plaintiff had requested $103,242.35 in attorney fees, but the court found that some of the requested fees were excessive or duplicative. The court also found that the plaintiff's requested costs were reasonable, except for $61.65 in filing costs for a motion to compel that was never drafted or filed. The defendant had opposed the plaintiff's motion for attorney fees, arguing that the requested fees were excessive and that the plaintiff's costs should be taxed. However, the court found that the defendant's arguments were without merit, except for the issue of the filing costs. The court's decision is based on the Song-Beverly Act and the Code of Civil Procedure, and takes into account the reasonableness of the plaintiff's requested fees and costs.

**English Summary of the Tentative Ruling:**

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding the Plaintiff's motion for attorney's fees and costs. The Judge granted the motion in part, awarding $44,038.35 in attorney fees and $4,807.42 in costs. The Judge granted the request for judicial notice of 15 items. The judge found the hourly rates requested by the Plaintiff's attorneys to be reasonable, but reduced the total hours claimed due to some instances of excessive time spent on certain tasks and some duplicative work. The Court denied the plaintiff's request for a multiplier to increase the attorney's fees. The Judge also denied most of the Defendant's objections to the costs, but did reduce them slightly.

**English Text Summary of the Tentative Ruling:**

The Judge granted the Plaintiff's motion for attorney's fees in part. The Plaintiff, who won their "lemon law" case against HMA (likely Hyundai Motor America) after a settlement, requested over $103,000 in attorney's fees and costs.  The Judge reviewed the billing records and arguments from both sides.  The Judge found the hourly rates of the Plaintiff's attorneys (from the firm SLP) to be reasonable, but reduced the total number of hours awarded because some tasks were deemed excessive, duplicative, or insufficiently documented (like block billing issues, and time spent on an ex parte and later motion for the same relief). The Judge also disallowed some minor cost. The Judge specifically rejected the Plaintiff's request for a "multiplier" to increase the fee award, finding the case was not exceptionally complex and that the risk of contingency was already factored into the hourly rates.  The final award was $44,038.35 in attorney's fees and $4,807.42 in costs. The Defendant's arguments that costs could not be recovered for unsuccessful motions, or motions that weren't served, were generally rejected, except for one cost item that was never actually incurred.
