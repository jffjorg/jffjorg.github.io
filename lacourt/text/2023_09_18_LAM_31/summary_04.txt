## Summary in English

The Judge has reviewed the arguments presented by both Plaintiff and Defendants.

The Judge rules that Plaintiff's complaint sufficiently alleges facts supporting a claim of elder abuse against the hospital and its management. The Judge found that Plaintiff's allegations, including understaffing and improper training, go beyond simple negligence and demonstrate recklessness.  the Judge also found that Plaintiff adequately alleged authorization and ratification of the alleged abuse by Defendants' higher-ups.

Therefore, the Judge overrules the Defendants' demurrer and denies their motion to strike.

The court also finds that the plaintiff has sufficiently alleged authorization or ratification of the neglect by an officer, director, or managing agent of the defendant, which is required to establish a cause of action for elder abuse. Therefore, the court overrules the demurrer as to the first cause of action for elder abuse.

The defendant has also filed a motion to strike certain allegations in the complaint, arguing that they are irrelevant or untrue. The court denies this motion, finding that the allegations are relevant and supported by the evidence.

In conclusion, the court grants the plaintiff's motion for a tentative ruling and finds that the plaintiff has sufficiently stated a cause of action for elder abuse.

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of [Case Number: 22STCV25765], which was heard on September 18, 2023. The defendant, Kaiser Foundation Health Plan Inc., Kaiser Foundation Hospitals, and Southern California Permanente Medical Group, had demurred to the first amended complaint (FAC) and moved to strike certain allegations. The court has overruled the demurrer and denied the motion to strike.

The plaintiff had alleged a pattern of withholding portions or types of care, which the defendant argued did not amount to elder abuse. However, the court found that the plaintiff had sufficiently alleged recklessness and the authorization and ratification of the abuse by an officer, director, or managing agent, which is sufficient to state a cause of action for elder abuse.

The court also found that the plaintiff had sufficiently alleged malice for punitive damages, as the defendant had knowingly and deliberately failed to avoid the consequences of their conduct. The motion to strike was therefore denied.

The court's ruling is based on the applicable laws and case citations, including Welfare and Institutions Code section 15610.57 and Civil Code section 3294. The defendant is ordered to give notice of the ruling.

**English Text Summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling:**

The Judge's tentative ruling in Case Number 22STCV25765, scheduled for a hearing on September 18, 2023, overrules the demurrer filed by the defendants, Kaiser Foundation Health Plan Inc., Kaiser Foundation Hospitals, and Southern California Permanente Medical Group. The Judge also denies the defendants' motion to strike.

The Judge believes that the plaintiff has sufficiently alleged facts to support a cause of action for elder abuse, specifically regarding egregious misconduct and ratification by Kaiser's officers, directors, or managing agents. The court found that the plaintiff adequately pleaded a pattern of withholding care and allegations of understaffing and undertraining may be sufficient to arise to recklessness when there is a showing of a knowing pattern of violations of staffing regulations. The Judge also finds that the plaintiff has sufficiently alleged malice to pursue punitive damages. Therefore, both the demurrer and the motion to strike are denied. The moving party (presumably the Plaintiff) is ordered to give notice of this ruling.

English Text Summary:

This tentative ruling addresses a demurrer and motion to strike filed by the defendants (Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc., Kaiser Foundation Hospitals, and Southern California Permanente Medical Group) against the plaintiff's First Amended Complaint (FAC).  The judge *overrules* the demurrer, meaning the case can proceed on the elder abuse claim. The judge finds that the plaintiff has sufficiently alleged facts that could constitute "egregious misconduct" and has adequately pleaded that the actions were authorized or ratified by a managing agent of the defendant. The judge also *denies* the motion to strike, which means the plaintiff's request for punitive damages can remain in the complaint. The judge reasons that the allegations, if proven, could support a finding of recklessness, which is sufficient for punitive damages.  The moving party (likely the Defendant) must inform the other parties of the Court's ruling.
