## Summary in English

The Judge has reviewed the arguments presented by both Plaintiff and Defendants.

The Judge found that Plaintiff's allegations, including understaffing and improper training, go beyond simple negligence and demonstrate recklessness.  the Judge also found that Plaintiff adequately alleged authorization and ratification of the alleged abuse by Defendants' higher-ups.

Therefore, the Judge overrules the Defendants' demurrer and denies their motion to strike.

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of [Case Number: 22STCV25765], which was heard on September 18, 2023. The defendant, Kaiser Foundation Health Plan Inc., Kaiser Foundation Hospitals, and Southern California Permanente Medical Group, had demurred to the first amended complaint (FAC) and moved to strike certain allegations. The court has overruled the demurrer and denied the motion to strike.

The plaintiff had alleged a pattern of withholding portions or types of care, which the defendant argued did not amount to elder abuse. However, the court found that the plaintiff had sufficiently alleged recklessness and the authorization and ratification of the abuse by an officer, director, or managing agent, which is sufficient to state a cause of action for elder abuse.

The court also found that the plaintiff had sufficiently alleged malice for punitive damages, as the defendant had knowingly and deliberately failed to avoid the consequences of their conduct. The motion to strike was therefore denied.

The court's ruling is based on the applicable laws and case citations, including Welfare and Institutions Code section 15610.57 and Civil Code section 3294. The defendant is ordered to give notice of the ruling.
