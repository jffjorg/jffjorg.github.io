of documents, and supplemental production of documents are DENIED as

Legal Standard
 
Compel Interrogatories 
 
If a party to
whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely response, the
propounding party may move for an order compelling responses and for a monetary
sanction.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290,
subd. (b).) The statute contains no time limit for a motion to compel where no
responses have been served. All that need be shown in the moving papers is that
a set of interrogatories was properly served on the opposing party, that the
time to respond has expired, and that no response of any kind has been
served.  (Leach v. Superior Court
(1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902, 905–906.)
 
Compel RPDs 
 
Where there has been no timely response to a demand for the
production of documents, the demanding party may seek an order compelling a response. 
(Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.300(b).)  Failure to timely respond waives all
objections, including privilege and work product.  (Code Civ. Proc. §
2031.300(a).)  Thus, unless the party to whom the demand was directed
obtains relief from waiver, he or she cannot raise objections to the documents
demanded.  There is no deadline for a motion to compel responses. 
Likewise, for failure to respond, the moving party need not attempt to resolve
the matter outside court before filing the motion. 
 
A party may propound “a
supplemental demand” to inspect, copy, test, or sample any later
acquired or discovered documents, tangible things…. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.050.) 
 
Such supplemental demands may
be made 1)¿twice¿prior to initial setting of a trial
date, and 2) subject to the discovery “cut-off” date (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2024.010 et seq.), once¿after the
initial setting of a trial date. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2031.050(b),
2030.070(b).) For good cause shown, the court may allow a party to
propound¿additional¿supplemental demands for inspection. This allows for
updating of previously requested information. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2031.050(c),
2030.070(b).) 
 
Sanctions
 
Sanctions are mandatory in connection with a motion to compel
responses to interrogatories and requests for production of documents against
any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to
compel unless the court “finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.290(c), 2031.300(c).)
 
Discussion
On March 9, 2023, Defendant served Special
Interrogatories (Set Two), Request for Production of Documents (Set Two), and
Supplemental Request for Production of Documents (Set One), on Plaintiff.
(Weiss Decl., Exhs. A.) Responses were due on or before April 10, 2023. (Id.)
Plaintiff failed to produce responses on or by April 10, 2023 and did not
request an extension. (Weiss Decl. ¶
3.) On July 27, 2023, Defendant’s counsel emailed Plaintiff’s counsel inquiring
whether Plaintiff intended to provide responses to written discovery. (Id., ¶ 4, Exh. B.) Plaintiff's counsel did
not respond. (Id.) 
In Defendant’s notice of non-opposition,
Defendant informs the Court that responses to the discovery at issue were
received on September 7, 2023.
As such, as verified responses to the
request for discovery were provided, the motions to compel those responses are
moot, regardless of whether they are complete or not. 
As to sanctions, Plaintiff’s counsel has
not provided substantial justification for the failure to provide responses or
any other basis upon which an award of sanctions would be unjust. Nevertheless,
the Court will reduce the amount of sanctions awarded due to the simplicity of
the motions and nature of the concurrent facts. As such, the Court imposes
sanctions against Plaintiff Jocelyn Newman and counsel of record Martin Stanley
in the amount of $530 ($175 an hour for 2 hours, plus $180 in filing fees), jointly
and severally, to be paid within 30 days of this order. 
Conclusion
 
Accordingly,
Defendant’s motions to compel responses to special interrogatories, request for
production of documents, and supplemental production of documents are DENIED as
MOOT. 
 
Defendant’s request for sanctions is
GRANTED. Plaintiff Jocelyn Newman and counsel of record Martin Stanley
are ordered to pay monetary sanctions in the amount of $530, jointly and
severally, within 30 days of this order.
Moving party is ordered to give
notice.
