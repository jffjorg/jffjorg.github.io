And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting Said Hakim's motion for summary judgment in this case. The motion was based on the argument that Papillones' quiet title claim is barred by the statute of limitations. The judge found that Papillones had knowledge of its quiet title claim in 2013, 2015, and 2016, and therefore the claim is time-barred. The judge also rejected Papillones' arguments that the applicable statute of limitations is five years and that the continuous accrual doctrine applies. As a result, the judge has granted Said's motion for summary judgment and directed him to prepare, serve, and submit a proposed judgment as per statute.
