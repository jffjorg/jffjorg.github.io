And here is the summary in English text:

The court's tentative ruling grants Plaintiff Luis Edgardo Hurtado Majano's motion for leave to file a First Amended Complaint. The motion seeks to add a new cause of action for negligent entrustment of a motor vehicle. The court finds that the proposed amendment does not prejudice the defendant, Esvin Aroldo Vasquez, and that it provides specificity that will resolve any impediments to settlement and prevent unnecessary law and motion matters. The court notes that the delay in amending the complaint is minimal and that the proposed amendment arises from the same allegations as the initial complaint. The court also finds that the defendant's arguments that the proposed amendment prejudices him and is time-barred fail. Therefore, the court grants the motion and orders the plaintiff to file the proposed First Amended Complaint separately with the court forthwith.
