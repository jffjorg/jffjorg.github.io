And here is the summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion by Plaintiff Luis Edgardo Hurtado Majano to file a first amended complaint. The motion seeks to add a new cause of action for negligent entrustment of a motor vehicle. The court has granted the motion, finding that the proposed amendment provides specificity that will resolve any impediments to settlement and prevent unnecessary law and motion matters. The court notes that the proposed amendment does not assert a new cause of action, but rather adds additional detail and information that arises from the same allegation that Vasquez acted in a manner that negligently caused Hurtado Majano injury on March 12, 2021. The court also finds that the delay in amending the complaint is minimal and does not prejudice Defendant Vasquez. The court orders Hurtado Majano to file the proposed first amended complaint separately with the court forthwith.
