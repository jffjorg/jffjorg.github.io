TENTATIVE RULING 
 
 Defendant’s
motion to compel responses to requests for production and form and special
interrogatories is GRANTED.
 
BACKGROUND 
 
  This is a negligence and
premises liability case. The Complaint alleges that Plaintiff Jose G. Sanchez
(Plaintiff) was injured at a store owned by Defendants Albertsons Companies,
Inc. and Albertsons, LLC (Defendants) when a plastic bag dispenser he was using
detached and struck him in the right hand and forearm, resulting in injuries.
(Complaint ¶ 11.) 
 
On November 1, 2023, this court granted Yosi Yahoudai’s motion to be
relieved as counsel for Plaintiff. Plaintiff is now proceeding in pro per. 
 
Defendant filed and served the present motions to compel on December
28, 2023. No oppositions have been served. 
 
  
LEGAL STANDARD 
A propounding party may demand a responding party to produce documents
that are in their possession, custody or control. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.010.) A party may likewise conduct discovery by propounding
interrogatories to another party to be answered under oath. (Code Civ. Proc. §
2030.010, subd. (a).) The responding party must respond to the production
demand either by complying, by representing that the party lacks the ability to
comply, or by objecting to the demand. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.210.) The
responding party must respond to the interrogatories by answering or objecting.
(Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.210, subd. (a).) If the responding party fails to serve
timely responses, the propounding party may move for an order compelling
responses to the production demand and interrogatories. (Code Civ. Proc., §§
2030.290, 2031.300.) 
A party who fails to serve a
timely response to interrogatories or a demand for inspection waives any
objection to the demand. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, 2031.300.)
 
DISCUSSION 
 
1.     The Discovery
 
Defendant
Albertsons, LLC served requests for production and form and special
interrogatories upon Plaintiff on July 12, 2023, with responses due by November
8, 2023, per several extensions agreed to by the parties. (Galstyan Decl. ¶¶
3–8.) During the pendency of these responses, Plaintiff’s counsel sought and
was granted relief from the representation, in an order dated November 1,
2023.No responses have been given to date. (Galstyan Decl. ¶ 10.) 
 
As
no responses have been served, the motions to compel are GRANTED.
2.    
Sanctions
The
prevailing party on a motion to compel is generally entitled to monetary
sanctions, unless the court “finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2030.290, 2031.300.)
Defendant seeks $1,060.00 in
sanctions for each motion, representing four hours of attorney work at $250 per
hour, plus a $60 filing fee, for a total sanctions request of $3,180.00.
(Galstyan Decl. ¶ 11.) These sanctions requests include an estimated 2.5 hours
to prepare a reply to an opposition for each motion, when no such opposition
has been filed, and to attend hearing on each motion, which entails substantial
duplication of effort among the motions. When these 2.5 hour charges (totaling
7.5 hours and $1,875) are deducted, the maximum sanctions award is $1,305.00. 
Sanctions are therefore
awarded against Plaintiff in the amount of $1,305.00.  
The court notes
that Plaintiff was directed by the court to comply with Defendants request for discovery
on the last court date of March 6, 2024.
  
 
CONCLUSION 
 
The motions to compel are GRANTED. Sanctions are awarded against
Plaintiff in favor of Defendant Albertsons, LLC in the amount of $1,305.00.
 
            Moving Party to give notice.
