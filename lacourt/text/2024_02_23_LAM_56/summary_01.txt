And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is in response to Defendant Goldsilver LLC's motion for judgment on the pleadings. The Plaintiff, Miguel Esparza, alleges that the Defendant installed spyware to eavesdrop on his conversations and violated the California Invasion of Privacy Act. The Defendant argues that the Plaintiff's claims fail because the alleged conduct is not prohibited by the California Invasion of Privacy Act, and that the Plaintiff impliedly consented to any recording.

The Court finds that the Plaintiff fails to allege a claim under section 631(a) because the alleged conduct is not prohibited by the statute. The Court also finds that the Plaintiff fails to state a claim under section 632.7 because the alleged communication is not prohibited by the statute, and that the Plaintiff fails to allege how the Defendant received the messages sent via its chat feature.

The Court grants the motion for judgment on the pleadings and gives the Plaintiff 20 days to amend his complaint. The Court notes that if the Plaintiff is unable to overcome the deficiencies in his pleading in any first amended complaint, the Court will consider sustaining a demurrer thereto without leave to amend.
