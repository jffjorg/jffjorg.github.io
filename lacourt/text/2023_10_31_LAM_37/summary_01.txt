And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in response to a demurrer filed by Defendant 3585 Multiview, LLC, to the Plaintiffs' Complaint. The Plaintiffs, Lucy Broadbent, et al., allege that the Defendant's construction efforts on an up slope property caused mudslides and damages to their respective properties. The Complaint alleges three causes of action: Negligence, Nuisance, and Trespass.

The Judge has overruled the Defendant's demurrer to all three causes of action. The Judge found that the Plaintiffs' Complaint adequately pleads the elements of each cause of action and that the Defendant's demurrer fails to demonstrate any legal sufficiency of the pleading.

The Judge noted that the Defendant's demurrer relied on extrinsic evidence, which is improper on a demurrer. The Judge also found that the Plaintiffs' allegations of negligence, nuisance, and trespass are sufficient to state a cause of action and that the Defendant's conduct constitutes a breach of its legal duty to maintain its property with due regard for the safety and integrity of the Plaintiffs' properties.

The Judge's tentative ruling is subject to change after the hearing on October 31, 2023.
