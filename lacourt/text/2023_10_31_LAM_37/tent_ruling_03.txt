Background
 
On June 27, 2023, Avishai Kohanzad (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint
against Daftari Sion (“Defendant”) alleging three causes of action: (1) Premise
Liability; (2) Trespass; and (3) Private Nuisance. 
 
On August 15, 2023, Defendant filed an Answer and Motion to Strike.
On October 18, 2023, Plaintiff tried to file an amended Complaint, which was
rejected because an answer had already been filed. (See CCP § 472.)  No reply or opposition has been filed.

I.         Legal Standard
 
¿Any party, within the time allowed to respond to a pleading
may serve and file a notice of motion to strike the whole or any part thereof.
(CCP § 435(b)(1); CRC, rule 3.1322(b).) The court may, upon a motion or at any
time in its discretion and upon terms it deems proper: (1) strike out any
irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading; or (2) strike
out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the
laws of California, a court rule, or an order of the court. (CCP, § 436(a)-(b);
Stafford v. Shultz (1954) 42 Cal.2d 767, 782 [“Matter in a pleading
which is not essential to the claim is surplusage; probative facts are
surplusage and may be stricken out or disregarded”].)¿¿¿¿ 
 
“Where the defect raised by a motion to strike or by demurrer
is reasonably capable of cure, leave to amend is routinely and liberally
granted to give the plaintiff a chance to cure the defect in question.” (CLD
Construction, Inc. v. City of San Ramon (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 1141, 1146.)
The burden is on the complainant to show the Court that a pleading can be
amended successfully. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.)¿¿¿ 
 
II.        Discussion
 
Defendant
moves to strike the following portions from Plaintiff’s Complaint: 
 
1)    
The following portion of Paragraph 35
of the Complaint (6:20-21) – “Defendant’s water leak invasion was malicious in
that upon being notified by Plaintiff regarding the leak the Defendant did not
mitigate or remedy the problem.”;
 
2)    
Paragraph 2 of the Prayer as to the
second cause of action (7:5) in its entirety – “For exemplary or punitive
damages”;
 
3)    
Paragraph 3 of the Prayer as to the
third cause of action (7:9) in its entirety – “For exemplary or punitive
damages”.
 
Defendant
argues that Plaintiff’s Complaint fails to state sufficient facts to support a
claim for punitive damages. To state a claim for punitive damages under Civil Code § 3294,
a plaintiff must allege specific facts showing that the defendant has been
guilty of malice, oppression, or fraud. (Smith v. Superior Court (1992)
10 Cal. App. 4th 1033, 1042.)¿ The basis for punitive damages must be pled with
specificity; conclusory allegations devoid of any factual assertions are
insufficient. (Id.) 
 
The
Complaint alleges that the Defendant(s) engaged in a fraudulent conspiracy to
financially benefit at the expense of Plaintiff.  The Complaint fails, however, to allege facts
as to how the renovations to the upstairs unit and water leak were fraudulent
activities aimed at defrauding Plaintiff. (Complaint, ¶ 7.)
 
Plaintiff
also alleges that the “water leak invasion was malicious” because Defendant was
aware of the leak and did not mitigate or remedy the problem.  (Complaint, ¶ 35.) “Mere negligence, even
gross negligence, is not sufficient to justify such an award” for punitive
damages. (Kendall Yacht Corp. v. United California Bank (1975) 50
Cal.App.3d 949,958.) Plaintiff’s conclusory assertion that the leak was
malicious, without supporting facts, is insufficient to support a claim for
punitive damages. Plaintiff must allege that Defendant acted with the intent to
cause Plaintiff injury or with a conscious disregard for the rights or safety
of Plaintiff. (Civ. Code § 3294(a).) 
 
Defendant’s
Motion is granted with leave to amend. 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant’s motion to strike is granted
with leave to amend. Plaintiff
is granted 30 days leave to 
amend from this date.  The
court sets an OSC re Amended Complaint for December 11, 2023, at 
8:30 a.m.  Defendant to give
notice.
