Background
 
On May 17, 2023, Lucy Broadbent; David Norland; Steven, Shirley,
and Eriq Quat; Julia Ganis; Scott Leslie; Denise and Jeff Turzo; Pouri Fox and
Brandon Fox, and Anthony Ivanich (collectively “Plaintiffs”) filed a Complaint
against 3585 Multiview, LLC (“Defendant”) and Does 1 to 50. 
 
Plaintiffs allege that Defendant’s construction efforts on an
upslope property caused mudslides and damages to Plaintiffs’ respective
properties. The Complaint alleges three causes of action: (1) Negligence; (2)
Nuisance; and (3) Trespass. 
 
On July 20, 2023, Defendant filed a demurrer to Plaintiffs’
Complaint. On October 16, 2023, Plaintiffs filed opposing papers. Defendant
filed a reply on October 25, 2023. The matter is now before the court.
 
 
Demurrer[1]
 
I.         Legal Standard
 
Where pleadings are defective, a party may raise the defect
by way of a demurrer. (Coyne v. Krempels (1950) 36 Cal.2d 257, 262.) A
demurrer tests the sufficiency of a pleading, and the grounds for a demurrer
must appear on the face of the pleading or from judicially noticeable matters.¿
(CCP, § 430.30(a); Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) In
evaluating a demurrer, the court accepts the complainant’s properly pled facts
as true and ignores contentions, deductions, and conclusory statements. (Daar
v. Yellow Cab Co. (1976) 67 Cal.2d 695, 713; Serrano v. Priest (1971)
5 Cal.3d 584, 591.) Moreover, the court does not consider whether a plaintiff
will be able to prove the allegations or the possible difficulty in making such
proof. (Fisher v. San Pedro Peninsula Hospital (1989) 214 Cal.App.3d
590, 604.) 
Leave to amend must be allowed
where there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman v.
Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.)¿ The burden is on the complainant to
show the Court that a pleading can be amended successfully. (Id.)
 
II.        Discussion 
 
Defendant alleges that the
Complaint fails to state sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action
against Defendant and that the mudslide was not caused by Defendant’s actions.
 
A.        First Cause of Action – Negligence
“The elements of a cause of action for negligence
are well established. They are (a) a legal duty to use due care; (b) a breach
of such legal duty; [and] (c) the breach as the proximate or legal cause of the
resulting injury.” (Ladd v. County of San Mateo (1996) 12 Cal.4th 913,
917 [internal quotations omitted].) “A duty may arise through statute,
contract, or the relationship of the parties.” (Lichtman v. Siemens Industry
Inc. (2017) 16 Cal.App.5th 914, 920 [internal quotations and citations
omitted].) The existence of a legal duty is a question of law for the court to
decide. (Adams v. City of Fremont (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 243, 265.) “However, the elements of breach
of that duty and causation are ordinarily questions of fact for the jury's
determination.” (Vasquez v. Residential Investments, Inc. (2004) 118
Cal.App.4th 269, 278.)
The Complaint alleges
that Plaintiffs’ various respective properties were located downslope of
Defendant’s property on Fredonia Drive. (Complaint, ¶¶ 1-11.) Defendant had a
duty to maintain its property with due regard for the safety and integrity of
Plaintiffs’ properties and personal items. (Complaint, ¶ 22.) Defendant’s
construction and piles of dirt were maintained in such a manner as to create
mudslides on or about December 23, 2022, and January 10, 2023, which damaged
the Plaintiffs’ respective properties and the physical structures, including
loss of use and value of Plaintiffs’ properties, damage or destruction to the
safety and marketability of Plaintiffs’ properties, and damage or destruction
to Plaintiffs’ personal items. (Complaint, ¶¶ 21, 24, 26.) Specifically,
Defendant’s construction resulted in “multiple unsupported cuts into the
hillside” and “left
large quantities of untended excavated earth with no place to go but downhill”
with the only barrier being “a makeshift thin plywood fence” that was “wholly
inadequate” to prevent a mudslide. (Complaint, ¶¶
10-12.)
Defendant asserts its
property was not the cause of the mudslide or landslide.  Moreover, if there was irreparable damage to
Plaintiffs’ respective properties, the building and safety department would
have informed Defendant, and that the “City remedied the dirty and muddy
streets by cleaning said streets.” (Dela Cruz Decl. ¶¶ 9, 20, 23.) “[I]n ruling on a demurrer the
trial court is bound by the facts as alleged in the pleading against which the
demurrer is directed, and it may not consider evidentiary facts presented to it
through the medium of an affidavit.” (O’Keefe v. Atascadero County
Sanitation Dist. (1971) 21 Cal.App.3d 719, 730.) 
Here, Defendant demurs to the first cause of action on the
basis that Defendant’s property did not create mudslides/landslide and refers
to extrinsic evidence which is improper on a demurrer because there is no
pleading defect that appears on the face of the Complaint or is subject to
judicial notice. (See CCP §§ 430.30, 430.70.) Whether Defendant’s conduct
caused the mudslides remains a disputed fact not subject to resolution on a
demurrer. "On a demurrer a court's function is limited to testing the
legal sufficiency of the complaint. [Citation.] ‘A demurrer is simply not the
appropriate procedure for determining the truth of disputed facts.’ [Citation.]”
(Fremont Indemnity Co. v. Fremont General Corp. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th
97, 113-114.)
Furthermore, on a demurrer, the Plaintiffs’ properly pled
allegations are taken as true, and Plaintiffs are not required to prove the
allegations at the pleading stage. (See Stevens v. Superior Court
(1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 605, 609–610 [“For purposes of a general demurrer to a
complaint, all material fact allegations must be taken as true. Whether the
plaintiff will be able to prove the pleaded facts is irrelevant to ruling upon
the demurrer.”].)
As Defendant fails to show how Plaintiffs’ first
cause of action is improperly pled, the demurrer to the first cause of action
is overruled. 
B.        Second
Cause of Action – Nuisance
 
CCP
§ 3479 defines nuisance as “[a]nything which is injurious to
health, including . .
. , indecent or offensive to the senses, or an obstruction to the free
use of property, so as to interfere with the comfortable enjoyment of life or
property, or unlawfully obstructs the free passage or use[.]” “A public
nuisance is one which affects at the same time an entire community or
neighborhood, or any considerable number of persons, although the extent of the
annoyance or damage inflicted upon individuals may be unequal.” (Civ. Code §
3480.) 
 
“The interference must be both
substantial and unreasonable.” (Melton v. Boustred
(2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 521, 542.) “Public nuisance liability ‘does not hinge on
whether the defendant owns, possesses or controls the property, nor on whether
he is in a position to abate the nuisance; the critical question is whether the
defendant created or assisted in the creation of the nuisance.’” (Id. at p. 542 citing City of Modesto Redevelopment Agency v. Superior Court
(2004) 119 Cal.App.4th 28, 38; see also County of Santa Clara v.
Atlantic Richfield Co. (2006) 137 Cal.App.4th
292, 306 [accord].)
The Complaint alleges that Defendant’s
property and the drainage above it constitute a nuisance and proximately caused
damage to Plaintiffs’ properties due to Defendant’s “maintenance of the
unstable slope and pails of sail, their failure to maintain proper drainage,
and their failure to properly support the Defendant’s Multiview Property.”
(Complaint, ¶ 29.) Defendant’s failure to act posed an unreasonable hazard to
Plaintiffs’ properties and obstructed the free use and enjoyment of said
Properties. (Complaint, ¶ 31.) 
 
Defendant again asserts that “Defendant
Multiview did not create the weather condition that caused the mudslide or
landslide” and that on February 1, 2023, after the first two mudslides
occurred, Defendant adhered to the City’s advice to build a wall. (Demurrer at
p. 10:7-17.) Whether Defendant is liable for the mudslide remains a disputed
issue of fact. Whether the City cleaned the streets after the mudslide does not
make the nuisance claim moot, as the Complaint properly alleges that the Plaintiffs’
properties were damaged and Defendant’s contractors did not adequately clean up
the mess (Complaint, ¶¶ 17, 19.)
 
As Defendant failed to show that
Plaintiffs’ second cause of action is inadequately pled, the demurrer to the
second cause of action is overruled. 
 
C.        Third
Cause of Action – Trespass
 
“The
elements of trespass are: (1) the plaintiff's ownership or control of the
property; (2) the defendant's intentional, reckless, or negligent entry onto
the property; (3) lack of permission for the entry or acts in excess of
permission; (4) harm; and (5) the defendant's conduct was a substantial factor
in causing the harm.” (Ralphs Grocery Co. v. Victory Consultants, Inc.
(2017) 17 Cal.App.5th 245, 262.)   
 
Defendant
argues that the third cause of action fails because Defendant did not trespass
onto the property or create or engage in conduct that damaged the Plaintiffs’
respective properties. Plaintiffs argue that the trespass focuses on unlawful
interference with possession of property and that the mudslides onto their
properties satisfy the element of unlawful entry. (See Ralphs Grocery, supra,
17 Cal.App.5th at pp. 261-262 [“Trespass is the unlawful interference with
possession of property.”] [internal citations and quotations omitted].)
Plaintiffs correctly point out that in Armitage v. Decker (1990) 218
Cal.App.3d 887, the plaintiff was able to assert a claim for trespass due to
the defendant’s disposing of dirt and gravel onto the plaintiff’s property. (Id.
at p. 906; see also Staples v. Hoefke (1987) 189
Cal.App.3d 1397, 1406 [“The emission of sound waves which cause actual physical damage to property constitutes a trespass.”].) Thus, the fact that the
Complaint alleges that mud from Defendant’s property wrongfully entered the
Plaintiffs’ respective properties is sufficient to meet the element of wrongful
entry. 
 
As
to Defendant’s contention that it is not liable for the damage to the
Plaintiffs’ properties, this remains a disputed fact and is not a proper basis
for a demurrer. Therefore, the demurrer to the third cause of action is
overruled. 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant’s demurrer to
Plaintiffs’ Complaint is overruled in its entirety.
