And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge, Teresa A. Beaudet, discloses that she and her husband purchased a pickup truck approximately 24 years ago. The truck developed electrical problems and was eventually taken back and refunded by the manufacturer and dealer. The judge does not believe that her experience will cause her to be biased for or against either party. However, she notes that if parties believe that her experience will cause bias, they may file and serve a verified statement of disqualification per CCP 170.3(c)(1) within 14 days of service. The hearing on the status conference re completion of mediation or other form of ADR is continued to July 11, 2024, unless both parties waive the right to file the statement. The plaintiff is ordered to give notice of this disclosure to any new parties who are added to the case.
