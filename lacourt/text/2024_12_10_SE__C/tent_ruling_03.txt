NEWMATERIAL TECHNOLOGY, LTD v. E SOLUTIONS
CASE NO.: 23NWCV01546
HEARING:  December 10,

JUDGE: Raul A. Sahagun
 
#5
TENTATIVE ORDER
 
Plaintiff’s Motion to
Amend Judgment is DENIED.
 
Plaintiff to give
notice. 
 
Background
 
This is a breach of contract and debt collection action. On
May 18, 2023, Plaintiff Changya Newmaterial Technology, LTD. (“Plaintiff”)
filed this action against E Solutions and Does 1 to 10 (“E Solutions”). The
Complaint alleges E Solutions buys goods from Plaintiff. E Solutions allegedly
failed to pay for goods and owes Plaintiff in the amount of $173,780.72. The
Complaint alleges the following four causes of action: 1) Breach of Contract,
2) Account Stated (Invoices and Goods Ordered), 3) Implied Contract (Goods
Ordered), and 4) Implied Contract (Packaging Materials). 
 
Default was entered against E Solutions on July 25, 2023. On
October 17, 2023, default judgment was entered against E Solutions in the
amount of $204,540.45. (See 10/17/23 Judgment.)
 
On January 19, 2024, Plaintiff obtained a Writ of Execution
against E Solutions.
 
Plaintiff now moves to amend the default judgment to include
an additional defendant under Code of Civil Procedure section 187. Plaintiff
seeks to collect the judgment against Elias B Escobar Lupercio (“Lupercio”),
who is doing business as (dba) E Solutions, because there is no separate legal
entity. The motion is unopposed.
 
Legal Standard 
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 187 states the following: “When
jurisdiction is, by the Constitution or this Code, or by any other statute,
conferred on a Court or judicial officer, all the means necessary to carry it
into effect are also given; and in the exercise of this jurisdiction, if the
course of proceeding be not specifically pointed out by this Code or the
statute, any suitable process or mode of proceeding may be adopted which may
appear most conformable to the spirit of this Code.” 
 
Under Code of Civil Procedure section 187, a judge may amend
a judgement to add additional judgment debtors. (Butler America, LLC v.
Aviation Assurance Company, LLC (2020) 55 Cal.App.5th 136, 145.) “The
decision to grant an amendment in such circumstances lies in the sound
discretion of the trial court. ‘The greatest liberality is to be encouraged in
the allowance of such amendments in order to see that justice is done.’
[Citations.]” (Greenspan v. LADT, LLC (2010) 191 Cal.App.4th 486, 508.)
 
Discussion
 
The Court finds it has no personal jurisdiction over
Lupercio because there is no proof of service indicating Plaintiffs personally
served Lupercio with the Summons and Complaint. Lupercio is not a defendant in
this action. Because the Court lacks personal jurisdiction over Lupercio, the
Court may not amend the judgment to add Lupercio as a defendant or judgment
debtor.
 
The Court thus denies Plaintiff’s Motion to Amend Judgment.
