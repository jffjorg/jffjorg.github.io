TENTATIVE ORDER
 
Defendant Zhai’s
Motion to Set Aside Entry of Default is GRANTED.
 
Defendant Zhai to
give notice. 
 
Background
 
This is a medical malpractice action. On March 16, 2023,
Plaintiff Ornella Gomez-Dellepiane (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against
Defendants Kaiser Permanente, Jing Zhai C.N.M., and Does 1 to 20. The Complaint
alleges Zhai incorrectly placed an intrauterine device into Plaintiff’s
abdomen, causing serious pain and eventually requiring her to get it surgically
removed. The Complaint alleges one cause of action for medical malpractice. 
 
On October 11, 2023, Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc. as
Doe 1.
 
On October 6, 2023, default was entered against Defendant Zhai.

 
Defendant Zhai now moves to set aside entry of default,
asserting that Plaintiff failed to effectuate service of process via
substituted service. The Motion is unopposed.
 
Legal Standard
 
“The court may, upon motion of the injured party, or its own
motion, correct clerical mistakes in its judgment or orders as entered, so as
to conform to the judgment or order directed, and may, on motion of either
party after notice to the other party, set aside any void judgment or order.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (d).) 
 
A motion to vacate a default and set aside a judgment is
within the discretion of the trial court. (Strathvale Holdings v. E.B.H. (2005)
126 Cal.App.4th 1241, 1249.) “Lack of personal jurisdiction renders a judgment
(or default) void, and the default may be directly challenged at any time.” (Id.
at p. 1250.) “When a defendant challenges the court’s personal jurisdiction,
the plaintiff has the initial burden of demonstrating facts justifying the
exercise of jurisdiction.” (Ibid.) “‘A summons is the process by which a
court acquires personal jurisdiction over a defendant in a civil action’
[citation], and a defendant has an absolute right to demand that process be
issued against him in a manner prescribed by law.” (Mannesmann DeMag, Ltd.
v. Superior Court¿(1985) 172 Cal.App.3d 1118, 1122.)¿“As a general rule,
however, the provisions of the rules governing service of process are to be
liberally construed.” (Ibid.)  
 
“A plaintiff may serve individual defendants through
substitute service when they cannot be personally served with reasonable
diligence.” (Rodriguez v. Cho (2015) 236 Cal.App.4th 742, 750.) Substituted
service is governed by Code of Civil Procedure section 415.20, subdivision (b),
which states the following: “If a copy of the summons and complaint cannot with
reasonable diligence be personally delivered to the person to be served. . .a
summons may be served by leaving a copy of  the summons and complaint at
the person’s dwelling house, usual place of abode, usual business, or usual
mailing address other than a United States Postal Service post office box, in
the presence of a competent member of the household or a person apparently in
charge of his or her office, place of business, or usual mailing address other
than a United States Postal Service post office box, at least 18 years of age,
who shall be informed of the contents thereof, and by thereafter mailing a copy
of the summons and complaint by first-class mail, postage prepaid to the person
to be served at the place where a copy of the summons and complaint were left.”

 
“[T]he filing of a proof of service creates a rebuttable
presumption that . . . service was proper.” (Dill v. Berquist Construction
Co. (1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 1426, 1441.) “[A] registered process
server’s declaration establishes a presumption affecting the burden of
producing evidence of the facts stated in the declaration.” (American
Express Centurion Bank v. Zara (2011) 199 Cal.App.4th 383, 390.)
 
Discussion
 
Plaintiff filed the Proof of Service of Summons (POS) on
July 18, 2023. The POS states that Defendant Zhai was served via substituted
service at her place of business. (POS, ¶ 5.) The attached Declaration of
Diligence states that the first attempt of service, on April 20, 2023, was at
10820 183rd St, Cerritos, CA 90703 (“Cerritos Medical Offices”), where an
unnamed employee told the server that documents must go to 9400 Rosecrans Ave,
Bellflower, CA 90706 (“Bellflower Medical Offices”). (Decl. Due Diligence, ¶
2.)  At the second attempt, on April 21,
2023, no one was authorized to accept service at the Bellflower Office. (Ibid.)
At the third attempt, on April 24, 2023, Anna Munos was served as a person
authorized to accept on behalf of Defendant Jing. (Ibid.) Proof of
mailing was also attached. 
 
Defendant Zhai argues entry of default should be set aside
where substituted service was not properly effectuated. Defendant Zhai declares
that the Bellflower Medical Offices was not her usual place of business. (Zhai
Decl., ¶ 5.) Defendant Zhai declares that from March 15, 2022 to present, the
Cerritos Medical Office has been her usual place of business. (Zhai Decl., ¶
4.) Counsel for Defendant Kaiser Permanente Foundation Health Plan, Inc. was
assigned in November 2023. (Rector Decl., ¶ 3.) Defendant Zhai declares she was
not aware anyone was trying to serve her with documents at the Cerritos Medical
Offices or any other location. (Zhai Decl., ¶ 7.)
 
Upon reviewing the record, counsel discovered Plaintiff
entered default against Defendant Zhai, and provided her with copies of the
service documents. (Zhai Decl., ¶¶ 6, 8.) Subsequently representing Defendant
Zhai, counsel met and conferred with Plaintiff’s counsel in an attempt to set
aside the default entered, but no resolution was met. (Rector Decl., ¶ 4.)
 
The Court finds that Plaintiff was not properly served via
substituted service. Defendant Zhai has declared that the Bellflower Medical
Offices is not her usual place of business and that she was never made aware of
such lawsuit until counsel contacted her. (Zhai Decl., ¶¶ 5-8.) The trial court
has a large amount of discretion to set aside a default judgment. (Benjamin
v. Dalmo Mfg. Co. (1948) 31 Cal.2d 523, 525.) Courts favor “orders excusing
defaults and permitting controversies to be heard upon their merits.” (Ibid.)  
 
The Court therefore exercises its discretion and GRANTS Defendant
Zhai’s Motion to Set Aside Entry of Default.
