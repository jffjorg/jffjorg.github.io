And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge, Raul A. Sahagun, has issued a tentative ruling on a motion by the plaintiff, NEWMATERIAL TECHNOLOGY, LTD, to amend a default judgment against E SOLUTIONS. The plaintiff seeks to add Elias B Escobar Lupercio, who is doing business as E SOLUTIONS, as a defendant or judgment debtor. However, the Judge has denied the motion because there is no proof of personal service of the Summons and Complaint on Lupercio, and therefore the Court lacks personal jurisdiction over him. The Judge cites California Code of Civil Procedure section 187 and relevant case law to support the decision. The ruling is tentative and will be finalized after a hearing on December 10, 2024.
