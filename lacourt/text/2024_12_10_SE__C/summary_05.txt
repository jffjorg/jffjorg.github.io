And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has granted the motion of the defendants, Kyler Jade Bechtold and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, to strike the fourth cause of action for punitive damages and the prayer for punitive damages. The Judge found that the complaint does not contain sufficient factual allegations to support a finding of malice, oppression, or fraud, which are required for a punitive damages award. The Judge also struck the prayer for attorney's fees, finding that there is no contract or statute that authorizes recovery of attorney's fees in this case.
