And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Bristol Farms v. Heritage Two LLC, et al. The case involves a petition to confirm an arbitration award in favor of Bristol Farms, which prevailed in an arbitration against Jeffrey B. Panosian and Clare B. Panosian (the "Panosians") stemming from two leases. The arbitrators awarded Bristol Farms damages in the amount of $33,026.40 and $39,615, for a total of $72,641.40. The Panosians do not oppose the petition, and the court has confirmed the arbitration award. The court has also granted the petition against Heritage Two LLC, which was joined as a party Respondent because the Panosians transferred their ownership interests in the leases to that entity during the arbitration. The court has awarded post-judgment interest at the statutory rate, as the award does not reference prejudgment interest. The case is now resolved, and the court's clerk will update the docket to reflect this.
