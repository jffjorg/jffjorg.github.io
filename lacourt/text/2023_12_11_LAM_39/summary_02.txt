And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied Pitzer College's motion to declare Brendan Schultz a vexatious litigant without prejudice. The motion was based on the argument that Schultz has filed multiple lawsuits against various defendants and has been a self-represented party in some of these lawsuits, resulting in final adverse decisions against him. However, the Judge found that Defendant's counsel did not establish that Schultz had litigated five cases as a self-represented party within the past seven years resulting in final adverse decisions against him. The Judge also found that the cases cited by Defendant did not satisfy the requirements of the statute, and that Defendant's counsel had not addressed the issues raised in the Court's previous order. The Judge ordered that the motion be denied without prejudice, and that Defendant's counsel may re-file the motion once there are final decisions against Schultz in at least two of his pending cases.
