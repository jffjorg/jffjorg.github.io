And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, County of Los Angeles Probation Department, filed a motion to recover $1,860 in costs on appeal, but the plaintiff, Ereni Youssef, filed a motion to tax those costs. Under California law, a defendant who prevails in a Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA) case can only recover costs if the plaintiff's claims were frivolous, unreasonable, without foundation, or brought in bad faith. Since the defendant did not file an opposition to the motion to tax costs, the court cannot conclude that the defendant has satisfied this requirement. Therefore, the court grants the plaintiff's motion to tax costs and orders the defendant not to be entitled to any costs on appeal.
