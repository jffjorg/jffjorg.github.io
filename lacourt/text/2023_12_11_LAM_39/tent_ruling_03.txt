 Case Number:  BC701973    Hearing Date:   December 11, 2023    Dept:  39 Ereni Youssef v.
County of Los Angeles Probation Department
Case No. BC701973
Motion to Tax
Costs
 
            Defendant
filed a motion of costs on appeal seeking $1,860 in costs to copy and print
briefs.  Plaintiff filed a motion to tax
costs.  A defendant who prevails in a
FEHA case may recover costs only if the plaintiff’s claims were “frivolous,
unreasonable, without foundation, or brought in bad faith.”  (Chavez v. City of Los Angeles (2010) 47
Cal.4th 970, 984.)  Although the Court
granted Defendant’s motion for summary judgment and the District Court of
Appeal affirmed that decision, the Court cannot conclude that Defendant has
satisfied this requirement.  Nor did
Defendant attempt to do so, as Defendant’s counsel did not file an opposition
to the motion. 
 
            Based upon
the foregoing, the Court orders as follows:
 
            1.         Plaintiff’s motion to tax costs is
granted.  Defendant shall not be entitled
to any costs on appeal.
 
            2.         Plaintiff’s counsel shall provide
notice and file proof of such with the Court.
