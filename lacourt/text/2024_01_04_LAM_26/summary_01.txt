The judge has granted the motion to consolidate the Lead Action (Case No. 21STCV09634) and the Related Action (Case No. 23AHCV00325) for purposes of trial. The two actions involve similar facts and parties, and consolidating them will avoid presenting the same evidence to two separate juries, promote judicial economy, and avoid possible inconsistent verdicts. The consolidation is ordered for purposes of trial under Case No. 21STCV09634.
