[TENTATIVE] order RE:
defendants Zhenya he and le sky group llc’s motion to consolidate



 
Procedural
Background
On March 11, 2021, Plaintiff Hin Ku (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant
action for breach of contract and fraud arising out of a real estate
transaction involving Defendants Zhenya He (“He”), Ying Chen (“Chen”),
and Le Sky Group, LLC (“Le Sky”) (collectively “Defendants”).  On March 22, 2022, Plaintiff filed the operative
Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”).  The SAC
asserts three causes of action for (1) Breach of Unsecured Promissory Note, (2)
Intentional Misrepresentation, and (3) Negligent Misrepresentation.
On September 27, 2023, Los Angeles Superior Court Case No. 23AHCV00325 (“Related
Action”) was deemed related to the instant action (“Lead Action”) with the
instant action as the lead case.  (Minute
Order 9/27/23.)
On November 16, 2023, Defendants He and Le Sky (jointly “Moving
Defendants”) filed the instant motion to consolidate
the instant Lead Action with the Related Action.  On December 7, 2023, the Court granted Moving
Defendant’s ex parte application and advanced the instant motion to January 4,
2024.  (Minute Order 12/7/23.)  No opposition or reply has been filed.
 
Allegations of the
Operative Complaint 
The SAC alleges
as follows: 
            Defendant
Zhenya He owned a residential property in San Marino (“Property”) and used
Defendant Le Sky to sell the property.  (SAC
¶¶ 4, 23.)  Defendant Zhenya He is
identified in Le Sky’s Operating Agreement as the sole member and manager of Le
Sky.  (SAC ¶ 21.)  Defendant Le Sky is the alter ego of Defendant
Zhenya He.  (SAC ¶¶ 8-19.)  Defendant Chen was appointed as an additional
manager of Le Sky and acted as Le Sky’s agent between September and December
2020.  (SAC ¶¶ 3, 21.)
On October 2,
2020, Plaintiff and his wife entered into an agreement to purchase the Property
from Defendant Le Sky for $4,700,000.00 in cash with no contingencies.  (SAC ¶ 20.) 
Plaintiff made an initial deposit into escrow of $150,000.  (SAC ¶ 20.) 
On October 5, 2020, additional escrow instructions confirmed a closing
date of October 27, 2020, an initial deposit of $150,000, and a purchase price
of $4,700,000.  (SAC ¶ 22.)
            On
October 6, 2020, Defendant Chen as Le Sky’s agent executed a grant deed for the
Property from Le Sky to Plaintiff and his wife. 
(SAC ¶ 23.)  On October 8, 2020,
Defendants proposed an escrow amendment by which Plaintiff and his wife would
agree to pay Le Sky $4,550,000 outside of escrow, and Le Sky would inform the
escrow holder upon receipt.  (SAC ¶
24.)  On October 26, 2020, the close of
escrow on the Property was delayed to November 18, 2020 by Amendment.  (SAC ¶ 25.) 

            In
November 2020, Defendant Zhenya He’s lender for the Property called the
$2,671,553.63 note on the Property (“HSBC Loan”).  (SAC ¶ 26.) 
However, Defendant Zhenya He did not have the funds to pay the note.  (SAC ¶ 26.) 
Therefore, Defendant Zhenya He would have lost the Property to the
lender had it not been for Plaintiff’s agreement to pay sums outside of escrow,
subject to repayment by a Promissory Note, in connection with the sale of the
Property.  (SAC ¶ 26.) 
            “In
early November 2020, after receipt of the 11-6-2020 notice, in order to entice [Plaintiff]
to proceed with purchase of the Property after [Zhenya] He’s lender called the
loan on the Property, Defendants Chen, [Zhenya] He and Le Sky through Chen via
her POA and position as Manager of Le Sky, in person and/or through [Maggie
Chan, the realtor,] represented that sums paid by [Plaintiff] to satisfy the
HSBC Loan on the Property would be repaid shortly after escrow closed; that the
loan would not and did not increase the purchase price of the property and that
there would be little or no risk in that Chen would execute a Promissory Note making
herself personally liable; that repayment would be via the cash influx to Le
Sky derived from the sales proceeds of the Property to [Plaintiff]; that Le Sky
would fund Chen’s repayment of the Note.” 
(SAC ¶ 26.)  “Contrariwise, Chen’s
execution [of] the Note making her personally liable reasonably inferred that
even if [Zhenya] He and/or Le Sky did not fund repayment of the Note Chen would
pay the Note for which she was personally liable. Plaintiff relied on the
reasonable inference that if [Zhenya] He and/or Le Sky did not fund repayment
of the Note, couple[d] with the representation that Plaintiff bore no risk as
the Note was personally guaranteed by Chen, that Chen had assets to pay the
Note irrespective of funding via [Zhenya] He and/or Le Sky.”  (SAC ¶ 26.)
            The
parties agreed and executed an addendum to the escrow instructions on November
20, 2020 that provided that the Defendants would execute a promissory note for
any amounts paid by Plaintiff under the purchase agreement in excess of the
purchase price.  (SAC ¶ 28.)  
            On November
21,2020, Defendant Chen, executed an Unsecured Promissory Note in favor of
Plaintiff in the amount of $1,127,676.71 to be repaid in thirty (30) days plus
interest.  (SAC ¶ 29.)  However, when Defendant Chen signed the Promissory
Note, she had no way to pay the note nor any reasonable expectation that she
could pay the note.  (SAC ¶ 29.)  To date, and despite demand from Plaintiff,
Defendants have failed to make any payment on the November 21, 2020 Unsecured
Promissory Note.  (SAC ¶ 29.)  
 
Legal Standard
California Rules of
Court Rule 3.350(a) states in relevant part:
(1) A notice of motion to consolidate must:
(A) List all named
parties in each case, the names of those who have appeared, and the names of
their respective attorneys of record;
(B) Contain the
captions of all the cases sought to be consolidated, with the lowest numbered
case shown first; and
(C) Be filed in each case sought to be consolidated.
 
(2) The motion to consolidate:
(A) Is deemed a
single motion for the purpose of determining the appropriate filing fee, but
memorandums, declarations, and other supporting papers must be filed only in
the lowest numbered case;
(B) Must be served
on all attorneys of record and all non-represented parties in all of the cases
sought to be consolidated; and
(C) Must have a proof of service filed as part of the motion.
(Cal. Rules of
Court, Rule 3.350(a).) Also, the consolidation statute, Code of Civil Procedure
§ 1048, states in relevant part:
(a) When actions
involving a common question of law or fact are pending before the court, it may
order a joint hearing or trial of any or all the matters in issue in the
actions; it may order all the actions consolidated and it may make such orders
concerning proceedings therein as may tend to avoid unnecessary costs or delay.
(b) The court, in
furtherance of convenience or to avoid prejudice, or when separate trials will
be conducive to expedition and economy, may order a separate trial of any cause
of action, including a cause of action asserted in a cross-complaint, or of any
separate issue or of any number of causes of action or issues, preserving the
right of trial by jury required by the Constitution or a statute of this state
or of the United States.
(CCP § 1048(a).) The
granting or denial of the motion to consolidate rests in the sound discretion
of the trial court, and will not be reversed except upon a clear showing of
abuse of discretion. (See Fellner v. Steinbaum (1955) 132 Cal.App.2d
509, 511.)
 
Discussion
Moving
Defendants seeks to consolidate the Lead Action and Related Action for purposes
of trial.
            “Code
of Civil Procedure section 1048, subdivision (a), authorizes the trial court,
when appropriate, to ‘order a joint hearing or trial’ or to ‘order all the
actions consolidated.’ Under the statute and the case law, there are thus two
types of consolidation: a consolidation for purposes of trial only, where the
two actions remain otherwise separate; and a complete consolidation or
consolidation for all purposes, where the two actions are merged into a single
proceeding under one case number and result in only one verdict or set of
findings and one judgment.”  (Hamilton
v. Asbestos Corp., Ltd. (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1127, 1147.)  “Consolidation under Code of Civil Procedure
section 1048 is permissive, and it is for the trial court to determine whether
the consolidation is for all purposes or for trial only.”  (Id. at p.1149.)  Moreover, there is no requirement that the
parties be identical for a complete consolidation. (See e.g., Jefferson
Street Ventures, LLC v. City of Indio (2015) 236 Cal.App.4th 1175,
1206 [noting in action involving multiple but not completely overlapping parties
that “consolidation appears particularly appropriate in this case—the cases are
in the same court, involve the same property, and many (if not all) of
the same damages.”] [italics added].)
            Here,
numerous factors support a consolidation for trial.  For example, the instant Lead Action seeks to
enforce promissory notes that were issued in conjunction with the sale of the
Property.  (SAC ¶¶ 31-38.)  However, the complaint in the Related Action
alleges that the sale of the Property Ying Chen improperly effected the sale of
the property without authority and that Ying Chen falsely claimed to be an
agent of Zhenya He.  (Related Action
First Amended Complaint ¶¶ 5-30.)   Thus, the Related Action seeks to quiet title
to the Property.  In light of the significant
overlap in facts and the overlap in parties, a consolidated trial would avoid obviate
the unnecessary presentation of the same evidence to two separate juries, promote
judicial economy, and avoid possible inconsistent verdicts.
            Moreover,
no party has opposed the consolidation of the Lead and Related Actions.  Accordingly, Moving Defendant’s motion to consolidate
the Lead Action and Related Action for trial is GRANTED.  
 
CONCLUSION AND
ORDER
Based on the forgoing, Defendants Zhenya He and Le Sky Group, LLC’s
motion to consolidate 21STCV09634 and 23AHCV00325 for trial is GRANTED.  Consolidation is ordered for purposes of
trial under Case No. 21STCV09634.  
Moving Parties are to give notice and file
proof of service of such.
