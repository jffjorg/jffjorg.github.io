Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling regarding the Plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration of the December 27, 2022 Order compelling arbitration. The Court has determined that the Plaintiffs' motion is untimely and fails to satisfy the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 1008. However, the Court is bringing its own motion for reconsideration of the December 27, 2022 Order, citing new appellate authority that disagrees with the prior ruling. The Court invites briefing from the parties and has scheduled a hearing for February 26, 2024, at 8:30 am.
