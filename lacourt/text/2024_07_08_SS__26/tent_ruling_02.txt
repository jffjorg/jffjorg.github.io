Romex Textiles, Inc. v. Promises, Promises, Inc., et
al.RECONSIDERATION(CCP § 1008)
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Based on the
foregoing, Defendants Promises, Promises, Inc. and Eugene Michael Hardy’s
Motion for Reconsideration is DENIED.
 
 
 
 
ANALYSIS:
 
Plaintiff Romex
Textiles, Inc. (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant action for breach of contract
and common counts against Defendants Promises, Promises, Inc. (“Defendant PPI”)
and Eugene Michael Hardy (“Defendant Hardy”) on August 3, 2023. The First
Amended Complaint was filed on October 23, 2023. On January 25, 2024, the Court
sustained Defendants’ Demurrer to the First Amended Complaint with leave to
amend. (Minute Order, 01/25/24.) The Motion to Strike was accordingly deemed
moot. (Ibid.) 
 
Plaintiff filed
the Second Amended Complaint on February 13, 2024. On April 16, 2024,
Defendants filed a Demurrer to, and Motion to Strike Portions of, the Second
Amended Complaint. The Demurrer and Motion to Strike came for hearing on May
14, 2024 at which time the Court heard argument from Plaintiff and took the
matter under submission. (Minute Order, 05/14/24.) On May 20, 2024, the Court overruled
the Demurrer and ordered Defendants to answer within 20 days. (Minute Order,
05/20/24.) 
 
Defendants filed
the instant Motion for Reconsideration on May 30, 2024. Plaintiff filed an
opposition on June 24, 2024 and Defendants replied on June 28, 2024. 
 
Discussion
 
The Motion
is brought pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1008, subdivision (a),
which states in relevant part:
 
When an application for an order has been made to a judge, or
to a court, and refused in whole or in part, or granted, or granted
conditionally, or on terms, any party affected by the order may, within 10 days
after service upon the party of written notice of entry of the order and based
upon new or different facts, circumstances, or law, make application to the
same judge or court that made the order, to reconsider the matter and modify,
amend, or revoke the prior order. The party making the application shall state
by affidavit what application was made before, when and to what judge, what
order or decisions were made, and what new or different facts, circumstances,
or law are claimed to be shown.
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1008, subd.
(a).) The Court lacks the jurisdiction to reconsider a prior ruling, on motion
of a party, where the motion does not comply with the requirements of Code of
Civil Procedure section 1008. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1008, subd. (e); Le
Francois v. Goel (2005) 35 Cal.4th 1094, 1106.) Additionally, there is a
diligence requirement: “Courts have construed section 1008 to require a party
filing an application for reconsideration or a renewed application to show
diligence with a satisfactory explanation for not having presented the new or
different information earlier.” (Even Zohar Construction & Remodeling,
Inc. v. Bellaire Townhouses, LLC (2015) 61 Cal.4th 830, 839.)
 
Defendants move for reconsideration of the order overruling their
Demurrer to the Second Amended Complaint on the grounds that (1) Plaintiff was
a suspended corporation that could not oppose the Demurrer; (2) the Court did
not consider their reply or request for judicial notice; and (3) new law
supports reconsideration.
 
In support, Defendants request that the Court take judicial notice of the
following: (1) this Court’s May 20, 2024 ruling on submitted matter in Los
Angeles Superior Court Case No. 23STLC04893, filed in this Court on May 20,
2024; (2) the California Secretary of State’s May 20, 2024 Certificate of
Status regarding Plaintiff Romex Textiles, Inc.; (3) the May 20, 2024
Entity Status Letter from the State of California Franchise Tax Board regarding
Plaintiff; (4) the January 26, 2022 Audit Assessment of Plaintiff by the City
of Los Angeles Office of Finance; (5) the Complaint in City of Los Angeles v.
Romex Textiles, Inc., Los Angeles Superior
Court Case No. 24STCP00704, filed
in this Court on March 7, 2024; and (6) the October 10, 2022 Notice of Judgment
Lien filed with the California Secretary of State against Plaintiff in
connection with the judgment of $9,044,383.56 entered against Plaintiff in Los
Angeles Superior Court Case No. 19STCV40836. The request is granted as to
Exhibits 1 and 2. The request is denied as to exhibits 3 to 6 for lack of
relevance. 
 
Plaintiff’s evidentiary
objections to the declaration of Attorney Hardy are ruled on as follows: No. 1
overruled; Nos. 2-9 sustained.
 
Regarding the first basis for reconsideration, Plaintiff’s corporate
status at the time of the Demurrer, the opposition demonstrates that Plaintiff
has been conditionally revived by the Secretary of State as of June 24, 2024.
(Opp., Binafard Decl., Exh. 1.) “[A] suspended corporation which pays its taxes
and obtains a certificate of revivor during the pendency of an action may be
allowed to carry on the litigation, even to the extent of validating otherwise
invalid prior proceedings.” (Gar-Lo, Inc. v. Prudential Sav. & Loan
Assn. (1974) 41 Cal.App.3d 242, 244.) That Plaintiff’s corporate status was
suspended when it opposed the Demurrer, therefore, is not grounds for
reconsideration of the Court’s ruling. 
 
Defendants also argue that because alter ego is an equitable doctrine,
Plaintiff’s deception in appearing at the demurrer hearing while suspended is
grounds to bar those allegations. In support of this argument, Defendants cite Quick
v. Pearson (2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 371 for the proposition that “a party who
seeks equity must also do equity.” (Quick v. Pearson (2010) 186
Cal.App.4th 371, 380.) The Court of Appeals explained what it means to “do
equity” as follows: “‘The unclean hands doctrine “closes the doors of a court
of equity to one tainted with inequitableness or bad faith relative to the
matter in which he seeks relief.” ’ [citations omitted].” (Ibid.) The
question of bad faith, therefore, does not concern Plaintiff’s litigation
conduct. Rather, it concerns Plaintiff’s conduct with respect to the parties’ business
transactions. 
 
Regarding the second basis for reconsideration, Defendants rely on cases
that are distinguishable from this action. Specifically, in those cases, the
trial courts failed to consider memoranda filed or arguments made by the moving
party but also that the moving parties could not have presented earlier. In Johnston
v. Corrigan (2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 553, the Court of Appeals affirmed the
trial court’s ruling granting reconsideration of the cross-defendants’ motion
for attorney’s fees following an anti-SLAPP motion. Reconsideration was proper
because the trial court had previously and incorrectly ruled that the cross-defendants
had not filed any points and authorities in support of their special motion to
strike; in the motion for reconsideration, the cross-defendants demonstrated
that they had, in fact, filed said points and authorities. (Johnston v.
Corrigan (2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 553, 555.)
 
In Kalivas v. Barry Controls Corp. (1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 1152, the
Court of Appeals ruled that reconsideration should have been granted when a
party, as a result of being misled by a confusing courtroom rule, filed no
opposition to a motion for summary judgment and did not appear at the hearing.
(Kalivas v. Barry Controls Corp. (1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 1152, 1161.)
Finally, in Glade v. Glade (1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 1441, the family law
court erred in denying reconsideration when the moving party’s attorney was
barred from introducing evidence of a stay issued in a related foreclosure
action. (Glade v. Glade (1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 1441, 1447-1448.) 
 
Here, Defendants were provided opportunities to present their arguments:
they filed a reply in support of the Demurrer, which the Court’s ruling
expressly acknowledged. (Minute Order, 05/14/24.) Defendants also had the
opportunity to appear at the hearing and argue but instead submitted on the
tentative ruling, which was to overrule the Demurrer as to Defendant PPI but
sustain it as to Defendant Hardy. (Minute Order, 05/14/24.) The Motion for
Reconsideration does not provide a satisfactory explanation for failing to
raise these arguments earlier. 
 
Finally, Defendants point to two
new cases as “new law” that support reconsideration. Neither case constitutes
“new law” in the sense that they stand for a proposition never previously
articulated. The Motion points to Campbell v. Los Angeles Unified School
District (2024) 2024 WL 2281587, at *1 for the proposition that courts have
the ability to sustain demurrers without leave to amend. This has long been
established by case law. In the other case, D.K. v. Office of Administrative
Hearings (2024) 2024 WL 2147805, at *1, Defendants rely on the Court of
Appeals’ ruling taking judicial notice of an involuntary medication order.
Again, there is no question of matters this Court could take judicial notice at
the time of the hearing on the Demurrer. Therefore, this case is not new law as
contemplated by the reconsideration statute. (See Ovitz v. Schulman (2005) 133
Cal.App.4th 830, 848 [law is not new if it relies on earlier decisions that
invoke the same principle].)
 
 
 
Conclusion
 
Therefore, Defendants
Promises, Promises, Inc. and Eugene Michael Hardy’s Motion for Reconsideration
is DENIED.
 
 
Court clerk to give notice.
