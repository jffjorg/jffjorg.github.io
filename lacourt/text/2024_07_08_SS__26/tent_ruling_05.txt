ANALYSIS:
 
On April 8, 2024, Plaintiff
Robertson’s Ready Mix, Ltd. (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant action for automobile subrogation against Defendant
Shuyuan Zhang (“Defendant Zhang”) and others. Defendant Zhang filed the instant Motion for Leave to File
Cross-Complaint on May 9, 2024. No opposition has been filed to date.
 
Discussion
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 428.50 provides:
 
“(a) A party
shall file a cross-complaint against any of the parties who filed the complaint
or cross-complaint against him or her before or at the same time as the answer
to the complaint or cross-complaint.
 
(b) Any other
cross-complaint may be filed at any time before the court has set a date for
trial.
 
(c) A party shall obtain leave
of court to file any cross-complaint except one filed within the time specified in subdivision (a) or (b).  Leave
may be granted in the interest of justice at any time during the course of the action.”
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 428.50.) Defendant
Zhang moves for leave to file a cross-complaint against Plaintiff, and
Defendants Apex Design Concrete LLC and Calixto Andrew Franco III. The Motion
is brought on the grounds that the cross-complaint arises out of the same
incident that gives rise to the Complaint. (Motion, Deng Decl., p. 2:4-12.) Based
on the supporting declaration and lack of any opposition, the Court finds that
leave to file a cross-complaint is in the interests of justice. 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant Shuyuan Zhang’s Motion for Leave to File
Cross-Complaint is GRANTED. THE PROPOSED CROSS-COMPLAINT IS TO BE FILED AND
SERVED WITHIN 20 DAYS OF THIS ORDER.
