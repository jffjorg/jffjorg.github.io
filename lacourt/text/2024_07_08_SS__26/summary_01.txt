Here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge in a case between Michael M. Mojaver (Plaintiff) and Michael J. Bayard (Defendant). The Plaintiff filed a complaint alleging causes of action for breach of contract, breach of agreement, promissory estoppel, unjust enrichment, quantum meruit, and inflection of emotional stress. The Defendant filed a demurrer to the complaint, arguing that the allegations are barred by the doctrine of arbitral immunity. The judge has sustained the demurrer without leave to amend, meaning that the Plaintiff cannot refile the complaint with additional allegations. The judge has also taken judicial notice of various documents, including the Complaint, Notice of Termination and Dissolution of Newport Construction, Inc., and the Final Arbitration Award. The case will proceed no further.
