Mojaver
v. Bayard, et al.DEMURRER(CCP § 430.10, et seq.)
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Defendant Michael J. Bayard’s Demurrer to the Complaint is
SUSTAINED WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND.
 
 
ANALYSIS: 
 

On May 25, 2022, Plaintiff Michael
M. Mojaver (“Plaintiff”), in propria persona, filed the Complaint in this
action against Defendant Michael J. Bayard (“Defendant”). Proof of service by
mail was filed on February 28, 2023 and April 10, 2023. The case came for trial
on November 22, 2023, at which time the Court placed the trial off calendar and
set an order to show cause regarding Plaintiff’s failure to enter Defendant’s
default and default judgment. (Minute Order, 11/22/23.) 
 
The Motion to Quash was filed by Defendant on February 1,
2024 and was initially set for hearing in Department 25 in the Spring Street
Courthouse. On February 29, 2024, the case was transferred to Department 26 in
the Spring Street Courthouse. The Court granted Defendant’s Motion to Quash
Service of the Summons and Complaint on April 9, 2024. (Minute Order,
04/09/24.) 
 
At the Order to Show Cause Re Failure to File Proof of
Service of Summons on April 30, 2024, Plaintiff requested additional time to
serve Defendant. (Minute Order, 04/30/24.) The Order to Show Cause was
continued to October 29, 2024. (Ibid.) On June 10, 2024, Defendant filed
the instant Demurrer to the Complaint, thereby submitting themselves to the
jurisdiction of this Court. No opposition to the Demurrer has been filed to
date. 
 
Discussion
 
The Demurrer is accompanied by a
meet and confer declaration as required by Code of Civil Procedure section
430.41. (Demurrer, Backus Decl., Exh. A.)
The Demurrer is brought on the basis that the Complaint fails to allege facts
sufficient to state a cause of action and is uncertain. (Notice of Demurrer,
pp. 2:1-3:4 [citing Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subds. (e), (f)].) Special
demurrers, however, are not permitted in the limited jurisdiction court. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 92, subd. (c).) Therefore, the Court will not rule on the
demurrer for uncertainty. 
 
Allegations in the Complaint
 
The Complaint alleges causes of
action for (1) Breach Of Contract; 2) Breach Of Agreement; (3) Promissory
Estoppel; (4) Unjust Enrichment; (5) Quantum Meruit; (6) Inflection Of
Emotional Stress; and (7) Open Book Account, based on the following facts.
Plaintiff was harmed by Defendant’s breach of a contract with the American
Arbitration Association (“AAA”). (Compl., pp. 1:22-2:1.) Plaintiff further
alleges that he was a primary party to that contract. (Id. at p. 2:3-4.)
Defendant was to provide “neutral, unbiased, and impartial oversight over the
matter that was a subcontract between Plaintiff and AAA.” (Id. at pp.
2:21-24.) Defendant violated the terms of the contract by allowing a bogus and
untimely counterclaim to be filed, by refusing to ban ex parte communications, and
by failing to be unbiased and impartial, thereby causing Plaintiff financial
harm. (Id. at p. 4:1-24.)

Defendant asks that the Court take judicial notice of the

Construction Industry Arbitration Rules and Mediation Procedures
The request for judicial notice asks the Court to take
judicial notice pursuant to Evidence Code sections 451 to 453, specifically,
section 452, subdivisions (c), (d), and (h). With respect to court records, the
Court cannot take judicial notice of the facts contained therein and may only
take judicial notice of the existence of those records. (See Adams v. Bank
of America, N.A. (2020) 51 Cal.App.5th 666, 673 [citing Sosinsky v.
Grant (1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 1548, 1569–1570].) The Court’s judicial notice
of these documents is limited accordingly. 
 
Demurrer to Complaint
 
Defendant argues that the claims in the Complaint are barred
by the doctrine of arbitral immunity, as articulated by the Court of Appeals: 
 
“As our Supreme Court has stated:
Arbitrators are judges chosen by the parties to decide the matters submitted to
them … Arbitrators have been extended the protection of judicial immunity
because they perform the function of resolving disputes between parties, or of
authoritatively adjudicating private rights. (In re Marriage of Assemi (1994) 7
Cal.4th 896 909 [30 Cal. Rptr. 2d 265, 872 P.2d 1190]) … It has long been
recognized that, in private arbitration proceedings, an arbitrator enjoys the
benefit of an arbitral privilege [of immunity] because the role that he or she
exercises is analogous to that of a judge. … There is hardly any aspect of
arbitration law and practice more settled, both in domestic and international
relations, than the immunity of arbitrators from court actions for their
activities in arriving at their award. … This rule—immunizing arbitrators in
private contractual arbitration proceedings from tort liability—is well
established in California. (Moore v. Conliffe (1994) 7 Cal.4th 634, 650).”
(internal quotations omitted).
 
(La Serena Properties, LLC v. Weisbach (2010) 186
Cal.App.4th 893, 901.) Arbitrators, therefore, are immunized from suit for
their activities in reaching an arbitration award. Here, the Complaint alleges
that Defendant improperly allowed a bogus counterclaim to be filed in violation
of the statute of limitations, set the evidentiary hearing for two days instead
of one day, and was biased. These allegations are barred by the aforementioned
doctrine of immunity, which is broadly applied to different causes of action,
including failure to disclose, fraudulent concealment, breach of contract,
unfair business practices and negligence. (See id. at 899.) As the
allegations in support of Plaintiff’s causes of action pertain to Defendant’s
activities reaching the arbitration award, they are barred by arbitral
immunity. Nor has Plaintiff filed any opposition demonstrating that the
doctrine of arbitral immunity does not apply or that other facts can be alleged
to overcome said immunity.
 
Conclusion
 
Therefore, Defendant Michael J. Bayard’s Demurrer to the
Complaint is SUSTAINED WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND.
 
 
Moving party to give notice.
