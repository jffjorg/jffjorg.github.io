Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the Motion for Reconsideration filed by Promises, Promises, Inc. and Eugene Michael Hardy. The motion was brought under Code of Civil Procedure section 1008, subdivision (a), which allows a party to seek reconsideration of a prior ruling based on new or different facts, circumstances, or law.

The judge found that the motion did not comply with the requirements of the statute, as it did not provide a satisfactory explanation for not having presented the new or different information earlier. The judge also found that the defendants had opportunities to present their arguments during the previous hearing, but failed to do so.

The judge also ruled that the defendants' arguments were based on cases that were distinguishable from this action, and that the defendants did not provide sufficient evidence to support their claims. The judge further ruled that the defendants' reliance on new cases was not sufficient to warrant reconsideration, as the cases did not constitute "new law" in the sense that they stood for a proposition never previously articulated.

The judge's decision was based on a review of the facts, including the pleadings, the previous hearing, and the parties' arguments. The judge concluded that the motion for reconsideration was denied, and that the previous ruling would stand.
