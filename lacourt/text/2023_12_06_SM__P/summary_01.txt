And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling addresses a motion for summary judgment filed by defendant Roe 1 in a case alleging negligent supervision, retention, and training by the defendant in the sexual abuse of the plaintiff, Jane Doe, as a minor in 1974. The defendant argues that the plaintiff cannot present admissible evidence showing that the defendant knew or should have known about the alleged abuse. The court disagrees, holding that the defendant has a heightened duty to protect children in its care from sexual abuse, and that the plaintiff need not prove actual knowledge of a specific employee's propensity for sexual abuse. The court finds that the defendant failed to implement policies to protect children from the general risk of abuse, and therefore denies the motion for summary judgment.
