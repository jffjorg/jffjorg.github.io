And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer to the Defendant's First Amended Answer (FAA) in the case of Steiger v. Nine Eighteen Twenty-First Street Homeowners Assoc. and Mortazavi. The Plaintiff, Steiger, alleges that the HOA defendants improperly restricted his ability to renovate his residential unit. The FAA pleaded 24 affirmative defenses, but the Judge finds that 20 of these defenses consist only of legal conclusions without factual support. The Judge sustains the demurrer to these affirmative defenses, giving the Defendants 10 days to amend their answer to allege relevant facts supporting each defense.
