Berman v. Sonic
Automotive, Inc., Case No. 23SMCV01240
Hearing Date
December 6, 2023
Defendant Sonic
Santa Monica’s Motion to Compel Arbitration 
 
Plaintiff Berman alleges
the car he purchased from defendant Sonic Automotive was defective. Berman
alleges defendants failed to honor the car’s warranty and seeks damages. Defendant
Sonic moves to compel arbitration.
 
The installment
sale contract between plaintiff and Sonic includes an arbitration agreement:
“[b]y signing below, you agree that, pursuant to the Arbitration Provision on
page 5 of this contract, you or we may elect to resolve any dispute by neutral,
binding arbitration and not by a court action.” Motion pg. 1, Arroyo decl.
exhibit A. The agreement applies to any dispute between “you and . . . our
employees, agents, successors or assigns, which arises out of or relates to
your credit application, purchase or condition of this vehicle, this contract
or any resulting transaction or relationship[.]” Id. 
 
There
is a liberal federal policy favoring arbitration, requiring arbitration
agreements to be on equal footing with other contracts and requiring courts to
resolve doubts as to whether a dispute falls within an arbitration provision in
favor of arbitration. AT&T Mobility, LLC v. Concepcion (2011) 563
U.S. 333, 339; AT&T Tech., Inc. v. Comm. Workers of Am. (1986) 475
U.S. 643, 650. A similar policy has been expressed by California courts. Hayes
Children Leasing Co. v. NCR Corp. (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 775, 788.
 
A party waives the
right to arbitrate when it “substantially invokes” the litigation machinery
before moving to arbitrate, resulting in prejudice to the opposing party. Hoover
v. American Income Life Ins. Co. (2012) 20 Cal.App.4th 1193, 1204. Filing
an answer does not itself waive the right to seek arbitration. Christensen
v. Dewor Dev. (1983) 33 Cal.3d 778, 782. Responding to discovery
does not constitute invocation of the litigation machinery. Davis v.
Continental Airlines, Inc. (1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 205, 217. Unreasonable
delay in moving to compel arbitration can lead to a waiver of arbitration
rights. Spear v. California State Auto Ass’n. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 1035,
1043.
 
Berman argues
Sonic waived the right to arbitrate via delay and engaging in discovery. Berman
alleges Sonic “engaged in extensive discovery with Plaintiff.” Slott decl. ¶6. However,
Sonic did not propound discovery. Phan decl. ¶2, ¶9. Filing an answer and
responding to discovery does not constitute invoking the litigation machinery
sufficient to deny the right to arbitrate.
 
Sonic and Berman
stipulated to set aside Sonic’s default on June 14, 2023. Plaintiff alleges Sonic
delayed until November 9, 2023, when this motion was filed, constituting waiver
of its right to arbitrate. Berman argues he propounded discovery and is
prejudiced by Sonic’s delay.
 
Sonic argues the
delay was reasonable, as the parties were in settlement discussions from August
to October 2023, with negotiations breaking down in mid-October, and counsel
for Sonic sending a letter requesting arbitration on October 25, 2023. Phan
decl. ¶¶5-7. This is corroborated by an email from Berman’s counsel, who
granted Sonic a discovery extension while settlement discussions were ongoing.
Exh. B. Sonic’s delay was caused by attempts to settle before moving to compel
arbitration. It was reasonable for Sonic to wait until settlement negotiations
failed before invoking the arbitration clause. There is no undue prejudice.
 
Berman argues the
contract should be rescinded due to fraud or negligent misrepresentation. This
argument is underdeveloped and conclusory; Berman provides no evidence or
authority.
 
GRANTED. The claims
against Sonic will proceed to arbitration. The court will hear from the parties
as to whether claims against the Mercedes defendants should be stayed.
