And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Berman v. Sonic Automotive, Inc., Case No. 23SMCV01240, scheduled for hearing on December 6, 2023. Sonic has moved to compel arbitration, citing an arbitration agreement in the car purchase contract. Berman argues that Sonic waived its right to arbitrate due to delay and engaging in discovery. The court finds that Sonic's delay was reasonable, as the parties were in settlement discussions from August to October 2023, and Sonic only moved to compel arbitration after negotiations broke down. The court grants Sonic's motion and orders the claims against Sonic to proceed to arbitration. The court will also hear from the parties on whether claims against the Mercedes defendants should be stayed.
