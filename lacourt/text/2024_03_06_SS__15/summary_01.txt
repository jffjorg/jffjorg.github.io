Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion to stay the case, finding that a suitable alternative forum exists in Florida. The court has considered the private and public interest factors and concludes that, in the interest of substantial justice, the action should be heard in Florida. The factors weighed in favor of Florida include the fact that the plaintiff has lived in Florida for a long time, most of the years of exposure occurred in Florida, and most defendants stipulate to jurisdiction in Florida. The court sets a status conference for September 4, 2024, and orders the parties to file a joint report regarding the status of any action in Florida.
