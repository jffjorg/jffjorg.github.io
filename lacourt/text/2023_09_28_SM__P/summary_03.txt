## English Summary

This tentative ruling addresses Plaintiff Delakas's motion to quash deposition subpoenas served by Defendant 2542 Barrington Partners, LLC. 

Delakas, who alleges the defendant landlord failed to address uninhabitable conditions in their rental property, argues that the subpoenas are overly broad and burdensome.  The subpoenas seek all medical records from Plaintiff's therapist, sleep institute, and health insurer, as well as rental records from prior landlords and information from the defendant's rental insurance provider.  

The Judge agrees with Delakas that the subpoenas are too broad, particularly regarding medical records and prior rental history. While some medical information may be relevant to the case, the Judge finds the current subpoenas excessive in their scope. 

The Judge grants Delakas's motion to quash the subpoenas and allows the Defendant to serve more narrowly tailored subpoenas that focus on specific relevant information.
