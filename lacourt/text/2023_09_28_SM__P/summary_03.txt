Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

In this case, Delakas, the plaintiff, has filed an unopposed motion to quash deposition subpoenas served by defendant 2542 Barrington Partners, LLC. The subpoenas seek a wide range of medical records, rental records, and insurance information from various parties, including the plaintiff's medical provider, health insurer, and prior landlords. The judge finds that the subpoenas are overly broad and burdensome, and grants the motion to quash. The defendant is ordered to serve more narrowly tailored subpoenas that are relevant to the case.
