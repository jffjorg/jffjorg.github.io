And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is denying the defendants' motion for attorney's fees. The defendants argue that they are entitled to fees under California Code of Civil Procedure section 685.040, which allows a judgment creditor to recover post-judgment fees and costs, including attorney's fees, if the underlying judgment contains a provision awarding fees. However, the judge finds that the defendants are not judgment creditors and did not incur fees and costs in "enforcing a judgment," as required by the statute. The judge also rejects the defendants' argument that they are entitled to fees under California Code of Civil Procedure section 1717, which applies to actions based on a contract containing an attorney's fees provision. The judge concludes that the defendants' motion is denied because they are not entitled to attorney's fees under either section 685.040 or section 1717.
