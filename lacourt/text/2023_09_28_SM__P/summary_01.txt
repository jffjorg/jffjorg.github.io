And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is denying the defendants' motion for attorney's fees. The defendants argue that they are entitled to fees under California Code of Civil Procedure section 685.040, which allows a judgment creditor to recover post-judgment fees and costs, including attorney's fees, if the underlying judgment contains a provision awarding fees. However, the judge finds that the defendants are not judgment creditors and did not incur fees and costs in "enforcing a judgment," as required by the statute. The judge also rejects the defendants' argument that they are entitled to fees under California Code of Civil Procedure section 1717, which applies to actions based on a contract containing an attorney's fees provision. The judge concludes that the defendants' motion is denied because they are not entitled to attorney's fees under either section 685.040 or section 1717.

## English Summary:

This tentative ruling denies the defendants' motion for attorney's fees. 

The judge explains that while one of the judgments against defendant Elyaszadeh included an attorney's fees provision, defendants are not entitled to fees under either California Code of Civil Procedure §685.040 or §1717. 

The judge states that §685.040 only allows for post-judgment fees incurred in "enforcing a judgment," which the defendants in this case did not do. 


Furthermore, §1717 applies to actions based on contracts containing attorney's fees provisions, but this case stemmed from a judgment, not a contract. 


Therefore, the judge concludes that defendants are not entitled to attorney's fees and denies their motion.

Here is the summary in English text:
The Judge has made a tentative ruling regarding a case, Case No. 21SMCP00018, in which Plaintiff Rafalian sued Defendants Magasinn, Elyaszadeh, and Yona for unpaid judgments, claiming the Defendants had helped Elyaszadeh to avoid paying these debts. A prior judgment from Judge Mark Young, issued on October 27, 2021, determined all the debts were already satisfied, so this Judge now agrees and therefore rejects Defendants' claim to get lawyer costs saying instead their Motion for Attorney’s Fees must be "DENIED." The Defendants do not fit requirements, listed within specified Laws as only allowed recovery as required as enforcement upon previously successful payments when law dictates under section Code in Procedure California code to which section cited of applicable ruling according under Statute does support when applying cited reference points found supporting by these particular Cases made also before when relevant within similar matters within Case, Code laws regarding Fees with said conditions regarding those not qualified like given present examples regarding Court procedure relevant codes found through those already discussed for fee repayment that follow from contract Laws  (under conditions  to a degree set), along requirements including relevant roles established (who might expect receiving legal compensatory Fees like) given prior stated findings concerning current motion case made given no  stated condition compliance requirement has established right said required of case by motion which no fulfillment here appears required now DENIED.

English summary:
In the case of Rafalian v. Elyaszadeh, et al., the plaintiff Rafalian sued defendant Elyaszadeh to recover three unpaid judgments. On October 27, 2021, Judge Mark Young found that all three judgments had been satisfied. Based on this ruling, the court issued judgment on the pleadings for defendants Magasinn, Elyaszadeh, and Yona. The defendants seek prevailing party attorneys' fees under Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. §685.040, which states that the "judgment creditor" is entitled to post-judgment fees and costs, including attorney's fees, if the underlying judgment contains a provision awarding fees. However, the court has ruled that only "reasonable and necessary costs of enforcing a judgment" are recoverable and the statute is unilateral, and only a judgment creditor seeking to enforce a judgment is entitled to post-judgment fees and costs. Since defendants did not incur fees and costs "enforcing a judgment," they are not entitled to post-judgment fees under the statute. The defendants also argue that they are entitled to fees under Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. §1717's bilaterality provision, but the court has ruled that this statute applies to actions based on a contract containing an attorney's fees provision, and since defendants are not judgment creditors, and since their fees were not incurred in "enforcing a judgment," and since this action derived from a judgment, not a contract with an attorney's fees provision, defendants are not entitled to attorney's fees under §685.040 or §1717. Therefore, the defendants' motion for attorney's fees is denied.
