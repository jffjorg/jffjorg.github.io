Gray v. Cortez,
Case No. 23SMCV00549
Hearing Date
September 28, 2023
Attorney
Eisenberg’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel for Plaintiff Gray - unopposed
 
Attorney Gary C.
Eisenberg moves to be relieved as counsel for plaintiff. The motion is on the
proper judicial council forms and was served on the client and opposing
counsel.
 
Eisenberg states
“[t]here has been a major breakdown in the attorney/client relationship.”
 
Plaintiff has not
opposed the motion. Since trial is not scheduled until April 22, 2024, Gray is
unlikely to suffer undue prejudice if the motion is granted. GRANTED.
