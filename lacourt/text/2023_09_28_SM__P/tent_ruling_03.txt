Delakas v. 2542
Barrington Partners, LLC, Case No. 23SMCV01490
Hearing Date
September 28, 2023 
Plaintiff Delakas’
Motions to Quash Deposition Subpoenas (UNOPPOSED)
 
Plaintiff Delakas alleges
defendant landlord 2542 Barrington failed to mitigate various uninhabitable
conditions. Defendant sent deposition subpoenas to Bernardine Fried, LMFT, Beverly
Hills Lung and Sleep Institute, Aetna Health of California (plaintiff’s medical
provider and health insurer), Sutton Place Apartments, Ocean Park Boulevard
(plaintiff’s prior landlords) and Mercury Insurance Company (rental insurance
provider). 
 
Delakas argues the
subpoenas are overly broad and burdensome. While some medical records may be
discoverable, as plaintiff put her physical and mental health at issue, the
subpoenas to Fried, the Sleep Institute and Aetna seek all records concerning
treatment without limitation as to time or subject matter.
 
Similarly, while rental
insurance may be relevant, the subpoena places no limitation as to time. To the
extent it seeks information prior to her tenancy, it is overbroad. Delakas’
prior rental records has no clear relevance here, so requests to prior
landlords not appropriate. 
 
As defendant filed
no opposition, the motion is GRANTED. Defendant may serve subpoenas that are
more narrowly tailored, per the ruling.
