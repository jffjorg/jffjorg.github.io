Rafalian v. Elyaszadeh,
et al., Case No. 21SMCP00018
Hearing Date
September 28, 2023 
Defendants
Magasinn and Elyaszadeh and Yona Defendants’ Motion for Attorney’s Fees 
 
Plaintiff Rafalian
sued to recover three unpaid judgments from defendant Elyaszadeh, alleging the
other defendants assisted Elyaszadeh in fraudulently transferring assets to
avoid payment. On October 27, 2021, Judge Mark Young found all three judgments
had been satisfied. Based largely on this ruling, the court issued judgment on
the pleadings for defendants. Defendants seek prevailing party attorneys’ fees
on the grounds that one of the judgments included an attorney’s fee provision.
 
Attorney’s fees
incurred in enforcing a judgment are recoverable if the underlying judgment
includes an award of attorney’s fees. Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. §685.040. This
applies to later actions against third parties who were not named in the
underlying suit which resulted in an attorney’s fees award. Cardinale v.
Miller (2014) 222 Cal.App.4th 1020, 1025. Under Cal. Code of Civ. Proc.
§1717, any attorney’s fees provision in a contract shall be treated as
reciprocal, regardless of wording that purports to make the right unilateral. Orozco
v. WPV San Jose, LLC (2019) 36 Cal.App.5th 375, 407.
 
Cal. Code of Civ.
Proc. §685.040 states the “judgment creditor” is entitled to post-judgment fees
and costs, including attorney’s fees, if the underlying judgment contains a
provision awarding fees. Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. §685.040. Only “reasonable and
necessary costs of enforcing a judgment” are recoverable. Id., emphasis
added. The statute is unilateral, and only a judgment creditor seeking to
enforce a judgment is entitled to post-judgment fees and costs. Defendants did
not incur fees and costs “enforcing a judgment,” as required under the statute.
 Under the terms of §685.040, they are
not entitled to post-judgment attorney’s fees. 
 
Defendants argue
they are entitled to fees under Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. §1717’s bilaterality
provision. That statute applies to actions based on a contract containing an
attorney’s fees provision. This was not an action on a contract, but an attempt
to recover a judgment that included attorney’s fees. Since defendants are not
judgment creditors, and since their fees were not incurred in “enforcing a
judgment,” and since this action derived from a judgment, not a contract with
an attorney’s fees provision, defendants are not entitled to attorney’s fees
under §685.040 or §1717. DENIED.
