 Case
  No.:  23STCV11632  
 
 
 
 Hearing Date: March 20, 2024



 
            
Defendant’s
motion to compel initial responses from Plaintiff to its Special
Interrogatories and Requests for Production is GRANTED, with responses to both
sets of discovery due within 15 days of entry of this order. Plaintiff is
sanctioned, jointly and severally with counsel, $1,000.00, payable within 30
days.  
 
            On
5/23/2023, Plaintiff Hyun Soon Lee (Plaintiff) filed suit against Fouad Ashour
and Ashour Victory Property, LLC, alleging: (1) breach of contract; (2) breach
of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; (3) negligence; (4) unjust
enrichment; and (5) fraud and misrepresentation.
 
            On
1/5/2024, Defendant Ashour Victory Property, LLC (Defendant) moved to compel
Plaintiff to provide initial responses to its Special Interrogatories and
Requests for Production (RFP). Defendant also seeks monetary sanctions in
connection with the motion. 
 
            The
motion is unopposed.
 
Discussion   
 
            As
a preliminary matter, Defendant is required to pay two filing fees, given that
it has consolidated two motions to compel different sets of discovery into a
single motion. 
 
            Now,
the Court turns to the substance of Defendant’s motion. 
 
            On
7/11/2023, Defendant served Plaintiff with its Special Interrogatories and
RFPs. To date, no responses have been received, and Plaintiff did not oppose
this motion.
 
            Based
on the foregoing, Defendant’s motion to compel responses is granted, with
responses to both sets of discovery due within 15 days of entry of this order.
Plaintiff is sanctioned, jointly and severally with counsel, $1,000.00.
 
 
It is so ordered.
