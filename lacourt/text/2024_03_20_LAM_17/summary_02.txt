And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion for leave to amend her complaint to add new allegations and causes of action. The plaintiff initially filed a lawsuit against the defendants alleging failure to pay wages, waiting time penalties, failure to reimburse business expenses, and violation of Business and Professions Code section 17200. The plaintiff is now seeking to add new factual allegations and causes of action related to threats made by defendant Chaudhari against her and her family, defamatory statements made by Chaudhari against her, equity interest owned by her in defendant FWB, and a workplace hostile environment during her employment at FWB. The plaintiff claims that she did not bring these claims sooner due to hopes that the case would resolve early in litigation and because she had substantial trepidation about bringing claims against a defendant who she believed was a vengeful person. The judge finds that the policy favoring leave to amend is strong and that the plaintiff's motion is adequately supported by a proposed amended pleading and a substantive explanation as to why the new allegations are necessary and why they were not alleged sooner. Therefore, the judge grants the plaintiff's motion for leave to amend her complaint.
