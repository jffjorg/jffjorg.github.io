And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling addresses three motions filed by the Govind Parties: a motion to disqualify counsel, a motion to expunge lis pendens, and a motion for determination of posting collateral security or secured lis pendens. The Court denies all three motions.

The Court finds that Alfred Anyia, counsel for Prashant and Mita, has not committed any ethical breaches that would warrant disqualification. The Court also finds that the Govind Parties have not shown a sufficient basis to justify disqualification.

The Court denies the motion to expunge lis pendens because the relief sought has already been obtained in September 2021. The Court also denies the motion for determination of posting collateral security or secured lis pendens because the statutory scheme for undertakings does not allow for what the Govind Parties seek. The Court concludes that the Govind Parties have not provided the Court with any authority that would allow it to subvert the Code of Civil Procedure's statutory scheme and allow a collateral security list as a substitute for the statutory requirement to provide an undertaking.
