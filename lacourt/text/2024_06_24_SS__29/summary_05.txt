And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

On June 24, 2024, the Court will hear the motion to compel Joseph Shirian to respond to Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Requests for Production of Documents. The motion is granted because Shirian failed to respond to the discovery requests despite a three-month extension of time. The Court orders Shirian to serve verified, written, code-compliant responses to the discovery requests within 15 days of notice. The Court also notes that Shirian did not request sanctions and that Dominguez does not need to show anything more to demonstrate the failure to respond to the discovery requests.
