Background
On May 10, 2021, Maurice Sr. Stewart and Stephanie Stewart
filed the complaint in this matter asserting one cause of action for negligence
against Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (“Metro”) and
Does 1 through 20, arising out of a bus accident on May 1, 2020.  Plaintiffs allege that they were passengers
on a Metro bus and were injured when the driver of the bus stopped suddenly,
causing them to “slam[] their back and shoulders into the bus wall.”  (Complaint, ¶ 10.)
Metro filed an answer to the complaint on November 30, 2021.
On January 10, 2024, Plaintiff Stephanie Stewart (“Plaintiff”)
served discovery on Metro, including Form Interrogatories (Set Two), Special
Interrogatories (Set Two), Requests for Production (Set Two), and Requests for
Admission (Set Two).  (Yadegari Decls., ¶
2 & Exhs. A.)  Metro provided
responses that were signed by counsel but not verified.  (Id., ¶ 3 & Exh. B.)
Plaintiff satisfied the requirements for an Informal Discovery
Conference (IDC). 
Plaintiff filed these four motions on May 20, 2024, seeking
further responses as well as sanctions. 
Metro filed its opposition on May 29, June 3, June 6, and June 10.  No replies have been filed.
The motion relating to the form interrogatories came on for
hearing on June 12.  After hearing
argument, the Court continued that hearing to June 24.
Legal Standard
Interrogatories
“On receipt of a response to interrogatories, the propounding
party may move for an order compelling a further response if the propounding
party deems that any of the following apply: (1) An answer to a particular
interrogatory is evasive or incomplete. (2) An exercise of the option to
produce documents under Section 2030.230 is unwarranted or the required
specification of those documents is inadequate. (3) An objection to an
interrogatory is without merit or too general.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (a).)
Notice of a motion to compel further responses must be given
“within 45 days of the service of the verified response, or any supplemental
verified response, or on or before any specific later date to which the
propounding party and the responding party have agreed in writing.” (Id.,
subd. (c).)
A motion to compel further responses must be accompanied by a meet-and-confer
declaration and a separate statement or, in the discretion of the Court, a
“concise outline of the discovery request and each response in dispute.” (Id.,
subd. (b)(1) & (b)(2); Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345.)
“The court shall
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)
against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a
motion to compel a further response to interrogatories, unless it finds that
the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that
other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (d).)
Requests for
Production
“On receipt of a response to a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling, the demanding party may move for an order compelling
further response to the demand if the demanding party deems that any of the
following apply: (1) A statement of compliance with the demand is
incomplete.  (2) A representation of
inability to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive.  (3) An objection in the response is without
merit or too general.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.310, subd. (a).)
Notice of a motion to compel further responses must be given
“within 45 days of the service of the verified response, or any supplemental
verified response, or on or before any specific later date to which the
propounding party and the responding party have agreed in writing.” (Id.,
subd. (c).)
A motion to compel further responses must set forth specific
facts showing good cause for the discovery and must be accompanied by a meet-and-confer
declaration and a separate statement or, in the discretion of the Court, a
“concise outline of the discovery request and each response in dispute.” (Id.,
subd. (b)(1)-(3); Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345.)
“[T]he court shall
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)
against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a
motion to compel further response to a demand, unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (h).)
Requests for
Admission
“On receipt of a response to requests for admissions, the
party requesting admissions may move for an order compelling a further response
if that party deems that either or both of the following apply: (1) An answer
to a particular request is evasive or incomplete. (2) An objection to a
particular request is without merit or too general.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.290, subd.
(a).)
Notice of a motion to compel further responses must be given
“within 45 days of the service of the verified response, or any supplemental
verified response, or any specific later date to which the requesting party and
the responding party have agreed in writing.” (Id., subd. (c).)
A motion to compel further responses must be accompanied by a meet-and-confer
declaration and a separate statement or, in the discretion of the Court, a
“concise outline of the discovery request and each response in dispute.” (Id.,
subd. (b)(1) & (b)(2); Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345.)
“The court shall
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)
against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a
motion to compel further response, unless it finds that the one subject to the
sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make
the imposition of the sanction unjust.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.290, subd. (d).)
Sanctions
In Chapter 7 of the
Civil Discovery Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030, subdivision (a)
provides, in pertinent part, that the court may impose a monetary sanction ordering
that any person “engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any
attorney advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses, including
attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.” A “misuse of
the discovery process” includes (among other things) failing to respond or to
submit to an authorized method of discovery; making, without substantial
justification, an unmeritorious objection to discovery; making an evasive
response to a discovery request; disobeying a court order to provide discovery;
and making or opposing, unsuccessfully, a motion to compel without substantial
justification. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subds. (d)-(h).)
Discussion
The Court begins with a threshold issue.  
Metro’s responses were initially unverified.  Although it is not clear in the Oppositions,
it appears that Metro is representing that verifications for all discovery responses
were provided on or shortly after May 29, 2024. 
The Court has reviewed the responses based upon the assumption that the
verifications have been provided; if that is incorrect, of course Metro must
provide verifications, as unverified responses are the equivalent of no
response at tall.
Form Interrogatories 
Plaintiff seeks an order compelling Metro to provide a further
response to Form Interrogatories 12.6 and 17.1 (relating to Requests for
Admission Nos. 15, 20, 21, 33, 37, 40, and 42).
Metro argues, first, that Plaintiff’s entire motion is untimely.  Notice of a motion to compel further
responses must be given no more than 45 days after service of the verified
responses.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300,
subd. (c).)  Failure to give such notice
in a timely fashion results in a waiver of any right to compel further
responses.  (Ibid.)  The waiver cannot be avoided simply by
re-propounding the same discovery a second time.  (Professional Career Colleges, Magna
Institute, Inc. v. Super. Ct. (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 490, 494; 2 Weil &
Brown, California Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (2024),
¶ 8:1150.5.)
Here, Plaintiff served Form Interrogatories (Set One) in
August 2022.  (Wyatt Decl., ¶¶ 2-3 &
Exh. 1.)  Plaintiff’s Form
Interrogatories included both Nos. 12.6 and 17.1.  (Id., ¶ 3 & Exh. 1.)  Metro served responses to the Form
Interrogatories, including Nos. 12.6 and 17.1, on September 9, 2022, and
followed up with verifications on September 14, 2022.  (Id., ¶¶ 4-5 & Exhs.
2-3.)  The verified response to Form
Interrogatory No. 17.1 specifically responded as to Plaintiff’s Requests for
Admission Nos. 1 through 23.  (Id.,
Exh. 2, at p. 24.)  
Accordingly, the Court denies (1) Plaintiff’s motion to compel
a further response to Form Interrogatory 12.6, and (2) Plaintiff’s motion to
compel a further response to Form Interrogatory 17.1 as it relates to Requests
for Admission Nos. 15, 20, and 21.  As to
those discovery requests, Metro served verified responses in September 2022,
and Plaintiff did not move to compel within the statutory time period.  This results in a waiver of any right to
bring a motion to compel further responses under Code of Civil Procedure
section 2030.300, subdivision (c).  (The
waiver, of course, does not prevent Plaintiff from propounding a supplemental
interrogatory under section 2030.070.) 
There has been no showing of waiver, however, regarding Form
Interrogatory 17.1 as it relates to Requests for Admission Nos. 33, 37, 40, and
42.  The responses provided in September
2022 covered only Requests for Admission Nos. 1 through 23.  (Wyatt Decl., Exh. 2, at p. 24.)
With regard to the responses to Form Interrogatory 17.1 relating
to Requests for Admission Nos. 33, 37, 40, and 42, the Court has reviewed the
responses and determines that Metro has provided code compliant responses to
subparts (a) and (b).  But Metro has not
provided code compliant responses to subparts (c) and (d).  
No information at all is provided in response to subpart (c).  That is not a straightforward and complete
response, as required.
As to subpart (d) Metro states only that the responsive
documents “include” certain categories of items.  That is also not a straightforward and
complete response; to the contrary, it is evasive and at least potentially
incomplete.
Accordingly, the Court (1) denies Plaintiff’s motion to compel
a further response to subparts (a) and (b) of Form Interrogatory 17.1 as it
relates to Requests for Admission Nos. 33, 37, 40, and 42; and (2) grants Plaintiff’s
motion to compel a further response to subparts (c) and (d) of Form
Interrogatory 17.1 as it relates to Requests for Admission Nos. 33, 37, 40, and
42.  
Special Interrogatories 
Plaintiff seeks an order compelling Metro to provide a further
response to Special Interrogatories (Set Two) Nos. 1, 3-6, 10, 13, 15-16, and
18-49.
Metro argues that the interrogatories are excessive in number:
Plaintiff’s first set of Special Interrogatories were numbered 1-52, and with
the second set Plaintiff has now propounded a total of 102 special
interrogatories.  But Plaintiff’s counsel
served a declaration of necessity under Code of Civil Procedure section
2030.050, and Metro did not seek a protective order under section 2030.090, subdivision
(b)(2).  (See 2 Weil & Brown,
California Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (2023), ¶¶ 8:954-956.1)
Metro also argues that some or all of the interrogatories at
issue are unduly burdensome, seek irrelevant information, are improperly
compound, violate privacy rights, and are improperly being used to compel
production of documents.
Nos. 1, 37
These interrogatories seek information regarding safety devices
on the bus at issue.  As to the objection
of overbreadth in time, the Court interprets the interrogatories as referring
to devices on the bus at issue at the time of the accident and, on that basis,
the objections are OVERRULED.  Plaintiff’s
other objections are OVERRULED.  The
motions to compel are GRANTED.
No. 3
This interrogatory seeks information regarding the process for
selecting, training and evaluating bus drivers. 
Metro does not object on the basis of the interrogatory being impermissibly
compound.  As to the objection of overbreadth
in time, the Court interprets the interrogatory as referring to processes in
place at the time of the accident and, on that basis, the objection is
OVERRULED.  Plaintiff’s other objections
are OVERRULED.  The motions to compel are
GRANTED.
No. 4
This interrogatory seeks information about disciplinary actions
taken against the bus driver within the two years prior to the incident.  Metro’s objection on the basis of its
employee’s privacy is SUSTAINED.  The
interrogatory, as framed, is so broad that it would encompass discipline that
is wholly unrelated to the incident (including, for example, discipline for
uniform violations).  The motion to compel
is DENIED.
Nos. 5, 6, 26. 31, 40
These interrogatories seek information regarding the bus
driver’s training (No. 5), individuals who have reported safety concerns about
the bus driver (No. 6), and Metro’s policies and procedures (Nos. 26, 31, 40).  Plaintiff’s objections are OVERRULED.  The motions to compel are GRANTED.
Nos. 10, 27
These interrogatories seeks information regarding safety modifications
to other Metro buses and Metro’s protocols for responding to passenger
complaints.  The objection based on undue
burden is SUSTAINED.  The motion to
compel is DENIED.
No. 13
This interrogatory seeks information regarding Metro’s protocol
for responding to passenger injuries.  As
to the objection of overbreadth in time, the Court interprets the interrogatory
as referring to protocols in place at the time of the accident and, on that
basis, the objection is OVERRULED.  Plaintiff’s
other objections are OVERRULED.  The
motions to compel are GRANTED.
Nos. 15, 16, 19, 22, 23, 30, 34, 35, 36, 45, 47
These interrogatories are impermissibly compound, and
Plaintiff’s objections on that basis are SUSTAINED.  The motions to compel are DENIED.
Nos. 18, 20, 21, 24, 25, 33, 41, 44, 46, 48
These interrogatories seek information regarding the
circumstances leading to the accident, the systems on the bus, maintenance of
the bus, potential witnesses, and Metro’s response to the incident.  Plaintiff’s objections are OVERRULED.  The motions to compel are GRANTED.
Nos. 28, 29, 39, 43
These interrogatories seek information regarding the name and
contact information of Metro employees involved in the denial of Plaintiff’s
claim, the claims of others, and Metro’s claim processing procedures.  Plaintiff’s objections on the ground that
this information is not relevant and not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery
of admissible evidence are SUSTAINED.  The
motions to compel are DENIED. 
No. 32, 38
These interrogatories ask Metro to produce documents.  That is not the proper function of interrogatories.  Plaintiff’s objections on this ground are SUSTAINED.  The motions to compel are DENIED.
No. 42
This interrogatory seeks information relating to potential
insurance coverage.  This information is
discoverable.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2017.210.)  Plaintiff’s objections are OVERRULED.  The motions to compel are GRANTED.
No. 49
This interrogatory is incomplete and incomprehensible.  The motion to compel is DENIED.
Requests for Production
Plaintiff seeks an order compelling Metro to provide a further
response to Requests for Production (Set Two) Nos. 50-92.
No. 50
This request seeks documents recording the incident.  To the extent that Metro contends that some responsive
documents exist and are subject to attorney-client privilege, work product protection,
or some other protection from disclosure, those documents may be listed on a
privilege log that meets all applicable legal requirements.  To the extent that Metro contends that this
is a “blind claim,” and Metro has no responsive documents, then Metro must
provide a verified, code complaint response under Code of Civil Procedure
section 2031.320.  Metro’s other
objections are OVERRULED.  Good cause has
been shown.  The motion is GRANTED.
Nos. 51, 53, 72, 73, 74, 75, 89, 90, 91, 92
Metro’s objections on the ground that these requests are unintelligible,
do not reasonably particularize the items sought to be produced, and/or are
overly broad and unduly burdensome are SUSTAINED.  The motions are DENIED.
Nos. 52, 55, 80, 81, 83
These requests seek documents regarding the training of the driver
or the maintenance and inspection of the bus involved in the incident.  Metro’s objections are OVERRULED.  Good cause has been shown.  The motions are GRANTED.
Nos. 54, 56, 58-71, 82, 84-88
These requests do not appear in the Separate Statement.  No good cause shown.  On these grounds, the motions to compel are
DENIED.
Nos. 57, 76, 77, 78
These requests seek documents regarding the claim Plaintiff filed
with Metro or Metro’s investigation of the incident.  To the extent that Metro contends that some responsive
documents are subject to attorney-client privilege, work product protection, or
some other protection from disclosure, those documents may be listed on a
privilege log that meets all applicable legal requirements.  Metro’s other objections are OVERRULED.  Good cause has been shown.  The motions are GRANTED.
Requests for Admission
Plaintiff seeks an order compelling Metro to provide a further
response to Requests for Admission (Set Two) Nos. 1, 4, 8-13, 18-19, 22, 28-29,
and 35.
Metro argues that the requests for admission are excessive in
number: Plaintiff’s first set of Requests for Admission were numbered 1-23, and
with the second set Plaintiff has now propounded a total of 67 requests for
admission.  But Plaintiff’s counsel
served a declaration of necessity under Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.050,
and Metro did not seek a protective order under section 2033.080, subdivision (b)(2).  (See 2 Weil & Brown, California Practice Guide:
Civil Procedure Before Trial (2023), ¶¶ 8:1353.1)
Nos. 1, 8, 9, 10, 22, 35
These requests are impermissibly compound, and Plaintiff’s objections
on that basis are SUSTAINED.  The motions
to compel are DENIED.
Nos. 4, 11, 12, 13, 18, 19, 28, 29
These requests relate to the circumstances of the incident and
Plaintiff’s injuries.  The objections to
these requests are OVERRULED.  The
motions to compel are GRANTED.
Sanctions
The Court grants in part and denies in part Plaintiff’s
requests for sanctions.  
As to the motions to compel further responses to the special
interrogatories and requests for production, the requests for sanctions are
denied.  The Court is granting these
motions in part and denying them in part; as to those portions of the motion that
Metro has unsuccessfully opposed, the Court finds that Metro acted with substantial
justification.
As to the motions to compel further responses to the form
interrogatories and the requests for admission, the requests for sanctions are
granted in part.  The Court is granting these
motions in part and denying them in part, but at the end of the day Metro has
in part unsuccessfully opposed these two motions to compel further responses.  As to those parts of those motion, sanctions
are authorized under Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.300, subdivision (d), and section 2033.290, subdivision
(d), as Metro has not acted with substantial justification in
opposing those parts of those motions, and awarding sanctions would not be
unjust.  Full, not partial, compliance
with the Civil Discovery Act is expected and required.  For those parts of those motions, the Court
sets sanctions for each motion in the amount of $525, calculated based on 1.5
hours of attorney work multiplied by counsel’s reasonable billing rate of $350
per hour for this work.  (See Yadegari
Decls., ¶ 6.)
