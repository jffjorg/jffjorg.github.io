And here is the English-text summary:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling denying two motions to compel depositions. The motions were filed by Plaintiff Deshawnbai Davis in a case arising from a motor vehicle accident on September 12, 2021. The first motion seeks to compel Defendant Dejanae Zelaya to appear for deposition, which she failed to do as ordered by the Court. The second motion seeks to compel Dr. David Main, a non-party witness, to appear for deposition. The Court previously granted a motion to compel Zelaya's deposition, but denied the first motion to compel Dr. Main's deposition due to the failure to serve him personally. The Court has denied both motions, citing the failure to comply with the California Rules of Court and the Civil Discovery Act.
