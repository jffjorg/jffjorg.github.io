And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants Defendant's motion to continue trial, but only in part. The judge finds that Defendant has a right to have its timely filed motion for summary judgment heard before trial, and therefore sets the hearing for April 21, 2025. The judge also advances the date of the hearing on Defendant's motion for summary judgment and continues the trial date to a later date. The judge denies Plaintiffs' alternative request for a special setting of the hearing prior to the current trial date. The judge orders the moving party to give notice of the new trial date and resets all discovery deadlines accordingly.
