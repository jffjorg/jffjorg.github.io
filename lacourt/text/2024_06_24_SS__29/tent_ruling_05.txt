Background
These two consolidated cases arise

In the lead case, Case No.
22STCV29998, Michelle Soto (“Soto”) filed a complaint on September 14. 2022, against
Joseph Shirian (“Shirian”), Blas Alducin Dominguez (“Dominguez”), and Does 1
through 50, asserting causes of action for motor vehicle negligence and general
negligence. 
 
On September 29, 2022, Dominguez filed
an answer and a cross-complaint against Shirian and Roes 1 through 10. 
 
On December 14, 2022, Shirian filed
an answer and a cross-complaint against Soto, Dominguez, Mariana Diazzamora (“Diazzamora”),
and Roes 1 through 25.
 
In the second filed case, Case No.
22VECV02403, Shirian filed a complaint on December 14, 2022, against Soto,
Dominguez, Diazzamora, and Does 1 through 50, asserting causes of action for motor
vehicle negligence and general negligence.
 
On November 9, 2023, Dominguez and
Diazzamora filed an answer and a cross-complaint against Shirian and Roes 1
through 25.
 
The two cases were related on July
28, 2023, and consolidated on May 7, 2024.
 
As it relates to the matters before
the Court and set for hearing on June 24, 2024, Dominguez served Shirian with Form
Interrogatories (Set One) on December 6, 2023, and on the same day Dominguez
and Diazzamora served Shirian with Special Interrogatories (Set One) and
Requests for Production (Set One). 
(Goodwin Decls., ¶ 2 & Exhs. A.) 
Notwithstanding a three-month extension of time, Shirian never responded
to the discovery.  (Id., ¶¶ 3-4.)
 
On May 24, 2024, Dominguez filed these
three motion to compel Shirian to respond to the discovery requests.  
 
No opposition has been filed.
 
Legal Standard
 
A party must respond to interrogatories within 30 days
after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom
interrogatories are directed does not provide a timely response, the
propounding party may move for an order compelling response to the
interrogatories. (Id., § 2030.290, subd. (b).) There is no time limit
for a motion to compel initial responses, and no meet and confer efforts are
required. (See id., § 2030.290; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc.
v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor
must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who
fails to provide a timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).) 
When a party moves to compel initial responses to
interrogatories, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the motion], unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd.
(c).)
A party must respond to requests for production of
documents within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260,
subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for production of documents are directed
does not provide timely responses, the requesting party may move for an order
compelling response to the demand. (Id., § 2031.300, subd. (b).) There
is no time limit for a motion to compel initial responses, and no meet and
confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare
Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th
390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who
fails to provide a timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).) 
When
a party moves to compel initial responses to requests for production, “the
court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes [the motion], unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (c).) Requests for admission may be
propounded on a party without leave of court 10 days after the service of the
summons on, or appearance by that party, whichever occurs first. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.020(b).)
In Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery
Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision (d), defines
“[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to respond to or to
submit to an authorized method of discovery.” 
Where a party or attorney has engaged in misuse of the discovery
process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in the amount of “the
reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result
of that conduct.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2023.020, subd. (a).)
