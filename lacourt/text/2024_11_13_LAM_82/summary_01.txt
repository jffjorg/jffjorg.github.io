And here is the summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling denies Petitioner Ekaterina Petrushkina's petition for writ of mandate. The Petitioner argues that there was no reasonable cause to arrest her, that the chemical test admonishment was defective, and that the DMV hearing lacked due process because there was no prosecutor, only a hearing officer, and the hearing officer was biased.

The judge finds that the officers had reasonable cause to arrest Petitioner for driving under the influence based on the evidence that Petitioner drove off the street and hit a wood utility pole, and that the officers properly advised her of her obligation to take a chemical test. The judge also finds that Petitioner refused to take the test multiple times, citing need for an attorney and wanting to take her daughter to her mother's house.

The judge concludes that the DMV hearing did not lack due process and that there is no evidence that the hearing officer was biased. The judge orders that the petition for writ of mandate is denied.
