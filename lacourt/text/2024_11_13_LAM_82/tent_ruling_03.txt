Case No.
24STCV20679
[Tentative] Order
Denying Writ of Attachment
 
            Plaintiff
Sysco, Inc. (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Undefeated Hospitality
Group, Inc. dba “Mr. Charlie” (“Defendant”) on August 14, 2024.  Plaintiff has not served the summons and
complaint within 60 days, as required by California Rules of Court, rule
3.110.  Therefore, the court (Scheper,
J.) issued an order to show cause why this case should not be dismissed. 
 
            Now,
Plaintiff seeks a writ of attachment in the amount of $55,213.50 against
Defendant.  Plaintiff filed a “Notice of
Application and Hearing” on August 20, 2024. 
However, Plaintiff has not served the notice, the application, or the
supporting pleadings.  Therefore, the
application is denied without prejudice. 

            
            The court’s
clerk shall serve this order upon Plaintiff’s counsel.  Further notice is not required.
