[1] Petitioner argues
that her watery eyes and flush face was the result of the air bag’s
deployment.  Petitioner also argues that
the officers misinterpreted a statement by her daughter suggesting that she had
been drinking.  The court need not reach
these issues.  Even if the absence of
this evidence, there was a sufficient basis to arrest Petitioner, as
discussed.
