And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's application for a writ of attachment in the amount of $55,213.50 against the defendant. The plaintiff filed the action on August 14, 2024, but failed to serve the summons and complaint within the required 60 days, as mandated by California Rules of Court, rule 3.110. As a result, the court issued an order to show cause why the case should not be dismissed. The plaintiff then filed a "Notice of Application and Hearing" on August 20, 2024, but failed to serve it, along with the application and supporting pleadings. Therefore, the application for a writ of attachment is denied without prejudice.
