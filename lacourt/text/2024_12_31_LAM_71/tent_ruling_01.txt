Inc. to Plaintiff’s Request for Production of Documents (Set Two), Request Nos.
21-34 and related documents is granted.

Plaintiff Adam
Cohen’s request for sanctions on his motion to compel further responses against

severally is granted in the reduced amount of $3,310.00.  Sanctions are payable within 20 days.
 
Plaintiff Adam Cohen (“Cohen”)
(“Plaintiff”) moves to compel further responses from Defendant Yoon Chung Design, Inc. (“YCD”) (“Defendant”) move to his Request for
Production of Documents (Set Two) (“RFP 2”). 
(Notice Motion, pg. 1; C.C.P. §§2031.010 et seq., 2023.010 et seq.)  Plaintiff requests sanctions against YCD and
its counsel of record, jointly and severally, in the amount of $4,310.00.  (Notice Motion, pg. 1.)
 
CRC Violation
CRC Rule 2.109 provides, “[e]ach page
must be numbered consecutively at the bottom unless a rule provides otherwise
for a particular type of document. The page numbering must begin with the first
page and use only Arabic numerals (e.g., 1, 2, 3). The page number may be
suppressed and need not appear on the first page.”  (CRC, Rule 2.109.)
          Plaintiff’s
motion fails to include page numbers on each page of his memorandum after page
2, in violation of CRC Rule 2.109.
 
Meet and Confer
On September 18, 2024, this Court held
an IDC, wherein this Court deemed the issues discussed in the IDC unresolved.  (9/18/24 Minute Order.)  Therefore, the Court will consider the
instant motion.
Background
          On
July 3, 2024, Plaintiff propounded his RFP on YCD.  (Decl. of Chen ¶2, Exh. A.)  On or about August 6, 2024, YCD served its
response to Plaintiff.  (Decl. of Chen ¶3,
Exh. B.)  YCD provided only boilerplate
objections to Request Nos. 21 through 35, and, in response to Request No. 36,
identified only 4 pages of documents which were nonresponsive.  (Decl. of Chen ¶4.)  No privilege log was produced,
notwithstanding Defendant’s objections based on privacy.  (Decl. of Chen ¶4.)
          Plaintiff
filed the instant motion on October 15, 2024. 
YCD filed its opposition on December 17, 2024.  Plaintiff filed his reply on December 23,
2024.
 
          Discussion
The Civil Discovery Act provides that a
“party may obtain discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, that is
relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action or to the
determination of any motion made in that action, if the matter either is itself
admissible in evidence or appears reasonably calculated to lead to the
discovery of admissible evidence.”  (C.C.P. §2031.010.) 
“[E]vidence is ‘relevant’ if it might
reasonably assist a party in evaluating its case, preparing for trial, or
facilitating a settlement.”  (Moore v.
Mercer (2016) 4 Cal.App.5th 424, 447.)  A party is entitled to discover “any matter,
not privileged, that is relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending
action.”  (C.C.P. §2017.010.)  The phrase “subject matter” is broader than
relevancy to the issues (which determines admissibility of evidence at trial).  (Bridgestone/Firestone, Inc. v. Superior
Court (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1384, 1392.)  Courts have uniformly held that, for discovery
purposes, information should be regarded as “relevant” to the subject matter if
it might reasonably assist a party in evaluating the case, preparing for trial,
or facilitating settlement.  (Stewart
v. Colonial Western Agency, Inc. (2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 1006, 1013.)
Plaintiff moves to compel further responses
from YCD as to RFP Request Nos. 21-34.  The
subject discovery requests concern documents relating to communications,
business transactions, payments, and agreements between YCD and non-party
Peloton Interactive, Inc. (“Peloton”) (Nos. 21-25, 31, and 33), and between YCD
and non-party Carbon 38, Inc. (“Carbon”) (Nos. 26-30, 32, and 34).  (See Motion SS, pgs. 2-4.)
These requests seek production of
documents concerning YCD’s communications with third parties, including any communications
or agreements that may have existed between YCD and the third parties, any
services rendered, payments made, and sales or purchase orders exchanged.  The requested documents are relevant to
Plaintiff’s allegations that YCD breached the LLC Agreement with Plaintiff by
violating the non-compete clause and breached its alleged fiduciary duty owed
to Plaintiff and ONA by misappropriating the business of the third parties.  (See TAC ¶¶81, 102-104 Exh. A.)  Defendant’s boilerplate objections are not
proper.  (See Korea Data Systems Co.
v. Superior Court (1997) 51 Cal.App.4th 1513, 1516 [stating boilerplate
objections “[lack] . . . the specificity the statute mandates” and their use
may be sanctionable].)  To the extent
documents are withheld due to an objection, the response must (1) identify with
particularity the document to which the objection is being made; and (2) set
forth the grounds for the objection, including the production of a privilege
log if the objection is based on privilege.  (C.C.P. §2031.240.)
YCD claims that the requested records
are private and has refused to produce a single responsive document based on
this objection, notwithstanding Plaintiff and Defendant entered into a
stipulated protective order, which this Court entered on October 10, 2023. YCD
has no Constitutional right to privacy as a corporation.  (Ameri-Medical Corp. v. Workers’
Compensation Appeals Board (1996) 42 Cal.App.4th 1260, 1287 [stating entities
have “no standing to assert a constitutional right to privacy”].)  There is no basis for YCD’s objection based
on privacy.
Accordingly, YCD is compelled to produce
Code-compliant responses to RFP Nos. 21-34 and corresponding documents within 30
days of this ruling.  To the extent any
responses are protected by privilege, YCD is to produce a privilege log.
 
Sanctions
Under C.C.P. §2031.300(c), “[t]he court
may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails to obey the order
compelling a response, the court may make those orders that are just, including
the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in
addition to this sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010).”  (C.C.P. §2031.300(c).)
Plaintiff requests sanctions in the
total amount of $4,310.00 against Defendant and its counsel of record.  (Motion, pg. 9.)  The Court grants Plaintiff’s request in the
reduced amount of $3,310.00, in light of the fact that Plaintiff cannot recover
attorneys’ fees for time spent meeting and conferring.  The Court calculates sanctions as follows:
([3 hours drafting the instant motion +
3.5 hours reviewing the opposition, preparing a reply, and attending the
hearing] x $500/hour) + $60.00 filing fee = $3,310.00
Sanctions in the amount of $3,310.00 are
payable by YCD and its counsel of record, jointly and severally, within 20 days
of this ruling.
 
Conclusion
Plaintiff’s motion to compel further
responses from YCD to RFP Nos. 21-34 and related documents is granted. 
YCD is to provide further Code-Compliant responses within 30 days.  To the extent any responses are protected by
privilege, YCD is to produce a privilege log.
          Plaintiff’s
request for sanctions against YCD and its counsel of record, jointly and
severally, is granted in the reduced amount of $3,310.00.  Sanctions are payable within 20 days.
Moving Party is to give notice of this ruling.
