And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to compel responses from the defendant, M. Pernecky Management Corp., after the defendant provided verified responses to special interrogatories on January 26, 2024. However, the judge has imposed sanctions on the defendant and its counsel in the amount of $310, consisting of one hour of the plaintiff's counsel's hourly rate of $250 and a $60 filing fee, payable within 20 days of the date of the order. The sanctions are for the defendant's failure to provide timely responses to the plaintiff's discovery requests, despite the fact that the requests were served on August 7, 2023.
