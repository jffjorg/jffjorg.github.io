On June 7, 2023, Plaintiff RSP
Holdings, Inc. (“RSP”) filed this action against defendants Rebecca Swimmer
(“Swimmer”) and Sterling Vet Corp. (“Sterling Vet”) to recover $216,743.70 for construction
services provided to build a pet hospital. 
On September 28, 2023, Swimmer and
Sterling Vet filed a cross-complaint against RSP for breach of contract and
negligence alleging that RSP performed defective work, made illegitimate change
orders which caused construction delays, and did not complete the project. As a
result, Swimmer and Sterling allegedly sustained damages of $775,000 in change
orders on a $1.4 million base contract, $3 million for costs related to the
delays, $150,000 for completion costs, and $175,000 for repair costs. Swimmer
and Sterling Vet also filed a claim for recovery on a contractor’s license bond
in the amount of $15,000, which is asserted against RSP and moving party, Wesco
Insurance Company (“Wesco”). 
On January 8, 2024, Wesco filed this
motion for interpleader and request for attorney’s fees. Wesco seeks to
interplead funds of $7,500, less attorneys’ fees and costs of $2,645. The
motion is unopposed.
A complaint in interpleader allows an
obligor to require parties with conflicting claims to litigate those claims
against each other, instead of against the obligor. (Code Civ. Proc., § 386,
subd. (b).) The purpose of interpleader is to prevent a multiplicity of suits
and double vexation. (City of Morgan Hill v. Brown (1999) 71 Cal.App.4th
1114, 1122.) “Where the only relief sought against one of the defendants is the
payment of a stated amount of money alleged to be wrongfully withheld, such
defendant may, upon affidavit that he is a mere stakeholder with no interest in
the amount or any portion thereof and that conflicting demands have been made
upon him for the amount by parties to the action, upon notice to such parties,
apply to the court for an order discharging him from liability and dismissing
him from the action on his depositing with the clerk of the court the amount in
dispute and the court may, in its discretion, make such order.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 386.5.) A party who follows the procedure under Code of Civil
Procedure, section 386.5, may request costs and reasonable attorney fees
incurred in the action, which the court may award from the amount in dispute
that has been deposited with the court. (Code Civ. Proc., §¿386.6(a).) 
Wesco seeks leave to interplead and
deposit $7,500 because: (1) it is subject to a claim by Sterling and Swimmer
and (2) it is entitled to reimbursement from RSP under the terms of an
indemnity agreement and Civil Code section 2847. Wesco states that the $7,500
to be interpleaded will either be due and owing to RSP or Sterling and Swimmer
because pursuant to Business and Professions Code section 7071.6, the aggregate
liability of a surety like Wesco on claims brought against the bond at issue
shall not exceed $7,500. The remaining $7,500 “shall be reserved exclusively
for the claims of the beneficiaries specified in subdivision (a) of Section
7071.5.” (Bus. and Prof. Code, § 7071.6.) It is undisputed that neither Swimmer
nor Sterling Vet are considered beneficiaries pursuant to Section 7071.5 and
that they are only entitled to $7,500 at most pursuant to Business and
Professions Code section 7071.6(b). 
Additionally with respect to Wesco’s
request for attorneys’ fees and costs, Wesco’s counsel declares that his
billing rate is $215 per hour. (Chang Decl., ¶ 10.) He states that he has spent
6 hours preparing this motion and corresponding papers and anticipates spending
an additional 4 hours to review an opposition brief, prepare a reply brief, and
attend the hearing, for a total of 10 hours. (Chang Decl., ¶ 10.) Counsel’s
declaration does not include a request for costs and does not substantiate the
request in Wesco’s moving papers and notice of non-opposition for $495 in
costs. Therefore, the Court only awards attorneys’ fees. Furthermore, the
motion is unopposed, therefore Wesco’s attorneys’ fees request is reduced to only
include the time spent to prepare this motion. 
Accordingly, Wesco’s motion is GRANTED
and Wesco is ordered to deposit $7,500 with the Court, less $1,290 in
attorneys’ fees. Upon the deposit of said funds, Wesco shall be discharged from
all liability on account of the claims of the parties and dismissed from this
action with prejudice.
