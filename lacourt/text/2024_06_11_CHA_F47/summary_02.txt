And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in response to the demurrer filed by the Defendants to the First Amended Complaint. The judge has overruled the demurrer to the 1st cause of action for breach of written contract, allowing the Plaintiff to proceed with that claim. However, the judge has sustained the demurrer to the 2nd cause of action for financial elder abuse, finding that the Plaintiff has failed to plead sufficient facts to state a claim for financial elder abuse. The judge has given the Plaintiff 30 days to file a Second Amended Complaint to cure the defects in her financial elder abuse cause of action.
