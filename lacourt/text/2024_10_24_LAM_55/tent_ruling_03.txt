NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS:
Hearing on J.G. Wentworth’s Petition for
Approval for Transfer of Payment Rights
 
J.G. Wentworth’s First Amended Petition (“FAP”) for Approval for Transfer of Payment Rights is
granted. 
 
BACKGROUND
By way of this FAP, Petitioner J.G.
Wentworth Originations, LLC (“Petitioner”) seeks a transfer of future life
contingent payments in the aggregate amount of $2,003,080.68, to which Real
Party-In-Interest/Transferor Majahne Williams(“Payee”) is entitled, in exchange
for a one-time payment of $10,500.00, where the discounted present value of the
future payments is $135,206.89. FAP, Ex. A at p. 24.
In 2002, Payee received a structured
settlement arising from wrongful death claim. Declaration of Majahne Williams
(Williams Decl.) ¶ 4. The settlement agreed to by Payee provides for periodic
structured payments, including, but not limited to, 180 monthly Life Contingent
payments of $8,974.90 each, increasing at 3% annually, beginning on April 2,
2070, and ending on March 2, 2085. FAP at p. 2, Ex. C. 
Petitioner now moves for approval of
the transfer of these structured settlement payment rights by Payee to Petitioner
and/or its assigns.
 
LEGAL STANDARD
A transfer of structured settlement payment rights is
void unless a court reviews and approves the transfer and finds that (a) the
transfer of the structured settlement payment rights is fair and reasonable and
in the best interest of the payee, taking into account the welfare and support
of his or his dependents, and (b) the transfer complies with the requirements
of Insurance Code Sections 10134 to 10139.5, will not contravene other
applicable law, and that the court has reviewed and approved the transfer as
provided in Section 10139.5. See § 10137, subds. a)-(b).[1]
The court must make express written findings that “(1)
The transfer is in the best interest of the payee, taking into account the
welfare and support of the payee's dependents. [¶] (2) The payee has been
advised in writing by the transferee to seek independent professional advice
regarding the transfer and has either received that advice or knowingly waived,
in writing, the opportunity to receive the advice. [¶] (3) The transferee has
complied with the notification requirements pursuant to paragraph (2) of subdivision
(f), the transferee has provided the payee with a disclosure form that complies
with Section 10136, and the transfer agreement complies with Sections 10136 and
10138. [¶] (4) The transfer does not contravene any applicable statute or the
order of any court or other government authority. [¶] (5) The payee understands
the terms of the transfer agreement, including the terms set forth in the
disclosure statement required by Section 10136. [¶] (6) The payee understands
and does not wish to exercise the payee's right to cancel the transfer
agreement.” §§ 10139.5(a)(1)-(6).
Notice of hearing on the petition for approval must be
filed and served at least 20 days before the hearing and include all of the
following materials: (1) Prior petitions for approval (whether approved or
denied); (2) Proposed transfer agreement and disclosure form; (3) Listing of
payee's dependents and their ages; (4) Insurance Code section 10136(b)
disclosures; (5) Annuity contract (if available); (6) Qualified assignment
agreement (if available); (7) Underlying structured settlement agreement (if
available); (8) Proof of service (complying with special notice requirements); (8)
Notice to all interested parties; and (9) Notification to counsel obtaining
structured settlement (if less than 5 years ago). §§ 10139.5(f)(2)(A)-(L).
 
ANALYSIS
Section 10139.5, subdivision (b)
In assessing whether a transfer is fair, reasonable,
and in the payee’s best interest, section 10139.5, subdivision (b), requires
courts to “consider the totality of the circumstances, including, but not
limited to,” an enumerated list of factors. § 10139.5, subd. (b), ¶
(1)-(15).  
Applying the relevant factors, the Court concludes
that the transfer is fair, reasonable, and in Payee’s best interest.  
Payee seeks to transfer 180 monthly Life Contingent payments of $8,974.90 each, increasing at 3%
annually, beginning on April 2, 2070, and ending on March 2, 2085. In
exchange, Payee will receive $10,500.00.  
The settlement was entirely monetary and was not
intended to pay for Payee’s future medical care, treatment, or necessary living
expenses. Williams Decl., ¶¶ 6, 7. Payee does not have any court-ordered child
support obligations. Williams Decl., ¶ 8. 
Within the past five years, Payee has had one
attempted transaction involving his structured settlement payment that was
denied. Williams Decl., ¶ 10.
Payee is 27
years old, unmarried, and has no minor children. Williams Decl., ¶ 8. Payee
is unemployed and experiencing financial
hardship. Williams Decl., ¶¶ 8, 11. If approved, he intends to use the money he
receives to cover expenses incurred during his upcoming
move to Chicago and to get caught up on his auto loan payments. Williams
Decl., ¶ 11.
The aggregate value of the future payments is $2,003,080.68; however, payment of the full
value is not guaranteed, and the full amount will only be paid if Payee is
alive in 2085. FAP, at p. 2, Ex. C. Adjusting for the time-value of
money, applying the IRS discount rate of 5.4, the discounted present value of
all future payments is $135,206.89. FAP,
Ex. B. This figure assumes that Payee will live for the full duration of the
annuity.  
While the $10,500.00
Payee will receive is significantly less than the total aggregate value or even
the discounted present value of the annuity, under the circumstances, the Court
finds it fair, reasonable, and in Payee’s best interest. Payee is currently
experiencing financial distress and needs the
funds to cover moving expenses and get caught up on his auto loan payments now,
not in 45 years. According to Petitioner, the purchase price reflects an
effective interest rate of 10.47%.
FAP,
Ex. B. The Court finds the interest rate to be reasonable considering
Petitioner’s assumption of risk that the annuity may not be paid out in full.
Section 10136 Requirements
No direct or indirect transfer of structured
settlement payment rights by a payee to which Section 10136 applies shall be
effective, and no structured settlement obligor or annuity issuer shall be
required to make any payment directly or indirectly to a transferee, unless all
of the provisions of Section 10136 are satisfied. §10136, subd. (a)
First, the transfer agreement satisfies the disclosure
form requirements in section 10136, subdivision (b) because the transfer
agreement is accompanied by a disclosure addressed to Payee containing all the
statutorily required language of section 10136, subdivision (b). See FAP,
Ex. B. 
Second, the transfer agreement satisfies the
transfer-agreement requirements in section 10136, subdivision (c) because the
transfer agreement contains all the necessary language required from this
statutory subdivision. See FAP, Ex. A. 
Third, the transfer agreement does not violate section
10138 as none of the contents prohibited by this statutory section are
contained in the transfer agreement. See § 10136, subd. (d); see also
FAP, Ex. A.
Fourth, Payee has not sought cancellation of the
transfer agreement as of the date of this hearing. See § 10136, subd. (e);
see also Williams Decl., ¶ 14.
Accordingly, the Court finds that Petitioner’s
proposed transfer of Payee’s settlement rights satisfies the requirements of
section 10136, subdivisions (a) through (e).
Section 10139.5, subdivision (c)
“Every petition for approval of a transfer of
structured settlement payment rights, except as provided in subdivision (d),
shall include, to the extent known after the transferee has made reasonable
inquiry with the payee, all of the following: [¶] (1) The payee’s name,
address, and age. [¶] (2) The payee’s marital status, and, if married or
separated, the name of the payee’s spouse. [¶] (3) The names, ages, and place
or places of residence of the payee’s minor children or other dependents, if
any. (4) The amounts and sources of the payee’s monthly income and financial
resources and, if presently married, the amounts and sources of the monthly
income and financial resources of the payee’s spouse. [¶] (5) Whether the payee
is currently obligated under any child support or spousal support order…[¶] (6)
Information regarding previous transfers or attempted transfers…. § 10139.5,
subd. (c).
“[I]nformation required to be included in every
petition for approval of a transfer of structured settlement payment rights
pursuant to paragraphs (2), (3), (4), (5), and (6) of subdivision (c), … shall
be deemed to be included in the petition if it is provided at the scheduled
hearing on the proposed transfer through oral testimony or documentary evidence
filed with the court and made a part of the record consistent with the rules of
evidence and procedure.” § 10139.5, subd. (d).
The Petition includes Payee’s name and age and states
his address will be provided at the hearing. Payee does not have any children. Petitioner
provides that Payee is unemployed but does not otherwise provide any
information on his current financial resources or sources of income. At the
hearing, Petitioners should clarify what sources of income Payee currently has,
if any. Finally, Petitioner provides adequate information summarizing Payees' thirteen
previous transfers of payment rights. FAP at p. 8 fn.1; Williams Decl., ¶ 10.
