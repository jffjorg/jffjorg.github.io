And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is granting the plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal of the action. The plaintiff, Grand Avenue M Urban Housing LLC, brought an action against Corphousing Group Inc. alleging breach of lease. The action was dismissed on May 28, 2024, due to the plaintiff's failure to appear at an Order to Show Cause Re: Dismissal (Settlement). The plaintiff is now seeking to set aside the dismissal, arguing that it was caused by counsel's mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. The judge finds that the plaintiff's failure to appear was indeed caused by counsel's mistake, and therefore grants the motion to set aside the dismissal. The judge will set a new date for the Order to Show Cause Re: Dismissal.
