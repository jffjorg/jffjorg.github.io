Application of Chad Nelson to Appear Pro Hac Vice for Defendants
Texas attorney Chad
Nelson applies for admission pro hac vice for Defendants Biomat
USA, Inc., esa Grifols USA, Inc., Grifols USA, LLC, and Grifols Worldwide
Operations USA, Inc. 
A judge’s determination of whether to grant an
application to appear pro hac vice is evaluated under the
abuse-of-discretion standard. E.g., United States Golf Ass'n v. Arroyo
Software Corp. (1999) 69 Cal.App.4th 607, 624. 
The Court finds that the motion sufficiently complies
with California Rules of Court, rule 9.40, including the applicant’s
declaration addressing the rule elements. Counsel declares that in the past two
years he has not applied to appear pro hac vice in California courts. No reason
appears to deny the application, including because of the absence of any
opposition.
The Court grants the application. The Court sets a
nonappearance re pro hac vice renewal fee as to Darian A. Stanford for October
24, 2025 at 8:30 a.m.
