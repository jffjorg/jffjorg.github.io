And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge is disappointed that the Defendant failed to follow up on commitments made during an Informal Discovery Conference (IDC) held in August. The Defendant's counsel told the Court that they would produce documents responsive to the discovery requests, but never did. The Plaintiff's counsel sent a follow-up email, but did not receive a response. The Judge notes that the Defendant's boilerplate objections are not well-taken, except for some overbroad requests. The motion to compel further responses is granted in part and denied in part. The Defendant must provide verified supplemental responses that are code compliant and produce all responsive documents. The supplemental responses and document production are due 14 days from the hearing date.
