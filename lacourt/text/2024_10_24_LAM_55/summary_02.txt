And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on Keller Williams Realty, Inc.'s motion for summary adjudication. The motion is granted in part and denied in part.

The court finds that Keller Williams Realty, Inc. has met its initial burden of providing evidence of a complete defense to liability. However, the court also finds that there are triable issues of fact regarding the level of control Keller Williams Realty, Inc. had over its franchisee, Marina Brokerage Partners, Inc.

The court also finds that there are triable issues of fact regarding ostensible agency, including whether Keller Williams Realty, Inc. intended to create an agency relationship with Marina Brokerage Partners, Inc. and whether a reasonable person would have believed that Marina Brokerage Partners, Inc. was Keller Williams Realty, Inc.'s agent.

As for the negligence claim, the court grants summary adjudication as to the personal injury cause of action, but denies it as to the remaining damages claims. The court finds that the statute of limitations has not run on the negligence claim, but that the claim is not barred by the discovery rule.

Finally, the court denies Keller Williams Realty, Inc.'s motion for summary adjudication on the fraudulent misrepresentation claim, finding that there are triable issues of fact regarding what representations were made to the plaintiff by the agent.
