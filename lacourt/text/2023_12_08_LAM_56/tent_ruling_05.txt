MOVING PARTY: Leonard G. Cruz (“Cruz”)
 
On
November 13, 2023, Cruz filed a motion to be relieved as counsel (the “Motion”)
for Plaintiff Worldwide ATM, Inc. (“Plaintiff”).  The Motion is compliant with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362.  The Motion is unopposed.  Any opposition papers were required to have
been filed and served at least nine court days before the hearing under
California Code of Civil Procedure section 1005, subdivision (b).
 
DISCUSSION
The
court has discretion on whether to allow an attorney to withdraw, and a motion
to withdraw will not be granted where withdrawal would prejudice the
client.  (Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915.)  
 
 
In
support of the Motion, Cruz declares that the attorney-client relationship has
broken down, which resulted in Plaintiff terminating Cruz on July 27,
2023.  The Court finds this to be an
adequate basis for withdrawal.  For this
reason and because it is unopposed, the Court GRANTS the Motion.  (Sexton
v. Superior Court (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.)  As a business entity, Plaintiff
must be represented by counsel.  (See Caressa
Camille, Inc. v. Alcoholic Beverage Control Appeals Bd. (2002) 99
Cal.App.4th 1094, 1101.)  The Court will
hold an OSC regarding Plaintiff’s representation on January 9, 2024 at 8:30
a.m. in this department.
 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If
the department does not receive an email and there are no appearances at the
hearing, the motion will be placed off calendar.
