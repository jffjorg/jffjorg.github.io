And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motion to file a third amended complaint (TAC) with five days leave to file. The plaintiff seeks to add Oxnard Tires Inc. (OTI) as a party to the sixth cause of action for fraudulent transfer. The judge finds that the motion sets forth sufficient facts to permit the filing of the TAC and grants the motion, citing California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) sections 473 and 576, and California Rules of Court (CRC) rule 3.1324. The defendant OTI opposes the motion, arguing that it will be prejudiced by the proposed amendment, but provides no specific evidence of the anticipated extra costs to demonstrate prejudice. The judge concludes that the motion is addressed to the trial judge's sound discretion and that the granting of the motion will not prejudice the opposing party.
