[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE: MOTION FOR APPROVAL OF PAGA SETTLEMENT

Time:
  8:30 a.m.
Dept.

MOVING PARTY: Plaintiff 
 
The Court has considered the moving
papers.  No opposition papers were
filed.  Any opposition papers were
required to have been filed and served at least nine court days before the
hearing under California Code of Civil Procedure section 1005,
subdivision (b).
 
BACKGROUND
This
action arises from an employment relationship. 
Plaintiff’s complaint (the “Complaint”) alleges a cause of action
pursuant to the Private Attorneys General Act (“PAGA”) on behalf of Plaintiff
and all other aggrieved employees for various Labor Code violations.  
 
 
 
Plaintiff
and Defendant Lyneer Staffing Solutions, LLC (“Defendant”) (collectively, the
“Parties”) have resolved Plaintiff’s claims and entered into a settlement
agreement (the “Settlement”).  (See Declaration
of J. Kirk Donnelly (“Donnelly Decl.”) ¶ 2, Exhibit 1.)  On November 13, 2023, Plaintiff filed a
motion requesting that the Court approve the terms of the Settlement (the
“Motion”).  
  
DISCUSSION
PAGA settlements are subject to trial court
review and approval, ensuring that any negotiated resolution is fair to those
affected.  (Williams v. Superior Court
(2017) 3 Cal.5th 531, 549, citing Lab. Code § 2699, subd. (l)(2).)  In the context of class action settlements, the
trial court must determine that the settlement is fair, reasonable, and
adequate to all concerned.  (Reed v.
United Teachers Los Angeles (2012) 208 Cal.App.4th 332, 337.)  There is a presumption that the settlement
agreement is fair where: (1) the settlement is reached through arm’s-length
bargaining; (2) investigation and discovery are sufficient to allow counsel and
the trial court to act intelligently; (3) counsel is experienced in similar
litigation; and (4) the percentage of objectors is small.  (Id.)  This standard applies in the context of class
actions and qui tam actions alike.  (See
Gov. Code § 12652, subd. (e)(2) (in qui tam action, a state or political
subdivision may settle the action with the defendant despite objections of the
qui tam plaintiff if the court determines, after a hearing providing the qui
tam plaintiff an opportunity to present evidence, that the proposed settlement
is fair, adequate, and reasonable under all the circumstances).)
 
With respect to PAGA settlement agreements, penalties
recovered by aggrieved employees must be distributed as follows: 75 percent to
the California Labor and Workforce Development Agency (“LWDA”) and 25 percent
to the aggrieved employees.  (Lab. Code §
2699, subd. (i).)  A prevailing employee
is entitled to an award of reasonable attorney’s fees and costs incurred in the
action.  (Lab. Code § 2699, subd.
(g)(1).)  The proposed settlement shall
be submitted to the LWDA at the same time that it is submitted to the court.  (Lab. Code § 2699, subd. (l)(2).)
 
Plaintiff has provided evidence that the
Settlement was submitted to the LDWA.  (See
Donnelly Decl. ¶ 2, Exhibits 4-5.) 
The Settlement provides that Defendant agrees to pay a gross settlement
amount (“GSA”) of $172,500.  The
Settlement allocates a maximum of one third of the GSA to attorney’s fees, and
allows for litigation costs of up to $11,000, and administration expenses of up
to $6,500.  (Donnelly Decl., Exhibit 1 at
§§ 3.1.1-3.1.3.)  The remainder of the
Settlement amount constitutes the PAGA Penalty Fund, 75 percent of which is to
be to be distributed to the LWDA and 25 percent of which is to be distributed
to aggrieved employees on a pro rata basis. 
(Id. at § 3.2.3-3.2.3.1.) 
There are approximately 337 aggrieved employees.  (Id. at § 4.1.)  Plaintiff’s counsel seeks reimbursement for $57,500
in attorney’s fees and $10,164.11 in costs. 
(Donnelly Decl. ¶¶ 25, 40.)  
 
Plaintiff’s claims were disputed throughout
the litigation and the Settlement was entered into after the Parties
participated in a day of mediation.  (Donnelly
Decl. ¶ 8.)  The Settlement releases only
civil penalty claims brought under PAGA and protects the rights of aggrieved
employees to bring their own individual claims. 
(Donnelly Decl. ¶ 13.)  The Motion
and supporting declarations set forth a basis for the attorney’s fees and costs
requested. 
 
            
The Court finds
that the Motion sufficiently demonstrates that the terms of the Settlement,
including the requested attorney’s fees and costs, and administration costs,
are fair and reasonable.  For these
reasons and because it is unopposed, the Court GRANTS the Motion.  (Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.)  
 
Moving party is ordered to give notice of
this ruling. 
 
            Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
 
         Dated
this 8th day of December 2023
