And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the motion for attorney's fees filed by Moving Defendant, Hana Escrow Company, Inc., and has granted the motion in part. Moving Defendant is entitled to recover attorney's fees incurred on appeal, but the amount of fees awarded is limited to $4,000, which represents 10 hours of work at a rate of $400 per hour. The Court has not awarded the full amount of attorney's fees requested, $11,600, due to the lack of evidence presented by Moving Defendant to support its request. The Court has also ordered Moving Defendant to give notice of this ruling.
