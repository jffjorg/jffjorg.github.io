Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the motion filed by the plaintiff seeking approval of the PAGA settlement agreement. The settlement agreement was reached between the plaintiff and the defendant, Lyneer Staffing Solutions, LLC, after a day of mediation. The agreement provides for a gross settlement amount of $172,500, with a maximum of one-third allocated to attorney's fees, and allows for litigation costs of up to $11,000 and administration expenses of up to $6,500. The remaining amount constitutes the PAGA Penalty Fund, with 75% to be distributed to the California Labor and Workforce Development Agency (LWDA) and 25% to be distributed to aggrieved employees on a pro rata basis.

The judge finds that the motion sufficiently demonstrates that the terms of the settlement are fair and reasonable. The settlement releases only civil penalty claims brought under PAGA and protects the rights of aggrieved employees to bring their own individual claims. The motion is unopposed, and the judge grants the motion.
