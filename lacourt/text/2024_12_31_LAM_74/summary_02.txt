And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the plaintiff's motion for leave to file a supplemental complaint. The plaintiff, Saman Seneviratne, seeks to add new causes of action for breach of contract and fraud, as well as correct factual errors and punctuation mistakes. The defendant, Melvin Avanzado and others, opposes the motion, arguing that the plaintiff has not pleaded a claim for breach of contract and fraud. However, the judge finds that the defendant's opposition is unavailing and that the plaintiff's proposed amendments are properly filed as a supplemental complaint. The court grants the plaintiff's motion, allowing the plaintiff to file the supplemental complaint.
