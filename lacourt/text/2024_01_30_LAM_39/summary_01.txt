And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has denied the defendants' motions for a protective order and monetary sanctions, as well as their motion to disqualify the plaintiff's counsel. The Court also discharges the Order to Show Cause re: Contempt. The Court finds that the defendants have not established that the documents at issue were privileged, and that any alleged violation of the court's order was harmless. The Court orders the defendants' counsel to provide notice and file proof of the court's orders. The Court also advances and continues the hearing on the defendants' motion for summary adjudication and the trial setting conference to June 14, 2024.
