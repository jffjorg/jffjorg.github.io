And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion to compel discovery responses from the respondents, Madiha Siddiqui, et al., filed by the petitioner, Progressive West Insurance Company. The respondents were served with the Special Interrogatories, Set One (SROG) on May 3, 2023, but failed to provide any responses. Despite not opposing the motion, the respondents have not provided a good reason for their non-compliance with their discovery obligations. The court finds that the respondents' conduct constitutes an abuse of the discovery process, warranting the imposition of sanctions. As a result, the respondents are ordered to provide verified responses to the SROG within 30 days, and are jointly and severally liable for sanctions in the amount of $689, to be paid to the petitioner within 30 days.
