 Case Number:  23STCP01578    Hearing Date:   January 30, 2024    Dept:  39 Progressive West
Insurance Company v. Madiha Siddiqui, et al.
Case No.
23STCP01578
Motion to Compel
 
            Petitioner
Progressive West Insurance Company (“Petitioner”) moves to compel responses to
Special Interrogatories, Set One (“SROG”) from Respondents and requests
sanctions in the amount of $689 against Respondents and their
counsel-of-record.  The SROG were served
on May 3, 2023.  As of the date of the
motion, no discovery responses have been served.  Respondents do not oppose the motion, and the
record reflects no good cause for their failure to comply with their discovery
obligations.  Respondents’ conduct
reflects an abuse of the discovery process warranting sanctions.  
 
            Based upon
the foregoing, the Court orders as follows:
 
            1.         Petitioner’s motion to compel is
granted.
 
            2.         Respondents shall provide verified
responses, without objections, within thirty (30) days.
 
            3.         The Court orders Respondents and their
counsel, the V&A Law Firm, jointly and severally, to pay sanctions in the
amount of $689, to Petitioner, by and through counsel, within thirty (30) days.
 
            4.         Petitioner shall provide notice and
file proof of such with the Court.
