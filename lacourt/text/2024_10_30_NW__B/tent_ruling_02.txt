 Case Number:  21STCV45158    Hearing Date:   October 30, 2024    Dept:  B CASE NO: 21STCV45158 [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: DEFENDANTS GCMHP, INC. AND VISTA DEL LOMA, LLC’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT Dept. B DATE: OCTOBER 30, 2024 TIME: 8:30 A.M. COMPLAINT FILED: DECEMBER 10, 2021 TRIAL DATE: DECEMBER 16, 2024I. BACKGROUNDOn December 10, 2021, Plaintiff Christian Manuel Esparza, III (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint in the instant action against Defendants GCHMP, Inc. (“GCHMP”) and Vista Del Loma, LLC (“Vista”)(collectively “Defendants”) alleging two causes of action: (1) premises liability and (2) general negligence. Plaintiff alleges that, on or about December 13, 2020, due to Defendants’ negligence in owning and maintaining the premises, he fell while skateboarding on Vista’s property, and therefore sustained injuries.On May 31, 2024, Defendants filed the instant motion for summary judgment on both causes of action.On June 6, 2024, the matter was assigned to the Honorable Judge Moskowitz in Department B of Van Nuys Courthouse East, effective June 24, 2024.On September 20, 2024, Plaintiff filed their opposition.On September 26, 2024, Defendants filed their reply.II. MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENTDefendants move for summary judgment on Plaintiff’s complaint. Defendants allege that Plaintiff’s claims fail as a matter of law because (1) they are barred by primary assumption of risk; (2) Plaintiff cannot prove the essential element of notice; and (3) Defendants had no duty to warn Plaintiff of a trivial defect on their property. (See Motion pp. 4, 7, and 10.)III. LEGAL STANDARDSIn reviewing a motion for summary judgment, the Court must apply a three-step analysis: (1) identify the issues framed by the pleadings; (2) determine whether the moving party has met his or her initial burden; and (3) determine whether the opposition has demonstrated the existence of a triable, material factual issue. (Hinesley v. Oakshade Town Center (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 289, 294.) “[T]he initial burden is always on the moving party to make a prima facie showing that there are no triable issues of material fact.” (Scalf v. D.B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1519.) A defendant moving for summary judgment or summary adjudication has met his or her burden of showing that a cause of action has no merit if the party has shown that one or more elements of the cause of action . . . cannot be established, or that there is a complete defense to the cause of action.” (Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. § 437c(p)(2).)A moving defendant may satisfy the initial burden to show that one or more elements cannot be established by “presenting evidence that conclusively negates an element of the plaintiff's cause of action or by relying on the plaintiff's factually devoid discovery responses to show that the plaintiff does not possess, and cannot reasonably obtain, evidence to establish thatelement.” (Schmidt v. Citibank, N.A. (2018) 28 Cal.App.5th 1109, 1119; Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 856 [It is insufficient for the defendant to merely point out the absence of evidence.]; Gaggero v. Yura (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 884, 891.) The defendant must present evidence… showing that plaintiff does not have and cannot reasonably obtain evidence to support his or her claim.” (Ibid.)Unless and until a defendant meets that burden, the plaintiff has no burden to present controverting evidence. (Consumer Cause, Inc. v. SmileCare (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 454, 468 [“There is no obligation on the opposing party . . . to establish anything by affidavit unless and until the moving party has by affidavit stated facts establishing every element . . . necessary to sustain a judgment in his favor.”].) If a defendant fails to meet that burden, summary judgment must be denied, even if the plaintiff fails to file an opposition and fails to proffer any evidence.On the other hand, if the defendant “has met that burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff . . . to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to the cause of action or a defense thereto.” (CCP § 437c(p)(2).) The plaintiff may not merely rely on allegations or denials in its pleadings to show that a triable issue of material fact exists, but instead “shall set forth the specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact exists as to the cause of action.” (Ibid.) “If the plaintiff cannot do so, summary judgment should be granted.” (Avivi v. Centro Medico Urgente Medical Center (2008) 159 Cal.App.4th 463, 467.)IV. DISCUSSIONEvidentiary ObjectionsDefendants’ September 26, 2024, objections to the declaration of Jeffrey Bonsall (“Bonsall”) are sustained as to Nos. 1, 3, and 4. Bonsall relies on improper hearsay as the basis for his opinions. (Cal. Evid. Code § 801; see People v. Sanchez (2016) 63 Cal.4th 665, 686.)Defendants’ objections are overruled as to No. 2. Bonsall is a Senior Managing Accident Reconstructionist and appropriately lays the foundation for his general expertise regarding physical interactions between shoe soles and roadways. (Bonsall Decl. ¶ 2.)Defendants’ objections to Plaintiff’s May 1, 2023, deposition are sustained as to Nos. 6 and 12 as Plaintiff’s deposition clearly and unequivocally contradicts his prior admissions in discovery responses. Nos. 9 and 11 are also sustained for speculation. Nos. 5, 7, 8, and 10 are overruled.Defendants’ objection to Plaintiff’s deposition transcript of Cathy Sanchez is overruled. Accordingly, objection Nos. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, and 23 are also overruledDefendants’ objection to Plaintiff’s deposition transcript of Katie Morris is overruled. Accordingly, objection Nos. 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, and 38 are also overruled.Defendants’ BurdenDefendants meet their initial burden.Defendants argue that Plaintiff’s causes of action are barred by primary assumption of risk because Plaintiff’s skateboarding carried an inherent risk of incurring injury from falls.The primary assumption of risk doctrine was developed in recognition that some activities are inherently dangerous such that the defendant has no duty to protect the plaintiff from those inherent dangers. (Nalwa v. Cedar Fair, L.P. (2012) 55 Cal.4th 1148, 1154; Knight v. Jewett (1992) 3 Cal.4th 296, 308.) “The primary assumption of risk doctrine rests on a straightforward policy foundation: the need to avoid chilling vigorous participation in or sponsorship of recreational activities by imposing a tort duty to eliminate or reduce the risks of harm inherent in those activities.” (Nalwa, at p. 1156.) “It operates on the premise that imposing such a legalduty ‘would work a basic alteration—or cause abandonment’ of the activity.” (Ibid. (quoting Kahn v. East Side Union High School Dist. (2003) 31 Cal.4th 990, 1003).) “Where the doctrine applies to a recreational activity, operators, instructors and participants in the activity owe other participants only the duty not to act so as to increase the risk of injury over that inherent in the activity.” (Ibid. at 1154 (emphasis in original).) “When the doctrine applies, the plaintiff’s assumption of the risk acts as a complete bar to liability.” (Moser v. Ratinoff (2003) 105 Cal.App.4th 1211, 1219.) “Determining whether the primary assumption of risk doctrine applies is a legal question to be decided by the court.” (Ibid. at 1217.)“[T]he primary assumption of risk doctrine is not limited to activities classified as sports, but applies as well to other recreational activities ‘involving an inherent risk of injury to voluntary participants . . . where the risk cannot be eliminated without altering the fundamental nature of the activity.’” (Nalwa, supra, 55 Cal.4th at p. 1156 (quoting Beninati v. Black Rock City, LLC (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 650, 658).) “Judges deciding inherent risk questions under Knight may consider not only their own or common experience with the recreational activity involved but may also consult case law, other published materials, and documentary evidence introduced by the parties on a motion for summary judgment.” (Ibid. at 1158.)The primary assumption of risk doctrine applies to Plaintiff’s skateboarding. Skateboarding is an activity covered by the primary risk of assumption doctrine as it “is done for enjoyment or thrill, requires physical exertion as well as elements of skill, and involves a challenge containing a potential risk of injury.” (Calhoon v. Lewis (2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 108, 115 [quoting Bjork v. Mason (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 544, 550.]) Imposing a duty on most property owners to “guard against injuries to those voluntarily participating in skateboarding would change the nature of skateboarding.” (Ibid. at p. 117.) “As with skiing, the existence of obstacles in the environment is part of the thrill of the sport.” (Ibid.) The most “obvious risk ofinjury [from skateboarding comes from] the prospect of falling off the board.” (Bertsch v. Mammoth Community Water Dist. (2016) 247 Cal.App.4th 1201, 1209.)Here, it is undisputed that Plaintiff fell while skateboarding. (Undisputed Separate Statement of Fact “USSF” Nos. 1 and 9. [Complaint at p. 4.]) Therefore, Defendants have met their initial burden by showing that Plaintiff was participating in an activity covered by the primary risk of assumption doctrine and, as a result, his claims for premises liability and general negligence are barred.Plaintiff’s BurdenThe burden now shifts to Plaintiff to show a triable issue of fact as to Defendants’ primary assumption of risk defense.Plaintiff argues that the primary assumption of risk doctrine does not cover the underlying incident because, at the time of Plaintiff’s fall, he was using his skateboard as a means of transportation and not to engage in sport or recreational activity. (Plaintiff’s Undisputed Separate Statement of Fact “PUSSF” No. 1, Plaintiff Depo. 32:14-18.) Specifically, Plaintiff claims he used his skateboard to commute from his mother’s residence to his brother’s residence. (Ibid.)Plaintiff uses Bertsch v. Mammoth County Community Water District, supra, 247 Cal.App.4th to support their argument that skateboarding, if used primarily for transportation, does not fall under the primary assumption of risk doctrine. In Bertsch, the Court found that skateboarding was covered by the doctrine when, although decedent was travelling by skateboard to meet his father, decedent elected to skateboard down a large hill for purposes of thrill and sport, thus causing his skateboarding to surpass the primary use of transportation. (Bertsch, at p. 1209.)Here, Plaintiff argument fails as Plaintiff admits to “puddling” on his skateboard at the time of injury. (Defendants’ Exhibit List, Ex. C: Response to Special Interrogatories, Set One, at No. 2.) This response constitutes an admission against Plaintiff’s own interest and therefore has a “very high credibility value.” (D’Amico v. Board of Medical Examiners (1974) 11 Cal.3d 1, 21.) “Accordingly, when such an admission becomes relevant to the determination, on motion for summary judgment, of whether or not there exist triable issues of Fact . . . between the parties, it is entitled to and should receive a kind of deference not normally accorded [to] evidentiary allegations in affidavits.” (Ibid. at 25.) Therefore, Plaintiff fails to set forward evidence of a triable issue of fact as to Defendants’ primary assumption of risk defense.Even assuming, arguendo, Plaintiff was riding his skateboard for transport, Plaintiff still does not provide evidence of a triable issue of fact. Plaintiff alleges Defendants’ negligence caused his fall after he slipped on an oil spill while skateboarding on a road which Defendants maintain. (PUSSF Nos. 3, 9, and 10.) A property owner is not liable for damage caused by a minor, trivial, or insignificant defect in property. (Caloroso v. Hathaway (2004) 122 Cal.App.4th 922, 927.) “If the defect is of such trivial character that it presents no element of conspicuousness or notoriety, its continued existence does not impart constructive notice” to property owners. (Barrett v. City of Claremont (1953) 41 Cal.App.4th 922, 927.) Here, Plaintiff’s only evidence of the alleged oil spill are photographs of roadway discoloration taken two days after Plaintiff’s fall. Therefore, Plaintiff has failed to provide evidence showing that the alleged defect caused by Defendants’ negligence was not trivial or minor in nature.Accordingly, Plaintiff fails to meet their burden.V. CONCLUSIONNo triable issue of material fact exists. Accordingly, Defendants’ motion for summaryjudgment is GRANTED.Moving party is ordered to give notice and submit a proposed Judgment for signature.Dated: October 29, 2024 __________________________________Hon.
