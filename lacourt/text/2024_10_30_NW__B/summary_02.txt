And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is granting the defendants' motion for summary judgment. The plaintiff, Christian Manuel Esparza, III, filed a complaint alleging that the defendants, GCMHP, Inc. and Vista Del Loma, LLC, were negligent in maintaining their property, which caused him to fall while skateboarding. The defendants argued that the plaintiff assumed the risk of injury by skateboarding and that the property was not defective.

The judge found that the primary assumption of risk doctrine applies to the plaintiff's skateboarding, as it is an activity done for enjoyment or thrill, requires physical exertion, and involves a potential risk of injury. The judge also found that the plaintiff's use of his skateboard as a means of transportation does not remove it from the doctrine, as he admitted to "puddling" on his skateboard at the time of the incident.

The judge also found that the alleged oil spill on the road was trivial and minor in nature, and therefore, the defendants did not have a duty to warn the plaintiff of it. The plaintiff failed to provide evidence of a triable issue of fact as to the defendants' primary assumption of risk defense, and therefore, the court granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment.
