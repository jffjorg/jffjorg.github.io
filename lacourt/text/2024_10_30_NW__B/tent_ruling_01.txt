  Case Number:  20STCV45380    Hearing Date:   October 30, 2024    Dept:  B TENTATIVE RULINGCHAD TEWSBERRY, Plaintiff, vs. TJX INC., et al. Defendants. Case No.: 20STCV45380 Hearing Date: October 30, 2024Defendant Marshalls of California, LLC (“Defendant”)’s Motion to Compel Plaintiff Chad Tewsberry (“Plaintiff”)’s Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set Three, is granted. Plaintiff is ordered to serve Defendant with verified, objection-free responses to Form Interrogatories, Set Three, within 10 days. Plaintiff is also ordered to pay $540.00 in sanctions within 10 days.LEGAL STANDARDSIf a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order compelling responses and for a monetary sanction. (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.290(b).) The statute contains no time limit for a motion to compel where no responses have been served. All that need be shown in the moving papers is that a set of interrogatories was properly served on the opposing party, that the time to respond has expired, and that no response of any kind has been served. (See Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902, 905-906.)Where there has been no timely response to a demand for the production of documents, the demanding party may seek an order compelling a response. (CCP § 2031.300(b).) Failure to timely respond waives all objections, including privilege and work product. (CCP § 2031.300(a).) Thus, unless the party to whom thedemand was directed obtains relief from waiver, he or she cannot raise objections to the documents demanded. Likewise, for failure to respond, the moving party need not attempt to resolve the matter outside court before filing the motion.“The court shall impose a monetary sanction . . . against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel . . . responses to interrogatories or production demands, absent substantial justification or other circumstances that make imposing the sanctions unjust.” (CCP § 2030.290(c).) Similarly, “[t]he court may impose a monetary sanction ordering that one engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.” (CCP § 2023.030(a).) Misuse of the discovery process includes “[f]ailing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery,” and “[d]isobeying a court order to provide discovery.” (CCP § 2023.010(d) and (g).)DISCUSSIONDefendant moves to compel Plaintiff’s responses to Form Interrogatories, Set Three. Defendant also seeks sanctions in the amount of $1,815.00, comprised of twelve hours of work at an hourly rate of $100.00 for law clerks, $180.00 for associate attorneys, and $195.00 for partners. (Sharifan Decl. ¶ 12.). This calculation includes 4.5 hours of prep by a law clerk, 1.5 by an associate attorney, and one by a partner. (Ibid.) It also includes an anticipated five hours responding to Plaintiff’s anticipated opposition and attending this matter’s hearing. (Ibid.)Defendant moves to compel Plaintiff’s response to discovery because Plaintiff failed to provide any responses. Defendant propounded discovery requests on Plaintiff on March 28, 2024. (Sharifan Decl. ¶ 7; Exh A. [Form Interrogatories, Set Three].) Responses were due on April 27, 2024. (Ibid. at ¶ 4.) Plaintiff did not respond. (Ibid. at ¶ 9.) Defense counsel sent opposing counsel a meet and confer letter on May 31, 2024. (Ibid. at ¶ 8; Exh. B [meet and confer letter].) Plaintiff never responded or provided discovery responses. (Ibid. at ¶¶ 10 and 11.)Accordingly, Defendant’s motion to compel Plaintiff’s responses to Form Interrogatories, Set Three, is granted. Plaintiff is to serve Defendant with verified, objection-free responses to Form Interrogatories, Set Three, within 10 days of this hearing.In light of Plaintiff’s total failure to comply with their discovery obligations, the Court orders sanctions in the amount of $540.00 (representing 3 hours of work at an hourly rate of $180.00, seeing as this is a simple, unopposed motion).It is so ordered.Dated: October 29, 2024Hon.
