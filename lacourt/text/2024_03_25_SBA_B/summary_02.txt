Summary in English:

The Judge issued a tentative ruling granting defendant Derek Leroy Turner's motion to set aside the default entered on February 27, 2024. The default was entered due to defense counsel's mistake in omitting to file a responsive pleading on behalf of Turner. The Judge found that Turner's mistake was excusable and granted relief under CCP §473(b). The Judge also ordered defense counsel to pay $100 to plaintiff's counsel as a reasonable compensatory legal fee and costs. The default was vacated, and Turner is ordered to file a responsive pleading forthwith.
