Tentative Ruling:

The court has considered the petition to correct arbitration award filed by Jacob Schkud and Courtney Schkud against Dale Firman. The petitioners request that the court correct the arbitration award to award costs in the amount of $67,968.62 and attorneys' fees in the amount of $208,370.50 incurred in the arbitration.

The court has reviewed the arbitration award and the arbitrator's order on fee and cost request. The arbitrator denied the petitioners' request for attorneys' fees and costs, finding that there were no "reasonable" attorneys' fees to award.

The court holds that the arbitrator's decision not to award attorneys' fees and costs to petitioners was proper. The court finds that the arbitrator's decision was consistent with the parties' agreement and the law. The petition to correct arbitration award is therefore denied.

The respondent, Dale Firman, is ordered to give notice of the ruling.
