And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the demurrer filed by Uponor to the First Amended Cross-Complaint filed by Kennco Plumbing Inc. The court has sustained the demurrer as to the negligence cause of action without leave to amend, finding that Kennco did not allege a current injury and that the claim is barred by the economic loss rule. However, the court has overruled the demurrer as to the indemnity and declaratory relief causes of action, finding that Kennco has stated sufficient facts to support its claims. The court has ordered Uponor to answer the First Amended Cross-Complaint within 10 days of the date of the ruling.
