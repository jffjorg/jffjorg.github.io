And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion to be relieved as counsel for defendants Ebony Taylor and Kyung Lee, but will hear argument on whether the motion would violate any automatic stay as to defendant Jeremiah Phillips, LLC. The judge has also ordered an OSC regarding new counsel for defendant Jeremiah Phillips, LLC since it is a company and must be represented by an attorney licensed to practice law in California. The motion was granted because there was no opposition and no evidence that the defendants would be unduly prejudiced if counsel was relieved.
