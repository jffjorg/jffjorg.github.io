Summary of the tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion to quash 19 third-party subpoenas issued to MRI imaging facilities and law firms. The subpoenas seek documents related to agreements, communications, and payments exchanged between the defendants and the imaging facilities. The judge finds that the documents are relevant to the claims brought by the plaintiff and are not overbroad. The defendants' privacy objections are also rejected, and the judge orders the third parties to turn over all documents consistent with Request 3 of the subpoenas. The judge declines to award expenses to either party and orders the plaintiffs to give notice.
