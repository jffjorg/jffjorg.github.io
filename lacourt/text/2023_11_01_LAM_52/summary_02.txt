And here is the summary in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Plaintiff Barry Rosen to the second amended answer of Defendant City of Hawthorne. The demurrer argues that the answer does not require verification, is uncertain, and lacks factual support for the affirmative defenses. The Court finds that the answer does not require verification, as a city is not required to verify its answer. The Court also finds that the affirmative defenses are sufficient and include factual support, and that the denials are made in a permissible manner. Therefore, the Court overrules the demurrer and denies Plaintiff's request to have the answer dismissed.
