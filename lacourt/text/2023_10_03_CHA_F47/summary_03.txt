  - An action in interpleader has traditionally been the appropriate method of resolution in instances, such as this, where multiple claims exceed the sum statutorily available to the various claimants.
  - Where a party is a mere stakeholder, like Merchants, without any interests in the proceeds of the res, that party may be discharged from liability.

The judge has also ordered all claimants designated herein and all persons to interplead their claims in this action and be restrained from instituting or prosecuting any proceedings affecting the rights and obligations of Merchants with respect to all claimants under Bond No. CA5853919. The judge has further ordered any legal actions pending against the proceeds of said bond on behalf of any claimant referenced herein to be dismissed as to Merchants.
