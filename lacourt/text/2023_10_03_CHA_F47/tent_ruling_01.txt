SUMMAR OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of the care and treatment provided
by Defendant Bassam Bejjani, M.D. (Defendant) to Plaintiff Felix Soto
(Plaintiff).  
 
Defendant first saw Plaintiff, then 68 years old, on 12/18/18,
at Mission Community Hospital.  At that
time, Plaintiff presented with kidney stones; therefore, Defendant performed
extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) therapy which is a procedure to
break up stones inside the urinary tract with a series of shock waves generated
by a machine called a lithotripter. (See Fred Kuyt, M.D. Decl. (Dr. Kuyt
Decl.) ¶7; Ex.D, F).  An x-ray of the
abdomen performed on 4/19/19, revealed that Plaintiff still had a stone in his
ureter.  (Dr. Kuyt Decl. ¶8; Ex.D,
F).  
 
On 5/28/19, Defendant performed a cystoscopy, left
ureteropyeloscopy, and laser lithotripsy at Southern California Stone Center.  Defendant also placed a J-J stent into Plaintiff’s
bladder and kidney, with a string attached to it that was wrapped around the
penis and was taped to the penis to secure the string which is a recognized
manner of securing the stent.  (Dr. Kuyt
Decl. ¶9; Ex.D, F).  
 
Defendant noted that Plaintiff failed to appear for his
follow-up appointment on 6/3/19, and instead came into the office on 6/7/19.  (Dr. Kuyt Decl. ¶10; Ex.D, F).  Defendant assessed the penis for the string
that he had attached to secure the stent; however, when Defendant could not
find the string, he concluded that the stent had come out four days prior.  (Dr. Kuyt Decl. ¶¶11-12, Ex.D, F).  
 
On 9/18/19, Plaintiff’s son called Defendant’s office and
indicated that he wanted to bring his father in.  Either Defendant, or his representative,
advised Plaintiff/Plaintiff’s son that the office would need to request health
insurance authorization in advance of seeing the patient.  When the insurance group (Regal) was
contacted, it was discovered that Plaintiff was no longer covered, and had not
been so as of 6/30/19.  Plaintiff was so
advised.  (Dr. Kuyt Decl. ¶13; Ex.D,
F).  
 
On 11/19/20, Defendant was contacted by Mission Community
Hospital to perform a urologic consultation, who happened to be Plaintiff.  At that time, Defendant discovered that the
J-J stent was still there, and that Plaintiff’s insurance would only cover
treatment at Olive View-UCLA Medical Center.  (Dr. Kuyt Decl. ¶14; Ex.D, F).  Defendant spoke to the case manager, and
arranged for transfer to Olive View, where Plaintiff’s stent was removed.  (Dr. Kuyt Decl. ¶15; Ex.D, F).  
 
On 7/19/21, Plaintiff filed this action against Defendant
for medical negligence.  Defendant Bassam
Bejjani, M.D. (Defendant) has filed two separate motions for summary judgment.  The first motion, based solely on the statute
of limitations, was filed on 9/28/22 and originally set for hearing on 4/25/23
when this action was pending in Department 27 in the Spring Street Courthouse.  Before the 4/25/23 hearing, this action was
transferred to this department and rescheduled for hearing on 10/3/23.
 
On 6/7/23, Defendant filed a second motion for summary
judgment on the merits of the case which was scheduled for hearing on 9/21/23.  
 
On 9/14/23, Plaintiff Felix Soto (Plaintiff) filed an
opposition which lists the 10/3/23 hearing date and addresses the arguments in
both motions.  The opposition is untimely
for the 9/21/23 hearing date but is timely for the 10/3/23 date.  On 9/15/23, Defendant filed a reply to the
opposition on the merits for the 9/21/23 hearing date.    
 
To ensure both parties had the opportunity to present
their arguments in support of and in opposition to the two motions, on 9/21/23,
the Court continued the hearing on the motion for summary judgment on the
merits to 10/3/23 and allowed Defendant to supplement its reply arguments in
relation to that motion as well as address the opposition arguments made in
relation to the motion for summary judgment based on statute of limitations.  (See 9/21/23 Minute Order).  
 
On 9/26/23, Defendant filed another reply wherein he
indicates that he is withdrawing the motion for summary judgment based on
statute of limitations and the reply only addresses the motion for summary
judgment on the merits.  (See
9/26/23 Reply, p.1:27-p.2:1). 
Accordingly, the analysis only addresses the motion for summary judgment
on the merits.  
 
ANALYSIS 

 
The elements of a medical negligence cause of action are:
“(1) a duty to use such skill, prudence, and diligence as other members of the
profession commonly possess and exercise; (2) a breach of the duty; (3) a
proximate causal connection between the negligent conduct and the injury; and
(4) resulting loss or damage.”  Johnson
(2006) 143 CA4th 297, 305.
 
The duty owed in medical negligence/malpractice actions
is measured by the standard of care in the community.  See Munro (1989) 215 CA3d 977,
983-984.  Whether the duty owed by a
physician to a patient has been breached and whether such breach caused the
patient’s injury is usually a matter peculiarly within the knowledge of experts
whose testimony is required to prove or rebut such an allegation.  See Willard (1981) 121 CA3d
406; Keen (1972) 23 CA3d 275, 279; Bromme (1992) 5 CA4th 1487,
1498; Williams (1995) 33 CA4th 120, 132-133.
 
Defendant does not dispute that he owed a duty of care to
Plaintiff.  Rather, the motion is based
on the claim that Defendant has provided expert opinion through the declaration
of Fred Kuyt, M.D. (Dr. Kuyt) that Defendant met the applicable standard of
care and nothing Defendant did or did not do caused or contributed to
Plaintiff’s injuries.  
 
While the motion is supported by an expert declaration
and the opposition is not, in this case, Plaintiff’s failure to submit an
opposing expert opinion is not fatal to his claim.  Here, Defendant’s expert’s declaration is
based, in part, on the following: 
 
“19.  In this case, Dr. Bejjani initially complied
with the standard of care by offering the patient the opportunity to have the
stent removed by him as his urologist; however, when Mr. Soto  presented to Dr. Bejjani, he reported
information consistent with the scenario that the stent had  either come out on its own or that the
patient had removed it, which Dr. Bejjani concluded was the case.
 
20. Based upon the information
reported to Dr. Bejjani, and Dr. Bejjani's interpretation of the totality
of the information available, it was not unreasonable for Dr. Bejjani to have
construed that the stent had come out on its own, in which case follow-up
imaging would not have been required by the standard of care to confirm same.”  (emphasis added).
 
(Fred Kuyt, M.D. Decl. ¶¶19-20).
 
Defendant’s notes from 6/7/19, the day Plaintiff
purportedly reported information to Defendant which made Defendant reasonably
presume the stent had been removed by Plaintiff or had come out on his own, do
not reflect any conversation between Plaintiff and Defendant.  (See Defendant’s Evidence, Ex.F,
DEF003).  Additionally, Dr. Kuyt’s
declaration never states what information was purportedly reported to Defendant
by Plaintiff which makes Dr. Kuyt opine that it was reasonable for Defendant to
construe that the stent had come out on its own or that Plaintiff had removed
it.  (See Dr. Kuyt Decl. ¶¶19-20).  Dr. Kuyt says that he reviewed the complaint,
Plaintiff’s medical records from Defendant’s office and the depositions of
Defendant and Plaintiff.  (Kuyt Decl.
¶6).  However, he does not identify what
portions of the deposition transcripts or medical records helped form his
opinion.   
 
Additionally, both Plaintiff and his son, who was present
at the 6/7/19 appointment, state in their declarations that during the 6/7/19
appointment, Defendant “did not use the word stent,” “did not ask any questions
about any string or string attached to a stent,” “did not discuss a stent or
any string that was attached to a stent,” and that “[t]he only statement
[Defendant] made … was that [Plaintiff] smelled and that he should take a
shower.”  (See Michael Soto Decl.
¶4; Felix Decl. ¶3). 
 
Because there is a dispute regarding the facts which
underlie Dr. Kuyt’s opinion, a triable issue of material fact exists as to the
validity of Dr. Kuyt’s opinion that Defendant met the applicable standard of
care and/or did not cause or contribute to Plaintiff’s injuries.  As such, the Court finds that an opposing
expert opinion declaration is not necessary to deny the motion.   
 
CONCLUSION
 
Based on the foregoing, Defendants motion for summary
judgment on the merits filed on 6/7/23 is denied.
 
Based Defendant’s withdrawal of his motion for summary
judgment based on statute of limitations filed on 9/28/22, that motion is
placed off calendar.
