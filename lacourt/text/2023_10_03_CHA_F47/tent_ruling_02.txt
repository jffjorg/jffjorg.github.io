Case #22CHCV00358
 
MOTION TO SET
ASIDE DEFAULT JUDGMENT
 
Motion filed on 5/30/23.
 
MOVING PARTY: Defendant Liliana Ramirez
RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff Grigor Atoian, Trustee for
the Atoian Family 1993 Living Trust
 
RELIEF REQUESTED: An order setting aside default
judgment against Defendant Liliana Ramirez. 

 
RULING: The motion is placed off calendar.  On the Court’s own motion an Order to Show
Cause will be scheduled as set forth below. 

 
On 5/23/22, Grigor Atoian, as Trustee of the Atoian
Family 1993 Living Trust filed this action “in propria persona” against
Defendant Liliana Ramirez (Defendant).  (See
Complaint, face page, lines 1-7).  On
10/10/22, pursuant to a request filed by Grigor Atoian, Trustee for the Atoian
Family 1993 Living Trust, default (not default judgment) was entered against
Defendant.  On 5/30/23, Defendant, also
representing herself, filed the instant motion to set aside default judgment
and to allow Defendant to file a motion to quash.  No proof of service has been filed for the
motion and no opposition or other response to the motion has been filed by
Plaintiff.  Therefore, the motion is placed
off calendar.
 
However, unless Grigor Atoian is an attorney, he cannot
represent the Atoian Family 1993 Living Trust (the Trust) in court.  See Business & Professions Code
6125; Ziegler (1998) 64 CA4th 545, 547-549.  Therefore, the Court will set an Order to
Show Cause Re why the default should not be set aside as void and the action
dismissed as being improperly filed by a non-attorney on behalf of a
trust.
