## English Summary

The Judge has denied Defendant Dr. Bejjani's motion for summary judgment in a medical negligence case brought by Plaintiff Felix Soto. 

The case arises from treatment Dr. Bejjani provided to Mr. Soto for kidney stones. Mr. Soto alleges that Dr. Bejjani was negligent in his care, leading to further complications. 

Dr. Bejjani argued that he met the standard of care and that his actions did not cause Mr. Soto's injuries. He presented an expert declaration supporting this argument. Mr. Soto did not provide an opposing expert declaration, but the Judge found that this was not necessary to deny the motion. 

The Judge concluded that there is a dispute regarding the facts underlying Dr. Bejjani's expert's opinion, making it a question for a jury to decide. This means that the case will proceed to trial.
