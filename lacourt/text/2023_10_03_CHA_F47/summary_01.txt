Summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied Defendant Bassam Bejjani, M.D.'s motion for summary judgment on the merits, filed on June 7, 2023. The motion was based on the claim that Defendant met the applicable standard of care and did not cause or contribute to Plaintiff Felix Soto's injuries. However, the judge found that a triable issue of material fact exists regarding the validity of Defendant's expert opinion, which is based on a dispute over the facts underlying the opinion. Specifically, the judge noted that Defendant's expert, Fred Kuyt, M.D., based his opinion on information that is disputed by Plaintiff and his son. Therefore, the judge concluded that the motion for summary judgment on the merits was denied.
