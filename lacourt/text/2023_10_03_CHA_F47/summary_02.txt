And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has decided to place the motion to set aside default judgment off calendar. However, the judge has scheduled an Order to Show Cause to require Grigor Atoian, the Trustee for the Atoian Family 1993 Living Trust, to explain why the default should not be set aside as void and the action dismissed as being improperly filed by a non-attorney on behalf of a trust. This is because California law requires that only an attorney can represent a trust in court. The judge has given no indication of whether the default judgment will be set aside or the action dismissed, but is instead requiring Grigor Atoian to explain why the default was properly filed.
