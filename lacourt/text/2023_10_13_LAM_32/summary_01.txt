Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This tentative ruling grants Defendant A&B Ingredients, Inc.'s motion in limine to exclude undisclosed witnesses. The ruling is based on the fact that Plaintiff Lenny & Larry's, LLC failed to disclose the names of the witnesses in discovery or expert designations, despite having knowledge of their existence. The judge finds that Plaintiff's failure to disclose the witnesses was intentional, and that allowing Plaintiff to add the new witnesses at this late stage would unduly prejudice Defendant. The ruling also notes that Plaintiff has not made a proper showing to justify the belated disclosure of the witnesses, and that the addition of the new witnesses appears to be redundant of existing witnesses.
