And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the Defendant/Cross-Complainant, Robert Allan Kahn, granting his motion to quash a subpoena issued to US Bank. The Judge found that the subpoena is not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence, as it seeks records from Kahn's client trust account that are unrelated to the instant action. The Judge also awarded monetary sanctions in favor of Kahn, and against Deakin, in the amount of $60.00 for costs. The Judge denied Kahn's request for attorney's fees.
