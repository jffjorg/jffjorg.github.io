 Case Number:  23STCV08151    Hearing Date:   December 14, 2023    Dept:  49 Derek Paul Deakin v. Robert Allan KahnCROSS-COMPLAINANT’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT MOVING PARTY: Cross-Complainant Robert Allan KahnRESPONDING PARTY(S): Cross-Defendant Derek Paul DeakinSTATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS: Plaintiff Derek Deakin alleges he retained attorney Defendant Robert Kahn to represent him in a personal injury action. Plaintiff alleges Defendant breached the parties’ fee agreement be retaining a portion of the settlement owed to Plaintiff. Defendant has filed a Cross-Complaint against Plaintiff for declaratory relief. Defendant/Cross-Complainant seeks a judicial declaration over the parties’ rights to $269,984.74 currently held in Defendant/Cross-Complainant’s client trust account. Cross-Complainant now moves for summary judgment. Cross-Defendant opposed. The matter first came for hearing on November 2, 2023. After the hearing, the court continued the motion and allowed Cross-Defendant to file a supplemental opposition addressing the defects raised at the hearing and in the tentative ruling. The court has read and considered Cross-Defendant’s supplemental filings of November 6, 2023, as well as Cross-Complainant’s December 5, 2023, response thereto, and now rules as follows.TENTATIVE RULING:Cross-Complainants’ Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED.Cross-Complainant is ordered to file a [Proposed] Judgment consistent with this ruling.Moving party to give notice.DISCUSSION:Motion for Summary JudgmentI. Legal StandardThe function of a motion for summary judgment or adjudication is to allow a determination as to whether an opposing party cannot show evidentiary support for a pleading or claim and to enable an order of summary dismissal without the need for trial. Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843. In analyzing motions for summary judgment, courts must apply a three-step analysis: “(1) identify the issues framed by the pleadings; (2) determine whether the moving party has negated the opponent's claims; and (3) determine whether the opposition has demonstrated the existence of a triable, material factual issue.” Hinesley v. Oakshade Town Center (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 289, 294.  Thus, summary judgment is granted when, after the Court’s consideration of the evidence set forth in the papers and all reasonable inferences accordingly, no triable issues of fact exist and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  Code Civ. Proc. § 437c(c); Villa v. McFarren (1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 733, 741. Where a plaintiff moves for summary judgment, the burden is to produce admissible evidence on each element of a “cause of action” entitling him or her to judgment. (CCP § 437c(p)(1); see Hunter v. Pacific Mechanical Corp. (1995) 37 CA4th 1282, 1287, 44 CR2d 335, 337 (citing text) (disapproved on other grounds by Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 C4th 826, 107 CR2d 841)).  This means that plaintiffs who bear the burden of proof at trial by a preponderance of evidence must produce evidence that would require a reasonable trier of fact to find any underlying material fact more likely than not.  At that point, the burden shifts to defendant “to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto.” (CCP § 437c(p)(1)).II. AnalysisA. Moving Party’s BurdenIn analyzing motions for summary judgment, courts must apply a three-step analysis: “(1) identify the issues framed by the pleadings; (2) determine whether the moving party has negated the opponent's claims; and (3) determine whether the opposition has demonstrated the existence of a triable, material factual issue.” (Hinesley v. Oakshade Town Center (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 289, 294.)Summary judgment is appropriate in a declaratory relief action when only legal issues are presented for the court's determination. (Gafcon, Inc. v. Ponsor & Associates (2002) 98 Cal.App.4th 1388, 1401–1402.)Cross-Complainant Kahn seeks the following declaratory judgment:For a declaratory judgment that Kahn is entitled to the $269,984.74 held in his client trust account, and Deakin is not entitled to any of the $269,984.74, and that Kahn may disburse $260,984.74 to himself in payment of the balance of the attorney’s fees he earned pursuant to the Fee Agreement.(Cross-Complaint, Prayer 1.)In support of the motion, Kahn presents evidence that he and Deakin entered into a written Retainer Agreement on June 15, 2018, pursuant to which Deakin retained Kahn to represent him in a personal injury case involving injuries Deakin sustained in a motorcycle accident on June 6, 2018. (SSUMF 1.) The retainer provided that Kahn’s fee for his legal services would be thirty-three and one-third percent if the matter settled more than 120 days before the first date set for trial, or forty percent if the matter settled less than 120 days before the first date set for trial. (SSUMF 2.) The retainer also provided that Kahn could recover his costs. (SSUMF 3).On August 16, 2018 Kahn filed an action on Deakin's behalf entitled Deakin v. Tassiopulos, LASC Case No. BC717886. (SSUMF 5.) Deakin advised Kahn of his desire to net between $875,000 and $1,000,000. (SSUMF 12.) As the case progressed, Deakin continued to lower his demand. (SSUMF 13.) Kahn advised Deakin that the gross amount he was offering would net Deakin less than his desired $875,000 to $1,000,000. (Id.) On or about August 23, 2011, Deakin’s case settled for $1,675,000, after Deakin authorized Kahn to accept the Code of Civil Procedure 998 offer made by the defendant in that amount. (SSUMF 7.) Deakin accepted the settlement with knowledge of the approximate amount he would net. (SSUMF 14.) Kahn deposited the funds into his client trust account. (SSUMF 8.) Because the case settled less than 120 days before the first date set for trial (February 18, 2020), Kahn was entitled to a 40 percent fee and reimbursement of costs in the amount of $94,592.02. (SSUMF 9, 10.) Despite requests from Deakin, Kahn never agreed to reduce his fee. (SSUMF 11, 16.) On September 20, 2022, Kahn disbursed $644,021.60 to Deakin with Deakin's approval. (SSUMF 20.) On January 3, 2023, Kahn disbursed another $162,565.44 to Deakin to cover one of Deakin’s medical liens. (SSUMF 24.) On or about January 16, 2023, Kahn paid himself out of this trust account a total of $494,592.02 ($400,000 for fees and $94,592.92 for costs). (SSUMF 23.) Therefore, there remains $269,984.74 in contested fees in the trust account. (SSUMF 23.) Considering this evidence, Kahn has met his initial burden to establish he is entitled to declaratory relief. This switches the burden to Deakin to establish a triable issue.B. Opposing Party’s Burden1. Procedural Requirements of Opposition to MSJThe opposition to a motion for summary judgment or adjudication must consist of (1) a memorandum in opposition, (2) a separate statement in opposition, and (3) evidence in opposition. (See Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1350(e).) The separate statement in opposition “must unequivocally state whether [each] fact is ‘disputed’ or ‘undisputed.’” (Id., Rule 3.1350(f)(2).)In opposition, Cross-Defendant first filed a document titled “Cross-Defendant Derek Deakin’s Responses and Supporting Evidence To Robert Kahn’s Separate Statement in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment.” (See 09/08/23 Filing.) While it resembles a separate statement, if fails to identify which facts are disputed or undisputed. Deakin did not submit a memorandum of points and authorities. He has likewise did not submit any admissible evidence in support of his opposition. In light of these deficiencies, the court released a Tentative Ruling stating its intention to continue the hearing to allow Deakin the opportunity to file a code-compliant opposition. At the conclusion of the November 2, 2023, hearing on this motion, this court continued the motion and permitted Deakin to file a supplemental opposition no later than November 30, 2023.Only four days later, on November 6, 2023, Cross-Defendant filed two documents: (1) a “Separate Statement of Disputed Facts and Supporting Evidence in Opposition of Cross-Complainant’s Motion for Summary Judgment” and (2) “Responses and Supporting Evidence in Opposition of Motion for Summary Judgment [sic].”   [FN 1]As an initial matter, Cross-Defendant has again not included a declaration or affidavit with his opposition. His 09/12/23 “Responses and Supporting Evidence” and 11/06/23 supplemental “Responses and Supporting Evidence” do, however, include a “Verification” stating:  Cross-Defendant “declares under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of California that the foregoing is true and correct.” (Response p. 16; supplemental Response p. 12.) Cross-Defendant’s supplemental Separate Statement contends each of Cross-Complainant’s twenty-seven material facts are disputed. Upon review, many of the “disputed facts” are not competently in dispute. For example, the moving party provided the following material fact:On August 18, 2022, Kahn advised Deakin in writing that if he accepted $1.7 million, he would net approximately $737,407.26. (SSUMF 14.) The undisputed fact is clearly supported by the August 18, 2022, email where Kahn writes to Deakin that he would “would net approximately $737,407.26 on a $1.7MM settlement.” (Kahn Dec. ¶ 5, Ex. 7.)In his response to the separate statement, Deakin says this undisputable fact is disputed. He states:Disputed. Deakin went into shock by this email as Kahn breached their Oral Agreement. Therefore, Deakin is seeking restitution and unjust enrichment. Unjust enrichment occurs when Party A confers a benefit upon Party B without Party A receiving the proper restitution required by law (See LII, Wex, “unjust enrichment”, 2023). A fair jury trial is requested to determine if a quasi-contract exists as California courts typically differ on whether cause of action for unjust enrichment is a legitimate claim.(Cross-Complainant’s 11/06/23 Separate Statement, 14.) Suffice it to say, this fact is not disputed, and Cross-Defendant’s explanation does not show otherwise. This is far from the only example. It is also noted that Deakin has not provided any “additional” facts in dispute. As the Court of Appeal recently stated, “[t]he opposing party's responses to the separate statement must be in good faith, responsive, and material. Responses should directly address the fact stated, and if that fact is not in dispute, the opposing party must so admit. It is completely unhelpful to evade the stated fact in an attempt to create a dispute where none exists.” (Beltran v. Hard Rock Hotel Licensing, Inc., 2023 WL 8430581, at *6 (Cal. Ct. App. Dec. 5, 2023 [certified for publication].) These factors alone are sufficient grounds to grant the motion for summary judgment in Cross-Complainants’ favor. Indeed, trial courts should “not hesitate to disregard attempts to game the system by the opposing party claiming facts are ‘disputed’ when the uncontroverted evidence clearly shows otherwise.” (Id. at *7.) “When a moving party makes the required prima facie showing, the opposing party's failure to comply with this requirement may, in the court's discretion, constitute a sufficient ground for granting the motion. (CCP § 437c(b)(3); see Oldcastle Precast, Inc. v. Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co. (2009) 170 Cal. App. 4th 554, 568.) Be that as it may, for matters of fairness, the court proceeds to consider Cross-Defendant’s evidence, to the extent it is possible to do so. 2. Opposition on the MeritsFirst, Cross-Defendant contends his signature on the attorney fee Agreement is a forgery. But he has provided no competent evidence to support that contention. A party seeking to avoid summary judgment “must produce substantial responsive evidence sufficient to establish a triable issue of material fact on the merits…” (Sangster v. Paetkau (1998) 68 Cal.App. 4th 151, 163 [bare assertion that moving party “fabricated” evidence is insufficient to avoid summary judgment])(emphasis added). And the opposing party cannot controvert the moving party's declarations by evidence “based on speculation, imagination, guess work, or mere possibilities.” (Doe v. Salesian Soc. (2008) 159 Cal. App. 4th 474, 481.)Second, Cross-Defendant also fails to demonstrate that the Agreement is ambiguous. It provides that “Client agrees to pay for the services herein described, the fee shall be thirty-three and one-third percent (33 1/3%) of any and all gross amounts recovered if the matter is settled more than 120 days before the first date set for trial. If the matter settled less than 120 days before the first date set for trial, or goes to trial, the fee will be forty (40%) percent.” (SSUMF 2, Exh. 1.) This agreement means what it says. Third, Cross-Defendant argues that the fee Agreement was superseded by an oral agreement by which Kahn represented he would receive between $875,000 and $1,000,000 in the settlement. On July 26, 2022, Kahn wrote to Deakin by email: “This will confirm that you have authorized me to negotiate a settlement that will net you between $850,000 and $1 million and that whatever that number turns out to be it will be more than my fee. So for example, if you net 900,000 my fee has to be less than 900,000 etc.” (Cross-Complainants’ supplemental Response and Supporting Evidence, Exh. H.)This email does not demonstrate any modification to the fee Agreement. Nor does it represent any “promise” to recover a certain amount. Based on this email in context of the other communications between the parties, this representation can be viewed as little more than an aspirational understanding between them. Finally, Deakin has failed to submit evidence by which a reasonable trier of fact can find wrongdoing by Kahn when he accepted a settlement on Deakin’s behalf. The undisputed evidence shows that on August 23, 2022, Deakin authorized Kahn to accept the opposing party’s section 998 offer.  Deakin wrote to Kahn by email: “I will accept the offer of $1,675,000 and arbitrate your fee.” (Kahn Decl. ¶ 7, Exh. 7, 402.) This came after Kahn had explained to Deakin that acceptance of an offer around that amount would net him less than $800,000. (Id., 316.) Kahn also explained to Deakin the “consequences of not accepting” the section 998 offer if he did not obtain a more favorable verdict at trial. (Id., 357.) In short, Deakin was not “coerced” to accept the settlement. Rather, his attorney advised him that the offer on the table was the best he would get, and that it was in his best interest to accept it. This court is mindful of its duty to “liberally construe the evidence in support of the party opposing summary judgment and resolve doubts concerning the evidence in favor of that party.” (Dore v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc.¿(2006) 39 Cal.4th 384, 389.) But a responding party’s evidence still must be “substantial.” (See Sangster, supra, 68 Cal.App. 4th at 163.) Considering the evidence, Cross-Defendant has failed to carry his burden to establish a triable issue. In other words, there is no evidence by which a reasonable trier of fact could find in Cross-Defendant’s favor on the Cross-Complaint.Accordingly, Cross-Complainants’ Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED.Cross-Complainant is ordered to file a [Proposed] Judgment consistent with this ruling.Moving party to give notice.IT IS SO ORDERED.Dated:   December 14, 2023 ___________________________________ Randolph M. Hammock Judge of the Superior CourtFN 1 - In this latter pleading, Cross-Defendant states that at the November 2nd hearing “several remarks were made to Deakin’s face such as “You are out of your mind”, “Do you know you are crazy?”, “You are mentally unstable.”  (See, p. 2, lines 12-18).  He implies that perhaps these comments were made by this Court.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  These statements (or any thing remotely thereto) were NEVER made by this Court, nor by anyone during that hearing.  This appears to be designed to suggest that this Court is somehow biased or prejudiced against Mr. Deakin in this case.  Once again, nothing could be further from the truth.  Indeed, if this Court was so biased and prejudiced against Mr. Deakin, it could have merely granted the MSJ at that time.  Instead, it graciously allowed Mr. Deakin another opportunity to comply with the mandatory rules applicable to opposing a MSJ.  Mr. Deakin is admonished to refrain from making such false and contemptuous statements in the future.
