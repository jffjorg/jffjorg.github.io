And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the plaintiffs' motion to quash the deposition subpoena for production of business records from Saundra Edwards, the psychotherapist of Rosalva Mejia. The subpoena was served by defendant Univar Solutions USA, Inc. and seeks records related to Rosalva Mejia's mental health treatment. The judge found that the subpoena is overly broad and seeks protected information, and that the records are not relevant to the subject matter of the lawsuit. The judge also noted that the defendant failed to demonstrate how the records would lead to the discovery of admissible evidence, and that the plaintiffs' privacy interests outweigh the defendant's interest in discovering the records. The judge granted the motion to quash the subpoena and declined to award expenses to either party.
