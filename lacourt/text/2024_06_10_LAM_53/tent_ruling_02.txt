plaintiff’s motion for terminating sanctions
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Plaintiff David Maijala          
 
RESPONDING PARTIES:     Defendant and cross-complainant Mulgrew
Aircraft Components, Inc., and defendant Mohammad Houshiar             
Motion for Terminating Sanctions
The court
considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers filed in connection with
this motion. 
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff David Maijala (“Plaintiff”) moves the court for an order (1)
imposing terminating sanctions against defendant Mulgrew Aircraft Components,
Inc. (“Defendant”), and (2) awarding monetary sanctions in favor of Plaintiff
and against Defendant in the amount of $18,100. 
Plaintiff moves for this relief on the ground that Defendant violated
the court’s September 8, 2023, and March 4, 2024 orders. 
On September 8, 2023, the court issued an order (1) granting in part
Plaintiff’s motion to compel the production of documents in response to Plaintiff’s
First Amended Notice of Deposition, and (2) ordering Defendant to produce, at
the deposition of its person(s) most qualified, documents responsive to
Plaintiff’s requests for production of documents, numbers 1, 5-8, 10, 13, 16,
22, 54-59, 61-62, 69, and 71, and 14-15, 28, 30-44, 64, and 117-124, limited to
the period of time from May 1, 2016 through October 10, 2019, as set forth in
Plaintiff’s First Amended Notice of Deposition. 
(Sep. 8, 2023 Order, p. 3:7-15.)  Thereafter, on March 4, 2024, the court issued
an order (1) denying Plaintiff’s motion for terminating and monetary sanctions,
but (2) ordering Defendant to produce the documents specified in the court’s
September 8, 2023 order at a deposition of its person(s) most qualified, to be
taken by Plaintiff’s counsel “on a date no later than March 29, 2024[.]”  (Mar. 4, 2024 Order, p. 5:16-26.) 
Plaintiff contends that Defendant did not produce the following
documents at the deposition of its person most qualified: (1) approximately 150
Best Deburring Services Certificates of Conformance (Request for Production No.
39); (2) all subcontracted forming-related documents (Requests for Production
Nos. 32, 38, 69); (3) a list of Defendant’s employees and consultants (Request
for Production No. 37); (4) all communications to and from Plaintiff’s email
addresses at Mulgrew (Requests for Production Nos. 7 and 13); (5) all of
Defendant’s policies and procedures for manufacturing rainbow fittings (Request
for Production No. 14);    (6) all of Defendant’s policies and procedures
regrading employee protections against retaliation (Request for Production No.
15); (7) all contracts and purchase orders between Defendant and Lockheed
(Request for Production No. 33); (8) completed traveler documents for Lockheed
rainbow fittings (Request for Production No. 35); (9) AS9100 system audit
documentation (Request for Production No. 41); (10) all Lockheed annual surveys
or audits of Defendant (Request for Production No. 43); and (11) all penetrant
inspection results for Lockheed wing joint fitting (rainbow fittings) (Requests
for Production Nos. 120 and 124).
In its opposition to this motion, Defendant (1) submits evidence
establishing that, on May 20, 2024, Defendant produced approximately 150
documents in response to Request for Production of Documents, number 39, and
(2) states, in its opposition brief, that it produced various other documents
on that date and on May 24, 2024.  (Nenni
Decl., ¶ 22; Opp., pp. 7:10-12, 14:5-7.)  Defendant’s counsel further states that
Defendant is “not aware of any existing, responsive documents which have not
been produced in this matter.”  (Nenni
Decl., ¶ 24.)
In reply, Plaintiff submits the declaration of his counsel, in which
counsel states that on May 24, 2024, Defendant “produced over 16,000 pages of
additional documents that had been withheld during the discovery process.”  (Kakoian Decl., ¶ 2.)  Plaintiff has requested that the court continue
the hearing on this motion to allow Plaintiff to submit a supplemental brief
after having a reasonable opportunity to review the documents recently produced
by Defendant and to determine whether Defendant has produced all responsive
documents as ordered by the court. 
(Reply, pp. 2:23-26, 3:6-7.) 
The court finds that it is appropriate, and therefore exercises its
discretion, to grant Plaintiff’s request to continue the hearing on this motion
(1) to give Plaintiff an opportunity to review the supplemental documents
produced by Defendant on May 20, 2024 and May 24, 2024, and (2) to give
Plaintiff an opportunity to file a supplemental reply memorandum of points of
authorities not to exceed 7 pages in length, and a supplemental declaration in
support of his supplemental reply.
ORDER
            The court orders that the hearing on
plaintiff David Maijala’s motion for terminating sanctions is continued to July
22, 2024, at 10:00 a.m., in Department 53.
            The court orders that plaintiff
David Maijala may serve and file, no later than July 11, 2024, a supplemental
reply memorandum of points and authorities, not to exceed 7 pages in length, limited
to addressing, as to each of the requests for production of documents at issue
in this motion, whether defendant Mulgrew Aircraft Components, Inc. produced all
documents responsive to each request for production of document in its
supplemental productions on May 20, 2024 and May 24, 2024.  
            The court orders plaintiff David
Maijala to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
DATED:  June 10, 2024
