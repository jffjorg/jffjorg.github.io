And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on the defendants' motion to bifurcate the trial in this case. The defendants, DTLA Real Estate, Inc. and Sylvia Ena, moved to separate the issue of punitive damages from the issues of liability and damages. The plaintiff, David Tsao, did not file an opposition to the motion. The judge granted the motion and ordered that the trial will be bifurcated into two phases. In the first phase, the jury will decide the issues of liability and compensatory damages, as well as whether the defendants are guilty of malice, oppression, or fraud. In the second phase, the jury will decide the issue of punitive damages against the defendants. The judge cited California Civil Code section 3295 as the basis for the order.
