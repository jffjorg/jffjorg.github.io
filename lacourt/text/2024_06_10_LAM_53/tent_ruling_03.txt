Order to Show Cause re Why Defendant Intercity Fellowship Hall’s Answer
Should Not be Stricken Because it is a Corporation Unrepresented by Counsel
            On March 22, 2024, the motion to be
relieved as counsel for defendant Intercity Fellowship Hall (“Defendant”),
filed by attorney Zachary McCready, came before the court.  The court issued an order on that date (1) noting
that Defendant filed, on March 6, 2024, a “Substitution of Attorney – Civil”
form, stating that Defendant is substituting in as counsel to represent itself
in this action in place of counsel, (2) finding that the motion to be relieved
as counsel was therefore moot, and (3) setting the pending Order to Show Cause
re why Defendant’s answer should not be stricken because it is a corporation
not represented by counsel.  (Mar. 22,
2024 Order, pp. 1:20-28, 2:5-8.)  The
court further ordered plaintiff Mary Erickson (“Plaintiff”) to give notice of
this ruling. 
            On March 22, 2024, Plaintiff filed a
“Notice of Ruling re Defendant’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel.”  Attached to Plaintiff’s notice is (1) a copy
of the court’s March 22, 2024 order, and (2) a proof of service stating that
the notice of ruling was served on Zachary McCready, Zachary C. Skidelsky,
Aasim Ghaznavi, and Ashley T. Hylton of McCready Law Group.  (Pl. Mar. 22, 2024 Notice, p. 4-7.)  However, as set forth above, Defendant filed
a Substitution of Attorney form on March 6, 2024, in which Defendant stated
that it was substituting in as counsel to represent itself in place of Zachary
McCready.  (Mar. 6, 2024 MC-050, ¶ 2.) 
            Thus, Defendant is now representing
itself in this action.  Plaintiff was,
therefore, required to give notice to Defendant directly.  Plaintiff did not serve a notice of ruling on
Defendant.  It therefore appears that
Defendant has not been given notice of the hearing on the court’s Order to Show
Cause. 
            The court therefore finds that it is
appropriate, and exercises its discretion, to continue the hearing on the
court’s Order to Show Cause. 
            The court orders that the hearing on
the Order to Show Cause re why defendant Intercity Fellowship Hall’s answer
should not be stricken because it is a corporation not represented by counsel
is continued to July 15, 2024, at 10:00 a.m., in Department 53. 
            The court orders that any response
to the Order to Show Cause shall be filed no later than nine court days before
the hearing. 
            The court orders plaintiff Mary
Erickson to give notice of this ruling and to file a proof of service of the
notice of this ruling with the court no later than June 12, 2024. 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  June 10, 2024
