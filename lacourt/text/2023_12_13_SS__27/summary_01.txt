  - "Defendant's primary argument is that the special interrogatories are irrelevant. For discovery purposes, information is relevant if it might reasonably assist a party in evaluating the case, preparing for trial, or facilitating settlement."
  - "A corporate entity has limited privacy rights. Where the corporation is an actual named defendant and the issues raised by the litigation involve the organization and ownership of the corporation, the interest in justice overrides the weak privacy interest at stake."
```

English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants in part and denies in part the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories 15 and 16. The special interrogatories seek information about the payments made by Kaiser to National and the nature of their relationship. The judge finds that the payments could be relevant to assessing bias and determining the nature of their relationship, but limits the scope of the discovery to five years before the incident and two years after the incident. The judge also finds that some of the objections raised by Kaiser are meritless and grants the motion to compel further responses in part. The judge denies the plaintiff's request for sanctions against Kaiser and advises the parties to file submissions on the tentative ruling by email.
