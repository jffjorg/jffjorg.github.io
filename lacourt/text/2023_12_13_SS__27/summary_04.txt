And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants Infinity Select Insurance Company's unopposed motion for leave to intervene in the action. The court finds that Infinity has a direct and immediate interest in the litigation, as its insureds, Defendants Nomair and A-1, have refused to participate in their own defense. The court also finds that allowing Infinity to intervene will not enlarge the issues in the case, as Infinity will likely assert the same defenses as its insureds. The court notes that Infinity's interest in the litigation is related to the property or transaction that is the subject of the action, and that Infinity's ability to protect its interest may be impaired or impeded if it is not allowed to intervene. The court grants the motion and orders Infinity to file its proposed answer-in-intervention with the court within five calendar days of the order.
