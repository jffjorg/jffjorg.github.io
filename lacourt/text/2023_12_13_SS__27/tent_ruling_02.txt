[1] While
the Court is granting Plaintiff’s motion in part even though to a large degree
the requested discovery appears to the Court to be “fishing,” it notes that responding
to the requested discovery does not appear to be burdensome in the least.
  


[2] The
Court agrees with Plaintiff that Kaiser’s objections are overstated.  Is “painfully” vague somehow different from
“just plain” vague?  Moreover, the
interrogatories are not vague at all. 
They are clear and unambiguous. 
Kaiser should refrain from editorializing in responding to
discovery.  Such conduct makes it look
bad in the first instance and only worse when, as here, entirely
misplaced.
