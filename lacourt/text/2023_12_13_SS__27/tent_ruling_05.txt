[1] The Court notes that Plaintiff
has not filed a proof of service which reflects serving Defendant Nomair with
the summons and complaint in this action. Exhibit F attached to the declaration
of counsel in support of the Motion includes a proof of service concerning a
different case and not this action (LASC Case No. 22STCV27155). Thus, Defendant
Nomair does not appear to have been served with the summons and complaint in
this action despite counsel’s attestation to the contrary.
