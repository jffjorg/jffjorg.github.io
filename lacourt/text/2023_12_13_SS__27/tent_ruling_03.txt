I.                  
INTRODUCTION
Alberto Valencia Barrera (“Plaintiff”) filed his
complaint against Carolyn St. Clair (“Defendant”), and Does 1 through 20 on July
22, 2021, alleging injuries and damages arising out of an automobile accident
that occurred on July 26, 2019.  
On November 2, 2023, Defendant filed her motion
to compel Plaintiff’s attendance and testimony at deposition and for monetary
sanctions against Plaintiff and his counsel in the amount of $911.65. Plaintiff
filed his opposition on November 30, 2023.
II.               
LEGAL STANDARD
Code of Civil Procedure § 2025.450(a)
provides:  
“If, after service of a deposition notice, a
party to the action or an officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a
party, or a person designated by an organization that is a party under Section
2025.230, without having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails
to appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for inspection
any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in
the deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order
compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production for
inspection of any document, electronically stored information, or tangible
thing described in the deposition notice.” 

            The motion shall “(1) set forth specific facts
showing good cause justifying the production for inspection of any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice” and “(2) be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration
under Section 2016.040, or, when the deponent fails to attend the deposition
and produce the documents, electronically stored information, or things
described in the deposition notice, by a declaration stating that the
petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire about the nonappearance.”
(Code Civ. Proc. § 2025.450(b)(2).)  
“Any party served with a deposition notice that
does not comply with Article 2 (commencing with Section 2025.210) waives any
error or irregularity unless that party promptly serves a written objection
specifying that error or irregularity at least three calendar days prior to the
date for which the deposition is scheduled, on the party seeking to take the
deposition and any other attorney or party on whom the deposition notice was
served.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2025.410(a).) 
“A meet and confer declaration in support of a
motion shall state facts showing a reasonable and good faith attempt at an
informal resolution of each issue presented by the motion.” (Code Civ. Proc. §
2016.040.) 
A court shall impose monetary sanctions in
favor of the moving party if the motion to compel is granted, unless “the one
subject to sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code. Civ. Proc., §
2025.450(g)(1).)
III.            
DISCUSSION
Defendant seeks an order to compel Plaintiff’s
attendance and testimony at deposition as well as monetary sanctions against
Plaintiff and Plaintiff's counsel in the amount of $911.65. 
Defendant served Plaintiff with a notice of
taking deposition set for May 2, 2023. (Decl. Cadena, ¶ 3.) On April 28, 2023,
Plaintiff requested the deposition be rescheduled to a date in June; counsels
agreed to June 12, 2023. (Id., ¶ 4.) On May 4, 2023, Defendant served
Plaintiff with a notice of taking deposition set for June 12, 2023. (Id.,
¶ 6.) On June 8, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel requested the deposition be
rescheduled. (Id., ¶ 7.)  On June
20, 2023, Defendant served Plaintiff with a notice of taking deposition set for
July 25, 2023. (Id., ¶ 8.) On July 24, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel requested
the deposition be rescheduled. (Id., ¶ 9.)  On August 1, 2023, Defendant served Plaintiff
with a notice of taking deposition set for October 16, 2023. (Id., ¶ 10.)  On October 16, 2023, Plaintiff did not appear
for the deposition. (Id., ¶ 11.) 
Defendant met and conferred with Plaintiff’s
counsel following Plaintiff’s nonappearance by email, requesting new dates for
the deposition. (Motion, Exh. H.) As such, Defendant has met the requirement to
meet and confer after a nonappearance.
Plaintiff argues that this motion is
unnecessary as the deposition of Plaintiff was timely canceled on October 13,
2023, when Plaintiff’s counsel emailed Defendant’s counsel regarding a
scheduling conflict and Plaintiff’s unavailability for October 16, 2023. (Decl.
Godoy, ¶ 5; Exh. 1.)  Further,
Plaintiff’s counsel attempted to reschedule the deposition of Plaintiff to
November 8. (Id., ¶ 7.)  Through
exchanged emails, Plaintiff’s counsel contends Plaintiff’s deposition is
scheduled for December 21, 2023. (Id., ¶ 11.)  
The Court finds Defendant shows good cause to
support her motion to compel. Plaintiff gave three-day notice of not being able
to attend the deposition, however this appears to be a recurring pattern. While
there is a deposition calendared for December 21, 2023, four have been noticed
and rescheduled in the past, all at Plaintiff’s behest.  At this point, enough is enough.  
Therefore, Defendant’s motion to compel
deposition of Plaintiff is GRANTED. 
Plaintiff is hereby ordered to appear for his deposition as currently
scheduled on December 21, 2023.
As to sanctions, Defendant requests sanctions
against Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel in the amount of $911.65. Defendant
calculates these damages as follows: (1) $61.65 for court filing fees, (2) 2
hours of work drafting, filing, and presenting this motion at a rate of $250.00
per hour, $500.00 total, and $350.00 to cover the nonappearance fee with London
Court Reporter. (Decl. Cadena, ¶ 16.)  The Court grants sanctions as requested in
the amount of $911.65 against Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel, jointly and
severally. 
Moving party to give notice.
Parties who intend to submit on this tentative
must send an email to the Court at SSCDEPT27@lacourt.org indicating intention
to submit on the tentative as directed by the instructions provided on the
court website at www.lacourt.org.  Please
be advised that if you submit on the tentative and elect not to appear at the
hearing, the opposing party may nevertheless appear at the hearing and argue
the matter.  Unless you receive a
submission from all other parties in the matter, you should assume that others
might appear at the hearing to argue.  If
the Court does not receive emails from the parties indicating submission on
this tentative ruling and there are no appearances at the hearing, the Court
may, at its discretion, adopt the tentative as the final order or place the
motion off calendar.
Dated this 13th
day of December, 2023
