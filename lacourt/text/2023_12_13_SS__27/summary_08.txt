And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies Counsel's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel without prejudice. Counsel had properly filed a notice of motion and motion directed to Plaintiffs, submitted a declaration stating reasons for the motion, served the notice of motion and motion on parties, and lodged a proposed order relieving counsel. However, the declaration and proposed order did not state the dates of the upcoming hearings. The Court will consider whether Counsel's withdrawal can be accomplished without undue prejudice to the client's interests. The parties are advised to email the Court to indicate their intention to submit on the tentative, and if no submissions are received, the Court may adopt the tentative as the final order or place the motion off calendar.
