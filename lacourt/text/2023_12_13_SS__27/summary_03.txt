And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling granting Defendant's motion to compel Plaintiff's attendance and testimony at deposition, as well as monetary sanctions against Plaintiff and Plaintiff's counsel. The dispute centers around Plaintiff's failure to appear for scheduled deposition dates, despite multiple attempts by Defendant to reschedule and meet and confer with Plaintiff's counsel. The Court finds that Defendant has shown good cause to support her motion and that Plaintiff's repeated failures to appear for deposition have been unreasonable. Therefore, the Court orders Plaintiff to appear for his deposition as currently scheduled on December 21, 2023. The Court also grants Defendant's request for sanctions in the amount of $911.65 against Plaintiff and Plaintiff's counsel, jointly and severally.
