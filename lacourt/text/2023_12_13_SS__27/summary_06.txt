And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed the demurrer and motion to strike filed by defendants against the first amended complaint filed by plaintiff. The Court finds that the first and second causes of action in the FAC are sufficiently alleged and overrules the demurrer. The Court sustains the demurrer to the third cause of action in the FAC without leave to amend, as the allegations of alter ego doctrine are not sufficient to state a claim. The Court also grants the motion to strike with 20 days leave to amend.
