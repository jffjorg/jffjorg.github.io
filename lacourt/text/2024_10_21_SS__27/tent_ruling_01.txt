Insufficient  
Ruling:
DEMURRER AND MOTION TO STRIKE IS DENIED
 
On October 10,
2018, Plaintiff filed the present case. On May 16, 2024, Plaintiff filed his
proof of service. Defendants then filed their sixth motion to quash and motion
to dismiss. On June 10, 2024, the Court denied Defendant's sixth motion to
quash, and on July 25, 2024, denied the motion to dismiss. 
On August 19,
2024, Defendant filed a Declaration Regarding Meet and Confer.  On October 16, 2024, Defendants served at
demurrer that was filed on October 18, 2024, for a hearing date set for October
21, 2024.
This motion is
defective for several reasons. First, a motion must be served at least 16 court
days prior to the hearing (California Code of Civil Procedure § 1005(b)), but
this motion was served only 5 calendar days prior to the hearing. Plaintiff did
not file an opposition, presumably due to the shortened notice period, as
Plaintiff filed an opposition to all of Defendant’s prior motions.
Second, the
demurrer appears to have been filed after the deadline for demurrer.  California Code of Civil Procedure §
430.40(a) provides: "A person against whom a complaint or cross-complaint
has been filed may, within 30 days after service of the complaint, demur to the
complaint." The same applies to a motion to strike which must be brought within the time allowed to respond to a
pleading. CCP § 435 (b)(1).
If the parties
are not able to meet and confer at least five days prior to the date the
responsive pleading is due, the demurring party shall be granted an automatic
30-day extension of time to file a responsive pleading by filing and serving,
on or before the date on which the demurrer would be due, a declaration stating
under penalty of perjury that a good faith attempt to meet and confer was made
and explaining the reasons why the parties could not meet and confer. The
30-day extension shall commence from the date the responsive pleading was
previously due. (CCP § 430.41(a).)
Here, the proof
of service was filed on May 16, 2024, making the deadline to file the demurrer and
motion to strike June 16, 2024. Assuming Defendant argues that the deadline is
stayed or extended due to the filing of the motion to quash and the motion to
dismiss, the Court issued rulings on these motions in June and July,
respectively. Even if the declaration of the demurring party grants an
additional 30 days, the demurrer was served on October 16, 2024, well beyond
any applicable extensions. Thus, the demurrer and motion to strike failed to
give sufficient notice and are untimely. 
Accordingly, the demurrer is overruled and the motion to strike denied.
PLEASE TAKE NOTICE:
 
If a party intends to submit on this
tentative ruling, the party must send an email to the court at sscdept27@lacourt.org with the Subject line “SUBMIT” followed
by the case number.  The body of the email must include the hearing date
and time, counsel’s contact information, and the identity of the party
submitting.
 
Unless all parties submit by email
to this tentative ruling, the parties should arrange to appear remotely
(encouraged) or in person for oral argument.  You should assume that
others may appear at the hearing to argue.
 
If the parties neither submit nor appear at
hearing, the Court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative
ruling as the order of the Court.  After the Court has issued a tentative
ruling, the Court may prohibit the withdrawal of the subject motion without
leave.
