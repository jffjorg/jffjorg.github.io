And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendant's motion for relief and reconsideration of the prior ruling deeming the plaintiff's requests for admission, set one, as admitted. The defendant argues that the court was not aware of the fact that the defendant filed responses to the requests for admission before the motion was heard, and that a calendaring error resulted in the defendant's failure to file an opposition or appear at the hearing. The judge finds that the defendant's declaration stating that the responses were served shortly after the plaintiff filed the motion is uncontradicted and that the plaintiff will not be prejudiced by the error. The judge also finds that the defendant's failure to calendar the opposition deadline and hearing date was excusable and that the plaintiff did not allege any prejudice resulting from the error. As a result, the judge grants the motion and vacates the prior ruling.
