The Judge, Hon. Lee S. Arian, has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Merced Maldonado vs. Barrett Wissman, et al. The demurrer and motion to strike filed by the defendants is defective and untimely. The motion was served only 5 calendar days prior to the hearing, which is less than the required 16 court days. Additionally, the demurrer and motion to strike were served after the deadline, which is 30 days after service of the complaint. The Judge has denied the demurrer and motion to strike, and if the parties do not submit to the tentative ruling, they will need to appear remotely or in person for oral argument.
