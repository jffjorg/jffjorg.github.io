And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion for determination of good faith settlement filed by the Defendant City of Industry. The motion is unopposed, and the settlement agreement between the Defendant and the Plaintiffs (Coraline Rivera Martino and Daniel Martino) is for $250,000.00. The judge is required to determine whether the settlement was made in good faith. The judge will consider factors such as the amount of the settlement, the potential liability of the Defendant, and the allocation of settlement proceeds among the Plaintiffs. The judge will also consider the party asserting the lack of good faith has the burden of proof on that issue. The motion is granted, and the judge will enter a tentative ruling. The parties are advised to submit to the tentative ruling by email or appear remotely or in person for oral argument. If the parties neither submit nor appear, the judge may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the Court.
