```

And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling denies the motion to compel further responses to discovery and denies the request for monetary sanctions. The motion is procedurally defective because it is not accompanied by a separate statement, as required by the California Rules of Court. Additionally, the plaintiff did not file an IDC statement with the Court, which is required before the Court will hear any motion to compel further responses to discovery. The Court's Eighth Amended Standing Order for Procedures in the Personal Injury Hub requires counsel to participate in an IDC before the Court will hear any motion to compel further responses to discovery. As a result, the Court denies the motion and denies the request for monetary sanctions.
