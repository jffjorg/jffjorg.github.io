```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendants' demurrer to the plaintiffs' first amended complaint is sustained with 30 days' leave to amend. The first cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty is unclear and does not adequately describe the nature of the duty owed to the plaintiffs by the defendants. The third cause of action for fraud is also unclear and does not properly allege the elements of fraud. The judge has granted the defendants' request for judicial notice of the plaintiffs' first amended complaint. The judge has ordered the plaintiffs to amend their complaint within 30 days and has advised them that any proposed amendments must be authorized by the court's order.
