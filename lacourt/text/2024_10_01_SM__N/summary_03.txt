And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion filed by Ira M. Steinberg and Greenberg Glusker Fields Claman & Machtinger LLP to be relieved as counsel for defendant Nutiva. The reason for the withdrawal is that the client, Nutiva, has executed an assignment for the benefit of creditors and is insolvent and defunct. The judge has found that there is good cause to grant the motion, as the client has provided the required forms and served the opposing parties and client. The ruling will take effect upon filing of proof service of the ruling upon Nutiva. The judge also reminds Nutiva that as a corporation, it cannot represent itself in litigation and must be represented by licensed counsel.
