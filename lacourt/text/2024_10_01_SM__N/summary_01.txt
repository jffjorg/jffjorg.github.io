And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied Robert Meza's motion to reconsider the sanctions awarded in favor of Robert Lance. Meza's motion was untimely and lacked the required affidavit to support his claims. Even if the motion were timely and properly supported, Meza failed to show new or different facts, circumstances, or law that would warrant reconsideration. The judge found that Meza had ample opportunity to present his facts during oral argument, but failed to do so. The judge also noted that Meza's subjective belief that Lance would sign a stipulation to set the examination for a later date did not excuse his failure to appear for the physical examination.
