And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has considered the petition to confirm an arbitration award in favor of Kibre & Neman, LLP (Petitioner) against Gloria Govan (Respondent). The dispute arose from a failure to pay attorney fees, which was arbitrated and resulted in an award of $143,717.23 in favor of Petitioner. Since no opposition was filed, the court finds that the procedural requirements have been met and grants Petitioner's petition to confirm the arbitration award. The court orders Petitioner to file and serve a proposed judgment within 10 days and gives notice of this ruling.
