[TENTATIVE] order RE:
Plaintiff’s motion to compel compliance with agreement to produce
  responsive documents



 
Procedural Background
            On January 5,
2022, Plaintiff Coachella Valley Water District (“CVWD”) filed the instant
breach of contract action against Defendant Imperial Irrigation District
(“IID”).  The complaint asserts four
causes of action for (1) Declaratory Relief, (2) Breach of Contract, (3)
Accounting, and (4) Breach of Fiduciary Duty.
            On July 10, 2023, CVWD filed the
instant motion to compel IID’s compliance with its agreement to produce
responsive documents to Requests For Production of Documents (“RPDs”) Nos. 1-39,
41-61, and 63-76.  On July 19, 2023, IID
filed an opposition.  On July 25, 2023,
CVWD filed a reply.
            As additional time was needed to
produce the requested documents, on August 1, 2023, the Court continued the
instant motion to November 1, 2023. 
(Minute Order 8/1/23.)  On October
25, 2023, Plaintiff filed a supplemental reply.
 
Legal Standard
            Pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure section 2031.320(a), “[i]f a party filing a response to a
demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling under Sections 2031.210,
2031.220, 2031.230, 2031.240, and 2031.280 thereafter fails to permit the
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling in accordance with that party's
statement of compliance, the demanding party may move for an order compelling
compliance.”  (CCP § 2031.320(a).)
 
Discussion
            On January 23, 2023 – in
response to a pending motion to compel further responses – IID served
supplemental responses agreeing to produce all documents responsive to RPDs Nos.
1-39, 41-61, and 63-76.  (Porter 7/10/23 Decl.
¶ 13, Exh. F; Griffin 7/19/23 Decl. ¶ 5, Exh. 3.)  As of July 10, 2023, IIID failed to produce all
responsive documents.  (Porter 7/10/23 Decl.
¶ 30.)  
            Before the initial
hearing, IID previously represented that given the sheer number of documents
that it may take up until November 2023 to go through and produce all of the
responsive documents.  (Vega 7/19/23 Decl.
¶ 5; Minute Order 8/1/23.)  Accordingly,
based on this representation, the Court continued the instant motion to
November 1, 2023 for IID to produce the requested documents as requested.  (Minute Order 8/1/23.)  
            However, “[t]o date, IID
has not produced any additional records, nor has it provided the Net Proceeds
Statement for the year 2022 as called for by the parties’ 1934 Compromise
Agreement.”  (Porter 10/25/23 Decl. ¶
2.)  Accordingly, the instant motion to
compel IID’s compliance with its representation to produce documents is GRANTED
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.320.
 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff
Coachella Valley Water District’s motion to compel Imperial Irrigation
District’s compliance with its agreement to produce documents is GRANTED.
Defendant Imperial Irrigation District is
to produce all requested documents within thirty (30) days of notice of this
order.
Moving Party to
provide notice of this order and file proof of service of such.
