And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in plain English:

The judge is considering a motion by the plaintiff, Barbara Berkowitz, to set aside her waiver of a jury trial. The waiver was unintentional, and the plaintiff argues that granting relief from the waiver will not prejudice the other parties. The judge is using discretion to decide whether to grant the motion. The judge notes that the public policy favors trial by jury, and that granting relief from a waiver is generally allowed unless it would cause serious hardship to the other party. The judge finds that granting relief in this case will not cause hardship and therefore grants the motion.
