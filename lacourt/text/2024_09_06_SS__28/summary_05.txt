Summary in English text:

This tentative ruling is issued by the court in the case of Miguel Perez Galindo (Plaintiff) versus the City of Los Angeles, Cathy Dee Hooker, and Alan C. Stine (Cross-Defendants). The case involves a dispute over premises liability, and the Cross-Defendants seek to compel the Plaintiff's responses to requests for production of documents and interrogatories. The court grants the Cross-Defendants' motions to compel responses to both requests, ordering the Plaintiff to provide verified code-compliant responses without objections by September 27, 2024. The court also denies the Cross-Defendants' request for sanctions, as the law does not permit sanctions in this situation.
