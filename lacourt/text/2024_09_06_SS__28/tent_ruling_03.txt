LEGAL STANDARD 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 631 provides in part: 
“(a) The right to a trial by jury as declared by
Section 16 of Article I of the California Constitution shall be preserved to
the parties inviolate. In civil cases, a jury may only be waived pursuant to
subdivision (f). 
* * *
 “(f) A party waives trial by jury in any of the
following ways: 
* * *
 “(5) By failing to timely pay the fee described in
subdivision (b), unless another party on the same side of the case has paid
that fee. 
* * *
 “(g) The court may, in its discretion upon just terms,
allow a trial by jury although there may have been a waiver of a trial by
jury.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 631,
subds. (a), (f)(5), (g).) 
“
‘The right to a jury trial is a basic and fundamental part of our system of
jurisprudence . . . In case of doubt, therefore, the issue should be resolved
in favor of preserving a litigant’s right to trial by jury.’”  (R. Fairbank et al., Cal. Practice Guide:
Civil Trials and Evidence (Rutter 2022) ¶ 2:311, p. 2-68 (Cal. Practice Guide),
quoting Byram v. Superior Court (1977) 73 Cal.App.3d 648, 652; see Grafton
Partners v. Superior Court (2005) 36 Cal.4th 944, 958 [“any ambiguity or
doubt concerning the waiver provisions of section 631 must be ‘resolved in
favor of according to a litigant a jury trial’ ”].) 
“While
the matter is discretionary, ‘it is well settled that, in light of the public
policy favoring trial by jury, a motion to be relieved of a jury waiver should
be granted unless, and except, where granting such a motion would work serious
hardship to the objecting party.’ ” 
(Cal. Practice Guide, supra, ¶ 2:317, pp. 2-69 to 2-70, quoting Boal
v. Price Waterhouse & Co. (1985) 165 Cal.App.3d 806, 809.)  “Stated differently, ‘The Court abuses its
discretion in denying relief where there has been no prejudice to the other
party or to the court from an inadvertent waiver.’”  (Id. at p. 2-70, quoting Gann v.
William Bros. Realty, Inc. (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 1698, 1704.)  
DISCUSSION 
Plaintiffs
inadvertently waived their right to a jury trial by posting jury fees after the
deadline.  The waiver was unintentional. 
Lopez
and Martinez argue that the case is complex and a judge is
better suited than a jury to decide issues of liability, causation, and credibility.  Lopez and Martinez also argue that they will
be prejudiced by a jury trial because they will incur more litigation costs and
attorney’s fees than they would incur if the case proceeds as a bench trial. 
In
California, juries are regularly asked to decide important and complicated
issues.  Also, “[t]he prejudice which
must be shown to justify [denial of relief from jury trial waiver] is prejudice
from granting relief from the waiver, as opposed to prejudice from a jury
trial.” (Cal. Practice Guide, supra, ¶ 2:320, p. 2-70.)   
The
Court finds that granting Plaintiffs relief from waiver of a jury trial will
not prejudice the other parties.  The
Court exercises its discretion to grant the motion. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court GRANTS the motion for relief from jury trial waiver filed by Plaintiffs Abner
Blanco Ramirez and Rene Zarate. 
Moving
parties are ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
parties are ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
