Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers and has ruled as follows. The defendant, Angelus Funeral Home, has filed a motion to set aside the default judgment entered against it on April 17, 2024, for $69,764.82. The court previously denied a similar motion on July 18, 2024, because the defendant provided only inadmissible hearsay to support its assertion that its agent for service of process, Todd Davenport, was not in the office on the date of service and was not personally served.

The defendant has filed a new motion, which includes a declaration from Todd Davenport stating that he was not physically in the office on the day he was allegedly personally served and was never personally served. The court finds, however, that this motion does not comply with the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 1008, which governs applications for reconsideration of an order. The court therefore denies the motion.

The court notes that the defendant's new motion is not a new application, but rather a reiteration of the same argument made in its previous motion. The court also notes that the defendant has not presented new or different facts, circumstances, or law to support its motion, and therefore has not met the burden under Code of Civil Procedure section 1008. The court concludes that the motion is an improper request to reconsider its previous ruling and denies the motion accordingly.
