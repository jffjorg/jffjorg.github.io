considered the moving papers, the Court rules as follows.  
BACKGROUND 
On September
12, 2022, Plaintiff Miguel Perez Galindo (“Plaintiff”)
filed this action against Defendants City of Los Angeles (“City”), Cathy Dee
Hooker as an individual and as Trustee of the Cathy Dee Hooker Trust, and Does
1-50 for premises liability. 
On June 20, 2023, the City filed an answer and a
cross-complaint against Cross-Defendants Cathy Dee Hooker as an individual,
Cathy Dee Hooker as trustee of the Cathy Dee Hooker Trust, and Roes 1-10 for apportionment of fault, indemnification, and
declaratory relief. 
On
November 7, 2023, the City amended its cross-complaint to include
Cross-Defendant Cathy Dee Hooker, trustee of the Cathy Dee Hooker Separate
Property Trust, established October 14, 2009, as Roe 1, and Cathy Dee Hooker as
Roe 2. 
On
February 1, 2024, the City amended its cross-complaint to include
Cross-Defendant Cathy Dee Hooker, trustee of the Cathy Dee Hooker Separate
Property Revocable Trust, established October 14, 2009, as Roe 3. 
On
May 31, 2024, Cross-Defendants Cathy Dee Hooker and Alan C. Stine as Trustee of
the Cathy Dee Hooker Trust (erroneously sued and served as Cathy Dee Hooker as
Trustee of the Cathy Dee Hooker Trust) (“Cross-Defendants”) filed an answer. 
On
July 30, 2024, Cross-Defendants filed (1) a motion to compel Plaintiff’s
responses to request for production of documents, set one, and for sanctions, and
(2) a motion to compel Plaintiff’s responses to form interrogatories, set one,
and for sanctions.  The motions were set
for hearing on September 6, 2024. 
Plaintiff did not file oppositions. 
PARTY’S REQUESTS 
Cross-Defendants
ask the Court to compel (1) Plaintiff’s responses to request for production of
documents, set one and (2) Plaintiff's responses to form interrogatories, set one.  Cross-Defendants also ask the Court to award sanctions. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
A.   Inspection demand 
          Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.300 provides: 
        “If a party to whom a demand for
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a timely
response to it, the following rules shall apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the demand for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling is directed waives any objection to the demand,
including one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under
Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve
that party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230,
2031.240, and 2031.280. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The party making the demand may move for an order
compelling response to the demand. 
“(c) Except as provided in subdivision (d), the court
shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails to obey the order compelling
a response, the court may make those orders that are just, including the
imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in
addition to this sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). 
“(d) (1) Notwithstanding subdivision (c), absent
exceptional circumstances, the court shall not impose sanctions on a party or
any attorney of a party for failure to provide electronically stored
information that has been lost, damaged, altered, or overwritten as a result of
the routine, good faith operation of an electronic information system. 
“(2) This subdivision shall not be construed to alter
any obligation to preserve discoverable information.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300.) 
B.   Interrogatories 
          Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.290 provides:         
“If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails
to serve a timely response, the following rules apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the interrogatories are
directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under
Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to the interrogatories, including
one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4
(commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that
party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, and
2030.240. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The party propounding the interrogatories may
move for an order compelling response to the interrogatories. 
“(c) The court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to
interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails to obey an order compelling
answers, the court may make those orders that are just, including the imposition
of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in addition to that
sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010).” 
(Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290.) 
DISCUSSION 
          On June 14, 2024, Cross-Defendants served request for
production of documents, set one, and form interrogatories, set one, on
Plaintiff.  Plaintiff did not provide
timely responses and had not provided responses by the time Cross-Defendants
filed these motions. 
          The Court grants Cross-Defendants’ motion to compel Plaintiff's responses to the request for production of documents, set one.  The court orders Plaintiff to provide verified code-compliant responses without
objections and to produce the documents, electronically stored information,
and/or other things requested without objections by September 27, 2024. 
          The Court grants Cross-Defendants’ motion to compel Plaintiff's responses to form interrogatories, set one. 
The court orders Plaintiff to provide verified code-compliant responses to
the form interrogatories without objections by September 27, 2024. 
Cross-Defendants
request monetary sanctions on each motion. Under Code of Civil Procedure
sections 2030.290 and 2031.300, the Court shall impose a monetary sanction
against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a
motion to compel a response to interrogatories or a demand for inspection
unless the Court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.  (See Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (c) [interrogatories], 2031.300, subd. (c) [demand
for inspection].) 
Plaintiff
did not make or oppose a motion to compel responses to interrogatories or a
demand for inspection. Therefore, sanctions are not available under Code of
Civil Procedure sections 2030.290 and 2031.300. 
Other
statutes addressing misuse of the discovery process do not, by themselves,
authorize a sanctions award for these motions. 
In City of Los Angeles v. Pricewaterhousecoopers, LLP (Aug. 23,
2024) __ Cal.5th __ [2024 WL 3894042, 2024 DJDAR 8056, slip opn. pp. 1-42] (PwC),
the Supreme Court held: “It is already well-established that a court may not
rely on [Code of Civil Procedure] section 2023.030 to override the limitations
prescribed by any other applicable sanctions provision in the Act.  A court may
invoke its independent authority to impose sanctions under sections 2023.010
and 2023.030 only when confronted with an unusual form of discovery abuse, or a
pattern of abuse, not already addressed by a relevant sanctions provision.  And
where it invokes that authority, it is constrained by the long-settled rules
generally governing the imposition of discovery sanctions under the Act.”  (PwC, supra, __ Cal.5th __
[2024 WL 3894042 at *18, 2024 DJDAR at p. 8066, slip opn. at p. 40].) 
Code
of Civil Procedure sections 2030.290, subdivision (c), and 2031.300,
subdivision (c), limit the Court’s authority to impose sanctions when (as here)
the non-moving party does not oppose a successful motion to compel responses to
interrogatories or inspection demands. 
Because these statutes address the issue, the Court may not invoke its
independent authority to impose sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure
sections 2023.010 and 2023.030.  (See PwC,
supra, __ Cal.5th __ [2024 WL 3894042 at *18, 2024 DJDAR at p. 8066,
slip opn. at p. 40].) 
The
Court denies Cross-Defendants’ sanctions requests. 
CONCLUSION 
The Court GRANTS the motion of
Cross-Defendants Cathy Dee Hooker and Alan C. Stine as Trustee of the
Cathy Dee Hooker Trust to compel Plaintiff Miguel Perez Galindo’s responses
to request for production of documents, set one, and orders Plaintiff Miguel
Perez Galindo to provide verified code-compliant responses without objections
and to produce the documents, electronically stored information, and/or other
things requested without objections by September 27, 2024. 
The Court GRANTS the motion of Cross-Defendants Cathy
Dee Hooker and Alan C. Stine as Trustee of the Cathy Dee Hooker Trust to compel
Plaintiff Miguel Perez Galindo’s responses to form interrogatories, set one,
and orders Plaintiff Miguel Perez Galindo to provide verified code-compliant
responses to the form interrogatories without objections by September 27, 2024. 
The
Court DENIES the request for sanctions of Cross-Defendants Cathy Dee Hooker and
Alan C. Stine as Trustee of the Cathy Dee Hooker Trust.
