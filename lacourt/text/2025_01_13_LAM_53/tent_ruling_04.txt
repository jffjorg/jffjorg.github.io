plaintiff’s motion to compel responses to

MOVING PARTY:                Plaintiff Seran Ng, D.M.D., Inc.
   
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Defendant Yang Lu
Motion to Compel Responses to Special Interrogatories, Set 13, and
Request for Monetary Sanctions
The court
considered the moving papers and the response to the special interrogatories
filed in connection with this motion.  No
reply papers were filed.[1]

DISCUSSION
Plaintiff Seran Ng, D.M.D., Inc. (“Plaintiff”) moves the court for an
order (1) compelling defendant Yang Lu (“Defendant”) to serve responses to
Plaintiff’s Special Interrogatories, Set 13, and (2) awarding monetary
sanctions in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant in the amount of
$2,654.15.
If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a
timely response, the propounding party may move for an order compelling
response to the interrogatories.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd.
(b).)¿ 
Plaintiff asserts that it served on Defendant its Special
Interrogatories, Set 13, consisting of interrogatory number 154, on November
22, 2023.  (Chan Decl., ¶ 3.)  The court notes that Plaintiff did not file a
proof of service of the Special Interrogatories on Defendant, and instead has
attached only an email sent on that date to counsel for Defendant.  (Chan Decl., Ex. A, p. 1.)  While the court acknowledges that the email appears
to attach Special Interrogatories, Set 13, that email does not constitute a
proof of service.  (Ibid. [stating
“2 attachments [¶] 2023.11.22 – Seran – Plf’s SP Rogs S-13 to Lu.pdf . . .
.”].)  
Notwithstanding this defect, Defendant does not appear to dispute
service of the Special Interrogatories.  On
December 9, 2024, Defendant filed with the court “Defendant Yang Lu’s Response
to Plaintiff Seran Ng, D.M.D.’s Special Interrogatories, Set 13,” in which
Defendant answered Special Interrogatory number 154.[2]  (Dec. 9, 2024 Def. Response, p. 2:8-14.)  Thus, the court finds that Defendant has
submitted evidence establishing that she has since served responses to
Plaintiff’s Special Interrogatories, Set 13. 

The court therefore denies as moot Defendant’s motion to compel
Plaintiff’s responses to Special Interrogatories, Set 13.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (b).) 
The court finds that the circumstances presented would make the
imposition of sanctions unjust and therefore denies Plaintiff’s request for
monetary sanctions against Defendant. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (c).) 
ORDER
            The court denies plaintiff Seran Ng,
D.M.D., Inc.’s motion to compel responses to special interrogatories, set 13,
and request for monetary sanctions. 
 
            The court orders defendant Yang Lu
to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
