Determined by a Court to be Invalid and, if not, (2) Whether the Substitution

The court considered the
following papers filed in connection with the Order to Show Cause: (1) “Defendant

Declaration of Steven S. Vahidi in Support Thereof,” filed by Steven S. Vahidi
on behalf of defendant James Jones on November 21, 2024; (2) “Leslie Bushnell’s
(Agent for Defendant) Reply to Defendant James Jones Response to Order to Show
Cause re Substitution of Attorney,” filed by Leslie Bushnell on December 9,
2024; (3) “Defendant James Jones’ Supplemental Response to Order to Show Cause
re: Substitution of Attorney; Declaration of Steven S. Vahidi in Support
Thereof,” filed by Steven S. Vahidi on behalf of defendant James Jones on
December 16, 2024; and (4) the “Supplemental Declaration of Leslie Bushnell
(Agent for Defendant) in Reply to Defendant James Jones’ Supplemental Response
to Order to Show Cause re: Substitution of Attorney,” filed by Leslie Bushnell
on December 30, 2024.
DISCUSSION 
On June 13, 2024, the court
issued a minute order stating, inter alia, that it appeared to the court
that (1) at the time the answer to the Complaint was filed on behalf of
defendant James Jones (“Defendant”) in this action, Claudia Moody Jones (“C.
Jones”) had been appointed as conservator of Defendant’s estate, but the answer
was not filed by or on behalf of the conservator and therefore was filed
without authority and is subject to being stricken as improper, and        (2) since the Probate Court issued an order
appointing C. Jones as conservator, notice of the Final Status Conference,
trial, and other matters in this action might not have been properly given to
Leslie Bushnell (“Bushnell”) on behalf of Defendant since she might not have
been authorized to receive notices in this action on his behalf.  (June
13, 2024 Minute Order, pp. 2-3.)  Thus, the court set an Order to
Show Cause for hearing on August 7, 2024 (which was thereafter continued to
August 12, 2024), to address those issues. 
(June 13, 2024 Minute Order, p. 3.)
On August 12, 2024, the court
issued an order discharging the Orders to Show Cause.  The court noted, based on the evidence
presented in response to the Order to Show Cause, that “it [was] not clear that
Defendant’s answer was filed without authority because . . . Bushnell has (1)
submitted a copy of the Settlement Agreement executed by Bushnell, Defendant,
C. Jones, and N. Jones, in which the parties agreed that Bushnell (or, in the
alternative, N. Jones) would retain the rights and powers assigned to her in
the 2017 Durable Power of Attorney, limited to those necessary to act on behalf
of Defendant in any litigation, and (2) attested, in her declaration, that the
Probate Court approved the Settlement Agreement in Case No. 20STPB00627 on June
17, 2021.”  (Aug. 12, 2024 Order, p. 5:9-17.)
 
At the August 12, 2024 hearing
on the Orders to Show Cause, attorney Steven S. Vahidi (“Vahidi”) appeared,
asserting that Vahidi was representing Defendant.  (Oct. 10, 2024 Order, p. 1:27-28.)  Vahidi claimed that the Durable Power of
Attorney is not valid, while Bushnell claimed that Defendant is not competent
to make decisions about his estate and that she retains authority to act on
Defendant’s behalf.  (Oct. 10, 2024
Order, pp. 1:28-2:3.)  On August 12,
2024, Vahidi filed a “Substitution of Attorney – Civil” form on behalf of
Defendant, signed by C. Jones on Defendant’s behalf, stating that Vahidi had
substituted in as counsel to represent Defendant.  (Aug. 12, 2024 MC-050, ¶¶ 1-2.)  
Thus, on October 10, 2024, the
court issued an order in which the court stated that “[i]t appears to the court
that Vahidi may not have the authority to represent Defendant in this action
since the Durable Power of Attorney remains in effect with regard to Bushnell’s
authority to act on behalf of Defendant in litigation.”  (Oct. 10, 2024 Order, p. 2:7-9.)  The court also set for hearing on December
13, 2024, an Order to Show Cause (1) whether the Durable Power of Attorney
granting Leslie Bushnell the authority to act on defendant James Jones’s behalf
in prosecuting or defending litigation has been revoked or determined by a
court to be invalid and, if not, (2) whether the Substitution of Attorney –
Civil form filed by Steven S. Vahidi on behalf of defendant James Jones should
be stricken because Steven S. Vahidi did not have authority to sign and file it
on behalf of defendant James Jones. 
(Oct. 10, 2024 Order, p. 2:10-15; Oct. 10, 2024 Minute Order, p. 1.)  The clerk mailed notice of the court’s
October 10, 2024 minute order to Vahidi, counsel for plaintiff Law Firm of Fox
and Fox, Claudia Moody Jones, Defendant, and Bushnell.  (Oct. 10, 2024 Cert. of Mailing.) 
On December 13, 2024, the
parties and counsel appeared for the Order to Show Cause.  (Dec. 13, 2024 Minute Order, p. 1.)  At the Order to Show Cause, the court (1)
continued the hearing on the Order to Show Cause to January 13, 2025, and (2)
ordered that Vahidi Law Group and Bushnell may file supplemental papers not to
exceed two pages in length excluding exhibits. 
(Ibid.) 
Based on the evidence
presented by the parties, including the supplemental declarations, the court
finds that (1) the Durable Power of Attorney granting Bushnell the authority to
act on Defendant’s behalf in prosecuting or defending litigation has been
revoked, such that (2) Vahidi is permitted to represent Defendant in this
action pursuant to the August 12, 2024 Substitution of Attorney – Civil form,
signed by Defendant by and through his attorney-in-fact, C. Jones.  
The court sets forth the
relevant evidence below. 
Defendant executed the
“Durable Power of Attorney for Management of Property and Personal Affairs” on October
30, 2017, in which Defendant appointed Bushnell to be his attorney-in-fact and
granted her the authority to, inter alia, take actions with respect to
any claim that Defendant may have or has been asserted against Defendant with
respect to any legal proceeding.  (Vahidi
Decl., Ex. A, Durable Power of Attorney, ¶¶ 1.A, 2.A, subd. (10).)  On May 28, 2020, Defendant executed a
“Revocation of Durable Power of Attorney,” in which Defendant “revoke[d]” the
Durable Power of Attorney executed on October 30, 2017 and declared that “[a]ll
powers and authorities granted under said power of attorney are hereby
withdrawn and revoked effective immediately.” 
(Vahidi Decl., Ex. B.)  However,
the “Settlement and Mutual Release Agreement,” executed by Bushnell, Nicholas
Jones, C. Jones, and Defendant on December 21, 2020 included a provision in
which the parties “agree[d] that the . . . 2020 DPOA Revocation [i.e., Defendant’s
“Revocation of Durable Power of Attorney”] [is] invalidated upon the execution
of this Agreement by all parties.” 
(Vahidi Decl., Ex. C, Settlement, p. 1, § A [defining “2020 DPOA
Revocation” to be the Revocation of Durable Power of Attorney executed by
Defendant on May 28, 2020], p. 5, ¶ 2, subd. (a)(ii).)  Defendant does not dispute that the May 28,
2020 revocation was invalidated pursuant to this agreement.  (Def. Response to Order to Show Cause, p.
4:9-10 [“It is true that the Settlement Agreement in December of 2020 revoked
(at least partially), the May 28, 2020 revocation of Bushnell’s purported DPOA
of 2017”].) 
Thereafter, on April 21, 2021,
the Probate Court appointed C. Jones as the conservator for Defendant.  (Aug. 12, 2024 Order, p. 4:20-22 [citing Fox
Decl. filed June 17, 2024, Ex. A, ¶ 18].) 
On January 30, 2024, the Probate Court issued an order granting the
Petition to Terminate Conservatorship filed by C. Jones.  (Aug. 12, 2024 Order, p. 5:6-8 [citing
Bushnell Decl. filed July 24, 2024, Ex. M, Jan. 30, 2024 Minute Order].) 
In his supplemental
declaration in response to the pending Order to Show Cause, counsel for Defendant
has submitted the “California General Durable Power of Attorney” dated February
1, 2024, in which Defendant (1) “revoke[d] any and all power of attorney
instruments previously executed by” Defendant, and (2) appointed C. Jones as
his “agent (attorney-in-fact) to act for” Defendant, inter alia, “[t]o
commence, prosecute, discontinue, or defend all actions or other legal
proceedings touching [his] property . . . or touching any matter in which
[Defendant] or [his] property . . . may be in any way concerned.”  (Supp. Vahidi Decl., Ex. G, Feb. 1, 2024
Power of Attorney, pp. 2, 4, 5.)  The
February 1, 2024 Power of Attorney further stated that it “is effective
immediately and will continue until it is revoked.”  (Id. at p. 5.) 
Thus, the court finds that
Defendant has submitted evidence to show that he has revoked the Durable Power
of Attorney that appointed Bushnell as his power of attorney.  The court further finds that, because
Defendant has revoked that power of attorney and has appointed C. Jones as his
agent, effective February 1, 2024, C. Jones had the authority to sign the
“Substitution of Attorney – Civil” form appointing Vahidi as counsel for
Defendant on behalf of Defendant as his attorney-in-fact.[1] 
The court therefore orders
that the Order to Show Cause whether the Substitution of Attorney – Civil form
filed by Steven S. Vahidi on behalf of defendant James Jones should be stricken
because Steven S. Vahidi did not have authority to sign and file it on behalf
of defendant James Jones is discharged. 
            The court directs defendant James
Jones to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
