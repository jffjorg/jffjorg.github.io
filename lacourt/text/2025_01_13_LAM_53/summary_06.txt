And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the amended motion filed by Plaintiff Christopher Lemole, seeking an order imposing terminating sanctions against Defendant Dean Scott-Smith. The motion is based on Defendant's failure to comply with the court's March 6, 2024 order, granting Plaintiff's motion to compel Defendant's responses to Requests for Production of Documents.

The judge finds that Defendant failed to comply with the court's order, but exercises its discretion to deny Plaintiff's request for terminating sanctions. Instead, the judge orders Defendant to serve responses to the subject discovery and produce responsive documents within 20 days of the date of service of this order.

The judge also orders Defendant to pay additional monetary sanctions to Plaintiff in the amount of $1,500 within 30 days of the date of service of this order. The judge denies all other relief requested by Plaintiff.

The ruling is based on California Code of Civil Procedure sections 2023.030 and 2031.300, and cites to Victor Valley Union High School District v. Superior Court of San Bernardino County (2023) 91 Cal.App.5th 1121.
