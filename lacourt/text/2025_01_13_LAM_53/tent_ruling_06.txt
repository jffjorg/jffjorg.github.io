MOVING PARTY:                Plaintiff Christopher Lemole            
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Defendant Dean Scott-Smith
Amended Motion for Terminating and Monetary Sanctions
The court
considered the amended moving, opposition, and reply papers filed in connection
with this motion. 
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff Christopher Lemole (“Plaintiff”) moves the court for an
order (1) imposing terminating sanctions against defendant Dean Scott-Smith
(“Defendant”), striking Defendant’s answer, entering Defendant’s default, and
entering default judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant in the
amount of $53,899.10, (2) imposing monetary sanctions against Defendant in the
amount of $25,000, and (3) imposing monetary sanctions in favor of Plaintiff
and against Defendant in the amount of $1,500.  Plaintiff moves for this relief on the ground
that Defendant failed to comply with the court’s March 6, 2024 order. 
If a party engages in a misuse of the discovery process, the court may
impose monetary, issue, evidence, or terminating sanctions.¿ (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2023.030.)¿ “Misuses of the discovery process include, but are not limited
to, the following: [¶¶] (d) Failing to respond or to submit to an authorized
method of discovery. [¶¶] (g) Disobeying a court order to provide discovery.”¿
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subds. (d), (g).)¿ “When exercising its
discretion to determine which form of sanction is most appropriate for a
discovery violation, a trial court should consider various factors, including
‘the importance of the materials that were not produced—from the perspective of
the offended party’s ability to litigate the case—and what prejudice, if any,
the offended party suffered….’”¿ (Victor Valley Union High School District
v. Superior Court of San Bernardino County (2023) 91 Cal.App.5th 1121,
1158.) 
On March 6, 2024, the court issued an order granting Plaintiff’s
motion to compel Defendant’s responses to Plaintiff’s Requests for Production
of Documents, Set One.  (Mar. 6, 2024
Order, p. 2:22-23.)  The court ordered
Defendant (1) to serve responses to the Requests for Production of Documents
and (2) to produce responsive documents to those requests within 20 days of the
date of service of the court’s order. 
(Mar. 6, 2024 Order, pp. 2:24-3:2.) 
The court also ordered Defendant to pay monetary sanctions to Plaintiff
in the amount of $961.65 within 30 days of the date of service of the court’s
order.  (Mar. 6, 2024 Order, p. 3:3-4.)  On May 28, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Proof of
Service in which counsel stated that, “[o]n March 22, 2024, [counsel] mailed .
. . the following documents: Order Re: Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Responses
to Discovery” to Defendant at his address of record.  (May 28, 2024 Proof of Service, ¶¶ 3, 5 [the
order was served on Defendant at “54 Sole Street [¶] Eureka, CA 95503”]; Def.
Answer filed Mar. 1, 2023, PLD-C-010, p. 1 [listing Defendant’s address to be
54 Sole Street, Eureka, CA, 95503].)  Plaintiff submitted evidence establishing that
Defendant did not serve responses to the subject discovery within the time
ordered by the court and had not served responses as of the date that Plaintiff
filed the amended motion.  (Hemming
Decl., ¶ 12.) 
Defendant has opposed this motion, contending that (1) Defendant did
not receive, inter alia, the subject Requests for Production, Plaintiff’s
motion to compel his responses to the Requests for Production, and a copy of
the court’s March 6, 2024 order granting Plaintiff’s motion to compel, (2)
Defendant was not aware of the outstanding discovery until he spoke to
Plaintiff’s counsel telephonically on November 21, 2024, and (3) Defendant
retained counsel to address the pending discovery issues on December 4, 2024.  (Opp., pp. 2:11-13, 2:17-18, 3:2-4, 4:4-6.)  However, Defendant did not submit competent
evidence in support of those assertions. 

Defendant has submitted only the declaration of his counsel, who does
not have personal knowledge of Defendant’s non-receipt of the subject
discovery, motion, and court order. 
(Stone Decl., ¶¶ 1, 5, 7, 13.) 
Defendant did not submit his own declaration attesting to these
facts.  Moreover, the proofs of service
of the Requests for Production of Documents, motion to compel, and copy of the
court order all state that those documents were served on Defendant at his
address of record.  (Def. Answer filed
Mar. 1, 2023, PLD-C-010, p. 1 [Defendant’s address of record is 54 Sole Street,
Eureka, CA, 95503]; Pl. June 20, 2023 Mot. to Compel, Hemming Decl., Ex. B, p.
5 [Proof of Service of Requests for Production of Documents on Defendant by
mail at the address 54 Sole Street, Eureka, CA 95503]; Feb. 29, 2024 Proof of
Service, ¶¶ 3, 4, 5 [motion to compel was served on Defendant by mail at the
address 54 Sole Street, Eureka, CA 95503].)  The court further notes, and finds relevant,
that although Defendant’s counsel has stated that “Defendant will
participate in the discovery process with no further delays[,]” Defendant did
not submit evidence establishing that he has served responses to Plaintiff’s
Requests for Production of Documents as ordered by the court.  (Stone Decl., ¶ 20 [emphasis added].)  
The court therefore finds that Plaintiff has shown that Defendant
failed to comply with the court’s March 6, 2024 order.  The court, however, finds that terminating
sanctions are not appropriate for the reasons set forth below, and therefore
exercises its discretion to deny Plaintiff’s request for terminating
sanctions.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030,
subd. (d).) 
First, the court acknowledges that the court has issued monetary
sanctions against Defendant, which has not produced compliance with the court’s
orders.  However, the court has not yet
issued (and Plaintiff has not requested) other less severe sanctions against
Defendant, such as issue and evidence sanctions.  (Victor Valley Union High School District,
supra, 91 Cal.App.5th at p. 1158 [“The discovery statutes evince an
incremental approach to discovery sanctions, starting with monetary sanctions
and ending with the ultimate sanction of termination[,]” and the continuing
misuse of the discovery process will warrant incrementally harsher sanctions]
[internal quotation marks and citations omitted].) 
Second, although the court has concluded that Defendant did not submit
competent evidence establishing that he did not receive the discovery and
learned of the outstanding discovery in November 2024, the court has considered
Defendant’s conduct in opposing this motion and retaining counsel who has stated,
in his declaration, that Defendant shall participate in the discovery
process.  (Stone Decl., ¶ 20.) 
Third, the court finds, in order to remedy the prejudice suffered by
Plaintiff as a result of Defendant’s failure to comply with the March 6, 2024
order, that (1) additional monetary sanctions are warranted, and (2) it is
appropriate to order Defendant to, again, serve responses to the subject
discovery.  (Victor Valley Union High
School District, supra, 91 Cal.App.5th at p. 1158; Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2023.030, subd. (a).)  The court finds
that $1,500 (5 hours x $300 hourly rate) is a reasonable amount of sanctions to
impose against Defendant in connection with this motion.  (Hemming Decl., ¶¶ 14-15.)
ORDER
            The court grants in part plaintiff
Christopher Lemole’s motion for terminating and monetary sanctions as follows. 
            Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 2031.300, the court orders defendant Dean Scott-Smith (1) to serve on
plaintiff Christopher Lemole full and complete verified responses, without
objections, to plaintiff Christopher Lemole’s Request for Production of
Documents or Things, Set One, that comply with Code of Civil Procedure sections
2031.210 through 2031.250, and (2) to produce to plaintiff Christopher Lemole
all documents and things in defendant Dean Scott-Smith’s possession, custody,
or control which are responsive to those requests, within 20 days of the date
of service of this order.  
            The court orders defendant Dean
Scott-Smith to pay monetary sanctions to plaintiff Christopher Lemole in the
amount of $1,500 within 30 days of the date of service of this order. 
            The court denies all other relief
requested. 
            The court orders plaintiff
Christopher Lemole to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
