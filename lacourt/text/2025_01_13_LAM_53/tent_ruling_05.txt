[1] On
December 11, 2024, the court issued a Nunc Pro Tunc Order in which the court
continued the hearing on this motion from December 18, 2024 to January 13,
2025.  (Dec. 11, 2024 Minute Order, p.
1.)

The court notes that the response identifies the set of Special Interrogatories
to be set number one.  (Dec. 9, 2024 Def.
Response, p. 2:3.)  However, that appears
to be a typographical error, since (1) Defendant served a response to special
interrogatory number 154, which requests the identification of “each person who
resides at 8734 Festival St, Chino, California, from October 2020 to the
present[,]” and (2) that interrogatory was served with Plaintiff’s Special
Interrogatories, Set 13.  (Dec. 9, 2024 Def.
Response, p. 2:8-15; Chan Decl., Ex. A, p. 4:17-19.)
