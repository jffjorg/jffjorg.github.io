MOVING PARTY:              Plaintiff

RESPONDING PARTY:     None
1.    
Background
This is a partition action. Plaintiff Steen Sprouffske
(“Plaintiff”) alleges that he and Defendant George Moa (“Defendant”) own the
property located at 11579 Virginia Ave., Lynwood, CA 90262 (the “Property”) as
tenants in common. Plaintiff alleges that the parties have been unable to come
to an agreement as to how to divide the property.
2.    
Discussion

a.    
 Motion
to compel further discovery responses.
Plaintiff moves to compel further responses to
Requests for Production, Set One; Form Interrogatories, Set One; and Special
Interrogatories, Set One. Defendant did not file an opposition to the instant
motion.  Plaintiff served these discovery
requests on April 24, 2024.  More than
two months after his responses were due, Defendant served written responses and
belated objections to each set of discovery on August 12, 2024. 
Any party may
obtain any discovery of information, documents, land, property or
electronically stored information so long as the discoverable matter is not
privileged, is relevant to the subject matter and can lead one to admissible
evidence. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2017.010.)  “On
receipt of a response to a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or
sampling, the demanding party may move for an order compelling further response
to the demand if the demanding party deems that … [a] statement of compliance
with the demand is incomplete[;] … [a] representation of inability to comply is
inadequate, incomplete, or evasive[; or] … [a]n objection in the response is
without merit or too general.”¿(Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.310, subd. (a).) Such a
motion shall be accompanied by a declaration stating that the demanding party
made reasonable attempts to meet and confer with the nonmoving party in good
faith. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.310, subd. (b)(2); See also, Code of Civ. Proc. §
2030.300.)
A meet and confer declaration in support of a
motion shall state facts showing a reasonable and good faith attempt at an
informal resolution of each issue presented by the motion. (Code of Civ. Proc.
§2016.040.) The Discovery Act requires that, prior to the initiation of a
motion to compel, the moving party declare that he or she has made a serious
effort at negotiation and informal resolution of each issue. This rule is
designed to encourage the parties to work out their differences informally so
as to avoid the necessity for a formal order…’ “Argument is not the same as
informal negotiation” (Clement v. Alegre (2009) 177 Cal.App.4th 1277,
1293-1294, citing Townsend v. Superior Court (1998) 61 Cal.App.4th 1431 1435,
1437.) Attempting informal resolution means more than the mere attempt by the
discovery proponent “to persuade the objector of the error of his ways.”
(Townsend, supra at p. 1435). A reasonable and good faith attempt at informal
resolution entails something more than bickering with [opposing] counsel....
(Id.) Rather, the law requires that counsel attempt to talk the matter over,
compare their views, consult, and deliberate.” (Id. at p. 1439.)
Based on Plaintiff’s declarations, Plaintiff
has made adequate attempts to meet and confer. Plaintiff attempted to
communicate with Defendant concerning deficiencies in Defendant’s discovery
responses but was unable to obtain a timely response from Defendant. Plaintiff
filed the instant motion 42 days after Defendant served discovery responses,
only three days before the deadline, during which time Plaintiff sent Defendant
a meet and confer letter outlining deficiencies and requesting further
communication and negotiation, and attempted to follow up multiple times.
Defendant informed Plaintiff more than once that Defendant would call Plaintiff
regarding Defendant’s discovery responses, but Defendant did not call
Plaintiff.
After
consideration of Plaintiff’s arguments and separate statements, the court
grants Plaintiff’s motion to compel further responses as to requests for
production 29 through 57. Defendant has waived all objections by failing to timely
serve the objections in response to Plaintiff’s discovery requests. (Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007)
148 Cal.App.4th 390, 407.) The court grants Plaintiff’s motion to compel
further responses as to form interrogatories 2.3; 2.4; 2.5; 2.6; 2.8; 2.12;
2,13; 14.1; 50.4; 50.5; and 50.6. The court grants Plaintiff’s motion to compel
further responses as to special interrogatories 2 and 4 through 39. The court
denies Plaintiff’s motion to compel further responses as to special
interrogatories 1 and 3, as Defendant adequately responded to each of these
interrogatories.
//
b.      Motion to have
Plaintiff’s Requests for Admissions deemed admitted.
Plaintiff also separately moves for an order
deeming admitted Plaintiff’s Requests for Admission, Set One, also served on
Defendant on April 24, 2024.  Defendant
failed to serve any response to those requests, although this motion has been
pending since June 2024.  If a party to
whom requests for admission are directed fails to serve a timely response, all
objections to the requests are waived. 
(Code of Civ. Proc. § 2033.280.) 
The requesting party may move for an order that the genuineness of any documents
and the truth of any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as
well as for a monetary sanction.  (Ibid.)
 The court shall make the order, unless
it finds that the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed
has served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the
requests for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.  Defendant failed to do so.  (See, January 15, 2025 Declaration of Callum
Armijo.)
3.    
Sanctions

Plaintiff requests monetary sanctions in the amount of
$6,220 for costs and fees incurred, or anticipated to be incurred, in connection
with the motion to compel further discovery responses, and $4,060 in connection
with the motion to deem Requests for Admissions admitted.  Plaintiff seeks an award of monetary
sanctions against Defendant George Moa and his “counsel.”  The court finds that monetary sanctions are
warranted pursuant to Code of Civ. Proc. §§ 2030.290, 2031.300 and 2033.280, The
court finds counsel’s hourly rate of $400.00 is reasonable.     
With respect to the motion to compel furthers, the
court declines to award 6 of the hours of attorney time requested for reviewing
opposition, preparing a reply and preparing for the hearing as no opposition
was filed, and no reply was therefore necessary or actually filed.  The court also declines to award $180 in fiing
fees.  The three motions were filed as
one, as reflected in the reservation receipt attached to the notice of motion.
That receipt also indicates that no fee was charged, but in any event the standard
filing fee is $60.00. The court finds that $3,800 is a reasonable monetary
sanction for fees and costs incurred in connection with Plaintiff’s unified motion
to compel further responses. 
The court further
finds that monetary sanctions are mandatory pursuant to Code of Civ. Proc. §
2033.280, subdiv. (c), in connection with Plaintiff’s motion to deem Requests
for Admission admitted.  However, the
$4,060 Plaintiff seeks is unreasonable, as the motion is very redundant of the
motion to compel further responses, no separate statement was required, no
opposition or reply was filed, and all matters will be heard at the same
hearing.  Plaintiff’s request for
reimbursement for time spent drafting the discovery requests is improper. The
court awards $1260.00, comprised of the three hours spent drafting the motion at
$400.00/hour, and the $60 filing fee.  
The court denies
Plaintiff’s generic request for an award of monetary sanctions against Defendant’s
“counsel,” as the notice of motion failed to identify “every person, party, and
attorney against whom the sanction is sought,” as is required by Code of Civ.
Proc. § 2023.040. 
4.    
Conclusion

Based on the
foregoing, the court GRANTS in part Plaintiff’s motion to compel further
responses to Requests for Production, Set One; Form Interrogatories, Set One;
and Special Interrogatories, Set One. 
Defendant is ordered to serve verified, code compliant responses without
objection not later than two weeks following Plaintiff’s service of notice of
this order.  The court grants Plaintiff’s
motion to deem Requests for Admissions admitted, and each of those requests is
hereby deemed admitted. 
Defendant George Moa is ordered to pay monetary sanctions
in the amount of $5,060.00 to Plaintiff not later than February 24, 2025.

Plaintiff is ordered to give notice.       IT SO ORDERED.
DATED: January 21, 2025
