defendant’s demurrer to complaint
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Defendant Cummins Inc.        
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Plaintiff Ashchyan Transport, Inc.
Demurrer to Complaint
The court considered
the moving, opposition, and reply papers filed in connection with this demurrer.

DISCUSSION
Plaintiff Ashchyan Transport, Inc. (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against
In & Out Truck Repair, Inc. and Cummins, Inc. on December 15, 2023.  
Defendant Cummins, Inc. (“Defendant”) now moves the court for an order
sustaining its demurrer to the fourth cause of action for breach of the implied
warranty of merchantability. 
The court overrules Defendant’s demurrer to the fourth cause of action
for breach of the implied warranty of merchantability because (1) it states
facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, and (2) it is not ambiguous
and unintelligible and therefore is not uncertain.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subds. (e), (f).) 
First, the court finds that Plaintiff has alleged facts sufficient to establish
the elements of a breach of the implied warranty of merchantability since
Plaintiff has alleged that (1) Plaintiff ordered replacement Cummins engine
parts (Compl., ¶ 53), (2) the replacement engine parts were manufactured by
Defendant (Compl., ¶ 57), (3) the replacement engine parts were not of the same
quality as those generally acceptable in the trade, were not fit for the
ordinary purposes for which such goods are used, and did not conform to the
quality established by the usage of trade (Compl., ¶ 58), and (4) Plaintiff has
been harmed by this breach based on the catastrophic failure of the engine
parts (Compl., ¶¶ 56, 60).  (Com. Code, §
2314, subds. (2)(a), (2)(c).) 
Second, the court finds that this cause of action is not necessarily
barred by the statute of limitations on the face of the Complaint.  (Raja Development Co., Inc. v. Napa
Sanitary District (2022) 85 Cal.App.5th 85, 92 [“A demurrer based on a
statute of limitations will not lie where the action may be, but is not
necessarily, barred”] [internal quotation marks and citation omitted].) 
The court acknowledges, as Defendant raises in its demurrer, that the report
attached to the Complaint states that the date of an unspecified warranty began
on May 2, 2017.  (Compl., Ex. 1
[“Warranty Start 5/2/2017”].)  However,
this report does not establish that the date of tender of delivery of the
replacement engine parts that are the subject of this action was May 2, 2017,
such that this action, filed on December 15, 2023, is barred by the statute of
limitations.[1]  (Ibid.; Com. Code, § 2725 [“A breach
of warranty occurs when tender of delivery is made,” unless a warranty
explicitly extends to future performance and discovery of the breach must await
the time of that performance].)  
Thus, the court finds that Defendant has not shown that this cause of
action is barred on the face of the Complaint. 
(Raja Development Co., Inc., supra, 85 Cal.App.5th at p.
92.) 
ORDER
            The court overrules defendant
Cummins, Inc.’s demurrer to plaintiff Ashchyan Transport, Inc.’s fourth cause
of action for breach of the implied warranty of merchantability.
            The court orders defendant Cummins,
Inc. to file an answer to plaintiff Ashchyan Transport, Inc.’s Complaint within
10 days of the date of this order.
            The court orders plaintiff Ashchyan
Transport, Inc. to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  December 9, 2024
