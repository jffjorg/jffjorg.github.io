And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court considered a motion for injunctive relief or, in the alternative, leave to withdraw from arbitration filed by plaintiff Veronica Martinez. The motion was filed in response to defendant Public Health Foundation Enterprises, Inc., d/b/a Heluna Health's failure to pay fees required to continue an arbitration proceeding. The court denied the motion for injunctive relief, as the plaintiff did not cite any law establishing the court's authority to enjoin arbitration proceedings.

However, the court granted the alternative request to withdraw from arbitration and proceed in court. The court found that the defendant materially breached the arbitration agreement by failing to pay the fees required to continue the arbitration within 30 days after the due date, and therefore, the defendant is in material breach of the arbitration agreement, is in default of the arbitration, and waives its right to compel the plaintiff to proceed with the arbitration.

The court also found that the plaintiff has presented evidence showing that the defendant did not pay the invoice for the fees required to continue the arbitration until more than 30 days after the due date, and therefore, the defendant's payment was not timely. As a result, the court granted the plaintiff's motion to withdraw from the arbitration and proceed in court.
