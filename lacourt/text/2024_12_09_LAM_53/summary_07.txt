```

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the indemnification provision in the purchase agreement and has concluded that it does not violate Section 10138 of the California Insurance Code. The provision requires Lucier to indemnify and hold the Petitioner harmless against claims, losses, and expenses arising from breaches of the agreement. Section 10138 prohibits transfer agreements from including provisions that require the seller to indemnify and hold harmless the buyer in claims contesting the sale. However, the indemnification provision in this agreement is limited to breaches of the agreement itself, rather than claims contesting the sale. Therefore, the court finds that the provision does not violate Section 10138.
