And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the evidence presented and has reached some preliminary conclusions. The court notes that some objections are aimed at the verified allegations in the complaint, and has limited its ruling to the admissibility of those statements in relation to the pending motion to expunge. The court also recalls that on November 22, 2024, it issued an order sustaining the defendant's demurrer to the plaintiff's fourth, fifth, and seventh causes of action, without leave to amend. Therefore, the court will not address the defendant's arguments regarding those causes of action. Additionally, the court notes that the defendant purchased the subject property for $898,000.
