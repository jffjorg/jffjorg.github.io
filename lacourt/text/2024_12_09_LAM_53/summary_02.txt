And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motions of John C. Carpenter and Asa O. Eaton to be relieved as counsel for the three plaintiffs (Lacramioara Claudia Muntean, Katherine Kate Gray, and Diana Salazar) because they failed to provide sufficient proof of service of the moving papers to the clients and other parties involved in the case. The judge requires that the motions be accompanied by proofs of service that establish that all parties have been served with the moving papers as required by law. The motion is denied without prejudice, meaning that the counsel can re-file the motion with the necessary proof of service at a later time.
