The court notes that the purchase agreement includes a provision in which
Lucier agrees to “indemnify and hold [Petitioner] harmless against all claims,
loss, damages or expenses, including reasonabl[e] attorney fees, which
[Petitioner] may incur as a result of any breach or failure of any
representation or warranty contained hereunder or as a result of any breach of
any term or provision of the Agreement.” 
(Pet., Ex. 2, ¶ 5.4.)  Section
10138 states that a transfer agreement shall not include the following:  “Any provision that requires the seller to
indemnify and hold harmless the buyer, or to pay the buyer’s cost of defense,
in any claim or action brought by the seller or on the seller’s behalf
contesting the sale for any reason.”  (Ins.
Code, § 10138, subd. (a)(2).)  Thus, the
prohibition on indemnification clauses is limited to those provisions that
require the seller to indemnify the buyer in claims contesting the sale, such
that the indemnification provision in the purchase agreement here (which
requires indemnification as a result of a breach of the agreement) does not
violate section 10138.  (Ibid.)
