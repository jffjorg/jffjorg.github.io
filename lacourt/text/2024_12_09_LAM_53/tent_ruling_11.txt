[1] Plaintiff
requests an order staying arbitration pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
sections 1281.2, subdivision (c) and 1281.4. 
(Mot., pp. 4:8-9, 6:15.) However, (1) section 1281.4 does not authorize
the court to stay an arbitration proceeding, and (2) although section 1281.2,
subdivision (d) provides that, if the court determines that a party to the
arbitration is also a party to litigation in a pending court action or special
proceeding with a third party as set forth under subdivision (c), the court may
stay arbitration pending the outcome of the court action or special proceeding,
that provision is inapplicable to this case because, here, a party to the
arbitration agreement is not also a party to a pending court action or special
proceeding with a third party.

The court notes that the agreement states that the arbitrator “shall rely on
the California Arbitration Act, Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 1282 et seq. to conduct
the arbitration[.]”  (Kaplan Decl., Ex.
10, p. 57.)  Defendant contends that this
language shows that the parties intended only for section 1282 to govern the
arbitration agreement.  The court
disagrees.  Instead, this language
appears to incorporate the entire California Arbitration Act with an incorrect
citation to 1282 et seq.  Moreover, notwithstanding
this language, the procedural provisions of the California Arbitration Act
apply by default in California courts.  (Valencia
v. Smyth (2010) 185 Cal.App.4th 153, 174 [“the procedural provisions of the
CAA apply in California courts by default”] [emphasis in original].) 


[3]
The court notes that it appears that the parties stipulated to arbitration after
Plaintiff initiated arbitration based on the arbitration agreement in Defendant’s
employee handbook.  Neither party
disputes that issue.  Moreover, neither
party submitted the stipulation to the court.
