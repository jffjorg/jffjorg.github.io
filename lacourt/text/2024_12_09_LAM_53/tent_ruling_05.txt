The court notes that the report itself suggests that the replacement engine
parts might have been delivered in 2023. 
Specifically, the court notes that (1) the Complaint alleges that “[s]hortly
[]after” the engine rebuild was completed—i.e., using the replacement engine
parts manufactured by Defendant—the truck experienced a catastrophic failure
(Compl., ¶¶ 10-12, 54-57), and (2) the report, which is alleged to have
investigated the cause of the catastrophic engine failure (Compl., ¶¶ 13-14),
states the “Failure Date” to be August 29, 2023 (Compl., Ex. 1).  Thus, to the extent the failure date in the
report concerns the engine failure that occurred “shortly” after the engine
rebuild using the replacement engine parts manufactured by Defendant was
completed, the report appears to indicate that the delivery and rebuild of the
engine occurred in 2023.
