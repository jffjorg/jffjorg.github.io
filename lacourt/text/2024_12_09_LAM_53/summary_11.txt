And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a request by the plaintiff to stay an arbitration proceeding. The plaintiff argues that the court has the authority to stay the arbitration under Code of Civil Procedure sections 1281.2, subdivision (c) and 1281.4. However, the judge finds that section 1281.4 does not authorize a stay of arbitration, and section 1281.2, subdivision (d) is not applicable to this case because no party to the arbitration is also a party to a pending court action or special proceeding with a third party.

The judge also notes that the arbitration agreement states that the arbitrator will rely on the California Arbitration Act to conduct the arbitration, but disagrees with the defendant's contention that this language only incorporates section 1282 of the act. Instead, the judge believes that the language incorporates the entire California Arbitration Act, even if the citation is incorrect.

The judge further notes that, regardless of the language in the agreement, the procedural provisions of the California Arbitration Act apply by default in California courts. Finally, the judge points out that neither party submitted the stipulation to arbitration to the court, and that the parties stipulated to arbitration after the plaintiff initiated arbitration based on the arbitration agreement in the defendant's employee handbook.
