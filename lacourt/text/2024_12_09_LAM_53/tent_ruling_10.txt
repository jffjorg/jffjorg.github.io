MOVING PARTY:                 Plaintiff Veronica Martinez    
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Defendant Public Health Foundation Enterprises, Inc., d/b/a
Heluna Health
Motion for Injunctive Relief or, in the Alternative, Leave to Withdraw
from Arbitration
The court
considered the moving and opposition papers filed in connection with this
motion.  No reply papers were filed.
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff Veronica Martinez (“Plaintiff”) filed the pending motion on
September 30, 2024, moving the court for an order issuing an injunction to stay
the arbitration proceedings between Plaintiff and defendant Public Health
Foundation Enterprises, Inc., d/b/a Heluna Health (“Defendant”).  Alternatively, Plaintiff requests leave to
withdraw from arbitration and proceed with her claims in court. 
First, the court denies Plaintiff’s request for injunctive relief
because Plaintiff has not cited law establishing that the court has authority
to enjoin arbitration proceedings under the circumstances presented.[1]

Second, the court grants Plaintiff’s alternative request that
the court permit her to withdraw from arbitration and proceed in court.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.98.)
Code of Civil Procedure “[s]ections 1281.97 and 1281.98 ‘largely
parallel’ each other.  [Citation.]  Whereas section 1281.97 concerns
a failure to timely pay ‘the fees or costs to initiate’ an arbitration
proceeding [citation], section 1281.98 concerns a failure to timely pay ‘the
fees or costs required to continue’ an arbitration proceeding
[citation].”  (De Leon v. Juanita’s Foods (2022) 85 Cal.App.5th
740, 750 [internal citations omitted].)  In an employment or consumer
arbitration that requires the drafting party to pay certain fees and costs
during the pendency of an arbitration proceeding, if the fees or costs required
to continue the arbitration are not paid within 30 days after the due date, the
drafting party is in material breach of the arbitration agreement, is in
default of the arbitration, and waives its right to compel the employee or
consumer to proceed with that arbitration as a result of the material
breach.  (Code Civ. Proc., §¿1281.98, subd. (a)(1).)  If the drafting
party materially breaches the arbitration agreement and is in default under
section 1281.98, subdivision (a), the employee or consumer may elect to, inter
alia, withdraw the claim from arbitration and proceed in a court of
appropriate jurisdiction.  (Code Civ. Proc., §¿1281.98, subd.
(b)(1).)  
The court finds that Plaintiff has presented evidence showing that Defendant
materially breached the arbitration agreement and is in default under section
1281.98, and therefore grants Plaintiff’s motion. 
As a threshold matter, the court notes that, in its opposition,
Defendant contends that Plaintiff’s motion is moot because the arbitration
hearing was completed on October 22, 2024. 
The court disagrees.  It appears
that the arbitrator has not yet issued a final award in the arbitration
proceeding, such that arbitration is still pending.  (Opp., p. 7:8-14 [asserting that
post-arbitration briefing is to be completed by February 2025, and the
arbitrator will issue the final decision within 30-60 days thereafter].)  Thus, the court finds that Plaintiff’s motion
is not moot. 
The court further finds that it has the jurisdiction to determine
whether Plaintiff may withdraw from arbitration under section 1281.98.  (Williams v. West Coast Hospitals, Inc. (2022)
86 Cal.App.5th 1054, 1068 [“As courts of general jurisdiction, California’s
superior courts are generally empowered to resolve the legal disputes that are
brought to them”], 1069 [“The trial court’s review of the withdrawal [under
section 1281.98] is within its vestigial jurisdiction.  Even if the matter were not within the trial
court’s vestigial jurisdiction, the Legislature’s unambiguous provision for
employees and consumers covered by section 1281.98 to unilaterally withdrawn
from arbitration and proceed in a court of appropriate jurisdiction compels the
conclusion that the Legislature intended courts to exercise jurisdiction over
such proceedings, as a matter of law”].)  Moreover, the court is not “dismissing” the
arbitration claims in ruling on Plaintiff’s motion.  (Opp., pp. 13:18-16:13 [arguing that the
power to dismiss for failure to prosecute or delay lies with the
arbitrator].)  The court also notes that
it is not “conduct[ing] an emergency appellate review of the Arbitrator’s
ruling[s]” denying Plaintiff’s motions to stay arbitration, but is independently
determining whether Plaintiff has shown that she may withdraw from arbitration
under section 1281.98.  (Opp., p.
8:25-28.) 
Defendant also contends that section 1281.98 does not apply because
(1) the parties entered into the arbitration agreement before the statute was
enacted, and (2) the arbitration agreement excludes applicability of the
California Arbitration Act.  The court
disagrees.  While the arbitration
agreement was entered into on May 16, 2019, section 1281.98 does not state that
it does not apply to arbitration agreements executed prior to its date of
enactment, and the breach occurred after its enactment.  The arbitration agreement also states that arbitrability
of claims and the conducting of arbitration proceedings shall be governed by
the California Arbitration Act, which includes section 1281.98.  (Kaplan Decl., Ex. 10, pp. 56 [the arbitrability
of any claim thereunder shall be determined by the substantive provisions of
the Federal Arbitration Act and the procedural provisions of the California Arbitration
Act], 57 [“the arbitrator shall rely on the California Arbitration Act”][2].)  Further, while Defendant argues that section
1281.98, by its “plain language,” only applies to proceedings in which a court
has granted a petition to compel arbitration, Defendant has not cited to such
language in the statute.
The arbitration agreement was included in Defendant’s employee
handbook.  (Kaplan Decl., Ex. 10.)  The arbitration agreement applies to any
claims between Plaintiff and Defendant, subject to certain exceptions, and also
provides that the costs of the arbitrator and other incidental costs of
arbitration shall be borne by Defendant. [3]  (Id. at pp. 56, 57.)  The court notes that Defendant has not
disputed that it is the drafting party of the underlying arbitration agreement.  Moreover, the court notes that the
arbitration agreement appears to be a form agreement included in Defendant’s
employee handbook, which indicates that Defendant was the drafting party within
the meaning of section 1281.98.  (Ibid.)  Thus, the court finds that the underlying
arbitration is subject to section 1281.98 as an employment arbitration that
requires the drafting party (i.e., Defendant) to pay certain fees and costs
during the pendency of an arbitration proceeding.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.98, subd. (a).) 
Plaintiff has presented evidence showing that JAMS issued an invoice
to Defendant dated March 4, 2024, for the amount of $113,000.  (Zavala Decl., Ex. 1.)  Payment was due on receipt thereof.  (Ibid.)  Defendant does not dispute that it did not pay
the invoice until August 13, 2024, more than 30 days after the date the invoice
was issued.  (Zavala Decl., ¶ 2.)  Defendant has not presented evidence
establishing that the invoice was not due within 30 days of March 4, 2024, that
all parties agreed to extend the time by which to pay the invoice, or otherwise
argued that its payment was timely. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.98, subd. (a)(2) [“Any extension of time for
the due date shall be agreed upon by all parties”].) 
Thus, the court finds that (1) Defendant materially breached the
arbitration agreement by failing to pay the fees required to continue
arbitration within 30 days after the due date of March 4, 2024, and (2)
Defendant is therefore in material breach of the arbitration agreement, is in
default of the arbitration, and waives its right to compel Plaintiff to proceed
with arbitration as a result of the material breach.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.98, subd.
(a)(1).)  
ORDER
            The court grants plaintiff Veronica
Martinez’s motion for injunctive relief or, in the alternative, for leave to
withdraw from arbitration in part as follows.
            Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 1281.98, the court orders that plaintiff Veronica Martinez is permitted
(1) to withdraw her claims in arbitration against defendant Public Health
Foundation Enterprises, Inc., d/b/a Heluna Health, and (2) to proceed in a
court of appropriate jurisdiction.
            The court orders plaintiff Veronica
Martinez to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
