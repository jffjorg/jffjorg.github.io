And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied Plaintiff Manuel Parravicini's motion to strike Defendant APAC Sale Group, Inc.'s answer, with the intention of setting an Order to Show Cause (OSC) to strike the answer and enter default against the defendant. The defendant had filed a substitution of attorney form on August 4, 2023, indicating that it would proceed in propria persona, but has since failed to obtain counsel. The court acknowledges that corporations generally may not represent themselves in legal proceedings outside of small claims court, but believes that it is the duty of the trial judge to advise the representative of the corporation of the necessity to be represented by an attorney. Therefore, the court will grant the defendant the opportunity to retain counsel before striking the answer and entering default.
