I.               
MOTION TO
STRIKE ANSWER
Plaintiff Manuel Parravicini (Plaintiff) moves to strike the answer of
Defendant APAC Sale Group, Inc. (APAC) on the grounds that APAC on August 4,
2023, filed a substitution of attorney form indicating that it would proceed in
propria persona, and has to date made no effort to obtain counsel for itself.
(Motion at pp. 4–5.)
“Every court shall have the power to do all of the following: . . . (3)
To provide for the orderly conduct of proceedings before it, or its officers,”
and “To compel obedience to its judgments, orders, and process, and to the
orders of a judge out of court, in an action or proceeding pending therein.”
(Code Civ. Proc. § 128, subd. (a)(3), (4).)
Corporations
generally may not represent themselves in legal proceedings outside of small claims
court. (See Van Gundy v. Camelot Resorts,
Inc. (1983) 152 Cal.App.3d Supp. 29, 31.) “[T]he court retains authority to
dismiss an action if an unrepresented corporation does not obtain counsel
within reasonable time.” (CLD Construction, Inc. v. City of
San Ramon (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 1141, 1150.)
APAC filed a substitution of counsel on August 4, 2023, and
it has arguably had a reasonable time in which to obtain counsel. However,“[i]t
is the duty of the trial judge to advise the representative of the corporation of
the necessity to be represented
by an attorney.” (Gamet v. Blanchard (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 1276, 1284
fn. 5.) As APAC has evidently had no prior judicial warning of the consequences
of failing to retain counsel — i.e. striking its answer and entering its
default — it is appropriate to grant it the opportunity to retain counsel
pursuant to such a warning.
The motion is therefore DENIED. An Order to Show Cause re:
the striking of Defendant APAC’s answer and the entry of default against it for
failing to obtain counsel shall be set.
