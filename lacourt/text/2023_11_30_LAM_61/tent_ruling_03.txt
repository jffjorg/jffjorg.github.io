Defendants to give notice.
 
I.               
MOTION TO
EXPUNGE LIS PENDENS
“‘A lis pendens is a recorded
document giving constructive notice that an action has been filed affecting
title to or right to possession of the real property described in the notice.’ [Citation.]
A lis pendens may be filed by any party in an action who asserts a ‘real
property claim.’ [Citation.] Section 405.4 defines a ‘“Real property claim”’ as
‘the cause or causes of action in a pleading which would, if meritorious,
affect (a) title to, or the right to possession of, specific real property . . .
.’ ‘If the pleading filed by the claimant does not properly plead a real
property claim, the lis pendens must be expunged upon motion under CCP 405.31.’
[Citation.]” (Kirkeby v. Superior Court of Orange County (2004) 33
Cal.4th 642, 647.)
“The potential for a notice of
lis pendens to pour sand into the smooth gears of a real estate transaction has
been well remarked in the cases.” (Gale v. Superior Court (“Gale”) (2004) 122 Cal.App.4th 1388,
1394.) “[T]he question of whether pleadings state a real property claim is
tested by a ‘“demurrer-like analysis’” that centers on the adequacy of the
pleading. [Citation.] It is strictly a binary process: If you properly plead a
real property claim, you can file a notice of lis pendens; if you don't, you
can't.” (Id. at p. 1395.) 
Code Civ. Proc. section 405.32
provides that “[i]n proceedings under this chapter, the court shall order that
the notice be expunged if the court finds that the claimant has not established
by a preponderance of the evidence the probable validity of the real property
claim.” 
“Unlike other motions, the
burden is on the party opposing the motion to expunge — i.e., the
claimant-plaintiff — to establish the probable validity of the underlying
claim. [Citation.] The claimant-plaintiff must establish the probable validity
of the claim by a preponderance of the evidence.” (Howard S. Wright
Construction Co. v. Superior Court (2003) 106 Cal.App.4th 314, 319.) “[T]he
plaintiff must ‘at least establish a prima facie case. If the defendant makes
an appearance, the court must then consider the relative merits of the
positions of the respective parties and make a determination of the probable
outcome of the litigation.’ [Citation.]” (Ibid.) 
Defendants Jon Greenfield and 21326 Ventura, LLC (Defendants) move to
expunge a notice of lis pendens recorded against the property on 21326 Venture
Boulevard in Los Angeles (subject property), on the grounds that this court has
sustained their demurrer to the Complaint without leave to amend, and Plaintiff
Garry Itkin (Plaintiff) therefore cannot establish the probable validity of his
claims. (Motion at pp. 3–6.)
Plaintiff in oppositions offers the same authorities and arguments that
it presented in support of its opposition to Defendants’ demurrer. (Opposition
at pp. 4–5, citing Moreland Development Co. v. Gladstone Holmes, Inc.
(1982) 135 Cal.App.3d 973; Jacobs v. Freeman (1980) 104 Cal.App.3d 177; see
7/11/2023 Order.) Because Plaintiff offers no reasons to embrace his
position other than those the court rejected in sustaining Defendants’
demurrer, Plaintiff has made no showing that he is likely to prevail on appeal
The motion to expunge lis
pendens is therefore GRANTED. 
II.            
SANCTIONS
“The court shall direct that
the party prevailing on any motion under this chapter be awarded the reasonable
attorney's fees and costs of making or opposing the motion unless the court
finds that the other party acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of attorney's fees and costs unjust.” (Code
Civ. Proc. § 405.38.)
Defendants seek sanctions in the
amount of $4,850.00 in fees associated with the motion, representing eight
hours of law clerk work at $300 per hour, plus 3.5 hours of attorney work at
$700 per hour. (Schorr Decl. ¶¶ 12–18.) Although Plaintiff challenges the
number of hours and the hourly rates here, these rates are supported by
Schorr’s experience, as stated in the declaration. (Opposition at pp. 5–7;
Schorr Decl. ¶¶ 12–18.) Sanctions are awarded against Plaintiff in the amount
of $3,650.
