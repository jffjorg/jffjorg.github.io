The judge found that Plaintiff failed to establish a triable issue of fact and that Defendant's policies against unsolicited submissions precluded the creation of an implied-in-fact contract. The judge also granted Defendant's motion to seal certain records, finding that the information contained therein was confidential and could be prejudicial if disclosed.
