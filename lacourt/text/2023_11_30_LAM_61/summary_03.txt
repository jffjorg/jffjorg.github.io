And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving a motion to expunge a lis pendens notice recorded against a property. The lis pendens notice was recorded by the Plaintiff, Garry Itkin, who is seeking to establish a real property claim against the property. However, the Plaintiff's Complaint was sustained without leave to amend, and the Judge has found that the Plaintiff has not established the probable validity of his claims.

As a result, the Judge has granted the motion to expunge the lis pendens notice. The Judge has also awarded sanctions against the Plaintiff in the amount of $3,650, which is a portion of the fees sought by the Defendants, 21326 Ventura, LLC and Jon Greenfield, in the amount of $4,850.00.

The Judge's decision is based on the fact that the Plaintiff's pleading does not properly state a real property claim, and the Plaintiff has not established the probable validity of his claims. The Judge has also relied on case law and statutes, including Code of Civil Procedure sections 405.4, 405.31, 405.32, and 405.38.
