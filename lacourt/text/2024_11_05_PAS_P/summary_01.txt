And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiffs' motion to seal Exhibits 1 and 2 attached to the Declaration of Thomas B. Murtland. The motion was filed to protect sensitive information that identifies the plaintiffs as victims of childhood sexual assault. The judge finds that the request to seal is necessary to protect the plaintiffs' privacy and prevent further exposure. The court agrees with the plaintiffs that the proposed sealing is narrowly tailored and that no less restrictive alternative exists. The judge also finds that the interest in protecting individuals involved in sensitive matters justifies sealing the records, as the plaintiffs could be prejudiced if their identities were disclosed.
