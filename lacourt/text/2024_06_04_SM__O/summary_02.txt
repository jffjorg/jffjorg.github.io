And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has granted the Petitioner's Motion to Compel Arbitration, as there is a valid arbitration agreement between the parties. The Court orders the parties to stipulate to an arbitrator within five days from the hearing. If no arbitrator is mutually selected within this timeframe, the Court will select the arbitrator from the list provided by the parties. The Court has also determined that there has been no waiver to arbitrate by the Petitioner and that the Respondent provides no grounds for rescission of the agreement.
