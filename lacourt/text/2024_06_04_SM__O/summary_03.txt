And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the defendants' demurrer without motion to strike is SUSTAINED as to each cause of action in the plaintiff's complaint. This means that the plaintiff has failed to state a valid legal claim for trespass to land, trespass to chattels, intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligent infliction of emotional distress, and conversion.

The judge has granted the defendants' request for judicial notice, which means that the defendants have successfully proven that the plaintiff does not own the Casiano Property and has no right to occupy or possess it. The plaintiff has also failed to plead sufficient facts to meet the elements of each cause of action.

The judge has given the plaintiff 20 days to amend their complaint to try to state a valid legal claim. If the plaintiff fails to do so, the defendants will be entitled to judgment in their favor.
