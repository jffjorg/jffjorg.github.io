23SMCV02908 Flood-Cide Motion to Vacate Default
 
Defendant
Helen Mohsenzadeh's Motion to Vacate Default is GRANTED pursuant to CCP §
473(d). Default was entered on 10-24-23. Defendant filed this motion on
4-25-24, and no opposition has been filed as of 5-30-24.  "Under
section 473, subdivision (d), the court may set aside a default judgment which
is valid on its face, but void, as a matter of law, due to improper service.
"(Hearn v. Howard (2009) 177 Cal.App.4th 1193, 1200; See Code Civ.
Pro. § 473, subd. (b).)  
 
The
Plaintiff Flood-Cide Restoration & Construction, Inc
("Flood-Cide") provide a proof of service which includes a
declaration from the service processer including multitple attempts attempts to
serve Defendant at 3314 Van Allen Place, Topanga Canyon, CA 90290 (the
"Van Allen Place Address"), the conversation with gate guard at the
address, the alleged gate guards phone calls to the residence, and the alleged
conversation with Defendant stating to leave the forms with the gate guard.
(See Mohsenzadeh Decl., ¶ 6, Ex. A.) The gate guard statements, and the alleged
statements by Defendant while on speaker phone, are hearsay without an
exception to the hearsay rule (See Evid. Code, § 1200.) Without more foundation
these statements are not admissible and do not meet the Plaintiffs burden to
prove substitute service. Thus, because there was no effective service of
process, the default judgment is void. (see Dill
v. Berquist Construction Co. (1994) 24
Cal.App.4th 1426, 1444 ["[C]ompliance with the statutory procedures for
service of process is essential to establish personal jurisdiction . . . .
Thus, a default judgment entered against a defendant who was not served with a
summons in the manner prescribed by statute is void"].)
