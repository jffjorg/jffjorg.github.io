And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants Defendant Helen Mohsenzadeh's Motion to Vacate Default. The default judgment was entered on October 24, 2023, and the Defendant filed the motion on April 25, 2024. Despite the Plaintiff's failure to file opposition, the Judge finds that the default judgment is invalid due to improper service. The Plaintiff provided a proof of service, which includes a declaration from the service processor and alleged conversations with the gate guard at the Defendant's address. However, the Judge finds that these statements are hearsay and do not meet the Plaintiff's burden to prove substitute service. Since there was no effective service of process, the default judgment is void.
