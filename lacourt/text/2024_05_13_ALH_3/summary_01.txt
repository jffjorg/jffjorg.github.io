Here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

This tentative ruling addresses the demurrer filed by Cross-Defendants (Lyco 1, LLC, Randy, and Alice) to Ngoc's cross-complaint seeking a declaratory judgment establishing a life estate in the Property. The Court finds that Ngoc's cross-complaint does not state sufficient facts to support her claim to a life estate and sustains the demurrer with 20 days' leave to amend. The Court also finds that Ngoc's cross-complaint does not implicate Michael's interests in the Property and therefore does not require joining Michael as a party to the cross-complaint.
