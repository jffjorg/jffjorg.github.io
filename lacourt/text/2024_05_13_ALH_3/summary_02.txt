And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The Court has considered the demurrer filed by the Defendant, State of California, and has sustained the demurrer as to the First Cause of Action (negligence) with 20 days' leave to amend. The Court has also sustained the demurrer as to the Third Cause of Action (dangerous condition of public property) with 20 days' leave to amend. The Court has sustained the demurrer as to the Second Cause of Action (premises liability) without leave to amend. The Court has rejected the Defendant's argument that Plaintiffs are obligated to identify a particular employee who committed a tortious act in order to state a valid claim. The Court has also rejected the Defendant's blanket assertion that a public entity cannot be held liable for the acts and omissions of its independent contractors.
