And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants defendant Flavio Vanoff's motion for leave to file a first amended answer, alleging an accord with plaintiff Rosario Villalobos. The judge finds that the amendment is proper, as the defendant did not provide a declaration describing when the underlying facts were learned, but states that counsel was not aware of the full scope and contents of the pre-litigation discussions when the initial answer was filed. The judge also finds that there is no basis to conclude that the addition of this new affirmative defense would delay the trial. The judge notes that plaintiff's opposition to the motion is deficient and that the defendant has met the requirements for a motion for leave to amend. The judge orders that the first amended answer be deemed filed as of the date of entry of this order.
