Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has ruled that the demurrer to the fifth and sixth causes of action in the plaintiff's complaint is sustained without leave to amend. The fifth cause of action alleges fraudulent inducement, and the court finds that the plaintiff's allegations are not sufficiently specific to state a cause of action. The court previously advised the plaintiff to specifically allege the representations made by the defendants, but the plaintiff failed to do so upon amending the complaint.

The sixth cause of action alleges a violation of California Blue Sky Laws, and the court finds that the plaintiff's allegations are too vague and conclusory to state a cause of action. The court sustains the demurrer to this cause of action because the plaintiff fails to allege the specific nature of the misrepresentations made by the defendants.

The defendants are ordered to file and serve an answer to the plaintiff's second amended complaint within 10 days of the entry of this order.
