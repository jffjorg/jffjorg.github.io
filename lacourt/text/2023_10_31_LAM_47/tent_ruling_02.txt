STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is a lemon law action filed on September 3, 2020. Plaintiff
purchased a new 2016 Dodge Ram 2500 on January 23, 2016, which was delivered
with serious defects in the transmission and electrical systems as well as the
brakes and the engine. A jury verdict was rendered on May 10, 2023, in favor of
Plaintiff and against Defendant FCA US LLC. Judgment was entered on the verdict
on July 6, 2023. 
 
Plaintiff moves for attorney’s fees
and costs in the amount of $278,941.82 as the prevailing party. 
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Plaintiff’s Motion for Attorney’s
Fees is GRANTED in the amount of $196,713.12 in attorney’s fees.
 
            This
ruling is without prejudice to Plaintiff’s right to seek costs via a
procedurally proper Memorandum of Costs. 
 
 
DISCUSSION:
 
Plaintiff moves for attorney’s fees
and costs in the amount of $278,941.82 as the prevailing party. 
 
Defendant moves to tax costs
claimed in the memorandum of costs. 
 
Defendant’s Evidentiary Objections
 
            Defendant
raises numerous evidentiary objections to the Declaration of Roger Kirnos
offered in support of the motion. The Court rules on these objections as
follows:
 
            Objection
No. 1: OVERRULED. As supervisor and managing partner, the training, skills,
experience, and hourly rates of subordinate attorneys are within the
declarant’s personal knowledge, and these statements do not lack foundation. The
statements are not hearsay and are relevant on their face. 
 
As the remainder of the evidence to
which Defendant objects is not material to the Court’s ruling, the Court
declines to rule on the balance of Defendant’s objections. 
            
Entitlement to Fees
 
            Plaintiff
seeks an award of attorney’s fees, costs, and expenses pursuant to a judgment
entered in Plaintiff’s favor. Plaintiff brought claims for violation of the
Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act (Civ. Code § 1790 et seq.) and for
fraudulent omission. 
 
Civil Code section 1794(d) states:
 
If the buyer prevails in an action
under this section, the buyer shall be allowed by the court to recover as part
of the judgment a sum equal to the aggregate amount of costs and expenses,
including attorney's fees based on actual time expended, determined by the
court to have been reasonably incurred by the buyer in connection with the
commencement and prosecution of such action.
 
            A jury
trial in this action commenced on May 1, 2023, concluding with a verdict in
Plaintiff’s favor on both causes of action asserted in the operative Complaint.
(See Plaintiff’s Exh. D.) Judgment was entered on July 6, 2023, designating
Plaintiff the prevailing party in this action and awarding Plaintiff
$190,198.63 in damages and prejudgment interest in the amount of $25,459.72. (Id.)
Defendant does not dispute that Plaintiff is the prevailing party in this
action and is entitled to reasonable attorney’s fees, costs, and expenses. 
 
//
 
Reasonableness of
Fees
 
            Plaintiff requests a total fee award
of $230,858.25, based on a total of $153,905.50 in fees actually incurred by
Plaintiff’s counsel to date, plus an additional $76,952.75 resulting from a 1.5x
multiplier, plus $3,465.00 in anticipated fees to prepare a reply brief and
attend the hearing on this motion. (Declaration of Roger Kirnos ISO Mot. ¶ 2,
Exh. A.) 
 
            Reasonable attorney’s fees are allowable costs when
authorized by contract, statute, or law. (Code Civ. Proc § 1033.5(a)(10),
(c)(5)(B).) In actions that are based on a contract, “where the contract
specifically provides that attorney’s fees and costs, which are incurred to
enforce that contract, shall be awarded either to one of the parties or to the
prevailing party, then the party who is determined to be the party prevailing
on the contract… shall be entitled to reasonable attorney’s fees in addition to
other costs.” (Civil Code § 1717(a) [emphasis added].) A recovery of attorney’s
fees is authorized even in noncontractual or tort actions if the contractual
provision for fee recovery is worded broadly enough. (See Code Civ. Proc §
10211; Maynard v. BTI Group, Inc. (2013) 216 Cal.App.4th 984, 993
[agreement to award fees based on outcome of “any dispute” encompasses all
claims, “whether in contract, tort or otherwise]; Lockton v. O'Rourke (2010)
184 Cal.App.4th 1051, 1076; Lerner v. Ward (1993) 13 Cal.App.4th 155,
160.) 
Reasonable attorney’s fees shall be fixed by the Court and
shall be an element of the costs of suit. (Code Civ. Proc. § 1033.5(c)(5)(B).)
Reasonable attorney’s fees are ordinarily determined by the Court pursuant to
the “lodestar” method, i.e., the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied
by the reasonable hourly rate. (See PLCM Group, Inc. v. Drexler (2000)
22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095-1096; Margolin v. Regional Planning Com. (1982)
134 Cal.App.3d 999, 1004 [“California courts have consistently held that a computation
of time spent on a case and the reasonable value of that time is fundamental to
a determination of an appropriate attorneys' fee award.”].) “[T]he lodestar is the basic fee for
comparable legal services in the community; it may be adjusted by the court
based on factors including, as relevant herein, (1) the novelty and difficulty
of the questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the
extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded other employment by the
attorneys, (4) the contingent nature of the fee award….”  (Ibid.)
In setting the hourly rate for a fee award, courts are entitled to consider the
“fees customarily charged by that attorney and others in the community for
similar work.” (Bihun v. AT&T Info. Sys., Inc. (1993) 13 Cal.App.4th
976, 997 [affirming rate of $450 per hour], overruled on other grounds by Lakin
v. Watkins Associated Indus. (1993) 6 Cal.4th 644, 664.)  The burden
is on the party seeking attorney’s fees to prove the reasonableness of the
fees. (Center for Biological Diversity v. County of San Bernardino
(2010) 188 Cal.App.4th 603, 615.) 
The Court has
broad discretion in determining the amount of a reasonable attorney’s fee
award, which will not be overturned absent a “manifest abuse of discretion, a
prejudicial error of law, or necessary findings not supported by substantial
evidence.” (Bernardi v. County of Monterey (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th
1379, 1393-1394.)  The Court need not explain its calculation of the
amount of attorney’s fees awarded in detail; identifying the factors considered
in arriving at the amount will suffice. (Ventura v. ABM Indus. Inc.
(2012) 212 Cal.App.4th 258, 274-275.)
1.     
Base
Fee Requests
Plaintiff has
provided an itemized list of the attorney time billed in connection with this
case. (Kirnos Decl. Exh. A.) Plaintiff’s counsel billed a total of 335.6 hours
of attorney time at hourly rates ranging from $200 to $595 per hour. (Id.)
Attorney Kirnos attests to the skills, training, experience, and hourly rates
of the various attorneys that performed work on this case as their supervisor
and Managing Partner of Knight Law Group, LLP, as well as his own skills and
experience, and to the veracity of the time entries. (Kirnos Decl. ¶¶ 30-45.) The
Court also observes that, notwithstanding the length of time spent on this
case, that Plaintiff’s counsel has exercised billing judgment, assigning
research and drafting tasks to associates and junior partners, and reserving
more strategic and editing pursuits to senior partners charging higher rates.
(See generally Exh. A.) 
Although Defendant
identifies numerous entries that it contends are ““duplicative,” or “excessive
time,” “unreasonably inflated,” or are mere “paralegal work,” Defendant offers
no evidence supporting these contentions beyond a conclusory assertion that
they are so. Defendant’s contentions that many of Plaintiff’s documents and
motions are “boilerplate” is similarly unsupported, as Plaintiff’s admission that
his counsel uses templates to perform more efficient work does not render the
filings for which they were used mere “boilerplate.” 
            Based on the foregoing, the Court
concludes that Plaintiff’s fees of $157,370.50 were reasonably incurred and
appropriate for use as the lodestar for Plaintiff’s fee award, including the
hours spent through the filing of the fee motion plus the $3,465 expended on
preparing the reply papers and appearing at the hearing on the motion.   
 
2.      Fee Multiplier
 
            Plaintiff requests that the
lodestar be enhanced by a multiplier of 1.5x, which would result in an
additional award of $76,952.75.  Plaintiff contends that this multiplier is
reasonable considering the contingent nature of this action, Plaintiff’s
counsel’s experience and knowledge, the difficulty of this litigation, and the
favorable result achieved for Plaintiff. Multipliers for successful
representation on a contingency basis have frequently been awarded. (See, e.g.,
Santana v. FCA US LLC (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th 334, 352.)
 
            Defendant argues that the Court
should decline to award a positive multiplier because this case was a
straightforward Song-Beverly Action with no real novelty or difficulty. Defendant’s
contention is belied by the record in this case which reflects three years of
litigation, substantive motion practice, motions in limine, and a jury trial
resulting in a decisive verdict for Plaintiff. In the Court’s view, prosecuting
such a case through motions practice and pursuing a jury trial to a final
verdict shows legal representation that embraces risk despite the contingent
character of receiving fees, such that a multiplier on the fee award is proper.
That said, the Court is persuaded that a 1.5x fee multiplier is somewhat
inflated relative to the procedural history of this litigation and the total
award to Plaintiff. Further, the experience of Plaintiff’s counsel and the
difficulty of the case are already reflected in the lodestar computation based
on the hourse expended and counsel’s hourly rates.  Because the lodestar does not recognize the
risk taken in bringing this contingent matter to trial or the excellent result
achieved, the Court will therefore award a reduced 1.25x multiplier, or $39,342.62,
added onto the fees actually incurred.
 
            The Court therefore concludes that
an award of $196,713.12 is proper in this case. 
 
Costs
 
            Plaintiff also seeks an award of
costs in the amount of $10,291.19. 
 
            A prevailing party on a Song-Beverly
claim may also seek to recover costs reasonably incurred, as well as attorney’s
fees. (Civ. Code § 1794(d).) Once a request for costs is properly challenged,
the burden shifts to the propounding party to demonstrate why such costs are
recoverable and proper. (Whatley-Miller v. Cooper (2013) 212 Cal.App.4th
1103, 1113.) Costs are normally sought by way of a memorandum of costs pursuant
to California Rule of Court 3.1700(a). 
 
            Here, Plaintiff served and filed a
memorandum of costs on August 1, 2023. A motion to tax costs is currently
pending and scheduled for hearing on November 16, 2023. The Court therefore declines
to consider the issue of costs on this motion.
 
CONCLUSION:
 
            Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s Motion for Attorney’s Fees is GRANTED in the amount of $196,713.12in
attorney’s fees.
 
            This
ruling is without prejudice to Plaintiff’s right to seek costs via a
procedurally proper Memorandum of Costs. 
 
            Moving
Party to give notice. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
