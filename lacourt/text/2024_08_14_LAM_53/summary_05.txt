And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to quash trial subpoenas issued to Lear Capital, Inc. and HubSpot, Inc. Cross-defendants Jacob Blalock, Benjamin Novak, and Orion Precious Metals, Inc. moved to quash the subpoenas, arguing that they are overly broad and seek information that is not relevant to the case. The court finds that the motion to quash the subpoena issued to Lear Capital, Inc. is moot because the parties have reached a mutual agreement regarding the scope of the subpoena. However, the court grants the motion to quash the subpoena issued to HubSpot, Inc. because the supporting affidavit does not adequately demonstrate the materiality of the requested documents and the subpoena is unduly burdensome. The court orders that the subpoena issued to HubSpot, Inc. is quashed and that the cross-defendants are not required to produce the requested documents.
