MOVING PARTY:                 Cross-complainant and
cross-defendant Velisa Johnson            
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Cross-defendant EOL Builders
Motion for New Trial Against Cross-Defendant EOL Builders
The court
considered the moving and opposition papers filed in connection with this
motion.  No reply papers were filed.[1]
DISCUSSION
Cross-complainant and cross-defendant Velisa Johnson
(“Cross-Complainant”) moves the court for an order granting a new trial on the
ground that there was insufficient evidence to justify the court’s order
granting the motion for summary judgment filed by cross-defendant EOL Builders
(“Cross-Defendant”) as to Cross-Complainant Velisa Johnson’s Cross-Complaint.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 657, subd. (6); Doe v.
United Air Lines, Inc. (2008) 160 Cal.App.4th 1500, 1504 [“An order
granting summary judgment is properly challenged by a motion for a new
trial”].)  Specifically, Cross-Complainant
contends that there was insufficient evidence to grant summary adjudication in
favor of Cross-Defendant on the third, fourth, and fifth causes of action
alleged in Cross-Complainant Velisa Johnson’s Cross-Complaint, such that the
court’s order granting summary judgment in its favor and against
Cross-Complainant was improper and not supported by sufficient evidence.  (Notice of Intent to File Mot. for New Trial,
p. 2:3-9; Memo., p. 5:1-5 [Cross-Complainant “does not seek a new trial on” the
first and second causes of action].) 
“The authority of a trial court in this state to grant a new trial is
established and circumscribed by statute.”  (Oakland Raiders v.
National Football League (2007) 41 Cal.4th 624, 633.)  “A new trial shall not be granted upon the
ground of insufficiency of the evidence to justify the verdict or other
decision, nor upon the ground of excessive or inadequate damages, unless after
weighing the evidence the court is convinced from the entire record, including
reasonable inferences therefrom, that the court or jury clearly should have
reached a different verdict or decision.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 657.)  “When a
trial court rules on a motion for new trial based upon inadequacy of the
evidence, it is vested with a ‘plenary’ power—and burdened with a correlative
duty—to independently evaluate the evidence.” 
(Ryan v. Crown Castle NG Networks Inc. (2016) 6 Cal.App.5th 775,
784.)  “The trial judge has to be
satisfied that the evidence, as a whole, was sufficient to sustain the verdict;
if he was not, it was not only the proper exercise of a legal discretion, but
his duty, to grant a new trial.”  (Ibid.
[internal quotation marks and citations omitted].) 
First, the court finds that Cross-Complainant’s motion for new trial was
timely filed. 
On June 14, 2023, the court issued an order granting Cross-Defendant’s
motion for summary judgment on Cross-Complainant’s Cross-Complaint.  (June 14, 2023 Order, p. 10:13-14.)  The court entered judgment in favor of
Cross-Defendant and against Cross-Complainant on December 19, 2023.  (Dec. 19, 2023 Judgment, pp. 2:15-22,
2:23-3:4.)  On that date, the court
issued a minute order stating that “[t]he Court has signed and filed Judgment [a]s
[t]o Cross-Defendants EOL Builders, Frank Lavie, & Angus Chamberlain.”  (Dec. 19, 2023 Minute Order, p. 1.)  The December 19, 2023 Certificate of Mailing
states that the court’s December 19, 2023 minute order was served on counsel
for Cross-Complainant.  (Dec. 19, 2023
Cert. of Mailing, p. 1 [listing served party as David Sternfeld].)  Cross-Defendant contends that service of the
December 19, 2023 minute order constituted notice of entry of judgment on
Cross-Complainant, such that Cross-Complainant’s notice of intention for new
trial, filed on June 13, 2024, was untimely filed.  The court disagrees. 
“The party intending to move for a new trial shall file with the clerk
and serve upon each adverse party a notice of his or her intention to move for
a new trial, designating the grounds upon which the motion will be made and
whether the same will be made upon affidavits of the minutes of the court, or
both, either: [¶] (1) After the decision is rendered and before the entry of
judgment[, or] [¶] (2) Within 15 days of the date of mailing notice of entry of
judgment by the clerk of the court pursuant to Section 664.5, or service upon
him or her by any party of written notice of entry of judgment, or within 180
days after the entry of judgment, whichever is earliest; provided, that upon
the filing of the first notice of intention to move for a new trial by a party,
each other party shall have 15 days after the service of that notice upon him
or her to file and serve a notice of intention to move for a new trial.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 659, subd. (a).)  “These time limits are jurisdictional.”  (In re Marriage of Herr (2009) 174
Cal.App.4th 1463, 1468.) 
As set forth above, the court’s December 19, 2023 minute order stated
that the court entered judgment as to, inter alia, Cross-Defendant.[2]  (Dec. 19, 2023 Minute Order, p. 1.)  However, “‘to qualify as a notice of entry of
judgment under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.5, the clerk’s mailed notice
must affirmatively state that it was given “upon order by the court” or “under
section 664.5,” and a certificate of mailing the notice must be executed and
placed in the file.’”  (Simgel Co.,
Inc. v. Jaguar Land Rover North America, LLC (2020) 55 Cal.App.5th 305,
314.)  Because the December 19, 2023
minute order, which the clerk served on counsel for Cross-Complainant, did not
state that (1) it was entered upon order by the court, or (2) it was issued
under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.5, the court finds that the clerk’s
notice of the December 19, 2023 minute order did not constitute notice of entry
of judgment pursuant to section 664.5 and therefore did not begin the 15-day
limit by which Cross-Complainant was required to file the notice of intention
to move for a new trial.  (Ibid.;
Code Civ. Proc., § 659, subd. (a).)  Further,
Cross-Complainant filed the notice of her intention to move for a new trial
within 180 days after the December 19, 2023 entry of judgment.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 659, subd. (a).)  Thus, the court finds that
Cross-Complainant’s motion for a new trial was timely filed and therefore rules
on her motion on the merits. 
Second, the court finds that the order granting Cross-Defendant’s
motion for summary judgment in its favor and against Cross-Complainant was
supported by sufficient evidence to justify the order.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 657, subd. (6).) 
Cross-Complainant contends that the evidence presented by
Cross-Defendant in support of its motion for summary judgment was insufficient
to support the court’s order granting summary adjudication (and, subsequently,
summary judgment) in its favor on her third, fourth, and fifth causes of action
because certain of the Requests for Admission relied on by Cross-Defendant and
the court concerned Cross-Defendant’s breach of contract and the alleged damage
to her property, or were otherwise insufficient to show that the tort causes of
action did not have merit.  (Memo., p.
5:6-25.)  However, not all of the subject
admissions were limited to her claims supporting the cause of action for breach
of contract or for property damage.  For
example, Request for Admission number 14 requested that Cross-Complainant admit
that “[a]ny and all damage claimed by [Cross-Complainant] in this lawsuit was
caused by [Cross-Complainant’s] instruction that [Cross-Defendant] stop all
work on THE PROJECT.”  (Aniel Decl. filed
March 27, 2023, Ex. 3, Request for Admission served on Cross-Complainant on
September 10, 2019, p. 3:27-28.)  Thus,
that admission concerned all of Cross-Complainant’s requests for damages in
this action, including those for emotional distress and other types of damages.  (Memo., p. 6:7-8 [arguing that the requests
did not address damages for delay, loss of use, or emotional distress].) 
Moreover, Cross-Complainant does not dispute that, on August 24, 2020,
the court issued an order (1) granting Cross-Defendant’s motion to deem
requests for admission admitted, and  (2)
ordering that “the truth of the matters specified” in Cross-Defendant’s
Requests for Admission, Set One, served on Cross-Complainant was “deemed
admitted.”  (Aug. 24, 2020 Order, p.
4:16-19.)  Thus, Cross-Complainant does
not meaningfully dispute that she admitted that her conduct caused all the
damages of which she complained in her Cross-Complaint. 
After weighing the evidence and reviewing the record, the court finds
that the evidence is sufficient to justify the court’s order granting summary
judgment because (1) the admissions support the court’s finding that
Cross-Defendant met its burden to show that the third, fourth, and fifth causes
of action had no merit because Cross-Complainant admitted that she was not
damaged by Cross-Defendant’s alleged wrongful conduct and was instead damaged
as a result of her own conduct, and (2) Cross-Complainant did not submit
evidence showing the existence of a triable issue of material fact as to that
element.  (June 14, 2023 Order, pp.
7:20-8:4, 8:22-9:7, 9:14-10:3; Ryan, supra, 6 Cal.App.5th at p
784.)  The court therefore denies
Cross-Complainant’s motion for a new trial.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 657, subd. (6).)  
ORDER
            The court denies cross-complainant
and cross-defendant Velisa Johnson’s motion for new trial against
cross-defendant EOL Builders. 
            The court orders cross-defendant EOL
Builders to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
