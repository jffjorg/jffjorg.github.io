And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge, Robert B. Broadbelt III, has issued a tentative ruling in the case of The Greenspan Company, a/k/a The Greenspan Co. / Adjusters International (Petitioner) vs. Lavkumar Barot, et al. (Respondents). The Petitioner is seeking an order compelling arbitration of a fee dispute with Respondent Lavkumar Barot arising out of a Public Adjuster Contract executed on November 7, 2020.

The Judge finds that the Petitioner has met its burden to prove the existence of an arbitration agreement between it and Respondent Lavkumar Barot, and therefore grants the Petitioner's petition to compel Respondent Lavkumar Barot to arbitrate the fee dispute.

However, the Judge finds that the Petitioner has not met its burden to prove the existence of an arbitration agreement between it and Respondent Ingrid Barot, as the Public Adjuster Contract is not signed by Respondent Ingrid Barot. Therefore, the Judge denies the Petitioner's petition to compel Respondent Ingrid Barot to arbitrate the fee dispute.

The Judge orders the Petitioner and Respondent Lavkumar Barot to submit to binding arbitration the fee dispute arising out of the parties' Public Adjuster Contract and gives notice of this ruling.
