  Case Number:  22AHCV01417    Hearing Date:   August 1, 2024    Dept:  P [TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING DEFENDANT'S MOTION FOR TRIAL CONTINUANCE      I.           INTRODUCTION Procedural  History & Factual Background           This case arises from alleged  uninhabitable housing conditions at 2841 W. Main St., Alhambra, California  91801 (the “Premises”). On December 29, 2022, Plaintiff Martin Tokich  (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendants Andrew M. Dang (“Andrew”),  Melvin M. Dang (“Melvin”) and Northstar Real Estate Group, Inc. (“Northstar”,  together “Defendants”). The initial Complaint alleged the following nine causes  of action as against all Defendants: (1) breach of warranty of habitability  under CCP §1941.1 and (2) CCP §1942.4, (3) breach of warranty of habitability  under CCP §17920.3, (4) negligence – premises liability, (5) nuisance, (6)  intentional infliction of emotional distress, (7) breach of contract, (8)  unfair business practices under B&P Code § 17200 et seq., and (9)  fraudulent concealment. A First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) was filed on July 12,  2023. Defendants filed a Motion for Summary Judgment on June 26, 2024, which is  scheduled to be heard on October 3, 2024. The motion now before the Court is  Defendant’s Motion for an Order Continuing Trial and All Related Dates (the  “Motion”). The Motion was filed on July 8, 2024, and on July 24, 2024  Defendants filed a Notice of Non-Opposition.          II.           DISCUSSION Legal  Standard           California Rules of Court, rule  3.1332, subdivision (c) states that although disfavored, the trial date may be  continued for “good cause,” which includes (without limitation):    (1) The  unavailability of an essential lay or expert witness because of death, illness,  or other excusable circumstances; (2) The  unavailability of a party because of death, illness, or other excusable  circumstances; (3) The  unavailability of trial counsel because of death, illness, or other excusable  circumstances; (4) The  substitution of trial counsel, but only where there is an affirmative showing  that the substitution is required in the interests of justice; (5) The  addition of a new party if:           (A) The new party has not had a  reasonable opportunity to conduct discovery and prepare for trial; or           (B) The other parties have not had a  reasonable opportunity to conduct discovery and prepare for trial in regard to  the new party's involvement in the case; (6) A  party's excused inability to obtain essential testimony, documents, or other  material evidence despite diligent efforts; or (7) A  significant, unanticipated change in the status of the case as a result of  which the case is not ready for trial. (Id.,  Rule 3.1332(c).)¿¿¿              The court may also consider the  following factors: “(1) The proximity of the trial date; (2) Whether there was  any previous continuance, extension of time, or delay of trial due to any  party; (3) The length of the continuance requested; (4) The availability of  alternative means to address the problem that gave rise to the motion or  application for a continuance; (5) The prejudice that parties or witnesses will  suffer as a result of the continuance; (6) If the case is entitled to a  preferential trial setting, the reasons for that status and whether the need  for a continuance outweighs the need to avoid delay; (7) The court's calendar  and the impact of granting a continuance on other pending trials; (8) Whether  trial counsel is engaged in another trial; (9) Whether all parties have  stipulated to a continuance; (10) Whether the interests of justice are best  served by a continuance, by the trial of the matter, or by imposing conditions  on the continuance; and (11) Any other fact or circumstance relevant to the  fair determination of the motion or application.” (Cal. Rules of Court 3.1332(d).)  “Continuances are granted only on an affirmative showing of good cause  requiring a continuance.” (In re Marriage of Falcone &¿Fyke¿(2008)  164 Cal.App.4th 814, 823.)    Analysis           Defendants primary contention is that  the current trial date of October 15, 2024, and the current date for the  hearing on summary judgment of October 3, 2024 violate Code Civ. Proc. §437c(a)(3)  which provides that the motion for summary judgment shall be heard no later  than 30 days before the date of trial. Defendants contend a timely motion for  summary judgment was filed and served on June 26, 2024, more than the 75 days  before the appointed hearing as articulated in Code Civ. Proc. §437c(a)(2).  Defendants request a 90-day continuance to allow for the motion for summary  judgment to be heard.              As noted in Sentry Ins. Co. v. Superior Court  (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 526, 529, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v. Superior Court  (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 918, and Polibrid Coatings, Inc., v. Superior  Court (2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 920, 923, being heard on summary  judgment is a statutory right, and the Court cannot violate such a right. Although  the hearing is just prior to trial, Defendants are entitled to have the motion  heard and any reasonable time that may be needed for additional briefing or  arguments. The seven court days between the hearing for the motion and the  trial are insufficient. As good cause exists, as no opposition has been filed,  as no party will suffer prejudice for a continuance, and as the interests of  justice are best served by a continuance, the instant motion to continue trial  is granted.    III.           CONCLUSION            Defendants' Motion for an Order Continuing  Trial and All Related Dates is GRANTED. At the hearing on the motion, the Court will  select a date at least 90 days from today’s date which will accommodate counsels’  respective calendars.  Defendants to give notice of this ruling.            Dated:  August 1, 2024                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               JARED  D.

INTRODUCTIONProcedural
History & Factual Background          This case arises from alleged
uninhabitable housing conditions at 2841 W. Main St., Alhambra, California
91801 (the “Premises”). On December 29, 2022, Plaintiff Martin Tokich
(“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendants Andrew M. Dang (“Andrew”),
Melvin M. Dang (“Melvin”) and Northstar Real Estate Group, Inc. (“Northstar”,
together “Defendants”). The initial Complaint alleged the following nine causes
of action as against all Defendants: (1) breach of warranty of habitability
under CCP §1941.1 and (2) CCP §1942.4, (3) breach of warranty of habitability
under CCP §17920.3, (4) negligence – premises liability, (5) nuisance, (6)
intentional infliction of emotional distress, (7) breach of contract, (8)
unfair business practices under B&P Code § 17200 et seq., and (9)
fraudulent concealment.           A First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) was
filed on July 12, 2023. Plaintiff filed a Motion for Leave to file a Second
Amended Complaint on May 13, 2024. On July 3, 2024, the Court denied leave to
amend. The motion now before the Court is Plaintiff’s Motion for
Reconsideration of that denial (the “Motion”). Defendants oppose the Motion; no
reply has been filed.          II.         
DISCUSSIONLegal
Standard          “A motion for reconsideration may only
be brought if the party moving for reconsideration can offer ‘new or different
facts, circumstances, or law’ which it could not, with reasonable diligence,
have discovered and produced at the time of the prior motion....A motion for
reconsideration will be denied absent a strong showing of diligence."  (Forrest v. Dept. Of Corps.  (2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 183, 202, disapproved on other grounds by Shalant
v. Girardi (2011) 51 Cal. 4th 1164, 1172. 
See also  Baldwin
v. Home Sav. of Am. (1997) 59 Cal. App. 4th 1192, 1199 (noting that
1992 amendment to CCP §1008 tightened diligence requirements).                    “[M]otions to reconsider
allow the trial court to consider new facts or law relevant to its
order….”  (Morton v. Wagner (2007)
156 Cal. App. 4th 963, 973 (dictum). 
[Emphasis added.] Cf. also Wiz
Tech., Inc. v. Coopers & Lybrand (2003) 106 Cal. App. 4th 1, 17-18  (no relevant basis for reconsideration
shown). Disagreement with a ruling is not a new fact that will support the
granting of a motion for reconsideration. (Gilberd v.  AC Transit (1995) 32 Cal.App.4th 1494,
1500.) Analysis          In their moving papers, Plaintiff correctly
notes that the first-stated reason the Court denied the Motion for Leave to File
the SAC was because in the proposed SAC, Plaintiff did not state whether the 9th
cause of action for fraudulent concealment in the FAC is to be deleted and
replaced with a proposed cause of action for violation of Government Code
§§12921 and 12927 as required by CRC Rule 3.1324(a). Plaintiff brings to the
Court’s attention that the omission of this cause of action for fraudulent
concealment was because of a prior ruling made on September 19, 2023 by the Honorable
Judge Margaret Oldendorf on a demurrer and motion to strike, which sustained
demurrer without leave to amend as to the cause of action for fraudulent
concealment. Therefore, this procedural basis for the Court’s ruling was in
error.  Bringing Judge Oldendorf’s prior
order to this Court’s attention is the type of new fact or circumstance
contemplated by Code of Civil Procedure section 1008(a).          However, the Court also denied the
motion for leave to file the SAC because (1) the motion was untimely and (2)
there was prejudice to the Defendants. (July 3, 2024 Minute Order, pg. 3-4.)
The motion for leave was filed on May 13, 2024, 16 months after the initial
Complaint that initiated the case. Trial was scheduled for October 15, 2024.  In their motion for leave, Plaintiff argued that the
new information that prompted the SAC came to light during an April 10, 2024
deposition of Plaintiff. However, it took more than a month for the motion for
leave to be filed. “The law is well settled that a long-deferred presentation
of the proposed amendment without a showing of excuse for the delay is itself a
significant factor to uphold the trial court's denial of the
amendment.'"]; Estate of Murphy (1978) 82 Cal.App.3d 304, 311,
["Where inexcusable delay and probable prejudice to the opposing party is
indicated, the trial court's exercise of discretion in denying a proposed
amendment should not be disturbed."] Leader v. Health Industries of
America, Inc. (2001) 89 Cal.App.4th 603, 613.)          In opposing the instant Motion to
Reconsider, Defendants argue that (1) Plaintiff presents no new or different
facts and (2) Defendants will suffer prejudice.  Given that Defendants have moved this Court to
continue the trial into 2025, which the Court has tentatively granted, the
Court concludes that this continuance effectively resolves the timeliness issue
and greatly reduces the possibility of prejudice to Defendants.  Defendants
may have to conduct additional discovery and incur additional costs.  However, Plaintiff contends that prejudice can
be mitigated by Plaintiff offering depositions at any time without statutory
notice, agreeing to advance the motion for summary judgment, and agreeing to an
amendment to the motion for summary judgment. The Court finds that these
measures are sufficient and that the granting of Plaintiff’s Motion for Reconsideration
will be contingent upon Plaintiff following through on these offers.  Failure to do so may result in the Court
looking favorably upon a motion to strike the newly added causes of
action.                             III.         
CONCLUSION           Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion for Reconsideration is GRANTED.  Defendants to file their answer within 20
days.  Dated:  August 1, 2024
