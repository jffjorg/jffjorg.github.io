And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English:

This is a breach of warranty action under the Song Beverly Act. The Plaintiff, Delia Ventura, is seeking to compel the deposition of the Defendant's Person Most Qualified (PMQ) and to compel production of documents described in the deposition notices. The Plaintiff is also seeking monetary sanctions in the amount of $3,754.15. The Defendant, FCA US LLC, opposes the motion, arguing that the Plaintiff has not demonstrated good cause to compel the deposition and that the Plaintiff's document demand is beyond the reasonable scope of the case. The Court finds that the parties have agreed to proceed with the deposition of the Defendant's PMQ on August 2, 2024, and therefore denies the Plaintiff's motion to compel deposition. The Court also denies the Plaintiff's request for sanctions.
