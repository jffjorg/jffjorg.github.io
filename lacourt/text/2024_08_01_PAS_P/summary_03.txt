And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies Defendant Kevin Wang's motion to dismiss the complaint. The motion is procedurally improper because it was filed after the answer was filed and without a meet and confer declaration. The judge notes that Defendant Wang is self-represented, but holds him to the same standards as attorneys. The judge concludes that the motion is deficient and cannot be granted, and instead encourages Defendant Wang to file a properly noticed motion for judgment on the pleadings if he wishes to challenge the legal sufficiency of the complaint.
