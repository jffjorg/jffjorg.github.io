 Case Number:  23AHCV02981    Hearing Date:   August 1, 2024    Dept:  P [TENTATIVE]
ORDER DENYING DEFENDANT KEVIN WANG’S MOTION TO DISMISS I.        INTRODUCTION
          This is an action arising from an alleged breach of
contract. On December 26, 2023, Plaintiff E1011 Labs LLC (“Plaintiff”) filed a
complaint against Defendant Kevin Wang (“Wang”), Daniel Hwang, Salvatore Di
Benedetto, Shenzhen Vizi Technology Co., Ltd., and DOES 1 through 50, inclusive,
alleging causes of action for: (1) Breach of Contract—Wang Agreement; (2)
Breach of Contract—Hwang Agreement; (3) Conversion; (4) Violation of
Comprehensive Computer Data Access and Fraud Act; (5) Violation of Bus. &
Prof. Code § 17200; and (6) Intentional Interference with Prospective Economic
Advantage.  
          On March 14, 2024, Defendant Wang filed an answer to the
complaint. 
          On March 26, 2024, this action was reassigned from the
Honorable Margaret L. Oldendorf to the Honorable Jared D. Moses sitting in
Department P at Pasadena Courthouse effective April 2, 2024. 
          On June 4, 2024, Defendant Wang filed the instant Motion to
Dismiss for Lack of Standing with Evidence of Criminal Behavior. Defendant
Wang’s motion is made pursuant to CCP § 430.10.
          On July 18, 2024, Plaintiff filed and served an opposition to
the motion. 
          As of July 29, 2024, no reply brief has been filed. Any
reply brief was required to have been filed and served at least five court days
before the hearing. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005, subd. (b).) 
 
II.      LEGAL
STANDARD       
Code Civ. Proc. § 430.10
allows a defendant to object to a complaint by demurrer on various grounds.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (a)-(f).) “A person against whom a complaint
. . . has been filed may, within 30 days after service of the complaint . . .
demur to the complaint . . . .” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.40, subd. (a).) “Before
filing demurrer . . . the demurring party shall meet and confer in person, by
telephone, or by video conference with the party who filed the pleading that is
subject to the demurrer for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can
be reached that would resolve the objections raised in the demurrer.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a).) 
    III.     ANALYSIS
          Initially, the Court notes that
Defendant Wang did not file a motion to dismiss but, rather, filed a demurrer
to the complaint. Defendant Wang filed his motion under CCP § 430.10; however,
such section of the Code of Civil Procedure does not authorize a motion to
dismiss. In fact, Defendant Wang argues that the complaint does not state a
cause of action. (Motion at pp. 3-4.) Thus, it appears that Defendant Wang
demurs to each cause of action in the complaint. (Id. at pp. 6-10.) 
          “A party objecting to a complaint . .
. may demur and answer at the same time.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.30, subd.
(c).) Here, Defendant Wang filed his answer on March 14, 2024, then filed the
instant motion on June 4, 2024. As such, the instant motion is procedurally
improper. If Defendant Wang wished to demur to the complaint, then Defendant
Wang should have demurred at or before the time his answer was filed. 
          Moreover, the Court notes that there
was no meet and confer before Defendant Wang filed what is, in essence, a
demurrer to the complaint. Defendant Wang did not file a meet and confer
declaration in support of the instant motion. 
          The Court acknowledges that Defendant
Wang is self-represented. However, a self-represented litigant is “held to the
same standards as attorneys.” (Kobayashi v. Superior Court (2009) 175
Cal.App.4th 536, 543.) 
          The instant motion is procedurally
deficient and cannot be granted. Defendant Wang may file and serve a properly
noticed motion for judgment on the pleadings under CCP § 438, if Defendant Wang
wishes to challenge the legal sufficiency of the complaint. The Court cannot
treat the instant motion as a demurrer due to the procedural defects and
procedural posture of this action. Moreover, the Court cannot treat the instant
motion as a motion for judgment on the pleadings as Plaintiff is entitled to
proper notice. (Fenn v. Sherriff (2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 1466, 1481.) 
 
IV.     
CONCLUSION AND ORDER 
 Based on the foregoing, Defendant
Kevin Wang’s Motion to Dismiss is DENIED.
