And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the defendant, Gordon Emerson 41, LLC, and Sunset Residences, LLC, sustaining their demurrer and granting them 20 days to amend their complaint. The judge has also found that the defendant's motion to strike is moot.

The judge has determined that the plaintiffs, Roberto Gonzalez and Pilar Gonzalez, have failed to adequately plead their causes of action. Specifically, the judge has found that the plaintiffs' claims for intentional misrepresentation, constructive fraud, and breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing are insufficiently pled.

The judge has also found that the plaintiffs have failed to allege a fiduciary relationship between themselves and the defendant, as required for a claim of constructive fraud. Additionally, the judge has determined that the plaintiffs have not alleged any violation of a duty arising under tort law, as required for a claim of breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing.

The judge has ordered the defendant to file an amended complaint within 20 days, and has dismissed the plaintiffs' complaint without prejudice.
