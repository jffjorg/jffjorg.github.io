And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Quantgene's motion for leave to file a first amended cross-complaint (FAXC). Quantgene sought to add causes of action for breach of contract, fraud, and unjust enrichment, but the judge found the delay in filing the motion to be unreasonable. The judge noted that Quantgene waited over 16 months after the deadline to amend to file the motion, and that the company had previously withdrawn a motion to further extend deadlines. The judge also cited case law in support of its decision, including Leader v. Health Indus. Of Am., Inc. and A.N. v. Cnty. Of Los Angeles.
