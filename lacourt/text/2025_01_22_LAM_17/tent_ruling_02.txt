 Hearing
  Date:  January 27, 2025



 
 
The Court
awards Plaintiff $10,314.00 in reasonable attorney fees. 
 
On 3/2/2020,
Plaintiff Domingo Loza filed suit against Kia Motors America, Inc. alleging:
(1) breach of express warranty; (2) breach of implied warranty; and (3)
violation of the Song Beverly Act section 1793.2.
 
            On
11/5/24, Plaintiff moved for attorney fees totally $394,613.25.
 
Factual Background
 
On 12/8/18,
Plaintiff purchased a new 2019 Kia Forte from Defendant. After a series of
unsuccessful presentations for repairs under warranty, he filed this lawsuit on
3/22/2020. 
 
On 1/20/2022,
Kia served an Offer to Compromise, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
998, in which it agreed to repurchase Plaintiff’s vehicle for $40,000.00. The
matter did not settle and the case proceeded to jury trial on 8/15/2022.  
 
Sometime
between the §998
and trial, Plaintiff’s vehicle was in a collision and was declared a total
loss.[1]  Plaintiff was paid $18,602.88 by his insurance
company.  At trial, the jury found in
favor of Plaintiff and awarded him $36,414.00 on 8/26/22.  On 11/7/22, Kia filed a motion to offset
Plaintiff’s award by the amount he had already received which this Court
granted on 12/2/22.  The Court signed an
order reducing Plaintiff’s $36,414 by the $18,602.88 he had already received
for a net of $17,811.12 (see, Order signed 1/23/23, wherein the Court
left blank the amounts for costs and fees). 
Plaintiff appealed.
 
Both sides
filed Memorandum of Costs on 2/7/23, and after a CCP §473(b)
misstep by Defendant, the Court finalized costs and awarded Plaintiff $4,333.50
in costs, and awarded Kia $4,550.45 in costs. 
In doing so on 7/10/23, the Court acknowledged the §998
and calculated its limitation on Plaintiff’s recovery of costs.
 
While Plaintiff’s
appeal was pending, the California Supreme Court decided Niedermeier v. FCA
US LLC (2024) 15 Cal.5th 792. 
This prompted the parties to settle for the original jury award of $36,414
and call it even on the costs.  A
settlement agreement was executed in August, 2024. (See, Declaration of
Roger Kirnos, Exhibit F, filed 11/5/24.)
 
            Plaintiff
now moves for $394,613.25 in attorney fees, reflecting a lodestar amount of $263,075.50,
plus a lodestar enhancement of 0.5, in the amount of $131,537.75.
 
Legal Standard 
 
The party
claiming attorneys’ fees must establish entitlement to such fees and the
reasonableness of the fees claimed.  (Civic Western Corporation v. Zila Industries,
Inc. (1977) 66 Cal.App.3d 1, 16.) “Except as attorney’s fees are
specifically provided for by statute, the measure and mode of compensation of
attorneys and counselors at law is left to the agreement, express or implied,
of the parties[.]” (CCP §1021.)
 
“It is well
established that the determination of what constitutes reasonable attorney fees
is committed to the discretion of the trial court, whose decision cannot be
reversed in the absence of an abuse of discretion.”  (Melnyk
v. Robledo (1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 618, 623.) 
In exercising its discretion, the court should
consider a number of factors, including the nature of the litigation, its
difficulty, the amount involved, the skill required in handling the matter, the
attention given, the success or failure, and the resulting judgment. (Id.) 
 
In
determining what constitutes a reasonable compensation for an attorney who has
rendered services in connection with a legal proceeding, the court may and
should consider the nature of the litigation, its difficulty, the amount
involved, the skill required and the skill employed in handling the litigation,
the attention given, the success of the attorneys’ efforts, their learning,
their age, and their experience in the particular type of work demanded the intricacies
and importance of the litigation, the labor and necessity for skilled legal
training and ability in trying the cause, and the time consumed. (Stokus v. Marsh (1990) 217 Cal.App.3d
647, 657.) 
 
In
determining the proper amount of fees to award, courts use the lodestar
method.  The lodestar figure is
calculated by multiplying the total number of reasonable hours expended by the
reasonable hourly rate.  “Fundamental to
its determination … [is] a careful compilation of the time spent and reasonable
hourly compensation of each attorney … in the presentation of the case.”  (Serrano
v. Priest (1977) 20 Cal.3d 25, 48 (Serrano
III).)  A reasonable hourly rate must
reflect the skill and experience of the attorney.  (Id.
at 49.)  “Prevailing parties
are compensated for hours reasonably spent on fee-related issues.  A fee request that appears unreasonably
inflated is a special circumstance permitting the trial court to reduce the
award or deny one altogether.”  (Serrano v. Unruh (1982) 32 Cal.3d 621, 635
(Serrano IV); see also Weber v. Langholz (1995) 39 Cal.App.4th
1578, 1587 (“The trial court could make its own evaluation of the reasonable
worth of the work done in light of the nature of the case, and of the
credibility of counsel’s declaration unsubstantiated by time records and
billing statements.”)
 
Reasonable
attorney fees should be based on an objective standard of reasonableness, i.e.,
the market value of services rendered, not on some notion of cost incurred. (PLCM Group, Inc. v. Drexler (2000) 22
Cal.4th 1084, 1090.)  The value of legal
services performed in a case is a matter in which the trial court has its own
expertise.  (Id. at 1096.)  The trial
court may make its own determination of the value of the services contrary to,
or without the necessity for, expert testimony. 
(Id.)  The trial
court makes its determination after consideration of a number of factors,
including the nature of the litigation, its difficulty, the amount involved,
the skill required in its handling, the skill employed, the attention given,
the success or failure, and other circumstances in the case.  (Id.)

Here,
Defendant requests that Plaintiff’s fees be limited to the $10,314.00 that Plaintiff’s attorneys
had billed as of the date of Kia’s offer to compromise. Given that this figure
was calculated based on the rates claimed in Plaintiff’s motion, the Court
finds Defendant has implicitly conceded to the reasonableness of those rates at
least up until the date of the offer to compromise. As such, the Court does not
adjust the rates claimed for the fees awarded. 
 
Discussion 
 
            Plaintiff
argues that he recovered $54,225.12 under the Settlement Agreement, whereas
Defendant argues that Plaintiff only recovered $36,414 under the Agreement. The
distinction is important as CCP
section 998, subdivision (c)(1) provides:
 
If an offer made by a defendant is not accepted and the
plaintiff fails to obtain a more favorable judgment or award, the plaintiff
shall not recover his or her postoffer costs and shall pay the defendant's
costs from the time of the offer. In addition, in any action or proceeding
other than an eminent domain action, the court or arbitrator, in its
discretion, may require the plaintiff to pay a reasonable sum to cover
postoffer costs of the services of expert witnesses, who are not regular
employees of any party, actually incurred and reasonably necessary in either,
or both, preparation for trial or arbitration, or during trial or arbitration,
of the case by the defendant.
 
On 1/20/2022,
Kia served an Offer to Compromise, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
998, in which it agreed to repurchase Plaintiff’s vehicle for $40,000.00. As such, if Plaintiff recovered less
than the amount offered in the initial §998 offer, Plaintiff is limited to recovering
fees and costs incurred as of the date of Kia’s offer (See, Declaration
of Roger Kirnos, Exhibit D, filed 11/5/24 for Kia’s §998).

 
            Then,
Defendant argues, that on 9/20/2024, the parties settled the case for
$36,414.00 and stipulated to the dismissal of the appeals. (Chinery Decl. Exh.
8 [settlement agreement].) At the same time, the parties agreed that the trial
Court cost awards of $4,550.45 to Kia and $4,333.50 to Plaintiff would offset,
and that neither party would pay the other party the respective amounts the
trial Court awarded, but that Plaintiff could seek his attorney fees and
appellate costs, subject to all applicable defenses. (Id.)  
 
            After
review, Plaintiff’s claim of recovering $54,225.12 ($36,414.00 + 17,811.12) in
the Settlement Agreement it completely unsupported. The amount of the
jury verdict, $36,414, is clearly the only amount being tendered. 
 
More
specifically, as detailed in Defendant’s briefing:
 
After Niedermeier
was decided, Plaintiff’s appellate counsel wrote to Kia’s appellate counsel to
ask: “In light of Niedermeier, it seems silly to go to the trouble of
briefing this appeal. Is there any chance of settlement -- i.e., Kia pays
Plaintiff the $18,602.88 offset, and Plaintiff dismisses the appeal.”
(Sprangers Decl. ¶ 4 & Exh. C.) Thus, from Plaintiff’s initial offer, the
parties understood the settlement to merely reinstate the jury’s verdict,
consistent with Plaintiff’s appellate challenge to this court’s reduction of
the award by the $18,602.88 that Plaintiff received from his insurance company.
 
Kia’s
appellate counsel responded to the offer by communicating Kia’s understanding
that under this proposed settlement, Plaintiff expected Kia to pay (1) the
“$17,811.12 judgment principal” before subtracting the amount of Kia’s costs
award, (2) the amount of Plaintiff’s costs award, and (3) “an additional
$18,602.88 in consideration for Plaintiff’s dismissal of the appeals.” (Id.)
Plaintiff’s counsel replied that this proposal was “acceptable to Plaintiff,”
but suggested having the parties’ respective costs awards cancel each other out
because there was only a “small gap between the two.” (Id.) She added
that “the idea is to make sure that the payment to Plaintiff is kept clear: Kia
pays Plaintiff the total sum of $36,414.” (Id.) Again, Plaintiff’s own
representations show that the settlement was intended to be an all-in payment.
 
Plaintiff’s
counsel then took the lead in reducing the parties’ agreement to writing.
(Sprangers Decl. ¶ 5.) In an email, Kia agreed to certain of Plaintiff’s
redlined revisions (including deleting “release” language from the settlement
agreement) because of “the mutual understanding that this is intended by both
sides to be the complete and final end of it.” (Sprangers Decl. ¶ 6 & Exh.
E.)
 
            (Motion,
5: 16-6:8.) 
 
            Plaintiff argues that he recovered
more than Kia’s $40,000.00 §998 offer because, if he had accepted
that offer, he would have surrendered the vehicle. Instead, because he rejected
the offer, Plaintiff “got to keep possession of his vehicle. Kelly Blue Book
has a value of about $7,000.00.” (Kirnos Decl. ¶ 34.) However, Plaintiff did
not get to keep possession of his vehicle. The insurance documents that
Plaintiff produced in this action make clear that his insurance company paid
him $18,602.88 because he chose not to retain possession of the car. (See,
Exhibit 11 to the Declaration of Jacqueline Bruce Chinery [explaining how his
insurance company calculated the $18,602.88 payment].) Even if Plaintiff had
retained possession of the vehicle, there is no competent evidence or details that
the vehicle was worth $7,000.00, especially one Plaintiff wholly admits was a
lemon.
 
After review,
the Court finds that §998,
subdivision (c)(1) applies. As such, Plaintiff’s recovery is limited to the $10,314.00 that Plaintiff’s
attorneys had billed as of the date of Kia’s offer to compromise. This figure
was calculated based on the submitted invoice attached as Exhibit A to the
Declaration of Roger Kirnos in support of Plaintiff’s motion, which shows that
as of January 20, 2022, Knight Law Group, LLP had billed $10,314.00. 
 
The Court
declines to award a multiplier. The hourly rates set forth above capture the
skill and the contingent nature. Thus, any multiplier would be duplicative of the
calculations set forth above. Furthermore, an analysis of the relevant factors
do not justify an enhancement award. 
 
It is so ordered.
