Intervenors’ motion to expunge lis pendens is DENIED, WITHOUT
PREJUDICE. 
 
On 11/24/2020, Plaintiffs Terry Herrera and Teodora Herrera
(collectively, Plaintiffs) filed suit against Full Circle Real Estate
Solutions, Inc., the Mum Group, Marvin U. Mangabat, and Erik Lederman,
alleging: (1) intentional misrepresentation; (2) concealment; (3) negligent
misrepresentation; (4) conversion; (5) rescission; (6) cancellation of written
instrument; (7) quiet title; (8) violation of Civil Code section 2945, et seq.;
(9) financial elder abuse; and (10) declaratory relief. 
 
            On 12/24/2024, Intervenors Massis
Tarbinian and Houry Kelian (collectively, Intervenors) moved to expunge lis pendens.
 
Discussion

 
            Intervenors move to expunge the lis
pendens recorded by Plaintiffs on the ground that they have failed to establish
the probable validity of a real property claim.
 
            After review, the Court finds
expungement is not appropriate at this time. 
 
A lis pendens must be supported by a claim with probable validity
to affect title. (CCP §§ 405.31, 405.32; Howard S. Wright Constr. Co. v.
Superior Court (2003) 106 Cal.App.4th 314, 318.)
 
This action was filed on November 4, 2019 and a lis pendens was
recorded on December 23, 2019. (RJN Exs. 1, 2.) Intervenors bought the Property
at a nonjudicial foreclosure sale and a Trustee’s Deed Upon Sale naming
Intervenors as owners was recorded on March 9, 2022. (RJN Exs. 3-5.)
Intervenors filed their own quiet title action against Plaintiffs and the other
defendants. (RJN Ex. 6.) Plaintiffs did not amend the operative second amended
complaint to name Intervenors in their quiet title claim. (RJN, Fact No. 1.)
 
Neither the jury instructions nor the special verdict form asked
the jury to make findings of fact regarding title to the Property. (RJN, Ex.
20, pp. 248-249.) The jury returned a special verdict in Plaintiffs’ favor on
their financial elder abuse claim. (RJN Ex. 9, pp. 119-120.) Initially, this
court entered Plaintiffs’ proposed judgment, which purported to quiet title in
favor of Plaintiffs. (RJN Exs. 8,9.)
 
However, Intervenors filed four post-judgment motions, including a
motion for new trial; for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, and to vacate
the judgment. (RJN Exs. 10-18.) This Court granted Intervenors’ motion for new
trial and denied the other motions and the Court amended the judgment to omit
the quiet title in Plaintiffs’ favor or adjudication of claims involving
Intervenors. (RJN, Exs. 20 and 21.) This Court found that the quiet title claim
was not submitted to the jury and that there was no verdict upon which to base
a judgment quieting title. (RJN Ex. 20, pp. 248-250.) This Court ruled that it
lacked the authority to quiet title in Plaintiffs’ favor and that any such
judgment exceeded the Court’s authority. (RJN Ex. 20, pp. 248-249.)
 
A lis pendens must be supported by a claim with probable validity
to affect title. (CCP §§ 405.31, 405.32; Howard S. Wright Constr. Co. v.
Superior Court (2003) 106 Cal.App.4th 314, 318.) Under California law,
trustee’s deeds issued through properly conducted foreclosure sales are
presumed valid, reflecting the integrity and finality of such transactions. (Harbour
Vista, LLC v. HSBC Mortgage Services Inc. (2011) 201 Cal.App.4th 1496, 1502
(trustee’s deeds are entitled to a presumption of regularity and validity).
 
Here, a new trial is pending on issues affecting ownership of the
property. Moreover, while Intervenors note in reply that Plaintiffs’ appeal of
the Court’s new trial motion was dismissed on 1/15/2025, this ignores the fact
that Plaintiffs were initially awarded the property in the underlying judgment.
While the Court set aside this judgment, the Intervenors’ interest in the
property is contingent on the outcome of the new trial which has not yet
occurred. In other words, the Court’s ruling did not quiet title in Defendant’s
favor, but rather set aside the judgment quieting title in Plaintiffs’ favor
given a determination that the quiet title claim was not submitted to the jury
and that there was no verdict upon which to base a judgment quieting title. The
Court then ordered a new trial.   
 
The Court therefore agrees that Plaintiffs would be severely
prejudiced if Intervenors were able to exercise full rights over the property
prior to the new trial being conducted. While Intervenors argue that the new
trial is solely on the issue of restitution, this argument seems to suggest
Intervenors are entitled to ownership of the property and restitution.
There was nothing in the Court’s ruling to suggest this. 
 
“A lis pendens clouds title until the litigation is resolved or the
lis pendens is expunged, and any party acquiring an interest in the property
after the action is filed will be bound by the judgment.” (Slintak v.
Buckeye Ret. Co., L.L.C. (2006) 139 Cal. App. 4th 575, 586–87.) 
            
            Here, litigation is not yet
resolved, and expungement of the lis pendens is premature.  
 
Based on the foregoing, Intervenors’ motion to expunge lis pendens
is denied, without prejudice. 
 
It is so
ordered.
