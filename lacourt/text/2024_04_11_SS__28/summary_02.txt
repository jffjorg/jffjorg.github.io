And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to compel the deposition of the defendant, Ren Yang. The Judge has also denied the plaintiff's request for sanctions. The defendant, Avis, had argued that the plaintiff had not shown that the deposition notice was served on Yang, as Yang lives abroad and is not a party to the action. The Judge found that Avis had no further legal obligation to act on Yang's behalf after accepting service of process on Yang's behalf. The Judge also noted that the plaintiff had not filed a motion to strike Yang's answer, and therefore would not consider the argument that Avis had no contact with Yang and should not have filed Yang's answer.
