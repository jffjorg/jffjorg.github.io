 Case Number:  22STCV24674    Hearing Date:   April 11, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
considered the petitioning papers, the Court rules as follows.  
BACKGROUND 
On
July 29, 2022, Plaintiffs Beatriz Adriana Cortez
Pacheco and Gabino Chavez (“Chavez”) filed this
action against Defendants Super Center Concepts, Inc. dba Superior Grocers (“Defendant”)
and Does 1-100 for general negligence and premises liability. 
On
January 12, 2023, the Court appointed Beatriz Adriana Cortez Pacheco to
act as Chavez’s guardian ad litem. 
On
January 13, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a first amended complaint. 
On
February 6, 2023, Defendant filed an answer. 
On
January 11, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a notice of settlement. 
On
February 5, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a petition for expedited approval of a minor’s
compromise. 
No
trial date is currently scheduled. 
PETITIONER’S REQUEST 
Petitioner
Beatriz Adriana Cortez Pacheco (“Petitioner”) asks the Court to approve the
compromise of Plaintiff Gabino Chavez’s claims. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
“‘[W]ithout
trial court approval of the proposed compromise of the ward’s claim, the
settlement cannot be valid. [Citation.] [¶] Nor is the settlement binding [on
the minor] until it is endorsed by the trial court.’” (Pearson v. Superior
Court (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th 1333, 1338; see Prob. Code, §§ 3500, 3600, et
seq.; Code Civ. Proc., § 372.) 
To
obtain court approval of the settlement of a minor’s claims, the petitioner
must file a complete and “verified petition for approval of the settlement and
must disclose ‘all information that has any bearing upon the reasonableness of
the compromise.’ [Citations.]” (Barnes v. Western Heritage Ins. Co.
(2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 249, 256; see Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.950.) 
DISCUSSION      
A.   Reduction of medical expenses (Section 13a(3)) 
Section
13a(1) of the petition states that Plaintiff’s total medical expenses were $1,145.00.  Section 13a(3) states that, of this total
amount, $355.00 was subject to negotiated, contractual, or statutory
reductions.  It appears that the
reduction amount in Section 13a(3) should be $345.00 based on Attachment 13a,
which states that El Monte Injury Center billed $1,145.00 and the final
negotiated bill amount is $800.00. 
B.   Attorney’s fees 
          The Court has reviewed counsel’s declaration stating that
an attorney fee of $1,000.00 (33.3% of the gross settlement amount) is
reasonable. As the Court explained in its
January 24, 2024 order, California Rules of Court, rule 7.955, “requires a
trial court, in determining reasonable attorney fees, to balance an attorney's
interest in fair compensation with the protection of the interests of a minor
client. Thus, a trial court ‘must give consideration to the terms of any
representation agreement made between the attorney and the representative of
the minor or person with a disability and must evaluate the agreement based on
the facts and circumstances existing at the time the agreement was made.’ ” (Schulz
v. Jeppesen Sanderson, Inc. (2018) 27 Cal.App.5th 1167, 1176-1177 (Schultz), quoting Cal. Rules
of Court, rule 7.955(a)(2).) 
The
Court has considered the factors listed in rule 7.955 and concludes that an
attorney’s fee award of 30 percent is reasonable in this case. (See Schultz, supra, 27 Cal.App.5th at p. 1175 [“Even if there is no benchmark starting point
for attorney fees in cases under California Rules of Court, rule 7.955, a court
may of course reasonably determine that 25 percent is an appropriate percentage
in a given case”].) Therefore, the attorney’s fee award will be $900.00, which
is 30 percent of the gross settlement amount. 
C.   Expenses 
Section
14b of the petition asks that $130.25 in “Litigation/Administrative Expenses” be
reimbursed out of the settlement proceeds. 
As the Court requested in its January 24, 2024 order, Petitioner should
provide information supporting this request. 
The
Court denies the petition without prejudice. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES without prejudice the petition for expedited approval of the
compromise of Plaintiff Gabino Chavez's claims filed by Petitioner Beatriz Adriana
Cortez Pacheco on February 5, 2024. 
Petitioner
is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Petitioner
is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court within
five days.
