  Case Number:  20STCV09650    Hearing Date:   April 11, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
considered the documents submitted in support of a default judgment, the Court
rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On
March 10, 2020, Plaintiff Michelle Lyons (“Plaintiff”)
filed this action against Defendant Baby Geniuses Early
Learning Center (“Defendant”), Doe Employees 1-4, and Does 5-25 for
battery, assault, negligence, negligent hiring, supervision, and retention of
employee, intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligent infliction of
emotional distress, and false imprisonment. 
On
June 8, 2021, Plaintiff filed a proof of service showing service by personal
hand delivery of a statement of damages on Defendant on February 3, 2021. 
On
October 13, 2021, the clerk entered Defendant’s default. 
On
November 29, 2021, the Court dismissed the Doe Employee defendants and Doe
defendants with prejudice at Plaintiff’s request. 
On
June 23, 2022, the Court dismissed the action without prejudice. On October 12,
2022, the Court granted Plaintiff’s motion to vacate the dismissal. 
On
November 7, 2022, the Court again dismissed the action without prejudice. On
March 8, 2023, the Court granted Plaintiff’s motion to vacate the dismissal. 
On
March 29, 2023, Plaintiff filed a statement of damages with the
previously-filed proof of service showing service on Defendant on February 3,
2021. The statement of damages listed (1) $2,500,000.00 for pain, suffering,
and inconvenience, (2) $2,500,000.00 for emotional distress, (3) past medical
expenses “according to proof,” and (4) $5,000,000.00 in punitive damages. 
On
August 11, 2023, Plaintiff filed a revised statement of damages that requested $15,046.48 for past medical expenses (as
well as the amounts listed in the previous statement of damages). A proof of
service was attached showing service of the revised statement of damages on
Defendant’s “Employee/Authorized Person to Accept” on August 4, 2023. 
On
September 15, 2023, the Court vacated Defendant’s October 13, 2021 default
based on Plaintiff's post-default service on Defendant of a revised statement
of damages. 
On
October 13, 2023, the clerk again entered Defendant’s default. 
On March
27, 2024, Plaintiff filed a request for Court judgment to be heard on April 11,
2024. 
PARTY’S REQUEST 
Plaintiff
Michelle Lyons asks the Court to enter a default judgment against Defendant
Baby Geniuses Early Learning Center and award Plaintiff $1,015,046.48
consisting of $1,000,000.00 in general damages, $15,046.48 in special damages,
$0.00 in prejudgment interest, $0.00 in attorney’s fees, and $0.00 in costs. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
A.      Default judgment 
“[With exceptions that do not apply here,] [a] party
seeking a default judgment on declarations must use mandatory Request for Entry
of Default (Application to Enter Default) (form CIV-100) . . . The following
must be included in the documents filed with the clerk: 
“(1)  Except in
unlawful detainer cases, a brief summary of the case identifying the parties
and the nature of plaintiff's claim; 
“(2) 
Declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment
requested; 
“(3)  Interest
computations as necessary; 
“(4)  A
memorandum of costs and disbursements; 
“(5)  A
declaration of nonmilitary status for each defendant against whom judgment is
sought; 
“(6)  A proposed
form of judgment; 
“(7)  A
dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application
for separate judgment against specified parties under Code of Civil Procedure
section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; 
“(8)  Exhibits
as necessary; and 
“(9)  A request
for attorney fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.” 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1800(a).) 
B.       Damages 
 On a request for default judgment, “[w]here a
cause of action is stated in the complaint, plaintiff merely needs to introduce
evidence establishing a prima facie case for damages.”  (L. Edmon & C. Karnow, Cal. Practice
Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶ 5:213.1, p. 5-56, citing Johnson
v. Stanhiser (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 357, 361 [trial court erred in applying
preponderance of the evidence standard].) 
 The relief granted to a plaintiff upon entry
of a defendant's default cannot exceed the amount demanded in the complaint or,
for personal injury cases where damages may not be stated in the complaint, the
amount listed in the statement of damages. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 580, subd. (a),
585, subd. (b).) “The notice requirement of section 580 was designed to insure
fundamental fairness.” (Becker v. S.P.V. Construction Co. (1980) 27
Cal.3d 489, 494.) The statute insures that “defendants in cases which involve a
default judgment have adequate notice of the judgments that may be taken
against them. [Citation.] ‘If a judgment other than that which is demanded is
taken against him, [the defendant] has been deprived of his day in court—a
right to a hearing on the matter adjudicated.’ ’’ (Id. at p. 493.) A
trial court exceeds its jurisdiction if it awards damages in excess of the
amount specified in the complaint or statement of damages. (Id. at p.
494.) 
DISCUSSION 
          Plaintiff has
submitted a completed application with all required information. The Court
finds that Plaintiff has carried her burden of establishing a prima facie case
for damages but that the evidence does not support a general damage award of more than $200,000.00.  Therefore, the Court grants
the petition and awards Plaintiff $215,046.48. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court GRANTS the application of Plaintiff Michelle Lyons for default judgment against Defendant Baby Geniuses Early Learning Center filed on March 27, 2024.  The Court awards Plaintiff Michelle Lyons $215,046.48
in damages. 
Plaintiff
is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
