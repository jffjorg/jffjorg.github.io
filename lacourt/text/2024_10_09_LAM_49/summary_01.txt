```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge rules in favor of the defendants, granting their motion to quash service of summons. The court finds that the plaintiff has not met its burden to establish personal jurisdiction over the defendants. The defendants, Anthony Diprizio and Triple 2 Digital, LLC, argue that they do not have sufficient contacts with California to be subject to the court's jurisdiction. The court agrees, finding that the defendants' contacts with California are limited to a single consulting agreement and a one-time payment, which is not enough to constitute a "substantial connection" to the state. The court also notes that the consulting agreement does not explicitly state that any legal disputes are to be filed and adjudicated in California. As a result, the court grants the motion to quash service of summons and dismisses the case without prejudice.
