And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled to stay the case in its entirety and defer its ruling on the motion to compel arbitration pending a decision by the California Supreme Court in Ford Motor Warranty Cases, S279969. The motion to compel arbitration was brought by defendant Hyundai Motor America, who argued that the plaintiff, Jack Richmond, agreed to arbitrate disputes arising from the purchase of a 2022 Hyundai Santa Cruz with defects and nonconformities. The judge found that the arbitration clause in the Retail Installment Sale Contract (RISC) is valid and enforceable by the nonsignatory defendant. However, the judge is staying the case pending the California Supreme Court's decision on the issue of whether a manufacturer can invoke arbitration under the equitable estoppel theory and/or as a third-party beneficiary.
