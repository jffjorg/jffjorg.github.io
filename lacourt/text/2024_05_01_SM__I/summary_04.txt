Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has decided on several motions brought by the defendants, Apyx, regarding the plaintiff's complaint alleging products liability and other torts. The court has overruled the demurrer, which was filed by the defendants, claiming that the complaint is unclear. The court found that the complaint is detailed and sufficient to define the alleged wrongs committed by the defendants. The court also found that the defendants' argument that the complaint is duplicative of other causes of action is unfounded. The court has ruled that the first cause of action, alleging negligence, is sufficient and will not require re-pleading. The court has also found that the second cause of action, alleging strict liability, is sufficient. The court has also ruled that the third, fifth, and sixth causes of action, alleging corporate negligence, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and fraud, respectively, are also sufficient. The court has allowed the defendants 30 days to answer the complaint.
