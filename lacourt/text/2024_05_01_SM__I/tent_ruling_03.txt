 Case Number:  22SMCV02822    Hearing Date:   May 1, 2024    Dept:  I This is a motion to continue the trial, which is currently
set for July 15, 2024.  There is no
opposition.  The motion is reluctantly
GRANTED.  
 
At the outset, the court notes that continuances are
disfavored and are granted only on a showing of good cause.  (Reales Investment, LLC v. Johnson
(2020) 55 Cal.App.5th 463.)  However,
there is good cause here.  Defendant
states that plaintiff’s deposition was taken on January 18, 2024, which was the
earliest time the deposition could reasonably be taken.  At that deposition, plaintiff (surprisingly,
the court gathers) disputed the accuracy of many of her medical records.  She also said that her discovery responses
were inaccurate, and identified an additional key witness.  Defendant states that more time is needed to
prepare for trial in light of that surprising deposition.  Defendant also states that a medical
examination is needed.  The court
believes that this is a sufficient showing. 
The court will discuss timing with the parties.
