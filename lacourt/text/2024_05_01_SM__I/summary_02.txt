Here is the English summary:

The judge issued a tentative ruling on a motion to quash a deposition subpoena. The court notes that the defendant did not respond to the referee's email and that the referee may have stepped outside the lines in authorizing the subpoena. The court also finds that the defendant did not have online access to the bank records, but that does not mean that the records were not in their possession, custody, or control. The court granted the motion to quash the deposition subpoena, but without prejudice to a motion to re-open discovery. The court also discussed the trial date and noted that the case is already over three years old.
