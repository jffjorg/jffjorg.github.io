And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a petition for a writ of mandate to compel the City of Los Angeles to pay a judgment in this case. The court agrees that the proper mechanism to collect a judgment against the City is through a writ petition, but the current petition is premature and is therefore denied without prejudice. The City's fiscal year runs from July 1 to June 30, and the judgment was entered in November 2023, which means that the City has not yet had a chance to pay the judgment. The court notes that the City has adopted a motion to require the City Attorney to draw a demand from a fund to pay the particular judgment, inclusive of interest.
