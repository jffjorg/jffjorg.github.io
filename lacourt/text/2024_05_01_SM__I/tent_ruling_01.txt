  Case Number:  20STCV34501    Hearing Date:   May 1, 2024    Dept:  I This is a petition for a writ of mandate to compel the City
of Los Angeles to pay the judgment in this case.  There is no opposition. 
 
The court’s initial thought is that this is not quite right
procedurally.  The court agrees that the
proper mechanism to collect a judgment against the City where the City has not
paid is through a writ petition.  The
petition is one of ordinary mandate, and it must be verified.  This one includes a declaration calculating
the numbers, but it is not verified by the petitioner, which is what is
required.  Once the petition has been
filed, a motion will lie to issue the writ on the equivalent of summary judgment
or, if need be, a trial.  (California
Standardbred Sires Stakes Com., Inc.v. California Horse Racing Board (1991)
231 Cal.App.3d 751; Los Angeles Waterkeeper v. State Water Resources Control
Board (2023) 92 Cal.App.5th 230.)  
 
The second, and more important, issue is one of timing.  Government Code section 970.2 states that the
local agency must pay any judgment in the fiscal year in which the judgment is
entered or the next fiscal year.  A writ
is appropriate if the judgment is not paid during that time.  (Joseph v. San Francisco Housing Authority
(2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 78.)  The City’s
fiscal year runs from July 1, to June 30. 
The judgment here (as amended) was entered in November 2023, which is
the current fiscal year.  Accordingly, no
writ will yet lie.  (The court is aware
that the original judgment was last fiscal year, but that is not the operative
one.)  The court also notes that  the City adopted a motion to require the City
Attorney to draw a demand from a fund to pay this particular judgment,
inclusive of interest.  Given that, it
appears that the petition is premature and is therefore DENIED WITHOUT
PREJUDICE to the extent that the funds are not paid according to law.
