And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the defendant's motion to continue the trial from July 15, 2024 to a later date. The defendant requested the continuance after taking the plaintiff's deposition on January 18, 2024, where the plaintiff surprisingly disputed the accuracy of many of her medical records and identified an additional key witness. The defendant also stated that a medical examination is needed to prepare for trial. The court believes that this is a sufficient showing of good cause for the continuance, citing the disfavored nature of continuances and the need to show good cause. The court will discuss the new trial date with the parties.
