And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The court has tentatively ruled that the demurrer filed by the defendant, Jaime D. Hernandez, M.D., is sustained with 45 days leave to amend. The motion to strike filed by the defendant is moot as it seeks to strike allegations regarding punitive damages contained in the 2nd and 3rd causes of action. The court finds that the plaintiff has failed to plead facts sufficient to support a claim for breach of fiduciary duty and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The plaintiff is given the opportunity to try to cure the defects in his 2nd and 3rd causes of action.
