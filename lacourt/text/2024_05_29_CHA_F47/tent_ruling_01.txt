connection with their (Second) Application for Writ of Attachment and Right to

filed on 7/24/23.

 
RULING: The motion is denied.  
 
SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of Plaintiffs Steffanie Stelnick,
Todd Stelnick, and Southern California Real Estate Management, Inc.’s (SCREM) (collectively,
Plaintiffs) claim that Defendants Ryan House and Tamar House (collectively, the
Houses) have breached a Settlement Agreement that ended a prior lawsuit.  Plaintiffs contend that the Houses have repeatedly
breached the Settlement Agreement by engaging in competing activity in
violation of a non-compete clauses in the Settlement Agreement.  The Settlement Agreement provides that the
Houses will owe liquidated damages of $54,000 per violation.   
 
On 2/1/23, Plaintiffs filed this action against the
Houses and Southern California Property Management Company, Inc. (SCPMC) for:
(1) Breach of Contract and (2) Trademark Infringement (15 U.S.C. 1114(1)).  The operative Second Amended Complaint, filed
on 3/24/23, which includes the same two causes of action against the Houses,
also names Team House Real Estate, Inc. (Team House) and Cornerstone Realty
Advisors, Inc. (Cornerstone) (collectively, Defendants) as defendants.  
 
On 2/24/23, the Court denied Steffanie Stelnick’s
application for writ of attachment against the Houses (First Application).  (See 2/24/23 Minute Order).  On 7/24/23, SCREM filed another  application for right to attach order and writ
of attachment against Cornerstone (Second Application) with $2,160,000.00 as
the amount to be secured by the attachment which includes $5,000.00 in estimated
costs and $50,000.00 in estimated allowable attorney fees.  The application sought to attach any property
of Cornerstone.  Alternatively,
Plaintiffs requested a temporary protective order barring the transfer or
encumbrance of the Property.  Although the
memorandum of points and authorities filed in support of the Second Application
indicated that alternatively, SCREM sought a temporary protective order
preventing Cornerstone from transferring, disposing of, encumbering, or
otherwise making available to levy, any of its property, the Second Application
failed to indicate that a temporary protective order was being sought.  (See SCREM’s Ps&As, p.10:1-19;
Second Application, p.1, no.1.c).  
 
On 10/23/23, Defendants’ counsel sent Plaintiffs’ counsel
a draft of the instant motion for sanctions and requested that Plaintiffs
withdraw the Second Application within 21 days. 
(Liu Decl. ¶¶4-5, Ex.A). 
Plaintiffs’ did not withdraw the Second Application within the 21-day
period.  (Liu Decl. ¶5; See also
12/12/23 Minute Order).  Therefore, on
11/16/23, Defendants filed and served the instant motion seeking an order
imposing sanctions on Plaintiffs and their counsel, Marsha Berkowitz, in the
amount of $29,539.00 pursuant to CCP 128.7 in connection with their Second
Application filed on 7/24/23.  
 
Since Plaintiffs did not withdraw the Second Application,
Cornerstone filed an opposition thereto and Plaintiffs filed a reply to the
opposition.  On 12/12/23, the Court
denied the Second Application.
 
On 5/15/24, Plaintiffs filed an opposition to the instant
motion for sanctions and on 5/21/24, Defendants filed a reply to the
opposition.  
 
ANALYSIS
 
Defendants’ Request for Judicial Notice is granted.  
 
CCP 128.7(b) provides: 
 
“By presenting to the court,
whether by signing, filing, submitting, or later advocating, a pleading,
petition, written notice of motion, or other similar paper, an attorney or
unrepresented party is certifying that to the best of the person's knowledge, information,
and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances, all of
the following conditions are met:
(1) It is not being presented
primarily for an improper purpose, such as to harass or to cause unnecessary
delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation.
(2) The claims, defenses, and other
legal contentions therein are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous
argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law or the
establishment of new law.
(3) The allegations and other
factual contentions have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified,
are likely to have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for
further investigation or discovery.
(4) The denials of factual
contentions are warranted on the evidence or, if specifically so identified,
are reasonably based on a lack of information or belief.”
 
Sanctions may be imposed for a violation of CCP 128.7(b),
if certain procedural conditions are met. 
See CCP 128.7(c).  
 
Even if the Court finds Plaintiffs violated CCP 128.7(b),
under CCP 128.7(c), the Court retains the discretion to determine whether a
sanction is warranted and, if so, the type and amount of sanctions
warranted.  See Kojababian
(2009) 174 CA4th 408, 422.  Further, it
has been held that sanctions should be imposed under CCP 128.7 only in “the
rare and exceptional case where the action is clearly frivolous, legally
unreasonable or without legal foundation, or brought for an improper purpose.” Kumar
(2021) 71 CA5th 1110, 1121 citing Operating Engineers Pension Trust (9th
Cir. 1988) 859 F2d 1336, 1344; Peake (2014) 227 CA4th 428, 448 (“Because
our adversary system requires that attorneys and litigants be provided
substantial breathing room to develop and assert factual and legal arguments,
sanctions [under CCP 128.7] should not be routinely or easily awarded even for
a claim that is arguably frivolous” and instead “should be ‘made with
restraint.’”).
 
While Defendants have met the procedural requirements set
forth in CCP 128.7(c)(1) for seeking sanctions against Plaintiffs with regard
to Plaintiffs’ filing of the Second Application, the Court does not find that
the imposition of sanctions is warranted. 

 
Contrary to Defendants’ assertion, the Second Application
was not merely a motion for reconsideration of the First Application since it
sought relief against a different defendant (Cornerstone v. the Houses) and was
based on different evidence (Tamar House’s responses to Requests for Admissions,
documents provided Tamar House during discovery and the declaration of Richard
A. Snyder v. Steffanie Stelnick’s declaration).
 
“[T]he evidentiary burden to escape sanctions under
section 128.7 is light.”  Kumar, supra
at  1126. 
While the Court found that the new evidence offered by Plaintiffs in
support of their Second Application did not support the relief requested, the
Court does not find that Plaintiffs’ filing of the Second Application was frivolous
or objectively unreasonable (i.e., any reasonable attorney would agree that the
Second Application was totally and completely without merit) so as to warrant
the imposition of sanctions.  See Kumar, supra at 1120.
 
Similarly, Defendants
have failed to establish that Plaintiffs filed the Second Application primarily
for an improper purpose.  In denying the
First Application, the Court noted that the declaration of Plaintiff Steffanie
Stelnick was insufficient to support the relief requested.  (See 2/24/23 Minute Order).  In an attempt to cure this defect, albeit
unsuccessfully, Plaintiff submitted additional evidence via the declaration of
Richard A. Snyder, discovery responses and documents obtained through discovery
to support their position.  While these
efforts were not ultimately successful, the Court does not find that they
warrant imposing sanctions on Plaintiffs and/or their counsel.  See Gilman (2021) 61 CA5th 923,
942-943.   
Finally, even if the Court found that sanctions against
Plaintiffs were warranted for their filing and proceeding with the Second
Application, the amount of sanctions sought by Defendants is excessive.  As shown by the invoices attached to the Liu
declaration submitted in support of the motion, Defendants have requested fees
for blocks of billing which include tasks unrelated to the instant motion
and/or opposing the Second Application (i.e., 8/30/23 entry includes time for
“attention to strategy,” 9/4/23 and 9/5/23 entries include time for “attention
to outstanding discovery,” 9/12/23 and 9/13/23 entries includes time relating
to a potential motion for judgment on the pleadings, 9/20/23 entry includes
time regarding extended deadline to respond to Special Interrogatories, etc.). (Liu
Decl. ¶6, Ex.B).  As such, the Court
cannot determine the amount of time reasonably spent by the two attorneys and
one paralegal in relation to the instant motion and underlying Second
Application.
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion is denied.
