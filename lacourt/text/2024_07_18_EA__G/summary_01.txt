**Case Number:** 22PSCV01193
**Hearing Date:** July 18, 2024
**Dept:** G
**Defendant:** County of Los Angeles
**Defendant's Motion:** For Summary Judgment or Adjudication of Issues
**Respondent:** Plaintiff Delores

**Tentative Ruling:** The County's motion for summary judgment or adjudication of issues is DENIED in part as to the first and ninth causes of action and GRANTED in part as to the second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, tenth, and twelfth causes of action.

**Background:** This is an action for employment discrimination and harassment. The Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS) hired Plaintiff Delores in 1985 and promoted her to a children's social worker in 1990. From 2020 to 2022, Plaintiff alleges DCFS supervisors harassed and discriminated against her based on age, disability, and race. Plaintiff filed a complaint against DCFS, the County, and Does 1-50, alleging various causes of action.

**Legal Standard:** A motion for summary judgment or adjudication provides courts with a mechanism to cut through the parties' pleadings and determine whether trial is necessary to resolve the dispute. The court must grant the motion if all the evidence submitted and all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

**Analysis:** The court has reviewed the parties' submissions and finds that the County's motion is GRANTED as to the second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, tenth, and twelfth causes of action and DENIED as to the first and ninth causes of action.

**Racial Harassment:** The court finds that Plaintiff has established a triable issue as to the first cause of action for racial harassment based on the allegations of race-based harassment by DCFS supervisors.

**Age-Based Harassment:** The court finds that Plaintiff has failed to establish a triable issue as to the second cause of action for age-based harassment.

**Physical Disability-Based Harassment:** The court finds that Plaintiff has failed to establish a triable issue as to the third cause of action for physical disability-based harassment.

**Discrimination:** The court finds that Plaintiff has failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination as to the fourth, fifth, and sixth causes of action.

**Failure to Accommodate:** The court finds that Plaintiff has failed to establish a triable issue as to the seventh and eighth causes of action for failure to engage in the interactive process and failure to make reasonable accommodations.

**Failure to Prevent Harassment and Discrimination:** The court finds that the County's motion is DENIED as to the ninth cause of action for failure to prevent harassment and discrimination.

**Retaliation:** The court finds that Plaintiff has established a prima facie case of retaliation in violation of FEHA and that the County has failed to establish legitimate and non-retaliatory reasons for the adverse employment actions taken against Plaintiff.

**Intentions:** The County intends to introduce evidence at the hearing to establish that the alleged acts of harassment and discrimination were not motivated by discriminatory intent.

**Facts:** The parties have submitted various facts in support of their positions, including allegations of race-based harassment, age-based harassment, physical disability-based harassment, discrimination, and retaliation.
