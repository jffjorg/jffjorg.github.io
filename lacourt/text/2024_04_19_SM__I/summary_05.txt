And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to re-open discovery and a trial readiness conference. The plaintiff is seeking to re-open discovery to enforce the court's prior order, which required the defendant to disclose information about product providers. However, the court is inclined to deny the motion because the information requested is outside the complaint. The court is also considering a request to substitute Michael Reinstein as the defendant. The court is setting deadlines for filing trial briefs and setting a trial date. The court is also addressing the timing of the trial and the need for the parties to resolve disputes.
