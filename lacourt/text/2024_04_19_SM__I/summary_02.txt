And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the motions to compel and has ordered the defendant to provide verified, code-compliant responses within 3 court days. The defendant must also provide documents at the same time. If the defendant believes they have already provided the required responses, they may stand on their recently-filed responses. However, if a further motion to compel is granted, the court will view the failure as a violation of the order.

The court has also ordered the defendant to pay sanctions in the amount of $10.00 per motion plus the filing fee within 30 days. The court reminds the parties that the trial of this case is in just over a month and expects full compliance with its FSC and trial orders. Failure to comply will result in further sanctions. The court will not grant trial continuances unless it is otherwise engaged in a trial.
