 Case Number:  22SMCV00114    Hearing Date:   April 19, 2024    Dept:  I The motions to compel are GRANTED.  Sanctions against defendant are GRANTED in
the amount of $10.00 per motion plus the filing fee.  They are payable within 30 days.
 
Essentially, the same reasoning applies to this order as to
the April 12, 2024 order.  Defendant is
to provide verified, code-compliant responses without objection other than
privilege (and if privilege is asserted, then a log will accompany the
response) within 3 court days.  Documents
are due at the same time.  If defendant
believes that has already been done, defendant may stand on the recently-filed
responses.  But if a motion to compel
further is granted, the court will view the failure as a violation of the
instant order.
 
The court reminds the parties that the trial of this case is
in just over a month.  If the case
survives the motion for summary judgment, the court expects full compliance
with its FSC and trial orders.  Failure
to do so will result in sanctions.  There
will be no trial continuances unless the court is otherwise engaged in a trial
(in which case this case will likely trail that case).
