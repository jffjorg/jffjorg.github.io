And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the defendant's motions to compel responses to discovery and deem certain documents admitted, unless responses were served prior to the hearing. The defendant has served discovery on November 6, 2023, but no responses were received from the plaintiff. The judge finds no cause for the plaintiff's failure to respond and has granted the defendant's motion for sanctions. The plaintiff is legally obligated to respond to discovery in a timely manner and has 30 days to do so. The defendant is entitled to $860 in fees and $1040 in sanctions. The judge reminds the plaintiff that if she wants to pursue the case, she must respond to discovery. Failure to do so may result in dismissal of the action.
