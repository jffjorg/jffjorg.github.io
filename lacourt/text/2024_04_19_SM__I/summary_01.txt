And here is the summary text:

"The court is setting forth its thoughts from yesterday's hearing for the parties' benefit. The court held a 402 hearing with expert witness Jon Albert, who testified on two methodologies for calculating damages to which plaintiff believes he is entitled. Albert described his work as a broker for celebrity endorsements, with a focus on recognizable celebrities or talent. However, the court notes that plaintiff, Jaeschke, does not have celebrity status and is instead a model. The court is troubled by the lack of specificity in Albert's methodology and requests that plaintiff articulate exactly what the methodology is to which Albert will opine. The court also finds Albert to be candid in his testimony, but notes that credibility and candor are for the jury, not the court."
