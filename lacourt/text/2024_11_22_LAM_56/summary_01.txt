And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Plaintiff Tohid Naeem's motion for an order to show cause re contempt against Defendant Nidal A. Barakat. The motion was filed after the parties entered into a settlement agreement, but Defendant failed to comply with the terms of the agreement. The judge found that the Court lacks jurisdiction to hear the motion because Plaintiff did not personally serve Defendant with the contempt papers. Additionally, the judge ruled that the stipulated settlement is not a court order, and therefore, the proper recourse for Plaintiff would be to enforce the settlement agreement pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6.
