DISCUSSION
Pursuant to Insurance Code section
10139.5, subdivision (a), the Court must make the following express findings as
to a transfer of structured settlement payment rights: 
(1)  The transfer is in the best
interest of the payee, taking  into account the welfare and support
of the payee's dependents. 
(2)  The payee has been advised in
writing by the transferee to  seek independent professional advice
regarding the transfer and has either received that advice or knowingly
waived that  advice in writing.  
(3)  The transferee has complied with
the notification requirements pursuant to paragraph (2) of subdivision (f), the
transferee has provided the payee with a disclosure form that complies
with Section 10136, and the transfer agreement complies with sections 10136 and
10138. 
(4)  The transfer does not contravene
any applicable statute or the order of any court or other government
authority.  
(5)  The payee reasonably understands
the terms of the transfer agreement, including the terms set forth in the
disclosure statement required by Section 10136.
(6)  The payee reasonably understands
and does not wish to exercise the payee's right to cancel the transfer
agreement. 
(Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (a).) 
 
 
When determining
whether the proposed transfer should be approved, including whether the
transfer is fair, reasonable, and in the payee’s best interest, taking into
account the welfare and support of the payee’s dependents, the court shall
consider the totality of the circumstances, including, but not limited
to: 
 
(1)  the reasonable
preference and desire of the payee to complete the proposed transaction, taking
into account the payee’s age, mental capacity, legal knowledge, and apparent
maturity level;  
(2)  the stated purpose
of the transfer;  
(3)  the payee’s
financial and economic situation;  
(4)  the terms of the
transaction, including whether the payee is transferring monthly or lump sum
payments or all or a portion of his or her future payments;  
(5)  whether the future
periodic payments were intended to pay for future medical care of the payee
related to the incident that was the subject of the settlement;  
(6)  whether the payee
has other means of income or support sufficient to meet the payee’s future
financial obligations for support of payee’s dependents, such as child
support;  
(7)  whether there were
previous transactions involving payee’s structured settlement payments;
and  
(8)  whether the payee
and his or her dependents are facing a hardship situation.
(Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (b).) 
 
 
Any petition to transfer payments from a structured
settlement must be supported by specific documentation and information as set
forth in Insurance Code section 10139.5, subdivision (c). “Every petition for approval of
a transfer of structured settlement payment rights, except as provided in
subdivision (d), shall include, to the extent known after the transferee has
made reasonable inquiry with the payee, all of the following: 
(1)  The payee's name, address, and age. 
(2)  The payee's marital status, and, if married or
separated, the name of the payee's spouse. 
(3)  The names, ages, and place or places of residence
of the payee's minor children or other dependents, if any.
(4)  The amounts and sources of the payee's monthly
income and financial resources and, if presently married, the amounts and
sources of the monthly income and financial resources of the payee's spouse. 
(5)  Whether the payee is currently obligated under any
child support or spousal support order, and, if so, the names, addresses, and
telephone numbers of any individual, entity, or agency that is receiving child
or spousal support from the payee under that order or that has jurisdiction
over the order or the payments in question.
(6)  Information regarding previous transfers or
attempted transfers.” 
(Ins. Code. §10139.5, subd. (c).)
 
If the petitioner fails to attach the information
required under Insurance Code section 10139.5, subdivision (c)(2)-(6), the
petitioner may submit the information at the hearing on the petition. If the
information is admitted into the record in accordance with the rules of
evidence, the requirement under Insurance Code section 10139.5, subdivision (c)
is satisfied. (Ins. Code. §10139.5, subd. (d).)
 
Here,
Payee is 27 years old and lives in Los Angeles
County. (Declaration of Payee, ¶ 8.) Payee is not married and has two minor
children, O.B., who is three, and P.B., who is two. (Id., ¶ 8.) Both
minor children live with Payee. (Id..) Payee does not have child support
obligations but apparently also does not receive child support from the other
parent(s) of the children. (Id.) Payee is currently unemployed, and he
does not receive payments from SSI. (Id.)
 
            The original structured settlement
was entered into by Payee, by and through his Guardian ad Litem, Valencia
Brandon, on or around January 21, 1999. (Id., ¶ 4.) The settlement was
intended as compensation for a wrongful death claim. (Id.) Payee
declares that when the original settlement was completed, the future period
payment(s) that are the subject of the proposed transfer were not intended to
pay for the future medical care and treatment relating to the incident that was
subject of the settlement. (Id., ¶ 6.) Further, when the original
settlement was completed, the future periodic payments that are the subject of
the proposed transfer were solely monetary in nature and were not intended to
provide for necessary living expenses. (Id., ¶ 7.)
 
Payee has agreed to sell a portion of his interest
in the structured settlement to Transferee as follows: 22
monthly payments of $1,442.38, commencing on 03/13/2025 through and including
12/13/2026 and 27 monthly payments of $1,442.38 commencing 11/13/2028 through
and including 01/13/2031. (Id., ¶
5; Ex. “A.”) If approved, Payee will receive $48,000 from the transaction. (Id.)
 
Payee believes it is in his best interest to enter
into the transaction. (Id., ¶ 4.) Payee is currently experiencing
financial hardship, and he intends to use the money from the proposed
settlement to relocate. (Id., ¶ 11.) Payee is looking to put a down
payment on a home (ranging from $180,000 to $2000,000) where he, his fiancé,
and his two kids can live together. (Id.)  This does not appear to the Court to be a
reasonable use of these funds. A down payment requires that monthly payments be
made on a mortgage, and Payee has no income other than the structured
settlement funds with which to support himself, his children and, apparently,
his fiancée. 
 
Payee
has completed a previous transaction on 09/01/2016, through the Los Angeles
County Court (Case # MS012329), transferring annual payments of $20,000.00
beginning on 03/13/2018 through and including 03/13/2019, and monthly payments
of $1,442.38 beginning 03/13/2020 through and including 08/13/2021 to J.G.
Wentworth Originations, LLC. From the settlement, Payee received $48,000.00. (Id.,
¶ 9.) Payee has also completed a previous transaction on 09/28/2017, through
the Los Angeles County Court (Case # MS013266), transferring monthly payments
of $1,442.38 beginning 01/13/2027 through and including 10/13/2028 to J.G.
Wentworth Originations, LLC. From the settlement, Payee received $12,000.00. (Id.)
 
Payee
has not attempted previous transactions involving his structured settlement
payment that were denied, dismissed or withdrawn prior to a decision on the
merits, within the past five years. (Id., ¶ 10.)
 
Payee did not receive independent legal or
financial advice regarding the proposed transaction. (Id., ¶ 12; Ex.
“E.”) Payee declares he understands the terms of the transfer agreement,
including the terms set forth in the disclosure statement, and he does not wish
to exercise his right to cancel the agreement. (Id., ¶ 13.)

CONCLUSION

The Amended Petition fails to provide the Payee’s
address as well as the “place or places of residence of the payee's minor
children or other dependents, if any” as required by Insurance Code §10139.5, subdivision (c)(1) and (3).
Payee provides that he lives in Los Angele County and that his two minor
children live with him. (Payee
Decl., ¶ 8.) According to Proof of Service, Payee’s address will be
provided at hearing. At the hearing, the Court expects to discuss the intended
use of these funds and whether this is a reasonable transaction under the
circumstances.
 
Payee should also clarify “[t]he amounts and
sources of the payee's monthly income and financial resources and, if presently
married, the amounts and sources of the monthly income and financial resources
of the payee's spouse” as required by Insurance Code §10139.5, subdivision
(c)(4). Payee states that he is currently unemployed, and he does not receive
payments from SSI. (Payee Decl., ¶ 8.) Payee also states that he intends to use
the money from the proposed settlement to relocate by putting a down payment on
a home (ranging from $180,000 to $2000,000) where he, his fiancé, and his two
children can “grow together.” (Payee Decl., ¶ 11.) While the money from
the proposed settlement may allow Payee to put a down payment on a home, it is
unclear how Payee will cover other expenses. 
 
If the information is admitted into the record in
accordance with the rules of evidence and is found satisfactory by the Court,
the requirement under Insurance Code section 10139.5, subdivision (c) would be
satisfied. (Ins. Code. §10139.5, subd. (d).)
 
The Court will grant the motion provided that the missing
information is provided at hearing and the Court is satisfied with the
information. Otherwise, the motion will be continued to allow Petitioner to
submit an amended petition with the missing information or any additional facts
that would render this transaction reasonable to the Court.  
 
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at
SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed by the instructions provided on the court
website at www.lacourt.org.  If the
department does not receive an email and there are no appearances at the
hearing, the motion will be placed off calendar.
