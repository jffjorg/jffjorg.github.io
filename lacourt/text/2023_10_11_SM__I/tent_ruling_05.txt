 Case Number:  23SMCV03774    Hearing Date:   October 11, 2023    Dept:  I The problem is that the court is going dark as of this
Friday until 11/1/23, and that is a huge day. 
The court can advance the hearing to that date on the theory that such
is also the FSC date, but it cannot do anything sooner.  That is just not possible.
The
court reminds the parties of its FSC rules, which apply in full to UD
cases.  The court expects
compliance.  If one party is attempting
to comply and the other is not, the Local Rules suggest that the sanction is
that the uncooperative party will be precluded from putting on witnesses or
introducing exhibits.
