Summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on two motions: defendants' motion for terminating sanctions and plaintiffs' motion to compel production of documents. The court finds that defendants' motion is not granted, but orders Hakim to provide supplemental verified responses to all past written discovery. The court also orders Umansky to produce a declaration consistent with the court's orders and to produce any additional documents. The judge criticizes both parties' counsel for making misleading representations to the court and warns them to comply with discovery orders in the future.
