 Case Number:  20SMCV00596    Hearing Date:   October 11, 2023    Dept:  I The court will discuss VERY BRIEFLY the situation.  Right now, it appears that Virk is seeking to
accelerate the time for defendant to respond to the subpoena.  The court notes that Virk seems to be seeking
all email delivery/receipt confirmations for all email communications by
defense counsel to him or his father. 
The court has some familiarity with this case, and that could be a huge
undertaking.  But if it were more
limited—say 3 months prior to the MSA hearing—and if that is not overly
burdensome, the court would talk about it. 
Virk claims that defense counsel has committed perjury by falsifying the
delivery receipts of documents served electronically.  That is heady stuff, and if it is true, it
has consequences (among other things, the court would have to vacate its order,
but there are obvious ethical concerns as well).  However, the court will not assume such ill
conduct without proof.  The court has not
seen any indication that counsel would do something like that and the court
does not believe counsel would do so. 
Virk suggests that perhaps things were served but they went into the
“spam” folder.  That could be the
case.  If it is, it would clear up the
question of service.  Therefore, if the
burden is not huge, the court would be inclined to have some production.  That is primarily because if there is a “spam”
problem, at a minimum plaintiff needs to address that problem going forward and
so plaintiff would need to know.  The
court notes that it told the parties to seek confirmation that documents were
received so that if the confirmation was not given, the serving party would
know there was an issue.  That was not
done, apparently, by defense counsel. 
Because of that, the court is inclined to require some reasonable
response.
