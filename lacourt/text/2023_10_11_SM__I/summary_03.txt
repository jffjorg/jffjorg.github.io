And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has reviewed the motion by Ramirez to quash certain subpoenas served by InterSolutions. The judge finds that the motion is properly before the court and will be resolved on its merits. The subpoenas sought payroll information and medical records from various entities, which Ramirez claims are irrelevant to the case. However, InterSolutions points out that Ramirez is seeking lost wages, which makes the discovery relevant. The judge agrees that the subpoenas are proper as to wages, but is unsure about the medical records and will ask about that at the hearing.

Regarding service, the judge is concerned that InterSolutions did not serve Ramirez electronically, despite his request. The judge believes that service was technically proper, but not adequate, and is inclined to grant the motion due to this conduct. The judge notes that the procedural faults by all parties in this case have led to unnecessary complications and delays.

The judge also denied Ramirez's ex parte application for an injunction to bar InterSolutions from evicting him absent legitimate process. The judge finds that Ramirez was evicted in December 2021 and an injunction will not cure or change that. Ramirez's remedy, if any, lies in damages.
