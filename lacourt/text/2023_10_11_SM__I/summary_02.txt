And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to accelerate the deadline for the defendant to respond to a subpoena. The plaintiff, Virk, is seeking all email delivery/receipt confirmations for all email communications between defense counsel and Virk or his father. The court notes that this could be a significant undertaking, but if it is limited to a 3-month period prior to the MSA hearing and is not overly burdensome, the court may consider it.

Virk claims that defense counsel committed perjury by falsifying delivery receipts of electronically served documents. However, the court will not assume wrongdoing without proof. Virk suggests that documents may have been served but went into the "spam" folder, which could clear up the question of service. The court is inclined to require some reasonable response from the defendant to address this issue, as the plaintiff needs to know if there is a "spam" problem with document delivery.
