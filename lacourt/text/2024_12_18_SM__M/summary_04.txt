And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to amend the complaint to add new claims and allegations. The plaintiff, Benjamin Mullis, is seeking to add claims for restitution, malicious prosecution, and quantum meruit, as well as new causes of action against the defendants. The judge has found that the plaintiff has not been delayed in bringing the claims and that there is no prejudice stemming from any insubstantial delay. The court's decision is based on the rules governing leave to amend a pleading, which favor liberally granting leave to amend so that all disputed matters between the parties may be resolved. The judge has also considered the facts presented by the plaintiff, including allegations of wrongful acts by the defendants, and has found that the proposed amendments are based on the same general set of facts as the original complaint.
