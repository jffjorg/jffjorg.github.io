et al.
CASE NO.:                24SMCV02307
MOTION:                  Motion
for Leave to Amend to File a First Amended Complaint
HEARING DATE:   12/18/2024
 
Legal
Standard
 
If a party
wishes to amend a pleading after an answer has been filed, or after a demurrer
has been filed and after the hearing on the demurrer, or if he or if the
pleadings has already been amended as a matter of course, the party must obtain
permission from the court before amendment. (CCP §§ 473(a)(1), 576.) 
 
Motions
for leave to amend the pleadings are directed to the sound discretion of the
court. “The court may, in furtherance of justice, and on any terms as may be
proper, allow a party to amend any pleading . . ..” (CCP § 473(a)(1); see CCP §
576.) Policy favors liberally granting leave to amend so that all disputed
matters between the parties may be resolved. (See Howard v. County of San Diego (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 1422,
1428.) Absent prejudice to the adverse party, the court may permit amendments
to the complaint “at any stage of the proceedings, up to and including trial.”
(Atkinson v. Elk Corp.
(2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 739, 761 [internal quotes omitted].) Where leave is
sought to add entirely new claims, the court may grant leave to amend if the
new claims are based on the same general set of facts, and the amendment will
not prejudice the opposing party. (Austin
v. Massachusetts Bonding & Ins. Co. (1961) 56 Cal.2d 596, 600-602; Glaser v. Meyers (1982) 137 Cal.App.3d 770, 777 [holding
trial court did not abuse its discretion in permitting amendment of complaint,
which originally alleged constructive eviction, to allege retaliatory eviction
where the new claim was based on the same general set of facts].)
 
Although
denial is rarely justified, a judge has discretion to deny leave to amend if
the party seeking the amendment has been dilatory, and the delay has prejudiced
the opposing party. (Morgan v. Superior
Court (1959) 172 Cal.App.2d 527, 530; Hirsa v. Superior Court
(1981) 118 Cal.App.3d 486, 490). An opposing party is prejudiced where the
amendment would necessitate a trial delay along with a loss of critical
evidence, added preparation expense, increased burden of discovery, etc. (Magpali
v. Farmers Group, Inc. (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 471, 486-488 [leave properly
denied where plaintiff sought leave on the eve of trial, nearly two years after
the complaint was originally filed and gave no explanation for the delay which
prejudiced defendant who did not discover or depose many of the witnesses who would
support the new allegations and had not marshaled evidence in opposition of the
new allegations].)
 
Procedurally,
a motion for leave to amend must state with particularity what allegations are
to be amended. Namely, it must state what allegations in the previous pleading
are proposed to be deleted and/or added, if any, and where, by page, paragraph,
and line number. (CRC, Rule 3.1324(a)(2)-(3).) The motion must be accompanied
by a declaration specifying: (1) the effect of the amendment; (2) why the
amendment is necessary and proper; (3) when the facts giving rise to the
amended allegations were discovered; and (4) the reasons why the request for
amendment was not made earlier. (CRC, Rule 3.1324(b).) The motion must also be
accompanied by the proposed amended pleading, numbered to differentiate it from
the prior pleadings or amendments. (CRC, Rule 3.1324(a)(1).) It is within the
court’s discretion to require compliance with Rule 3.1324 before granting leave
to amend. (Hataishi v. First American Home Buyers Protection Corp. (2014)
223 Cal.App.4th 1454, 1469.)
 
Analysis
 
Plaintiff Benjamin Mullis moves for
leave to file a proposed First Amended Complaint (FAC). Plaintiff substantially
complies with the rules concerning leave to amend. Plaintiff provides a
proposed copy of the pleading. (Ex. 1.) Plaintiff explains that the purpose of
the proposed amendments is to clarify certain allegations, add claims for
restitution previously omitted, add claims based on subsequent, wrongful
actions committed by the landlord, and add causes of action for malicious
prosecution.
 
Plaintiff claims that providing a
deletion and addition by page and paragraph would be impractical given the
nature of the changes. In general, the changes include allegations of: a)
additional wrongful acts on the part of the Landlord designed to interrupt and
prevent Plaintiff’s right to occupy and use the leased premises; b) the actual
removal of the septic tank on June 23, 2024, from the premises, cutting off all
sewage service; c) the forcible ejectment of Plaintiff from the premises due to
a continuing pattern of bad faith actions on the part of the Defendant
Landlord; d) the dismissal on October 9, 2024, of the frivolous unlawful
detainer (“UD”) action; e) a claim for attorney’s fees and damages by Plaintiff
against both the Defendant Landlord and its attorneys based on malicious
prosecution; f) forceful ejection of Plaintiff from the leased premises by the
Defendant Landlord due to the progressively wrongful actions on the part of the
Defendant Landlord; g) the dismissal the City of Malibu as a party Defendant;
and h) a cause of action for quantum meruit for the substantial labor and
services performed by Plaintiff to renovate the tennis court and otherwise
prepare the leased premises for his occupancy. Plaintiff also seeks to remove the
City of Malibu as a defendant and the ninth cause of action against the City,
add attorneys Gary D. Fidler and Fred M Szkolnik as Defendants, and claim three
new causes of action for malicious prosecution and quantum meruit.
 
Counsel provides that following the
filing of the UD action, Defendants forced Plaintiff to abandon the premises. On
August 20, 2024, Ebudo arrived at the property with the Sheriff and changed the
locks to prevent Mullis from accessing the property. (Sutz Decl., ¶ 17.)
Further, on October 9, 2024, the landlord put a padlock on the tennis court and
removed the net. (Id.) The landlord also removed Mullis’ personal property from
the premises, placed it on the driveway, and urinated on it. (Id.) On October
13, 2024, the landlord cut off the net posts to the tennis court and destroyed
the security cameras Mulllis purchased and installed on the property. (Id.)
 
Counsel became aware of the facts
giving rise to the additional claims when they occurred on August 20, 2024, and
September 23, 2024. (Sutz Decl., ¶ 19.) Plaintiff’s claims against the landlord
and his attorney became viable when they filed a voluntary dismissal of the UD on
October 9, 2024. As such, the court observes no delay in bringing these claims.
Moreover, there is no prejudice stemming from any insubstantial delay. 
 
Accordingly, the motion is GRANTED.
