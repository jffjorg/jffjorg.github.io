And here is the summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the motion for judgment on the pleadings filed by defendant Todd Krauss against plaintiff James Hunter's first amended complaint (FAC). The defendant argues that the legal malpractice cause of action is not well-pled because there was no malpractice committed in fact, and the plaintiff relies on false information.

The court finds that the FAC provides sufficient facts to state a claim for malpractice. The FAC alleges that the parties were in an attorney-client relationship, and that Krauss breached his duties to Hunter by over-billing, conspiring with opposing counsel, threatening to terminate representation, refusing to keep Hunter informed, misleading Hunter about the settlement agreement, refusing to sign the substitution of attorney form, dismissing Hunter's case, and providing attorney-client privileged information to opposing counsel.

The defendant's arguments that there is no damage from the underlying case and that the plaintiff lacks evidence of damages are based on extrinsic evidence and go beyond the four corners of the complaint or judicially noticeable documents. The court finds that the plaintiff's allegations of damages are sufficient to state a claim for legal malpractice.

The motion is denied, and the case will proceed to the scheduled hearing date.
