DEMURRER WITH MOTION TO STRIKE

Los Angeles Superior
Court Case No. 23CHCV03446

 
Motion
filed: 11/12/24
 
MOVING PARTY: Defendant Michael R. Rhames 
RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff Cyrus Jazaeri
NOTICE: OK.
 
RELIEF
REQUESTED: An
order sustaining Defendant’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s Second Amended Complaint,
and striking portions of the Second Amended Complaint.
 
TENTATIVE
RULING: The demurrer
is SUSTAINED IN PART. The motion to strike is GRANTED IN PART.
 
BACKGROUND
 
This action arises from allegations of legal malpractice.
 
On November 9, 2023,
Plaintiff Cyrus Jazaeri (“Plaintiff” or “Jazaeri”) initiated this action.
Subsequently, on May 9, 2024, Plaintiff filed the First Amended Complaint
(“FAC”), rendering moot Defendant’s prior demurrer filed by Defendant on
January 8, 2024.
 
On September 11, 2024, the Court sustained Defendant’s second
demurrer to the FAC and granted Defendant’s motion to strike, providing
Plaintiff 30 days leave to amend the second, third, and fourth causes of action
and the corresponding prayer for relief.
 
On October 10, 2024, Plaintiff filed the operative Second
Amended Complaint (“SAC”) against Defendant and Does 1 to 25, alleging the
following causes of action: (1) Professional Negligence, (2) Breach
of Contract, (3) Breach of Fiduciary Duty, and (4) Fraud and Deceit. 
 
On November 12, 2024, Defendant filed the instant Demurrer
with Motion to Strike the SAC. On December 11, 2024, Defendant filed a Notice
of Non-Opposition to Defendant’s Demurrer and Motion to Strike. Plaintiff subsequently
filed untimely Oppositions to the Demurrer and Motion to Strike on December 12
and 16, 2024, respectively.
 
On December 16, 2024, Defendant filed an Objection and
Reply to Plaintiff’s Untimely Opposition.
 
ANALYSIS
 
A demurrer can be
used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the pleading under
attack; or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311,
318.) No other extrinsic evidence can be considered.
 
A demurrer for
sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th
740, 747 (Hahn).) When considering demurrers, courts read the
allegations liberally and in context. (Taylor
v. City of Los Angeles Dep’t of Water & Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th
1216, 1228.) In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face
of the pleading or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)
 
“A demurrer tests
the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters. Therefore,
it lies only where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are
judicially noticed.” (SKF Farms v.
Superior Ct. (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 902, 905.) “The only issue involved in a
demurrer hearing is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with
extraneous matters, states a cause of action.” (Hahn, supra, 147
Cal.App.4th at 747.) 
 
A.   
Meet and
Confer Requirement
 
A party filing a demurrer “shall meet and confer in
person or by telephone with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to
demurrer for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached
that would resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a).) A failure to meet and confer does not constitute
grounds to sustain or overrule a demurrer. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41,
subd. (a)(4).)
 
            Here, Defendant’s counsel, Nina
Niedbalski (“Niedbalski”), attests that on October 17, 2024, she sent a meet
and confer letter to Plaintiff detailing the grounds for the instant Demurrer
(Niedbalski Decl. ¶ 2.) However, Plaintiff did not respond to the letter. (Ibid.)
Subsequently, on October 31, 2024, Niedbalski requested via email for a time to
meet and confer via telephone. No responses were received. (Id. Decl. ¶
3.)
 
            Based on the above declaration, the
Court finds that the requirement for an in-person or telephonic meet and
confer, under Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41(a), has not been met.
Nevertheless, the Court will proceed to review the Demurrer and Motion to
Strike on the merits. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a)(4).) 
 
B.    
Untimely
Oppositions and Consequent Untimely Reply
 
The Oppositions are
untimely. A hearing date of December 18, 2024, sets the filing deadline for
Opposition papers as December 5, 2024, and Reply papers as December 11, 2024.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1005, subdivision (b), Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1300.) However,
the Opposition to the Demurrer was not filed until December 12, 2024 – one day after
the Reply deadline. (Ibid.) The Opposition to the Motion to Strike was
not filed until December 16, 2024 – five days after the Reply deadline. (Ibid.)
Given the late filing of the Oppositions, the Court has discretion to not
consider the merits of the Oppositions. (Bozzi v. Nordstrom, Inc. (2010)
186 Cal.App.4th 755, 765.)
 
Plaintiff establishes
neither diligence nor good cause for the late filing of his Oppositions.
Moreover, Plaintiff’s Oppositions contains allegations rather than substantive
legal analysis or argument. Consequently, the Court finds no justification in
this case to depart from the general rule requiring timely submission of appropriate
materials in compliance with the Code of Civil Procedure and the California
Rules of Court.
 
Therefore, the Court will proceed
to examine the Demurrer and Motion to Strike without considering the late-filed
Opposition or the consequently untimely Reply papers.
 
C.   
Entire
Second Amended Complaint
 
Defendant contends that the
Court should sustain the Demurrer as to Plaintiff’s entire SAC, arguing that
its causes of action are uncertain, ambiguous, and intelligible. (Dem. at p.
3.) Defendant further asserts that the SAC contains several procedural defects,
including failure to comply with the California Rules of Court regarding page
margins, spacing, line numbers, page numbers, and exhibit references. (Id.
at pp. 9-10.)
 
A special demurrer to a complaint is
appropriate when the grounds of the pleading are uncertain, ambiguous, or
unintelligible.¿(Code Civ. Proc. § 430.10(f) and¿Beresford Neighborhood
Assn. v. City of San Mateo¿(1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 1180, 1191.) 
 
Courts typically disfavor demurrers based
on uncertainty, which the court strictly construes even when the pleading is
uncertain in some respects.¿(Khoury v.¿Maly’s¿of California, Inc.¿(1993)
14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.)¿A demurrer for uncertainty may be sustained when a
defendant cannot reasonably determine to what he or she is required to
respond.¿For example, when a plaintiff joins multiple causes of action as one,
fails to properly identify each cause of action, or fails to assert which party
each cause of action applies to when there are multiple defendants, a complaint
is uncertain.¿(Williams v. Beechnut Nutrition Corp.¿(1986) 185
Cal.App.3d 135, 139, fn. 2. (Williams)) 
 
The Court observes that the SAC suffers from certain technical defects,
such as failure to comply with formatting requirements under the California
Rules of Court. Nevertheless, the Court does not find that these defects render
the SAC so uncertain as to deprive Defendant of ability to reasonably determine
what is being alleged and required to respond. 
 
Accordingly, in alignment with established legal principles, including
those outlined in Williams, supra, 185 Cal.App.3d at p. 139 fn.
2, the Court finds these defects do not constitute sufficient grounds to
sustain the Demurrer.
 
D.   
Second Cause
of Action – Breach of Contract
 
“To prevail on a cause of action for breach of contract, the
plaintiff must prove (1) the contract, (2) the plaintiff's performance of the
contract or excuse for nonperformance, (3) the defendant's breach, and (4) the
resulting damage to the plaintiff. (Richman v. Hartley (2014) 224
Cal.App.4th 1182, 1186.) “A written contract may be pleaded either by its terms
– set out verbatim in the complaint or a copy of the contract attached to the
complaint and incorporated therein by reference – or by its legal effect. [Citations.]
In order to plead a contract by its legal effect, plaintiff must ‘allege the
substance of its relevant terms. This is more difficult, for it
requires
a careful analysis of the instrument, comprehensiveness in statement, and
avoidance of legal conclusions.’ [Citation.]” (McKell v. Washington Mutual,
Inc. (2006) 142 Cal.App.4th 1457, 1489.)
 
“[A] statement that is quantifiable, that makes a claim as to the
‘specific or absolute characteristics of a product,’ may be an actionable
statement of fact while a general, subjective claim about a product is
non-actionable puffery.
[Citation.]” (Newcal
Industries, Inc. v. Ikon Office Solution (9th Cir.2008) 513 F.3d 1038, 1053 (Newcal).)
“[T]the determination of whether an alleged misrepresentation ‘is a
statement of fact’ or is instead ‘mere puffery’ is a legal question.” (Ibid.)
 
            Here, Defendant contends that the SAC
fails to allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action for breach of
contract, arguing that it attaches 144 pages of unlabeled documents instead of
the actual contract. Additionally, Defendant argues that Plaintiff has not
pleaded Defendant’s breach, Plaintiff’s performance or excuses for
nonperformance, and resulting damages. (Dem. at p. 11.)
 
            The initial burden lies with the
pleader to sufficiently state a cause of action. In the SAC, Plaintiff alleges that
on or about December 15, 2021, he signed an Attorney Client Retainer Agreement
(Medical Malpractice Contingency Fee) (“Agreement”) with Defendant. (SAC ¶ 6.) The
Agreement purportedly states that Defendant would represent Plaintiff in a
medical malpractice action against Dr. Sergie Terterov, M.D., a Southern
California Permanente Medical Group staff member, and against Kaiser Foundation
Health Plan, Inc., Kaiser Foundation Hospitals and Southern California
Permanente Medical Group for negligence medical care. (Ibid.)      Plaintiff further alleges that Defendant
agreed to “strive to provide the highest quality legal representation.” (SAC ¶
16.) “Defendant breached the Agreement by failing to provide Plaintiff with
‘the highest quality legal representation[.]” (Id. ¶ 17.)
 
The Court finds that these allegations sufficiently plead
the element as to the existence of a contract. Included in the attachment, one
document – albeit without proper exhibit labeling – is titled “Attorney-Client
Retainer Agreement Medical Malpractice Contingency Fee.” As previously
discussed, formatting or technical defects are insufficient to form a basis to
sustain the Demurrer. Consequently, the Court also finds that the contract
terms are stated with sufficient specificity. 
 
However, the Court finds that Plaintiff has failed to allege
Defendant’s breach of a specific term of the Agreement. Plaintiff’s allegation
regarding this element solely relies on the representation that “[Defendant
will] strive to provide the highest quality legal representation,” which is
vague, highly subjective, and typically seen as aspirational goals. Such language
does not constitute a specific contractual obligation but is instead considered
“mere puffery” and not an actionable statement of fact as a matter of law (Newcal,
supra, 513 F.3d at p. 1053.)
 
 Accordingly, the
Court SUSTAINS the Demurrer as to the Second Cause of Action.
 
E.    
Third Cause of Action – Breach of Fiduciary Duty
 
The elements of a cause of action
for breach
of fiduciary
duty
are (1) the existence of a fiduciary relationship, (2) breach of fiduciary duty, and (3) damages. [Citation.]” (Oasis West Realty, LLC v. Goldman (2011) 51 Cal.4th
811.) A fiduciary
duty is founded upon a special relationship imposed by law or under
circumstances in which “confidence is reposed by persons in the integrity of
others” who voluntarily accept the confidence. (Tri-Growth Centre City, Ltd.
v. Silldorf, Burdman, Duignan & Eisenberg (1989) 216 Cal.App.3d 1139,
1150; see CACI 4100, et seq.)
 
            Here, the SAC alleges the existence
of an Agreement, thereby establishing a fiduciary relationship existed between
the parties by virtue of the attorney-client relationship. (see Charnay v.
Cobert (2006) 145 Cal.App.4th 170, 182.)
 
            Additionally, the SAC alleges that “Defendant
failed to act competently and fairly ... and thereby breached his fiduciary
duty to Plaintiff. . . . [D]efendant conspired with attorneys for KAISER to
sell out [P]laintiff’s case for a meager sum and having worked for KAISER is
supportive of that premise.” (SAC ¶ 21.) “The breach of fiduciary duty ... came
about due to defendant’s conflicting interest having previously worked for
KAISER and thereafter taking a case against KAISER.” (Id. ¶ 23.)
 
However, Plaintiff’s SAC does not address the deficiency identified
in the First Amended Complaint (“FAC”). Specifically, the SAC still lacks any specific
facts explaining how Defendant’s previous work for KAISER created a conflict in
the underlying medical malpractice action, or how that conflict impacted the Defendant’s
representation of Plaintiff. Without these supporting factual allegations,
paragraphs 21 and 23 of the SAC – unchanged from the FAC – constitute mere conclusions
of fact or law, which the Court does not admit when reviewing a demurrer. (See South
Shore Land Co. v. Peterson (1964) 266 Cal.App.2d 725, 732.)
 
            Accordingly, the Court finds that
the SAC has failed to sufficiently state all required elements of the Breach of
Fiduciary Duty claim. 
 
            Therefore, the Court SUSTAINS the
Demurrer as to the Third Cause of Action.
 
F.    
Fourth Cause
of Action – Fraud and Deceit
 
A claim for fraud must plead all of the following elements:
(1) misrepresentation; (2)¿knowledge of falsity; (3) intent to induce reliance;
(4) justifiable reliance; and (5) resulting damage. (Odorizzi v. Bloomfield
School Dist. (1966) 246 Cal.App.2d 123, 128; Wilhelm v. Pray, Price, Williams
& Russell (1986) 186 Cal.App.3d 1324, 1332.) Fraud actions are subject to
strict requirements of particularity in pleading. (Committee on Children’s
Television, Inc. v. General Foods Corp. (1983) 35 Cal.3d 197, 216.)
Particularity requires facts that show how, when, where, to whom, and by what
means the representations were tendered. (Lazar v. Superior Court (1996)
12¿Cal.4th 631, 645 (Lazar).)
 
Here, the factual allegations under the SAC’s Fourth Cause
of Action for Fraud and Deceit remain unchanged from the FAC. 
 
The Court finds that the SAC fails to sufficiently plead the
elements of Defendant’s knowledge of falsity and intent to induce reliance. The
SAC merely claims that “Defendant was fully aware of the false representations
he made to plaintiff and did so knowingly and maliciously so as to obtain a
quick settlement to acquire attorney’s fees without having to do the necessary
work to properly present the case.” (SAC ¶ 26.) The Court finds this allegation
to be conclusory and insufficient to meet the heightened pleading standards for
fraud claims
 
            Therefore, the Court SUSTAINS the
Demurrer as to the Fourth Cause of Action.
            
G.   
Leave to
Amend
 
If the demurrer is sustained, plaintiff
must prove the possibility of cure by amendment.¿(Czajkowski¿v. Haskell
& White, LLP¿(2012) 208 Cal.App.4th 166, 173 (citing¿Grinzi¿v. San
Diego Hospice Corp.¿(2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 72, 78-79.)
 
This is Plaintiff’s third opportunity to
plead sufficient factual allegations in support of the causes of action
discussed above. Despite being granted the opportunity to amend, Plaintiff has restated
most allegations from the previous version unchanged. Additionally, Plaintiff
has failed to address how further amendment could cure the identified
deficiency, thereby failing to meet the burden of proving a reasonable
possibility of cure.
 
Based on the foregoing, Defendant’s
Demurrer to Plaintiff’s SAC is SUSTAINED WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND as to the
Second, Third, and Fourth Causes of Action.
 
Any pending motions for leave to amend are
deemed MOOT and are hereby taken off calendar.
 
H.   
Motion to
Strike
 
The court may, upon a motion, or at any
time in its discretion, and upon terms it deems proper, strike any irrelevant,
false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading. (Code Civ. Proc., § 436,
subd. (a).) The court may also strike all or any part of any pleading not drawn
or filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order
of the court. (Code Civ. Proc., § 436, subd. (b).) The grounds for a motion to
strike are that the pleading has irrelevant, false, or improper matter, or has not
been drawn or filed in conformity with laws. (Code Civ. Proc., § 436.) The
grounds for moving to strike must appear on the face of the pleading or by way
of judicial notice. (Code Civ. Proc., § 437.)
 
In its Motion to Strike, Defendant seeks
to strike the following portions from FAC:
 
(1)   Pages
8 -151.
 
(2)  
Paragraph 27: “Defendant’s action were
malicious, oppressive and unlawful and justify an award of punitive damages to
be determined at the trial of this action.”
 
(3)  
Item 3 of Prayer:
“Third cause of action (Breach of Fiduciary Duty): Special damages as proved;
Compensatory damages as proved; Punitive damages as proved;” and
 
(4)  
Item 4 of Prayer:
“Fourth Cause of Action (Fraud and Deceit): Special damages as proved;
Compensatory damages as proved; Punitive Damages as proved.”
 
(1)  
Pages 8 – 151
 
Pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 436, “The court may, upon a motion made
pursuant to Section 435, or at any time in its discretion, and upon terms it
deems proper: (a) Strike out any irrelevant, false, or improper matter
inserted in any pleading. (b) Strike out all or any part of any pleading
not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or
an order of the court.”
 
Defendant contends that pages 8 through 151 of the SAC,
which appear as unlabeled “exhibits,” are improper and irrelevant.
 
The Court recognizes pages 8 -11 as a document titled
“Attorney-Client Retainer Agreement Medical Malpractice Contingency Fee.” While
this document is not labeled as “Exhibit 1” as referenced in paragraph 6 of the
SAC, the Court finds it to be relevant. 
 
However, the Court finds that the remaining unlabeled pages,
namely pages 12-151, are unintelligible and fail to demonstrate any clear relevance
to the SAC. As such, they are properly subject to the Motion to Strike as
irrelevant and improper matter.
 
Accordingly, the Court GRANTS IN PART the Motion and orders
that pages 12-151 attached to the SAC be stricken.
 
(2)  
Paragraphs Related to Punitive Damages
 
Punitive damages may be imposed where it
is proven by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant has been guilty
of oppression, fraud, or malice. (Civ. Code, § 3294, subd. (a).) “Malice” is
conduct intended by the defendant to cause injury to the plaintiff or
despicable conduct which is carried on with a willful and conscious disregard
of the rights or safety of others. (Civ. Code, § 3294, subd. (c)(1).)
“‘Punitive damages are proper only when the tortious conduct rises to levels of
extreme indifference to the plaintiff’s rights, a level which decent citizens
should not have to tolerate.’ [Citation.]” (Lackner v. North (2006) 135
Cal.App.4th 1188, 1210.)
 
“As amended to include [despicable], the
[Civil Code section 3294] plainly indicates that absent an intent to injure the
plaintiff, ‘malice’ requires more than a ‘willful and conscious’ disregard of
the plaintiffs’ interests. The additional component of ‘despicable conduct’
must be found.” (College Hospital Inc. v. Superior Court (1994) 8
Cal.4th 704, 725.) The statute’s reference to despicable conduct represents a
“new substantive limitation on punitive damage awards.” (Ibid.)
Despicable conduct is “conduct which is so vile, base, contemptible, miserable,
wretched or loathsome that it would be looked down upon and despised by
ordinary decent people. Such conduct has been described as ‘having the
character of outrage frequently associated with crime.’” (Tomaselli v.
Transamerica Ins. Co. (1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 1269, 1287.) Further, “[t]here
must be evidence that defendant acted with knowledge of the probable dangerous
consequences to plaintiff’s interests and deliberately failed to avoid these
consequences.” (Flyer’s Body Shop Profit Sharing Plan v. Ticor Title Ins.
Co. (1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 1149, 1155.)
 
A motion to strike punitive damages is
properly granted where a plaintiff does not state a prima facie claim for
punitive damages, including allegations that defendant is guilty of oppression,
fraud or malice. (Turman v. Turning Point of Cent. California, Inc.
(2010) 191 Cal.App.4th 53, 63.) “Mere negligence, even gross negligence, is not
sufficient to justify such an award” for punitive damages. (Kendall Yacht
Corp. v. United California Bank (1975) 50 Cal.App.3d 949, 958.)
 
Here, as with the FAC, malice is
alleged in two conclusory paragraphs. (SAC ¶¶ 26-27.) The pleadings lack any
factual allegations to support a finding of malice, oppression, or fraud.
 
Furthermore, given that the
Court has previously sustained the Demurrer as to the Second, Third, and Fourth
Causes of Action in the SAC, it concludes that remedies as to punitive damages
are unavailable in the absence of valid underlying causes of action. 
 
Based on the above, the Court
GRANTS WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND the Motion to Strike as to paragraph 27 of the
SAC, and items 3 and 4 in the prayer for relief. 
 
CONCLUSION
 
Defendant
Michael R. Rhames’s Demurrer to the Second
Amended Complaint is SUSTAINED IN PART. The Court SUSTAINS WITHOUT LEAVE TO
AMEND the Demurrer as to the Second, Third, and Fourth Causes of Action in the
Second Amended Complaint. 
 
The Court further orders that any pending motions for leave
to amend are TAKEN OFF CALENDAR AS MOOT.
 
Defendant
Michael R. Rhames’s Motion to Strike is GRANTED IN
PART. The Court orders that paragraph 27 of the Second Amended Complaint, items
3 and 4 of the prayer for relief, and pages 12-151 of the attachment be
stricken in their entirety.
