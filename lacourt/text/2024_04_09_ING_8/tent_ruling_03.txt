II.             
Legal Standard & Discussion  
 
Code of Civil Procedure § 284 states that
“the attorney in an action…may be changed at any time before or after judgment
or final determination, as follows: (1) upon the consent of both client and
attorney…; (2) upon the order of the court, upon the application of either
client or attorney, after notice from one to the other.”  (Code Civ. Proc.
§ 284; CRC 3.1362.)  The withdrawal request may be denied if it would
cause an injustice or undue delay in proceeding; but the court's discretion in
this area is one to be exercised reasonably.  (See Mandell v. Superior
(1977) 67 Cal.App.3d 1, 4; Lempert¿v. Superior Court (2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 1161, 1173.) 
 
In making a motion to be relieved as
counsel, the attorney must comply with procedures set forth in Cal. Rules of
Court 3.1362.  The motion must be made using mandatory forms: Notice of
Motion and Motion to be Relieved as Counsel directed to the client – Civil
(MC-051); Declaration “stating in general terms and without compromising the
confidentiality of the attorney-client relationship” reasons the motion was
brought (MC-052); and a Proposed Order (MC-053).  (Ibid.)  The
forms must be filed and served on all parties who have appeared in the
case.  (Ibid.) Here, counsel for
Plaintiffs failed to comply with Rule 3.1362 by failing to include the MC-052
form. As such, this motion is DENIED. 
 
III.           
Conclusion & Order 
 
For the foregoing reasons, Manuel E.
Gonzalez’s, Motion to Be Relieved As Counsel is DENIED, without prejudice to it
being re-filed with the proper supporting documentation.
 
Moving party is ordered to
give notice.
