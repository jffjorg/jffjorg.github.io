I. BACKGROUND¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿ 
A. Factual¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿ 
On March 16, 2023, Plaintiffs, Christina Maier,
Tierney Mauge, and Traci Maier (collectively “Plaintiffs”) filed a Complaint
against Defendant, Kate Dunitz, and DOES 1 through 10. On August 29, 2024,
Plaintiffs filed a First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) alleging causes of action
for: (1) Conversion; (2) Defamation (Slander); and (3) Intentional Infliction
of Emotional Distress. 
 
On December 4, 2023, Plaintiff, Christina Maier
propounded Form Interrogatories, Set Three and Requests for Admission on
Defendant. Responses by Defendant were due on or before January 5, 2024. However,
on January 14, 2024, Plaintiff notes that Defense Counsel emailed objections
with no responses to each of the discovery requests. Plaintiff note that on
February 1, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel sent a meet and confer letter, but that
despite this, there has been no response or any attempt to resolve the matter.
As such, Plaintiff filed this Motion to Compel Further Responses to Form
Interrogatories, Set Three, and Deem Requests for Admission as Admitted. 
 
B. Procedural¿¿¿ 
¿¿ 
On March 1, 2024, Plaintiff Christina
Maier filed these motions to compel Defendant’s further responses. On March 27,
2024, Defendant filed opposition briefs. On April 2, 2024, Plaintiff Christina
Maier filed reply briefs. 
 
¿II.
ANALYSIS¿¿ 
¿¿ 
A.    Legal Standard 
 
A party must respond to
interrogatories within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260,
subd. (a).) If a party to whom interrogatories are directed does not provide
timely responses, the requesting party may move for an order compelling responses
to the discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (b).) The party also
waives the right to make any objections, including one based on privilege or
work-product protection. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).) There is no
time limit for a motion to compel responses to interrogatories other than the
cut-off on hearing discovery motions 15 days before trial. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2024.020, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., 2030.290.) No meet and confer efforts are
required before filing a motion to compel responses to the discovery. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2030.290; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific
Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.
            Lastly,
Code of
Civil Procedure section 2033.290, subdivision (a), provides that “[o]n receipt
of a particular response to requests for admissions, the party requesting
admissions may move for an order compelling a further response if that party
deems that either or both of the following apply: (1) An answer to a particular
request is evasive or incomplete[;] (2) An objection to a particular request is
without merit or too general.”  
 
Additionally, “Unless otherwise
limited by order of the court in accordance with this title, any party may
obtain discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the
subject matter involved in the pending action or to the determination of any
motion made in that action, if the matter either is itself admissible in
evidence or appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of
admissible evidence.” (Code of Civ. Proc. § 2017.010.) For discovery purposes,
information is regarded as relevant “if it might reasonably assist a party in
evaluating the case, preparing for trial, or facilitating settlement thereof.”
(City of Los Angeles v. Superior Court (2017) 9 Cal.App.5th 272,
288.)  
 
B.    Discussion 
 
The motions assert that Defendant failed to timely
file responses to Plaintiff’s propounded discovery, and the Reply argues that compliance
with the Separate Statement requirement of California Rule of Court 3.1345 is irrelevant
when the responding party has failed to provide a complying verified
response.  The Court will allow oral argument
as to the factual issue of whether verified tardy or supplemental responses
have been provided or not.  If so, the motions to compel and motion to deem
RFAs admitted would be moot.  If not,
defense counsel should be prepared to pay monetary sanctions and face an order
requiring verified Code-compliant responses without objection.
