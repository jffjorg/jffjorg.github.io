And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses three motions: (1) Motion to Compel Defendant Timreuka Trass's Further Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, (2) Motion to Compel Defendant Timreuka Trass's Further Responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One, and (3) Requests for Sanctions. The motions were filed by the plaintiffs, Christina Maier, Tierney Mauge, and Traci Maier, against the defendant, Kate Dunitz.

The judge notes that the defendant failed to provide timely responses to the plaintiffs' discovery requests and that the defendant's supplemental responses may moot the motions. The judge will allow oral argument on the factual issue of whether the defendant provided verified or supplemental responses. If the defendant did provide verified responses, the motions to compel and the motion to deem requests for admission as admitted would be moot. If not, the defendant's defense counsel should be prepared to pay monetary sanctions and face an order requiring verified Code-compliant responses without objection.
