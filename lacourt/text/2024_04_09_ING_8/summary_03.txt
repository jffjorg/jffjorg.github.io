And here is the English text summarizing the Judge's tentative ruling:

The tentative ruling denies the motion to be relieved as counsel filed by Manuel E. Gonzalez, attorney for the Plaintiffs, without prejudice to it being re-filed with the proper supporting documentation. The motion was denied because the attorney failed to comply with California Rules of Court 3.1362 by not including the required forms, specifically the MC-052 form, which states the reasons for bringing the motion. The court's discretion in granting or denying the motion is reasonable and exercised reasonably.
