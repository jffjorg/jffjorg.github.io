SUMMARY
OF ACTION

located at 6342 Pacific Bl., Huntington Park. The purchase price was
$2,050,000, with a 90-day escrow period. Kern deposited $60,000. Subsequent
negotiations based on requests for repair led to a reduction in price, with
escrow closing date remaining May 31, 2022. Plaintiff buyer failed to follow through
on the purchase. APB Properties, Inc. seeks the $60,000 deposit as liquidated
damages.

April 14, 2023. Kern alleges APB Properties, Inc. withheld material information
