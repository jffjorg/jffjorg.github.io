And here is a summary in English text of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has denied, without prejudice, the plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment against the defendant. The plaintiff, Sharif Fahim, had requested a default judgment of $1,021,635, including costs and special damages, against Mark Anderson, the defendant. However, the court found that the plaintiff's application contained a defect, as there was no sufficient evidence of damages provided. Specifically, there were no exhibits attached to the plaintiff's declaration showing payments to the defendant, and there was no justification provided for the $1,000,000 in special damages requested. The court has denied the request, allowing the plaintiff to re-file with sufficient evidence of damages.
