Sharif Fahim
Defaulting Party:        Defendant
Mark Anderson
Default Taken:            March 28, 2024
Application Filed:       September 23, 2024
 
Request for Entry of Default Judgment
 
The court DENIES WITHOUT PREJUDICE the request
for entry of default judgment.
 
Plaintiff Sharif
Fahim (“Plaintiff”) requests for entry of default judgment against Defendant
Mark Anderson (“Defendant”) in the amount of $1,021,635, including costs and
special damages.
Plaintiff’s
application contains the following defect:
1.     
Plaintiff has not provided
sufficient evidence of damages. There are no exhibits attached to the
declaration of Plaintiff showing payments to Defendant. There is also no
mention or justification of the $1,000,000 requested in special damages.
 
The court
therefore DENIES WITHOUT PREJUDICE Plaintiff’s request for entry of default
judgment.
            It
is so ordered.
