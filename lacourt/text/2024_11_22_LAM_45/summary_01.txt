Summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel further responses to interrogatories. The plaintiffs, Shaila and Subhash Mantri, filed a lawsuit against several defendants, including an insurance company and an insurance broker, alleging breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, negligence, intentional infliction of emotional distress, professional negligence, and fraud. The defendants moved to compel further responses to interrogatories, arguing that the plaintiffs' original responses were incomplete and evasive. The plaintiffs argued that the motion was moot because they had already provided further responses to the interrogatories. The court found that the plaintiffs' further responses adequately addressed each of the claimed deficiencies in the motion and denied the motion as moot. The court also denied the defendants' request for sanctions, finding that they failed to sufficiently demonstrate the inadequacy of the plaintiffs' original responses.
