Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Sedgwick's motion to dismiss the action, dismissing the case with prejudice. Sedgwick claims that the plaintiff did not serve them with the summons and complaint within the three-year period specified in California Code of Civil Procedure section 583.210(a). The plaintiff argues that the three-year period for service began when they filed the amended complaint, but the judge has determined that this is not a valid argument. The judge has also denied the plaintiff's request for estoppel, as there is no evidence that Sedgwick engaged in any conduct that would have led the plaintiff to rely on it. The judge has also denied Sedgwick's demurrer, as it is moot given the mandatory dismissal.
