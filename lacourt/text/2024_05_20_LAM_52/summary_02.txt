And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling is that the court cannot rule on defendant Chong Park's motion for summary judgment due to the automatic stay caused by co-defendant Howard Park's bankruptcy petition. The automatic stay prevents post-petition actions against the debtor, including the plaintiff's claims against Chong Park. The plaintiff's claims arise from an effort to collect a judgment against Howard Park, and the court cannot determine whether the plaintiff's claims fail on the merits while the case is stayed. The court vacates the hearing on the motion for summary judgment and will revisit the issue once the case is no longer stayed.
