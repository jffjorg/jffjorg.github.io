```

And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court grants the defendants' motion to strike portions of the plaintiff's complaint. The plaintiff's complaint was filed on December 12, 2023, and alleges that the defendants were involved in a motor vehicle accident. The defendants moved to strike the complaint, citing irrelevant, false, or improper matter. The court finds that the plaintiff failed to set forth specific facts to support allegations of willful, malicious, intentional, and/or reckless conduct, and therefore, the prayer for punitive damages is unsupported. The court grants the motion to strike with 20 days leave to amend.
