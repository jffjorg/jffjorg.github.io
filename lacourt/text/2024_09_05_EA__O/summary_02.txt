And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion filed by the Defendant regarding a real property claim. The judge has reviewed the evidence and decided to overrule the Plaintiff's evidentiary objections, as the Defendant's statements are based on personal knowledge and not speculative or assuming facts not in evidence. The judge will only focus on whether the Plaintiff has met its burden by a preponderance of the evidence that its claim for specific performance will prevail. The Defendant is not contesting the validity of the agreement, but is instead arguing defenses to contract formation, such as inadequate consideration and unconscionability. The judge will take into account the California Civil Practice Real Property Litigation (2024) and other relevant laws and case citations.
