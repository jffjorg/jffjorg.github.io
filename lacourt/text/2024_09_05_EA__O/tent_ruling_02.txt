[1] All of Plaintiff’s
evidentiary objections are overruled namely as Defendant is making statements
based upon her personal knowledge; thus, the statements are not speculative/not
assuming facts not in evidence.  
 


[2] The motion is
largely dedicated to the third element, but the motion briefly references this
second element. However, in Reply, Defendant “acknowledges that Plaintiff’s
complaint concerns real property and may be sufficient o consider a real
property claim….” (Reply p. 2:5-6.) Thus, the court will only focus on whether
Plaintiff has met its burden by a preponderance of the evidence that Plaintiffs
claim for specific performance will prevail. 
 


[3] As a preliminary
matter, Defendant makes clear that for purposes of this motion, Defendant is
not contesting the validity of the agreement. (See Motion p.
5:5-7 [“Although Defendant Homeowner reserves the right to contest the validity
of the Contract at trial, for purposes of this motion Defendant Homeowner is
not asserting the Contract is void or invalid….”].) But the motion and reply
largely speak to defenses to contract formation, which go to the validity
of a contract. (See e.g., Brawley v. Crosby Research Foundation (1946)
73 Cal.App.2d 103; § 56:4. Inadequate
consideration, 3 Cal. Affirmative Def. § 56:4 (2d ed.) See e.g., California
Civil Practice Real Property Litigation (2024) Circumstances
defeating formation of valid contract,
§ 1:37; see also § 55:1. Unconscionability—In general, 3 Cal. Affirmative Def.
§ 55:1, fns. 16, 17 (2d ed.).)

There is no separate COA for specific performance as it is a remedy. (See e.g.,
Green Valley Landowners Assn v. City of Vallejo (2015) 241 Cal.App.4th
425, 433.)
