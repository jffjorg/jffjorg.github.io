And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court grants Defendant Julia Anne Bodoh's motion to expunge the notice of pendency of action, which was recorded in the office of the county recorder. The court finds that the purchase price of $910,000 was fair and reasonable, considering the circumstances of the sale, including Defendant's need to sell the property quickly and Plaintiff's offer of a cash advance to assist with immediate financial needs. The court also determines that a damages remedy would provide Plaintiff with adequate relief, as Plaintiff is a professional homebuyer who buys property at or below market prices for profit.

The court denies Plaintiff's request for attorney fees, as Defendant did not act with substantial justification or other circumstances that would make the imposition of attorney fees and costs unjust.
