And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the Petitioner's Motion for Order Approving Transfer of Structured Settlement Payment Rights without prejudice. The Petitioner, M_W_84, LLC, seeks to transfer the structured settlement payments to themselves from Jessie Wong, as Parent and Natural Guardian of K.R. The Judge found that the Notice of Motion was procedurally defective because it did not include a copy of the First Amended Verified Petition, which was filed later. Additionally, the Petitioner failed to provide complete documentation, including proof of service and certain required exhibits. The Judge requires the Petitioner to re-file the motion with the missing amended petition and complete documentation before it can be considered further.
