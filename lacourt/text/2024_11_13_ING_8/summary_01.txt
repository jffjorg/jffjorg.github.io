Summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel arbitration filed by Lyft, Inc. The motion was granted with respect to Lyft, Inc., but the court is still considering whether to compel Chung Oh, a co-defendant, to arbitrate. The court is seeking oral argument on the issue. The judge noted that the arbitration provision in the agreement between Lyft, Inc. and the plaintiffs is valid and enforceable, and that the plaintiffs have waived their right to a jury trial. The court also noted that the arbitration provision applies to all claims, including motor vehicle injury claims, and that the plaintiffs lacked constructive notice of this provision.
