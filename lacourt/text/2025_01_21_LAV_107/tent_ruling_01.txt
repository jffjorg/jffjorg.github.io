COURT’S
  [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: 
  Motion for Summary Judgment 
 
                        



 
[THE FOLLOWING IS A TENTATIVE RULING IN THE ABOVE CASE]:  Denied.
 
 
I.               
BACKGROUND 
 
On December 21, 2022,
Plaintiff filed a complaint against Defendants Ali Mehranrazi (“Defendant”) and
Does 1 to 25, alleging causes of action for: (1) general negligence; and (2)
premises liability. 
 
The complaint alleged
that Defendant and Does 1 to 25 owned, managed, operated, controlled,
inspected, maintained, cleaned, repaired, guarded, supervised, renovated,
designed, monitored, constructed, and/or secured a wooden joist in an attic at
a property located at 963 Deep Wood Drive, Westlake Village, CA 91362 (the
“Subject Property”). (Complaint p. 4.) On October 11, 2022, Plaintiff Carlos
Bernal (“Plaintiff”) slipped and fell from the Subject Property’s attic.
(Complaint pp. 4-5.)
 
On November 14, 2024,
Defendant filed a motion for summary judgment (the “Motion”). On January 7,
2025, Plaintiff filed an opposition. On January 13, 2025, Defenant filed a
reply.
 
II.             
PLAINTIFF’S
REQUESTS FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
 
Plaintiff requests this
court take judicial notice of Defendant’s Notice of Motion and Motion for
Summary Judgment; or in the Alternative Summary Adjudication, filed and served
on Plaintiff on November 6, 2024. (Request for Judicial Notice p. 2.) Plaintiff
also requests this court take judicial notice of Defendant’s Notice of Hearing
Date Regarding Defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment or in the Alternative
Summary Adjudication, filed and served on Plaintiff on November 25, 2024.
(Request for Judicial Notice p. 2.) 
 
Evidence Code section 452,
subdivision (h) states that the court may take judicial notice of “Facts and
propositions that are not reasonably subject to dispute and are capable of
immediate and accurate determination by resort to sources of reasonably indisputable
accuracy.” Defendant filed a document with this court stating “Defendant
Ali Mehranrazi filed and served his Motion for Summary Judgment, or in the
Alternative Summary Adjudication. The Motion for Summary Judgement
inadvertently listed a hearing date of January 21, 2024. The correct hearing
date is January 21, 2025.” (Notice of Hearing Date filed 11/25/24.)
Accordingly, this court finds that Defendant’s Notice
of Motion and Motion for Summary Judgment; or in the Alternative Summary
Adjudication, filed and served on Plaintiff on November 6, 2024, is not
reasonably subject to dispute and grants Plaintiff’s request for judicial
notice.  (The specific document cannot be found in the court’s
file. This document has the wrong hearing date on the first and second page of
the notice of motion. The notice of motion filed by Defendant with the court on
November 14, 2024 has the correct hearing date on the first page of the notice
of motion, and the wrong date on the second page. (Plaintiff Ex. 5.))
 
This court need not take
judicial notice of Defendant’s Notice of Hearing Date Regarding Defendant’s
Motion for Summary Judgment or in the Alternative Summary Adjudication, filed
and served on Plaintiff on November 25, 2024, because it is part of the case
file.
 
III.          
DEFENDANT’S
OBJECTIONS
 
Defendant raises five
objections to Ryan J. Radebach’s declaration. While this decision does not rely on Radebach’s declaration and it
is not necessary to address the objections, this court this court overrules Objections 1 and 2, and sustains
Objections 3, 4, and 5. Regarding
the portions of Radebach’s declaration that relate to Objection Nos. 3 through
5 - Radebach makes statements such as “The dilapidated condition of the floor
joist was a concealed hazard that was not reasonably detectable and even though
Defendant knew about this water damage and potential pest he failed to warn the
Plaintiff. . .”, “The Defendant knew or should have known about the issues
identified in the reports from the inspection and should have warned the
Plaintiff that there could be damage from water and/or pest possibly decreasing
the integrity of the floor joists in the attic . . .”., and “There were enough
indicators that latent safety hazards were likely present in the attic to where
it was reasonable to expect the Defendant to recognize this and warn people
prior to entering the attic space.” Radebach’s statement Defendant knew about
the damage lacks foundation.
Regarding the other
statements -that
Defendant knew or should have known and Defendant’s duty to warn are
conclusions - and they are not relevant.
 
IV.           
TIMELINESS
 
A.   
Trial Date
 
A motion for summary
judgment “shall be heard no later than 30 days before the date of trial, unless
the court for good cause orders otherwise.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c(a)(3).)
 
Trial in this case is set for February 19, 2025. Thirty days
before February 19, 2025, was January 20, 2025. The hearing on this Motion is
set for January 21, 2025.
 
Defendant filed multiple ex parte applications seeking to
allow the Motion to be heard within 30 days of the current trial date, or, in
the alternative, seeking to continue the trial date. (Ex Parte Application
filed 01/06/25; Ex Parte Application filed 12/19/24; Ex Parte Application
12/09/24.) This court denied Defendant’s applications. (12/10/24 Minute Order;
12/20/24 Minute Order; 01/07/25 Minute Order.) Accordingly, this court has not
found good cause to hear the Motion less than 30 days before trial.
 
Further, Defendant filed the Motion on November 14, 2024, but
did not file the first ex parte application seeking an order allowing the
Motion to be heard within thirty days of trial until December 9, 2024.  In Robinson v. Woods (2008) 168
Cal.App.4th 1258, 1268, the defendants argued the notice was invalid. First,
the defendants argued that the plaintiffs served the defendants with the notice
by mail 76 days before the hearing, which was invalid because “the hearing had
to be set at least 80 days after service by mail – the standard 75 days plus
five days if mailed to a location in California.” (Id.) The defendants
also argued that the hearing date was set for only 18 days before trial, and
“the motion had to be heard no later than 30 days before the trial date unless
the trial court ruled otherwise for ‘good cause.’” (Id.) On April 12,
2007, the trial court continued the hearing for four days and “advised
defendants to file a declaration setting forth the reasons why the motion
should be heard within 30 days of trial[.]” (Id. at p. 1261.) At the
April 16, 2007 hearing, the trial court found “good cause for the motion being
brought within 30 days of trial” and considered the motion’s merits. (Id.)
The Court of Appeal reversed. (Id. at p. 1269.) First, the Court of
Appeal found that the plaintiffs did not receive the required 75-day notice. (Id.
at p. 1268.) The Court also found that the April 12, 2007 hearing was invalid,
stating “Defendants noticed their motion for hearing within 30 days of the
trial date without first obtaining a determination of good cause from the trial
court. [Citation]. Unless and until the trial court found good cause, the
notice of the hearing was invalid.” 
 
Like Robinson, Defendant noticed the Motion for
hearing within 30 days of the trial date, without first obtaining a
determination of good cause from this court. Further, this court never found
good cause to permit the Motion to be heard within 30 days of the trial date.
Accordingly, the notice of hearing was invalid. 
 
B.   
Minimum
Notice Period
 
A motion for summary
judgment “may be made at any time after 60 days have elapsed since the general
appearance in the action or proceeding of each party against whom the motion is
directed or at any earlier time after the general appearance that the court,
with or without notice and upon good cause shown, may direct.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 437c(a)(1).) 
 
Effective from January 1, 2017, to December 31, 2024:
 
(2) Notice of the motion and supporting
papers shall be served on all other parties to the action at least 75 days
before the time appointed for hearing. If the
notice is served by mail, the required 75-day period of notice shall be
increased by 5 days if the place of address is within the State of California,
10 days if the place of address is outside the State of California but within
the United States, and 20 days if the place of address is outside the United
States. If the notice is served by
facsimile transmission, express mail, or another method of delivery providing
for overnight delivery, the required 75-day period of notice shall be increased
by two court days.
 
(Former Code Civ. Proc., § 437c(a)(2), enacted 2016)
 
Effective January 1, 2025:
 
(2) Notice of the motion and supporting
papers shall be served on all other parties to the action at least 81 days before the time appointed for
hearing. If the notice is served by mail, the required 81-day period of notice shall be
increased by 5 days if the place of address is within the State of California,
10 days if the place of address is outside the State of California but within
the United States, and 20 days if the place of address is outside the United
States. If the notice is served by facsimile transmission, express mail, or
another method of delivery providing for overnight delivery, the required 81-day period of notice shall be
increased by two court days.
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 437c(a)(2).)
 
Courts have no authority to shorten the minimum notice
period for a summary judgment motion. (See Urshan v. Musicians’ Credit Union
(2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 758, 764 [“[A] trial court has discretion to shorten the initial
60–day period to bring a motion for summary judgment on a showing of good
cause. Similarly, a trial court has discretion to shorten the 30–day period in
which a motion for summary judgment must be heard before trial where
circumstances warrant. However, the Legislature did not similarly authorize a
trial court to shorten the minimum notice period for hearings on summary
judgment motions. Moreover, the statutory language regarding minimum notice is
mandatory, not directive.”]
 
The Motion is set for hearing on January 21, 2025.
Seventy-five days before January 21, 2025, was November 7, 2024. 
 
Defendant attaches two
proofs of service to the Motion. 
 
The first proof of service
states Defendant served Plaintiff with the Motion and supporting documents, by
email, on November 14, 2024. (Motion pdf p. 18.) The notice of motion served
November 14, 2024, is clearly untimely.
 
The second proof of service
states Defendant served Plaintiff with the Motion and supporting documents on
November 6, 2024, “(BY PERSONAL SERVICE) I placed such envelopes for
collection and to be mailed on this date following ordinary business
practices.” 
 
Although the November 6, 2024, proof of service state
it was served “BY PERSONAL SERVICE”, the description of such service states
Defendant “placed such envelopes for collection and to be mailed on [November
6, 2024.]” Plaintiff’s counsel’s address is in California. Per Code of Civil
Procedure section 437c, subdivision (a)(2), enacted 2016, “If the
notice is served by mail, the required 75-day period of notice shall be
increased by 5 days if the place of address is within the State of
California[.]” Five days before November 7, 2024 was November 2, 2024.
Defendant mailed the documents on November 6, 2024. Thus, the Motion is untimely because
Defendant did not provide Plaintiff with the minimum notice period required under
Code of Civil Procedure section 437c.
 
Further, the notice of motion served on November 6, 2024, was
defective for a second reason. The notice of motion served on November 6, 2024,
listed the hearing date as “January 21, 2024.” (Plaintiff Ex. 5.) The hearing
in this case is set for January 21, 2025. “Notices must be in writing, and the
notice of a motion, other than for a new trial, must state when, and the
grounds upon which it will be made, and the papers, if any, upon which it is to
be based.” (Code of Civ. Proc., § 1010.) 
Accordingly, the notice served on November 6, 2024, was defective
because it did not list the correct hearing date.
 
Defendant attempted to correct this issue by serving
Plaintiff with an amended notice on November 25, 2024, which stated “On
November 6, 2024, Defendant Ali Mehranrazi filed and served his Motion for
Summary Judgment, or in the Alternative Summary Adjudication. The Motion for
Summary Judgement inadvertently listed a hearing date of January 21, 2024. The
correct hearing date is January 21, 2025.” (Defendant’s
Notice of Hearing Date Regarding Defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment or in
the Alternative Summary Adjudication filed 11/25/24.) 
 
In Golf &
Tennis Pro Shop, Inc. v. Superior Court (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 127, 138-139,
a petitioner filed a defective notice relating to a motion to compel, and then
attempted to cure the defect by serving an amended notice. On appeal, the
petitioner argued “it filed and served amended notices for the motions ‘well
ahead’ of the . . . hearing date.” (Id.) 
The Court of Appeal rejected that argument, stating “[w]e are glad
petitioner got around to it, but it was still too little, too late. Section
2030.300, subdivision (c) required adequate notice to be given to plaintiffs
and the court 45 days after service of the verified response, not in some
nebulous timeframe that was ‘well ahead of the hearing date.’” (Id.)  In that case “petitioner's notice of
motion was ineffective in doing what a notice is meant to do. It stated
petitioner's intent to move to compel further responses by Layus to the first
set of special interrogatories, but it did not identify the specific
interrogatories, leaving both Layus and the court with the potential impression
that all interrogatories were at issue. It did not cite any
statutory authority for the motion, or attempt to state what, if anything, was
deficient about Layus's responses to the interrogatories. It also failed to
identify the papers upon which it was to be based.” Accordingly, Golf &
Tennis Pro Shop, Inc. had a different defect than the defect at issue here.
However, it is still analogous to the defect here because both cases involve
notices that did not contain the information required by Code of Civil
Procedure section 1010. [“Notices must be in writing, and the notice of a
motion, other than for a new trial, must state when, and the grounds upon which
it will be made, and the papers, if any, upon which it is to be based.”]
 
Likewise, here, Code of Civil Procedure section 437c,
subdivision (a)(2), enacted 2016, requires a party moving for summary judgment
serve the notice of motion and supporting papers on the opposing party at least
75 days before the hearing, plus additional time depending on the method of
service. Further, Code of Civil Procedure section 1010 requires that the notice
“state when, and the
grounds upon which it will be made, and the papers, if any, upon which it is to
be based.” (Italics added.) Defendant served Plaintiff with the notice that contained the correct hearing date on November 25, 2024.
November 25, 2024, was only 57 days before the hearing on this Motion, so it
did not provide Plaintiff with the required minimum notice under section 437c.
 
In the reply, Defendant cites Luri v. Greenwald (2003)
107 Cal.App.4th 1119, 1125, and states that the notice was sufficient because
Plaintiff’s counsel received actual notice of the hearing date, “even if there
was a typographical error on the caption page regarding the year of the
hearing, the reservation page attached to the Motion indicated the correct
hearing date”, “Plaintiff was provided with sufficient notice for the hearing”,
and “given that the Motion was filed in November, and the hearing date was
noticed for February, it would be an impossibility that the hearing would take
place in 2024.” (Reply pp. 6-7.) In Luri v. Greenwald, supra, 107
Cal.App.4th at p. 1125, the Court of Appeal stated that “An omission in the
notice may be overlooked if the supporting papers make clear the grounds for
the relief sought. [Citations.] The purpose of these requirements is to cause
the moving party to ‘sufficiently define the issues for the information and
attention of the adverse party and the court.” In Luri, Luri argued that
“even though her section 473 motion only referred to discretionary relief, the
trial court erred by not treating the motion as though it sought relief under
the mandatory provision of section 473 because the motion was accompanied by a
declaration of an attorney indicating his fault.” (Id. at p. 1124.) The
Court of Appeal noted that this argument “is not consistent with procedural
rules governing motions” including section 1010’s requirement “that a notice of
motion must state ‘the grounds upon which it will be made.’” (Id. at p.
1125.) The Court in Luri also noted that “Because Luri’s motion did not
include a notice of motion stating ‘the grounds upon which the motion will be
made’ [citation] or an opening paragraph stating ‘the nature of the order being
sought and the grounds for issuance of the order’ [citation] the trial court
could reasonably have rejected the entire motion as defective and noncompliant
with California rules and statutes. The trial court overlooked these defects
and reviewed the documents submitted to determine the specific basis upon which
Luri sought relief . . .” (Id. at p. 1127.) Thus, the Luri Court
acknowledged that a trial court may reject a motion when the notice of motion
does not comply with California rules and statutes. Further, Luri did
not involve the same issue as this case.
 
This court applies the version of section 437c in effect in
2024. However, this court also notes that applying the version of section 437c
in effect in 2025 would not change the outcome here, because the 2025 version
increased the required notice period from 75 days to 81 days.
 
Thus, Defendant’s amended notice was untimely and
insufficient to cure the original defective notice of hearing. This court has
no authority to shorten the minimum notice period under section 437c,
subdivision (a)(2). (Urshan v. Musicians’ Credit Union, supra, 120
Cal.App.4th at p. 764.) 
 
V.             
CONCLUSION
 
For the foregoing
reasons, Defendant’s Motion is denied.
