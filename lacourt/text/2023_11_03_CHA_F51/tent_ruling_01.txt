  Case Number:  22CHCV01007    Hearing Date:   November 3, 2023    Dept:  F51 MOTION FOR  ATTORNEY FEES  Los Angeles Superior Court Case # 22CHCV01007      Motion Filed: 8/11/23   MOVING PARTY: Plaintiff Juan Antonio Carrillo Berumen  (“Plaintiff”) RESPONDING PARTY: Defendants Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC,  and Mercedes-Benz of Valencia (collectively, “Defendants”) NOTICE: OK   RELIEF REQUESTED: A judgment in favor of Plaintiff and  against Defendants, and an order granting Plaintiff his attorney fees and costs  in the amount of $23,846.23.   TENTATIVE RULING: The motion is granted in part. Plaintiff  is awarded $15,666.23 in attorney fees and costs.  The request for a “judgment” is denied. The  parties or party may file a separate request for a judgment, or the parties may  file a stipulated judgment consistent with the Court’s ruling.     EVIDENTIARY OBJECTIONS: Defendants’ evidentiary  objections are overruled.   Plaintiff is reminded to review the 5/3/19 First Amended  General Order Re Mandatory Electronic Filing for Civil.¿When e-filing  documents, parties must comply with the “TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS” which are set  forth at page 4, line 4 through page 5, line 12 of the Court’s 5/3/19 First  Amended General Order Re Mandatory Electronic Filing for Civil (particularly  bookmarking declarations and exhibits). (CRC 3.1110(f)(4).) Failure to comply  with these requirements in the future may result in papers being rejected, matters  being placed off calendar, matters being continued so documents can be  resubmitted in compliance with these requirements, documents not being  considered and/or the imposition of sanctions.   BACKGROUND     On 4/26/23, the parties entered  into a settlement agreement. (Decl. of Michael Saeedian ¶ 19.) On 8/11/23, Plaintiff filed the instant  motion. On 10/25/23, Defendants filed their opposition. On 10/27/23, Plaintiff  filed his reply.   ANALYSIS   1.       Right to Recovery   An award of  attorney fees is proper when authorized by contract, statute, or law. (Code  Civ. Proc. §§ 1032, subd. (b); 1033.5, subd. (a)(10).) Here, the Song-Beverly Act  authorizes a buyer “to recover as part of the judgment a sum equal to the  aggregate amount of costs and expenses, including attorney’s fees based on  actual time expended, determined by the court to have been reasonably incurred  by the buyer in connection with the commencement and prosecution of such  action.” (Civ. Code § 1794, subd. (d).)   Moreover,  Plaintiff bases his instant motion on the settlement agreement wherein  Defendants agreed to pay “‘attorney’s fees and costs reasonably incurred by Plaintiff’  by way of Plaintiff’s ‘single noticed motion, unless the parties agree on the  amount of fees, costs, and expenses to be paid absent such a motion.’” (Saeedian  Decl. ¶ 18.) The Court notes that Plaintiff has not attached a copy of the  agreement to his moving papers for the Court’s corroboration. Nevertheless, the  Court finds that the Song-Beverly Act affords Plaintiff the right to recover  reasonable attorney fees.   2.       Attorney Fees Incurred   A buyer prevailing  under the Song-Beverly Act may recover “reasonable” attorney fees and costs as  determined by the Court. (Civ. Code § 1794, subd. (d).) “The burden is on the  party seeking attorney fees to prove that the fees it seeks are reasonable.” (Gonzalez  v. Santa Clara County Dept. of Social Services (2017) 9 Cal.App.5th 162,  169.) In determining a reasonable fee award, the Court begins with the lodestar  method of calculation, i.e., the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied  by the reasonable hourly rate.¿(Karton v. Ari Design & Construction,  Inc. (2021) 61 Cal.App.5th 734, 744; PLCM Group, Inc. v. Drexler  (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095–1096.)    Here, Plaintiff  seeks to recover $22,890.00 in attorney fees, encompassing 44.6 hours of his  attorneys’ time, billed at the following rates:      Name   Title   Hourly    Rate   Hours   Total     Michael Saeedian   Partner   $695.00   21.5   $14,942.50     Chrisopher Urner   Managing Attorney   $525.00   7.9   $4,147.50     Jorge Acosta   Certified Law Clerk   $250.00   15.2   $3,800.00     Total   44.6   $22,890.00      a.       Counsel’s  Hourly Rate   When  determining a reasonable hourly rate, courts consider whether the stated rates  “are within the range of reasonable rates charged by and judicially awarded  [to] comparable attorneys for comparable work.” (Children's Hosp. & Med.  Ctr. v. Bonta (2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 740, 783.)   In his  moving papers, Plaintiff asserts that “the rates charged by The Lemon Pros, LLP  are commensurate with the experience and skill of the attorneys involved and  the general rates of attorneys in Los Angeles California that handle consumer  protection lawsuits on a contingency basis.” (Pl.’s Mot. 9:1–3.) Counsel  declares that these rates are commensurate with the Laffey Matrix, an attorney  fee billing matrix for attorneys in the Washington, D.C. metro area, which  California courts have applied to attorney fee awards in the Los Angeles area.  (Saeedian Decl. ¶ 12, citing Pasternack v. McCullough (2021) 65  Cal.App.5th 1050, 1057, fn. 5; Tukes v. Richard (2022) 81 Cal.App.5th 1;  569 E. Cnty. Boulevard LLC v. Backcountry Against the Dump, Inc. (2016)  248 Cal.App.4th 125; Gutierrez v. Chopard U.S. Ltd. (2022) 82  Cal.App.5th 383; Syers Properties III, Inc. v. Rankin (2014) 226  Cal.App.4th 691; Nemecek v. Horn (2012) 208 Cal.App.4th 641.)   In  opposition, Defendants present several cases where the court elected to reduce  hourly billing rates of plaintiff’s counsel in similar cases. (Defs.’ Opp. 9:22–10:21.)  Defendants assert that Plaintiff’s attorneys’ hourly rates should be reduced to  a blended rate of $350.00 per hour, because “no evidence is presented that  these attorneys actually bill any clients at those rates (because they do  not).” (Id. at 11:6–8.) Defendants further argue that “Plaintiff’s  Counsel claims rates that are almost triple actual market rates for the same  kind of work,” as “defense firms typically charge approximately $250/hour in  warranty defense litigation.” (Id. at 11:8–10.)   In reply,  Plaintiff argues that lawyers who work on a contingency fee basis may seek  heightened attorney fees because of the inherent contingent risk associated  with their cases. (Pl.’s Reply 8:27–9:2, citing Ketchum v. Moses (2001)  24 Cal.4th 1122, 1132 “a contingent fee contract, since it involves a gamble on  the result, may properly provide for a larger compensation than would otherwise  be reasonable.”) Additionally, Plaintiff argues that “the fact that MBUSA’s  attorneys are willing to work for rates comparable to what many firms charge  for their paralegals is of no import in determining the actual or reasonable ‘market’  rate for attorneys.” (Id. at 7:15–17, citing Goglin v. BMW of North  America, LLC (2016) 4 Cal.App.5th 462, 473–474 “although BMW North America  and BMW San Diego presented evidence they paid their counsel much lower hourly  rates, the trial court was not obliged to accept this evidence as conclusive of  the appropriate hourly rate for the work performed by Goglin's counsel.”)   The Court  finds that Plaintiff’s attorney’s hourly rates exceed the range of reasonable  rates charged by attorneys in these types of cases and judicially awarded in  similar cases.  The Court reduces the  hourly rates as follows:      Name   Title   Hourly    Rate   Hours   Total     Michael Saeedian   Partner   $400.00   21.5   $8600.00     Chrisopher Urner   Managing Attorney   $400.00   7.9   $3160.00     Jorge Acosta   Certified Law Clerk   $250.00   15.2   $3800.00     Total   44.6   $15,560.00          b.      Hours  Expended   Plaintiff  seeks to recover attorney fees for the 44.6 hours expended by his attorneys on  this matter, totaling $22,890.00. Plaintiff proffers an itemized list of time  entries detailing his attorneys’ work on this matter. (Ex. A to Saeedian Decl.)   In addition  to the attorney hourly billing rate, Defendants challenge the following  specific entries in Plaintiff’s attorneys’ proffered time log: (1) 2 hours  communicating with Plaintiff to obtain sales and service records; (2) 1.8 hours  drafting the attorney-client agreement; (3) 2.9 hours drafting and filing  Plaintiff’s complaint; (4) 2.3 hours spent drafting discovery requests; (5) 5  hours spent reading and opposing Defendants’ motion to compel arbitration; (6)  7.6 hours drafting the instant motion, reading Defendant’s opposition to the  instant motion, drafting a reply, and preparing for the hearing; and (7) time  spent on clerical tasks.   i.                     Client Communications   Defendants  argue that “there is no reason [why communicating with Plaintiff to obtain  sales, service and repair records] should take 2 hours and seven separate  communications,” and this amount should be reduced to 0.5 hours. (Defs.’ Opp.  5:24–6:4.) Plaintiff argues in reply that the time incurred is reasonable  because for plaintiffs like himself, these records are not readily available  and require more time to locate and obtain than those kept by such corporate  entities as Defendants. (Pl.’s Reply 2:2–14.) Based on the foregoing, the Court  declines to grant Defendants’ request to reduce the fee demand for these tasks  by 1.5 hours.   ii.                   Attorney-Client Agreement; Complaint   Defendants  further argue that the attorney fees incurred by Plaintiff’s attorneys in  client intake, drafting the attorney-client agreement, and clerical fees for preparing,  filing, and serving the complaint are not recoverable. (Defs.’ Opp. 6:5–25.)   As  Plaintiff observes in reply, the Song-Beverly act authorizes a buyer “to  recover as part of the judgment a sum equal to the aggregate amount of costs  and expenses, including attorney’s fees based on actual time expended,  determined by the court to have been reasonably incurred by the buyer in  connection with the commencement and prosecution of such action.” (Civ.  Code § 1794, subd. (d) [emphasis added].) Based on the foregoing, the Court  finds that Plaintiff is entitled by statute to seek attorney fees in relation  to the time his attorneys incurred for the tasks in question. Accordingly, the  Court declines to grant Defendants’ request to reduce the fee demand for such  tasks by 3.7 hours.   iii.                 Discovery   Defendants  further argue that the attorney fees incurred by Plaintiff in drafting  discovery requests to defendant Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC must be stricken, where  “only one set of discovery was served, and that was to MB of Valencia. Because  of this, these entries are twice as long as supported by the documents that  were served.” (Defs.’ Opp. 7:2–3.)   On reply,  Plaintiff proffers the signed proofs of service for discovery requests  propounded on both Defendants. (Ex. A to Pl.’s Reply.) “While it is certainly  possible that staff for Plaintiff failed to actually serve the discovery to  MBUSA, it is also unlikely that such a mistake would be made given that the  proof of service is signed and saved in the case file.” (Pl.’s Reply 4:1–4.)   Based on  the foregoing, the Court finds that the above fees were reasonably incurred and  declines to grant Defendants’ request to reduce the fee demand for the  discovery requests by 2.3 hours.   iv.                 Motion to Compel Arbitration   Defendants  further argue that the attorney fees incurred by Plaintiff in reviewing  Defendants’ motion to compel arbitration and reply in preparation for the  hearing on the same was excessive. (Defs.’ Opp. 7:9–14.) On reply, Plaintiff  concedes that 1.5 hours of time billed for these tasks were duplicative. (Pl.’s  Reply 4:15–19.) Accordingly, the Court reduces the fee demand for these tasks  by 1.5 hours, billed at the Court imposed rate of $400.00 per hour, for a total  reduction of $600.00.    v.                    Fee Motion   Defendants  further argue that the attorney fees incurred by Plaintiff in preparing the  instant fee motion are excessive and not recoverable. (Defs.’ Opp. 7:25–8:9.)  On reply, Plaintiff provides authority allowing for the recovery of anticipated  post-settlement attorney fees, including anticipated time spent on motions for  attorney fees. (Pls.’ Mot. 5:8–15, citing Serrano v. Unruh (1982) 32  Cal.3d 621, 638–639.) Based on the foregoing, the Court finds that the above  fees were reasonably incurred and declines to grant Defendants’ request to  reduce the fee demand for the time incurred in relation to the instant motion  by 2.1 hours.   vi.                 Clerical Tasks   Defendants  argue generally that “throughout the billing records, there are countless  examples of paralegals billing for tasks that are clerical and routinely found  to be general overhead of running a law firm.” (Defs.’ Opp. 8:10–12.) As  Plaintiff observes, Defendants fail to identify or cite any specific time  entries challenged to this extent. (Pl.’s Reply 6:5–7.) Accordingly, the Court  declines to reduce the fee demand for any such unspecified tasks.   vii.               Code of Civil Procedure Section 998 Offer   Defendants  assert that “on January 30, 2023, MBUSA served a CCP 998 offer to compromise  offering to repurchase the Subject Vehicle for $37,500 and offering $8500 in  attorney’s fees, costs and expenses or to be determined by noticed motion.” (Defs.’  Opp. 3:4–6.) “There is no mention of the CCP 998 offer in the billing records  and no communication with Plaintiff for the entire time (30 days) the CCP 998  offer was open.” (Id. at 9:5–6.) Defendants argue that such an omission  “appropriately calls into question the need for the fees incurred after the CCP  998 offer was served,” therefore the Court should not grant Plaintiff’s  attorney fees incurred after the offer was tendered. (Id. at 9:17–18.)   Plaintiff  argues on reply that Defendants’ contention “is entirely irrelevant to any  award of reasonable attorney fees and whether Plaintiff billed for this time or  not, it provides zero legal support that attorney fees are cut off because of a  lack of a billing entry.” (Pl.’s Reply 6:16–18.) Moreover, “it is an error of  law for the trial court to reduce or deny an award of attorney fees in a civil  rights or public interest case on the basis of a plaintiff's rejection of a Code  of Civil Procedure section 998 offer when the ultimate recovery has exceeded  the rejected offer.” (Id. at 6:18–21, quoting Reck v. FCA US LLC  (2021) 64 Cal.App.5th 682, 697.) Here, as Plaintiff notes, the ultimate  settlement amount exceeds that offered in Defendants’ rejected section 998  compromise. (Id. at 6:13–15.)   Based on  the foregoing, the Court finds that the above fees were reasonably incurred and  declines to grant Defendants’ request to reduce the fee demand for the time  after they tendered their section 998 offer to compromise.   3.       Costs Incurred   Plaintiff asserts  that he incurred costs and expenses totaling $956.23, which encompasses: (1) $61.65  in filing and motion fees; (2) $147.19 in process server fees; (3) $497.39 in  electronic filing/service fees; and (4) $250.00 in other unspecified costs.  (Ex. B to Saeedian Decl.)[1] The  Court notes that Defendants do not challenge the purported costs incurred by  Plaintiff in this action. Nevertheless, the Court finds that Plaintiff has not  specified what “Other” costs he has incurred totaling the $250.00 he seeks to  recover. (Id. at ¶ 16.) Accordingly, the Court reduces the cost award by  $250.00.   Based on  the foregoing, the Court finds it reasonable to award Plaintiff $15,666.23 in  attorney fees and costs.   CONCLUSION   The motion is granted in part. Plaintiff is awarded $15,666.23  in attorney fees and costs.   The Court is not requesting oral argument on  this matter.  Pursuant to California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1308(a)(1)  notice of intent to appear is required.  Unless the Court directs argument  in the Tentative Ruling, no argument will be permitted unless a “party notifies  all other parties and the court by 4:00 p.m. on the court day before the  hearing of the party’s intention to appear and argue.  “The tentative  ruling will become the ruling of the court if no notice of intent to appear is received.”         Notice may be given either by email at CHAdeptF51@LACourt.org or by  telephone at (818) 407-2233.
