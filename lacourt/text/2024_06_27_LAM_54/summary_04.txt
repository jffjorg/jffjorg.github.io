And here is the English text summary of the tentative ruling:

The Judge has granted the Defendants' motion to compel arbitration and has stayed the action. The Judge finds that the arbitration agreement executed by the Plaintiff on April 10, 2023 is valid and enforceable. The agreement requires confidential arbitration and does not limit the Plaintiff's discovery. The Judge also finds that the arbitration agreement is not procedurally or substantively unconscionable. The Plaintiff had argued that the agreement was procedurally unconscionable because it was an adhesion contract, but the Judge found that the degree of procedural unconscionability was low. The Plaintiff also argued that the agreement was substantively unconscionable because it limited depositions and required arbitration to be conducted by JAMS, but the Judge found that these provisions did not render the agreement unconscionable.
