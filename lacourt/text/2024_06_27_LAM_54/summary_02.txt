And here is a summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case between Pacific Western Bank (plaintiff) and Norman J. Kravetz, Glenda J. Kravetz, and E&O Asset Holdings, LLC (defendants). The plaintiff is seeking summary judgment or summary adjudication on several claims, including breach of promissory note, conspiracy to fraudulently conceal assets, aiding and abetting fraudulent concealment of assets, voidable transfer, and declaratory relief.

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment on the first cause of action for breach of contract against Mr. Kravetz, finding that there is a triable issue of fact as to the parties' course of dealing and their understanding of the contract. The judge has also denied the motion for summary adjudication of the claim for fraudulent transfer, finding that there is a triable issue of fact as to whether the transfer was made with actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud any creditor.

The judge has scheduled a hearing for June 27, 2024, and has invited the parties to submit any further arguments or evidence by email.
