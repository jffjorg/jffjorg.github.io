And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer to the second amended complaint filed by Azariah M. Ellington against the Franchise Tax Board of California and Daniel Ortiz. The Judge has sustained the demurrer without leave to amend, meaning that the complaint cannot be corrected and will be dismissed. The Judge found that the plaintiff failed to state sufficient facts and allegations to support his causes of action, and that he did not comply with the claim presentation requirements of the Government Code. The Judge also found that the defendants are immune from liability under the Government Code, and that the plaintiff does not have a valid claim against them. The motion to strike is moot as a result of the demurrer being sustained.
