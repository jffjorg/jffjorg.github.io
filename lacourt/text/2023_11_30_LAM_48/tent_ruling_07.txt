  CASE NO.: 23STCV03206
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTIONS TO BE
  RELIEVED AS COUNSEL
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
November 30, 2023



 
Claudia
Borsutzki seeks to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiffs Brenna Palmer, Bella Lockridge
(a minor by and through her guardian ad litem Breanna Palmer), and Baisley Lockridge
(a minor by and through her guardian ad litem Breanna Palmer).  Counsel’s declaration states that there has been
a complete breakdown in communication and lack of cooperation by Brenna Palmer.  No party opposed the motion.
Absent
a showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney’s request for withdrawal should be
granted.  (People v. Prince (1968)
268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406.)  Counsel’s motions
comply with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362.  No prejudice is shown.
The
proposed orders do not include Plaintiffs’ current or last known phone numbers,
but counsel provides this information in her supplemental declaration.  The Court will add the phone numbers before signing
the orders.
The
unopposed motions to be relieved are GRANTED and effective upon filing a proof of
service showing service of the signed Form MC-053 orders and this order on Brenna
Palmer, Bella Lockridge (a minor by and through her guardian ad litem Breanna Palmer),
and Baisley Lockridge (a minor by and through her guardian ad litem Breanna Palmer),
and all parties who have appeared.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
