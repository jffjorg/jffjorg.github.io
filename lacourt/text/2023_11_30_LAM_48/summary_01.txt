Summary of the tentative ruling:

The judge has sustained the demurrer of the defendants to the second, third, and fourth causes of action of the plaintiffs' complaint. The plaintiffs have failed to plead sufficient facts to state a claim for accounting, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and negligent infliction of emotional distress. The plaintiffs have not alleged a fiduciary relationship or any relationship with the defendants that would require an accounting. The alleged conduct of the defendants in buying and selling real property is not extreme or outrageous and does not constitute a duty owed to the plaintiffs. The judge has ordered the defendants to file an answer to the remaining first cause of action within 10 days.
