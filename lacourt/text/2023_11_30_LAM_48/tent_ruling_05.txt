  CASE NO.: 22STCV31256
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTIONS TO COMPEL
  DISCOVERY
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
November 30, 2023



 
On June 30, 2023, Defendant Driven
Staff LLC served Form Interrogatories – General, Form Interrogatories – Employment,
and Demands for Production of Documents on Plaintiff Domingo Sebastian.  Plaintiff served objections, but no further responses.
On
October 31, 2023, Defendant filed three motions to compel responses to discovery.
A.        The Motions Actually Seek to Compel Further
Responses.
Although
Defendant asserts that these motions are to compel responses and counsel had “no
obligation” to meet and confer (Marko Decl. ¶ 5), the motions in fact seek to compel
further responses.  Plaintiff served “objections,
with no responses or verifications.”  (Marko
Decl. ¶ 5.)  Objections are a code-compliant
response.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.210,
subd. (a)(3), 2031.210, subd. (a)(3).)  A
response containing only objections does not need to be verified by the party.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.250, 2031.250.)
Therefore,
because Plaintiff did provide responses, Defendant should have filed a Separate
Statement or followed the Court’s alternative method of outlining the disputes.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300, subd. (b), 2031.310,
subd. (b); California Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b).)  This Department requires the parties to meet and
confer on the substantive issues before filing a joint statement, following the
procedures outlined in Exhibit A of Department 48’s Courtroom Information (available
on the court’s website).
Counsel
is cautioned to follow the appropriate procedures for any future motions.
B.        The Motions are Timely.
In
the absence of a written agreement between the parties, a motion to compel further
responses to RFPs, interrogatories, and RFAs must be filed within 45 days after
the insufficient response.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§§ 2030.300, subd. (c), 2031.310, subd. (c), 2033.290, subd. (c).)  This deadline is jurisdictional and “renders the
court without authority to rule on motions to compel other than to deny them.”  (See Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58
Cal.App.4th 1403, 1409-1410.)
Defendant’s
counsel declares that after the extension to August 23, 2023, “no further extension
was requested or granted at that time.”  (Marko
Decl. ¶ 5.)  Saturday, October 7, 2023 was
45 days later, making Monday, October 9 the deadline to file a motion.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2016.060.)  On October 7, 2023, Defendant’s counsel’s sent
an email stating that she was “following up regarding plaintiff's responses,” that
she “wish[ed] to avoid the burden of having to file a motion to compel and involve
the court in discovery issues, if possible,” and that Plaintiff’s counsel should
advise about the status of responses.  (Marko
Decl., Ex. 2.)  On October 9, 2023, Plaintiff’s
counsel replied that she was “working on them and will provide them by Monday, October
16, 2023.”  The next day, Defendant’s counsel
thanked her for the update.
Although
not a clear grant of an extension, the Court finds that this is a sufficient agreement
in writing to extend the time for Plaintiff to respond after the original August
23, 2023 extension.  Accordingly, the motions
filed on October 31, 2023 are timely.
C.        The Unopposed Motions Are Granted.
Defendant
does not include copies of Plaintiff’s responses.  However, Defendant’s motions set forth Plaintiff’s
boilerplate objections that, according to Defendant, are the same for every request.  Plaintiff’s objections are overruled.
The
motions are GRANTED.  Plaintiff is ordered
to provide verified responses, without objections, to Form Interrogatories – General,
Form Interrogatories – Employment, and Demands for Production within 30 days.
The
requests for sanctions are GRANTED IN PART. 
The Court will not award attorney fees for two hours of hearings for each
motion.  (See Marko Decl. ¶ 7.)  The Court finds that a reasonable sanction is
$615 per motion (3 hours at $185 plus $60 filing fee).  Plaintiff’s counsel is ordered to pay a total
sanction of $1,845 (for 3 motions) within 30 days.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
