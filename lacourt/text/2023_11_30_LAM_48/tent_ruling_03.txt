  CASE NO.: 21STCV25928
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER DENYING MOTIONS TO BE RELIEVED
  AS COUNSEL
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
November 30, 2023



 
Whitney
Ackerman, Arpa Rostami, and Zhana Azizz, counsel of record for Plaintiffs Simon
Cvijanovic and Marjan Fathi, seek to be relieved as counsel.  Counsel’s declaration states that the
clients and counsel are at an impasse as to how to proceed on the matter, which
has created a breakdown between Plaintiffs and counsel.  No party opposed the motion.
Absent
a showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney’s request for withdrawal should be
granted.  (People v. Prince (1968)
268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406.)  Counsel’s motions
comply with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, and no prejudice is shown.
The
Form MC-053 proposed orders do not contain any of the required information.  Because the proposed orders are completely defective,
the Court’s tentative ruling is to deny the motions without prejudice.  If counsel provides amended and complete Form
MC-053 proposed orders at or before the hearing, the Court will reconsider its tentative.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
