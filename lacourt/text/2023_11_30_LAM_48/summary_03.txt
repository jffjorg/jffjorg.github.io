And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Thomas D. Long denying the motions of counsel Whitney Ackerman, Arpa Rostami, and Zhana Azizz to be relieved as counsel for the plaintiffs, Simon Cvijanovic and Marjan Fathi. The motions were uncontested, and the court found that the counsel's request to withdraw complies with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, and no prejudice is shown. However, the court's tentative ruling is to deny the motions without prejudice due to the defective proposed orders submitted by counsel. The court will reconsider its tentative ruling if counsel provides amended and complete proposed orders at or before the hearing.
