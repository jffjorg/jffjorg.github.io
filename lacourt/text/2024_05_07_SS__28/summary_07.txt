And here is the English-text summary:

The court hereby rules on the plaintiff's request for a default judgment. The plaintiff, Carmen Erazo, filed the complaint on January 4, 2023, and served the summons and complaint on the defendant, Justin Brown, on July 17, 2023. The defendant defaulted on October 26, 2023. The plaintiff is seeking $19,988.53 in damages, consisting of $10,000.00 in general damages, $9,190.00 in special damages, and $798.53 in costs. The court notes that the plaintiff's CIV-100 form requests inconsistent cost amounts and lacks essential information. The court also requests that the plaintiff submit a copy of the statement of damages served on the defendant. The court denies the plaintiff's application for default judgment without prejudice and orders the plaintiff to give notice of this ruling.
