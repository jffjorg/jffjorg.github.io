And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

"The Court has reviewed the motion for relief from judgment of costs and finds that the original judge, Judge Hiroshige, is not unavailable and lacks authority to second-guess the original judge's rulings. Therefore, the Court denies the motion and affirms the original judge's award of costs to the Defendant. The Court orders the moving party to give notice of this ruling and to file the proof of service within five days."
