PARTIES’ REQUESTS 
Defendant

Plaintiff
asks the Court to deny the motion or, in the alternative, limit a second
session to 45 minutes.  Plaintiff also asks
the Court to impose monetary sanctions on Defendant. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
          Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.610 provides: 
“(a) Once any party has taken the deposition of any
natural person, including that of a party to the action, neither the party who
gave, nor any other party who has been served with a deposition notice pursuant
to Section 2025.240 may take a subsequent deposition of that deponent. 
“(b) Notwithstanding subdivision (a), for good cause
shown, the court may grant leave to take a subsequent deposition, and the
parties, with the consent of any deponent who is not a party, may stipulate
that a subsequent deposition be taken. 
“(c) This section does not preclude taking one
subsequent deposition of a natural person who has previously been examined
under either or both of the following circumstances: 
“(1) The person was examined as a result of that
person’s designation to testify on behalf of an organization under Section
2025.230. 
“(2) The person was examined pursuant to a court order
under Section 485.230, for the limited purpose of discovering pursuant to
Section 485.230 the identity, location, and value of property in which the
deponent has an interest. 
“(d) This section does not authorize the taking of
more than one subsequent deposition for the limited purpose of Section 485.230.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.610.) 
DISCUSSION 
          On May 16, 2023, Defendant took the first session of
Plaintiff’s deposition.  At the suggestion
of Plaintiff’s counsel, the deposition began at 11:00 a.m.  Less than one hour before the deposition was scheduled
to begin, Plaintiff’s counsel informed Defendant’s counsel that the deposition
needed to end by 1:00 p.m. due to Plaintiff’s work schedule.  Plaintiff’s counsel agreed to produce
Plaintiff for a second session of the deposition at a mutually agreeable date
and time.  Defendant’s counsel estimated
the second session would last between 30 and 45 minutes. 
On
June 15, 2023, Defendant’s counsel requested dates for a second deposition
session. Plaintiff’s counsel did not respond. 
Plaintiff’s counsel “never agreed to any of the dates for the second
session that defense counsel proposed . . . .” 
(Opposition p. 5.) 
On
January 26, 2024, Defendant noticed Plaintiff’s second deposition session for
February 12, 2024.  On January 29, 2024, Plaintiff
served an objection stating that too much time had passed since the first
deposition. Counsel met and conferred without success.  Defendant then filed this motion to compel Plaintiff to attend the second session of his deposition as his counsel had promised. 
Citing
Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.480, subdivision (b), Plaintiff argues
that Defendant’s motion is untimely because Defendant filed it more than 60
days after the first session of Plaintiff’s deposition. 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2025.480 does not apply here.  The statute provides that, when “a deponent
fails to answer any question or to produce any document, electronically stored
information, or tangible thing under the deponent’s control that is specified
in the deposition notice or a deposition subpoena, the party seeking discovery
may move the court for an order compelling that answer or production.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.480, subd. (a).)  Here, Plaintiff did not fail to
answer a question or to produce a document. 
Instead, the parties agreed to resume the deposition on a later
date to accommodate Plaintiff's work schedule.  When Plaintiff refused to honor
his agreement, Defendant properly moved to compel the remainder of Plaintiff’s
deposition under Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.610, which does not
include a time limit.  
          Defendant asks the Court to award monetary sanctions.  Defendant’s motion was based on Code of Civil
Procedure section 2025.610, which does not include a provision authorizing sanctions.  Although Defendant cites several other
statutes to support its sanctions request, none of them authorize the sanctions
Defendant seeks here: 
·       Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010 is “
‘definitional’ and monetary sanctions may not be imposed based solely on [the
statute].  Monetary sanctions may be
imposed only if authorized by some other provision of the Discovery Act.”  (L. Edmon & C. Karnow, Cal. Practice
Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶ 8:1900, p. 8M-2; see Code
Civ. Proc., § 2023.030 [court may impose sanctions for misuse of the discovery
process “[t]o the extent authorized by the chapter governing any particular
discovery method or other provision of this title”]; City of Los Angeles v.
PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLC (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 466, 498-504, review
granted Jan. 23, 2023 with order permitting citation of opinion for its
persuasive value and to establish the existence of a conflict in authority that
would “allow trial courts to exercise discretion . . . to choose between sides
of any such conflict.”)  
·       Code of Civil Procedure section 1987.2: applies to
motions brought under Code of Civil Procedure sections 1987, subdivision (c),
and 1987.1
·       Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.480: Defendant
argues, and the Court has found, this statute does not apply here (see above).
·       Code of Civil Procedure section 2020.240: addresses deponent’s
failure to comply with a deposition subpoena 
The
Court denies Defendant’s request for sanctions. 
The Court also denies Plaintiff’s request for sanctions. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court GRANTS Defendant Target Corporation’s motion to compel Plaintiff William
Reynolds’s attendance at a second session of his deposition.  Defendant may schedule the second session of
Plaintiff’s deposition on a date within 30 days of the hearing on the motion.  The total length of the deposition, including
the time spent at the first session, may not exceed 7 hours. 
The
Court DENIES Defendant Target Corporation’s request for sanctions. 
The
Court DENIES Plaintiff William Reynolds’s request for sanctions. 
Moving
