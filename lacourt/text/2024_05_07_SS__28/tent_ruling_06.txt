LEGAL STANDARD 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 1987.1 provides: 
"(a) If a subpoena requires the attendance of a
witness or the production of books, documents, electronically stored
information, or other things before a court, or at the trial of an issue
therein, or at the taking of a deposition, the court, upon motion reasonably
made by any person described in subdivision (b), or upon the court’s own motion
after giving counsel notice and an opportunity to be heard, may make an order
quashing the subpoena entirely, modifying it, or directing compliance with it upon
those terms or conditions as the court shall declare, including protective
orders. In addition, the court may make any other order as may be appropriate
to protect the person from unreasonable or oppressive demands, including
unreasonable violations of the right of privacy of the person. 
"(b) The following persons may make a motion
pursuant to subdivision (a): (1) A party. (2) A witness. (3) A consumer
described in Section 1985.3. (4) An employee described in Section 1985.6. (5) A
person whose personally identifying information, as defined in subdivision (b)
of Section 1798.79.8 of the Civil Code, is sought in connection with an
underlying action involving that person’s exercise of free speech rights." 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1987.1.) 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 1985.3, subdivision (g), provides in part: 
“(g)  Any
consumer whose personal records are sought by a subpoena duces tecum and who is
a party to the civil action in which this subpoena duces tecum is served may,
prior to the date for production, bring a motion under Section 1987.1 to quash
or modify the subpoena duces tecum. Notice of the bringing of that motion shall
be given to the witness and deposition officer at least five days prior to
production. The failure to provide notice to the deposition officer shall not
invalidate the motion to quash or modify the subpoena duces tecum but may be
raised by the deposition officer as an affirmative defense in any action for
liability for improper release of records. 
* * *
 “No witness or deposition officer shall be required to
produce personal records after receipt of notice that the motion has been
brought by a consumer . . . except upon order of the court in which the action
is pending or by agreement of the parties, witnesses, and consumers affected. .
. .” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1985.3,
subd. (g).) 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 1987.2, subdivision (a), provides: 
“(a) Except as specified in subdivision (c), in making
an order pursuant to motion made under subdivision (c) of Section 1987 or under
Section 1987.1, the court may in its discretion award the amount of the
reasonable expenses incurred in making or opposing the motion, including
reasonable attorney’s fees, if the court finds the motion was made or opposed
in bad faith or without substantial justification or that one or more of the
requirements of the subpoena was oppressive.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1987.2,
subd. (a).) 
When
a party seeks discovery which impacts a person’s constitutional right to
privacy, limited protections come into play. (Shaffer v. Superior Court (1995)
33 Cal.App.4th 993, 999.) The protections cover a person’s personal and
financial matters. (Ibid.) The court must balance competing rights — the
litigant’s right to discover relevant facts and the individual’s right to
maintain reasonable privacy — in determining whether the information is
discoverable. (Ibid.) 
For
discovery purposes, information is relevant if it might reasonably assist a
party in evaluating the case, preparing for trial, or facilitating settlement.
(Gonzalez v. Superior Court (1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 1539, 1546.) 
DISCUSSION 
A.   The complaint 
The
complaint alleges the following: 
On
January 27, 2021, Defendants negligently owned, operated and maintained the
premises at 2335 Wall Street, Los Angeles, apartment number 105, creating a
dangerous condition.  Defendants created
the condition by failing to inspect, remedy, or warn against a defective
ceiling which fell on Plaintiff. Defendants knew or should have known about the
dangerous condition. 
B.   The subpoenas for business records 
On February 27, 2024, Plaintiff served deposition
subpoenas for production of business records on the Los Angeles Department of
Building and Safety, the Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles, and the
Los Angeles Housing Department (collectively, “deponents”). 
The
subpoenas requested: 
1.
All documents related to any visits made by [one or more deponents] to 2335
Wall Street, Los Angeles, California 90011 for any reason between January 1,
2006 and the present. 2.
All documents related to any citations issued by [one
or more deponents] to 2335 Wall Street, Los Angeles, California 90011 for
any reason between January 1, 2006 and the present.
3.
All documents related to any building code violations issued by [one or more
deponents] to 2335 Wall Street, Los Angeles, California 90011 for any reason
between January 1, 2006 and the present. 
4.
All documents related to any water leaks identified by [one or more deponents] at
2335 Wall Street, Los Angeles, California 90011 between January 1, 2006 and the

1, 2006 and the present. 
7.
All documents related to any complaints made by any person regarding living
conditions or possible code violations to [one or more deponents] at 2335 Wall
Street, Los Angeles, California 90011 between January 1, 2006 and the present. 
8.
All documents related to any investigation of the living conditions or possible
code violations by [one or more deponents] at 2335 Wall Street, Los Angeles,
California 90011 between January 1, 2006 and the present. 
9.
All photographs or video footage taken by [one or more deponents] of 2335 Wall
Street, Los Angeles, California 90011 between January 1, 2006 and the present. 
10.
All documents related to any fines levied against 2335 Wall Street, Los
Angeles, California 90011 for any building code violations or citations issued
by [one or more deponents] between January 1, 2006 and the present. 
C.   Legal issues 
555
Holdings LLC argues that (1) the subpoenas are overbroad, unlimited in time,
and unduly burdensome, (2) they seek documents that are not relevant or
reasonably calculated to lead to the production of admissible evidence, and (3)
they invade the privacy of 555 Holdings LLC and non-party tenants.  According to 555 Holdings LLC, “[t]his case
concerns a single incident of a water leak causing a piece of ceiling plaster
to fall in Unit 105 sometime in 2021 or 2022. . . . It has nothing to do with
other issues of habitability, all tenants’ complaints, construction defects,
living conditions, fines, etc., dating back to 2006.”  (Motion p. 5.) 
In
response, Plaintiff asserts that Jerry Dandridge, the tenant in unit 105 for
whom Plaintiff provided caregiving services, stated in a declaration that (1)
he complained to representatives of 555 Holdings LLC on several occasions about
a water leak and issues in his unit and (2) representatives of the city inspected
the property at least once before the incident. 
Because Dandridge did not know which agency visited the property,
Plaintiff issued subpoenas to the three city agencies that might have conducted
the inspections. 
Plaintiff
also disputes 555 Holdings LLC’s assertion that discovery should be limited to
a single water leak.  Plaintiff points
out that the source or cause of a water leak may exist in a different location
from where the leak is discovered and may cause additional problems that affect
the building’s integrity. 
555
Holdings LLC has not shown why, at this stage of the case, the Court should
limit Plaintiff’s ability to conduct discovery based on 555 Holdings LLC’s narrow
view of the scope of the case.   The
Court concludes that the subpoenas are not overbroad but rather seek documents
that are reasonably calculated to lead to the production of admissible
evidence. 
Plaintiff
also contends that 555 Holdings LLC, as a corporate entity, may not assert
privacy rights.  Even assuming for the
sake of argument that 555 Holdings LLC has a right to privacy and has standing
to assert the privacy rights of non-party tenants, 555 Holdings LLC has not
shown that the subpoenas violate these privacy rights.  “The burden is on ‘the party asserting a
privacy interest to establish its extent and the seriousness of the prospective
invasion,’ and then the court must ‘weigh the countervailing interests the
opposing party identifies.’ ”  (L. Edmon
& C. Karnow, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter
2023) ¶ 8:294, p. 8C-98.)  555 Holdings
LLC has not carried this burden because it does not address the extent or seriousness
of the prospective invasion of the privacy rights it asserts. 
The
Court denies the motion. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES Defendant 555 Holdings LLC’s motion to quash Plaintiff Yolanda
Amador’s deposition subpoenas for production of business records served on the
Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety, the Housing Authority of the
City of Los Angeles, and the Los Angeles Housing Department on February 27,
2024. 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
