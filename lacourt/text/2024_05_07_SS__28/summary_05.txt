Here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

This tentative ruling grants Uber Technologies, Inc.'s motion to seal its unredacted motion for determination of good faith settlement and corresponding confidential documents. The Court finds that there exists an overriding interest in enabling the parties to settle this case, which overcomes the right of public access to the record. The settlement agreement between Plaintiff Alexander Pou and Uber contains a confidentiality clause, and failure to seal the requested settlement information would result in the disclosure of private, sensitive information. The Court grants the motion to seal and orders the moving party to give notice of this ruling.
