  Case Number:  19STCV02984    Hearing Date:   May 7, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers, the Court rules as
follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On
January 29, 2019, Plaintiff David Weinberger (“Plaintiff”) filed this action
against Defendants Jacob Lawrence Kaster (“Defendant”) and Does 1-5 for motor
vehicle tort. 
On
April 16, 2019, Defendant filed an answer. 
On
July 21, 2022, the case was assigned to the Hon. Ernest M. Hiroshige in
Department 70 of the Metropolitan Courthouse for trial.  On August 25, 2022, after a jury trial, Judge
Hiroshige entered judgment for Defendant and ordered Plaintiff to pay Defendant’s
costs. 
On
September 14, 2023, Judge Hiroshige denied Plaintiff’s motion to strike
costs and awarded Defendant
$106,770.46 in costs. 
The September 14, 2023 minute order stated: “The Court finds the
Plaintiff's contention regarding the Memorandum of Costs (Summary) was a draft
is unreasonable and not persuasive since the Memorandum of Costs (Summary) is
83 pages in length and the last page is the Declaration of Service dated February
21, 2023; therefore the Memorandum of Costs (Summary) is authentic and started
the time for filing of a Motion to Strike or Motion to Tax Costs.” 
On
October 2, 2023, the case was reassigned to Department
28 of the Spring Street Courthouse. 
On
April 3, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion for relief from judgment of costs, to
be heard in Department 28 of the Spring Street Courthouse on May 7, 2024. On April 9, 2024, Defendant filed an opposition. On
April 19, 2024, Plaintiff filed a reply. 
PARTIES’ REQUESTS 
Plaintiff
asks the Court to set aside the cost award. 
Defendant
asks the Court to deny the request. 
DISCUSSION 
Plaintiff
asks the Court for relief from the cost award because (1) Plaintiff is
experiencing financial hardship, (2) the Court entered the award as the result
of mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect under Code of Civil
Procedure section 473, (3) Defendant did not timely file a memorandum of costs,
and (4) the trial court prejudicially erred in admitting evidence at trial. 
“As
a general rule, a trial judge cannot overturn the order of another trial judge.”
(Paul Blanco’s Good Car Company Auto Group v. Superior Court (2020) 56
Cal.App.5th 86, 99 (Paul Blanco’s).) 
This long-standing principle “ ‘is founded on the inherent difference
between a judge and a court and is designed to ensure the orderly
administration of justice.’ ” (Ibid.) “Because a superior court is a
single entity comprised of member judges, “ ‘ “one member of that court cannot
sit in review on the actions of another member of that same court.” ’ ” (Ibid.) 
“ ‘For
one superior court judge, no matter how well intended, even if correct as a
matter of law, to nullify a duly made, erroneous ruling of another superior
court judge places the second judge in the role of a one-judge appellate court,’
” and “ ‘ “it would be only a matter of days until we would have a rule of [person] rather than a rule of law.” ’ ” (Paul Blanco’s, supra,
56 Cal.App.5th at pp. 99-100.)  “Furthermore,
to countenance such a practice would lead to judge-shopping—venturing from
judge to judge until a favorable ruling is obtained—which ‘ “would instantly
breed lack of confidence in the integrity of the courts.” ’ ” (Id. at p.
100.) 
“A
narrow exception to this venerable rule applies when the record shows that the
original judge is no longer ‘available.’ ” (Paul Blanco’s, supra,
56 Cal.App.5th at p. 100, quoting Davcon, Inc. v. Roberts & Morgan
(2003) 110 Cal.App.4th 1355, 1361.) “The unavailability of the original judge
is established if, for example, the judge has retired.”  (Ibid.) “Unavailability is not
demonstrated, however, by the mere fact that the original judge was transferred
to another department of the same court.” 
(Ibid. [judge was not unavailable when case was transferred to
another judge’s department but original judge remained listed as a judge on
superior court’s website].) 
Here,
the case was transferred out of Judge Hiroshige’s department because the trial
proceedings were completed.  However,
Judge Hiroshige remains listed as a judge on the superior court’s website.  This Court lacks authority to second-guess Judge Hiroshige's rulings.
 The
Court denies the motion. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES Plaintiff David Weinberger’s motion for relief from the cost award. 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
