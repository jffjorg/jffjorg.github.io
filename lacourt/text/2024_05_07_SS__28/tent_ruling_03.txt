          On

request for production of documents (set one), special interrogatories (set one),
and form interrogatories (set one).  The
motions were set for hearing on May 7, 2024. 
Alvarez did not file oppositions.
The trial is currently
set for September 23, 2024. 
PARTY’S REQUESTS 
          The City
asks the Court to compel Alvarez’s responses to the City’s request
for production of documents (set one), special interrogatories (set one), and
form interrogatories (set one). 
LEGAL STANDARD 
A.   Inspection demand 
Code of Civil Procedure
section 2031.300 provides: 
“If
a party to whom a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is
directed fails to serve a timely response to it, the following rules shall
apply: 
“(a)
The party to whom the demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is
directed waives any objection to the demand, including one based on privilege
or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section
2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its
determination that both of the following conditions are satisfied: 
“(1)
The party has subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance
with Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230, 2031.240, and 2031.280. 
“(2)
The party’s failure to serve a timely response was the result of mistake,
inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b)
The party making the demand may move for an order compelling response to the
demand. 
“(c)
Except as provided in subdivision (d), the court shall impose a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party,
person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a
response to a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling, unless it
finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification
or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. If a
party then fails to obey the order compelling a response, the court may make
those orders that are just, including the imposition of an issue sanction, an
evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in addition to this sanction, the court may
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). 
“(d)
(1) Notwithstanding subdivision (c), absent exceptional circumstances, the
court shall not impose sanctions on a party or any attorney of a party for
failure to provide electronically stored information that has been lost,
damaged, altered, or overwritten as a result of the routine, good faith
operation of an electronic information system. 
“(2)
This subdivision shall not be construed to alter any obligation to preserve
discoverable information.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300.) 
B.   Interrogatories 
Code of Civil Procedure
section 2030.290 provides: 
“If
a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely response,
the following rules apply: 
“(a)
The party to whom the interrogatories are directed waives any right to exercise
the option to produce writings under Section 2030.230, as well as any objection
to the interrogatories, including one based on privilege or on the protection
for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010). The court,
on motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its determination that
both of the following conditions are satisfied: 
“(1)
The party has subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance
with Sections 2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, and 2030.240. 
“(2)
The party’s failure to serve a timely response was the result of mistake,
inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b)
The party propounding the interrogatories may move for an order compelling
response to the interrogatories. 
“(c)
The court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully
makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to interrogatories, unless it
finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification
or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. If a
party then fails to obey an order compelling answers, the court may make those
orders that are just, including the imposition of an issue sanction, an
evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in addition to that sanction, the court may
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010).”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290.)   
DISCUSSION 
On December 18, 2023, the
City served a request for production of documents (set one), special
interrogatories (set one), and form interrogatories (set one), on Alvarez.
          Alvarez
did not provide timely responses and had not provided responses by the time the
City filed these motions.
The Court grants the City’s
motion to compel Alvarez’s responses to the request for production of documents
and orders Alvarez to provide verified code-compliant responses without
objections and to produce the documents, electronically stored information,
and/or other things requested without objections by June 6, 2024. 
The Court grants the
City’s motions to compel Alvarez’s responses to the special and form interrogatories
and orders Alvarez to provide verified code-compliant responses to the interrogatories without
objections by June 6, 2024.
The City requests
monetary sanctions.  Under
Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.290 and 2031.300, sanctions are available
against parties, persons, and attorneys who unsuccessfully make or oppose a
motion to compel a response to interrogatories or a request for production of documents.  (See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (c), 2031.300, subd. (c).)  Alvarez did not make or oppose a motion to
compel responses to interrogatories or a request for production of documents. Therefore,
sanctions are not available under these statutes. Other statutes addressing
misuse of the discovery process do not, by themselves, authorize a sanctions
award for these motions.  (See Code Civ.
Proc, § 2023.010.)  Code of Civil Procedure
section 2023.010 is “ ‘definitional’ and monetary sanctions may not be imposed
based solely on [the statute].  Monetary
sanctions may be imposed only if authorized by some other provision of the
Discovery Act.”  (L. Edmon & C.
Karnow, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶
8:1900, p. 8M-2; see Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030 [court may impose sanctions
for misuse of the discovery process “[t]o the extent authorized by the chapter
governing any particular discovery method or other provision of this title”]; City
of Los Angeles v. PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLC (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 466,
498-504, review granted Jan. 23, 2023 with order permitting citation of opinion
for its persuasive value and to establish the existence of a conflict in
authority that would “allow trial courts to exercise discretion . . . to choose
between sides of any such conflict.”) 
California Rules of
Court, rule 3.1348(a), provides: “The court may award sanctions under the
Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even
though no opposition to the motion was filed . . . .”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 1348(a).)  “ ‘Rules of court have the force of law and
are as binding as procedural statutes as long as they are not inconsistent with
statutory or constitutional law.’ ” (Fidelity National Home Warranty Company
Cases (2020) 46 Cal.App.5th 812, 842, fn. 41, quoting In re I.V.
(2017) 11 Cal.App.5th 249, 256.) 
Interpreting rule 3.1348(a) to authorize an award of sanctions here would
be inconsistent with Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.290 and 2031.300. The Court denies the
sanctions requests.
CONCLUSION 
The Court GRANTS Defendant
and Cross-Defendant City of Los Angeles’s motion to compel responses to its request
for production of documents (set one) and orders Defendant and

objections by June 6, 2024.
