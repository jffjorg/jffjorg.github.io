  Interrogatories Against Ara Tovmassian, and Request for Monetary Sanctions

I. Background
A. Pleadings
Plaintiff Jonathan
Neil & Associates, Inc. sues Defendants Healing Hands Care, Inc., a
California Corporation, Ara Tovmassian aka Ara Mesrop Tovmassian, and Does 1
through 50 pursuant to an August 28, 2023, Complaint alleging ten breach of
contract claims.
B. Motion Before the
Court
On January 2, 2024, Plaintiff
served Form Interrogatories – General, Set No. One (FROGs, Set One), on
Defendant Tovmassian. Responses to FROGS, Set One, were due on February 6, 2024,
35 days after service by mail on January 2, 2024.
Defendant Tovmassian
failed to serve responses to FROGs, Set One, by February 6, 2024.
On March 22, 2024,
based on Defendant Tovmassian’s non-response to FROGs, Set One, Plaintiff filed
a motion to compel initial responses to FROGs, Set One, from Defendant
Tovmassian. Plaintiff’s motion also requests monetary sanctions in the amount
of $850 against Defendant Tovmassian. Plaintiff served the motion on Defendant
Tovmassian by mail that same day.
Defendant Tovmassian
has failed to oppose Plaintiff’s motion despite service.
Plaintiff’s motion is
now before the Court.
 
II. Motion to Compel Initial Responses
to Interrogatories and Request for Sanctions
A.
Motion to Compel Initial Responses to Interrogatories

1. Legal
Standard
A motion to compel an initial
response can be made on the ground that a party did not serve a timely response
to interrogatories. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a); see Sinaiko Healthcare
Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th
390, 404 (Sinaiko).) To establish this ground, a movant must show:
(1) Proper service (see Code Civ.
Proc., § 2030.080, subd. (a));
(2) Expiration of the deadline for
the initial response 30 days after service or on date agreed to by parties (see
Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subds. (a), (b)); and
(3) No timely response (see Code
Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290).
A court must deny a motion to
compel initial discovery where the discovery sought is outside the scope of
discovery. (See CBS, Inc. v. Superior Court (1968) 263 Cal.App.2d 12, 19
(CBS); see also Code. Civ. Proc., § 2017.010 [scope of discovery].) 
2. Court’s
Determination
Plaintiff shows evidence of service
of FROGs, Set One, on Defendant Tovmassian. (Mot., Minassian Decl., ¶¶ 2-3,
Exs. 1-2.)
Plaintiff shows evidence that the
expiration to respond to FROGs, Set One, has passed. (Mot., Minassian Decl., ¶
3.)
Plaintiff shows evidence that
Defendant Tovmassian has failed to file responses to FROGs, Set One. (Mot.,
Minassian Decl., ¶ 4.)
A review of FROGs, Set One, shows
that they request information within the proper scope of discovery for this
action, particularly where the FROGs at issue involve prepopulated questions
set out in a Judicial Council form.
Plaintiff’s motion is thus GRANTED
as to compelling initial responses to FROGs, Set One, from Defendant
Tovmassian.
B. Request for Sanctions
1. Legal
Standard
The Court must impose monetary
sanctions against anyone—party, nonparty, or attorney—who unsuccessfully makes
or opposes the motion, unless it finds that the person to be sanctioned acted
with substantial justification or other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanctions unjust. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (c); see Sinaiko,
supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at p. 404.)
The court may award sanctions under
the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery,
even though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion
was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after
the motion was filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1348, subd. (a).)
2. Court’s
Determination
Here, the Court finds that
Plaintiff is entitled to sanctions.
Despite not opposing this motion,
Defendant Tovmassian has failed to respond to an authorized method of discovery
in FROGs, Set One, thus justifying sanctions. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010,
subd. (d); Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1348, subd. (a).)
The Court also finds that the
sanctions of $850 are eminently reasonable as comprised of a reasonable fee
rate of $395 per hour, two hours reasonably expended on this motion, and a $60
motion filing fee. (Mot., Minassian Decl., ¶ 5.)
Sanctions are thus GRANTED in the
amount of $850.
 
III. Conclusion
Plaintiff Jonathan Neil & Associates, Inc.’s Motion to Compel Responses
to Form Interrogatories Against Ara Tovmassian, and Request for Monetary
Sanctions Against Defendant Ara Tovmassian in the Amount of $850.00 is GRANTED.
Defendant Ara Tovmassian is (1) ORDERED to
provide responses, without objections (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a)),
to Form Interrogatories – General, Set No. One, within 14 days of this ruling,
and (2) ORDERED to remit sanctions of $850 within 14 days of this ruling.
