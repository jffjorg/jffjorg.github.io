And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Cathay Bank's application for a writ of possession against Raidcom Technology Inc. and Chi Chun Lin. Cathay Bank is seeking to obtain immediate possession of Raidcom's assets, which are valued at $610,532.82. The court finds that Cathay Bank has followed the statutory requirements for obtaining a writ of possession and has demonstrated a right to immediate possession of the collateral at issue. Raidcom and Lin failed to oppose the application, and therefore, their undertaking taking requirement is waived. The writ of possession is granted, and Cathay Bank is ordered to turn over the collateral described in Attachment 1 of its application. Failure to comply with this order may result in the defendants being held in contempt of court.
