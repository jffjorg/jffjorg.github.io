And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that Defendant Kyle Dou's demurrer to the Complaint is summarily STRICKEN and placed off calendar. This decision is based on the fact that Dou is in default, having failed to timely file a responsive pleading to the Complaint. The Plaintiffs, Zenith Technology Inc. and Zhaohui Wang, filed a complaint against Dou and others, alleging breaches of contract, conversion, unfair business practices, and other causes of action. The Complaint arises from a stock purchase agreement between the parties, in which Dou's company, Hixih Rubber Industry Group, Ltd., sold 38,250 common stock shares to Zenith for $500,000 in cash and other considerations. The Judge's ruling is based on the principle that a defaulted defendant has no standing to file responsive pleadings, as stated in Forbes v. Cameron Petroleums, Inc. (1978) 83 Cal.App.3d 257, 262.
