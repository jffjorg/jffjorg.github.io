 Case Number:  23PSCV03340    Hearing Date:   February 13, 2024    Dept:  G Defendant Kyle Dou’s Demurrer to Complaint
Respondent: Plaintiffs Zenith
Technology Inc. and Zhaohui Wang
TENTATIVE RULING
Defendant Kyle Dou’s Demurrer to Complaint is
summarily STRICKEN and placed off calendar as Defendant Kyle Dou is in default.
BACKGROUND
This is an action for breach
of contract arising from a stock purchase agreement. In June 2023, Plaintiffs Zenith
Technology Inc. (Zenith) and Zhaohui Wang entered into a written agreement with
Defendant Kyle Dou in which Zenith purchased 38,250 common stock shares from
Dou’s company, Hixih Rubber Industry Group, Ltd. (Hixih). In exchange, Zenith
agreed to pay $500,000 in cash, assume $230,000 in outstanding debt owed by
Hixih, and issue 3,187,541 shares of Zenith’s stock to Dou. Subsequently,
Zenith and Wang allege they discovered Hixih owed additional debts that were
not disclosed. They also allege they discovered that Dou had used company funds
to go on vacations and purchase an expensive watch.
On October 27, 2023, Zenith
and Wang filed a complaint against Dou and Does 1-20, alleging the following
causes of action: (1) breach of contract, (2) conversion, (3) unfair business
practices, (4) breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and
(5) unjust enrichment. On November 14, Zenith and Wang’s process server served
Dou with substitute service in Los Angeles.
On January 3, 2024, default
was entered against Dou. On January 11, Dou filed the present motion. A hearing
on Dou’s motion is set for February 13 with a case management conference on
April 2.
ANALYSIS
Dou
demurs to Zenith and Wang’s entire Complaint. For the following reasons, the
court STRIKES Dou’s demurrer and places it off calendar.
While
Dou filed the demurrer on January 11, 2024, Dou was already found to be in
default on January 3 after failing to timely file a responsive pleading to
Zenith and Wang’s Complaint.
Because
a defaulted defendant has no standing to file responsive pleadings, Dou’s
demurrer is summarily STRICKEN and removed from the court’s calendar. (See
Forbes v. Cameron Petroleums, Inc. (1978) 83 Cal.App.3d 257, 262.)
