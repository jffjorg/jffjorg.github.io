And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment. The case involves a personal injury action arising from a motor vehicle collision on State Route 60 in Diamond Bar. The defendants, Jesus Alvarez and Carmen Alvarez, move for summary judgment on the grounds that Jesus Alvarez did not operate a motor vehicle negligently and was not the cause of the plaintiffs' injuries. The court finds that the undisputed material facts show that Jesus Alvarez did not cause the plaintiffs' injuries, and that the plaintiffs have failed to establish the existence of a triable issue of fact regarding Jesus Alvarez's negligence and causation. As a result, the defendants are entitled to summary judgment on the plaintiffs' claims for motor vehicle negligence, general negligence, negligent entrustment, and loss of consortium.
