And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge grants the defendant's motion to compel the plaintiff to permit forensic inspection of electronic devices in her possession, custody, or control since July 8, 2021. The defendant may instruct the third-party to conduct searches limited to the search terms proposed by the defendant on March 29, 2024. The judge also denies the defendant's request for sanctions. The judge finds that the plaintiff's opposition to the motion is substantially justified, citing the lack of clarity and neutrality in the agreements made during the meet and confer process. The judge also notes that the defendant only provided search terms after filing the motion.
