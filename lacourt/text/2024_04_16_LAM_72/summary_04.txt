The cross-complaint arises from the same transaction as the original complaint and alleges that Hakala and Rindels formed a partnership in 2017 to procure and sell marijuana and CBD isolate. The allegations include that Hakala facilitated the initial filing with the California Secretary of State in 2018 and that Rindels signed a statement of information for Prestige, listing herself as the Managing Member. The Judge finds that the allegations in the cross-complaint arise from the same transaction as the original complaint and that joinder of Cross-Defendants is permissible.
