And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Pacific Green, LLC, et al. v. Paul Fiore, et al. The case involves a dispute over a cannabis investment project that went awry. The Plaintiffs, Pacific Green, LLC and Big Tree Holdings, LLC, allege that the Defendants, including Paul Fiore, One Eleven Advisors, LLC, and others, made fraudulent misrepresentations and concealed material facts about the business. The Plaintiffs further allege that the Defendants breached their contracts and fiduciary duties.

The Court has overruled the demurrer to the first, second, and fourth claims, but sustained the demurrer to the remaining claims without leave to amend. The Court has given the Plaintiffs an opportunity to amend their complaint to seek damages for the alleged fraud and breach of contract.

The Court has also noted that the Plaintiffs have not adequately pleaded the conversion claim as to some of the Defendants, and has given them leave to amend. The Court has sustained the demurrer to the aiding and abetting torts claim with leave to amend.

The Court has granted the parties’ requests for judicial notice and will consider the demurrers together. The Court will hear further argument on the demurrers at the hearing scheduled for April 16, 2024.
