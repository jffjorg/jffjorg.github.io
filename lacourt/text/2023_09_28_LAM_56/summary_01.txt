## English Text Summary

Judge Holly J. Fujie issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by defendant Joe Bartolome. The judge found that the plaintiff's complaint, which alleges negligence and breach of fiduciary duty, is insufficiently clear and does not adequately state the elements of either cause of action. 

Specifically, the complaint fails to clearly establish the existence of an attorney-client relationship, which is essential for the breach of fiduciary duty claim. Additionally, the complaint is vague regarding the specific facts supporting the allegations of negligence and breach of contract.

The judge sustained the demurrer to both causes of action, giving the plaintiff 20 days to amend the complaint to address these deficiencies.
