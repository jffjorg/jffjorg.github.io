And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling is for a demurrer filed by the defendant, Joe Bartolome, against the plaintiff, Steeve Choe. The plaintiff's complaint alleges negligence, breach of fiduciary duty, and emotional distress. The defendant argues that the complaint fails to state sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action and is uncertain. The court agrees that the complaint is ambiguous and fails to allege a basis for relief. The court sustains the demurrer to both the first and second causes of action with 20 days leave to amend. The court orders the defendant to give notice of this ruling and instructs the parties who intend to submit on this tentative to send an email to the court.
