MOVING
PARTY: Defendant Joe Bartolome (“Moving Defendant”)
 
RESPONDING
PARTY: Plaintiff
            
            The Court has considered the moving
and opposition papers.  No reply papers
were filed.  Any reply papers were
required to have been filed and served at least five court days before the
hearing under California Code of Civil Procedure section 1005,
subdivision (b).  
 
BACKGROUND
Plaintiff’s
complaint (the “Complaint”) alleges: (1) negligence; and (2) breach of
fiduciary duty and emotional distress. 
 
 
In
relevant part, the Complaint alleges: within the past three years, Plaintiff
and Moving Defendant entered into a written agreement (the “Lease Agreement”)
for Plaintiff to lease equipment from Moving Defendant pursuant to a three-year
loan.  (Complaint ¶ 7.)  On around February 3, 2022, Plaintiff
informed Moving Defendant that he was not interested in extending the Lease
Agreement and that the Lease Agreement would expire on December 30, 2022.  (Complaint ¶ 8.)  During this period, monthly payments were withdrawn
from Plaintiff’s bank account.  (Id.)  Moving Defendant thereafter apparently
continued to withdraw monthly payments. 
(See Complaint ¶ 9.)
 
Moving
Defendant filed a demurrer (the “Demurrer”) on the grounds that the Complaint
fails to state sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action and is
uncertain. 
 
DISCUSSION
Meet and Confer
            The meet and confer requirement has been met.
 
Legal Standard
A
demurrer tests the sufficiency of a complaint as a matter of law.  (Durell
v. Sharp Healthcare (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 1350, 1358.)  The court accepts as true all material
factual allegations and affords them a liberal construction, but it does not
consider conclusions of fact or law, opinions, speculation, or allegations
contrary to law or judicially noticed facts. 
(Shea Homes Limited Partnership v.
County of Alameda (2003) 110 Cal.App.4th 1246, 1254.)  With respect to a demurrer, the complaint
must be construed liberally by drawing reasonable inferences from the facts
pleaded.  (Rodas v. Spiegel (2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 513, 517.)  A demurrer will be sustained without leave to
amend if there exists no reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by
amendment.  (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.)  
 
Demurrers for uncertainty are disfavored and are
granted only if the pleading is so incomprehensible that a defendant cannot
reasonably respond.  (Lickiss v.
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (2012) 208 Cal.App.4th 1125, 1135.)  A
demurrer for uncertainty is strictly construed, even where a complaint is in
some respects uncertain, because ambiguities can be clarified under modern
discovery procedures.  (Chen v.
Berenjian (2019) 33 Cal.App.5th 811, 822.)
 
First
Cause of Action
            The
elements of negligence are: (1) duty; (2) breach; (3) causation; and (4)
damages. (Peredia v. HR Mobile Services, Inc. (2018) 25 Cal.App.5th 680,
687.)  
 
The elements of a claim
for breach of contract are: (1) the contract; (2) the plaintiff’s performance
or excuse for nonperformance; (3) the defendant’s breach; and (4) damage to
plaintiff therefrom.  (Wall Street
Network, Ltd. v. New York Times Co. (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 1171,
1178.)  A plaintiff may plead the legal effect of the contract rather than its
precise language.  (Construction
Protective Services, Inc. v. TIG Specialty Insurance Co. (2002) 29 Cal.4th
189, 198-99.)  
 
            Although the case caption states
that the Complaint alleges negligence, the first cause of action is not
labelled and appears to be rooted in the alleged breach of the Lease
Agreement.  The allegations, however, do
not sufficiently allege the elements of either cause of action.  The Court therefore SUSTAINS the Demurrer to
the first cause of action with 20 days leave to amend. 
 
Second
Cause of Action
To state a cause of action for breach of fiduciary
duty, a plaintiff must allege: (1) the existence of a fiduciary relationship;
(2) breach of that relationship; and (3) damages.  (Shopoff & Cavallo LLP v. Hyon (2008)
167 Cal.App.4th 1489, 1509.)  
 
A fiduciary relationship is any relation existing
between parties to a transaction wherein one of the parties is in duty bound to
act with the utmost good faith for the benefit of the other party.  (Wolf v. Superior Court (2003) 107
Cal.App.4th 25, 29.)  Such a relation
ordinarily arises where a confidence is reposed by one person in the integrity
of another, and in such a relation the party in whom the confidence is reposed,
if he voluntarily accepts or assumes to accept the confidence, can take no
advantage from his acts relating to the interest of the other party without the
latter's knowledge or consent.  (Id.)  Before a person can be charged with a
fiduciary obligation, he must either knowingly undertake to act on behalf and
for the benefit of another or must enter into a relationship which imposes that
undertaking as a matter of law.  (Hasso
v. Hapke (2014) 227 Cal.App.4th 107, 140.) 

 
            
The
Complaint alleges that Moving Defendant owed Plaintiff a fiduciary duty as an
attorney, but it is not clear if Moving Defendant and Plaintiff were in an
attorney-client relationship.  The Court
agrees with Moving Defendant that the claim is ambiguous and fails to allege a
basis for relief.  The Court therefore
SUSTAINS the Demurrer to the second cause of action with 20 days leave to
amend. 
 
Moving party
is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
