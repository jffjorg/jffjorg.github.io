And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has rejected the demurrer filed by the defendant, Floreen Essa as Administrator of the Estate of Leonard Rasho, to the complaint filed by the plaintiff, Anita Abraham Rasho. The demurrer was filed on March 25, 2024, and the hearing was initially scheduled for May 24, 2024, but was continued to June 26, 2024 due to issues with service of the complaint and demurrer.

The judge found that the demurrer did not state a valid basis for dismissal, as the defendant failed to set forth any of the grounds specified in CCP 430.10. The demurrer also lacked a proper memorandum of points and authorities.

However, the judge also expressed concerns about the complaint filed by the plaintiff, stating that it is unclear what cause of action she is attempting to assert. The judge ordered the plaintiff to file a memorandum, limited to 10 pages, setting forth authority for a civil action on a rejected claim in a probate proceeding without asserting any underlying cause of action. The judge also set an Order to Show Cause Why the Complaint should not be stricken for failure to state a valid civil cause of action.
