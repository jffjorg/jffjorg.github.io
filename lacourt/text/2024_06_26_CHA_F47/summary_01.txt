And here is the English summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The defendant, William S. Hart Union High School District, has filed a motion to stay proceedings in this case pending the decisions of two matters currently before the California Court of Appeal regarding the constitutionality of California Assembly Bill 218 (AB 218). The bill allowed the plaintiff, John Doe, to bring this lawsuit in 2022, alleging that he was sexually abused by a junior high school teacher in the 1980s. The district contends that the lawsuit is unconstitutional and that any payments authorized by a public officer may be illegal.

The judge has denied the motion, finding that there is no guarantee that any decision by the appellate courts will be published or binding on this court, and that an indefinite stay would be warranted. The judge also notes that the district cannot state exactly when the appellate courts will render their decisions, and that a stay would be for an unknown or unstated length of time. The judge concludes that an indefinite stay of this separate action is not warranted, especially considering there is currently no conflict between courts of other jurisdictions.
