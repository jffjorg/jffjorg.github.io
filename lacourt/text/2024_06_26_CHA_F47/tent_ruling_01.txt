MOTION TO STAY
PROCEEDINGS
 
Motion filed on 4/26/24.  
 
MOVING PARTY: Defendant William S. Hart Union High School
District
RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff John Doe
NOTICE: ok
 
RELIEF REQUESTED: An order
staying proceedings in this matter pending the decisions of two matters
currently before the Court of Appeal regarding the constitutionality of
California Assembly Bill 218 (AB 218) which enacted the version of CCP 340.1 on
which Plaintiff bases this lawsuit.  
 

RULING: The motion is denied.
 
SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises from allegations that Plaintiff John
Doe (Plaintiff) was sexually abused in the 1980s by his junior high school
teacher, Defendant Marguerite Lagnado (Lagnado), an employee of Defendant
William S. Hart Union High School District (the District) at the time.
 
On 5/4/22, Plaintiff filed this action against the
District, Lagnado and Doe Defendants.  As
against the District, the operative First Amended Complaint contains causes of
action for Negligent Hiring, Supervision and Retention of Unfit Employee (3rd
cause of action), Breach of Mandatory Duty: Failure to Report Suspected Child
Abuse (4th cause of action), Negligent Supervision of a Minor (5th
cause of action), and Negligent Failure to Warn, Train or Educate (6th
cause of action).  
 
On 1/16/24, this Court denied the District’s motion for
judgment on the pleadings which was brought on the ground that this action was
unconstitutional pursuant to the “gift of public funds” doctrine.  The District contends that to the extent California
Assembly Bill 218 (AB 218) (which allowed Plaintiff to bring this action in
2022) retroactively eliminates government immunity from public entities, it
violates Article XVI, section 6 of the California Constitution, which prohibits
gifts of public funds.  (See
1/16/24 Minute Order).  
 
The District contends that this action cannot legally
proceed and that any payments authorized by a public officer, such as a public
school board member, may be illegal pursuant to Article XVI, section 6 of the
California Constitution and California Penal Code 424.
 
There are currently two cases pending before the California
Court of Appeal on the above issue: (1) West Contra Costa Unified School
District v. Superior Court (1st Appellate District, Case No.
A16934) and (2) Roe # 2 v. Superior Court (2nd Appellate
District, Div. 6, Case No. B334707).  As
a result on 4/26/24, the District filed and served the instant motion seeking
an order staying proceedings in this matter pending the decisions of the two
matters currently before the Court of Appeal regarding the constitutionality of
AB 218 which enacted the version of CCP 340.1 on which Plaintiff bases this
lawsuit.  Plaintiff has opposed the
motion and the District has filed a reply to the opposition.  
 
ANALYSIS
 
The District’s Request for Judicial Notice (DRJN) is
granted.
 
Plaintiff’s Request for Judicial Notice (PRJN) is granted.  However, the Court notes that rulings of
other superior court departments have no precedential effect.    
 
The District has failed to establish that a stay of the
proceedings is in the interests of justice and will promote judicial
efficiency.  Freiberg (1995) 33
CA4th 1484, 1489; See also Alpha Media Resort Investment Cases
(2019) 39 CA5th 1121, 1132-1133; CRC 3.1332.
 
There is no guarantee that any decision by the appellate
courts will be published so as to be binding on this Court.  Similarly, there is no guarantee that both of
the appellate courts will decide the issue in the same way.  Regardless of how either of the appellate
courts decide the issue, the matter could possibly proceed to the California
Supreme Court which would further delay matters for years.  
 
Based on the current standing of the law, there is no
potential for conflict between a trial court decision and an appellate
decision.  If the Court of Appeal ultimately
agrees with the District’s position, the District can revisit the issue at that
time by way of motion before this Court or by appeal of a judgment entered against
it.  
 
The District’s contention that it is not seeking an indefinite
stay, but rather “a stay for a reasonable time until the appellate decisions
have been rendered” is a difference without distinction.  Indefinite means “lasting for an unknown or
unstated length of time.”  See
Oxford Dictionary.  The District concedes
that it cannot state exactly when the appellate courts will render their decisions
on the issue as dates for oral argument have not even been scheduled.  As such, any stay would be for an indefinite
period of time.  
 
The Court finds that an indefinite stay of this separate action,
involving different parties is not warranted, especially considering there is
currently no conflict between courts of other 
jurisdictions.  Contrast Caiafa
Professional Law Corporation (1993) 15 CA4th 800, 803-807;  Farmland Irrigation Company, Inc. (1957)
48 C2d 208, 215.     
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion is denied.
