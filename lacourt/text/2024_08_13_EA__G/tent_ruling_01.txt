BACKGROUND
This is a personal injury
action arising from a motor vehicle collision. In June 2023, Plaintiff Mirella
Angelica Briceno Zamora was involved in a motor vehicle collision with
Defendant Burce Lane Renfrew near East Longden Avenue and Peck Road in
Irwindale.
On October 27, 2023, Briceno
Zamora filed a complaint against Renfrew and Does 1-100, alleging causes of
action for (1) motor vehicle negligence and (2) general negligence.
On July 11, 2024, Renfrew
filed the present motion. A hearing on the present motion is set for August 13,
2024, along with a case management conference/status conference re: ADR.
ANALYSIS
Renfrew
moves to quash Briceno Zamora’s subpoena to Huntington Optometric Center for
Renfrew’s medical records. For the following reasons, the court GRANTS Renfrew’s motion in part.
Legal Standard
If
a subpoena requires the attendance of a witness or the production of books,
documents, electronically stored information, or other things before a court,
or at the trial of an issue therein, or at the taking of a deposition, the
court, upon motion reasonably made by any person described in subdivision (b),
or upon the court's own motion after giving counsel notice and an opportunity
to be heard, may make an order quashing the subpoena entirely, modifying it, or
directing compliance with it upon those terms or conditions as the court shall
declare, including protective orders. In addition, the court may make any other
order as may be appropriate to protect the person from unreasonable or
oppressive demands such as unreasonable violations of the right of privacy.¿
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1987.1.)
An
individual’s right of privacy is protected by the California Constitution.
(Cal. Const., Art. I, § 1.) In ruling on discovery motions, the court must
balance the privacy claims of the responding party with the requesting party’s
need for the information. (Schnabel v. Superior Court (1993) 5 Cal.4th
704, 718-722.)¿¿The responding party, as the party asserting the right of
privacy, bears the initial burden of demonstrating (1) a “legally protected
privacy interest”; (2) an “objectively reasonable expectation of privacy in the
given circumstances”; and (3) a “threatened intrusion that is serious.” (Williams
v. Superior Court (2017) 3 Cal.5th 531, 552 (Williams).) If this
standard is met, requesting party must then show that the requested documents
are “directly relevant” to the litigation. (Tylo v. Superior Court (1997)
55 Cal.App.4th 1379, 1387, citing Britt v. Superior Court (1978) 20
Cal.3d 844, 858-859.)
Discussion
In
this case, Briceno Zamora subpoenaed copies of Renfrew’s medical records,
insurance records, and billing records from Renfrew’s optometrist for the last
ten years. (Ahdoot Decl., ¶ 4, Ex. A.) In moving to quash Briceno Zamora’s
subpoena, Renfrew argues Renfrew has a legitimate privacy interest and
reasonable expectation of privacy in Renfrew’s medical records. (Motion, p.
5:4-6:1.) The court agrees. (See Oiye v. Fox (2012) 211 Cal.App.4th
1036, 1070 [“[M]edical records are constitutionally private and statutorily
confidential.”].) The court also agrees that this a serious intrusion as
Briceno Zamora’s request a time span of the last ten years. Therefore, the
burden is now on Briceno Zamora to demonstrate how the requested records are
directly relevant to the present action.
Briceno
Zamora argues these records are directly relevant to determining the state of
Renfrew’s eyesight at the time of Renfrew’s collision with Briceno Zamora.
(Opp., p. 5:20-7:6.) Briceno Zamora argues Renfrew put Renfrew’s eyesight at
issue by admitting to the use of corrective lenses (Morhman Decl., Ex. 2, p.
32:24-33:5), claiming Renfrew did not see Briceno Zamora until it was too late
despite a clear view of the intersection (Morhman Decl., Ex. 2, p. 38:16-22,
50:14-23), and suggesting Renfrew’s eyesight had improved (Morhman Decl., Ex.
2, p. 33:13-25). Furthermore, Briceno Zamora argues these records are necessary
to determine if Renfrew’s glasses were the correct prescription strength at the
time of the collision.
While
the court agrees Renfrew’s eyesight and prescriptions for corrective lenses are
directly relevant to determining whether Renfrew was negligent, the court finds
the scope of the subpoena overly broad and unreasonable in its scope.
In
a deposition taken May 15, 2024, Renfrew stated Renfrew’s prescription was last
updated about a year ago (2023), although Renfrew was unable to recall the
exact date. (Morhman Decl., Ex. 2, p. 33:16-25.) Renfrew was also unable to
recall which prescription lenses Renfrew was using at the time of the collision
with Briceno Zamora. (Morhman Decl., Ex. 2, p. 33:22-25.) Thus, the court finds
the subpoena should be limitedin scope to the year in which the automobile
collision took place.  The court is not
persuaded that Plaintiff’s request for optometry records as far back as ten
years is justified.  Therefore the court
limits the subpoena to the following time period:  January 1, 2023 through December 31, 2023.
In
addition, the court also limits the items requested to copies of Renfrew’s eyesight
prescription and documentation of any eyesight prescription changes. The court
strikes Plaintiff’s broad request for all other forms of communications and
records.
Accordingly,
Renfrew’s motion is GRANTED IN PART.
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, the court
GRANTS IN PART Renfrew’s motion and limits Briceno Zamora’s subpoena to copies
of Renfrew’s eyesight prescription and documentation of Renfrew’s eyesight prescription
changes from January 1, 2023 through December 31, 2023.
