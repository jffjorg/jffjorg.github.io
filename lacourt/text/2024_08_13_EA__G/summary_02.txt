And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Laura Wang's motion to serve as the successor in interest of her deceased husband, Jeff Wang, in this personal injury action. The court found that Laura Wang's declaration meets all the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 377.32, which governs the substitution of a plaintiff's successor in interest. The court also noted that the legal standard requires that the successor in interest must file an affidavit or declaration providing certain information, including the decedent's name, date and place of death, and the distribution of the decedent's cause of action to the successor. Since Laura Wang's declaration meets these requirements, the court grants her motion and appoints her as Jeff Wang's successor in interest in this action.
