And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court grants Plaintiff Hovik Pashayan's Motion to Compel Deposition of Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC's Person Most Qualified. The Plaintiff argues that the defendant failed to appear at deposition and did not adequately respond to meet and confer efforts. The court finds that the defendant has not served a valid objection to the deposition notice and therefore, the Plaintiff may move for an order compelling the deponent's attendance and testimony. The court orders the defendant's Person Most Qualified to appear for deposition at a date, time, and location to be noticed by the Plaintiff.
