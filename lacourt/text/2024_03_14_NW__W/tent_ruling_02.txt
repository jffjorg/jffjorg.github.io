BACKGROUND 
 
On
December 13, 2022, Plaintiff Zaruhi Ayvazyan filed a complaint against
Defendants Agoura Advanced Dentistry (“ADD”), Kambiz Kamangar aka Kam Kamangar
and Sergey Lokot aka Serge Lokot for medical malpractice. Plaintiff alleges
around October 2021, Plaintiff became a patient of Defendant ADD and its
dentists, Dr. Kamangar and Dr. Lokot. During her treatment with Defendants from
October 1, 2021 to December 17, 2021, Plaintiff alleges Defendants negligently
and carelessly examined, diagnosed, treated, advised or failed to advise
Plaintiff so as to cause Plaintiff injury. Defendant Sergey Lokot’s motion for
summary judgment was granted on January 8, 2024.  Subsequently Defendant Lokot filed a
memorandum of costs on January 18, 2024. 

 
Plaintiff
now seeks reconsideration of the court’s order granting summary judgment.   Defendants Kambiz Kamangar DDS, Inc. and
Kambaz Kamangar, DDS move to compel further responses from plaintiff.  
 
[TENTATIVE] RULING 
 
Plaintiff
Motion for Reconsideration of the court’s ruling on the Motion for Summary
Judgment is DENIED. 

Defendants’ motions to compel are granted and sanctions imposed. 
 
DISCUSSION
 
I.                   
Motion for
Reconsideration 
 
Plaintiff
seeks reconsideration of the court’s order granting summary judgment to Defendant
Sergey Lokot, D.D.S. on the ground that the court’s ruling was in error and
failed to consider all the evidence presented.  
Plaintiff has failed to establish any basis for this court to reconsider
its prior ruling.  
A
motion for reconsideration must comply with C.C.P. Section 1008, which this
does not.  It is not based on new or
different facts or circumstances or law; and it does not provide the necessary
declaration.  C.C.P. §1008(e) expressly
states that compliance with the section is jurisdictional: “This section
specifies the court's jurisdiction with regard to applications for
reconsideration of its orders and renewals of previous motions, and applies to
all applications to reconsider any order of a judge or court, or for the
renewal of a previous motion... No application to reconsider any order or for
the renewal of a previous motion may be considered by any judge or court unless
made according to this section. C.C.P. §1008(e) (emphasis added).  “The party seeking reconsideration must
provide both newly discovered evidence and an explanation for the failure to
have produced such evidence earlier.” (Robbins v. Los Angeles Unified School
District (1992) 3 Cal.App.4th 313, 317. Berman v. Health Net (2000)
80 Cal.App.4th 1359, 1369.) 
Here,
plaintiff’s motion is fatally defective because no explanation is provided as
to whether and why any of facts in support of the Motion were previously
unavailable. The moving party must provide a ‘satisfactory explanation for the
failure to produce that evidence at an earlier time. (Even Zohar
Construction & Remodeling, Inc. v. Bellaire Townhouses, LLC (2015) 61
Cal.4th 830, 833, 189 Cal.Rptr.3d 824, 352 P.3d 391; New York Times Co. v.
Superior Court (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 206, 212”.)  As far as the court can determine, plaintiff
is simply trying to reargue the facts previously presented in opposition to the
motion for summary judgment.   These
failures are fatal to the instant motion. 
 
 
II.                 
Motion to
Compel Responses to Request for Production of Documents
 
Defendants
seek to compel plaintiff to provide responses, without objection, to a request
for production of documents served on plaintiff on October 10, 2023.  To date, no responses have been provided,
despite defendants’ efforts to meet and confer with plaintiff.  
Where a party fails to serve
timely responses to discovery requests, the court may make an order compelling
responses. (CCP §§ 2030.290, 2031.300, 2033.280; Sinaiko Healthcare
Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th
390, 403.) A party that fails to serve a timely response to the discovery
request waives any objection to the request, including one based on privilege
or the protection of attorney work product. (CCP §§2030.290(a), 2031.300(a), 2033.280(a);
Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc., supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at 404.)
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.010, the propounding party may
also move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of
any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a
monetary sanction. (CCP § 2033.280(b).) Under California law, unsworn responses
are tantamount to no responses.  (See
Appleton v. Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 632, 636 (holding that
unverified responses are tantamount to no responses). 
On October 10, 2023, Defendant
served requests for production on plaintiff. 
Responses were due by November 11, 2023. 
Plaintiff did not provide discovery responses by the deadline, nor did
she reach out for an extension. Defense counsel followed up with Plaintiff
regarding the discovery and attempted to meet and confer. 
Accordingly, the court finds
Plaintiff has failed to timely respond to Defendant’s properly served discovery
requests. Plaintiff is ordered to provide verified, signed responses without
objection, within 30 days. 
Sanctions
If a propounding party moves for
and obtains a court order compelling a response, the court shall impose
monetary sanctions against the party failing to timely respond to
interrogatories and demands for inspection unless that party acted with
substantial justification or the sanction would otherwise be unjust. (CCP §§
2030.290(c), 2031.300(c), 2033.280(c); Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc.,
supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at 404.) 
Defendants request $2403.85 in
sanctions, to compensate them for attorney’s fees incurred  to bring this motion, at the rate of $205 per
hour for a total of 7.5 hours of time, plus a $60 filing fee.  (Defalco Decl. ¶13.)   The court finds sanctions appropriate given
plaintiff’s refusal to provide responses, but in the more reasonable amount of
$880 (four hours of time, plus $60 filing fee.) Sanctions to be paid by
plaintiff within 30 days. 
III.               
Motion to Compel
Further Responses to Interrogatories
 
Defendants seek to compel further response to
form interrogatories (Set No. 2).   Plaintiff
initially provided responses to this set of interrogatories on October 31,
2023.   Defendants contend that the
responses are deficient and now seek to compel further responses.  
 
“On receipt of a response to interrogatories,
the propounding party may move for an order compelling a further response if
the propounding party deems that any of the following apply: (1) An answer to a
particular interrogatory is evasive or incomplete. (2) An exercise of the
option to produce documents under Section 2030.230 is unwarranted or the
required specification of those documents is inadequate. (3) An objection to an
interrogatory is without merit or too general.”¿ (CCP § 2030.300(a).)¿ “A motion
under subdivision (a) [of CCP § 2030.300] shall be accompanied by a meet and
confer declaration under Section 2016.040.”¿ (CCP § 2030.300(b).) In addition,
a separate statement is required.¿ (CRC Rule 3.1345(a)(2).)
 
Defendants seek to compel further responses to
Request No. 17.1, which asks for specific information relating to responses to
requests for admission.  There are four
subparts to Form Interrogatory Number 17.1, and the responding party is
required to answer each subpart of this interrogatory in a complete and
straightforward manner. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.220(a).) As the Code outlines
above under Section 2030.220, a responding party must answer to the extent
possible if an interrogatory cannot be answered completely, or a responding
party, who lacks sufficient personal knowledge, must so state but still make a
reasonable and good faith effort to obtain the information requested.
 
The court agrees that Plaintiff’s responses to
Form Interrogatory 17.1 are incomplete, in violation of Code of Civil Procedure
section 2030.220.  Defendants propounded
19 requests for admission, and Plaintiff denied each request. Since Plaintiff
did not make an unqualified admission to any request for admission, she was
required by the Code to provide a straightforward and complete response to all
the subparts of the accompanying Form Interrogatory Number 17.1. 
 
However, in her response, it is unclear to
which request for admission the  information
she provides applies. It is further unclear what issue this information (i.e.,
the list of dental providers) supports or addresses.  It is also insufficient for plaintiff to
broadly describe all medical records and require defendants to dig through them
to try to understand what page or pages are relevant to her response.  Plaintiff’s responses and use of Section
2030.230 are not in compliance with the Code because the required specification
of such documents is inadequate. A party that refers to C.C.P. 2030.230 must
specify the writings in sufficient detail so that the propounding party can
readily locate and  identify them. Here,
Plaintiff generally points to copies of “all medical records” (Park Decl., ¶ 7,
Exhibit C, 3:16) and “the documents produced” (Park Decl., ¶ 7, Exhibit C,
3:20-21) as an answer to Form Interrogatory Number 17.1, but this is improper,
overbroad, vague, and lacks sufficient detail as required by the Code.
 
Accordingly, the court orders plaintiff to
provide further responses under oath within 30 days.  She is required to answer the following
question as to each RFA she denied:
 
(a) state the number of the request;
(b) state all facts upon which you base your
response;
(c) state the names, ADDRESSES, and telephone
numbers of all PERSONS who have
knowledge of those facts; and
(d) identify all DOCUMENTS and other tangible
things that support your response and
state the
name, ADDRESS, and telephone number of the PERSON who has each DOCUMENT or thing.
 
 The
request for sanctions is granted but in a reduced amount.  Because plaintiff’s position was not
substantially justified, defendants are entitled to the reasonable cost of
bringing this straightforward motion, or three hours of time plus the filing
fee, or $675.  Sanctions are payable
within 30 days by Plaintiff.
