And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the defendants' motion for summary judgment and alternative motion for summary adjudication. The defendants had moved to dismiss the plaintiffs' claims for negligence, negligent hiring, supervision, and retention, and negligent entrustment. The judge finds that a triable issue of material fact exists as to whether the defendants gave permission to operate the vehicle, and whether the defendants knew or should have known of the unfitness of the party to whom the vehicle was entrusted. The judge also finds that the defendants did not meet their burden to show that one or more elements of the causes of action cannot be established or that there is a complete defense to the causes of action. As a result, the motion is denied, and the case will proceed to trial.
