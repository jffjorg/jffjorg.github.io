And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This tentative ruling addresses Tammy Metzger's motion to vacate the judgment entered on November 7, 2023. The motion was filed pursuant to CCP § 473(b) and (d), which allow a court to relieve a party from a judgment due to mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. However, the Court finds that the plaintiff failed to provide any facts to support grounds for vacating the judgment. The Court also notes that the actual legal authority that would support grounds to vacate a judgment under the facts of this case is found in CCP § 663.

The Court further finds that the notice of entry of judgment was served by mail and email on November 7, 2023, and the motion was not heard within the time requirements of Section 663a. Therefore, the Court has lost jurisdiction to rule on this motion. Pursuant to CCP § 663a, the motion to vacate judgment is taken off calendar. Defendant is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
