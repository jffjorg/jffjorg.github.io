The demurrer was filed on March 6, 2024, and the opposition was filed by the plaintiff on March 13, 2024. The judge has sustained the demurrer without leave to amend as to the cause of action under 18 USC § 242, which is a criminal statute that does not give rise to a civil action for damages. The judge has sustained the demurrer with leave to amend as to the cause of action under 42 USC § 1983, which requires the plaintiff to allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action under this statute. The judge has ordered the plaintiff to file a first amended complaint within 20 days of the date of this order. The judge has also ordered the plaintiff to address the issue of the capacity in which the defendant, Officer Crosby, is being sued.
