Plaintiff alleges that on May 9, 2023, it acquired the subject property and unit at a trustee’s sale after Maultsby defaulted on a loan secured by the property. (Compl., ¶9.) Defendant remains in possession of the property despite being served with a three day notice to quit. (Compl., ¶¶11-13.)PROCEDURAL HISTORYOn September 1, 2023, Plaintiff filed its complaint against Defendant Linda Maultsby.On January 29, 2024, Defendant filed this motion to transfer case. On February 1, 2024, Defendant filed a demurrer.On February 26, 2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition.On March 7, 2024, Plaintiff filed an Amended Complaint. DISCUSSIONI. DemurrerDefendant demurs to the Complaint on the grounds that (1) Plaintiff lacks the legal capacity to sue, (2) the Complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action and is uncertain, and (3) the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the unlawful detainer cause of action because Defendant was not served with the notice to quit and the notice is fatally defective. A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in context. In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) “A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters. Therefore, it lies only where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 430.30, 430.70.) At the pleading stage, a plaintiff need only allege ultimate facts sufficient to apprise the defendant of the factual basis for the claim against him. (Semole v. Sansoucie (1972) 28 Cal. App. 3d 714, 721.) A “demurrer does not, however, admit contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law alleged in the pleading, or the construction of instruments pleaded, or facts impossible in law.” (S. Shore Land Co. v. Petersen (1964) 226 Cal.App.2d 725, 732 (internal citations omitted).)Plaintiff’s Amended ComplaintDefendant filed a demurrer on February 1, 2024 with a hearing date of May 22, 2024. On February 8, 2024, the hearing date was advanced to March 8, 2024. On March 8, 2024, the hearing was continued to May 1, 2024.  The March 8th hearing was held. At that hearing, the Court continued the hearing to May 1, 2024 to see if this matter would be related to other pending cases. The Court did not extend the time for briefing of the motion.A party may amend its pleading once without leave of court at any time after a demurrer is filed but before the hearing on the demurrer. (Code Civ. Proc., section 473(a).) The amended pleading must be filed and served no later than the date for filing an opposition to the demurrer. (Id.) When the plaintiff files an amended complaint in response to a defendant’s demurrer before the hearing on the demurrer, that hearing should be taken off calendar because the amended complaint supersedes the complaint to which the demurrer was directed. (People ex rel. Strathmann v. Acacia Research Corp. (2012) 210 Cal.App.4th 487, 506.)Here, Plaintiff filed its amended complaint on March 7, 2024, one day before the March 8, 2024 hearing on this demurrer. Because the amended complaint was filed after the date Plaintiff’s opposition was due according to the March 8, 2024 hearing date, the amended complaint was not timely filed and must be stricken. Defendant’s demurrer remains on calendar.Meet and ConferA party filing a demurrer “shall meet and confer in person or by telephone with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer.” (Code Civ. Proc., section 430.41(a).) “The parties shall meet and confer at least five days before the date the responsive pleading is due. If the parties are not able to meet and confer at least five days prior to the date the responsive pleading is due, the demurring party shall be granted an automatic 30-day extension of time within which to file a responsive pleading, by filing and serving, on or before the date on which a demurrer would be due, a declaration stating under penalty of perjury that a good faith attempt to meet and confer was made and explaining the reasons why the parties could not meet and confer.” (Code Civ. Proc., section 430.41(a)(2).) A failure to meet and confer does not constitute grounds to sustain or overrule a demurrer. (See Code Civ. Proc., sections 430.41 (a)(4).)Here, Defendant fails to provide evidence that she met and conferred with Plaintiff prior to filing this demurrer. However, failure to meet and confer is not grounds to sustain or overrule a demurrer.AnalysisDefendant alleges that the notice to quit allegedly served on her is defective because the notice states the new legal owner of the property is Real Time Resolutions, Inc. However, the Complaint states the new owner of the subject property is Mural Media LLC 401k Plan.  “In any of the following cases, a person who holds over and continues in possession of a manufactured home, mobile home, floating home, or real property after a three-day written notice to quit the property has been served upon the person, or if there is a subtenant in actual occupation of the premises, also upon such subtenant, as prescribed in Section 1162, may be removed therefrom as prescribed in this chapter:  (1) Where the property has been sold pursuant to a writ of execution against such person, or a person under whom such person claims, and the title under the sale has been duly perfected.  (2) Where the property has been sold pursuant to a writ of sale, upon the foreclosure by proceedings taken as prescribed in this code of a mortgage, or under an express power of sale contained therein, executed by such person, or a person under whom such person claims, and the title under the foreclosure has been duly perfected.  (3) Where the property has been sold in accordance with Section 2924 of the Civil Code, under a power of sale contained in a deed of trust executed by such person, or a person under whom such person claims, and the title under the sale has been duly perfected.  (4) Where the property has been sold by such person, or a person under whom such person claims, and the title under the sale has been duly perfected.  (5) Where the property has been sold in accordance with Section 18037.5 of the Health and Safety Code under the default provisions of a conditional sale contract or security agreement executed by such person, or a person under whom such person claims, and the title under the sale has been duly perfected.”  (Code Civ. Proc., section 1161a, subd. (b).)A purchaser may initiate an unlawful detainer action under Code Civ. Proc., section 1161a with a 3-day notice to quit after a deed is recorded and after the purchaser perfects title. (Code Civ. Proc., section 1161a(b)(3); Dr. Leevil, LLC v Westlake Health Ctr. (2018) 6 Cal.5th 474, 479–480.) Unlawful detainer proceedings are “limited in scope and demand strict adherence to the statutes’ procedural requirements.” (Stancil v. Super. Ct. (2021) 11 Cal.5th 381, 390.) Unlawful detainer cases filed pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1161 are regularly dismissed for even the most minute defects in notice. (ESA Mgmt., LLC v. Jacob (2021) 63 Cal.App.5th Supp. 1, 3, holding that a notice that did not include the amount of rent due or any information to permit the tenant to cure the default made the notice “fatally defective.”)“Where the purchaser at a trustee’s sale proceeds under section 1161a of the Code of Civil Procedure he must prove his acquisition of title by purchase at the sale . . . .” (Cheney v. Trauzettel (1937) 9 Cal.2d 158, 159, citations omitted.) “In an action for unlawful detainer, section 1161a therefore necessarily requires proof that the property was ‘duly sold . . .’ and that ‘the title under the sale has been duly perfected.’” (Seidell v. Anglo-California Trust Co. (1942) 55 Cal.App.2d 913, 920, citing Code Civ. Proc., § 1161a.)Here, the notice to quit states the new legal owner of the subject property is Real Time Resolutions, Inc. (Compl., Exh. 2.) However, the Complaint states Plaintiff is the legal owner of the subject property. (Compl., ¶1.) Additionally, the Trustee’s Deed Upon Sale states that the SBS Trust Deed Network, a corporation, granted a 47.618% interest in the subject property to Plaintiff and various other percentages to other entities. (Compl., Exh. 1.) Because the name on the notice to quit is Real Time Resolutions, Inc., which is not Mural Media, LLC 401k Plan, the name recorded in the Trustee’s Deed Upon Sale, the notice would not have given Defendant notice that the property had been duly sold to Plaintiff and that title had been perfected. Therefore, the Court finds the notice is fatally defective. The three-day notice is fatally defective and fails to support an unlawful detainer action. The demurrer is sustained on this ground. The Court declines to rule on the issue of standing.Regarding the issue of leave to amend, Plaintiff failed to oppose this motion. The burden is on Plaintiffs to show in what manner the complaint may be amended and how the amendment would change the legal effect of his pleading. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335.) Because Plaintiff failed to oppose this motion, Plaintiff fails to meet his burden of showing how the Complaint may be amended. Additionally, even if Plaintiff served a new notice to quit, Plaintiff would be required to commence a new action after filing a valid three day notice to quit. Therefore, the Complaint cannot be amended to cure the defect identified above. II. Motion to TransferDefendant Linda Maultsby moves to change venue on the grounds that witnesses who will be called to testify at trial will be inconvenienced unless this matter is transferred to a different court. This motion is denied as moot given that the demurrer has been sustained without leave to amend.DATED: May 1, 2024______________________________Hon. Jill FeeneyJudge of the Superior Court
