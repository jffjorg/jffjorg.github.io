And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting Defendant Ralph Karubian's Motion for Summary Adjudication of the second cause of action for FEHA harassment. The motion was based on the argument that the Defendant did not participate in the harassment and that the only harassment suffered by the Plaintiff was at the hands of co-worker Mark Burgess. The Judge ruled that the Defendant cannot be personally liable for harassment he did not participate in, and that the Plaintiff's position is foreclosed by case authority, specifically Fiol v. Doellstedt (1996). The Judge held that a non-harassing supervisor who fails to take action on a harassment complaint has not engaged in personal conduct constituting harassment, but rather has made a personnel management decision. Therefore, the motion is granted, and the Plaintiff must give notice.
