```

The judge's tentative ruling is that the defendant's demurrer is sustained, with 30 days leave to amend, due to the plaintiff's failure to plead facts that are legally sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The ruling is based on the plaintiff's failure to specifically plead facts regarding their "inability to have made earlier discovery despite reasonable diligence" and the fact that their claims are time-barred without the benefit of the delayed-discovery rule. The judge also finds that the defendant's arguments as to the sufficiency of the fraud allegations and the statute of frauds are unpersuasive.
