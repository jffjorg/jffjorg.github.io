And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motions to compel responses to the defendant's interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for production, as well as the motion to deem requests for admission admitted. The defendant failed to respond to the discovery requests, and the plaintiff has shown that the defendant's failure to respond was not justified. The judge also grants the plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions in the amount of $3,915, payable by the defendant and defense counsel within 30 days. The judge denied the defendant's request to stay the proceedings until a criminal case is resolved, as the defendant did not provide sufficient evidence to show that the discovery requests would implicate his Fifth Amendment rights.
