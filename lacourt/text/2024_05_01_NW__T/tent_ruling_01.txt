  Case Number:  22VECV01843    Hearing Date:   May 1, 2024    Dept:  T [TENTATIVE] ORDER:  Defendants Tiptop Restoration, Inc. and Kevin Manuel Lara’s Unopposed Motion for Leave to File a Cross-Complaint is GRANTED.
Introduction 
Defendants Tiptop Restoration, Inc. and Kevin Manuel Lara (collectively, Defendants) moved to file a Cross-Complaint against third-party Liberty Freeman (Freeman) to allege indemnity, apportionment, and declaratory relief.
Discussion 
Cross-claims against complainants arising from the same transaction or series thereof, existing at the time of filing an answer, are compulsory.  (Code Civ. Proc., sec. 426.30(a); Al Holding Co. v. O’Brien & Hicks, Inc. (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 1310, 1313-14.)  Leave to file compulsory cross-complaints must be granted where moving parties acted in good faith. (Code Civ. Proc., sec. 426.50; Silver Organizations, Ltd. v. Frank (1990) 217 Cal.App.3d 94, 98-99.)  Defendants argued that the motor vehicle accident at issue involved multiple cars.  Defendants asserted that Freeman negligently drove one of the cars that hit Plaintiff.  Defendants provided that the new facts were discovered when the case was transferred to Defendants’ new counsel.  These contentions show that the cross-complaint is compulsory because the claims arise from the same accident.  Because the cross-complaint is compulsory, the motion is persuasive.
The unopposed motion for leave is GRANTED.  The proposed Cross-Complaint shall be filed within 15 days.  Given the addition of a new party, the court will consider whether to continue the trial and FSC.
IT IS SO ORDERED, CLERK TO GIVE NOTICE.
