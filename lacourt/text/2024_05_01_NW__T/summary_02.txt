And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling is a preliminary decision by the judge on a demurrer filed by Defendant Starbucks Corporation to the Complaint filed by Plaintiff Yevgeniy Zharinov. The demurrer was filed on April 18, 2024, and no opposition was filed by Plaintiff. The judge reviewed the Complaint and found that it only alleged a single cause of action for general negligence, which is insufficient to plead libel or gross negligence. The judge also found that the Complaint does not sufficiently plead damages. Therefore, the judge sustained the demurrer with 20 days leave to amend, giving Plaintiff the opportunity to cure the pleading defects.
