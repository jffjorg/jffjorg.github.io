And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the unopposed motion for leave to file a Cross-Complaint by Defendants Tiptop Restoration, Inc. and Kevin Manuel Lara against third-party Liberty Freeman. The Defendants argue that the motor vehicle accident at issue involved multiple cars, and that Freeman negligently drove one of the cars that hit the Plaintiff. The Judge finds that the cross-complaint is compulsory because the claims arise from the same accident, and grants the motion. The proposed Cross-Complaint must be filed within 15 days.
