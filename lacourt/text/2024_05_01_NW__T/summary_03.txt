And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the Plaintiff's application for a writ of possession, allowing the Plaintiff to repossess the vehicle from the Defendant. The court waives the requirement for the Plaintiff to post an undertaking, and instead orders the Defendant to post a re-delivery bond of $40,000.00 to secure the return of the vehicle. The court finds that the Plaintiff has shown their rights to possession and that the Defendant has breached the contract by failing to pay. The court also finds that the Plaintiff has shown the probable validity of their claim and right to repossess the vehicle.
