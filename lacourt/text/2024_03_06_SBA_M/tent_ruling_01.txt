PROCEEDINGS
 
            Swift Financial, LLC v. Warren Tarbell 
24TRCP00033
1.      Swift Financial, LLC’s Petition
for Order Confirming Arbitration Award 
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
Petitioner Swift Financial,
LLC’s Petition for Order Confirming Arbitration Award is granted.  
 
Background
 
Petitioner filed its
petition on January 17, 2024. Petitioner alleges the following facts.
Respondents breached their obligations pursuant to a written loan agreement. The
parties proceeded via arbitration and the Petitioner prevailed by obtaining an
arbitration award in its favor.
 
Petition
to Confirm Arbitration Award   
 
The procedure by which a prevailing party obtains an
enforceable judgment, upon the completion of the arbitration, is to petition to
confirm the award.  CCP § 1286; Loeb v. Record (2008) 162 Cal.App.4th
431, 450.  
 
            Service of this petition must meet
the requirements of CCP § 1290.4.  CCP §
1290.4 states, in relevant part:  
“(a) A copy of the petition and a written notice of
the time and place of the hearing thereof and any other papers upon which the
petition is based shall be served in the manner provided in the arbitration
agreement for the service of such petition and notice.
(c) If the arbitration agreement does not provide the
manner in which such service shall be made and the person on whom service is to
be made has previously appeared in the proceeding or has previously been served
in accordance with subdivision (b) of this section, service shall be made in
the manner provided in Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 1010) of Title 14 of
Part 2 of this code.”  Code Civ. Proc., §
1290.4.
 
Here, the petitioner has properly served the petition
upon respondent, and provided notice of the hearing date. (Proofs of Service,
dated February 20, 2024.)  In the
underlying arbitration, the arbitrator made certain rulings and awarded in
favor of petitioner.  (Petition, Ex 8(c).)     
 
            CCP § 1285.4 states: 
“A
petition under this chapter shall:
(a)
Set forth the substance of or have attached a copy of the agreement to
arbitrate unless the petitioner denies the existence of such an agreement.
(b)
Set forth the names of the arbitrators.
(c)
Set forth or have attached a copy of the award and the written opinion of the
arbitrators, if any.”
 
            Petitioner has adequately complied
with all the requirements of CCP § 1285.4. 
(Petition, Exs. 4b, 8c.)
 
            Therefore, the petition to confirm
arbitration award is granted.  
 
Petitioner is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
