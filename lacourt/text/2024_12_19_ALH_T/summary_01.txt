And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the plaintiff's motion to lift the automatic stay in the bankruptcy proceedings. The plaintiff, Khachik Jangozian, tripped on the defendant's premises in 2019 and filed a lawsuit against 99 Cents Only Stores, LLC. The defendant then filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, which automatically stayed the lawsuit. The plaintiff and the defendant's insurance carrier executed a stipulation allowing the plaintiff to continue pursuing the lawsuit against the insurance company and other non-debtor parties. The bankruptcy court ordered the stay to be lifted to allow the lawsuit to proceed. The judge found that lifting the stay was appropriate because the plaintiff intends to seek recovery solely from the insurance funds and the defendant has available insurance coverage.
