And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by Simon Ginez Monico, the defendant, to deem his requests for admission admitted and to impose monetary sanctions on the plaintiff, Bryan Elias Sanchez.

The motion was filed because Sanchez failed to serve timely responses to Monico's requests for admission, despite being granted multiple extensions. Monico's counsel, Robert G. McKeon, attests that Sanchez was served with the requests on March 14, 2024, and was required to respond by April 26, 2024. However, Sanchez did not serve a response until July 31, 2024, after the motion was filed.

The judge has denied the motion as moot, as Sanchez has served the untimely responses before the hearing of the motion. However, the judge has granted Monico's request for monetary sanctions in part. The judge has ordered Sanchez and his attorney to jointly and severally pay $480.00 to Monico's counsel within 20 days.
