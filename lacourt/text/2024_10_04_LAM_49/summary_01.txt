Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on a demurrer filed by Cross-Defendant Sherri Vanessa Williams to the Cross-Complaint filed by Cross-Complainant Marcia Frater. The Cross-Complaint alleges several causes of action against Cross-Defendant Williams, including breach of lease agreements, failure to disclose the statutory warranty of habitability, and negligence. The judge has sustained the demurrer in its entirety as to the first, second, and third causes of action, with leave to amend. The judge has also sustained the demurrer as to the fourth cause of action, but will allow leave to amend if Cross-Complainant can demonstrate a reasonable possibility of a successful amendment. The judge has granted Cross-Defendant Williams' demurrer, which means that the Cross-Complaint will need to be rewritten to address the deficiencies identified by the judge.
