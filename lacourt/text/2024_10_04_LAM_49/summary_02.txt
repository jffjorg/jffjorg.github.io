Significant Statements:
  - "The court entered the default judgment on February 29, 2024. Defendants filed this motion to set aside the judgment on August 23, 2024. Therefore, the motion was timely filed within the 6-month deadline, and the judgment need not be void on its face."
  - "A plaintiff bears the burden of showing facts requisite to a valid service."
  - "The filing of a proof of service declaration ordinarily creates a rebuttable presumption that the service was proper, but only if the service declaration “complies with the statutory requirements regarding such proofs.”"
  - "The Proof of Service of Summons reflects service on individual Defendant DiPrizio by substitute service on October 10, 2023. The process server left the documents with Yvonne Apicella at 226 Everett St, Boston, MA 02128."
  - "Defendants argue the judgment here is void on its face because the process server’s declaration in the proof of service showed that he had been advised that Mr. DiPrizio was “not a resident” at the Massachusetts Property, and thus that this address was not his “dwelling house” or “usual place of abode” for purposes of substitute service at a residence."
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendants' motion to set aside the defaults and default judgment. The defendants were served with process in Massachusetts and Montana, but the service was invalid in both states. The judge finds that the process server's declaration in the proof of service showed that he had been advised that Mr. DiPrizio was not a resident at the Massachusetts property, and thus that this address was not his "dwelling house" or "usual place of abode" for purposes of substitute service at a residence. The judge also finds that the service on the entity defendant Triple 2 Digital, LLC was invalid because there was no evidence that the person served was authorized to accept service on behalf of the corporation.

The judge sets aside the default judgment entered on February 29, 2024, and declares it null and void. The judge orders that unless the defendants voluntarily accept service of process and/or appear in the case, the plaintiff will be required to properly serve the defendants. The judge also orders that the motion to quash service of summons set for October 9, 2024, is advanced and vacated as moot.

The judge notes that the defendants' motion raises personal jurisdictional issues, but the court need not address those issues at this time. The judge invites any party to submit on the tentative ruling by contacting the courtroom via email by no later than 4:00 p.m. the day before the hearing.
