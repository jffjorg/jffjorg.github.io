And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the motion for summary judgment filed by Defendants Biomat USA, Inc. and Grifols USA, LLC. The motion was filed in response to Plaintiff Myesha Jones' complaint alleging violations of the FEHA and Labor Code, breach of contract, wrongful termination, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The judge found that both parties' separate statements failed to comply with the California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1350, and as a result, the evidence submitted was unusable. The judge noted that the evidence consisted largely of deposition transcripts that were submitted in their entirety, but without proper referencing or page numbers, making it impossible for the court to easily locate the evidence referenced in a particular fact. The judge also found that the parties' failure to supply the court with separate statements it can properly use meant that the motion for summary judgment must be denied.
