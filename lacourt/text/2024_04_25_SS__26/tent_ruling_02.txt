ANALYSIS:
 
On September 28,
2022, Plaintiff JMNBM Corporation dba Blue Pacific Pools Southern
California (“Plaintiff”) filed the Complaint in this
action against Defendants Con’struc’ture, Inc., Aragon (Toluca/Colton)
Properties Corporation (erroneously sued Aragon Properties Corporation)
(“Defendant Aragon”), and SureTec Insurance Company.
On February 21, 2023, the Court sustained Defendant Aragon’s Demurrer to the Complaint without leave to amend.
 
Plaintiff filed
the First Amended Complaint on March 6, 2023, to which Defendants filed answers
on May 23 and 31, 2023. The action came for trial March 27, 2024 but Plaintiff
failed to appear. (Minute Order, 03/27/24.) The Court dismissed the First
Amended Complaint without prejudice. (Ibid.) Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to Vacate Dismissal on April 3, 2024.
No opposition to the Motion has been filed to date.
 
Discussion
 
The motion is brought on equitable grounds based on
extrinsic mistake or fraud. To qualify for this relief, circumstances
extrinsic to the litigation must have unfairly cost a party a hearing on the
merits, and the party must demonstrate: (1) “a meritorious case”; (2) “a
satisfactory excuse for not presenting a defense to the original action”; and
(3) “diligence in seeking to set aside the default once the fraud [or mistake]
had been discovered.” (Mechling v. Asbestos Defendants (2018) 29
Cal.App.5th 1241, 1245-1246 (citing In re Marriage of Stevenot (1984)
154 Cal.App.3d 1051, 1071).) 
 
The Motion was timely
filed one week after the action was dismissed and is supported by an attorney affidavit explaining that Plaintiff’s counsel
failed to appear at trial because that morning her dog was mauled by a coyote.
(Motion, Manning Decl., ¶3.) Plaintiff’s counsel was trial-ready and promptly
informed defense counsel of the incident and that she would be an hour late to
court. (Id. at ¶4 and Exhs. 1-2.) This information was apparently not
communicated to the Court by defense counsel when they appeared on March 27,
2024. This demonstrates that Plaintiff was deprived of the opportunity to
appear for trial due to extrinsic circumstances and has diligently sought
relief from the dismissal. 
 
Therefore, the Court finds the case should be reinstated and
re-set for trial.

 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff JMNBM Corporation dba
Blue Pacific Pools Southern California’s Motion to Vacate Dismissal is GRANTED.
THE DISMISSAL ENTERED ON MARCH 27, 2024 IS HEREBY VACATED.
 
TRIAL IS SET FOR MAY 23,
2024 AT 8:30 AM IN DEPARTMENT 26 IN THE SPRING STREET COURTHOUSE.
