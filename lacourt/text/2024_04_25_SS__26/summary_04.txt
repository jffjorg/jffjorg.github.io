And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled in favor of the plaintiff, Insook Kim Kawakami, and has ordered the defendants, James Joung Hyen Lee and Hyen Uk Lee, to serve verified responses to the form interrogatories, set one, without objections within 20 days of the order. The judge has also ordered the defendants to pay sanctions of $100 to the plaintiff within the same timeframe. The judge denied the plaintiff's request to compel responses to the requests for admission, set one, and request for sanctions, as there is no legal authority to compel initial responses to requests for admission.
