v. AFT College Staff Guild Local 1521A, et al.MOTION
FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT(CCP § 437c)
TENTATIVE RULING:  
 
Respondent AFT College Staff Guild Local 1521A’s Motion for
Summary Judgment is DENIED.
 
 
ANALYSIS:
 
On October 26, 2022, Petitioner
Velma Butler (“Petitioner”) filed the instant Appeal of Labor Commissioner
Award against Respondent AFT College Staff Guild Local 1521A (“Respondent”).
The Petition is brought pursuant to Cal. Labor Code section 98.2 and was
originally assigned to an unlimited jurisdiction court. On February 23, 2024,
the Court overruled Respondent’s demurrer to the Appeal, which was
substantively a motion to dismiss, and four days later ordered the action to
the transferred to the limited jurisdiction court. (Minute Orders, 02/23/24 and
02/27/24.) On January 12, 2024, Respondent filed the instant Motion for Summary
Judgment. Petitioner filed an opposition on March 13, 2024 and Respondent
replied on March 20, 2024. 
 
Discussion
 
Appeal Under Labor Code § 98.2
 
Pursuant to Cal. Labor Code section 98.2, Petitioner appeals
a decision of the California Labor Commissioner rendered on September 27, 2022.
(Pet., Exh. A.) Petitioner alleges that Defendant owes her (1) minimum wages
earned from June 1, 2019 to September 30, 2019; (2) liquidated damages pursuant
to Labor Code section 1194.2; and (3) waiting time penalties pursuant to Labor
Code section 203. Under this statute, “[w]ithin 10 days after service of notice
of an order, decision, or award the parties may seek review by filing an appeal
to the superior court, where the appeal shall be heard de novo.” (Lab. Code, §
98.2, subd. (a).) It therefore appears that where a trial de novo is authorized
in the superior court, proceedings are subject to the rules usually applicable
to superior court actions. (Sales Dimensions v. Superior Court (1979) 90
Cal.App.3d 757, 761.) Furthermore, “an interpretation of [section 98.2] must be
arrived at which, if possible, gives effect to both the term ‘review’ and the
term ‘de novo.’ (Citations omitted). Since the superior court may hear
testimony, including any new evidence, the findings of the Labor Commissioner
are entitled to no weight whatsoever, and the proceedings are truly ‘a trial
anew in the fullest sense.’” (Id. at 763.) In a case where the question
of discovery during the trial de novo was raised, the Court of Appeals
explained the broad latitude of the trial court in determining the procedures
in such an appeal:
 
The approach which we have outlined is
consistent with the power of the courts “to adopt any suitable method of
practice, both in ordinary actions and special proceedings, if the procedure is
not specified by statute or by rules adopted by the Judicial Council.” (Citations
omitted.) The superior court is vested with jurisdiction to hear the appeal de
novo. Yet, no procedures for exercising that jurisdiction are specified.
Therefore, the superior court, in the exercise of its discretion, may establish
an appropriate procedure on discovery in each case.
 
(Id. at 763-764.) 
 
Preemption by the Labor Management Relations Act
 
In response to Petitioner’s appeal, Respondent has filed the
instant Motion for Summary Judgment on the grounds that (1) Petitioner’s claims
are preempted by the Labor Management Relations Act and must be dismissed; or
(2) Petitioner is only entitled to 11 days of wages for the relevant time
period. Respondent previously raised this preemption argument in its demurrer
to the Petition, which came before Department 73 in the Stanley Mosk
Courthouse. In finding the demurrer premature because no record had been
developed, Department 73 set forth this explanation of the law of preemption:
 
Respondent contends that this entire action is preempted
under section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act (“LMRA”), which is
codified in Title 29, United States Code, sections 185, et seq. (“Section
301”). “Section 301 is on its face a jurisdictional statute, under which ‘suits
for violation of contracts between an employer and a labor organization
representing employees in an industry affecting commerce as defined in this
chapter, or between any such labor organizations, may be brought in any district
court of the United States having jurisdiction of the parties.’” (Cramer v.
Consol. Freightways, Inc. (9th Cir. 2001) 255 F.3d 683, 689 [quoting 29
U.S.C. § 185(a)].) “Section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act (LMRA)
preempts state law claims that are based directly on rights created by a
collective bargaining agreement as well as claims that are substantially
dependent on an interpretation of a collective bargaining agreement.” (Beals
v. Kiewit Pac. Co. (9th Cir. 1997) 114 F.3d 892, 894 [citing Caterpillar,
Inc. v. Williams (1987) 482 U.S. 386, 394].) The complaints of employees
covered by a collective bargaining agreement are not preempted if their claims
are unrelated to the terms of the agreement. (Id. at 396 n. 10.)
“[S]tates may provide substantive rights to workers that apply without regard
to a [collective bargaining agreement]; a state court seeking to vindicate
these rights is preempted only if it ‘requires the interpretation of a
collective-bargaining agreement.’” (Cramer, supra, 255 F.3d at 690 [quoting Lingle
v. Norge Division of Magic Chef, Inc. (1988) 486 U.S. 399, 413].) “Even if
dispute resolution pursuant to a collective-bargaining agreement, on the one
hand, and state law, on the other, would require addressing precisely the same
set of facts, as long as the state-law claim can be resolved without
interpreting the agreement itself, the claim is ‘independent’ of the agreement
for § 301 pre-emption purposes.” (Lingle, supra, 486 U.S. at 409-10.) 
 
“Preemption occurs when a claim cannot be resolved on the
merits without choosing among competing interpretations of a [CBA] and its
application to the claim.” (Rymel v. Save Mart Supermarkets, Inc. (2018)
30 Cal.App.5th 853, 861 [internal citations omitted].) There is a “two-step
inquiry to analyze § 301 preemption of state law claims.” (Id. at 863
[citing Kobold v. Good Samaritan Regional Medical Center (9th Cir. 2016)
832 F.3d 1024, 1032-1033].) “First, a court must determine whether the asserted
cause of action involves a right conferred upon an employee by virtue of state
law, not by a CBA.” (Id. [internal quotations omitted].) “If the right
exists solely as a result of the CBA, then the claim is preempted, and [the]
analysis ends there.” (Id. [internal quotations omitted].) “If the court
determines that the right underlying the plaintiff’s state law claim(s) exists
independently of the CBA, it moves to the second step, asking whether the right
is nevertheless substantially dependent on analysis of a [CBA].” (Id.
[internal quotations omitted].) “Where there is such substantial dependence,
the state law claim is preempted by §301. If there is not, then the claim can
proceed under state law.” (Id.) “[W]hen determining independence from
the CBA, the courts focus on the legal character of the claim rather than the
underlying set of facts. The question is whether the claim can be resolved by
looking to the CBA without the need for interpretation of the CBA.” (Id.)
 
 
Record Regarding PreemptionRespondent presents the following record of facts in support
of its Motion. Petitioner was employed by the Los Angeles Community College
District (the “District”) and served as president of Respondent, the Union. (Motion,
Separate Statement, Fact Nos. 3, 5; Deutsche Decl. at 45:38, 1:08:53; Smith
Decl., Exh. A.) Respondent and the District have a collective bargaining
agreement (“CBA”) governing employment for its members. (Motion, Separate
Statement, Fact No. 1; Smith Decl., Exh. A; Wright Decl., Exh. A at No. 3;
Wright Decl., Exh. A at No. 2.) Petitioner served as Respondent’s president
until September 17, 2019. (Motion, Separate Statement, Fact No. 3; Smith Decl.,
Exh. E; Deuthsche Decl. at 45:38.) Under the CBA, Respondent has a right to
five full-time positions of release time with pay. (Motion, Separate Statement,
Fact No. 4, Smith Decl., Exh. A at Art. 6(I).) During Petitioner’s tenure as
president, the District paid her all her wages. (Motion, Separate Statement,
Fact No. 5; Deutsche Decl. at 1:08:53.) The CBA gives Respondent the right to
reassign release time. (Motion, Smith Decl., Exh. A at ¶6.) Respondent allowed
Petitioner to take release time to fulfill her duties as president, as
permitted by the CBA. (Motion, Separate Statement, Fact No. 11; Deutsche Decl.
at 22:53, 52:53.) Prior to 2019, Respondent began providing Petitioner with a
monthly stipend. (Motion, Separate Statement, Fact No. 12; Deutsche Decl. at
1:04:58-1:06:04.) Effective May 23, 2019, Respondent removed Petitioner’s
release time and ceased the monthly stipend. (Motion, Separate Statement, Fact
No. 13; Deutsche Decl. at 1:07:43; Smith Decl. at ¶9 and Exh. C.) Petitioner
then returned to her position with the District, as permitted by the CBA.
(Motion, Separate Statement, Fact No. 14; Wright Decl., Exh. 3.) Petitioner was
removed from her position as president effective September 17, 2019. (Motion,
Separate Statement, Fact No. 15; Deutsche Decl. at 45:38; Smith Decl., Exh. E
at p. 1; Wright Decl., Exh. 1 at No. 4.) Petitioner was absent from her
position at the District for a variety of reasons from May 24, 2019 until June
14, 2019, on June 24, 2019, from June 28, 2019 through July 5, 2019, and from
July 17, 2019 through September 19, 2019. (Motion, Separate Statement, Fact No.
16; Wright Decl., Exh. 3.)
 
Petitioner’s claims for wages specifically arise from the
argument that Respondent had no authority to take away her release time for the
period of June 1, 2019 to September 30, 2019 and owe Petitioner minimum wages
earned at the rate of $13.25 per hour for 173.3 regular hours worked from June
1, 2019 to June· 30, 2019 and minimum wages earned at the rate of $14.25 per
hour for 519.9 regular hours worked from July 1, 2019 to September 30, 2019,
being $9,704.83. Respondent argues that whether (1) it had the right to remove
Petitioner’s release time; (2) owed Petitioner a stipend; and (3) Petitioner
was an employee entitled to wages, requires an analysis of the CBA and the
Union’s Constitution. Specifically, the CBA describes how much release time is
available to Respondent, that the release time is provided to Respondent with
pay by the District of each individual’s salary, that Respondent shall give the
District notice of the individuals who are granted release time, and that
Respondent may reassign release time. 
 
In opposition, Petitioner presents the following facts. That
Respondent is governed by the CBA and Constitution does not mean it is not
governed by California’s wage and hour labor laws. (Opp., Separate Statement,
Fact No. 2.) Although Petitioner was paid all her wages by the District during
her tenure as Respondent’s president, she was also owed wages from Respondent
that were not paid. (Opp., Separate Statement, Fact No. 5; Butler Decl. at ¶3
and Exhs. A-B.) The “stipend” paid to Petitioner each month by Respondent was a
wage under California law. (Opp., Separate Statement, Fact No. 12 and
Additional Fact Nos. 1-2; Butler Decl., at ¶3 and Exhs. A-B.) Respondent
stopped paying Petitioner’s monthly salary in May 2019 but did not remove her
as president until September 2019. (Opp., Separate Statement, Additional Fact
No. 3; Butler Decl., ¶4.) The payment of a monthly salary was a long-standing
practice by Respondent that existed before Petitioner became president. (Opp.,
Separate Statement, Additional Fact No. 7; Butler Decl., ¶3.) Based on these
facts, Petitioner argues that her claims do not involve the CBA, but rather
arise under California Labor Code sections 1182.12, 98.1, 248.5, 1194.2, and
2802, as well as California common law. Petitioner contends the CBA is silent
on the issue of stipend pay, i.e., monthly salary, for officers and her claim
arises from state law rights to be paid for work performed. In fact, Petitioner
contends Respondent overstepped the CBA and Constitution by refusing to pay her
for work performed. The release time provisions are irrelevant to whether
Petitioner was owed wages because Respondent could have taken away her release
time while still owing her wages. 
 
The Court finds that Respondent’s record does not show that Petitioner’s
claims are preempted by the LMRA. Respondent’s own statement of Petitioner’s
claims limits the issue to Respondent’s removal of Petitioner’s discretionary
stipend. “Appellant’s claims stem from the removal of her discretionary
stipend” and “The claims that AFT owes Appellant any compensation is
exclusively based on the termination of the discretionary stipend the Union
provided.” (Motion, p. 5:5, 5:16-17.) The record presented by Respondent does
not show how payment or removal of the stipend falls under the language of the
CBA or Constitution. Instead, it only shows that payment of the stipend began
sometime before 2019. (Motion, Separate Statement, Fact No. 12; Deutsche Decl.
at 1:04:58-1:06:04.) The Motion obliquely references Petitioner’s claim as
including the removal of her release time but does not clearly explain how the
release time pertains to the wages sought by Petitioner. Respondent contends
that if Petitioner was given a monthly stipend it follows that she was no
longer released from her duties with the District. Yet Respondent’s own
evidence shows it was paying Petitioner the monthly stipend from before 2019,
during which time she was also released from her District duties since both
were removed simultaneously effective May 23, 2019. (Motion, Separate
Statement, Fact Nos. 12-13; Deutsche Decl. at Exh. A at 1:04:58 and 1:07:43;
Smith Decl. at Exh. C.) Finally, to the extent that Respondent argues
Petitioner was not its employee as demonstrated by the CBA and Constitution, no
facts in support of this argument are provided in the separate statement. 
 
Record Regarding Wages to Which Petitioner is Entitled
 
Respondent also argues that if the Court does not find
Respondent’s claims are preempted by the LMRA, it should find that Petitioner
is only entitled to 11 days of wages based on the time she was actually
available to work. In support of this, Respondent relies on the terms of the
CBA regarding District employees reporting absences and the District’s tracking
of employees’ sick, vacation, and other leave time. (Motion, Separate
Statement, Fact Nos. 7; Smith Decl., at Exh. A, Art. 6.) The cited article of
the CBA, however, does not mention the reporting of absences. Nor does the
separate statement mention how the District’s tracking of employees’ sick,
vacation, or other leave time relates to Respondent’s payment of the monthly
stipend. Ultimately, Respondent provides only a confusing and improperly cited
record on which it relies in support of this argument, which fails to
demonstrate the Court should make a finding regarding the amount of wages
Petitioner is owed.
