ANALYSIS:
 
On September 21, 2023, Petitioners Adam Cnaani and Sapir
Cnaani (“Petitioners”) filed the instant Petition to Compel Arbitration against
Respondent Shari Baier (“Respondent”).
The Court set the Petition for hearing on January 25, 2024 and ordered
Petitioner to give notice of the hearing date. (Notice of Hearing, 9/21/23.) On
January 25, 2024, the Court determined service of the Petition and notice of
hearing had not been effectuated as required by statute and continued the
matter to April 25, 2024. (Minute Order, 01/25/24.) 
 
Petitioners filed a Notice of Hearing and Proof of Personal
Service on March 4, 2024 and March 7, 2024, respectively. To date, no response
to the Petition has been filed.
 
Discussion
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 1281, et seq. states in
relevant part: 
 
On petition of a party to an
arbitration agreement alleging the existence of a written agreement to
arbitrate a controversy and that a party thereto refuses to arbitrate such
controversy, the court shall order the petitioner and the respondent to arbitrate
the controversy if it determines that an agreement to arbitrate the controversy
exists, unless it determines that:
 
(a) The right to compel arbitration has
been waived by the petitioner; or 
(b) Grounds exist for the revocation of
the agreement.
(c) A party to the arbitration
agreement is also a party to a pending court action or special proceeding with
a third party, arising out of the same transaction or series of related
transactions and there is a possibility of conflicting rulings on a common issue
of law or fact. . . . 
(d) The petitioner is a state or
federally chartered depository institution . . . .
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.2, subds. (a)-(d).) Petitioners
provide evidence of the existence of the arbitration agreement in the
California Residential Purchase Agreement. (Pet., Oder Decl., Exh. A, ¶31.) The
arbitration provision provides: “[t]he Parties agree that any dispute or claim
in Law or equity arising between them out of this Agreement or any resulting
transaction, which is not settled through mediation, shall be decided by
neutral, binding arbitration.” (Ibid.) The parties unsuccessfully
mediated the dispute on February 16, 2023. (Id. at Exh. C.) Despite
Petitioners’ attempt to obtain Respondent’s cooperation for arbitration,
Respondent has refused to participate. (Id. at ¶6 and Exh. D.) This
demonstrates that both requirements to compel arbitration are satisfied. The
burden now shifts to Respondent to demonstrate waiver of the right to
arbitration by Petitioners or grounds for the revocation of the arbitration
agreement. 
 
As no opposition has been filed, however, no grounds have
been shown to demonstrate waiver of the right to arbitrate or revocation of the
arbitration agreement.
 
 
 
Conclusion
 
Therefore, Petitioners Adam Cnaani and Sapir Cnaani’s
Petition to Compel Arbitration is GRANTED. THE ACTION IS STAYED PENDING
ARBITRATION. AN ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE RE: STATUS OF ARBITRATION IS SET FOR JULY
25, 2024 AT 8:30 AM IN DEPARTMENT 26 IN THE SPRING STREET COURTHOUSE.
