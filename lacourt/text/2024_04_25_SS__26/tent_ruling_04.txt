ANALYSIS:
 
On January 16, 2024, Plaintiff Insook Kim Kawakami
(“Plaintiff”) served Form Interrogatories, Set One, on Defendants James Joung
Hyen Lee and Hyen Uk Lee (“Defendants”). (Motion,
Kawakami Decl., Exh. 1.) Despite a meet-and-confer effort extending the
deadline to serve verified responses without objections, Defendant has not
served responses. (Id. at ¶¶5-6 and Exh. 2.) Plaintiff filed the instant
(1) Motion to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, and Request
for Sanctions; and (2) Motion to Compel Responses to Requests for Admission,
Set One, and Request for Sanctions on March 20, 2024. No opposition has been
filed to date.
 
Form Interrogatories, Set One
 
There is no requirement for a prior meet and confer effort
before a motion to compel initial responses can be filed. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290.) Further, the motion can be brought any time after the responding
party fails to provide the responses. 
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290.) Based on Defendants’ failure to timely
respond to the propounded discovery, Plaintiff is entitled to an order
compelling them to serve verified responses to the discovery requests without
objections. 
 
Defendants’ failure to timely respond constitutes a misuse
of the discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d).) Sanctions
are appropriate under Code of Civil Procedure sections 2023.010 and 2023.030
and have been properly noticed. While “[a] pro se litigant cannot recover
attorney’s fees as a discovery sanction, [] he can recover the ‘reasonable
expenses’ he has ‘incurred,’ including photocopying, computer-assisted legal
research, and other identifiable and allocable costs.”  (Kravitz
v. Superior Court (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 1015, 1017.) Sanctions
are awarded against Defendants in the amount of $100.00. (Motion, Kawakammi Decl., ¶7.)

 
Requests for Admission,
Set One
 
Plaintiff provides no legal
authority that allows the Court to compel initial responses to requests for
admission. The Motion cites Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.290, which
only pertains to interrogatories. Therefore, the request to compel responses to
Requests for Admission, Set One and Request for Sanctions is denied. 
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff Insook Kim Kawakami’s Motion to Compel Responses
to Form Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for Sanctions, is GRANTED. DEFENDANTS JAMES JOUNG HYEN
LEE AND HYEN UK LEE ARE TO SERVE
VERIFIED RESPONSES TO FORM INTERROGATORIES, SET ONE, WITHOUT OBJECTIONS, WITHIN
20 DAYS’ SERVICE OF THIS ORDER. DEFENDANTS ARE FURTHER ORDERED TO PAY SANCTIONS OF $100.00 TO PLAINTIFF
WITHIN 20 DAYS’ SERVICE OF THIS ORDER.
 
Plaintiff Insook Kim Kawakami’s Motion to Compel Responses
to Requests for Admission, Set One, and Request for Sanctions, is DENIED.
