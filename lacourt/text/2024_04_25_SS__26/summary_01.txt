And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The respondent, AFT College Staff Guild Local 1521A, has moved for summary judgment, arguing that the petitioner, Velma Butler, is not entitled to wages for work performed. The court finds that the respondent's record does not show that the petitioner's claims are preempted by the Labor Management Relations Act. The court also finds that the respondent's argument that the petitioner is only entitled to 11 days of wages is not supported by the record. Therefore, the respondent's motion for summary judgment is denied.
