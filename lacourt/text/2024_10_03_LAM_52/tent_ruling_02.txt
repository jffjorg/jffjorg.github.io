 Case Number:  23STCV27751    Hearing Date:   October 3, 2024    Dept:  52 Tentative Ruling
(1) Order to Show Cause Re: Default
Judgment; (2) Order to Show Cause Re: Why Plaintiff Should Not Pay $100 in
Sanctions Under Rule 3.110(h)
On August 6, 2024, the court set an order to show cause re: why
plaintiff Charlotte Duh should not pay
$100 in sanctions under rule 3.110(h). 
Plaintiff did not file a timely response to the order to show cause.
The court will impose $100 in sanctions against
plaintiff.  California Rules of Court, rule 3.110(h) provides, “When a default is entered, the party
who requested the entry of default must obtain a default judgment against the
defaulting party within 45 days after the default was entered, unless the court
has granted an extension of time.  The
court may issue an order to show cause why sanctions should not be imposed if
that party fails to obtain entry of judgment against a defaulting party or to
request an extension of time to apply for a default judgment within that time.”
Plaintiff Charlotte Duh filed a complaint against
defendant Angie Chou.  The clerk entered
Chou’s default on April 24, 2024.  More
than 150 days have passed.  Plaintiff still
has not filed a request for court judgment by default.  Plaintiff did not obtain an extension of time
to apply for default judgment.  Monetary
sanctions are appropriate under the circumstances.  
The court hereby orders plaintiff
Charlotte Duh to pay $100 in sanctions to the court under California Rules of
Court, rule 3.110(h), within 15 days.
            The order to show cause re: default
judgment is hereby continued to December
6, 2024, at 8:30 a.m.
