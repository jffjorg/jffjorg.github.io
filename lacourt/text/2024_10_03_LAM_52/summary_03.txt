- The court must consider whether the contract was adhesive, and whether circumstances of the contract's formation created such oppression or surprise that closer scrutiny of its overall fairness is required.
- A nonsignatory plaintiff can be compelled to arbitrate a claim even against a nonsignatory defendant, when the claim is itself based on, or inextricably intertwined with, the contract containing the arbitration clause.
- The scope of the arbitration provision must be liberally construed, and doubts as to whether the agreement applies to a particular dispute are to be resolved in favor of sending the parties to arbitration.

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion to compel arbitration and stay the action. The plaintiffs, Ryan Witt and Asclepius Enterprises Inc., had alleged fraud in the inducement, unconscionability, and that some claims fall outside the scope of the arbitration provision. However, the judge has ruled that the arbitration agreement must be respected even with regard to claims of fraud in the inducement, and that the burden of proving unconscionability rests upon the party asserting it.

The judge has also determined that the contract was not adhesive, and that the circumstances of the contract's formation did not create such oppression or surprise that closer scrutiny of its overall fairness is required. Furthermore, the judge has ruled that a nonsignatory plaintiff can be compelled to arbitrate a claim even against a nonsignatory defendant, when the claim is itself based on, or inextricably intertwined with, the contract containing the arbitration clause.

The scope of the arbitration provision must be liberally construed, and doubts as to whether the agreement applies to a particular dispute are to be resolved in favor of sending the parties to arbitration. The judge has ordered the plaintiffs to arbitrate this action against the defendants, and has stayed the entire action pending resolution of the arbitration proceeding.
