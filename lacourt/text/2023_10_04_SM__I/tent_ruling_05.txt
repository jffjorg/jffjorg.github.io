 Case Number:  23SMCV04202    Hearing Date:   October 4, 2023    Dept:  I The court is inclined to GRANT the request for a receiver
and TRO given that the parties have stipulated to it.  The court will want to be sure that no third
party opposes it or has an interest in the case or the property such that they
ought to be heard.  The court will also
ask if there are any other lienholders or people with a secured interest
because plaintiff is purportedly being given “super” priority and the court is
not sure it can overcome a senior lienholder.
