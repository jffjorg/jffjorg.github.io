And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the case and rendered a tentative ruling. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant has taken actions to force him to leave his home, including blaring loud music and displaying guns in a visible manner. The plaintiff claims that these actions are a nuisance, assault, interference with prospective economic advantage, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and harassment. The defendant demurred to all causes of action except nuisance.

The judge agrees with the defendant that the second cause of action, assault, is insufficiently pleaded. The judge also agrees with the defendant that the third cause of action, interference with prospective economic advantage, is insufficiently pleaded.

However, the judge agrees with the plaintiff that the fourth cause of action, intentional infliction of emotional distress, is sufficiently pleaded. The judge finds that the allegations of severe emotional distress are sufficient to constitute the tort.

The judge also notes that the plaintiff has 30 days to amend the complaint. If the plaintiff elects not to amend, the defendant has 30 days to answer the complaint.
