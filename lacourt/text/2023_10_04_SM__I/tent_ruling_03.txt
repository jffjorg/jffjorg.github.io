 Case Number:  23SMCV01418    Hearing Date:   October 4, 2023    Dept:  I The court is aware that today is the date set for
argument.  However, the court is in trial
and cannot devote the time necessary for argument until the trial
concludes.  The court will set the matter
out about 30 days, although the court is likely simply to rule from chambers
given the briefing received to date.  The
court will give all parties as much notice as possible of the specifics, and if
the date given is not convenient for a party, the court will work with counsel
to find a date that works should a hearing be necessary.  The court apologizes to the parties for the inconvenience.
