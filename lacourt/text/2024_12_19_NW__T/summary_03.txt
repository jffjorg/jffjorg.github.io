And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company's motion to strike portions of Sargis Khachikyan's First Amended Complaint is denied. The motion sought to strike punitive damages and attorneys' fees requested in the complaint.

The judge found that the allegations in the complaint were sufficient to support a claim for punitive damages, citing a previous California Court of Appeal case, Fleming v. Safeco Ins. Co. The judge noted that State Farm's delay in investigating the Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist (UM) claim, combined with its repetitive and unnecessary demands for information, was sufficient to allege that State Farm did not investigate the claim despite its claims of ongoing investigation.

The judge also found that the plaintiff's request for attorneys' fees was sufficient, despite State Farm's argument that the request failed to plead facts to form the basis for the fees request. The judge noted that the plaintiff had added new fact pleading to show an excuse why a contract provision could not be expressly alleged to support the demand for attorneys' fees, and that this allegation was sufficient to survive the motion to strike.

The judge ordered State Farm to file its answer to the First Amended Complaint within 20 days.
