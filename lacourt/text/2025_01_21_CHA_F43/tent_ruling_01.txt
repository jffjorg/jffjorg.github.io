SUMMARY OF ACTION
Plaintiff Juan Ayala (Plaintiff) filed this
action against defendants County of Los Angeles (Defendant), City of Los
Angeles, State of California, Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department, and
Pitchess Detention Center on June 5, 2023, alleging causes of action for
general negligence and premises liability. 
On August 28, 2024, Defendant propounded on Plaintiff Form
Interrogatories, Set Two numbers 35-50 and an additional discovery declaration.  The parties agreed to three deadline extensions
for responses.  Plaintiff never served
responses.
 
Defendant filed this motion to compel
responses to Form Interrogatories, Set Two on December 4, 2024.  No opposition has been filed.
 
MEET AND CONFER
A motion to compel interrogatory responses
must include a declaration stating facts showing a “reasonable and good faith
attempt” to resolve the issues mentioned in the motion before filing.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300, subd. (b),
2016.040.)
 
After Defendant’s counsel sent a meet and
confer letter on October 4, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel replied on October 7,
2024 stating Plaintiff would serve objection-free responses by October 21,
2024.  (Declaration of Kari C. Kadomatsu,
¶¶ 4-5, Exhs. B, C.)  On October 25,
2024, Plaintiff’s counsel sent responses to Defendant’s other discovery
requests but not Form Interrogatories, Set Two. 
(Kadomatsu Dec., ¶ 6, Exh. D.) 
That same day, Defendant’s counsel asked Plaintiff’s counsel to send
responses by October 26, 2024.  (Kadomatsu
Dec., Exh. D, a p. 2.)  Plaintiff’s
counsel stated the responses were late due to an unforeseen medical emergency,
and Defendant’s counsel agreed to extend Plaintiff’s deadline to respond to
November 1, 2024.  (Ibid.)  Plaintiff did not submit responses by
November 1, 2024.  On November 5, 2024,
Defendant’s counsel sent an email advising he planned to file a motion to
compel.  (Kadomatsu Dec., ¶ 7, Exh. E, at
p.1.)  That same day, counsel spoke on
the phone, and Plaintiff’s counsel agreed to serve objection-free responses no
later than November 19, 2024.  (Kadomatsu
Dec., ¶ 7.)  After not receiving
responses by the November 19th deadline, Defendant’s counsel sent emails on
November 25, 2024 and December 2, 2024 regarding Plaintiff’s failure to respond
and informed Plaintiff’s counsel that Defendant would file a motion to compel
and request sanctions.  (Kadomatsu Dec.,
¶ 8, Exh. F.)  Plaintiff has yet to serve
responses.
 
ANALYSIS
A propounding party may move to compel
responses to form interrogatories where the responding party fails to provide
any responses. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (b).)  The propounding party must show the interrogatories
were properly served, that the time to respond expired, and no response has
been served. (Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902,
905-906.)  The responding party must
serve responses within 30 days after the interrogatories are served or
according to an agreed upon deadline extension. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.270.) 
Failing to respond within these time limits waives objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).)
 
Defendant has shown that it properly served
Plaintiff on August 28, 2024.  Plaintiffs
did not serve responses by the original September 27, 2024 deadline or any of
Defendant’s subsequent deadline extensions. 
As of December 4, 2024, Plaintiff has not served responses.
 
Accordingly, the Court orders Plaintiff to
serve code-compliant, objection-free responses to Defendant’s Form
Interrogatories, Set Two.
 
            Sanctions         
The Court may impose sanctions against any
party who “unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel responses to
interrogatories unless, it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (c).)
 
Defendant requests $750.00 in monetary
sanctions against Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel.  Defendant’s counsel, Kari C. Kadomatsu,
charges an hourly rate of $250.00. 
(Kadomatsu Dec., ¶ 10.)  The
request includes the following: (1) 1 hour preparing the motion—$250.00; and
(2) 2 hours to respond and to attend the hearing—$500.00.  (Ibid.)
 
The Court finds the hourly rates are
reasonable, and the proposed time is unreasonable.  Because Plaintiff has not filed an
opposition, the time Mr. Kadomatsu anticipates spending replying to an
opposition is reduced to 0 hours.
 
Accordingly, the Court grants Defendant’s
request for sanctions in the reduced amount of $500.00: (1) 1 hour preparing
this motion; and (2) 1 hour attending the motion hearing.

(20) days of the date of this order.
