And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted the Defendant's motion to compel responses to Form Interrogatories, Set Two. The Plaintiff, Juan Ayala, has failed to serve responses to the interrogatories despite multiple deadline extensions. The Judge has ordered the Plaintiff to serve code-compliant, objection-free responses within 20 days of the order.

The Judge has also awarded the Defendant $500.00 in sanctions for the Plaintiff's failure to respond. The Judge found that the hourly rates proposed by the Defendant's counsel were reasonable, but the proposed time spent on the motion was unreasonable.

The Judge's order requires the Plaintiff to serve responses within 20 days and pay the sanctions within 20 days. The Defendant is required to give notice of the order.
