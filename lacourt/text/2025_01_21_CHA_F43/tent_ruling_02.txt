SUMMARY
OF ACTION
On
March 31, 2023, Plaintiffs Vina Nota Gumayagay and Carlos Martinez (Plaintiffs)
leased a 2023 Honda Ridgeline.  The
vehicle began experiencing several mechanical defects, and Plaintiffs sued
defendant American Honda Motor Company, Inc. (Honda) for violating the
Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act, alleging that Honda was unable to repair
the defects and that Honda did not replace the car or make restitution.  The complaint alleges causes of action for
breach of express warranty, breach of implied warranty, and a Song-Beverly violation.  
 
On
February 20, 2024, Plaintiffs served a Notice of Deposition of Honda’s Person
Most Knowledgeable (PMK) detailing 34 Matters for Examination and containing 16
written Requests for Production of documents at the deposition.  (Declaration of Chris Grigoryan, ¶ 15, Exh. 1.)  The deposition was noticed for March 12,
2024.  (Ibid.)  On March 8, 2024, Honda served objections to
the deposition notice and did not provide a PMK witness or alternative
dates.  (Grigoryan Dec., ¶ 16, Exh. 2.)  
 
On
April 25, 2024, Plaintiffs served an amended deposition notice with 34 Matters
of Examination and 16 written Requests for Production of documents, and a
deposition date of May 8, 2024. 
(Grigoryan Dec., ¶ 17, Exh. 3.) 
On May 10, 2024, Honda served objections to the amended notice and did
not provide a PMK witness or alternative dates. 
(Grigoryan Dec., ¶ 18, Exh. 4.)
 
Plaintiffs
served a second amended deposition notice on May 20, 2024 with the same matters
of examination and requests for production, for a deposition on June 6,
2024.  (Grigoryan Dec., ¶ 19, Exh.
5.)  On June 3, 2024, Honda served
objections to the notice and did not provide alternative dates.  (Grigoryan Dec., ¶ 20, Exh. 6.)  
 
On
June 10, 2024, Plaintiffs filed this motion to compel the deposition of Honda’s
PMK and production of documents.  On
January 13, 2025, Plaintiffs filed a notice of non-opposition.  
 
Honda
filed an opposition on January 15, 2025.[1]  Honda states it filed a late opposition
because it anticipated Plaintiffs would withdraw their motion after Honda
offered to reschedule the PMK deposition to April 2025, the Opposition deadline
was mis-calendared, and Honda’s counsel was forced to evacuate due to the Los
Angeles fires.  (Declaration of Scott D.
Sharp, ¶¶ 10-12.)
 
No
reply has been filed.
 
MEET
AND CONFER
A
motion to compel a deposition must include either a meet and confer declaration
or, “when the deponent fails to attend the deposition and produce the
documents, electronically stored information, or things described in the
deposition notice, . . . a declaration stating that the petitioner has
contacted the deponent to inquire about the nonappearance.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2025.450, subd. (b),
2016.040.)
 
On
April 25, 2024, Plaintiffs’ counsel sent Honda’s counsel a meet and confer
letter about the PMK deposition to avoid court intervention.  (Grigoryan Dec., ¶ 21, Exh. 7.)  Plaintiffs’ counsel acknowledged Honda’s
objections, re-noticed the deposition, and asked Honda to provide alternative
dates.  (Grigoryan Dec., ¶ 21, Exh.
7.)  Plaintiffs’ counsel sent another
meet and confer letter on May 20, 2024. 
(Grigoryan Dec., ¶ 22, Exh. 8.) 
Honda did not provide a reasonable response.
 
Honda
states the parties have not met and conferred according to the Court’s
Song-Beverly Discovery Order.  Honda’s
counsel states he contacted Plaintiffs’ counsel via telephone and email on July
3, 2024 offering a PMK deposition on January 15, 2025.  (Declaration of Scott D. Sharp, ¶ 6.)  After receiving no response, Honda followed
up with multiple email correspondences.  On
September 11, 2024, Plaintiffs rejected the January 15th date because of
unavailability and asked for April 2025 dates. 
(Sharp Dec., ¶¶ 7-8, Exhs. D, E.) 
On September 12, 2024, Honda’s counsel emailed Plaintiffs’ counsel stating
Honda would provide April 2025 dates and asked Plaintiffs to continue the
motion to compel until May 2025, after the deposition.  (Sharp Dec., ¶ 9, Exh. D.)  Honda’s counsel sent another email on October
30, 2024 to confirm that Plaintiffs would continue the motion.  (Sharp Dec., Exh. E.)  Honda’s counsel states that on January 15,
2025, Plaintiffs agreed to continue the motion. 
(Sharp Dec., ¶ 9.)
 
The
Court has reviewed the documents related to this motion and will not decide the
motion on the merits at this time due to the insufficiency of the meet and
confer process.  Although the moving
papers indicate that several meet and confer letters and emails were sent prior
to Plaintiffs filing their motion, the parties do not present evidence that
they met and conferred telephonically or via video conference as required by
the Court’s Song-Beverly Discovery Order. 
There also seems to be confusion about whether Plaintiffs agreed to
continue this motion until May 2025. 
 
The
Court orders the parties to meet and confer directly, not by email or letter.  Additionally, the parties are ordered to file
a joint statement of remaining issues by a date to be set by the Court. The
joint statement should briefly describe the matters in dispute, followed by Plaintiffs’
arguments, then Honda’s arguments.
 
ORDER
1.  The parties are ordered to conduct a
meaningful meet and confer in person, by telephone, or by video conference, not
by email or letter. 
 
2.  The parties shall submit a joint statement of
the remaining issues as described above. 
The format should be as follows: the parties should recite the specific
discovery request at issue, followed by the moving party’s statement of why it
should be compelled, followed by the opposing party’s statement of why it
should not be compelled.  To the extent
that an argument is repeated for a subsequent request, the party shall simply
refer to the section where the argument was previously made. 
 
3.  The dates for the status report and continued
hearings will be set at the hearing on this motion.  
 
Plaintiffs
to give notice.
