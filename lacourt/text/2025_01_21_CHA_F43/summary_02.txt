Roles:
  - Judge
  - Plaintiffs (Vina Nota Gumayagay and Carlos Martinez)
  - Defendant (American Honda Motor Co., Inc.)
  - Parties' counsel (Chris Grigoryan and Scott D. Sharp)

Significant Statements:
  - "The Court has reviewed the documents related to this motion and will not decide the motion on the merits at this time due to the insufficiency of the meet and confer process."
  - "Although the moving papers indicate that several meet and confer letters and emails were sent prior to Plaintiffs filing their motion, the parties do not present evidence that they met and conferred telephonically or via video conference as required by the Court's Song-Beverly Discovery Order."
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has ordered the parties to meet and confer directly to resolve their disputes, rather than through email or letter. The parties are also required to file a joint statement of remaining issues, which should include a brief description of the matters in dispute, followed by the parties' arguments. The judge has not decided the motion on the merits due to the insufficient meet and confer process.
