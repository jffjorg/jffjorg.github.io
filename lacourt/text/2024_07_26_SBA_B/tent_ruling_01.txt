RULING
The

Plaintiff
Martin Hutto is ordered to serve further responses to defendant’s Special
Interrogatories, Set One, Nos. 47, 49, 54, 56, 58, 60, 62, 64, 67, 73, 84, 86,
and 90 and to defendant’s Request for Production of Documents, Nos. 1-2, 5-7,
14-25, 27-37, 39-40, 42-43, 45-49, 51-53, 58, and 60 within twenty days.
BACKGROUND
On April 19, 2023, plaintiff Martin
Hutto filed a complaint against City of Torrance and Torrance Police Department
for (1) violation of POBRA, (2) declaratory relief, and (3) Labor Code §1102.5.
On April 25, 2023, the court (Judge
Frank) issued a TRO on April 25, 2023.
On September 15, 2023, the court
issued a preliminary injunction.
LEGAL AUTHORITY
45-Day Rule: 
This motion must be served within 45 days after service of the response
in question (extended if served by mail, overnight delivery, or fax; see CCP
§1013); otherwise, the demanding party waives the right to compel any further
response to the CCP §2031.010 demand. 
CCP §§2031.310(c), 2016.050; see Sperber
v. Robinson (1994) 26 Cal. App. 4th 736, 745.  The 45-day time limit is mandatory and
jurisdictional.  Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58 Cal. App. 4th 1403, 1410.  The parties, however, can also agree in
writing on a specific later date by which to file the motion to compel.  CCP §2031.310(c). 
Meet-and-Confer Requirement: 
The motion to compel further responses must be accompanied by a
declaration showing “a reasonable and good faith attempt” to resolve the issues
outside of court (so-called “meet and confer”). 
CCP §§2016.040, 2031.310(b)(2).
Separate Statement: 
Any motion involving the content of a discovery request or the responses
to such a request shall be accompanied by a separate statement.  This includes a motion to compel further
responses to demand for inspection of documents or tangible things.  CRC Rule 3.1020(a)(3).  
Interrogatories
CCP §2030.300 states:  “(a) On receipt of a response to
interrogatories, the propounding party may move for an order compelling a
further response if the propounding party deems that any of the following
apply:   (1) An answer to a particular
interrogatory is evasive or incomplete. . . . (3) An objection to an
interrogatory is without merit or too general. 
(b) A motion under subdivision (a) shall be accompanied by a meet and
confer declaration under Section 2016.040. (c) Unless notice of this motion is
given within 45 days of the service of the verified response, or any
supplemental verified response, or on or before any specific later date to
which the propounding party and the responding party have agreed in writing,
the propounding party waives any right to compel a further response to the
interrogatories. . . .”
CCP §2030.220 states:  “(a) Each answer in a response to
interrogatories shall be as complete and straightforward as the information
reasonably available to the responding party permits.  (b) If an interrogatory cannot be answered
completely, it shall be answered to the extent possible.  (c) If the responding party does not have
personal knowledge sufficient to respond fully to an interrogatory, that party
shall so state, but shall make a reasonable and good faith effort to obtain the
information by inquiry to other natural persons or organizations, except where
the information is equally available to the propounding party.”
CCP
§2030.230 states:  “If the answer to an
interrogatory would necessitate the preparation or the making of a compilation,
abstract, audit, or summary of or from the documents of the party to whom the
interrogatory is directed, and if the burden or expense of preparing or making
it would be substantially the same for the party propounding the interrogatory
as for the responding party, it is a sufficient answer to that interrogatory to
refer to this section and to specify the writings from which the answer may be
derived or ascertained. . . .”
CCP §2030.010(b)
provides:  “An interrogatory may relate
to whether another party is making a certain contention, or to the facts,
witnesses, and writings on which a contention is based.  An interrogatory is not objectionable because
an answer to it involves an opinion or contention that relates to fact or the
application of law to fact, or would be based on 
information obtained or legal theories developed in
anticipation of litigation or in preparation for 
trial.”
Request for Production of Documents
On receipt of a response to an
inspection demand, the demanding party may move for an order compelling further
responses to the demand if the demanding party deems that any of the following
apply:  (1) a statement of compliance
with the demand is incomplete; (2) a representation of inability to comply is
inadequate, incomplete, or evasive; or (3) an objection in the response is
without merit or too general.  CCP §
2031.310(a).
A statement of compliance shall
state that the production, inspection, and related activity demanded will be
allowed either in whole or in part, and that all documents or things in the
demanded category that are in the possession, custody, or control of that party
and to which no objection is being made will be included in the
production.  CCP § 2031.220.  
“A representation of inability to
comply with [a] particular demand for inspection . . . shall affirm that a
diligent search and reasonable inquiry has been made in an effort to comply
with that demand.  This statement shall
also specify whether the inability to comply is because the particular item or
category has never existed, has been destroyed, has been lost, misplaced, or
stolen, or has never been, or is no longer, in the possession, custody, or control
of the responding party.  This statement
shall set forth the name and address of any natural person or organization
known or believed by that party to have possession, custody, or control of that
item or category of item.”  CCP §
2031.230. 
A motion to compel further response
to requests for production “shall set forth specific facts showing good cause
justifying the discovery sought by the inspection demand.”  CCP § 2031.310(b)(1).  “To establish ‘good cause,’ the burden is on
the moving party to show both:  [1] Relevance to the subject matter (e.g.,
how the information in the documents would tend to prove or disprove some issue
in the case); and [2] Specific facts justifying discovery
(e.g., why such information is necessary for trial preparation or to prevent
surprise at trial).  The fact that there
is no alternative source for the
information sought is an important factor in establishing ‘good cause’ for
inspection.  But it is not essential in every case.”  Weil & Brown, Civil Procedure Before Trial, 8:1495.6 (citations omitted).  “Declarations are generally used to show the
requisite ‘good cause’ for an order to compel inspection.  The declarations must contain ‘specific facts’
rather than mere conclusions.”  Id. at 8:1495.7 (citation omitted).  “The declarations may be on information and
belief, if necessary.  However, in such
cases, the ‘specific facts’ supporting such information and belief (the sources
of the information) must also be alleged.” 
Id. at 8:1495.8 (citation
omitted).  “Most declarations are made by
the attorney for the moving party, who is usually more familiar with the
relevancy and ‘specific facts’ constituting ‘good cause’ for inspection.”  Id.
at 8:1495.9.
“If ‘good cause’ is shown by the moving
party, the burden is then on the responding party to justify any objections
made to document disclosure (the same as on motions to compel answers to
interrogatories or deposition questions. . . ).”  Id.
at 8:1496 (citation omitted).
DISCUSSION
            Defendant
City of Torrance requests that the Court compel plaintiff to respond further to
Special Interrogatories, Set One, Nos. 47, 49, 54, 56, 58, 60, 62, 64, 67, 73,
84, 86, and 90 and Request for Production of Documents, Set One, Nos. 1-2, 5-7,
14-25, 27-37, 39-40, 42-43, 45-49, 51-53, 58, and 60.  The Court notes only the requests that remain
at issue based on the reply.  In the
reply, the City withdrew its motion as to Special Interrogatories, Nos. 1-46,
48, 50-53, 55, 57, 59-59, 61, 63, 65-66, 68-72, 74, 83, 85, 87-89, and 91-102
and Requests for Production of Documents, Nos. 3-4, 8-13, 26, 38, 41, 44, 50,
and 54-57 based on plaintiff providing supplemental responses.
            On
December 19, 2023, defendant served its discovery requests.  On February 12, 2024, plaintiff served
responses and objections.
On July
1, 2024, pursuant to joint stipulation and order, the hearing on the motions
was continued to allow the parties to reach a stipulation regarding the
discovery and use in the litigation of plaintiff’s confidential police officer
personnel records and information, and protective order, without the need for a
noticed Pitchess motion. 
            The
complaint alleges that that plaintiff was investigated and given educational
reminders in connection with two arrests he made.  Plaintiff apprehended suspects in a catalytic
converter theft on May 17, 2021 and commented to one of the arrestees, “Welcome
to Torrance.”  Plaintiff was investigated
for the comment and invoked his rights under the Public Safety Officers
Procedural Bill of Rights Act (POBRA) and/or the Meyers-Milias Brown Act,
including use of a representative of his choice.  Defendants ultimately concluded the investigation
and gave plaintiff an educational reminder for misconduct based on the “Welcome
to Torrance” comment.
Plaintiff arrested a suspect who was disturbing the
peace on March 4, 2022.  During the
arrest, 
plaintiff used force against the suspect, who
ultimately stabbed plaintiff’s partner in the clavicle 
area with a pen and struck plaintiff in the head.  Plaintiff was administratively investigated
for his use of force during the arrest.  Defendant
ultimately concluded that plaintiff should be given an educational reminder to
be more thorough in his reports of use of force.  Plaintiff filed a personnel complaint against
Chief Hart for inappropriate comments and social media posts on November 2,
2022.  Plaintiff alleges Torrance Police
Department revived the Internal Affairs investigation against him after his
complaint.  Plaintiff alleges defendants
violated his rights under POBRA, including by failing to provide proper notice
of the nature of the investigations, subjecting plaintiff to punitive action
and/or threatening him with punitive action for exercising his rights under
POBRA and placing comments adverse to his interest in his personnel file.
Plaintiff also alleges that defendants committed whistleblower retaliation in
response to his complaints about Chief Hart’s inappropriate comments and social
media posts.
 
            Special
interrogatories
            Defendant
contends that Special Interrogatories, Nos. 47, 49, 54, 56, 58, 60, 62, 64, 67,
73, 84, 86, and 90 remain at issue because they do not implicate confidential
peace officer personnel information and that plaintiff’s Pitchess objections
are without merit.  Defendant also argues
that plaintiff’s response to Nos. 60, 62, 64, 73, 84, 86, and 90 directing
defendant to other documents is improper under CCP §2030.230 because the
interrogatories do not necessitate the preparation or the making of a
compilation, abstract, audit, or summary of or from.
In the
opposition, plaintiff contends that the discovery requests were improperly
served because they were sent via email although the parties had not stipulated
to email service.  Plaintiff also argues
that the motion was filed untimely on April 2, 2024.
            In
reply, defendant contends that its discovery requests were properly
electronically served pursuant to CRC Rule 2.251(c).  Moreover, defendant argues, the motion was
timely filed on April 2, 2024 because April 1 was a court holiday.
            The
Court finds that the request was properly served and that the motion was timely
filed. The Court also finds that plaintiff’s objections lack merit, including
based on Pitchess.  The remaining special
interrogatories at issue do not implicate Pitchess for the reasons argued by
defendant.  Further, plaintiff’s
responses under CCP §2030.230 are improper.
            The
motion is thus GRANTED.
 
            Requests
for production of documents
            Defendant
asserts that Request for Production of Documents, Set One, Nos. 1-2, 5-7,
14-25, 27-37, 39-40, 42-43, 45-49, 51-53, 58, and 60 remain at issue.
Defendant
argues that as to the remaining requests, plaintiff has failed to state whether
plaintiff possesses additional documents that do not constitute protected
police officer personnel records and information and has failed to produce any
such non-Pitchess record documents, in compliance with CCP §2031.240.  Under CCP §2031.240, “(a) If only part of an
item or category of item in a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or
sampling is objectionable, the response shall contain a statement of compliance,
or a representation of inability to comply with respect to the remainder of
that item or category.”  Defendant argues
that even if Pitchess applies to any responsive peace officer personnel
records, plaintiff still has the ability to either identify and produce any
non-personnel records and information, or state he cannot comply because he has
no records.  Further, defendant asserts,
the City is entitled to obtain documents within plaintiff’s possession,
custody, or control, irrespective of whether the City may already possess or
have access to them, citing to CCP §2031.010. 
Defendant further argues that plaintiff’s objections that certain
defined terms (communication, relate, and refer) are overly broad and ambiguous
are without merit because none of the City’s requests utilize the defined term
“communication” and only Request Nos. 54-60 include “refer” or “relate,” and
such requests are limited in scope.  
            In
opposition, plaintiff argues that a Pitchess motion was and is required as the
requests seek personnel files.  Plaintiff
also argues that the requests were improperly served via email and that the
motion was untimely filed.
            The
Court finds that the requests were properly served, and the motion was timely
filed.  The Court also finds that
plaintiff’s responses do not comply with CCP §2031.240 and that plaintiff’s
objections lack merit as to non-Pitchess documents.
            The
motion is GRANTED.
 
Sanctions
Under CCP § 2023.030(a), “[t]he
court may impose a monetary sanction ordering that one engaging in the misuse
of the discovery process, or any attorney advising that conduct, or both pay
the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a
result of that conduct. . . . If a monetary sanction is authorized by any
provision of this title, the court shall impose that sanction unless it finds
that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or
that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  Under CCP § 2023.010, an example of the
misuse of the discovery process is “(d) Failing to respond or to submit to an
authorized method of discovery.” 
Sanctions are mandatory in
connection with motions to compel further responses against any party, person,
or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel unless the
court “finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust.”  CCP § §2030.300(d),
2031.310(h).
Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1348(a)
states:  “The court may award sanctions
under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel
discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to
the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving
party after the motion was filed.” 
            The
Court denies each party’s request for sanctions.

The
motions are GRANTED.

Martin Hutto is ordered to serve further responses to defendant’s Special
Interrogatories, Set One, Nos. 47, 49, 54, 56, 58, 60, 62, 64, 67, 73, 84, 86,
and 90 and to defendant’s Request for Production of Documents, Nos. 1-2, 5-7,
14-25, 27-37, 39-40, 42-43, 45-49, 51-53, 58, and 60 within twenty days.
