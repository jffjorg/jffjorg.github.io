The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel further responses to requests for production of documents filed by the plaintiff, Gabriel Reuven, against Ford Motor Company. The plaintiff alleges that Ford violated the Song Beverly Act by manufacturing a defective engine in a 2019 Ford Expedition.

The judge grants the motion in part and denies it in part. The plaintiff is entitled to further responses to requests for production of documents related to the Subject Vehicle, Ford's internal knowledge and investigation of the engine defect, and Ford's warranty and vehicle repurchase policies. However, the judge denies the motion as to requests for documents related to Ford's warranty and vehicle repurchase policies that are overbroad or not relevant to the case.

The judge also orders Ford to produce further documents within 30 days and sets a case management conference and trial setting conference for March 11, 2024.
