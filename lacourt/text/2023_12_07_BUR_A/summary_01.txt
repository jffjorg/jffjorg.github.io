* Plaintiff seeks to compel further responses to its requests for production of documents related to these incidents.

**Disputes**

* Plaintiff argues that the defendant has a duty to disclose the records and that the plaintiff has shown good cause for their production.

**Intentions**

* Welfare and Institutions Code ยง 5328-5328.9 (LPS Act)

**Significant Statements**
