ALLEGATIONS: 
 
Plaintiff Gabriel
Reuven (“Plaintiff”) brings this action against Ford Motor Company (“Ford”) for
Ford’s alleged violation of the Song Beverly Act. Plaintiff alleges that his
2019 Ford Expedition (the “Subject Vehicle”) was manufactured with a defective
engine. 
 
Plaintiff
now moves for an order compelling Ford’s
further response to Plaintiff’s RFPD as follows: 
 
RFPD Nos. 1, 3,
12, and 15 concerning the Subject Vehicle.
 
RFPD Nos. 17,
19, 30, 35, and 38 requesting documents related to Ford’s Internal Knowledge and
Investigation of an engine defect. 
 
RFPD Nos.
41, 43 and 44 requesting Ford’s internal
documents concerning the engine defect. 
 
RFPD Nos. 54,
55, 56, 66, 67 and 71 requesting documents related to Ford’s warranty and
vehicle repurchase policies. 
 
RFPD Nos. 74,
75, 76, 77, 78, 80 and 81 requesting documents related to Ford’s communications
with Governmental Agencies and Suppliers as concerns the engine defect in 2019
Ford Expedition vehicles. 
 
EVIDENTIARY OBJECTIONS: 
 
Plaintiff requests
the Court strike the declarations of Jodi Schebel and Jeffrey Push in their entirety.
Plaintiff argues that Ford impermissibly attempts to enter the declarations of
Schebel and Push while maintaining objections of attorney-client privilege. Plaintiff
asks that in the alternative, the attorney client privilege be waived, and each
declarant be subject to an Evidentiary Hearing in which they may be
cross-examined. Plaintiffs requests are denied. 
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
I.                   
LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
A motion
to compel further responses to a demand for inspection or production of
documents (“RFPD”) may be brought based on: (1) incomplete statements of
compliance; (2) inadequate, evasive, or incomplete claims of inability to
comply; or (3) unmerited or overly generalized objections.  (C.C.P. §
2031.310(c).) 
 
A motion
to compel further production must set forth specific facts showing good cause
justifying the discovery sought by the inspection demand. (See C.C.P. §
2031.310(b)(1).) In Digital Music News LLC v Superior Court (2014) 226
Cal.App.4th 216 at 224, the Court defined “good cause” as a showing that there
“a disputed fact that is of consequence in the action and the discovery sought
will tend in reason to prove or disprove that fact or lead to other evidence
that will tend to prove or disprove the fact.”  
 
If the
moving party has shown good cause for the requests for production, the burden
is on the objecting party to justify the objections. (Kirkland v. Sup.Ct
(2002) 95 Cal. App.4th 92, 98.) 
 
“The
court shall limit the scope of discovery if it determines that the burden,
expense, or intrusiveness of that discovery clearly outweighs the likelihood
that the information sought will lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.”
(C.C.P. § 2017.020(a).) Generally, objections on the ground of burden require
the objecting party to produce evidence of (a) the propounding party's
subjective intent to create burden or (b) the amount of time and effort it
would take to respond. (See West Pico Furniture Co. of Los Angeles v.
Superior Court In and For Los Angeles County (1961) 56 Cal.2d 407, 417.)
However, no such evidence is necessary where discovery is obviously overbroad
on its face. (See Obregon v. Superior Court (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 424,
431.)  
 
II.                
MERITS 
 
Meet and Confer 
 
Upon review the Court finds the meet and confer
requirements were met. (Smith Decl. ¶ 27.)
 
RFPD Nos. 1, 3, 12, and 15
 
These requests ask for all documentation
in Ford’s possession related to the Subject vehicle (RFPD No. 1.), all investigations
and reports regarding the cause of the defect in the Subject Vehicle (RFPD No.
3.), pre-sale and pre-purchase documents concerning a disclosure of defect in
the subject vehicle (RFPD No. 12.), and any communications regarding the
Subject Vehicle (RFPD No. 15.) 
 
As a preliminary matter, the Court finds
Plaintiff has demonstrated good cause for the production of each of these
requests. Each of these requests concerns the Subject Vehicle directly and
would be directly relevant to this litigation. 
 
Ford’s only substantive argument in opposition
is that Plaintiff has not identified any documents not produced by Ford which
would be responsive, and thus has not shown good cause. The Court notes Ford
reserves objections that there are documents sought by these requests which are
subject to the attorney client privilege.  From this assertion, it appears there are
documents which Ford is withholding on the basis of privilege. The Court also
notes Ford has presented no privilege log or other information which would
allow the parties to evaluate the merit of the privilege claim. (See C.C.P. §
2031.240.) 
 
The Court finds Plaintiff has shown good
cause for further production and that Ford has failed to justify its objection
on the grounds of privilege. Ford’s other objections are not substantively
argued in their opposition. As such, the motion to compel further responses to
these requests is GRANTED. 
 
RFPD Nos. 17, 19, 30, 35, 38, 41,43, and 44
 
Each of these RFPD request all documents
maintained by Ford with respect to engine defects in vehicles “with 3.5-liter
engines like the subject vehicle.” RFPD No. 19 does not specify 3.5-liter
engine vehicles, instead requesting all documents maintained by Ford pertaining
to any engine defect. 
 
In the discovery context,
information is relevant “if it might reasonably assist a party in evaluating
its case, preparing for trial, or facilitating a settlement. [citations
omitted] Admissibility is not the test and information, unless privileged, is discoverable
if it might reasonably lead to admissible evidence.” (Lipton v. Superior Court (1996)
48 Cal.App.4th 1599, 1611-1612.) It must be
noted that discovery rules are to be applied liberally “and (contrary to
popular belief), fishing expeditions are permissible in some cases.” (Cruz
v. Superior Court (2004) 121 Cal.App.4th 646, 653-654.)
 
The Court finds that Plaintiff has shown
good cause for the production of these documents. The documents Plaintiff seeks
concern engine defects affecting similar engines to that in the Subject
Vehicle. It is no stretch of the imagination that these documents could tend to
prove facts concerning the alleged defect in the Subject Vehicle. However, the
Court finds these requests are so vaguely stated as to be overbroad on their
face. (See Obregon supra, 67 Cal.App.4th at 431.) Plaintiff’s RFPDs seek documents
related to every Ford model employing a 3.5-liter engine and, in the case of
RFPD No. 19, any engine used by Ford at all. Given that Ford manufactures many
different models of vehicles and all of them, the number of documents would
almost certainly exceed the scope of this litigation. 
 
It is true that evidence regarding other vehicles with similar
defects as Plaintiff's could potentially be admissible at trial in a lemon
law action, and thus discoverable. (Donlen v. Ford Motor Co.
(2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 138, 154; see also Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc.
(2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 967, 971.) However, Donlen and Doppes
concerned evidence which was directly related to vehicles of the same model and
year, not generalized requests for defects in any engine utilized by a
manufacturer.
 
The Court finds these RFPD
are not reasonably particularized and thus overbroad on their face. As such,
the Court DENIES the motion as to these requests. 
 
RFPD Nos. 54, 55, 56, 66, 67 and 71
 
These requests concern
Ford’s warranty and vehicle repurchase policies, including the training of
employees and written policies from 2019 to present. 
 
Ford states it produced a
number of documents responsive to this request, including Ford’s Warranty
Policy and Procedure Manual, policies and procedures for Ford’s customer
relationship center (“CRC”), and Ford’s RAV Policy & Procedure Manual for
2023. Ford states it produced the documents for 2023 as that is when the suit
was filed and objects to the production of responsive documents otherwise as
impermissibly overbroad.  
 
Plaintiff argues these
requests are highly relevant to their claims under the Song Beverly Act, citing
to Jensen v. BMW of North America, Inc. (1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 112,
which held that an evaluation of a manufacturer’s warranty policies is relevant
to a jury’s determination of willful violation of Song Beverly. (Jensen
supra, 35 Cal.App.4th 112 at 136.) 
 
The Court agrees that
Plaintiff has shown good cause for production. These requests are relevant to Plaintiff’s
claim that Ford violated the Song Beverly Act by virtue of its insufficient
repurchase policies from the years 2019 to current. The Court further finds
that Ford’s limitation to the policies as they are in 2023 is insufficient to
satisfy this request and their objection that the request is overbroad is
without merit.  The Subject Vehicle
having been manufactured in 2019, it does not appear overbroad to request
documentation regarding Ford’s repurchase procedures at that time. Further,
Ford has produced no privilege log or other information identifying documents
to which it is asserting the attorney-client privilege. 
 
The Court does find however,
that Plaintiff has not shown good cause of RFPD No. 67, which requests
information about Ford’s document retention policy for electronic data and
communications. The Court does not find Plaintiff has established this
information would be relevant to any cause of action in this case. 
 
While the Court finds
Plaintiff has shown good cause for RFPD No. 71, the Court finds this request to
be overbroad on its face. RFPD No. 71 requests “[Ford’s] recall policies and
procedures.” This request is not limited to any temporal scope nor is it
limited to vehicles which suffer similar defects as the Subject Vehicle. 
 
As such the motion to
compel further response to RFPD Nos. 54-66 is GRANTED, while the motion to
compel further response to RFPD Nos. 67 and 71 are DENIED. 
 
RFPD Nos. 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 80 and
81
 
RFPD No. 74, 76, 77, 78 requests all
communications with governmental officials involving engine defects in Ford
Vehicles. The Court finds these requests overbroad on their face, as they are
not limited in time nor to engine defects in models similar to the Subject
Vehicle. 
 
RFPD No. 75, 80, and 81 request
communications from the supplier of the 3.5-liter engine in Ford Vehicles
regarding a defect. The Court similarly finds this request overbroad in that it
is not limited in time nor to model similar to the Subject Vehicle. 
 
Accordingly, the motion to compel further
responses to these requests is DENIED.
