And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendants' motion for an order determining the prevailing party and reasonable attorney's fees. The defendants had requested $33,191.06 in attorney's fees, arguing that they are entitled to fees under California Civil Code section 1717 and California Civil Code section 5975. However, the judge found that the defendants are not entitled to fees under section 1717 because the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed the action, and the fee provision in the governing documents only allows for fees in actions to enforce contract provisions, not tort claims. The judge also found that the defendants are not entitled to fees under section 5975 because the plaintiffs' tort claims do not fall within the limited scope of the provision. The judge concluded that the defendants' motion for attorney's fees is denied.
