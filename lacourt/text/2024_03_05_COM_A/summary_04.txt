And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling continues the hearing on the petition for change of name for Edith Gabriela Gallegos Nuñez and Jose De Jesus Gallegos Nuñez, who are 14 years old and seek to change their last name from Gallegos Nuñez to Luna. The court previously ordered consent of both parents or service on non-consenting parents, as well as publication of the Order to Show Cause. However, the court's file does not reflect that the petitioners have complied with these orders. As a result, the hearing is continued to April 20, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. in Department A of the Compton Courthouse, and the petitioners are ordered to comply with the January 16, 2024 order.
