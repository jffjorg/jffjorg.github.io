And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge issues a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Alliance of Schools for Cooperative Insurance Program (ASCIP) to the first amended complaint filed by Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD). The dispute revolves around the breach of contract and indemnity claims between LAUSD and ASCIP. ASCIP argues that LAUSD failed to timely present a claim under the Government Claims Act (GCA) and therefore, the claims are barred. LAUSD, on the other hand, argues that ASCIP is a public entity and therefore, LAUSD is not required to file a government claim against it. The Judge rules that ASCIP's demurrer is overruled, and ASCIP is ordered to file its answer within 10 days.
