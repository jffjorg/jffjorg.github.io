[TENTATIVE] ORDER
DENYING PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO STRIKE THE ANSWER OF UNREPRESENTED DEFENDANT,
VIVA DONAS, INC.
      
      This action
arises from Defendants’ alleged breached of a written, commercial lease
agreement. Defendants, Viva Donas, Inc. (“Viva”), Ashley Leon, and David Vasquez
filed their answer on July 14, 2023. On January 9, 2024, the court granted a
motion filed by Bruce R. Menke to be relieved as counsel for Viva Donas, Inc.,
which became effective on January 12, 2024, when counsel filed proof of service
of the order on the client. 
      Plaintiff
moves to strike Viva’s answer as it is a corporation and cannot represent
itself. Plaintiff timely served Defendants with the motion. No opposition is
filed. 
      The court may, upon motion or at any time in its
discretion and upon terms it deems proper: (1) strike out any irrelevant,
false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading; or (2) strike out all or
any part of the pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of
California, a court rule, or an order of the Court. (Code Civ. Proc., § 436 subd (a)-(b).) 
      At the time Viva filed its
answer, it was represented by counsel, who signed the answer. Therefore, the
pleading was not improper at the time it was filed. Plaintiff relies on CLD
Construction, Inc. v. City of San Ramon (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 1141, which is distinguishable because the Plaintiff corporation filed a
complaint that did not indicate it was represented by counsel, nor did an
attorney sign the complaint.  (CLD
Construction, Inc. at 1146.)  Plaintiff also cites Paradise
v. Nowlin (1948) 86
Cal.App.2d 897, which is
inapposite since in that case, the corporation filed court pleadings in propria
persona, which was improper as corporations cannot represent themselves. (Paradise
at 898.) 
      Plaintiff does not cite any
authority that pleadings properly filed on behalf of a corporation by its
counsel are invalidated by counsel’s withdrawal, rather it becomes "the
duty of the trial judge to advise the representative of the corporation of the
necessity to be represented by an attorney.” (Gamet
v. Blanchard (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th
1276, 1284, fn. 5.)
      Based on the foregoing,
Plaintiff’s motion is DENIED.
