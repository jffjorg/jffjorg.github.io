And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the demurrer filed by the City of Los Angeles is sustained, meaning that the complaint filed by Levivian Beatrice Valencia is defective and needs to be revised. The judge found that Valencia did not properly file a claim for damages arising from her own death, as required by the Government Tort Claims Act. The judge also noted that Valencia did not assert her own claims in the government claim filed with the City, and that a claimant cannot rely on another's tort claim. The judge gave Valencia 10 days to file an amended complaint.
