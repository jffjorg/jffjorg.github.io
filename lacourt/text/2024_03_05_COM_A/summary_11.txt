And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting a stay of the civil action pending the resolution of the criminal case against Oswaldo Lopez. The stay is limited to the claims against Lopez, Cameron Dayne, and Dayne's employer, but permits the plaintiffs to pursue their product liability claims against Tesla. The court has conducted a "particularized inquiry" of the parties' interests and has determined that the plaintiffs will not suffer any prejudice as a result of the stay. The judge has also noted that the claims against Tesla are separate from the claims against Lopez, Dayne, and Dayne's employer, and therefore do not require a stay. The court will hear from the parties regarding the status of the criminal case and its effect on this motion.
