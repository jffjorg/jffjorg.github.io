And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the Plaintiff's motion to strike the answer of the Defendant, Viva Donas, Inc. The Plaintiff argues that Viva, a corporation, cannot represent itself and therefore its answer should be struck. The Judge disagrees, citing previous cases that allow corporations to file pleadings properly filed by their counsel, even if the counsel is later relieved. The Judge notes that the court's duty is to advise the representative of the corporation of the necessity to be represented by an attorney, rather than invalidating the pleadings.
