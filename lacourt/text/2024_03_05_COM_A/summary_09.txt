And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling continues the hearing on the motion for determination of good faith settlement to July 25, 2024, to permit the City of Compton to conduct discovery. The court has determined that the settlement between the Plaintiff, John Shelton, Jr., and Defendant Guevara was made in good faith, as Guevara's ability to contribute to the settlement is constrained by the limits of his insurance policy. However, the City objects to the settlement, arguing that it was not made in good faith and that the court should consider the settlor's financial condition and insurance policy limits. The court has discretion to continue the hearing where the opposing party has not conducted discovery on any factor placed in issue by the settling party.
