And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiffs' motion for trial preference, citing California Code of Civil Procedure section 36(b) and (e). The motion is granted because the plaintiff, Luna Ruiz-Esquivel, is under 14 years old and has sustained personal injuries. The parties do not dispute that Luna has a substantial interest in the case. The judge sets a preferential trial date six to nine months from the date of granting the motion, which is October 21, 2024. The court will select the exact date after conferring with counsel at the hearing.
