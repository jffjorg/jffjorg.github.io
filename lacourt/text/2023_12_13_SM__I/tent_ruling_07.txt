 Case Number:  23SMCV02150    Hearing Date:   December 13, 2023    Dept:  I The demurrer is MOOT. 
The motion for leave to amend is GRANTED.
Plaintiff, Corby & Corby (C&C) is an accountancy
corporation.  It filed an action against
Maiten, who filed a cross-complaint against C&C.  C&C demurred and also sought leave to
file an FAC.  In the meantime, Maiten
filed an amended cross-complaint.
The amended cross-complaint moots C&C’s demurrer.
As to the motion to amend, C&C seeks to add a cause of
action for breach of a written contract claiming that it recently found an
electronic agreement.  Maiten opposes the
amendment, saying that the email is not a contract.  That issue is better decided on demurrer than
on leave to amend.  The motion to amend
is GRANTED.  The proposes FAC is deemed filed
as of today.  Maiten has 30 days’ to
answer or otherwise respond to the complaint.
