Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is continuing the opposition to the defendant's claim of exemption. The judge is confused about the exemption claim and is asking the defendant to clarify it. The defendant claims monthly take-home pay of $2777.36, but also claims monthly income of $5554.72. The judge is guessing that the $2777 is a twice-monthly paycheck, which would yield the correct monthly pay. The defendant also claims $3000/month in medical expenses. The judge is concerned about the math and accounting discrepancies and is asking the parties to talk and figure out what is going on. The judge is allowing the defendant to supplement its claim by filing a brief within two weeks, and the plaintiff will have two weeks to oppose. A further hearing will be set in approximately five weeks.
