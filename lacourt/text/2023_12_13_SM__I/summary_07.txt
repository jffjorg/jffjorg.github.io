And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling states that the demurrer filed by Corby & Corby (C&C) is now moot due to Maiten's amended cross-complaint. C&C had sought leave to file an amended complaint (FAC) and the Judge grants this motion. The proposed FAC is deemed filed as of today, and Maiten has 30 days to answer or respond to the complaint. The Judge also notes that the issue of whether the email is a valid contract is better decided on demurrer than on leave to amend.
