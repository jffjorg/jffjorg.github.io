 Case Number:  23SMCP00185    Hearing Date:   December 13, 2023    Dept:  I The opposition to the claim of exemption is CONTINUED.  The court does not understand the exemption
claim.  Defendant claims monthly
take-home pay of $2777.36, but monthly income of $5554.72 even though he claims
no income other than the take home pay. 
The court is guessing that the $2777 is a twice/monthly paycheck, which
would yield the correct monthly pay. 
Defendant claims $3000/month in medical expenses.
Defendant needs to explain the exemption because the court
also does not understand the math.  If
the monthly take-home is $5554, then without the $3000 medical expenses the net
cash is $2300/month after deductions and expenses.  Someone will need to explain to the court
what is going on here.  But more
important, the parties ought to talk and figure this out.  If the medical expenses are real and
verifiable, plaintiff’s position might be untenable.  But the court cannot tell from this. 
The court will allow defendant to supplement its claim by a
brief to be filed within two weeks. 
Plaintiff will have two weeks to oppose. 
The court will set a further hearing in approximately five weeks.
