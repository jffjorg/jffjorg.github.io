Here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendant's motion to set aside the default. The Judge found that the defendant was aware of the default and allowed it to be entered, and that the defendant's failure to answer was a deliberate tactical move rather than an error or excusable neglect. The Judge notes that the rules on setting aside defaults must be read in the context of the Uniform Debt Collection Act (UD) statutory rules, which provide for a speedy trial process. The Judge believes that allowing a party to deliberately take a default and then move to vacate it would defeat the speedy trial provisions of the UD. The Judge orders the proposed judgment to be placed back in the queue and will sign it if it is proper. The Judge also notes that if the defendant wants to try again before judgment is entered, they must explain why they allowed the default to be entered and then seemingly reneged from the settlement agreement.
