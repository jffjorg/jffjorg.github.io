  Case Number:  20SMCV00596    Hearing Date:   December 13, 2023    Dept:  I The ex parte application to quash is GRANTED.  The motion for reconsideration is not one at
which the court has authorized or indicated that it will take live
testimony.  As such, no appearances are
required.  Nor is this a proper discovery
tool, so no documents need be produced. 
The subpoenae are QUASHED.  The
witnesses need not appear.  The court
will not hear argument on this matter.
