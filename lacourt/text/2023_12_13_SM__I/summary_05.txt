English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants in part and denies in part the motions to compel further discovery and bar defendants from producing documents. The court finds that the discovery requests are generally acceptable, but some requests are overly broad or loaded with hot button terms. The court also criticizes the parties for not engaging in a good faith meet and confer process, which is required before filing a motion.

The court provides guidelines for discovery responses, including that objections should be tailored to each specific request and that responses must conform to the Code of Civil Procedure. The court also emphasizes the importance of a good faith meet and confer process, which includes an actual meeting between representatives of the parties with the authority to agree to the other side's position.
