Here is the summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has ruled on the motion to amend the judgment filed by Respondents. The court grants the motion in part and denies it in part. The court grants the motion to the extent that it seeks to amend the judgment to include $5,813.70 in costs. The court denies the motion to the extent that it seeks to amend the judgment to reflect Petitioner's true name. The court finds that Petitioner's fee waiver only applies to fees and costs imposed by the court, and that Petitioner did not file a timely motion to strike or tax the cost award, waiving any objection to the costs claimed by Respondents. The court also denies the motion to amend the judgment to reflect Petitioner's true name, as Respondents cite no authority that the court may amend a judgment to reflect the true name of a party who proceeded with a pseudonym in a case involving allegations of sexual misconduct.
