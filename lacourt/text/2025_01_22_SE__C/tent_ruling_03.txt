Moving party to give notice. 
 
Plaintiff Lorena Quiroz (Plaintiff) moves the Court for an
order compelling Defendant American Honda Motor Co., Inc.’s (Defendant) further
responses to Requests for Production of Documents, set one.
 
Background
 
This is a lemon law action. On May 22, 2023, Plaintiff filed
a complaint against Defendant concerning her 2019 Honda Odyssey vehicle.
Plaintiff alleges two causes of action: (1) violation of Song-Beverly Act –
breach of express warranty and (2) fraudulent inducement-concealment.
 
Plaintiff moves to compel further responses to Requests for
Production of Documents, set one, request numbers 24-28, 32- 34, and 37-38
 
This action is a continuation from September 25, 2024.
 
Meet and Confer
 
A motion compelling further response to a demand “shall be
accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.04.” (Code Civ.
Proc. § 2031.310 subd. (b)(2).) A meet and confer declaration “shall state
facts showing a reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal resolution of
each issue presented by the motion.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2016.40.) 
 
On September 25, 2024, the Court found it was not persuaded
that counsel had exhausted their meet and confer obligations pursuant to the
Code. The Court ordered counsel to make further meet and confer efforts and
instructed them to submit a revised joint separate statement with any remaining
issues no later than 10 days before this hearing. To date, no revised joint
statement has been filed. Accordingly, Plaintiff’s motion to compel further
responses to Requests for Production of Documents, set one, is taken OFF
CALENDAR.
