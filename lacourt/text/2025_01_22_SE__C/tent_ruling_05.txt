Crossing Storage Services, Inc. 
 
No opposition filed as of January 18, 2025.  
 
Background
 
This is an unlawful detainer action. On April 10, 2024,
Plaintiff filed this action against Hyung Do Min, MJ Global Enterprises, Inc.,
Crossing Storage Services, Inc., Pitman Enterprises USA, LLC, and Everytable,
PBC. Plaintiff is the owner of the premises located at 3305 E. Vernon Avenue,
Vernon, California, 90058 (Subject Premises). Plaintiff alleged that on January
22, 2021, Plaintiff became the landlord of the Subject Premises as
successor-in-interest to Vernon-B LLC pursuant to a second amendment to a Standard
Industrial Commercial Single-Tenant Lease (Lease) between Vernon-B LLC and
Defendants MJ Global Enterprises, Inc. and Hyung Do Min (Defendants). (Complaint,
¶ 10.) Defendants Pitman Enterprises USA, Crossing Storage Services, Inc., and
Everytable, PBC were sublessees on the Lease and continued to remain in
possession of the Subject Property. (Complaint, ¶¶ 13-15.) In September of
2023, Defendant MJ Global Enterprises, Inc. became delinquent in rent, and on
March 28, 2024, Plaintiff served Defendants with a three day Notice to Pay Rent
or Quit. (Complaint, ¶¶ 16-17.) On April 1, 2024, Plaintiff received the sum of
$170,000, leaving a balance of $223,232.41. (Complaint, ¶ 17.)
 
On September 4, 2024, a jury trial was held. The Court was
informed of a settlement between Plaintiff and Defendant Everytable, PBC. The
Court entered stipulated judgment for Plaintiff and against Defendant
Everytable, PBC. Restitution and possession of the premises were granted for
Plaintiff. (Minute Order, 9/4/2024.) The Court was also informed of a
settlement as to the remaining Defendants, Hyung Do Min, MJ Global Enterprises,
Inc. and Cross Storage Services, Inc. (Minute Order, 9/4/2024.) The Court ordered
the case sealed pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1161.2 subd.
(a)(2). The Court retained jurisdiction to enforce the terms of the stipulation
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6.
 
On November 15, 2024, the Court heard Plaintiff’s ex parte
application to unseal the record and enter default against Defendants Hyung Do
Min, MJ Global Enterprises, Inc., and Crossing Storage, Inc. The Court denied
Plaintiff’s ex parte application and determined the issue should be adjudicated
after briefing by the parties. (Minute Order, 11/15/2024.) The Court specially
set the hearing for this date, January 22, 2025. (Minute Order, 11/15/2024.)
 
On December 3, 2024, the Court dismissed Defendant Pitman Enterprise
USA, LLC dismissed without prejudice. On January 8, 2025, an Order to Show
Cause re Dismissal (Settlement) as to Defendants Hyung Do Min, MJ Global
Enterprises Inc, and Cross Storage Services, Inc. was continued to February 20,
2025.
 
Legal Standard
 
“If parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a writing
signed by the parties outside of the presence of the court or orally
before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon
motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement. If
requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to
enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of the
settlement.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 664.6.)
 
Court records are presumed to be open. (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 2.550(c).) A sealed record may only be unsealed by Court order. (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 2.551(h).) The Court may order a record be sealed only if
it expressly finds facts that establish: 
 
(1) There exists an overriding
interest that overcomes the right of public access to the record;
(2) The overriding interest
supports sealing the record;
(3) A substantial probability
exists that the overriding interest will be prejudiced if the record is not
sealed;
(4) The proposed sealing is
narrowly tailored; and
(5) No less restrictive means exist
to achieve the overriding interest.
 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.550(d).) In determining whether
to unseal a record, the court considers the matters addressed in California
Rules of Court, rule 2.550(c)-(e). (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.551(h)(4).) The
order unsealing a record must state whether the record is unsealed entirely or
in part. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.551(h)(5).) 
 
Discussion
 
Plaintiff moves to unseal the record and for an order
entering default against Defendants. Plaintiff argues good cause exists for the
Court to unseal the record and enter default because Defendants breached the
terms of the settlement agreement entered into on September 4, 2024.
 
Here, the parties entered a stipulated settlement on September
4, 2024.  Under Code of Civil Procedure
section 664.6, an oral stipulated settlement made in Court is enforceable. Plaintiff
asserts that pursuant to the stipulated settlement, Defendants were to pay
Plaintiff $300,000 by September 4, 2024, and make monthly payments of $15,000
by September 11, 2024. (McCormack Decl., ¶ 3.) As of September 17, 2024,
Defendants failed to make a monthly payment of $15,000. (McCormack Decl., ¶ 5.)
In its Minute Order on September 4, 2024, the Court indicated “that a judgment
will not be entered if the terms of settlement are complied with. If there is a
breach, the matter will be unsealed and a judgment will be entered.” (Minute
Order, 9/4/2024.) Defendants have not opposed this motion. Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s motion to unseal the record and enter default against Defendants is
GRANTED.
