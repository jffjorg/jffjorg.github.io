And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by defendant Rosario Pasillas to the plaintiff's first amended complaint (FAC). The court finds that the demurrer is procedurally defective and that the FAC is not uncertain. The court notes that the FAC correctly identifies the plaintiff's name and capacity as trustee, and that the errors in the attachment do not render the FAC uncertain. The court also finds that the FAC is clear and intelligible, and that the defendant has been properly notified of the allegations.

The court overrules the demurrer and allows the FAC to proceed. The court notes that the defendant's arguments regarding the uncertainty of the pleadings are without merit, and that the FAC provides sufficient notice to the defendant of the allegations. The court also finds that the defendant's failure to meet and confer with the plaintiff prior to filing the demurrer is a procedural defect.

The court orders the parties to comply with the requirements of the notice to quit and to file a proof of service with the notice. The court also notes that the plaintiff's request for attorney's fees is not properly raised on demurrer.
