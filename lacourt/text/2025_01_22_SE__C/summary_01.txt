And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has granted Plaintiff Eduardo Hernandez's motion to file a late opposition to Defendant Econo Door Repair Services' motion to dismiss for lack of prosecution. The Court found that Plaintiff's counsel demonstrated mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect in not calendaring the correct deadline to file an opposition. Despite this error, Plaintiff filed its opposition to Econo's motion to dismiss soon after realizing the mistake. The Court determined that Plaintiff's counsel's mistake was excusable and that Econo will not be prejudiced by a late-filed opposition. Therefore, the Court granted Plaintiff's motion for relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 473 to file a late opposition to Econo's motion to dismiss.
