  Case Number:  20STCV43287    Hearing Date:   June 6, 2024    Dept:  28 Summary of Court's May 28 and June 6, 2024 rulings A.    Motion to determine Department of Health Care Services  lien  On May 28, 2024, the  Court granted Plaintiff Hayk Kazanchyan’s motion to determine the Department of  Health Care Services’ lien. Applying Welfare and Institutions Code section  11424.76, the Court allocated 12.5% of the settlement amount to past medical  expenses and the remainder to other damages. The Court found it is not  reasonably probable that the Department will pay $51,148,395 of Plaintiff’s  future medical expenses. The Court concluded that the Department is entitled to  reimbursement of $47,389.48.  (See May 28, 2024 minute order.) B.    Petition to approve minor’s compromise  On May 28, 2024, the  Court continued the hearing on the petition to approve the minor’s compromise  to allow Petitioner to submit final figures for attorney’s fees, medical  expenses to be paid from the settlement proceeds, liens, and the net settlement  amount.  On June 6, 2024, the Court reviewed Petitioner's second amended petition and found that it was complete.  The Court granted Petitioner's second amended petition to approve the compromise of minor Plaintiff Hayk Kazanchyan’s claims.  The net settlement funds are to be distributed as specified in the second amended petition. C.    Special needs trust  On May 28, 2024, the  Court approved the creation and funding of a proposed special needs trust.  The  Court granted Petitioner’s requests (1) for authority to pay $4,500 to trust  specialist counsel Randolph M. Sharon, Esq. for tasks relating to the minor’s  settlement trust including drafting of the trust instrument and related  portions petition and (2) for authority for the trustee to pay Petitioner  $5,000 per month as the Plaintiff’s primary caregiver, with the trustee to engage a third party to employ Petitioner (adding expenses for payroll  taxes, insurance, and administrative fees).  The  Court found:  •         Plaintiff has a disability which  substantially impairs his ability to provide for his own care or custody and  constitutes a substantial handicap;  •         Plaintiff is likely to have special  needs that will not be met without the trust;  •         The money to be paid to the trust does  not exceed the amount that appears reasonably necessary to meet Plaintiff’s  special needs.  The proposed initial  trustee (private professional fiduciary Shoushan Movsesian) must submit a  $2,942,000 bond to this department.  (The  bond will later be resubmitted to the Probate court in any trust supervision  action.) The first trust accounting will take place in one year.  The Court sets a 14-month calendar due date, which the Probate filing window will use to set the first OSC re: accounting in the trust supervision action. The Court sets August 22, 2024 as the calendar due date for Notice of Commencement of Proceedings for a Court Supervised Trust on LASC Form PRO 044. The Court sets August 22, 2024 for an Order to Show Cause re: funding of the settlement, submission of the bond, purchase of annuities, and filing of LASC Form PRO 044 to open a trust supervision action in Probate.  The OSC will be held in Department 28 of the Spring Street Courthouse.   Petitioner is to give notice of this order.
