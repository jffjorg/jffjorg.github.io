The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the default judgment requests filed by Plaintiffs Ki Sik Song, Hwa Ja Song, and Wan Ryung Song against Defendant Bok Sik Park.

The court has granted Plaintiff Hwa Ja Song's application for default judgment and awarded her $4,840 against Defendant Bok Sik Park. The court has also granted Plaintiff Wan Ryung Song's application for default judgment and awarded him $3,650 against Defendant Bok Sik Park.
