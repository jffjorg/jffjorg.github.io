PARTY’S REQUESTS 
Activ asks the Court to impose terminating and monetary sanctions on Alston. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
A.   Monetary, issue, evidentiary, and terminating
sanctions 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2023.030 provides in part: 
“To the extent authorized by the chapter governing any
particular discovery method or any other provision of this title, the court,
after notice to any affected party, person, or attorney, and after opportunity
for hearing, may impose the following sanctions against anyone engaging in
conduct that is a misuse of the discovery process: 
“(a) The court may impose a monetary sanction ordering
that one engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney
advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses, including
attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct. The court may
also impose this sanction on one unsuccessfully asserting that another has
engaged in the misuse of the discovery process, or on any attorney who advised
that assertion, or on both. If a monetary sanction is authorized by any provision
of this title, the court shall impose that sanction unless it finds that the
one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. 
“(b) The court may impose an
issue sanction ordering that designated facts shall be taken as established in
the action in accordance with the claim of the party adversely affected by the
misuse of the discovery process. The court may also impose an issue sanction by
an order prohibiting any party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process
from supporting or opposing designated claims or defenses. 
“(c) The
court may impose an evidence sanction by an order prohibiting any party
engaging in the misuse of the discovery process from introducing designated
matters in evidence. 
“(d) The court may impose a terminating sanction by
one of the following orders: 
“(1) An order striking out the pleadings or parts of
the pleadings of any party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process. 
“(2) An order staying further proceedings by that
party until an order for discovery is obeyed. 
“(3) An order dismissing the action, or any part of
the action, of that party. 
“(4) An order rendering a judgment by default against
that party. 
“(e) The court may impose a contempt sanction by an
order treating the misuse of the discovery process as a contempt of court. 
“(f) (1) Notwithstanding subdivision (a), or any other
section of this title, absent exceptional circumstances, the court shall not
impose sanctions on a party or any attorney of a party for failure to provide
electronically stored information that has been lost, damaged, altered, or
overwritten as the result of the routine, good faith operation of an electronic
information system. 
“(2) This subdivision shall not be construed to alter
any obligation to preserve discoverable information. 
(Code Civ.
Proc., § 2023.030.)         
B.       Sanctions
for failure to comply with Court order to respond to demand for inspection 
          Code of Civil Procedure section
2031.300, subdivision (c), provides in part: 
“If a party . . . fails to obey [an] order [under Code
of Civil Procedure section 2031.300, subdivision (b)] compelling a response [to
a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling], the court may make
those orders that are just, including the imposition of an issue sanction, an
evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in addition to this sanction, the court may
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010).” 
(Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (c).)               
C.      Sanctions
for failure to comply with Court order to respond to interrogatories 
Code of Civil
Procedure section 2030.290, subdivision (c), provides in part: 
“If a party then fails to obey an order [under Code of
Civil Procedure section 2030.290, subdivision (b)] compelling answers [to
interrogatories], the court may make those orders that are just, including the
imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in
addition to that sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010).” 
(Code Civ.
Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (c).)         

 D.   Sanctions for failure to comply with discovery orders 
A
violation of a discovery order supports the imposition of terminating
sanctions. (Collison & Kaplan v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th
1611, 1620.) Terminating sanctions are appropriate when a party persists in
disobeying the court's orders. (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d
771, 795-796 (Deyo).) 
A
terminating sanction is a "drastic measure which should be employed with
caution." (Deyo, supra, 84 Cal.App.3d at p. 793.) "A
decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly. But where a
violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows
that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery
rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction." (Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005)
128 Cal.App.4th 262, 279-280 (Mileikowsky).)   
DISCUSSION 
On
March 19, 2024, the Court (1) granted Activ’s motions to compel Alston’s
responses to requests for production of documents, set two, and ordered Alston
to serve verified code-compliant responses, without objections, and to produce
the documents, electronically stored information, and/or other things requested
without objections by April 18, 2024, (2) granted Activ’s motion to compel Alston’s
responses to special interrogatories, set two, and ordered Alston to serve
verified code-compliant responses to the special interrogatories without
objections by April 18, 2024, (3) granted Activ’s motion to compel Alston’s
responses to form interrogatories, set two, and ordered Alston to serve
verified code-compliant responses to the form interrogatories without
objections by April 18, 2024, and (4) granted Activ’s motion to compel Alston’s
responses to requests for admission, set two, and ordered Alston to serve
verified code-compliant responses to the requests for admission without
objections by April 18, 2024. 
Alston
has failed to comply with the Court’s March 19, 2024 order.  Activ asks the Court to grant its request for
terminating sanctions. 
The
Court denies Activ’s request for terminating sanctions.  Activ has identified one discovery order
which Alston has violated.  Activ has not
shown that less severe sanctions would be ineffective in producing compliance
with the discovery rules. (See Mileikowsky, supra, 128
Cal.App.4th at pp. 279-280.) 
Activ
requests monetary sanctions of $450.00. 
The Court finds the request reasonable and grants it. 
The
Court reinstates the March 19, 2024 order and orders Alston to comply with the
March 19, 2024 order by July 6, 2024. 
CONCLUSION 
          The Court DENIES Defendant Activ Enterprises, LLC’s motion for terminating sanctions against Plaintiff Angel Alston. 
          The Court REINSTATES its March 19, 2024 order and orders Plaintiff Angel Alston to comply with the March 19, 2024 order by July 6, 2024. 
The
Court GRANTS Defendant Activ Enterprises,
LLC’s request for sanctions and orders Plaintiff Angel Alston to pay Defendant Activ Enterprises, LLC $450.00 in
sanctions by July 6, 2024. 
          Moving party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
          Moving party is ordered to file the proof of service of
this ruling within five days.
