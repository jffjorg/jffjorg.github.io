And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is a denial of Defendant's motion to compel Plaintiff to attend an independent medical examination. The Judge finds that the parties have presented directly conflicting accounts of the events of March 4, 2024, and therefore cannot decide which version is accurate. The Judge denies the motion without prejudice and cautions Plaintiff that if she does not appear for her defense medical examination within 30 days, the Court will take her failure to appear into account if Defendant files another motion to compel.
