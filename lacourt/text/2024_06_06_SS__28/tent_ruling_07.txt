LEGAL STANDARD 
A.      Default judgment 
“[With exceptions that do not apply here,] [a] party
seeking a default judgment on declarations must use mandatory Request for Entry
of Default (Application to Enter Default) (form CIV-100) . . . The following
must be included in the documents filed with the clerk: 
“(1)  Except in
unlawful detainer cases, a brief summary of the case identifying the parties
and the nature of plaintiff's claim; 
“(2) 
Declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment
requested; 
“(3)  Interest
computations as necessary; 
“(4)  A
memorandum of costs and disbursements; 
“(5)  A
declaration of nonmilitary status for each defendant against whom judgment is
sought; 
“(6)  A proposed
form of judgment; 
“(7)  A
dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application
for separate judgment against specified parties under Code of Civil Procedure
section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; 
“(8)  Exhibits
as necessary; and 
“(9)  A request
for attorney fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.” 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1800(a).) 
B.       Damages 
 On a request for default judgment, “[w]here a
cause of action is stated in the complaint, plaintiff merely needs to introduce
evidence establishing a prima facie case for damages.”  (L. Edmon & C. Karnow, Cal. Practice
Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶ 5:213.1, p. 5-56 (Cal.
Practice Guide), citing Johnson v. Stanhiser (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 357,
361 [trial court erred in applying preponderance of the evidence standard].) 
 The relief granted to a plaintiff upon entry
of a defendant's default cannot exceed the amount demanded in the complaint or,
for personal injury cases where damages may not be stated in the complaint, the
amount listed in the statement of damages. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 580, subd. (a),
585, subd. (b).) “The notice requirement of section 580 was designed to insure
fundamental fairness.” (Becker v. S.P.V. Construction Co. (1980) 27
Cal.3d 489, 494.) The statute insures that “defendants in cases which involve a
default judgment have adequate notice of the judgments that may be taken
against them. [Citation.] ‘If a judgment other than that which is demanded is
taken against him, [the defendant] has been deprived of his day in court—a
right to a hearing on the matter adjudicated.’ ’’ (Id. at p. 493.) A
trial court exceeds its jurisdiction if it awards damages in excess of the
amount specified in the complaint or statement of damages. (Id. at p.
494.) 
DISCUSSION 
A.   Ki Sik Song 
As noted, Plaintiff Ki Sik
Song’s CIV-100 form asks the Court to enter a default judgment against
Defendant Bok Sik Park and award Plaintiff Ki Sik Song $18,000.00, consisting of $17,840.00
as the demand of the complaint and $160.00 in costs. 
In his declaration, Plaintiff Ki Sik Song states that he incurred $3,840 in medical expenses.  He has attached a bill from his medical service
provider to support this statement. 
Plaintiff Ki
Sik Song also states in his declaration that he incurred $12,000 to repair his
car.  Plaintiff has provided photographs
of his damaged car but he has not provided any receipts or damage estimates to
support his statement that he incurred $12,000 to repair it after the accident. 
Plaintiff Ki
Sik Song also requests $2,000 for pain, suffering, and emotional distress. 
The Court
construes Plaintiff Ki Sik Song’s request for $160 in costs for “services” as a
request for the cost of service of the summons, complaint, and statement of
damages on Defendant. 
Although Plaintiff
Ki Sik Song’s CIV-100 form refers to the “demand of the complaint,” Plaintiffs
served a statement of damages that put Defendant on notice of the damages Plaintiffs
were requesting.  Plaintiffs’ combined damages
requests do not exceed the amounts listed in the statement of damages. 
The Court denies Plaintiff
Ki Sik Song’s application without prejudice. 
Plaintiff Ki Sik Song may submit another application that contains
evidence supporting his assertion that he incurred $12,000 to repair his car as
a result of the accident which Defendant allegedly caused. 
B.   Hwa Ja Song 
As noted, Plaintiff Hwa Ja Song’s CIV-100 form asks
the Court to enter a default judgment against Defendant Bok Sik Park and award
Plaintiff $4,840.00, consisting of $4,840.00 as the demand of the complaint. 
In her declaration, Plaintiff Hwa Ja Song states that she
incurred $3,840 in medical expenses.  She
has attached a bill from her medical service provider to support this
statement. 
Plaintiff Hwa Ja Song also requests $1,000 for pain,
suffering, and emotional distress. 
Although Plaintiff Hwa Ja Song’s CIV-100 form refers
to the “demand of the complaint,” Plaintiffs served a statement of damages that
put Defendant on notice of the damages Plaintiffs were requesting.  Plaintiffs’ combined damages requests do not exceed
the amounts listed in the statement of damages. 
The Court grants Plaintiff Hwa Ja Song’s application
for default judgment. 
C.   Wan Ryung Song 
As noted, Plaintiff Wan Ryung
Song’s CIV-100 form asks the Court to enter a default judgment against
Defendant Bok Sik Park and award Plaintiff $3,650.00, consisting of $3,650.00
as the demand of the complaint. 
In his declaration, Plaintiff Wan Ryung Song states
that he incurred $2,650 in medical expenses. 
He has attached a bill from his medical service provider to support this
statement. 
Plaintiff Wan Ryung Song also requests $1,000 for
pain, suffering, and emotional distress. 
Although Plaintiff Wan Ryung Song’s CIV-100 form
refers to the “demand of the complaint,” Plaintiffs served a statement of
damages that put Defendant on notice of the damages Plaintiffs were
requesting.  Plaintiffs’ combined damages
requests do not exceed the amounts listed in the statement of damages. 
The Court grants Plaintiff Wan Ryung Song’s
application for default judgment. 
CONCLUSION 
The Court DENIES without prejudice Plaintiff Ki Sik
Song’s application for default judgment against Defendant Bok Sik Park.  Plaintiff Ki Sik Song may submit a new
application that contains evidence supporting his assertion that he incurred
$12,000 to repair his car as a result of the accident. 
The Court GRANTS Plaintiff Hwa Ja Song’s application for default judgment and awards Plaintiff Hwa Ja Song $4,840 against Defendant Bok Sik Park. 
The Court GRANTS Plaintiff Wan Ryung Song’s application
for default judgment and awards Wan Ryung Song $3,650 against Defendant Bok Sik
Park.

for Failure to Resubmit Default Judgment Packet (Plaintiff Ki Sik Song only)
