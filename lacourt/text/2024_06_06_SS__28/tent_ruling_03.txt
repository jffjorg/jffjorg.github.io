LEGAL STANDARD

following conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The
examination does not include any diagnostic test or procedure that is painful,
protracted, or intrusive. 
“(2) The
examination is conducted at a location within 75 miles of the residence of the
examinee. 
“(b) A
defendant may make a demand under this article without leave of court after
that defendant has been served or has appeared in the action, whichever occurs
first. 
“(c) A demand
under subdivision (a) shall specify the time, place, manner, conditions, scope,
and nature of the examination, as well as the identity and the specialty, if
any, of the physician who will perform the examination. 
“(d) A
physical examination demanded under subdivision (a) shall be scheduled for a
date that is at least 30 days after service of the demand. On motion of the
party demanding the examination, the court may shorten this time. 
“(e) The
defendant shall serve a copy of the demand under subdivision (a) on the
plaintiff and on all other parties who have appeared in the action.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2032.220.) 
          Code of
Civil Procedure section 2032.240 provides: 
“(a) If a
plaintiff to whom a demand for a physical examination under this article is
directed fails to serve a timely response to it, that plaintiff waives any

satisfied: 
“(1) The
plaintiff has subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance
with Section 2032.230. 
“(2) The
plaintiff’s failure to serve a timely response was the result of mistake,
inadvertence, or excusable neglect.

defendant may move for an order compelling response and compliance with a
demand for a physical examination. 
“(c) The
court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel response and compliance with a demand for a physical
examination, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust. 
“(d) If a
plaintiff then fails to obey the order compelling response and compliance, the
court may make those orders that are just, including the imposition of an issue
sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in addition to that sanction
the court may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010).”

court. 
“(b) A motion for an examination under subdivision (a)
shall specify the time, place, manner, conditions, scope, and nature of the

or persons who will perform the examination. The motion shall be accompanied by

DISCUSSION 
A.   Defendant’s motion 
Defendant
asserts the following: 
On
July 17, 2023, Defendant noticed Plaintiff’s defense medical examination with board-certified
neurosurgeon Paul E. Kaloostian, M.D. for August 23, 2023. 
On
August 16, 2023, Defendant’s counsel requested confirmation of Plaintiff’s appearance
at the August 23, 2023 DME. The following day, Plaintiff’s counsel objected to
the examination, saying it was unilaterally noticed and Plaintiff’s counsel was
out on leave. In response, Defendant’s counsel asked when Plaintiff was
available to attend a defense medical examination. 
On
October 4, 2023 and October 11, 2023, Defendant’s counsel again asked when
Plaintiff was available for a defense medical examination.  In response, Plaintiff counsel’s office
indicated that Plaintiff’s counsel was out on leave and did not state when
Plaintiff was available for an examination. 
On
October 25, 2023, Defendant’s counsel again asked when Plaintiff was available for
a defense medical examination.  Plaintiff’s
counsel did not respond to the request. 
On
November 8, 2023, Defendant’s counsel again asked when Plaintiff was available
for a defense medical examination.  Defendant’s
counsel stated that if Plaintiff’s counsel did not respond, Defendant’s counsel
would unilaterally schedule the examination.  Plaintiff’s counsel failed to respond. 
On
November 16, 2023, Defendant’s counsel noticed Plaintiff’s defense medical
examination for January 2, 2024.  Plaintiff
did not serve an objection. On the
morning of January 2, 2023, Defendant’s counsel asked for confirmation that
Plaintiff would appear for the examination.  Plaintiff’s counsel responded that Plaintiff
would not be able to appear due to an illness and asked to continue the
examination for a few weeks. Defendant’s
counsel incurred a late cancellation fee of $600.00. 
On
January 11, 2024, Defendant’s counsel again asked when Plaintiff was available
to appear for the defense medical examination. 
Plaintiff’s counsel stated that Mondays and Fridays were preferable for
Plaintiff.  On January 19, 2024,
Defendant’s counsel proposed setting the examination on March 4, 2024.  On January 24, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel
confirmed that Plaintiff’s availability for the March 4, 2024 examination. 
On
January 25, 2024, Defendant’s counsel informed Plaintiff’s counsel that the defense
medical examination doctor asked to change the time of the examination from
12:00 p.m. to 10:30 a.m. 
On
February 27, 2024, Defendant’s counsel requested confirmation that Plaintiff
would be on March 4, 2024.  On March 3,
2024, Plaintiff’s counsel confirmed Plaintiff would appear. 
On
March 4, 2024, Plaintiff failed to appear for the examination. As a result, Dr.
Kaloostian charged Defendant’s counsel a late cancellation fee of $300.00. 
On
March 12 and 15, 2024, Defendant’s counsel again asked when Plaintiff was available
for a defense medical examination.  Plaintiff’s
counsel did not respond.  On March 26, 2024, Defendant’s counsel informed
Plaintiff’s counsel of Dr. Kaloostian’s availability for Plaintiff’s
examination, but Plaintiff’s counsel did not respond. 
B.   Plaintiff’s opposition    
Plaintiff
asserts the following: 
On
January 2, 2024, the parties mutually agreed to reschedule the deposition for March
4, 2024 because Plaintiff believed she might have COVID. 
On
March 4, 2024, Plaintiff left her home and headed to the scheduled examination but
returned home when she was informed that Dr. Kaloostian’s office had scheduled
the examination for March 5, not March 4. 
Plaintiff could not reschedule the examination until May 21, 2024. 
Plaintiff
has not refused to appear for an examination. 
C.   Defendant’s reply 
Defendant
contends that “On March 4, 2024 at 10:36 a.m., Dr. Kaloostian indicated that he
was at the office waiting, but that Plaintiff failed to appear. At 10:41 a.m.,
the IME was cancelled due to Plaintiff’s indication that she needed to
reschedule.” 
D.      Analysis 
          The parties have presented what appear to be directly
conflicting accounts of the events of March 4, 2024.  The Court has insufficient information to
decide which version, if any, is accurate. 
The Court therefore denies the motion. 
However, the Court cautions Plaintiff that if she does not appear for
her defense medical examination within 30 days – even if the examination is scheduled
during her vacation – the Court will take her failure to appear into account if
Defendant files another motion to compel. 
CONCLUSION 
          The Court DENIES Defendant
Priscila Yumang De Guzman’s motion to compel Plaintiff Yvette Padilla to attend an independent medical
examination without prejudice. 
          Moving party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
          Moving party is ordered to file the proof of service of
this ruling within five days.
