As a result, the case is being transferred and reassigned to the Independent Calendar Court, presided over by Judge Frank M. Tavelman, in the Burbank Courthouse. All pending motions and hearings, including the hearing on June 6, 2024, will be reset, continued, or vacated at the direction of the newly assigned court. A minute order was issued on June 5, 2024, and mailed to counsel for the plaintiff, who is directed to give notice.
