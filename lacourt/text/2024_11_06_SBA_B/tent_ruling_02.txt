BACKGROUND
On June 22, 2023, plaintiff Maria
Guadalupe Orozco filed a complaint against City of Los Angeles, Los Angeles
World Airports, and Tom Bradley International Terminal Equipment Company for
(1) statutory liability – dangerous condition of public property, (2)
negligence – premises liability, and (3) negligence based on slip and/or trip
and fall on June 23, 2021.
On March 20, 2024, plaintiff filed
a FAC.
On November 4, 2024, the Court
granted defendant’s motions to compel plaintiff to respond to defendant’s form
interrogatories and request for production and inspection and ordered plaintiff
to pay sanctions in the amount of $720.
LEGAL AUTHORITY
Interrogatories
            If a party to whom interrogatories
are directed fails to serve a timely response, the propounding party may move
for an order compelling responses and for a monetary sanction.  CCP §2030.290(b).  The statute contains no time limit for a
motion to compel where no responses have been served.  All that need be shown in the moving papers
is that a set of interrogatories was properly served on the opposing party,
that the time to respond has expired, and that no response of any kind has been
served.  Leach v. Superior Court
(1980) 111 Cal. App. 3d 902, 905-906.  
Request for Admissions 
Pursuant to CCP § 2033.280(b), a
party may move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth
of any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a
monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010).  “Failure to timely respond to RFA does not
result in automatic admissions.  Rather,
the propounder of the RFA must ‘move for an order that the genuineness of any
documents and the truth of any matters specified in the requests be deemed
admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction’ under § 2023.010 et seq.”  Weil & Brown, Civ. Proc. Before Trial, ¶ 8:1370, citing CCP § 2033.280(b).  The court “shall” grant the motion to deem
RFA admitted, “unless it finds that the party to whom the requests for
admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a
proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial
compliance with Section 2033.220.”  CCP §
2033.280(c).
 
 
DISCUSSION
            Defendant
City of Los Angeles, Los Angeles World Airports requests that the Court compel
plaintiff Maria Guadalupe Orozco to respond to defendant’s special
interrogatories, set one and to determine the truth of the matters specified in
defendant’s request for admissions, set one.
            Defendant
asserts that on March 22, 2024, defendant propounded written discovery requests
on plaintiff.  Plaintiff’s responses were
due on April 23, 2024.  On April 23,
plaintiff’s counsel requested an extension and defense counsel provided a
two-week extension to provide responses, making the new deadline May 7,
2024.  On May 7, plaintiff’s counsel
requested an extension to May 10, 2024, which defense counsel granted.  On May 16, 2024, defense counsel called
plaintiff’s counsel and informed him “of the lack of timely discovery
responses.”  To date, defense counsel has
not received responses.  
            There
is no opposition.
            The
Court finds that the discovery requests were properly served, and that
plaintiff failed to serve responses and thus has waived objections.  
            The
motions are thus GRANTED.
            Sanctions
Under CCP
§ 2023.030(a), “[t]he court may impose a monetary sanction ordering that one
engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney advising that
conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees,
incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct. . . . If a monetary sanction is
authorized by any provision of this title, the court shall impose that sanction
unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust.”  Under CCP § 2023.010, an
example of the misuse of the discovery process is “(d) Failing to respond or to
submit to an authorized method of discovery.” 
Sanctions are mandatory in
connection with motions to compel responses to interrogatories and requests for
production of documents against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel unless the court “finds that
the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that
other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  CCP §§ 2030.290(c), 2031.300(c).
It is
mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction on the party or attorney
whose failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated
a motion to deem them admitted.  CCP §
2033.280(c). 
Cal.
Rules of Court, Rule 3.1348(a) states: 
“The court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a
party who files a motion to compel discovery, even though no opposition to the
motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was withdrawn, or the requested
discovery was provided to the moving party after the motion was filed.”
Defendant
City requests $1080 as to the motion regarding special interrogatories and $1920
for the motion regarding admissions against plaintiff.  The Court finds that $720 ($240/hr. x 3 hrs.)
is a reasonable amount to be awarded against plaintiff in total for both
motions.

The motions are GRANTED.
Plaintiff Maria Guadalupe Orozco is
ordered to respond without objections to defendant City of Los Angeles, Los
Angeles World Airports’ Special Interrogatories, Set One, within twenty days. 
 
The Court orders that the truth of the matters be deemed admitted in
defendant’s Request for Admissions, Set One against plaintiff.
The Court orders that plaintiff
Orozco pay $720 in sanctions to defendant, within thirty days.
Defendant
is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
