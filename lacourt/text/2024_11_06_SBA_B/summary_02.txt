And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to compel responses to special interrogatories and request for admissions. The plaintiff, Maria Guadalupe Orozco, failed to respond to the defendant's written discovery requests, despite extensions of time provided by the defendant. The judge has ordered the plaintiff to respond without objections to the defendant's special interrogatories, set one, within twenty days. The judge has also ordered that the truth of the matters specified in the defendant's request for admissions, set one, be deemed admitted against the plaintiff.

Additionally, the judge has ordered the plaintiff to pay $720 in sanctions to the defendant, within thirty days. The sanctions are mandatory under California law, as the plaintiff's failure to respond to the discovery requests necessitated a motion to deem the admissions admitted. The judge has also awarded the defendant's request for sanctions, finding that the plaintiff's actions were without substantial justification.
