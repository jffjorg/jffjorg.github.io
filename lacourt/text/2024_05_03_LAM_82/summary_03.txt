And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge denies the plaintiff's ex parte application for a writ of attachment or a temporary restraining order (and order to show cause why a preliminary injunction should not issue) to enjoin the escrow company from distributing any proceeds of the sale to HOA and its members until the lawsuit is resolved. The court finds that the plaintiff's claim lacks probable validity and does not demonstrate irreparable harm. The court also finds that the plaintiff's claim is barred by the mandatory and exclusive scheme for payment of creditors of liquor license transferors set forth in Business and Professions Code section 24074.
