And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to specially prepared interrogatories. The defendant, Samuel Pineda, has failed to provide specific and complete responses to the plaintiff's interrogatories, instead providing boilerplate objections. The judge finds that the defendant's responses are evasive and incomplete and orders the defendant to serve supplemental responses within 30 days. Additionally, the judge grants the plaintiff's request for sanctions against the defendant in the amount of $1,111.65. The judge finds that the defendant's conduct in refusing to respond to the plaintiff's interrogatories constitutes a misuse of the discovery process.
