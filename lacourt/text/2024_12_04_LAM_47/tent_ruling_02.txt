DISCUSSION:
 
Defendant moves to deem the truth
of matters stated in two sets of requests for admissions propounded to
Plaintiff as admitted. 
 
Multiple Motions
 
Defendant filed a single motion to
deem the truth of matters stated in two sets of requests for admissions
as admitted. 
 
Multiple motions should not be
combined into a single filing.¿(See¿Govt. Code,¿§ 70617(a)(4) [setting forth
the required filing fee for each motion, application, or any other paper or
request requiring a hearing];¿see¿also¿Weil & Brown, Civil Procedure Before
Trial, [8:1140.1] at 8F-60 (The Rutter Group 2011)¿[“Motions to compel
compliance with separate discovery requests ordinarily should be filed
separately.”].) Combining multiple motions under the guise of one motion with
one hearing reservation manipulates the Court Reservation System and unfairly
jumps ahead of other litigants. Moreover, combining motions to avoid payment of
separate filing fees deprives the Court of filing fees it is otherwise entitled
to collect. The Court therefore conditions its ruling on these motions on the
payment of an additional $60 in filing fees within 10 days of this order.
 
Legal
Standard
 
When a party to
whom requests for admission are directed fails to respond, the party
propounding the requests may move for an order that the truth of any matters
specified in the requests be deemed admitted. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280(b).)
“The court shall make this order [deem the requests admitted], unless it finds
that the party to whom the request for admissions have been directed has
served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests
for admission that is in substantial compliance with section 2033.220.” (Code
Civ. Proc. § 2033.280(c).)
 
Analysis
 
            Defendant
served Plaintiff’s counsel with Defendant’s first set of Requests for
Admissions on July 3, 2024. (Declaration of Robert Grijalba ISO Mot. ¶ 2.)
Defendant served Plaintiff’s counsel with Defendant’s second set of Requests
for Admissions by email on August 22, 2024, while Plaintiff’s counsel’s motion
to be relieved was pending, but before the motion was granted on August 28. (Id
¶ 3; August 28, 2024 Order Granting Motion to be Relieved.) To date, no
response has been received. (Grijalba Decl. ¶¶ 2-3.) Defendant is therefore
entitled to an order deeming the truth of the matters stated in these requests.
 
//
 
//
Sanctions
 
            Defendant
also requests sanctions against Plaintiff in the amount of $1,125.24. The Court
refuses to award sanctions to a party who fails to follow the procedural
requirements for bringing discovery motions and improperly manipulates the
Court Reservation System. 
 
CONCLUSION:
 
            Accordingly, Defendant’s Motion to
Deem the Truth of Matters Stated in Requests for Admissions (Set One)
Propounded to Plaintiff is GRANTED.
 
Defendant’s Motion to Deem the Truth of
Matters Stated in Requests for Admissions (Set Two) Propounded to Plaintiff is GRANTED.
 
Defendant’s request for sanctions is
DENIED. 
 
            This ruling is conditioned on
Defendant paying $60 in filing fees within 10 days of this order.
 
            Moving Party to give notice. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.

order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
