to Compel Depositions

Legal
Standard
 
Service of a proper deposition notice obligates a party or
“party-affiliated” witness (officer, director, managing agent or employee of
party) to attend and testify, as well as produce any document, electronically
stored information, or tangible thing for inspection and copying. (CCP §
2025.280(a).) If, after service of a deposition notice, a party deponent fails
to appear, testify, or produce documents or tangible things for inspection
without having served a valid objection under CCP § 2025.410, the deposing
party may move for an order compelling attendance, testimony, and production.
(CCP § 2025.450(a).) The motion must be accompanied by a meet and confer
declaration, or, when a party deponent fails to attend the deposition, the
motion must also be accompanied by a declaration stating that the moving party
has contacted the party deponent to inquire about the nonappearance. (CCP §
2025.450(b)(2).) If the deposition notice included a request for production of
documents, the motion to compel attendance must also show good cause to justify
the production. (CCP § 2025.450(b)(1).) 
  
A motion to compel production of documents described in a
deposition notice must be accompanied by a showing of good cause. (CCP §
2025.450(b)(1).) In other words, the moving party must provide declarations
containing specific facts justifying inspection of the documents described in
the notice. Courts liberally construe good cause in favor of discovery where
facts show the documents are necessary for trial preparation. 
 
The motion to compel must be “made no later than 60 days
after the completion of the record of the deposition.” (CCP § 2025.480(b).)
This time limit also applies to motions based on a deposition subpoena for
production of documents or a business records subpoena. The 60-day time limit
runs from the date objections are served because the deposition record is then
complete. (Rutledge v. Hewlett-Packard Co. (2015) 238 Cal.App.4th 1164,
1192.) 
 
Analysis
 

Plaintiffs Max Woldenberg and
Nicholas Van Horn move to compel the deposition of Defendants Soheila Newman
and Armand Newman, and Defendant New Management LLC’s Person Most Knowledgeable
(“PMK”). Plaintiffs request monetary sanctions of $1,873.41 per motion against
Defendants and their counsel of record Devin De Loa and Resnick & Louis,
P.C.
 
Plaintiffs duly served Defendants
with deposition notices. On September 24, 2024, Plaintiffs attempted to informally
set the above depositions with Defendants, requesting that defense counsel
provide available dates. (Riley Decl., ¶ 4, Ex. 1-2.) Defense Counsel informed
Plaintiffs’ counsel to “stand by” for dates. (Riley Dec. ¶5.) Defense counsel
failed to provide agreeable dates for deposition. Accordingly, on September 30,
2024, Plaintiffs noticed the depositions for Defendants Armand Newman, Soheila
Newman and the PMK for Defendant New Management, LLC, and invited defense counsel
to provide alternative dates if the dates noticed were unavailable. (Riley Dec.
¶6, Ex. 4.) Defendants objected to the deposition notices based on the
“unilateral” setting of the depositions, among other boilerplate objections.
(Riley Dec. ¶8, Ex. 6.) Plaintiffs requested that they provide dates for the
subject depositions, but Defendants failed to provide dates. (Riley Dec. ¶9, Exs.
7-8.) Defendants refused to appear as noticed. 
 
On October 23, 2024, defense
counsel equivocally suggested that a deposition “date between 12/4 – 12/18”
should work but they could not confirm such dates. (Riley Dec. ¶15, Ex. 14.)
Notably, the discovery cut-off is December 9, 2024. Thus, Defendants were suggesting
that they may not be available for deposition before the cut-off date. On
October 28, 2024, Plaintiffs served amended notices of deposition for the
appearance of Defendants Armand Newman, Soheila Newman and the Person Most
Qualified for Defendant New Management, LLC on November 20, 2024, and November
21, 2024. It is undisputed that Defendants failed to appear for these
depositions. Defendants do not address this fact in opposition. (See De Loa
Decl., ¶ 7.) Plaintiffs confirm this fact in their consolidated reply.
 
Accordingly, the motions are
GRANTED. Defendants are ordered to appear for their depositions within 10 days
via remote videoconference. 
 
Sanctions are imposed in favor of
Plaintiffs in the following amounts:  a) $1,873.41 against Soheila Newman and
Counsel, jointly and severally; b) $1,873.41 against
Armand Newman and Counsel, jointly and severally; and c) $1,873.41 against New
Management LLC and Counsel, jointly and severally. Sanctions are to be paid to
Plaintiffs’ counsel within 30 days.
