And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has granted the motions to compel the deposition of defendants Soheila Newman, Armand Newman, and New Management LLC's Person Most Knowledgeable (PMK). The defendants failed to appear for previously scheduled depositions and refused to provide alternative dates. The Court has ordered the defendants to appear for their depositions within 10 days via remote videoconference.

Additionally, the Court has imposed sanctions on the defendants and their counsel in the amount of $1,873.41 each, to be paid to the plaintiffs' counsel within 30 days. The Court finds that the defendants' failures to appear for depositions and provide alternative dates were unjustified and in bad faith.
