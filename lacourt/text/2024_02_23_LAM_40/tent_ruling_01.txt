 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
Defendant Hero
  Mountain, LLC’s Motion for Attorneys’ Fees.



 
Background
Procedural History, Costs, and
Fees 
On October 10, 2020, Plaintiff Finnegan’s Wake initiated this action by filing a
Complaint alleging claims of (1) Breach of Contract and (2) Money Had and
Received against Defendants Hero Mountain, LLC and Does 1 through 20.
On September 15, 2023, trial was
held in this action.
On September 19, 2023, the Court
issued its ruling after bench trial. In relevant part, the Court found in favor
of Defendant Hero Mountain on both causes of action and held that Defendant was
entitled to retain the $200,000 in liquidated damages. The Court also
determined that, as the prevailing party, Defendant Hero Mountain should submit
a proposed judgment within 10 court days and could file a motion for attorney
fees within the statutory time period.
On October 3, 2023, the Court
entered judgment, which ordered, adjudged, and decreed that (1) Finnegan’s Wake
take nothing from Defendant on the complaint and (2) Hero Mountain is the
prevailing party entitled to costs and disbursements, including attorney’s
fees, in an amount to be determined per motion.
That same day, the Clerk gave
notice of entry of judgment.
On October 11, 2023, Hero Mountain
filed a memorandum of costs.
That same day, Finnegan’s Wake filed
a motion for attorneys’ fees.
On November 22, 2023, Finnegan’s
Wake appealed the judgment.
On February 9, 2023, Finnegan’s
Wake filed an “opposition” to Hero Mountain’s motion. This opposition does not
dispute whether Hero Mountain incurred $130,000 in legal expenses in this
action but simply highlights that Finnegan’s Wake has appealed the judgment,
contesting whether Hero Mountain actually prevailed in this action.
No motion to strike or tax the
October 11, 2023 memorandum appears in the record.
Neither does a reply to the
February 9, 2024 opposition appear in the record.
Defendant Hero Mountain’s motion is
now before the Court.
 
Motion for Attorneys’ Fees
Legal
Standard
A
prevailing party is entitled to recover costs as a matter of right. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1032, subds. (a)(4), (b).) Attorney’s fees are also recoverable as
costs when authorized by contract, statute, or law. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5,
subd. (a)(10).) Attorney’s fees and costs may be awarded where a contract
between the parties at issue specifically provides for such fees and costs and
one party prevails over the other on the contract. (See Civ. Code, § 1717,
subd. (a).)
The
Court begins this inquiry “with the ‘lodestar,’ i.e., the number of hours
reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate.” (PLCM Group
v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095.) From there, the “lodestar figure
may then be adjusted [according to a multiplier enhancement] based on
consideration of factors specific to the case, in order to fix the fee at the
fair market value for the legal services provided.” (Ibid.) Relevant
multiplier factors include “(1) the novelty and difficulty of the questions
involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the extent to which
the nature of the litigation precluded other employment by the attorneys, [and]
(4) the contingent nature of the fee award.” (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24
Cal.4th 1122, 1132.)
No
specific findings reflecting the court’s calculations for attorney’s fees are
required; the record need only show that the attorney’s fees were awarded
according to the “lodestar” or “touchstone” approach. (Rebney v. Wells Fargo
Bank (1991) 232 Cal.App.3d 1344, 1349, disagreed with on other grounds in In
re Marriage of Demblewski (1994) 26 Cal.App.4th 232, 236, fn. 7
[disagreement as to statement of decision requirements].) The Court has broad
discretion to determine the amount of a reasonable attorney’s fee award, which
will not be overturned absent a “manifest abuse of discretion, a prejudicial
error of law, or necessary findings not supported by substantial evidence.” (Bernardi
v. County of Monterey (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 1379, 1393-1394.)
Order
Granting Attorneys’ Fees: GRANTED.
In
its motion, Defendant Hero Mountain seeks $130,000 in attorneys’ fees as the
prevailing party in this action, and based on (1) Code of Civil Procedure
section 1717, (2) a contract between the parties containing a clause entitling the
prevailing party in a lawsuit between the parties to fees, and (3) a
stipulation executed by the parties setting the maximum amount of recoverable
fees at $130,000. (See Mot., p. 2.)
The
motion is supported by a declaration from counsel, which details the
contractual basis for fees, the accuracy of the time records attached to the
declaration, counsel’s own personal experience as a litigator, and counsel’s
knowledge of reasonable fee rates in the Los Angeles area as supportive of the
requested fee rates. The declaration attaches copies of the September 19, 2023
ruling, the October 3, 2023 judgment, the parties’ contract, which contains a
fees provision, counsel’s verified billing records, the curriculum vitae for
the declarant, and a copy of the Laffey Matrix. (Mot., Rohatiner Decl., ¶¶
1-14, Exs. A-F.)
Finnegan’s
Wake’s opposition does not oppose Hero Mountain’s request on the merits, merely
noting that Finnegan’s Wake has appealed the judgment itself and thus disputes
whether Hero Mountain is the prevailing party. (Opp’n, pp. 1-2.)
The
Court finds that the $130,000 sought in fees are reasonable.
The
Court is considered “an expert in the matter of attorney fees” since “[t]he
value of attorney’s services is a matter with which a judge must necessarily be
familiar.” (Excelsior Union High Sch. Dist. of L.A. Cnty. v. Lautrup
(1969) 269 Cal.App.2d 434, 448.) Accordingly, “[w]hen the court is informed of
the extent and nature of such services, its own experience furnishes it with
every element necessary to fix their value.” (Ibid.) 
Here,
Plaintiff is the prevailing party entitled to fees by contract. (Mot., Rohatiner,
Ex. C, ¶ 34; 10/3/23 Judgment.)
The
moving papers summarize the fee rate ranges billed by Hero Mountain’s counsel
during counsel’s defense of this action. (Mot., p. 8.) The motion also attaches
a copy of the verified billing records of Hero Mountain’s counsel. (Mot., Rohatiner,
Ex. D.) A review of those records shows that rates for paralegals were kept at
$200 per hour and rates for attorneys were kept between $350 per hour to $675
per hour for counsel Marc Rohatiner. (Mot., Rohatiner, Ex. D.) The Court
determines that Marc Rohatiner’s years of experience and the general ranges
provided by the Laffey Matrix support the fee rates requested by Hero Mountain.
Moreover,
the Court determines that the 262.50 hours billed by counsel in relation to
this action are reasonable (1) based on the more than three years of litigation
and (2) based on a comparison of the time expended on the individual tasks
listed in the verified billing records and a description of the tasks on which
the time was expended. (Mot., Rohatiner, Ex. D.)
The
Court notes that the billing records show legal expenses of $153,464.32, well
within the range of the parties’ stipulated maximum of $130,000 in fees.
Finally,
a pending appeal does not limit the trial court’s jurisdiction to award fees. (Bankes
v. Lucas (1992) 9 Cal.App.4th 365, 368-369 [“Contrary to Bankes’s
argument, the filing of a notice of appeal does not deprive the trial court of
jurisdiction to award attorney fees as costs post trial. Although a prevailing party
may not be the prevailing party after an appeal, it has been held that a motion
for attorney fees is not premature despite the filing of a notice of appeal”].)
Defendant
Hero Mountain’s motion is thus GRANTED.

Conclusion
I.
Defendant Hero Mountain, LLC’s
Motion for Attorneys’ Fees is GRANTED.
Defendant Hero Mountain, LLC SHALL
file an amended proposed Judgment incorporating this order within 10 days.
II.
Because Plaintiff Finnegan’s Wake,
LP has not filed any motion to strike or tax Defendant Hero Mountain, LLC’s
timely-filed memorandum of costs, Finnegan’s Wake has waived that right, and
the Court DIRECTS the Clerk to enter the costs requested by Defendant Hero
Mountain, LLC on October 11, 2023. (10/3/23 Judgment; 10/3/23 Notice of Entry
of Judgment; 10/11/23 Memo of Costs [served via email]; Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1700, subd. (a)(1) [must, in relevant part, file costs memorandum within
15 days of clerk’s notice of entry of judgment]; Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1700, subd. (b)(1) [must file motion to strike or tax costs within 15 days of
service plus two extra court days pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1010.6];
(Griffith v. Wellbanks & Co. (1915) 26 Cal.App. 477, 480 [“In other
words, the terms of [Code of Civil Procedure section 1033] are mandatory, and a
substantially strict compliance therewith is required, not alone of the party
claiming costs, but also of the party dissatisfied with the costs claimed,”
emphasis added]; Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1700, subd. (b)(4) [clerk’s
ability to enter costs if no timely motion to strike or tax is made].)
