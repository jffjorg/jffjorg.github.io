Summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the first through fourth causes of action are withdrawn as to Defendant Yankyoung Lee and are thus struck by the Court as to Defendant Lee. As a result, Defendant Yankyoung Lee's demurrer to Plaintiff's complaint and motion to strike are MOOT. The judge has also granted leave to amend, allowing Plaintiff to file an amended pleading no later than March 29, 2024, which will limit any amended pleading in relation to Defendant Lee to the parameters outlined in Plaintiff Nathaniel Howard's opposition to the motions now before the Court.
