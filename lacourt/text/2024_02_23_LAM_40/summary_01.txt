And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the motion for attorneys' fees filed by Hero Mountain, LLC, the prevailing party in this action. The motion seeks $130,000 in attorneys' fees, which is supported by a declaration from counsel detailing the contractual basis for fees, the accuracy of the time records, and counsel's own personal experience as a litigator. The declaration also attaches copies of the relevant documents, including the contract, judgment, and billing records.

The court finds that the sought-after fees are reasonable, based on the lodestar approach, which takes into account the number of hours reasonably expended and the reasonable hourly rate. The court also considers the Laffey Matrix, which provides a general range of fee rates in the Los Angeles area.

The court notes that the pending appeal does not limit its jurisdiction to award fees, and that Hero Mountain's counsel has provided sufficient documentation to support the requested fee rates.

Accordingly, the court grants the motion for attorneys' fees and directs Hero Mountain to file an amended proposed judgment incorporating this order within 10 days. The court also directs the clerk to enter the costs requested by Hero Mountain on October 11, 2023, as Finnegan's Wake has waived its right to challenge those costs.
