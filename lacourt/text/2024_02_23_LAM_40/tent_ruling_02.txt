Background
Pleadings
Plaintiff Nathaniel Howard sues
Defendants Kenneth Melrose (Melrose), Law Offices of Ken J. Melrose (Melrose
Law), Law Offices of Kenneth J. Melrose, LLC (Melrose LLC), BMS Legal Services
LLC (BMS Legal), Stephen Solender (Solender), Stephen Solender dba The Solender
Group (Solender Group), The Solender Group, Inc. (Solender Inc.), Yangkyoung
Lee (Lee), Michael Manapol (Manapol), First Indemnity Insurance Agency, Inc.
(First Indemnity), Eric Canton (Canton), and Does 1 through 400 inclusive.
The operative October 18, 2023
Complaint alleges claims of (1) Fraud, Conspiracy, Aiding and Abetting, (2)
Breach of Fiduciary Duty, Conspiracy, Aiding and Abetting, (3) Breach of
Fiduciary Duty, (4) Professional Negligence, (5) Statutory Violations, (6)
Conversion, (7) Fraud, Conspiracy, Aiding and Abetting, (8) Breach of Fiduciary
Duty, Conspiracy, Aiding and Abetting, (9) Breach of Contract, (10) Negligence,
(11) Breach of Third-Party Beneficiary Contract, and (12) Tortious Breach of
the Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing (Bad Faith).
The claims arise from the following
allegations. Plaintiff Howard retained Brian Witzer (Witzer) and his
corporation, Law Offices of Brian D. Witzer (Witzer Law) (both in bankruptcy
proceedings), to represent Howard in a personal injury lawsuit arising from
injuries sustained by Plaintiff Howard because of a construction site incident,
with the case allegedly valued at $20 million (the Personal Injury Case;
Riverside Superior Court Case No. PSC1901153.) While representing Plaintiff
Howard, Witzer and Witzer Law misappropriated at least “six-figures” of funds
belonging to Plaintiff Howard, with Melrose and Melrose Law participating in
mishandling the Personal Injury Case, e.g., hiring Defendant Lee to work on the
Personal Injury Case on behalf of Plaintiff under circumstances where Lee had
previously worked for the defense in that same case, leading to the
disqualification of Witzer, Witzer Law, and the Melrose Defendants as counsel
in the Personal Injury Case.
Motions Before the Court
On October 10, 2023, Defendant Lee
filed a demurrer challenging the Complaint and the claims alleged against Lee.
That same day, Defendant Lee filed
a motion to strike the punitive damages, attorney’s fees, and treble damages
allegations and/or prayers from the Complaint.
On February 8, 2024, Plaintiff filed
a combined partial opposition to the demurrer and motion to strike, which withdraws
Plaintiff’s claims against Defendant Lee but seeks leave to amend to modify the
allegations stated against Lee.
On February 15, 2024, Defendant Lee
filed a combined reply responding to the combined opposition, which argues that
the demurrer should be sustained, the motion to strike granted, and leave to
amend denied.
Defendant Lee’s demurrer and motion
to strike are now before the Court.
 
Demurrer
Demurrer Sufficiency Standard
A demurrer for sufficiency tests
whether the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007)
147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747; see Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e).) This
device can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the
pleading under attack or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially
noticeable. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) To sufficiently allege a cause of action,
a complaint must allege all the ultimate facts—that is, the facts needed to establish
each element of the cause of action pleaded. (Committee on Children’s
Television, Inc. v. General Foods Corp. (1983) 35 Cal.3d 197, 212,
superseded by statute as stated in Branick v. Downey Savings & Loan
Assn. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 235, 242.) Thus, “[t]o survive a
[general] demurrer, the complaint need only allege facts sufficient to state a
cause of action; each evidentiary fact that might eventually form part of the
plaintiff’s proof need not be alleged.” (C.A. v. William S. Hart Union High
School Dist. (2012) 53 Cal.4th 861, 872.) In testing the sufficiency of the
cause of action, the demurrer admits the truth of all material facts properly
pleaded. (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962,
966-67.) A demurrer, however, “does not admit contentions, deductions or
conclusions of fact or law.” (Daar v. Yellow Cab Co. (1967) 67 Cal.2d
695, 713.) When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally
and in context. (Taylor v. City of Los Angeles Dept. of Water and Power
(2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228, disapproved on other grounds, Jones v.
Lodge at Torrey Pines Partnership (2008) 42 Cal.4th 1158, 1162.) The face
of the complaint includes exhibits attached to the complaint. (Frantz v.
Blackwell (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 91, 94.) If facts appearing in the exhibits
contradict those alleged, the facts in the exhibits take precedence. (Holland
v. Morse Diesel Intern., Inc. (2001) 86 Cal.App.4th 1443, 1447, superseded
by statute on other grounds as stated in White v. Cridlebaugh (2009) 178
Cal.App.4th 506, 521.)
Uncertainty Legal Standard 
A demurrer to a pleading lies where
the pleading is uncertain, ambiguous, or unintelligible. (Code Civ. Proc. §
430.10, subd. (f).) “A demurrer for uncertainty is strictly construed, even
where a complaint is in some respects uncertain, because ambiguities can be
clarified under modern discovery procedures.” (Khoury v. Maly’s of
California, Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616, disapproved on other
grounds in Quelimane Co. v. Stewart Title Guar. Co. (1998) 19 Cal.4th
26, 46 [holding claims for unfair business practices need not be pled
specifically, impliedly disapproving Khoury].) As a result, a special
demurrer for uncertainty is not intended to reach failure to incorporate
sufficient facts in the pleading but is directed only at uncertainty existing
in the allegations already made. (People v. Taliaferro (1957) 149
Cal.App.2d 822, 825, disapproved on other grounds in Jefferson v. J.E.
French Co. (1960) 54 Cal.2d 717, 719-720 [statute of limitations question].)
Where complaint is sufficient to state a cause of action and to apprise
defendant of issues he is to meet, it is not properly subject to a special
demurrer for uncertainty. (See ibid.; see also Gressley v. Williams
(1961) 193 Cal.App.2d 636, 643 [“A special demurrer [for uncertainty] should be
overruled where the allegations of the complaint are sufficiently clear to
apprise the defendant of the issues which he is to meet”].)
Motion to Strike Legal Standard
The court may, upon a motion or at
any time in its discretion and upon terms it deems proper: (a) strike out any
irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading; or (b) strike
out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the
laws of California, a court rule, or an order of the court. (Code Civ. Proc. §
436, subds. (a), (b); Stafford v. Shultz (1954) 42 Cal.2d 767, 782
[“Matter in a pleading which is not essential to the claim is surplusage;
probative facts are surplusage and may be stricken out or disregarded”].)
For the purposes of a motion to
strike pursuant to Sections 435 to 437 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the term
“pleading” generally means a demurrer, answer, complaint, or cross-complaint,
(Code Civ. Proc., § 435, subd. (a)), and an immaterial allegation or irrelevant
matter in a pleading entails (1) an allegation that is not essential to the
statement of a claim or defense, (2) an allegation that is neither pertinent to
nor supported by an otherwise sufficient claim or defense, or (3) a demand for
judgment requesting relief not supported by the allegations of the complaint or
cross-complaint (Code Civ. Proc., § 431.10, subds. (b)(1)-(3), (c)).
I.
Demurrer and Motion to Strike:
MOOT.
In his opposition, Plaintiff Howard
“withdraws the First, Second, Third, and Fourth Causes of Action as against Ms.
Lee, but seeks leave to amend as to the Tenth Cause of Action [to add Ms. Lee
to that Negligence claim, where she was previously inadvertently omitted as a
Defendant on that claim] and to add a new ‘stand alone’ cause of action against
her for breach of fiduciary duty.” The request for leave to amend entails
granting leave to amend by no later than April 1, 2024, the date on which
Plaintiff’s opposition to a demurrer by the Melrose Defendants is due—i.e.,
nine court days prior to the hearing date of April 15, 2024 pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure section 1005, subdivision (b). (Opp’n, pp. 3-4.)
The demurrer and motion to strike are
thus MOOT insofar as no operative claims are currently alleged against
Defendant Lee.
In reply, Defendant Lee argues that
the demurrer should be sustained and the motion to strike granted based on the
merit lent to those motions by Plaintiff’s opposition. Defendant Lee further
argues that leave to amend should not be granted because Plaintiff should file
a motion requesting that relief and because Plaintiff fails to cite authority
allowing a party to seek leave to amend a pleading in an opposition to a motion
challenging that same pleading. (Reply, ¶¶ 1-7.)
The Court finds in favor of
Plaintiff Howard in relation to leave to amend.
Had the Court sustained the
demurrer and granted the motion to strike, the Court would likely have granted
leave to amend since leave to amend is routinely granted. Plaintiff Howard’s
concession short-circuits that process by conceding an amendment could benefit
the sufficiency of the allegations directed against Defendant Lee and asking
for leave to amend to add those allegations by bolstering a negligence claim
and adding a new breach of fiduciary duty claim.
Plaintiff also noted that there is
another demurrer on calendar—filed by the Melrose Defendants, and to be heard
on April 15, 2024—in response to which Plaintiff intends to file an amended
complaint pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 472, subdivision (a), on
or before April 1, 2024. In light of Cesar Chavez Day on April 1, 2024, the
Court observes the amended pleading would need to be filed instead by the
Friday before, March 29, 2024. (See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 10, 12, 12a, 12c, 1005,
subd. (b).) 
The Court determines that while
this request seeks a facially overextended period (over a month) to allege new
pleadings against Defendant Lee, this request most conforms with the Court’s
interest in efficiently managing the litigation and ensuring the orderly
administration of justice.
“California courts retain the
ability to manage the litigation before them by means of case-specific orders,
provided that those orders are consistent with California law and afford
litigants due process.” (In re Harley C. (2019) 37 Cal.App.5th 494, 501,
citing Rutherford[ v. Rutherford v. Owens-Illinois, Inc. (1997)
16 Cal.4th 953, 967 (Rutherford); Rutherford, supra, at p.
967 [Trial courts are “entitle[d] to exercise reasonable control over all
proceedings connected with pending litigation … in order to ensure the orderly
administration of justice”].)
Were the Court to grant leave to
amend on the motions now before the Court, with leave confined to, for example,
ten days, the Melrose Defendants’ demurrer set to be heard on April 15, 2024
would be mooted, and Plaintiff could need to file a motion for leave to file a
second amended pleading to make the amendments Plaintiff intends to make by
March 29, 2024 (not April 1, 2024). This, in turn, would create oppositions,
replies, and other papers and filings that will extend the litigation rather
than focus on the merits of the case.
On the other end, if the Court
grants leave to amend for the time requested, Plaintiff can file one updated
and consolidated first amended pleading that can address the arguments raised
by Defendant Lee’s demurrer and motion to strike, as well as the arguments
raised by the Melrose Defendants’ demurrer. Defendant Lee and the Melrose
Defendants would thereafter be able to challenge that pleading.
Here, the Court finds that the
latter circumstance—leave through nine court days prior to the April 15, 2024
hearing—is preferable to the time and resources that would be lost by the Court
and the parties in failing to allow one single consolidated pleading to be
filed by that date.
The Court also notes that Defendant
Lee was afforded due process insofar as she had the ability to respond to
Plaintiff’s request for leave to amend in the reply. Moreover, the Court’s
posting of any tentative rulings and oral argument by Lee’s counsel afford
Defendant Lee due process.
Leave to amend is thus proper.
The Court nevertheless notes that Plaintiff
Howard could have filed an ex parte application to continue this hearing to
April 15, 2024 to be heard concurrently with the hearing on the Melrose
Defendants’ demurrer. This simple application, had it been granted, would have
avoided the leave-to-amend conundrum now before the Court.
Conclusion
Per Plaintiff Nathaniel Howard’s
opposition request, the first through fourth causes of action are withdrawn as
to Defendant Yankyoung Lee and are thus STRICKEN by the Court as to Defendant
Lee. (Code Civ. Proc., § 436.)
As a result, Defendant Yankyoung
Lee’s Demurrer to Plaintiff’s Complaint is MOOT.
Similarly, Defendant Yankyoung
Lee’s Motion to Strike Portions from Plaintiff’s Complaint is MOOT.
Plaintiff SHALL file an amended
pleading no later than March 29, 2024, limiting any amended pleading in
relation to Defendant Lee to the parameters outlined in Plaintiff Nathaniel
Howard’s opposition to the motions now before the Court.
