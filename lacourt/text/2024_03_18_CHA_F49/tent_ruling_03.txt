Case    # 23CHCV01091      LOS  ANGELES SUPERIOR COURT NORTH  VALLEY DISTRICT DEPARTMENT  F49    MARCH 18,  2024    MOTION TO COMPEL DEFENDANT JOSE ROBERTO  GONZALEZ DBA JRG TRUCKING’S RESPONSES TO REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS  AND THINGS, SET ONE, AND REQUEST FOR SANCTIONS  Los Angeles Superior Court Case # 23CHCV01091    Motion  filed: 2/13/24   MOVING PARTY: Plaintiff Hugo Moisa-Archila (“Plaintiff”)  RESPONDING PARTY: Defendant Jose Roberto Gonzalez dba  JRG Trucking (“Gonzalez”)  NOTICE: ok    RELIEF  REQUESTED: An  order compelling Defendant to provide responses, without objections, to  Plaintiff’s Request for Production of Documents and Things, Set One, and  awarding Plaintiff monetary sanctions in the amount of $2,311.65.   TENTATIVE  RULING: The  motion is DENIED AS MOOT. The Request for Monetary Sanctions is GRANTED IN PART.  Defendant’s objections asserted in his responses to Plaintiff’s Request for  Production of Documents and Things, Set One, are OVERRULED.   BACKGROUND   On April 14, 2023, Plaintiff initiated this action against  Defendants Gonzalez, Alicia Ranee Levalley, Jose Manual Armando Lorenzo-Reyes  (collectively, “Defendants”), and Does 1 to 100 for motor vehicle negligence.  The Complaint alleges that Plaintiff sustained personal injuries and property  damages as a result of a motor vehicle incident that occurred on May 2, 2022.  Subsequently, on May 8, 2023, Defendant Gonzalez filed his Answer to the  Complaint.    On February 13, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to Compel  Defendant Gonzalez’s Responses to Plaintiff’s Request for Production of  Documents and Things, Set One (the “Motion”). Additionally, Plaintiff requests monetary  sanctions against Defendant Gonzalez and his counsel.     On March 12, 2024, Defendant Gonzalez filed an Opposition  to the Motion, without an accompanying Memorandum, simply stating that he had  served Plaintiff with his responses on March 7, 2024. (Opp’n. at 2.)   No Reply has been received by the Court.   ANALYSIS   “Within 30 days after service of a demand for inspection, copying,  testing, or sampling, the party to whom the demand is directed shall serve the  original of the response to it on the party making the demand, and a copy of  the response on all other parties who have appeared in the action, unless on  motion of the party making the demand, the court has shortened the time for  response, or unless on motion of the party to whom the demand has been  directed, the court has extended the time for response.” (Code Civ. Proc.  § 2031.260, subd. (a).)   “If a party to whom a demand for  inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a timely  response to it, the following rules shall apply:   (a) The party to whom the  demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed waives any  objection to the demand, including one based on privilege or on the protection  for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010). The court,  on motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its determination that  both of the following conditions are satisfied:   (1) The party has  subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance with Sections  2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230, 2031.240, and 2031.280.   (2) The party’s failure to  serve a timely response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable  neglect.   (b) The party making the  demand may move for an order compelling response to the demand.   (c) Except as provided in  subdivision (d), the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7  (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who  unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand for  inspection, copying, testing, or sampling, unless it finds that the one subject  to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other  circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”    (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.300,  subd. (a), (b), (c).) A. Defendant Gonzalez Has Waived All Objections to  the Demand Due to Untimely Responses under C.C.P. 2031.300 (a)   Here, Defendant Gonzalez opposes the Motion on the basis  that he served his responses to Plaintiff’s Request for Production of Documents  and Things, Set One (the “Request”), on March 7, 2024. (Opp’n., at 2.)   Here, Plaintiff initially propounded and served the Request  on Defendant Gonzalez on August 22, 2023. (Lallande Decl., ¶ 1.) Subsequently,  , Plaintiff granted Defendant Gonzalez an extension to respond on September 22,  2023, moving the deadline to October 22, 2023. (Id., ¶ 7, Ex. “3.”) Following  this, despite multiple attempts by Plaintiff’s counsel to obtain status updates  and responses from Defendant Gonzalez between November 14, 2023, and January 4,  2023, no responses were received as of the filing of the instant Motion. (Id.,  ¶¶ 8 – 11.)   Defendant Gonzales eventually served his verified responses  to the Request on March 7, 2024 (Opp’n., at 2), which significantly past the agreed  deadline of October 22, 2023. This delay results in an untimely response, leading  to the waiver waived of any objection to the demand, including those based on  privilege or on the protection for work product, under Code of Civil Procedure  section 2031.300 subdivision (a).   Furthermore, Defendant Gonzalez does not assert that his  failure to serve a timely response was due to mistake, inadvertence, or  excusable neglect, nor does he seek relief from the waiver of objections under  Code of Civil Procedure, section 2031.300 subdivision (a).    Accordingly, the Count finds Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel  Responses to Request for Production of Documents and Things, Set One, to be  MOOT due to the service of responses by Defendant Gonzalez before the  hearing.     However, due to the untimely service of the responses by  Defendant Gonzalez, the Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s request, deeming Defendant  Gonzalez has waived any objections under Code of Civil Procedure section  2031.300 subdivision (a),    Therefore, the Court DENIES AS MOOT Plaintiff’s Motion to  Compel Responses to Request for Production and Things, Set One.   Additionally, the Court OVERRULES any objections asserted  in Defendant’s responses to the Request.   B. Sanctions               Plaintiff seeks monetary sanctions  under both Code of Civil Procedure sections 2023.010 et seq., and 2031.300.   Monetary sanctions, as outlined under Code of Civil  Procedure section 2031.300 subdivision (c) are mandatory against any party,  person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a  response to a demand.  Given that the  Court has concluded that the Motion to be MOOT, except for OVERRULING the objections  asserted by Defendant in his response, it determines that the mandatory  sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.300 subdivision (c) do not  apply in this instance.               However, the Court finds that  permissive sanctions, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 2023.010 et  seq. are warranted due to Defendant’s untimely response.                Accordingly, the Court awards  monetary sanctions to Plaintiff against Defendant Jose Roberto Gonzalez dba JRG  Trucking and his counsel of record, jointly and severally, in a reasonable  amount of $1,061.65, which is calculated based on a reasonable hourly rate of  $500.00 (Lallande Decl., ¶ 13) for a total of 2 hours, plus $61.65 filing fees.     Therefore, the Court GRANTS IN PART Plaintiff’s Request for  Monetary Sanctions, totaling $1,061.65.   CONCLUSION   Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Defendant Jose Roberto Gonzalez dba JRG Trucking’s Responses  to Request for Production of Documents and Things, Set One, is DENIED AS MOOT.   Plaintiff’s Request for Monetary Sanctions is GRANTED IN  PART.   The objections asserted by Defendant Jose Roberto Gonzalez dba JRG Trucking in his Responses to  Plaintiff’s Request for Production of Documents and Things, Set One, are  OVERRULED.   Defendant Jose Roberto Gonzalez  dba JRG Trucking and his attorney of record are ordered, jointly and severally,  to pay Plaintiff monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,061.65 within 10 days  of this order.   Moving part is ordered to provide notice of this order.
