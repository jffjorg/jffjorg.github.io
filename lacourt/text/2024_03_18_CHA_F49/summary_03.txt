And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Moisa-Archila v. Jose Roberto Gonzalez dba JRG Trucking, et al., Case Number 23CHCV01091. The case involves a motion to compel defendant's responses to a request for production of documents and things, set one, and a request for monetary sanctions.

The Judge has denied the motion to compel as moot, finding that the defendant has served his responses to the request for production before the hearing. However, the Judge has granted the request for monetary sanctions in part, finding that the defendant's untimely response warrants sanctions.

The Judge has also overruled the defendant's objections to the request for production and has ordered the defendant and his counsel to pay the plaintiff monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,061.65 within 10 days of the order.
