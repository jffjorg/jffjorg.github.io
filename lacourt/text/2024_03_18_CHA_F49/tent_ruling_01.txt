  Case Number:  23CHCV00168    Hearing Date:   March 18, 2024    Dept:  F49    Dept.    F49      Date:    3/18/24     Case    Name: Miguel Ascencion v. General Motors LLC, et al.     Case    # 23CHCV00168      LOS  ANGELES SUPERIOR COURT NORTH  VALLEY DISTRICT DEPARTMENT  F49    MARCH 18,  2024    MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER  RESPONSES TO REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS, AND REQUEST FOR SANCTIONS  Los Angeles Superior Court Case # 23CHCV00168    Motion  filed: 8/7/23   MOVING PARTY: Plaintiff Miguel Ascencion (“Plaintiff”)  RESPONDING PARTY: Defendant General Motors, LLC (“Defendant”  or “GM”)  NOTICE: ok    RELIEF  REQUESTED: An  order compelling Defendant GM to provide further responses to Plaintiff’s  Request for Production of Documents, and awarding Plaintiff monetary sanctions  in the amount of $3,210.00.   TENTATIVE  RULING: The  motion is GRANTED. The request for monetary sanction is GRANTED IN PART.   BACKGROUND   Plaintiff brings this action under the Song-Beverly Consumer  Warranty Act (Civil Code §§ 1790 et seq.) over alleged defects in his 2022  Chevrolet Silverado 1500 (the “Vehicle”), which was manufactured by Defendant  GM. Plaintiff alleges that he entered a warranty contract with GM regarding the  Vehicle on July 12, 2022.    On January 20, 2023, Plaintiff initiated this action against  Defendants GM and Does 1 through 10 (collectively, “Defendants”). The Complaint  alleges for two causes of action: (1) violation of Song-Beverly Act – breach of  warranty; and (2) violation of Song-Beverly Act – breach of implied warranty.  Subsequently, GM filed its Answer to the Complaint on February 24, 2023.   On August 7, 2023, Plaintiff filed the  instant motion (the “Motion”).    On October 23, 2023, GM filed its Opposition. Subsequently,  on November 2, 2024, Plaintiff filed his Reply.   ANALYSIS   A motion to compel further responses to a demand for  inspection or production of documents (“RFP”) may be brought based on: (1)  incomplete statements of compliance; (2) inadequate, evasive or incomplete  claims of inability to comply; or (3) unmerited or overly generalized  objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310(a).)  Code of Civil Procedure section  2031.310 subdivision (h) provides, in part, that “Except as provided in subdivision  (j) [inapplicable here], the court shall impose a monetary sanction  under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person,  or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel further  response to a demand, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction  acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the  imposition of the sanction unjust.”  A.     All  Procedural Requirements Are Met   1.       45-Day Rule “Unless notice of this motion  [to compel further responses to production of documents] is given within 45  days of the service of the verified response, or any supplemental verified  response, or on or before any specific later date to which the propounding  party and the responding party have agreed in writing, the propounding party  waives any right to compel a further response to the demand for productions.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (c).)   GM served its responses to  Defendants’ Request for Production of Documents, Set One, with verifications on  July 25, 2023. (Yaraghchian Decl., ¶ 3.) Plaintiff filed the instant Motion on August  7, 2023, within the 45-day rule limit.  2.       Meet and Confer A motion to compel further  responses to demand for productions must be accompanied by a meet and confer  declaration. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (b)(2).)             Plaintiff sent a meet and confer  letter to Defendant on May 26, 2023, outlining the deficiencies in GM’s  responses and objections. (Thomas Decl., ¶ 10.) Following this, Plaintiff sent  a second meet and confer letter on June 23, 2023, further explaining  Plaintiff’s request. (Id., ¶ 12.) Subsequently, on July 5, 203, GM  responded to Plaintiff’s June 23, 2023, meet and confer letter. (Id., ¶  13.) On July 20, 2023, GM also produced additional documents subject to a  stipulated protective order. (Id., ¶ 15.) However, the parties were  unable to achieve an informal resolution of this dispute before the filing of  the instant Motion. (Id., ¶ 19.)               Therefore, the Court determines that  the meet and confer requirements as specified in Code of Civil Procedure  section 2031.310 subdivision (b)(2) are satisfied.   3.       Separate Statement A motion to compel further  responses to a demand for production must be accompanied by a separate  statement. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(a)(3).) “A separate statement is a  separate document filed and served with the discovery motion that provides all  the information necessary to understand each discovery request and all the  responses to it that are at issue.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(c).) Plaintiff  has met the above requirement by filing a separate statement explaining the  demand for production at issue, Plaintiff’s responses, and why further  responses are necessary.   B.      Good Cause A  motion to compel further responses to requests for production shall “set forth  specific facts showing good cause”. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310(b)(1).) To  establish “good cause,” the moving party must show (1) the items demanded are  relevant to the subject matter and (2) specific facts justify discovery of the  requested items (e.g., why such information is necessary for trial preparation  or to prevent surprise at trial). (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310(b)(1); see Glenfed  Develop. Corp. v. Sup. Ct. (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 1113, 1117.) If “good  cause” is shown by the moving party, the burden is then on the responding party  to justify any objections made to document disclosure. (Kirkland v. Sup. Ct.  (2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 92, 98.)   Here,  the Motion concerns GM’s responses to Request for Production (“RFP”) Nos. 16,  19-32, 37-41, and 45-46.   Plaintiff’s  RFP Nos. 16 and 19-32 are aimed at obtaining documents related to GM’s general  policies and procedures relied upon when handling vehicle repurchase or  replacement.    Plaintiff  argues that these documents are relevant to the case at bar because they could  reveal whether Defendant maintains a policy that systematically violates the  Song-Beverly Act. (Mot., at 5.) (See¿Civ. Code §§  1791.1, 1793.2, 1794; Oregel¿v. American Isuzu Motors, Inc.¿(2001) 90  Cal.App.4th 1094; Johnson v. Ford Motors Company (2005) 35 Cal.4th 1191;  Kwan v. Mercedes-Benz of North America (1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 174, 186.)    Plaintiff’s  RFP Nos. 37-41 are focused on acquiring documents that would explain the  various codes used as shorthand in the repair orders and other internal  documents produced by Defendant.    Plaintiff maintains that understanding these codes is  relevant and material to an analysis of whether Plaintiff is entitled to civil  penalties for any willful violation of the Song-Beverly Act. (Mot., at 7.)  Specifically, these codes are deemed essential for interpreting the repair  orders and internal GM documents produced in this litigation, and to prove that  GM has a record of the same or similar issues for the year, make and model of  the Subject Vehicle, and that GM has knowledge of the same or similar issues  and consumer complaints. (Ibid.)      Plaintiff’s RFP Nos. 45-46 aim  to uncover how GM’s handles similarly situated consumers’ complaints concerning  the same problems, with the same year, make, and model of vehicle as the  Plaintiff’s vehicle.    Plaintiff  argues that these documents are material to prove his cause of action under the  Song-Beverly Act. Specifically, Plaintiff must demonstrate that the vehicle had  a defect covered by GM's warranty that substantially impaired its use, value, or  safety, and that GM failed to repair this defect after a reasonable number of attempts  to repair it. (Civ. Code §§ 1790 et seq.; CACI No. 3201.)    The  Court agrees with Plaintiff that the information sought about other similar  vehicle complaints could indicate a pervasive defect or non-conformity, potentially  showing GM’s awareness of the issue or its inaction in response. (See Santana  v. FCA US LLC (2020) 56.Cal.App.5th 334; Donlen v. Ford Motor Company (2013)  217 Cal.App.4th 138, 154 [“‘other vehicle testimony was not unduly prejudicial.  It did not concern simply other vehicles. It was limited to the [defective  component] in [p]laintiff’s truck and other vehicles. [plaintiff’s expert]  described what Ford itself had done to notify dealers and technicians about  problems with this [defective component] model. Thus, everything about which  they testified that applied to other vehicles applied equally to [p]laintiff’s  vehicle. Such evidence certainly was probative and not unduly prejudicial.”].)               Based  on these arguments, the Court concludes that good  cause exists. The burden now shifts to Defendant to justify its objections. C.     Objections   1.       Relevance “[D]oubts  as to relevance should generally be  resolved in favor of permitting discovery … An appellate court cannot reverse a  trial court’s grant of discovery under a ‘relevancy’ attack unless it concludes  that the answers sought by a given line of questioning cannot as a reasonable  possibility lead to the discovery of admissible evidence or be helpful in  preparation for trial.”  (Colonial Life & Accident Ins. Co.  v. Sup. Ct. (1982) 31 Cal. 3d 785, 790 (quoting Pacific Tel. & Tel.  Co. v. Sup. Ct. (1970) 2 Cal.3d 161, 173).)    Here,  Plaintiffs’ claims under the Song-Beverly Act include allegations for breach of  the express warranty and breach of the implied warranty. Plaintiffs’ requests  are aiming at uncovering information related to GM’s awareness and lack of  action regarding defects in vehicles of the same make, model, and year.  Additionally, they seek documents related to Defendant’s warranty, and  policies, procedures, and practices concerning vehicle repurchase.    Giving  this context, the Court concludes that it is reasonably possible that  admissible evidence may be discovered by these requests. Accordingly, the Court finds  the requests relevant. 2.       Overbroad “[The]  rules are applied liberally in favor of discovery [Citations], and (contrary to  popular belief), fishing expeditions are permissible in some cases. (Gonzalez  v. Sup. Ct. (1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 1539, 1546.) The key question is whether  a discovery request is “reasonably calculated to lead to discovery of  admissible evidence. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2017.010 (emphasis added).) The court  weighs the cost, time, expense, and disruption of normal business against the  probative value of the material which might be disclosed. (Calcor Space  Facility, Inc. v. Sup. Ct. (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 216, 223.) The burden  rests on the propounding party to provide evidence for a court to determine if  these conditions are met. (Id.)     Here, Plaintiff’s RFPs are specifically  tailored to gather information about the particular defects nonconformities  noted in the repair orders and other documents produced by Defendant concerning  the Subject Vehicle. Moreover, Plaintiff’s RFP Nos. 19-32 and 40-41 are scoped  to only include documents created since 2022.    Therefore,  Plaintiff’s RFP Nos. at issue are not overbroad. 3.       Trade Secret  Material The  party claiming a trade secret privilege has the burden of establishing its  existence.  (Bridgestone/Firestone, Inc. v. Superior Court (1992) 7  Cal.App.4th 1384, 1393.) The propounding party must then make a showing that  the discovery sought is relevant and necessary to proving or defending against  an element of one or more causes of action in the case and that it is  reasonably essential to resolving the lawsuit. (Id.) Upon this showing,  it is up to the holder of the privilege to show that a protective order would  be inadequate. (Id.) “Either party may propose or oppose less intrusive  alternatives to disclosure of the trade secret, but the burden is upon the  trade secret claimant to demonstrate that an alternative to disclosure will not  be unduly burdensome to the opposing side and that it will maintain the same  fair balance in the litigation that would have been achieved by disclosure.” (Id.)    GM  alleges that trade secrets are involved in relation to Plaintiff’s RFP Nos. at  issue. In support, Defendant provides the declaration of Huizhen Lu, which elaborates  on the types of trade secrets that may form part of discovery as a result of  Plaintiffs’ motion. (Opp’n., at 8, Yaraghchian Decl., Ex. “A.”)   However,  GM has not provided any argumentation or evidence demonstrating that a  protective order would be inadequate to safeguard its trade secrets. Notably,  GM and Plaintiff previously stipulated to the LASC Model Stipulated Protective  Order on June 23, 2023. (Thomas Decl., ¶ 14.)   Accordingly,  the Court finds that Defendant GM has not carried its burden to show that a  protective order would be inadequate.    The Court GRANTS  Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Further Responses to Request for Production of  Documents, Nos. 16,  19-32, 37-41, and 45-46. D.     Opposition –  Responsive Documents Have Already Been Produced.   GM asserts  that it has already produced “its Warranty Policy & Procedure Manual and  the policies and procedures used to evaluate lemon law claims” and “repurchase  requests” in response to Request for Production Nos. 16 and 19-32. (Opp’n., at  7.) Moreover, in response to Request for Production Nos. 45 and 46, GM claims  that it has already produced “other customer complaints within GM’s ESI  database that are substantially similar to Plaintiffs’ complaints concerning  the alleged defects, for vehicles purchased in California of the same year,  make and model as the Subject Vehicle.” (Ibid.) GM argues that there is no  further action for this Court to compel.             In  the response, Plaintiff acknowledges the receipt of some documents from GM in  relation to RFP Nos. 16, and 19-32 on July 23, 2023, subsequent to Plaintiff signing  GM’s LASC Model Protective Order. However, Plaintiff notes that GM has refused  to produce documents responsive to Requests Nos. 37-41, and maintains that GM’s  document production fails to comply with Code of Civil Procedure § 2031.280  subdivision (a), which sets forth that any documents or category of documents produced in  response to a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling must be  identified with the specific request number to which the documents respond.”  (Code Civ.  Proc., § 2031.280, subd. (a), Reply, at 2, Mot., 4.)               Here,  Plaintiff highlights an issue that GM’s document production, pointing out that  it consists of several hundred .pdf files identified only by a Bates number  without an index or any method to identify these documents by title or subject  matter. (Thomas Decl., ¶¶ 6, 9, 15.)                GM  has not directly addressed Plaintiff’s contention regarding the non-compliance with  Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.280 subdivision (a).                Given  the circumstances, the Court concludes that GM should be compelled to either  provide a new set of documents with titles for each file or to supply an index  sufficiently identifying which documents in its previous production correspond  to each of requests, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.280  subdivision (a). E.      Sanctions Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section  2031.310, subdivision (h), the Court concludes that Defendant GM and its’  counsel may be properly subjected to monetary sanctions against them, jointly  and severally, for unsuccessfully opposing the instant Motion. Plaintiff has requested monetary sanctions in the  amount of $3,200.00 based on an hourly rate of $450.00 for a total of 7 hours  of work, in addition to $60.00 filing fee. (Thomas Decl., ¶ 22.) The Court finds  the hourly rate to be reasonable but adjusts the total number of hours to a  reasonable 5.5 hours. This time allocation includes 3 hours for drafting the  Motion, 2 hours for reviewing the Opposition and preparing the Reply, and 0.5  hours anticipated for attending the hearing. Consequently, this adjustment  results in a total of $2,535.00, calculated based on $450/hr. x 5.5 hours. +  $60.00 filing fee. Therefore, the Court GRANTS IN PART Plaintiff’s  request for monetary sanctions, awarding a total amount of $2,535.00.   CONCLUSION   Plaintiff’s  Motion to Compel GM’s Further Responses to Request for Production of Documents,  Set One, Nos. 16, 19-32, 37-41, and 45-46 is GRANTED.   Plaintiff’s  Request for Monetary Sanction is GRANTED IN PART.   Defendant  GM is ordered to provide verified supplemental responses, without objections,  to Request  for Production of Documents, Set One, Nos. 16, 19-32, 37-41,  and 45-46, within 15 days.   Defendant  GM and its counsel of record are ordered, jointly and severally, to pay  Plaintiff monetary sanctions in the amount of $2,535.00 within 15 days.   Moving  party is ordered to provide notice of this order.
