And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The court has granted the plaintiff's motion to amend the judgment to add prejudgment interest. The plaintiff is entitled to prejudgment interest under Civil Code section 3287(a) due to the defendant's wrongful withholding of funds. The court calculated the prejudgment interest to be $159,728.00, based on an annual interest rate of 7% per annum. The court also determined that the breach of fiduciary duty and conversion occurred in 2019, and therefore, the prejudgment interest began to accrue from July 1, 2019. The court ordered the plaintiff to prepare and file a proposed amended judgment reflecting the prejudgment interest within 10 days of the order.
