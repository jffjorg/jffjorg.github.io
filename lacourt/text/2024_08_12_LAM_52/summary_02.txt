```

And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling denies the City of Beverly Hills' motion for summary judgment, which argued that the statute of limitations bars all causes of action. The court finds that the plaintiff, Margaret K. Vodrey, was not required to sue decades before the landslide occurred because she did not have notice of the potential instability of the hillside.

The court grants the defendant's motion for summary adjudication of the second cause of action, which is the claim for a dangerous condition of public property, as the plaintiff does not oppose the motion.

The court denies the defendant's motion for summary adjudication of the third cause of action, which is the claim for nuisance, as there are triable issues of material fact. The court finds that the interference with the plaintiff's property was not insubstantial and that a reasonable trier of fact could find that the harm to the plaintiff outweighs the social utility of the defendant's conduct.
