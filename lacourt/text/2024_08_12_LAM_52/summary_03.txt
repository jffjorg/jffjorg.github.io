And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motions to deem the truth of the matters specified in the requests for admissions to both defendants. The plaintiff had served the requests for admissions to both defendants by mail on May 17, 2024, but neither defendant had served a timely response by July 15, 2024. As a result, the plaintiff is entitled to an order deeming the truth of the matters specified in the requests admitted. The judge also orders each defendant to pay the plaintiff $1,035 in sanctions within 30 days for their failure to serve a timely response.
