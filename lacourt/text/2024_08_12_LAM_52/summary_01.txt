And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendant's demurrer to the plaintiff's complaint. The defendant argues that the complaint is invalid because there is another action pending between the same parties on the same cause of action. The Judge agrees that there is another action pending, but instead of sustaining the special demurrer, the Judge will order the two actions consolidated. The Judge notes that sustaining a special demurrer does not justify a subsequent dismissal of the action without leave to amend. The Judge has ordered the actions consolidated for all purposes, making the defendant's demurrer moot.
