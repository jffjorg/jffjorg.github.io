  Case Number:  22STCV28415    Hearing Date:   August 12, 2024    Dept:  52 Defendant Interinsurance Exchange of the Automobile
Club’s Demurrer to Complaint        
            Defendant Interinsurance Exchange of
the Automobile Club specially demurs to plaintiff Gail Wiggan’s complaint on
the grounds that “[t]here is another action pending between the same parties on
the same cause of action.”  (CCP §
430.10(c).)  
            There is another action pending
between the same parties on the same causes of action.  Plaintiff filed the same action twice.  In plaintiff’s prior motion to consolidate
the actions, she acknowledged the complaints were “duplicate filings.”  (Motion to Consolidate, p. 3.)  The court denied plaintiff’s motion without
prejudice because plaintiff had not filed adequate proof of service of the
moving papers.  The court found the two
actions related on July 9, 2024.  
            Sustaining a special demurrer because there is another
action pending “does not justify a subsequent dismissal of the action without
leave to amend.”  (Shuffer v. Board of Trustees
(1977) 67 Cal.App.3d 208, 217.)  “[E]ven
when a plea in abatement is valid and should be sustained, a good practice in
such a situation ‘would be for the trial judge to recognize the technical
sufficiency of the plea in abatement, and then to order the actions
consolidated.’ ”  (Id. at pp. 217–218.)  Rather than sustaining the special demurrer,
the court will order the actions consolidated.
            On its own motion, the court hereby consolidates the
related actions, No. 22STCV28415 and No. 22STCV28591, for all purposes.  Defendant’s demurrer is moot.
