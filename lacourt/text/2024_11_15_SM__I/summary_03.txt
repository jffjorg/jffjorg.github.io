And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a request to continue the trial due to the lead counsel for the plaintiff expecting a child on or before November 23, 2024. The judge is puzzled as to why the parties waited until less than two weeks before the event to bring this to the court's attention, and questions why so much discovery remains to be done. Despite these concerns, the judge is likely to continue the trial, but makes no promises about when it will be rescheduled. The judge will discuss possible trial dates at the hearing, including mid-2025 and 2026, but is unsure if the court can accommodate a trial date in 2025 or the first part of 2026.
