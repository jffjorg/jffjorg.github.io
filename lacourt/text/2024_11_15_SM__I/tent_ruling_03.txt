 Case Number:  23SMCV01223    Hearing Date:   November 15, 2024    Dept:  I The court is in receipt of the ex parte request to
continue the trial.  The reason given is
that lead counsel for plaintiff is expecting his first child on or before
November 23, 2024, and a December 23, 2024, trial date will be difficult in
light of that.  What the court does not
understand is why the parties waited until less than two weeks before the event
to bring this to the court’s attention. 
This should have been raised six months ago.  The court also does not understand why so
much discovery remains to be done. 
 
The court will inquire about that, but the court is not that
heartless.  The court is likely to
continue the trial notwithstanding those misgivings.  However, the court makes no promises as to
when the trial will be re-set.  While the
court understands the parties are looking for a date in mid-2025, the court is
not sure it can accommodate a trial in 2025 at all or even the first part of
2026.  However, that will be discussed at
the hearing.
