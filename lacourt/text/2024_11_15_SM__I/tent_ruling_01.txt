  Case Number:  20SMCV00872    Hearing Date:   November 15, 2024    Dept:  I The court has read and considered the ex parte
application.  The court will discuss the
matter with counsel, but the papers make a pretty compelling case that
defendants have acted in bad faith to obstruct the sale, which would (if the
court so finds) result in the application being GRANTED, but the court will ask
plaintiff to prepare the order.
