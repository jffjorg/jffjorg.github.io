On August 6, 2024, Plaintiff
filed the operative Amended Motion to Compel Responses to the Special
Interrogatories as to Calvin Alexander Kim (the “Motion”).
 
No Opposition or Reply papers
have been received by the Court.
 
ANALYSIS
 
“If a
party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely response,
the propounding party may move for an order compelling responses and for a
monetary sanction. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (b).) The statute
contains no time limit for a motion to compel where no responses have been
served. All that needs to be shown in the moving papers is that a set of
interrogatories was properly served on the opposing party, that the time to
respond has expired, and that no response of any kind has been served. (Leach
v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902, 905-906.)
 
Additionally,
“[i]f a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely
response ... [t]he party to whom the interrogatories are directed waives any
right to exercise the option to produce writings under Section 2030.230, as
well as any objection to the interrogatories, including one based on privilege
or on the protection for work product...” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd.
(a).)
 
A.   
Motion to Compel
Responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One
 
Defendant’s counsel, Sunny
Lee (“Lee”), attests that on April 24, 2024, Siteone served its written
discovery requests, including the Special Interrogatories, Set One, on
Defendant Calvin Alexander Kim (“Kim”). (Lee Amended Decl. ¶ 6, Ex. “A.”) The deadline
for Kim’s responses to the discovery requests was due on May 29, 2024. (Ibid.)
On June 6, 2024, Siteone’s counsel contacted Kim’s counsel inquiring about the
discovery responses and extended the deadline to respond to June 30, 2024. (Id.
¶ 7.)  However, as of August 2, 2024,
Siteone has not received any responses from Defendant Kim. (Id. ¶ 10.)
 
Based on the above records, the
Court determines that Defendant Kim failed to serve a timely response, thereby
waiving any objection to the interrogatories, including those based on
privilege or the protection for work product, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 2030.290, subdivision (a).
 
Nevertheless, under Code of Civil
Procedure section 2030.290, subdivision (a), “[t]he court, on motion, may
relieve that party from this waiver on its determination that both of the
following conditions are satisfied: ¶ (1) The party has subsequently served a
response that is in substantial compliance with Sections 2030.210, 2030.220,
2030.230, and 2030.240. ¶ (2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.”
 
Here, Defendant Kim did not file an
Opposition to the Motion. Nor did he move separately for relief from the
waiver. Additionally, there is no record indicating any responses have been
subsequently served by Kim prior to the hearing. Consequently, the Court finds
that
relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.290,
subdivision (a) is unavailable in this circumstance.
 
Based on the foregoing, the Court GRANTS
the unopposed Motion.
 
B.    
Monetary
Sanctions
 
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 2030.290, subdivision (c), “[t]he Court shall impose a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party,
person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a
response to interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the
sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make
the imposition of the sanction unjust....”
 
Additionally,
California Rules of Court rule 3.1348(a) further provides, “The Court may award
sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to
compel discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was filed, or
opposition to the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided
to the moving party after the motion was filed.” (Underlines added.)
 
The Court finds that the mandatory
sanctions apply in this case. Considering the substantial similarities between
this Motion and several other discovery motions filed concurrently by Plaintiff,
and utilizing the lodestar approach, the Court determines the total and
reasonable amount of attorney’s fees and costs incurred for the work performed
in connection with the Motion to be $460.00, calculated based on a reasonable
hourly rate of $400.00 for one hour reasonably spent, plus a $60.00 filing fee.
 
Therefore, the Court GRANTS IN PART Plaintiff’s request for
monetary sanctions.

Landscape Supply LLC’s Motion to Compel Responses to Special Interrogatories,
Set One, as to Defendant Calvin Alexander Kim is GRANTED.
