And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling grants the proposed intervenor's motion for leave to intervene in the case. The proposed intervenor is the insurance carrier for the defendants, and it has a direct interest in the litigation because it could be exposed to liability under Insurance Code section 11580. The proposed intervenor has been unable to communicate with the defendants, and the defendants have filed an answer to the complaint. The court finds that the proposed intervenor's interests are not adequately represented by the defendants, and therefore grants the motion for leave to intervene. The proposed intervenor is ordered to file its answer-in-intervention within 10 days.
