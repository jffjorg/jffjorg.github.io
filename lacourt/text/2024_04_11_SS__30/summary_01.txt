And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied Plaintiffs' motion to compel document production and their request for sanctions in this case. The motion to compel was filed after Defendant failed to produce documents in response to Plaintiffs' request. However, the parties failed to participate in an informal discovery conference (IDC) as required by the court. As a result, the judge has denied the motion to compel and the request for sanctions, citing the failure to participate in the IDC. The judge has also imposed no sanctions at this time, pending further briefing from the parties.
