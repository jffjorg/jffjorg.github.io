BACKGROUND
 
This is a wage and hour class action.
Defendant is a Georgia corporation that operates valet parking, event parking,
facility management, parking consulting and property analysis, parking
management services and technology, and staffing services, throughout
California, at approximately 21-25 different locations.
 
On May 29, 2020, Plaintiff Castillo
filed a proposed class action against Defendant, alleging the following claims:
(1) failure to pay all wages; (2) non-payment of overtime compensation; (3)
failure to provide proper meal periods; (4) failure to provide proper rest
periods; (5) failure to reimburse business expenses; (6) failure to pay wages
of terminated or resigned employees; (7) failure to properly maintain accurate
itemized wage statements; and (9) violation of California Business &
Professions Code § 17200 et seq.  
 
On April 1, 2021, Plaintiff Castillo
filed a first amended complaint (“FAC”), adding Plaintiff Pacheco as a named
plaintiff and a cause of action pursuant to Labor Code § 2699 et seq. (the
“PAGA”). 
 
On March 23, 2023, the Court granted
Plaintiffs’ Class Cert Motion. The Court certified the following class and ten
(10) subclasses: “All current and former Parking Attendants and Shift Leaders
employed by Selig Parking, Inc. dba AAA Parking at any time during the period
from May 29, 2016, through the date of the order granting class
certification.”  
 
On August 29, 2023, the Parties
attended an in-person private mediation with the Hon. Daniel Buckley (Ret.) but
were unable to reach a settlement. The Parties continued to have settlement
discussions with the assistance of the mediator, which included a mediator’s
proposal, ultimately accepted by the parties. On November 28, 2023, counsel
filed a fully executed long form Settlement Agreement with the court, attached
as Exhibit 1 to the Declaration of Sam Kim (“Kim Decl.”) ISO
Preliminary Approval. 

 
On April 4, 2024, the court issued a
checklist of items for the parties to address and continued preliminary
approval. In response, on May 29, 2024 counsel filed a fully executed Amended
Settlement Agreement attached as Exhibit B to the Supplemental Declaration of
Sam Kim (“Kim Supp. Decl.”) ISO Preliminary Approval.
 
Preliminary Approval was granted on
June 26, 2024. Notice was given
to the Class Members as ordered. (See Declaration of Kevin Lee (“Lee Decl.”).
 
Now before the Court is the motion for
final approval of the settlement agreement.

ANALYSIS
OF SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT
A.    
Does
a presumption of fairness exist?  
The Court preliminarily found in
its Orders on June 26, 2024, that the presumption of fairness should be
applied.  No facts have come to the
Court’s attention that would alter that preliminary conclusion.  Accordingly, the settlement is entitled to a
presumption of fairness as set forth in the preliminary approval order.
B.      Is the settlement
fair, adequate, and reasonable?
The settlement was preliminarily found to be
fair, adequate and reasonable.  Notice
has now been given to the Class and the LWDA. 

 
  Reaction of the class
members to the proposed settlement. 
Number of class
members: 1,155 (Lee Decl., ¶3.)
Number of notice
packets mailed: 1,155 (Id. at ¶5.)
Number of
undeliverable notices: 2 (Id. at ¶7.)

Number of
opt-outs: 1 (Id. at ¶8.)                  
Number of
objections: 0 (Id. at ¶9.)
Number of
participating Class Members: 1,154 (Id.
at ¶11.)
Average
individual payment: $390.87 (Id. at
¶13.)
Highest
estimated payment: $1,336.28 (Ibid.)
Lowest
estimated payment: $9.90 (Ibid.)
Number
of Aggrieved Employees: 1,147 (Id. at ¶14.)
Average PAGA
payment: $4.36 (Ibid.)
Highest
estimated PAGA payment: $13.90 (Ibid.)
The Court finds that the notice was
given as directed and conforms to due process requirements.  Given the reactions of the Class Members and
the LWDA to the proposed settlement and for the reasons set for in the Preliminary
Approval order, the settlement is found to be fair, adequate, and reasonable.
 
C.     
Attorney
Fees and Costs
Class Counsel request $283,333.33 (33%) in fees and litigation costs and expenses
in the amount of $55,099.60. (Motion ISO Fees, 14:9-11.) 
The Settlement provides for attorney's
fees up to $283,333.33 and costs of $57,000 (Settlement Agreement, ¶3.2.2); the
class was provided notice of the requested awards, and none objected. (Lee Decl., ¶9 and Exhibit A thereto.)
Plaintiffs
have given written approval of the following fee split: 1) 20% of any attorney
fees awarded to Verum to Mahoney Law Group, APC; and 2) 20% of any attorney
fees awarded to Verum to the Law Offices of Mario M. De La Rosa. (Declaration
of Mario Castillo (“Castillo Decl.”), ¶10; Declaration of Juan Pacheco (“Pacheco
Decl.”), ¶10.) 
“Courts recognize two methods for
calculating attorney fees in civil class actions: the lodestar/multiplier
method and the percentage of recovery method.” 
(Wershba at 254.) 
Here, class counsel requests attorney fees using the percentage method
as cross-checked by loadstar. (Motion ISO Fees, pgs. 5-13.) 
 The fee request represents
33% of the gross settlement amount which is the average generally awarded in
class actions.  See In re Consumer Privacy Cases (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 545, 558, fn.
13 (“Empirical studies show that, regardless of whether the percentage method
or the lodestar method is used, fee awards in class actions average around
one-third of the recovery.”).   
Counsel has provided the following
lodestar information:

Hourly Rate

Total Billed




Verum Law
  Group 


$850


465.30


$395,505.00




Total


 


465.30


$395,505.00



(Kim Decl.
ISO Fees, ¶55 and Exhibit F thereto.)
            
            In sum, Counsel represent they have
spent 465.3 hours in connection with this litigation, resulting in a lodestar
of $395,505, which would require
a negative multiplier to yield the requested fee amount.  (Ibid.)
            As
for costs, Class Counsel is requesting $55,099.60
in costs which is less than settlement cap of
$57,000. (Ibid.) To date, Class Counsel have incurred a total of $55,099.60 in costs in this action.
(Kim Decl. ISO Fees, ¶56 and Exhibit G thereto.) The costs
include, but are not limited to, filing fees ($1,556.20); mediation ($9,950); expert costs (Berger Consulting
Group) ($7,550), Trustpoint ($4,781.70), and “Employment Research” ($23,375). (Ibid.) 
        Based on the above, the Court will award
$283,333.33 (1/3) in attorney’s fees
and $55,099.60 in costs.
 
D.    
Incentive
Awards to Class Representatives
The
Settlement Agreement provides for up to $24,000
for incentive awards to the class representatives ($12,000 each).
(Settlement Agreement, ¶3.2.1.) 
Plaintiff Castillo’s contributions to
this litigation include, and are not limited to spending at least 37 hours on
the following: obtaining counsel, gathering documents, reviewing documents,
having numerous conversations with counsel, speaking to witnesses, preparing
for and remaining available for mediation, and reviewing the settlement.
(Castillo Decl., ¶7.)
Plaintiff Pacheco’s contributions to
this litigation include, and are not limited to spending at least 45 hours on
the following: obtaining counsel, gathering documents, reviewing documents,
having numerous conversations with counsel, speaking to witnesses, preparing
for and attending mediation, and reviewing the settlement. (Pacheco Decl., ¶7.)
The court notes that although these
efforts are commendable, they are not exceptional. Based on the above, the Court hereby awards enhancement
awards in the amounts of $7,500 per Plaintiff for a total of $15,000.
 
E.     
Claims
Administration Costs
 
The claims administrator requests $16,500 for the costs of administering
the settlement. (Lee Decl.,
¶16.) This is less than the $18,000 maximum amount estimated at
preliminary approval and disclosed in the notice to class members, to which
there were no objections. (Id.
at ¶9 and
Exhibit A thereto.) Based on all the work performed by the Claims
Administrator, the Court hereby awards costs in the requested amount.
