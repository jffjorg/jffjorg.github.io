English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the motion for summary judgment is denied. The case involves age and disability discrimination, failure to engage in the interactive process, failure to provide reasonable accommodation, harassment, retaliation, and wrongful termination. The Judge finds that there are triable issues of material fact concerning whether the Plaintiff sought a reasonable accommodation and whether the Defendants failed to engage in the interactive process. The Judge also finds that the Plaintiff's complaint is sufficient to state a claim under a disparate treatment theory, but not under a disparate impact theory. The motion for summary adjudication is also denied due to procedural errors. The case is set to be heard on July 11, 2024.
