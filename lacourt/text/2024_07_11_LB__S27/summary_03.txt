And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has ruled that the demurrer filed by JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. is sustained without leave to amend. The Court finds that the First Amended Complaint (FAC) fails to state a cause of action for numerous reasons set forth in the demurrer. Specifically, the Court finds that the FAC does not plead the existence of a void deed of trust, the plaintiff lacks standing to challenge the deed of trust and assignment of deed of trust, and the case is barred by res judicata. The Court also finds that the plaintiff's spouse is an indispensable party to this litigation and has previously filed two prior actions against the defendants or their predecessors. The Court denies the plaintiff's request for leave to amend the complaint and orders the defendants to prepare a judgment of dismissal for processing.
