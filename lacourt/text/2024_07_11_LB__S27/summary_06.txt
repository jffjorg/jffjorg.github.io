Statutes:
  California Civil Code section 425.16
  California Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16(c)(1)
Roles:
  - Judge
  - Plaintiff (Miraleste Canyon Estates)
  - Defendant (Robert Beliveau)
Significant Statements:
  - "Section 425.16 posits instead a two-step process for determining whether an action is a SLAPP."
  - "A defendant meets this burden by demonstrating that the act underlying the plaintiff's cause fits one of the categories spelled out in section 425.16, subdivision (e)."
  - "The Court need not determine, in connection with this motion, whether Defendant established the first prong of the test. This is so because, as will be discussed below, the Court finds Plaintiff met its burden of showing a probability of success on the merits, and therefore the threshold issue of whether the statute applies need not be determined."
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the parties' arguments regarding the special motion to strike and has issued a tentative ruling. The defendant, Robert Beliveau, has filed a motion to strike the complaint, alleging that it arises from his protected free speech and petitioning activity. The plaintiff, Miraleste Canyon Estates, has filed opposition papers, arguing that the free speech and petitioning activity is merely incidental to the complaint, which is primarily based on the defendant's verbal and physical intimidation and harassment of the plaintiff.

The Court finds that, even if the defendant has made a threshold showing that the challenged cause of action is one arising from protected activity, the plaintiff has met its burden of showing a probability of success on the merits. The plaintiff has provided evidence of the defendant's conduct, including verbal and physical intimidation and harassment, as well as evidence of the defendant's breach of a 2017 stay away agreement and the CC&Rs of the Miraleste Canyon Estates.

The Court denies the motion to strike and orders the plaintiff to give notice. The Court also denies the plaintiff's request for attorneys' fees and costs, finding that the motion was not frivolous or solely intended to cause delay.
