And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case 23LBCV02216. The Plaintiff filed a motion to deem RFAs admitted on May 21, 2024, and set it for hearing on July 11, 2024. The Defendant filed a timely opposition on June 27, 2024, contending that the hearing should be continued due to the handling attorney's leave of absence and that the Plaintiff did not properly serve the RFAs. The Court notes that the Plaintiff did not file a timely reply to the opposition and will not consider late-filed reply papers. In light of the circumstances, the Court continues the hearing to September 3, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. to be heard concurrently with the Plaintiff's pending motion to compel responses to RPDs. The Court encourages the parties to attempt to resolve the issues presented by the motions without the need for the hearing date. The Court also notes that Defense Counsel must act swiftly to communicate with the Defendant and respond to the subject discovery to avoid imposition of adverse discovery orders and/or sanctions.
