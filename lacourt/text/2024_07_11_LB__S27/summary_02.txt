And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendant's motion to set aside and vacate the judgment in favor of the plaintiff. The defendant filed the motion on February 16, 2024, claiming that she was fraudulently induced into entering into a judgment against her due to alleged perjury and fraud. However, the judge has determined that the motion is untimely and that the time limit for ruling on the motion has expired. The judge has also noted that the defendant's claims are moot since the sheriff's department has already completed the lock-out process in May. Therefore, the judge has denied the motion to vacate judgment. The parties are advised to submit on the tentative or make arrangements to appear remotely at the hearing on July 11, 2024.
