And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the demurrer filed by the City of Long Beach, State of California, and Department of Public Health, as well as the opposition filed by the plaintiffs, David Cain and Red Ball Fun Zone, Inc. The City demurs to the complaint, alleging that the plaintiffs failed to file a timely government tort claim. The plaintiffs, in opposition, argue that the demurrer was filed well past the statutory deadline and should be summarily overruled.

The court finds that the demurrer must be ruled upon on its merits and continues the hearing to permit the plaintiff to substantively oppose the demurrer. The court also grants the request for judicial notice and rejects the plaintiff's challenge to the request.

The hearing is continued for one month, to Tuesday, August 13, 2024, to permit the plaintiff to substantively oppose the demurrer. The plaintiff is advised that the court will consider the judicially noticed document and rule on the merits of the claim filing challenge at the continued hearing.
