Entitlement
to Attorney Fees and Costs
 
“The judgment creditor may claim under this section the
following costs of enforcing a judgment: . . . (6) Attorney's fees, if allowed by Section
685.040.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 685.070, subd. (a).) Code of Civil Procedure, section 685.040
states: “The
judgment creditor is entitled to the reasonable and necessary costs of
enforcing a judgment. Attorney’s fees incurred in enforcing a judgment are not
included in costs collectible under this title unless otherwise provided by
law. Attorney’s fees incurred in enforcing a judgment are included as
costs collectible under this title if the underlying judgment includes an award
of attorney’s fees to the judgment creditor pursuant
to subparagraph (A) of paragraph (10) of subdivision (a) of Section
1033.5.” Also, the motion must be brought with two years of the incurred costs.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 685.080, subd. (a).) 
 
Based on the award of attorney’s fees in the judgment from the
sister-state case, Plaintiff is also
entitled to attorney’s fees incurred enforcing
its judgment here pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure section 685.040. (Motion, RJN, Exh. 2, p. 2.) The Motion is
timely filed with respect to fees incurred between June 8, 2022 and April
2, 2024.
(Motion, Bailio Decl., ¶¶6-11 and Exh. A.) 
 
Calculation
of Attorney Fees and Costs
 
The Court’s objective is to award
attorney fees at the fair market value
based on the particular action.  (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24
Cal.4th 1122, 1132.)  “The reasonable
hourly rate is that prevailing in the community for similar work.”  (PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000)
22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095.) “‘[T]he fee setting inquiry in California ordinarily
begins with the 'lodestar,' i.e., the number of hours reasonably expended
multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate . . . .’” (Ketchum v. Moses (2001)
24 Cal.4th 1122, 1134.)  The lodestar method is based on the factors, as
relevant to the particular case: “(1) the novelty and difficulty of the
questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the extent
to which the nature of the litigation precluded other employment by the
attorneys, (4) the contingent nature of the fee award.”  (Id. at 1132.) “The ‘‘experienced
trial judge is the best judge of the value of professional services rendered in
his court, and while his judgment is of course
subject to review, it will not be disturbed unless the appellate court is convinced that it is clearly wrong.’’” (Id.) A negative modifier was appropriate
when duplicative work had been performed.
(Thayer v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2001) 92 Cal.App.4th 819.) 
 
Plaintiff
submits the declaration of its attorney, Austin Bailio (“Bailio”), in support
of its request for attorney fees. Bailio declares that he billed $325.00 until
December 31, 2022, then billed $375.00 per hour. (Motion, Bailio Decl., ¶6 and
Exh. A.) During that time, Bailio spent 4.2 hours for which they billed $2,535.00,
as well as two flat rate fees of $450.00 for the writ of execution and
withholding order. (Id. at ¶¶6-11 and Exh.) Judgment Creditor also
incurred paralegal fees of $87.50 based on $175.00 per hour. (Id. at ¶10.)
The total amount of attorney’s fees Plaintiff incurred, therefore, is $2,622.50. (Id.
at ¶12 and Exh. A.)
 
Plaintiff
also presents evidence it incurred costs from investigation, filing fees,
appearance fees, and other costs in the amount of $772.69. (Id.
at Exh. A, p. 2.) 
 
Conclusion
 
Therefore, Plaintiff
Maricopa Meadows Homeowners Association’s Motion
for Award of Attorney Fees and Costs is GRANTED
IN THE AMOUNT OF $2,622.50 IN ATTORNEY FEES AND $772.69 IN COSTS.
