v. Ford, et al.HEARING
ON PETITION

HEARING ON THE
PETITION IS PLACED OFF CALENDAR. THE MATTER IS SET FOR TRIAL ON JUNE 26, 2025

ANALYSIS:  
 
On December 28, 2023,
Plaintiff Jacob Emrani (“Plaintiff”)
filed the instant action against Defendant Carmen Form (“Defendant”). The
Complaint alleges causes of action for (1) breach of contract; and (2) request
for trial after attorney-fee client arbitration. (Compl., ¶6.) When the case was filed it was designated
“Petition to Compel/Confirm/Vacate Arbitration Award” and set for hearing on the
purported petition on May 16, 2024. The action is not a petition, however. Accordingly,
the Court changes the designation of this case from “Petition to Compel/Confirm/Vacate Arbitration Award” to “Other Complaint”
and takes the hearing on the purported petition off calendar. The matter is set
for trial on June 26, 2025 at 8:30 am in Department 26 in the Spring Street
Courthouse.
