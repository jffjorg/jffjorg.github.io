ANALYSIS:
 
On August 3, 2021, Plaintiff
Katherina Pellegrin (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant action for breach of lease
agreement and related claims against Defendants Georgina Capital, Inc. and Todd
M. Smith (“Defendants”). Following Defendants’ failure to file a responsive
pleading, default judgment was entered in Plaintiff’s favor on May 20, 2022.
(Default Judgment 05/20/22.) The Court awarded Plaintiff attorney’s fees with
the judgment in the amount of $1,006.74. (Default Judgment, 05/20/22, p.
2:14-15.) 
 
Plaintiff filed a motion to amend
judgment on August 28, 2023, which the Court denied without prejudice following
an order to show cause regarding the status of Plaintiff’s counsel. (Minute
Order, 11/20/23.) Plaintiff filed the instant renewed Motion to Amend Judgment
on January 18, 2024. The hearing originally set for March 20, 2024 was
continued to March 26, 2024. (Minute Order, 03/20/24.) Plaintiff filed a
supplemental declaration on March 25, 2024. On March 26, 2024, Plaintiff
appeared and argued and the Court continued the hearing to May 16, 2024.
(Minute Order, 03/26/24.)  To date, no
opposition has been filed. 
 
Discussion
 
Plaintiff’s Motion to Amend
Judgment seeks to add an award of post-judgment attorney’s fees to the
judgment, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 685.070 and 685.080. “The judgment creditor may claim
under this section the following costs of enforcing a judgment: . . . (6)
Attorney's fees, if allowed by Section 685.040.” (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 685.070, subd. (a).) Code of Civil Procedure, section 685.040 states: “The judgment
creditor is entitled to the reasonable and necessary costs of enforcing a judgment.
Attorney’s fees incurred in enforcing a judgment are not included in costs
collectible under this title unless otherwise provided by law. Attorney’s
fees incurred in enforcing a judgment are included as costs collectible under
this title if the underlying judgment includes an award of attorney’s fees to
the judgment creditor pursuant to
subparagraph (A) of paragraph (10) of subdivision (a) of Section 1033.5.” Also,
the motion must be brought within two years of the incurred costs. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 685.080, subd. (a).) 
 
The Court, previously having awarded
Plaintiff attorney’s fees on the judgment, finds that post-judgment attorney’s
fees may be awarded. Plaintiff seeks an award of $8,429.35. (Motion, Gomez Decl., Exh. 3, p. 5.) The
moving party bears the burden of proof with respect to attorney’s fees. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (c)(5)(A).) Specifically, a party seeking
fees has the burden of showing the fees incurred are “allowable,” are “reasonably
necessary to the conduct of the litigation,” and are “reasonable in amount.”  (Levy v. Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc.
(1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 807, 816.) The Court’s objective is to award attorney’s fees at the fair market value based
on the particular action. (Ketchum
v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1132.) “The reasonable
hourly rate is that prevailing in the community for similar work.” (PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000)
22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095.) “‘[T]he fee setting inquiry in California
ordinarily begins with the ‘lodestar,’ i.e., the number of hours reasonably
expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate . . . .’” (Ketchum v.
Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1134.) 
 
Following
a continuance of the hearing date, the Motion is now supported by the
declaration of Plaintiff’s counsel, Charles G. Gomez, Esq., who sets forth the information
necessary to demonstrate that the attorneys bill at the following hourly rate:
$525 for senior attorneys, $325 for associate attorneys, $250 for paralegals
and law clerks. (Motion, Gomez Decl., ¶¶5-7.) The majority of the work was
performed by associate attorneys and paralegals, making the billing rate for a
limited breach of contract action reasonable. Also, a majority of the work
performed was reasonably expended on post-judgment enforcement. (Motion, Supp.
Gomez Decl., ¶¶13-53.) However, some of the entries improperly seek to recover
for administrative and clerical tasks such as investigating Defendant’s
location, downloading documents, compiling filings, mailing documents, filing
papers with the Court, and reserving hearing dates. (See id., ¶¶22, 31,
33, 34, 45, 50.) Accordingly, the attorney’s fees are reduced in the amount of $1,035.00
for an award of $7,394.35.

Katherina Pellegrin’s Motion to Amend Judgment is GRANTED. THE JUDGMENT IS
