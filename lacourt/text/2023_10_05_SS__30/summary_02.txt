The defendant is ordered to provide supplemental responses within 20 days. The court has limited the scope of certain requests, including requests for documents generated from employees at the warehouse where the incident occurred within the last five years. The court has denied certain requests as duplicative or unnecessary, and has sustained objections to others. The court has also denied requests for sanctions.
