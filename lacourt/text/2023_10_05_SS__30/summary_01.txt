And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion to strike paragraphs 16, 17, and 19 of the plaintiff's complaint, which allege that the defendants acted with malice, oppression, or fraud. However, the judge has granted the motion to strike paragraph 18, which does not sufficiently allege facts to support awarding punitive damages. The judge has given the moving party 20 days to amend their complaint. The ruling is based on the judge's interpretation of California law regarding the definition of malice, oppression, and fraud, as well as the requirements for pleading a claim for punitive damages. The judge has found that paragraphs 16, 17, and 19 of the complaint sufficiently allege facts to support a claim for punitive damages, but paragraph 18 does not.
