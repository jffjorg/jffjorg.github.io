  Case Number:  23AVCV00898-01    Hearing Date:   January 16, 2024    Dept:  A14 Background
 
This is an other business tort
action. Plaintiff Arthur Antoine H. Teerlynck (“Plaintiff”) alleges that
Defendant Don H. B. Callaway, also known as Don Howard Blanchard Callaway, also
known as Donald H. Callaway, also known as Don Callaway, also known as Donny
Callaway, also known as Donnie Callaway (“Don”)[1]
and Cara Callaway (“Cara” and collectively “Defendants”) were operating a
business entity at 40123 98th St. W, Leona Valley, California as an unlicensed
automotive repair dealer and unlicensed vehicle dealer. Plaintiff presents that
he is the owner of 11 automobile sand co-owner of one automobile and has had
issues with Defendants over each vehicle as follows:
 
·        
1973 365 GTB/4 Daytona Ferrari – Plaintiff
purchased the Daytona Ferrari and Don conducted a pre-purchase inspection,
quoting $45,000.00 to repair the vehicle. No written statement was given. It
was agreed that the vehicle would be shipped to Belgium when the repairs were
completed or upon demand. Don has failed to and refused to ship the vehicle to
Belgium.
·        
1961 Maserati 3500 Spyder Vignale – Don arranged
for the transfer of the vehicle while it waws being repaired at Beverly Hills
Car Club without Plaintiff’s consent. Don then informed Plaintiff that the
transport company damaged the vehicle and that he would have to take the
vehicle to repair it. Plaintiff was never presented with an estimate or
evidence of damage. Don explained he needed title to the vehicle to ship the
vehicle and that he would ship both the vehicle and title together. It was
agreed upon that the vehicle would be shipped to Belgium upon completion of
repairs or on demand. Don has failed to and refused to ship the vehicle to
Belgium.
·        
1981 Ferrari 512BB – Plaintiff purchased the
vehicle and Don brokered the purchase of the vehicle. Plaintiff paid Don a
broker fee. The vehicle was in Don’s possession for repair during the purchase.
Don failed and refused to turn over vehicle title and ship the vehicle to
Plaintiff. 
·        
1955 Alfa Romeo 1900 Boano – Plaintiff purchased
the vehicle by a seller that was found by Don, who brokered the purchase of the
vehicle. Plaintiff paid Don a brokerage fee. Don informed Plaintiff that the
vehicle did not have a vehicle title and did not provide title to Plaintiff.

·        
1969 Jaguar E-Type series II – Plaintiff
purchased the vehicle from an acquaintance of Don. Don brokered the sale and
Plaintiff paid him a broker’s fee. Don represented that the vehicle was a
perfect car, but then reported that there were hidden flaws requiring service.
Plaintiff was not provided with a written estimate; however, it is presented
that the repairs amounted to $60,000.00. Don shipped the vehicle to Plaintiff.
Subsequently, the vehicle broke down and a professional mechanic in Belgium
provided a diagnostic report which showed that the repairs that Don had
allegedly performed were, in fact, not done. The vehicle also came under a
visitor’s visa. Don instructed Plaintiff to temporarily list Don as the owner
to ease the process of importing. Don visited Belgium and went to the repair
shop. After this visit, the vehicle’s title went missing. 
·

title to Plaintiff. Don visited Plaintiff in Belgium and went to the repair
shop. After the visit, the vehicle’s title went missing.

the vehicle from Beverly Hills Car Club. After purchase, the vehicle was
transported to Don for repair services. Plaintiff paid $25,000.00 to Don for
repairs that were never requested or quoted. Once the repairs were finished,
Don shipped the vehicle to Plaintiff. Upon inspection of the vehicle, Plaintiff
discovered that Don had misrepresented the additional repair work he claimed
was performed. 
·

vehicle from Beverly Hills Car Club. After purchase, the vehicle was
transported to Don for repair services. Plaintiff paid $97,040.00 to Don for

Upon inspection of the vehicle, Plaintiff discovered that Don had
misrepresented the additional repair work he claimed was performed.
·        
1966 Alfa Romeo Duetto – Half of the ownership
in the vehicle was purchased by Plaintiff from Don. It was agreed by both
parties that Don would perform repair and restoration services, sell the vehicle,
and the profits would be split 50/50. Significant time passed and the repairs
and restoration services were not done. Plaintiff demanded Don pay Plaintiff
his amount of ownership interest, Don refused.
·        
984 Ferrari Testarossa 2DR Coupe – Plaintiff
purchased the vehicle from a seller in the United Kingdom. The vehicle and
title was shipped to Plaintiff. Don visited Plaintiff in Belgium and went to
the repair shop. After the visit, the vehicle’s title went missing and metal

statements that the vehicle would ‘never be seen on the road again” and “it’s
last drive.”
·        
1995 Rolls-Royce Flying Spur – Plaintiff
purchased the vehicle from a seller found by Don. Don brokered the sale and

Legal Standard
 
Standard for Motion to Strike – The court may, upon a motion,
or at any time in its discretion, and upon terms it deems proper, strike any
irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 436(a).) The court may also strike all or any part of any pleading not
drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an
order of the court. (Id., § 436(b).) The grounds for a motion to strike
are that the pleading has irrelevant, false or improper matter, or has not been
drawn or filed in conformity with laws. (Id. § 436.) The grounds for
moving to strike must appear on the face of the pleading or by way of judicial
notice. (Id. § 437.)¿¿¿¿ 
 
----- 
 
Meet and Confer Requirement¿– Before filing a demurrer or a
motion to strike, the demurring or moving party is required to meet and confer
with the party who filed the pleading demurred to or the pleading that is
subject to the motion to strike for the purposes of determining whether an
agreement can be reached through a filing of an amended pleading that would
resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer.¿ (Cal. Code Civ.¿Proc.
§430.41 and §435.5.)¿ The Court notes that this requirement has been met. (See
Decl. Martin L. Horwitz ¶¶ 3-4.)

Discussion
 
Application – Defendants
seek to strike Plaintiff’s verification, references to punitive damages, and
Exhibit A. 
 
The Court addresses each argument
separately. 
 
Defendants argue that the
verification attached is based on hearsay as it states: “The information
supplied therein is based on my own personal knowledge and/or has been supplied
by my attorneys or other agents and/or complied from available documents and is
therefore provided as required by law.” (See Complaint at p. 53 [erroneously
labeled page 52].) Defendants cite to Evid. Code § 1200 and People v.
Sanchez (2016) 63 Cal.4th 665 (“Sanchez”).
 
Plaintiff argues that nothing in
the verification is based on hearsay. Rather, Plaintiff has gathered
information, including documents, from the vehicle dealers that make up the
allegations in the Complaint.
 
Defendants, in reply, clarify
that the issue in not whether the Complaint contains inadmissible hearsay, but
whether the verification is proper. Defendant then provides an argument that
the verification does not comply with Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 446. 
 
The Court notes that Cal. Code
Civ. Proc. § 446 allows an attorney to verify the Complaint if the party is
“absent from the county where the attorney has his or her office.” Plaintiff
has alleged that he is a resident Kuurne, Belgium. Despite this, Plaintiff has signed
the verification. 
 
The Court is not aware nor have
Defendants provided a citation to show that Cal. Evid. Code § 1200 and Sanchez
applies to verifications and/or Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 446. Rather, Star
Motor Imports, Inc. v. Superior Court (1979) 88 Cal.App.3d 201 (“Star
Motor Imports”) distinguishes verifications to the Complaint:
 
A
"verification" is an affidavit verifying the truth of the matters
covered by it. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2009; In re O'Brien Machinery, Inc., 224
Cal.App.2d 563, 569 [36 Cal.Rptr. 782]; Hoffman v. City of Palm Springs, 169
Cal.App.2d 645, 648 [337 P.2d 521]; Osborn v. City of Whittier, 103 Cal.App.2d
609, 619 [230 P.2d 132].) "Its object is to assure good faith in the
averments or statements of a party" to litigation. ( Sheeley v. City of
Santa Clara, 215 Cal.App.2d 83, 85 [30 Cal.Rptr. 121]; Albertson v. Raboff,
185 Cal.App.2d 372, 388 [295 P.2d 405].)
 
An affidavit based
on "information and belief" is hearsay and must be disregarded ( Franklin
v. Nat C. Goldstone Agency, 33 Cal.2d 628, 631 [204 P.2d 37]; Moore v.
Thompson, 138 Cal. 23, 26 [70 P. 930]; Judd v. Superior Court, 60
Cal.App.3d 38, 43 [131 Cal.Rptr. 246]; Tracy v. Tracy, 213 Cal.App.2d
359, 362 [28 Cal.Rptr. 815]), and it is "unavailing for any purpose"
whatsoever ( Gay v. Torrance, 145 Cal. 144, 151 [76 P. 717]; Ex Parte
Yonetaro Fkumoto, 120 Cal. 316, 321 [52 P. 726]; Enter v. Crutcher,
159 Cal.App.2d Supp. 841, 845 [323 P.2d 586]; Bank of America v. Williams,
89 Cal.App.2d 21, 29 [200 P.2d 151]).
 
We have not
overlooked the provision of Code of Civil Procedure section 446 that in
"all cases of a verification of a pleading, the affidavit of the party
shall state that the same is true of his own knowledge, except as to the
matters which are therein stated on his information or belief, and as to those
matters that he believes it to be true; . . ."
 
This provision,
insofar as it purports to permit verification on "information  or belief," palpably refers to pleadings
that join issues, such as the common complaint and answer of a lawsuit. (See Pridonoff
v. Balokovich, 36 Cal.2d 788, 792 [288 P.2d 6]; Toboni v. Pennington
Millinery Co., 172 Cal.App.2d 47, 52 [341 P.2d 845]; Buxton v.
International  Indemnity Co., 47
Cal.App. 583, 590-591 [191 P. 84].) Where the verification, or affidavit, is
to be "used as evidence" of facts, " Section 446 [Code Civ. Proc.]
does not apply." ( Toboni v. Pennington Millnery Co., supra,
p. 52.) Matters alleged on "information and belief" do "not
serve to establish the facts . . . because an affidavit which is to be used as
evidence must be positive, direct and not based upon hearsay." ( Gutierrez
v. Superior Court, 243 Cal.App.2d 710, 725 [52 Cal.Rptr. 592].) A ruling
"of the court is to be based upon facts which may be presented to it, and
not upon the belief of the affiant." ( Pelegrinelli v. McCloud River
etc. Co., 1 Cal.App. 593, 597 [82 P. 695].) Such allegations on
"information and belief" furnish "'no proof of the facts stated
. . . .'" ( Franklin v. Nat C. 
Goldstone Agency, supra, 33 Cal.2d 628, 631; Kellett v. Kellett,
2 Cal.2d 45, 48 [39 P.2d 203].)
 
(Star Motor Imports, supra,
88 Cal.App.3d at 203-04 [emphasis added].)
 
The verification to the Complaint
is not being used as evidence of facts. 
 
Defendants’ next case, Zavala
v. Board of Trustees (1993) 16 Cal.App.4th 1755 (“Zavala”) holds
that an objection where a party fails to verify a pleading is a motion to
strike, which may be made only upon timely notice and provides for hearing and
extension of time to answer. (See Zavala, supra, 16 Cal.App.4th
at 1760-61.) This is not a case where verification was lacking and Zavala
fails to show how Plaintiff’s verification is improper.
 
As to Exhibit A, Defendants
simply direct the Court to Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 2.503(e)(2) and requests
sealing the Complaint and allowing Plaintiff to file an unverified First
Amended Complaint which with “intentionally omitted” under Exhibit A. The Court
notes that this is not a request to strike Exhibit A. 
 
Cal. Rules of Court, Rule
2.503(e)(2) reads:
 
The court should, to
the extent feasible, redact the following information from records to which it
allows remote access under (e): driver license numbers; dates of birth; social
security numbers; Criminal Identification and Information and National Crime
Information numbers; addresses and phone numbers of parties, victims,
witnesses, and court personnel; medical or psychiatric information; financial
information; account numbers; and other personal identifying information. The
court may order any party who files a document containing such information to
provide the court with both an original unredacted version of the document for
filing in the court file and a redacted version of the document for remote
access. No juror names or other juror identifying information may be provided
by remote access. This subdivision does not apply to any document in the
original court file; it applies only to documents that are available by remote
access.
 
Thus, the argument by Defendant
only supports redaction of Exhibit A. 
 
Plaintiff argues that there is
public access to the case, but only has to a list of the register of actions,
upcoming hearings, and a list of documents filed by the parties and to view the
actual document a payment is needed. Plaintiff further argues that Don waived
his privacy rights by voluntarily transmitting such documents to Plaintiff to
book international and domestic flights, hotel stays, and rental car bookings. 
 
Defendants present Plaintiff has
admitted that private information is contained in Exhibit A and argue that a
fee to obtain these documents does not exempt the Complaint from Cal. Rule of
Court, Rule 2.503(e)(2). Defendants reiterate their request.
 
By Plaintiff’s own arguments, (1)
the public can view the filed documents, including Exhibit A, upon a submission
of payment, and (2) the intended use of Don’s passport and driver’s license in
Exhibit A was not for the purpose of this litigation. 
 
Plaintiff is to provide a
redacted Exhibit A to the Court. 
 
Regarding punitive damages, Defendants
argue that 11 of the 19 causes of action are based in contract and, therefore,
punitive damages are not available. Defendants then cite cases and argue that
the allegations within the Complaint do not support a claim for punitive
damages under Cal. Civ. Code § 3294.
 
Plaintiff highlights that
Defendants’ cited case for contract law is without merit. Plaintiff highlights
that his tort claims are not based on breach of contract and Cal. Civ. Code §
3924 allows punitive damages in such cases so long as the facts pled are
sufficient to establish that the conduct of a defendant is malicious,
oppressive, or fraudulent. Plaintiff argues that his tort claims support an
award of punitive damages as they show that Defendants, specifically the
actions of Don, show a disregard of the rights and safety of others through the
actions taken to the Testarossa’s engine, conduct that subjects a person to
cruel and unjust hardship in conscious disregard of that person’s rights via
misrepresentations made by Don, and an intent to deceive by “ ‘depriving a
person of property or legal rights or otherwise causing injury.’ ” (Opp.4:26
[citing Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 3924(c)(3)].) 
 
In their Reply, Defendants
present that Plaintiff has conceded that he has causes of action that are based
on contract law and are not subject to punitive damages and argue that the “bad
conduct” attributed to defendant[2]
as set for in the opposition is insufficient to recover punitive damages due to
the strict standard for pleading an entitlement to punitive damages.
 
In Defendants’ cited case, Myers
Building Industries, Ltd. v. Interface Technology, Inc (1993) 13
Cal.App.4th 949 (“Myers Building Industries”), the Court reviewed
punitive damages in light of a special jury verdict that discussed breach of
contract then asked if there was any oppression, fraud, or malice in the
conduct of defendant towards plaintiff, held that the jury was not requested to
make necessary factual findings as to the fraud and other tort causes of
actions, thus punitive damages were not allowed. This is significantly
different from the case and procedural posture at hand. Defendants seek to
strike punitive damages at the pleading stage, arguing that Myers Building
Industries does not allow punitive damages in a Complaint where both breach
of contract and tort claims are present. This is, however, not what Myers
Building Industries holds. Tort liability is a necessary predicate for
punitive damages, and Plaintiff has pled tort liability separately from his
breach of contract claims. (See Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 3294(a).)
 
As to whether the allegations are
sufficient, to succeed on a motion to strike punitive damages allegations, it
must be said as a matter of law that the alleged behavior was not so vile,
base, or contemptible that it would not be looked down upon and despised by
ordinary decent people. (Angie M. v. Superior Court (1995) 37
Cal.App.4th 1217, 1228-1229.) Civil Code section 3294, subsection (a)
authorizes punitive damages “where the defendant has been guilty of oppression,
fraud, or malice.” (Civil Code §3294(a).) “In order to survive a motion to
strike an allegation of punitive damages, the ultimate facts showing an
entitlement to such relief must be pled by a plaintiff. In passing on the
correctness of a ruling on a motion to strike, judges read allegations of a
pleading subject to a motion to strike as a whole, all parts in their context,
and assume their truth. In ruling on a motion to strike, courts do not read
allegations in isolation.” (Clauson v. Superior Ct. (1998) 67
Cal.App.4th 1253, 1255.)
 
Cal. Civ. Code § 3924(c) provides
the following definitions:
 
·        
“Malice” means conduct which is intended by the
defendant to cause injury to the plaintiff or despicable conduct which is
carried on by the defendant with a willful and conscious disregard of the
rights or safety of others.
·        
“Oppression” means despicable conduct that
subjects a person to cruel and unjust hardship in conscious disregard of that
person’s rights.
·        
“Fraud” means an intentional misrepresentation,
deceit, or concealment of a material fact known to the defendant with the
intention on the part of the defendant of thereby depriving a person of
property or legal rights or otherwise causing injury.
 
Further willful misconduct may be
inferred from an actor’s conduct:
 
Three essential
elements must be present to raise a negligent act to the level of wilful [sic]
misconduct: (1) actual or constructive knowledge of the peril to be
apprehended, (2) actual or constructive knowledge that injury is a probable, as
opposed to a possible, result of the danger, and (3) conscious failure to act
to avoid the peril.
 
[. . .]
 
If conduct is
sufficiently lacking in consideration for the rights of others, reckless,
heedless to an extreme, and indifferent to the consequences it may impose,
then, regardless of the actual state of mind of the actor and his actual
concern for the rights of others, we call it wilful [sic] misconduct, and apply
to it the consequences and legal rules which we use in the field of intended
torts.
 
(New v. Consolidated Rock
Products Co. (1985) 171 Cal.App.3d 681, 689-90 (“New”).)
 
The pleadings are sufficient.
Through the allegations regarding the Testarossa’s engine, Plaintiff has
alleged conduct “sufficiently lacking in consideration for the rights of
others, reckless, heedless to an extreme, and indifferent to the consequences
it may impose” which rises to the level of malice. (Id. at 690.)
Likewise, Plaintiff’s pleadings allege a pattern of practice which not only
deprived Plaintiff of his property but also can be found to be malicious as
defined by Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 3924. 
 
Accordingly, the Motion to Strike
is DENIED.
 
-----
 
Conclusion
 
Defendants Don H. B. Callaway and
Cara Callaway’s Motion to Strike is DENIED.
 
Plaintiff is to provide a
redacted copy of Exhibit A.
