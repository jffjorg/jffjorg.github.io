And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Ford Motor Company (FMC) and Diamond Ford. The demurrer was filed against the fifth and sixth causes of action in the complaint, which are allegations of fraudulent inducement and negligent repair.

For the fifth cause of action, the Judge concludes that the allegations of concealment and suppression of a material fact by FMC, along with the intentional concealment or suppression of the material fact with the intent to defraud, and the damage caused to the plaintiff, are sufficient to state a cause of action for fraudulent inducement. The Judge also finds that the economic loss rule does not apply in this case, as the fraudulent inducement is an independent tort that is not barred by the economic loss rule.

For the sixth cause of action, the Judge concludes that the allegations of negligent repair by Diamond Ford and the damage caused to the plaintiff, including loss of the Subject Vehicle and exposure to risk of liability, accident, and injury, are sufficient to state a cause of action for negligent repair. The Judge also finds that the economic loss rule does not apply in this case, as the negligent repair is a breach of the duty of care that is not barred by the economic loss rule.

Therefore, the demurrer to the fifth and sixth causes of action is OVERRULED, and the case will proceed to trial.
