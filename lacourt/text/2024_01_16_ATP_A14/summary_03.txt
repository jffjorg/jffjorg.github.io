And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is denying the Motion to Quash filed by Defendants Don H. B. Callaway and Cara Callaway. The Motion to Quash is directed against a subpoena issued to Fox Hangar, LLC, seeking documents and tangible things related to the business relationship between Don and Fox Hangar. The Judge finds that the subpoena is not overly broad, and the requested documents are reasonably available to Fox Hangar. The Judge also finds that the requested financial records are not impermissible at this time. The Judge notes that the Plaintiff has shown a need for the documents, which may lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. The Judge modifies the subpoena to exclude credit score reports, and the Motion to Quash is denied.
