And here is a summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in response to a motion to strike certain allegations in a complaint filed by Plaintiff Arthur Antoine H. Teerlynck against Defendants Don H. B. Callaway and Cara Callaway. The Defendants seek to strike the verification attached to the complaint, certain references to punitive damages, and Exhibit A, which contains private information about the Defendants.

The judge has denied the motion to strike, finding that the verification is proper and does not contain hearsay evidence. The judge also finds that the allegations in the complaint are sufficient to support a claim for punitive damages, and that the conduct alleged by the Plaintiff rises to the level of malice.

The judge has ordered the Plaintiff to provide a redacted copy of Exhibit A.
