MOTION
 
Plaintiff Mela Ferrer (“Plaintiff”), in pro per, seeks an order
of contempt against Defendant Benson Gilliard DBA Better Cardio & Body LLC (“Defendant”)
for failing to comply with the Court’s June 27, 2022 judgment against him by
sending Plaintiff monthly “Invoices,” which show an accounting of Defendant’s
outstanding balance owed to Plaintiff that omit the $18,749.21 in prejudgment interest
awarded by the Court and also contain other improper deductions to the outstanding
balance owed.  Defendant has not opposed
the motion.
 
BACKGROUND
 
            This case stems from a loan
Plaintiff extended to Defendant to finance Defendant’s new business, which
Defendant failed to repay, pursuant to the parties’ loan agreement.  
 
            On November 14, 2019, the Court
entered a default judgment against Defendant. 
On October 16, 2020, Defendant filed a motion to vacate the judgment,
which the Court granted on September 2, 2021. 
Defendant answered the complaint by way of a general denial on September
8, 2021.
 
            Plaintiff informed the Court she was
not properly served notice of Defendant’s motion to vacate, so on January 24,
2022, the Court granted Plaintiff the opportunity to file an opposition, and
reconsidered Defendant’s motion. 
Plaintiff filed an opposition to the motion to vacate on January 27,
2022.  On March 25, 2022, after reading
and considering Plaintiff’s opposition, the Court again granted Defendant’s
Motion to Vacate the Default Judgment and ordered Defendant to answer
Plaintiff’s complaint by April 14, 2022. 
Defendant did so by filing a general denial on April 12, 2022.
 
            On June 10, 2022, the Court denied
Plaintiff’s motion for entry of default against Defendant and the case
proceeded to a bench trial on June 27, 2022. 
At trial, the Court heard testimony from both parties and admitted
documentary evidence from Plaintiff. 
Following the trial, the Court entered judgment in Plaintiff’s favor in
the amount of $44,208.41 in principal and $18,749.21 in prejudgment interest,
for a total award of $62,957.62.  The
Court denied Plaintiff’s request for punitive damages.
 
            On May 25, 2023, Plaintiff filed a
“Motion for Document Fraud” and on June 7, 2023, Plaintiff filed a “Motion to
Amend Motion for Document Fraud,” both of which were unopposed.  In the Court’s June 22, 2023 Minute Order, the
Court noted that it was unclear what relief Plaintiff sought, but that she
appeared to be again requesting an award of punitive damages, and that
Plaintiff appeared to be expressing her dissatisfaction that Defendant had not
satisfied the June 27, 2022 judgment entered against him and had not paid
Plaintiff’s attorney’s fees and costs. 
The Court denied the motion, on the basis that the issue of punitive
damages was addressed at trial, and Plaintiff had not timely appealed, and
Plaintiff had also not timely submitted a memorandum of costs, and thus had
waived the right to recoup attorneys’ fees and costs.  (June 22, 2023 Minute Order.)
ANALYSIS
 
            Code of Civil Procedure section
1209, subdivision (a) provides, in relevant part, “The following acts or
omissions in respect to a court of justice, or proceedings therein, are
contempts of the authority of the court: […] (5) Disobedience of any lawful
judgment, order, or process of the court.” 

 
            Penal Code section 166 outlines the
specific behaviors that constitute criminal contempt of court, as well as their
respective penalties.  
 
As a threshold matter, it is unclear what specific relief Plaintiff
seeks by the motion, other than a declaratory order that Defendant’s invoices
constitute civil contempt of the Court’s June 27, 2022 judgment.  Plaintiff already has a judgment entitling
her to $62,957.62.  Defendant’s invoices
do not warrant additional monetary sanctions, as would defiance of a court
order constituting an abuse of the discovery process, for example.  Nor are the invoices encompassed within Penal
Code section 166, warranting fines and/or imprisonment.  
 
In any event, the Court finds Plaintiff’s motion for contempt
procedurally and substantively improper. 
Contempt proceedings are quasi-criminal in nature and require personal
service on the refusing party, regardless of whether they are represented by
counsel. (Cedars-Sinai Imaging Medical Group v. Superior Court (2000) 83
Cal.App.4th 1281, 1286-1287.)  Here,
Plaintiff’s proof of service indicates Plaintiff served Defendant by mail only.
 
Furthermore, Plaintiff has not provided any admissible evidence in
support of the motion.  The exhibits
attached to the motion are not authenticated by a declaration signed under
penalty of perjury, or otherwise, to establish their authenticity.
 
Moreover, to the extent Plaintiff contends Defendant provided an
inaccurate accounting of the debt owed, the judgment did not order Defendant to
provide an accounting, and as such, the invoices are not a direct violation of
the judgment.  To the extent Plaintiff
interprets the invoices as a signal that Defendant does not intend to pay the
full judgment, the California Constitution prohibits imprisonment for
debt.  (Cal. Const., art. I, § 10.)  As such, the Court cannot hold Defendant in
contempt for failure to pay the debt owed. 
(Knutte v. Superior Court of City and County of San Francisco
(1901) 134 Cal. 660, 661; Crider v. Superior Court (1993) 15 Cal.App.4th
227, 232 [“It goes without saying that such money judgments in civil actions
for debt cannot be enforced by contempt”].)
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER 
 
Therefore, the Court denies Plaintiff’s motion for contempt as procedurally
and substantively faulty.   The Clerk of the Court shall provide notice of
the Court’s ruling.
