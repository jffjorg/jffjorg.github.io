And here is the summary in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for contempt filed by Plaintiff Mela Ferrer against Defendant Benson Gilliard DBA Better Cardio & Body LLC. The motion seeks an order of contempt against Defendant for failing to comply with the Court's June 27, 2022 judgment by sending Plaintiff monthly invoices that omit the $18,749.21 in prejudgment interest awarded by the Court and contain other improper deductions to the outstanding balance owed.

The Court finds that Plaintiff's motion is procedurally and substantively improper. Contempt proceedings are quasi-criminal in nature and require personal service on the refusing party, which was not done in this case. Furthermore, Plaintiff has not provided any admissible evidence in support of the motion.

The Court also notes that the judgment did not order Defendant to provide an accounting, and therefore the invoices are not a direct violation of the judgment. Additionally, the California Constitution prohibits imprisonment for debt, and the Court cannot hold Defendant in contempt for failure to pay the debt owed.

Therefore, the Court denies Plaintiff's motion for contempt as procedurally and substantively faulty.

**Summary of Judge's Tentative Ruling:**

The Judge is leaning towards denying Mela Ferrer's motion for contempt against Benson Gilliard. The Judge finds the motion procedurally and substantively improper.  Procedurally, the Defendant was served by mail instead of personal service, which is required for contempt motions. Substantively, the Judge states that the Plaintiff did not provide admissible evidence.  Also, the Judge notes that the original judgment did not order the Defendant to provide an accounting, so the invoices are not a direct violation of the judgment. Finally, the judge notes that the state constitution prohibits imprisonment for debt, so the Defendant cannot be held in contempt for failing to pay. Therefore, the Court intends to deny the motion.

**Summary in English Text:**

The Judge issued a tentative ruling denying Mela Ferrer's motion for contempt against Benson Gilliard (doing business as Better Cardio & Body LLC).  Ferrer, representing herself, claimed Gilliard was in contempt of court for not fully complying with a June 27, 2022 judgment.  The judgment stemmed from a loan Ferrer made to Gilliard that he didn't repay.  The court had previously awarded Ferrer $62,957.62, including principal and prejudgment interest.  Ferrer's contempt motion alleged Gilliard sent her invoices that didn't include the prejudgment interest and contained other improper deductions.

The Judge denied the motion for several reasons. First, Ferrer didn't properly serve Gilliard with the motion; contempt proceedings require personal service, and Ferrer only served him by mail. Second, Ferrer didn't provide any admissible evidence (like a declaration under penalty of perjury) to support her claims.  Third, the original judgment didn't order Gilliard to provide an accounting, so the invoices themselves weren't a direct violation. Finally, even if Gilliard isn't intending to pay the full debt, the California Constitution prohibits jailing someone for debt, so contempt isn't an appropriate remedy for non-payment. The motion was therefore denied as both procedurally and substantively flawed.
