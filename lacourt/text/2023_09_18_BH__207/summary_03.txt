And here is the summary in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for contempt filed by Plaintiff Mela Ferrer against Defendant Benson Gilliard DBA Better Cardio & Body LLC. The motion seeks an order of contempt against Defendant for failing to comply with the Court's June 27, 2022 judgment by sending Plaintiff monthly invoices that omit the $18,749.21 in prejudgment interest awarded by the Court and contain other improper deductions to the outstanding balance owed.

The Court finds that Plaintiff's motion is procedurally and substantively improper. Contempt proceedings are quasi-criminal in nature and require personal service on the refusing party, which was not done in this case. Furthermore, Plaintiff has not provided any admissible evidence in support of the motion.

The Court also notes that the judgment did not order Defendant to provide an accounting, and therefore the invoices are not a direct violation of the judgment. Additionally, the California Constitution prohibits imprisonment for debt, and the Court cannot hold Defendant in contempt for failure to pay the debt owed.

Therefore, the Court denies Plaintiff's motion for contempt as procedurally and substantively faulty.
