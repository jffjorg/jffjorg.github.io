IJSC wanted to sue the brothers for an outstanding balance on their mother's account from her residency at the facility.

Therefore, the judge ruled that IJSC's proposed cross-complaint is procedurally improper and denied their motion.

The Judge also highlights that the proposed cross-claims against Mehrdad Setareh, a nonparty to the action, are procedurally improper.
