And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling denies the motion for leave to file a cross-complaint by the Defendant Iranian Jewish Senior Center (IJSC) against the Plaintiff Kamran Setareh and his brother Mehrdad Setareh. The cross-complaint is based on a guaranty on an outstanding balance owed related to their mother's residence at the facility from 2019-2020. The Court finds that the proposed cross-claims are procedurally improper because they do not arise out of the same transaction, occurrence, or series of transactions or occurrences as the verbal and physical altercation that allegedly occurred against Plaintiff on IJSC's premises in 2021.
