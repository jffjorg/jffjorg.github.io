IJSC wanted to sue the brothers for an outstanding balance on their mother's account from her residency at the facility. However, the judge found that this claim is not related to the original lawsuit filed by Kamran Setareh against IJSC and another defendant for an alleged verbal and physical altercation that occurred at the facility. 

Therefore, the judge ruled that IJSC's proposed cross-complaint is procedurally improper and denied their motion.

**English Text Summary of the Tentative Ruling:**

The Judge is likely to deny the Iranian Jewish Senior Center's (IJSC) motion to file a cross-complaint against Kamran Setareh (the Plaintiff) and his brother, Mehrdad Setareh. The Plaintiff is suing the Defendants for emotional distress, assault, battery, and elder abuse stemming from an altercation. IJSC wants to cross-complain because the Plaintiff's mother had an outstanding bill from her time living at the facility, and the Plaintiff and his brother were guarantors. The Judge believes the debt and the altercation are unrelated events, making the cross-complaint procedurally improper, especially against Mehrdad Setareh, who is not already a party to the lawsuit.  The motion is unopposed, but the Judge still finds it without merit. Therefore, the Judge intends to deny IJSC's request. IJSC is responsible for notifying all parties of this ruling.

**English Text Summary of the Tentative Ruling:**

The Iranian Jewish Senior Center (IJSC) filed a motion to file a cross-complaint against the plaintiff, Kamran Setareh, and his brother, Mehrdad Setareh.  The cross-complaint is related to an unpaid bill for the residency of the Setareh brothers' mother at IJSC. The original lawsuit filed by Kamran Setareh against IJSC and Iraj Kanani concerns a physical and verbal altercation that took place at IJSC. The judge tentatively *denies* IJSC's motion. The judge's reasoning is that the proposed cross-complaint (about the mother's unpaid bill) does *not* arise from the same "transaction or occurrence" as the original complaint (about the altercation), and it does not involve the same subject matter. Furthermore, adding Mehrdad Setareh as a cross-defendant in this unrelated matter is procedurally improper. Because the motion was unopposed does not change this outcome. IJSC must provide notice of the ruling.
