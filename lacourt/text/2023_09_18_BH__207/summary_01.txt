However, the judge found that this claim is not related to the original lawsuit filed by Kamran Setareh against IJSC and another defendant for an alleged verbal and physical altercation that occurred at the facility.

The judge has denied the Iranian Jewish Senior Center's (IJSC) motion to file a cross-complaint against the plaintiff, Kamran Setareh, and his brother, Mehrdad Setareh.

However, the judge found that the IJSC had not demonstrated that the guaranty claim arose out of the same transaction or occurrence as the verbal and physical altercation that allegedly occurred against the plaintiff on IJSC's premises in 2021. Therefore, the judge denied the motion, finding that the proposed cross-complaint was procedurally improper. The IJSC is required to provide notice of the court's ruling and file a proof of service.

**English Text Summary of the Tentative Ruling:**

The Judge is likely to deny the Iranian Jewish Senior Center's (IJSC) motion to file a cross-complaint against Kamran Setareh (the Plaintiff) and his brother, Mehrdad Setareh. The Plaintiff is suing the Defendants for emotional distress, assault, battery, and elder abuse stemming from an altercation. IJSC wants to cross-complain because the Plaintiff's mother had an outstanding bill from her time living at the facility, and the Plaintiff and his brother were guarantors. The Judge believes the debt and the altercation are unrelated events, making the cross-complaint procedurally improper, especially against Mehrdad Setareh, who is not already a party to the lawsuit.  The motion is unopposed, but the Judge still finds it without merit. Therefore, the Judge intends to deny IJSC's request. IJSC is responsible for notifying all parties of this ruling.

**English Text Summary of the Tentative Ruling:**

The Iranian Jewish Senior Center (IJSC) filed a motion to file a cross-complaint against the plaintiff, Kamran Setareh, and his brother, Mehrdad Setareh.  The cross-complaint is related to an unpaid bill for the residency of the Setareh brothers' mother at IJSC. The original lawsuit filed by Kamran Setareh against IJSC and Iraj Kanani concerns a physical and verbal altercation that took place at IJSC. The judge tentatively *denies* IJSC's motion. The judge's reasoning is that the proposed cross-complaint (about the mother's unpaid bill) does *not* arise from the same "transaction or occurrence" as the original complaint (about the altercation), and it does not involve the same subject matter. Furthermore, adding Mehrdad Setareh as a cross-defendant in this unrelated matter is procedurally improper. Because the motion was unopposed does not change this outcome. IJSC must provide notice of the ruling.

## English Summary:

In this case, Kamran Setareh is suing Iraj Kanani and the Iranian Jewish Senior Center (IJSC) for assault, battery, and emotional distress stemming from an incident at IJSC's facility in 2021. IJSC wants to file a cross-complaint against Setareh and his brother, Mehrdad, who guaranteed their mother's account balance at the facility from 2019 to 2020.

The judge ruled that IJSC cannot proceed with the cross-complaint because the alleged breach of guaranty is not directly related to the incident in 2021.  The judge found that the two matters are unrelated and therefore, the cross-complaint is procedurally improper.

**Case Number:** 22SMCV01213

**Hearing Date:** September 18, 2023

**Department:** 207

**Motion:** Motion for Leave to File Cross-Complaint

**Moving Party:** Defendant Iranian Jewish Senior Center (erroneously sued as “Beverly Hills Loving Care”)

**Opposing Party:** None

---

The plaintiff, Kamran Setareh, sued defendants Iraj Kanani and Iranian Jewish Senior Center for intentional infliction of emotional distress, civil assault, civil battery, and elder abuse. The dispute arose from an alleged verbal and physical altercation that took place on the IJSC's premises on April 26, 2021.

IJSC seeks to file a cross-complaint against plaintiff Kamran Setareh and his brother, Mehrdad Setareh, due to their role as guarantors for an outstanding balance related to their mother's residence at the facility from April 16, 2019, to December 15, 2020. The motion is unopposed.

Code of Civil Procedure section 428.10 allows a party to file a cross-complaint against any parties who have filed a complaint or cross-complaint against them, as long as the cause of action arises out of the same transaction or occurrence. IJSC's proposed cross-complaint against Mehrdad Setareh, a nonparty to the existing action, is procedurally improper because it does not arise out of the same transaction or occurrence as the primary dispute.

**Conclusion:** The court denies IJSC's motion for leave to file the proposed cross-complaint in this action.

**Order:** Defendant IJSC shall provide notice of the Court's ruling and file a proof of service of such.
