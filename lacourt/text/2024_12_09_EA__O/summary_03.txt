And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the request for judicial notice, but denied the request for non-binding authority. The defendant argued that since the plaintiffs acknowledge the decedent's death was due to natural causes, the decedent could never be liable for his death. However, the defendant failed to provide a citation for this acknowledgement. The judge noted that a claim for wrongful death based on medical negligence must be brought within one year of the complained of conduct, and that the one-year limitations period begins to run when a plaintiff discovers or suspects that their injury was caused by wrongdoing. The judge also ruled that a complaint is not subject to demurrer for violation of the statute of limitations unless the complaint unequivocally shows on its face that it is time-barred. Additionally, the judge noted that California Code of Civil Procedure section 364(d) provides that when a notice of intent to sue is served within 90 days of the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations, the time for the commencement of the action is extended 90 days from the service of the notice.
