Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge sustains the demurrer to the complaint with leave to amend, finding that the plaintiff has failed to plead particularity and specificity in support of the causes of action. The demurrer is sustained as to the first cause of action for elder abuse/neglect, the third cause of action for violation of resident rights, and the wrongful death/negligence COAs. The motion to strike portions of the complaint is rendered moot by the demurrer. The judge finds that the plaintiff must plead with particularity and specificity in support of the causes of action, and that the complaint fails to do so.
