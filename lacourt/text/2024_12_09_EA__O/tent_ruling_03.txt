[1] The request for judicial notice is granted. (See FAC
p. 13 of 13 of PDF.)  
 


[2] Defendant also argues that “since Plaintiffs
acknowledge Decedent’s death was due to natural causes Decedent could never be
liable for his death. (See Civil Code § 1714.8).” (Demurrer p. 20:8-9.) However,
Defendant does not provide a citation as to where Plaintiffs make such an
acknowledgement. 
 


[3] A claim for wrongful death based on medical
negligence must be brought within one year of the complained of conduct. (Code
Civ. Proc. § 340.5) The one-year limitations period begins to run when a
plaintiff discovers or suspects (subjective test) or should discover or suspect
(objective test) that his or her injury was caused by wrongdoing. (Reply p. 10,
citing Gutierrez v. Mofid (1985) 39 Cal.3d 892.) However, as noted in
opposition, a complaint is not subject to demurrer for violation of the statute
of limitations unless the complaint unequivocally shows on its face that it is
time barred. (Opp. p. 8 citing Greninger v. Fischer (1983) 81 Cal.App.2d 549,
553.) Moreover, as further noted in opposition, pursuant to C.C.P. §452, the
complaint must be read liberally. Additionally, according to Plaintiffs and not
otherwise disputed by Defendant, California Code of Civil Procedure section
364(d) provides that when a notice of intent to sue is “served within 90 days
of the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations, the time for the
commencement of the action shall be extended 90 days from the service of the
notice.”  
 


[4] At this juncture, the Plaintiffs’ request for
judicial notice of non-binding authority is denied.
