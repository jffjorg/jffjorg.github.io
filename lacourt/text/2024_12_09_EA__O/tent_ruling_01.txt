Background
 
This case pertains to an HOA. Plaintiff DIAMOND BAR VILLAGE ASSOCIATION
alleges the following against Defendant WAN XING 321, LLC: Defendant breached
the terms of the CC&Rs, Bylaws, Rules, and other documents governing the
HOA (collectively, the “Governing Documents”).
 
On November 7, 2023, Plaintiff filed suit for: 
 
1.    
COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF
2.    
BREACH
OF COVENANT FORECLOSURE
3.    
ACCOUNT STATED.
 
On February 27, 2024, a proof of service of summons (POS) was filed
indicating that the Authorized Agent for Service of Process was served via
substituted service by serving the spouse of the agent. That same day,
default was entered against Defendant.
 
On October 8, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant application for entry of
default judgment. 
 
Discussion
 
According to the proposed order, Plaintiff seeks both a monetary judgment
and an order for foreclosure of the lien. The application for the following two
defects. 
 
1.    
Service
 
 
 
An LLC must designate an agent for service of process on the
information form filed biennially with the Secretary of State. A plaintiff may
serve an LLC by serving the person designated as its agent for service of
process. (Corp C § 17060(a)(2).) The designated agent may be
served either by personal service, substitute service, or service by mail with
acknowledgment of receipt. (CCP §§ 415.10, 415.20(a), 415.30(a))
 
Here,
however, HECTOR GONZALEZ SANCHEZ is the Authorized Agent for Service of
Process, but his
spouse was served. Should service upon Sanchez have not been possible,
there are methods to effectuate service (see e.g. Corp. Code section 1702), but
serving the spouse is not one of them. 
 
Therefore, absent service of the summons and complaint, any
request for default, let alone default judgment, is not ripe. 
 
2. Open-Ended Liability 
CCP section 580 states that “[t]he relief granted to the plaintiff, if there
is no answer, cannot exceed that which he or she shall have demanded in his or
her complaint, in the statement required by Section 425.11, or in the statement
provided for by Section 425.115.” “The Legislature enacted section 580 and
related statutes to ensure that a defendant who declines to contest an action
does not suffer open-ended liability.” (Electric Funds Solutions, LLC v.
Murphy (2005) 134 Cal.App.4th 1161, 1173.) 
Here, the complaint does not set forth any amount of damages, even in the
account stated COA. Effectively, this amounts to open-ended liability.
Accordingly, the complaint itself fundamentally fails as the primary purpose of
section 580 which is to guarantee defaulting parties adequate notice of the
maximum judgment that may be assessed against them. (Greenup v. Rodman
(1986) 42 Cal.3d 822, 826.)
Therefore, should Plaintiff seek default judgment against Defendant, they
are to file and serve a new/amended complaint.
Conclusion
Based on the foregoing, the 2/27/24 default is set aside/vacated and the
application is otherwise denied WITH prejudice.
