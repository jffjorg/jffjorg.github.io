Roles:
  - Judge: ruling on the application for entry of default judgment
  - Plaintiff: Diamond Bar Village Association
  - Defendant: Wan Xing 321, LLC
Significant Statements:
  - "The application is denied for invalid/improper service and the complaint amounts to open-ended liability."

  - "Effectively, this amounts to open-ended liability."
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's application for entry of default judgment with prejudice. The application was denied because the service of summons was invalid and the complaint is open-ended, meaning it does not specify an amount of damages. The judge has set aside the default entered against the defendant on February 27, 2024. The plaintiff must file and serve an amended complaint if they wish to seek default judgment. The ruling is based on the California Corporations Code and the Code of Civil Procedure, which require that a plaintiff specify the amount of damages they are seeking in their complaint.
