And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The defendant, Jean Firstenberg, has moved to strike the punitive damages allegations in the complaint filed by the plaintiff, Morgan Chin. The complaint arises from an automobile accident that occurred on December 9, 2021, at the intersection of Wilshire Blvd and Franklin St in Santa Monica, California. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant's reckless and negligent behavior caused the accident. The defendant's motion to strike is based on the argument that the plaintiff's allegations do not rise to the level of despicable conduct required to support a claim for punitive damages.

The judge has reviewed the complaint and the case law and has concluded that the plaintiff's allegations do not meet the standard for despicable conduct. The judge has also noted that the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate a reasonable probability of successfully amending the complaint to address the defendant's concerns.

Therefore, the judge has granted the defendant's motion to strike the punitive damages allegations without leave to amend. This means that the plaintiff will not be able to pursue a claim for punitive damages and the case will proceed with the remaining claims.
