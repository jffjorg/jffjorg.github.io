Roles:
  - Judge: [Judge's name]
Significant Statements:
  - The defendant has the initial burden to demonstrate that the claims alleged against him each arise from protected activity.
  - A claim arises from protected activity when that activity underlies or forms the basis for the claim.
  - Public interest includes not only governmental matters, but also private conduct that impacts a broad segment of society and/or that affects a community in a manner similar to that of a governmental entity.
  - The motion is DENIED.
```

Summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the motion to strike the Third Amended Complaint of Plaintiffs is DENIED. The Judge finds that the claims do not arise out of free speech or petitioning conduct in connection with a public issue. The dispute is limited to a single lot and does not impact the broader HOA community. Therefore, the conduct of the board members, including Riddick, does not meet the requirements of section 425.16 of the Code of Civil Procedure.
