RELIEF
REQUESTED 
 
             Plaintiff moves for an order
compelling Delilah Salas to appear for deposition. 
 
BACKGROUND
 
             This case arises out of Plaintiff Jane Doe’s
(“Plaintiff”) claim that she was the victim of childhood sexual assault during
the 2011/2012 school year when she was a student at Mount Gleason Middle School
in Los Angeles California. Plaintiff filed this complaint on April 16, 2021. 
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
            Plaintiff’s motion for an order compelling Salas to
comply with the deposition subpoena is GRANTED. 
 
LEGAL STANDARD
 
 
“If a subpoena requires the
attendance of a witness or the production of books, documents, electronically stored information, or other
things before a court, or at the trial of an issue therein, or at the taking of
a deposition, the court, upon motion reasonably made by any person described in
subdivision (b), or upon the court's own motion after giving counsel notice and
an opportunity to be heard, may make an order quashing the subpoena entirely,
modifying it, or directing compliance with it upon those terms or conditions as
the court shall declare, including protective orders. In addition, the court
may make any other order as may be appropriate to protect the person from
unreasonable or oppressive demands, including unreasonable violations of the
right of privacy of the person.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 1987.1, subd. (a).)
 
DISCUSSION
 
            On
August 25, 2023, Plaintiff served a deposition subpoena for Salas with the
deposition date scheduled for September 7, 2023. (Suh Decl. ¶ 2, Exhibit 1.) Salas appeared remotely for deposition at
10:06 a.m. on September 7, 2023. (Id. ¶ 3.) At around 11:04 a.m., Salas
exited the remote deposition. (Ibid, Exhibit 2.) Plaintiff’s counsel
contacted Salas to resume the deposition, but Salas refused to resume the
deposition. (Id. ¶ 4.) Plaintiff has demonstrated that she served a
deposition subpoena on Salas, but that Salas refused to continue with the
deposition.
 
            Plaintiff’s motion for an order compelling Salas to
comply with the deposition subpoena served on August 25, 2023, is granted. Plaintiff
is ordered to confer with Salas regarding a potential date to resume
deposition. 
 
CONCLUSION
 
            Plaintiff’s motion for an order compelling Salas to
comply with the deposition subpoena is GRANTED.
