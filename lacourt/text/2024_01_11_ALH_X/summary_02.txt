And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling grants Pasadena Unified School District's (PUSD) motion to set aside the default entered against it on October 16, 2023. The case involves Jane Doe K.B.'s claim of childhood sexual assault and abuse between 1975 and 1977. PUSD claims that its failure to respond to the lawsuit was due to the mistake of one of its employees, Diana Orona, who retired shortly after the lawsuit was served. The court found that PUSD demonstrated excusable neglect and granted the motion to set aside the default.
