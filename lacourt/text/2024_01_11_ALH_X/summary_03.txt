And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to appoint a receiver over the defendants' property. The plaintiff, Diana Turk Barnes, claims that the defendants' property poses a risk to her property and seeks to have a receiver appointed to oversee the investigation, remediation, and all related transactions. However, the judge finds that the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate a sufficient threat to the preservation of her property or property rights to justify the appointment of a receiver.

The judge notes that the plaintiff's expert, Sean D. Wilson, has opined that the slope on the defendants' property will continue to erode and fail absent "immediate" measures, but that his declaration is speculative and lacks reasoned support. The judge also finds that the plaintiff has failed to establish why the hazardous condition on the defendants' property requires "immediate" remediation other than speculatively asserting that this year's rain could cause harm.

The judge concludes that the appointment of a receiver is not necessary in this case, as the plaintiff has not demonstrated that any reasonably certain benefit will result from the appointment, and that a distinct disadvantage will result to the defendants. The judge further notes that the plaintiff has failed to cite legal authority to support her claim and that the two primary cases cited by the plaintiff are readily distinguishable.
