BACKGROUND
 
             This case arises out of Plaintiff Jane Doe
K.B.’s (“Plaintiff”) claim she was the victim of childhood sexual assault and
abuse between 1975 and 1977. Plaintiff filed this case on November 21, 2022
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 340.1. 
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
            PUSD’s
motion to set aside the entry of default is GRANTED. 
 
LEGAL STANDARD
 
“Section 473(b) provides for both discretionary and
mandatory relief. [Citation.]” (Pagnini v. Union Bank, N.A. (2018) 28 Cal.App.5th
298, 302.)  The discretionary relief provisions of Code of Civil Procedure
section 473, subd. (b) provide in relevant part: “The court may, upon any terms
as may be just, relieve a party or his or her legal representative from a
judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against him or her
through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. Application
for this relief shall be accompanied by a copy of the answer or
other pleading proposed to be filed therein, otherwise the application
shall not be granted, and shall be made within a reasonable time, in no case
exceeding six months, after the judgment, dismissal, order, or proceeding was
taken.” 
 
The mandatory relief provision provides that a court shall grant
relief “whenever an application for relief is made no more than six months after
entry of judgment, is in proper form, and is accompanied by an attorney’s sworn
affidavit attesting to his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect,
vacate any (1) resulting default entered by the clerk against his or her
client, and which will result in entry of a default judgment, or (2) resulting
default judgment or dismissal entered against his or her client, unless the
court finds that the default or dismissal was not in fact caused by the
attorney’s mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect.” (Code Civ. Proc.
section 473, subd. (b).)
 
DISCUSSION
 
            PUSD
moves to set aside the default that was entered against it. Plaintiff filed
this lawsuit on November 21, 2022. Plaintiff served PUSD on April 10, 2023, by
serving Diana Orona. Orona retired shortly after the lawsuit was served and no
other employee recalled receiving notice. (Wadlington ¶ 4.) Default was entered against PUSD on October 16, 2023. PUSD
has demonstrated that its failure to respond to the present lawsuit was based
on the mistake of one of its employees. Further, once PUSD was notified of the
default, it moved to set aside the entry of default.
 
            PUSD’s
motion to set aside the entry of default is granted. 
 
CONCLUSION
 
            PUSD’s
motion to set aside the entry of default is GRANTED.
