And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling grants the Plaintiff's motion for a protective order, allowing her to attend her deposition remotely. The Plaintiff, who is 83 or 84 years old, requested a remote deposition to reduce the risk of contracting COVID-19. The Defendant opposed the motion, arguing that no legal authority supports remote depositions. However, the Court found that Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.420 authorizes the Court to make any order that justice requires to protect a party from unwarranted annoyance, embarrassment, or oppression, or undue burden and expense. The Court grants the Plaintiff's motion and orders that she may attend her deposition remotely. The Court also makes suggestions for counsel to consider before the remote deposition takes place, including entering into a stipulation regarding the technology to be used, handling documents, and testing equipment and Internet connectivity.
