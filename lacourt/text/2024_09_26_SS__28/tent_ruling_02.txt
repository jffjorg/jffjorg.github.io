Meija  (“Jose Meija”), Mayra E. Meija (“Mayra Meija”), 5th Street Palm, LLC (“Palm”), City  of Los Angeles (“City”), and Does 1-100 for premises liability, negligence,  governmental tort liability, and loss of consortium.  On  April 14, 2022, Palm filed an answer.  On  October 17, 2022, the Court granted Plaintiffs’ request to file a first amended  complaint based on a stipulation between Plaintiffs, Palm, and the City.  On  May 2, 2023, the City filed an answer and a cross-complaint against  Cross-Defendants Palm, Jose Meija, Mayra Meija,  and Roes 1-10 for indemnification, apportionment of fault, and declaratory  relief.  On  February 20, 2024, Palm filed an answer to Plaintiffs’ first amended complaint.  On  August 22, 2024, the City filed (1) a motion to compel Contreras’  responses to the City’s demand for inspection and production of documents, set  one, and for sanctions and (2) a motion to compel Contreras’ responses to special interrogatories and form interrogatories and for  sanctions.  (The City should have filed two motions concerning interrogatories, one for each type of interrogatory.)  The motions were set for hearing on September 26,  2024.  On September 16, 2024, Contreras  file oppositions. On September 19, 2024, the City filed a reply.  Trial  is currently scheduled for February 21, 2025.  PARTIES’ REQUESTS  The  City asks the Court to compel Contreras to serve full and complete verified  responses, without objections, to the City’s demand for inspection and  production of documents, special interrogatories, and form interrogatories.   The City also asks the Court to impose sanctions on Contreras and her counsel.  Contreras  asks the Court to deny the motion.  LEGAL STANDARD  A.   Demand for inspection  Code  of Civil Procedure section 2031.300 provides in part:  “If a party to whom a demand for inspection, copying,  testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a timely response to it, the  following rules shall apply:  “(a) The party to whom the demand for inspection,  copying, testing, or sampling is directed waives any objection to the demand,  including one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under  Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve  that party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following  conditions are satisfied:  “(1) The party has subsequently served a response that  is in substantial compliance with Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230,  2031.240, and 2031.280.  “(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response  was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.  “(b) The party making the demand may move for an order  compelling response to the demand.  “(c) Except as provided in subdivision (d), the court  shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section  2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or  opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand for inspection, copying,  testing, or sampling, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction  acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the  imposition of the sanction unjust. . . .”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300,  subds. (a), (b), (c).)   B.   Interrogatories            Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.290 provides in part:  “If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails  to serve a timely response, the following rules apply:  “(a) The party to whom the interrogatories are  directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under  Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to the interrogatories, including  one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4  (commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that  party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following  conditions are satisfied:  “(1) The party has subsequently served a response that  is in substantial compliance with Sections 2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, and  2030.240.  “(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response  was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.  “(b) The party propounding the interrogatories may  move for an order compelling response to the interrogatories.  “(c) The court shall impose a monetary sanction under  Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or  attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to  interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted  with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition  of the sanction unjust. . . .”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290.)   DISCUSSION  On July  18, 2023, the City served demand for inspection and production of documents,  set one, special interrogatories, set one, and form interrogatories, set one, on  Contreras.  On September 19, 2023, Contreras  served unverified responses to the inspection demand and interrogatories.  Arguing  that the unverified responses are the equivalent of no responses, the City asks  the Court to order Contreras to serve verified responses.  In opposition,  counsel for Contreras asks the Court to deny the motions because, “[o]n information  and belief,” Contreras recently passed away.   Counsel does not state when Contreras died or when he learned of Contreras's death.  In  its reply, the City asks the Court to impose sanctions on Contreras’s counsel  for failing to advise the City of Contreras’s death before the City filed its  motions to compel.  The  Court continues the hearing and orders Contreras’s counsel to file a  declaration (1) providing the date of Contreras’s death,  (2) providing a death certificate if one exists, (3) providing the date Contreras’s  counsel learned of Contreras’s death, and (4) stating whether counsel plans to  dismiss Contreras from the case or seek appointment of a successor-in-interest  to pursue Contreras’s claims.  CONCLUSION  The  Court CONTINUES the hearing on Defendant City of Los Angeles’s motions to  compel Plaintiff Carmen Velasquez-Contreras’ verified responses to demand for  inspection and production of documents, set one, special interrogatories, set  one, and form interrogatories, set one, to November 13, 2024, at 1:30 p.m. in  Department 28 of the Spring Street Courthouse.  Contreras’  counsel is ordered to file and serve a declaration by November 7, 2024 which (1) provides the date of Contreras’s death, (2)  provides a death certificate if one exists, (3) provides the date Contreras’s  counsel learned of Contreras’s death, and (4) states whether counsel plans to  dismiss Contreras from the case or seek appointment of a successor-in-interest  to pursue Contreras’s claims.  Moving  party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.  Moving  party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court  within five days.
