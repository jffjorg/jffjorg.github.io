The Court continued the hearing to March 7, 2024. On March 7, 2024, the Court issued a ruling and continued the hearing to April 24, 2024. On March 21, 2024, Lilit Movsesyan, as trustee of the Xiaoling Mai special needs trust, filed a bond. On April 9, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel filed a declaration stating that counsel’s office had recently discovered that Plaintiff may have government-related liens. Counsel asked the Court to continue the hearing scheduled for April 24, 2024 for approximately sixty days to allow counsel to investigate the newly discovered government-related liens. Afterward, counsel would file an amended petition.  The Court continued the hearing to July 15, 2024. On July 15, 2024, the Court continued the hearing to August 20, 2024.  On August 20, 2024, the Court issued a tentative ruling, heard argument, and continued the hearing to September 26, 2024. On September 20, 2024, Petitioner filed a second amended petition to approve the compromise of Plaintiff’s case.No trial date is currently scheduled. PETITIONER’S REQUEST Petitioner Yu Mai asks the Court to approve the compromise of the pending action of Plaintiff Xiaoling Mai, including placement of the net settlement proceeds in a special needs trust. DISCUSSION A.   The second amended petition Petitioner has submitted a second amended petition asking the Court to approve the placement of the net settlement proceeds into a special needs trust for Plaintiff’s benefit. Although Petitioner has not filled out Sections 12b(2) and 12b(5) of the petition, the Court concludes that the petition as a whole (including Section 12b(5)(b) and counsel's declaration) demonstrates that all medical expenses that have not been reduced or waived will be paid or reimbursed out of the settlement proceeds.B.   Special needs trust   1.    Notice to State agencies When seeking approval of a special needs trust (SNT), the petitioner must give notice of the hearing and serve the petition on three State agencies: the Department of Mental Health, the Department of Developmental Services, and the Department of Health Care Services.  (Prob. Code, §§ 3602, subd. (f), 3611, subd. (c).) Petitioner has filed a notice of hearing with proof of service on the State agencies for the second amended petition dated September 11, 2024. 2.    The proposed trust instrument The main requirements for court-created or funded trusts are set forth at California Rules of Court, rule 7.903(c), and LASC rule 4.116(b).  The proposed trust instrument meets those requirements and is ready for approval for creation and/or funding. Petitioner has already signed the trust instrument (as indicated in the instrument attached to the petition) and a bond has been provided.  However, both are improper because the Court has not approved the creation and funding of the trust or made an order requiring a bond.   At the August 20, 2024 hearing, counsel advised the Court that the trustee has not taken any action as trustee (including funding of the trust) prior to authorization.  Petitioner may execute the trust instrument after the Court issues an order approving the petition.   3.    Trustee’s investment authority Petitioner requests authority for the trustee to invest in proprietary funds, mutual funds, and bonds with maturity dates greater than five years to provide for diversification and a higher rate of investment return.  The Court grants the request.  4.    Probate Code section 3604, subdivision (b), findings The Court finds: •         The SNT beneficiary has a disability which substantially impairs the individual’s ability to provide for her own care or custody and constitutes a substantial handicap;•         The SNT beneficiary is likely to have special needs that will not be met without the trust;•         The money to be paid to the trust does not exceed the amount that appears reasonably necessary to meet the SNT beneficiary’s special needs.  5.    Trustee and bond The proposed initial trustee is Lilit Movsesyan, a private professional fiduciary (PPF) in Glendale, California.  Normally, bond is required of a trustee unless the trustee is a corporate fiduciary.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.903(c)(5); Prob. Code, § 2320.)  A PPF does not meet that definition and bond is required. Petitioner calculates and requests a $75,340.26 bond, which appears to be correct.  While paragraph 8 of attachment 20 to the petition states that the bond amount is $75,340.26, however, paragraph 8 of attachment 13 to the proposed order lists the bond amount as "approximately $74,257.10."  The bond amounts should be consistent. Counsel will submit a modified proposed order to the Court showing a bond amount of $75,340.26. 6.    Proposed order Counsel will change the first accounting due date in paragraph 9 of attachment 13 to the proposed order from May 7, 2025 to a date in October 2025.CONCLUSION Subject to the Court receiving a revised proposed order listing a bond amount of $75,340.26 and setting a first accounting due date in October 2025, the Court GRANTS the second amended petition to approve the compromise Plaintiff Xiaoling Mai's action filed by Petitioner Yu Mai on September 20, 2024.  The Court orders the net settlement amount of $67,268.09 to be paid or transferred to the trustee of the Special Needs Trust for Xiaoling Mai established under Probate Code section 3604 for the benefit of Xiaoling Mai.Petitioner is ordered to give notice of this ruling. Petitioner is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court within five days.
