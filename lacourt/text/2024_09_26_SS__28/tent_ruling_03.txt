The party making the application shall state by affidavit what  application was made before, when and to what judge, what order or decisions  were made, and what new or different facts, circumstances, or law are claimed  to be shown.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1008, subd. (a).)            The  party moving for reconsideration under Code of Civil Procedure section 1008,  subdivision (a), “must provide a satisfactory explanation for failing to  present the information at the first hearing; i.e., a showing of reasonable  diligence.”  (L. Edmon & C. Karnow,  Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2024) ¶ 9:329, p.  9(l)-162.)  B.   Relief from dismissal under Code of Civil Procedure  section 473, subdivision (b)    Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b),  provides in part:  “Notwithstanding  any other requirements of this section, the court shall, whenever an  application for relief is made no more than six months after entry of judgment,  is in proper form, and is accompanied by an attorney’s sworn affidavit  attesting to his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect, vacate any  (1) resulting default entered by the clerk against his or her client, and which  will result in entry of a default judgment, or (2) resulting default judgment  or dismissal entered against his or her client, unless the court finds that the  default or dismissal was not in fact caused by the attorney’s mistake,  inadvertence, surprise, or neglect. The court shall, whenever relief is granted  based on an attorney’s affidavit of fault, direct the attorney to pay  reasonable compensatory legal fees and costs to opposing counsel or parties.  However, this section shall not lengthen the time  within which an action shall be brought to trial pursuant to Section 583.310.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b).)  DISCUSSION  A.   Plaintiff’s motion for reconsideration of July 15,  2024 order  On July 15, 2024, the Court denied Plaintiff’s motion  to reconsider, set aside, or vacate the Court’s January 4, 2024 and April 9,  2024 orders.  Plaintiff now moves under Code of Civil Procedure  section 1008 for reconsideration of the July 15, 2024 order on the ground that the  Court “erred in a very important aspect.”   (Motion p. 7.)  The Court finds that Plaintiff has failed to show new  or different facts, circumstances, or law.   The Court denies the motion.  B.   Plaintiff’s motion for relief under the Discovery Act  Citing Code of Civil Procedure sections 2033.280,  subdivision (a), 2030.290, subdivision (a), and 2031.300, subdivision (a),  Plaintiff asks the Court to grant relief from the Court’s January 4, 2024 order  granting Apex’s motions to compel discovery responses and deeming admitted  matters specified in requests for admission.  The Court denies the motion.  Plaintiff did not serve discovery responses  before the January 4, 2024 hearing on the discovery motions or by the February  5, 2024 deadline provided in the January 4, 2024 order.  While Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.300 gives  the Court discretion to allow a party to withdraw or amend an admission if the  admission was the result of mistake, inadvertence or excusable neglect and the  party who obtained the admission will not be substantially prejudiced in  maintaining its action or defense on the merits, Plaintiff has not satisfied  the conditions for relief under this statute.   Plaintiff argues that his counsel was experiencing personal matters,  including housing displacement, that prevented him from appearing at the  January 4, 2024 hearing due to “error/mistakes with the calendaring of the  January 4, 2024 hearing.”  However,  Plaintiff has not explained why he did not serve discovery responses until June  2024.  The Court declines to exercise its  discretion to grant relief.  C.   Plaintiff’s motion for reconsideration of July 26,  2024 order  Plaintiff moves under Code of Civil Procedure section  1008 for reconsideration of the July 26, 2024 order denying Plaintiff's ex  parte application to continue the hearing on Apex's pending summary judgment  motion.  Plaintiff argues that the Court  misapplied Code of Civil Procedure section 437c, subdivision (h).  The Court finds that Plaintiff has failed to show new  or different facts, circumstances, or law.   The Court denies the motion.  CONCLUSION         The  Court DENIES Plaintiff Joshua Olaoniye’s motion for  reconsideration of the Court’s July 15, 2024 order.         The  Court DENIES Plaintiff Joshua Olaoniye’s motion for relief under the Discovery  Act.           The  Court DENIES Plaintiff Joshua Olaoniye’s motion for reconsideration of the  Court’s July 26, 2024 order.  Moving party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.  Moving party is ordered to file the proof of service  of this ruling with the Court within five days.
