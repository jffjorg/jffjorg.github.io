Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the motion to quash/motion for protective order regarding the subpoena of Plaintiff's medical records from Chino Valley Medical Center. The judge concludes that the subpoena is overbroad to the extent that it requests documents concerning Plaintiff's shoulders rather than left shoulder and requests records from February 24, 2011 to February 23, 2014. The judge modifies the subpoena to replace the word "shoulders" with "left shoulder" and to replace the phrase "from 02/24/2011 to present" with "from 02/24/2014 to present." The judge denies the motion in all other respects and denies Defendant's request for sanctions.
