 Case Number:  23STCV10827    Hearing Date:   September 26, 2024    Dept:  28 Having  considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers, the Court rules as  follows.  BACKGROUND  On  May 12, 2023, Plaintiff Fe R. Molina (“Plaintiff”)  filed this action against Defendants Los Angeles County Metropolitan  Transportation Authority (“Defendant”) and Does 1-10 for motor vehicle tort.  On  May 16, 2023, Plaintiff filed a first amended complaint against Defendant and  Does 1-10 for motor vehicle tort.  On  May 6, 2024, Defendant filed an answer.  On  August 22, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion for a protective order.  The motion was set for hearing on September  26, 2024.  On September 13, 2024,  Defendant filed an opposition.  On  September 17, 2024, Plaintiff filed a reply.  Trial  is currently scheduled for March 7, 2025.  PARTIES’ REQUESTS  Plaintiff  asks the Court to issue a protective order permitting Plaintiff to attend her  deposition remotely.  Defendant  asks the Court to deny the motion.  LEGAL STANDARD  Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.420 provides in  part:  “(a) Before, during, or after a deposition, any party,  any deponent, or any other affected natural person or organization may promptly  move for a protective order. The motion shall be accompanied by a meet and  confer declaration under Section 2016.040.  “(b) The court, for good cause shown, may make any  order that justice requires to protect any party,  deponent, or other natural person or organization from unwarranted annoyance,  embarrassment, or oppression, or undue burden and expense. This protective  order may include, but is not limited to, one or more of the following  directions:   * * * ““(5) That the deposition be taken only on certain specified terms and conditions. . . .”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.420,  subds. (a), (b)(5).)  DISCUSSION  Plaintiff  asks the Court to allow her to attend her deposition remotely to reduce the  risk of contracting COVID-19.  Plaintiff  argues that she is 83 or 84 years old and as a result is particularly  vulnerable to the potential harm resulting from a COVID infection.  According to Plaintiff, Defendant will suffer  no prejudice if Plaintiff appears remotely rather than in person for her deposition.  Plaintiff  also contends that Defendant’s amended deposition notice was untimely under  Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.270, subdivision (a), which provides that “[a]n  oral deposition shall be scheduled for a date at least 10 days after service of  the deposition notice.”  (See L. Edmon  & C. Karnow, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2024)  ¶ 8:492, p. 8E-26 (Cal. Practice Guide) [longer notice periods required for  service by mail, overnight delivery, fax, and electronic mail].)  In  opposition, Defendant argues that Plaintiff has cited no legal authority supporting  her request for a remote deposition.  Defendant  also contends that it will suffer prejudice if the deposition takes place  remotely.  The Court  has reviewed the original and amended deposition notices and finds that  Defendant timely served the amended deposition notice.  The  Court grants Plaintiff’s motion for a protective order.  Defendant does not contest Plaintiff’s  assertion that she is 83 or 84 years old and could suffer severe consequences if she  contracts COVID-19.  Although Defendant  argues that “no legal authority exists allowing courts to order remote  depositions,” Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.420 authorizes the Court, “for  good cause shown,” to “make any order that justice requires to protect any  party, deponent, or other natural person from unwarranted annoyance, embarrassment,  or oppression, or undue burden and expense.”   (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.420, subd. (b).)  The Court may make orders to carry out these  objectives that are “not limited to” the directions listed in the statute.  (Code  Civ. Proc., § 2025.420, subd. (b); see Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.420, subd.  (b)(5) [court may order “[t]hat the deposition be taken only on certain  specified terms and conditions”].)  It  is true that a remote deposition has drawbacks compared to an in-person  deposition.  (See  Cal. Practice Guide, supra, ¶ 8:650, p. 8E-92.)  The Court therefore makes the following  suggestions for counsel to consider before the remote deposition takes place:  ·       Consider entering into a stipulation regarding, for  example, the technology to be used, limitations on any “off-line”  communications, procedures for attorney-client communications, who will do the  audio and video recording, and whether there should be a second camera in the  room with the deponent to ensure no inappropriate contact is being made.  (See Cal. Practice Guide, supra, ¶  8:650, p. 8E-93.) ·       Consider agreeing on how to handle documents.  (See Cal.  Practice Guide, supra, ¶ 8:650, p. 8E-93.) ·       Consider pre-marking and circulating to all participants  most documents and oversized exhibits.  (See Cal.  Practice Guide, supra, ¶ 8:650, p. 8E-93.) ·       Consider ensuring that the witness is not using notes  or, if the witness is using notes, that they are shared with all parties. (See Cal. Practice Guide, supra, ¶ 8:650,  p. 8E-93.) ·       Consider testing all equipment and Internet  connectivity before the deposition begins.  (See Cal.  Practice Guide, supra, ¶ 8:650, p. 8E-93.) ·       Consider making sure that counsel are not  inadvertently sharing unintended documents on their technology. (See Cal. Practice Guide, supra, ¶ 8:650, p.  8E-93.) CONCLUSION The Court  GRANTS Plaintiff Fe R. Molina’s motion for a protective order and orders that  Plaintiff may attend her deposition remotely.  Moving  party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.  Moving  party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court  within five days.
