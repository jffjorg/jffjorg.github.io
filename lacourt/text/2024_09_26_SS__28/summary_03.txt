And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the plaintiff's motion for reconsideration of the July 15, 2024 order, which denied the plaintiff's motion to reconsider, set aside, or vacate the court's January 4, 2024 and April 9, 2024 orders. The plaintiff argued that the court "erred in a very important aspect" but failed to show new or different facts, circumstances, or law.

The judge also denies the plaintiff's motion for relief under the Discovery Act, which sought to grant relief from the court's January 4, 2024 order granting Apex's motions to compel discovery responses and deeming admitted matters specified in requests for admission. The plaintiff did not serve discovery responses before the January 4, 2024 hearing or by the February 5, 2024 deadline, and the court declines to exercise its discretion to grant relief.

Finally, the judge denies the plaintiff's motion for reconsideration of the July 26, 2024 order, which denied the plaintiff's ex parte application to continue the hearing on Apex's pending summary judgment motion. The plaintiff argued that the court misapplied Code of Civil Procedure section 437c, subdivision (h) but failed to show new or different facts, circumstances, or law.
