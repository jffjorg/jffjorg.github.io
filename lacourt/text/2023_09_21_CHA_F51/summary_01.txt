And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by Defendant Guillermo Neunschwander Grupp seeking leave to file a Cross-Complaint against Amazon.Com, Inc. The motion was unopposed and the Judge has granted it. The Defendant is ordered to file the Cross-Complaint separately after the hearing by the end of the day on September 21, 2023.

The background of the case shows that Plaintiff Jaime Rene Lara Castro filed a suit against Defendants Uber Technologies, Inc. and Guillermo Neunschwander Grupp on January 20, 2023, alleging causes of action for general negligence and motor vehicle negligence.

The Judge analyzed the case under California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) 426.50, which provides that a party who fails to plead a cause of action may apply to the court for leave to amend their pleading or file a cross-complaint. The Judge found that the Defendant acted in good faith in failing to file its cross-complaint and that relief to file a compulsory cross-complaint must be liberally granted to avoid forfeiture of causes of action.

The Defendant's contention is that Plaintiff's deposition confirmed the existence of an Amazon delivery truck at the location where the incident took place, which blocked the Defendant's view of southbound traffic on Balboa Boulevard. The Defendant believes that this information warrants a Cross-Complaint against Amazon for indemnity and contribution should the Defendant be found liable for the incident.

The Judge concluded that the motion is granted and the Defendant is ordered to file the Cross-Complaint separately after the hearing.

## English Summary:

In this case, Plaintiff Jaime Rene Lara Castro sued Uber Technologies, Inc. and Guillermo Neunschwander Grupp for negligence related to a car accident. Defendant Grupp filed a motion asking the court for permission to file a cross-complaint against Amazon.Com, Inc. 

The Judge's tentative ruling grants Defendant Grupp's motion. The Judge found that there is no evidence of bad faith on the part of Defendant Grupp in delaying the cross-complaint. The Judge states that California law generally requires courts to liberally allow the filing of cross-complaints unless there is a showing of bad faith.

Defendant Grupp believes Amazon.Com, Inc. is liable for contributing to the accident because an Amazon delivery truck was present at the scene, allegedly blocking Defendant Grupp's view.
