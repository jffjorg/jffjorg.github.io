TENTATIVE
RULINGS ON MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES 
RELIEF
REQUESTED
“Defendant/Cross-Complainant
EGL ASSOCIATES, INC.’s (hereinafter “EGL ASSOCIATES”) will, and hereby does,
move for an order compelling Cross-Defendant JE TSU KAO (“KAO”) to fully
respond to Defendant/Cross Complainant’s first set of Form Interrogatories –
Construction Litigation, served by Defendant/Cross Complainant on November 21,
2023. EGL ASSOCIATES will also move for an order to impose a monetary sanction
in the amount of $2,274.22 against Cross Defendant KAO and/or her attorneys of
record, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure Sections 2023.010–2023.040 and
2030.300.
The
motion will be made on the grounds that the KAO’s answers to EGL ASSOCIATES
Form Interrogatories – Construction Litigation, Set One number(s) 324.1, and
325.1 are evasive and/or incomplete and the objections are without merit and/or
too general.
The
motion will be based on this notice of motion, the memorandum in support, the
attached declaration of Nicholas L. D’Amico, Esq., separate statement and the
papers, records, and file in this action, and such oral and documentary
evidence as may be presented at the hearing of the motion.”

PROCEDURAL ANALYSIS
45-Day Requirement
“Unless notice of this motion is given within
45 days of the service of the verified response, or any supplemental verified
response, or on or before any specific later date to which the propounding
party and the responding party have agreed in writing, the propounding party
waives any right to compel a further response to the interrogatories.” (CCP
§2030.300(c).)
Here,
it is not entirely clear to this Court how this motion is timely; however, the
Opposition does not make any argument that this motion is untimely. Therefore,
the Court finds this motion timely.
Meet
and Confer
“A
motion under subdivision (a) shall be accompanied by a meet and confer
declaration under Section 2016.040.” (CCP §2030.300(b)(1).)
Je
Tsu Kao served responses to Movant’s counsel on May 20, 2024. After receiving
initial responses, Movant’s counsel, D’Amico, sent a meet and confer on May 28,
2024. 
On
June 18, 2024, Movant received supplemental responses, and then filed this
motion on July 8, 2024.
Opposition’s
motion and declaration (Matthew Yarling) argues that Movant never attempted a
meet and confer after receiving the supplemental responses on June 18, 2024
because Movant never informed Opposition that it had a problem with the
supplemental responses.
Movant
explains that it did not attempt to meet and confer after the supplemental
responses because the supplemental responses did not address the issues that
were brought up in the first meet and confer. Movant also explains that it did
not meet and confer because the supplemental responses did not provide any
supplemental responses to the discovery items at issue. [The Court does not
understand Movant’s argument about how supplemental responses were not provided
to the items at issue because Movant itself attached the supplemental responses
to the items at issue.] 
Movant
further explains it did not attempt to meet and confer after the supplemental
responses were sent because the deadline to file a motion to compel further was
about to expire. [The Court also does not understand Movant’s argument here
because the supplemental responses were provided on June 18, 2024, and the
instant motion was not filed until July 8, 2024. Therefore, it appears as if
Movant had plenty of time to further meet and confer on the issues it had with
the supplemental responses of June 18, 2024 before filing this motion on July
8, 2024.]
As
stated in Indio Police Command Unit Assn. v. City of Indio (2014) 230
Cal.App.4th 521, 539:
“[W]hether a party
actually engaged in meetings in good faith is generally a factual
question, and the fact-finder's express or implicit determination will be
upheld on appeal if supported by substantial evidence. [Citations.]” (Santa
Clara County Correctional Peace Officers' Assn. v. County of Santa Clara (2014)
224 Cal.App.4th 1016, 1027, 169 Cal.Rptr.3d 228.) “ ‘In general, good faith
is a subjective attitude and requires a genuine desire to
reach agreement [citations]. The parties must make a serious attempt
to resolve differences and reach a common ground [citation]. The
effort required is inconsistent with a “predetermined resolve not to
budge from an initial position.” [Citations.]’ [Citation.] However, adamantly
insisting on a position does not necessarily establish bad faith.
[Citation.]” (Id. at p. 1044, 169 Cal.Rptr.3d 228.)
(Indio
Police Command Unit Assn. v. City of Indio (2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 521,
539.)
The
Court will hear argument.
 LEGAL STANDARD - COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TO
INTERROGATORIES
Under CCP § 2017.010, “any party may
obtain discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the
subject matter involved in the pending action..., if the matter either is
itself admissible in evidence or appears reasonably calculated to lead to the
discovery of admissible evidence.”  The
Section specifically provides that “[d]iscovery may relate to the claim or
defense of the party seeking discovery or of any other party to the action,”
and that discovery “may be obtained of the identity and location of persons
having knowledge of any discoverable matter, as well as of the existence,
description, nature, custody, condition and location of any document,
electronically stored information, tangible thing, or land or other property.”
On receipt of a
response to interrogatories, the propounding party may move for an order
compelling a further response if the propounding party deems that any of the
following apply:
(1)   An answer to a particular interrogatory is
evasive or incomplete.
(2)   An exercise of the option to produce documents
under Section 2030.230 is unwarranted or the required specification of those
documents is inadequate.
(3)   An objection to an interrogatory is without
merit or too general.
(CCP §2030.300(a).
If a timely motion to compel has been filed,
the¿burden is on the responding party¿to justify any objection or failure fully
to answer.¿(Coy v. Superior Court of Contra Costa County (1962) 58
Cal.2d 210, 220–221 [addressing a motion to compel further responses to
interrogatories]; see also¿Fairmont Ins. Co. v. Superior Court¿(2000) 22
Cal.4th 245, 255.)  
“While the party propounding interrogatories may have
the burden of filing a motion to compel if it finds the answers it receives
unsatisfactory, the burden of justifying any objection and failure to respond
remains at all times with the party resisting an interrogatory.” (Williams
v. Superior Court (2017) 3 Cal.5th 531, 541 citing Coy v. Superior Court
(1962) 58 Cal.2d 210, 220-221.)
Furthermore, to the extent there is any doubt in
whether these records should be discoverable, California’s liberal approach to
discovery provides that doubt should be resolved in favor of permitting
discovery. (Pacific Tel. & Tel. Co. v. Superior Court (1970) 2
Cal.3d 161, 173.)
The party to whom interrogatories have been propounded
shall respond in writing under oath separately to each interrogatory by any of
the following:
(1) An answer
containing the information sought to be discovered.
(2) An exercise of
the party’s option to produce writings.
(3) An objection to
the particular interrogatory.
 
(CCP §2030.210(a).)
TENTATIVE RULING
“While the party propounding interrogatories may have
the burden of filing a motion to compel if it finds the answers it receives
unsatisfactory, the burden of justifying any objection and failure to respond
remains at all times with the party resisting an interrogatory.” (Williams
v. Superior Court (2017) 3 Cal.5th 531, 541 citing Coy v. Superior Court
(1962) 58 Cal.2d 210, 220-221.)
Movant seeks to compel further responses to Form
Interrogatories 324.1 and 325.1 from Defendant/Cross-Complainant’s first set of
Form Interrogatories – Construction Litigation propounded on Je Tsu Kao on
November 21, 2023.
Although the burden of justifying any objections
remains with the opposing party to this motion, the Opposition indicates that
second supplemental responses were served on July 18, 2024, after the filing of
this motion on July 8, 2024, to avoid wasting judicial resources or burdening
the Court. Therefore, Opposition argues that this motion is moot.
The Reply to this motion does not address the fact
that the Opposition stated how second supplemental responses were served after
the filing of this motion. The Reply instead only focuses on how it was forced
to file this motion because once it received supplemental responses, the
deadline to file a motion to compel further was about to expire. 
Based on Reply’s nonresponsive-response to the
Opposition mentioning how second supplemental responses were served after the
filing of this motion, this Court is inclined to find that this motion should
be denied as moot with respect to compelling further responses. However, the
issue of sanctions would not be moot.
Sanctions
“The court shall
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)
against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a
motion to compel a further response to interrogatories, unless it finds that
the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that
other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (CCP
§2030.300(d).)
 
“The court may
award sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion
to compel discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was filed, or
opposition to the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided
to the moving party after the motion was filed.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule
3.1348(a).) 
 
Movant requests
sanctions in the amount of $2,274.22 against Cross-Defendant Je Tsu Kao and/or
his attorneys of record. Movant’s counsel’s (D’Amico) sanction’s requested is
based on: (1)An hourly rate of $400; (2) 3.5 hours for the preparation of this
motion; (3) 2 hours for reviewing and replying to the opposition and appearing
at the hearing for this motion; and (4) $74.22 for costs of filing this motion.
 
Opposition argues
that sanctions should not be imposed because Kao participated in a meet and
confer after submitting its responses, submitted supplemental responses after
the meet and confer, and because Kao submitted second supplemental responses
after the filing of this motion. Opposition argues that Kao never engaged in a
misuse of the discovery process.
 
The Court will
hear argument.
 
[The Court notes
that the instant motion on hearing today ends with the Res ID of 3498. This
motion is the only motion reserved and scheduled on the court reservation
system. It appears that on the same date that the instant motion was filed,
Defendant/Cross-Complainant, EGL Associates, Inc. also filed a motion to compel
Cross-Defendant Je Tsu Kao’s Responses to Form Interrogatories – General, Set
One. That motion ends with a Res ID of 0471; however, that motion is not
scheduled on eCourt. Therefore, it is unclear to the Court if Movant also
wanted its motion ending in Res ID 0471 to be heard at the instant hearing, or
if Movant removed/withdrew the motion ending in 0471. If Movant wants the
motion heard ending in Res ID 0471, Movant needs to reserve and schedule a
hearing on the Court’s reservation system.]
