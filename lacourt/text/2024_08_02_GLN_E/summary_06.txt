And here is a summary in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on Defendant's motion to compel arbitration of the dispute. The motion is denied in part and granted in part. The Court finds that the arbitration agreement is valid and enforceable, but that the first cause of action for sexual harassment is not subject to arbitration because the agreement explicitly excludes sexual harassment claims. The Court will hear argument on whether the UCL claim is barred from arbitration. The Court notes that there are issues with service of the motion, including a lack of proof of service and uncertainty about the proper address for service. Despite these issues, the Court considers the opposition and reply and will hear argument on the outstanding issues.
