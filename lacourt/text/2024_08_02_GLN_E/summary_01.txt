And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses a motion to compel further responses to interrogatories filed by EGL ASSOCIATES, INC. (Movant) against Je Tsu Kao (Responding Party). The motion seeks to compel further responses to Form Interrogatories 324.1 and 325.1 from Defendant/Cross-Complainant's first set of Form Interrogatories – Construction Litigation propounded on November 21, 2023. The Responding Party has filed opposition and the Movant has filed a reply.

The judge finds that the motion is timely, despite the Responding Party's argument that the motion is untimely. The judge also finds that the Movant did not engage in a meet and confer after receiving the supplemental responses, despite the Responding Party's argument that the Movant did not attempt to meet and confer after receiving the supplemental responses.

The judge is inclined to deny the motion to compel further responses as moot, as the Responding Party has filed second supplemental responses after the filing of the motion. However, the judge will hear argument on the issue of sanctions.

The Movant requests sanctions in the amount of $2,274.22 against the Responding Party and/or his attorneys of record. The judge will hear argument on whether the sanctions should be imposed.

Overall, the judge's tentative ruling suggests that the Responding Party's failure to fully respond to interrogatories may not be sufficient to warrant compulsion, but that the issue of sanctions will be addressed at the hearing.
