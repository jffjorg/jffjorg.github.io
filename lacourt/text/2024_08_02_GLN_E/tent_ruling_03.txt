Case Name: TORANG SAROUKHANI v. ARARAT HOME OF
LOS ANGELES, INC.; and DOES 1-50 inclusive

[TENTATIVE RULING ON
MOTION TO BIFURCATE]
 
RELIEF REQUESTED
“Defendant, ARARAT HOME OF LOS ANGELES, INC
(hereinafter "Defendant") will and does hereby move this Court for an
Order bifurcating the issues of liability and punitive damages and to preclude
evidence and/or reference to punitive damages and Defendant's financial
condition during the liability phase of the trial.
 
This
Motion is made pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure §§598 and
1048, and Civil Code §§3294 and 3295, on the grounds that bifurcation is
in furtherance of convenience, will avoid significant prejudice to Defendant,
and will promote judicial economy. 
 
This
Motion will be based on this Notice, the attached Memorandum of Points and
Authorities, any and all pleadings and records contained within the court's
file, and any oral or documentary evidence presented during the hearing of this
matter.”

Mot. p. 1-2.)
 
PROCEDURAL
Moving Party:  Defendant, Ararat Home
of Los Angeles, Inc.
Responding Party: No Opposition by Plaintiff
Moving Papers: Notice/Motion; Proposed Order
Opposition Papers: No Opposition
Reply Papers: No Reply
Proof of Service Timely Filed (CRC Rule
3.1300(c)): Ok
16/21 Court Days Lapsed (CCP § 1005(b)): Ok

Proper Address (CCP § 1013, § 1013a, § 1013b): Uncertain – The Court will hear
argument as to whether Defendant served this motion on the proper email address
for Plaintiff’s counsel. On eCourt, Plaintiff’s counsel’s email address is
listed as cr@mcreynoldsllp.com. Defendant did not serve moving papers on the
email address listed on eCourt. Instead, Defendant served moving papers to the
two email addresses of info@mcreynoldsllp.com and Elen@mcreynoldsllp.com. However,
the Court notes that the header of several documents that Plaintiff filed on
eCourt lists Plaintiff’s “E-Service Address” as info@mcreynoldsllp.com. For
example, in the header, where Plaintiff’s counsel lists the firm address, on
both the Complaint and Motion for Trial Preference, Plaintiff noted the
“E-Service Address” as info@mcreynoldsllp.com; and this motion was in fact served
to info@mcreynoldsllp.com. However, since eCourt lists a different email
address for Plaintiff’s counsel, the Court will hear argument as to the proper
service address of Plaintiff’s counsel.
BACKGROUND
Plaintiff, Torang
Saroukhani, filed a Complaint against Defendant, Ararat Home of Los Angeles,
Inc. on 4/21/2023 alleging two causes of action for: (1) Elder Abuse (Pursuant
to the Elder Adult and Dependent Adult Civil Protection Act – Welfare and
Institutions Code §§ 15600, et seq.) and (2) Negligent Hiring and
Supervision (CACI 426).
Plaintiff’s
motion for trial preference was granted on 4/17/2024.
Trial
is set for 9/3/2024.
ANALYSIS
Defendant
moves for an order bifurcating the issues of liability and punitive damages and
to preclude evidence and/or reference to punitive damages and Defendant’s
financial condition during the liability phase of the trial.
Plaintiff’s
Complaint alleges that while Plaintiff was a 94-95 years of age resident at
Defendant’s facility, Plaintiff suffered falls when Plaintiff was supposed to
be under heightened medical supervision as a result of her deteriorating mental
and physical health. (See Compl. ¶¶ 19-20.)
Since
the Complaint seeks punitive damages, Defendant argues that before this Court
allows the jury to hear any evidence of Defendant’s financial condition or
worth, the jury should first make a preliminary determination whether Defendant
is liable to Plaintiff at all, and if so, whether Defendant’s acts or omissions
amounted to mere negligence or met the significantly higher threshold for
malice, fraud, or oppression. Defendant argues that to allow otherwise would
result in unfair prejudice to Defendant because a jury could be swayed toward
liability in favor of Plaintiff by virtue of Defendant’s financial condition or
wealth.
Defendant’s
motion cited CCP §§ 598 and 1048, as well as Civil Code §§ 3294 and 3295 as its
basis for bifurcation.
Since
Defendant’s citation to Civil Code § 3295(d) appears to be the citation that is
the most on point, the Court will focus its analysis on Civil Code § 3295(d).
As
stated in Civil Code § 3295(d):
The court shall, on application of any defendant, preclude the
admission of evidence of that defendant’s profits or financial condition until
after the trier of fact returns a verdict for plaintiff awarding actual damages
and finds that a defendant is guilty of malice, oppression, or fraud in
accordance with Section 3294. Evidence of profit and financial condition shall
be admissible only as to the defendant or defendants found to be liable to the
plaintiff and to be guilty of malice, oppression, or fraud. Evidence of profit
and financial condition shall be presented to the same trier of fact that found
for the plaintiff and found one or more defendants guilty of malice,
oppression, or fraud.
(Civil
Code § 3295(d).)
As
explained in Notrica v. State Compensation Ins. Fund:
The purpose behind Civil Code section 3295, which allows
bifurcation and preclusion of evidence of a defendant's wealth and profits
during the liability phase of trial, is to minimize prejudice prior to the
jury's determination of a prima facie case of liability for punitive
damages. (Torres v. Automobile Club of So. California (1997)
15 Cal.4th 771, 777–778, 63 Cal.Rptr.2d 859, 937 P.2d 290.) However, such
evidence is not to be excluded on the basis of prejudice when the information
is relevant to liability. (Rawnsley v. Superior Court (1986)
183 Cal.App.3d 86, 91–92, 227 Cal.Rptr. 806.) 
(Notrica v. State Compensation Ins. Fund (1999)
70 Cal.App.4th 911, 939.)
“A request under section 3295, subdivision (d)
is essentially a motion in limine, and ordinarily should be made before
trial.” (Las Palmas Associates v. Las Palmas Center Associates (1991)
235 Cal.App.3d 1220, 1241.)
Here, Defendant argues that its financial
condition has nothing to do with whether it is liable to Plaintiff for her
alleged damages. 
In light of the fact that no Opposition has been
submitted, the Court fails to see how evidence of financial condition is
relevant to liability in this case, and thus finds Defendant’s argument
availing.
TENTATIVE RULING
The Court tentatively
plans to GRANT Defendant’s motion to bifurcate the issues of liability and
punitive damages and to preclude evidence and/or reference to punitive damages and
Defendant’s financial condition during the liability phase of the trial.
However, the Defendant needs to address the
service address issue that the Court previously noted in the procedural section
of this tentative.
