  - "However, such evidence is not to be excluded on the basis of prejudice when the information is relevant to liability."
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is tentatively ruling in favor of the defendant's motion to bifurcate the issues of liability and punitive damages, and to preclude evidence and/or reference to punitive damages and the defendant's financial condition during the liability phase of the trial. The judge finds that the defendant's financial condition is not relevant to liability and that bifurcation will help to minimize prejudice prior to the jury's determination of a prima facie case of liability for punitive damages. However, the judge notes that the defendant needs to address the issue of service address, as the defendant did not serve the motion on the proper email address for the plaintiff's counsel.
