And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion by the plaintiff, Louise Stephens, to file a Second Amended Complaint. The motion is based on California Code of Civil Procedure Section 473, Section 576, and Rule of Court 3.1324, relevant case law, and is made on the grounds that the causes of action for Products Liability Negligence and Strict Products Liability are timely and arise out of the same events as the claims asserted in the operative complaint. The proposed amendment includes products liability causes of action that are allowable causes of action against Defendant ASSA ABLOY.

The judge notes that the plaintiff has complied with all the requirements of California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1324(a)-(b), and that none of Defendant's arguments in Opposition are availing. The judge tentatively plans to GRANT the plaintiff's motion for leave to file a Second Amended Complaint. The judge also notes that the parties should be prepared to address whether or not there is a service issue with respect to this motion.
