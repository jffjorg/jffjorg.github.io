RELIEF REQUESTED
Defendant,
All American Healthcare Services, Inc., moves for an order compelling
arbitration of this dispute. Defendant’s motion is made on the grounds that
Plaintiff and Defendant have entered into a valid and enforceable arbitration
agreement which applies to the claims alleged in this case.
 
ANALYSIS
Plaintiff,
Crystal Quijano, filed the instant Complaint against Defendant, All American
Healthcare Services, Inc., on 1/11/2024.
 
The Complaint alleges two
causes of action for (1) Violation of California Government Code § 12940(j)
(Unlawful Harassment), and (2) Violation of California Business &
Professions Code §§ 17200, et seq.
 
Plaintiff alleges that
Defendants are a staffing agency that connects healthcare workers with
facilities for shifts and that Defendants have employed Plaintiff as a
non-exempt, hourly-paid employee from approximately March 2021 to the present.
(Compl. ¶ 16.) Plaintiff alleges she  works as an hourly-paid nurse assistant. (Id.)
Plaintiff alleges that she was harassed by Defendants based on her sex, gender,
and gender identity and expression. (Id. at ¶ 17.) Plaintiff alleges she
is a transgender woman and that she uses feminine pronouns and the name “Crystal
Quijano.” (Id. at ¶ 18.) Plaintiff alleges that Defendants use her legal
name, Orlando Quijano, which she does not use, and that Defendants use
masculine pronouns to refer to her. (Id. at ¶¶ 18-19.) Plaintiff alleges
she asked Defendants several times to use Plaintiff’s chosen name, Crystal,
instead of her legal name, and to address her as a woman, but Defendants
refuse. (Id. at ¶ 20.)
 
Arbitration Agreement
Defendant
attaches Exhibit A, which contains the arbitration provision at issue here. In
relevant part, the arbitration provision provides:
 
1. I and All American Healthcare Services,
In. (“the Company”) agree to utilize binding individual arbitration to resolve
all disputes that might arise out of or be related in any way to my application
for employment and/or employment by the Company. Such disputes include, but are
not limited to, claims I might bring against the Company for wrongful
termination, discrimination, harassment, retaliation, breach of contract, wage
and hour violations, and torts such as invasion of privacy, assault and
battery, or defamation. Such disputes also include claims that the Company
might bring against me such as, for example, theft of money or trade secrets,
breach of a confidentiality agreement, or breach of a contract. I and the
Company each specifically waive our respective rights to bring such claims against
t the other in a court of law and to have a trial by jury.
 
2. The only exceptions to binding
arbitration shall be for claims arising under the National Labor Relations Act
which are brought before the National Labor Relations Board, claims for medical
and disability benefits or other forms of compensation under the my state of
residence (“State” or “MyState”) Workers’ Compensation Act, claims for benefits
brought before my State Employment Development Department or similar agency,
individual claims for wages brought before the my State Labor Commissioner or
similar agency, or other claims that are not subject to arbitration under law,
including but not limited to claims for sexual harassment and/or sexual assault
brought under state or federal law unless I voluntarily elect to submit such
claims to arbitration. Moreover, nothing herein shall prevent me from filing a
charge or complaint with the United States Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission, the my State Employment Agency, or any local agency that allows me
to file an administrative charge or complaint. Once the agency’s proceedings
are completed, however, if I wish to pursue the matter further, I understand
that I must do so under this Agreement.
 
(Def. Mot., Ex. A., “Dispute Resolution Agreement,” ¶¶
1-2.)
 
Defendant argues that on October 8, 2022, Plaintiff
and All American entered into an agreement to arbitrate which explicitly
mandates the resolution of all of Plaintiff’s claims.
 
The Court finds that Defendant’s argument – that all
of Plaintiff’s claims are subject to arbitration – is, at the very least,
partially unavailing. 
 
Claim for Unlawful Harassment – California
Government Code § 12940(j)
As
stated in Harris v. TAP Worldwide, LLC:
 
California law favors enforcement of valid
arbitration agreements. (Armendariz v. Foundation Health Psychcare Services,
Inc. (2000) 24 Cal.4th 83, 97, 99 Cal.Rptr.2d 745, 6 P.3d 669 (Armendariz ); Broughton
v. Cigna Healthplans (1999) 21 Cal.4th 1066, 1074, 90 Cal.Rptr.2d 334,
988 P.2d 67.) Because arbitration is a contractual matter, a party who has not
agreed to arbitrate a controversy cannot be compelled to do so. (Grey v.
American Management Services (2012) 204 Cal.App.4th 803, 808, 139
Cal.Rptr.3d 210; Sparks v. Vista Del Mar Child and Family Services (2012)
207 Cal.App.4th 1511, 1518, 145 Cal.Rptr.3d 318 (Sparks ).)
When the material facts are undisputed, we determine the existence of an
agreement to arbitrate de novo. (Casas v. Carmax Auto Superstores Cal. LLC (2014)
224 Cal.App.4th 1233, 1235, 169 Cal.Rptr.3d 96 (Casas, hereafter); Sparks, supra, 207
Cal.App.4th at p. 1519, 145 Cal.Rptr.3d 318.) The party seeking arbitration
bears the initial burden of demonstrating the existence of an arbitration
agreement. (Pinnacle Museum Tower Assn. v. Pinnacle Market Development (US),
LLC (2012) 55 Cal.4th 223, 236, 145 Cal.Rptr.3d 514, 282 P.3d
1217 (Pinnacle ); Engalla v. Permanente Medical Group,
Inc. (1997) 15 Cal.4th 951, 972, 64 Cal.Rptr.2d 843, 938 P.2d
903; Sparks, supra, 207 Cal.App.4th at p. 1518,
145 Cal.Rptr.3d 318.) Once the moving party has satisfied its burden,
the litigant opposing arbitration must demonstrate grounds which require
that the agreement to arbitrate not be enforced. (Pinnacle, supra, 55
Cal.4th at p. 236, 145 Cal.Rptr.3d 514, 282 P.3d 1217; Engalla v.
Permanente Medical Group, Inc., supra, 15 Cal.4th at p.
972, 64 Cal.Rptr.2d 843, 938 P.2d 903; Sparks, supra, 207
Cal.App.4th at p. 1518, 145 Cal.Rptr.3d 318.)
 
(Harris v. TAP Worldwide,
LLC (2016) 248 Cal.App.4th 373, 380-81.)
 
Further, as stated in Vianna v. Doctors’ Management
Co.:
 
“The court should attempt to give effect
to the parties' intentions, in light of the usual and ordinary meaning of the
contractual language and the circumstances under which the agreement was
made.” (Weeks v. Crow (1980) 113 Cal.App.3d 350, 353 [169
Cal.Rptr. 830].) Because California has a “ 'strong public policy in favor
of arbitration' ” (Moncharsh v. Heily & Blase (1992) 3 Cal.4th
1, 9 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 183, 832 P.2d 899]), “... arbitration agreements
should be liberally interpreted, and arbitration should be ordered unless the
agreement clearly does not apply to the dispute in question” (Weeks v. Crow, supra,
113 Cal.App.3d at p. 352). “Doubts as to whether an arbitration clause
applies to a particular dispute are to be resolved in favor of sending the
parties to arbitration.” (United Transportation Union v. Southern Cal. Rapid
Transit Dist. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 804, 808 [9 Cal.Rptr.2d 702].)
 
(Vianna v. Doctors’ Management Co. (1994) 27
Cal.App.4th 1186, 1189.)
Plaintiff does not dispute the existence of the
arbitration agreement, nor does she challenge the agreement as procedurally or
substantively unconscionable.
 
Plaintiff argues that the arbitration agreement
expressly excludes sexual harassment claims. 
 
The Court finds Plaintiff’s argument availing that the
first cause of action for “Violation of California Government Code § 12940(j)
(Unlawful Harassment)” is expressly excluded from arbitration because the
agreement excludes sexual harassment claims.
 
Although the first paragraph of the arbitration
agreement indicates that harassment claims are subject to arbitration, the
second paragraph of the arbitration agreement explicitly excludes sexual
harassment claims from arbitration. [“In the construction of the instrument the
intention of the parties, is to be pursued, if possible; and when a general and
a particular provision are inconsistent, the latter is paramount to the
former.” (Harris v. TAP Worldwide, LLC (2016) 248 Cal.App.4th 373, 387.)
“Particular expression qualify those which are general.” (Id.)]
 
Here, Plaintiff’s first cause of action – for
violation of California Government Code § 12940(j) – is a claim for sexual
harassment as explained in Lyle v. Warner Brothers Television Productions:
 
With certain exceptions not implicated
here, the FEHA makes it an unlawful employment practice for an employer,
“because of the ... sex ... of any person, ... to discriminate against the
person in compensation or in terms, conditions, or privileges of employment.”
(§ 12940, subd. (a).) Likewise, it is an unlawful employment practice for an
employer, “because of ... sex, ... to harass an employee.” (§ 12940, subd.
(j)(1).) Under the statutory scheme, “ ‘harassment’ because of sex” includes
sexual harassment and gender harassment. (§ 12940, subd. (j)(4)(C).) These
prohibitions represent a fundamental public policy decision regarding “the need
to protect and safeguard the right and opportunity of all persons to seek and
hold employment free from discrimination.” (Brown v. Superior Court (1984)
37 Cal.3d 477, 485, 208 Cal.Rptr. 724, 691 P.2d 272; see also Mogilefsky
v. Superior Court (1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 1409, 1414, 26 Cal.Rptr.2d
116.)
 
(Lyle v. Warner Brothers Television Productions (2006)
38 Cal.4th 264, 277.)
 
Therefore, at the very least, Plaintiff’s first cause
of action is not to be compelled to arbitration because the second paragraph of
the arbitration provision explicitly excludes sexual harassment claims from
being sent to arbitration.
 
Second Cause of Action - Violation of
California Business & Professions Code §§ 17200, et seq.
As
to whether or not Plaintiff’s UCL claim is subject to arbitration, the Court
will hear argument.
 
Plaintiff argues that the Federal Arbitration Act
(FAA) and the Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment
Act of 2021 (EFAA) – two federal pieces of legislation – exclude sexual
harassment claims from arbitration. 
 
As a preliminary matter, Plaintiff does not explain
how or why these two pieces of federal legislation are legally binding for the
instant motion to compel arbitration hearing. 
 
Further, even if this Court assumes that Plaintiff’s
argument is true, the explicit language of the arbitration agreement already precludes
the sexual harassment claim from going to arbitration in the first place.
 
Therefore, the issue would be whether or not the UCL
claim is barred from arbitration.
 
Plaintiff’s argument that the UCL claim is barred from
arbitration is based on the argument that the UCL claim is wholly predicated on
her first cause of action for sexual harassment. Plaintiff cites to Turner
v. Tesla, Inc. (N.D. Cal. 2023) 686 F.Supp. 3d 917, 925 to support this
argument. 
 
In Turner, five of Plaintiff’s claims stemmed
directly from allegations of sexual harassment and were thus not subject to
arbitration because the arbitration agreement was unenforceable with respect to
these claims. (Turner v. Tesla, Inc. (N.D. Cal. 2023) 686 F.Supp. 3d
917, 926.) However, the United States District Court, N.D. California in Turner
also found that two claims (Violation of Labor Code § 6310 and Failure to
Provide Wages at Termination) were not on their face within the scope of EFAA;
however, because the two claims were substantially related to Turner’s sexual
harassment claims and their resolution was intertwined with the resolution of
the sexual harassment claims, the Turner court ruled that the EFAA
renders the parties’ arbitration agreement unenforceable in the entire case
because it involved a plausibly pleaded sexual harassment dispute. (Id.
at 921 and 927-28.) 
 
Here, while Plaintiff’s UCL claim appears to be
substantially related to Plaintiff’s sexual harassment claim and its resolution
intertwined with the resolution of the sexual harassment claim, the problem is
that Turner is a federal district court case, which is not binding
authority on this Court.
 
Further, Plaintiff argues that under Kader v.
Southern California Medical Center (2024) 99 Cal.App.5th 214, the
arbitration agreement is a pre-dispute agreement as required by the EFAA, and
because Plaintiff’s Complaint is a sexual harassment dispute, both the FAA and
Defendant’s arbitration agreement require that it be excluded from arbitration.
 
As to Plaintiff’s argument with respect to Kader,
the Court does not understand the argument that Plaintiff is attempting to
assert. Further, even if Kader is applicable, it does not address UCL
claims. Kader appears to focus on what is considered a “dispute” under
the EFAA and when a dispute arises; however, Kader does not appear to
fully address the issue that we face here with respect to a UCL claim.
 
TENTATIVE RULING
Defendant’s
motion to compel arbitration with respect to the first cause of action in the
Complaint is DENIED.
 
With respect to the second cause of action, the Court
will hear argument because the Opposition did not provide legal authority that
was directly on point. However, the Court notes that Defendant did not submit a
Reply. Therefore, as of now, even though Turner  is not binding, Plaintiff’s argument with
respect to Turner appears to be a persuasive manner to handle the UCL
claim from a practical standpoint. 
 
Further, as Plaintiff’s Opposition pointed out, there
appears to be some service issues with this motion. Under California Rules of
Court, Rule 3.1300(c), “Proof of service of the moving papers must be filed no
later than five court days before the time appointed for the hearing.” (Ibid.)
Here, Defendant has not filed a proof of service for the moving papers, and any
such proof of service would be late. Additionally, since Defendant never filed
a proof of service, this Court cannot evaluate whether or not this motion is
timely under CCP § 1005(b) because the Court does not know when this motion was
served. Further, technically, the Court cannot determine if this motion was
served to the proper address; however, the Court notes that Plaintiff opposed
this motion. Thus, since Plaintiff opposed the motion, it appears that
Plaintiff received Defendant’s motion.
 
Plaintiff indicates that her Opposition is late due to
an internal calendaring error and the problems with the Court’s mandatory
e-filing system that were caused by a ransomware attack. “No paper may be
rejected for filing on the ground that it was untimely submitted for filing. If
the court, in its discretion, refuses to consider a late filed paper, the
minutes or order must so indicate.” (CRC, Rule 3.1300(d).) Here, the Court
considers Plaintiff’s untimely Opposition.
 
The Court will hear argument.
