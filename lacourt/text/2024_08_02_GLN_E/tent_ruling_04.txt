[TENTATIVE RULING ON
DEMURRER]
Moving Party:  Defendant, Jirair Krikor Kiladjian
Responding Party: Plaintiff,
Onik Khodaverdian
RELIEF REQUESTED
Defendant, Jirair Krikor Kiladjian, demurs to the SAC pursuant to CCP §
430.10(e) and 430.30 on the grounds that the SAC and each cause of action
therein fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against
Defendant Kiladjian.
BACKGROUND
On 1/26/2024, this Court
ruled on Defendant’s demurrer to the FAC. In relevant part, the Court stated in
its tentative, “The Court finds that the FAC as it stands should be sustained
for failure to state a cause of action and failure to provide the Court’s
jurisdiction of the subject of the cause of action. However, the Court finds
that these deficiencies may be cured by amendment.” (Min. Order 1/26/2024, p.
4.) Further, the Court noted that it sustained the demurrer to the FAC with 20
days leave to amend, and that the Case Management Conference is continued to
4/25/2024.
On
3/13/2024, Plaintiff filed a Second Amended Complaint (SAC) against Defendants
– Montbleu Apartments, LLC, a Limited Liability Company, and Jirair Krikor
Kiladjian, an individual – alleging causes of action for (1) Premises Liability
(Negligence) and (2) Premises Liability (Willful Failure to Warn) against both
Defendants.
On
April 18, 2024, this Court DENIED Defendants’ motion to strike.
On
June 7, 2024, this Court DENIED Defendants’ motion for reconsideration of the
April 18, 2024 ruling on the motion to strike.
Now,
Defendant, Jirair Krikor Kiladjian, demurs to both causes of action in the SAC.
In
the SAC, Plaintiff alleges that they visited the premises located on 2940
Montrose Ave., Glendale, CA 91214 and that they tripped on a segment of uneven
pavement which was present on the premises of the subject property.

a proof of service for the Proposed Order.]

Opposition Papers: Opposition

Reply Papers: Reply

Meet and Confer
A party filing a demurrer “shall meet and confer in person or by telephone
with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the
purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve
the objections to be raised in the demurrer.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., §430.41, subd. (a).) 
“The parties shall meet and confer at least five days before the date
the responsive pleading is due. If the parties are not able to meet and confer
at least five days prior to the date the responsive pleading is due, the
demurring party shall be granted an automatic 30-day extension of time within
which to file a responsive pleading, by filing and serving, on or before the
date on which a demurrer would be due, a declaration stating under penalty of
perjury that a good faith attempt to meet and confer was made and explaining
the reasons why the parties could not meet and confer.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §430.41, subd. (a)(2).)
Failure to sufficiently meet and confer is not grounds to overrule or sustain a
demurrer. (Id., §430.41(a)(4).)
Here,
Defendant’s counsel alleges that a meet and confer attempt was made on several
occasions but that the only responses Defendant has received from Plaintiff’s
counsel was an inquiry about Defendant’s authority to settle. (See Torello
Decl. ¶¶ 3-5.) 
LEGAL STANDARDS FOR DEMURRERS
Demurrer
– Sufficiency
A demurrer for
sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action.  (Hahn v. Mirda, (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th
740, 747.)  When considering demurrers,
courts read the allegations liberally and in context.  (Taylor v. City of Los Angeles Dept. of
Water and Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228.)  The court “treat[s] the demurrer as admitting
all material facts properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or
conclusions of fact or law ….”  (Berkley
v. Dowds (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 518, 525.) 
In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of
the pleading or via proper judicial notice. 
(Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968,
994.)  A demurrer tests the pleadings
alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters; therefore, it lies only
where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially
noticed.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 430.30,
430.70.)  The only issue involved in a
demurrer hearing is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with
extraneous matters, states a cause of action. (Hahn, supra, 147
Cal.App.4th at 747.)  
The
general rule is that the plaintiff need only allege ultimate facts, not
evidentiary facts.  (Doe v. City of
Los Angeles (2007) 42 Cal.4th 531, 550.) 
“All that is required of a plaintiff, as a matter of pleading … is that
his complaint set forth the essential facts of the case with reasonable
precision and with sufficient particularity to acquaint the defendant with the
nature, source and extent of his cause of action.”  (Rannard v. Lockheed Aircraft Corp.
(1945) 26 Cal.2d 149, 156-157.)  
On
demurrer, a trial court has an independent duty to “determine whether or not
the … complaint alleges facts sufficient to state a cause of action under any
legal theory.”  (Das v. Bank of
America, N.A. (2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 727, 734.)  Demurrers do not lie as to only parts of
causes of action, where some valid claim is alleged but “must dispose of an
entire cause of action to be sustained.” 
(Poizner v. Fremont General Corp. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97,
119.)  “Generally
it is an abuse of discretion to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend if
there is any reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by
amendment.”  (Goodman v. Kennedy
(1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349.)
ANALYSIS
Service
The hearing on this
demurrer was initially scheduled for July 26, 2024. When the Opposition was
submitted on 7/12/2024, Plaintiff accurately noted how this demurrer was
untimely under CCP § 1005(b). This demurrer was initially untimely because 16
court days before July 26, 2024 would be July 3, 2024 [July 4, 2024 was a Court
Holiday]. The instant demurrer’s proof of service does not indicate service
until July 8, 2024. While the Reply attempts to argue that this demurrer was
served on July 5, 2024, Defendant’s own proof of service does not indicate as
such. Defendant’s proof of service for the demurrer indicates service on July
8, 2024. Further, even if service had occurred on July 5, 2024, this motion
would still be untimely because 16 court days before July 26, 2024 was July 3,
2024, and 2 calendar days would have had to have been added for electronic
service, which means the moving papers should have been served by July 1, 2024.
However,
after the Opposition was submitted on 7/12/2024, on 7/23/2024, this Court
continued the 7/26/2024 hearing to 8/2/2024.
Based
on the hearing date of 8/2/2024, the instant demurrer appears timely. 
First Cause of Action – Premises Liability (Negligence); Second
Cause of Action – Premises Liability (Willful Failure to Warn)
As a preliminary matter,
the Court notes that on many occasions, both parties failed to cite legal
authority for their arguments and failed to tie their arguments to what was
actually alleged in the SAC.
Defendant,
Kiladjian, demurs to the first and second causes of action for premises
liability on grounds of failure to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause
of action. Despite demurring on that basis, Defendant does not once cite legal
authority as to what must be alleged to sufficiently state a cause of action for
premises liability. Further, Defendant does not make any arguments as to how any
specific element of a cause of action for premises liability was not alleged.
Instead,
Defendant argues that Montbleu Apartments, LLC is the legal entity that owns the
Montrose Garden Apartments and that Defendant Kiladjian is not the owner of the
apartment building where the alleged trip and fall occurred. 
Defendant
argues that “California law clearly states that members and managers of Limited
Liability Companies(LLC) are not personally liable for the debts, obligations,
or other liabilities of the LLC.” (Def. Dem. p. 7.) 
Defendant
argues that there are no allegations to support the extraordinary remedy of
piercing the corporate veil, which would hold Kiladjian personally liable for
Montbleu Apartments, LLC. To support this argument, Defendant cites to
California Corporations Code Section 17703.04(a).
As
stated in Corporations Code § 17703.04:
(a) All of the following apply to debts, obligations, or
other liabilities of a limited liability company, whether arising in contract,
tort, or otherwise:
(1) They are solely the debts, obligations, or other
liabilities of the limited liability company to which the debts, obligations,
or other liabilities relate.
(2) They do not become the debts, obligations, or other
liabilities of a member or manager solely by reason of the member acting as a
member or manager acting as a manager for the limited liability company.
(Corp. Code § 17703.04(a).)
Defendant’s argument faces several problems. 
First, Defendant’s citation to Corporations Code
§ 17703.04(a) does not address what must be alleged at the pleading stage.
Second, Defendant fails to distinguish a
difference between the allegations with respect to the first cause of action
and the second cause of action.
For example, Defendant argues that Defendant
Kiladjian is not the owner of the apartment building and thus cannot be held
personally liable for Montbleu Apartments, LLC’s obligations. 
However, the allegations in the second cause of
action allege “Defendants, as the owners and operators of the premises as
hereinabove alleged, were negligent in that, among other things, they failed to
exercise due care in the ownership, construction, operation, and maintenance of
the premises to ensure that visitors were not subject to any unreasonable risk
of harm when on the premises.” (SAC ¶ 33.)
Therefore, with respect to the second cause of
action, all Defendants were alleged to be the owners in ¶ 33. Therefore
Kiladjian’s argument that Kiladjian is not an owner would fail because the
demurrer assumes the truth of the matters that are pled. Whether or not
Kiladjian is actually the owner would be outside the scope of demurrer.
However, despite the fact that ¶ 33 of the SAC
alleges that all Defendants are owners with respect to the second cause of
action, the allegations preceding the second cause of action, and when reading
the SAC as a whole, and when reading the Plaintiff’s Opposition, it appears as
if Plaintiff is not in fact alleging that Defendant Kiladjian is an owner of
the property.
For example, the SAC alleges:
3. The premises located at 2940 Montrose Ave. Glendale, California
91214 (“subject property”) is an apartment complex managed by Defendant
Montbleu Apartments, LLC (“Montbleu”).
4. Defendant Jirair Krikor Kiladjian is an individual who is
manager, chief executive officer, and agent for service of Montbleu.
5. Plaintiff herein alleges that Defendants, including Montbleu,
Kiladjian and all DOES 1- 50 were responsible for the repair and maintenance of
the subject property and are each therefore responsible for the harm caused to
the Plaintiff.
…
9. Defendant Montbleu Apartments, LLC is a California limited
liability company authorized to do business in California whose principal
address is located within Los Angeles County and who engages in the business of
property management.
10. Defendant Jirair Krikor Kiladjian is an individual who, at all
relevant times, acted as manager, chief executive officer, and agent for
service of process for Montbleu.
25. Montbleu, as property manager of the subject property, owed a
duty to all tenants and invitees to use ordinary care to avoid injury to such
tenants and invitees. 
26. Kiladjian, as manager of Montbleu, failed to exercise such
ordinary care in maintaining the premises of Montbleu in safe condition for
tenants and invitees and is thus liable for failure to fulfill his legal duty.
(SAC ¶¶ 3-5, 9-10, 25-26.)
The second cause of action does not start until
¶ 31 in the SAC, and the allegations of ownership were not alleged until ¶ 33,
and when reading the allegations preceding the second cause of action in the
context of the SAC as a whole, it appears as if Plaintiff is not attempting to allege
that Kiladjian is an owner despite the allegations to the contrary in ¶ 33 of
the SAC.
Further, Plaintiff’s Opposition also seems to
concede that Plaintiff is not alleging Kiladjian to be an owner.
“JIRAIR KRIKOR KILADJIAN is alleged to be the
person who is operating, managing, and running the business where the injury
took place. There is no LLC listed publicly on any sign as to who runs the
apartment building and instead it is operating under Montrose Gardens
Apartments. This dba is not registered with the City of LA to show the LLC is
who is running the apartments. As an afterthought, the Defendant is seeking to
use the legal title holder as an attempt to shield liability. All causes of
action are properly plead against JIRAIR KRIKOR KILADJIAN.” (Pl. Oppo. p. 2.)
Further, Plaintiff’s Opposition argued:
Defendants have the pleading under CC Section 17703.04(a), however
this goes beyond the scope of the pleading and is an appropriate for the
demurrer stage, not to mention the duplicative motions as stated above. 
Plaintiffs have clearly alleged two valid causes of action against
JIRAIR KRIKOR KILADJIAN under theories of Premise Liability, Willful Failure to
Warn and Negligence. See Second Amended Complaint Paragraphs 13-30.
(Pl. Oppo. p. 3.)
Alter Ego Doctrine
The case of Sonora
Diamond Corp. v. Superior Court helps explain the alter ego doctrine:
Ordinarily, a corporation is regarded as a legal entity, separate
and distinct from its stockholders, officers and directors, with separate and
distinct liabilities and obligations. (Wenban Estate, Inc. v.
Hewlett (1924) 193 Cal. 675, 696, 227 P. 723; Communist
Party v. 522 Valencia, Inc. (1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 980, 993,
41 Cal.Rptr.2d 618; Robbins v. Blecher (1997)
52 Cal.App.4th 886, 892, 60 Cal.Rptr.2d 815.) A corporate identity
may be disregarded—the “corporate veil” pierced—where an abuse of the corporate
privilege justifies holding the equitable ownership of a corporation liable for
the actions of the corporation. (Roman Catholic
Archbishop v. Superior Court (1971) 15 Cal.App.3d
405, 411, 93 Cal.Rptr. 338.) Under the alter ego doctrine, then, when the
corporate form is used to perpetrate a fraud, circumvent a statute, or
accomplish some other wrongful or inequitable purpose, the courts will ignore
the corporate entity and deem the corporation's acts to be those of the persons
or organizations actually controlling the corporation, in most instances the
equitable owners. (Robbins v. Blecher, supra, 52 Cal.App.4th
at p. 892, 60 Cal.Rptr.2d 815; Communist Party v. 522 Valencia,
Inc., supra, 35 Cal.App.4th at pp. 993–994, 41 Cal.Rptr.2d
618.) The alter ego doctrine prevents individuals or other corporations
from misusing the corporate laws by the device of a sham corporate entity
formed for the purpose of committing fraud or other misdeeds. (Associated
Vendors, Inc. v. Oakland Meat Co. (1962) 210 Cal.App.2d 825,
842, 26 Cal.Rptr. 806.) In California, two conditions must be met before the
alter ego doctrine will be invoked. First, there must be such a unity of
interest and ownership between the corporation and its equitable owner that the
separate personalities of the corporation and the shareholder do not in reality
exist. Second, there must be an inequitable result if the acts in question are
treated as those of the corporation alone. (Automotriz etc. De
California v. Resnick (1957) 47 Cal.2d 792, 796.)
(Sonora Diamond Corp. v. Superior Court (2000)
83 Cal.App.4th 523, 538.)
Further, A.J. Fistes Corp explains the
pleading standard for alleging liability under the alter ego doctrine:
“To recover on an alter ego theory, a plaintiff need not use the
words ‘alter ego,’ but must allege sufficient facts to show a unity of interest
and ownership, and an unjust result if the corporation is treated as the sole
actor.” (Leek v. Cooper (2011) 194 Cal.App.4th 399, 415, 125
Cal.Rptr.3d 56 [complaint alleging individual defendant was owner of all
stock of defendant corporation and personally made all its business decisions
was not sufficient for alter ego liability]; cf. Rutherford Holdings,
LLC v. Plaza Del Rey (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 221, 235, 166 Cal.Rptr.3d
864 [plaintiff sufficiently alleged unity of interest by alleging
corporate entity was inadequately capitalized, failed to “abide by the
formalities of corporate existence,” and was dominated, controlled, and used by
defendant as a “mere shell and conduit”].)
(A.J. Fistes Corp. v. GDL Best Contractors,
Inc. (2019) 38 Cal.App.5th 677, 696.)
Therefore, if Plaintiff’s Opposition is
conceding that Kiladjian is not an owner of the premises, and if Plaintiff is
arguing that Plaintiff sufficiently made allegations to hold Kiladjian liable
under a theory of the alter ego doctrine, the Court does not find that Plaintiff
sufficiently made alter-ego allegations.
However, the Court will hear argument because it
is possible that the Court may find that Kiladjian did not meet its burden in presenting
legal authority for this Court to sustain the demurrer. 
While Kiladjian focuses on ownership and the Corporations
Code in its demurrer, Kiladjian’s demurrer does not cite case law relating to
what must be pled at this stage. The Court cited all of the legal authority
under the section of this tentative decision with respect to the alter-ego
doctrine; Kiladjian cited only the Corporations Code.
The reason the Court is hesitant to sustain this
demurrer is because Kiladjian ignores what elements must be alleged for a
premises-liability claim.
The elements of a cause of action for premises
liability are the same as those for negligence. (Jones v. Awad (2019) 39
Cal.App.5th 1200, 1207 citing Castellon v. U.S. Bancorp (2013) 220
Cal.App.4th 994, 998) Accordingly, the plaintiff must prove a legal duty to use
due care, a breach of such legal duty, and the breach as the proximate or legal
cause of the resulting injury. (Jones v. Awad, supra, 39 Cal.App.5th at
1207 citing Beacon Residential Community Assn. v. Skidmore, Owings &
Merrill LLP (2014) 59 Cal.4th 568, 573.) 
Kiladjian does not attack a single element of a
premises-liability claim.
Further, the Court is concerned as to whether
Kiladjian’s focus on ownership is potentially a red herring.
“A defendant need not own, possess, and control
property to be held liable; control alone is sufficient.” (Alcarez v. Vece (1997)
14 Cal.4th 1149, 1162.)
TENTATIVE RULING
The Court will hear
argument. 
The Court’s GRANTS Defendant’s requests for judicial
notice. 
The Court DENIES Plaintiff’s request for sanctions.
