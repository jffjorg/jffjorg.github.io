And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in response to the defendants' motion to strike portions of the complaint regarding punitive damages. The defendants, Parvin Golshan, Jean-Pierre Okhovat, and Paul Aslan, argue that the allegations do not rise to the level of malice, oppression, or fraud necessary to recover punitive damages. However, the Judge finds that the complaint alleges sufficient facts to support a claim of malice or oppression. Specifically, the complaint alleges that the defendants knew of and failed to remediate dangerous conditions at the property from 2021 to 2023, and that they willfully and deliberately failed to avoid the consequences. The Judge concludes that these allegations are analogous to the facts in Nolin v. National Convenience Stores, Inc. (1979), and that they suffice to constitute despicable conduct done in conscious disregard of the plaintiffs' right to habitable housing and of their safety. Therefore, the Judge denies the defendants' motion to strike and orders them to answer within 20 days.
