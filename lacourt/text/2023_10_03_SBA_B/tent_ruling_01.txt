TENTATIVE RULING

Manuel Migueles, et al.’s Motion to Strike Portions of
First Amended Complaint is denied. 
 
Background
 
Plaintiffs’ Complaint was filed on September 13, 2022.
The First Amended Complaint was filed on May 11, 2023. Plaintiffs allege the
following facts. Plaintiffs are tenants/residents at 222 W. Lime Street
Apartment C, Inglewood, California 90301 pursuant to a lease agreement. Defendants
are the owners and/or managers. The property suffers from water intrusion and
mold. Defendants failed to remedy the situation. Plaintiffs allege the
following causes of action: 1. Statutory Breach of the Warranty of Habitability
(Civ. Code 1941, 1941.1); 2. Tortious Breach of Implied Warranty of
Habitability; 3. Negligence; 4. Breach of Contract; 5. Nuisance; 6. Breach of
the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment; 7. Breach of Implied Covenant of Good Faith
and Fair Dealing; 8. IIED; 9. Violation of Inglewood Stabilization Ordinance –
Harassment; 10. Violation of Civil Code 1942.4. 
 
            Meet and Confer
             
            Defendant set forth a meet and
confer declaration in sufficient compliance with CCP § 435.5.  (Decl. Tiffanie Q. Spivey, ¶¶ 2-3.) 
 
Motion to
Strike  
 
The court may, upon a motion, or at any time in its
discretion, and upon terms it deems proper, strike any irrelevant, false, or
improper matter inserted in any pleading. 
CCP § 436(a).  The court may also
strike all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with
the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of the court.  CCP § 436(b). 
The grounds for a motion to strike are that the pleading has irrelevant,
false or improper matter, or has not been drawn or filed in conformity with laws.  CCP § 436. 
The grounds for moving to strike must appear on the face of the pleading
or by way of judicial notice.  CCP § 437.
 
Defendants move to strike the following: “1. All references to punitive damages 2. Pages 8-9,
paragraphs 54-56, in its entirety 3. Page 10, paragraph 69, in its entirety 4.
Page 12, paragraph 80, in its entirety 5. Page 14, paragraph 95, in its
entirety 6. Pages 16-17, paragraph 112, in its entirety 7. Page 19, paragraph
129, in its entirety 8. Page 21, paragraph 139, in its entirety 9. Page 22,
paragraph 148, in its entirety 10. Prayer For Relief, page 22, item 5, lines
26-28” (Notice of Motion, page 1, line 28 to page 2, lines 1-9).
 
Defendant’s motion to strike is denied. 
 
Civ. Code, § 3294 states, in relevant part:
“(a) In an action for the breach of an obligation not
arising from contract, where it is proven by clear and convincing evidence that
the defendant has been guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice, the plaintiff,
in addition to the actual damages, may recover damages for the sake of example
and by way of punishing the defendant.
(b) An employer shall not be liable for damages
pursuant to subdivision (a), based upon acts of an employee of the employer,
unless the employer had advance knowledge of the unfitness of the employee and
employed him or her with a conscious disregard of the rights or safety of
others or authorized or ratified the wrongful conduct for which the damages are
awarded or was personally guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice. With respect
to a corporate employer, the advance knowledge and conscious disregard, authorization,
ratification or act of oppression, fraud, or malice must be on the part of an
officer, director, or managing agent of the corporation.”
 
            Punitive damages may be recoverable
against a landlord when the landlord’s breach of the implied warranty of
habitability also constitutes facts to meet intentional nuisance or intentional
infliction of emotional distress. Stoiber
v. Honeychuck (1980) 101 Cal.App.3d 903, 919-21. While Stoiber
remains recognized law, this does not excuse or eliminate the well-established
authority which states that the pleading of punitive damages requires the
pleading of specific facts. As such, in granting the motion to strike as to the
original Complaint, the Court noted that the requisite specific facts that
Defendant acted willfully, maliciously, intentionally, and/or recklessly were
lacking.
 
Here, however, with the FAC, Plaintiffs set forth
specific facts that Defendant acted willfully, maliciously, intentionally,
and/or recklessly in an attempt to support Plaintiffs’ allegations and prayer
for punitive damages.
 
Plaintiffs allege the following: “On or about December
1, 2018, started to notice water intrusion and mold present at the Property. In
addition to the problems stated in paragraph 26, Plaintiffs identified other
substandard issues present at the Property (“Issues”). These issues include but
are not limited to unclean commons areas, defective and leaking plumbing, water
leaking from the ceiling turning brown, bathroom plumbing issues, nasty odor
from water contamination, and inadequate repairs.” (FAC, ¶¶ 26-27.) 
 
Then, Plaintiffs outline the eight separate occasions
through the span of nearly four years, where Plaintiffs notified Defendant of
these issues.  (FAC, ¶¶ 29-36.)  Plaintiffs also notified the Health Department
which then also notified Defendant of these issues.  (FAC, ¶¶ 46-47.)  Despite this, Defendant still failed to remedy
the issues.  (FAC, ¶¶ 38-45, 52-53).
 
Plaintiffs’ FAC is replete with allegations that
Defendant knew or should have known that Plaintiffs would be injured by the
conditions but knowingly and intentionally failed to repair the conditions. With
the FAC, the allegations are bolstered with specific facts which support these
allegations. The Court notes that the allegations are remarkably similar to
those set forth in Stoiber v. Honeychuck
(1980) 101 Cal.App.3d 903 which the Court of Appeal determined was sufficient
to support a prayer for punitive damages.
 
            Therefore, the motion to strike is denied.
 
Defendant is ordered to file an Answer
within 10 days of this date.
 
Plaintiffs are ordered to give notice of
this ruling.
