The defendants had moved to strike the First Amended Complaint's references to punitive damages, as well as certain paragraphs that alleged the defendants' willful and malicious behavior in failing to remedy water intrusion and mold issues at the property. The Judge concluded that the plaintiffs had provided sufficient evidence to support their claims for punitive damages, including specific facts that the defendants had failed to repair the issues despite being notified of them. The Judge also noted that the allegations were similar to those in a previous case, Stoiber v. Honeychuck, which was deemed sufficient to support a prayer for punitive damages. The defendants are ordered to file an Answer within 10 days of the ruling, and the plaintiffs are ordered to give notice of the ruling.

**English Summary:**

The judge denied the Defendant's motion to strike portions of the Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint. The Plaintiffs allege that the Defendant, as the owner and/or manager of their apartment building, acted willfully, maliciously, intentionally, and/or recklessly by failing to repair water intrusion and mold issues despite multiple notifications from the Plaintiffs and the Inglewood Health Department.  The Judge found that the Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint adequately supported their claim for punitive damages, citing relevant case law (Stoiber v. Honeychuck) and arguing that the specific facts presented were sufficient to meet the legal requirements.
