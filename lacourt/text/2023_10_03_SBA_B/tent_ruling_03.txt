TENTATIVE RULING
 
            Jody Aronson, M.D.’s Motion to Compel Plaintiff to Provide Further
Responses to Special Interrogatories and for Sanctions is granted.
 
Ronald Williams’s Motion to
Compel the Deposition of Torrance Memorial Medical Center and for Sanctions is
denied without prejudice.
 
            Background
 
            Plaintiff
filed the Complaint on January 6, 2023. Plaintiff alleges the following facts. Plaintiff’s
wife, Chionese Agee, died on November 9, 2022, after surgery at defendant’s
hospital. Plaintiff alleges the following cause of action: 1. Wrongful Death.
 
            Motion to
Compel Further Responses to Special Interrogatories 
 
Where
responses to interrogatories have been served but the requesting party believes
that they are deficient because the answers are evasive or incomplete, or,
because an objection is without merit, that party may move for an order
compelling a further response.  CCP §
2030.300(a).  Notice of the motion must
be given within 45 days after service of verified responses in question, or any
verified supplemental responses.  CCP §
2030.300(c).  The motion must be
accompanied by a meet and confer declaration in compliance with CCP §
2016.040.  CCP § 2030.300(b).
 
Meet and Confer
 
Defendant
Aronson set forth a meet and confer declaration in substantial compliance with
CCP §§ 2031.310(b)(2) and 2016.040.  (Declaration, N. Denise
Taylor, ¶¶ 5-9.)
 
Motion
 
Defendant moves for an order for further responses to
Special Interrogatories 13-15, and 18-20. Plaintiff failed to file any written
opposition to the motion. The special interrogatories at issue simply seek
basic facts as to the alleged negligent acts which Plaintiff complains of in
this action. Plaintiff’s responses are incomplete, evasive, non-responsive, and
Plaintiff’s objections are without merit.
 
Plaintiff is ordered to serve further responses,
without objections, within 10 days of this date. 
 
Sanctions
 
Defendant’s request for monetary sanctions is granted.
Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel are sanctioned the total amount of $2,060.00
which was calculated at 8 hours to prepare and appear at $250/hour, plus $60
filing fee. Sanctions are payable within 30 days of this date.
 
Motion to Compel Deposition
 
The
party noticing the deposition may move for an order compelling appearance at
the deposition and production of documents, pursuant to the deposition notice,
from the party deponent who fails to appear or produce materials requested in
the deposition notice, and who has not served a valid objection under §
2025.410(a).  CCP § 2025.450(a).  
 
“The
motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section
2016.040, or, when the deponent fails to attend the deposition and produce the
documents, electronically stored information, or things described in the
deposition notice, by a declaration stating that the petitioner has contacted
the deponent to inquire about the nonappearance.”  CCP § 2025.450(b)(2). 
 
Meet and Confer
 
Plaintiff set forth a meet and confer declaration in substantial
compliance with CCP § 2025.450(b)(2). (Decl., Neil M. Howard.) 
 
Motion
 
Defendant
TMMC filed a written opposition indicating that several of the depositions at
issue in this motion have already taken place, and, that several others have
been calendared throughout October. Thus, it cannot be stated, at this time,
that Defendant has failed to appear for its properly noticed deposition(s). 
 
Thus,
Plaintiff’s motion to compel deposition is denied without prejudice. Should
Defendant fail to appear for deposition, a subsequent motion can be filed,
following, of course, the mandatory meet and confer process. In addition, the
Court notes that the motion was filed and served only 10 court days prior to
the hearing rather than the required 16 court days pursuant to CCP § 1005(b).
                         
Sanctions
 
Plaintiff’s request for
monetary sanctions is denied without prejudice.  
 
 
Defendant Aronson M.D. is
ordered to give notice of this ruling.
