And here is a summary in English text:

Judge Gary Y. Tanaka issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer to the First Amended Cross-Complaint (FACC) filed by Credit Card Services, Inc. (CCS) against Heung Tae Oh, et al. CCS alleges that the defendants breached their contract, breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and interfered with their prospective economic advantage. The defendants demurred to the FACC, arguing that it fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action and is uncertain.

The court overruled the demurrer to the first cause of action for breach of contract, finding that CCS alleged sufficient facts to meet the elements of a cause of action. The court also overruled the demurrer to the second cause of action for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, finding that CCS alleged facts demonstrating the defendants' actions in depriving CCS of the benefit of the agreement.

The court sustained the demurrer to the third through fifth causes of action, finding that CCS failed to state facts sufficient to state a cause of action. The third cause of action for intentional interference with prospective economic advantage failed because CCS did not plead facts of an economic relationship with a third party. The fourth cause of action for negligent interference with prospective economic relations failed because CCS did not plead facts of an economic relationship with a third party. The fifth cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty failed because CCS did not plead facts showing that the defendants owed a fiduciary duty to CCS.

The court also deemed the motion to strike moot upon sustaining the demurrer to the third through fifth causes of action. The defendants are ordered to give notice of this ruling.

## Tentative Ruling Summary:

**Case:** Credit Card Services, Inc. v. Heung Tae Oh, et al. (22TRCV01133)

**Hearing Date:** October 3, 2023

**Judge:** Gary Y. Tanaka

**Plaintiff:** Credit Card Services, Inc.

**Defendant:** Heung Tae Oh and others

**Key Points:**

* **Demurrer:**  Plaintiff's demurrer to Defendant's First Amended Cross-Complaint (FACC) is overruled in part and sustained with 20 days leave to amend in part.
* **Motion to Strike:** Plaintiff's Motion to Strike portions of the FACC is deemed moot.

**Causes of Action:**

* **Breach of Contract (First Cause of Action):** Demurrer overruled. Sufficient facts presented to support the claim.
* **Breach of Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing (Second Cause of Action):** Demurrer overruled.  
* **Intentional Interference with Prospective Economic Advantage (Third Cause of Action)** and **Negligent Interference with Prospective Economic Relations (Fourth Cause of Action):** Demurrer sustained with 20 days leave to amend. Insufficient facts to establish an economic relationship with a third party.
* **Breach of Fiduciary Duty (Fifth Cause of Action):** Demurrer sustained with 20 days leave to amend. Insufficient facts to show existence of a fiduciary duty between the parties.

**Judge's Reasoning:**

The Judge found that the First and Second Causes of Action were sufficiently pleaded. However, the Third, Fourth, and Fifth Causes of Action lacked key factual allegations to support the existence of a fiduciary duty or an economic relationship with a third party, ultimately leading to the sustained demurrers with leave to amend.
