            v.
 
SHLOMO RECHNITZ, et

  Case No.:  21STCV15296
  Hearing Date:  December 13, 2023
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
defendants’ motion for judgment on the
  pleadings 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On April 22, 2021, Plaintiffs Jesus Gonzalez
(by and through his successor in interest, Carmen Batz), Carmen Batz, and Olivia
Knutson filed this action against Defendants Schlomo Rechnitz, Boardwalk West
Financial Services, LLC, G4 Wellness Group, LLC, and York Healthcare &
Wellness Centre, LP. The complaint asserts causes of action for (1) elder abuse
and neglect, (2) violation of resident rights, and (3) wrongful death. The
complaint arises from Plaintiff Gonzalez’s injuries and eventual death
allegedly sustained as a result of improper care at a skilled nursing facility.

            On November 14, 2023, Defendants
filed the instant motion for judgment on the pleadings against the first and
second causes of action. On November 30, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a notice of
non-opposition.
LEGAL STANDARD
A motion for judgment on the pleadings may
be made on the same grounds as those supporting a general demurrer, i.e., that
the pleading fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a legally cognizable
claim or defense. (Stoops v. Abbassi (2002) 100 Cal.App.4th 644, 650.) A
motion for judgment on the pleadings performs the same function as a general
demurrer, and hence attacks only defects disclosed on the face of the pleadings
or by matters that can be judicially noticed. (Cloud v. Northrop Grumman Corp.
(1999) 67 Cal.App.4th 995, 999.) Judgment on the pleadings must be denied where
there are material factual issues that require evidentiary resolution. (Schabarum
v. Calif. Legislature (1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 1205, 1216.)  
DISCUSSION
I.
Elder Abuse
To state a cause of action for elder
abuse, the plaintiff must plead facts showing two elements: (1) the defendant
has subjected an elder to statutorily-defined physical abuse, neglect or
financial abuse; and (2) the defendant acted with recklessness, malice,
oppression, or fraud in the commission of the abuse. (Welf. & Inst. Code, §
15657; Carter v. Prime Healthcare Paradise Valley LLC (2011) 198
Cal.App.4th 396, 404.) “[T]he facts constituting the neglect and establishing
the causal link between the neglect and the injury ‘must be pleaded with
particularity,’ in accordance with the pleading rules governing statutory
claims.” (Id. at p. 407.) Ordinary or gross negligence is insufficient
for a claim of elder abuse. (Id. at p. 405.)
Here, Plaintiffs do not dispute that the
complaint fails to allege the requisite egregiousness with the particularity
required to satisfy the pleading requirement for elder abuse. Therefore, the
first cause of action fails as a matter of law. 
II.
Patient’s Bill of Rights
            Health and Safety Code section
1430(b) allows a skilled nursing facility patient to bring a civil action for
violation of any rights set forth in specified sections of the California Code
of Regulations or any other right provided by federal or state law. 
            Plaintiffs do not dispute that the
complaint fails to set forth with particularity the violations of rights supporting
recovery under Section 1430(b). Therefore, the second cause of action fails as
a matter of law. 
CONCLUSION
            Defendants’ motion for judgment on
the pleadings is GRANTED.
