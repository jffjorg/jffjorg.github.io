And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the defendants' motion for a protective order, allowing them to attend the deposition of the plaintiff in person. The judge has also allowed the plaintiff's son, Raul Ramirez, to attend the deposition. The judge has ordered all parties to maintain civility and refrain from any disruptive conduct throughout the deposition. The judge has denied the plaintiff's request to exclude the defendants from the deposition, citing the statutory right of parties to attend depositions in their own case. The judge has also rejected the plaintiff's claims of fear and intimidation, finding that there is no evidence to support her claims of actual violence or threats of violence.
