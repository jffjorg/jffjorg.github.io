  order RE:
defendants’ motion to compel further
  responses to interrogatories and requests for admission (CRS# 1287, 8108)




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On February 10, 2011, plaintiff
Leonard W. Borisoff (“Borisoff”), a composer, filed a complaint against
defendants the Pullman Group, LLC; Wertheim, LLC; David Pullman; and Broadcast
Music, Inc. Defendants prevailed in the compelled arbitration proceeding and
were awarded ownership of Borisoff’s past and future royalties and attorney
fees of $67,866.13. On October 3, 2013, Defendants petitioned the Court to
confirm the award, which the Court did on January 15, 2014, with a final
judgment entered on August 27, 2014. Borisoff appealed the judgment. The Court
of Appeal reversed the judgment. On February 4, 2021, the Currency Corp
(“Plaintiff”) was substituted as Borisoff’s successor in interest after he
passed away in 2020.
            On February 9, 2023, Plaintiff filed
the operative Second Amended Complaint, alleging (1) fraud, (2) intentional
interference with contract, and (3) declaratory relief against Defendants
Pullman Group, David Pullman, and Wertheim LLC. 
On October 11, 2023, Defendants filed the
instant motions to compel further responses from Plaintiff regarding Interrogatories
and Requests for Admission. Plaintiff filed its opposition on November 28,
2023. Defendants filed their replies on December 6, 2023.
LEGAL STANDARD
            Upon
receiving responses to its discovery requests, the propounding party may move
for an order compelling further responses if the responses are incomplete or
evasive, or objections are without merit or too general. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300(a),
2031.310(a), 2033.290(a).) 
MEET AND CONFER
A motion to compel further must be
accompanied by a meet and confer declaration demonstrating an attempt to
resolve the matter informally. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300(b)(1), 2031.310(b),
2033.290(b).) The Court finds that Defendant has satisfied the meet and confer
requirement for interrogatories but not the RFAs. (See Lehman Decl., Ex. 4.) 
DISCUSSION
I.
Requests for Admission
            Defendant seeks to compel further
responses to over 20 RFAs for which it never met and conferred with Plaintiff.
Defense counsel claims to have met and conferred with Plaintiff, but the
referenced letter concerns requests for production and interrogatories. (Lehman
Decl., Ex. 4.) This warrants denial of the motion as to RFAs. 
II.
Interrogatories
An answer to an interrogatory must be as
complete and straightforward as possible. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.220(a).) Form
Interrogatories are drafted and approved by the Judicial Council and seek basic
information fundamental to routine discovery. (See Puerto v. Superior Court
(2008) 158 Cal.App.4th 1242, 1250.) A party “is entitled to demand answers to
its interrogatories, as a matter of right . . . [and] the burden of justifying
any objection and failure to respond remains at all times with the party
resisting an interrogatory.” (Williams v. Superior Court (2017) 3 Cal.5th
531, 541.) 
Plaintiff asserted the same objection to
each interrogatory at issue. Plaintiff incorporated general objections, then
further objected that the interrogatories were improperly directed to Leonard Borisoff
or were vague and unintelligible. These objections are without merit, and
Plaintiff’s opposition provides no valid argument in support of the objections.

CONCLUSION
            Defendant’s motions to compel further
responses are GRANTED in part. Plaintiff shall provide further responses to the
subject interrogatories within 15 days. Sanctions are denied as the parties
acted with substantial justification.
