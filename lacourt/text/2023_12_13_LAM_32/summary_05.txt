And here is the English-text summary:

Judge Leonard W. Borisoiff issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel further responses to interrogatories and requests for admission filed by the defendants. The case concerns a dispute between the plaintiff, Currency Corp (successor in interest to Leonard W. Borisoff), and the defendants, The Pullman Group, LLC, Wertheim, LLC, David Pullman, and Broadcast Music, Inc.

The defendants seek to compel further responses to over 20 requests for admission (RFAs) and to interrogatories. The judge finds that the defendants never met and conferred with the plaintiff regarding the RFAs and therefore denies the motion as to those requests. The judge grants the motion to compel further responses to the interrogatories, finding that the plaintiff's objections are without merit.

The judge orders the plaintiff to provide further responses to the subject interrogatories within 15 days and denies sanctions, finding that the parties acted with substantial justification. The case involves a long history, including an arbitration proceeding, a court confirmation of the award, an appeal, and a reversal of the judgment by the Court of Appeal. The plaintiff is seeking declaratory relief, fraud, and intentional interference with contract, while the defendants are seeking to compel further responses to interrogatories and RFAs.
