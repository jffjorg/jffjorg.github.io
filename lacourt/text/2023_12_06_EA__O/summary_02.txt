And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Yihang Duan, has filed a demurrer based on two grounds: that the attorney who initiated the lawsuit did not have the proper authorization from the named plaintiff, and that the complaint is uncertain, ambiguous, and unintelligible. The court has sustained the demurrer on both grounds. The court finds that the person who filed the complaint does not have the legal capacity to sue, as the only officer and director of the plaintiff corporation is Defendant Duan, and that the complaint is unclear due to numerous ambiguities and uncertainties. The court grants leave to amend the complaint.
