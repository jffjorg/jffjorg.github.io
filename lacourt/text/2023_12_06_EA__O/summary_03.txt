And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a defendant's motion for judicial notice related to a demurrer. The motion is treated as an Request for Judicial Notice (RJN) because it provides the required information in a different format. However, the parties did not meet and confer before filing the motion, as evidenced by an email exchange between defense counsel and plaintiff's counsel. The judge notes that while a formal motion for judicial notice is usually required, it is not necessary in this case. The judge will consider the motion as an RJN.
