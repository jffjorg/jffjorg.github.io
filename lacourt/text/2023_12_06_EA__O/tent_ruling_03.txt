[1] “Plaintiff is
informed and believes and thereon alleges that Defendants JIAN YU, YI HANG DUAN
AND RUI YU ("Joint Defendants") are aliases of each other and that
Defendant RUI YU is the current name Defendant YIHANG DUAN assumed.” (Complaint
P6.) 
 


[2] The motion for
judicial is made on the grounds that it is related to the disposition of the
demurrer. A party need not make a formal motion to request judicial notice
(RJN). Generally, a formal motion for judicial notice is required for purposes
of an appeal. (See CRC Rule 8.252.) However, when a party is seeking RJN with a
demurrer, the request must be made in a separate
document that lists the specific items for which notice is requested and must
comply with Cal Rules of
Ct 3.1306(c). Cal Rules of
Ct 3.1113(l). Thus, as
Defendant’s motion provides the requisite information just in a different form,
the court will treat the motion for judicial notice as an RJN. 
 


[3] It does not appear
the parties met and conferred. While Defense Counsel sent an email to
Plaintiff’s Counsel to discuss the demurrer, no further details have been
provided. (Demurrer, Ex. B, p. 12 of 14 of PDF.)
