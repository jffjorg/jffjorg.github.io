Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge denies the plaintiff's application for default judgment with prejudice. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant Xuefan Liu failed to wire funds as agreed, but the court finds that the allegations are not well-pled. The court also notes that the defendant Shi Qiang Zhang is a named defendant, but there are no allegations made against them. The court requires the plaintiff to plead the allegations with more specificity and to provide more detail about the fraudulent activities alleged. The court also finds that the declaration of an individual, Such Luo, is inadmissible as a translator. The court directs the plaintiff to file a second amended complaint if they wish to seek judgment against Shi Qiang Zhang.
